<HEAD>THE PROCESSION: ON THE FUNERAL OF QUEEN MARY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. STEELE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This distinguished writer, who was a native of Dublin (his father being private secretary to James duke of Ormond), was educated with Mr. Addison at the Charter-house. His inclination taking a military turn, he entered into the guards, where he soon obtained an ensign's commission; and in that station commenced author, by writing his "Christian Hero," printed in 1701, and inscribed to the lord Cutts, under whom he served; and followed in the next year by "The Funeral," a comedy; which recom∣mended him to the notice of king William, but too late in that monarch's life to be of any use to Mr. Steele. In 1703 his "Tender Husband" was acted; as was
<Q>“The Lying Lovers” in 1704.</Q>
His next appearance as a wri∣ter was, in his own words,
<Q>“in the quality of the lowest minister of state, as gazetteer;” an office he owed to Mr. Addison's introducing him to the earls of Hallifax and Sun∣derland.</Q>
In 1709 he began "The Tatler;" and was soon after made one of the commissioners of the stamp-office. When he laid down this paper, we are told by Mr. Gay,
<Q>“his disappearing seemed to be bewailed as some general calamity: every one wanted so agreeable an amusement: and the coffee-houses began to be sensible that the Esquire's lucubrations alone had brought them more customers than all their other news-papers put together. It must indeed be confessed, that never man threw-up his pen under stronger temptations to have employed it longer; his re∣putation was at a greater height than, I believe, ever any living author's was before him. It is reasonable to suppose that his gains were proportionably considerable; every one read him with pleasure and good-will: and the Tories, in respect to his other good qualities, had almost forgiven his unaccountable imprudence in declaring against them. Lastly, it was highly improbable, if he threw off a character, the ideas of which were so strongly impressed in every one's mind, however finely he might write in any new form, that he should meet with the same reception. To give you my own thoughts of this gentleman's writings, I shall in the first place observe, that there is this noble difference between him and all the rest of our polite and gallant authors: the latter have endeavoured to please the age by falling-in with them, and encouraging them in their fashionable vices, and false notions of things. It would have been a jest some time since, for a man to have asserted that any thing witty could be said in praise of a married state; or that devotion and virtue were any way ne∣cessary to the character of a fine gentleman. Bickerstaff ven∣tured to tell the town, that they were a parcel of fops, fools, and vain coquettes; but in such a manner, as even pleased them, and made them more than half-inclined to believe that he spoke truth. Instead of complying with the false sentiments or vicious tastes of the age, either in morality, criticism, or good-breeding; he has boldly assured them, that they were altogether in the wrong, and commanded them, with an authority which perfectly well became him, to surrender themselves to his arguments for virtue and good-sense. It is incredible to conceive the effect his writings have had on the town; how many thousand fol∣lies they have either quite banished, or given a very great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heck to; how much countenance they have added to virtue and religion; how many people they have rendered happy, by shewing them it was their own fault if they were not so; and, lastly, how entirely they have convinced our fops and young fellows of the value and advantages of learning. He has indeed rescued it out of the hands of pedants and fools, and discovered the true method of making it amiable and lovely to all mankind. In the dress he gives it, it is a most welcome guest at tea-tables and assemblies, and is relished and caressed by the mer∣chants on The Change; accordingly there is not one lady at court, nor a banker in Lombard-street, who is not ve∣rily persuaded, that Captain Steele is the greatest scholar and best casuist of any man in England.”</Q>
In 1710-11, in concert with Mr. Addison, he set up "The Spectator;" a work, which, as Dr. Johnson observes,
<Q>“comprizes precepts of criticism, sallies of invention, descriptions of life, and lectures of virtue; it employs wit in the cause of truth, and makes elegance subservient to piety: it has now for more than half a century supplied the English nation, in a great measure, with principles of speculation, and rules of prac∣tice; and given Addison a claim to be numbered among the benefactors of mankind.”</Q>
In 1712-13, Mr. Steele began "The Guardian;" and in 1713, "The Englishman," under which latter title he began a second collection in 1715. In 1713 he was chosen member for Stockbridge; but was expelled March 15, 1713, for some libellous paragraphs in "The Englishman." —
<Q>“I am in a thousand troubles for poor Dick, (says Mr. Addison, in a letter to Mr. Hughes, October 12, 1713), and wish that his zeal for the publick may not be ruinous to himself; but he has sent me word, that he is determined to go on; and that any advice I can give him in this particular will have no weight with him.”</Q>
Mr. Addison (as the event shewed) was too true a prophet. — In the eighth number of
<Q>“The Englishman,”</Q>
Oct. 22, 1713, Mr. Steele inserted a letter, giving notice that "The Crisis" was then ready for the press; and concluding in these words:
<Q>“The price of this discourse will be but one shilling; and persons who are willing to subscribe for numbers of them, are desired to leave their names and such numbers with Mr. Samuel Buckley, at the Dolphin in Little Britain. I beg the fa∣vour of you to insert this in your very next paper; for I shall govern myself in the number I print according to the number of subscriptions.”</Q>
After the subscription had con∣tinued open more than two months, "The Englishman;" Number 26, Dec. 26, acquainted the public, that,
<Q>“at the desire of several ladies of quality, the publication of "The Crisis" is put off till the female world have expressed their zeal for the publick, by a subscription as large as that made among the other sex.”</Q>
This pamphlet at length appeared on the 19th of January, 1714. In the revi∣sal and correction of it, he was assisted by Bishop Hoadly, Mr. Addison, Mr. Lechmere, and Mr. Minshall. — At the end of 1713, Mr. Steele began "The Lover;" and in 1714, "The Reader." In this year he appeared as editor of a vo∣lume of Miscellaneous Poems; and wrote
<Q>“The Romish Ecclesiastical History of late Years;”</Q>
and in 1715,
<Q>“An Account of the State of the Roman Catholic Religion throughout the World.”</Q>
In April that year, he was knighted by king George I; who had before appointed him surveyor of the royal stables at Hampton Court, and governor of the royal company of comedians. In the same year he collected several of his pieces into a volume, under the title of "Political Writings;" and published a paper called "The Town Talk;" in 1718,
<Q>“An Account of the Fish Pool;”</Q>
in 1719, "The Spinster," and
<Q>“A Letter to the Earl of Oxford concerning the Bill of Peerage:”</Q>
and, January 2, 1719-20, began "The Theatre;" a task which seems to have been soon laid aside. In the twenty-eighth number the Author observed, that this paper
<Q>“was not the product of a mind at ease, but written by a man neither out of pain in body or mind; yet forced to suspend the anguish of both with the addition of powerful men soli∣citing his ruin, shy looks from his acquaintance, surly be∣haviour from his domesticks, with all the train of public and private calamity.”</Q>
He took leave of the town with a promise of "printing a new comedy called Sir John Edgar;" and at the same time solicited support in a design by which might be divided "above ten <HI>per cent.</HI> six times a year." Sir Richard was smartly attacked for "The Theatre" by Mr. Dennis, when he had published six numbers, in a pamphlet called "The Characters and Conduct of Sir John Edgar," the name he had assumed in that publication. (This latter paper, "The Town Talk," and "The Spinster," have not yet been collected into volumes.)—On the 23d of that month, his parent of governor of the royal comedians was revoked; on which he printed a state of the case between the lord chamberlain and himself, computing his loss at almost 10,000 l. He published "The Crisis of Property," Jan. 31, 1719-20; and,
<Q>“A Nation a Family; being the Se∣quel of "The Crisis of Property;" or a Plan for the Im∣provement of the South-Sea Proposal,” Feb. 24.</Q>
—
<Q>“The Conscious Lovers” was acted with great success in 1722; and the king, to whom it was dedicated, gave him 500 l.</Q>
Some years before his death, he grew paralytic, and retired to his seat at Llangunner near Caermarthen in Wales; where he died, September 1, 1729. He had been twice married; and his great esteem for his second lady is testified in a dedication to "The Ladies Library."—It appears by his "Reader," May 3, 1714, that he had materials for a History of the war in Flanders; which he proposed to print in folio, but did not execute. These papers afterwards came into the hands of Mr. Mallet; to whom 500 l. was bequeathed by the dutchess of Marlborough, to write the life of her deceased lord. It was intended by the dutchess to have been performed jointly by Mr. Glover and Mr. Mallet, under the immediate inspection of lord Chesterfield: but Mr. Glover resigned the undertaking; and although it is probable that his colleague had the papers directed by the dutchess de∣livered to him, and it is certain was several years employed about the work (which, he informed the duke of Marlborough in a dedication to his poems, 1762, was so far executed, that he hoped <HI>soon</HI> to present it to him); yet it is said, at the time of Mr. Mallet's death, in April, 1765, he had made but small progress in it.—Sir Richard was one of the last eminent men who entertained hopes of being successful in the pursuit of the Philosopher's Stone; a circumstance alluded to in the following couplet of "The British Censor," a satire leveled at Steele, in 1712:
<Q><L>"A Chemist now, whose vain projection broke,</L>
<L>"Was not his sense in part dissolv'd in smoke?"</L></Q>
His Laboratory was at Poplar, a village near London; and is now converted into a garden-house.—See an excellent poe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ical character of Mr. Steele, in vol. III. p. 77. N.</NOTE>. 1695.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>TO MR. CONGREVE <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To this gentleman Mr. Steele thus inscribed his volume of "Miscellaneous Poems:" "My name, as publisher of the following miscellanies, I am sensible, is but a slight recom∣mendation of them to the publick; but the town's opinion of them will be raised, when it sees them addressed to Mr. Congreve. If the patron is but known to have a castle for what is presented to him, it gives an hopeful idea of the woark; how much more, when he is an acknowledged master of the art he is desired to favour? Your just success in the va∣rious parts of poetry, will make your approbation of the fol∣lowing sheets a favour to many ingenious gentlemen, whose modesty wants the sanction of such an authority. Men of your talents oblige the world, when they are studious to pro∣duce in others the similitude of their excellences. Your great discerning in distinguishing the characters of mankind, which is manifested in your comedies, renders your good opinion a just foundation for the esteem of other men. I know, indeed, no argument against these collections, in comparison of any other Tonson has heretofore printed; but that there are in it no verses of yours▪ that gentle, free, and easy faculty, which also in songs, and short poems, you possess above all others, distinguishes itself where-ever it appears. I cannot but in∣stance your inimitable DORIS, which excels, for politeness, fine raillery, and courtly satire, any thing we can meet with in any language. Give me leave to tell you, that when I consider your capacity this way, I cannot enough applaud the goodness of your mind, that has given so few examples of these severities, under the temptation of so great applause as the ill-natured world bestows on them, though addressed without any mixture of your delicacy. I cannot leave my favourite Doris, without taking notice how much that short performance discovers a true knowledge of life. Doris is the character of a libertine woman of condition, and the satire is worked up accordingly: for people of quality are seldom touched with any representation of their vices, but in a light which makes them ridiculous. As much as I esteem you for your excellent writings, by which you are an honour to our nation: I chuse rather, as one that has passed many happy hours with you, to celebrate that easy condescension of mind, and command of a pleasant imagination, which give you the uncommon praise of a man of wit, always to please, and never to offend. No one, after a joyful evening, can reflect upon an expression of Mr. Congreve's, that dwells upon him with pain. In a man capable of exerting himself any way, this (whatever the vain and ill-natured may think of the matter) is an excellence above the brightest sallies of ima∣gination. The reflection upon this most equal, amiable, and correct behaviour, which can be observed only by your inti∣mate acquaintance, has quite diverted me from acknow∣ledging your several excellences as a writer; but to dwell particularly on those subjects, would have no very good effect upon the following performances of myself and friends: thus, I confess to you, your modesty is spared only by my vanity, and yet I hope you will give me leave to indulge it yet further, in telling all the world, I am, with great truth, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant,

<HEAD>EPIGRAM FROM MARTIAL <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With all persons who have made good sense the rule of action, marriage is described as the state capable of the highest human felicity. Tully has epistles full of affectionate plea∣sure, when he writes to his wife, or speaks of his children. But above all the hints of this kind I have met with in writers of ancient date, I am pleased with an epigram of Martial, in honour of the beauty of his wife Cleopatra. Commentators say, it was written the day after his wedding-night. When his spouse was retired to the bathing-room in the heat of the day, he, it seems, came in upon her when she was just going into the water. To her beauty and carriage on that occasion we owe this epigram. STEELE.—See in The Spectator, No. 490, some excellent remarks on this subject. N.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

In consideration that one knows not how far what we have said of each other may affect our character in the world; I take it for an act of honour to declare, on my part, that I have not known a greater mortification than when I have reflected upon the severities which have flowed from a pen, which is now you see disposed as much to celebrate and commend you. On your part, your sincere endeavour to pro∣mote the reputation and success of this Tragedy, are infallible testimonies of the candour and friendship you retain for me. I rejoice in this public retribution; and with pleasure acknow∣ledge that I find by experience that some useful notices, which I had the good fortune to give you for your conduct in former life with some hazard to myself, were not to be blotted out of your memory by any hardships that followed them.” — See the particulars of their disputes in Cibber's Life of Mrs. Manley, and in the “Supplement to Swift.” N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>ODE TO ST. CECILIA <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The twenty-second of November, a day appropriated by the calendar of the church of Rome to Saint Cecilia, was re∣ligiously observed in most parts of Europe. This lady was eminently beautiful and pious, particularly skilful in music, and a martyr for the Christian faith. Towards the latter end of the last century an entertainment was instituted in commemoration of her, by many of the first rank in this kingdom; which was continued annually for a considerable time. A splendid entertainment was provided at Stationers Hall, which was constantly pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceded by a performance of vocal and instrumental music by the most capital performers. This feast is represented by Mr. Motteux, in 1691, as
<Q>“one of the genteelest in the world; there are no formalities nor gatherings like as at others, and the appearance there is splendid.”</Q>
The words, which were always an encomium on their patroness, were set by Purcell, Blow, and others of the greatest eminence; and it became the fashion for writers of all ranks to celebrate Saint Cecilia. Dryden, Pope, Addison, Yalden, employed their talents on this subject. We have also Odes to Saint Cecilia by Shadwell, D'Urfey, and some still more indifferent poets. But we may pardon the trash which this fertile subject has given birth to, on account of the excellence of Mr. Dryden's most admirable perform∣ance. It appears by Mr. Motteux that there were, in 1691, "admirable concerts in Charles-street and York-buildings." N.</NOTE>,</HEAD>

<HEAD>HORACE, BOOK I. ODE IX.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>IMITATED BY MR. FENTON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Elijah Fenton, descended from an antient family, and born at Shelton, near Newcastle under Line, in Staffordshire, being the youngest of twelve children, was intended by his parents for the ministry. He was sent to the university of Cambridge, where he embraced principles very opposite to the government, by which he became disqualified for entering into holy orders. After quitting the university, he was for some time usher to Mr. Bonwicke, a celebrated school-master at Headley in Surrey; and afterwards became secretary to the earl of Orrery: but how long he remained in that station, we cannot ascertain. After he quitted the service of this noble peer, it was his custom to pay a yearly visit in the country to his brother, who possessed an estate of 1000l. per annum. He was a man of great tenderness and humanity, and carried the fairest reputation. After a life at the close of it spent in ease and tranquillity, he died at East-Hampstead-Park, near Oakingham, on the 13th of July, 1730, much regretted by all men of taste, as, what is very singular, having never been obnoxious to the re∣sentment of his brother-poets. He published in 1709 the volume whence this and the following poems of his are taken, under the title of "Oxford and Cambridge Verses," printed for Lin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ott, without a date. In 1717 he published a volume of his own poems, and in 1723 introduced upon the stage his tragedy of Mariamne, built upon the story related of her in the third volume of The Spectator, which the ingenious author collected out of Josephus. He published also a very fine edition of the works of Mr. Edmund Waller, illustrated with full and useful notes of his own; and wrote a Life of Milton, which Dr. Johnson very handsomely commends. Mr. Fenton was much beloved and esteemed by Mr. Pope, who honoured him with an epitaph. The "Oxford and Cambridge Verses" were thus inscribed to Lionel earl of Dorset and Middlesex:</P>
<P>"My Lord, I hope, on your return from having been ad∣mired in foreign Courts to adorn our own, you will not be surprized with a privilege the Poets assume, of being trouble∣some to persons of your rank. But they have more particu∣larly applied themselves to your Lordship's family; in which a continued race of Genius has both advanced their art, and encouraged its professors. We owe the rise of our English Tragedy to one of your Lordship's ancestors, who fixed us second to the Greek stage before Shakespeare wrote. And, my Lord, your father came the nearest of all the moderns to Horace, in the sweetness and gallantry of his Lyricks, and equalled him in Satire. Thus the stream flows pure in its descent, to receive a farther increase from your Lordship. We read of a Scipio and a Maecenas, who used to soften the trou∣blesome honours of state by conversing with the Muses; and cherished those arts of which they themselves were masters: yet as single instances of this kind are not frequent, so the vein is very seldom found to have continued a second genera∣tion. But, in your Lordship's line, Nature seems industrious to preserve the genius of Poetry, by successively uniting deli∣cacy of taste, and brightness of wit, with the greatest abili∣ties for council and action. Thus she reconciles the Seasons in her most generous productions, by allowing them to bear Fruit and Blossoms together, and both in perfection. These shining qualities made your Father the delight and wonder of his age; and had he not survived himself in your Lordship, he had been the envy of ours. The praises which he received from the most refined Wits of our nation have proved real prophecies of you; and it is with pleasure we foresee that posterity, to deserve the highest characters, will form themselves on the model of your family, and copy from my Lords of Dorset as the finest originals. But, my Lord, I am afraid I shall forfeit all hopes of your patronage, by violating your modesty; and therefore I only beg leave to add, that as the Cabinet and the Field have been happily supplied, to render her Majesty's reign, at least, a rival to her Virgin-predecessor's; so, to complete the parallel, it was necessary that you, my Lord, like another Sidney, should arise, to receive the softer arts into your protection; to excite the young Writers of this age to attempt those actions in verse, which will shine so fairly distinguished in our British story. My Lord, I am Your Lordship's most humble, and most obedient servant,</P>

<HEAD>THE WRECK. A SATIRE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JAMES GARDINER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Dr. James Gardiner, Bp. of Lincoln; born at Westminster in 1678, and admitted of Immanuel College, Cambridge, in 1694; where having taken the degree of B. A. he removed to Jesus College, obtained a fellowship, and pro∣ceeded M. A. During his residence at the University, he was assiduous in study, and acquired, by repeated perusal of the classics, a turn to poetry. His translation of
<Q>“Rapin of Gardens”</Q>
was published in 1704, as a farewell to the Muses, upon his entering into holy orders, and accepting of the sub∣deanry of London, in 1705. A second edition of this tran∣slation was printed in 1717, with alterations which reflect much credit on Mr. Gardiner's judgement. This is the sub∣stance of what I can meet with of this ingenious poet's his∣tory. Jacob has preserved the three following stanzas tran∣scribed from the middle of an epitaph on this writer's father:

<L>THE welcome sun, with long-expected light,</L>
<L>At length arising, chac'd away the night,</L>
<L>Yet could not, with the shades, remove my fears,</L>
<L>Dissolve my grief, and dissipate my cares;</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="59"/>Remembrance of past dangers fill'd my breast</L>
<L>With anxious terrors, and denied me rest:</L>
<L>Coy sleep refus'd, though courted much, to close</L>
<L>My wearied eye-lids; so from bed I rose;</L>
<L>And, having thanks to the kind owner paid,</L>
<L>I left the fisher's hospitable shed,</L>
<L>Whose generous mind a needful succour gave,</L>
<L>Snatch'd me from death and from a watery grave.</L>
<L>Then walk'd I pensive on the rocky shore,</L>
<L>The angry waves had ceas'd their horrid roar;</L>
<L>Each mountain-billow shrunk its towering head,</L>
<L>And peaceful slept upon its oozy bed;</L>
<L>The winds had spent their breath, and to their caves were fled.</L>
<L>Yet, as the new-calm'd ocean grew serene,</L>
<L>On its smooth plain appear'd a dismal scene:</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="60"/>Distinctly now my wandering eyes beheld,</L>
<L>With our late wreck, the tragic surface fill'd;</L>
<L>Mix'd with the keel, in rude confusion lies</L>

<L>Prodigious planks, the painted vessel's pride,</L>
<L>Torn by the tempest from her wounded side,</L>
<L>Are borne along the triumph of the tide:</L>
<L>While all her cargo, a defenceless prey,</L>
<L>To ravenous sharks and mews unguarded lay.</L>

<L>One only friend I had, whose constant mind</L>
<L>Was to my soul by sacred friendship join'd;</L>
<L>Our hearts united were so much the same,</L>

<L>Breathless and pale the bloated carcass lies</L>
<L>To unrelenting death a sacrifice;</L>
<L>While thou, my darling Castor, thus must die,</L>

<L>For friendship sure, of all terrestrial bliss,</L>
<L>Suits best with man's divinest faculties.</L>
<L>But see, a fatal accident destroys</L>
<L>Those schemes of bliss, and blasts the blooming joys.</L>

<HEAD>THE INDIFFERENT. A SONG. TO THE TUNE OF LALERIDA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE EARL OF ORRERY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles, the well-known opponent of Bentley in the con∣troversy on Phalaris's Epistles, and the inventor of the ma∣chine which bears his name, who succeeded to the earldom of Orrery on his brother Lionel's death in 1703. In the above∣mentioned controversy he was supposed to have had the as∣sistance of the wits of Christ Church, Atterbury, Smallridge, &amp;c. which Swift, in his Battle of the Books, styles
<Q>“a suit of armour given him by all the Gods.”</Q>
This, however, his son well observes,
<Q>“the Gods never bestowed but upon their favourites,”</Q>
an Achilles or an Aeneas: Life of Swift, Let. xxiii. Some Cambridge wags, on this occasion, made a truly classical pun, exhibiting, in a print, Phalaris's guards thrust∣ing Bentley into the tyrant's brazen-bull, and this label is∣suing from the Doctor's mouth
<Q>“I had rather be <HI>roasted</HI> than <HI>boyled</HI>.”</Q>
His Lordship also wrote a copy of verses on The Dispensary, a Prologue to one of Southern's plays, and a Comedy called "As You find it," whose only fault, Budgell says, is, it had too much wit in it. He died Aug. 28, 1731. The late elegant translator of Pliny was his son. D.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<P>The Princess Mary, Henry the Eighth's younger sister, being in love with the Duke of Suffolk, was, for public reasons, married to Lewis the Twelfth of France, who died in six months after. The Queen, being again at liberty, writes the following Epistle to the Duke of Suffolk, her first lover.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<L>LET these soft lines my kindest thoughts convey,</L>
<L>And tell thee what I suffer by thy stay.</L>
<L>Did seas divide us, this might well excuse</L>
<L>Thy negligence, and my fond heart abuse.</L>
<L>But Calais from the Kentish strand is seen;</L>
<L>A gentle current only rolls between.</L>

<L>But thou art chang'd — that ardor is expir'd,</L>
<L>Which once thy wishes with impatience fir'd;</L>
<L>When Savoy's blooming dutchess strove in vain</L>

<L>The haughty princess, with her brother, came</L>

<L>Whatever Flattery, Love, or wanton Art,</L>
<L>Could do, she practis'd to seduce thy heart.</L>
<L>Great Anthony, by such allurements gain'd,</L>
<L>For Cleopatra all his glory stain'd:</L>
<L>But thy firm faith no injury receiv'd;</L>
<L>For you still lov'd, or I was well deceiv'd:</L>
<L>Nor were my virgin vows less true to thee,</L>

<L>The charms of proffer'd empire I resign'd;</L>

<L>My thoughts the pageantry of power disdain'd.</L>
<L>But, ah! what changes human joys attend!</L>
<L>On fickle turns our brightest hopes depend.</L>
<L>Victorious Henry's arms still meet success;</L>
<L>The vanquish'd Gauls at last propose a peace.</L>
<L>By Wolsey's policy their terms succeed;</L>
<L>The long contending nations are agreed;</L>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF CIPPUS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Ovid, Met. XV. And see Valerius Maximus. N</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE SAME WRITER.</BYLINE>
<L>AS Cippus in the trembling stream survey'd</L>
<L>The shooting horns that shade his conquering head,</L>
<L>His temples first he feels, and with surprize</L>
<L>His touch confirms the censure of his eyes.</L>
<L>Straight to the skies his horned front he rears,</L>

<L>"If this portent be prosperous, O decree</L>

<L>Then cry'd, "Hail, Conqueror! thy call obey,</L>
<L>Those omens I behold presage thy sway.</L>
<L>Rome waits thy nod, unwilling to be free,</L>

<L>He said; and Cippus, starting at th' event,</L>
<L>Spoke in these words his pious discontent:</L>
<L>"Far hence, ye Gods, this execration send;</L>
<L>And the great race of Romulus defend.</L>
<L>Better that I in exile live abhorr'd,</L>

<L><PB N="85" REF="88"/>This spoke, he hides with leaves his omen'd head,</L>
<L>Then prays, the Senate next convenes, and said:</L>
<L>"If Augurs can foresee, a wretch is come,</L>
<L>Design'd by Destiny the bane of Rome.</L>
<L>Two horns he has: if e'er within the town,</L>
<L>Your liberty and Latian laws are gone.</L>
<L>Your gates he might have enter'd; but this arm</L>

<L>Haste, find the monster out, and let him be</L>
<L>Condemn'd to all the Senate can decree;</L>
<L>Or ty'd in chains, or into exile thrown;</L>
<L>Or by the tyrant's death prevent your own."</L>
<L>The crowd such murmurs utter as they stand,</L>
<L>As swelling surges breaking on the strand:</L>
<L>Or as when gathering gales sweep o'er some grove,</L>
<L>And their tall heads the bending cedars move.</L>
<L>Each with confusion gaz'd, and then began</L>
<L>To feel his fellow's brows, and find the man.</L>
<L>Cippus then shakes his garland off, and cries,</L>
<L>"The wretch you want, I offer to your eyes."</L>

<HEAD>ST. JULIAN'S PRAYER. IMITATED FROM LA FONTAINE. ANONYMOUS; FROM STEELE'S COLLECTION.</HEAD>
<L>WHILST on their wings the gentle Zephyrs bear</L>
<L>The youthful season of the blooming year;</L>
<L>While the bright sun attends on nature's birth,</L>
<L>And with a warmer kiss salutes the earth;</L>
<L>While Venus o'er the whole creation reigns,</L>
<L>And Cupid revels on the flowery plains;</L>
<L>Pregnant with sweets, while fanning breezes move,</L>
<L>Saluting as they pass the citron-grove,</L>
<L>And universal Nature glows with Love;</L>
<L>I feel my blood and spirits swifter glide,</L>
<L>And fancy flowing in a fuller tide.</L>
<L>Alone, I now some tale of Love rehearse;</L>
<L>Or, if I slumber, still I dream of Verse.</L>
<L>Celestial Muse! if 'tis from thee my breast</L>
<L>I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the love of Poetry possest;</L>
<L>Raise thy young Poet from the vulgar throng,</L>
<L>Sustain his flight, and animate his song:</L>
<L>Far from my thoughts all other cares remove,</L>
<L>But only those of Poetry and Love.</L>
<L>Be this an earnest of my future praise,</L>
<L>An omen thou wilt bless my growing bays;</L>
<L>Confirm the youthful bard, who trembling fears</L>
<L>To bear a weight unequal to his years.</L>
<L>Shew, that it is from thee my heart o'erflows,</L>
<L>While Fancy paints the subject Judgement chose.</L>
<L><PB N="102" REF="105"/>In fair Milan there dwelt, of mighty fame,</L>
<L>A noble Knight, and Tancred was his name;</L>
<L>Famous he was in many a bloody fight,</L>
<L>But most in courtly arts was his delight:</L>
<L>Those softer combats, and more pleasing wars,</L>
<L>Which broke no bones, nor seam'd the face with scars.</L>
<L>Ne'er did our Knight of any She complain,</L>
<L>That much he lov'd, and was not lov'd again.</L>
<L>Envy'd by all, and happy was the dame,</L>
<L>Who was the object of brave Tancred's flame:</L>
<L>Vers'd in the arts of Love, full well he knew</L>
<L>When to retire, and when again pursue.</L>
<L>Thus skill'd the tender moment to improve,</L>
<L>Success still waited on his roving Love.</L>
<L>Long had our Warrior thus victorious reign'd;</L>
<L>A nymph, by him besieg'd, was surely gain'd,</L>
<L>But in Milan there grew not palms enow;</L>
<L>With other garlands he would deck his b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow;</L>
<L>Be Lord of all, and own'd without dispute,</L>
<L>Through all the realms of Cupid absolute.</L>
<L>Thus Philip's son, of Persia's crown possest▪</L>
<L>And with the spoils of conquer'd nations blest,</L>
<L>No limits in his wild ambition knew;</L>
<L>And wanted worlds to make his triumphs new.</L>
<L>Let other Poets, in a lofty strain,</L>
<L>Describe their Hero on the dusty plain;</L>
<L>Make Mars his helmet bear, his fauchion wield,</L>
<L>And paint Minerva on his ample shield;</L>
<L>Shew him impatient, smit with glory's charms,</L>
<L>Courteous in peace, invincible in arms;</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="106"/>In thickest dangers all serene and calm,</L>
<L>And bring down Victory to wreath his brows with palm.</L>
<L>But naked Love the sword of Mars defies;</L>
<L>Venus has keener weapons in her eyes.</L>
<L>Unarm'd our Knight, nor arms were his intent,</L>
<L>His amorous course to Pavia's city bent;</L>
<L>Pavia, the place which Venus honours most,</L>
<L>Next her own Paphos and the Cyprian coast.</L>
<L>There live the Graces, thither flock the Fair;</L>
<L>Her chariot, doves, and all her train, were there.</L>
<L>The Legend says, the Knight with constant care,</L>
<L>Ne'er fail'd to say each morn a magic prayer;</L>
<L>And then he ne'er had cause of just complaint,</L>
<L>By Julian kept, his tutelary Saint:</L>
<L>Less powerful charms, the story goes, than these,</L>
<L>Could alter Nature in her fixt decrees.</L>
<L>With such of old were midnight Witches known</L>
<L>Down from her sphere to draw the labouring Moon.</L>
<L>'Twas said, its virtues too prevail'd in Love;</L>
<L>But that mean art did Tancred never prove:</L>
<L>Much more avails in Love a youthful grace,</L>
<L>And the soft magic of a charming face;</L>
<L>The Knight relied on this, the prayer once said,</L>
<L>He ne'er should want a supper, nor a bed.</L>
<L>Bright Phoebus now his measur'd course had run;</L>
<L>The day was ended, and the night begun:</L>
<L>Close by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad an ancient forest stood,</L>
<L>Fenc'd from the light, and thick o'erspread with wood.</L>
<L>By noon-day robbers a retreat 'twas made;</L>
<L>And safe they lurk'd beneath the gloomy shade.</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="107"/>Thoughtless of danger, Tancred urg'd his way;</L>
<L>Out rush the gang, and seize the destin'd prey.</L>
<L>Horse, money, cloaths, and all, the villains take,</L>
<L>Regain the forest, and the Knight forsake.</L>
<L>Naked, distress'd, despairing, and alone,</L>
<L>On the cold earth he hopeless laid him down.</L>
<L>Pavia was distant far; the lowering sky</L>
<L>And gusts of wind proclaim'd a tempest nigh.</L>
<L>No star appear'd, to guide the wandering Knight;</L>
<L>In vain he look'd; no chearful beam of light</L>
<L>Shot through the pitchy darkness of the night.</L>
<L>Amidst the wood an ancient tree arose,</L>
<L>Extending far its hospitable boughs;</L>
<L>Tancred that night his lodging there design'd,</L>
<L>As some small shelter from the cutting wind.</L>
<L>But still from fate more torments he must prove,</L>
<L>The whistling winds still shook the bending grove,</L>
<L>And rain pour'd down, in streams, from angry Jove.</L>
<L>At length by happy chance the Knight perceives</L>
<L>A trembling beam dart through the waving leaves;</L>
<L>With joy transported he pursues the light,</L>
<L>While forward still the friendly rays invite.</L>
<L>About half way 'tween Pavia and the wood,</L>
<L>Among the fields an ancient villa stood.</L>
<L>Thence, from the light within, proceeds the ray,</L>
<L>Which with an happy omen marks his way.</L>
<L>Within the house a lady, once a wife,</L>
<L>Liv'd at her ease, and made the most of life:</L>
<L>Indulgent fate had broke the marriage noose,</L>
<L>Untied the knot, and set the fair-one loose.</L>
<L><PB N="105" REF="108"/>Long did she weep her poor departed dear,</L>
<L>Paid him a husband's tribute — to a tear.</L>
<L>But, when the widow's cloudy days blew o'er,</L>
<L>She wip'd her radiant eyes; would cry no more;</L>
<L>Grew chearful, airy; and then thought, at last,</L>
<L>How best she might repay her sorrows past:</L>
<L>Propos'd again that Hymen's known delights</L>
<L>Should make amends for all her lonely nights.</L>
<L>But to be tied for better and for worse;</L>
<L>She lik'd the blessing, but she fear'd the curse:</L>
<L>Far then she'd be from matrimonial care,</L>
<L>Be mistress of herself, and free as air.</L>
<L>At last, in short, a Love-intrigue presents;</L>
<L>And that, she thought, might answer all intents:</L>
<L>Determin'd thus, she ventures on the game,</L>
<L>And every night the lusty Lover came.</L>
<L>It happen'd that same night, as Tancred lay</L>
<L>Wringing his cloaths, and longing for the day;</L>
<L>The loving nymph within expecting sate,</L>
<L>And wondered why her Lover staid so late.</L>
<L>Nought there, but he, was wanting: for the Fair</L>
<L>Had order'd all things with a Lover's care.</L>
<L>There Ceres, Bacchus, and the Graces came,</L>
<L>The gay attendants on the Cyprian dame.</L>
<L>Ragouts and jellies overspread the board,</L>
<L>And all the wines which Autumn could afford:</L>
<L>Th' expecting Nymph, with sighs and heaving breast,</L>
<L>Female impatience, female love exprest.</L>
<L>At length a trusty page brings word, that night</L>
<L>Her Lover was (though loth) debarr'd her sight;</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="109"/>Some urgent business, what he did not say,</L>
<L>Forc'd him, against his will, to keep away.</L>
<L>Be this the Lover's loss, 'twas Tancred's gain.</L>
<L>A maid within, who heard the Knight complain,</L>
<L>Mov'd with his weakly voice and shuddering tone,</L>
<L>Looks out, and asks what creature made that moan.</L>
<L>Tancred could hardly see the taper's light,</L>
<L>So much the beating rain had dimm'd his sight:</L>
<L>Pierc'd through with cold, and frozen are his limbs,</L>
<L>Yet even thus he charms, and lovely seems.</L>
<L>He tells his quality, and begs relief;</L>
<L>His graceful carriage gains a quick belief.</L>
<L>She tells her mistress all she heard, and more,</L>
<L>And shows her Tancred shivering at the door.</L>
<L>The Fair had often heard of Tancred's name;</L>
<L>Rude must they be, who knew not Tancred's fame.</L>
<L>The sight her yielding heart to pity mov'd;</L>
<L>She brought him in, and knew not that she lov'd.</L>
<L>Fresh cloaths were fetch'd; the stranger, warm and drest▪</L>
<L>In courtly phrase his gratitude exprest.</L>
<L>They sit, they chat; the nymph was not reserv'd;</L>
<L>The wine is brought, and the rich banquet serv'd.</L>
<L>Tancred was keen; the labours of the night</L>
<L>Had thinn'd his blood, and whet his appetite.</L>
<L>Hunger th' attentive widow could not move;</L>
<L>She long'd for Tancred, and she fed on Love.</L>
<L>Pensive she sat, and on the comely Knight,</L>
<L>Unmov'd with other objects, fix'd her sight.</L>
<L>Love, unattended with its anxious pains,</L>
<L>Plays round her heart, and dances in her veins.</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="110"/>The supper ended, and the servants gone,</L>
<L>And the kind longing couple left alone;</L>
<L>A parly soon began. Brave Tancred's heart</L>
<L>Was struck quite through with Cupid's golden dart.</L>
<L>Love chose the shaft, and look'd his quiver o'er</L>
<L>To find a match for that had struck the Nymph before.</L>
<L>Lovers imagine what most hidden lies,</L>
<L>See with their fancy what's denied their eyes.</L>
<L>Nothing could Tancred's eager sight escape,</L>
<L>Her winning carriage, and her easy shape;</L>
<L>The foot, the well-turn'd leg, the taper thigh,</L>
<L>Were soon examin'd by his knowing eye;</L>
<L>Her hand, her arm, her neck, he ran all o'er,</L>
<L>Besides a thousand nameless graces more.</L>
<L>Nameless be they—nor will the Muses name</L>
<L>What kindles in their cheeks a guilty flame.</L>
<L>Thus much suffice, nor more shall be exprest,</L>
<L>I leave the bashful maid to guess the rest.</L>
<L>In decent garb she sat, and plain attire,</L>
<L>The Loves flew all around, and kindled soft desire.</L>
<L>With native charms and careless art array'd,</L>
<L>Ten thousand Graces in her beauties play'd:</L>
<L>Could I her look, and negligence of dress,</L>
<L>In living verse with studied art express,</L>
<L>The Loves would think their Mother I had seen,</L>
<L>And for the Nymph describ'd th' Idalian Queen.</L>
<L>But, if the Knight was wounded by her eyes,</L>
<L>She saw brave Tancred with no less surprize.</L>
<L>His mien, his comely port, and manly grace,</L>
<L>And youthful bloom, which flush'd the Lover's face,</L>
<L><PB N="108" REF="111"/>She long admiring <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, with down-cast look;</L>
<L>At length the man belov'd she thus bespoke:</L>
<L>"How happily, alas, do you renew</L>
<L>The thought of one so much resembled you!</L>
<L>Through all his features not one pleasing line,</L>
<L>But does in yours with equal beauty shine.</L>
<L>Such graces had propitious Venus shed</L>
<L>Around the dearest partner of my bed.</L>
<L>In you his every action I can trace,</L>
<L>And when I look on you, I see his face!"</L>
<L>Tell me, ye learn'd, and say, ye mighty wise,</L>
<L>What stoick apathy, what Cato, could despise</L>
<L>A fair-one's praises? whom could Love displease,</L>
<L>When urg'd by such endearing charms as these!</L>
<L>Fir'd with the praise, his cheeks with blushes glow'd,</L>
<L>Then answer'd thus; and as he spoke, he bow'd:</L>
<L>"Such mighty glory is not Tancred's due;</L>
<L>But, fairest creature, what resembles you?</L>
<L>The sun, when shining with meridian light,</L>
<L>Shews not one object so divinely bright."</L>
<L>The Nymph here stopt him, and with dextrous art</L>
<L>Seem'd to dislike what pleas'd her to the heart.</L>
<L>From beauty's favourite title she 'd recede,</L>
<L>That for her beauty he might stronger plead:</L>
<L>Asserted most, what most she 'd have deny'd,</L>
<L>And by humility she gratified her pride.</L>
<L>So when fair Iris, in the clouds of night,</L>
<L>Avoids th' embraces of the God of Light;</L>
<L>With doubled rays he darts upon the skies,</L>
<L>Seeks out the Nymph, and paints her as she flies.</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="112"/>Tancred continues, praises o'er again</L>
<L>All that he has, and all he has not seen;</L>
<L>But which full willingly the Squire would see,</L>
<L>Were but the fair-one half so bold as he.</L>
<L>"To praise, said he, your beauty as I ought,</L>
<L>Exceeds the power of language, and of thought.</L>
<L>To speak an object so divinely bright,</L>
<L>Would ask an age, and I have but a night;</L>
<L>Which, with your leave, might better be employ'd:"</L>
<L>The fair-one smil'd; and Tancred, overjoy'd,</L>
<L>Left compliment; provoking is delay</L>
<L>In a kind couple, when alone, as they.</L>
<L>He manag'd Love as Generals do War,</L>
<L>Took each advantage, and with hasty care</L>
<L>Urg'd-on the tender moment with the Fair.</L>
<L>Artful resistance, just enough, was made,</L>
<L>Till pleasure to its crisis was delay'd.</L>
<L>The Lady seem'd obsequious to the call,</L>
<L>And answer'd nothing—that was saying all!</L>
<L>Yielding, but coy, as seemingly she strove</L>
<L>To give Compulsion what she gave to Love.</L>
<L>Young and unskill'd, O that I could proceed</L>
<L>To tell of all the amorous Tancred's deed:</L>
<L>Him through Love's groves and labyrinths pursue,</L>
<L>And keep the ardent Lover still in view!</L>
<L>Round Tancred's neck her snowy arms she cast,</L>
<L>And paid with kisses all his labours past;</L>
<L>This for the thieves, and forty for the fright,</L>
<L>And this, and this, repay the stormy night.</L>
<L>Happiest of happy Lovers! O that I</L>
<L>Such precious favours from my Fair could buy!</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="113"/>The greatest dangers I should ne'er regard,</L>
<L>Nor sufferings feel, which she would so reward.</L>
<L>'Twas late; the whole creation silent lay,</L>
<L>And slumbers drown'd the labours of the day:</L>
<L>No noise was heard, all nature seem'd to nod,</L>
<L>And own the empire of the Sleepy God.</L>
<L>Ev'n Envy slumber'd, and old Morpheus shed</L>
<L>His drowsy poppies full on Tancred's head.</L>
<L>The Fair departed to her bed of down;</L>
<L>And by the legend it is plainly shown,</L>
<L>That happy Tancred did not lie alone.</L>
<L>How much delight they took, how little rest,</L>
<L>How the fond Lovers all their fire exprest,</L>
<L>I pass—Nymphs, conscious of a Lover's flame,</L>
<L>Will in their minds the soft idea frame.</L>
<L>And should I vainly now proceed to tell</L>
<L>The plenty of their Loves; I might as well</L>
<L>Count all the roses which the Zephyrs bring,</L>
<L>Or number up the lilies of the Spring.</L>
<L>But now Aurora, harbinger of day,</L>
<L>Rose from the bed where aged Tithon lay;</L>
<L>Unbarr'd the doors of Heaven, and overspread</L>
<L>The path of Phoebus with a blushing red.</L>
<L>Up rose the Lovers; and th' obliging Fair</L>
<L>Continued still to Tancred all her care:</L>
<L>Him all her treasures and her gold she show'd,</L>
<L>And many presents on the Knight bestow'd:</L>

<HEAD>VERSES</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. EUSDEN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Lawrence Eusden, descended from a good family in Ireland, was educated at Trinity College in Cambridge; after which he went into holy orders; and was for some time chaplain to Richard Lord Willoughby de Broke. His first patron was the eminent Lord Halifax, whose poem
<Q>“On the Battle of the Boyne,”</Q>
Mr. Eusden translated into Latin. He was also esteemed by the Duke of Newcastle, on whose marriage with the honourable lady Henrietta Go∣dolphin he wrote an Epithalamium, for which, upon the death of Mr. Rowe, he was by his Grace (who was then lord chamberlain, and considered the verses as an elegant compliment) preferred in 1718 to the laureatship. He had several enemies; and among others, Mr. Pope, who put him into his Dunciad; though we do not know what provocation he gave to any of them, unless by being raised to the dignity of the laurel. Cooke, in his "Battle of the Poets," speaks that of him:
<Q><L>"Eusden, a laurel'd bard, by fortune rais'd,</L>
<L>"By few been read, by fewer still been prais'd," &amp;c.</L></Q>
And Oldmixon, in his "Art of Logic and Rhetoric," p. 413, is not sparing of his reflexions on the poet and his patron. His censures, however, are plainly those of a disappointed competitor. And perhaps great part of the ridicule, which has been thrown on Eusden, may arise from his succeeding so ingenious a poet as Mr. Rowe. That he was no inconsi∣derable versister, the specimens here selected will evince; and▪ as his moral character appears to have been respectable, his Grace acted a generous, art in providing for a man who had conferred an obligation on him. The first-rate poets were either of principles very different from the government, or thought themselves to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distinguished to undergo the drudgery of an annual Ode. Mr. Eusden, however, seems to have been but little known before his preferment, if we judge by the manner in which he is mentioned in the Duke of Buck∣ingham's "Session of the Poets:"
<Q><L>"In rushed Eusdem, and cried, who shall have it,</L>
<L>"But I the true laurent, to whom the King gave it?</L>
<L>"Apollo begg'd pardon, and granted his claim,</L>
<L>"But vow'd that till then he ne'er heard of his name."</L></Q>
He died at his restory at Coningsby, Lincolnshire, the 27th of September, 1730; and left behind him in MS. a translation of the Works of Tasso, with a Life of that Poet. His father, Dr. Eusden, was rector of Spotsworth in Yorkshire. N.</P>

<BYLINE>BY MR. EUSDEN.</BYLINE>
<L>IN the fam'd Cyprian isle a mountain stands,</L>
<L>That casts a shadow into distant lands.</L>
<L>In vain access by human feet is try'd,</L>
<L>Its lofty brow looks down with noble pride</L>
<L>On bounteous Nile through seven wide channels spread,</L>
<L>And sees old Proteus in his oozy bed.</L>
<L>Along its sides no hoary frosts presume</L>
<L>To blast the myrtle shrubs, or nip the bloom.</L>
<L>The winds with caution sweep the rising flowers,</L>
<L>While balmy dews descend, and vernal showers.</L>
<L>The ruling orbs no wintery horrors bring,</L>
<L>Fix'd in th' indulgence of eternal Spring.</L>
<L>Unfading sweets in purple scenes appear,</L>
<L>And genial breezes soften all the year.</L>
<L><PB N="144" REF="147"/>The nice, luxurious soul, uncloy'd, may rove,</L>
<L>From pleasures still to circling pleasures move,</L>
<L>For endless beauty kindles endless love.</L>
<L>The mountain, when the summit once you gain,</L>
<L>Falls by degrees, and sinks into a plain;</L>
<L>Where the pleas'd eye may flowery meads behold</L>
<L>Inclos'd with branching ore, and hedg'd with gold.</L>
<L>Or where large crops the generous glebe supplies,</L>
<L>And yellow harvests, unprovok'd, arise.</L>
<L>For, by mild Zephyrs fann'd, the teeming soil</L>
<L>Yields every grain, nor asks the peasant's toil.</L>
<L>These were the bribes, the price of heavenly charms,</L>
<L>These Cytherea won to Vulcan's arms.</L>
<L>For such a bliss he such a gift bestow'd,</L>
<L>The rich, th' immortal, labours of a God.</L>
<L>A sylvan scene, in solemn state display'd,</L>
<L>Flatters each feather'd warbler with a shade;</L>
<L>But here no bird its painted wings can move,</L>
<L>Unless elected by the Queen of Love.</L>

<L>She hears the songster, and approves the song.</L>
<L>The joyous victors hop from spray to spray;</L>
<L>The vanquish'd fly, with mournful notes, away.</L>
<L>Branches in branches twin'd compose the grove,</L>
<L>And shoot, and spread, and blossom into love.</L>
<L>The trembling palms their mutual vows repeat,</L>
<L>And bending poplars bending poplars meet.</L>
<L>The distant platanes seem to press more nigh,</L>
<L>And to the sighing alder alders sigh.</L>
<L>Blue heavens above them smile, and all below</L>
<L>Two murmuring streams in wild meanders flow.</L>

<L>And rosy Cupid was that boasted one.</L>
<L>He, uncontrol'd, through Heaven extends his sway,</L>

<L>Voluptuous Liberty, that knows no bound,</L>

<L>Boldness unfledg'd, and to stol'n raptures new,</L>
<L>Half trembling stands, and scarcely dares pursue;</L>
<L>Fears that delight, and anxious doubts of joy,</L>
<L>Which check our swelling hopes, but not destroy;</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="149"/>And short-breath'd vows, forgot as soon as made,</L>
<L>On airy pinions flutter through the glade:</L>
<L>Youth, with a haughty look and gay attire,</L>
<L>And rolling eyes, that glow with soft desire,</L>
<L>Shines forth exalted on a pompous seat,</L>
<L>While sullen cares and wither'd age retreat.</L>
<L>Now from afar the palace seems to blaze,</L>
<L>And hither would extend its golden rays;</L>

<L>To speak the artist, and the art divine.</L>
<L>Proud columns, towering high, support the frame,</L>
<L>That hewn from Hyacinthian quarries came.</L>
<L>The beams are emeralds, and yet scarce adorn</L>
<L>The ruby walls, on which themselves are borne.</L>
<L>The pavement, rich with veins of agate, lies;</L>

<L>Here spices in parte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res promiscuous blow,</L>

<L>There, cinnamon in rival sweets contends.</L>
<L>A rich perfume the ravish'd senses fills,</L>
<L>While from the weeping tree the balm distills.</L>
<L>At these delightful bowers arrives at last</L>
<L>The God of Love, a tedious journey past:</L>

<L>Or curls, or opens, the dishevel'd hair.</L>
<L>A third, industrious, with a nicer eye,</L>
<L>Instructs the ringlets in what form to lie:</L>
<L>Yet leaves some few, that, not so closely prest,</L>
<L>Sport in the wind, and wanton from the rest.</L>
<L>Sweet negligence! by artful study wrought,</L>
<L>A graceful error, and a lovely fault.</L>
<L>The judgement of the glass is here unknown,</L>
<L>Here mirrors are supply'd by every stone.</L>
<L>Where-e'er the Goddess turns, her image falls,</L>
<L>And a new Venus dances on the walls.</L>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF COWLEY, AND HIS BURIAL IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ROGER EARL OF ORRERY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Third son of the first or great Earl of Corke, an able ge∣neral, statesman, and writer, as appears by his conduct in Ire∣land (when lord Broghill) both in peace and war, under Charles I. Cromwell, and Charles II. for whom he secured that kingdom; and by his Plays, Poems, Treatise on the Art of War, State Letters, &amp;c. Of these works the first and the last were collected and published by his great-grandson John Earl of Orrery (and afterwards of Corke), in 1739 and 1742. He also wrote "Parthenissa," a Romance; poems on most of the Festivals of the Church; a poem on the Restoration; a political poem (of which Charles II. took a copy in MS.) called "A Dream;" &amp;c. &amp;c. It is observable that he com∣posed most of his pieces when confined by the gout; which made Mr. Dryden tell him, in a dedication, that,
<Q>“like the priestess of Apollo, he delivered his oracles always in tor∣ment,”</Q> and that
<Q>“the world was obliged to his misery for their delight.”</Q>
Charles II. for his services, created him Earl of Orrery in 1660, made him one of the Lords Justices of Ireland, President of Munster, and one of the Cabinet Council, and offered him the great seal upon the fall of the Earl of Clarendon, which his infirm health prevented his ac∣cepting. See Budgell's Memoirs of the Boyles, p. 112. He died Oct. 16, 1679. Jacob says,
<Q>“he published six plays in heroick verse; wherein true English courage is exactly de∣lineated, and morality and virtue truly illustrated.”</Q>
His grandson Charles the fourth Earl (of whom see p. 70), is well known by his controversy, when a commoner, with Dr. Bentley; as is his great-grandson John (above-mentioned) by his Translation of Pliny's Epistles, Life of Swift, Letters from Italy, &amp;c. —"By one or other of this family, says Dr. Johnson, almost every art has been encouraged or improved."

<L>OUR Wit, till Cowley did its lustre raise,</L>
<L>May be resembled to the first three days;</L>
<L>In which did shine only such streaks of light,</L>
<L>As serv'd but to distinguish day from night.</L>
<L><PB N="164" REF="167"/>But Wit breaks forth in all that he has done,</L>
<L>Like light, when 'twas united to the sun.</L>
<L>The Poets formerly did lie in wait,</L>
<L>To rifle those whom they would imitate;</L>
<L>We watch'd to rob all strangers when they writ,</L>
<L>And learn'd their language, but to steal their wit.</L>
<L>He from that need his country does redeem,</L>
<L>Since those who want may be supply'd from him;</L>
<L>And foreign nations now may borrow more</L>
<L>From Cowley, than we could from them before;</L>
<L>Who, though he condescended to admit</L>
<L>The Greeks and Romans for his guides in wit,</L>
<L>Yet he those ancient Poets does pursue</L>
<L>But as the Spaniards great Columbus do;</L>
<L><PB N="165" REF="168"/>He taught them first to the New World to steer,</L>
<L>But they possess all that is precious there.</L>
<L>When first his spring of Wit began to flow,</L>
<L>It rais'd in some wonder and sorrow too;</L>
<L>That God had so much wit and knowledge lent,</L>
<L>And that they were not in his praises spent.</L>
<L>But those who in his Davideis look,</L>
<L>Find they his blossoms for his fruit mistook.</L>
<L>In differing ages diffreent Muses shin'd;</L>
<L>His green did charm the sense, his ripe the mind.</L>
<L>Writing for Heaven, he was inspir'd from thence,</L>
<L>And from his theme deriv'd his influence.</L>
<L>The Scriptures will no more the wicked fright;</L>
<L>His Muse does make religion a delight.</L>
<L>Oh! how severely man is us'd by fate!</L>
<L>The covetous toil long for an estate;</L>
<L>And, having got more than their life can spend,</L>
<L>They may bequeath it to a son or friend:</L>
<L>But Learning (in which none can have a share,</L>
<L>Unless they climb to it by time and care);</L>
<L>Learning, the truest wealth a man can have,</L>
<L>Does with the body perish in the grave:</L>
<L>To tenements of clay it is confin'd,</L>
<L>Though 'tis the noblest purchase of the mind:</L>
<L>Oh! why can we thus leave our friend possess'd</L>
<L>Of all our acquisitions but the best <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This complaint, as hath been observed by Mr. Budgell, is extremely poetical and pathetic. N.</NOTE>!</L>
<L>Still, when we study Cowley, we lament,</L>
<L>That to the world he was no longer lent;</L>
<L><PB N="166" REF="169"/>Who like a lightning to our eyes was shown,</L>
<L>So bright he shin'd, and was so quickly gone:</L>
<L>Sure, he rejoic'd to see his flame expire,</L>
<L>Since he himself could not have rais'd it higher;</L>
<L>For, when wise Poets can no higher fly,</L>
<L>They would, like Saints, in their perfections die.</L>
<L>Though Beauty some affection in him bred,</L>
<L>Yet only sacred Learning he would wed;</L>
<L>By which th' illustrious offspring of his brain</L>
<L>Shall over Wit's great empire ever reign:</L>
<L>His works shall live, when pyramids of pride</L>
<L>Shrink to such ashes as they long did hide.</L>
<L>That sacrilegious fire (which did last year</L>
<L>Level those piles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The churches destroyed by the fire of 1666. N.</NOTE> which piety did rear)</L>
<L>Dreaded near that majestic church to fly,</L>
<L>Where English Kings and English Poets lie <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Abbey of Westminster. N.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>It at an aweful distance did expire;</L>
<L>Such power had sacred ashes o'er that fire;</L>
<L>Such, as it durst not near that structure come,</L>
<L>Which Fate had order'd to be Cowley's tomb:</L>
<L>And 'twill be still preserv'd, by being so,</L>
<L>From what the rage of future flames can do:</L>
<L>Material fire dares not that place infest</L>
<L>Where he, who had immortal flames, does rest.</L>
<L>There let his urn remain; for it was sit</L>
<L>Amongst our Kings to lay the King of Wit;</L>

<HEAD>MR. HARRISON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William Harrison es{que} a young gentleman high in es∣teem, and (as Swift expresses it)
<Q>“a little pretty fellow, with a great deal of wit, good sense, and good nature,”</Q>
and fellow of New College, Oxford, had no other income than forty pounds a year as tutor to one of the duke of Queensberry's sons. In this employment he fortunately attracted the favour of Dr. Swift, whose generous solicitations with Mr. St. John obtained for him the reputable employment of secretary to lord Raby, afterwards earl of Strafford, and then ambassador at The Hague. A letter of his whilst at Utrecht, dated Dec. 16, 1712, is printed in the Dean's Works; to which Dr. Birch has annexed some curious particulars of Mr. Harrison, who did not long enjoy his rising fortune. He was dispatched to London with the Barrier-treaty; and died Feb. 14, 1712-13. See the Journal to Stella, of that and the following day: where Dr. Swift laments his loss with the most unaffected sincerity. Mr. Tickell has mentioned him with respect, in his "Prospect of Peace," English Poets, vol. XXVI. p. 113; and Dr. Young, in the beautiful close of an "Epistle to Lord Lansdowne" (vol. LII. p. 185.) most pathetically bewails his loss. Dr. Birch, who has given a curious note on Mr. Har∣rison's Letter to Swift, has confounded him with <HI>Thomas</HI> Harrison, M. A. of Queen's College. The poems here print∣ed, with "Woodstock Park" in Dodsley's Collection, are all the poetical writings that are known of this excellent young man; who figured both as an humourist and a politi∣cian in the fifth volume of the Tatler, of which (under the patronage of Bolingbroke, Henley, and Swift) he was profes∣sedly the editor. See the "Supplement to Swift."—There was another <HI>William</HI> Harrison, author of

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. JOSEPH HAINES <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The time when this merry Comedian (usually called <HI>Count Haines)</HI> was born, is uncertain: but he received the ru∣diments of learning at the school of St. Martin's in the Fields, London, where he made such progress that he was the admi∣ration of all that knew him. His ready wit and facetious humour prevailed upon several gentlemen to send him to Queen's College, Oxford, where his learning, and infinite f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of humour, gained him the esteem and regard of Sir Jo∣seph Williamson, who, when he was made secretary of state, took Joe for his Latin secretary. But Haines had too little t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iturnity for an employment of that kind; for Sir Joseph <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> heard the sustance of his epistles to foreign courts, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they could come to the hands of those persons who were to receive them. Upon this account, Joe was removed from his employment. However, Sir Joseph recommended him to one of the heads of the University of Cambridge, where he was willingly received; but a company of players coming to Stourbridge fair, near that place, Joe fell so much in love with their employment and way of living, that he threw a∣way his cap and band, and made one of their company. He was soon called to the King's company in Drury-lane, where his inimitable performance and vivacity brought him into the familiarity of the wits of the age, and persons of the first rank, insomuch, that a noble duke, going ambassador to France, thought it no disgrace to take Haines as a companion. Joe (besides the dead languages) spoke Italian and French to as much perfection as if he had been born both at Rome and Paris; and therefore it is no wonder to he was caressed by many of the French nobility. Here he took the title of Count, and by his art tricked many of the rich citizens of Paris out of large sums of money. After his French expedi∣tion, he returned to the stage again, and had the art to form the countenances of his audience by his own; for the muscles of his face were like gaping, generally catching. His Pro∣logues and Epilogues do not seem extraordinary in the reading, but his manner of speaking made them inimitable. The Epilogue in particular, that he spoke riding on an ass, created such a laughter and reiterated applauses, that it was near half an hour in the speaking. This excellent Comedian was author of one play, "A Fatal Mistake, or The Plot spoiled; as it was lately acted, 1692." He died of a fever (after a short illness) April 4, 1701, at his lodgings in Hart-street Long Acre, and was buried in Covent Garden church-yard. See "British Theatre, 1752," p. 119.

<L>Not that he fear'd the wars, but some chance-blow</L>

<L>They come, they ogle, and the heart is lost.</L>

<L>ONCE more our London Muses, pleas'd, repair</L>
<L>To this bless'd seat, and breathe their native air;</L>
<L>Here seek protection from their kindred gown,</L>
<L>Glad to retire from that degenerate town,</L>
<L>Where spurious critics in false judgement sit,</L>
<L>Debauch'd with farce, and negligent of wit.</L>
<L>Our indignation equally they raise,</L>
<L>Whether they frown or smile upon our Plays,</L>
<L>And damn us with the scandal of their praise.</L>
<L>Now to our wish we have an audience found,</L>
<L>Which will be pleas'd with sense as well as sound:</L>
<L>You only can reform th' unthinking age,</L>
<L>Redeem our credit lost, and dignify the Stage.</L>
<L>Wit is your growth, and now ('tis all we crave)</L>
<L>Retrieve that honour which before you gave:</L>
<L>Poetry yet will thrive, if rais'd by you,</L>
<L>As plants their fading vigour will renew</L>
<L>From that kind soil in which at first they grew.</L>
<L>Your learned censures will instruct the town,</L>
<L>And teach them when to smile, and when to frown,</L>
<L>And by your judgement to improve their own.</L>
<L>You, as Wit's higher powers, our doom reveal,</L>
<L>From whose decisive court there's no appeal.</L>
<L><PB N="192" REF="195"/>Then rise, Athenians! in the just defence</L>
<L>Of Poetry opprest, and long-neglected Sense;</L>

<L>You, who with such an air and mien,</L>
<L>And face not safely to be seen,</L>
<L>With so much beauty, wit, and truth,</L>
<L>Might well deserve a nobler youth;</L>
<L>A youth, if such a one there is,</L>

<L>So fine, so bright a nymph as you;</L>

<L>Fortune has such a favour thrown;</L>
<L>Who vows he'll do his best to please,</L>
<L>And to deserve the happiness;</L>
<L>Or by his constancy will prove</L>
<L>Such charms can always challenge love.</L>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF A LADY, FROM THE OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE MISCELLANY.</HEAD>
<L>SPeak, Grief; for long the mournful strains have hung</L>
<L>Upon my drooping soul, and fix'd my tongue;</L>
<L>Pay the just tribute of a funeral verse,</L>
<L>And let her virtue's praise attend her hearse:</L>
<L>The task is great, for who can e'er descry</L>
<L>Each shining star which forms the galaxy?</L>
<L>Who can describe the graces of her mind,</L>
<L>Where all that's great, and good, and beauteous shin'd?</L>
<L>Who can each single virtue justly shew?</L>
<L>Or marshal all the glorious train in view?</L>
<L>No, the attempt would a rash zeal appear,</L>
<L>And but blaspheme the mighty character:</L>
<L>How well she acted all the parts of life,</L>
<L>Th' obedient child, and most indulgent wife;</L>
<L>The tenderest mother, and the best of friends,</L>
<L>Faithful, sincere, and generous without ends!</L>
<L>To such whom nature had to her ally'd,</L>
<L>She by a stricter bond of love was tied:</L>
<L>But the intensive goodness of her mind</L>
<L>Was to no less than the whole world confin'd.</L>
<L>No sneaking passions harbour'd in her breast,</L>
<L>Which might disturb her own or other's rest:</L>
<L>But all that knew her would in justice own,</L>
<L>That she help'd many, but she injur'd none.</L>
<L>Such virtues might have been more useful here,</L>
<L>Had Fortune plac'd her in a higher sphere;</L>
<L>And might have shone as good, and shone as clear.</L>
<L><PB N="195" REF="198"/>But most in her lov'd privacy she spent</L>
<L>Her hours which to her Maker's praise she lent;</L>
<L>Her Maker now her praises will repay</L>

<HEAD>PARAPHRASE ON PSALM CXXXVII.</HEAD>

<HEAD>AESOP AT COURT. OR, SELECT FABLES. 1702.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. YALDEN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This little collection of Fables is one of the articles which are enumerated as wanting in vol. III. p. 167, and which have been since accidentally recovered. I have already observed that Dr. Johnson's "Life of Yalden" renders it unnecessary for me to enter on that subject. It may not, however, be improper to transcribe a few lines from Wood, Ath. II. 1022, which differ from Jacob, on whose authority the new Life seems in some measure to have been founded. The variations are of no material consequence, but, as Wood is more particular than Jacob, may perhaps be considered as a curiosity:
<Q>“Thomas <HI>Youlding</HI>, a younger son of Joh. Yould. sometimes a page of the presence and groom of the chamber to Prince Charles, afterwards a sufferer for his cause, and an exciseman in <HI>Oxon</HI> after the Restoration of King Charles II. was born in the parish of St. John Baptist in Oxon, on the second day of January, 1669, (in which parish I myself received also my first breath) edu∣cated in Magd. Coll. school while he was a chorister of that house, was elected demy, an. 16 ... and in the year 16 ... probationer-fellow.”</Q>
He took the degree of M. A. May 12, 1694; B. D. April 30, 1706; and D. D. July 1, 1708. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>In noiseless ease, and shunn'd the nuptial chain.</L>
<L>Far from her parents early she retir'd,</L>
<L>And the safe covert of a tower desir'd:</L>
<L>The tower was high, and near the water stood;</L>
<L>She seem'd a new-sprung Venus from the flood.</L>
<L>Discreet withal, nor lov'd to dance and play,</L>
<L>And waste in vain impertinence the day:</L>
<L>Secure in innocence, she liv'd unknown,</L>
<L>And balk'd the witty censures of the town.</L>

<L>A fair-one ne'er could brook a fairer face.</L>
<L><PB N="236" REF="241"/>To pleasure Venus was her darling care;</L>
<L>Nor did thy altars, Cupid, want a share:</L>

<L>And not one lingering sluggard droop'd at home.</L>
<L>No amorous youth would surely miss the day;</L>
<L>Where feasts invite, they still with joy obey:</L>
<L>Scarce (as I guess) on bare devotion's score,</L>
<L>The silent statues of the Gods t' adore;</L>
<L>For breasts, like theirs, with youthful raptures warm,</L>
<L>Not the dead idols, but the living charm.</L>
<L>But, oh! to see with what a sprightly haste</L>
<L>The beauteous priestess through the temple pass'd!</L>
<L>Not rising Phoebe shews a face so bright</L>
<L>To glad the world, and rule the spangled night.</L>
<L>For on each blooming cheek, by nature spread,</L>
<L>Was seen the purest white and freshest red:</L>
<L>Such is the hue the springing lily shows,</L>
<L>Fleck'd with the blushes of the opening rose.</L>
<L>Scarce yet the parallel would be compleat,</L>
<L>Not that so beautiful, nor this so sweet.</L>
<L><PB N="237" REF="242"/>Of old the thinking dotards did agree</L>
<L>To stint the Graces to the number three;</L>
<L>Had Hero blest those times, they soon had found</L>
<L>Too dull their notion, and too strait their bound;</L>
<L>Whene'er she smil'd, had view'd with dumb surprize,</L>

<L>The bright Immortal must with pleasure hear</L>
<L>A priestess far above all mortals fair:</L>

<L>And scatter'd pleasing ruin all along.</L>
<L>Till from the crowd</L>
<L>By Love one eloquent above the rest,</L>

<L>Sure the most charming of the charming three.</L>
<L>Weary'd with looking, fain I would be gone,</L>
<L>Yet could, methinks, for ever still look on.</L>
<L><PB N="238" REF="243"/>Were death the price, doom'd for the happy night,</L>
<L>Not death should damp one moment of delight:</L>
<L>Nor could th' immortal joys of Gods above</L>
<L>Engage my wishes, or distract my love.</L>
<L>But thou, O Goddess! listen to my prayer;</L>
<L>If not thy Hero, give me such a Fair.</L>
<L>Thus mourn'd some wounded youth; whilst others strove</L>
<L>In wild disorder to conceal their love:</L>
<L>But flames too fierce to hide at once possess'd,</L>
<L>And roll'd and revel'd in Leander's breast.</L>
<L>He saw the Nymph, and, struck with strange delight,</L>
<L>Resolv'd on something far beyond a sight.</L>
<L>He bled, but would not keep his wound unknown,</L>
<L>And wish'd to live, but could not live alone.</L>
<L>Ungovern'd thoughts to rage improv'd desire,</L>
<L>And kindled in his eyes impetuous fire.</L>
<L>Beware, ye heedless youths, and fly apace;</L>
<L>No dart so piercing as a beauteous face:</L>
<L>Nor winged deaths with half such swiftness sly,</L>

<L>Unruly passions now the youth assail,</L>
<L>And fears and hopes successively prevail:</L>
<L>Sooth'd with her charms, he strives his fears to blame,</L>
<L>Then blushing checks the too ambitious flame:</L>
<L>But wiser Love with noble pride disdains</L>
<L>The bashful modesty of simple swains;</L>
<L>And in soft whispers said, his laws were such,</L>
<L>None fears too little, and none hopes too much.</L>
<L><PB N="239" REF="244"/>Rais'd with these thoughts, he did his steps advance,</L>
<L>To try the magick of a side-long glance,</L>
<L>With all the artful blandishments, that move</L>

<L>She took the hint; (what Lovers now can find</L>
<L>That natural tendency in woman-kind?)</L>
<L>First seem'd to frown, but easily grew mild,</L>
<L>And, conscious of her own perfections, smil'd.</L>
<L>Then turns her head with graceful scorn away,</L>
<L>But, quick returning, doth herself betrray;</L>
<L>And in Love's greatest eloquence replies,</L>
<L>The silent language of consenting eyes.</L>
<L>With joy amaz'd, the youth his passion knew,</L>
<L>At once discover'd, and successful too;</L>
<L>Impatient grown, he chid the tedious light,</L>
<L>And wish'd the swift approaches of the night:</L>
<L>Nor wish'd in vain; soon the bright Hesper shone,</L>
<L>And love-obliging shades came rushing on.</L>
<L>Darkness can fears expel, and hopes renew;</L>
<L>Th' embolden'd Lover to his quarry flew,</L>
<L>And there stood face to face, a glorious interview!</L>
<L>Then, all on fire, her hand he gently press'd,</L>
<L>And sighs and dying murmurs told the rest.</L>
<L>Starting, she did a short resentment feign,</L>
<L>And with a frown drew back her head again.</L>
<L>But he, with love inspir'd, new joys descries</L>
<L>Through the thin umbrage of a forc'd disguise;</L>
<L>And seiz'd her robe, and, full of pleasing thought,</L>
<L>The last recesses of the temple sought.</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="245"/>With steps unequal she advanc'd behind,</L>
<L>And, with a willing, half unwilling mind,</L>

<L>"Stranger, what madness doth thy breast invade?</L>
<L>Whither, ah! whither would you force a Maid?</L>
<L>Let loose my garments quick, and home retire;</L>
<L>Flee the displeasure of my wealthy Sire:</L>
<L>If that you slight, and mortal power disown,</L>

<L>Go! be not with presumptuous thoughts misled;</L>
<L>'Tis bold aspiring to a Virgin's bed."</L>
<L>True to her sex, thus chid the charming Fair;</L>
<L>But glad Leander could such chidings bear:</L>
<L>This seeming storm a future calm betrays;</L>
<L>Th' auspicious omen of his halcyon days.</L>
<L>For women soon are kind, if peevish grown;</L>
<L>Faintly they struggle, when their rage is gone.</L>
<L>That known, the youth her fragrant bosom press'd,</L>

<L>If Venus be your guide, let Venus move;</L>

<L>Would'st thou the Goddess faithfully adore,</L>

<L>Oh! canst thou ever her sweet laws admire,</L>

<L>The little wanton God did me ordain,</L>

<L>While from Melanion's arms all ice she fled,</L>

<L>She fix'd her eyes upon the silent ground,</L>
<L>And all with crimson blushes glow'd around.</L>
<L>Unwonted motions own'd some new desire,</L>
<L>And oft she gather'd-up her loose attire.</L>
<L>A yielding maid by every sign was meant;</L>
<L>For dumb denying is a sure consent.</L>
<L><PB N="242" REF="247"/>Pleasingly pain'd, she first begins to fear</L>
<L>Something, she knows not what, she knows not where.</L>
<L>Deep in her breast Leander's charms remain;</L>
<L>She thinks, and sighs, then looks, and sighs again.</L>
<L>Nor the fond Lover, with a less surprize,</L>
<L>Fed on her snowy neck his famish'd eyes.</L>
<L>Thus long a virgin-modesty she try'd,</L>
<L>Not to discover what she could not hide;</L>

<L>Ah, by whose conduct didst thou hither come?</L>
<L>Who first seduc'd thee from thy native home?</L>

<L>No faithless rover must his wish obtain;</L>

<L>Thus every night to thy embrace I 'll fly,</L>

Baxter in the Preface to his "Poetical Fragments, 1681;" and is called by others "an incomparable version," especially by his friend Flatman, who wrote a Pindaric Ode on it, and also a copy of verses on Woodford's "Paraphrase on the Canticles, 1679," 8vo. With this latter Paraphrase are printed, 1.
<Q>“The Legend of Love,” in three cantos.</Q>
2. "To the Muse," a Pindaric Ode. 3.
<Q>“A Paraphrase upon some select Hymns of the New and Old Testament.”</Q>
4.
<Q>“Occasional Com∣positions in English Rhimes,” with some Translations out of Latin, Greek, Spanish, and Italian, but chiefly out of his last; some of which Compositions and Translations were before falsely published by a too curious collector of them from very false copies, against the will and knowledge of their author.</Q>
Dr. Woodford complains that several of his Translations of some of the Moral Odes had been printed after the same incorrect manner. N.</NOTE>;</L>

<HEAD>ON MRS. E. MONTAGUE'S BLUSHING IN THE CROSS-BATH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. FLATMAN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Flatman was born in Aldersgate-street about 1623, educated at Winchester, and in 1654 elected from thence to New College in Oxford, which he left without taking a degree. He afterwards studied the law in the Inner Temple; married a young lady with a good fortune, Nov. 26, 1672; died Dec. 8, 1688, in the life-time of his fa∣ther (at that time a clerk in chancery, and in his 80th year); and was buried at St. Bride's, London. He is described by Mr. Granger as "one of the unsuccessful imitators of Pindar, or rather of Cowley, in a species of poetry which pleased more from its novelty, than its excellence, in that celebrated writer. He composed Pindaric odes on the death of the duke of Albe∣marle, the earl of Ossory, prince Rupert, and Charles II. The duke of Ormond was so pleased with that on the death of the earl of Ossory, his son, that he sent the author a ring, with a diamond in it, worth 100<HI>l.</HI> It is no wonder that the heart of a father, softened by the death of such a son, f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt something in reading this composition which an indif∣ferent person cannot even imagine; and mistook the natural working of his own breast, for the art of the poet. Flatman really excelled as an artist: a man must want ears for har∣mony, that can admire his poetry; and even want eyes that can cease to admire his painting. Some of his tasteless con∣temporaries thought him equally excellent in both; but one of his heads is worth a ream of his Pindaries; I had almost said all the P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndaries written in this reign. It does our au∣thor some honour, that Mr. Pope has very closely copied se∣veral of his verses, in his ode of
<Q>“The dying Christian to his So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.”</Q>
—Mr. Granger's censure on Flatman's poetry is surely too severe. He was one of the writers in
<Q>“Don Juan Lam∣berto, or a Comical-History of the late Times,”</Q>
more com∣monly known by the name of "Montelion's Almanack," first published in 1660 by J. Philips, continued in the two succeeding years by Flatman, and said to be a very facetious and entertaining work. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

There was, however, an earlier poet, of both the names of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s author; who was nephew to Milton, and wrote some memoirs of his uncle, and several burlesque poems; particu∣larly, 1.

"A Satyr against Hypocrites," which Jacob calls "a very ingenious performance," and, 3.
<Q>“The Almanack of Montelion,” (see p. 273.)</Q>
He likewise wrote several other songs, all set to music by Dr. Blow; some pieces in a serious vein of poetry, well approved; and burlesqued the fifth and sixth books of Virgil's Aeneid.—An ideal poet of the same name (assumed probably by Curll for the purpose of deceit) was author of two political farces, both printed in 1716; 1.

<HEAD>ON A LADY'S PICTURE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. BROOME <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Dr. Johnson is writing the Life of this elegant poet, I will not anticipate the entertainment my readers have such ample reason to expect, any farther than to lay before them a few plain facts; for which I am indebted to authorities which it would be presumption to mention on so slight an occasion. William Broome, sprung from mean parents in Cheshire, was elected upon the foundation at Eaton, and had the (almost unheard-of) misfortune of being Captain of that school for one whole year, 1707, without any vacancy's hap∣pening at King's College, by which means he was super-annuated. I repeat the expression <HI>almost unheard-of</HI>, as it has happened but four times in 160 years; viz. in 1619, 1653, 1707, 1756. Being an excellent Greek scholar, and univer∣sally beloved, his friends sent him to St. John's College, Cam∣bridge, where by their assistance, and a small exhibition, he was maintained till he entered into orders. Soon after which, accidentally becoming acquainted with Mr. Pope (who was upon a visit to Sir John Cotton, at Madingley, three miles from Cambridge) an intimacy ensued; and he translated eight books of the Odyssey (as appears by a note of his own), and had the merit of being
<Q>“Annotator in part upon the Iliad, and entirely upon the Odyssey.”</Q>
That he furnished
<Q>“the greater part of the Remarks from Eustathius, together with several excellent observations,”</Q>
is acknowledged by Mr. Pope; who, it has been said, promised him a handsome gra∣tuity for his trouble, and when the work was finished, quar∣reled with him, and disappointed him of the promised reward. It is certain that Broome thus represented the story to his friends. Yet, in a Letter to Lord Harvey, from Mr. Pope, who had been charged with
<Q>“selling Broome's works printed with Pope's name,” he tells his lordship, he printed not his name before a line of the person's his lordship men∣tions.</Q>
—"Besides, my lord, when you said I <HI>sold</HI> another man's works, you ought in justice to have added that I <HI>bought</HI> them, which very much alters the case; what I gave was five hundred pounds; his receipt can be pro∣duced to your lordship." Broome and Fenton, we learn from Ruffhead, had formed a design of translating the Odyssey, while Pope was employed upon the Iliad; and went through several books of the Odyssey, which they desired him to peruse; he complied with their request: and, having made a considerable progress in the work himself, adopted what he found thus ready, for the speedier advancement of his work; and indeed it is some confirmation of what is thus related, that, among the poems in Broome's first edition, there is one "To a Gentleman who corrected some of my Verses," the title of which he afterwards thus changed: "To Mr. A. Pope, who corrected my Verses." In the Life of Pope, p. 205, it is asserted that Broome received from him 600l. and Fenton 300l. Probably the coadjutors, finding that Pope got more than they or he expected, were desirous of coming in for a share; but, if they received what they agreed for, there seems no just ground of complaint; and though Pope was not ge∣nerous on this occasion, if he had a receipt for 500l. to shew, there is little more to be said on the subject.—Dr. Broome was for some time Rector of Sturston in Suffolk, whence he dates the dedication to Lord Townshend (then one of the principal Secretaries of State) Jan. 16, 1726; and was at that time chaplain to Charles lord (afterwards earl) Cornwallis. At Sturston he married a lady who had a good fortune, which enabled him to take the degree of LL.D. when the king went to Cambridge, April 25, 1728. Upon his resig∣nation of the living of Sturston, he was presented by the crown to the rectory of Pulham in Norfolk, in August, 1733; and held it united to the rectory of Oakley Magna in Suffolk, to which he was presented by Lord Cornwallis, who afterwards gave him the vicarage of Eye in Suffolk. The two last pre∣ferments he enjoyed till his death, which happened at Bath, Nov. 16, 1745. He was buried in the abbey church there, by Dr. Gooch, bishop of Norwich. That he was favoured by the Muses, appears by his "Poems on several Occasions," first printed in the year 1727; again in 1739; a third time in 1750; and lately in the collection of the English Poets. One of his poems is intituled,
<Q>“Melancholy, an Ode occasioned by the Death of a beloved Daughter, 1723;” but it is not quite certain that it was written on a daughter of his own.</Q>
His "Verses on the Death of a Friend," which were printed in 1727, were afterwards very happily enlarged, and applied to Mr. Fenton, who died in 1730.
<Q>“In The Sacred and Profane History of the World connected,”</Q>
vol. III. p. 60, Dr. Broome is menttoned by Mr. Shuckford, under the title of
<Q>“the ingenious Annotator on the English Homer, whose real worth, as well as learning, makes it a pleasure to me to say that I have a friendship with him.”</Q>
He left an only son, Charles Broome, who died of the small-pox, in 1747, being then an under-graduate at St. John's College, Cambridge. N.</NOTE>, NOT PRINTED IN HIS POEMS.</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>BY A. PHILIPS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ambrose Philips, descended from an ancient family in Leicestershire, was educated at St. John's College, Cam∣bridge. On his coming to London, he soon ranked among the wits at Button's. The great reputation he gained by his pastorals was the occasion of Mr. Pope's writing the 40th number of the Guardian, on the merits of Philips and himself; where he represented himself as the best versifier, and Philips as the better Arcadian. The enemies of Pope exulted, to see him placed below Philips in a species of poetry upon which he was supposed to value himself; but were much mortified to find that Pope himself was the real author of that paper, and that the whole criticism was irony. On the accession of king George I, he was made a justice of the peace, and a commissioner of the lottery; and when Doctor Boulter was advanced to the primacy, Mr. Philips went to Ireland with him, where he had considerable preferments, and represented the county of Armagh in parliament. Purchasing, some time after, an annuity of 400l. he returned to England in 1748; but did not live long to enjoy it. He was author of "The Life of Archbishop Williams;" was concerned with Dr. Boulter and others in "The Freethinker;" and wrote three tragedies, "The Distressed Mother," 1711; "The Briton," 1721; and "Humphrey duke of Gloucester," the same year. But his greatest reputation is owing to a beau∣tiful winter-piece of his in The Tatler, dated Copenhagen, May 9, 1709; which Steele calls
<Q>“as fine a piece as we ever had from any of the schools of the most learned paint∣”ers.</Q>
— He collected and published his own poems a short time before his death; but it is less to be wondered at that he should omit this small epigram, than that he should have adopted (which he has done, English Poets, vol. XLIV. p. 371.) a short epigram of Mr. Jeffreys. See Gent. Mag▪ Dec. 1779. N.</NOTE>; NOT PRINTED IN HIS POEMS.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>EPIGRAM ON MRS. TOFTS, A HANDSOME WOMAN WITH A FINE VOICE, BUT VERY COVETOUS AND PROUD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This epigram, first printed anonymously in Steele's Col∣lection, and copied in the Miscellanies of Swift and Pope, is ascribed to Pope by Sir John Hawkins in his History of Music —Mrs. Tofts, who was the daughter of a person in the family of Bp. Burnet, is celebrated as a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inger little in∣ferior, either for her voice or manner, to the best Italian wo∣men. She lived at the introduction of the opera into this kingdom, and sung in company with Nicolini; but, being ig∣norant of Italian, chanted her recitative in English, in an∣swer to his Italian; yet the charms of their voices overcame the absurdity. Cibber, in the Apology for his Life, p. 26, speaks of her in very high terms; and in "The Tatler," No. 20, she is described under the character of Camilla; a character, which, from her having represented the princess in the opera of that name, was supposed to have disordered her mind. In the meridian of her beauty, and possessed of a large sum of money which she had acquired by singing, Mrs. Tofts quitted the stage, and was married to Mr. Joseph Smith, a great collector of books, and patron of the arts; who being appointed consul at Venice, she went with him. He lived in great magnificence; but, the disorder of his wife returning, she dwelt sequestered from the world in a remote part of the house, and had a large garden to range in, where she would frequently walk, singing and giving way to that innocent frenzy which had seized her in the early part of life. She died about the year 1760; and her husband about ten years after her. His numerous and valuable collection of books was brought over to this kingdom, and sold by auction. N.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>VERSES PRESENTED TO A LADY, WITH A DRAWING (BY THE AUTHOR) OF CUPID.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HUGHES <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Poet's Life has employed the pleasing pen of Dr. Johnson, who has given the character of his genius from Pope; but I am sorry to say that our English Homer appears to have acted in this case with duplicity. In a letter to Mr. Hughes, just before his death, he thus expresses himself:
<Q>“Would to God you might live as long as, I am sure, the reputation of your Tragedy must!”</Q>
Letters from Eminent Persons, Lett. 290. In one to his brother, just after his death, with other elogiums,
<Q>“I am glad of an occasion to give you, under my hand, this testimony both how ex∣cellent I think this work to be, and how excellent I thought the author.”</Q>
Ibid. I. 197. And, which is still more to the purpose, this last
<Q>“testimony of his real regard (as he styles it) for Mr. Hughes,”</Q>
being given after his death, the editor of his Works was allowed by Mr. Pope to publish, as
<Q>“a greater instance of the sincerity with which it was given.”</Q>
Ibid. I. 205. These are his words. And now which is most deserving of credit, a testi∣mony thus solemnly given to the world, or the echo, as it were, of his peevish friend, whom he was afraid to contradict, in a letter which he little thought would have been preserved and printed; and which, with his others to Swift, he wanted to recall? At every tribunal, a witness who contradicts him∣self is disbelieved; if such an opinion is not allowed to esta∣blish, much less should it be admitted to traduce a character: and, on the whole, the passage which Dr. Johnson has thus quoted can, with the considerate, only degrade and condemn the author of it, though
<Q>“what HE wanted as an <HI>honest</HI> man, he made up as a genius.”</Q>
I transcribe this passage from a writer in "The Gentleman's Magazine, 1779," p. 457, who appears to be well informed. — Dr. Johnson having ob∣served that,
<Q>“though Mr. Hughes's advances in literature are in the Biographia very ostentatiously displayed, the name of his master is somewhat ungratefully concealed;”</Q>
the Reviewer in "The Gentleman's Magazine, 1779," p. 549, exculpates Dr. Campbell by observing,
<Q>“that it does not appear, or is likely, that he knew it; and all that can be known is, that Hughes was a fellow-student in logic and philosophy with Dr. Watts and Mr. Say, perhaps under Mr. Thomas Rowe.”</Q>
— It must be owned, however, that concealing a master's name is a venial fault. If it is always to be mentioned, how often must the masters of Eton and Westminster be named, though perhaps they have con∣tributed little! A lad may leave school before he comes under them; or even if he does, all the five of six previous ushers ought to have their proportionate share of praise. — An Ode, "To the Returning Sun," which I have printed in vol. III. p. 87, is probably by Mr. Hughes. N.</NOTE>; NOT IN HIS WORKS.</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>BY MR. TICKELL <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Tickell, an English Poet of an excellent genius, was the son of the Rev. Richard Tickell, a clergyman well-preferred in the North of England. Whilst fellow of Queen's College, Oxford, he so effectually made Mr. Addison his friend, by a complimentary copy of verses on "Rosamond," that he obtained the office of under secretary of state; and, when Mr. Addison's ill health obliged him to resign, he so effectually recommended Mr. Tickell to his successor Mr. Craggs, that he was continued in place till that gentleman's death. Mr. Tickell was appointed secretary to the lord jus∣tices in Ireland in June 1724, and held that office till his death in 1740. He had the care of an edition of Mr. Ad∣dison's works, to which he prefixed an account of his patron's life, and a poem on his death. The translation of the first book of the Iliad, which has been ascribed to Tickell, was said to be in reality the production of Addison, to prejudice that which Pope had just undertaken: a notion certainly without foundation. Mr. Watts, the printer, assured a friend of mine, that
<Q>“the translation of the first book of the Iliad” was in Tickell's hand-writing, but much corrected "and interlined by Addison."</Q>
He published
<Q>“Oxford, a poem inscribed to the right hon. the lord Lonsdale, 1707,”</Q>
folio; of which I have not yet been able to obtain a copy; but am promised it, by a friend, for my next volume. N.</NOTE>; NOT IN HIS WORKS.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>ALMAHIDE, AN ODE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HENRY ST. JOHN, AFTERWARDS LORD BOLINGBROKE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This truly extraordinary genius is supposed to have been born in 1672 (or rather not quite so early). He was sent to Eaton when ten years old, and thence to Christ-Church, Oxford; where he received the title of LL. D. August 27, 1702. He married his first lady (Frances daughter of Sir H. Winchcomb of Bucklebury) in 1700; and took his seat in the house of commons for Wooton Basset the same year. Having greatly distinguished himself in that assembly, he was appointed secretary at war, April 20, 1704; and re∣signed Feb. 12, 1707-8. He succeeded Mr. Boyle, as secre∣tary of state, Sept. 21, 1710: was created baron St. John and viscount Bolingbroke, July 7, 1712; an honour which he received with much reluctance, having been disap∣pointed of an earldom (extinct on the death of Paulet St. John, earl Bolingbroke, Oct. 5, 1711) and of the Garter; and was made lord lieutenant and custos rotulorum of the county of Essex, Oct. 24, 1713. On the accession of King George, the seals were taken from him, and all the papers in his office secured. Soon after the meeting of the new parliament, perceiving himself in danger, he withdrew into France. On his arrival at Paris, he received an invi∣tation from the Pretender, to enter into his service; which he declined, and endeavoured to soften his prosecution at home. Retiring to Dauphine, he continued there till July 1715, when he accepted a second offer of the seals from the Pretender. Having been discarded from the Chevalier's service before that year was well expired, he set to work in earnest to make his peace at home; and procured a promise of pardon, on certain conditions, from the King; who, July 2, 1716, created his father baron of Battersea and viscount St. John. In 1717, Lord Bolingbroke drew up a vindication of his whole conduct with respect to the Tories, in the form of a letter to Sir W. Wyndham, which is written with the utmost elegance and address, and abounds with interesting and entertaining anecdotes. His Majesty having granted him a full and free pardon, May 28, 1723; he returned to his native country in June, at the very juncture when Bishop Atterbury was banished. Obtaining an act of parliament, in May 1725, to restore him to his family inheritance, and to enable him to possess any purchase he should make, he pitched upon Dawley in Middlesex; where he amused him∣self in rural employments, and in corresponding and con∣versing with a few select friends. He remained, however, still a mere titular Lord, not being admitted to take his seat in parliament. Inflamed with this taint, he again entered upon the public stage, and embarked strongly in opposition against Sir Robert Walpole; which he carried on with ini∣mitable spirit, till, in 1735, on a disagreement with his principal coadjutors, he retired to France, with a full reso∣lution never more to engage in public business. On the death of his father, at the age of ninety, in April 1742, he settled at Battersea, the ancient seat of the family, where he passed the remainder of his days in the highest dignity; and died Dec. 15, 1751. During the latter part of his life, he was much in the confidence of Frederick Prince of Wales, father to his present Majesty; and is supposed to have been the ad∣viser of the most important steps taken by that Prince in his political conduct. — Lord Bolingbroke's second lady was the dowager marchioness de Vilett<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, niece to madam de Main∣tenon. His political character is fully discussed in the
<Q>“Sup∣plement to Swift.”</Q>
—Mr. Walpole says,
<Q>“With the most agreeable talents in the world, and with great parts, Lord Bolingbroke was neither happy nor successful. He wrote against the King, who had forgiven him; against Sir Ro∣bert Walpole, who did forgive him; against the Pretender and the Clergy, who never will forgive him. He is one of our best Writers; though his attacks on all governments and all religion (neither of which he cared directly to ow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) have necessarily involved his style in a want of perspicuity.”</Q>
Two prologues by him are here printed; his verses to Clar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are in Dodsley's Miscellanies; and Mr. Walpole, who says "Lord Bolingbroke had a natural and easy turn for poetry, mentions

<L>But, oh! how hardly will he reach his aim,</L>

<L>There was a time, when all those passions felt,</L>

<HEAD>TO A LADY MORE CRUEL THAN FAIR.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. (AFTERWARDS SIR JOHN) VANBRUGH <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This excellent dramatic writer, descended from an antient family in Che<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hire, discovered an early propension to poetry and architecture, and soon became eminent in both. He set out in life as an ensign in the army; and possessed a ready wit and an agreeable elocution. In some of his winter quarters he became acquainted with Sir Thomas Skipwith; who being a sharer in a theatrical patent, though little concerned in the conduct of it, young Vanbrugh shewed him the outlines of two plays; and Sir Thomas encouraged him to finish
<Q>“The Relapse,” which, being acted in 1697, succeeded beyond their warmest expectations, placed Vanbrugh in a high degree of reputation, and stimulated him (under the patronage of lord Halifax) to complete his "Provoked Wife;" which was successfully brought out at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1698.</Q>
Though both these comedies met with greater applause than the author expected, yet neither of them wanted enemies; and one of them is said to verify the observation of Pope,
<Q>"That Van wants grace, who never wanted wit."</Q>
In the same year, 1698, he brought out his comedy of "Aesop," which was acted at Drury Lan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and contains much general satire and useful morality. [A pretty fable from this comedy may be seen in p. 344.]
<Q>“The False Friend,” his next comedy, came out in 1702.</Q>
During the reign of queen Anne, he received the honour of knighthood, and enjoyed for some years the office of Clarencieux king at arms. By king George I. he was appointed surveyor of the works at Greenwich Hospital in August 1716; and was like∣wise made comptroller-general of his majesty's works, and surveyor of the gardens and waters. On a visit to France, his curiosity and natural taste exciting him to take a survey of the fortifications in that kingdom, he was taken notice of by an engineer, secured by authority, and carried to The Bastile, where his confinement was so much softened by humanity, that he amused himself by drawing rude draughts of some co∣medies. This circumstance raised such curiosity at Paris, that he was visited by seve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the noblesse, and by their means procured his liberty before any solicitation for it came from England. Sir John Vanbrugh had interest enough to raise a subscription of thirty persons of quality, at 100l. each, for building a stately theatre in The Hay Market; on the first stone that was laid of this theatre was inscribed the words LITTLE WHIG, as a compliment to a celebrated beauty, the toast and pride of that party. The house being finished in 1706, it was put by Mr. Betterton and his associates under the management of Sir John Vanbrugh and Mr. Congreve, in hopes of retrieving their desperate fortunes; but their expec∣tations were too sanguine. The new theatre was opened with a translated opera, set to Italian music, called
<Q>“The Tri∣umph of Love,” which met with a cold reception.</Q>
<Q>“The Confederacy” was almost immediately after produced by Sir John, and acted with more success than so licentious a per∣formance deserved, though less than it was entitled to if con∣sidered merely with respect to its dramatic merit.</Q>
The pro∣spects of the theatre being unpromising, Mr. Congreve gave up his share and interest wholly to Vanbrugh; who, being now become sole manager, was under a necessity of exerting himself. Accordingly, in the same season, he gave the pub∣lick three other imitations from the French; viz. 1.
<Q>“The Cuckold in Conceit;” 2. "Squire Trecloby;" and, 3. "The Mistake."</Q>
The spaciousness of the dome in the new theatre, by preventing the actors from being distinctly heard, was an inconvenience not to be surmounted; and an union of the two companies was projected. Sir John, tired of the business, disposed of his theatrical concerns to Mr. Owen Swinney, who governed the stage till another great revolution occurred. Our author's last comedy,
<Q>“The Journey to London,” which was left imperfect, was finished to great advantage by Mr. Gibber; who takes notice in the prologue of Sir John's virtuous intention in composing this piece, to make amends for scenes written in the fire of youth.</Q>
He seemed sensible indeed of this, when in 1725 he altered an exceptionable scene in "The Provoked Wife," by putting into the mouth of a woman of quality what before had been spoken by a clergyman; a change which removed from him the imputation of prophaneness. He died of a quinsey, at his house at Whitehall, March 26, 1726; and has left behind him monuments of same which can never perish but with taste and politeness. He lived esteemed by all his acquain∣tance, and died without leaving one enemy to reproach his memory. Mr. Walpole, in his "Anecdotes of Painting," vol. III. p. 152, says,
<Q>“However partial the court was to Vanbrugh, every body was not so blind to his defects. Swift ridiculed both his own diminutive house at Whitehall, and the stupendous pile at Blenheim. Of the first he says,
<Q><L>'At length they in the rubbish spy</L>
<L>'A thing resembling a goose-pye.'</L></Q>
And of the other,
<Q><L>'That if his Grace were no more skill'd in</L>
<L>'The art of battering walls than building,</L>
<L>'We might expect to see next year</L>
<L>'A mouse-trap-man chief engineer.'</L></Q>
Thus far the <HI>swi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> was well <HI>found<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI>; party rage warped his understanding, when he censured Vanbrugh's plays, and left him no more judgement to see their beauties, than Sir John had, when he perceived not that they were the only beauties he was formed to compose.”</Q>
— This polite writer, perhaps, was not aware of the handsome apo∣logy Dr. Swift and Mr. Pope have made, in the joint preface to their Miscellanies:
<Q>“In regard to two persons only we with our raillery, though ever so tender, or resentment, though ever so just, had not been indulged. We speak of Sir John Vanbrugh, who was a man of w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and of honour; and of Mr. Addison, whose name deserves all respect from every <HI>lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of learning</HI>.”</Q>

There is very little merit in fol∣lowing him, if she is not liable to be drowned, and if she is sure of becoming a constellation; which is more suitable talk for Ovid's ladies than a modern Christian. Sailors are not apt to pray on looking at stars; and there is no reason from the account in the Bible to believe that Jonas was pleased with his host, or <HI>vice versa</HI>.</P>

<P>P. 20. l. 8. r. "Some favourite clown." — L. 27. <HI>He that lives the longest, dies but young.</HI>] He that lives the longest, lives but a very short time in comparison with a much longer period, or eternity: but this is not dying young. A worn∣out young debauchee may be old; i. e. have many of the complaints of old age: but no really old man dies like a vi∣gorous blooming young man, in full strength of body and per∣fection of senses and understanding.

<Q>“citizen and bricklayer of London,”</Q>
and the latter
<Q>“of St. Martin in the Fields, gentleman.”</Q>
The square abovementioned is there also styled <HI>Frith square</HI>: it was afterwards King square, and a court in it still retains that name.</P>
<P>P. 30. The third stanza contains a good picture of Wolsey's housekeeping.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="354"/>P. 31. l. 1. It is a very curious fact that they should build churches, which cannot now be whitewashed <HI>within, without</HI> setting a parish in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lame.</P>

<Q>“no Scholar died, but his Epitaph proclaimed that he was, <HI>Poeta, Ora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or elegantiss. disertiss. Theolog. priesiantiss.</HI> &amp;c.

<P>P. 44. His contemporaries certainly saw that Waller had softened our tongue (see p. 129); yet it has been observed that the writers some time before were smooth and harmo∣nious.

<P>Ibid. l. 14. The poet will have enough to do, to persuade us, that these qualities, if true, however quaintly he may express them, "harangue and talk," are not infinitely above "to sing."</P>
<P>P. 47. When in Bedlam, Lee was visited by Sir Roger L'Estrange; who said,

<Q>“Mr. Dahl, I have often had my ”picture drawn, but it never has been like.</Q>

<HEAD>VOLUME III.</HEAD>
<P>P. 19. I now find that the "Bibliotheca" was the production of another writer. Instead of <HI>King</HI>, therefore, read <HI>Newcomb</HI>, to all the notes.—Thomas Newcomb, M. A. (son of a worthy clergyman in Herefordshire, and great grandson by his mo∣ther's side to the famous Spenser) was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford; and was chaplain to the second duke of Richmond, and rector of Stopham in Sussex, near his Grace's seat.—Besides the "Bibl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otheca," he was author of several poems of merit; particularly of
<Q>“The last Judge∣ment of Men and Angels, a poem in twelve books, after
<PB N="356" REF="361"/>
the manner of Milton, 1723,”</Q>
folio, adorned with a fine metzotinto portrait; of a poem, which Jacob commends,
<Q>“To her late Majesty Queen Anne, upon the Peace of Utrecht;”</Q>
"An Ode to the Memory of Mr. Rowe;" and another, "to the memory of the Countess of Berkeley." He also translated several of Addison's Latin poems; and Philips's Ode to Mr. St. John, English Poets, vol. XXI. p. 29.</P>
<P>P. 44. It since appears that Mrs. Wharton (wife to Thomas Wharton, es{que} before he succeeded to a peerage) is the same whose poems are printed in these volumes. Her article in the General Dictionary is a short one; but the notes on it contain two letters from her to her husband, and twelve from Dr. Burnet to Mrs. Wharton. The marquis's second wise had also poetical abilities, as will appear in vol. V. p. 10. A small epigram by the marquis is preserved in the Supple∣ment to Swift.</P>
<P>P. 105. <HI>note</HI>, l. S. r. "Earl."</P>
<P>P. 118. I have been favoured with some valuable unpub∣lished poems of Dr. Evans, too late for the present publica∣tion; they shall be printed in the next volume.</P>
<P>P. 161. Dr. Evans 'on Ble<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heim' reminds me of Lord Chesterfield telling Geo. Wade, after Lord Burlington had built him a house in Burlington Gardens, with a most elegant front, but very inconvenient within, that he did not make the proper use of it. 'How so, my Lord? I live in it.'— "True," says the Earl;
<Q>“but, if I were you, I would take a house over against it, to admire that beautiful front.”</Q>
D.</P>
<P>P. 207. Mr. Foxton was author of "The Tower," a de∣scriptive poem, printed in the Whartoniana.</P>
<P>P. 263. That Martin Parker was a real character, is plain from
<Q>“The Nightingale warbling forth her own disaster;
<PB N="357" REF="362"/>
or the Rape of Philomela. Newly written in English verse. By Martin Parker. London 1632.”</Q>
8vo.</P>
<P>P. 312. <HI>note.</HI> r. "Ne'er to these chambers," &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>VOLUME IV.</HEAD>
<P>P. 65. Besides Dr. Brady's Sermon, I have now by me three others on St. Caecilia's day; one, by Ralph Battell, sub-dean of their majesties chapel royal, 1693; Dr. Hick∣man's in 1695; one by S. Estwick, B. D. in 1696, when the meeting was held on Nov. 27; Dr. Brady's was in 1697. Bound up with these is, a Sermon preached at Tiverton in Devon, by John Newton, M. A. rector of Tiverton; some time fellow of Baliol College, Oxford, Sept. 13, 1696, on occasion of an organ's being erected in the parish-church;
<Q>“the first organ erected in that diocese (out of the city) af∣ter the great rebellion had destroyed the use of them in many places.”</Q></P>
<P>P. 167. This poem is very possibly by J. Philips, the ne∣phew of Milton. See p. 283.</P>
<P>P. 199. The name of <HI>Youlding</HI> this writer is said to have changed, <HI>cuphoniae gratiâ</HI>, by a <HI>poetical</HI> licence only, into <HI>Yalden</HI>. He was domestic chaplain to the famous Bp. Saun∣derson, and for many years vice principal of Magdalen Hall.</P>
<P>P. 286. An assize sermon by Dr. Broome, 1737, 4to. with one earlier single sermon by him, is in print.</P>
<P>P. 304. In the "Supplement to Swift's Works," I have taken some pains to collect such particulars of his life and character as had escaped the notice of former editors; and am happy to find that my labours have been favourably ac∣cepted. If they furnish any new lights to future Biogra∣phers, and particularly if they suggest a single hint to the bright luminary of English literature, I shall receive my best
<PB N="358" REF="363"/>
reward.—One striking anecdote, which has been communica∣ted to me since that publication, is so remarkable, that I shall insert it here: it is extracted from a letter of Dr. Charles Da∣venant, dated Sept. 22, to his son Harry, secretary and chargé d'affairs for Q. Anne at Francfort.
<Q>“I desire you to deliver the inclosed to Col. Parks (aid-de-camp to the Duke of Marlborough). The chief subject of it is to be∣speak his kindness for <HI>my cousin Swift</HI> to be his chaplain against he has a regiment. My cousin has gained immor∣tal honour by <HI>having had the principal hand</HI> in a book lately published, called <HI>The Tale of a Tub</HI>, which has made as much noise, and is as full of wit, as any book, perhaps ”that has come out these last hundred years.</Q>
It needs not be added that the application was unsuccessful. To the duke of Marlborough, however, Swift (who without scruple
<Q>“li∣”belled the whole junto round) appears to have entertained no animosity.</Q>
The refusal probably was noble; and Swift's conduct to the duke was equally liberal. He disliked his principles; but
<Q>“prevented many hard things being said of ”him.</Q>
And in the Journal to Stella, Jan. 8, 1711-12, it appears the duke desir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>othing so much as to contrive some way how to soften Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ift; who says,
<Q>“Those things that were hardest against him were not written by me. And I am sure, now he is down, I shall not trample on him: al∣”though I love him not, I dislike his being out.</Q></P>
<P>P. 320. Mr. Milbourne published 31 single Sermons, be∣tween 1682 and 1720.</P>
