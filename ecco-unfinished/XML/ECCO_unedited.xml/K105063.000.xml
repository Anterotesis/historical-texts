<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Collection of the Earl of <HI>Rosco∣mon</HI>'s
Poems, Care has been taken to in∣sert
all that I could possibly procure that are
truly Genuine; there have been several Things
published under his Name which were written
by others, the Authors of which I could set
down, if it were Material.</P>
<P>His Essay on Translated Verse has been very
much esteem'd; it is from the Ingenious Pen
of Mr. <HI>Eusden</HI> of <HI>Cambridge</HI> that you have the
Latin Version of it, which was never printed
before. That Essay begins with these two Lines:
<Q><L>Happy that Author, whose correct Essay</L>
<L><HI>Repairs</HI> so well our Old <HI>Horatian</HI> Way.</L></Q>
Where his Lordship refers to the Essay on
Poetry, written by a Noble Hand; and I
have, at the end of my Lord <HI>Roscomon</HI>'s
Poems, printed that Essay with the Leave and
with the Corrections of the Author.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
I was promis'd some Account of the Life
and Writings of the Earl of <HI>Roscomon</HI> by a
Gentleman that was very intimately acquaint∣ed
with his Lordship and his Writings; and but
for that Expectation this Collection had been
publish'd some Time since.</P>
<P>Besides these Poems, he made, in the Year
1682, a Translation of Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI>'s Dis∣course
of Passive Obedience into <HI>French,</HI> at
the Desire of the then Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI>
which is printed in <HI>8vo.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Poems of the late Mr. <HI>Duke;</HI>
whatever has not been printed before, I have
of his own Hand-Writing, to satisfy any Per∣son
that doubts of their being his.</P>
<P>The Beginning of the Poem, call'd the
<HI>Review,</HI> he wrote a little after the publishing
Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Absalom</HI> and <HI>Achitophel;</HI> he
was persuaded to undertake it by Mr. <HI>She∣ridan,</HI>
then Secretary to the Duke of <HI>York;</HI>
but Mr. <HI>Duke</HI> finding Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> design'd
to make use of his Pen to vent his
Spleen against several Persons at Court
that were of another Party, than that he was
engaged in, broke off proceeding in it, and
left it as it is now printed.</P>

<L>Advanc'd its head in <HI>Grecian</HI> Gardens nurst.</L>

<L>Made Nature first, and Nature's God their Song.</L>
<L>Nor stopt Translation here: For conquering <HI>Rome</HI></L>
<L>With <HI>Grecian</HI> Spoils, brought <HI>Grecian</HI> Numbers home;</L>
<L>Enrich'd by those <HI>Athenian</HI> Muses more,</L>
<L>Than all the vanquish'd World cou'd yield before.</L>
<L>'Till barb'rous Nations and more barb'rous Times</L>
<L>Debas'd the Majesty of Verse to Rhimes;</L>
<L>Those rude at first: a kind of hobbling Prose:</L>
<L>That limp'd along, and tinckl'd in the close:</L>
<L>But <HI>Italy</HI> reviving from the Trance</L>
<L>Of <HI>Vandal, Goth,</HI> and <HI>Monkish</HI> Ignorance,</L>
<L>With Pauses, Cadence, and well vowell'd Words,</L>
<L>And all the Graces a good Ear affords,</L>
<L>Made Rhyme an Art, and <HI>Dante</HI>'s polish'd Page</L>
<L>Restor'd a silver, not a golden Age:</L>
<L>Then <HI>Petrarch</HI> follow'd, and in him we see,</L>
<L>What Rhyme improv'd in all its height can be;</L>
<L>At best a pleasing Sound, and fair Barbarity;</L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> pursu'd their steps; and <HI>Britain</HI> last</L>

The Muses Empire is restor'd again,</L>

<L>Yet modestly he does his Work survey,</L>
<L>And calls a finish'd Poem an <HI>ESSAY;</HI></L>
<L>For all the needful Rules are scatter'd here;</L>
<L>Truth smoothly told, and pleasantly severe;</L>
<L>(So well is Art disguis'd, for Nature to appear.)</L>
<L>Nor need those Rules, to give Translation light;</L>
<L>His own Example is a Flame so bright;</L>
<L>That he, who but arrives to copy well,</L>
<L>Unguided will advance; unknowing will excel.</L>

<L>Or his own <HI>Virgil</HI> sing a nobler Strain.</L>
<L>How much in him may rising <HI>Ireland,</HI> boast,</L>
<L>How much in gaining him has <HI>Britain</HI> lost!</L>
<L>Their Island in Revenge has ours reclaim'd,</L>

<L>Deriv'd from <HI>British</HI> Channels long ago,</L>
<L>That here his conquering Ancestors were nurst;</L>
<L>And <HI>Ireland</HI> but translated <HI>England</HI> first:</L>

<L>A nobler Quarrel for his Native Earth,</L>
<L>Than what divided <HI>Greece</HI> for <HI>Homer</HI>'s Birth.</L>
<L>To what Perfection will our Tongue arrive,</L>
<L>How will Invention and Translation thrive,</L>
<L>When Authors nobly born will bear their Part,</L>

<LG>
<L>WHile <HI>Satyr</HI> pleas'd, and nothing else was writ,</L>
<L>But pure Ill-nature pass'd for noblest Wit,</L>

<L>But when a generous understanding Muse</L>
<L>Does richer Fruits from happier Soils translate,</L>
<L>W'are sent to <HI>Ireland,</HI> by reverse of Fate.</L>
<L>Yet you, I know, with <HI>Plato</HI> would disdain</L>
<L>To write and equal the <HI>Maeonian</HI> Strain;</L>
<L>If 'twould debauch your Humour so far forth,</L>
<L>To think so mean a Thing enhanc'd your Worth.</L>
<L>For were that Praise, and only that your due,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Virgil</HI> too might claim no less than you;</L>
<L>Tho' that had merited my bare Esteem,</L>
<L>I'd leave to other Pens the single Theme.</L>
<L>But when I saw the Candor of your Mind,</L>
<L>A Muse inur'd to Camps, in Courts refin'd,</L>
<L>A Soul ev'n capable of being a <HI>Friend,</HI></L>
<L>Free from those Follies which the Great attend;</L>
<L><PB REF="18"/>
I grant such Excellence my Soul did fire,</L>
<L>Unable to commend, I will admire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“Happy the Man, when no Concern is nigh,</L>
<L>But Nature's wanton, and his Blood runs high,</L>
<L>Who free from Cares enjoys without controul</L>
<L>His Muse, the darling Mistress of his Soul;</L>
<L>No tedious Court his Appetite destroys,</L>
<L>Nor thoughts of Gain pollute the rapturous Joys.</L>
<L>The Dear <HI>Minerva</HI>'s form'd without a Pain,</L>
<L>And nothing less, could spring from such a Brain</L>
<L>And yet his God-like Pity he imparts</L>
<L>To those that drudge at duty 'gainst their hearts,</L>
<L>And to illiberal Uses wrest the Liberal Arts—”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When I observe the Wonders you explain,</L>
<L>Too much the Ancients you commend—in vain,</L>
<L>In vain you would endeavour to perswade</L>
<L>That all our Laws were in those Archives laid:</L>
<L>That Poetry must ever stand unmov'd,</L>
<L>The only Art Experience han't improv'd.</L>
<L>But grant their Rites were to Religion grown,</L>
<L>Sure they concern no Countries but their own:</L>
<L>For let <HI>Aeneid</HI> pass through others Hands,</L>
<L>The <HI>Aeneid's</HI> self a <HI>Third-rate</HI> Poet stands:</L>
<L>Unfit to reach the Heights that he has flown,</L>
<L>We wisely to our Level bring him down,</L>
<L>Himself had writ less sweet, and less sublime,</L>
<L>In any other Tongue or other Time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, my Lord, on this account I grieve,</L>
<L>To think how different from your self you'll live.</L>
<L><PB REF="19"/>
When this inimitable Piece is shown,</L>
<L>In Languages and Empires yet unknown,</L>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q><P>Two young Shepherds, <HI>Chromis</HI> and <HI>Mnasylus,</HI> having been
often promis'd a Song by <HI>Silenus,</HI> chance to catch him
asleep in this Eclogue; where they bind him Hand and
Foot, and then claim his Promise. <HI>Silenus</HI> finding they
wou'd be put off no longer, begins his Song; in which he
describes the Formation of the Universe, and the Origi∣nal
of Animals, according to the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Philosophy;
and then runs through the most surprising Transformations
which have happen'd in Nature since her Birth. This
Eclogue was design'd as a Complement to <HI>Syro</HI> the <HI>Epi∣curean,</HI>
who instructed <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Varus</HI> in the Princi∣ples
of that Philosophy. <HI>Silenus</HI> acts as Tutor, <HI>Chro∣mis</HI>
and <HI>Mnasylus</HI> as the two Pupils.</P>
<P>My Aim being only to have <HI>Virgil</HI> understood by such who
do not understand <HI>Latin,</HI> and cannot (probably) be ac∣quainted
with some Names and Passages of this Eclogue,
I have directed them by Figures to the <HI>Postscript,</HI> where
they will find the best account that I can give, of all that
is out of the common Road.</P></Q>

<HEAD>REMARQUES on the foregoing
ODE,
To FƲSCƲS ARISTIƲS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HOrace</HI> writes to the same <HI>Aristius Fuscus,</HI> to whom he
address'd the Tenth Epistle of the First Book. He was
a Rhetorician, Grammarian and Poet. There is not any thing
in this Ode by which one may make a Conjecture in what time
it was made; but if this <HI>Lalage</HI> is the same with her in the
Fifth Ode in the Second Book, of which I make no Doubt,
it must have been written much later than the other. No
one has hitherto given any Light to this Passage, let us see
what Conjecture can be made of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fuscus Aristius</HI> was in Love with <HI>Lalage: Horace,</HI> who
was in a strict League of Friendship with him, and who also
lov'd <HI>Lalage,</HI> but rather as the Friend of <HI>Aristius</HI> than as
his Rival, writes him an Account of an Adventure that
happen'd to him, in which <HI>Lalage</HI> had preserv'd him from
an eminent Danger, upon the account of his having sung her
Praises. He attributes his Safety to this Mistress, whom he
looks upon as a Goddess coming to his Succour, in reward for
those Sentiments, as respectful as passionate, which he had
for her. This is the Reason he begins the Ode with descri∣bing
his being innocent, and free from any vicious Intenti∣ons.
This is making a great Compliment to <HI>Lalage,</HI> and at
the same time confirming the Friendship of his Rival, by
preventing his being jealous of him.</P>
<P>This Ode is so Polite and Gallant, as never to be suffici∣ently
commended.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="128"/>
<HI>Lin. 1. Integer vitae, sceler<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sque purus.</HI> These are <HI>Greek</HI>
Phrases, in which the Preposition <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is to be understood;
for let the Grammarians say what they will, <HI>integer</HI> and
<HI>purus</HI> can never govern a Genitive Case.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 2. Mauri jaculis.</HI> He speaks of the Darts of the
<HI>Moors,</HI> by reason those People shot wonderfully from the
Bow.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 3. Venenatis sagittis.</HI> The <HI>Moors</HI> were obliged to poi∣son
their Arrows, to defend themselves from wild Beasts,
which their Country was full of.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 5. Per Syrtes aestuosas.</HI> It is not to be understood here
that which is properly call'd the <HI>Syrtes</HI> of <HI>Africk,</HI> but all
sorts of Places, Sandy and Burning, as those Countries are
over-against the <HI>Syrtes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 6. Inhospitalem Caucasum.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> called <HI>Cau∣casus,
Abaton axenous apanthropon: Horace</HI> has ex∣press'd
it all by this one Word <HI>inhospitalis. Caucasus</HI> is
between the Port <HI>Euxine</HI> and the <HI>Hircanian</HI> Sea, and sig∣nifies
perhaps <HI>The Rampart of</HI> Scythia.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 7. Fabulosus Hydaspes. Hydaspes</HI> is a River in <HI>In∣dia;</HI>
it is now called <HI>Lobchan. Fabulosus</HI> does not signi∣fie
Fabulous, but Renown'd, Famous. <HI>Pliny</HI> has call'd
<HI>Atlas</HI> after the same manner, <HI>Fabulosissimum Africae
Montem,</HI> The most celebrated Mountain of <HI>Africk.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 9. Namque me sylvâ lupus in Sabinâ.</HI> He speaks up∣on
another Occasion after the same manner, That being
one Day asleep in a very retir'd Place the Doves cover'd
him with Leaves of Laurel and Myrtle, and that he slept
there safely in the midst of Vipers and Bears.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 13. Militaris Daunia. Daunia</HI> is properly that Part
of the <HI>Poüille</HI> which juts out into the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea,
where is <HI>Sipontus</HI> and Mount <HI>Gargan,</HI> now call'd Mount
St. <HI>Angelo:</HI> But all <HI>Poüille,</HI> from the <HI>Samnites</HI> even
to <HI>Calabria,</HI> was also called <HI>Daunia,</HI> as is all <HI>Italy.
<PB N="110" REF="129"/>
Horace</HI> uses it here in the second Signification, and calls
it Warlike, by reason it produces very good Soldiers.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 14. In latis aescul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tis. Poüille</HI> is much over-run with
Wood.▪ it is that which is named by the <HI>Greeks Daunia,</HI>
from the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifies Covert,
Thick, Thicket, <HI>Hesych:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Daunia Terra</HI>
is then properly <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a Land of much under-woody
Covert. Mr. <HI>Guget</HI> had written this Remarque on the
Margin of his <HI>Horace,</HI> which the Learned Mr. <HI>Menage</HI>
lent me.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 15. Nec Jubae tellus. Mauritania</HI> is a Part of <HI>Numi∣dia,</HI>
which was under the Government of <HI>Juba,</HI> who had
there so great a number of Lions and Tygers, that the
People were at last forc'd to abandon their Dwellings, and
the tilling of their Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 17. Pone me pigris.</HI> He means, There is no Place so
savage, nor so hideous, that the Thoughts of his Mistress
wou'd not render agreeable to him, and where that God∣dess,
whose powerful Protection he has already experienc'd,
could not send him Succour, and draw him out of all those
Dangers which shou'd threaten his Life. 'Tis on this Ac∣count
he is resolv'd always to love her, and this Love will
be a certain Refuge for him in every Danger. In all the
Books of Chivalry there is nothing more gallant.</P>
<P><HI>Pigris campis.</HI> These four Verses admirably design the two
Polar Zones, which are always environ'd by Ice and kil∣ling
Frosts. Barren Grounds wonderfully express Countries
condemned to a perpetual Sterility, and in a manner de∣priv'd
of the Motion of Life.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 19. Quod latus mundi. Latus</HI> is a very proper Word,
the two Zones being the two Sides of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Malusque Jupiter urget.</HI> This Expression is extreamly fine
and very Poetical. He looks upon those Plants as de∣form'd
by <HI>Jupiter</HI> as a Mark of his Anger: Nothing
<PB N="111" REF="130"/>
cou'd better paint the Inclemency of a Climate: <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
for the Air.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 21. Pone sub curru.</HI> Under the Torrid Zone, between
the two Tropicks.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 22. In terrâ domibus negatâ.</HI> The Ancients believ'd
the Torrid Zone to be intirely uninhabitable, but now eve∣ry
one knows that it is not only inhabited, but also very
temperate thro' the happy Mixture of Warmth by Day,
and the fresh Breezes of the Night.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 23. Dulcè ridentem, dulcè loquentem. Horace</HI> has
here join'd two the most considerable Alurements, the grace
of making her laugh, and speak, agreeably. He has tran∣slated
word for word this fine Passage of <HI>Saph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>

<HEAD>REMARQUES
ON THE
Foregoing ODE.</HEAD>
<P>THis Ode is a Lesson of Morality. <HI>Horace</HI> is perswa∣ding
the <HI>Romans,</HI> that Contempt of Religion, and
Corruption of Manners, were the sole Causes of all the
Misfortunes which had befallen <HI>Rome.</HI> The time when it
was written was after the Defeat of <HI>Antony,</HI> about the
Year of <HI>Rome, DCCXXIV,</HI> or <HI>DCCXXV.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 1. Delicta majorum immeritus lues.</HI> The Pa∣gans
had discover'd this Truth, That Posterity might suf∣fer
for a Crime of their Ancestors; and that 'till such
Crime was aton'd for, the Children of the Offenders were
liable to the Punishment due to their Crime.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 2. Donec templa refeceris.</HI> He means the Tem∣ples
which had been burn'd during the Wars. This points
at <HI>Augustus</HI> in particular: For that Prince was very dili∣gent
in repairing the Temples which had been demolish'd or
burnt, and raising them up again.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 3. Aedesque labentes Deorum.</HI> The difference be∣tween
the <HI>Aedes Sacra,</HI> and the Temple, was this; <HI>Aedes
Sacra</HI> was properly a Sacred Edifice dedicated to some Deity,
but without the Ceremony of the <HI>Augurs;</HI> a <HI>Temple</HI> was a
certain space of Ground set apart by the <HI>Augurs,</HI> but not
hallowed nor consecrated to any of the Gods, as the <HI>Rostra,
Curia Pompeia, Curia Julia, Curia Hostilia.</HI> Hence it
<PB N="163" REF="182"/>
is no hard matter to conceive how one might be turn'd into
the other; that is, how a <HI>Temple</HI> might be made an <HI>Aedes
Sacra,</HI> and en <HI>Aedes Sacra</HI> a <HI>Temple:</HI> there were several
at <HI>Rome,</HI> which were both the one and the other at the
same time.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 4. Et foeda nigro simulacra sumo.</HI> This is a fine
Passage. <HI>Horace,</HI> after he had spoke of the Temples being
burnt, sets before the Eyes of the <HI>Romans</HI> the Statues of
the Gods, all over black with the smoke of the Flames
which had turn'd the Temples to Ashes. Here it is proper
to mention what we find Book I. Ode XXXV. which was
written a little after this:
<Q><L>—Quid intactum nefasti</L>
<L>Liquimus? unde manus juventus</L>
<L>Metu Deorum continuit? quibus</L>
<L>Pepercit aris?—</L></Q>
Profane Wretches! what have we not defil'd? In what
Instance has the Fear of the Gods restrain'd the sacrile∣gious
Hands of our young Soldiers? Is there any one of
the Altars which they have spar'd?</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 5. Diis te minorem quod geris imperas.</HI> Christi∣ans
themselves could not have given better Instructions to
Princes: You are no longer Kings than you own a God above
you, and trust in his Power. This <HI>Horace</HI> writ not so much
for the <HI>Roman</HI> People, as for <HI>Augustus;</HI> of whom, Book <HI>I.</HI>
Ode <HI>XII.</HI> speaking to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> he says,
<Q>Te minor latum reget aequus orbem:</Q>
He will ever own you to be above him; he will content
himself with the Government of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 6. Hinc omne principium.</HI> He says we should be∣gin
all our Works with Prayer to the Gods, and end them
<PB N="164" REF="183"/>
with Thanksgivings. This he recommends as a seasonable
Precept, after so much Misery which had follow'd upon the
Contempt of Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 8. Hesperiae. Italy,</HI> call'd also <HI>Hesperia proxi∣ma,</HI>
to distinguish it from <HI>Spain,</HI> which was call'd <HI>Hesperia
ultima.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 9. Jam bis Monaeses.</HI> Undoubtedly <HI>Horace</HI> speaks
here of the two Victories which the <HI>Parthians</HI> got over the
<HI>Romans,</HI> one under <HI>Monaeses,</HI> and the other under <HI>Paco∣rus</HI>
their Generals. He likewise imputes these Misfortunes
of the <HI>Romans</HI> to the Contempt which they had shewn to
Religion. It is probable that one of these Victories of the
<HI>Parthians,</HI> was the Defeat of <HI>Crassus,</HI> who march'd against
the <HI>Parthians,</HI> in defiance of all the unlucky Omens which
happen'd both at <HI>Rome,</HI> and in the Camp, as <HI>Dion</HI> reports,
Hist. Book <HI>XL.</HI> But the difficulty is to know whether
<HI>Crassus</HI> was defeated by <HI>Monaeses,</HI> who was a chief Man
about King <HI>Orodes.</HI> Historians agree that it was <HI>Surena</HI>
who routed <HI>Crassus.</HI> What is <HI>Surena?</HI> not a proper Name,
but a Title of Dignity, and signifies, <HI>The King's Lieute∣nant:</HI>
Now Monaeses was the second Man of the Empire:
And therefore it is probable that <HI>Surena</HI> was the Title of
<HI>Monaeses.</HI> This Passage of <HI>Horace</HI> is very considerable;
for it is the only one of all Antiquity which gives us light in
this famous Story. The Victory of <HI>Monaeses</HI> over the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
proved fatal to himself: For King <HI>Orodes</HI> growing
jealous of his Glory, put him to Death soon after it. And
therefore that <HI>Monaeses,</HI> who put himself into <HI>Antony</HI>'s
Hands, seventeen Years after this Defeat of <HI>Crassus,</HI> and
whom <HI>Antony</HI> sent back to <HI>Phraates,</HI> either because he sus∣pected
him, or because he hop'd he might do him good Service
about the Prince, was the Son of the former.</P>
<P><HI>Et Pacori manus. Pacorus</HI> was the eldest Son of <HI>Orodes,</HI>
who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent him to ravage <HI>Syria</HI> presently upon the Defeat of
<PB N="165" REF="184"/>
<HI>Crassus:</HI> But he was then so Young, that he had only the
Name of General, and <HI>Ozaces</HI> commanded the Army. He
was sent thither again with <HI>Labienus</HI> two or three Years
after, and did great Service; for he subdued all <HI>Syria,</HI> ex∣cept
<HI>Tyre,</HI> as <HI>Dion</HI> writes, Book <HI>XLVIII.</HI> He was de∣feated
and slain three Years after by <HI>Ventidius, Antony</HI>'s
Lieutenant.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 10. Non auspicatos contudit impetus.</HI> He calls
the Efforts of the <HI>Romans</HI> against the <HI>Parthians, non aus∣picatos,</HI>
unauspicious, contrary to the <HI>Auspicia,</HI> because
<HI>Crassus</HI> had enter'd upon this War with singular Contempt
of those Divine Tokens. First of all, when he left <HI>Rome,</HI>
the Tribune <HI>Ateius</HI> having opposed his Departure, and not
being able to stop him, convey'd a Chassing-dish to the
City Gate, thro' which he was to pass; and as <HI>Crassus</HI>
went out he cast some Perfumes upon the Fire, and then
threw it about, with horrible Curses and Imprecations. This
<HI>Crassus</HI> minded not, but went on his Way. In like manner
he slighted all the unlucky Presages that befell him. And
Lastly, when the Soothsayers let him know, that the Tokens
in the Sacrifices were unfortunate, he took no notice of what
they said.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 11. Et adjecisse praedam torquibus.</HI> He says,
that the <HI>Parthians</HI> enlarged the Chains about their Necks
with the Gold and Silver which they had taken from the
<HI>Romans.</HI> Here it must be remember'd, that the <HI>Parthians</HI>
wore Chains about their Necks, like the old <HI>Gauls</HI> and
<HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 12. Renidet.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, he laughs. So <HI>Catullus,</HI> Od<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><PB N="166" REF="185"/>
Egnatius <HI>is always laughing, because he has white
Teeth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 14. Delevit urbem Dacus &amp; Aethiops.</HI> This is
not to be understood of two several times, as though the <HI>Da∣cians</HI>
and <HI>Ethiopians</HI> had like to have taken <HI>Rome</HI> one
after another: <HI>Horace</HI> speaks here of the Forces of <HI>Antony</HI>
and <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> who had a design on the City, as he says,
Book <HI>I.</HI> Ode <HI>XXXVII.</HI></P>
<Q><L>—Dum capitolio</L>
<L>Regina dementes ruinas,</L>
<L>Funus &amp; imperio parabat.</L></Q>
<P><HI>While the mad Queen threaten'd final Destruction to
the Capitol and Empire.</HI> It must be noted that the <HI>Ethi∣opians</HI>
and <HI>Dacians</HI> composed a great part of <HI>Antony</HI>'s
Troops.</P>
<P><HI>Aethiops.</HI> The Troops of <HI>Cleopatra, Ethiopians</HI> and
<HI>Egyptians;</HI> for <HI>Egypt</HI> was comprehended under the general
Name of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 15. Hic classe formidatus.</HI> For the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were
most of <HI>Antony</HI> 's Forces for Sea Service.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 16. Ille missilibus melior sagittis.</HI> This is the <HI>Da∣cian.</HI>
The <HI>Northern</HI> People were generally good Archers;
and <HI>Strabo</HI> says their Arms were Sword, Buckler, Bow and
Quiver.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 17. Foecunda culpae secula.</HI> The Corruption of
Manners in <HI>Horace</HI>'s Time cannot be better exprest than
in this Epigram of <HI>Catullus:</HI>
<Q><L>Consule Pompeio primum duo, Cinna, solebant</L>
<L>Moechi. Illi, ah! facto Consule nunc iterum</L>
<L>Manserunt duo, sed creverunt millia in unum</L>
<L>Singulum, foecundum semen adulterio.</L></Q>
<PB N="167" REF="186"/>
Cinna, <HI>in the first Consulate of</HI> Pompey, <HI>you could see but
two Adulterers at</HI> Rome. <HI>In his second likewise you could
find but these two. But since that, each of these has
produced a thousand. O prolifick Adultery!</HI> By the two
Adulterers <HI>Catullus</HI> means <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Mamurra.</HI> A little
after this Ode was written, <HI>Augustus</HI> published the <HI>Julian</HI>
law, to prevent Adulteries.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 19. Hoc fonte derivata clades.</HI> It is very remar∣kable,
that <HI>Horace</HI> here ascribes all the Calamities which
had happen'd to <HI>Rome,</HI> and all the Civil Wars, to Adulte∣ries
only. In this he follows the Doctrine of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI>
who taught, that nothing was of more mischievous Conse∣quence
than confounding Families, and grafting Aliens upon
them by Adultery.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 21. Motus.</HI> As the <HI>Greeks</HI> use <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to move ones
self, for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to dance, so the <HI>Latins</HI> use <HI>moveri</HI> and
<HI>motus</HI> for the same. Thus <HI>Horace</HI> in another place;
<Q><L>Ut festis matrona moveri jussa Diebus.</L>
<L><HI>And again</HI>—ut qui</L>
<L>Nunc Satyrum, nunc agrestem Cyclopa movetur.</L></Q>
And <HI>Virgil, dant motus incompositos. Cicero</HI> has the
same Phrase in his third Paradox: <HI>Histrio si paulo se mo∣vit
extra numerum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ionicos. Ionian</HI> Dances were the most lascivious of any.
For the World did not afford a more voluptuous People than
the <HI>Ionians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 22. Matura virgo.</HI> That is, a Maid who is mar∣riageable;
for among the old <HI>Romans</HI> it was counted a Re∣proach
for a Maid of that Age to dance; this Exercise
being permitted to none but young Children.</P>
<P><HI>Fingitur artubus. Fingere</HI> signifies the same as <HI>formare,
componere,</HI> to fashion, to fit. It is a Term borrow'd from
the Dancing-Schools, <HI>Horace</HI> says, that at that Age the
<PB N="168" REF="187"/>
Maid was still practising to make her Joynts supple, that she
might succeed the better in her lascivious Movements. <HI>Lambin</HI>
has read in some Manuscripts, <HI>fingitur artibus.</HI> If that be
the true reading, <HI>Horace</HI> would say that the Maids learn'd
all the Tricks, and practised all the inveigling Arts, which
common Strumpets made use of in their Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 24. De tenero meditatur ungui.</HI> This is a <HI>Greek</HI>
Proverb, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>de tenero ungui, de tene∣ris
unguiculis,</HI> from ones tender Age. <HI>Tully</HI> in an Epistle
to <HI>Lentulus,</HI> says: <HI>Sed praesta te eum qui mihi à teneris,
ut Graeci dicunt, unguiculis es cognitus. Let me find
you the same Man as I have always known you to be e∣ver
since you was a little Child.</HI> Observe here how <HI>Horace</HI>
uses the Preposition <HI>de</HI> instead of <HI>à.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 25. Juniores quaerit adulteros. Juniores</HI> may sig∣nifie
here simply, the youngest, or such as were younger than
their Husbands, or new ones; as Book <HI>I.</HI> Ode <HI>XXXIII.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 26. Inter mariti vina.</HI> A Passage of <HI>Ovid</HI> may
explain this, in his first Book <HI>de arte.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Ergo ubi contigerint positi tibi munera Bacchi,</L>
<L>Atque erit in socii foemina parte tori, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P>When you are at the Table with your Mistress, and she
sits upon the same Couch with you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 28. Gaudia.</HI> This word must not be chang'd. <HI>Ovid</HI>
has it in the same sense, <HI>de arte</HI> Lib. <HI>III.</HI></P>
<Q>Gaudia nec cupidis vestra negate viris.</Q>
<P><HI>And</HI> Tibullus:

of <HI>Augustus,</HI> in the <HI>LXIXth</HI> Chapter of his Life.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="188"/>
<HI>Non sine conscio.</HI> This is opposed to <HI>raptim. Horace</HI> is
not satisfied to describe the Debaucheries of Women only; but
to strike more Horror, he adds, that their Husbands consented;
which is the highest degree of Lewdness.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 30. Seu vocat institor. Institor</HI> is properly a Factor

here <HI>Horace</HI> puts it for the Owner of the Vessel, the trading
Merchant. Now there was great Trade between <HI>Italy</HI> and
<HI>Spain:</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> furnish'd <HI>Rome</HI> with Wine, and car∣ried
back Goods from thence in exchange.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 32. Dedecorum pretiosus emptor.</HI> The Word <HI>pre∣tiosus</HI>
here is a very ingenious, pertinent Epithet: for it signi∣fies
one who buys dear, who spares for nothing; much the same
as <HI>damnosus. Horace</HI> handsomely describes the Avarice of
the Women in his Time, who preferr'd Merchants and Ship-Masters
for their Gallants, only because they paid better than
others.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 33. Non his juventus orta parentibus.</HI> Here he
illustrates what he hinted at the 17th Verse, that frequent A∣dulteries
had spoil'd good Families, so that one might see a
great difference between the <HI>Romans</HI> of his Time, and their
brave Ancestors, who vanquish'd <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI>
and <HI>Antiochus</HI> by Sea and Land.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 35. Pyrrhumque. Pyrrhus</HI> was King of <HI>Epirus,</HI>
and descended from <HI>Achilles.</HI> He routed the Consul <HI>Laevinus,</HI>
near <HI>Heraclea;</HI> but soon after he was overthrown by <HI>Fabri∣cius</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="189"/>

a blow of a Tile, as he was besieging <HI>Antigonus</HI> in <HI>Argos,</HI> in
the Year of <HI>Rome CCCCLXXX.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 36. Ingentem Antiochum. Antiochus</HI> was King of
<HI>Syria. Aemilius Regillus</HI> beat him by Sea, and <HI>L. Scipio</HI> by
Land: At last he was slain by his own People, in the Year of
<HI>Rome DLXVII.</HI></P>
<P>Lin. 37. Sed rusti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orum mascula militum. <HI>The</HI> Ro∣man
<HI>Troops were composed of Rusticks, Countrymen, such as
they raised for the most part in the Territory of the</HI> Marsians,
<HI>in</HI> Apulia, <HI>and among the</HI> Samnites. Varro <HI>has a fine Re∣mark
upon this, in the beginning of his Book of Husbandry.</HI>
Viri magni nostri majores non sine causâ praeponebant
rusticos Romanos urbanis; un ruri enim qui in villâ vi∣vunt
ignaviores quam qui in agro versantur in aliquo o∣pere
faciundo: Sic qui in oppido sederent, quam qui rura
colerent, desidiores putabant. It is not without Reason
that those great Men, our Ancestors, preferr'd the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
in the Country before those in the City; for as in
the Country itself, those whose Business lies within Doors
are lazier than those who stir abroad and work in the
Field; so they reckon'd that those who led a sedentary
Life in the City, were not so fit for Service as those that
follow'd Husbandry. <HI>The same Author has something fuller
yet, in the beginning of his</HI> IIId <HI>Book.</HI> Itaque non sine
causà majores nostri ex urbe in agris redigebant cives
suos, quod &amp; in pace à rusticis Romanis alebantur, &amp;
in bello ab his tutabantur. Our Forefathers were in the
right, to send Citizens abroad and settle them in Coun∣try
places; because the <HI>Romans</HI> in the Country furnish'd
the City with Provisions in time of Peace, and defend∣ed
it in War.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="190"/>
<HI>Lin. 38. Sabellis docta ligonibus.</HI> Which is as much as
to say, that the Soldiers were <HI>Samnites.</HI> For <HI>Sabellus</HI> is a
diminutive of <HI>Samnis,</HI> as <HI>Scabellum</HI> of <HI>Scamnum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 40. Severae matris ad arbitrium.</HI> This is a good
Description of a painful Mother who makes her Children work,
and will not be pleased if they don't bring home good Loads of
Fuel at Night. He has the same Thought again, Book <HI>V.</HI>
Ode <HI>II.</HI> The <HI>Samnite</HI> Women were so industrious, that they
managed the Farms for their Husbands, and left them Nothing
to do. See <HI>Columella</HI>'s Preface to his <HI>XIth</HI> Book, where he
opposes the pains-taking Women of the first Times, to the fine,
lazy, voluptuous Dames of his own Age.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 41. Sol ubi montium mutaret umbras.</HI> This <HI>mu∣tare</HI>
of <HI>Horace,</HI> is the same with <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>duplicare.</HI> It may
be explain'd of the changing of Place. For when the Sun sets,
the Shadow is not in the same place where it was three Hours
before.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 42. Et juga demeret bobus.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> have
happily exprest this by one Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which <HI>Tul∣ly</HI>

<P><HI>Lin. 43. Amicum tempus.</HI> He calls the Evening a Friend
to Labourers, because it puts an end to their Days Work.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 45. Damnosa. Damnosus,</HI> as I have already obser∣ved,

fitly applied to Time, which is likewise call'd <HI>tempus edax.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 46. Aetas parentum.</HI> Here I admire the Poet's Art,
who has said so much of four Generations in three short Ver∣ses.

Muretus</HI> says farther, that both these Poets have borrow'd the
Thought from <HI>Homer,</HI> who writes that few Children are like
their Father; that he observed a great many to be worse, but
rarely found one better. But it well deserves to be noted, that
<HI>Horace</HI> grounded his Remark upon true History of the Times
for the three first Generations, and that he prophesied truly of
the fourth, as is easie to prove, by comparing the Reign of <HI>Ti∣berius</HI>

<HEAD>Preface to the Art of Poetry.</HEAD>
<P>I Have seldom known a Trick succeed, and will
put none upon the Reader; but tell him plainly
that I think it could never be more seasonable than
now to lay down such Rules, as if they be observ'd,
will make Men write more correctly, and judge
more discreetly: But <HI>Horace</HI> must be read seriously
or not at all, for else the Reader wom't be the bet∣ter
for him, and I shall have lost my Labour. I
have kept as close as I could, both to the Meaning,
and the Words of the Author, and done nothing
but what I believe he would forgive if he were a∣live;
and I have often ask'd my self that Question.
I know this is a Field,</P>
<P><HI>Per quem magnus equos</HI> Auruncae <HI>flexit Alumnus.</HI>
But with all the Respect due to the Name of <HI>Ben.
Johnson,</HI> to which no Man pays more Veneration
than I; it cannot be deny'd, that the Constraint of
Rhime, and a literal Translation (to which <HI>Horace</HI>
in this Book declares himself an Enemy) has made
him want a Comment in many Places.</P>
<P>My chief Care has been to Write intelligibly, and
where the <HI>Latin</HI> was obscure, I have added a
Line or two to explain it.</P>
<P>I am below the Envy of the Criticks, but if I
durst, I would beg them to remember, that <HI>Horace</HI>
ow'd his Favour and his Fortune to the Character
given of him by <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Varius,</HI> that <HI>Fundanius</HI>
and <HI>Pollio</HI> are still valued by what <HI>Horace</HI> says of
them, and that in their Golden Age, there was a
good Vnderstanding among the Ingenious, and those
who were the most Esteem'd were the best Natur'd.</P>

<HEAD>OF THIS

<BYLINE>By EDMVND WALLER, Es{que}</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L><HI>ROME</HI> was not better by her <HI>Horace</HI> taught,</L>
<L>Than we are here, to comprehend his Thought:</L>
<L>The Poet writ to Noble <HI>Piso,</HI> there,</L>
<L>A Noble <HI>Piso</HI> does instruct us here,</L>
<L>Gives us a Pattern in his flowing Stile,</L>
<L>And with rich Precepts does oblige our Isle,</L>
<L><HI>Britain,</HI> whose Genius is in Verse express'd</L>
<L>Bold and sublime, but negligently dress'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Horace</HI> will our superfluous Branches prune,</L>
<L>Give us new Rules, and set our Harp in Tune,</L>
<L><PB N="177" REF="195"/>
Direct us how to back the winged Horse,</L>
<L>Favour his Flight, and moderate his Force.</L>
<L>Though Poets may of Inspiration boast,</L>
<L>Their Rage ill govern'd, in the Clouds is lost;</L>
<L>He that proportion'd Wonders can disclose,</L>
<L>At once his Fancy and his Judgment shows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Chast moral Writing we may learn from hence,</L>
<L>Neglect of which no Wit can recompence;</L>
<L>The Fountain which from <HI>Helicon</HI> proceeds,</L>
<L>That sacred Stream should never water Weeds,</L>
<L>Nor make the Crop of Thorns and Thistles grow,</L>
<L>Which Envy or perverted Nature sow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well-sounding Verses are the Charm we use,</L>
<L>Heroick Thoughts, and Virtue to infuse;</L>
<L>Things of deep Sense we may in Prose unfold,</L>
<L>But they move more, in lofty Numbers told;</L>
<L><PB N="178" REF="196"/>
By the loud Trumpet, which our Courage aids,</L>
<L>We learn that Sound, as well as Sense persuades.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Muse's Friend, unto himself severe,</L>
<L>With silent Pity looks on all that Err;</L>
<L>But where a brave, a publick Action shines,</L>
<L>That he rewards with his Immortal Lines;</L>
<L>Whether it be in Council or in Fight,</L>
<L>His Country's Honour is his chief Delight;</L>
<L>Praise of great Acts, he scatters as a Seed,</L>
<L>Which may the like, in coming Ages, breed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here taught the Fate of Verses, always priz'd</L>
<L>With Admiration, or as much despis'd,</L>
<L>Men will be less indulgent to their Faults,</L>
<L>And Patience have to cultivate their Thoughts;</L>
<L>Poets lose half the Praise they should have got,</L>
<L>Could it be known what they discreetly blot,</L>
<L><PB N="179" REF="197"/>
Finding new Words, that to the ravish'd Ear,</L>
<L>May like the Language of the Gods appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such as of old, wise Bards employ'd, to make</L>
<L>Vnpolish'd Men their wild Retreats forsake;</L>
<L>Law-giving Heroes, fam'd for taming Brutes,</L>
<L>And raising Cities with their charming Lutes:</L>
<L>For rudest Minds with Harmony were caught,</L>
<L>And civil Life was by the Muses taught.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So wand'ring Bees would perish in the Air,</L>
<L>Did not a Sound, proportion'd to their Ear,</L>
<L>Appease their Rage, invite them to the Hive,</L>
<L>Vnite their Force, and teach them how to thrive,</L>
<L>To rob the Flow'rs, and to forbear the Spoil,</L>
<L>Preserv'd in Winter by their Summer's Toil,</L>
<L>They give us Food, which may with Nectar Vie,</L>
<L>And Wax that does the absent Sun supply.</L>

<HEAD>REMARKS
ON
HORACE'S Art of Poetry.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N Asia, Greece, Macedo∣nia</HI>
and <HI>Egypt,</HI> there were,
Time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Mind, se∣lect
Assemblies of Per∣sons
to examine the
Writings of the Poets
and Orators. <HI>Augustus</HI>
erected such a Society
at <HI>Rome,</HI> and encourag'd them by Re∣wards
and Honours. He assign'd them
the <HI>Temple</HI> and <HI>Library</HI> of <HI>Apollo</HI> to
meet at. And to this the Assemblies
of Learned Men, which we call <HI>Acade∣mie.</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owe their Origin. <HI>Theodorus Marcilus,</HI>
who however does not tell us his Au∣thority,
says the Number of this <HI>Ro∣man
Academy</HI> was Twenty, of which
Five or Seven can only be term'd <HI>Judges.</HI>
He goes so far as to give us the Names
of 'em, and whether he is right or not,
he cou'd not have nam'd better Men
than his Society was compos'd of. As
<HI>Virgil, Varius, Tarpa, Mecaenas, Plotius,
Valgius, Octavius, Fuscus,</HI> the two <HI>Viscus's,
Rollio,</HI> the two <HI>Messala's,</HI> the two <HI>Bilulus's,
Servius, Fulvius, Tibullus, Piso</HI> the Father,
and <HI>Horace.</HI> The only Foundation I know
for this Assertion of his, is the End of
the Xth Satyr of the First Book. He is not
satisfy'd to give us a List of this <HI>Academy;</HI>
he will have it that it was on Account of
<HI>Horace</HI>'s being a Member of it, that he
was put upon Writing <HI>The Art of Poetry,</HI>
and Collecting all the Rules, and all the
Judgments that were made in the <HI>Society.</HI>
I wish with all my Heart this was so,
because what Mr. <HI>La Bruyere,</HI> says of
such Assemblies would not then be true,
that they never produc'd any Work which
was Entire and Perfect in its Kind. But
whether <HI>Horace</HI> wrote this Piece as a
Publick Matter, or Private, his Design
was to give the <HI>Romans</HI> an <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI>
that should take in all that <HI>Aristotle,
Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, Zeno, Democritus</HI> and <HI>Neoptolemus</HI>
of <HI>Paros</HI> had written on the Subject. Nay
some will have it, that 'tis almost no∣thing
else but a Compilation of the most
Excellent Rules of the Latter. For <HI>Por∣phyrius</HI>
writes, <HI>In quem librum conjecit
praecepta Neop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olemi de Arte Poetica, non
quidem omnia, sed eminentissima.</HI> Horace
<HI>has in this Book set down</HI> Neoptolemus'<HI>s
Rules for the Art of Poetry, not all indeed,
but the most Excellent of them.</HI> As he did
not write it regularly, nor observe any
<PB N="248" REF="265"/>
other Order than Chance threw in his
Way; so there is no Method, and
no Connection of Parts in this Trea¦tise,
which seems not to be finish'd: He
having not Time to give the last Hand
to it; or what is more likely, not being
willing to be at the Trouble. Those
who believe it would be more perfect
if his Verses were Transpos'd are mista∣ken.
All we can do, in my Opinion,
is to mark the Void Spaces, and to divide
the Heads without changing the Form.
This was Monsieur <HI>Le Fevre</HI>'s Judgment
The want of Connection is not without
its Graces, especially in Rules, which
should be free, and have nothing in
them either Loose or Languishing. The
Order <HI>Heinsius</HI> would put it in, seems
on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to she<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Beauty of the Disor∣der
in which <HI>Horace</HI> left it.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Aristotle's Art of Poetry,</HI> I
know of no Piece of Criticism in Anti∣quity,
which is more Excellent than this.
All his Decisions are so many Truth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
drawn from the Nature of the Things
he treats of. <HI>Julius Scaliger</HI> err'd very
much against good Sense and Reason, in
what he said of this Work. <HI>Will you
know,</HI> says he, <HI>what I think of</HI> Horace'<HI>s</HI>
Art of Poetry? '<HI>Tis an Art taught with∣out
Art. De Arte quae res quod Sentiam
Quid? Equidem qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d de Arte sine Arte

preceding Ones yet <HI>Horace</HI> gives it the Ti∣tle
of <HI>The Art of Poetry, De Arte Poetica,</HI>
to distinguish it from the Others, in
which he treated of this Art only Oc¦casionally.
The Antiquity of this Title
is not to be doubted of, since <HI>Quintilian</HI>
quotes it in the IIId Chapter of his
VIIIth Book, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enim tole est monstrum

general and necessary Rule, on which all
the rest are founded, which is the Sim∣plicity
and Unity of the Subject, in the
D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>position, the Ornaments, and the Stile.
He could not render the Faults commit¦ted

The Answer of III Poets, who
will not subject themselves to the Rules
of their Art. <HI>Poets</HI> and <HI>Painters,</HI> say they,
may do what they please, nothing is
too daring for them. They abuse the
Privilege of Poetry, and thus excuse their
most Monstrous Fancies, and most Ex∣travagant
Dreams. That Privilege is of
great Extent, 'tis true; <HI>Ovid</HI> talks of
the <HI>Faecunda Licentia Vatum;</HI> and <HI>Lucian</HI>
asserts, that Painters and Poets are not
accountable for their Fancies; but <HI>Horace</HI>
is shewing us what Bounds they ought
to set to this Licence.</P>
<P>11. <HI>Scimus.] Horace</HI>'s Answer to the
Bad Poets after having said, <HI>I know</HI> the
Privilege of Poetry, he would go on
<HI>sed non,</HI> but he's interrupted by the same
Poets, who proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Et hanc veniam petimus damusque vt
cissim.</HI>] My Opinion of this Verse is dis∣cover'd
in the preceding Remark. Some
will have it, that <HI>Horace</HI> continues his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswer without Interruption, that as a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oet he says, <HI>Hanc veniam petimus, I de∣mand
this Permission;</HI> As a Critick, he
adds, <HI>Damusque vicissim, I give it in my
Turn.</HI> This agrees with the Old Com∣mentator,
who writes, <HI>petimus quidem ut
Poetae, damus autem ut Critici.</HI> But how cou'd
<HI>Horace</HI> demand Permission to use this
Liberty, when he never look'd upon
himself as a Poet? There must be a
Mistake in this Passage. After he had said
<HI>Scim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> he is interrupted, as is ob∣serv'd
before, by the III Poets. <HI>Et hanc
veniam petimus damusque vicissim. We
claim the Privilege, as we give it to others.</HI>
He cannot mean himself, he being no
Poet, as he declares afterwards, <HI>Nil scri∣bens
ipse.</HI> Besides the Dialogue is more a∣greeable,
more lively; and more like
<HI>Horace</HI>'s Manner.</P>
<P>12. <HI>Sed non ut placidis cocant immitia.]
Horace</HI>'s Answer, We give you the Pri∣vilege
you Demand, but on Condition you
do not abuse it. I, a long Time, thought
the First Thirteen Verses of this Epistle
were a Sort of Dedication and Preface,
and that <HI>Horace,</HI> to excuse the Disorder
in which he left it, wrote to the <HI>Piso's;
The Book I address to you is like the Pi∣cture
I have been speaking of,</HI> In which I
was mistaken. He would then certainly
have written it <HI>Fore Librum hunc similem.</HI>
Add to this, that not looking upon Him∣self
to be a Poet, nor on his <HI>Art of
Poetry</HI> as a Work of Importance, 'tis
not likely he should go about to excuse
its Want of Regularity; it being nei∣ther
Necessary not Possible to observe it
in such a Treatise as this. The Discove∣ry
of the Dialogue between the Bad
Poets and <HI>Horace</HI> confirms me in the
Opinion that I was mistaken, and my
Reason has convinc'd several good Jud∣ges
of the same Mistake.</P>
<P><HI>Ʋt placidis cocant immitia.</HI>] Painters and
Poets are only Imitators, and are to paint
only what is or what may be; there be∣ing
nothing else that can be imitated.
But they have both often abus'd their
Art, and forsaken probable Idea's for
Monstrous Imaginations. <HI>Vitruvius</HI> com∣plains
of this Fauit in Painters, in the
Vth Chapter of his VIIth Book: From
hence proceed <HI>Grotesques,</HI> which are not to
<PB N="250" REF="267"/>
be compar'd to a Regular Figure. This
Rule of <HI>Horace</HI> is one of the most Im∣portant
in the <HI>Art of Poetry;</HI> never to
join Incompatible Subjects, nor offend
against Nature, Verisimility and Truth.</P>
<P>14. <HI>Inceptis gravibus plerumque &amp; mag∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
profeffis.</HI>] He comes from the general
Rule to Particulars, and gives an Example
of the Vitious Variety which he con∣demns.
He chuses One that's the least
shocking, but tis by so much the more
Dangerous <HI>Vice,</HI> by how much it slides
in under an Appearance of Virtue. He
is speaking of Descriptions, a Snare
which is almost inevitable to little
Genius's. <HI>Horace</HI> shews us how apt Poets
are to fall into the <HI>Ridiculous</HI> by this
Means: From Grave and Serious Be∣ginnings,
which promise Sublime and
Marvellous things, they descend into
a shining Description of an Wood, an
Altar of <HI>Diana,</HI> a River, the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
the Rainbow; Their Descriptions
are stirch'd together like Patch-Work.
Their Patches, indeed, are Purple, but
are Childish and Extravagant, because ill
plac'd. Writers must never abandon
themselves to such Digressious, let them
be of what Nature soever, when their
Design calls them elsewhere.</P>
<P>16. <HI>Quem lucus &amp; ara Diana.</HI>] I be∣lieve,
with <HI>Theodorus Marcilus,</HI> he speaks
of the Wood and Altar of <HI>Aricia,</HI> pre∣tended
to have been Built by <HI>Orestes,</HI>
who there Consecrated the Statue of
<HI>Diana Tauricae,</HI> which, when he had kill'd
King <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as,</HI> he brought from <HI>Scythia.</HI>
The Poets thought this a fine Subject for
Descriptions. It took in <HI>Orestes, Diana
Taurica,</HI> her Sacrifices in <HI>Scythia,</HI> and at
<HI>Aricia,</HI> with the odd Custom in her
Temple. There cou'd be but One Priest
and he a Fugitive. He must with
his own Hand kill the Priest his Pre∣decessor,
if he would get into his Place.
For which Reason the Priest who held
it was always Arm'd to defend himself.
<HI>Ovid</HI> calls this Temple of <HI>Aricia,</HI> a King∣dom
acquir'd by the Sword, and with a
Criminal Hand,
<Q>Pertaque per gladi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s regna n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cente man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</Q></P>
<P>18. <HI>Aut flumen Rhenum.] Horace</HI>
had without doubt been often tir'd with
the Description of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in the
Poems written on <HI>Augustus</HI>'s Victories on
that Side. The Bad Poets never omit
plunging into that River, as <HI>Alpinus,</HI> of
whom he speaks in the Xth Satyr of the
Ist Book.</P>
<Q><L>Turgidus Alpinus jugulat dum Memnona,
dumque</L>
<L>Diffingit Rheni luteum caput, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>Aut pluviu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> describitur Arcus.</HI>] The
Rainbow is as likely as any thing to
turn a Wretched Poet's Brain. The
Wonderful Mixture of its Colours are
with them so worthy of Admiration,
that they let no Opportunity slip to de∣scribe
it; few imitating in this the Dis∣cretion
of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil. Homer</HI> says
not above One Word of her, and <HI>Virgil</HI>
but Two Lines,
<Q>Ergo Iris croceis per coelum roscida pennis
Mille trahens varios adverso sole Colores
Advolat.</Q></P>
<P>A Description as Rapid as <HI>Iris</HI>'s Flight.</P>
<P>19. <HI>Et fortasse cupressum scis simulare.</HI>]
The Young Poets and Painters began the
Practice of their Arts with Descriptions
and Imitations of Cypress.</P>
<P>20 <HI>Si fractis enatat exspes navibus.</HI>]
What's the Painting of Cypress to that
of a Wreck? What are Descriptions in
Poetry, when Illustrious Actions are the
Subject of the Song? <HI>Horace</HI> alludes to
those <HI>ex vot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Pictures, made by such as
had escap'd Shipwreck.</P>
<P>21. <HI>Amphora coepit institui, currente ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a
cur Ʋrceus exit?</HI>] An Image taken from
a Potter, who commonly began his Trade
by making little Pots called <HI>Ʋrceos,</HI> and
ended with a great Pitcher call'd <HI>Am∣phora,</HI>
which was his Master-piece. To
begin with an <HI>Amphora</HI> and end with an
<HI>Ʋrceus,</HI> is like a Poet who after a Mag∣nificent
Beginning, falls and is lost in
Descriptions. <HI>Amphora</HI> answers to <HI>in∣caeptis
gravibus,</HI> and <HI>Ʋrceus</HI> to <HI>purpureus
pannus.</HI></P>
<P>23. <HI>Denique sit quodvis simplex duntaxat
&amp; unum.</HI>] The Rule that results from
what he has said. Simplicity and Unity
are entirely opposite to the Fault he has
<PB N="251" REF="268"/>
been speaking of. Descriptions, which
have no immediate Relation to the Sub∣ject,
corrupt and destroy them. <HI>Homer,
Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Sophocles</HI>'s Descriptions are
all necessary, and well introduc'd.</P>
<P>25 <HI>Decipimur specie recti.</HI>] This is
not a new Rule, but the general Reason
of the Fault he has been explaining:
We are deceiv'd by Appearance in the
Beauties of Art, as well as those of Na∣ture;
a Poet thinks to adorn his Subject
by Descriptions, and he spoils it. <HI>Brevis
esse laboro, obscurus fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> &amp;c. are Exam∣ples
to confirm this Proposition.</P>
<P><HI>Brevis esse,</HI> &amp;c.] Brevity is certainly
one of the great Beauties of Discourse;
but so near a Neighbour to Obscurity,
that it is very difficult in following the
one, not to fall into the other. Per∣spicuity
is the principal Virtue, <HI>Virtus
prima perspicuitas.</HI></P>
<P>26. <HI>Sectantem lavia nervi deficiunt.</HI>] As
by endeavouring to make strong Verses
and Expressions, an Author renders
them hard and rough, so by endeavou∣ring
to polish, he very often weakens
them.</P>
<P>27. <HI>Professus grandia turget.</HI>] They
fall into this Error, that stretch what is
<HI>Grand</HI> too far; as <HI>Gorgias,</HI> in calling
<HI>Xerxes</HI> the <HI>Jupiter of the Persians,</HI> and he
who call'd <HI>Brutus</HI> the <HI>Sun of Asia;</HI> they
become Bombast, when they study to be
<HI>Great.</HI></P>
<P>28. <HI>Serpit Humi tutus nimium timi∣dusque
procellae.</HI>] Poetry is a Sea, and
those who Sail on it, if they are wise,
will never venture too far from the Shoar,
nor come too near it. <HI>Horace</HI>'s Expres∣sion
seems rather to be borrow'd from
<HI>Birds,</HI> who creep on the Ground, when
the Winds and Storms make 'em afraid
of rising into the Air.</P>
<P>29. <HI>Qui variare cupit rem prodigialiter
unam.</HI>] This Verse proves▪ that whatever he
has already said is only the Consequence
of the same Rule. For he returns to
it again, by shewing, That those who to
arrive at the <HI>Marvellous,</HI> which he here
terms <HI>Prodigious,</HI> vary a Subject, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack to it pompous Descriptions, form
Monsters. <HI>Omnia Monstra faciunt,</HI> says
<HI>Catullus.</HI> 'Tis as if they should place
Dolphins in the Woods, and Boats in
the Sea. The word <HI>prodigialiter</HI> is taken
here in a good Sense, as are often out
Words <HI>Prodigious</HI> and <HI>Prodigiously.</HI> For
it must not be imagin'd that it refers to
<HI>Appingit.</HI></P>
<P>31. <HI>In vitium ducit culpa fuga.</HI>] The
fear of falling into one Vice, is fre∣quently
the Occasion of our falling into
greater than that which we endea∣vour'd
to avoid. We would shun a tedi∣ous
Uniformity, and we are guilty of a
monstrous Mixture: The reason is, we
make this Mixture without Art, which
can only teach us to do it, and not of∣fend
Uniformity. Our best Examples
are <HI>Homer, Theocritus,</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>32. <HI>Aemilium circa ludum faber I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us.]
Horace</HI> here means a certain Statuary,
who liv'd at the Bottom of the <HI>Circus,</HI>
near a Place call'd the <HI>Hall of</HI> Aemilius;
because a Fencing-Master, nam'd <HI>Aemi∣lius
Lentulus,</HI> kept his Gladiators there.
This Statuary gave a great deal of grace
and easiness to Hair, and finish'd the
Nails admirably; but take his Statues
all together they were wretched Pieces,
there being no Connection of the Parts,
nor that Agreement which, like the
Soul, adds Life and Action to the Fi∣gure,
and is the All in All in a Sta∣tue.
'Tis the same with Poets, who
know not how to make any Thing but
a Description, to express a Sentiment,
or make a strong Comparison, with all
which they are at the best but misera∣ble
Poets.</P>
<P>34. <HI>Ponere totum.] Ponere, to put,</HI>
for <HI>to do to make,</HI> as in the <HI>Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>:</HI>
He says elsewhere, <HI>Solers nunc
hominem ponere nunc deum;</HI> and <HI>totum</HI>
is what we call <HI>All together,</HI> a Term pro∣perly
us'd in Paining and Sculpture,
when Pictures or other Pieces, consisting
of many Figures, are so dispos'd, that
the different Parts agree to form one
single and the same Whole, and repre∣sent
one single Object. 'Tis also made
use of in Pieces where there is but one
Figure, either in Sculpture or Painting,
the different Parts of which ought to
have so natural a Connection with each
other, that they may form but one
single and the same Body. 'Tis not
enough that the Artist knows how to
make an Head, an Arm, a Foot, he
must understand how to put the whole
<PB N="252" REF="269"/>
together, so that it may be one single
Figure, which has nothing maim'd in
it, but is every where equally well de∣sign'd
and finish'd.</P>
<P>36. <HI>Quam pravo vivere Naso.</HI> If a
Man has an ugly Nose, he will be ugly,
tho' all the other Parts of his Face are
beautiful; and a Poet, if all the other
parts of his Poem be fine, will be an ill
Poet, if he offends against Simplicity
and Unity.</P>
<P>38. <HI>Sumite materiam, vestris, qui scri∣bitis
aequam Viribus.</HI>] Every Poet who
makes choice of a Subject that is not
proportionable to his Strength offends
against the Art of Poetry; and 'tis im∣possible
he should succeed. See the Re∣marks
on the 26th Chapter of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s
Art of Poetry.</P>
<P>39. <HI>Et versate diu quid ferre recu∣se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI>]
A Man must not presently con∣clude,
that because he has by Chance
made a good Madrigal, Epigram, or
Song, he's therefore fit to write an He∣roick
Poem; he is to consider his
Strength. <HI>Tibullus</HI> would perhaps have
written bad Odes, and <HI>Horace</HI> bad Ele∣gies.
The <HI>Hebrews</HI> had a Proverb upon
this, <HI>Pro Camel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sarcina, Suit your Bur∣then
to your Camel.</HI></P>
<P>40. Cui lecta potenter erit res.] Potenter,
<HI>for</HI> according to his Strength.</P>
<P>42. <HI>Ordinis hac Virtus erit &amp; Venus,
aut ego fallor.] Horace</HI> here explains in
a few Words, the Virtue and Grace of
the Order a Poet ought to observe in
the Disposition of his Subject; and adds
these Orders, <HI>aut ago fallor,</HI> it being a
new Rule of his, made by him, from
the Practice of the greatest Authors of
Antiquity.</P>
<P>43. <HI>Ʋt jam nunc dicat, jam nunc deben∣tia
dici pleraque differat.</HI>] This <HI>debentia
dici</HI> serves for two Propositions, <HI>dicat &amp;
differat.</HI> The Construction and Sense of
the Passage is this; <HI>Ʋt jam nunc dicat
debentia dici jam nunc, &amp; pleraque differat
jam nunc debentia dici: Let him say at first
Things that ought to be at first said, and
reserve for another Time the greatest Part
of those that should also have been said at
first. Horace</HI> discovers here one of the
greatest Secrets of Poetry. In Drama∣tick
Poetry, as well as Epick, the great
Masters open the Scene as near as they
can to the Catastrophe, always taking
the Action at the Moment it draws to
an End: They artfully bring in after∣wards
the Events preceding, which they
should not have told us at first, as in a
History. <HI>Homer, Sophocles, Euripides,</HI> ne∣ver
did otherwise. By this keeping off
the Catastrophe, by probable and natu∣ral
Incidents, when we every Minute ex∣pected
it, our Curiosity is the more en∣flam'd,
and all the Passions are mov'd
in us one after another, which could
not be done in a Methodical Order; to
prove this we need only read <HI>Apolloni∣us</HI>'s
<HI>Argonauts; Longinus</HI> owns there is
not a single Fault in that Piece, and
yet 'tis mortally tedious, and the chief
Reason is, 'tis methodical, and prosecu∣ted
without Interruption from the Be∣ginning
to the End; the greatest Fault
it could have, for there's nothing so
dull as a Poet;
<Q><L>Who when he sings a Hero's glorious Deeds,</L>
<L>Writes a dry History, and by Dates proceeds.</L></Q></P>
<P>45. <HI>Hoc amet, hoc spernat.</HI>] Having
spoken of the Order, he comes now to
the Choice of the Incidents, which is
not easy to be made: What is good
for the Epick Poem, is not for Trage∣dy;
neither is it sufficient to know which
to take and which to refuse. The Poet
must put those he takes in their pro∣per
Place, where their Effect may be
most surprising, and most convenient for
the Poem, since the same Thing plac'd
in a different Manner has a quite diffe∣rent
Effect.</P>
<P><HI>Promissi carminis.</HI>] A Poem that
has been a long while expected, and rais'd
the Curiosity of the Publick: For every
Thing which the World have great Ex∣pectations
of should be more perfect than
what they do not expect. <HI>Horace</HI> had,
perhaps, <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Aeneis</HI> in view; 'twas
several Years after that Poem was ex∣pected,
that it appear'd, <HI>Nescio quid ma∣jus
nascitur Iliade.</HI></P>
<P>46. <HI>In Verbis etiam tenuis.</HI>] From
the Disposition of the Subject, and the
Choice of the Incidents, he comes to
the Question, Whether the Poet is al∣low'd
<PB N="253" REF="270"/>
to invent new Words: He main∣tains
that he is, and lays down the
Rules for it, <HI>Tenuis, subtle, agreeable,
fine.</HI></P>
<P>47. <HI>Notum si callida verbum reddide
rit junctura novum.</HI>] New Words are
of two sorts, Simple or Compound. We
shall hereafter talk of Simple. Com¦pound
are such as are made of two
Words, as <HI>Velivolum, saxifragum.</HI> This
Composition <HI>Horace</HI> here terms <HI>Junctu∣ram:</HI>
There are two other Constructions
of this Verse quite different; some pre∣tend
<HI>Horace</HI> is not speaking of Words,
but of Expressions, when by the help
of Epithets, Adverbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we deter∣mine
certain known Phrases from an
Ordinary Use to an Extraordinary, as
<HI>Horace</HI> has often practis'd with so much
Success, that <HI>Petronius</HI> says of him, <HI>Ho∣ratii
Curiosa Felicitas,</HI> and <HI>Quintilian,
Verbis felicissime audax.</HI> This Constructi∣on
is more Ingenious than True. <HI>Ho∣race</HI>
would never have call'd it <HI>Junctu∣ram,</HI>
which denotes necessarily a Binding<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Connecting, as when out of Two
Things One is made. Further, 'tis nei∣ther
possible nor natural to give Rules
for such Boldnesses as these, which depend
on every Man's <HI>Goût,</HI> on his Genius, and
his Knowledge of the force and extent
of Words. In short, this Rule would
be out of its Place here, since <HI>Horace</HI>
says in the preceding Verse <HI>in Verbis
serendis,</HI> which cannot admit of such an
Explanation: The other Construction is,
<HI>Si callida junctura reddiderit Verbum No¦vum,
Notum:</HI> If you so make use of a
new Word, that the Place where you
put it may make it be known, and ren∣der
the true Signification to be at first
sight easily Comprehended. Which Con∣struction
seems to me to be neither so
good nor so true as the other, nor in∣deed
to be maintain'd. The Question
is not concerning the placing of Words,
but of making, <HI>de Verbis serendis;</HI> and
what <HI>Horace</HI> adds afterwards of new
simple Words is an undoubted Proof
that he speaks here of Compound.</P>
<P>48. <HI>Si forte necesse est Indiciis mon∣strare
recentibus abdita rerum.</HI>] This re¦lates
to Simple Words, which <HI>Aristotle</HI>
terms <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <HI>Cicero, Ficta,
Words never heard of before. Horace</HI> de∣clares
'tis allowable for a Poet to make
'em, when he is oblig'd to express
Things that are unknown, as the <HI>Com∣pass,
Artillery, Powder;</HI> he may then in∣vent
Words, but must take care that
they express either the Nature of the
Thing, or the Effect it produces. For
this Reason <HI>Homer</HI> is commended, he
being the first who said <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; the first expresses admi∣rably
the Hissing of Red hot Iron thrown
into Water, and the last the <HI>Barking</HI> of
Wolves and Dogs. The <HI>French</HI> Word
<HI>Lapper</HI> to lick, is of this kind.</P>
<P>49. <HI>Indiciis.</HI>] Words ought to be the
Sign and Image of the Things they ex∣press;
wherefore <HI>Plato</HI> calls them <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>50. <HI>Cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis.</HI>]
The <HI>Cethegi</HI> are here represented as a
Masculine Sort of People, who in their
Cloaths kept to the Old Fashions of their
Fathers, and despis'd the <HI>Tunica.</HI> as too
cumbersome; wearing only a kind of
an Apron, which serv'd them instead of
Drawers, from the Waste downwards;
upon which they put their <HI>Toga.</HI> The
Pane of it, which they threw over their
Left Shoulder, hung down their Backs,
and left their Right Arm bare: This
Dress was call'd <HI>cinctus Gabinus,</HI> and
was usually worn by Consuls and Pre∣tors,
whence we have the <HI>cinctu Ga∣bino,</HI>
in the VIIth Book of the <HI>Aeneis,</HI>
in <HI>Silius Italicus,</HI> and in <HI>Lucan. Cin∣ctutus</HI>
is an Epithet, which not only
gives an Idea of Antiquity, but raises
also Veneration.</P>
<P>51. <HI>Dabiturque licentia sumta puden∣ter.</HI>]
This Liberty must be us'd with
Moderation. <HI>Horace</HI> confines it to very
narrow Limits; for he would have the
invented Words to be Derivatives from
the <HI>Greek</HI></P>
<P>52. <HI>Habebunt verba fidem.</HI>] They shall
have Authority, and be receiv'd.</P>
<P>53. <HI>Si Graeco fonte cadant.</HI>] If their Ori∣ginal
be <HI>Greek;</HI> as if we should call a
Man who leads an Elephant <HI>Elephan∣tista;</HI>
the <HI>Latins</HI> made also new Simple
Words of <HI>Latin</HI> Derivation, as of <HI>Bea∣tus,
Cicero</HI> made <HI>Beatitas; Messala,</HI> of
<HI>Reus, Reatus; Augustus,</HI> of <HI>Munus, Mu∣nerarius;</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="271"/>
and <HI>Horace,</HI> of <HI>Inimicus, Inimi∣care,</HI>
&amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Parce detorta.</HI>] These new Simple
Words ought not only to be deriv'd
from the <HI>Greek,</HI> but their Derivation
must be easie and natural, the Analo∣gy
just and entire; they must not be bold
and far fetch'd: This is what is meant
by <HI>Parce deterta.</HI></P>
<P>54. <HI>Quid autem Cecilio Plautoque da∣bit
Romanus.</HI>] Why should not <HI>Varius</HI>
and <HI>Virgil</HI> have the same Liberty <HI>Ceci∣lius</HI>
and <HI>Plantus</HI> had, who are both full
of new Words: when did this Privilege
cease, says <HI>Quintilian, Quid natis postea
concessum est, quando defiit licere?</HI></P>
<P>59. <HI>Signatum praesente <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ta procudere
Nomen.</HI>] He speaks of Words, as of
Coin, which is not Current without the
publick Stamp: <HI>Prasen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nota,</HI> the Coin▪
the publick Authorizes, which only has
a Currency: So <HI>Quintilian, at Nummo
cui publica forma est.</HI> He calls <HI>Form,</HI>
what <HI>Horace</HI> terms <HI>Stamp.</HI> The inven∣ted
Word should be clear, intelligible,
and resemble those already in Use in its
Termination. <HI>Horace,</HI> in the IId Epistle
of the IId Book explains it further
thus, <HI>Adscisset nove quae genitor produxerit
Ʋsus.</HI></P>
<P>60. <HI>Ʋt Sylvae foliis Diomedes.</HI>] The
Grammarian quotes this Verse thus,
<Q>Ʋt folia in Sylvis.</Q></P>
<P>This reading is most Simple, the other
most Figurative; the Comparision is ta∣ken
from the VIth Book of the <HI>Ilias,</HI>
where <HI>Homer</HI> says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>The
Generation of Man is like that of Leaves,
when the Leaves are blown off by the Winds,
the Trees of the Forest bud and bring forth
others which appear in the Spring. 'Tis
thus with Man, when one Generation passes
away another comes.</HI></P>
<P>63. <HI>Debemur morti nos nostraque.</HI>]
Since every thing wears away, why
should we think Words will always have
the same Force and Grace? All the no∣ble
Expressions <HI>Horace</HI> has collected in
these six Lines, serve to render this Fall
the more pleasant, <HI>nedum Verborum stet
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> For nothing contributes so much
to the <HI>Ridiculous</HI> as the <HI>Grand.</HI></P>
<P>64. <HI>Sivè receptus terra Neptunus clas∣se:
aquilonibus arcet.] Augustus</HI> cut that
space of Land which divided the Lake
<HI>Lucrinus</HI> and the Lake <HI>Avernus</HI> from
the Sea, and made a Port call'd <HI>Portum

it. <HI>Virgil</HI> mentions it in the IId Geor∣gick.</P>
<P>65. <HI>Regis Opus.</HI>] To denote <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI>
not the <HI>Work of the King;</HI> that
would have been invidious in the In∣fancy

Work the Work of a king.</P>
<P><HI>Sterilisve diu palus aptaque remis.</HI>] He
speaks of the <HI>Pontin Marsh.</HI> Tho' <HI>Horace</HI>
here commends <HI>Augustus</HI> for draining
it, he, in all likelihood, drain'd only a
part of it, or else the Marsh was apt to
overflow again; for the Consul <HI>Cethegus</HI>
drain'd it in the Year of <HI>Rome</HI> 593, and
it was also drain'd again under <HI>The∣odorick.</HI></P>
<P>67. <HI>Seu cursum mutavit iniquum fru∣gibus

<P>68. <HI>Mortalia facta peribunt.</HI>] Since the
most solid Works of Mankind perish,'tis
no wonder Words do. The same Turn
is us'd by <HI>Severus Sulpitius,</HI> in his
Letter to <HI>Cicero,</HI> Book IV. of <HI>Cicero</HI>'s
Epistles, Epist. V.</P>
<P>71. <HI>Si volet usus, quem penes arbitri∣um
est, &amp; jus &amp; norma loquendi.</HI>] Use is
the Tyrant of Languages. <HI>Secrates</HI> con∣fest
to <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> in the first Dialogue of
that Name, that the <HI>People</HI> is an ex∣cellent
Master of Languages. We have
in our Days a good Use and a bad Use,
the good form'd by the polite Part
of the Court, City, and the best Au∣thors;
the bad by the People. The dif∣ference
between us and the Antients, as
well <HI>Romans</HI> as <HI>Athenians,</HI> arises from
this, the People were there confounded,
great and small together; from whence
there was no sensible Variation in their
Language: Among us the People have
no Commerce with the Court, and ac∣cordingly
their Language is quite dif∣ferent.</P>
<P>74. <HI>Quo scribi possent numero monstra∣vit
Homerus.</HI>] He is speaking of the <HI>E∣pick
Poem,</HI> and says, <HI>Homer</HI> has shewn
in what sort of Verse it ought to be
<PB N="255" REF="272"/>
written, the <HI>Heroick,</HI> which only agrees
with the Majesty of the <HI>Epick. Ari∣stotle</HI>
says the same thing in his Art of
Poetry; and adds, <HI>That whoever should
undertake to write an Epick Poem in any
other kind of Numbers, he would not suc∣ceed,
for the Heroick Verse is the most grave
and Pompous.</HI> He mentions it again in
another Place of that Discourse. Most
People imagine, that by Heroick Verse
is meant the <HI>Hexameter,</HI> which is a Mi∣stake:
All Heroick Verses are indeed
Hexameter, but all Hexameters are not
Heroick Verses, Six Feet plac'd how you
will make an Hexameter, but for an
Heroick Verse you must keep the Laws
prescrib'd by <HI>Homer.</HI> The First of which
is to observe the <HI>Cesure</HI> call'd <HI>tome penthe∣mimeris,</HI>
that is, after the Second Foot
there must be a Syllable which finishes
the Word, and is Sense. as,
<Q>Dardani—ique ro—gum</Q></P>
<P>The Second is to observe the <HI>Cesure</HI>
call'd <HI>tome Heptamimeris;</HI> that is, after
the Third Foot, the Syllable which fol∣lows
ought to close the Word and Sense,
As,
<Q>Dardani—ique ro—gum capi—tis.</Q></P>
<P>If neither of these Rules are observ'd
the <HI>Penthemimere Cesure</HI> must end with
a <HI>Trochaus.</HI> That is, after the two first
Feet the Word should end with One Long
and One Short.</P>
<Q>Infan—dum re—gina.</Q>
<P>Or the <HI>Heptamimere Caesure</HI> must end
also with a <HI>Trochaus:</HI> One Long and One
Short after the Third Foot,
<Q>Qua Pax—longa re—miserat—arma.</Q>
which is very rare. Without the Obser∣vation
of these Rules, the Verse will be
<HI>Hexameter</HI> not Heroick; and the Criticks
reject it, like that of <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q>Magnanimi Jovis Ingratum ascendere
cubile.</Q>
which is forgiven him, being the only
One among so many Thousands where∣in
these Rules are not observ'd,</P>

<P>77. <HI>Exiguos Elegos.</HI>] The <HI>Pentameter</HI>
Verse is the <HI>Elegiack. Horace</HI> calls it
<HI>Exiguum</HI> because it wants a Foot of the
Hexameter. For this Reason he says, two
Verses higher, <HI>Versibus impariter junctis.</HI>
The Moderns want the Beauty of this Ine∣quality
in their Elegiacks. <HI>Ovid</HI> expres∣ses
it thus,

<L>Et puto pes illi longior alter erat.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Emiserit autor, Grammatici certant.] Ho∣race</HI>

the <HI>Elegy,</HI> not why it was so
nam'd. <HI>Terentius Maurus</HI> says the
same, and that some People will have it
to be <HI>Callinous,</HI> others, <HI>Theocles, Archi∣lochus,</HI>

<P>79. <HI>Archilochum propri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rabies armavit

Iambicks to <HI>Archilochus.</HI> True, no body
wrote them so well as he, till his Time,
but there were Iambick Verses long be∣fore
him; however, for his bringing them
to such Perfection, they were call'd the
<HI>Iambicks</HI> of <HI>Archilochus.</HI></P>

<P>81. <HI>Alternis optum Sermonibus.] Ho∣race</HI>
assigns three Qualities to Iambick
Verse; That 'tis proper for Conversation,
that is composes best the Tumults of
the Theatre, and is good to carry on
the Action: As for the first, one can
<PB N="256" REF="273"/>
hardly speak in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI>
Tongues without making Iambicks; as
both <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI> have observ'd.
See the IVth Chap. of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Art of
Poetry; and <HI>Cicero</HI> tells us, <HI>Magnam e∣nim

<P>82. <HI>Et populares vintentem strepitus.</HI>] Si∣lences

Iambick Verse not being much different

It is not so with the Modern
Languages.</P>
<P><HI>Et natum rebus agendis.] Horace</HI> took
this from <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Art of Poetry, where
'tis said <HI>Iambick and Tetrameter Verses</HI>
are proper to give Motion. The one
is suited to Dances, the other to Action.
<HI>Quintilian</HI> tells us why the <HI>Iambick</HI>

Verse, because it is not presently per∣ceiv'd
whether it relates to that which
goes before, or that which comes
after it. <HI>Horace</HI> having spoken of the
different Subjects and Characters of Epick,
Elegiack, and Iambick Poems, adds, that
a Poet who does not know how to distin∣guish
them, does not deserve the Name of
one. He who would in the Elegy assume
the Epick Tone, or would mix the Soft∣ness
of the Elegy with the Roughness
of the Iambick, would make but a sorry
Poem of it. Mr. <HI>Dacier</HI>'s Complaint of
the <HI>French</HI> Poets touches all the Moderns,
which is, that in most of 'em, their <HI>Pasto∣rals</HI>
are <HI>Elegies;</HI> their <HI>Elegies, Epicks;</HI> and
their <HI>Lyricks, Epigrams.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vices.]</HI> He calls <HI>descriptas Vices, Vices ad∣tributas,

the different Characters, of these diffe∣rent
Poems.</P>
<P><HI>Operumque Colores.</HI>] The different
Colours, the different Stile of each,
their different Ornaments; compar'd to
the Colours of Painters, which are dif∣ferent
according to the different Subjects,
and the different Impression they would
make.</P>
<P>88. <HI>Cur nescire, pudens prave, quam

<P>89. <HI>Versibus exponi Tragicis res comicae
non vult.</HI>] A Verse may be call'd <HI>Tra∣gick</HI>
or <HI>Comick</HI> on two Accounts; the
first for its Measure and Feet; for the
<HI>Tragick</HI> and <HI>Comick</HI> Verse may be both
<HI>Iambicks,</HI> and both admit of <HI>Spondees;</HI>
yet there is a great deal of difference
between them: The <HI>Tragick</HI> admits of
the <HI>Spondee</HI> only in the first, third, and
fifth Foot, which renders its Motion the
more Noble and Pompous: The Comick
admits it in all those Feet, because its
Motion is thereby the more Natural and
Unaffected. The second Reason why a
Verse may be call'd <HI>Tragick</HI> or <HI>Comick,</HI>
is on account of the Meanness of its
Expressions and Figures. Thus it is cer∣tain
that Tragick Verse ought not to be
us'd in Comedy, nor Comick in Trage∣dy.
<HI>Horace</HI> speaking of Feet and Mea∣sure,
in the 253d Verse; I believe he
intends here Expressions and Figures
only: Nothing is more Vicious than
Lofty Expressions and Noble Figures in
Comedy, for which the Common Phrase
is most proper; whereas Tragedy requires
a Sublime and Bold Stile.</P>

<HI>Thyestes</HI> eat his own Children, whom
<HI>Acreus</HI> caus'd to be served up to him. This
Story being one of the most Tragical,
is also recommended by <HI>Aristotle</HI> as a
Subject for Tragedy. He says, <HI>Narrari,</HI>
it ought to be told, and not represented.
See the 184th Verse.</P>
<P>92. <HI>Singula quaeque locum teneant sor∣tita
decenter.</HI>] The Tragick and Comick
Stiles must not encroach upon One ano∣ther;

nec Comoedia in Cothurnos assurgit, nec con∣tra

Tragedy the Sock. Nature has made
this Law, and he who breaks it, errs a∣gainst
Decorum.</P>
<P>97. <HI>Interdum tamen &amp; vocem Comaedia
tollit.</HI>] However, Comedy raises its
Voice sometimes, and Tragedy sometimes
makes use of the Language of Conver∣sation.
Tragedy and Comedy being only
Imitations of Humane Actions. The
Stile should be proportionable to the Sub∣ject,
and the Actor; an Angry Father
in Comedy should assume a lofty Tone,
and speak with Passion; and an afflicted
Man in Tragedy wou'd be intolerable, if
he spoke his Affliction in a Sublime and
Elegant Stile. See the IVth Satyr of the
Ist Book. <HI>At pater ardens saevit,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>94. <HI>Iratusque Chremes.] Chremes</HI> as∣sumes
a Tragick Tone in the Vth Scene of
<HI>Terence</HI>'s <HI>Heautontimorumenos. Nou si ex
capite sis meo,</HI> &amp;c. Speaking to his Son,

Oh Heaven! O Earth! Oh the Seas of</HI>

to elevate its Stile, in all violent Passi∣ons,
as well as that of Choler. In <HI>Te∣rence;</HI>'s
<HI>Eunuch,</HI> what <HI>Cherea</HI> says in the
Transport of his Joy, would very well
become a Tragedy. This is not to be
done but with great Art.</P>
<P>95. <HI>Et Tragicus plerumque dolet Sermone
pedestri.] Tragedy</HI> gives less occasion for
encroaching on the <HI>Comick</HI> Stile, than
<HI>Comedy</HI> does on the <HI>Tragick. Horace</HI>
must be taken here as meaning only in
the great Distresses of Tragedy, where
Grief ought to be express'd in a Simple
and Common Phrase. Not all Grief
however, wherefore <HI>Horace</HI> says, <HI>plerum∣que</HI>
and not <HI>Semper. Longinus</HI> deter∣mines
it in general, that the <HI>Sublime</HI> is
not proper to move Pity.</P>
<P>96. <HI>Telephus &amp; Pelcus quem pauper &amp;
exul uterque.] Peleus</HI> and <HI>Telephus,</HI> two
Greek Tragedies. These two Princes
having been driven out of their Domi∣nions,
came to beg Assistance in <HI>Greece,</HI>
and went up and down dress'd like Beggars.
The two Pieces here referr'd to were <HI>Eu∣ripides</HI>'s;
that Poet, in <HI>Aristophanes</HI>'s <HI>Frogs,</HI>
talking of them as his own. See Act III.
Scene I. For this Reason <HI>Eschylus</HI> calls
<HI>Euripides</HI> a <HI>Beggar-maker,</HI> and a <HI>Patcher</HI>
of Raggs. See also the IId Scene of the
IVth Act. <HI>You dress Kings in Raggs to
move Pity. Aristophanes</HI> again makes
Merry with <HI>Euripides</HI>'s <HI>Telephus</HI> in his
<HI>Acharnenses,</HI> Act IV. Scene II. where
he introduces <HI>Diceopolis</HI> coming to bor∣row
of <HI>Euripides Telephus</HI>'s Beggars E∣quipage,
<HI>the Staff, the Scrip, the Horn-Cup,</HI>
&amp;c. <HI>Ah Friend, says</HI> Euripides, <HI>you
will after this Rate carry away my whole
Play;</HI> and again, upon his farther Im∣portunities,
<HI>Thou wilt Ruin me, doest not

from me.</HI> What adds to the Pleasantry
of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atyr on the <HI>Telephus</HI> of <HI>Euripides,</HI>
is, that the whole Scene is in a m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er
made up of his own Verses. <HI>Theodorus
Marcilus</HI> is therefore mistaken, in saying
the <HI>Exul</HI> in <HI>Horace</HI> alludes to <HI>Peleu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> on∣ly,
and not to <HI>Tel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phus;</HI> For <HI>Telephus</HI>

<HI>Ennius</HI> this Exil'd King says, <HI>Regnum

Kingdom in a Beggars Habit. <HI>Aristo∣phanes</HI>
ridicules this Play of <HI>Euripides,</HI> for
the Impossibility of a King's being re∣duc'd
to Beggary. <HI>Horace</HI> is satisfy'd

<HI>Fine,</HI> it should be <HI>Touching. Horace</HI> here
referrs to the Ignorance of such as fancy
they have made a <HI>Fine Play,</HI> when they
have been lavish of the Flowers of Rhe∣torick;
all which are Nothing if it does

of <HI>Dram<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tick</HI> Poetry: 'Tis with this View
<HI>Plato</HI> calls Tragedy <HI>The most diverting and
moving Effect of Poetry.</HI> In <HI>Dulcia,</HI> Sweet
moving, <HI>Horace</HI> imitates <HI>Aristotle</HI> in the
XXth Chapter of his <HI>Art of Poetry. Hein∣sius</HI>
mistakes the <HI>Fine</HI> for <HI>Commendable. Ho∣race</HI>
would certainly never have call'd a
Play <HI>Commendable,</HI> if it had not been Moving.
'Tis thus in a Picture; the Business is not to
make it glare with fine Colours without
Conduct, but to render the Action sen∣sible.
In order to which, no Colour
should be us'd but what will agree with it,
and make the desir'd Impression.</P>
<P>100. <HI>Et quocunque volent.</HI>] It should
inspire all the Passions it pleases; <HI>Hate,
Fear, Terror, Pity.</HI></P>
<P>102. <HI>Si vis me flere dolendum est primum
ipse tibi.</HI>] <HI>Cicero</HI> has explain'd this Rule
at large in his IId Book <HI>De Oratore.</HI>
Poets and Orators can never move an
Auditory, if the Speakers do not shew
that they are Themselves mov'd with
the Passions they wou'd Inspire. There
is a Story of an Old <HI>Greek</HI> Player nam'd
<HI>Polus,</HI> who in the <HI>Electra</HI> of <HI>Sephocles,</HI>
us'd to Play the Part of that Princess.
It happen'd that a Son of his, whom
he dearly Lov'd, Dy'd; and after the
first Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sports of his Grief were over,
he took his Part again, and Play'd <HI>Ele∣ctra;</HI>
in which, instead of the Urn with
the False Ashes of <HI>Electra,</HI> he came in
with the Urn wherein were the True
Ashes of his Son; which embracing, he
pronounc'd these Words, <HI>Oh Doleful
Monument of him who was of all Mankind
most Dear to me,</HI> with so Natural a
Grief, such True and Lively Tears, that
it had a prodigious Effect on the Audi∣ence.
This Rule of <HI>Horace</HI>'s is taken
also from <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry;</HI> the
Philosopher adding to the Precept the
Means to perform it. <HI>The Poet,</HI> says he,
<HI>when he is composing, must as far as possi∣ble
imitate the Gestures and Actions of
those he introduces on the Stage. He who
is truly mov'd, will in the same manner
move those that hear him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>103. <HI>Tua me infortunia ladent.</HI>] Then
wou'd thy Misfortunes wound me. <HI>Lae∣dere</HI>

So <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>104 Male si mandata loqueris.] Horace
<HI>alludes to the Speeches</HI> Telephus <HI>and</HI> Pe∣leus
<HI>made, to oblige the</HI> Greeks <HI>to assist
them.</HI> Telephus <HI>in</HI> Euripides begins his
Discourse to the Athenians, <HI>thus;</HI> Athe∣nians,
who are the Flower of <HI>Greece,</HI> do
not take it Ill, if in the miserable Con∣dition
I now am, I presume to speak be∣fore
so fair an Assembly.</P>
<P>105. <HI>Tristia moesium vultum verba de∣cent.</HI>]
The greatest Poets have not al∣ways
put such Words into the Mouth of
Sorrow, as agree with it. Monsieur <HI>Cor∣neille</HI>
himself often fell into this Error.
When <HI>Chimene</HI> in the <HI>Cid</HI> demands Ju∣stice
for the Murder of her Father, and
speaks of the spilling of his Blood, she
says,
<Q><L>Spilt as it is, the Blood still reeks with
Rage,</L>
<L>To find 'twas lost in any Cause but Yours.</L></Q>
Is this to talk like a Person in Affli∣ction?
<HI>Non projicit Ampullas.</HI> Here are
the <HI>Swelling Thoughts</HI> still. What can
be more trivial than to make the Blood
that was spilt, think and find, and to
explain it self by <HI>Reeking? Electra</HI> in
<HI>Sophocles</HI> mourns the Death of her Father
after quite another Rate.</P>
<P>106. <HI>Iratum plena minarum.] Horace</HI>
feigns elsewhere, that when <HI>Prometheus</HI>
form'd Man, he borrow'd each Quality
from each Animal, and when he put
Choler into his Heart, took it from the
Lyon. What can give a juster Idea of
the Effects of this Passion? There must
<PB N="259" REF="276"/>
be nothing Mean or Affected in it. <HI>Se∣neca</HI>'s
Fury is often full of Meditation.</P>
<P>107. <HI>Ludentem L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sciva.</HI>] A Florid, Gay
Stile agrees with Joy. <HI>Achilles</HI> in Love
may be <HI>Agreeable</HI> and <HI>Delicate.</HI> Those
who apply these Words to Comedy are
in the Wrong. Tragedy admits of Rap∣tures
of Joy, which render her Catastro∣phe
sometimes the more Moving.</P>
<P><HI>Severum seria dictu.</HI>] A grave Person
must speak answerably to his Character.
<HI>Euripides</HI> is not so Discreet as <HI>Sophocles.
Seneca</HI> the Tragick Poet never minds this
Rule. He is so fond of shining every
where, that he becomes Ridiculous.</P>
<P>108. <HI>Format enim Natura prius nos in∣tus
ad omnem fortunarum habitum.</HI>] In
these Four Admirable Verses, <HI>Horace</HI>
gives the Reason of the Precepts con∣tain'd
in the Two preceding ones. His
Reason is drawn from our Mother Na¦ture,
who gave us a Heart capable of
feeling all the Changes of Fortune, and
a Tongue to express it. When our
Words do not answer the Condition we
are in, the Heart strikes one String in
the Instrument of Man, instead of ano∣ther,
and makes a very disagreeable Dis∣cord.</P>
<P>1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. <HI>Juvat aut impellit.</HI>] Nature helps
us to put our selves into a Rage. <HI>Horace</HI>
adds <HI>Impellit,</HI> to denote the Impetuosity
of that Passion.</P>
<P>110. <HI>Aut ad humum moerore gravi de∣ducit.]
Horace</HI>'s Expression agrees very
well with the Passion he speaks of. How
natural is his Image of the Humiliation of
an Afflicted Man? How Ridiculous does
it render al Frothy Expressions in that
Condition?</P>
<P>112. <HI>Si dicentis erunt fortunis absona
dicta.</HI>] The Language must always a∣gree
with the Condition of the Person
speaking; otherwise the Orator will be
Laught at. See <HI>Antonius</HI> speaking for <HI>M. Aquilius,</HI>
in the IId Book of <HI>Cicero</HI>'s O∣rations.
<HI>Non prius sum conatus miseri∣cordiam
aliis commovere quam misericor∣dia
sum ipse captus,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>114. <HI>Intereit multum Divusne loquatur
an heros.</HI>] A Poet must also suit the
Language of his Actors to their Age
and Characters. A God must express
himself otherwise than a Hero. An Old
Man than a Young Man. This Rule is
not much observ'd by the Moderns.</P>
<P><HI>Divusne loquatur an Heros.</HI>] Some have
read it <HI>Davusne loquatur, an Eros. Eros</HI>
was the Name of an Honest Foot-man
in <HI>Menander</HI>'s Play, as <HI>Davus</HI> that of a
Knavish one. But <HI>Horace</HI> is not here dis∣coursing
of Comedy: Besides, the Diffe∣rence
between Footman and Footman
is not considerable enough to be taken
Notice of by him in a Precept. Others
have read it <HI>Divusne loquatur, an Irus.</HI>
The Sense of this is too mean, and <HI>I∣rus</HI>
is not a Tragick Person. Others,
<HI>Davusne loquatur, an Heros.</HI> The Matter
in Dispute, as I have said already, re∣lates
only to Tragedy, and to the Diffe∣rence
there ought to be between the
Character of a God, and that of a Hero,
as he says afterwards.</P>
<Q>Ne quicumque Deus, quicumque adhibetur
Heros.</Q>
<P>The Gods were introduc'd by the An∣cients
into their Plays, as in <HI>Aeschylus,
Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Euripides.</HI></P>
<P>115. <HI>Maturusne Senex, an adhuc florente
juventa fervidus.</HI>] An Experienc'd Old
Man does not talk like a Raw Youth.
Mr. <HI>Corneille</HI> and Mr. <HI>Racine,</HI> imitate in
this the Wonderful Conduct of <HI>Sopho∣cles.</HI></P>
<P>116. <HI>An Matrona potens, nec sedula
Nutrix.</HI>] Here <HI>Horace</HI> had doubtless in
View the <HI>Hypolitus</HI> of <HI>Euripides,</HI> where
<HI>Phaedra</HI> and her Nurse speak very diffe∣rently;
an Mr. <HI>Racine</HI> in his <HI>Phaedra</HI>
has observ'd this Precept, in varying the
Two Characters.</P>
<P>117. <HI>Mercatorne Vagus, an cultor viren∣tis
agelli.</HI>] Some have thought <HI>Horace</HI> is
Discoursing of Comedy also, on Account
of the Meanness of the Persons, whereas
he is still Discoursing of Tragedy only,
in which it was not uncommon for the

Aristophanes <HI>does not know how to make
every one say what becomes him. A King
should talk with Dignity, an Orator with
Force, a Woman with Simplicity, a Private
Man after a common Manner; a Mechanick
with Rudeness. The Diction of all</HI> Ari∣stophanes
'<HI>s Persons is at a venture, and you
cannot tell whether 'tis a Son or a Father

Aristotle</HI> says, that to succeed in such a
Character as <HI>Achilles</HI>'s a Poet should ra∣ther
imagine what Choler ought to do
with Verisimility, than what it has done.</P>
<P>122. <HI>Jura negat sibi nata.] Achilles</HI>
pretends to be above the Laws, for which
Reason he refuses to obey <HI>Agamemnon,</HI>
whom he loads with Affronts, and in∣solently
threatens. By the same Prin∣ciple
he sacrifices the Common Cause,
the Honour and Lives of so many
Thousand Men, and the Glory of his
Country, to his Private Interest.</P>
<P><HI>Nihil non arroget Armis.</HI>] He depended
on his Sword for Justice. He draws it
half out in <HI>Homer</HI> against <HI>Agamemnon.
Minerva</HI> hinders his drawing it further. He
tells that King, if he dares take any∣thing
out of his Tent, he should soon see his
Blood at his Spears End. All the Qualities
<HI>Horace</HI> attributes to <HI>Achilles</HI> are in the
Ist Book of the <HI>Ilias.</HI></P>
<P>123. <HI>Sit Medea ferox, invictaque.</HI>] The
True Character of <HI>Medea,</HI> who is repre∣sented
as Cruel and Inflexible by <HI>Euri∣pides.</HI>
She Kills her Two Children, and
sends her Rival a Robe and a Crown so
prepar'd, that they Consume her as soon
as she puts them on. <HI>Creon</HI> falls on her
Corps. The Fatal Robe sticks to his
Flesh, and he expires in the same Tor∣ments
with his Daughter.</P>
<P><HI>Flebilis Ino.] Ino</HI> the Daughter of
<HI>Cadmus</HI> and <HI>Harmonia.</HI> She was first
Marry'd to <HI>Athamas</HI> who had a Son
by a former Wife, and she feign'd
an Oracle which order'd the Son to
be Sacrific'd to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> But she was
soon punish'd for her Cheat. <HI>Athamas</HI>
running Mad Kill'd <HI>Learchus</HI> the Eldest
Son he had by her, and had Sacrific'd
her other Son, if she had not flung her
self into the Sea with that Son in her
Arms. <HI>Euripides</HI> wrote a Tragedy on
this Story.'Tis easie from the Grief of
this Princess, on the Loss of her Chil∣dren,
<PB N="261" REF="278"/>
to imagine she might well be call'd
<HI>Flebilis.</HI></P>
<P>124. <HI>Persidus Ixion] Ixion</HI> was the first
Murderer in <HI>Greece;</HI> He Marry'd the
Daughter of <HI>Dejoneus,</HI> and kill'd his
Father-in-law at Supper, instead of giv∣ing
him the usual Presents. This Crime
was so horrible, no Body wou'd expiate
the Murderer, nor have any Correspon∣dence
with him. At last <HI>Jupiter</HI> took
Pity on him, expiated him and receiv'd
him into Heaven, where the Traytor
falling in Love with <HI>Juno,</HI> wou'd have
Ravish'd her. He only embrac'd a Cloud,
and <HI>Jupiter</HI> in a Rage hurl'd him Head∣long
to Hell, where the Poets feign him
to be stretch'd on a Wheel always turn∣ing.
<HI>Eschylus</HI> and <HI>Euripides</HI> wrote on this
Story. <HI>Plutarch</HI> mentioning the <HI>Ino</HI> and
<HI>Ixion</HI> of <HI>Euripides,</HI> who being blam'd for
Writing upon it as a Subject <HI>accurs'd by
the Gods,</HI> Euripides replies, <HI>I have not
left him till I have Nail'd his Feet and his
Hands to a Wheel. Aristotle</HI> places these
two Plays of his among the <HI>Patheticks.</HI>
There's nothing Extant of them.</P>
<P><HI>Io Vaga.] Io,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Inachus,</HI> with
whom <HI>Jupiter</HI> was in Love, and chang'd
her into a Cow. <HI>Juno</HI> out of Jealousie
made her run Mad, and sent a <HI>Fly</HI> which
so stung her, that she ran from Country
to Country, crost several Seas, and ar∣riv'd
at last in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where the recover'd
her firsst Shape, and was Worshipp'd under
the Name of <HI>Isis. Eschylus</HI> makes her
wander so in his <HI>Prometheus,</HI> that she
came to the Mountain where he was
Chain'd, at the farther End of <HI>Scythia,</HI>
and there she learn'd of that Wretch all
the future Fortune that was to befal
her.</P>
<P><HI>Tristis Orestes.] Tristis</HI> here signifies
<HI>Curs'd, Mad, Raging,</HI> as well as <HI>Sad.</HI>
Thus he elsewhere calls Choler, <HI>Sad,
tristes ut Irae. Ovid</HI> has also said <HI>Tristis
Oresia. Euripides</HI>'s Representation of <HI>O∣restes</HI>
in this State, is admirable; he
appears in the Tragedy which goes by
his Name, more like a Hideous Spectre
than a Man.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Men.</HI> Your Eyes are ghastly, horrible you
look.</L>
<L><HI>Or.</HI> My Body's gone, I'm nothing but a

<P>He alludes to the Signification of the
Name <HI>Orestes,</HI> which, according to <HI>So∣crates</HI>'s
Opinion in <HI>Cratylus,</HI> denotes
something Wild, Fierce and Brutal.</P>
<P>125. <HI>Si quid inexpertum Scenae committis.</HI>]
Having explain'd the <HI>Famam sequere,</HI>
he now does the same by the latter
Part of the Verse, <HI>aut convenientia finge,</HI>
Shewing what is to be done with New
Characters. Their first Quality is to be
Conformable and Agreeable. A Mad
Man must act like a Mad-man; a King
like a King, and so on. A Woman must
not have <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Valour, nor <HI>Nestor</HI>'s
Prudence. Their Second Quality is to
be one and the same from the Beginning
of the Play to the End, which <HI>Aristotle</HI>
calls <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Equality.</HI> This is as ne∣cessary
in <HI>Known</HI> Characters as in <HI>In∣vented.
Boilean</HI> explains it in his <HI>Art of
Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>If then you form some Hero in your Mind,
Be sure your Image with it self agree,
For what he first appears he still must be.</P>
<P><HI>Agatho's Flower</HI> was an admirable Play,
tho' it was all Invention. See the IXth
Chapter of <HI>Aristotle's Art of Poetry,</HI> On
Known and Invented Subjects.</P>
<P>128. <HI>Difficile est proprie communia dicere.</HI>]
Having shewn the two Qualities that
should be given to <HI>Invented</HI> Persons, he
advises Tragick Poets not to take too
much Liberty to Invent, it being very
difficult to succeed in New Characters.
By <HI>common Subjects, Invented Ones</HI> are un∣derstood.
Subjects that have no Foun∣dation
in <HI>History,</HI> or the <HI>Fable;</HI> he calls
them Common, because every Body has
a Right to them, and is free to Invent
them. 'Tis very difficult to invent a
New Character that shall be Just and
Natural; the Moderns have succeeded
much better in their <HI>Known</HI> Stories than
in their <HI>Invented</HI> Ones. Let a Character
be form'd ever so justly, every one will
pretend to a Right to Judge of it, and
Censure it, if it is not conformable to
the Idea they themselves have of it;
whereas when a Poet follows a Known
One, there's a Common Rule which he
must not deviate from, and which is the
Standard of their Judgment as well as
his Composition. <HI>Horace</HI> cannot by
<PB N="262" REF="279"/>
<HI>Communiae</HI> mean Common and Ordinary
Characters, because he immediately ad∣vises
the Poets to make use of known
Characters.</P>
<P>129. <HI>Tuque rectius Iliacum carmen de∣ducis
in actus.] Aristotle</HI> in his IXth
Chapter, determines for Invented Fa∣bles,
as well as receiv'd ones; <HI>Horace</HI> is
here for known subjects, such as are
taken from the <HI>Ilias and Odysses,</HI> for
both those Poems are compris'd under
the Words <HI>Ili<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>um carmen.</HI> This Diffe∣rence
arises from the different Ends the
Poet and Philosopher propos'd to them∣selves.
<HI>Aristotle</HI> speaks only of what
might please or displease, and <HI>Invented</HI>
Subjects may please as well as known;
<HI>Horace</HI> talks only of what is easie or dif∣ficult,
and <HI>Known</HI> Subjects are easier than
<HI>Invented:</HI> Besides, <HI>Aristotle</HI> wrote to the
<HI>Greeks,</HI> who were so far possest of the
Spirit of Tragedy, that nothing was
Impossible for them. <HI>Horace</HI> wrote to
the <HI>Romans,</HI> who were much Inferior to
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and whom he disswaded from
undertaking what was most difficult for
them to succeed in. <HI>Horace,</HI> in advising
Poets to borrow their Subjects from <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
is of the same Opinion with <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>
and <HI>Plato,</HI> who have both affirm'd
that <HI>Homer</HI> is a Tragick Poet; his <HI>Ilias</HI>
and <HI>Odysses</HI> have the same Relation to
Tragedy, as his <HI>Margiter</HI> has to Come∣dy.
<HI>Plato,</HI> in his Tenth Book, calls <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
the <HI>Father of Tragedy.</HI></P>
<P>130. <HI>Quam si proferres Ign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta indi∣ctaque
prius.</HI>] By <HI>Ignota indictaque</HI> he
means the same Thing as by his <HI>Com∣munia,
unknown Subjects:</HI> He adds <HI>Indi∣cta</HI>
to <HI>Ignota,</HI> Subjects never treated of
before. For a Story may be <HI>Ʋnknown,</HI>
without being <HI>New;</HI>'tis what he says
in the XXVth Ode of the IIId Book.
<HI>Dicem insigne,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I will speak of new
Things which have not yet been spoken
of.</HI></P>
<P>131. <HI>Publica Materies privati juris e∣rit,
si</HI> &amp;c.] Least the Advice he has
been giving Poets might cause them to
fall into servile Imitations, by handling
<HI>known</HI> Subjects, he teaches them how
they are to govern themselves, to make
such Stories <HI>proper. Publica materies,</HI> the
<HI>Ilias,</HI> the <HI>Thebaides,</HI> the <HI>Odysses,</HI> and all
the Subjects of the Ancient Tragedies:
He opposes <HI>Publica materies</HI> to <HI>Commu∣nia;
Chrysippus</HI> hoasted he had made <HI>Eu∣ripides</HI>'s
<HI>Medea</HI> his own, because he had
not follow'd that Poet's Disposition of
his Subject.</P>
<P>132. <HI>Nec circa vilem patulumque mo∣raberis
Orbem.] Horace</HI> advises Poets to
take the Subjects of their Tragedies out
of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poems, and he here Cauti∣ons
them against the Faults they might
be guilty of. The first and most consi∣derable,
is to amuse themselves, <HI>circa
Orbem vilem &amp; patulum, with a vile Cir∣cuit
open to all the World,</HI> that is, with
bringing into a Tragedy all the Parts of
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem, imitating his very Con∣nection
and Chain: As for Instance, in
opening the Scene with the Quarrel be∣tween
<HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> and
closing all with <HI>Hector</HI>'s Funeral. <HI>He∣insius</HI>
is mistaken, in thinking <HI>Horace</HI>
means a <HI>vain Circuit of Words, that do
not relate to the Subject.</HI> The <HI>Circuit</HI> he
speaks of, is in the Fable, and nothing
can be more Vicious: For what would
be but of a just Extent for an <HI>Heroick</HI>
Poem, would be Monstrous, confin'd to
the narrow Limits of a Tragedy. <HI>Re∣member,
above all things, says</HI> Aristotle,
<HI>not to make a Tragedy of an Epick Plot;
I call an Epick Plot, a Plot consisting of
several Fables; as if you should bring all
the Ilias into one Play.</HI> There's another
vicious Circuit besides this. See the
147th Verse.</P>
<P>133. <HI>Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere.</HI>]
Not to Translate <HI>Homer</HI> Word for Word,
the Business of an exact Translator, not
of a Poet. He should imitate the Discre∣tion
of <HI>Aeschylus, Sophocles,</HI> and <HI>Euri∣pides,</HI>
who all of 'em make hold with
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Sentiments, but do not Tran∣slate
him literally: <HI>Horace</HI> condemns the
Superstitious Exactness of such Transla∣tors,
as keep close to the Letter. <HI>Cice∣ro</HI>
says very well, in the Treatise <HI>de
Optim. Gen. Orat.</HI> Speaking of the two
Orations of <HI>Aeschynes</HI> and <HI>Demosthenes,</HI>
which he Translated, <HI>Nec converti, ut In∣terpres,</HI>
&amp;c. <HI>I have translated them not as
an Interpreter, but as an Orator, by pre∣serving
the Sentences, and their different
Forms, as well as the Figures, and ex∣plaining
the rest in Terms adapted to our
Customs, and according to our Manners, I
<PB N="163" REF="280"/>
did not think it necessary for me to confine
my self to render them Word for Word,
but only to express the Force and Proprie∣ty
of the Terms, believing I ought not to
give the Reader those Terms by Tale but by
Weight.</HI> If a Translator should not tran∣slate
Word for Word, how much less
should a Poet.</P>
<P>134. <HI>Nec desilies imitator in arctum unde
pedem proferre.</HI>] This is my Opinion is
one of the most difficult Places in <HI>Ho∣race:</HI>
The Poet does not here speak of
those who confine themselves to a cer∣tain
Measure of Verse, in their Imitati∣on;
nor of those who lose Sight of
their Original. He has already given
<HI>Tragick</HI> Poets two Ways of rendring Sub∣jects
that have been handled, which he
prefers to Invented ones: The First is,
not to bring the whole Matter of an He∣roick
Poem into a Tragedy; and the
Second, not to Translate it Word for
Word: He here gives them a Third,
not to keep too close to their Author,
in imitating one Action only, so as to
perplex themselves, or break the Laws
of Tragedy, which Laws are very dif∣ferent
from those of Heroick Poetry;
suppose, for Example, I was to write a
Tragedy on <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Choler, and to
follow the two first Rules of <HI>Horace;</HI>
that is, not to put all the <HI>Ilias</HI> in my
Play, nor use his Expressions: I shall
break the Third Rule, if I servilely re∣present
the same Circumstances of <HI>A∣chilles</HI>'s
Choler, as <HI>Homer</HI> has represen∣ted
it, for by that means I shall entan∣gle
my self in a great many Difficulties;
how shall I represent <HI>Achilles</HI> with his
Sword half drawn, and <HI>Minerva</HI> holding
him by the Arm to hinder his killing
<HI>Agamemnon;</HI> an Incident which is Mar∣vellous
in an Epick Poem, and yet would
be ridiculous in a Tragedy. They who
read <HI>referre</HI> here instead of <HI>proferre,</HI> did
not understand the Passage.</P>
<P>136. <HI>Nec sic incipies.</HI>] He blames the
pompous Beginnings of some Tragedies,
when Poets, to give the Audience a great
Idea of their Performances begin Lofti∣ly,
which is faulty several Ways; the
Beginning should be Simple and Modest.
This is a Rule in Epick Poetry, and
much more in Tragedy.</P>
<P><HI>Ʋt scriptor Cyclicus <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lim.</HI>] See what is said
of these Cyclick Poets, in the VIIth Ode of
the First Book.'Tis not known who was
the Cyclick Poet, of whom <HI>Horace</HI> speaks;
some learned Men have thought it was
<HI>Maevius,</HI> who wrote a Poem on the <HI>Tro∣jan</HI>
War, in which he compris'd all the
History of <HI>Priamus,</HI> from his Birth to
his Death: But the Word <HI>Olim</HI> shews he
means some more Ancient Poet. <HI>Stasi∣mus,</HI>
who wrote the <HI>little Ilias,</HI> is thought
to be this Cyclick Poet, by those who
follow the <HI>Scholiast,</HI> on the Knights of
<HI>Aristophanes,</HI> who places this Poet among
the <HI>Cyclicks: Photius</HI> will not have him
to be one of 'em; <HI>Casaubon</HI> thinks he
was of the Number of those Poets who
joyn'd in that Work, mention'd by the
Ancients under the Name of the <HI>Cy∣click
Poem,</HI> which took in the History
of the World from the Beginning of it,
to the Death of <HI>Ʋlysses,</HI> and was the
Work of several Poets, as <HI>Onomacritus,
Lesches, Eumelus,</HI> and others, tho' 'tis
often Quoted as the Production of one
Man, <HI>Fortunam Priami cantabo &amp; Nobile
letum,</HI> the Beginning of <HI>Mavius</HI>'s Poem.
What would <HI>Horace</HI> have said of <HI>Statius,</HI>
another <HI>Cyclick Poet,</HI> who brings all the
Story of <HI>Achilles</HI> into his Poem, as <HI>Ma∣vius</HI>
brought that of <HI>Priamus</HI> into his.</P>

these blustring Beginnings, the sure Signs
of a weak Poet; the Moderns are very

<P>146. <HI>Nec reditum Diomedis ab interitis
Meleagri] Homer</HI> has not written on
<HI>Diomedes</HI>'s Return: Neither is it what
<HI>Horace</HI> means in this Passage; the Sense
of which is, That <HI>Homer,</HI> in his Poem
<PB N="265" REF="282"/>
on the Return of <HI>Ʋlysses,</HI> has not done
like the Poet <HI>Antimachus</HI> in his Return of
<HI>Diomedes,</HI> whose Adventure he begins
with the Death of his Uncle <HI>Meleager,</HI>
which is Absurd; for by this he gives a
Beginning to the Beginning of the A¦ction;
<HI>Before which,</HI> as <HI>Aristotle</HI> ob∣serves,
<HI>nothing must be suppos'd Necessary.</HI>
This Matter is treated of in the VIIth
Chapter of his Art of Poetry.</P>
<P>147. <HI>Nec gemino bellum Trojanum or∣ditur
ab ovo.</HI>] The <HI>Trojan</HI> War is not
the Subject of the <HI>Ilias,</HI> 'tis only the Oc∣casion
of it. <HI>Homer</HI> makes no <HI>Beginning</HI> nor
<HI>End</HI> to the Siege of <HI>Troy;</HI> nay, there's
hardly a <HI>Middle</HI> that's proper to it; but
he forgets none of the Parts of his
Subject, which is <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Choler. He
does not so much as relate the Circum∣stances
of the Rape of <HI>Hellen,</HI> the Cause
of the War. <HI>Horace</HI> laught here at the
Author of the <HI>little Ilias,</HI> who began his
Poem with the two Eggs: In one of
which <HI>Helen</HI> and <HI>Clitemnestra</HI> were en∣clos'd;
in the other <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux.</HI>
The <HI>Ʋnity</HI> of the <HI>Person</HI> can never ex∣cuse
the breaking the <HI>Ʋnity</HI> of the <HI>Acti∣on,</HI>
which, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> teaches, must be
always preserv'd: He condemns, in his
Art of Poetry, the Authors of the <HI>He∣racliade</HI>
and <HI>Theseiade,</HI> for not observing
that Unity, and sets <HI>Homer</HI>'s Conduct
as an Example. He has not in his <HI>O∣dysses</HI>
heap'd together all the Events
that happen'd to <HI>Ʋlysses;</HI> nor in the <HI>Ilias</HI>
does he amuse himself with writing the
History of <HI>Achilles:</HI> He Introduces no
Adventure that has not Relation to
his Subject in either of these Poems.
<HI>Statius,</HI> after <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> had
given such good Rules, falls into a
greater Fault than even the Author of
the little <HI>Ilias;</HI> instead of Beginning his
<HI>Thebaid</HI> with the Incestuous Birth of <HI>E∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eocles</HI>
and <HI>Polynices,</HI> he begins it with
the Rape of <HI>Europa,</HI> the Occasion of
the Founding of <HI>Thebes.</HI></P>
<P>148. <HI>Semper ad eventum festinat.</HI>] Still
going forward to the End of his Sub∣ject,
he makes use of no <HI>Episode</HI> but
what leads to it. The End of the <HI>Ilias</HI>
is <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Vengeance. <HI>Statius,</HI> instead
of going forward to the End of his
Action, seems afraid of coming to it,
and flies back by <HI>Episodes,</HI> Independent
of his Subject.</P>
<P>149. <HI>Et in medias res, non secus ac no∣tas,
auditorem rapit.</HI>] A Passage of great
Importance, and very difficult: It has
been Interpreted, as if <HI>Horace</HI> would say,
that <HI>Homer</HI> presently transports his Rea∣ders
to the Middle of his Subject, to
hold them always in Desire and Hope
to the End of it. This, 'tis true, is
one of the greatest Beauties of an <HI>E∣pick</HI>
Poem, and <HI>Homer</HI> has not neglected
it, as <HI>Macrobius</HI> observes in the IId
Chapter of the XVth Book of his <HI>Sa∣turnalia;</HI>
but <HI>Horace</HI> having treated of
this Precept in the 42d and 43d Verses,
'tis not likely he should repeat it here:
Besides, <HI>Horace</HI> does not talk here of
what <HI>Homer</HI> does in the Beginning, but
what he does in the Sequel, thro' the
whole Course of the Poem, as appears
plainly by what goes before, <HI>Semper ad
eventum festinat, He always hasten'd to the
End of the Action.</HI> The true Sense of
this Passage is, <HI>Homer</HI> carries his Rea∣ders
swiftly over all Things that prece∣ded
the Action, he calls them <HI>medias
res,</HI> middle Things, either because he
places the Recital of 'em in the Course
of the Poem, after the Beginning, or
before the End; or because they are
Things which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call properly
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>middling, indifferent. Horace</HI> says,
the Poet passes swiftly over those Ad∣ventures,
as if they were known: And
such is <HI>Homer</HI>'s constant Practice; every
thing that precedes the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI>
and <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Vengeance, is related in the
Course of the Poem, as publick Events
known to all the World: This a Tra∣gick
Poet ought to observe, as well as
an Epick. <HI>Sophocles,</HI> in his <HI>Oedipus,</HI> pas∣ses
swiftly over every thing that pre∣cedes
the Action of his Tragedy.</P>
<P>150. <HI>Et quae desperat tractata nitescere
posse relinquit.</HI>] This is a Consequence
of what he said just before, That <HI>Homer</HI>
carries his Reader swiftly over every
Thing that precedes his Action; fearing
one might from thence believe he gave
the whole History. <HI>Horace</HI> shews the
Poet's Address, in not mentioning all
the Incidents of the Story, but making
a judicious Choice of them; leaving
those that were not susceptible of Or∣naments,
suitable to the Grandeur and
<PB N="266" REF="283"/>
Majesty of his Poem: He does not speak
of <HI>Leda</HI>'s Eggs, nor the Rape of <HI>Helen</HI>
in the <HI>Ilias,</HI> nor of the Sacrifice of <HI>I∣phige<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia,</HI>
nor of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Disguising
himself like a Girl; and thus a Tragick
Poet should reject all Incidents that do
not answer the Grandeur of his Sub∣ject.</P>
<P>151. <HI>Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa
remiscet.</HI>] The Soul of an <HI>Epick</HI> Poem,
is the Fable, which includes a general
Truth, made particular by the Applica∣tion
of Names. Thus the Truth con∣tain'd
in the <HI>Ilias</HI> is, That Union and
Subordination preserve States, and that
Discord and Disobedience destroy them:
The Fiction in which this Truth is
wrapt up is the Quarrel between <HI>Achilles</HI>
and <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> feign'd to be taken
from a known Story as the <HI>Trojan</HI> War,
to make it the more probable. In E∣pick
Poetry the Fiction goes always on
with the Truth; but 'tis not only Mo∣ral
Truth that <HI>Homer</HI> teaches in his
Fictions, sometimes also 'tis Physical
and Historical, which he enfolds in Fine
<HI>Fables,</HI> to render 'em the more Mar∣vellous,
and consequently the more A∣greeable.
None has succeeded so well
as himself in these <HI>Fables: Horace</HI> be∣gins
this Precept with them, and con∣tinues
it with the Mixture of the <HI>Fable
and the Truth. Sic veris falsa remisce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI>
Which is a perfect Explanation of <HI>Homer</HI>'s
Conduct, and all the Mystery of
an Epick Poem, according to <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s
Rules. The Poet first draws the <HI>Plan</HI> of
his <HI>Fable,</HI> which is not less a Fable than
any of <HI>Aesop</HI>'s; <HI>mentitur, he feigns.</HI> After
he has laid down this <HI>Plan,</HI> he must
make his Fable probable, and perswade
that it has been done, to have it be∣liev'd
that 'tis possible. To this Pur∣pose
he attributes it to certain known
Persons; he names the Places that were
the Scene of it, all which he takes from
a known Story, borrowing some true
Actions and Circumstances, which he ac∣commodates
to his Design. <HI>Sic veris
falsa remiscet;</HI> those Poets who have not,
like <HI>Homer,</HI> drawn the Plan of their
Poems, after they had sought out some
Hero in History, and chosen a true
Action done by that Hero, have never
succeeded: As <HI>Silius, Statius, Lucan,</HI> and
among the <HI>Greeks</HI> the Authors of the
<HI>Heracliade</HI> and <HI>Thesiade: Horace</HI> prescribes
this Rule in the XVIIIth Chapter of his
Art of Poetry, and it is the Foundation
of an Epick Poem.</P>
<P>152. <HI>Primo ne medium, medio ne dis∣crepit
imum.</HI>] He every where mixes the
Fable with the Truth, that the three
Parts of his Subject may be Conne∣cted
and Equal. The Middle, which is
the Knot, must answer to the Beginning;
and the End, which is the Unravelling of
it, to the Beginning and Middle. If Fiction
is us'd in one Part, and not in all, the
Parts will be so unequal and disjoynted
that they will not Compose one <HI>Whole:</HI>
Neither will the <HI>Marvellous,</HI> which is
produc'd more by Fiction than Truth,
reign thro' the Work as it ought to do.
This is also to be observed in <HI>Tra∣gedy.</HI></P>
<P>153. <HI>Tu, quid ego &amp; populus mecum
desideret audi.</HI>] He returns to the Man∣ners.
<HI>Tu, Thou,</HI> who writest Dramatick
Poems. All Poets, and not the <HI>Pi∣so's.</HI></P>
<P>154. <HI>Si plausoris eges aulaea ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entis.</HI>]

<P>156. <HI>Aetatis eujusque notandi sunt tibi

ought to be like, <HI>famam sequere;</HI> agree∣able,
<HI>Convenientia finge;</HI> and equal, <HI>Ser∣vetur
ad imum qualis ab incepto processe∣rit.</HI>
There wants still a fourth Quality:
They ought to be well express'd, well
distinguish'd, <HI>notandi sunt tibi mores.</HI> So
distinguish'd, that no Body may be able
to mistake them, that every one, when
he sees the Actions of the Person you
have form'd, may say, those are the
Actions of a Furious, a Passionate, an
<PB N="267" REF="284"/>
Ambitious, an Inconstant or Covetous
Man; and this, with the other Three,
make the Four Qualities which <HI>Aristotle</HI>
requires for the Manners; <HI>Horace</HI> only
inverts his Order, by putting that Qua∣lity
Last, which the Philosopher puts
First: But this changing the Order does
not change the Rule, and in the Main
is of no Consequence. <HI>Aristotle</HI> treats
of it in the XVIth Chap. of his Art of
Poetry.</P>
<P>157. <HI>Mobilibusque decor naturis dandus

Moveable Natures,</HI> that is, Age,
which always rolls on like a River, and
as it rolls gives different Inclinations,
which are what he calls <HI>decor,</HI> the Beau∣ty
proper to Age: Each Age having its
Beauties as well as each Season; to give
the <HI>Virile Age</HI> the Beauty of <HI>Youth,</HI> is to
deck <HI>Autumn</HI> with the Beauties of <HI>the
Spring.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Et Annis.] Horace</HI> is not satisfy'd with
saying, <HI>each Age,</HI> he says, <HI>each Year;</HI>
because the Inclinations of each Age
are not the same at the <HI>Beginning</HI> and
the <HI>End:</HI> There's an insensible Change,
which a Poet ought to know and di∣stinguish,
as a Painter ought to know
and distinguish the Changes of each
Season, and not make the <HI>End</HI> of the
Summer like its <HI>Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>158. <HI>Reddere qui voces jam scit puer.</HI>]
Children learn to speak by Imitation:
<HI>Horace</HI> therefore says, <HI>reddere Voces,</HI> to
render Words: He is running thro' the
four Ages of Mankind, which Tragick,
Comick, and Epick Poets ought alike
to understand how to distinguish well.
Infancy, the first, is not so necessary as
the other three, an Infant being seldom
introduc'd as an Actor; for which Rea∣son
<HI>Aristotle</HI> mentions only <HI>Youth, Man∣hood,</HI>
and <HI>old Age.</HI> The Qualities <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
ascribes here to Infancy remain also
in Youth, where that Philosopher com∣priz'd
'em.</P>

only from the softness of the
Brain, where Objects are easily imprest
and effac'd. Wherefore, according as
that Softness is greater or less, those
Changes are also the slower or swifer:
Whence it is that he says here of an
Infant, <HI>mutatur in horas,</HI> and afterwards
of a Young Man, <HI>amata relinquere per∣nix.</HI>

<PB N="269" REF="286"/>
the Stage, only horrible Ones, as
that of a Mother killing her Children;
nay it has been endeavour'd to be prov'd,
that Murders may be expos'd with Suc∣cess
from the Practice of <HI>Aeschylus, So∣phocles,</HI>
and <HI>Euripides. Eschylus</HI> in his
<HI>Ceophores,</HI> kills <HI>Agamemnon, Prometheus</HI>
and <HI>Clytemnestra,</HI> on the Stage. <HI>Soph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cles</HI>
does the same in his <HI>Electra,</HI> where <HI>O∣restes</HI>
kills his Mother. And <HI>Euripides</HI>
in his <HI>Alceste,</HI> who kills her on the
Stage. But this does not at all excuse
the defiling it with Blood. Neither are
these Allegations of those that defend it
True. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is not kill'd in sight
of the Audience, for the Chorus, who
hear his Cries in the Palace, resolve to
enter to his Assistance; and <HI>Prometheus</HI>
is carry'd off by a Tempest, which closes
the Scene. <HI>Scaliger</HI> is strangely mistaken
in this; especially as to <HI>Clytemnestra,</HI>
for she's so far from being kill'd in view
of the Spectators, that <HI>Orestes bids her
follow him, that he may kill her near the
Body of</HI> Egistheus. In <HI>Sophocles, Ore∣stes</HI>'s
Mother is in the Palace when she is
kill'd, as appears plainly by what <HI>Ele∣ctra</HI>
says to her Deliverers, upon their re∣entring
the Stage with their Hands
Bloody. True, <HI>Alceste</HI> in <HI>Euripides</HI> does
Die on the Stage. But she pines away;
her Woman cries out, <HI>She Languishes, she
dies away with her Sickness.</HI> She was not
Wounded behind the Scenes. She Dy'd,
but was not kill'd on the Stage. In <HI>So∣phocles,
Ajax</HI> is said to be kill'd on the
Stage, which is a Mistake too; for the
Poet has with very great Address plac'd
a Wood at the End of it, in which <HI>A∣jax</HI>
is Murder'd, the Spectators not
seeing it. <HI>Horace</HI> here puts <HI>Medea</HI> and
<HI>Atreus</HI> for all sorts of Tragick Stories.
For Murders cannot be allow'd on the
Stage, let 'em be of what Nature soever.
None but bad Poets, who had not Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius
enough to move by the Narration▪
have introduc'd Bloody Spectacles. <HI>Me∣dea</HI>
is a very fine Fable for a Tragedy
<HI>Horace</HI> does not condemn it, but he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

however breaks this Rule in his <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dea.</HI></P>
<P>186. <HI>Aut humana palam coquat ext.

who serv'd up his Nephews to his Bro∣ther
<HI>Thyestes</HI> their Father, for a Supper.
'Tis thought <HI>Sophocles</HI> wrote upon it, as
did the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet <HI>Accius,</HI> who direct∣ly
avoided what <HI>Horace</HI> forbids here.</P>
<P>187. <HI>Ant in avem Progne.</HI>] He speaks
now of other Incidents that shou'd not
be expos'd; such as wou'd be as Ridi∣culous
to see as agreeable to read. Of
this Kind are all <HI>Metamorphoses.</HI> For
Instance, <HI>Progne</HI> into a Swallow, <HI>Philomel</HI>
into a Nightingale, and the like. In <HI>E∣pick</HI>
Poetry, they may be brought in by
Narration. As the Metamorphoses of
<HI>Ʋlysses</HI>'s Ship into Stone, and <HI>Aen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as</HI>'s
into <HI>Nymphs,</HI> in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>188. <HI>Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic, incre∣dulus
odi.</HI>] Some things are to be shewn
in Tragedy, some to be told; if what
should be told is shewn, and what should
be shewn, told, 'twill spoil the Poem. To
shew what you should tell is the greatest
Fault. <HI>Horace</HI> explains a Hint of <HI>Ari∣stotle's</HI>
in his XVIth Book, and gives the
Reason as well as the Precept. For
Prodigies expos'd to Sight are incredi∣ble.
They are only tolerable in Narra∣tions.</P>
<P>189. <HI>Neve minor, neu sit quinto productior
actu.] Ascanius Pedianus</HI> says the same.
This Rule is grounded on the constant
Practice of the Ancients. Tho' 'tis not
mention'd, 'tis imply'd in <HI>Aristotle's Art
of Poetry,</HI> where he tells us, <HI>Poets ought
to give their Subjects not an Arbitrary but
a Certain Extent.</HI> As this <HI>Extent</HI> must
be <HI>Certain,</HI> so it must be Just, which is
exactly this Division into Five <HI>Acts</HI>-Practis'd
in all Regular Plays, as well An∣cient
as Modern. The <HI>Greeks</HI> had no
Term that signify'd <HI>Act,</HI> but they had
another Division better than the <HI>Latins,</HI>
or Ours. For by marking the Extent of
Tragedy in general, it mark'd also the
different Nature of its Parts in particular,
which that of the <HI>Latins</HI> and Ours do not
do. By dividing Tragedy into Five
Acts, the Latin and Modern Poets di∣vide
it into five like Parts, which is Vicious.
This Matter is Discours'd of at large in
the Notes on the XIIth Chapter of <HI>A∣ristotle's
Art of Poetry.</HI> If Plays of five
Acts are of a just Extent, those of three
are defective. Plays of three Acts have
the Defect which <HI>Aristotle</HI> finds in little
Objects. The Sight is confounded, and
<PB N="270" REF="287"/>
they are either Naked of, or Loaded
with Incidents. Plays of Six or Seven
<HI>Acts</HI> would have the Defect of Great
Objects. The Spectators would lose the
Idea of the whole, on Account of its
excessive Bigness, wherefore the Just
Medium lies in the five <HI>Acts.</HI> In which
there's Room for the variety of Inci∣dents
necessary for the Passions. Three
Acts are not to be born with in any
thing but Farces, which supply the Places
of the <HI>Satyrs and Exodia</HI> of the Anci∣ents.
Five Acts are so essential and ne∣cessary
to a Perfect Dramatick Poem,
that this Rule is not once broken by the
Greeks and Latins. <HI>Euripides</HI> observes it
even in his <HI>Cyclops,</HI> a Satyrick Play, or
rather a Pastoral, wherein he might have
taken more Liberty than in a regular
<HI>Tragedy.</HI> Yet tho' that Piece consists of
but 800 Verses, he has very exactly
mark'd the Division of five <HI>Acts. Mar∣cus
Antoninus</HI> has this Rule in View,
when he compares Life to a Theatrical
Piece. He is comforting a Young Man
who was Dying, and answers him, <HI>I have
not yet finish'd the Five Acts, I have play'd
but Three. But in Life,</HI> reply'd the Em∣peror,
<HI>Three Acts are a Compleat Play.</HI>
If it is objected that Monsieur <HI>Racine</HI>
wrote a Play of Three Acts; tho' we
must not accuse him as ignorant of the
Rules of his Art, we may very well con∣clude
he did not intend an entirely Re∣gular
Play. He was not willing to leave
his Story, which in its Simplicity could
not easily furnish out five Acts, and
thought much more of preserving the
Holiness and Majesty of the Original,
than by multiplying Incidents to give
it a just Extent.</P>
<P>191. <HI>Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vin∣dice
nodus.</HI>] The Tragick Poets were
blam'd of Old for that, when they cou'd
not unravel their Plots, they had re∣course
to a Divinity, who came in a Ma∣chine
and did it for them, as is done
in the <HI>Medea</HI> of <HI>Euripides.</HI> This Rule
is taken from <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who does not,
however, quite exclude Machines, but
such only as are not born of the Subject,
either necessarily or probably; and this
is the True Sentiment of <HI>Horace,</HI> who
says, Machines should never be made use
of, but when the Knot deserves that a
God should come to untie it. We read
in <HI>Aristotle,</HI> Chap. XVI. <HI>In the Man∣ners,
as well as in the Disposition of the
Subject, the Poet must have a Regard to
what's either Necessary or Probable, so that
the Events may happen either necessarily or
probably. From whence 'tis evident that
the Ʋnravelling the Plot ought to be pro∣duc'd
by the Plot it self, without making
use of the help of a Machine, as in the
Medea.</HI> This relates only to Dramatick
Poetry, for in <HI>Epick</HI> Machines are ab∣solutely
necessary.</P>
<P><HI>Dignus vindice nodus.</HI>] A happy Ex∣pression
taken from the <HI>Roman</HI> Law,
which calls a Man <HI>Vindicem,</HI> who sets a
Slave at Liberty. Thus <HI>Horace</HI> looks on
an entangled Piece, as a Slave that stands
in need of a God to come and set him
at Liberty.</P>
<P>192. <HI>Nec quarta loqui persona laboret.</HI>] The
Ancient Tragick Poets seldom introduc'd
above Two Persons speaking in a Scene,
Three were rarely to be met with, and
Four hardly ever. So <HI>Diomedes</HI> writes,
<HI>In Graeco Dramate fere tres personaesolae
agunt.</HI> But it may happen there may
be Occasion for Four to speak. Monsieur
<HI>D'Aubignac</HI> pretends <HI>Horace</HI> does not en∣tirely
condemn the introducing a Fourth
Person, but that a Fourth Person shou'd
not force himself to speak. The Text
will bear such a Construction, and our
Poets have added a Fifth to this Fourth
Person. Nay <HI>Scaliger</HI> in the IIId Book
of his <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> says, <HI>They make no
Scruple of bringing a Fourth Person into
a Scene. As</HI> Aristophanes'<HI>s Ghost in the
Froggs, the same in his</HI> Plutus <HI>and in his
Birds.</HI> However what <HI>Scaliger</HI> says of
<HI>Aristophanes</HI> does not decide the Dispute.
For <HI>Horace</HI> talks of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and not of
<HI>Comedy,</HI> in which no Body questions a
great deal more Liberty may be taken.
'Tis very likely <HI>Horace's</HI> Rule is Simple,
and without Restriction, drawn from the
Common Practice of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and its
being the most convenient, the most Na∣tural,
and the most Safe Way. <HI>Aristotle</HI>
informs us, <HI>Eschylus</HI> invented a Principal
Person, which he joyn'd to him who ap∣pear'd
between the Songs of the Chorus,
and that <HI>Sophecles</HI> added a Third. Ne∣vertheless
there are Three Actors to be
met with in some of <HI>Eschylus</HI>'s Plays.
<PB N="271" REF="288"/>
See the Remarks on the IVth Chapter
of that Philosopher's <HI>Art of Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>193. <HI>Actoris partes chorus, officiumque virile
defendat.</HI>] The Chorus were a Company
of Actors, who supply'd the Place of
those who ought probably to be present
at the Action represented, and were con∣cern'd
in it. 'Twas the Foundation of
all the Probability of Dramatick Poetry,
which since it has lost its Chorus has
lost at least half of its Verisimility and
greatest Ornament, rendring our Modern
Tragedy no more than the Shadow of
the Ancient. The <HI>Chorus</HI> had two Fun∣ctions.
For in the Course of the <HI>Acts,</HI>
they were to join in the Action, and act
a Part, the <HI>Coriphaus</HI> speaking alone in
the Name of all the rest, and after each
Act all the <HI>Chorus</HI> was to Note the In∣terval
by their Songs. <HI>Horace</HI> prescribes
here two Rules for these two Functi∣ons
of the <HI>Chorus.</HI> The first is contain'd
in this Verse,
<Q>Actoris Partes Chorus officiumque virile de∣fendat.</Q></P>
<P>The Chorus must act the Part of an A∣ctor,
and perform the Functions of a single
Person. '<HI>Tis a Translation or Explana∣tion
of a Passage in</HI> Aristotle's Art of
Poetry, <HI>wherein 'tis said,</HI> The Chorus must
Act the Part of an Actor, be one of the
Persons of the Place, and make a Part of
the whole. <HI>The Second Function is con∣tain'd
in the following Remarks.</HI></P>
<P>194. <HI>Ne quid medios intercinat actus,
quod non proposito conducat.</HI>] What the
Chorus sung between the <HI>Acts</HI> to mark
the <HI>Intervals:</HI> Which Song <HI>Horace</HI> will
have to agree with the Subject, that is,
be taken from it, and help to the for∣warding
it. <HI>Aristotle</HI> says, <HI>Sophocles</HI> and
<HI>Euripides</HI> should be imitated in this; and
those who do otherwise, <HI>incerta canunt,
sing inserted Songs,</HI> as suitable to one
Tragedy as another. <HI>Sophocles</HI> is the
true Model for the Constitution of Cho∣rus's:
<HI>Euripides</HI> was sometimes deficient
in this, tho' <HI>Scaliger</HI> prefers his Con∣duct
to <HI>Sophocles</HI>'s; <HI>Aristophanes</HI> blames
<HI>Euripides</HI> for it, in his <HI>Acharnenses, And
those,</HI> says he, <HI>who Compose his Chorus
stand there like Fools:</HI> Upon which the
<HI>Scholiast</HI> makes this Judicious Remark,
Aristophanes <HI>in this Verse laughs at</HI> Eu∣ripides
<HI>for introducing Chorus's that do not
sing Things agreeable to the Subject, but
Stories that are Foreign to it,</HI> as in his
<HI>Phoenicians.</HI></P>
<P>196. <HI>Ille bonis faveatque.</HI>] In these six
Verses <HI>Horace</HI> tells us what was the Bu∣siness
of the <HI>Chorus: Scaliger</HI> forgets a
great deal of it. The Chorus always
took the Part of Honest Men; the Thea∣tre
was then the School of Piety and
Justice better taught there than in the
Temples. <HI>Et concilietur amicts.</HI> Some
have read <HI>&amp; consilietur amicis,</HI> to give
Council to its Friends: That was indeed
one of the Duties of the Chorus; but
I question whether there are any Instan∣ces
of <HI>consiliari,</HI> to express giving Coun∣sel;
'till I meet with one I will rather
chuse to read <HI>&amp; concilietur amicis,</HI> that is
it joyn'd with its Friends, and supported
their Interests.</P>
<P>197. <HI>Et regat iratos.</HI>] As in <HI>Oedipus,</HI>
the Chorus endeavours to moderate that
Prince's Choler against <HI>Tiresias,</HI> and <HI>Ti∣resias</HI>'s
against him.</P>
<P><HI>Et amet peccare timentes.</HI>] The Cho∣rus
was so Religious that it always de∣clar'd
for the Innocent against the
Guilty.</P>
<P>198. <HI>Ille dapes laudet mensae brevis.</HI>]
The Chorus of Tragedy may have fre∣quent
Occasions to commend Sobriety,
one of the principal Moral Virtues.</P>
<P>199. <HI>Ille salubrem, justitiam, legesque.</HI>]
The Chorus of <HI>Oedipus</HI> furnishes us with
wonderful Examples of what <HI>Horace</HI>
writes on this Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Et apertis otia portis.</HI>] As in that fine
Chorus of <HI>Euripides,</HI> when addressing to
the Queen of Peace, it says,
<Q><L>Queen of Riches, happy Peace,</L>
<L>Fairest of the Goddesses;</L>
<L>With what Impatience have I waited,</L>
<L>How long expected you in vain?</L>
<L>I fear Old Age will now destroy me</L>
<L>Before I shall behold your Beauty,</L>
<L>Before your Dances I behold</L>
<L>So full of Grace, before I see</L>
<L>Your Crowns, your Feasts, and hear your
Songs.</L></Q></P>
<P>200. <HI>Ille tegat commissa.</HI>] The most
Essential Qualities of the Chorus, are
<PB N="272" REF="289"/>
Fidelity and Secrecy, without which all
Verisimility is lost, and the Poem spoilt.
These Qualities depend on the Poet's
Address, who ought so to chuse his Chorus,
that its own Interest may engage it to
Conceal what it is entrusted with, and
to take care, that in concealing it,
it does nothing against its Duty. <HI>Eu∣ripides</HI>
has committed a Fault of this
Kind▪ in his <HI>Medea,</HI> who tho' a Stranger
at <HI>Cerimb,</HI> contrives the Death of her
Rival the King of <HI>Corinth's</HI> Daughter,
as also that of the King, and after∣wards
to Kill her own Children, tells
the Chorus, compos'd of <HI>Corinthian</HI> Wo∣men,
the King's Subjects, her Design,
and yet they are so Faithful to this Fo∣reigner,
that they do not discover it to
their Natural Prince. The Chorus, 'tis
time, must be <HI>faithful,</HI> but without vio∣lating
the Laws of Nature, or the Laws
of God: The Fidelity of the <HI>Corinthian</HI>
Women to <HI>Media</HI> is Criminal; the <HI>Greek</HI>
Scholiasts endeavours to excuse it, by say∣ing,
that the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Women being
Free, declar'd for Justice, as Chorus's
ought to do, which Excuse is ridiculous
and impious; and the same <HI>Euripides,</HI>
who has made this <HI>Chorinthian</HI> Chorus so
faithful, when it should not have been
so, makes the Chorus of <HI>Creusa's</HI> Wait∣ing
Women in <HI>ION,</HI> fail in their Fide∣lity
to <HI>Xuthus,</HI> and reveal her Husband's
Secret to their Mistress, tho' he had
Commanded them, on Pain of Death,
not to do it. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>race</HI>'s Rule is, indeed,
not so General, but it may admit of
some Exception; but I can much less
forgive <HI>Euripides</HI> for the Treachery com∣mitted
in <HI>Ip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igenia</HI> in <HI>Tauris;</HI> the Chorus
is compos'd of <HI>Grecian</HI> Women, and this
Princess begs them to tell no Body of
her Plot to carry off the Statue of <HI>Di∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI>
promising to take them with her.
The Women are Faithful to her, and
yet she flies away alone with <HI>Orestes,</HI> and
abandons them to the Rage of <HI>Thoas,</HI>
who would certainly have severely pun∣ish'd
them, had not <HI>Minerva</HI> come to
their Deliverance.</P>

the Justice and Piety of the Chorus;
the Ancients blame <HI>Euripides,</HI> because
his Chorus's are not always so much
concern'd as they ought to be, for the
Unhappy. <HI>Sophocles</HI> never err'd once in
this Particular.</P>
<P>202. <HI>Tibia non ut nunc, Orichalco vincta.</HI>]
The eighteen following Verses are Ob∣scure.
After having spoken of the Cho∣rus's
in Tragedy, he speaks of the
Changes that had happen'd in the Mu∣sick,
and the Verse, and the better to
Explain it, makes use of a very just Ex∣ample,
saying, that as the Chorus's of
the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mans</HI> Plays, which were at first
plain, with one verry little Flute, and
without any Ornament, chang<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the
Tone when the <HI>Roman</HI> People began
to be more Powerful and Rich, Riches
and Luxury having introduc'd the same
Change in Verse and Musick, as in Man∣ners;
so the same Thing happen'd to
the Chorus of the <HI>Greek Tragedies,</HI> the
Musick of which was at first as Plain as
the Verse, but by degrees it became more
Harmonious and Strong, and the Mea∣sure
of the Verse was accommodated to
the Musick; in which Measure then soon
imitated the Dignity and Majesty of the
Oracles.</P>

of the ancient Musick: antiquae
Musica severitas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fidibus.] Horace</HI> assures us the
ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedy made use of
the Lyre; and indeed the Lyre was

instead of Plainness an Extravagance of
Language was affected, little different
<PB N="274" REF="291"/>
from that of the Priests in pronouncing
their Oracles. <HI>Horace</HI> here falls on the
<HI>Greek</HI> Tragick Poets, who are very often
Bombast, and affecting the <HI>Sublime,

<HI>Qui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tilien, praecepita. Longinus</HI> Opposes

Tragedy came to its Perfection; where∣as
he is not talking of Tragedy in ge∣neral,
but of the <HI>Chorus,</HI> and shews how
it came to be Corrupted: One of the
Functions of the <HI>Chorus</HI> was to Comfort
the Afflicted, which ought to be per∣form'd
with a Noble Simplicity; but
from giving Advice, the Poets, in Time,
gave entirely into <HI>Prophesie,</HI> as the Cho∣rus
of <HI>Aeschylus: Agamemnon</HI> says, <HI>I
Prophesie without Mission and without Wa∣ges.
Horace</HI> here condemus the Bombast

<HI>Satyrick Poetry</HI> of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> a sort of
Poetry between Comedy and Tragedy:
<HI>Horace</HI> seems here to attribute the In∣vention
of it to <HI>Thespis: He who dispu∣red
the Prize of Tragedy, so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n produc'd
Satyrs;</HI> but there are two Reasons a∣gainst
this Opinion: The first is, we
read no where of <HI>Thispis</HI>'s <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yrick Pieces;</HI>
and the second, that the Disputes for
the Prize of Tragick Poetry were not
in Use in <HI>Thespi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Time, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in∣forms
us in the Life of <HI>Solon. Suidas</HI>
is positive that <HI>Pratiuas</HI> was the Inventer
of <HI>Satyrs.</HI> He liv'd a few Years after the
Death of <HI>Thespis;</HI>'tis therefore likely
<HI>Horace</HI> means him, and that this Poet,
after having disputed the Prize of <HI>Tra∣gedy,</HI>
in a very little while wrote <HI>Satyrs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tragido carmine certavit.</HI>] The Disputes
of the Prize of Tragick Poetry were by
the Poets producing their Pieces to be
play'd in Publick:'Tis plain by this Pas∣sage,
that these Disputes were more An∣cient
than the Invention of <HI>Satyrs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ob hircum.</HI>] The Poet who obtain'd
the Prize had a Goat for his Reward;
it being the usual Sacrifice to <HI>Bacchus,</HI>
who presided over Tragedy; and some
will have it <HI>Tragedy</HI> takes its Name from
this very Goat, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>The Song of

<P>221. <HI>Agrestes Satyros nudavit.</HI>] Shew'd
<HI>Satyrs</HI> Naked, and without Disguise, that
is, bad Satyrick Pieces play'd, wherein
Satyrs compos'd the Chorus, with Fa∣ther
<HI>Silenus</HI> at their Head: <HI>Demetrius
Phalereus</HI> says, <HI>No Body can ever form a
Tragedy, wherein Raillery and Langhter
may be introduc'd; for he would then write
a Satyr.</HI> There's but one remaining of
all the Satyrick Pieces of the Ancients,
which is the <HI>Cyclop</HI> of <HI>Euripides,</HI> and
that's sufficient to Justifie what <HI>Horace</HI> has
written of them, he says <HI>Agrestes Sa∣tyros,</HI>
as <HI>Euripides</HI> said of the <HI>Cyclop,</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>222. <HI>Et asper incolumi gravitate jocum
tentavit.</HI>] He endeavour'd to bring Rail∣lery
and Pleasantry into Satyrick Pieces,
without offending the Gravity of Tra∣gedy:
The Poet must always remember
he is writing a sort of Tragedy, and
have a Care of falling into mean Rail∣lery,
which is only excusable in Come∣dy.
<HI>Tiberius</HI> in the <HI>Cyclop</HI> rallies <HI>Ʋlys∣ses,</HI>
and yet preserves the Gravity of
Tragedy. <HI>I know this Famous Prater, this
Noble Sprig of</HI> Sisyphus. <HI>Horace</HI> uses the
Word <HI>Asper, Sharp</HI> to express its Raillery.</P>
<P>223. <HI>Illecebris erat &amp; gratâ novitate
morandus spectator.</HI>] He attributes the
Origin of Satyrs to the Audience's De∣sire
of Novelty: <HI>Diomedes,</HI> and <HI>Marius
Victorinus,</HI> have said the same Thing.
<HI>Satyros induxerunt Ludendi Causa, jo∣candique,
ut simul Spectator inter Res Tra∣gi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as
seriasque, Satyrorum quoque jocis &amp;
lusibus delectaretur.</HI> The Poets however
had a more useful and specious Pretence
for it: Tragedy was at first only a Cho∣rus,
who sung the Praises of <HI>Bacchus;</HI>
Actors were afterwards introduc'd, and
Scenes and Acts plac'd between their
Songs; Tragedy became so alter'd at
last, that the Chorus was almost lost in
it, insomuch, that it was a Saying, <HI>It
<PB N="175" REF="292"/>
makes not at all for</HI> Bacchus. The People
were not for abolishing a good Old Cu∣stom;
and the Poets, in Honour of <HI>Bac∣chus,</HI>
and to give them Satisfaction, re∣solv'd
to Establish the Ancient Chorus,
and in such an agreeable Manner, that
it should be improv'd by the Addition
of Pleasantry; this was the Origin of
<HI>Satyrs,</HI> wherein the Chorus mingled the
Praises of <HI>Bacchus.</HI></P>
<P>224. <HI>Functusque sacris, &amp; potus &amp; Ex∣lex.</HI>]
The three Reasons for the Inven∣tion
of something to divert the Audi∣ence.
I. They offer'd a Sacrifice, in
which there was no want of Meat and
Wine. 2. They drank chearfully at that
Festival. 3. They were for any Thing
frolicksome and extravagant.</P>
<P>225. <HI>Verum it a risores, it a commendare
dicaces.</HI>] Tho' on those Festivals the
People were disorderly, their vicious
Tastes must not be humour'd with <HI>Im∣pudent
Satyrs;</HI> they must be half Serious
to correct those Vitious Tasts and half
Pleasant, to be suited to the Festival:
It may be objected, How comes it
<HI>Horace</HI> lays down Rules for the Sa∣tyrick
Pieces of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> of what
use could these Rules be to the <HI>Romans?</HI>
In Answer, <HI>Horace</HI> prescrib'd those Rules,
because the <HI>Romans</HI> imitated the <HI>Satyrs,</HI>
in their <HI>Attellanes,</HI> as in <HI>Diomedes. There's
a third sort of</HI> Roman <HI>Plays call'd</HI> Attel∣lanes,
<HI>from</HI> Attella, <HI>a City in</HI> Tuscany,
<HI>where they began, which in their Subject
and Raillery are entirely like the satyrick
Pieces of the</HI> Greeks; the only difference
being, in the latter, Satyrs or other Re∣diculous
Actors were introduc'd, as <HI>Au∣tolycus,
Burris,</HI> &amp;c. and in the <HI>Attellanes,</HI>
obscene Actors, as <HI>Marcus:</HI> If <HI>Diomedes</HI>
is not mistaken, his <HI>Personoe obscen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> are
the same <HI>Horace</HI> calls <HI>Satyrs;</HI> but <HI>Vossius</HI>
pretends it should be read <HI>person<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e osc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
Oscan</HI> or <HI>Tuscan</HI> Actors; obscene Per∣sons
being rather in the <HI>Mimes</HI> than in
the <HI>Attellanes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> By what <HI>Horace</HI> says,'tis
unquestionable that there were <HI>Satyrs,</HI>
and'tis doubtless out of one of them
<HI>Marcus Victorinus</HI> took that Verse,
<Q>Agite, fugite, quatite Satyri.</Q>
<HI>Perhaps, instead of</HI> Tuscan <HI>Actors, the</HI>
Romans <HI>afterwards introdcu'd Satyrs into
these</HI> Attellan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. <HI>This Passage to be clear
should run thus:</HI> In our <HI>Attellane</HI> Plays
we have imitated the Satyrick Tragedies of
the <HI>Greeks;</HI> but tho' the Occasions on which
they are play'd be still the same, and the
People are not less mad, yet we ought not to
Conform to their vitious Appetites; we
should give'em some of those Rallying
and Poignant Satyrs, and make'em pass,

<HI>The principal Actor in</HI> Euripides'<HI>s</HI> Cy∣clop

<P>228. <HI>Regali conspectus in auro nuper &amp;

of Tragedy was disputed, had common∣ly
four Tragedies represented, the last
of which was a Saryrick Piece. The
four were term'd <HI>Tetralogie,</HI> and were
written on the same Subject as <HI>Ʋlysses,
Achilles, Orestes,</HI> &amp;c. they had the same
Name, the Hero's of the Play: The <HI>O∣restiade</HI>
of <HI>Eschylus,</HI> is so call'd, to ex∣press
the four Tragedies written on the
Adventures of <HI>Orestes.</HI> There were also
<HI>Tetralogies,</HI> where the four Pieces were
written on different Subjects: We read
of a <HI>Tetralogie</HI> of <HI>Euripides,</HI> which con∣sisted
of four Plays, on so many different
Fables; as the <HI>Medea,</HI> the <HI>Philoctetes,</HI>
the <HI>Dictys,</HI> and the <HI>Reapers;</HI> but those
that were on the Adventures of the
same Hero were most esteem'd, as being
most difficult. In the <HI>Frogs</HI> of <HI>Aristopha∣nes,
Euripides</HI> bids <HI>Eschylus, Rehearse the
first Prologue of his</HI> Orestiade. The <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
had no <HI>Tetralogies:</HI> They wrote a
Tragedy, and an <HI>Attellane,</HI> on the same
Hero; the same Actor appear'd in both;
for which Reason <HI>Horace</HI> carefully re∣commends
to the Poet so to order it,
that the Hero who was seen deckt in
Gold and Purple, <HI>Nuper,</HI> in the first
<PB N="276" REF="293"/>
Play, the <HI>Tragedy,</HI> might not dwindle in
the second, the <HI>Attellane,</HI> to a Comick
Character: In a Word, the Hero in the
<HI>Attellant</HI> should keep the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dle,</HI> be∣tween
the <HI>Sublime</HI> of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and the
<HI>Meaness</HI> of <HI>Comedy:</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> had
something like <HI>Tetralog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> they had
three Plays acted, one after another,
on the same Subject; the first a real
Tragedy; the second the <HI>Attellane;</HI> the
third a <HI>Satyr</HI> or Exode, a kind of Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce
of one Act; they were all acted in the

<P><HI>Nuper.</HI>] This proves, that the same
Actor play'd in the <HI>Attellane,</HI> as play'd
in the Tragedy: <HI>Plautus</HI> tells us as much
in the Prologue to his <HI>Men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chmes, Haec

Play another it shall be another City after
the same manner as we change the Band
of Players; for the same Actor is sometimes
a Slave, sometimes a Merchant, sometimes
a Young Man, sometimes an Old one. some∣times

this sung any where and any how,
as it happen'd. The other is his Smear∣ing
of 'em with Lees of Winc, whereas
before they play'd without doing any
thing to their Faces. The chief Alte∣ration
of all is omitted by these Com∣mentators,
which is <HI>Thespis</HI>'s throwing
in an Actor among the <HI>Chorus,</HI> to ease
them, and give 'em a Breathing Time;
which Actor rehear'd an Adventure of
some Illustrious Person, which Rehearsal
and Adventure gave Rise to the Fable
and Persons of the Drama; wherefore
he says, <HI>quae canaerent agerentque.</HI> They
<HI>Sung</HI> and <HI>Acted;</HI> they Sung the Chorus,
<HI>they acted</HI> the Actor. This addition of
one Actor was doubtless very Enter∣taining
to the People, who before had
been only us'd to hear the Chorus. See
the IVth Chapter of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Art of
Poetry.</HI> These Actors playing in a Cart
a Sort of Droll Pieces, full of Scandal,
gave occasion to a Greek Proverb, <HI>He

<P>278. <HI>Post hunc Personae pallaeque repertor

put <HI>Aesebylus</HI> upon making more con∣siderable
Ones. He brought out his A∣ctors
with Vizards; for <HI>Personae</HI> here is a
<HI>Vizard,</HI> and not a <HI>Person,</HI> He dress'd
them in Robes with Trains; he put the
Buskin on them, and instead of a Cart
built a Stage for them, changing the
Stile from Burlesque to Grave and Se∣rious.
I wonder <HI>Horace</HI> makes no men∣tion
of farther Alterations, of his of
greater Consequence; for <HI>Aristotle</HI> tells
us he added another Actor to <HI>Thespis</HI>'s
that he lessen'd the Songs of the Chorus,
and invented a Principal Part. 'Tis
strange that <HI>Horace</HI> shou'd not mention
that Improvement, and as strange that

pretends these Four Verses should
come after the 250th, where <HI>Horace</HI>
speaks of <HI>Satyrs,</HI> to which he affirms
the Old Comedy succeeded. But this
is their True Place. When <HI>Horace</HI> says,
the Old Comedy succeeded <HI>Thespis</HI> and
<HI>Aeschylus</HI>'s Plays, he does not mean
that there were no Tragick Poets after
them, nor wou'd he have it understood
that the Old Comedy ow'd its <HI>Origin</HI>
to Tragedy. His Design is to shew us
that Comedy was cultivated. after Tra∣gedy
had arriv'd to a Degree of Per∣fection,
which is also <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Opinion.
<HI>Comedy,</HI> says he, <HI>was not cultivated from
the Beginning, as Tragedy was,</HI> &amp;c. Af∣ter
the Grave and Serious Part of the
first Tragedies was separated from the Co∣mick,
the Poets stuck to the Former
and neglected the Latter. After Tragedy
was arriv'd at Perfection, the Poets be∣gan
to cultivate Comedy even in <HI>Aeschy∣lus</HI>'s
Time, as did <HI>Chionides, Magnes</HI> and
<HI>Phormus,</HI> with Success. And soon after
<HI>Aeschylus</HI>'s Death, Comedy also arriv'd
to Perfection in the Works of <HI>Cratinus,
Plato, Epicharmes, Crates, Eupolis, Aristo∣phanes,</HI>
who were Contemporaries. Where∣fore
<HI>Horace</HI> had Reason to say <HI>Successit
vetus his Comaedia, Marcus Antoninus</HI> tells
us in the XIth Book, <HI>After Tragedy the
Old Comedy appear'd.</HI> Does <HI>Marcus An∣tonius</HI>
mean the <HI>Satyrick</HI> Tragedy?
'Twould be Ridiculous to suppose it.
For it is easie to prove, that the Old
Comedy came before the Satyrick Pieces.
Monsieur <HI>Boileau</HI> in his Poetry speaks of
this Matter,
<Q><L>To the Success of the First Tragick Show,</L>
<L>Th' Old Comedy in <HI>Greece</HI> its Birth did
Owe.</L></Q>
He means, as <HI>Horace</HI> does, Comedy was
cultivated after Tragedy was perfect.</P>
<P>282. <HI>Sed in vitium libertas excidit.</HI>]
The Old Comedy was of two sorts;
that which was properly so call'd, in
which was no Fable, the Poets reprov'd
Vice openly, and spar'd neither Citizens
not Magistrates, whose Names, and e∣ven
the Likness of their Faces, they
brought on the Stage. But when <HI>Ly∣sander</HI>
had made himself Master of <HI>A∣thens,</HI>
and chang'd the Government from
a Democracy into an Aristocracy, put∣ting
it into the Hands of the <HI>Thirty Ty∣rants,</HI>
such a Liberry which was not
compatible with Tyranny, displeas'd, and
the Poets were forbidden to Name those
whose Actions, they represented, Ficti∣rious
Names were then us'd, but the
Characters so well painted, that the Per∣sons
cou'd not be mistaken. This was
call'd the <HI>Middle Comedy,</HI> which lasted
till <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Time, who having made
himself Master of <HI>Greece,</HI> restrain'd the
Licentiousness it had, by degrees, come
to. This gave Rise to the <HI>New Comedy,</HI>
being an Imitation of Common Life,
with feign'd Stories and Supposititious
Names. <HI>Horace</HI> speaks of the last Change.

<P>284. <HI>Chorusque turpiter obticuit, sublato

Reformation made in the Old Comedy.
For there was a Chorus in the <HI>Middle;</HI>
but of the Law against the Poets of the
<HI>Latter,</HI> who being forbidden to fall on
the Vices of their Fellow-Citizens, and
exposing them Personally on the Stage,
suppress'd the Chorus, which was ap∣ply'd
particularly to that Use, as ap∣pears
in the <HI>Parabasus</HI> of <HI>Aristophanes</HI>'s
Chorus's, where the Poet digresses to
talk of himself, or the Publick; which
not being allow'd afterwards in the <HI>New
Comedy,</HI> there was no Chorus in it, as
may be seen in <HI>Menander</HI>'s Plays. As
there's no Chorus in <HI>Terence</HI>'s and <HI>Plau∣tus</HI>'s
of the same Kind with the <HI>New
Comedy,</HI> they are purely Moral; every
thing is feign'd, both <HI>Subjects</HI> and <HI>Names,</HI>

Togatae</HI> is the Genius which comprehends
the two Kinds of <HI>Roman</HI> Comedies,
<HI>praetextae</HI> is one of the <HI>Species</HI> compre∣hended
under the <HI>Genius,</HI> wherefore they
are here <HI>Togatae,</HI> and conseqnently <HI>Co∣medies</HI>
and not <HI>Tragedies;</HI> since Trage∣dies
were never call'd <HI>Togatae.</HI> As the
<HI>Comedies</HI> whose Stories were taken from
the <HI>Greek</HI> were call'd <HI>palli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tae:</HI> So the
<HI>Comedies</HI> whose Stories were <HI>Roman</HI> were
call'd <HI>togatae:</HI> A general Name given
those <HI>Roman</HI> Plays, because the <HI>Toga</HI>
was the Habit of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as the
<HI>Pallium</HI> was that of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> There
were two Kinds of this <HI>Togatae,</HI> and these
two Kinds subdivided into two other,
each of which had a Name given it ac∣cording
to its Subject and Actors. Those
Comedies whose Subjects were Grave, and
their Actors represented the chief Per∣son
in the State, were called <HI>Praetextae,</HI>
from the Habit <HI>praetextae</HI> wore by the Ma∣gistrates,
the Robe edg'd with <HI>Purple;</HI>
those that were less Grave, and repre∣sented
Inferior Persons, were term'd <HI>to∣gatae.
Melissus</HI> invented a Third Sort,
<HI>Trabeates,</HI> from their representing Sol∣diers
and Knights, whose Habit was cal∣led
<HI>Trae<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> The Comedies below these, re∣presenting
the Actions of the Meaner
People, were term'd <HI>Tabernaria.</HI> There are
none of these Plays extant, neither the
<HI>Praetextae</HI> not <HI>Togatae.</HI> There were Poets
for each Kind, as <HI>Afranius Titinius</HI> and
<HI>Quintius Alta,</HI> who wrote <HI>Togatas;</HI> and
<HI>Pacuvius</HI> and <HI>Accius,</HI> who wrote the <HI>Prae∣textae.</HI>
The former were reckon'd true
Comick Poets, as <HI>Horace</HI> says in the Ist
Epistle of the IId Book.</P>
<Q>Dicitur Afrani toga convenisse Menandre.</Q>
<P>He afterwards places <HI>Atta</HI> among the
Comick Poets. <HI>Pacuvius</HI> and <HI>Accius</HI> wrote
the Plays call'd <HI>Praetextae,</HI> Comedies of
a more serious Cast. The two latter
have been stil'd Tragick Poets, <HI>Traga∣diae
Scriptores Accius atque Pacuvius cla∣rissimi;</HI>
and consequently these <HI>Praetextae</HI>
have been thought to be Tragedies; but
they were not call'd Tragick Poets for
their <HI>Praetextae,</HI> but for <HI>Tragedies</HI> written
by them. <HI>Pacuvius</HI> wrote <HI>Anobyses, An∣tiope,</HI>
&amp;c. <HI>Accius, Achilles, Aegifthe∣us,
Alcef<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> &amp;c. which were real Trage∣dies.
The <HI>Praetextae</HI> Pieces of <HI>Pacuvius</HI>
were <HI>Paulus, Tunicularia;</HI> and <HI>Accius</HI>'s
<HI>Brutus,</HI> and <HI>Decius.</HI> Their Names shew
they were serious Pieces that came very
near <HI>Tragedy;</HI> tho' they were in Effect
true Comedy: They treated of true
Facts, mixing the Gay and the Serious
together. In a Letter of <HI>Polli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s</HI> to <HI>Ci∣cer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
Book X. we learn, that the Que∣stor
<HI>Balbus,</HI> a very Insolent Man, had
caus'd a <HI>Praetextae</HI> Play to be represented
at <HI>Cadix,</HI> the Story of which was his
Journey to <HI>Lentulus,</HI> to perswade him to
Embrace <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Party; and when he saw
it play'd he wept, being touch'd at the
Remembrance of his great Actions.

says to the same Purpose: <HI>In Co∣moedia</HI>

weak in Comedy.</P>
<P>291. <HI>Limae labor &amp; mora.</HI>] The trou∣ble
of Correcting, <HI>limae labor,</HI> answers

is of the same Opinion in <HI>ION.</HI> This
being mistaken, abundance of People in
<HI>Horace</HI>'s time affected a slovenly Air and
Retirement, to be thought Poets.
<HI>Misera arte.</HI>] A miserable Art, in <HI>De∣mocritus</HI>'s
Sense.</P>
<P>299. <HI>Nanciscetur enim pretium nomenque
Poëtae.] Horace</HI> says it with Indignation,
in as much as ill Poets ran away with the
Reputation and Reward, only due to the
great ones.</P>

310 <HI>Rem tibi S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>craticae poterunt osten∣dere

Sense is necessary, he now tells them
where it is to be fou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d: In <HI>Socrates</HI>'s
Philosophy, the <HI>Academick</HI> Philosopher,
who alone enlightens the Mind, and tea∣ches
Ethicks better than all the rest of
the Philosophers. <HI>Piso,</HI> on the Vth Book
<HI>de finibus,</HI> makes a very fine Encomium
on the Ancient Academick Philosophy,
which comprehended <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and the
Peripateticks. <HI>Ad eos igitur,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I pray you
therefore give your self to them, for all fine
Learning, all History, all polite Language,
are to be taken out of their Writings: in
which there's so great a Variety of Arts,
that without their Help 'tis difficult to suc∣ceed
well in any thing Considerable. By
these are Oraters, Generals, and Magistrates
form'd; and out of this School come Mathe∣maticians,
Poets, Musicians, and Physicians.
Horace</HI> confines himself particularly to
<HI>Ethicks,</HI> which <HI>Socrates</HI> handled better
that any other Philosopher; and no∣thing
is more necessary to a Poet than
Moral Philosophy in forming his Cha∣racters.
<HI>Socraticae Chartae, Socrates</HI>'s Pa∣pers.
In the XXIst Ode of the IIId Book,
<HI>Socratici Sermones, Socrates</HI>'s Treatises.</P>
<P>311. <HI>Verbaque provisam rem non invitae

Conception of things, he will not want
Expression; as <HI>Cicero,</HI> in the IIId Book
<HI>de finibus,</HI> Things drag Words after them.</P>
<P>312. <HI>Qui dedicit patriae quid debeat</HI> &amp;
<HI>quid amicis.</HI>] Ethicks take in all the Du∣ties
of Mankind; of which he who is
Ignorant can form no just Characters in
Poetry.</P>
<P>314. <HI>Quod fit c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nscripti, qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d judicis

<P>316. <HI>Reddite personae scit convenientia

agreeable to the Character, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
a General must not talk
like a Centinel, a God like a Citizen, a
Senator like a Country Justice.</P>
<P>317. <HI>Respicere exemplar vitae morumque
jubet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dectum imitatorem.</HI>] By this Model
of Life and Manners <HI>Horace</HI> designs Na∣ture,
the only Original of all the diffe∣rent
Manners we see on the Stage of
the World; wherefore▪ a <HI>skilful Imitator,</HI>
a good <HI>Poet,</HI> when he introduces a Miser
or Cheat, and the like, does not mind
what such a one, and such a one do, of
whom he has an <HI>Idea;</HI> but what they
ought to do, what Nature would have
them to do: He Paints after Nature,
and not after a particular Person, who
is often but an imperfect and confus'd
Copy.</P>
<P><HI>Doctum imitatorem.] Imitator,</HI> for <HI>Poet;</HI>
Poetry being an Imitation only, as <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>
has shewn in his Art of Poetry.</P>
<P>318. <HI>Et veras hinc ducere voces.</HI>] Both
<HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Painting</HI> are pure Imitations.
A <HI>Painter</HI> who draws a Beautiful Wo∣man,
after the most Beautiful Life, can∣not
pretend to draw a true <HI>Picture</HI> of
Beauty, for his <HI>Piece</HI> is only a Copy of
another <HI>Piece,</HI> an Imitation of an Image,
and not of the Truth, as <HI>Plato</HI> says, his
Strokes are not <HI>verae lineae,</HI> but <HI>lineae si∣mulatae,
adumbratae:</HI> He has not consulted
the true Original.'Tis the same in <HI>Poe∣try;</HI>
if a <HI>Poet</HI> would represent a Miser,
and paints only the Avarice of such or
such a particular Person, he will take
the <HI>Shadow</HI> for the <HI>Substance,</HI> the <HI>Image</HI>
for the <HI>Truth;</HI> he must cast his Eyes
upon Nature, and Contemplate her Idea
of Avarice, which is the true Original.
<HI>Horace</HI> therefore says, <HI>veras hinc ducere
voces, To draw from thence true Expressi∣ons.</HI>
If the whole Beauty of this Pas∣sage
had been well understood, <HI>veras,
true,</HI> would not have been chang'd into
<HI>vivaes, living. Horace</HI> explains <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s
Rule in the XVth Capter of his Art of
Poetry, rather to form Characters after
Nature than after <HI>Particulars:</HI> In the
latter we may find what <HI>Choler</HI> has done,
in Nature what Choler ought and might
probably do, which embellishes the Cha∣racter,
and preserves the Likeness.</P>
<P>319. <HI>Interdum speciosa locis morataque
rectè fabula.</HI>] A Subject where the Sen∣timents
are fine, and the Manners well
distinguish'd, tho' the Conduct be other∣wise
bad, and it has neither Grace nor
Art, will always succeed better than a
Subject where the Verse is fine, if the
Sentiments and Manners are not good.
<HI>Horace</HI> is speaking of Comedy; in Tra∣gedy
it is not the same; the Manners
and Sentiments are not so necessary there
<PB N="285" REF="302"/>
as the Disposition of the Subject, Tra∣gedy
may subsist without the Manners,
but not without the Action.</P>
<P><HI>Speciosa locis.</HI>] And not <HI>Speciosa jocis;</HI>
for Comedy cannot be <HI>speciosa, fine,</HI> for
its <HI>Jests, jocis</HI> which render it <HI>jucundam,
pleasant;</HI> but 'tis <HI>speciosa locis,</HI> a Term
us'd by Philosophers and Rhetoricians,
instead of that we call the common
Places of Philosophy; the <HI>Places</HI> from
whence every thing is taken that may
be said on a Subject. <HI>Cicero</HI> calls them
<HI>Argumentorum sedes.</HI> How could <HI>Horace</HI>
write <HI>speciosa jocis,</HI> when he adds <HI>nullius
veneris, Without any Grace?</HI></P>
<P>320. <HI>Nullius veneris, sine pondere &amp;
arte.] Nullius Veneris, without the Graces,</HI>
which ought to be the Companion of
Comedy: <HI>Sine pondere, without the Verse;
sine arte, without Art,</HI> without Conduct,
without the Disposition of the Subject.
<HI>Horace</HI> uses the Word <HI>Art</HI> for the
Manners and Characters, in the lst E∣pistle
of the IId Book.</P>
<P>321. <HI>Moratur.</HI>] Stops, amuses, detains,
hinders his going out at the first Act.</P>
<P>322. <HI>Quam versus inopes rerum, nugae∣que
canorae.</HI>] He calls such poor Verse,
<HI>harmonious Trifles,</HI> for having neither
Manners, nor Sentiments; they amuse
the Ear, but speak not to the Heart.</P>
<P>323. <HI>Graiis ingenium.] Horace</HI> always
refers the Poets to the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ore rotundo.</HI>] A way of speaking in
<HI>Greek,</HI> to express a <HI>Fluency</HI> of Speech, a
<HI>round Mouth,</HI> as <HI>Demetrius Phalereus</HI> has
it; the <HI>Athenians</HI> were Masters of the
Freedom and Grace of Expression, which
this Phrase denotes.</P>
<P>324. <HI>Praeter laudem nullius avaris.</HI>] He
means the <HI>Greeks</HI> were greedy of Praise,
and to their love of Praise he attributes
their Superiority in the Arts over the
<HI>Romans,</HI> who lov'd Mony better.</P>
<P>326. <HI>Assem discunt in partes centum

Penny, the <HI>Roman <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> into a Hundred Parts,
not to lose a Day's Interest of a
Penny.</P>
<P>327. <HI>Filius Albini.] Albinus</HI> a Man of
Quality, and a noted Usurer; all the
Education he gave his Son, was to cast
Account well: <HI>Horace</HI> takes him to task
and examines him, as if he had been his
Arithmetick Master.</P>
<P>328. <HI>Poteras dixisse.</HI>] The Phrase of
a Master angry, that his Schollar is so
long answering his Question.</P>
<P><HI>Triens.</HI>] The Schollar answers, Take
away one Ounce out of five there remains
the third Part of a Pound, or as we say
four Ounces.</P>
<P>331. <HI>Speramus carmina fingi posse linen∣da
cedro.</HI>] The Booksellers, to preserve
their good Books, rub'd them with Ce∣dar
Juice, call'd <HI>Cedrium. Vetravius,</HI> in
the XIth Chapter of the IId Book, <HI>From
Cedar is taken an Essence call'd</HI> Cedrium,
<HI>which has a preserving Quality; and Books
that are rubb'd with it are not apt to grow
Mouldy or Worm-Eaten. Pliny</HI> tells us,
that the rubbing <HI>Numa</HI>'s Books with it
kept them undamnify'd 500 Years un∣der
Ground. <HI>Dioscorides</HI> says, there's a
Virtue in Cedar that will preserve dead
Bodies.</P>
<P>332. <HI>Et levi servanda cupresso.</HI>] They
did not only rub Books with Cedar Oil,
but they kept them in Cypress Cases,
which have the same Vertue as Cedar.</P>
<P>333. <HI>Aut prodesse volunt, aut delectare
Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tae.] Horace</HI> does not speak here of
the different Works of Poets, but of the
different Qualities of the same Work,
and the different Views of the Poets,
who would either instruct or please, or
do both. <HI>Horace</HI> declares very justly for
the latter; he's talking still of <HI>Co∣medy.</HI></P>
<P>335. <HI>Quidquid praecipies, esto brevis.</HI>]
Those who would instruct should be short,
that their Instruction may be easily com∣prehended

all that's pour'd there afterwards is spilt.
'Tis thus in Instructive Discourses, all
that's over and above runs off and makes
no Impression.</P>
<P>338. <HI>Ficta voluptatis caeusa sint proxima

please, never to err against Probability:
Recourse may sometimes be had to the
Gods, to whom all things are possible,
in Instructive Things; but in those that
are intended to Divert, nothing must
look Miraculous or Incredible.'Tis obesrva∣ble
how <HI>Horace</HI> expresses himself, speaking
of the Subjects of Comedy: He says,
<PB N="286" REF="303"/>
<HI>ficta,</HI> because the Subjects of the <HI>New Co∣medy</HI>
are always feign'd, whereas those
of <HI>Tragedy</HI> are taken from some known
Story. <HI>A Poet,</HI> says <HI>Plautus, renders that
probable which is only a Dream.</HI></P>
<P>339. <HI>Nec quodoumque volet poscat sibi
fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ala credi.</HI>] A Poet should not only
avoid what's Monstrous and Extrava∣gant,
but should offer nothing but what's
Credible. I'm satisfy'd this Verse ought
to be render'd Word for Word, <HI>That a
Comick Subject does not require we should
trust it with what it pleases.</HI> A Poet
must not hazard all sorts of Adventures
in Comedy, no more than in Tragedy,
He must neither in the Representation
nor the Recital venture any thing a∣gainst
the Rules of Probability. The
Example that follows will make this
Clear.</P>
<P>340. <HI>New prans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lamiae vivum puerum
extrabat alve.</HI>] A Poet must not expose
a <HI>Lamiae,</HI> a monstrous Woman who had
swallow'd a Child, which was taken a∣live
out of her Belly. <HI>Horace,</HI> no
doubt, alludes to some Poet, who had
brought this Fabulous Incident into his
Play.</P>
<P>341. <HI>Centuriae seniorum agitant expertia
frugis.</HI>] He says old Men despis'd such
Fictions, as containing nothing Instru∣ctive.
<HI>Centuriae seniorum, The Centuries of
Old Men,</HI> the Bands of old Men: For
<HI>Servius Tullius</HI> divided the <HI>Roman</HI> Peo∣ple
into six Classes, each Class compos'd
of Men of the same Age, or the same
Rank, or the same Estate, and this was
done for the Ease of the Peoples As∣semblies
in the <HI>Comitium.</HI> By <HI>Centuriae
seniorum</HI> may be also understood the <HI>Se∣nators,</HI>
and I rather think it so on ac∣count
of what follows.</P>
<P>342. <HI>Celfi praetereunt austera Poēmata
Rhamnes.</HI>] As the Senators despis'd use∣less
Fictions, so the <HI>Equites</HI> rejected such

Point of Sight, in which its Effect is to

<P>396. <HI>Fuit haec sapientia quendam publica

this last was termed <HI>Pythaule,</HI> a <HI>Player
for</HI> Pythian <HI>Songs;</HI> which were like Po∣ems
of Hymns to <HI>Apollo,</HI> sung in the
City of <HI>Pytho. Diomed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> says, <HI>When the
Chorus sung, the Players on the Flute ac∣company'd
them with the Flute call'd the
Chorus Flute, and answer'd with the Py∣thick
Flute, to the Single Songs.</HI> These
<HI>Pythaules</HI> and <HI>Choraules,</HI> who were of old
part of the Band of Musicians in the
Dramatick Representations, separated af∣terwards
and play'd by themselves. There
were some of these Masters very famous,
and of these <HI>Horace</HI> speaks.</P>
<P>415. <HI>Didicit prius, extimuitque Magi∣strum.</HI>]
There never was an Eminent
Player on the Flute, who had not serv'd
an Apprenticeship; wherefore since
Nature is not sufficient for Little Things,
how should she suffice for Great?</P>
<P>416. <HI>Nunc satis est dixisse, Ego mira
poemata pango.</HI>] This Language is but
too common now-a-days, and People too
apt to think they have no need of Read∣ing
the Ancients, since they in their own
Opinion think they write so well with∣out
it.</P>
<P>417. <HI>Occupet extremum scabies.</HI>] An
Expression us'd by Children, who at
certain Plays cry'd out, <HI>The Mange will
take the Hindmost.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mihi turpe relinqui est.</HI>] While I am
Studying the Ancients others will get
before me, and write Comedies and
Tragedies, If I write without Study,
let who will Learn the Rules, I will say
I know them.</P>
<P>419. <HI>Ʋt praeco, ad merces turbam qui
cogit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mendas.</HI>] Art and Nature are not
always enough to make a good Poet;
there must be also Faithful Friends to
tell an Author of his Faults, which are
hard to be found by such Great Men at
the <HI>Piso's. Horace</HI> compares Rich Poets
to publick Cryers; as the Latter invited
People to come and buy their Ware, the
Former invited Flatterers. He who
Praises, in the Purchaser.</P>
<P><HI>Cogit.] Convocat,</HI> Summons People and
Flatterers together.</P>
<P>421. <HI>Dives agris.</HI>] This Verse is re∣peated
in the Second Satyr of the First
Book.</P>
<P>422. <HI>Si vero est unctum qui recte ponerae
possit.</HI>] If the Rich Poet will treat and
lend a poor Brother Poet, 'twill be a
Wonder if he knows how to discern the
Friend from the Flatterer. <HI>Horace</HI> makes
here <HI>en passant,</HI> a nice Encomium on
the <HI>Piso's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ʋnctum ponere.</HI>] To treat high. <HI>Op∣sonium</HI>
is understood. <HI>Martial</HI> said to
<HI>Pomponius,</HI>
<Q><L>Quod tamen grande Sophes clamat tibi tur∣ba
togata,</L>
<L>Non tu Pomponi, caena diserta tua est.</L></Q>
'Tis not thee <HI>Pomponius,</HI>'tis thy Supper,
that is so Eloquent. <HI>Pliny</HI> calls such
Patasites <HI>Laudicaenas.</HI></P>
<P>423. <HI>Levi pro paupere.] Levis,</HI> Incon∣stant,
Light, Perfidious.</P>
<P>424. <HI>Beatus.</HI>] Happy; he who distin∣guishes
the Flatterer from the Friend.</P>
<P>426. <HI>Tu seu donaris, seu quid donare vo∣les
cui.</HI>] He advises the Elder <HI>Piso</HI> never
to read his Verses to a Man to whom
he has lately given or promis'd a Pre∣sent.
A Self-interested Friend will never
make a good Critick.</P>
<P>427. <HI>Plenum Latitiae.</HI>] Full of Joy for
what was given or presented him.</P>
<P>429. <HI>Pallascat super his.] Super his,</HI> o∣ver
and above.</P>
<P>431. <HI>Ʋt qui conducti plorant in funere.]
Horace</HI> says there is as much difference
between a Flatterer and a sincere Friend,
as between those who are paid for
<PB N="292" REF="309"/>
Weeping at a Funeral, and those true
Friends who weep unfeignedly. The
Flatterer praises much more than the
Friend, as the hir'd Mourners weep
more than those whose Grief is sincere.</P>
<P><HI>Deris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI>] The Banterer for the Flat∣terer.</P>

Man who praises what the thinks de∣serves
it, and speaks from his Consci∣ence.</P>
<P>434. <HI>Reges dicuntur multis urgere cu∣lullis.</HI>]
A Poet should do like Great Lords,
who drink a Man up to a Pitch, to see
if he betrays a Secret in his Cups, be∣fore
they trust him with One; Other∣wise
he will be apt to mistake Flatterers
for True Friends. <HI>Tiberius</HI> put his con∣fidents
to this Drunken Tryal.</P>
<P>437. <HI>Nunquam te fallant ammi sub vul∣pe
latentes.] Horace</HI> alludes to the Fable
of the <HI>Fex</HI> and the <HI>Raven,</HI> quoted by
<HI>Nannius</HI> in his Commentaries, Monsieur
<HI>de la Fer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aine</HI> has taken Care not to
forget it, and has surpast the Ancients,
in its Simplicity and Gaiety.</P>
<P>438. <HI>Quin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> si quis recitares.</HI>] The
Poet <HI>Quintilius Varius,</HI> a Relation and
Intimate Friend of <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI>'s.
The Latter addresses the VIIIth Ode
of the First Book to him, and mourns
his Death in the XXIVth Ode. He
had been Dead some Time when this
Epistle to the <HI>Piso</HI>'s was written, for
which Reason he says, <HI>Recitares, ju∣bebat,
sum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bat,</HI> Terms never us'd but of
a Person that is Dead.</P>
<P>440. <HI>Delere jubebat.</HI>] When an Au∣thor
has tryd and cannot Correct a
Place, he thinks he may let it go; but
<HI>Quintilius</HI> was in such a Case for blot∣ting
it out; a Piece of Cruelty the Mo∣derns
are seldom guilty of.</P>
<P>441. <HI>Et male tornatos incudi reddere
versus.] Horace</HI> is blam'd for making
use of Two Figures in the same Verse;
but it happens that he uses One only,
for tho' he mentions the Anvil, the Fi∣gure
is One, and that is the Working
of the Iron. <HI>Propertius</HI> in the last E∣legy
of the IId Book, says the same.</P>
<Q><L>Incipe j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> angusto Versus componere torno,</L>

<P>442 <HI>Si defendere delictum quam ver∣tere

fond of those Places which are most li∣able
to Exception. They are their <HI>Fa∣vourites,</HI>
and if you will take their
Words, the best of their Works.</P>
<P>443. <HI>Quin sine rivali.</HI>] And they ad∣mire
them as often without Rivals.</P>
<P>445. <HI>Vir benus &amp; prudens versus repre∣hendet
inertes.</HI>] These Five verses are
admirable, and include almost all that
the Rhetoricians have said of <HI>Criticism,</HI>
which consists of Three Things, <HI>Adding,
Retrenching</HI> and <HI>Altering.</HI></P>
<P>445. <HI>Versus reprehendet inertes.</HI>] There
are few Pieces to be met with now-a-days,
without all the Faults <HI>Horace</HI> col∣lects
in these five Verses; but the Faults
of the greatest Writers are only worth
taking Notice of, because their very
Faults may be Imitated as well as their
Beauties: Suppose Monsieur <HI>Corneille</HI> had
given his Fine Tragedy of <HI>Pompey</HI> to
<HI>Quintilius</HI> to examine; may we not
conclude, that in the IIId Scene of the
IId Act, when <HI>Cleopatra</HI> says,
<Q>Je connois ma port<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, &amp; ne prens point

He would have thought this Verse <HI>iners,</HI>
poor, weak and mean, as well as those that
follow in the IIId Scene of the IIId Act.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Caes.</HI> Comme a-t-elle reçû les offers da

<L><HI>Ant.</HI> Comme n'osant la croire, &amp;c la
croyant dans l' ame,</L>

<L>Elle s'en dit indigne, &amp; la croit meriter.</L></Q>
<P>As one that durst not believe what she did
believe in her Soul. By a Modest Refusal,
she said she was unworthy of a Passion,
which she thought she deserv'd. <HI>These
Verses are flat and affected; very far from
the Character of</HI> Mark Antony, <HI>and
Tragedy. The Language is mean, and
only fit for a Life-guard-Man.</HI></P>
<P>446. <HI>Culpabit duros.</HI>] Verses may be
hard either for the Words, or the
Things; the last is the greatest Fault.
Monsieur <HI>Corneille</HI> has been guilty of it
in these:
<Q><PB N="293" REF="310"/>
<L>Les Princes ont cela de leur haute nais∣sance,</L>
<L>Leur ame dans leur sang prend des im∣pressions,</L>

<P>'Tis hard and shocking to say, <HI>The Soul
takes Impressions of Virtue in the Blood,</HI>
which is as contrary to the <HI>Ethicks,</HI> as

<L>Sa vertu dans leur crime augmente ain∣si

would strike it out.</P>
<P><HI>Ambitiosa recidet ornamenta.</HI>] Such em∣phatical

Image has nothing in it Noble or Na∣tural.</P>
<P>448. <HI>Parum claris lucem addere coget.</HI>]
Obscutity is the greatest Vice in a Dis∣course.
<HI>Photius</HI> talks very obscurely,
when he says to <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> in the first
Scene of Monsieur <HI>Corneille</HI>'s <HI>Pompey:</HI>
<Q><L>Le choix des actions au mauvaises, ou
bonnes,</L>
<L>Ne fait qu'antantir la force des cou∣ronnes.</L></Q>
He means, That the Virtue which in∣clines
Kings to good Actions, rather
than bad, weakens their Power; but says
only, <HI>That the choice of Actions, either
good or bad, weakens the Power of Kings,</HI>
which is very dark.</P>
<P>449. Arguet ambiguè dictum.] Ambi∣guity,
<HI>says</HI> Quintilian, must above all things
be avoided.</P>
<P>Mutanda notabit.] He will at last mark
exactly whatever is to be alter'd. <HI>Quinti∣lian
declares, That</HI> adding and retrenching

This Verse will bear a double Sig∣nification.
As <HI>when the World,</HI> or as <HI>when

first Construction seems to me to be
wrong. <HI>Horace</HI> is not here talking of
the Evils which will happen to this ill
Poet, after the Publick has made a Fool
of him; but of those that shall happen
to him, after his flattering Friend has
made a Fool of him, by deceiving him
with false Praise; he would prove that it
is the Cause of all his Misfortunes, be∣cause

Word <HI>frigidus</HI> has been variously, ex∣pounded;
some pretend <HI>Horace</HI> means
<HI>Mad</HI> by it, and others <HI>Cold.</HI> The first
Exposition is the worst, the second bad
enough; there being little <HI>cold Blood</HI> in
so desperate an Action. By <HI>Frigidus,
Horace</HI> would describe all the Extrava∣gance

Others that fall into Melancholy may
be cur'd; 'tis to be hop'd they will

<HEAD>AN
ESSAY on POETRY.</HEAD>
<L>OF Things in which Mankind does most excel,</L>
<L>Nature's chief Master-piece is <HI>Writing
well;</HI></L>
<L>And of all Writings, <HI>Sacred Poesie</HI></L>
<L>Shines most Sublime to a discerning Eye:</L>
<L>No kind of Work requires so <HI>nice</HI> a touch,</L>
<L>And, <HI>well perform'd,</HI> nothing Delights so much.</L>
<L>But, oh, far be it from Records of Fame,</L>
<L>To grace the <HI>Vulgar</HI> with that Sacred Name;</L>
<L>'Tis not a flash of <HI>Fancy,</HI> which sometimes</L>
<L>Dazling our Minds, sets off the slightest Rhimes;</L>
<L>Bright as a Blaze, but in a Moment done;</L>
<L>True Wit is everlasting, like the Sun;</L>
<L><PB N="300" REF="316"/>
Which tho' sometimes behind a Cloud retir'd,</L>
<L>Breaks out again, and is by all admir'd.</L>
<L>Number, and Rhime, and that that harmonious Sound,</L>
<L>Which never does the Ear with <HI>Harshness</HI> wound,</L>
<L>Are <HI>necessary,</HI> yet but <HI>vulgar</HI> Arts;</L>
<L>For all in vain these superficial parts</L>
<L>Contribute to the Structure of the whole</L>
<L>Without a <HI>Genius</HI> too; for that's the <HI>Soul:</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>Spirit</HI> which inspires the Work throughout,</L>
<L>As that of <HI>Nature</HI> moves the World about;</L>
<L>A Heat which glows in every Word that's writ;</L>
<L>'Tis something of <HI>Divine,</HI> and more than <HI>Wit;</HI></L>
<L>It self unseen, yet all things by it shown,</L>
<L>Describing all Men, but describ'd by none.</L>
<L>Where dost thou dwell? What Caverns of the
Brain</L>
<L>Can such a vast, and mighty thing, contain?</L>
<L>When I, at idle hours, in vain thy Absence mourn,</L>
<L>Oh, where dost thou retire? and why dost thou re∣turn</L>
<L><PB N="301" REF="317"/>
Sometimes with powerful Charms to hurry me
away</L>
<L>From <HI>Pleasures</HI> of the Night, and <HI>Business</HI> of
the Day?</L>
<L>Ev'n now too far transported, I am fain</L>
<L>To check thy Course, and use the needful Rein.</L>
<L>As all is <HI>Dullness,</HI> when the Fancy's bad,</L>
<L>So, without <HI>Judgment,</HI> Fancy is but mad;</L>
<L>And Judgment has a boundless Influence,</L>
<L>Not only in the choice of <HI>Words,</HI> or <HI>Sense,</HI></L>
<L>But on the <HI>World,</HI> on <HI>Manners,</HI> and on <HI>Men;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Fancy</HI> is but the <HI>Feather</HI> of the Pen;</L>
<L><HI>Reason</HI> is that substantial useful part,</L>
<L>Which gains the <HI>Head,</HI> while t'other wins the <HI>Heart.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Here</HI> I should all the various sorts of Verse,</L>
<L>And the whole <HI>Art of Poetry</HI> rehearse,</L>
<L>But who that Task would after <HI>Horace</HI> do?</L>
<L>The best of <HI>Masters,</HI> and <HI>Examples</HI> too!</L>
<L>Ecchoes at best, all we can say is vain,</L>
<L>Dull the Design, and fruitless were the Pain.</L>
<L><PB N="302" REF="318"/>
'Tis true, the <HI>Ancients</HI> we may rob with Ease,</L>
<L>But who with that sad shift himself can please,</L>
<L>Without an <HI>Actor</HI>'s Pride? A <HI>Player</HI>'s Art</L>
<L>Is above his, who writes a <HI>borrowed</HI> Part.</L>
<L>Yet <HI>modern</HI> Laws are made for <HI>later</HI> Faults,</L>
<L>And new <HI>Absurdities</HI> inspire new <HI>Thoughts;</HI></L>
<L>What need has <HI>Satyr,</HI> then, to live on <HI>Theft,</HI></L>
<L>When so much <HI>fresh</HI> Occasion still is left?</L>
<L>Fertile our Soil, and full of rankest Weeds,</L>
<L>And Monsters worse than ever <HI>Nilus</HI> breeds;</L>
<L>But hold, the <HI>Fools</HI> shall have no Cause to fear;</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Sense</HI> that is the Subject here.</L>
<L>Defects of witty Men <HI>deserve</HI> a Cure,</L>
<L>And those who are so, will ev'n <HI>this</HI> endure.</L>
<L>First then of SONGS, which now so much abound,</L>
<L>Without his <HI>Song</HI> no Fop is to be found;</L>
<L>A most offensive Weapon, which he draws</L>
<L>On all he meets, against <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Laws:</L>
<L>Tho' nothing seems more easie, yet no part</L>
<L>Of <HI>Poetry</HI> requires a <HI>nicer</HI> Art;</L>
<L><PB N="303" REF="319"/>
For as in Rows of <HI>richest</HI> Pearl there lies</L>
<L>Many a Blemish that escapes our Eyes,</L>
<L>The least of which <HI>Defects</HI> is plainly shewn</L>
<L>In some <HI>small Ring,</HI> and brings the Value down;</L>
<L>So <HI>Songs</HI> should be to just <HI>Perfection</HI> wrought;</L>
<L>Yet where can we see one without a Fault,</L>
<L>Exact <HI>Propriety</HI> of Words and Thought?</L>
<L><HI>Expression</HI> easie, and the <HI>Fancy</HI> high,</L>
<L>Yet <HI>that</HI> not seem to <HI>creep,</HI> nor <HI>this</HI> to <HI>fly;</HI></L>
<L>No Words <HI>transpos'd,</HI> but in such <HI>Order all,</HI></L>
<L>As, tho' with Care, may seem by Chance to <HI>fall.</HI></L>
<L>Here, as in all things else, is most unfit</L>
<L>Bare <HI>Ribaldry,</HI> that poor <HI>Pretence</HI> to Wit;</L>
<L>Such <HI>nauseous Songs</HI> by a late Author made</L>
<L>Call an <HI>unwilling</HI> Censure on his <HI>Shade.</HI></L>
<L>Not that warm Thoughts of the transporting Joy,</L>
<L>Can shock the <HI>chastest,</HI> or the <HI>nicest</HI> cloy;</L>
<L>But <HI>obscene</HI> Words, too gross to move Desire,</L>
<L>Like Heaps of Fewel, do but <HI>choak</HI> the Fire.</L>
<L><PB N="304" REF="320"/>
On other Theams he well deserves our Praise,</L>
<L>But palls that Appetite he meant to raise.</L>
<L>Next, ELEGY, of <HI>sweet,</HI> but <HI>solemn</HI> Voice;</L>
<L>And of a <HI>Subject grave</HI> exacts the Choice;</L>
<L>The Praise of <HI>Beauty, Valour, Wit</HI> contains,</L>
<L>And there too oft despairing <HI>Love</HI> complains:</L>
<L>In vain alas! for who by <HI>Wit</HI> is moved?</L>
<L>That <HI>Phenix-she</HI> deserves to be beloved:</L>
<L>But <HI>noisie Nonsense,</HI> and such Fops as vex</L>
<L>Mankind, take most with that <HI>fantastick</HI> Sex.</L>
<L>This to the Praise of those who better knew;</L>
<L>The <HI>Many</HI> raise the Value of the <HI>Few.</HI></L>
<L>But here, as all our Sex too oft have try'd,</L>
<L><HI>Women</HI> have drawn my wandring Thoughts aside.</L>
<L>Their greatest Fault who in this kind have writ,</L>
<L>Is not Defect in Words, nor want of Wit;</L>
<L>But should this Muse harmonious Numbers yield,</L>
<L>And every Couplet be with Fancy fill'd;</L>
<L>If yet a just <HI>Coherence</HI> be not made</L>
<L>Between each Thought, and the whole <HI>Model</HI> laid</L>
<L><PB N="305" REF="321"/>
So <HI>right,</HI> that ev'ry <HI>Line</HI> may <HI>higher</HI> rise,</L>
<L>Like goodly Mountains, 'till they reach the <HI>Skies;</HI></L>
<L>Such Trifles may perhaps of late have past,</L>
<L>And may be lik'd a while, but never last;</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Epigram,</HI> 'tis <HI>Point,</HI> 'tis what you will,</L>
<L>But an <HI>Elegy,</HI> nor Writ with Skill,</L>
<L>No<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Waller's.</NOTE> <HI>Panegyrick,</HI> nor a<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Denham's.</NOTE> <HI>Cooper's-Hill.</HI></L>

<L>Are<NOTE N="Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pindarick Odes.</NOTE> ODES, the Muses most unruly Horse,</L>
<L>That bounds so fierce, the Rider has no rest,</L>
<L>But foams at Mouth, and moves like one <HI>possest:</HI></L>
<L>The Poet here must be indeed inspired,</L>
<L>With <HI>Fury</HI> too, as well as <HI>Fancy</HI> fired.</L>
<L><HI>Cowley</HI> might boast to have perform'd this Part,</L>
<L>Had he with <HI>Nature</HI> join'd the Rules of <HI>Art;</HI></L>
<L>But ill <HI>Expression</HI> gives sometimes <HI>Allay</HI></L>
<L>To noble Thoughts, whose Fame will ne'er decay.</L>
<L>Tho' all appear in Heat and Fury done,</L>
<L>The <HI>Language</HI> still must <HI>soft</HI> and <HI>easie</HI> run.</L>
<L><PB N="306" REF="322"/>
These Laws may sound a little too severe;</L>
<L>But <HI>Judgment</HI> yields, and <HI>Fancy</HI> governs here;</L>
<L>Which, tho' extravagant, this Muse allows,</L>
<L>And makes the Work much easier than it shews.</L>
<L>Of all the Ways that wisest Men could find</L>
<L>To <HI>mend</HI> the Age, and <HI>mortifie</HI> Mankind,</L>
<L>SATYR well-writ has most successful prov'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>cures,</HI> because the <HI>Remedy</HI> is <HI>lov'd.</HI></L>
<L>'Tis hard to write on such a Subject more,</L>
<L>Without repeating Things said oft before.</L>
<L>Some vulgar Errors only we'll remove,</L>
<L>That stain this <HI>Beauty</HI> which we so much love.</L>
<L>Of <HI>chosen</HI> Words some take not Care enough,</L>
<L>And think they should be as the Subject <HI>rough;</HI></L>
<L>This Poem must be more exactly made,</L>
<L>And <HI>sharpest</HI> Thoughts in <HI>smoothest</HI> Words con∣vey'd:</L>
<L>Some think, if sharp enough, they cannot fail,</L>
<L>As if their only Business was to <HI>rail;</HI></L>
<L><PB N="307" REF="323"/>
But, humane Frailty <HI>nicely</HI> to unfold,</L>
<L>Distinguishes a <HI>Satyr</HI> from a Scold.</L>
<L>Rage you must hide, and Prejudice lay down;</L>
<L><HI>A</HI> Satyr's <HI>Smile is sharper than his Frown;</HI></L>
<L>So, while you seem to <HI>slight</HI> some Rival Youth,</L>
<L>Malice it self may pass sometimes for Truth.</L>
<L>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Dryden.</NOTE> <HI>Laureat</HI> here may justly claim our Praise,</L>

<L>Here rest, my <HI>Muse,</HI> suspend thy Cares a while,</L>
<L>A more important Task attends thy Toil.</L>
<L>As some young <HI>Eagle</HI> that designs to fly</L>
<L>A long <HI>unwonted</HI> Journey through the Sky,</L>
<L><PB N="308" REF="324"/>
<HI>Weighs</HI> all the dang'rous Enterprize before,</L>
<L>Over what <HI>Lands</HI> and <HI>Seas</HI> she is to soar,</L>
<L><HI>Doubts</HI> her own Strength so far, and justly <HI>fears</HI></L>
<L>That lofty Road of <HI>Airy Travellers;</HI></L>
<L>But yet incited by some bold Design,</L>
<L>That does her <HI>Hopes</HI> beyond her <HI>Fears</HI> incline,</L>
<L>Prunes ev'ry Feather, views her self with Care,</L>
<L>At last <HI>resolv'd,</HI> she flounces in the Air;</L>
<L>Away she flies; so strong, so high, so fast,</L>
<L>She <HI>lessens</HI> to us, and is <HI>lost</HI> at last.</L>
<L>So (but too weak for such a weighty thing)</L>
<L>The Muse inspires a sharper Note to sing;</L>
<L>And why should Truth offend, when only told</L>
<L>To guide the <HI>Ignorant,</HI> and warn the <HI>Bold?</HI></L>
<L>On then, my Muse, adventrously engage</L>
<L>To give Instructions that concern the Stage.</L>
<L>The <HI>Ʋnities</HI> of Action, Time, and Place,</L>
<L>Which, if observ'd, give PLAYS so great a Grace,</L>
<L>Are, tho' but little <HI>practis'd,</HI> too well <HI>known</HI></L>
<L>To be taught here; where we pretend alone</L>
<L><PB N="309" REF="325"/>
From <HI>nicer</HI> Faults to purge the present Age,</L>
<L>Less obvious Errors of the <HI>English</HI> Stage.</L>
<L>First then, SOLILOQUIES had need be few,</L>
<L>Extremely <HI>short,</HI> and spoke in <HI>Passion</HI> too;</L>
<L><HI>Our</HI> Lovers, talking to themselves, for want</L>
<L>Of Friends, make all the <HI>Pit</HI> their <HI>Confidant;</HI></L>
<L>Nor is the matter mended yet, if thus</L>
<L>They trust a Friend, only to tell it us:</L>
<L>Th' Occasion should as <HI>naturally</HI> fall,</L>
<L>As when<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Philaster,</HI> a Play of <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bellario</HI> confesses all.</L>
<L>FIGURES of Speech, which Poets think so fine,</L>
<L>Art's <HI>needless</HI> Varnish to make Nature shine,</L>
<L>Are all but <HI>Paint</HI> upon a beauteous Face,</L>
<L>And in <HI>Descriptions</HI> only claim a Place.</L>
<L>But, to make <HI>Rage declaim,</HI> and <HI>Grief discourse,</HI></L>
<L>From Lovers in Despair <HI>fine</HI> things to <HI>force,</HI></L>
<L>Must needs succeed; for who can chuse but pity</L>
<L>A <HI>dying</HI> Hero miserably <HI>witty?</HI></L>
<L><PB N="310" REF="326"/>
But, oh, the Dialogues, where Jest and Mock</L>
<L>Is held up like a Rest at Shittle-cock!</L>
<L>Or else, like Bells, eternally they chime;</L>
<L>They <HI>sigh</HI> in <HI>Simile,</HI> and <HI>dye</HI> in <HI>Rhime.</HI></L>
<L>What <HI>Things</HI> are these, who would be <HI>Poets</HI> thought?</L>
<L>By <HI>Nature</HI> not inspir'd, nor <HI>Learning</HI> taught.</L>
<L><HI>Some</HI> Wit they have, and therefore may deserve</L>
<L>A better Course than this, by which they <HI>starve:</HI></L>
<L>But to write Plays! why, 'tis a bold Pretence</L>
<L>To <HI>Judgment, Breeding, Wit,</HI> and <HI>Eloquence;</HI></L>
<L>Nay more; for they must look <HI>within,</HI> to find</L>
<L>Those <HI>secret Turns</HI> of Nature in the Mind;</L>
<L>Without this Part, in vain would be the Whole,</L>
<L>And but a Body all, without a Soul:</L>
<L>All this together yet is but a Part</L>
<L>Of Dialogue, that great and powerful Art,</L>
<L>Now almost lost, which the old <HI>Grecians</HI> knew,</L>
<L>From whom the <HI>Romans fainter</HI> Copies drew,</L>
<L>Scarce comprehended since, but by a <HI>few.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="311" REF="327"/>
<HI>Plato,</HI> and <HI>Lucian,</HI> are the best Remains</L>
<L>Of all the Wonders which this Art contains;</L>
<L>Yet to our selves we Justice must allow,</L>
<L><HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> are the Wonders now:</L>
<L>Consider them, and read them o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>Go see them play'd, then read them as before;</L>
<L>For, tho' in many Things they grosly fail,</L>
<L>Over our Passions still they so prevail,</L>
<L>That our <HI>own</HI> Grief by theirs is rock'd asleep,</L>
<L>The <HI>Dull</HI> are <HI>forc'd</HI> to <HI>feel,</HI> the <HI>Wise</HI> to <HI>weep.</HI></L>
<L>Their Beauties imitate, avoid their Faults;</L>
<L>First, on a <HI>Plot</HI> employ thy careful Thoughts;</L>
<L>Turn it, with Time, a thousand several Ways;</L>
<L>This oft alone has given Success to Plays:</L>
<L>Reject that <HI>vulgar Error</HI> (which appears</L>
<L>So <HI>fair</HI>) of making <HI>perfect</HI> Characters;</L>
<L>There's no such thing in Nature, and you'll draw</L>
<L>A <HI>faultless Monster,</HI> which the World ne'er saw;</L>
<L>Some <HI>Faults</HI> must be, that his Misfortunes drew,</L>
<L>But such as may deserve Compassion too.</L>
<L><PB N="312" REF="328"/>
Besides the main Design compos'd with Art,</L>
<L>Each <HI>moving Scene</HI> must be a <HI>Plot</HI> apart;</L>
<L>Contrive each little <HI>Turn,</HI> mark every Place,</L>
<L>As <HI>Painters</HI> first <HI>chalk</HI> out the future Face;</L>
<L>Yet be not fondly your own Slave for this,</L>
<L>But change hereafter what appears amiss.</L>
<L>Think not so much where <HI>shining</HI>▪ Thoughts to place,</L>
<L>As what a Man would <HI>say</HI> in <HI>such</HI> a <HI>Case.</HI></L>
<L>Neither in <HI>Comedy</HI> will this suffice,</L>
<L>The <HI>Player</HI> too must be before your Eyes;</L>
<L>And tho' 'tis Drudgery to stoop so low,</L>
<L>To him you must your utmost Meaning show.</L>
<L>Expose no <HI>single</HI> Fop, but lay the Load</L>
<L>More <HI>equally,</HI> and spread the Folly broad;</L>
<L>Meer Coxcombs are too obvious; oft we see</L>
<L>A Fool <HI>derided</HI> by as bad as <HI>he;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hawks</HI> fly at <HI>nobler</HI> Game; in this low way,</L>
<L>A very <HI>Owl</HI> may prove a <HI>Bird</HI> of <HI>Prey:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Small</HI> Poets so will one poor Fop devour;</L>

<HI>Ingredients</HI> to <HI>compose</HI> this precious Juice,</L>

<L>But<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An admirable Character in a Play of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s.</NOTE> <HI>Falstaff</HI> stands unimitated yet.</L>
<L>Another Fault which often does befall,</L>
<L>Is when the Wit of some great Poet shall</L>
<L>So <HI>overflow,</HI> that is, be none at all,</L>
<L>That ev'n his Fools speak <HI>Sense,</HI> as if <HI>possest,</HI></L>
<L>And each by <HI>Inspiration</HI> breaks his Jest;</L>
<L>If once the <HI>Justness</HI> of each Part be lost,</L>
<L>Well we may laugh, but at the Poet's Cost.</L>
<L>That silly thing, Men call <HI>Sheer-Wit,</HI> avoid,</L>
<L>With which our Age so nauseously is cloy'd;</L>
<L><HI>Humour's</HI> the main; <HI>Wit</HI> should be only brought</L>
<L>To turn agreeably some <HI>proper</HI> Thought.</L>
<L>But, since the Poets we of late have known,</L>
<L>Shine in no <HI>Dress</HI> so much as in their <HI>own;</HI></L>
<L>The better by <HI>Example</HI> to convince,</L>
<L>Cast but a View on this <HI>wrong side</HI> of Sense.</L>

First, a Soliloquy is <HI>calmly</HI> made,</L>
<L>Where every Reason is <HI>exactly</HI> weigh'd;</L>
<L>Which once perform'd, most opportunely comes</L>
<L>Some <HI>Hero</HI> frighted at the Noise of Drums</L>
<L>For <HI>her</HI> sweet sake, whom at <HI>first sight</HI> he loves;</L>
<L>And all in <HI>Metaphor</HI> his Passion <HI>proves:</HI></L>
<L>But some sad Accident, tho' yet unknown,</L>
<L>Parting this Pair, to leave the Swain alone;</L>
<L>He streight grows <HI>jealous,</HI> tho' we know not why,</L>
<L>Then, to <HI>oblige</HI> his <HI>Rival,</HI> needs will <HI>dye;</HI></L>
<L>But first he makes a <HI>Speech,</HI> wherein he tells</L>
<L>The <HI>absent</HI> Nymph how much his Flame excels;</L>
<L>And yet bequeaths her <HI>generously</HI> now</L>
<L>To that lov'd Man (whom yet he scarce does know,)</L>
<L>Who streight appears (but who can Fate withstand?)</L>
<L>Too late alas to hold his hasty Hand,</L>
<L>That just has giv'n himself the cruel Stroke,</L>
<L>At which his very <HI>Rival</HI>'s Heart is broke;</L>
<L>Who more to his <HI>new</HI> Friend than Mistress kind,</L>
<L>Most sadly mourns at being left behind;</L>
<L><PB N="315" REF="331"/>
Of such a Death prefers the pleasing Charms</L>
<L>To <HI>Love,</HI> and living in his Lady's Arms.</L>
<L>How shameful, and what monstrous things are these?</L>
<L>And then they rail at those they cannot please;</L>
<L>Conclude us only partial for the <HI>Dead,</HI></L>
<L>And grudge the Sign of old <HI>Ben. Johnson</HI>'s Head;</L>
<L>When the <HI>intrinsick</HI> Value of the Stage</L>
<L>Can scarce be judg'd but by a <HI>following</HI> Age;</L>
<L>For, Dances, Flutes, <HI>Italian</HI> Songs, and Rhime,</L>

<L>His was no common Flame, nor could he move</L>

<L>Accusing <HI>Galatea</HI>'s Cruelty;</L>

His drooping head with sorrow bent he hung,</L>

<L>Ah! Nymph, by every Grace adorn'd, I know</L>

<HEAD>PARIS to HELENA.</HEAD>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Paris having sail'd to <HI>Sparta</HI> for the obtaining of
<HI>Helen,</HI> whom <HI>Venus</HI> had promised him as the
Reward of his adjudging the Prize of Beauty to
her, was nobly there entertain'd by <HI>Menelaus,
Helen's</HI> Husband; but he being call'd away to
<HI>Crete▪</HI> to take Possession of what was left him by
his Grand-father <HI>Atreus,</HI> commends his Guest
to the Care of his Wife. In his Absence <HI>Paris</HI>
Courts her, and writes to her the following
Epistle.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>ALL Health, fair Nymph, thy <HI>Paris</HI> sends to thee,</L>
<L>Tho' You, and only You, can give it me.</L>
<L>Shall I then speak? or is it needless grown</L>
<L>To tell a Passion that it self has shown?</L>
<L>Does not my Love it self too open lay,</L>
<L>And all I think in all I do betray?</L>
<L><PB N="425" REF="439"/>
If not, oh! may it still in secret lie,</L>
<L>'Till Time with our kind Wishes shall comply,</L>
<L>'Till all our Joys may to us come sincere,</L>
<L>Nor lose their Price by the Allay of Fear.</L>
<L>In vain I strive; who can that Fair conceal,</L>
<L>Which does it self by its own Light reveal?</L>
<L>But if you needs would hear my trembling Tongue</L>
<L>Speak what my Actions have declar'd so long,</L>
<L>I Love; you've there the Word that does impart</L>
<L>The truest Message from my bleeding Heart.</L>
<L>Forgive me, Madam, that I thus confess</L>
<L>To you, my fair Physician, my Disease,</L>
<L>And with such Looks this suppliant Paper grace</L>
<L>As best become the Beauties of that Face▪</L>
<L>May that smooth Brow no angry Wrinkle wear,</L>
<L>But be your Looks as kind as thy are fair.</L>
<L>Some Pleasure 'tis to think these Lines shall find</L>
<L>An Entertainment at your Hands so kind,</L>
<L><PB N="426" REF="440"/>
For this creates a Hope, that I too may,</L>
<L>Receiv'd by you, as happy be as they.</L>
<L>Ah! may that Hope be true! nor I complain</L>
<L>That <HI>Venus</HI> promis'd you to me in vain.</L>
<L>For know, least you through Ignorance offend</L>
<L>The Gods, 'tis Heav'n that me does hither send.</L>
<L>None of the meanest of the Powers Divine</L>
<L>That first inspir'd, still favours my Design.</L>
<L>Great is the Prize I seek, I must confess,</L>
<L>But neither is my Due or Merit less:</L>
<L><HI>Venus</HI> has promis'd she would you assign,</L>
<L>Fair as her self, to be for ever mine.</L>
<L>Guided by her, my <HI>Troy</HI> I left for thee,</L>
<L>Nor fear'd the Dangers of the faithless Sea.</L>
<L>She with a kind and an auspicious Gale</L>
<L>Drove the good Ship, and stretch'd out ev'ry Sail.</L>
<L>For she who sprung out of the teeming Deep,</L>
<L>Still o'er the Main does her wide Empire keep.</L>
<L><PB N="427" REF="441"/>
Still may she keep it, and as she with Ease</L>
<L>Allays the Wrath of the most angry Seas,</L>
<L>So may she give my stormy Mind some Rest,</L>
<L>And calm the raging Tempest of my Breast,</L>
<L>And bring home all my Sighs, and all my Vows</L>
<L>To their wish'd Harbour, and desir'd Repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither my Flames I brought, not found 'em here;</L>
<L>I my whole Course by their kind Light did steer:</L>
<L>For I by no Mistake or Storm was tost</L>
<L>Against my Will upon this happy Coast.</L>
<L>Nor as a Merchant did I plow the Main</L>
<L>To venture Life, like sordid Fools, for Gain.</L>
<L>No; may the Gods preserve my present Store,</L>
<L>And only give me you to make it more.</L>
<L>Nor to admire the Place came I so far;</L>
<L>I have Towns richer than your Cities are.</L>
<L><PB N="428" REF="442"/>
'Tis you I seek, to me from <HI>Venus</HI> due,</L>
<L>You were my Wish, before your Charms I knew.</L>
<L>Bright Images of you my Mind did draw,</L>
<L>Long e'er my Eyes the lovely Object saw.</L>
<L>Nor wonder that with the swift-winged Dart,</L>
<L>At such a Distance, you could wound my Heart:</L>
<L>So Fate ordain'd, and least you fight with Fate,</L>
<L>Hear and believe the Truth I shall relate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now in my Mother's Womb shut up I lay,</L>
<L>Her fatal Burthen longing for the Day,</L>
<L>When she in a mysterious Dream was told,</L>
<L>Her teeming Womb a burning Torch did hold;</L>
<L>Frighted she rises, and her Vision she</L>
<L>To <HI>Priam</HI> tells, and to his Prophets he;</L>
<L>They sing that I all <HI>Troy</HI> should set on Fire:</L>
<L>But sure Fate meant the Flames of my Desire.</L>
<L><PB N="429" REF="443"/>
For fear of this among the Swains expos'd,</L>
<L>My native Greatness every thing disclos'd.</L>
<L>Beauty, and Strength, and Courage join'd in one,</L>
<L>Through all Disguise spoke me a Monarch's Son.</L>
<L>A Place there is in <HI>Ida</HI>'s thickest Grove</L>
<L>With Oakes and Fir-trees shaded all above,</L>
<L>The Grass here grows untoucht by bleating Flocks,</L>
<L>Or Mountain Goat, or the laborious Ox.</L>
<L>From hence <HI>Troy</HI>'s Tow'rs Magnificence and Pride,</L>
<L>Leaning against an aged Oak, I spy'd.</L>

<L>With the strange Noise of trampling Feet resound.</L>
<L>In the same Instant <HI>Jove</HI>'s great Messenger,</L>
<L>On all his Wings born through the yielding Air,</L>
<L>Lighting before my wondring Eyes did stand,</L>
<L>His Golden Rod shone in his sacred Hand:</L>

<L><HI>Juno,</HI> and <HI>Pallas,</HI> and the <HI>Cyprian</HI> Dame.</L>

With an unusual Fear I stood amaz'd,</L>

<L>The Prize of heav'nly Beauty to bestow;</L>
<L>Contending Goddesses appeal to you,</L>
<L><HI>Decide their Strife;</HI> He spake, and up he flew.</L>
<L>Then bolder grown, I throw my Fears away,</L>
<L>And every one with curious Eyes survey:</L>
<L>Each of 'em merited the Victory,</L>
<L>And I their doubtful Judge was griev'd to see,</L>

move?</L>
<L>Who could it be but the fair Queen of Love?</L>

Whilst I stand doubting which I should prefer,</L>

<HEAD>The EPISTLE of
ACONTIUS to CYDIPPE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translated from OVID.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Acontius,</HI> in the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> at <HI>Delos,</HI> (fa∣mous
for the Resort of the most beautiful Vir∣gins
of all <HI>Greece</HI>) fell in Love with <HI>Cydippe,</HI>
a Lady of Quality much above his own; not da∣ring
therefore to Court her openly, he found this
Device to obtain her: He writes upon the fairest
Apple that could be procured, a couple of Verses
to this Effect,
<Q><L>“ I swear, by Chaste <HI>Diana,</HI> I will be</L>
<L>In Sacred Wedlock ever join'd to thee.”</L></Q>
<PB N="450" REF="464"/>
and throws it at the Feet of the young Lady:
She suspecting not the Deceit takes it up, and
reads it, and therein promises her self in Mar∣riage
to <HI>Acontius;</HI> there being a Law there in
Force, that whatever any Person should swear
in the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> of <HI>Delos,</HI> should stand
good and be inviolably observ'd. But her Fa∣ther
not knowing what had past, and having
not long after promised her to another, just as
the Solemnities of Marriage were to be per∣form'd,
she was taken with a sudden and vio∣lent
Feaver, which <HI>Acontius</HI> endeavours to
perswade her was sent from <HI>Diana,</HI> as a Punish∣men
of the Breach of the Vow made in her Pre∣sence.
And this, with the rest of the Argu∣ments,
which on such Occasion would occur to
a Lover, is the Subject of the following Epistle.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>REad boldly this; here you shall swear no more,</L>
<L>For that's enough which you have sworn before.</L>
<L>Read it; so may that violent Disease,</L>
<L>Which thy dear Body, but my Soul doth seise,</L>
<L>Forget its too long practis'd Cruelty,</L>
<L>And Health to you restore, and you to me.</L>
<L><PB N="451" REF="465"/>
Why do you blush? for blush you do I fear,</L>
<L>As when you first did in the Temple swear:</L>
<L>Truth to your plighted Faith is all I claim;</L>
<L>And Truth can never be the Cause of Shame.</L>
<L>Shame lives with Guilt, but you your Virtue prove</L>
<L>In favouring mine, for mine's a Husband's Love.</L>
<L>Ah! to your self those binding Words repeat</L>
<L>That once your wishing Eyes ev'n long'd to meet,</L>
<L>When th' Apple brought 'em dancing to your
Feet.</L>
<L>There you will find the solemn Vow you made,</L>
<L>Which if your Health, or mine, can ought perswade,</L>
<L>You to perform should rather mindful be,</L>
<L>Than great <HI>Diana</HI> to revenge on thee.</L>
<L>My Fears for you increase with my Desire,</L>
<L>And Hope blows that already raging Fire;</L>
<L>For hope you gave; nor can you this deny,</L>
<L>For the great Goddess of the Fane was by;</L>
<L><PB N="452" REF="466"/>
She was, and heard, and from her hallow'd Shrine</L>
<L>A sudden kind auspicious Light did shine.</L>
<L>Her Statue seem'd to nod its awful Head,</L>
<L>And give its glad Consent to what you said;</L>
<L>Now, if you please, accuse my prosp'rous Cheat,</L>
<L>Yet still confess 'twas Love that taught me it.</L>
<L>In that Deceit what did I else design,</L>
<L>But with your own Consent to make you mine?</L>
<L>What you my Crime, I call my Innocence,</L>
<L>Since Loving you has been my sole Offence.</L>
<L>Nor Nature gave me, nor has Practice taught</L>
<L>The Nets with which young Virgins Hearts are caught.</L>
<L>You my Accuser taught me to deceive,</L>
<L>And Love, with you, did his Assistance give;</L>
<L>For Love stood by, and smiling bad me write</L>
<L>The cunning Words he did himself indite:</L>
<L>Again, you see I write by his Command,</L>
<L>He guides my Pen, and rules my willing Hand,</L>
<L><PB N="453" REF="467"/>
Again such kind, such loving Words I send,</L>
<L>As makes me fear, that I again offend.</L>
<L>Yet if my Love's my Crime, I must confess,</L>
<L>Great is my Guilt, but never shall be less.</L>
<L>Oh that I thus might ever guilty prove,</L>
<L>In finding out new Paths to reach thy Love.</L>
<L>A thousand Ways to that steep Mountain lead,</L>
<L>Tho' hard to find, and difficult to tread.</L>
<L>All these will I find out, and break through all,</L>
<L>For which, my Flames compar'd, the Danger's small.</L>
<L>The Gods alone know what the End will be,</L>
<L>Yet if we Mortals any thing foresee,</L>
<L>One Way or other you must yield to me.</L>
<L>If all my Arts should fail, to Arms I'll fly,</L>
<L>And snatch by Force what you my Prayers deny:</L>
<L>I all those Heroes mighty Acts applaud,</L>
<L>Who first have led me this illustrious Road.</L>
<L><PB N="454" REF="468"/>
I too—but hold, Death the Reward will be;</L>
<L>Death be it then—</L>
<L>For to lose you is more than Death to me.</L>
<L>Were you less fair, I'd use the vulgar Way</L>
<L>Of tedious Courtship, and of dull Delay.</L>
<L>But thy bright Form kindles more eager Fires,</L>
<L>And something wondrous, as it self, inspires;</L>
<L>Those Eyes that all the Heav'nly Lights out-shine,</L>
<L>(Which, oh! may'st thou behold, and love in mine)</L>
<L>Those snowy Arms, which on my Neck should fall,</L>
<L>If you the Vows you made regard at all,</L>
<L>That modest Sweetness, and becoming Grace,</L>
<L>That paints with living Red your blushing Face,</L>
<L>Those Feet with which they only can compare,</L>
<L>That through the Silver Flood bright <HI>Thetis</HI> bear:</L>
<L>Do all conspire my Madness to excite,</L>
<L>With all the rest that is deny'd to Sight.</L>
<L><PB N="455" REF="469"/>
Which could I praise, alike I then were blest,</L>
<L>And all the Storms of my vex'd Soul at rest.</L>
<L>No wonder then if with such Beauty fir'd,</L>
<L>I of your Love the sacred Pledge desir'd.</L>
<L>Rage now and be as angry as you will,</L>
<L>Your very Frowns all other Smiles excel;</L>
<L>But give me leave that Anger to appease,</L>
<L>By my Submission that my Love did raise.</L>
<L>Your Pardon postrate at your Feet I'll crave,</L>
<L>The humble Posture of your guilty Slave.</L>
<L>With falling Tears your fiery Rage I'll cool,</L>
<L>And lay the rising Tempest of your Soul.</L>
<L>Why in my Absence are you thus severe?</L>
<L>Summon'd at your Tribunal to appear,</L>
<L>For all my Crimes, I'd gladly suffer there:</L>
<L>With Pride whatever you inflict receive,</L>
<L>And love the Wounds those Hands vouchsafe to
give.</L>
<L><PB N="456" REF="470"/>
Your Fetters too—But they alas are vain,</L>
<L>For Love has bound me, and I hug my Chain.</L>
<L>Your hardest Laws with Patience I'll obey,</L>
<L>'Till you your self at last relent and say,</L>
<L>When all my Sufferings you with Pity see,</L>
<L>He that can love so well, is worthy me.</L>
<L>But if all this should unsuccessful prove,</L>
<L><HI>Diana</HI> claims for me your promis'd Love.</L>
<L>O may my Fears be false! yet she delights</L>
<L>In just Revenge of her abused Rites.</L>
<L>I dread to hide, what yet to speak I dread,</L>
<L>Lest you should think that for my self I plead.</L>
<L>Yet out it must,—'Tis this, 'Tis surely this,</L>
<L>That is the Fuel to your hot Disease:</L>
<L>When waiting <HI>Hymen</HI> at your Porch attends,</L>
<L>Her fatal Messenger the Goddess sends▪</L>
<L>And when you would to his kind Call consent,</L>
<L>This Feaver does your Perjury prevent.</L>
<L><PB N="457" REF="471"/>
Forbear, forbear thus to provoke her Rage,</L>
<L>Which you so easily may yet asswage.</L>
<L>Forbear to make that lovely charming Face</L>
<L>The Prey to every envious Disease:</L>
<L>Preserve those Looks to be enjoy'd by me,</L>

Sometimes to your lov'd Doors disguis'd I come,</L>

<L>With Looks dejected, and a weeping Eye.</L>

<L>More than new Questions suffer her to tell:</L>
<L>How you had slept, what Diet you had us'd?</L>
<L>And oft the vain Physicians Art accus'd.</L>
<L>He every Hour (Oh, were I blest as he!)</L>
<L>Does all the Turns of your Distemper see;</L>
<L>Why sit not I by your Bed-side all Day,</L>

<L>Why press not I your melting Hand in mine,</L>

He that lov'd Hand does press, and oft does feign</L>

<HEAD>THE
FOURTH SATYR
OF
JUVENAL.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The Poet in this Satyr first brings in <HI>Crispinus,</HI>
whom he had a Lash at in his first Satyr, and
whom he promises here not to be forgetful of for
the future. He exposes his monstrous Prodiga∣lity
and Luxury in giving the Price of an E∣state
for a Barbel: and from thence takes Occa∣sion
to introduce the principal Subject, and true
Design of this Satyr, which is grounded upon a
ridiculous Story of a Turbut presented to <HI>Do∣mitian,</HI>
of so vast a Bigness, that all the Em∣peror's
Scullery had not a Dish large enough to
hold it: Ʋpon which the Senate in all haste is
summon'd, to consult in this Exigency, what is
fittest to be done. The Poet gives us a Parti∣cular
of the Senators Names, their distinct Cha∣racters,
and Speeches, and Advice; and after
much and wise Consultation, an Expedient being
found out and agreed upon, he dismisses the Se∣nate,
and concludes the Satyr.</P>

<L>To which retiring quietly at Night,</L>
<L>If (as that only can) to add Delight,</L>

<L>Watchful to do, to modest Merit, good;</L>
<L>Who have forsook the vile tumultuous Town,</L>

<L>What Joys in ev'ry Heart, and ev'ry Face!</L>
<L>The moderate Table's quickly cover'd o'er</L>
<L>With choicest Meats at least, tho' not with Store:</L>
<L><PB N="512" REF="526"/>
Of Bottles next succeeds a goodly Train,</L>
<L>Full of what cheers the Heart, and fires the Brain:</L>
<L>Each waited on by a bright Virgin Glass,</L>
<L>Clean, sound and shining like its drinker's Lass▪</L>
<L>Then down we sit, while ev'ry Genius tries</L>
<L>T'improve, 'till he deserves his Sacrifice:</L>
<L>No saucy Hour presumes to stint Delight,</L>
<L>We laugh, love, drink, and when that's done 'tis Night:</L>
<L>Well warm'd and pleas'd, as we think fit we part,</L>
<L>Each takes th' obedient Treasure of his Heart,</L>
<L>And leads her willing to his silent Bed,</L>

<L>Next comes the Will, that Bully of the Mind,</L>
<L>Follies wait on him in a Troop behind;</L>
<L>He meets Reception from the Antick Queen,</L>
<L>Who thinks her Majesty's most honour'd, when</L>

When waking as I cast my Eyes around,</L>
<L>Nothing but old loath'd Vanities I found;</L>
<L>No Grove, no Freedom, and, what's worse to me,</L>
<L>No Friend; for I have none compar'd with thee.</L>
<L>Soon then my Thoughts with their old Tyrant care</L>
<L>Were seiz'd; which to divert I fram'd this Pray'r:</L>
<L>Gods! Life's your Gift, then season't with such Fate,</L>
<L>That what ye meant a Blessing prove no Weight.</L>
<L>Let me to the remotest Part be whirl'd,</L>
<L>Of this your play-thing made in Haste, the World;</L>
<L>But grant me Quiet, Liberty and Peace,</L>
<L>By Day what's needful, and at Night soft Ease;</L>
<L>The Friend I trust in, and the She I love,</L>
<L>Then fix me; and if e'er I wish Remove,</L>
<L>Make me as great (that's wretched) as ye can,</L>
<L>Set me in Power, the wofull'st State of Man;</L>
<L>To be by Fools mis-led, to Knaves a Prey.</L>
