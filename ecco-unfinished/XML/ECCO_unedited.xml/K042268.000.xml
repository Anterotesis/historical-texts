<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope, my being one of that Sex, which naturally Claim the Protection of Yours, will in some Mea∣sure excuse my Presumption in laying this follow∣ing Poem at your Feet. Tho' we Women are in∣capable of serving our Country in the Discharge of weighty Affairs, we would not be thought so insipid a Part of it, as not to admire those that are; among which None is more Conspicious than your self.</P>
<P>In You the Worthy Citizen, and Judicious Statesman, meet without the Vice of either; and from such Patriots of old, <HI>Rome</HI> became the Mistress of the World. The Good of Mankind seems your only Study: Your Fa∣therly Affection to your Children, Your generous Kind∣ness to your Servants, Your Sincerity and Openness to your Friends, Your compassionate Pity to the Poor, Your forgiving Temper towards your Enemies, and the true <HI>English</HI> Hospitality with which You treat all that have the Honour to know you, proclaim the Greatness of your Soul. Your honest Principle, and good Ma∣nagement of your Affairs at Home, commanded the Ho∣nour of your Bills abroad, and the Trust which lately was repos'd in you, was faithfully discharg'd to the Ho∣nour of <HI>Britain</HI>.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>Then where shall the Weak appeal but to one so fam'd for Equity? And I hope that neither my Sex, nor my Cause, will render me unworthy of Your Protection. However worthless the following Pages may be in them∣selves, the Reason of their ill Success on the Stage is too notorious, and too long a Story to offer in this Epistle; tho' for the Satisfaction of my common Readers, I have thought fit to place it in a Preface. I confess, I cou'd never have thought it criminal to speak the Praises of those Heroes from a <HI>British</HI> Stage, to whom the greatest Part of <HI>Europe</HI> owes its Safety.</P>
<P>I am so truly sensible of the Weaknesses of my own Performance in this kind, that (however strong my in∣clinations were, or whatever I might have pretended to, as the Privilege of a Writer,) I shou'd not have presum'd to Address you, had not my Enemies done me the Ho∣nour to make me suffer in so glorious a Cause; I shall not however abuse the Liberty I now take, by pretend∣ing to give the World Your Character in a fulsome un∣skillful Panegyrick; but only wish, for the general Good of my Nation, that it abounded with such publick Spi∣rits as Your own; and that You long may Live, as now You are, the Honour of that City which You grace, as well as for the Interest and Glory of a free-born People; among which I beg leave to subscribe my self,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Am oblig'd to trouble my Reader with a Preface, that he may not be carried away with false Notions, to the Prejudice of this Play, which had the ill Fate to introduce a new Cu∣stom, <HI>viz.</HI> in being acted the first Day without an Epilogue: It seems the Epilogue design'd wou'd not pass; therefore the Mana∣gers of the Theatre did not think it safe to speak it, without I cou'd get it licens'd, which I cou'd not do that Night, with all the Interest I could make: So that at last the Play was forc'd to con∣clude without an Epilogue. Mr. <HI>Norris</HI>, who is an excellent Comedian in his way, was desired to speak six Lines <HI>Extempore</HI>, to entreat the Audience to excuse the Defect, and promised them an Epilogue the next Night; but they apprehending that that was the Epilogue design'd for the Play, were pleas'd to shew their Resentment. It is plain the want of an Epilogue caus'd the Hiss, because there had not been any thing like it during the whole action; but on the contrary a general Clap attended the Conclusi∣on of the Play. The next Day I had the Honour to have the E∣pilogue Licens'd by the <HI>Vice-Chamberlain</HI>, but by this time there was a Rumour spread about Town, that it was a notorious whig∣gish Epilogue; and the Person who design'd me the Favour of speaking it, had Letters sent her to forbear, for that there were Par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies forming against it, and they advis'd her not to stand the Shock; here was a second Blow greater than the first: The sinking of my Play cut me not half so deep as the Notion I had, that there cou'd be People of this Nation so ungrateful as not to allow a single Compliment to a Man that has done such Wonders for it. I am not prompted by any private Sinister End, having never been oblig'd to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>, otherways than as I shar'd in common with my Country; as I am an <HI>English</HI> Women, I think my self oblig'd to acknowledge my Obligation to his Grace for the many Glorious Conquests he has attain'd, and the many Hazards he has run, to establish us a Nation free from the In∣sults of a Foreign Power. I know not what they call Whigs,
<PB REF="5"/>
or how they distinguish between them and Tories: But if the De∣sire to see my Country secur'd from the <HI>Romish</HI> Yoke, and flourish by a Firm Lasting Honourable Peace, to the Glory of the best of Queens, who deservedly holds the Ballance of all <HI>Europe</HI>, be a Whig, then I am one, else not. I have Printed the Epilogue, that the World may judge whether 'tis such as has been represented▪ So much for that. Now I must acquaint my Reader, that I shall not pretend to vindicate the following Scenes, about which I took very little Pains, most of the Plot being from a <HI>Spanish</HI> Play, and assuring my self Success from Mr. <HI>Cyber</HI>'s Approbation, whose Opinion was, that the Business wou'd support the Play; tho' Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> seem'd to doubt it, and said, there was a great deal of Business, but not laughing Business; tho' indeed I cou'd not have dress'd this Plot with much more Humour, there being four Acts in the Dark, which tho' a <HI>Spanish</HI> Audience may readily conceive, the Night being their proper time of intreaguing; yet here, where Liberty makes Noon-day as easie, it perplexes the Thought of an Audience too much; therefore I shall take Care to avoid such Ab∣surdities for the future; and if I live I will endeavour to make my Friends amends in the next.</P>

<P>Why is it reasonable now, Colonel, that nothing shou'd be minded but your Love-Affairs 'till I am starv'd? in sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Sir, I am no Soldier; if your Method and mine won't agree, why e'en let us part fairly.</P>

<SP>

<P>Oh! a multitude of things; since you have been ho∣nourably in Love, you are no more like the Man you were, than a Squib is to a Cannon; sometimes you walk so softly that my Feet freeze in my Shoes; then by and by so fast that a Highlander can't keep Pace with you—and I scarce get a good Meal in a Week; I must fast, because Love has ta'en away your Stomach, and the Devil a Bottle can I tick, because he has forsworn the Tavern. <STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE> Besides, Sir, you load me with so many Secrets that I shall burst, or get my Bones broke one time or other; therefore, good Sir, discharge me.</P>

<P>Why, Sir, in the first place I wou'd have my Wages; there's a great deal due, Colonel.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bast.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are very particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tim.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I love punctual dealings, Sir: Now my Wages comes to at six Pound <HI>per Annum</HI>, thirty two Pounds the five Years four Months, the odd Week two Shillings six Pence, the two Hours one Half-peny—as for the Half hour, one Minute, and two Seconds, I'll generously throw them into the Bargain. I scorn to treat a Gentleman dirtily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bast.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are wonderfully obliging.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tim.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, out of these thirty two Pounds three Shil∣lings and nine Pence Half-peny, I have receiv'd at several times▪ the full Sum of—nothing at all; so that there still remains due to me the aforesaid Sum, Colonel.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Tim.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so, Sir? Why then you shall promise me three Meals a Day, and to intrust me with no Secret I may not tell the whole Town; for I Lye so much upon your account, Sir, that I am shrewdly afraid I shall never dye in my Bed.</P>

<P>Can you fall more honourably, Sirrah, than in defence of your Master's Secrets?</P>

<L>ONE Night with various Thoughts I musing lay,</L>
<L>Reflecting on the Business of the Day;</L>
<L>At length these words got Passage from my Breast,</L>
<L>And thus the Sadness of my Soul express'd.</L>
<L>Oh! when will <HI>Faction</HI> leave my Native Shore,</L>
<L>And <HI>Britons</HI> labour to be <HI>Slaves</HI> no more?</L>
<L>When shall true Merit meet with due Regard,</L>
<L>And <HI>Friends</HI> to <HI>France</HI>, be <HI>England's Foes</HI> declar'd?</L>
<L>That once perform'd, my Nation wou'd have Peace,</L>
<L>And all our Troubles and Distractions cease.</L>
<L>While thus I argu'd, Sleep did gently steal,</L>
<L>And in soft Slumbers all my Senses seal.</L>
<L>Straight I on <HI>Albion</HI>'s chalky Cliffs was laid,</L>
<L>From whence I <HI>Neptune</HI>'s spacious <HI>Realms</HI> survey'd;</L>
<L>When <HI>Lo!</HI> a <HI>Dolphin</HI> hasted to the Shore,</L>
<L>His Back a <HI>Triton</HI> of distinction bore,</L>
<L>Who chose for his Support a <HI>Mountain</HI> Wave,</L>
<L>And from a Coral <HI>Trump</HI>, he three loud Signals gave,</L>
<L>Alarm'd <HI>Britannia</HI> came the Cause to learn,</L>
<L>From whence the <HI>Courier</HI>, and of what concern:</L>
<L>To whom the <HI>Triton</HI> bow'd his Head, to show</L>
<L>How much all Nations to <HI>Britannia</HI> owe.</L>
<L>Then strait prepar'd his <HI>Embassie</HI> to tell,</L>
<L>While joyous Waves with Expectation swell.</L>
<L>From <HI>Neptune, Lord</HI> of all the wealthy <HI>Main</HI>,</L>
<L>I come, great <HI>Eugene</HI>'s Entry to proclaim:</L>
<L>His out stretch'd Sails the Winds with Pleasure fill,</L>
<L>And ev'ry saucy Storm's commanded to be still.</L>
<L>The <HI>Nereids</HI> all around his Vessel play,</L>
<L>While Shoals of <HI>Tritons</HI> guard his liquid Way.</L>
<L>Advance, <HI>Britannia</HI>, to receive this Chief;</L>

<L>A nobler Weight thy Seas cou'd never boast,</L>
<L>Since they the Great, the Glorious <HI>William</HI> lost:</L>
<L>Such dauntless Courage, such a Free-born Mind</L>
<L>Alone are fit to succour Human-kind.</L>
<L>Thus spoke the <HI>Triton</HI> from his tow'ring Wave,</L>

<L>Where <HI>Fam'd Augusta</HI>'s stately Piles are shown:</L>
<L>Here I beheld a lovely Silvan Scene,</L>
<L>Nature renew'd, and ev'ry Bough was green:</L>
<L>Here tuneful Birds their choicest Notes prepare,</L>
<L>And Arromatick Scents fill'd all the Ambient Air;</L>
<L>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a bright <HI>Form</HI> expanded on the Wing,</L>
<L>Did to my Sense Surprize and Wonder bring.</L>
<L>Her Golden Tresses by the Wind were born,</L>
<L>And num'rous Eyes did ev'ry Part adorn:</L>
<L>A Scarlet Robe she had all spangled o'er,</L>
<L>A broider'd <HI>Cestos</HI> round her Waste she wore,</L>
<L>And in her Hand a golden <HI>Trumpet</HI> bore:</L>
<L>She litt, methought, yet seem'd to grow so high,</L>
<L>Her Head aspir'd to reach the distant Sky.</L>
<L>Streight with her Breath she blew a gladsome Sound,</L>
<L>And Eccho joyfully the Notes rebound.</L>
<L><HI>Augusta</HI> heard, and rais'd her awful Head,</L>
<L>While <HI>Thamasis</HI> forsook his owzy Bed:</L>
<L>To welcome <HI>Fame</HI> they both appear'd in View,</L>
<L>And from her Looks propitious Omens drew.</L>

<L>True <HI>Heroes</HI> born, and Brothers of the War,</L>
<L>Their innate Worth immortal Life shall give,</L>

<L>Knows Loyalty and Courage fill his Breast,</L>
<L>And sees his Mind, with Truth, and Prudence drest.</L>
<L>Again his <HI>Fame</HI> shall glitter like a Star,</L>
