A LETTER FROM A GENTLEMAN IN THE English House of Commons, IN VINDICATION OF HIS CONDUCT, WITH REGARD TO THE AFFAIRS OF IRELAND, ADDRESSED TO A Member of the Irish Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following letter, which is handed about in manuscript in <HI>Dublin,</HI> as the production of one of the first genuises of that or any other country, is intended as a vindication of his conduct in the <HI>British</HI> parliament relative to the affairs of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The style alone will be sufficient to prove it genuine. It may be necessary, perhaps, to apologize to the author, for making public what had been only privately communicated. In common with his countrymen, the gentle∣man, who gives this letter to the public, censured a conduct which this letter has taught him to think praise-worthy: he wishes the world at large to receive the same impressions with himself, and to view the character of the most amiable man of the present times, as much above the narrow views of faction or party, as his literary talents exceed those of his enemies or de∣famers.
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
And he hopes he does a service to the world, by rescuing from obscurity a composition to which the public have so just a claim; and he trusts that the gentleman to whom this letter was addressed, will not think himself used hardly by the divulging those sentiments to which the public have a claim, in preference of any private indi∣vidual however respectable.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Don't know in what manner I am to thank you properly for the very friendly solicitude you have been so good as to express for my reputation. The con∣cern you have done me the honour to take in my affairs, will be an ample in∣demnity for all that I may suffer from the rapid judgments of those who choose to form their opinions of men, not from the life, but from their portraits in a
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
news-paper. I confess to you, that my frame of mind is so contracted, I have in me so little of the constitution of a great man, that I am more gratified with a very moderate share of approbation from those few who know me, than I should be with the most clamorous applause from the multitudes who love to admire at a due distance. I am not, however, stoic enough to be able to affirm with truth, or hypocrite enough affectedly to pretend, that I am wholly unmoved at the difficulty which you and other of my friends in Ireland have found in vindi∣cating my conduct towards my native country: it undoubtedly hurts me in some degree; but the wound is not very deep. If I had sought popularity in Ireland, when, in the cause of that country, I was ready to sacrifice, and did sacrifice, a much nearer, a much more immediate, and a much more advantageous popu∣larity here, I should find myself per∣fectly
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
unhappy, because I should be totally disappointed in my expectations; because I should discover, when it was too late, what common-sense might have told me very early, that I risqued the capital of my fame in the most disad∣vantageous lottery in the world. But I acted then, as I act now, and I hope I shall act always, from a strong impulse of right, and from motives in which popularity, either here, or there, has but a very little part: with the support of that consciousness, I can bear a good deal of the coquettry of publick opinion; which has her caprices and must have her ways. <HI>Miseri quibus intentata nitet.</HI> I, too, have had my holiday of popularity in <HI>Ireland;</HI> I have even heard of an intention to erect a statue. I believe my intimate ac∣quaintance know how little that idea was encouraged by me; and I was sin∣cerely glad that it never took effect. Such honours belong exclusively to the
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
tomb, the natural and only period of human inconstancy, with regard either to desert or to opinion; for they are the very same hands which erect, that very frequently (and sometimes with reason enough) pluck down the statue. Had such an unmerited and unlooked-for compliment been paid to me two years ago, the pavements of the piece might at this hour have the advantage of seeing actual service, while they were moving, according to the law of projectiles, to the windows of the A—y G—l, or of my old friend <HI>M—k M—n.</HI></P>
<P>To speak seriously, let me assure you, my dear Sir, that, though I am not per∣mitted to rejoice at all its effects, there is not one man at your side of the water more pleased to see the situation of <HI>Ire∣land</HI> so prosperous, as that she can afford to throw away her friends. She has ob∣tained solely by her own efforts the fruits
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
of a great victory, which I am very ready to allow that the best efforts of her best well-wishers here could not have done for her so effectually in a great number of years, and perhaps could not have done at all. I could wish, however, merely for the sake of her own dignity, that, in turning her poor relations and antiquated friends out of doors, (though one of the most common effects of new prosperity,) she had thought proper to dismiss us with fewer tokens of unkind∣ness. It is true, that there is no sort of danger in affronting men who are not of importance enough to have any trust of ministerial, of royal, or of national ho∣nour to surrender. The unforced and unbought services of humble men, who have no medium of influence in great assemblies, but through the precarious force of reason, must be looked upon with contempt, by those who, by their wisdom and spirit, have improved the
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
critical moment of their fortune, and have debated with authority against pu∣sillanimous dissent and ungracious com∣pliance, at the head of forty thousand men.</P>
<P>Such feeble auxiliaries (as I talk of) to such a force employed against such re∣sistance, I must own, in the present mo∣ment, very little worthy of your atten∣tion; yet, if one were to look forward, it scarcely seems altogether politick to be∣stow so much liberality of invective on the Whiggs of this kingdom, as I find it has been the fashion to do both in and out of parliament. That you should pay compliments in some tone or other, whe∣ther ironical or serious, to the minister from whose imbecillity you have extorted what you could never obtain from his bounty, is not unnatural in the first ef∣fusions of parliamentary gratitude to that minister, for the early and voluntary be∣nefits
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
he has conferred upon Ireland. It might appear that you were wanting to the triumph of his surrender, if you did not lead some of his enemies captive be∣fore him; neither could you feast him with decorum, if his particular taste were not consulted. A minister who has never defended his measures in any other way than by railing at his adversaries, cannot have his palate made all at once to the relish of positive commendation. I can∣not deny but that on this occasion there was displayed a great deal of the good breeding, which consists in the accom∣modation of the entertainment to the re∣lish of the guests.</P>
<P>But that ceremony being past, it would not be unworthy of the wisdom of Ire∣land, to consider what consequences the extinguishing every spark of freedom in this country may have upon your own li∣berties. You are at this instant flushed with
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
victory, and full of the confidence natu∣ral to recent and untried power. We are in a temper equally natural, though very different:—We feel as men do, who, hav∣ing placed an unbounded reliance on their force, have found it totally to fail on trial:—We feel faint and heartless, and without the smallest degree of self-opi∣nion:—in plain words, we are <HI>cowed.</HI> When men give up their violence and in∣justice without a struggle, their condi∣tion is next to desperate. Where no art, no management is necessary to abate their pride, and overcome their prejudices; and their uneasiness only excites an ob∣scure and feeble rattling in their throat; their final dissolution seems not far off. In this miserable state we are still further depressed by the over-bearing influence of the crown: it acts with the officious cruelty of a mercenary nurse, who, un∣der pretence of tenderness, stifles us with our clothes, and plucks the pillow from our heads. <HI>Injectu multae vestis opprimi</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
<HI>senem jubet.</HI> Under this influence, we have so little will of our own, that, even in any apparent activity we may be got to assume, I may say, without any vio∣lence to sense, and with very little to language, we are merely passive. We have yielded to your demands this session; in the last session we refused to prevent them. In both cases, the passive and the active, our principle was the same. Had the crown pleased to retain the spirit with regard to Ireland, which seems to be now all directed to America, we should have neglected our own immediate de∣fence, and sent over the last man of our militia, to fight with the last man of your volunteers.</P>
<P>To this influence, the principle of ac∣tion, the principle of policy, and the principle of union of the present mino∣rity, are opposed. These principles of the opposition are the only thing which pre∣serves
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
a single symptom of life in the na∣tion. That opposition is composed of the far greater part of the independent pro∣perty and independent rank in the king∣dom, of whatever is most untainted in character, of whatever ability remains unextinguished in the people; and all which tends to draw the attention of fo∣reign countries upon this. It is now in its final and conclusive struggle: it has to struggle against a force to which, I am afraid, it is not equal. The whole king∣dom of Scotland ranges with the venal, the unprincipled, and the wrong prin∣cipled of this; and if the kingdom of Ireland thinks proper to pass into the same camp, we shall certainly be obliged to quit the field. In that case, if I know any-thing of this country, another con∣stitutional opposition can never be formed on it: and, if this be impossible, it will be at least as much so (if there can be degrees in impossibility) to have a consti∣tutional
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
administration at any future time. The possibility of the former is the only security for the existence of the latter. Whether the present administration be in the least like one, I must venture to doubt, even in the honey-moon of the Irish fondness to Lord North, which has succeeded to all their slapping and scratching.</P>
<P>If liberty cannot maintain its ground in this kingdom, I am sure that it can∣not have any long continuance in yours. Our liberty might now and then jar and strike a discord with that of Ireland; the thing is possible; but still the instruments might play in concert: but, if ours be unstrung, yours will be hung up on a peg, and both will be mute for ever. Your new military force may give you confidence; and it serves for a turn: but you and I know that it has no root;
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
it is not perennial, and would prove but a poor shelter for your liberty, when this nation, having no interest in its own, could only look upon yours with the eyes of envy and disgust. I cannot, therefore, help thinking, and telling you what, with great submission I think, that, if the Parliament of Ireland be so zeal∣ous of the spirit of our common consti∣tution as she seems to be, it was not so discreet to mix with the panegyrick on the minister so large a portion of acri∣mony to the independent part of this na∣tion. You never received any sort of in∣jury from them, and you are grown to that degree of importance, that the dis∣courses in your parliament will have a much greater effect on our immediate fortune, than our conversation can have upon yours:—in the end they will seri∣ously affect both.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17"/>
I have looked back upon our conduct, and our public conversations, in order to discover what it is that can have given you offence. I have done so, because I am ready to admit, that to offend you without cause, would be as contrary to true policy, as, I am sure, it must be to the inclinations of almost every one of us.—About two years ago Lord Nugent moved six propositions in favour of Ire∣land, in the House of Commons. At the time of the motions, and during the de∣bate, Lord North was either wholly out of the house, or engaged in other mat∣ters of business or pleasantry. In the remotest recesses of the West-Saxon corner, he took no part whatsoever in the affair; But it was supposed his neutra∣lity was more inclined towards the side of favour. The mover being a person in office, was, however, the only indi∣cation that was given of such a leaning.
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
We, who supported the propositions, finding them better relished than at first we looked for, pursued our advantage, and began to open a way for more essen∣tial benefits to Ireland: on the other hand, those who had hitherto opposed them in vain, redoubled their efforts, and became exceedingly clamorous. Then it was, that Lord North found it necessary to come out of his fastness, and to in∣terpose between the contending parties. In this character of mediator, he de∣clared, that, if any thing beyond the first six resolutions should be attempted, he would oppose the whole; but that, if we rested there, the original motions should have his support. On this a sort of conversation took place between him and the managers of the Irish business, in which the six resolutions were to be considered as a sort of <HI>uti possidetis,</HI> and to be held sacred.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19"/>
By this time other parties began to ap∣pear: a good many of the trading towns and manufactures of various kinds took the alarm; petitions crowded in upon one another; and the bar was occupied by a formidable body of council. Lord North was staggered by this new bat∣tery. He is not of a constitution to en∣counter such an opposition as had then risen, when there were no other objects in view than those that were then before the house. In order not to lose him, we were obliged to abandon, bit by bit, the most considerable parts of the original agreement.</P>
<P>In several parts, however, he continued fair and firm. For my own part, I acted, as I trust I commonly do, with decision; I saw very well, that the things we had got were of no great consideration; but they were, even in their defects, some∣what leading. I was in hopes that we
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
might obtain gradually, and by parts, what we might attempt at once, and in the whole, without success; that one con∣cession would lead another; and that the people of England discovering, by a progressive experience, that none of the concessions actually made were followed by the consequences they had dreaded, their fears from what they were yet to yield would considerably diminish. But that to which I attached myself the most particulárly was, to fix the principle of a free trade in all the ports of these islands, as founded in justice, and beneficial to the whole, but principally to this the seat of the supreme power; and this I labour∣ed to the utmost of my might, upon general principles, illustrated by all the commercial detail with which my little enquiries in life were able to furnish me. I ought to forget such trifling things as those which concern myself; and, pos∣sibly,
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
I might have forgotten them, if the Lord Advocate of Scotland had not, in a very flattering manner, revived them in my memory, in a full house, in this session. He told me, that my argu∣ments, such as they were, made him change the opinion with which he had come into the house strongly impressed. I am sure, that, at the time, at least twenty more told me the same thing. I certainly ought not to take their style of compliment as a testimony to fact; neither do I: but all this shewed suf∣ficiently, not what they thought of my ability, but what they saw of my zeal. I could say more in proof of the effects of that zeal, and of the unceasing in∣dustry with which I then acted, both in my endeavours which were apparent, and those that were not so visible. Let it be remembered I shewed those dispositions while the parliament of England was in
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
a capacity to deliberate, and in a situation to refuse; when there was something to be risqued here, by being suspected of a partiality to Ireland; when there was an honourable danger attending the pro∣fession of friendship to you, which heightened its relish, and made it worthy of a reception in manly minds: But, as for the awkward and nauseous parade of debate without opposition, the flimsy device of tricking out necessity, and dis∣guising it in the habit of choice, the shal∣low stratagem of defending by argument what all the world must perceive is yielded to force; these are a sort of acts of friendship, which I am sorry that any of my countrymen should require of their real friends: they are things not to my taste; and, if they are looked upon as tests of friendship, I desire for one, that I may be considered as an enemy.—What party-purpose did my conduct
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>
answer at that time? I acted with Lord North; I went to all the ministerial meetings: and he and his associates in office will do me the justice to say, that, aiming at the concord of the empire, I made it my business to give her con∣cessions all the value of which they were capable; whilst some of those who were covered with his favours, derogated from them, treated them with contempt, and openly threatened to oppose them. If I had acted with my dearest and most valued friends; if I had acted with the Marquis of Rockingham, or the Duke of Richmond, in that situation; I could not have attended more to their honour, or endeavoured more earnestly to give efficacy to the measures I had taken in common with them. The return which I, and all who acted as I did, have met with from him, does not make me re∣pent the conduct which I there held.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="24"/>
As to the rest of the gentlemen with whom I have the honour to act, they did not then, or at any other time, make a party-affair of Irish politicks. That matter was always taken up without concert, but in general from the opera∣tion of our known liberal principles in government, in commerce, in religion, in every thing: it was taken up favourably for Ireland, where some local interests bore hard upon the members. They acted on the sense of their constituents; upon ideas, which, though I do not al∣ways follow, I can never blame: how∣ever, two or three persons, high in oppo∣sition, and high in publick esteem, ran great risks in their boroughs on the occa∣sion. But all this was without any par∣ticular plan. I need not say, that Ireland was, in that affair, much obliged to the liberal mind and enlarged understanding of Charles Fox. Mr. Townshend, Lord
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
Middleton, and others, likewise, distin∣guished themselves. On reviewing the whole of that affair, which gave rise to all the subsequent manoeuvres, I am con∣vinced, that the whole of what has this day been done, might have been at that time effected; but then the mi∣nister must have taken it up as a great plan of national policy, and paid with his person in every lodgment of his ap∣proach. He must have used that in∣fluence to quiet prejudice, which he has so often used to corrupt principle; and I know that, if he had, he must have succeeded. Many of the most active in opposition would have given him an un∣equivocal support. The corporation of London, and the great body of the London West-India Merchants and Planters, which forms the greatest mass of that vast interest, were disposed to fall in with such a plan; they constantly
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
gave no sort of discountenance to what was done, or what was proposed. But these are not the kind of objects for which our ministers bring out the heavy artillery of the state; therefore, as those things stood at that time, a great deal more was not practicable.—Last year, an∣other proposition was brought for the re∣lief of Ireland; it was started without any communication with a single person of activity in the country party, and, as it should seem, without any kind of con∣cert with government: it appeared to me extremely raw and indigested. The behaviour of Lord North on the opening of that business was the exact transcript of his conduct on the Irish question of the former session: it was a mode of pro∣ceeding, which his nature has wrought into the texture of his politicks, and which is inseparable from them. He chose to absent himself on the proposition, and
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
during the agitation of that business, al∣though the business of the house is that alone for which he has any kind of relish, or, as I am told, can be persuaded to listen to with any degree of attention: but he was willing to let it take its course. If it should pass without any considerable difficulty, he would bring his acquiescence to tell for merit in Ireland; and he would have the credit, out of his indolence, of giving quiet to that country. If diffi∣culties should arise on the part of Eng∣land, he knew that the house was so well trained, that he might at his pleasure call us from the hottest scent. As he acted in his usual manner, and up∣on his usual principles, opposition acted upon theirs, and rather generally sup∣ported the measure. As to myself, I expressed a disapprobation at the prac∣tice of bringing imperfected and undi∣gested projects into the house, before
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
means were used to quiet the clamours which a misconception of what we were doing might occasion at home, and be∣fore measures were settled with men of weight and authority in Ireland, in order to render our acts useful and acceptable to that country. I said, that the only thing which could make the influence of the crown (enormous without as well as within the house) in any degree to∣lerable, was, that it might be employed to give something of order and system to the proceedings of a popular assem∣bly; that government being so situated as to have a large range of prospect, and, as it were, a bird-view of every thing, they might see distant dangers and dis∣tant advantages, which were not so visi∣ble to those who stood on the common level: they might besides observe, from this advantage, things in their relative and combined state, which people lo∣cally
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>
instructed and partially informed could behold only in an insulated and un∣connected manner: but that, for many years past, we suffered under all the evils, without any one of the advan∣tages, of a government influence; that the business of ministers, or of those who acted as such, had been still further to contract the narrowness of man's ideas, to confirm inveterate prejudices, to in∣flame vulgar passions, and to abate all sorts of popular rights and privileges; so far from methodizing the business of the house, they had let all things run in∣to an inextricable confusion, and had left affairs of the most delicate policy wholly to chance.</P>
<P>After I had expressed myself with the warmth I felt on seeing all order and government burst under the ruins of li∣berty, and after I had made my protest
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
against the infufficiency of the proposi∣tions, I supported the principle of en∣largement which they aimed at, though short and somewhat wide of the mark, giving as my sole reason, that the more frequently those matters came into discus∣sion, the more it would tend to dispel fears and to eradicate prejudices.</P>
<P>This was the only part I took; the de∣tail was in the hands of Lord Newhaven and Lord Beauchamp, with some assist∣ance from Earl Nugent, and a few in∣dependent gentlemen of Irish property. The dead weight of the minister being removed, the house recovered its tone and elasticity. We had a temporary ap∣pearance of deliberate character: the bu∣siness was debated freely on both sides, and with sufficient temper; and the sense of the members being influenced by no∣thing but what will naturally influence men
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
unbought, their reason and their preju∣dice: these two principles had a fair con∣flict, and prejudice was obliged to give way to reason;—a majority appeared, on a division, in favour of the proposi∣tions.</P>
<P>As these proceedings got out of doors, Glasgow and Manchester, and I think Liverpool, began to move, but in a man∣ner much more slow and languid than formerly; and nothing, in my opinion, would have been less difficult, than en∣tirely to have overborne their opposition. The London East-India trade was, as on the former occasion, so on this, perfectly liberal and quiet; and there is abroad so much respect for the united wisdom of the house, when supposed to act upon a fair view of political situation, that I scarcely ever remember any considerable uneasiness out of doors, when the most
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>
active members, and those of most pro∣perty and consideration, in the mino∣rity, have joined themselves to the admi∣nistration. Many factious people in the towns mentioned began, indeed, to re∣vile Lord North, and to reproach his neutrality as treacherous and ungrateful to those who had so heartily and so warmly entered into all his views with regard to America.</P>
<P>That noble Lord, whose decided cha∣racter it is to give way to the latest and nearest pleasure, without any sort of regard to distant consequences of any kind, thought fit to appear, on this sig∣nification of the pleasure of those his worthy friends and partizans, and, put∣ting himself at the head of the <HI>posse Scac∣carii,</HI> wholly regardless of the dignity and consistency of our miserable house, drove the propositions entirely out of
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
doors, by a majority newly summoned to duty.</P>
<P>In order to atone to Ireland for this gratification to Manchester, he graciously permitted, or rather forwarded, two bills; that for encouraging the growth of to∣bacco, and that for giving a bounty on exportation of hemp from Ireland. They were brought in by two very worthy members, and on good principles: but I was sorry to see them; and, after ex∣pressing my doubts of their propriety, left the house. Little else was said upon them. My objections were two: the first, that the cultivation of those weeds (if one of them could be at all cultivated to profit) was adverse to the introduction of a good course of agriculture; the other, that the encouragement given to them, tended to establish that mischie∣vous policy of considering Ireland as a
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
country of staple, and a producer of raw materials.</P>
<P>When the rejection of the first propo∣sition, and the acceptance of the last, had jointly, as it was natural, raised a very strong discontent in Ireland, Lord Rockingham, who had frequently said that there never seemed a more oppor∣tune time for the relief of Ireland, than that moment when Lord North had re∣jected all rational propositions for its re∣lief, without consulting, I believe, any one living, did what he is not very often wil∣ling to do; but he thought this an occa∣sion of magnitude enough to justify an extraordinary step :—he went into the closet, and made a strong representation to the King; which was not ill received, and I believe produced good effects. He then made the motion in the House of Lords which you may recollect; but he
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
was content to withdraw it, on the so∣lemn promise of ministry, that they would, in the recess of parliament, pre∣pare a plan for the benefit of Ireland, and have it in readiness to produce the next meeting. You may recollect that Lord Gower became in a particular man∣ner bound for the fulfilling this engage∣ment. Even this did not satisfy; and most of the minority were very unwil∣ling that parliament should be prorogued until something effectual on the subject should be done: particularly as we saw that the distresses, discontents, and arma∣ments of Ireland, were encreasing every day; and we were not so much lost to common sense, as not to know the wis∣dom and efficacy of early concession in circumstances such as ours.</P>
<P>The session was now at an end. The ministers, instead of attending to a duty
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>
that was so urgent on them, employed themselves, as usual, in endeavours to destroy the reputation of those who were bold enough to remind them of it. They caused it to be industriously circulated through the nation, that the distresses of Ireland were of a nature hard to be traced to the true source; that they had been monstrously magnified; and that, in par∣ticular, the official reports from Ireland had given the lie (that was their pleasure) to Lord Rockingham's representations; and, attributing the origin of the Irish proceedings wholly to us, they asserted that every thing done in parliament upon the subject was with a view of stirring up rebellion; <Q>“that neither the Irish le∣gislature, nor their constituents, had signified any dissatisfaction at the relief obtained (in the session preceding the last); that, to convince both of the im∣propriety of their peaceable conduct,
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
opposition, by making demands in the name of Ireland, pointed out what she might extort from Great Britain; that the facility with which relief was (for∣merly) granted, instead of satisfying opposition, was calculated to create new demands—these demands, as they in∣terfered with the commerce of Great Britain, were certain of being opposed; a circumstance which could not fail to create that desirable confusion which suits the views of the party—that they (the Irish) had long felt their own misery, without knowing well from whence it came—our worthy patriots, by point∣ing out Great Britain as the cause of Irish distress, may have some chance of rousing Irish resentment.”</Q> This I quote from a pamphlet as perfectly con∣temptible in point of writing, as it is false in its facts, and wicked in its design; but, as it is written under the authority
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
of ministers, by one of their principal literary pensioners, and was circulated with great diligence, and, as I am cre∣dibly informed, at a considerable expence to the public, I use the words of that book, to let you see in what manner the friends and patrons of Ireland, the heroes of your parliament, represented all efforts for your relief here; what means they took to dispose the minds of the people towards that great object; and what en∣couragement they gave to all who should choose to exert themselves in your fa∣vour. Their unwearied endeavours were not wholly without success, and the un∣thinking people in many places became ill affected towards us on this account; for the ministers proceeded in your affairs just as they did with regard to those of America:—they always represented you as a parcel of blockheads, without sense, or even feeling; that all your words
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>
were only the echoes of faction here; and, as you have seen above, that you had not understanding enough to know that your trade was cramped by restrictive acts of the British parliament, unless we had, for factious purposes, given you the information.</P>
<P>They were so far from giving the least intimation of the measures which have since taken place, that those, who were supposed the most to know their inten∣tions, declared them impossible, in the actual state of the two kingdoms; and spoke of nothing but an act of union, as the only way that could be found of giving freedom of trade to Ireland, con∣sistently with the interests of this king∣dom. Even when the session opened, Lord North declared, that he did not know what remedy to apply to a disease, of the cause of which he was ignorant;

and, not being then entirely resolved how far they should submit to your energy, they, by anticipation, set the above au∣thor, or some of his associates, to fill the news-papers with invectives against us as distressing the minister by extravagant demands in favour of Ireland.</P>
<P>I need not inform you that every thing they asserted of the steps taken in Ireland, as the result of our machinations, was ut∣terly false and groundless. For myself, I sincerely protest to you, that I neither wrote a word nor received a line upon any matter relative to the trade of Ireland, or to the politicks of it, from the beginning of the last session to the day that I was honoured with your letter (of December 20th, 1779). It would be an affront to the talents in the Irish parliament to say one word more.</P>

What was done in Ireland during that period, in and out of parliament, never will be forgotten:—you raised an army, new in its kind, and adequate to its pur∣poses. It effected its ends without its exertion. It was not under the autho∣rity of law most certainly; but it de∣rived from an authority still higher: and, as they say of faith, it is not contrary to reason, but above it; so this army did not so much contradict the spirit of the law, as supersede it. What you did in the legislative body is above all praise. By your proceeding with regard to the supplies, you revived the grand charac∣teristick benefit of parliament, which was on the point of being entirely lost amongst us. These sentiments I never concealed, and never shall; and Mr. Fox expressed them with his usual power when he spoke on the occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="42"/>
All this is very honourable to you; but in what light must we see it? How are we to consider your armament without commission from the crown, when some of the first people in this kingdom have been refused arms at the time they did not only not reject, but so∣licited, the King's commissions. Here to arm and embody would be represented as little less than high treason, if done on private authority: with you it receives the thanks of a privy counsellor of Great Britain, who obeys the Irish House of Lords in that point with pleasure, and is made secretary of state the moment he lands here, for his reward. You shorten∣ed the credit given to the crown for six months; you hung up the publick cre∣dit of your kingdom by a thread; you refused to raise any taxes, whilst you confessed the publick debt and publick exigencies to be great and urgent beyond
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>
example:—you certainly acted in a great style, and on sound and invincible principles; but, if we, in the opposition which fills Ireland with such loyal honors, had even attempted, what we never did even attempt, the smallest delay, or the smallest line taken off the supply, in order to a constitutional coertion of the crown, we should have been decried, by all the court and tory mouths of this kingdom, as a desperate faction aiming at the direct ruin of the country, and to surrender it bound hand and foot to a foreign enemy. For actually doing what we never ventur∣ed to attempt, you have paid your court with such address, and have won so much favour with his Majesty and his cabinet, that they have, of their special grace and mere motion, raised you to new titles; and, for the first time, in a speech from the throne, complimented you with the appellation of "faithful and loyal;"
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>
and, in order to insult our low-spirited and degenerate obedience, have thrown these epithets and your resistance toge∣ther in our teeth. What do you think were the feelings of every man, who looks upon parliament in an higher light than that of a market overt for legalising a base traffick of votes and pensions, when he saw you employ such means of coertion to the crown, in order to coerce parliament through that medium? How much his Majesty is pleased with his part of the civility must be left to his own taste; but, as to us, you declared to the world, that you knew that the sole way of bringing us to reason, was to apply yourselves to the true source of all our opinions, and the only motive to all our conduct. Now, it seems, you think yourselves affronted, because a few of us express some indignation at the minister, who has thought fit to strip us stark
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>
naked, and expose the true state of our poxed and pestilential habit to the world. Think or say what they will in Ireland, I shall ever think it a crime hardly to be expiated by his blood. He might, and ought, by a longer continuance, or by an earlier meeting of parliament, to have given our concession the air of benignity, by making it a voluntary act; or he might have given us the credit of some wisdom in foreseeing and anticipating an approaching force:—so far from it, Lord Gower, coming out of his own cabinet, declares that one principal cause of his resignation was his not being able to pre∣vail on the present minister to give any sort of application to this business. Even on the late meeting, nothing determinate could be drawn from him, or from any of his associates, until you had actually passed the short money-bill, which mea∣sure they flattered themselves, and assured
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>
others, you would never come up to. Dis∣appointed in their expectation of seeing the siege raised, they surrendered at dis∣cretion.</P>
<P>Judge, my dear Sir, of our surprize at finding your censure directed against those whose only crime consisted in ac∣cusing the ministers of not having pre∣vented your demands by our graces; of not having given you the natural ad∣vantages of your country, in the most ample, the most early, and the most liberal manner; and for not having re∣laxed authority in such a manner as to ensure friendship. That you should make the panegyrick of the ministers, is what I expected; because, in praising their bounty, you paid a just compliment to your own force: but, that you should rail at us, either individually or col∣lectively, is what I can scarcely think a
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>
natural proceeding.—I can easily con∣ceive, that gentlemen might grow frightened at what they had done; that they might imagine they had undertaken a business above their hand; that the instruments of their power might be too vast and unmanageable for their direc∣tion; that, having obtained a state of independence for their country, they meant to take the deserted helm into their own hands, and to supply by their very real abilities the total insufficiency of the nominal government: all these might be real, and might be very justi∣fiable motives for their reconciling them∣selves cordially to the present court∣system; but I do not so well discern the reasons that could induce them, at the first feeble dawning of life in this country, to do all in their power to cast a cloud over it, and to prevent the least hope of our effecting the necessary re∣reformations
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>
which are aimed at in our constitution and in our national oeco∣nomy.</P>
<P>But, it seems, I was silent at the pass∣ing the resolution. Why, what had I to say? If I thought them too much, I should have been accused of an endeavour to inflame England. If I should repre∣sent them as too little, I should have been charged with a design of fomenting the discontents of Ireland into actual re∣bellion. The Treasury Bench represented that the affair was a matter of state; they represented it truly: I, therefore, only asked, whether they knew their propo∣sitions to be such as would satisfy Ireland; for, if they were so, they would satisfy me. This did not indicate that I thought them too ample. In this very silence, however dishonourable to parliament, there was one advantage, that the whole passed, as far as it is gone, with compleat
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>
unanimity, and so quietly, that there was no time left to execute any opposition to it out of doors.</P>
<P>In the West-India business, reasoning on what had lately passed in the parlia∣ment of Ireland, and on the mode in which it was opened here, I thought I saw much matter of perplexity; but I have now better reason than ever to be pleased with my silence.</P>
<P>If I had spoken, one of the honest and ablest men in the Irish parliament, would probably have thought my obser∣vations an endeavour to sow dissention, which he was resolved to prevent; and one of the most ingenious and one of the most amiable men, that ever graced yours, or any House of parliament, might have looked upon it as <HI>a chimera.</HI> Indeed, in the silence I observed, I was
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>
strongly countenanced (to say no more of it) by every gentleman of Ireland that I had the honour of conversing with in London. The only word, for that rea∣son, which I spoke, was to restrain a worthy country member, who had re∣ceived some communication from a great trading place in the county he represent∣ed, which, if it had been opened to the house, would have led to a perplexing discussion of one of the most troublesome matters that could arise in this business. I got up to put a stop to it; and, I be∣lieve, if you knew what the topic was, you would commend my discretion.</P>
<P>That it should be a matter of public discretion in me to be silent on the affairs of Ireland, is what, on all accounts, I bitterly lament. I stated to the house what I felt; and I felt, as strongly as hu∣man sensibility can feel, the extinction
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>
of my parliamentary capacity when I wished to use it most. When I came into this parliament, just fourteen years ago, then, in vulgar opinion at least, the presiding council of the greatest empire existing, (and perhaps, all things con∣sidered, that ever did exist,) obscure and a stranger as I was, I considered myself as raised to the highest dignity to which a creature of our species could aspire. In that opinion, one of the chief pleasures in my situation, what was first and up∣permost in my thoughts, was the hope (without injury to this country) to be somewhat useful to the place of my birth and education, which, in many respects, internal and external, I thought ill and impolitically governed: but when I found, that the house, surrendering itself to the guidance, not of an authority grown out of experience, wisdom, and integrity, but of the accidents of court favour, had be∣become
<PB N="54" REF="52"/>
the sport of the passions of men, at once rash and pusillanimous,—that it had even got into the habit of refusing every thing to reason, and surrendering every thing to force,—all my power of obliging either my country or individuals was gone; all the lustre of my imaginary rank was tarnished, and I felt degraded even by my elevation. I said this, or something to this effect. If it gives um∣brage to Ireland, I am sorry for it: it was the reason I gave for my silence, and it was, as far as it went, the true one.</P>
<P>With you, this silence of mine, and of others, was represented as factious, and as a discountenance to the measure of your relief.—Do you, then, think as children?—If it had been our wish to embroil matters, and, for the sake of dis∣tressing ministry, to commit the two kingdoms in a dispute, we had nothing
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>
to do but (without at all condemning the propositions) to have gone into the commercial detail of the objects of them. It could not have been refused to us; and you know the nature of business so well, that we must have caused such de∣lay, and given rise during that delay to such discussions, as all the wisdom of your favourite minister could never have settled. But, indeed, you mistake your men: we tremble at the idea of a dis∣union of these two nations. The only thing in which we differ with you, is this, that we do not think your attaching yourselves to the court, and quarrelling with the independent part of this people, is the way to promote the union of two free countries, or the holding them toge∣ther by the most natural and salutary ties.</P>
<P>You will be frightened when you see
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>
this long letter; I smile, when I con∣sider the length of it myself. I never, that I remember, wrote any of the same extent; but it shews me, that the re∣proaches of the country that I once be∣longed to, and in which I still have a dearness of interest more than I can justify to reason, make a greater impres∣sion on me than I imagined: but parting words are admitted to be a little tedious, because they are not likely to be renewed.—If it will not be making yourself as troublesome to others, as I am to you, I shall be obliged to you, if you will shew this, at their greatest leisure, to the Speaker, to your excellent kinsman, to Mr. Gratton, Mr. Yelverton, and Mr. Daly; all these I have the honour of being personally known to, except Mr. Yelverton, to whom I am only known by my obligation to him. If you live in any habits with my old friend the Provost,
<PB N="57" REF="55"/>
I shall be glad that he, too, sees this my humble apology.</P>
<P>Adieu!—Once more accept my best thanks for the interest you take in me; believe that it is received by an heart, not yet so old as to have lost its suscepti∣bility.—All here give you the best old∣fashioned wishes of the season; and be∣lieve me, with the greatest truth, and re∣gard,</P>

<P>I am frightened at the trouble I give you and our friends; but I recollect you

are mostly lawyers, and habituated to read long, tiresome papers, and, where your friendship is concerned, without a fee. I am sure, too, you will not act the lawyer, and scrutinize too minutely every expression which my haste may make me use.—I forgot to mention my friend O'Hara, and others; but you will com∣municate it as you please.</P>
