Navy; and the Encrease and Encouragement of

<P>In Two PARTS.</P>
<P>PART I. Demonstrating the Necessity of a Formidable Navy, what
our <HI>Naval Force</HI> is, in Number of Ships, their Names, Rates, Men,
and Guns, the Method of Manning the Navy; the Seamen's Treat∣ment,
and manner of Payment, and therein divers Hardships that
they suffer; the Prejudice accrueing to the Government, (and Nation
in general) thereby; as well as by the late manner of Impressing; the
Inconveniencies thereof demonstrated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>PART II. Containing an humble Proposal for removing the afore∣said
Grievances; and giving due Encouragement to the Seamen: ef∣fectually
Manning the Navy at all times, in few Days, and there∣by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving to the Government Three or Four Hundred Thousand
Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> in time of War, and be no Charge, but rather
save Monies in time of Peace: With a brief touch on <HI>Greenwich</HI>
Hospital, for Encreasing the Revenues thereof.</P>

Rendering the Royal Navy more serviceable (and less charge∣able)

<HEAD>INTRODƲCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE more difficult it appears to raise Monies, to discharge
the Publick Debts, and defray the present Expence, the more
acceptable to every candid and prudent Person must needs
be every just and reasonable Proposal to lessen the publick
Charge, save the Nations Wealth, aud also preserve its Peace, Tran∣quility
and Honour, both at Home and Abroad, which is intended by
the ensuing Treatise; the Subject whereof is the Royal Navy of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
consider'd in its present State, Discipline and Charge.</P>
<P>As the Royal Navy and Seamen of these Realms are of absolute
necessity for the Glory, Defence and enriching the same, so the ren∣dering
them more useful and less chargeable, than at present they are,
is a Concern of the highest Importance, and a Subject worthy to em∣ploy
the most noble and judicious Mind and Pen for effecting the same;
and forasmuch as the Means and Methods hitherto put in practice
have failed of the great end designed (I mean the engaging Persons to
serve in the Ships of War) and those whose knowledg and under∣standing
in the Naval Affairs, and large share in the Government of
the same, having manifold advantages that attend their Posts and
Trust, and might with great ease further (I may say) perfect so good
a Work: Yet not hearing that any have hitherto undertaken the same,
in Duty and Allegiance to His Majesty, and Love to my Countrey,
and considering how useful and advantagious to the Publick the Re∣gulation
of the Navy will be, and how far the present as well as fu∣ture
Tranquility and Safety of these Nations depends thereon (not∣withstanding
the many Difficulties that present themselves as well
from the Work, as the meanness of my Capacity for so great an Un∣dertaking,
the Loss, Discouragements and Misrepresentations that at∣tended
my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormer Endeavours) have adventured to publish the ensu∣ing
Treatise: the design whereof, is not so much to prove by Argu∣ment,
or otherwise, the necessity of regulating the Navy, as well in
the Discipline as the Charge thereof (that being a general Grievance,
and almost universal Complaint) as to propose some suteable and pro∣per
Remedies for the same. The method intended to make this, the
more plain and intelligible, is to shew briefly the necessity of a For∣midable
Navy, the present State of the same, for number of Ships,
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
their Names, Rates, Force, number of Officers and Seamen required
to Mann them, the Discipline of the Navy in procuring Men for the
Service, their Wages, Allowance, Treatment, and manner of Payment,
and by what means the Seamen are so much disgusted at the Service,
the evil Consequences thereof, by the great and unnecessary Expence,
delatory way of Equipment and Manning the Navy, and other Dis∣advantages
that attend the same. Wherein shall endeavour to avoid all
personal Reflection, or publishing to the World the Hardships our Sea∣men
endured in the late War, save only some few Instances (of many
Thousands which might be given) for Information. And Lastly, to
demonstrate the facility of performing, and advantage that will attend
the Method proposed for an effectual Remedy thereof: And humbly
submit the same to the Consideration of His Majesty, and both Houses
of Parliament.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing the Necessity of a Potent and Formidable Army.</HEAD>
<P>THat a Naval Force is necessary, we may learn from the situation
of these Kingdoms, which Providence hath so dispos'd, that
without the benefit of Navigation, we should not only lose the un∣speakable
Advantage that accrues by the Exportation of our Woollen
Manufactures, and other Merchandizes of the growth and produce of
these Kingdoms, but also be utterly depriv'd of all Correspondence
and Communication with our neighbour Nations, and also with our
numerous Colonies and Plantations abroad, whose sole dependence
for protection and supply, is on these Kingdoms; the which if inter∣rupted
by Foreign Force, would not only reduce them to Hardships
and Necessity, but also expose them, as well as these Lands, to the
Insuits of every Enemy, and cause them to become a Prey, and to sub∣mit
to the Yoak of every proud Invader.</P>
<P>This will further appear, if we consider the Honour and
Renown particularly applicable to the English Nation, the which as
it was gained, so it must be maintained by the Strength, Valour and
Prowess of our Forces by Sea, and that cannot be without a sufficient
and well disciplin'd Navy, which must be formidable, by reason our
Neighbours (<HI>France</HI> especially) within these few years by prudent
precaution and good management, in breeding up, exercising and well
disciplining Mariners for their Service, are become so potent, that in
the late War which continued near 10 years, notwithstanding the As∣sistance
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
of our powerful Ally (the <HI>Hollander</HI>) our Merchandize was
much interrupted, our Losses many, whole Squadrons several times
defeated, <HI>viz. The</HI> West-India <HI>Fleet under Convoy of the</HI> Norwich,
<HI>and other Men of War, The</HI> Straights <HI>Fleet and Squadron under
Sir</HI> George Rook, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Great part of the grand Fleet put to flight,
and chas'd into our own Harbours, <HI>viz. The Earl of</HI> Torrington,
<HI>joined with a Squadron of</HI> Dutch, <HI>after the loss of several Ships was
pursu'd into the</HI> Downs, <HI>and in danger of being destroy'd:</HI> Our Land
threaten'd with Invasion, <HI>viz. The intended Descent from</HI> Dunkirk,
Calais, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and this by the Power of <HI>France</HI> alone, when at War
with most Princes of <HI>Europe.</HI> And if we consider his present Alli∣ance
and Conjunction with, or rather absolute Government over the
extensive and rich Dominions of <HI>Spain,</HI> it too evidently demonstrates
what we must expect from those united Powers, if not prevented by
a speedy, prudent and effectual regulation of our Navy, and encrea∣sing
and encouraging our Seamen, which in appearance is the only
reasonable and probable means to put a stop and curb to the growing
Power, and ambitious Designs and Incroachments of that potent and
politick Prince, who already seems to dispise the whole Power of
<HI>Europe.</HI> The Consideration whereof I hope will put to silence those,
that would by undervaluing our Enemies, and overprising our own
Strength and Naval Discipline, obstruct a work designed not only for
the present advantage of the Nation, in saving much more Money in
few years in case of a War, than the Q's and R's would do in many
(the which at the best is but saved from the Poor; many of whom
are ready to perish) and would also for ever remove those Hardships,
which of late have render'd His Majesty's Service grievous to the Sea∣men,
and very burthensome to the Nation in general. But more
particularly to this hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Describing the Royal Navy, their Names, Rates, Number of Ships,
and also the Number of Cannon, with which they are mounted in
time of War.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Royal Navy, as by this Table, being according to the best
Account I can at present have, consists of 180 Fighting
Ships, including those of the 5th and 6th Rate (besides 11 Fire-Ships,
13 Bomb-Vessels, and about 70 Sail of Sloops, Yatchts, Store-Ships,
and other small Vessels. But in case of fixed Battles or Sea-Fights
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
the 5th and 6th Rate Ships are seldom used in the Line of
Battle, and are indeed more serviceable for Convoys, Cruisers, and
the like Services. This Royal Navy, as well Strangers as our own
Nation, for Number of Ships, their Burthen, Force, Compleatness
of Building, and Excellency of Sailing in general, have deservedly
esteemed to excel all others in the World: The Cannon wherewith
they are mounted in time of War, are in Number near 10000 Brass
and Iron, and are for Nature and Make according to the former Dis∣position
and Manner of our Mariner's Fighting (whose Custom was to
fight Board and Board, Yard-Arm and Yard-Arm, Through and
Through, as they termed it, and not at a distance in a Line, and the like,
which Practice till of late our Seniors say they were Strangers to,)
they are therefore much shorter and of larger Boar than the French,
with whom to fight at a distance is very disadvantageous, as has been
observed in several Fights of late, their Balls or Bullets flying over
our Ships, before ours could reach them by a Mile (but this by In∣formation)
and supposing it Fact, it must needs be disadvantageous to
fight at a distance with an Enemy, whose Arms and Weapons are lon∣ger
than our own.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing the Number of Commission, Warrant, and Petty Officers▪ and
able and ordinary Seamen, requisite to Mann tbe whole Navy in time
of War.</HEAD>
<P>ITS to be considered, the Strength of the Navy consists not in the
Ships only, but as they are well equipt and manned with sober,
judicious, experienc'd and courageous Commanders and Officers, with
a sufficient Number of able Seamen, both for defending themselves
and offending the Enemy; and in case we fail here, ruin must enevi∣tably
ensue; for if by the Ignorance, Cowardize, or Disaffection of
the Commander, (<HI>viz.</HI> as the Captains of the <HI>Diamond, Jersey,</HI>
and <HI>New Portsmouth, &amp;c.</HI>) or for want of a sufficient Number of
able Seamen, the Ships become defenseless, they will then instead
of being Walls and Bullwarks to defend, prove as so many de∣serted
and strong Fortresses to annoy (I may say destroy) us. Our
Ancestors therefore did prudently take the utmost Care to im∣ploy
and prefer in the Navy such sober, brave, and judicious Com∣manders
and Officers as had signalized themselves both by Cou∣rage
and Conduct, as well in Merchant-Men as Men of War on all
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
occasions (an Example well worthy imitation) but to assert how far
this Method was either practis'd or neglected in the late War, being
in a great Measure a Stranger to the Merits of the Gentlemen im∣ployed,
I shall rather forbear to mention than take common Fame
or Report for my Author, and submit it to the Nation's Experience
to determine.</P>
<P>The Officers imployed are Admirals, Vice Admirals, Rear Admirals,
Commanders in chief, Captains and Lieutenants, all appointed by Com∣missions
from the Lord High Admiral of <HI>England, Ireland, &amp;c.</HI> or Lords
Commissioners for Executing that Office: (and of those some tell us,
there are always two, or more, waiting for one Commission) their
Pay and Encouragement is according to the Honour of their Post and
Trust, so considerable, that Noble-men of our own Nation, as well
as those of others, have gladly embraced the said Imployments.</P>
<P>The Flag-Officers, or Admirals, (that are now in command) are,
Admiral of the Red, and Commander in Chief of the Fleet)
the Right Honourable Sir <HI>George Rook.</HI> Vice Admiral None. Rear
Admiral Capt. <HI>Benbow.</HI> Admiral of the Blew, the Right Honourable
Sir <HI>Cloudsley Shouell.</HI> Vice Admiral, Col. <HI>Hopsonn.</HI> Rear Admiral,
Capt. <HI>Munden.</HI> There being no White Squadron at Sea, the Flags
in Half-pay, as I am inform'd, are the Right Honourable the Mar∣quiss
of <HI>Carmarthen,</HI> Admiral <HI>Killigrew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Ralph Dallivall.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these Flag-Officers, there is to every First, Second, Third,
Fourth and Fifth Rate Ship a Captain, and one or more Lieutenants,
according to their Rates, as by the Table (<HI>Pag.</HI> 3.) appears. The
Commanders of the Sixth Rates are for the most part only Ma∣sters
and Commanders, and not Captains, and are not entituled to
Half-pay; but all those are also appointed, and have their Commis∣sions
and Warrants from the Lord High Admiral, or Lords Commissi∣oners
for executing that Office. The number of the Captains entituled
to Half-pay, appears by the said Establishment to be 195, besides some
that were suspended and have of late gotten their Suspension off,
and about 40 Commanders that have commanded Sixth Rate Frigots,
Bomb Vessels, and the like, that do not take Post, neither are account∣ed
in the said Number. Under those Captains there are Lieutenants,
Masters, Gunners, Boatswains and Carpenters, with other Warrant
and Petty Officers, according to the Rates of the Ships, as appears
by the said Table, who with the Officers Servants, ordinary Seamen,
Gromets, (or well grown Lads) and Boys, were always accounted
in the late War (taking the Navy through) to be near two thirds of
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
their Complement: So that if 40000 Men be required to man the
Navy, (according to the estimate given the Honourable House of Com∣mons
the <HI>4th</HI> of <HI>November</HI> 96) and two thirds of those, <HI>viz.</HI> 26666,
are Officers, and Officers Servants, ordinary Seamen, Landmen, Gro∣mets,
and Boys, the other third, <HI>viz.</HI> 13334, able Seamen, besides
Officers, are as many as were at any time employ'd in the Navy, du∣ring
the late War; and 16 or 18 Thousand Seamen, are by many Com∣manders
judg'd sufficient effectually to navigate and fight the same.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Describing the Methods used to Man the Navy, and the Reasons of
the Seamens backwardness to enter into the Service.</HEAD>
<P>AS for the Warrant and many petty Officers, they generally en∣tring
voluntarily for the benefit of the said Employments, I
shall consider the manner of procuring the common (able and ordina∣ry)
Seamen, under which Titles all able bodied Landmen are inclu∣ded,
which is thus.</P>
<P>First by inviting them by Proclamation, beat of Drum, and other
publick Notice, to enter into the Service, with a promise of Gratuity,
or Reward, to such Mariners and able bodied Landmen as enter'd
themselves by a certain prefixed time; which Gratuity has sometimes
been Three Pounds Nine Shillings to every able Seaman, as well
Masters, Mates, and all petty Officers, as others, and to every ordi∣nary
Seaman, and able bodied Landman, Two Pound Fourteen Shil∣lings;
which Gratuity, with His Majesty's allowance of Wages and
Provisions, is sufficient to engage Men to desire and covet His Maje∣sty's
Service. Nevertheless Experience informs us, that most part of
those that enter themselves are Mates and Midshipmen, and such as
expect other Offices and Imployments, which Imployments alone
would engage them to enter themselves if no such Bounty were given,
so that the Bounty given answers not the end intended by it, few
common able Seamen entering themselves for the same. The Rea∣sons
whereof will appear by what ensues.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the late War several hundreds enter'd them∣selves
Volunteers in the Service, and marched chearfully many Miles
by Land to serve their King and Country, but this continued not long,
for instead thereof they became averse to the Service, and as many
thousands deserted from it, absconded, and hid themselves till the
Fleet has been manned and put to Sea (which has been for great
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
part of the Year) and so became useless and a Burthen to the Nati∣on,
by reducing their Families to Poverty, and becoming chargeable
to the Places where they inhabited: Wherefore it will not be amiss
to enquire into the Reasons and Occasions thereof. First, Is not the
Danger of Battle and Seamen's Cowardize one Reason why they a∣void
the Service? To this I answer negatively: They never being so
much as charged with Cowardize or Backwardness to engage the E∣nemy
when commanded to fight; but on the contrary have often pro∣voked
their Commanders to it, and ready to tare their Hair, when
through the Cowardize or Backwardness of their Commanders they
have been kepr from engaging, and so lost their Purchase. For In∣stance,
<HI>not only the Ships aforesaid, but also the Captain of the</HI> Tyger,
<HI>and divers others have by Cowardize lost many Prizes which they might
have taken.</HI> But the Reasons the Seamen give, are chiefly the Evil
Treatment, and other Hardships they endured in the Service; and
those principally complain'd of are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Captains promising those that enter, that they shall be
preferred to considerable Employments, as Masters Mates, Midship∣men,
and the like, of which there is no performance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Their unkind, and (if I may say as they do) cruel Treatment,
when on Board.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The turning them over from Ship to Ship, contrary to Publica∣tion,
and the disadvantage that accrues thereby.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Keeping them many years out of their Wages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The uncertain and intricate manner of Payments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Querying them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Making them Run, with many other Hardships of the like nature.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>First, That the Captains have promised those that have thus enter'd
themselves, that they should be Masters Mates, Midshipmen, and
the like, and accordingly they have acted as such, and officiated the
said Offices, but at the payment of the Ships the Captains Cooks,
Stewards, Servants, and other Favourites have receiv'd the Wages, and
reap'd the benefit of the said Employments, to the great Discourage∣ment
of able and ingenious Mariners: And though Multitudes of In∣stances
might be given, I shall for brevity sake trouble the Reader
with one Instance only for Proof thereof. The which as it has been
related, is,</P>
<P>One <HI>Anthony Sollet</HI> of <HI>Scarbrough</HI> (who had for several years been
Mate of Colliers) about the year 92, in Compliance with the de∣sire
of a Member of Parliament, and Magistrates of that Town, and
upon the promise of being made a Masters Mate of the Ship, for
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
which he enter'd, did encourage 50 Seamen more to enter with him
for His Majesty's Service, (16 of which were promis'd Midshipmens,
Quartermasters, and other Petty Offices and Imployments,) and accord∣ingly
went on Board a Press-Vessel appointed to receive them, and
sailed to <HI>New-castle,</HI> where the Vessel was laden with Coals; and
those Volunteers were lent by the Lieutenant to several Masters of Col∣liers
at 5 <HI>l.</HI> each to bring their Ships to <HI>London;</HI> and when they arriv∣ed
at the <HI>Noure,</HI> instead of being put on Board the respective Ships for
which they enter'd themselves, they were brought up to <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
and confined on Board the said Vessel: Whereupon the said <HI>Anthony
Sollet</HI> having an opportunity leaped over-Board, and swam ashore,
and in that Condition went to <HI>Westminster</HI> to the Member that encou∣raged
them to enter themselves, and acquainted him therewith, who in∣formed
the Flag (under whom the Lieuetenant servd') thereof, and the
Lieutenant, with all the other Volunteers were immediately sent for;
and the Men complaining, that the Lieutenant would not give them any
part of the Monies earned by them; the Flag ordered them one
half, <HI>viz. 50s.</HI> each, and allow'd the Lieuetenant the other half,
which the Men accepted, remembring the Old Proverb, (<HI>That half a
Loaf is better than no Bread;</HI>) but as to the Offices and Imploy∣ments
promis'd, not one of the 50 had any more than common Sea∣men's
Wages: The said <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llet</HI> indeed had the Honour to officiate as
Midshipman under the Flag, and should have received 45 Shillings
<HI>per</HI> Month for the same, but was paid off with <HI>23s. per</HI> Month, able
Seamen's Pay; and when discharg'd from the Service, himself, with
such others as remain'd alive and were discharg'd, return'd home to
give the Town an account of their kind Treatment, for a future In∣couragement
to others to enter themselves.</P>
<P>The Second Complaint, is their Treatment on Board.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Of the new invented Names wherewith some of their Com∣manders
and Officers constantly call them, <HI>viz. Sons of Eternal
Whores, Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ods of Eternal Bitches, &amp;c.</HI> And as they call, so they
curse them with such horrid and blasphemous Imprecations, and Lan∣guage
that I even blush to mention, and were it not for hopes of refor∣ming
the same, would never transmit to Posterity such abominable
and atheistical Expressions; one or two (too many) of those of late
invented and frequently used, are enough to make one tremble. Some
Gentlemen discoursing of the vicious and impious Expressions of the
Officers of the Navy, <HI>viz.</HI> their calling on God to Damn their Bloods,
to curse themselves, and the like Expressions; a Commander of a
Merchant Ship, who had served in the Navy eight years, replyed,
that such Expressions were not to compare with what he had fre∣quently
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
heard from them; amongst others, one was their manner of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Damn their Bloods, they would Roast their Souls in Hell.</NOTE> Cursing the Men; others have told them, they
would <HI>make them curse God and die,</HI> &amp;c. with many o∣ther
impious Expressions not fit to be mention'd.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As they esteem, call, and curse them,
so they use them, having with their new invented
Oaths, new invented Punishments, <HI>viz.</HI> that sordid
and slavish Punishment of <HI>Whipping,</HI> or rather (as
themselves term it) <HI>Fleaing them alive,</HI> and then <HI>Pickling of them.</HI>
The manner whereof is to fasten or tye a Man with his Hands and
Legs extended to the Blackstakes, Capston, or Jeers of the Ship, and
strip him to the Waste, and with Whips of Cords, called <HI>Cats of
Nine Tails,</HI> divers have had so many Lashes, as have made the
Punishment worse than Death (as some Inflictors have told them be∣fore-hand,)
and being thus whipped, or rather flead, a Tub of Brine or
Pickle from their Salt Meat has been prepared; into which some (to
make the Punishment the greater) have caus'd more Salt to be put;
with which they have washed their flead Bodies, and whipt and pickl'd
them again: The dread of which Punishment has not only caus'd
many to desert the Service, but also to indeavour to destroy them∣selves:
And this Punishment (how cruel soever it is) is now become
so common, that Men are often thus treated on frivolous Occasions.</P>
<P>For Instance, His Majesty's Ship the <HI>Betty,</HI> a 5th Rate, which fail∣ed
for the Straits, after the Peace was concluded, whose Comple∣ment
being about 90 or 100 Men: The Captain being excellent at this
Exercise, and other Severities, so many of his Men, (and those the
best of his common Seamen) left the Ship, that he was forc'd to get
Spaniards, and other Foreigners to bring her home: Divers Complaints
thereof being made to the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of the Admiralty, I shall not mention
the same.</P>
<P>Another Instance, is, one <HI>John Wilkinson,</HI> who belonged to His Ma∣jesty's
Ship the <HI>Sheereness</HI> in 1697, and being at <HI>Tobago</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
he was with the rest of the Ship's Company forc'd to go on
Shoar and cut Timber, to carry to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> for the Captain's Ad∣vantage;
by which means many of them were taken sick and died;
and the said <HI>John Wilkinson</HI> complaining that he was not well,
nor able to work any longer in that slavish manner, the Captain
sent the Doctor down to see whether he was really sick or not,
who return'd and told the Captain, he could not say that he was sick,
nor that he was well; whereupon the Captain sent for him up, and
order'd him to be strip'd, and seiz'd to the Jeers, and to have, first 20
Blows with a Cat of Nine Tails, and then 19 more, and then pick∣led
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
him; but the Captain not being satisfied therewith, order'd him to
have 60 Blows more with another Cat, made of knotted Wier instead
of Cords; then Commanded him to beg Pardon, which when he had
complyed with, was ordered to have 19 Blows more, and then re∣leas'd,
and scoffingly bid go to Sleep (in a miserable Pickle indeed,) and
this for no other reason (as I am inform'd) than what is aforementioned.</P>
<P>One Instance more is of <HI>John Savage,</HI> who served in His Majesty's
Ship the <HI>Monmouth</HI> several years, but happened to disgust the Cap∣tain,
in desiring some Allowance for his share of Goods, that were
sav'd out of a Prize they had taken, which was afterwards sunk;
and the Captain finding an opportunity chastised his Insolence: The
pretended occasion and manner whereof was as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI> One
<HI>Hall</HI> that was Boatswain of the Ship, (and the most moross Man of
that Imploy in the Navy) having struck the said <HI>Savage</HI> several times
with his Cane (without any just Provocation) <HI>Savage</HI> took hold of his
Cane to prevent his striking any more; which the Captain understand∣ing,
told him, <HI>he had better been hang'd than offended,</HI> or Words to
that purpose; and that he would first duck, and then flea and pickle
him; and accordingly order'd him to be made fast to a Rope prepared
for that purpose: The said <HI>Savage</HI> dreading this cruel Punishment,
endeavour'd to get loose and drown himself; which the Captain per∣ceiving,
caused his Hands to be seized, or tied; and after having duck'd
him three times, then whipt and pickled him to that degree, that none
believ'd he could live, leaving such Marks of his Kindness in his Back,
that Men could bury their Fingers therein; of which Wounds he con∣tinued
ill along time.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The confining Men 5 or 6 years, or more on board, with∣out
Liberty to see their Friends or Families, or refresh themselves on
Shoar, or paying them any part of their Wages for their own, or Fa∣milies
Subsistance, who must have perished for want, (notwithstand∣ing
the Monies due to them in the Service,) had they not been sup∣ported
by their Neighbour's Charity. <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Richmond</HI> commen∣ced
Wages the first of <HI>October</HI> 92, and ended the 8th of <HI>August</HI> 98,
being almost 6 years. The <HI>Royal Oak</HI> commenced Wages the 1st of
<HI>October</HI> 92, and ended the 3d of <HI>January</HI> 97-98;, being almost 5 years
and a half. The <HI>Norfolk, Lancaster, Lime, Swan,</HI> and divers o∣thers
had upwards of 6 or 7 years Pay due, before they were paid.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Another Discouragement, is the uncertain and intricate
manner of Payment lately practis'd, <HI>viz.</HI> At the Payment of some
Ships, the Men only that then belong'd to the Ships, and were pre∣sent,
were paid their Wages, and the Wives, Widows, and Relations
of such as were turned over into other Ships, or died on board, were
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
left unpaid, <HI>viz.</HI> At the Payment of the <HI>Oak, Russel</HI> and <HI>Canterbu∣ry,</HI>
at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> in <HI>January</HI> 97-98;, and many other Ships at other Pla∣ces;
the Men only that then belong'd to the Ships and were present,
(which are seldom one fourth part of the Ships Company) were paid
their Wages, and all others left unpaid, although they had been 5 or
6 years without Payment. One Instance of many hundreds, is <HI>John
Bartlet,</HI> who enter'd on board the <HI>Oak</HI> the 1st of <HI>October</HI> 92, and was
turn'd over into the <HI>Essex,</HI> the 25th of <HI>June</HI> 95, and was
on board the said Ship when the <HI>Oak</HI> was paid off at <HI>Portsmouth:</HI>
His Wife in expectation of receiving his Wages for the <HI>Oak,</HI> when that
Ship was order'd to be paid, went to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and continued there a∣bout
3 Months; but at the Payment of the Ship, was (with all o∣thers
in the like Circumstances) denied her Husbands Wages, and
forc'd to take up Money on the Credit of the Ticket, for defraying
the Expence of her said Journey; and at last (through Necessity)
to sell it at a very great Loss; which Ticket is yet unpaid; and some
thousands more for that, and other Ships, which were paid after the
same manner, have not their Monies that was earn'd 8 or 9 years
since; and there are about 100 Ships to be paid on the List of Recalls
before them; and some of these distressed People were constrained
to pawn their Cloaths for Subsistance, whilst at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and on
the Road, although they would gladly have sold their Tickets at 7
or 8 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound Loss; but not being able to give Security against
such Iucumbrances as might happen, none would buy them.</P>
<P>2. At the Payment of many Ships it <HI>Chatham</HI> in the year 97, and
at other times, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Britannia, Queen, London, Vanguard,</HI> and
other First, Second, and most Third Rates; not only the Persons that
actually belong'd to them were paid, but such as were turn'd over to
other Ships, and could he present themselves, and those whose
Wives, Widows, Fathers, Mothers, Brothers or Sisters, were per∣sonally
present, were paid; but the Wages of such who could not be
present themselves, and whose Wives, Widows, and Relations liv'd
at distances, and had imployed others to receive their Monies, were
then refus'd the same, and the Persons to whom it belong'd are yet
unpaid. For Instance, <HI>Edmond Hall</HI> in the St. <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Sandwich,</HI>
and <HI>Thomas Cales</HI> in the St. <HI>Andrew, Britannia,</HI> and <HI>Dutchess,</HI> and
divers others, which occasioned many Ticket-Buyers to forge Powers
to pretended Relations, to get their Monies paid, when as beforesaid,
those that were imploy'd for the Benefit or the Relations, neither
were, nor are paid to this time.</P>
<P>3. When Men have been turn'd over from one Ship to another, they
have sometimes been paid their Wages for the Ships out of which
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
they went, at the Payment of the same Ships, sometimes at the Pay∣ment
of those Ships they were turn'd into, and sometimes at the
Payment of neither; and at other times some of them only have
been paid, and many others left unpaid. For Instance:</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Hampton Court</HI>'s Men were turned into the <HI>Rupert,</HI> and
their Wages for the <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> was paid at the Payment of the
<HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> the Ship out of which they came, and not at the
Payment of the <HI>Rupert.</HI></P>
<P>2. The <HI>Cumberland</HI>'s Men were also turn'd over into the <HI>Rupert,</HI>
and their Wages for the <HI>Cumberland</HI> paid at the Payment of the <HI>Ru∣pert,</HI>
and not at the Payment of the <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P>3. The <HI>Chester</HI>'s Men were turned over into the <HI>Royal Katharine,</HI>
and part of them were paid, at the Payment of the <HI>Chester,</HI> and o∣thers
promised to be paid on board the <HI>Katharine,</HI> but were not paid
at the Payment of the <HI>Chester,</HI> nor of the <HI>Royal Katharine,</HI> neither
were paid in 5 years after, <HI>viz.</HI> Amongst others, one <HI>Robert Will∣son,</HI>
who serv'd in the <HI>Chester</HI> from the 1st of <HI>July</HI> 92, to the 14th
of <HI>April</HI> 96, at which time he was turn'd over into the <HI>Royal Katha∣rine;</HI>
his Wages for the <HI>Chester</HI> (including 10 <HI>l.</HI> due to him for short
Allowance of Provisions) amounted almost to 90 <HI>l.</HI> which Ticket he
was afterwards forc'd to sell at a great Loss: Likewise the <HI>Hum∣ber</HI>'s
Men were turned into the St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> the <HI>Britannia</HI>'s, St. <HI>An∣drew</HI>'s
and <HI>Dutchess</HI>'s Men, turned over from one to the other, and
the Wages for that time are not yet paid, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that by this means
many thousands of People are yet without their Monies, long since
earned.</P>
<P>4. Some Ships that have had several years Pay due, have been
paid for some Months only, the later time and the former left unpaid,
<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Woolwich</HI> commenc'd Wages the fifteenth of <HI>October</HI> 95; and
the Captain, with some of the Men, were turn'd into other Ships the
10th of <HI>March</HI> 96-97, and another Captain serv'd in her between the 17th
of <HI>April</HI> 97, and the 15th of <HI>February</HI> 97-98;, and those that serv'd in her
for the last time were paid their Wages at <HI>London</HI> in <HI>Febr.</HI> 97-98;, but
those that serv'd in her for the former time were not paid until <HI>August</HI>
98 at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and many of them yet remain unpaid: Likewise
the <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and others, were paid in the same manner; and there
are now on the List for Recalls about 170 Ships before the <HI>Woolwich,</HI>
and 220 before the <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to be recalled.</P>
<P>5. Many Ships have been paid without any publick notice given,
<HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z.</HI> The <HI>Rupert-Prize</HI> at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> the <HI>Deptford</HI> at the <HI>Nour,</HI>
and others; so that Persons could not appear at their Payments to re∣ceive
their Monies, nor are the said Ships yet recalled.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16"/>
6. As the Payments have been uncertain, so likewise have the Re∣calls,
<HI>viz.</HI> About the years 96-97, the Ships were paid Alphabetically,
according to the Letters the Ships Names begun with, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Al∣bemarle,</HI>
and all others of the Letter A first, then those of the Let∣ter
B, and so on, but that Method was again laid aside in 97, and the
Recalls were carried on, according to a List publish'd, (which was the
first of that Nature) on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays; but be∣fore
one half of the List was paid, it was again laid aside, and not
recall'd till <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April</HI> 1700; at which time it was again alter'd
to Tuesdays only, and then but <HI>500l. per</HI> Week to be paid; so that several
Ships of the Third and Fourth Rates were 3 Weeks, or a Month on
Recall, which might have been finished in one or two days at most, and
all the Ships paid according to that Method, which continued 20
Weeks, might have been paid in less than 10 days, but this Method
also ceas'd in <HI>October</HI> 1700, and the List laid aside, and no further
Payments made thereon, until <HI>June</HI> 1701, which List is not yet fully
paid; with other things too numerous to incert; which Practice, be∣sides
the trouble of continual Attendance in Expectation of Payment
(has put the people to vast and unnecessary Expence, and) has been
the only Foundation and Support of the Trade of Ticket-Buying (so
much exclaim'd against;) the people being credited whilst from their
Habitations attending the Pay 5 or 6 Months, were forc'd to sell their
Tickets at 7 <HI>s.</HI> or 8 <HI>s.</HI> per Pound Loss. Another Discouragement is,</P>
<P>7. The putting Queries on sick Men, and obliging them to return
on board as soon as discharged from sick Quarters, which being ac∣counted
so great a Support to the Discipline of the Navy. I shall
be more particular in describing the same, agreeable in Substance, with
what I formerly presented the Right Honourable the Lords of the
Admiralty, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>It's the Practice of the Navy, for Brevity sake, to use divers Let∣ters
on their Books, to distinguish the Reasons or Causes of Men's
Discharge.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Letter <HI>D,</HI> which denotes a Man to be discharged from
the Service.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The Letter R, denotes a Man to be a Deserter, or Run
from the Service.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Letters <HI>DD,</HI> which denote a Man to be discharg'd
by Death.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Letters <HI>DSS,</HI> which denote a Man to be discharged
by reason of Sickness,</P>
<P>Which were all the Letters formerly us'd, for that purpose: But in
<HI>March</HI> 1690-91 (soon after the great Sickness and Mortality that hap∣pen'd
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
in the Navy) was invented the Query, and denoted on the Kings
Books by the Letters <HI>Q</HI> or <HI>Qr.</HI> This Query, according to its first in∣stitution,
the Captains were to put against the Names of all Persons
whom they should set on shoar Sick, unless they see just cause to dis∣charge
them from the Service, which the Captains often did, having no
hopes of their being further serviceable; and in such case they some∣times
discharged them with <HI>DSS,</HI> (only) as formerly, sometimes they
noted the Malady or Distemper which render'd them uncapable, as Bur∣sten,
Aged, Consumptive, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and somtimes made out Tickets signed
by the Officers for their Wages. And to prevent the many Inconvenien∣cies
that were like to attend those Queries, divers Articles of In∣structions
were given both to the Commanders and to the Commissi∣oners,
and Agents, for taking care of Sick and Wounded Seamen, to
observe. The Substance of which are as followeth.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That when any Men were set on Shoar sick, their Cloaths and
Bedding should be sent on Shoar with them, to prevent their being lost,
and for their Relief.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Commissioners for Sick and Wounded, should take
care to return them to their Ships as soon as recover'd, or to some o∣ther
Ship, until they could meet with the respective Ships out of which
they came; and if none of His Majesty's Ships should be in that Port,
to give them Conduct-Money to travel to the next Port, where any of His
Majesty's Ships were.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That all Commanders should receive all Sick Men sent on
board by the Agents for Sick and Wonded Seamen, and should put them
on board their respective Ships, as soon as they should meet with them.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That the said Commissioners, and all the Commanders of
His Majesty's Ships, should hold a constant Correspondence with each
other, that the Commanders might know how their Sick Men were dis∣pos'd
of, in order to do both them and His Majesty Justice, by giving
each Person set ashoar Sick, a proper discharge: that is, such as died in
Quarters, note them to be dead on the Ships Books, and such as conti∣nued
in Quarters, to note that, or if discharg'd thence, how dispo∣sed
of, whether cured and order'd to return to their respective Ships,
or to any other Ship, or if not perfectly cured, to go to the Hospital, or
to their own Houses for Recovery, or if run from sick Quarters, to
set <HI>R's</HI> against their Names, to signify the same.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Directions for putting each Man's Number on the Ship-Book
in his Sick Ticket, for the better distinguishing the Parties.</P>
<P>But how far those Instructions were complied with, and of what
advantage those Queries have been, either to His Majesty's Service,
or the Seamen, will in some measure appear by what follows, be∣ing,
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
as aforesaid, the Substance of what was deliver'd to the Right
Honourable the Lords of the Admiralty and Commissioners of the
Navy, on the Reference of the Seamen's Petitions to them by the
Honourable House of Commons, <HI>viz. The principal Reasons for ma∣king
the Queries consider'd, and the Objections against taking them off
answer'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The first Reason given for making these Queries, was,</HI> That the Cap∣tains
of smaller Ships complain'd, that when their Men were set on
shoar Sick, they return'd not to their proper Ships, but enter'd on board
the great Ships; and that by this means they often wanted Men.</P>
<P>That this Reason has little Weight, appears by the constant Prac∣tice
of the Navy; in that such Ships (whether great or small) as
are order'd on any Expedition, if they want Men, are supply'd out of
other Ships, and the most and best parts of the small Ship's Companies
are frequently order'd on board the great Ships, and the small ones
left <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o recruit their Complements again: besides, the small Ships be∣ing
imploy'd in cruising, and the like; not one in ten of such sick
Men could ever return to them, nor could it be anywise pre∣judicial
to the Service, if the Men were on board any of His Majes∣ty's
Ships, being there ready to be order'd, where they might be
most serviceable; so that this Reason cannot be sufficient to bring
them under the Hardships of the Queries.</P>
<P><HI>The second Reason is,</HI> That some dissembled and feign'd themselves
Sick to get a Discharge from the Service.</P>
<P>This Reason indeed agrees with many of their Officer's Opinions,
who always esteem the Seamen to be Dissemblers, till Death con∣vinces
them of the contrary; Therefore they will not easily be im∣pos'd
on to set any on shoar, but such as are sick indeed, as may be
amply prov'd by the Inhabitants of the Sea-Ports, who have been Eye-Witnesses
of the many and sad Spectacles of Mortality frequently set
on shoar; Some having perish'd in the Streets, and Others immedi∣ately
after they were receiv'd into Quarters: And a Gentleman well
acquainted with those Affairs, modestly computes our loss by Sickness
during the late War, to be above 40000 Men; <HI>a slender Inducement
to believe them Dissemblers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The third Reason is,</HI> That many after they recovered, enter'd into Mer∣chant's
Service, and return'd not to any of His Majesty's Ships.</P>
<P>This Reason is also of little weight if we consider, that there were
thousands of Men discharg'd every year in perfect Health, who might
without Opposition serve in the Merchants Ships: Now how reason∣able
it is to require the sick or half-recovered Men to return on board,
and at the same time discharge so many thousand Men in health:
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
I shall submit to better Judgments. But to proceed to the <HI>Objections.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. That such Men as returned not to their proper Ships
when recovered, but enter'd on Board the great Ships for lucre of His
Majesty's Bounty, ought to forfeit their Wages.</P>
<P><HI>Answer:</HI> This I believe is not the Case of one in a hundred, but
admit it were, His Majesty being graciously pleased to allow Bounty
to those that enter'd themselves voluntarily, altho they never serv'd in
the Navy before, and also to those who had served 6 or 9 Months only
in the great Ships, and had not been discharged and paid off above 6
Weeks or 2 Months before they re-enter'd again: It seems to be a great
Hardship, that those who had served several years (and been turn'd over
from Ship to Ship, lost their Healths, and expended most, if not the
whole of their Wages before recovered) should forfeit and loose 12
Months, or 2 Years Pay for receiving 3 <HI>l. 9 s.</HI> Bounty: and it seems
a great Mistery to <HI>Query</HI> two or three hundred sick Men, and oblige
them to return on board, and at the same time discharge ten thou∣sand
Men in perfect Health. For Instance, the <HI>Brittania</HI> as aforesaid,
and 20 Sail of first, second, and third Rate Ships, and many others were
several times paid off, and heir Companies discharged; and at the same
time, those that were set sick on shoar <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry'd</HI> if they did not return.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. That if the Queries are all taken off, it will relieve the
Guilty, as well as the Innocent.</P>
<P><HI>Answer:</HI> If there be no solid Reason for making the Queries, no
Person should lose his Wages by them; but admit it were reasona∣ble
to make and continue the Queries, yet there is no Ground for
this Objection; for as before is explain'd, the Queries were only in∣tended
to remain until the Commanders could have Advice from the
proper Officers what became of their Men, and therefore ought to
be satisfied between themselves, and to give the sick Persons a pro∣per
Discharge, and those only that R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nn to be noted with R's, as a∣foresaid;
and it is not the Query (even according to the Genuine
Construction of the Articles for making the Queries) that should be an
Obstruction to the Payment of their Wages.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. That it will greatly add to the Nations Debt; there being
several thousand Pounds due to Persons under those Circumstances, and
that the present Exigency of Affairs will not admit the raising such
great Sums as will be required to pay them.</P>
<P><HI>Answer:</HI> The greatness of the Debt can in no wise g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve Colour
to this Objection; for the greater the Debt is, the more numerous
are the Poor that have a Right to the same, and may hope for the
speedier Relief; and whosoever accounts it good Husbandry to save
the Nation's Revenues, by rendring His Majesty's Service grievous,
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
and oppressing the Poor: I cannot believe it will be so esteemed by
the Sage and most August Assembly the great Council of the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4. That if the Queries are all taken off now, they must be
renewed in case of another War.</P>
<P><HI>Answer:</HI> To ground this <HI>Objection,</HI> three things must be presup∣posed,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That great Sickness and Mortality must attend such succeed∣ing
War, as did the late (which God forbid.)</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Seamen must be as evily treated, and badly paid,
(the contrary whereof I hope.)</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the Queries will be of advantage to His Majesty's
Service; which I conceive will appear to be otherwise, as well by
what's already hinted, as that which doth ensue; and if so, then there
is no ground for this Objection; for if the Number of the Sick be
small, they may be spared; if they be well treated, duly encourag'd, and
frequently paid, they will voluntarily return to the Service; and if
the Queries have only been a Grievance in time past, it cannot reason∣ably
be expected they should be otherwise in time to come.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 5. That if the Queries should all be taken off, it would be
an Innovation and Breach of the Rules and Discipline of the Navy, and
tend to the overthrowing of the same.</P>
<P><HI>Answer:</HI> I must confess this <HI>Objection</HI> seems to have great weight;
for if the Discipline of the Navy (wherein our Safety so much de∣pends)
should be destroy'd, the Loss would be irrepairable for the
Reasons aforementioned.</P>
<P>But as that was never design'd, so it could not be the Effect of
this Undertaking, which was only intended for the Consideration of
the Honourable House of Commons; who I doubt not, if the same
should ever be thought worthy their Inspection, would see just Cause
to regulate the present Discipline of the Navy, for regaining the
Credit thereof, and rebuilding the decayed Walls of the Nation (the
Naval Force I mean) which were the only things desired.</P>
<P>And as a further Answer to this <HI>Objection,</HI> I shall give some few of
many Particulars, wherein the Persons principally concerned, in mak∣ing
and continuing those Queries, have fail'd in their Duties, and de∣viated
from the the Rules and Discipline of the Navy.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the making the Queries is contrary to the antient Dis∣cipline
of the Navy, is evident from what is before mentioned: for
until the latter end of the Year 1690, <HI>every Man who before that time
was set on shoar sick, was thereby discharg'd from the Service, and be∣fore
the late War, his Wages immediately paid (without waiting for the
Payment of the Ship:</HI>) And as for the continuing of the Queries; the
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
Practise, during the late War, was not any-wise coherent with the
Orders, Instructions, or Intentions for making of them. For Example.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The intent of the Queries according to the express Terms of
the Instructions was, as aforesaid; <HI>That when any Person was recove∣red
from his Sickness, he should be received on Board any of His Ma∣jesty's
Ships, if the Ship to which he belonged were not present, and to
continue there until he could be put on Board his proper Ship, and no
longer; but the Methods taken, have so far differed from the same,
that when any Ships have been in Port, and bound to the</HI> West-Indies, <HI>or
other foreign Voyages,</HI> they have taken out of the Hospitals, and sick
Quarters, all such Men as were able to go on board, (and many of
them not half recover'd,) although they belong'd to other Ships (a
ready way to return them, to their Long Homes, I mean,) and may be
justly suspected one of the greatest Causes of the Sickness and Mor∣tality
that happen'd in the Fleet. For Instance: <HI>The</HI> Chester, <HI>when
bound for the</HI> West Indies, <HI>took out of the Hospital at</HI> Plymouth, <HI>all
the Men that were in any measure recover'd, and divers in a weak Con∣dition,
which when the Chyrurgeon of the Hospital was charged with, he
could n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t deny; so that by this means divers People have lost, not on∣ly
their Relations, but also the Wages due for their Service, as well
in the Ships out of which they were set sick on shoar, as for those into
which they have been taken or imprest, their said Friends not being able
to give any ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>unt thereof, which is required of them.</HI> For Instance,
Humphrey Minterne, <HI>who was set on shoar sick at</HI> Plymouth, <HI>from
His Majesty's Ship the</HI> Portsmouth, <HI>in</HI> July 92, <HI>and as his Friends were
informed, died there; but by reason they cannot prove the same, al∣though
they never since heard of him, his Wages is re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us'd to be paid;
which must be occasion'd by his being taken, or put on Board some other
Ship in the manner aforesaid.</HI> I might instance <HI>James Bourge</HI> in the
Royal <HI>Katharine, &amp;c.</HI> but this may suffice for Information.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Commanders did in no wise comply with their In∣structions,
for holding a Correspondence with the Commissioners for
sick and wounded Seamen, but wholly neglected the same; so that in∣stead
of making a right discharge of the sick Men, they remain'd Q'd,
and would all continue so till Dooms day, did not some few by
Friends, Monies, great Expence, and long Attendance, get their Que∣ries
removed.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Commissioners for sick and wounded Seamen, and
their Agents, have also fail'd, and not comply'd with the said Orders,
and Instructions, not only in neglecting the said Correspondence with
the Commanders, but in omitting to note, in what Condition, whi∣ther,
or to what Ship they discharged the sick Men, and also in not
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
giving them the Conduct-Monies appointed for them, as may appear
by an Instance or two, of hundreds that might be given, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Bearer <HI>William Bigger,</HI> belonging to His Majesty's Ship, Prince
of <HI>Orange,</HI> was sent to this place sick upon the 12th day of <HI>June</HI> 94,
and being cured, was discharg'd the 4th of <HI>July</HI> 94 (but not said whi∣ther:)
The Truth whereof is certified, he hath received in Cloaths to
the value of 00—00—00; and in Conduct Money 00—00—00.</P>
<P>By <HI>John Curcey,</HI> Chyrurgeon,
appointed to take care of sick and
wounded Seamen, at <HI>Ply∣mouth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> The Bearer <HI>William Parker,</HI> belonging to their Majesty's
Ship the <HI>Dutchess,</HI> was sent to this place sick upon the first Day of <HI>Ju∣ly</HI>
93, and being cured, was discharg'd hence upon the 15th day of <HI>Ju∣ly</HI>
93. The Truth hereof is certified,</P>
<P>To travel to the abovesaid Ship at <HI>Torbay.</HI>
He hath receiv'd in Cloaths to the value of
0—0—0. In Conduct Money 0—0—0.</P>
<P>per <HI>George Dickinson,</HI>
appointed to take care
of sick and hurt Sea∣men,
at <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>
<P>So that having no Conduct Money, or any of his own (he must beg,
steal, or sell his Cloaths, if he hath any,) to travel many Miles
to seek his Ship, that might perhaps have been sailed from the place
to which he was directed, before he was discharg'd; as in the Case
of <HI>Richard Lewis,</HI> who was discharg'd from sick Quarters to go to
his Ship the <HI>Ipswich,</HI> 10 days after she was sail'd to the <HI>Streights.</HI> One
Instance more since the Peace concluded, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>These are to certify, That the Bearer <HI>William Haynes,</HI> belonging
to His Majesty<HI>'s</HI> Ship <HI>Kingston,</HI> was sent to this place, upon the 24th day
of <HI>November</HI> 1697, and being cured, was discharg'd hence this <HI>20th</HI>
day of <HI>December</HI> 97, to go forthwith to</P>
<P>He has receiv'd in Cloaths to the value of 0—0—0
and in Conduct Money—0—0—0
Witness my hand this <HI>20th</HI> day of
<HI>December</HI> 1697; by <HI>Peter Le∣vermore,</HI>
appointed to take care
of sick and hurt <HI>Seamen,</HI> at
<HI>Godsport.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23"/>
Of the like Instances hundreds might be given: But hereby it may ap∣pear,
That these Persons have been discharged without their Conduct-Money,
or Direction to any Port, or any Ship, and generally with
little besides Rags to their Backs; or as the Sailors term it, a <HI>Neapo∣litan
Chest,</HI> being a Stocking full of Cloaths, (and well 'tis no bigger
to travel with, in such a Condition, from the remotest part of the
Kingdom;) as a true Tar, <HI>more Rags than Manners;</HI> being thus ac∣coutered,
he must troop (a Scanderoon March, with one Shoe and
one Stocking, and neither worth a Farthing) through the Kingdom,
to seek his Fortune, and unless he can prove by good Testimony, that
he could not meet with his own Ship, and that he enter'd on board
some other of His Majesty's Ships, within one Month at the most,
whether the Captain would receive him or not, his Query must
not be taken off.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy, or their Clerks,
or both, have deviated from the said Instructions, for establishing the
Queries.</P>
<P>1st. In accounting many thousands to be Queried, whom the Cap∣tains
(who alone were to make those Queries) had discharg'd without
a Query, Some by Tickets for their Wages, Others without, noting
only the Dss against their Names, as aforesaid, and sometimes noting
on the Book the Infirmities for which they were discharg'd, as Lame
Blind, Bursten, Decripped, and the like; yet those as well as all o∣thers
that were discharg'd sick, were accounted Queried, contrary to the
very intent of the same. The which, when Sir <HI>Richard Haddock</HI> was
first inform'd of, being in the year 95, and above 4 years after the Que∣ries
were made (this Practice being then introduc'd) He profest with
a great surprize at the Publick Pay; <HI>That although he had been Comp∣troler
of the Navy above 16 years, he was a Stranger to the Rules of
the same, and never knew a Dss accounted a Query before.</HI></P>
<P>2dly. They have also deviated from the said Establishment and Disci∣pline,
in neglecting to take off such Queries as they might, and could
have done, by the sick Accounts kept in the same Office. For Instance;
Such Persons as die in sick Quarters, and are noted so to be in
their sick Accounts, yet the Queries remain on the Pay-Books, and
has often obstructed the Payment of the Wages, and this by the neg∣lect
aforesaid; When on the other hand, if any Persons are noted R S
on the said Accounts, They are as sure to find the same inserted on the
Pay-Books, as the Other neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The repeated Orders of the late Right Honourable the
Lords of the Admiralty to the Navy-Board, had that unhappy Effect,
to put an intire stop to the Wages of every Person that had been dis∣charged
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
by reason of Sickness, whether by Ticket, or without, al∣though
they return'd to the respective Ships, out of which they were
put on shoar, or died in sick Quarters, or went on board such Ships as
directed, being all accounted to be Query'd; and those Queries not to
be taken off, without the special order and direction of the Admiral∣ty-Board;
which caused several hundreds to expend great part of their
Monies, in petitioning, and attendance, to take off these imaginary
Queries, which were before answered in themselves: Of which an In∣stance
or two, for Information.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John Wilkinson</HI> enter'd-on board the <HI>Expedition</HI> the first day of
<HI>October</HI> 1693, and was discharg'd the 26th day of <HI>December</HI> 1697▪ by
reason of Sickness; and the Captain and Officers of the Ship sign'd a
Ticket for his Wages: yet this Person, notwithstanding his said Tic∣ket,
was accounted Queried, and the Wages remains yet unpaid.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Richard Draper,</HI> who serv'd in His Majesty's Ship <HI>Winchelsea,</HI>
about 3 years, was, after he had been on Board about 22 Months ta∣ken
sick, and put on shoar for his Recovery; and when recover'd, re∣turn'd
on board the same Ship, where he continued about 12 Months,
and was then discharg'd by order of the Admiralty, and had one Ticket
made out for his Service, from the last Entry, and another for the time
he serv'd before he was set sick on shoar: But at the Payment of the
said Ship, which was at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and (no other Ship paid there, at
that time) his Wages for the 22 Months before he was set on shoar
sick, was refus'd to be paid, being accounted Query'd, notwithstand∣ing
the Ticket made out, and his returning aboard the same Ship, as
soon as recover'd, yet the 12 Months Pay only could be receiv'd for
the last time; and that which was due for the 22 Months Service,
to the time he was set on shoar sick, remains unpaid.</P>
<P>3. <HI>John Body</HI> serv'd on board His Majesty's Ship <HI>Germoone Prize,</HI>
from the 7th day of <HI>October</HI> 1696, to the 15th day of <HI>January</HI> 1696,
at which time he was set on shoar sick; and when recover'd, (being
in one Months time, or little more, from his discharge,) returned on
board the same Ship again, and had a Ticket made out for his first
Service; and in six Weeks after, or thereabouts, was slain on Board
the said Ship; yet at the Payment of the Ship, at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> the
Wages to the time he was put on shoar sick, was refus'd to be paid,
being accounted Queried, and about 30 Shillings only that was due
for the latter Service was paid.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Stephen Forgen</HI> was set on shoar sick from the <HI>Monmouth,</HI> at <HI>God∣sport,</HI>
in, or about <HI>April</HI> 98, and the Ship being sailed, and he con∣tinuing
very ill, desired to be discharg'd from Quarters, to go to <HI>Ips∣wich,</HI>
the Place of his Habitation; which having obtain'd, did get
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
Passage home, where he continued in a weak and deplorable Condi∣tion,
as was amply certified by the Bayliffs, Minister, and Church-Wardens
of the Place, and also that he had a Wife, and 5 small
Children relieved by the Alms of the Parish, yet his Query was re∣fus'd
to be taken off; but on a second Certificate (to the same purpose)
and Application to the Navy Board, his Query is since taken off.</P>
<P>I might instance <HI>Simon Lewis,</HI> who was set on shoar sick, since the
Peace concluded, and discharged to go on board the same Ship, which
was sailed for the <HI>Straights</HI> 10 days before his Discharge, and all the
Ships in Harbour lying up at great Charge, had Orders to clear all the
Men that desired it, to ease His Majesty of the Charge, and not to
enter any Men; yet his Query is refus'd to be taken off, until he can
prove he endeavour'd to enter himself; but this Practice beng univer∣sally
known to those concerned in the Navy, I shall add no more:</P>
<P>But proceed to the R's, as another Obstruction to the Seamen's
voluntary entring themselves into the Service: Which R's, as be∣fore
is shew'd, denotes a Man to be Run from the Service; but
being a Letter of long Continuance, I shall the more particularly
shew wherein the same, as now practis'd, is a Hardship to the Seamen,
and all concerned with them, and an Obstruction to their voluntarily
entering themselves, and of great Prejudice to the Credit of the Na∣vy:
yet many believing the Preservation of the Naval Discipline, in
an especial manner, depends thereon; I must beg Pardon if I dissent
from them in this Particular (for the Reasons following:) And many
worthy Gentlemen with whom I have had the Honour to converse
are clearly or Opinion, <HI>That it is not evil Example, severe Treat∣ment,
cruel Punishment, and want of Pay, but sober Command,
prudent Lenity, and reasonable Encouragment, will most conduce to
the maintaining of a good Discipline in the Navy.</HI></P>
<P>But as for the R's, those that are mark'd with the same, in the Navy-Books,
by what Occasion or Accident soever it happens, are now liable
to lose and forfeit all their Wages (how much, and for how many
Ships soever it is due and unpaid) and altho Tickets are made out for the
same, and those often sold, or transfer'd to others, long before they were
thus made run or forfeited: but indeed by an Act, made in the <HI>13th</HI> of
<HI>Charles</HI> the Second, <HI>Chap 12. Art.</HI> the 17th. were liable to be punish'd
with Death. The Words thus, <HI>viz.</HI> “All Sea Captains and Officers,
or Mariners, that shall desert the Service, or their Imployment in the
Ships, or shall run away, or entice any others so to do, shall be pu∣nish'd
with Death.” Which Clause hath been put in Execution a∣gainst
divers who deserted, during the late War, many being punish'd
with Death for the same; as <HI>Wilkinson, Hall, Stone,</HI> and divers o∣thers:
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
But how far this deterred others from Desertion, may
appear by the many thousand R's that remain on the Navy-Books;
which, as was observed, by the Admiralty and Navy-Boards, are so
numerous, and the Sea-Books of the Navy so voluminous, that no cer∣tain
account thereof can be given; and indeed is not to be wondred at,
if we consider, not only the foregoing Circumstances, with respect to
their ill Treatment, Punishment, Turning over from Ship to Ship, and
want of Pay, being put on Board Prizes, lent to help Merchant Ships
into Port, having leave to go on shoar, being taken Sick, Imprison'd,
Imprest by other Ship's Companies (who always esteem them good
Purchase when caught) the Ships suddain Sailing, and many other Ac∣cidents
of the like nature which occasions the same. But wherein the
present Practise of these R's differs from the former, and wherein the
Hardship of them lyes, I shall endeavour to describe, not only by those
and other Causes of them, but also in the Difficulty of removing them.</P>
<P>That which occasions the vast Numbers of R's now more than for∣merly,
appears in a great degree from what is before mentioned,
and will be more clear, if we compare the late with the former
Discipline of the Navy. The former Practice, as is acknow∣ledg'd,
was to pay off the great Ships every year, the small
ones at the end of every Voyage, and to leave no Recalls, seldom
to turn Men over, and never to lend them to other Ships (except
Merchant-men, and to them only in case of Distress;) to pay
Tickets as soon as they were made out; and one Ship's Company not
to impress those that belonged to other Ships, who were a-shoar, ei∣ther
by leave from the Officers, or on any other occasions; with other
Accidents too numerous here to insert. From every Particular where∣of,
the Practice of the Navy, during the late War, as well as the
present Practice greatly differs, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>In that they have been kept 6 or 7 years unpaid, and the major
part of the Men left to Recalls. Their being turned over from one
Ship to a Second, from thence to a third, or fourth, in 3 or 4 Months
time, being discharg'd from the Service, <HI>per</HI> Ticket, without their
Wages, and have been, accounted Runn in all the Ships they have ser∣ved,
and their Tickets and Wages that remain'd unpaid, forfeited:
their having leave to be on shoar, have been arrested, surprized by
Sickness, or left by the Ships sudden and unexpected Sailing; im∣press'd
by other Ship's Companies, and many other Accidents as aforesaid;
which have brought so many thousands under these Circumstances, as the
Honourable the Commissioners of the Navy have acknowledg'd.</P>
<P>2dly. The Difficulty of taking off an R when once made; which,
although I cannot say, as one, who knew not the Seamen's Case, did,
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
<HI>That the</HI> R's <HI>are like the Laws of the</HI> Medes <HI>and</HI> Persians, <HI>unaltera∣ble;</HI>
yet by the strictness of the Navy-Board, with respect to Proof
and Circumstance, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey require; the many Queries put be∣fore
they remove them; and the slender and nice Scruples whereon
they are refus'd, has cocasion'd many hundred Persons (who expected,
and might reasonably hope for Relief, in those Cases, after tedious
Journies, and the Expence of their small Substance in long Attendance)
to return to their Habitations more miserable than they came; it is
therefore no wonder the R's are numerous, and that so few of them
are remov'd. A few Instances may serve for Information.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Richard Whitechurch,</HI> an able Seaman, belonged to His Majesty's
Ship the <HI>Expedition,</HI> from the 16th of <HI>June</HI> 93, to the first of <HI>Febru∣ary</HI>
96, being 40 Months, and 2 days: The Neat-Wages due to him
besides Short Allowance-Money is 39 <HI>l. 16 s. 6 d.</HI> but his Ticket be∣ing
lost by Accident, the Navy-Board granted another, about twenty
Months after his Discharge from the said Ship: But at the Payment
of the <HI>Expedition,</HI> in <HI>December</HI> 98, his Wages was refus'd, it being
said he run from the <HI>Sunderland</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies:</HI> But as I am in∣form'd
was accidently left on a French Island.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John Carpenter</HI> and <HI>Richard Jane,</HI> both able Seamen, served on
board His Majesty's Ship the <HI>Royal Oak,</HI> from the 14th of <HI>January</HI>
1692, to the 3d of <HI>April</HI> 1697; and the <HI>Oak</HI> being then laid up at
<HI>Portsmouth,</HI> in order to be paid; they were discharged by Tickets, and
put on board the <HI>Rainbow Prize,</HI> which was bound to <HI>Ireland;</HI> and
that Ship putting into <HI>Falmouth;</HI> the Captain gave the said <HI>Carpenter</HI>
and <HI>Jane,</HI> leave to visit their Friends, who lived near <HI>Padstow;</HI> they
having been long absent from them; but the Ship sailing suddenly,
they were left behind, and therefore made Run; which is certified by the
Captain of the <HI>Rainbow Prize.</HI> And further, That he had a good Cha∣racter
of them, from their former Commander, and did believe they had
no design to desert the Service; yet their R's are refus'd to be taken
off, and the Persons required to appear themselves; and in case they
should comply with the said Orders, it is very probable, having no bet∣ter
Reasons to offer for the taking off their R's, than what have
already been offered, in their Behalfs, they will be obliged to return
with the like Answer, as many Hundreds have done, <HI>that they cannot
be relieved.</HI></P>
<P>3. The Company of the <HI>Coronation</HI> (hired Ship) which came from
the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> were generally ordered on board the <HI>Reserve</HI> (as I
remember) to return to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> again; but by reason of the Hard∣ship
of the Voyage, and as they alledg'd, the unkindness of the Comman∣der,
were unwilling to go, but went in general on Board others of His
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
Majesty's Ships, for which they were all made Run, and not those
only, but several whom the Captain had discharged by Ticket, and were
gone before the said Order; some of which Tickets were afterwards
paid to the Relations, or pretended ones, but others under the same
Circumstances refused.</P>
<P>4. <HI>John Searle,</HI> who was Boatswain's-Mate, of His Majesty's Ship
the <HI>England Frigot,</HI> when sunk in a Fight With the Freneh, was noted
to be run to the French Service, and his Wages for that reason refused
to be paid; but soon after returned to <HI>England,</HI> and petitioned the Na∣vy-Board
to be relieved; He was answered with a Query; <HI>how, and
by whom he was noted to be R.</HI> Which Query being impossible for him
to answer, his R cou'd not be taken off. Many hundred Instances of
such Natures might be given; but hope these will suffice. And
I shall now briefly touch on some of the Inconveniencies that have
attended the making Tickets Run.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> This Practice, has not only greatly reduced the Credit of the
Navy, but also seems apparently contrary to the former Discipline
thereof, and I humbly conceive, is destructive to the very end and
intent of granting them. That the Credit of the Navy is hereby re∣duced,
is manifest, in that when Tickets (as formerly they) were
esteemed, and punctually paid as the Kings Bonds, of Bills of Ex∣change,
within few days after produced to the Comptroler, and Pay master
of the Navy: Certain Sums being appointed weekly for that
purpose. The Bankers in <HI>Lombard street</HI> have discounted them (as I
have been informed) at <HI>6d. per</HI> Pound Loss, a great Disproportion to
10 or 12 <HI>s.</HI> at which discount they have lately been: And if Wages
be demanded at this time, where Tickets are made out, and the Tic∣kets
not produced, the Comptroler of the Pay frequently answers,
<HI>that the Money cannot be paid, because the King's Bonds are out stand∣ing,</HI>
(meaning the Tickets.)</P>
<P>And that this is destructive to the end of granting Tickets,
appears by the Captains Instructions given them, even to this
time, for making them out, (<HI>viz.) Article</HI> 18 of the New Instrucs∣ctions,
and 15 of the Old.</P>
<P>Thus; “You are to be very careful, not to discharge Men by
Ticket unnecessarily: The intent of that Practice, being principally
for sick Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>” And <HI>Article</HI> 24 New, and 18 Old; “You are
not to sign any Ticket upon discharge of any of your Men, but
such as shall be printed Tickets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor that upon any pretence
whatsoever any Ticket be made out, before the Person for whom
the same is made, be actually discharg'd, and the said Person, or
some other, lawfully impower'd to demand the same.”</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29"/>
If therefore Tickets were principally designed for sick Men, and
those (until the Order aforesaid) were ever accounted for that reason
to be discharged from the Service, and no Ticket to be made out for
any Person until actually discharged; and when they were made out,
such Person, or any other lawfully impower'd by him, might demand
the same; and that such Tickets were formerly paid immediately af∣ter
produced, to the Comptroler and Pay-master of the Navy, as
aforesaid; it seems as great a Mystery, as unreasonable, that they
can, or shou'd be Forfeited, or made Run for future Desertion. I shall
only add to what is aforesaid, as further Motives to take off the Q's
and R's, as far as the same appear to be Hardships, the Reasons for∣merly
given for that purpose.</P>
<P>First, To take off the Q's; 'Tis the Labourers Hire, and their Fami∣lies
Bread, and their Poverty, Indigency, and Misery pleads for Relief.</P>
<P>2. That those Q's are of late Invention (<HI>viz.</HI>) in the Year 1690,
and occasion'd by the great Sickness and Mortality that then reigned
in the Fleet, which should rather be a motive to take them off.</P>
<P>3. Many of the Persons at first put on shoar were ignorant of those
new Rules, and therefore did not return, and others have been set on
shoar several times, thereby creating great charge, and tending to the
prejudice of the Service, but was of no advantage to the same.</P>
<P>4. Many contracted their Sickness in foreign Voyages, and conti∣nued
long sick on board, before they could be set on shoar, and many
of their Consorts were buried; they have therefore dreaded to return,
when a little recovered, for fear of a Relapse.</P>
<P>5. Many have been set on shoar in a very deplorable Condition;
some whereof, as I have been credibly informed, died in the Streets;
others, immediately after they came into sick Quarters; some have
been Imprest, and hurried on Board other Ships before half recovered;
and most of them rendered incapable to return on Board their proper
Ships, by reason of the Ships sailing before they recover'd, as well as
for want of Conduct-Money, to support them to the places where di∣rected;
for which reason they have been obliged to expend great part
of their Wages, and sell their Cloaths for Subsistance.</P>
<P>6. That it was not likely those whose Sickness was so great, as to
engage their Officers to put them on shoar, could be so well recovered
in strength, especially to return on board in so short a time as required.</P>
<P>7. That the said Wages was with Difficulty, and hard Labour duly
earned; that the Charge, Expence, and Fatigue to the Petitioners, and
Trouble to the Offices, and both Houses of Parliament, have been very
great: To the first, by the extravagant Exactions of those that preten∣ded
to sollicite their Business, and by their long Attendance: To the
other, by the Clamourous Tumults of Petitioners.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="30"/>
8. They having faithfully served His Majesty to the impairing of
their Healths, and hazard of their Lives, and the Nation having pro∣vided
sutable Funds for the Payment of their Wages, it seems not
only just and reasonable, but also for the Honour of His Majesty, and
Credit of his Service, to take off those Q's, and pay the Wages so
hardly earned. To which I shall only add one Query made by a Noble
Lord who was present when this matter was under consideration of the
Admirality and Navy-Boards <HI>viz. By what Law such Wages was
stopt</HI> (a Question I believ'd) not proper for me to ask, nor do I
remember it was then answered.</P>
<P>But I shall proceed, and hint some few of many Reasons or Mo∣tives
that might be given, for taking off the R's, as followeth, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>1. That such as have Tickets delivered them, seems, in the Eye of
Justice, to have a good Title to their Wages.</P>
<P>2. Those Tickets are, and have been esteemed, as the Kings Bonds
or Bills of Exchange, and were formerly paid at sight, or soon after
produced.</P>
<P>3. Many well affected People, for promoting His Majesty's Ser∣vice,
and in Charity to their distressed Neighbonrs, have supplied
them to the value of their Tickets.</P>
<P>4. The making such Tickets Run, has unspeakably reduced the Cre∣dit
of the Navy, with respect to Wages; insomuch, that Tickets
which were formerly discounted, as aforesaid, at 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound, and
few Years since, at 2 <HI>s.</HI> and 2 <HI>s. 6 d. per</HI> Pound, have of late been
sold for less than one half of their Value.</P>
<P>5. That such Tickets, had not Money been wanting, would have
been paid long before they became forfeited.</P>
<P>6. The Tickets and Wages due by them, has been assigned to others
long before such Forfeiture, which I conceive, invests the Assignee
with an equitable Right (at least) to the Money.</P>
<P>7. It is to be feared, these Hardships has caused many Seamen to
desert the Nation, and either turn Pyrats, or serve Foreigners.</P>
<P>Indeed the main Objection against taking off these R's still remains,
that is, notwithstanding the strickness (I may say Severity) of the
Q's and R's, many hundreds do desert the Service, and were it not for
forfeiting their Wages, (as the Admirality and Navy-Boards have ob∣served)
but few, except Officers, would remain therein. I must confess
this is in some measure true; but if we consider the occasion thereof,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the Hardships aforementioned, I may say with Assurance (accord∣ing
to the true Maxim) <HI>Take away the Cause, and the Effect will cease:</HI>
For in case the Seamen are kindly treated, duly encouraged, well and
frequently paid, as afore-hinted, and have sometimes Liberty to visit
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
their Relations and Families, His Majesty's Service will no longer be
accounted a Slavish Confinement, but as a pleasant and profitable Cal∣ling,
to which the Seamen will apply themselves with chearfulness,
for the Support of their Families; most of whom, by reason of
the many Grievances aforesaid, during the late War, were relieved by
the Charity of others.</P>
<P>Indeed it has been remarked by a Gentleman, (supposed to relate
to the Admiralty,) in a small Treatie, Entituled, <HI>Remarks on a Pam∣phlet
touching the Navy and Victualling</HI> &amp;c. as a Matter of great Le∣nity,
That in 6 Months time, that Honourable Board relieved 750 of
1700 Persons who petitioned; of which 750, as I am informed,
above 500 were relieved from Q's only, and not R's; and most of
those were such, whose Circumstances were within the Limits of the
following Order (<HI>viz.</HI>) those who either died in sick Quarters, or the
Hospitals, or returned on Board their proper Ships within one Month
after Recovery, or to some other of His Majesty's Ships, if their own
were not in the way, or were discharged by Ticket unfit for Service.
Now I humbly conceive, there being no real Occasion to put any
Queries on them, it appearing where they were at the same time; it
had savoured more of Justice than Kindness, not to have given them
the Trouble, Charge, and Fatigue of Petitioning, and attending from
Office to Office, until the greatest part of the Wages due, has been
expended, before they could be relieved, or those supposed Queries
taken off; as may appear, not only by the Cases of <HI>John Wilkinson</HI>
and <HI>Richard Draper, &amp;c.</HI> but also by the Right Honourable the Lords
of the Admiralties Order to the Navy-Board, in answer to my Ad∣dress
in <HI>February</HI> 169<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-99, which Order I shall not incert, but only
take notice of the Circumstances of those intended by the said Order
to be reliev'd, as far as I can remember, in their Lordships Terms.</P>
<P>1. “You shall take off the Q's and R's from all Men that have
been set sick on shoar, and died in sick Quarters, or being removed
thence to the Hospital, have died there; as also those as have been
put sick on Board Hospital-Ships, and died there.”</P>
<P>2. “From all Men set sick on shoar since the Peace, from Ships
under Orders to be paid off, and laid up, and could not be re-enter'd
on Board the said Ships,” after their Discharge from sick
Quarters, or the Hospitals.</P>
<P>3. “From all Men that have been set on shoar sick, and discharged
either from sick Quarters, or the Hospitals, unfit for His Majes∣ty's
Service.”</P>
<P>4. “From all Men that have been set sick on shoar, and after the
Expiration of their Month, or within 20 days after, were willing to
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
return to the Ships to which they belong'd, or to some other of His
Majesty's Ships, if their proper Ships were not in the way.”</P>
<P>5. “And from all Men discharged by Tickets without any demur
in them.”</P>
<P>Before which Order, the Wages of all Persons under the aforesaid
Circumstances were denied, until by Petition an Order cou'd be
obtained for removing of those supposed Q's and R's.</P>
<P>Now if all Men that did die in sick Quarters, or the Hospitals, or
Hospital-Ships, or were set sick on shoar from such Ships as were or∣der'd
to be paid off, and could not re-enter them (but on the contrary,
had Orders to discharge as many as desired it;) And if they that were
discharged from the Hospitals, or sick Quarters, unfit for Service, or by
their Officers, by Tickets for the same Reason, or if they returned to
their proper Ships, or some other of His Majesty's Ships, if their pro∣per
Ships were not in the way: If all these should bs as they then
were supposed to be Queried; And if those Queries were not answered
by the proper Officers, which is their Duty, but ever was, and I fear
still is wholly neglected. And had not that Order been obtained, the
1700 Complainants would soon have encreased to 17000, and the
Clamours and Tumults of the Oppressed Petirioners been intolerable.
This I hope may suffice to evidence the Hardships and Inconveniencies
of the Queries.</P>
<P>The aforesaid Author also suggests, in the said Treatise, That many
Embelishments have been added to the Navy, since the beginning of
the late War, but mentions not one: And I hope he doth not intend
the frequent turning Men over from a first, to a second, third, or fourth
Ship, in few Months (by which some that have been Master's-Mates,
as well as other Officers on Board such Ships as they were turned out
of, have been reduced to the meanest Stations, or Fore-mast Men's
Wages on Board others) nor lending them to other Ships, bearing
them by Lift two or three Months, or more, and allowing them no
Wages for their Service, lessening their Pay, depriving them of their
Prize-Money, keeping them seven, eight, or nine Years without their
Wages, preferring ignorant Favourites to Offices, and Employments
of Profit, before ingenious Seamen, to whom the same have been pro∣mised,
and who at the same time are obliged to do the others Duty,
in the said Employments, tho they receive the Wages; nor the cruel
Whipping and Pickling of the Seamen, putting such Q's on them as
aforesaid, and making their Tickets Run, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If these, with a new
invented one, of paying Short-Allowance-Money two or three Months
after, and one or two hundred Miles from the place where the Wages
were paid, (by which means many of the Parties are deprived of their
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
Right.) If these are the Imbellishments intended, I conceive it's
those, and only those, that have given such great Disgust to our Sea∣men,
and prevented their Voluntary Entring into the Service; the
which as it has been in times past, (unless it be prevented,) is like
to continue a Hardship to the Seamen, and a Burthen to the Nation,
and the only Occasion of putting the Government to that inconvenient,
delatory, troublesome, and chargeable Method of Impressing. Some
of the Inconveniences and Disadvantages that attend the same, I shall
briefly hint (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing the Inconveniencies and Disadvantages of Impressing.</HEAD>
<P>1. THE Charge; and that consists partly in the Freight, Wages,
and Provisions of the Vessels that are hired to Impress, and
their Companies, which is computed by the Honoured Commissioner
<HI>Geo.</HI> St. <HI>Loe,</HI> at 60000 Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI> Fol. (38) of his Book,
Entituled, <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Safety, or a Bridle for the French King.</HI></P>
<P>2. The Charge of the Press-Gangs which are generally composed
of several Officers, and 14 or 16 of the best Men, whose Wages and
Provisions, I conceive, cannot reasonably be esteemed less than the
Charge of the Impress-Vessels; these being more than double their
Number, and for that Reason exceed their Charge, the Freight in∣cluded.</P>
<P>3. The Wages and Provisions of the Volunteers and Imprest Men,
who are generally 2 or 3 Months, and oftentimes more from some pla∣ces
in Victuals and Pay (and many in that time desert) before they
come to the Ships, for which they are entered, which is also a great
Charge to the Nation; and as some have observed and calculated, it
has sometimes cost the Government 8 or 10 <HI>l.</HI> a Man, for those that
have been impressed.</P>
<P>4. Another Inconveniency and Charge that attends this Method, is
the Absence of so many of the Officers and ablest Seamen several
Months, the Equipment, and fitting the Ships for the Sea, being
retarded thereby, and many of the Ships not fully Mann'd until <HI>May</HI>
or <HI>June</HI> (and sometimes not the whole Summer) which in the late
War gave the Enemy the Advantage of having their Fleet at Sea be∣fore
ours; and to prevent the same, our Great Ships have some∣times
been kept in Pay the whole Winter, and generally commission∣ed
and ordered to enter Men in <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January.</HI> The Extra∣ordinary
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
Charge whereof, I conceive, cannot be less to the Govern∣ment
than 300000 Pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI> For Example, Suppose the
Charge of the Navy for one year, allowing 40000 Men to be sufficient
for that Service, is 2118500 Pounds, according to the Estimate given
the Honourable House of Commons, for the Year 1697, at 4 <HI>l. 5 s.
per</HI> Man, <HI>per</HI> Month, for 13 Months; Now if 13 first and second Rate
Ships, having 8500 Men, and 27 third Rates, having 12150 Men,
and 30 fourth Rates, having 5700 Men; being in the whole 26000
Men, as may be computed by the List, Page the 3 <HI>d.</HI> besides Fir-Ships,
Tenders, Bomb-Vessels <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If those Ships were paid off in <HI>October,</HI>
and the Men not kept in Pay, (as they sometimes have been the
whole Winter,) the Charge for 3 Months only secured, <HI>viz.</HI> from the
1st of <HI>November</HI> to the 1st of <HI>February,</HI> the aforesaid allowance for
so many Men for that time being more then 301500 Pounds, (but
computed by Commissioner St. <HI>Loe,</HI> at more than 500000 <HI>l.</HI>) might
be saved to the Nation on that Account, the Ware and Tare as well
as the Wages and Provisions being also saved, and the Officers and
their Servants that continue on Board, not being included in the said
Number: And there would remain as a Winter-Guard, and for foreign
Service 14000 Men, which would compleatly Man twelve Third,
twenty Fourth, twenty Fifth, and twenty Sixth Rate Ships; (as by
the Estimate of their Complement in the Table, <HI>page</HI> 3,) or such
Number of each Rate, as the Government might see occasion to dis∣pose
them. But my design being not to magnify the Disadvantages
that will attend the present Discipline of the Navy, nor the Advant∣ages
that I hope will accrue by the Alteration of the same: Shall
suppose that only 250000 Pounds of the said Sum be saved; this added
to the Charge of Impressing, and Bounty-Money, given to Volunteers
for entring, with Impress-Money allowed the Captains, according to
the Rates of their Ships, for their Expence, and with the Victuals and
Wages to Press-Gangs, whilst absent from the Ships, supposing it only
50000 Pounds; it will be at least 300000 Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> which
may with ease be saved, and the Subjects freed from many other In∣conveniencies
that attended the late Manner of Impressing. But to
proceed.</P>
<P>5. Another Inconveniency, is the frequent Riots, Tumults, and
Quarrels, that happened as well amongst the Press-Gangs (in Cut∣ting,
Hewing, and Knocking down each other)▪ as with the Water-men,
Barge-men, Citizens, and others, whereby the King's Peace has
frequently been broken, and several Press-Gangs, with their Officers,
taken into Custody for the same, and bound over to the Sessions, and
sometimes Murthers committed (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Cooper at <HI>Bayly</HI>'s Place,
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
and as I have heard, several Barge-men above Bridge drowned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
to the Scandal and Prejudice of His Majesty's Service, and the great
Discouragement of many faithful Subjects, who would other wise
have entered themselves on Board the Ships of War.</P>
<P>6. By this Method many poor Tradesmen have been impressed, and
their Servants also violently taken from them to their utter ruin, and
have been driven from their Families like Dogs, or the worst of Cri∣minals,
without Apparel to shift them; and when brought on Board,
by reason of their Ignorance, Discontent, Sloth, and want of Apparel,
became diseas'd and noysom, and was in all probability, one principal
Occasion of the Sickness in the Navy; many of whom after 2 or 3
Months Sickness on Board, have been set on shoar several times, and
maintained at His Majesty's Charge, and others run away; and those
that remained were of little use, save only to eat the Kings Provision,
and add to the Nation's Charge. So that the great Charge the Go∣vernment
has been at for Impressing on Shoar, has been of little other
Advantage, than giving Opportunity to some needy Press-Masters, to
take Monies For protecting those who were most capable to serve, and
clearing others whom they had no Authority to Impress; and to save
their Credit, and get the 20 <HI>s. per</HI> Man, lately given, have sent some
on Board, who being such as aforementioned, were in no wise <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for
the Service; divers of whom, when carried on Board, have been
turned on shoar again, many Miles from their Habitations, with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t
any Consideration for the Loss of their Time, or Monies to carry th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
back to their Families.</P>
<P>7. Besides these Disadvantages that immediately concern the Go∣vernment▪
by this Method of Impressing, the Prejudice is very great
to Trade in general, but especially to this City of <HI>London,</HI> and the
Sea-Ports where the Ships of War are laid up. A brief Instance
whereof may serve for Information, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>February</HI> 1700-01, Coals were in this City at 22 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI> or 23 <HI>s. per</HI>
Chaldorn, and Men's Wages to <HI>New-Castle</HI> at 30 <HI>s. per</HI> Voyage; but
by reason of the Press in <HI>March</HI> following, Coals were raised to 37 <HI>s.</HI>
and 38 <HI>s. per</HI> Chaldron, and Men's Wages to 4 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI> or 5 <HI>l. per</HI>
Voyage; and as soon as the said Press was over (<HI>viz.</HI>) in <HI>May,</HI>
Coals were reduced to 21 <HI>s.</HI> or 22 <HI>s. per</HI> Chaldorn, and Men's Wages
proportionable. Now supposing only 16000 Chaldorn of Coals to
be brought to <HI>London,</HI> between <HI>February</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> altho I am in∣formed
there was much more imported, the Loss to this City in that
quantity at 15 <HI>s. per</HI> Chaldorn, the difference of the Price is 12000
Pounds, and yet neither the Masters, nor the Owners of the Ships,
using the Coal-Trade, had any Advantage thereby, most of them being
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
great Losers; and many of them lost their whole Stock, or Ships
Loading: and divers formerly as well Coal Ships, as Merchant men,
being disabled by Impressing their Men, have been in great hazard,
and at great Charge to secure them, and some were intirely lost.</P>
<P>I purposed not to mention any Particular Irregularity of Impres∣sing,
but being importun'd by some worthy Merchants of this City,
and Masters of Ships in the Coal-Trade; I shall briefly relate the
Matter of Fact without mentioning the Persons concerned in it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
It was the Practice of some Lieutenants or Officers that were employed
to Impress in the late Expedition, (altho in the time of Peace) to take
the Boys out of the Colliers, or Coal Ships, and whip them severely,
threaten to <HI>drown</HI> (and otherwise evilly treat) them, to extort a Con∣fession
of the Men supposed to be hid on board, and in Ships where the
Men have been impressed before, the Punishment was the greater: the
Officers still expecting some Confession; of which Practice, divers Ma∣sters
complained to the Lords of the Admiralty, and were directed by
their Lordships to make Oath of the Fact, which they accordingly did:
the Issue I know not, only the Gentlemen concerned, fearing the like
Practice might be continued, and resenting it as a Breach and a high
Violation of the true Liberties of the Subjects of this Realm, desired
it might be published to prevent for the future, the Inconveniencies
that might attend the same; but as well this as divers of the forego∣ing
Grievances, being beyond my purpose, and I fear too burthen∣some
to the Reader, and pleasing to the Enemies of the present Go∣vernment.
I shall cease the Complaint, and humbly propose an
Essay for Redress.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing the Method of Reasons for, and some few of many Advanta∣ges
that will accrue to the Nation in general, by the making perfect
the present Acts for Registring Seamen, &amp;c. as the most probable, if
not the only Means to answer the Ends afore-mentioned.</HEAD>
<P>FOrasmuch as the Strength of the Royal Navy doth not consist
in the Number of Ships only, it is undoubtedly necessary to
have at all Commands, a sufficient Number of able Seamen
ready to man them, and that Encouragement is most likely to engage
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
them to enter, and continue in the Service, is the Judgment of our
most gracious Soveraign, and both Houses of Parliament; evidenced
by the great Care, both of His Majesty, and late Gracious and Royal
Consort of Blessed Memory, to Contribute thereto in a Noble and
Charitable manner; as appears by the perfecting their Pious Intenti∣ons,
in Devoting and Dedicating in most affectionate and pathetical
Expressions, their magnificent and spacious Palace at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> for
a Harbour of Repose to such Mariners, as by the Hazards of the
Wars, and Fatigues of the Seas in Their Majesty's Service for the Na∣tions
Defence, should be maimed, or become impotent and necessitous,
and also to be a Succour to their Families, that they might not labour
under any Hardships. His Majesty's Expressions being so much to the
Seamen's Honour and demonstrating such Affection towards them, I
believe it not amiss to insert the same, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“ Whereas we are extreamly desirous, that the Trade, <HI>Navigation,</HI>
and Naval Strength of this our Realm of <HI>England,</HI> whereupon its
Safety and flourishing State does so much depend, should by all
proper Means be promoted and advanced; and whereas we are per∣swaded,
that nothing will more effectually contribute thereto, than
the endeavouring by due and fitting Encouragement, to encrease the
Number of English Seamen, as well for the strengthning of our
Navy Royal, and better performing the Naval Service of Us Our
Heirs and Successors, as for the supplying and carrying on the Oc∣casions
and Business of our Merchants, and other our loving Sub∣jects,
interested in Trade, Commerce, Fishing, Plantation, Disco∣very,
and other Affairs relating to Navigation. And whereas the
Sea-fairing Men of this Kingdom, have for a long time distinguished
themselves throughout the World by their Industry and Skillfulness
in their proper Imployments; and by their Courage and Constancy,
manifested in Engagements and Hazards for the Defence and Ho∣nour
of their Native Country, and nothing is more likely to con∣tinue
this their Antient Reputation, and to invite greater Numbers
of our Subjects to betake themselves to the Sea, than by making
some Competent Provision that Seamen, who by Age, Wounds, and
other Accidents, shall become disabled for further Service at Sea,
and shall not be in a Condition to maintain themselves comfortably,
may not fall under Hardships, and Miseries, but may be supported at
the Publick Charge; and that the Children of such disabled Sea∣men,
and also the Widows and Children of such Seamen as shall
happen to be slain in the Sea-Service, may in some reasonable man∣ner
be provided for, and educated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereas having frequently
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
reflected upon the Premises since our Accession to the Crown, we
have determined with Our Selves, to Erect and Establish Our Hos∣pital
for the Purpose aforesaid; and although by Reason of the Ex∣pensive
War in which We have been, and are at present engaged;
We have not been able to carry on the said Good and Pious Purposes
to such Effect as We have desired, yet in order to begin to put the
same in Execution, We, and our late most dear Consort the Queen,
did by Our Letters Pattent under Our Great Seal of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>And how far the States of the Nation, <HI>viz.</HI> King, Lords, and Com∣mons
in Parliament Assembled, were affected with the State of the
Navy, and what Care was by them taken, and Provision made for the
Encrease and Encouragement of Seamen, is very evident by the Acts
for Registring of them. The Reasons (by way of Preamble) as
Grounds, and Motives for the said Acts, are as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“Forasmuch as the Strength and Safety of His Majesty's Domini∣ons
do much depend on the supplying His Royal Navy, with a
Competent Number of able Seamen, which may be ready at all
times for that Service.”</P>
<P>“To invite great Numbers of His Majesty's Subjects to betake
themselves to Sea; it is fit some Provision should be made, that
Seamen, who by Age, Wounds, and other Accidents, should be∣come
disabled for future Service at Sea, and shall not be in a Con∣dition
to maintain themselves comfortably, may not fall under Hard∣ships
and Misery, but may be supported at the Publick Charge, and
that the Children of such disabled Seamen; and also the Widows
and Children of such Seamen who shall be slain or drowned in Sea-service,
may in some reasonable manner be provided for: His Majes∣ty,
and Her late Majesty determined, that an Hospital should be
Erected and Endowed for the Purposes aforesaid, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>By this it appears as aforesaid, to be the Judgment of His Majesty,
and the Great Council of the Nation, that Encouragement is the only
Inducement to engage the Seamen to the Service; (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>augre the Opini∣on
of those that would introduce Hardships and Punishments in its
stead.) I shall therefore for the effecting my Purpose, <HI>viz.</HI> demon∣strate
the Facility of manning the Navy at all times, with more Cer∣tainty
and Expedition, yet with less Charge than formerly. First, Give
a short hint of the Immunities and Priviledges granted by the Acts.
<HI>2dly.</HI> Give some few Reasons and Causes, why the said Acts have not
had the desired Success, and humbly shew that the perfecting the same
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
which is my present Aim) will effectually answer the Ends proposed.</P>
<P>And 1 <HI>st.</HI> I shall Consider the Immunities and Priviledges, <HI>viz.</HI> It
is provided, by the Acts, that every Registred Person whether Land∣men
or Seamen, to the number of 30000, Commission and Warrant-Officers
excluded, shall have 40 <HI>Shill. per Annum,</HI> both at Sea and
on Shore, as well in times of Peace as War; whether in His Majesty's
or Merchants Service! That they shall have two Months Pay in every
six Months, whilst on foreign Voyages, paid to their Relations, for
their Support in their Absence! That they shall have a double Share
of Prizes! That in case of their Death whilst on foreign Voyages,
their Executors or Administrators, shall receive their Wages without
waiting for the Return or Payment of the Ships! That such only shall
be perferred to Commission, Warrant, and Petty-Offices in His Majesty's
Navy! That they shall be exempt and free from all Parochial. and
Peace-Offices, or being Assessors or Collectors of Taxes, and from serving
on Juries and Inquests, or as Soldiers in the <HI>Militia;</HI> with other En∣couragements.
(Yet notwithstanding these Priviledges (which en∣gaged
many Persons who never designed to enter into, neither are
proper for the Service at Sea, to Register themselves) yet (as I am
credibly informed) there are not 20000 Registred, Officers included,
which is far short of the Expectation of that August Assembly; They
having provided for the first 30000, excluding Officers; and that the
Number of the Registred Seamen exempting Officers; should
at no time exceed 30000 expecting that the Generality of Sea∣men
in <HI>England</HI> would be very free to Register themselves, considering
the aforesaid Immunities and Advantages granted them by the said
Acts. And that a far greater Number were expected to Register than
what are, will further appear by the unparallel'd Charitable Donation
of the said Royal Famous Fabrick, the spacious <HI>Hospital</HI> of <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
and the ample Provision made by the said Acts, to support the same;
being as a Harbour so Capacious, and well Provided, that it may
receive into, and succour in, and by it, all the distressed Seamen of
the Nation (and their Families) that have a Right thereto, by Virtue
of the said Acts; but more of this in its proper place: And shall at
present consider some of the probable Causes, or Reasons, why the said
Acts have not had the desired Effect; the most Principal ones, I fear,
are first, the Seamens Treatment in the Particulars before mentioned at
large, which shall not repeat.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> The want of the Execution of, and the Uncertainty that re∣mains
to the Prejudice of the said Acts, and rendring the same in a
great Measure useless, with respect to the Purposes for which they
were intended.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40"/>
<HI>First,</HI> For the Non-performance of the said Acts, or due Execution
of them.</P>
<P>Whereas it is provided as aforesaid, That all Registred Men (the
Officers excepted) not exceeding 30000 in the whole, shall have
40 <HI>s. per Annum,</HI> whether at Sea, or on Shoar, Peace or War, They
have not as yet received one Penny, although the said Allowance
commenced according to the said Acts, above 5 Years since.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whereas it is also provided, That the Friends and Relati∣ons
of such Registred Seamen as should be absent on foreign Voyages,
should receive for their Subsistance, during such Friends or Relations
Absence, two Month's Pay in every six Months they should be so ab∣sent;
This also was never yet complied with.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whereas 'twas also enacted, That the Friends and Relati∣ons
of such as died on foreign Voyages, their Executors or Adminis∣trators,
should receive the Wages of such deceased Friends and Rela∣tions,
without waiting the Return, or General Pay of the Ship;
this Clause hath also been so restrained, (contrary to the Genuine In∣tent
and Construction of the Act) that few have received the Benefit
thereby intended. For Example,</P>
<P><HI>1st.</HI> Those that have been bound out on foreign Voyages, and died
before their Departure from <HI>England,</HI> are refused the Benefit of the
Acts, and are obliged to wait for the Payment of the Ships.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> Those that have been on foreign Voyages, and return'd to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and died in any Road or Harbour in the Land, or have been set
on shoar, and died of the Sickness contracted in such Voyages, are
also denied the Benefit of the Acts, because they died after their Re∣turn
into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> Those also that have proceeded on foreign Voyages, and con∣tinued
many Months on Board one Ship, and have afterwards been
turned over into other Ships, and in a short time died there; only
the Wages for the short time which such Persons were in the last Ships,
have been paid their Executors, and the Wages due for the time they
were in the first Ships, has been refused, till the General Pay of the
said first Ships.</P>
<P><HI>4thly.</HI> All those th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t die in Voyages to <HI>Holland, France,</HI> the <HI>Narrow
Seas, &amp;c.</HI> are denied the Benefit of the Acts, such Voyages being not
accounted foreign Voyages.</P>
<P><HI>5thly.</HI> The Friends and Relations of all Commission and Warrant-Officers
that die on foreign Voyages, so accounted, are denied their
Wages till the Payment of the Ships; it being alledged they are not
to have the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efits of the said Acts.</P>
<P>Indeed the Encourageme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts aforesaid did at first engage a great many
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
able Seamen to Register themselves, as well as many others, as afore∣said,
that neither had, nor ever intended to use the Seas, <HI>viz.</HI> Cob∣lers,
Barbers, Alehouse-keepers, and some grave Seniors who could
well digest the 40 <HI>s. per Ann.</HI> and to be exempt from all Services and
Duties on shoar, and knew if they should be called for (which they
never expected) they could handsomely come off with the Complement
of being old, that they are in great Business on shoar, pay g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Taxes;
and many other the like Excuses, which for brevity sake, I shall omit:
And as for other Tradesmen, having a Stall for a Quarter, and a Room
by the Week; they know how to avoid going to Sea, by a small
Remove, without Notice; And are well assured that at the most, they
could only lose 40 <HI>s. per Ann.</HI> which they never deserved; and that
all they should receive on that Account would be clear Profit. Now
these Encouragements, as aforesaid, being generally and equally given,
as well to Masters-Mates, and other Petty-Officers (whose Imploy∣ments
are genteel, and their Wages from 30 <HI>s.</HI> to 3 <HI>l. 5 s. per</HI> Month;
who for the Benefit of the said Imployments, are ready to enter them∣selves.)
As to the said Barbers in their Shops, Coblers in their Stalls,
and Alehouse-keepers by their Fire-sides, and some grave Seniors as
aforesaid; and so many Taylors, Weavers, and other Land-Lubbers
(as the Seamen term them) who did go to Sea; but in bad Weather,
and hard Gales of Wind (when the able Sailors, like true Sons of
<HI>Neptune,</HI> are most Vigorous and Brave) lay like Swabs in the Scup∣pers
(as not worthy the Hatches to lie on) and as so many Stumb∣ling-Blocks
in their way; for these Reasons the common able Sea∣men,
who alone bear the Burthen, and undergo the whole Fatigue,
can hardly perswade themselves, that they have due or equal Encou∣ragement
by the said Acts; now whether these things added to what
is aforesaid, have not obstructed the Seamens Registring, I shall sub∣mit
to better Judgment.</P>
<P>But by what Means soever, it happens (as I am informed) there are
not as aforesaid, 20000 Men in all Registred, and scarce one third part
of Those able Seamen. The Officers and their Servants, and the Trades
men and Land-Men considered, with the Number of Registred Men
that are dead since the Acts commenced, or are already in the Navy;
but few Registred able Seamen will be found at this Juncture for the
Service, which with some other Matters, that I conceive worthy of
Consideration, in that they leave the Government at an uncertainty,
with respect to the finding those that are Registred, and if they could
be easily procured, would be, as aforesaid, but a small Proportion
comparative to the Number wanting<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so that it is evident the Regis∣ter
Acts do not answer the End designed. And this arises principally
from two Causes.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="42"/>
First, In that the Acts are not general, but leave all Men to their
Liberty, whether they will Register or not: And Secondly, Those
that are Registred, having Liberty to go to Sea in our own Merchant-Ships
or Foreigners (undiscovered) and consequently may leave the
Nation; and those that live on shoar, and Registred themselves for the
aforesaid Advantages only, being capable by Removing to any other
part, to follow their Callings without Discovery, or the least Suspition
of their being Registred: For these Reasons it is to be feared, if the
Government should now call for them, as Registred Men, they would
not more readily appear, than in <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March</HI> 1700, when a
Months <HI>Gratis</HI>-Money, or Bounty was promised, without Distinction;
And although the Number then wanted was much less than the Num∣ber
Registred, the Government did not think meet to summons them,
but the Press was very severe, and the Methods thereof in some Mea∣sures
differed from what was practised in the late War: For notwith∣standing
Liberty was given for Men to enter themselves as Volun∣teers,
till the 26th of <HI>March;</HI> the Press, as I am credibly informed,
began the 7th or 8th of the same Month, and altho the Peace con∣tinued,
the Cruising-Ships have press'd from home-ward bound Ships
ever since; and yet the Fleet that was then imployed, not so well
manned, as might have been hoped, they would have been, without
those Methods. Wherefore it being evident, That there will now be
occasion for more Men than there was the last Spring; (the Honou∣rable
House of Commons having already voted 40000) for the Service
of this present Year 25000 whereof, as I am informed, are yet
wanting, there being but 1500 at present imployed. Now, that the
Seamen may be engaged as well as obliged to enter into the Service,
that their Grievances may be removed, and they have due Encourage∣ment,
and yet the Nation save 300000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> in time of War,
which is near as much as was saved (as it is termed) by the unrea∣sonable
Q's and R's, during the late War; of which for the future,
I hope there will be little Occasion, And that the Nation's Wealth,
Strength, and Honour, may be preserved, and increased, I shall
humbly propose, as an Effectual Means, to compleat the same, the
making perfect the present Acts for Registring Seamen, by making
them General or Universal within this Kingdom; which if the Wis∣dom
of the Nation, and the Government, think meet, it may be
extended to others of His Majesty's Dominions: For which purpose I
humbly presume, the Officers now imployed, and Offices erected for
putting the present Acts in Execution, with those that are in His
Majesty's Pay already, and the Addition, of a few Clerks, (the Charge
whereof will not be great, nor the Form differ much from that now
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
used in the Register-Office, and yet) will be sufficient to perfect the
said Acts, and answer the End proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> If the Great Counsel
of the Nation shall think meet to provide and enjoin by an Act: The
Minister, Church-wardens, or such other Parochial or Peace-Officers,
or principal Inhabitants, as shall be thought necessary in every City,
Town, Burrough, Sea-port, Precinct, Division, and Parish, to take,
and keep at all times to come, a perfect Account of the Names, Sir-names,
Ages, Complexions, and Distinctions of every Mariner, as
well Masters of Ships, as other Sea-faring Men, Fisher-men, Water-men,
Barge-men, Hoy-men, Keel-men, and Boat-men, and of all
Ship-wrights and Caulkers, Sayl-makers and all others, whose
Imyloyments and Callings immediately depends on the Water (or the
said Trades, they being also serviceable in the Navy) which at the
time of the Execution of the said Act, or at any time, ensuing the
same, shall inhabit, sojourn, or reside within their respective Cities,
Towns. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to keep a distinct and perfect Book, or Register there∣of,
in such manner as that August Assembly shall see meet, which may
be kept as other Parochial or Church-Registers are, or ought to be, and
Copies thereof transmitted at convenient times to the General Register-Office
in <HI>London,</HI> and the next adjacent Sea-port, to such City, Town,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> or such of them as shall be directed; (if such Town be not a Sea-port)
that this, or such other Method of the like Nature as that
August Assembly shall see meet to direct, for ascertaining the Num∣bers
of such Persons in each place, will undoubtedly answer the End
proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> to Man the Navy with Expedition, and save the Na∣tion
great Sums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as will appear by what follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. Hereby we may know the Number of the Persons that are of
the Callings aforesaid, within this Kingdom in general, and how many
are in each place, and consequently what <HI>Quota</HI> is proper for them to
find, and those may by Summons, or other publick Notice, be obliged
to appear under such Penalties as shall be limited, whereby the Dila∣tory
Way and Charge of Impressing, and many other Inconveniencies
will be prevented, with the necessary Expence of the least (but most
advantagious part of the former Charge) <HI>viz.</HI> (Conduct-Money)
and that without Prejudice to any, and with great Advantage to <HI>Na∣vigation,</HI>
and Trade in general; which, by reason of the former Prac∣tice
of Impressing was greatly obstructed, especially as aforesaid, in
the Sea-Ports adjacent to the Navy, and that not only with respect
to the Advance of Wages, but oftentimes after great Sums have
been laid out to equip Ships for the Seas, their Men have been all
Imprest, and their Voyages overthrown, and sometimes their Men
have been Imprest, when their Ships were not in Safety, and the Ships
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
and Cargoes by that Means lost, with many other Disadvantages too
numerous to insert, which by such Act and Method would be prevent∣ed.
For Example, Suppose there is within this Kingdom 120000
Men, of the Callings and Imployments aforementioned, as some have
computed, and that 40000 being 2 fifth parts of them are sufficient
effectually to Man the Navy (but whether more or less, is not so
material; forasmuch as the Navy must be man'd, and that the intent
of this Subject is as aforesaid, that it may be done with the most Ex∣pedition
and Equality, and least Charge to the Nation;) and suppo∣sing
in the City of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and Parts adjacent, there are 3000, two
fifth parts whereof are 1200, which at the utmost Extremity will be
their <HI>quota,</HI> and there will be 1800 remaining to carry on the Merchants
Trade; who, with the help of such Land-men as would gladly use
the Seas (were they not afrighted by the Hardships aforementioned)
would be sufficient for that Service, especially considering they would
be able to proceed about their Business without hazard of lmpressing,
but considering the Number of Seamen already imployed in the Ser∣vice,
and the Officers and their Servants that will be imployed in the
Ships that are now to equip, and many Land-men that will enter them∣selves;
their <HI>quota</HI> will not amount to 500 Men, and those may with
much ease be raised in few days as aforesaid, and those will in proba∣bility
be the youngest Men; it being for the Advantage of every Place to
send those who have the least Families, and Charge, and would by that
Means lessen their Poors Rate, which will also be of great Advantage
to the Nation, for the young men, during the late War, having no settled
Habitations, could with ease, and often did abscond until the Press hath
been over, and then having the opportunity of going long Voyages in
Merchant-Ships, escap'd the Service; which Practice by such Act
will be prevented. Bur forasmuch as divers Objections may arise
against such Act, and that I find two principal Ones in the said Trea∣tise
of the honoured Commissioner <HI>Geo.</HI> St. <HI>Loe</HI>'s; wherein instead of
a General Register, some other Method is proposed, which I shall
not mention, but proceed to the said Objections.</P>
<P>And the first is, That there is no Occasion for such General
Register: But this being answered by the Nation's Experience. I shall
proceed to the second; which is, That such Act would be very diffi∣cult:
Which I shall consider, and answer thus. As for the Difficulty,
it must arise either from the Trouble or Uncertainty that will attend
the taking and keeping such Register, or in finding out ways to obl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge
the Seamen to go into the Service, when thus Registred; both wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch
seeming Difficulties, with many others which might be mentioned,
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
I doubt not but to clear, and demonstrate the Facility of bringing the
said Register Acts in a very short time to great Perfection: And first;
as for taking such Account, or General Register, as aforesaid, it may
be bone by the same Persons, and in like manner at the same time, (if
it shall be judged convenient) as an Account is taken for such Tax as
shall be laid on Land, Houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Assessors being obliged to go
to every House to inform themselves of the Rent, Inhabitants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they
may with much ease take such Account of the Persons aforesaid, as
required: And to the Register-Office it will be little trouble, and not
more difficult than the present Method, by reason the Method intended
need not differ much from the Method now in Practice, and yet be
sufficient to perfect the Acts, and make it of great Advantage; which
will appear by the following Answers to some other Objections (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> It may be objected, that many Seamen will be abroad when
such Register is taken, and consequently leave the Register imperfect,
by reason of their not being Registered.</P>
<P><HI>Answer:</HI> This may very easily, and in a short time, be remedied
by such Method of this, or the like Nature, as shall be judged pro∣per
(<HI>viz.</HI>) an Account may be taken at the return of every Ship from
Sea into any part of this Kingdom, of the Names, Sir-names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of
every Sea-faring Man that belongs to them; and this may be done by
the respective Surveyors, or Officers, appointed to put in Execution
the Act for preserving our Navigation, whose Duties it is to visit every
Ship, and take an Account of the Mariners, that the Masters may not
employ more Foreigners than that Act allows. But whether by these,
or any other Officers, it may with ease be done; but I presume it
will be a certain and infallible Means to perfect the said Act, if it
be provided that no Master or Commander of any Ship or Vessel, or
any others, holding, or using the several Callings or Employments
aforementioned, shall Receive, Entertain, or Employ any Persons in
any of their Ships, Vessels, Barges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or in, or about the said Em∣ployments
(except as Labourers only, and distinct from the proper
Arts, Workmanship, or Business of the said Callings) unless the Per∣sons
so to be employed be first Registered, and a regular Certificate
thereof produced, in from, as shall be appointed; and if any Person
shall presume to entertain in any of the Services or Employments
aforesaid, any but Registered Persons, both the Person so employed,
or serving, and the Person that employs him, may suffer such Pen∣alties
or Fines, as by the said Act shall be provided, and as by the
present Act is provided against undue Registring, false vouching, lend∣ing
Certificates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or such other Penalty as shall be inflicted; so
that by this means all that depend on the said Employments, would
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
be obliged to Register themselves, or could not follow the same; and
those Persons by the following Method, or such like, will readily be
found on any occasion, if within the Kingdom, and if not in the King∣dom,
it will appear where they are, thus; If the Commander of every
Ship outward bound (whose Duty it is to give his Owners) a Port∣lige
Bill (as they commonly call it) <HI>viz.</HI> an Account of the Names,
Sir-names, Offices, and Wages of their Ships Company, the Register
Number only of each Person being added to such Account, and Dupli∣cates
thereof, delivered to the Officers of each Port where the Ship
shall clear the like at their Arrival and Return, (as by the present Acts
they are obliged to do upon Oath, if required;) one of which Ac∣counts,
or Duplicates, being sent up to the general Register-Office,
would answer the End proposed, and be otherwise very advantageous,
as might easily be made appear.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> It may be objected, That as well Foreigners as His Majesty's
Natural-born Subjects that do not immediately belong to the King∣dom
of <HI>England,</HI> not being comprised within this Act, nor their Com∣panies
obliged to Register themselves; the Registred Seamen may
serve on Board such Ships undiscovered, and consequently avoid the
Service, and if so inclined, leave the Nation. This Objection I con∣ceive
may be thus removed, if it be provided that no such Foreigners,
nor others, under severe Penalties, receive on Board any but the
proper Companies that they brought in with them, without Notice
given to, and special License obtained from, the Commissioners for
Executing the Act, and Security may be taken for the Performance.
The Parallel Case we have, by our Commanders giving Security in
our own Plantations, not to carry off Inhabitants without License;
and further, to prevent any Fraud or Collusion, a certain Protection or
Certificate might at their first Arrival be given them of the Names,
Sir-names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of their Companies, and the same deliver'd up again
at their clearing from such Port as they shall depart from; the Charge
whereof would be small, and might be defrayed by the said Foreign∣ers:
It is therefore evident, that such Provision being made, and the
Act duly executed, as I am well perswaded it may with Ease, (and
small Charge to the Government) be done, as might more plainly be
demonstrated, if the designed Brevity of this Treatise would admit:
And would undoubtedly answer the End proposed (<HI>viz.</HI>) make the Re∣gister-Acts
perfect, serviceable, and of very great Benefit to the Na∣tion
in general; as will appear by some few of many, I may say, al∣most
innumerable Advantages that would attend the same.</P>
<P><HI>1st.</HI> By this Method the whole Navy may be Man'd in forty Days
at most; the Seamen after Summons being able to repair to the Pla∣ces
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
ordered in that time from the remotest parts of the Kingdom;
and by such speedy Equipping the Navy, or any particular Squadron,
the Nations Enemies will be prevented from taking those Advantages
they obtained during the late War, by the delatory Proceedings for
want of Men; their Fleet having been earlier at Sea than ours, to the
hazard of the greatest part of the Navy, as afore hinted; and as
for our Squadrons designed for particular Services, they have been so
long Equipping and Manning, that our Designs have been often dis∣covered,
and the Enemies had Opportunities to oppose them; by
which Means whole Fleets under strong Convoys, have been defeated
and scattered, and many destroyed, as before mentioned, which by
such speedy Equipping and Manning of them would also be prevented.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> This would prevent the great Charge and Inconveniencies of
Impressing; and the Officers and Mariners formerly employed in those
Services, would be very serviceable in fitting their respective Ships for
the Sea, as aforesaid; and those that are to serve would also be ob∣liged
to repair on Board within the time limited, and so prevent the
Charge of their Wages and Provisions, for several Months before they
arrived at their respective Ships, as it often happened during the late
War, and will also prevent their being taken in those Press-Vessels,
and not only secure their Service, but also save the Freight and Charge
of such Vessels, and their Companies, and likewise the value of the
Vessels if they should be taken, as it often happened in the late War:
The Charge whereof, (as before mentioned, being computed to amount
to very great Sums) by this Means would also be saved to the
Nation.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> This would prevent the keeping our great Ships in Pay the
whole Winter, or putting them in Commission and Pay in <HI>De∣cember,</HI>
or the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> and yet not compleatly Man'd
in <HI>May,</HI> tho three or four Press Vessels, Officers and Gangs for each
first and second Rate, and two or more for the third Rates, have been
the whole time employed in entring Volunteers, and Impressing Men
all over the Kingdom; the which alone being prevented, would save
to the Nation more than the 300000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> aforesaid; as every
Ingenious Reader may with ease demonstrate and prove to his own
Satisfaction; and was by Commissioner St. <HI>Loe,</HI> computed at more
than 500000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> as aforesaid.</P>
<P><HI>4thly.</HI> This will make the Burthen of the War more equal, and
consequently more tolerable to the Trading part of the Nation, espe∣cially
to the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Places as aforesaid adjacent to the
Navy, not only with respect to their Safety in their Voyages, and ex∣travagant
Charge to Men of Wars-Men to bring their Ships up a few
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
Leagues when their Companies are Imprest, and the Loss of great
Sums expended to fit them to Sea, in overthrowing their Voyages by
Impressing their Men when ready to sail, but also by reducing the
extravagant Wages at such times given in the aforesaid Places, more
than others. For Instance, The Traders between <HI>New Castle</HI> and <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
were forced to give to Pentioners, and other decripped, aged, and
disabled Men 7 and 8 <HI>l.</HI> a Voyage, and 55 <HI>s.</HI> or 3 <HI>l. per</HI> Month to very
ordinary Men in Merchants Ships; and indeed it any others were
employed by them, they would immediately be impress'd from them;
and at the same time in Places more remote, they gave but 40 <HI>s. per</HI>
Month to able Seamen that failed in their Merchant Ships, and little
more to those in the Coasting Trade, than in time of Peace; the Rea∣son
whereof is plain (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Imprest-Vessels that went to those
parts to Impress, were but few, and they could not stay many Months
there, especially finding few Seamen; for they by absconding 6
Weeks, or 2 or 3 Months at most, could avoid the Press; and when
the said Vessels were gone, could return, and take the Opportunity
of going abroad, and so escape the Service which occasioned the ablest
Seamen to retire to those Places, and by that means our Merchant
Ships belonging to this City, have been so pittifully Man'd, that
many have been taken by the Enemy, which would otherwise have
made a good Defence.</P>
<P>5 <HI>thly.</HI> This would encourage the Masters, and others in the Coal-Trade
(which is not the least Nursery) to breed up Seamen, espe∣cially
if it were provided, that no Apprentice should be ordered into
the Service, till he had served such Term of his Apprencice-ship as
should be judged meet, and to prevent any Fraud, it seems convenient to
Register every Apprentice as the time of his Binding, and distinguish
him as such, which would also be of great Advantage to the Mas∣ter;
who by that means would have his Wages secured to him; and
know from time to time where such Apprentice was, and would give
him the Advantage of such Apprentices Service till they were fit to
serve His Majesty.</P>
<P><HI>6thly.</HI> This Method would prevent the many Frauds and Injuries
that happen to the Seamen, their Friends and Relations, for want of
such distinction; there being many times 5 or 6 of one Name in a
Ship, and some of them happen to be made Run, others die, or are
turned over into other Ships, and frequently receive each others Wages,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Person that is run receives the Wages of him that did not run
whereby he loses the same; and the Friends of those that are absent
or dead, not being able to distinguish, whether the first, second, third,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> was their Relations, have been denied their Wages, which by the
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
Register-Number alone would be prevented; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orasmuch as a la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r¦ger
Volume than this present Tract, would not contain the Advanta∣ges
that would accrue to the Nation in general by such Acts, being as
aforesaid, almost innumerable; I shall leave the Candid Reader to
consider the same, with two Objections more that have been made a∣gainst
such Act.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Seamen's Freedom and Liberty, as English Men, (by
the right of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and the Establish'd Laws of the Realm)
exempt them from being impress'd, or otherwise compell'd into His
Majesty's Service.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That such an Act will tend to the infringing of His Ma∣jesty's
Royal Prerogative; both which I shall with all Submission to
the Learned answer thus.</P>
<P>First, As for the Seamen's Freedom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it cannot be no longer
maintained than defended against a common Enemy when invaded;
and were it not for the Seamen, (who as afore-hinted, are the Strength
or Bullwarks of the Nation) such Defence could not be made:
Therefore the Laws of all Nations, as well as the Law of
Nature, and that inherent Instinct of Self-preservation, demonstrates
it to be the Duty of every Subject to defend and maintain to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their Power, and in their proper Stations, the Common-Weal
of the Nations, to which they are allied, consequently the
Seamen in theirs, and to that very End the Regal Power and Prero∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ative
is exerted (<HI>viz.</HI>) to cause all in times of Danger and Neces∣sity
or a suffiicent Number at least to succour and defend the whole;
and as for the Royal Prerogative, such Act will rather confirm than
intringe, by obliging the Subjects more readily to appear when requi∣red
by the Royal Command, and much more agreeable to the Regal
Dignity, Peace, and Authority, than the former Practice of Impres∣sing:
The Injuries which occur'd by the Irregularity of the same, would
have been more intolerable, had not the Persons that suffered thereby,
sacrificed their private Interest to His Majesty's Honour, the advancing
and encouraging His Service, and the Nations Wellfare.</P>
<P>Many more Objections might be raised, and (I doubt not) with
the former be more fully answered; and many more, I may say, as
before, almost innumerable Advantages that will attend such Register
be proved; but not consisting with my present intended Brevity, I
shall avoid incerting of them: And if it be asked, how the able com∣mon
Seamen (who I presume, are the principal Persons that now suf∣fer)
may have due Encouragement; to this I answer, they may have
ample and due Encouragement in time of War, and equivalent with
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
that now granted and confirmed by the Register-Acts, with less
Charge to the Government, and more Satisfaction to the Seamen, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>The present Act provides, as aforesaid, for 30000 Men at 40 <HI>s.
per Annum</HI> each, being 60000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> which as aforemention∣ed,
is equally designed for Masters-Mates, and all other Petty-Offi∣cers,
Ordinary Seamen, and many Land-man, who clandestinly for
the Benefits aforesaid, have Registred themselves, notwithstanding
their Circumstances are such as will not admit them to go to Sea;
these, as aforesaid, having as much right, as well to the 40 <HI>s. per An∣num,</HI>
both in Peace and War (although they never were at Sea, or at
least since they were Registred, nor ever intended to go there) as to
all other Benefits of the Acts, as the able common Seamen have,
who bear the Burthen of the Day, the Fatigue of the Storms, and
heat of the Battles, and were as aforesaid undoubtedly the principal
Persons intended by that August Assembly to be incouraged: If there∣fore
the Wisdom of the Nation should see meet to give the common
able Seamen some other Incouragement, by way of Distinction from
those that are undeserving I mean, those Barbers, Coblers, Tinkers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from others much better provided for, as Petty-Officers, and
that as much, or more to the common Seamen's Satisfaction, yet
with less Charge, and much Advantage to the Nation as aforesaid,
than what is provided by the present Register-Acts, the Common
Seamen would be better satisfied than now they are: And indeed in
time of Distress, to have many who go under the Name, and have
equal Encouragement with able Saylors, to lie as so many Stumbling-Blocks
in their way, they cannot behold without great Regret; And
it is judged by many, that the Ignorance of those, and their Inability,
to help in times of Distress, has occasioned the Loss of many of the
Royal Navy. We having lost, during the late War, a better Navy
than <HI>France</HI> could boast of, not many Years since, and are, as I am
informed, many more than were lost in all the Wars besides for 50
Years past; but I shall forbear to insert the Number of them; Where∣fore
if some Consideration or Allowance were given only, or princi∣pally
to the said common able Seamen in lieu of the said 40 <HI>s. per An∣num,</HI>
and that only for the time they are actually in His Majesty's
Service, and to be paid with, and as an Advance to their Wages, it
would answer the Ends aforementioned. For Example; Suppose the
Great Council of the Nation should think meet to add in times of War
3 <HI>s. per</HI> Month, to the able Seamen's Wages, and supposing them to
be 20000, this would amount to 39000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> if they were
all employed the whole Year; but by the preceeding Proposition,
nigh one fourth part of that would be saved by the Men's Discharge,
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
when the great Ships are laid up in time of War, and more than one
half if it shall be thought necessary to give the same in time of Peace,
and no Person has any Ground or Colour of Discontent for not having
Wages without Work or Attendance, as is the Case of the 40 <HI>s. per
Annum,</HI> War and Peace, and if it be thought proper to give some
Encouragement to the Ordinary Seamen, and some of the Petty Offi∣cers,
it would not amount to near the Sum that is now appointed, both
in War and Peace. I shall add to what is aforesaid, as a further En∣couragement
for the Seamen in general, the Project of a late Member
of the Honourable House of Commons, for making Seamens Tickets
more Current, and in good Esteem, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An Humble Proposal to the Honourable House of Commons, with respect
to the Seamens Wages for the Year 1700.</HEAD>
<P>THere being allowed for the Year 1700, for the Service of the
Navy seven thousand Seamen, Officers included, whose, Wa∣ges
amounts to 150000 <HI>l.</HI> little more or less; If the said Officers and
Seamen be immediately discharged, after their Arrival into Port, with
Tickets signed, as herein after is described, and such Tickets be made
current in all the Publick Revenues (that are not already appropria∣ted)
with Interest at Two and a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> till discharged in the
Course of the Navy.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>These following Advantages will arise thereby;</HEAD>
<P>I. Very great Sums will be saved to the Nation, which must other∣wise
of necessity be expended for Wage and Provisions, before Mo∣nies
can be sent to <HI>Plymouth, Portsmouth,</HI> &amp;c. to pay the Seamen, as
was in like Case for Admiral <HI>Aylmer</HI>'s Squadron, and the <HI>West-India,</HI>
and other Ships, some of which were laid up, and kept in Pay near
two Years for want of Money to discharge them.</P>
<P>II. The great Charge of sending Monies to the said Places, and of
the Commissioners and Clerks to attend the Payments, will also be
prevented.</P>
<P>III. The Intolerable Charge and Fatigue which the poor Seamen
their Wives and Relations have been exposed to in Travelling to the
aforesaid Places; and their being absent many Months from their Ha∣bitations,
waiting for the Ships payments, will wholly be pre∣vented.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52"/>
IV. The great Loss which the Seamen and their Families have sus∣tained
by selling their Tickets through Necessity, (some having lost
Seven, and others above Ten shillings <HI>per</HI> Pound, an Oppression that
cries aloud for Relief) will be saved to them, and the Trade of Tick∣et-buying
destroyed, and the Frauds that often happen will be prevent∣ed,
and the Seamens Tickets, after Signed and Confirmed, will be rea∣dy
Moneys to them in all Parts of the Kingdom, being provided for
by Parliament.</P>
<P>V. This will take off for the future all occasion of Clamours, on ac∣count
of Q's and R's, and can be no more a Vexation to the Honoura∣ble
House of Commons or Commissioners of the Navy; and whatever
may be supposed to occasion the Seamens deserting the Nations Service,
the want of their Pay has been one Material Cause thereof.</P>
<P>VI. If Two shillings <HI>per</HI> Month be added to the Common Seamens
Pay, the same (with the Encouragement of a regular Discharge <HI>per</HI>
Currant Tickets, as aforesaid) will be a means to Man our Navy, in
case of another War (which God forbid) without Impressing, and there∣by
save to the Nation a great Sum <HI>per An.</HI> which must otherwise be
expended on that Account: And although there be four times the Num∣ber
of Seamen employed, the same Method may be preserved, or every
Year renewed by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>If it be objected, That the Tickets will be a Paper-Credit without
a Fund, that cannot be supposed, if it be already provided for: But
grant it were not. The Tickets, as they now are, are a Paper-Dis∣credit
both to King and People; And it is better to give Two and a
half <HI>per Cent.</HI> by way of Interest, (which will not amount to any
great Sum, by reason few Men will be discharged until the Year be
expired, and consequently the greatest part of the Taxes collected)
than to suffer so great a Discredit, as the Seamens Tickets have been,
for several years past.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53"/>
And as for Counterfeiting the said Tickets, it cannot be supposed,
being made out in this or the like manner:</P>
<P>This Ticket entitles the Bearer hereof to ten Pounds five
Shillings and six Pence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Britannia.</NOTE> and Interest at Two and a half <HI>per

<P>A short Bill will do for Trial for the seven thousand Men this pre∣sent
Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some other Advantages were mentioned in the said
Proposal, which for Brevity sake I shall omit.</P>
<P>Now in case the Advantages to the Government are such as afore∣mentioned,
and many more than are inserted, I hope the great Coun∣cil
of the Nation will find Means to establish the same; Indeed one
great Objection against that Proposal, was the hazard of having the
Tickets counterfeited; but as that would have been very difficult
when it was proposed, it will be much more, if such Register be ta∣ken
and kept, and it will be next to an Impossibility to counterfeit Tic∣kets;
for no Person will be able to personate another, unless he has
also his Register-Certificate, and if he has, it will do him no Service
unless he has his Ticket also; and if such Accident should happen,
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
it may be provided, that no such Ticket should be assigned to any Per∣son,
but in the Presence of one, or more of the Commission or War∣rant-Officers
belonging to the same Ship, wherein the said Person
ser'vd, and must therefore know him to be the real Person, unless it
be at the place of the Person's Aboad, or where he is very well known,
and there to be vouched by such principal Inhabitants as know him.
A Penalty might also be inflicted on such Persons as should accept any
Ticket, unless vouched, as aforesaid; this will also prevent the Cap∣tains
being imposed on by their Clerks; several of whom have made
out Tickets for some Men's Service that were not discharged by Tic∣ket,
and kept and disposed of the same to their own use, personating
those that served for the Wages; and others have made out two Tickets
for one Man's Service, and sold one of them for their own advantage;
and in both these Cases the Officers Hands being required to those
Tickets, they must either be forged, or the Officers imposed on. But I
shall leave this to be improv'd by some more Noble and Ingenious
Pen, and conclude with some brief Hints of the many Advantages
that might be added to the most Noble and Royal Hospital at <HI>Green∣wich,</HI>
and an Encouragement to <HI>Navigation</HI> in general, and would be
a Means to extend the Charity and Relief of the same through the
whole Kingdom, whereof we have a fair Epitomy (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Antient
and Worthy Society or Brother-hood of the <HI>Trinity-House</HI> of <HI>Deptford
Strond,</HI> whose Charity refreshes the Bowels of some Thousands of
Seamen, and their Distressed Families.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing whereby the Revenues of the Hospital of Greenwich, may be
advanced, and the Charitable Influences thereof extended through
the whole Nation.</HEAD>
<P>THat which I would offer as advantageous to the Hospital in the
first place, is humbly to recommend to serious Consideration,
the due Execution of the Laws against Profane Cursing and Swearing
in the Royal Navy, and the Officers due Observance of their Instruc∣tions,
who are enjoined under Pecuniary Penalties, not to Swear or
Curse profanely; and in case those Forfeitures were duly collected
and applied to the Benefit of the Hospital, it would not only great∣ly
advance the Revenue thereof (for some time at least) but would
in all probability suppress that which neither His Majesty's discounte∣nance,
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
the Injunctions by their Instructions, the Laws of God, and
of this Realm, hath hitherto done, I mean, suppress the Epidemical
abounding of those horrid unprofitable Sins, and the publick Glory
many of them take in it.</P>
<P>2. Whereas the present Act enjoyns all Persons using the Seas, to
pay out of their Wages six Pence <HI>per</HI> Month, except Registred Men
(who do not pay it in His Majesty's Service, whatever they do in Mer∣chant-Men)
and yet they alone have the Benefits of the Acts and Hos∣pital.
Now as an Addition to the Hospitals Revenues, if the Com∣manders,
and all other Officers in Merchants Ships, whose Wages
exceeds 40 <HI>s. per Mensem,</HI> should pay in proportion to their Wages,
or so much as the wise Senate shall think meet; and if the Commis∣sion
and Warrant-Officers in His Majesty's Navy allowed in like Pro∣portion,
and the Seamen in general in time of War, paid 12 <HI>d. per</HI>
Month to the Hospital, and 6 <HI>d.</HI> in time of Peace, or such other Sums
as shall be thought proper, it would greatly add to the Hospitals Re∣venues,
and be a plentiful Spring flowing into the same, whereby
it would become a universal Fountain to refresh with it's Streams the
drooping Spirits of all the miserable Seamen, and their Families: For
which, as well as for uniting the <HI>Chest</HI> at <HI>Chatham,</HI> to the said Hospi∣tal,
some few Reasons of many which might be given, I shall here
humbly offer.</P>
<P>That it is reasonable for the Captains of the Men of War to con∣tribute
to the Hospital in some Proportion to their Wages, will appear
from the Considerations following.</P>
<P>1. Such Captains, who through Age, Infirmity, and other Acci∣dents,
are unfit for farther Service, are provided for, at the publick
Charge, by sutable Pensions to themselves during Life; and if they
are slain, large Bounties to their Wives and Children; and this usually
accounted, allowed, and paid as part of the Estimate of the Navy.</P>
<P>2. They being employed in the Nations Service, and their Salleries,
Wages, and other Benefits (which are very large) being defrayed
at the publick Charge. And this Charitable Hospital being for the
Publick Good, it is very reasonable those Gentlemen using the Seas,
and receiving the aforesaid Advantages thereby, should contribute to
the Charge thereof.</P>
<P>3. 'Tis by the hazard of the Lives, and at the Expence of the Blood
of the Persons intended to be provided for by the Hospital, that the
Honour of those Gentlemen is gained, and therefore reasonable they
should contribute toward their Relief.</P>
<P>The like will hold for the other Commission and Warrant-Officers.</P>
<P>And the Reason why the Commanders, and other Officers of Merchants
Ships, should pay in some proportion to their Wages, is what holds
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
as a constant Maxim in all publick Taxes, <HI>viz.</HI> That every one shall con∣tribute
to the publick Charge according to their Abilities; besides
they will receive a considerable Advantage by the Act, if perfected,
with respect to the knowing where their Apprentices and Servants are
from time to time, and thereby securing their Wages, which they
formerly generally lost; but it will be more reasonable, and a further
Encouragement, as well to the Commanders and Officers, as the com∣mon
Seamen in Merchants Service (who have now no benefit by the
said Acts) not only to pay to the said Hospital what they now do, but
more in time of War, as aforesaid; if they also might have the bene∣fit
of the Hospital in case of the Loss of Limbs, or other Accidents that
shall befal them, in defending the Merchants Ships, which would en∣courage
them so to do, and remove that great obstruction which now
prevents it (<HI>viz.</HI>) the fear of such Damage, and the evil Consequence
thereof, no provision being made for their Releif; and it seems a great
Hardship that Persons should hazard their Lives and Limbs in His Ma∣jesty's
Service, as well as in Merchant Ships, and pay so much to∣wards
the Maintainance of an Hospital, and yet receive no Advantage
by it, as is the Case of those Seamen that are not Register'd. But I shall
proceed, and briefly mention some few Reasons for, and Advantages
that will accrue by the uniting of the <HI>Chest</HI> at <HI>Chatham</HI> to the said Hos∣pital;
and so conclude.</P>
<P>1. It appears to be reasonable forasmuch as the said <HI>Chest</HI> was soun∣ded
at the Seamens own Request, and proper Charge, there being at
that time no provision made for them, in Case they should be wound∣ed
or mained, but being now provided for by the said Hospital; there
is no further Occasion for the said expence (<HI>viz.</HI>) the 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Month,
which the Registered Seamen provided for, as aforesaid, as well as
those that are not Registered, that serve in the Navy, still pay as well
in Peace as War.</P>
<P>2. The Advantage to the Hospital will be very considerable, because
the said <HI>Chest</HI> have great Incomes; having purchased, as I am inform∣ed,
near 3000 Pounds <HI>per Ann.</HI> in free Lands; which after the Death
of the present Pensioners, would be a free Income to the Hospital; and
with which, and the Seamens Contribution aforesaid, the <HI>Chest</HI> provides
for, and satisfies all those that are, or have been hurt, maimed, or lost any
Limbs in His Majesty's Service, ever since the said <HI>Chest</HI> was founded:
Many other weighty Reasons and considerable Advantages which might
be made appear, I shall forbear to mention, with some other Matters
intended for the Advantage of <HI>Navigation</HI> in general; but this, with
the Improvement of what is before only hinted, for Brevity sake, shall
leave for some more Noble Mind, and dexterous Pen, and submit the
same to the Consideration of the Wisdom of the Nation.</P>
