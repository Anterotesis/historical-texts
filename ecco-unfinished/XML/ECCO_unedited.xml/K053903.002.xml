<P>THE carriages were at the gates at an
early hour; the bustle of the domestics,
passing to and fro in the galleries, awakened
Emily from harassing slumbers: her un‚à£quiet
mind had, during the night, presented
her with terrific images and obscure circum‚à£stances,
concerning her affection and her
future life. She now endeavoured to chase
away the impressions they had left on her
fancy; but from imaginary evils she awoke
to the consciousness of real ones. Recol‚à£lecting
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
that she had parted with valancourt,
perhaps for ever, her heart sickened as me‚à£mory
revived. But she tried to dismiss the
dismal forebodings that crowded on her
mind, and to restrain the sorrow which she
could not subdue; efforts which diffused
over the settled melancholy of her counte‚à£nance
an expression of tempered resigna‚à£tion,
as a thin veil, thrown over the fea‚à£tures
of beauty, renders them more inte‚à£resting
by a partial concealment. But
Madame Montoni observed nothing in this
countenance except its unusual paleness,
which attracted her censure. She told her
niece, that she had been indulging in fan‚à£ciful
sorrows, and begged she would have
more regard for decorum, than to let the
world see that she could not renounce an
improper attachment; at which Emily's
pale cheek became flushed with crimson,
but it was the blush of pride, and she
made no answer. Soon after, Montoni
entered the breakfast room, spoke little,
and seemed impatient to be gone.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
The windows of this room opened upon
the garden. As Emily passed them, she saw
the spot where she had parted with Va‚à£lancourt
on the preceding night: the re‚à£membrance
pressed heavily on her heart,
and she turened hastily away from the ob‚à£ject
that had awakened it.</P>
<P>The baggage being at length adjusted,
the travellers entered their carriages, and
Emily would have left the chateau with‚à£out
one sigh of regret, had it not been
situated in the neighbourhood of Valan‚à£court's
residence.</P>
<P>From a little eminence she looked back
upon Tholouse, and the far-seen plains of
Gascony, beyond which the broken sum‚à£mits
of the PyrenÈes appeared on the dis‚à£tant
horizon, lighted up by a morning sun.
‚ÄúDear pleasant mountains!‚Äù said she to her‚à£selt,
‚Äúhow long may it be ere I see ye again,
and how much may happen to make me
miserable in the interval! oh, could I now
be certain, that I should ever return to
ye, and find that Valancourt still lived
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
for me, I should go in peace! He will
still gaze on ye, gaze when I am far
away!‚Äù</P>
<P>The trees, that impended over the high
banks of the road and formed a line of
perspective with the distant country, now
threatened to exclude the view of them;
but the blueish mountains still appeared
beyond the dark foliage, and Emily con‚à£tinued
to lean from the coach window,
till at length the closing branches shut them
from her sight.</P>
<P>Another object soon caught her atten‚à£tion.
She had scarcely looked at a person
who walked along the bank, with his hat,
in which was the military feather, drawn
over his eyes, before, at the sound of wheels,
he suddenly truned, and she perceived that
it was Valancourt himself, who waved his
hand, sprung into the road, and through
the window of the carriage put a letter into
her hand. He endeavoured to smile through
the despair that overspread his countenance
as she passed on. The remembrance of
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
that smile seemed impressed on Emily's
mind for ever. She leaned from the win‚à£dow,
and saw him on a knoll of the broken
bank, leaning against the high trees that
waved over him, and pursuing the carriage
with his eyes. He waved his hand, and she
continued to gaze till distance confused his
figure, and at length another turn of the
road entirely separated him from her
sight.</P>
<P>Having stopped to take up Signor Ca‚à£vigni
at a chateau on the road, the travel‚à£lers,
of whom Emily was disrespectfully
seated with Madame Montoni's woman in
a second carriage, pursued their way over
the plains of Languedoc. The persence
of this servant restrained Emily from read‚à£ing
Valancourt's letter, for the did not
choose to expose the emotions it might oc‚à£casion
to the observation of any person.
Yet such was her wish to read this his last
Communication, that her. trembling hand.
was every moment on the point of breaking
the seal</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
At length they reached the village,
where they staid only to change horses,
without alighting, and it was not till they
stopped to dine, that Emily had an oppor‚à£tunity
of reading the letter. Though she
had never doubted the sincerity of Valan‚à£court's
affection, the fresh assurances she
now received of it revived her spirits; she
wept over his letter in tenderness, laid it by
to be referred to when they should be par‚à£ticularly
depressed, and then thought of him
with much less anguish then she had done
since they parted. Among some other re‚à£quests,
which were interesting to her, be‚à£cause
expressive of his tenderness, and be‚à£cause
a compliance with them seemed to
annihilate for a while the pain of absence,
he entreated she would always think of him
at sun-set. ‚Äúyou will then meet me in
thought,‚Äù said he; ‚ÄúI shall constantly
watch the sun-set, and I shall be happy in
the belief, that your eyes are fixed upon the
same object with mine, and that our minds
are conversing. You Know not, Emily, the
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
comfort I promise myself form these mo‚à£ments;
but I trust you will experience
it.‚Äù</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to say with what emotion
Emily, on this evening, watched the de‚à£clining
sun, over a long extent of plains,
on wich. she saw it set without interrup‚à£tion,
and sink towards the province which
Valancourt inhabited. After this hour her
mind became far more tranquil and re‚à£signed,
than it had been since the marriage
of Montoni and her aunt.</P>
<P>During several day the travellers jour‚à£neyed
over the plains of Languedoc; and
then entering Dauphiny, and winding for
some time among the mountains of that ro‚à£mantic
province, they quitted their car‚à£riages
and began to ascend the Alps. And
here such scenes of sublimity opened upon
them as no colours of language must dare
to paint; Emily's mind was even so much
engaged with new and wonderful images,
that they sometimes banished the idea of
Valancourt, though they more frequently
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
revived it. These brought to her recol‚à£lection
the prospects among the PyrenÈes,
which they had admired together, and had
believed nothing could excel in grandeur.
How often did she wish to express to him
the new emotions which this astonishing
scenery awakened, and that he could par‚à£take
of them! sometimes too she endea‚à£voured
to anticipate his remarks, and al‚à£most
imagined him present. She seemed
to have arisen to another world, and to
have left every trifiing thought, every trifling
sentiment, in that below; those only of
grandeur and sublimity now dilated her
mind, and elevated the affections of her
heart.</P>
<P>With what emotions of sublimity, softened
by tenderness, did she meet Valancourt in
thought, at the customary hour of sun-set,
when, wandering among the Alps, she
watched the glorious orb sink amid their
summits, his last tints die away on their
snowy points, and a solemn obscurity steal
over the scene! And when the last gleam
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
had faded, she turned her eyes from the
west with somewhat of the melancholy re‚à£gret
that is experienced after the departure
of a beloved friend; while these lonely feel‚à£ings
were heightened by the spreading
gloom, and by the low sounds, heard only
when darkness confines attention, which
make the gerneral stillness more impressive‚Äî
leaves shook by the air, the last sigh of the
breeze that lingers after sun-set, or the
murmur of distant streams.</P>
<P>During the first days of this journey
among the Alps, the scenery exhibited a
wonderful mixture of solitude and inhabi‚à£tation,
of cultivation and barrenness. On
the edge of tremendous precipices, and
within the hollow of the cliffs, below which
the clouds often floated, were seen villages,
spires, and convent towers; while green
pastures and vineyards spread their hues at
the feet of perpendicular rocks of marble,
or of granite, whose points, tufted with
alpine shrubs, or exhibiting only massy
crags, rose above each other, till they ter‚à£minated
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
in the snow-topt mountain, whence
the torrent fell, that thundered along the
valley.</P>
<P>The snow was not yet melted on the
summit of Mount Cenis, over which the
travellers passed; but Emily, as she looked
upon its clear lake and extended plain,
surrounded by broken cliffs, saw, in ima‚à£gination,
the verdant beauty it would exhi‚à£bit
when the snows should be gone, and
the shepherds, leading up the midsummer
flocks from Piedmont, to pasture on its
flowery summit, should add Arcadian fi‚à£gures
to Arcadian landscape.</P>
<P>As she descended on the Italian side, the
precipices became still more tremendous,
and the prospects still more wild and ma‚à£jestic,
over which the shifting lights threw
all the pomp of colouring. Emily delight‚à£ed
to observe the snowy tops of the moun‚à£tains
under the passing influence of the day,
blushing with morning, glowing with the
brightness of noon, or just tinted with the
purple evening. The haunt of man could
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
now only be discovered by the simple hut
of the shepherd and the hunter, or by the
rough pine bridge thrown across the tor‚à£rent,
to assist the latter in his chase of the
chamois over crags where, but for this
vestige of man, it would have been be‚à£lieved
only the chamois or the wolf dared
to venture. As Emily gazed upon one of
these perilous bridges, with the cataract
foaming beneath it, some images came to
her mind, which she afterwards combined
in the following</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>STORIED SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>The weary traveller, who, all night long,</L>
<L>Has climb'd among the Alps' tremendous steeps,</L>
<L>Skirting the pathless precipice, where throng</L>
<L>Wild forms of danger; as he onward creeps</L>
<L>If, chance, his anxious eye at distance sees</L>
<L>The mountain- shepherd's solitary home,</L>
<L>Peeping from forth the moon- illumin'd trees'</L>
<L>What sudden transports to his bosom come!</L>
<L>But, if between some hideous chasm yawn,</L>
<L>Where the cleft pine a doubtful bridge displays,</L>
<L>In dreadful, silence, on the brink, forlorn</L>
<L>He stands, and views in the faint rays</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Far far below, the torrent's rising surge,</L>
<L>And listens to the wild impetuous roar;</L>
<L>Still eyes the depth, still shudders on the verge,</L>
<L>Fears to return, nor dares to venture o'er.</L>
<L>Desperate, at length the tottering plank he tries,</L>
<L>His weak steps slide, he shrieks, he sinks-he dies!</L>
<P>Emily, often as she travelled among the
clouds, watched in silent awe their billowy
surges rolling below; sometimes, wholly
closing upon the scene, they appeared like
a world of chaos, and, at others, spreading
thinly, they opened and admitted partial
catches of the landscape‚Äîthe torrent, whose
astounding roar had never failed, tum‚à£bling
down the rockey chasm, huge cliffs
white with snow, or the dark summits of the
pine forests, that stretched mid-way down
the mountains. But who may describe her
rapture, when, having passed through a sea
of vapour, she caught a first view of Italy;
when, from the ridge of one of those tre‚à£mendous
precipices that hang upon Mount
Cenis and guard the entrance of that en‚à£chanting
country, she loked down through
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
the lower clouds, and, as they floated away,
saw the grassy vales of Piedmont at her
feet, and, beyond, the plains of Lombardy
extending to the farthest distance, at which
appeared, on the faint horizon, the doubt‚à£ful
towers of Turin?</P>
<P>The solitary grandeur of the objects that
immediately surrounded her, the moun‚à£tain-region
towering above, the deep preci‚à£pices
that fell beneath, the waving black‚à£ness
of the forests of pine and oak, which
skirted their feet, or hung within their re‚à£cesses,
the headlong torrents that, dashing
among their cliffs, sometimes appeared like
a cloud of mist, at others like a sheet of ice‚Äî
these were features which received a higher
character of sublimity from the reposing
beauty of the Italian landscape below,
stretching to the wide horizon, where the
same melting blue tint seemed to unite earth
and sky.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni only shuddered as she
looked down precipices near whose edge
the chairmen trotted lightly and swiftly,
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
almost, as the chamois bounded, and from
which Emily too recoiled; but with her
fears were mingled such various emotions
of delight, such admiration, astonishment,
and awe, as she had never experienced
before.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the carriers, having come to a
landing- place, stopped to rest, and the tra‚à£vellers
being seated on the point of a cliff,
Montoni and Cavigni renewed a dispute
concerning Hannibal's passage over the
Alps, Montoni contending that he entered
Italy by way of Mount Cenis, and Cavigni,
That he passed over Mount St. Bernard. The
subject brought to Emily's imagination the
disasters he had suffered in this bold and
perilous adventure. She saw his vast armies
winding among the defiles, and over the
tremendous cliffs of the mountains, which
at night were lighted up by his fires, or by
the torches which he caused to be carried
when he pursued his indefatigable march.
In the eye of fancy, she perceived the gleam
of arms through the duskiness of night,
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
the glitter of spears and helmets, and the
banners floating dimly on the twilight;
while now and then the blast of a distant
trumpet echoed along the defile, and the
signal was answered by a momentary clash
of arms. She looked with horror upon the
mountaineers, perched on the higher cliffs,
assailing the troops below with broken frag‚à£ments
of the mountain; on soldiers and
elephants tumbling headlong down the
lower precipices; and, as she listened to the
rebounding rocks, that followed their fall,
the terrors of fancy yielded to those of rea‚à£lity,
and she shuddered to behold herself on
the dizzy height, whence she had pictured
the descent of others.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni, meantime, as she look‚à£ed
upon Italy, was contemplating in ima‚à£gination
the splendour of palaces and the
grandeur of castles, such as she belived she
was going to be mistress of at Venice and
in the Apennine, and she became, in idea,
little less then princess. Being no longer
under the alarms which had deterred her
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
from giving entertainments to the beauties
of Tholouse, whom Montoni had mentioned
with more <HI>eclat</HI> to his own vanity than
credit to their discretion, or regard to truth,
she determined to give concerts, though she
had neither ear nor taste for music; <HI>conver‚à£sazioni,</HI>
though she had no talents for con‚à£versation;
and to outvie, if possible, in the
gaieties of her parties and the magnificence
of her liveries, all the noblesse of Venice.
This blissful reverie was somewhat obscured,
when she recollected the signor, her hus‚à£band
who, though he was not averse to
the profit which sometimes results from such
parties, had always shewn a contempt of
the frivolous parade that sometimes attends
them; till she considered that his pride
might be gratified by displaying, among
his own friends, in his native city, the
wealth which he had neglected in France;
and she courted again the splendid illusions
that had charmed her before.</P>
<P>The travellers, as they descended, gradu‚à£ally,
exchanged the region of winter for the
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
genial warmth and beauty of spring. The
sky began to assume that serene and beauti‚à£ful
tint peculiar to the climate of Italy;
patches of young verdure, fragrant shrubsand
flowers looked gaily among the rocks, often
fringing their rugged brows, or hanging in
tufts from their broken sides; and the buds
of the oak and mountain ash were expand‚à£ing
into foliage. Descending lower, the
orange and the myrtle, every now and then,
appeared in some sunny nook, with their
yellow blossoms peeping from among the
dark green of their leaves, and mingling
with the scarlet flowers of the pomegranate
and the paler ones of that arbutus, that ran
mantling to the crags above; while, lower
still, spread the pastures of piedmont, where
early flocks were cropping the luxuriant
herbage of spring.</P>
<P>The river Doria, which, rising on the
summit of Mount Cenis, had dashed for
many leagues over the precipices that bor‚à£dered
the road, now began to assume a less
impetuous, though scarcely less romantic
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
character, as it approached the green vallies
of Piedmont, into which the travellers de‚à£scended
with the evening sun; and Emily
found herself once more amid the tranquil
beauty of pastoral scenery; among flocks
and herds, and slopes tufted with woods of
lively verdure and with beautiful shrubs,
such as she had often seen waving luxuri‚à£antly
over the alps above. The verdure of
the pasturage, now varied with the hues of
early flowers, among which were yellow ra‚à£nunculuses
and pansey violets of delicious
fragrance, she had never seen excelled.‚Äî
Emily almost wished to become a peasant of
Piedmont, to inhabit one of the pleasant of
embowered cottages which she saw peeping
beneath the cliffs, and to pass her careless
hours among these romantic landscapes.
To the hours, the months, she was to pass
under the dominion of Montoni, she looked
with apprehension; while those which were
departed she remembered with regret and
sorrow.</P>
<P>In the present scenes her fancy often
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
gave her the figure of Valancourt, whom
she saw on a point of the cliffs, gazing with
awe and admiration on the imagery around
him; or wandering pensively along the
vale below, frequently pausing to look
back upon the scenery, and then his coun‚à£tenance
glowing with the poet's fire, pur‚à£suing
his way to some overhanging height.
When she again considered the time and
the distance that were to separate them,
that every step she now took lengthened
this distance, her heart sunk, and the sur‚à£rounding
landscape charmed her no more.</P>
<P>The travellers, passing Novalesa, reached,
after the evening had closed, the small and
antient town of Susa, which had formerly
guarded this pass of the Alps into Pied‚à£mont.
The heights which command it
had, since the invention of artillery, ren‚à£dered
its fortifications useless; but these
romantic heights, seen by moon-light, with
the town below, surrounded by its walls
and watch-towers, and partially illumined,
exhibited an interesting picture to Emily.
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
Here they rested for the night at an inn,
which had little accommodation to boast
of; but the travellers brought with them
the hunger that gives delicious flavour to
the coarsest viands, and the weariness that
ensures repose; and here Emily first caught
a strain of Italian music, on Italian ground.
As she sat after supper at a little window,
that opened upon a country, observing
an effect of the moon-light on the broken
surface of the mountains, and remembering
that on such a night as this she once had
sat with her father and Valancourt, resting
upon a cliff of the Pyren√©es, she heard
from below the long-drawn notes of a vio‚à£lin,
of such tone and delicacy of expression,
as harmonized exactly with the tender
emotions she was indulging, and both
charmed and surprised her. Cavigni, who
approached the window, smiled at her
surprise. ‚ÄúThis is nothing extraordinary,‚Äù
said he, ‚Äúyou will hear the same, perhaps,
at every inn on our way. It is one of our
landlord's family who plays, I doubt not.‚Äù
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
Emily, as she listened, thought he could be
scarcely less than a professor of music
whom she heard; and the sweet and plain‚à£tive
strains soon lulled her into a reverie,
from which she was very unwillingly roused
by the raillery of Cavigni, and by the voice
of Montoni, who gave orders to a servant to
have the carriages ready at an early hour
on the following morning; and added,
that he meant to dine at Turin.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni was exceedingly re‚à£joiced
to be once more on level ground;
and, after giving a long detail of the vari‚à£ous
terrors she had suffered, which she for‚à£got
that she was describing to the compa‚à£nions
of her dangers, she added a hope, that
she should &amp; soon be beyond the view of these
horrid mountains, ‚Äúwhich all the world,‚Äù
said she, ‚Äúshould not tempt me to cross
again.‚Äù Complaining of fatigue she soon
retired to rest, and Emily withdrew to her
own room, when she understood from An‚à£nette,
her aunt's woman, that Cavigni was
nearly right in his conjecture concerning
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
the musician, who had awakened the violin
with so much taste, for that he was the son
of a peasant, inhabiting the neighbouring
valley, ‚ÄúHe is going to the Carnival at
Venice,‚Äù added Annette, ‚Äúfor they say he
has a fine hand at playing, and will get a
world of money; and the Carnival is just
going to begin: but for my part, I should
like to live among these pleasant woods and
hills, better than in a town; and they say
Ma'moiselle, we shall see no woods, or hills,
or fields, at Venice, for that it is built in
the very middle of the sea.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily agreed with the talkative Annette,
that this young man was making a change
for the worse, and could not for bear silently
lamenting, that he should be drawn from
the innocence and beauty of these scenes,
to the corrupt ones of the voluptuous
city.</P>
<P>When she was alone, unable to sleep, the
landscapes of her native home, with Valan‚à£court,
and the circumstances of her depar‚à£ture,
haunted her fancy; she drew pictures
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
of social happiness amidst the grand simpli‚à£city
of nature, such as she feared she had
bade farewel to for ever; and then, the idea
of this young Piedmontese, thus ignorantly
sporting with his happiness, returned to her
thoughts, and, glad to escape awhile from
the pressure of nearer interests, she indulged
her fancy in composing the following lines.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>THE PIEDMONTESE.</HEAD>
<L>Ah, merry swain, who laugh'd along the vales,</L>
<L>And with your gay pipe made the mountains ring,</L>
<L>Why leave your cot, your woods, and thymy gales,</L>
<L>And friends belov'd, for aught that wealth can
bring?</L>
<L>He goes to wake o'er moon-light seas the string,</L>
<L>Venetian gold his untaught fancy hails!</L>
<L>Yet oft of home his simple carols sing,</L>
<L>And his steps pause, as the last Alp he scales.</L>
<L>Once more he turns to view his native scene‚Äî</L>
<L>Far, far below, as roll the clouds away,</L>
<L>He spies his cabin 'mid the pine-tops green,</L>
<L>The well-known woods, clear brook, and pastures
gay;</L>
<L>And thinks of friends and parents left behind,</L>
<L>Of sylvan revels, dance, and festive song;</L>
<L>And hears the faint reed swelling in the wind;</L>
<L>And his sad sighs the distant notes prolong!</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>
Thus went the swain, till mountain-shadows fell,</L>
<L>And dimm'd the landscape to his aching fight;</L>
<L>And must he leave the vales he loves so well?</L>
<L>Can foreign wealth, and shows, his heart delight?</L>
<L>No, happy vales! your wild rocks still shall hear</L>
<L>His pipe, light founding on the morning breeze;</L>
<L>Still shall he lead the flocks to streamlet clear,</L>
<L>And watch at eve beneath the western trees.</L>
<L>Away, Venetian gold‚Äîyour charm is o'er!</L>
<L>And now his swift step seeks the lowland bow'rs,</L>
<L>Where, through the leaves, his cottage light <HI>once
more</HI></L>
<L>Guides him to happy friends, and jocund hours.</L>
<L>Ah, merry swain! that laugh along the vales,</L>
<L>And with your gay pipe make the mountains ring,</L>
<L>Your cot, your woods, your thymy- scented gales‚Äî</L>
<L>And friends belov'd‚Äîmore joy than wealth can
bring!</L>

<BIBL>MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.</BIBL></Q>
<P>EARLY on the following morning, the
travellers set out for Turin. The luxu‚à£riant
plain, that extends from the feet of
the Alps to that magnificent city, was not
then, as now, shaded by an avenue of trees
nine miles in length; but plantations of
olives, mulberry and palms, festooned with
vines, mingled with the pastoral scenery,
through which the rapid Po, after its de‚à£scent
from the mountains, wandered to meet
the humble Doria at Turin. As they ad‚à£vanced
towards this city, the Alps, seen at
some distance, began to appear in all their
awful sublimity; chain rising over chain
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
in long succession, their higher points dark‚à£ened
by the hovering clouds, sometimes
hid, and at others seen shooting up far above
them; while their lower steeps, broken into
fantastic forms, were touched with blue and
purplish tints, which, as they changed in
light and shade, seemed to open new scenes
to the eye. To the east stretched the plains
of Lombardy, with the towers of Turin
rising at a distance; and beyond, the Apen‚à£nines,
bounding the horizon.</P>
<P>The general magnificence of that city,
with its vistas of churches and palaces,
branching from the grand square, each
opening to a landscape of the distant Alps
or Apennines, was not only such as Emily
had never seen in France, but such as she
had never imagined.</P>
<P>Montoni, who had been often at Turin,
and cared little about views of any kind,
did not comply with his wife's request,
that they might survey some of the palaces;
but staying only till the necessary refresh‚à£ments
could be obtained, they set forward
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
for Venice with all possible rapidity. Mon‚à£toni's
manner, during this journey, was
grave, and even haughty; and towards Ma‚à£dame
Montoni he was more especially re‚à£served;
but it was not the reserve of respec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>
so much as of pride and discontent. Of
Emily he took little notice. With Cavigni
his conversations were commonly on politi‚à£cal
or military topics, such as the convulsed
state of their country rendered at this time
particularly interesting. Emily observed,
that, at the mention of any daring exploit,
Montoni's eyes lost their sullenness, and
seemed instantaneously to gleam, with fire;
yet they still retained somewhat of a lurking
cunning, and she sometimes thought that
their fire partook more of the glare of malice
than the brightness of valour, though the
latter would well have harmonized with the
high chivalric air of his figure, in which
Cavigni, with all his gay and gallant man‚à£ners,
was his inferi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>r.</P>
<P>On entering the Milanese, the gentle‚à£men
exchanged their French hats for the
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
Italian cap of scarlet cloth, embroidered;
and Emily was somewhat surprised to ob‚à£serve,
that Montoni added to his the mili‚à£tary
plume, while Cavigni retained only the
feather: which was usually worn with such
caps: but she at length concluded, that
Montoni assumed this ensign of a soldier
for convenience, as a means of passing with
more safety through a country over-run
with parties of the military.</P>
<P>Over the beautiful plains of this country
the devastations of war were frequently visi‚à£ble.
Where the lands had not been suffered
to lie uncultivated, they were often tracked
with the steps of the spoiler; the vines were
torn down from the branches that had sup‚à£ported
them, the olives trampled upon the
ground, and even the groves of mulberry
trees had been hewn by the enemy to light
fires that destroyed the hamlets and villages
of their owners. Emily turned her eyes
with a sigh from these painful vestiges of
contention, to the Alps of the Grison,
that overlooked them to the north, whose
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
awful solitudes seemed to offer to persecuted
man a secure asylum.</P>
<P>The travellers frequently distinguished
troops of soldiers moving at a distance;
and they experienced, at the little inns on
the road, the scarcity of provision and
other inconveniencies, which are a part of
the consequence of intestine war; but they
had never reason to be much alarmed for
their immediate safety, and they passed on
to Milan with little interruption of any
kind, where they staid not to survey the
grandeur of the city, or even to view its
vast cathedral, which was then building.</P>
<P>Beyond Milan, the country wore the
aspect of a ruder devastation; and though
every thing seemed now quiet, the repose
was like that of death, spread over features,
which retain the impression of the last con‚à£vulsions.</P>
<P>It was not till they had passed the eastern
limits of the Milanese, that the travellers
saw any troops since they had left Milan,
when, as the evening was drawing to a
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
close, they descried what appeared to be an
army winding onward along the distant
plains, whose spears and other arms caught
the last rays of the sun. As the column
advanced through a part of the road, con‚à£tracted
between two hillocks, some of the
commanders, on horseback, were distin‚à£guished
on a small eminence, pointing and
making signals for the march; while seve‚à£ral
of the officers were riding along the
line directing its progress, according to the
signs communicated by those above; and
others, separating from the vanguard, which
had emerged from the pass, were riding
carelessly along the plains, at some distance
to the right of the army.</P>
<P>As they drew nearer, Montoni, distin‚à£guishing
the feathers that waved in their
caps, and the banners and liveries of the
bands that followed them, thought he knew
this to be the small army commanded by
the famous captain Utaldo, with whom,
as well as with some of the other chiefs,
he was personally acquainted. He, there‚à£fore
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
gave orders that the carriages should
draw up by the side of the road, to await
their arrival, and give them the pass. A
faint strain of martial music now stole by,
and, gradually strengthening as the troops
approached, Emily distinguished the drums
and trumpets, with the clash of cymbals and
of arms, that were struck by a small party,
in time to the march.</P>
<P>Montoni being now certain that these
were the bands of the victorious Utaldo,
leaned from the carriage window, and
hailed their general by waving his cap in
the air; which compliment the chief re‚à£turned
by raising his spear, and then letting
it down again suddenly, while some of his
officers, who were riding at a distance from
the troops, came up to the carriage, and
saluted Montoni as an old acquaintance.
The captain himself soon after arriving, his
bands halted while he conversed with
Montoni, whom he appeared much re‚à£joiced
to see and from what he said, Emily
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
understood that this was a victorious army,
r√©turning into their own principality; while
the numerous waggons, that accompanied
them, contained the rich spoils of the ene‚à£my,
their own wounded soldiers, and the
prisoners they had taken in battle, who were
to be ransomed when the peace, then ne‚à£gociating
between the neighbouring states,
should be ratified. The chiefs on the fol‚à£lowing
day were to separate, and each,
taking his share of the spoil, was to return
with his own band to his castle. This was
therefore to be an evening of uncommon
and general festivity, in commemoration
of the victory they had accomplished
together, and of the farewell which the
commanders were about to take of each
other.</P>
<P>Emily, as these officers conversed with
Montoni, observed with admiration, tinc‚à£tured
with awe, their high martial air,
mingled with the haughtiness of the no‚à£blesse
of those days, and heightened by the
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
gallantry of their dress, by the plumes
towering on their caps, the armorial coat,
Persian sash, and ancient Spanish cloak.
Utaldo telling Montoni that his army were
going to encamp for the night near a village
at only a few miles distance, invited him.
to turn back and partake of their festivity,
assuring the ladies also, that they should be
pleasantly accommodated; but Montoni
excused himself, adding, that it was his de‚à£sign
to reach Verona that evening; and, af‚à£ter
some conversation concerning the state of
the country towards that city, they parted.</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded without any in‚à£terruption;
but it was some hours after sun‚à£set
before they arrived at Verona, whose
beautiful environs were therefore not seen
by Emily till the following morning; when,
leaving that pleasant town at an early hour,
they set off for Padua, where they em‚à£barked
on the Brenta for Venice. Here
the scene was entirely changed; no vestiges
of war, such as had deformed the plains of
the Milanese, appeared; on the contrary,
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
all was peace and elegance. The verdant
banks of the Brenta exhibited a continued
landscape of beauty, gaiety, and splendour.
Emily gazed with admiration on the villas
of the Venetian noblesse, with their cool
porticos and colonnades, overhung with
poplars and cypresses of majestic height
and lively verdure; on their rich orangeries,
whose blossoms perfumed the air, and on
the luxuriant willows, that dipped their
light leaves in the wave, and sheltered from
the fun the gay parties whose music came
at intervals on the breeze. The Carnival
did, indeed, appear to extend from Venice
along the whole line of these enchanting
shores; the river was gay with boats pass‚à£ing
to that city, exhibiting the fantastic
diversity of a masquerade in the dresses
of the people within them; and, towards
evening, groups of dancers frequently
were seen beneath the trees.</P>
<P>Cavigni, meanwhile, informed her of the
names of the noblemen to whom the seve‚à£ral
villas they passed belonged, adding light
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
sketches of their characters, such as served
to amuse rather than to inform, exhibiting
his own wit instead of the delineation of
truth. Emily was sometimes diverted by
his conversation; but his gaiety did not
entertain Madame Montoni, as it had for‚à£merly
dOne; she was frequently grave, and
Montoni retained his usual reserve.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed Emily's admira‚à£tion,
on her first view of Venice, with its
islets, palaces, and towers rising out of the
sea, whose clear surface reflected the tremu‚à£lous
picture in all its colours. The fun,
sinking in the west, tinted the waves and
the lofty mountains of Friuli, which skirt
the northern shores of the Adriatic, with a
saffron glow, while on the marble porticos
and colonnades of St. Mark were thrown
the rich lights and shades of evening. As
they glided on, the grander features of this
city appeared more distinctly: its terraces,
crowned with airy yet majestic fabrics,
touched, as they now were, with the splen‚à£dour
of the setting sun, appeared as if they
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
had been called up from the ocean by the
wand of an enchanter, rather than reared by
mortal hands.</P>
<P>The sun, soon after, sinking to the lower
world, the shadow of the earth stole gradu‚à£ally
over the waves, and then up the tower‚à£ing
sides of the mountains of Friuli, till it
extinguished even the last upward beams
that had lingered on their fummits, and
the melancholy purple of evening drew over
them, like a thin veil. How deep, how
beautiful was the tranquillity that wrapped
the scene! All nature seemed to repose; the
finest emotions of the foul were alone awake.
Emily's eyes filled with tears of admira‚à£tion
and sublime devotion, as she raised
them over the sleeping world to the vast
heavens, and heard the notes of solemn
music, that stole over the waters from a
distance. She listened in still rapture, and
no person of the party broke the charm by
an enquiry, The sounds seemed to grow
on the air; for so smoothly did the barge
glide along, that its motion was not per‚à£ceivable,
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
and the fairy city appeared ap‚à£proaching
to welcome the strangers. They
now distinguished a female voice, accom‚à£panied
by a few instruments, singing a soft
and mournful air; and its fine expression,
as sometimes it seemed pleading with the
impassioned tenderness of love, and then
languishing into the cadence of hopeless
grief, declared, that it flowed from no
feigned sensibility. Ah! thought Emily,
as she sighed and remembered Valancourt,
those strains come from the heart!</P>
<P>She looked round, with anxious enquiry;
the deep twilight, that had fallen over the
scene, admitted only imperfect images to
the eye, but, at some distance on the sea, she
thought she perceived a gondola: a chorus
of voices and instruments now swelled on
the air‚Äîso sweet, so solemn! it seemed like
the hymn of angels descending through the
silence of night! Now it died away, and
fancy almost beheld the holy choir re‚à£ascending
towards heaven; then again it
swelled with the breeze, trembled awhile,
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
and again died into silence. It brought to
Emily's recollection some lines of her late
father, and she repeated in a low voice,
<Q><L>‚ÄîOft I hear,</L>
<L>Upon the silence of the midnight air,</L>
<L>Celestial voices swell in holy chorus</L>
<L>That bears the soul to heaven!</L></Q></P>
<P>The deep stillness, that succeeded, was as
expressive as the strain that had just ceased.
It was uninterrupted for several minutes, till
a general sigh seemed to release the company
from their enchantment. Emily, however,
long indulged the pleasing sadness, that
had stolen upon her spirits; but the gay
and busy scene that appeared, as the barge
approached St. Mark's Place, at length
roused her attention. The rising moon,
which threw a shadowy light upon the ter‚à£races,
and illumined the porticos and mag‚à£nificent
arcades that crowned them, dis‚à£covered
the various company, whose light
steps, soft guitars, and softer voices, echoed
through the colonnades.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41"/>
The music they heard before now passed
Montoni's barge, in one of the gondolas,
of which several were seen skimming along
the moon-light sea, full of gay parties
catching the cool breeze. Most of these
had music, made sweeter by the waves over
which it floated, and by the measured
sound of oars, as they dashed the sparkling
tide. Emily gazed, and listened, and
thought herself in a fairy scene; even Ma‚à£dame
Montoni was pleased; Montoni con‚à£gratulated
himself on his return to Venice,
which he called the first city in the world,
and Cavigni was more gay and animated
than ever.</P>
<P>The barge passed on to the grand canal,
where Montoni's mansion was situated.
And here, other forms of beauty and of
grandeur, such as her imagination had ne‚à£ver
painted, were unfolded to Emily in
the palaces of Sansvino and Palladio,
as she glided along the waves. The air
bore no sounds, but those of sweetness,
echoing along each margin of the canal,
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
and from gondolas on its surface, while
groups of masks were seen dancing on
the moonlight terraces, and seemed almost
to realize the romance of fairy-land.</P>
<P>The barge stopped before the portico of
a large house, from whence a servant of
Montoni crossed the terrace, and imme‚à£diately
the party disembarked. From the
portico they passed a noble hall to a stair‚à£case
of marble, which led to a saloon, fitted
Up in a style of magnificence That surprised
Emily. The walls and ceiling were adorned
with historical and allegorical paintings,
in <HI>fresco;</HI> silver tripods, depending from
chains of the same metal, illumined the
apartment, the floor of which was covered
with Indian mats painted in a variety of
colours and devices; the couches and dra‚à£pery
of the lattices were of pale green silk,
embroidered and fringed with green and
gold. Balcony lattices opened upon the
grand canal, whence rose a confusion of
voices and of musical instruments, and the
breeze that gave freshness to the apartment.
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
Emily, considering the gloomy temper of
Montoni, looked upon the splendid furni‚à£ture
of his house with surprise, and
remembered the report of his being a man of
broken fortune, with astonishment. ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù
said she to herself, ‚Äúif Valancourt could
but see this mansion, what peace would it
give him! He would then be convinced
that the report was groundless.‚Äù</P>
<P>Madame Montoni seemed to assume the
airs of a princess; but Montoni was rest‚à£less
and discontented, and did not even ob‚à£serve
the civility of bidding her welcome
to her home.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival, he ordered his gon‚à£dola,
and, with Cavigni, went out to mingle
in the scenes of the evening. Madame
then became serious and thoughtful. Emily,
who was charmed with every thing she saw,
endeavoured to enliven her; but reflection
had not, with Madame Montoni, subdued
caprice and ill-humour, and her answers
discovered so much of both, that Emily
gave up the attempt of diverting her, and
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
withdrew to a lattice, to amuse herself
with the scene without, so new and so en‚à£chanting.</P>
<P>The first object that attracted her notice
was a group of dancers on the terrace be‚à£low,
led by a guitar, and some other in‚à£struments.
The girl, who struck the gui‚à£tar,
and another, who flourished a tambo‚à£rine,
passed on in a dancing step, and with
a light grace and gaiety of heart, that Would
have subdued the goddess of spleen in her
worst humour. After these came a group
of fantastic figures, some dressed as gondo‚à£lieri,
others as minstrels, while others seemed
to defy all description. They sung in parts,
their voices accompanied by a few soft in‚à£struments.
At a little distance from the
portico they stopped, and Emily distin‚à£guished
the verses of Ariosto. They sung
of the wars of the Moors against Charle‚à£magne,
and then of the woes of Orlando:
afterwards the measure changed, and the
melancholy sweetness of Petrarch succeeded.
The magic of his grief was assisted by all
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
that Italian music and Italian expression,
heightened by the enchantments of Vene‚à£tian
moonlight, could give.</P>
<P>Emily, as she listened, caught the pensive
enthusiasm; her tears flowed silently, while
her fancy bore her far away to France and
to Valancourt. Each succeeding sonnet,
more full of charming sadness than the last,
seemed to bind the spell of melancholy:
with extreme regret she saw the musicians
move on, and her attention followed the
strain till the last faint warble died in air.
She then remained sunk in that pensive
tranquillity which soft music leaves on the
mind‚Äîa state like that produced by the
view of a beautiful landscape by moon‚à£light,
or by the recollection of scenes
marked with the tenderness of friends lost
for ever, and with sorrows, which time has
mellowed into mild regret. Such scenes
are indeed, to the mind, like ‚Äúthose faint
traces which the memory bears of music
that is past.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46"/>
Other sounds soon awakened her atten‚à£tion:
it was the solemn harmony of horns,
that swelled from a distance; and, observing
the gondolas arrange themselves along the
margin of the terraces, she threw on her veil,
and, stepping into the balcony, discerned,
in the distant perspective of the canal,
something like a procession, floating on the
light surface of the water: as it approached,
the horns and other instruments mingled
sweetly, and soon after the fabled deities of
the city seemed to have arisen from the
ocean; for Neptune, with Venice personi‚à£fied
as his queen, came on the undulating
waves, surrounded by tritons and sea‚à£nymphs.
The fantastic splendour of this
spectacle, together with the grandeur of the
surrounding palaces, appeared like the vi‚à£sion
of a poet suddenly embodied, and the
fanciful images, which it awakened in
Emily's mind, lingered there long after the
procession had passed away. She indulged
herself in imagining what might be the
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
manners and delights of a sea-nymph, till
she almost wished to throw off the habit of
mortality, and plunge into the green wave
to participate them.</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow delightful,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúto live
amidst the coral bowers and crystal caverns
of the ocean, with my sister nymphs, and
listen to the sounding waters above, and to
the soft shells of the tritons! and then,
after sun-set, to skim on the surface of the
waves round wild rocks and along seques‚à£tered
shores, where, perhaps, some pensive
wanderer comes to weep! Then would I
sooth his sorrows with my sweet music,
and offer him from a shell some of the de‚à£licious
fruit that hangs round Neptune's
palace.‚Äù</P>
<P>She was recalled from her reverie to a
mere mortal supper, and could not forbear
smiling at the fancies she had been indulg‚à£ing,
and at her conviction of the serious
displeasure, which Madame Montoni would
have expressed, could she have been made
acquainted with them.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>
After supper, her aunt sat late but Montoni
did not return, and she at length retired to
rest. If Emily had admired the magnificence
of the saloon, she was not less surprised,
on observing the half-furnished and forlorn
appearance of the apartments she passed in
the way to her chamber, whither she went
through long suites of noble rooms, that
seemed, from their desolate aspect, to have
been unoccupied for many years. On the
walls of some were the faded remains of ta‚à£pestry;
from others, painted in <HI>fresco,</HI> the
damps had almost withdrawn both co‚à£lours
and design. At length she reached
her own chamber, spacious, desolate, and
lofty, like the rest, with high lattices that
opened towards the Adriatic. It brought
gloomy images to her mind, but the view of
the Adriatic soon gave her others more airy,
among which was that of the sea-nymph,
whose delights she had before amused her‚à£self
with picturing; and, anxious to escape
from serious reflections, she now endea‚à£voured
to throw her fanciful ideas into a
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
train, and concluded the hour with com‚à£posing
the following lines:</P>

<P>MONTONI and his companion did not
return home, till many hours after the dawn
had blushed upon the Adriatic. The airy
groups, which had danced all night along
the colonnade of St. Mark, dispersed before
the morning, like so many spirits. Mon‚à£toni
had been otherwise engaged; his soul
was little susceptible of light pleasures.
He delighted in the energies of the passions;
the difficulties and tempests of life, which
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
wreck the happiness of others, roused and
strengthened all the powers of his mind,
and afforded him the highest enjoyments,
of which his nature was capable. With‚à£out
some object of strong interest, life
was to him little more than a sleep; and,
when pursuits of real interest failed, he
substituted artificial ones, till habit chang‚à£ed
their nature, and they ceased to be
unreal. Of this kind was the habit of
gaming, which he had adopted, first,
for the purpose of relieving him from the
languor of inaction, but had since pursued
with the ardour of passion. In this occu‚à£pation
he had passed the night with Ca‚à£vigni
and a party of young men, who had
more money than rank, and more vice than
either. Montoni despised the greater part
of these for the inferiority of their talents,
rather than for their vicious inclinations,
and associated with them only to make
them the instruments of his purposes.
Among these, however, were some of supe‚à£rior
abilities, and a few whom Montoni
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
admitted to his intimacy, but even towards
these he still preserved a decisive and haughty
air, which, while it imposed submission on
weak and timid minds, roused the fierce
hatred of strong ones. He had, of course,
many and bitter enemies; but the rancour
of their hatred proved the degree of his
power; and, as power was his chief aim,
he gloried more in such hatred, than it was
possible he could in being esteemed. A
feeling so tempered as that of esteem, he
despised, and would have despised himself
also had he thought himself capable of be‚à£ing
flattered by it.</P>
<P>Among the few whom he distinguished,
were the Signors Bertolini, Orsino, and Ve‚à£rezzi.
The first was a man of a gay temper,
strong passions, dissipated, and of unbound‚à£ed
extravagance, but generous, brave, and
unsuspicious. Orsino was reserved, and
haughty; loving power more than ostenta‚à£tion;
of a cruel and suspicious temper;
quick to feel an injury, and relentless in
avenging it; cunning and unsearchable in
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
contrivance, patient and indefatigable in
the execution of his schemes. He had a
perfect command of feature and of his
passion, of which he had scarcely any, but
pride, revenge and avarice; and, in the
gratification of these, few considerations had
power to restrain him, few obstacles to
withstand the depth of his stratagems. This
man was the chief favourite of Montoni.
Verezzi was a man of some talent, of fiery
imagination, and the slave of alternate
passions. He was gay, voluptuous, and
daring; yet had neither perseverance or
true courage, and was meanly selfish in all
his aims. Quick to form schemes, and san‚à£guine
in his hope of success, he was the first
to undertake, and to ab√†ndon, not only his
own plans, but those adopted from other
persons. Proud and impetuous, he revolted
against all subordination; yet those who
were acquainted with his character, and
watched the turn of his passions, could lead
him like a child.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58"/>
Such were the friends whom Montoni in‚à£troduced
to his family and his table, on the
day after his arrival at Venice. There were
also of the party a Venetian nobleman,
Count Morano, and a Signora Livona,
whom Montoni had introduced to his wife,
as a lady of distinguished merit, and who,
having called in the morning to welcome
her to Venice, had been requested to be
of the dinner party.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni received, with a very
ill grace, the compliments of the Signors.
She disliked them, because they were the
friends of her husband; hated them, because
she believed they had contributed to detain
him abroad till so late an hour of the
preceding morning; and envied them, since,
conscious of her own want of influence, she
was convinced, that he preferred their society
to her own. The rank of Count Morano pro‚à£cured
him that distinction which she refus‚à£ed
to the rest of the company. The haughty
sullenness of her countenance and manner,
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
and the ostentatious extravagance of her
dress, for she had not yet adopted the Vene‚à£tian
habit, were strikingly contrasted by the
beauty, modesty, sweetness and simplicity
of Emily, who observed, with more atten‚à£tion
than pleasure, the party around her.
The beauty and fascinating manners of
Signora Livona, however, won her invo‚à£luntary
regard; while the sweetness of her
accents and her air of gentle kindness
awakened with Emily those pleasing affec‚à£tions,
which so long had slumbered.</P>
<P>In the cool of the evening the par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>y em‚à£barked
in Montoni's gondola, and rowed
out upon the sea. The red glow of sun‚à£set
still touched the waves, and lingered in
the west, where the melancholy gleam
seemed slowly expiring, while the dark blue
of the upper aether began to twinkle with
stars. Emily sat, given up to pensive and
sweet emotions. The smoothness of
the water, over which she glided, its reflected
images‚Äîa new heaven and trembling stars
below the waves, with shadowy outlines of
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
towers and porticos, conspired with the
stillness of the hour, interrupted only by
the passing wave, or the notes of distant
music, to raise those emotions to enthusiasm.
As she listened to the measured sound of the
oars, and to the remote warblings that came
in the breeze, her softened mind returned
to the memory of St. Aubert and to Valan‚à£court,
and tears stole to her eyes.
The rays of the moon, strengthening as the sha‚à£dows
deepened, soon after threw a silvery
gleam upon her countenance, which was
partly shaded by a thin black veil, and
touched in with inimitable softness. Hers
was the <HI>contour</HI> of a Madona, with the
sensibility of a Magdalen; and the pensive
uplifted eye, with the tear that glittered on
her cheek, confirmed the expression of the
character.</P>
<P>The last strain of distant music now died
in air, for the gondola was far upon the
waves, and the party determined to have
music of their own. The Count Morano,
who sat next to Emily, and who had been
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
observing her for some time in silence,
snatched up a lute, and struck the chords
with finger of harmony herself, while
his voice, a fine tenor, accompanied them
in a rondeau full of tender sadness. To
him, indeed, might have been applied that
beautiful exhortation of an English poet,
had it than existed:
<Q><L>‚Äî‚ÄúStrike up, my master,</L>
<L>But touch the strings with a religious softness!</L>
<L>Teach sounds to languish through the night's dull ear</L>
<L>Till Melacholy starts from off her couch,</L>
<L>And Carelessness grows concert to attention!‚Äù</L></Q>
With such powers of expression the Count
sung the following,</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RONDEAU</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Soft as you silver ray, that sleeps</L>
<L>Upon the ocean's trembling tide;</L>
<L>Soft as the air, that lightly sweeps</L>
<L>Yon sail, that swells in stately pride;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soft as the surge's stealing note,</L>
<L>That dies along the distant shores,</L>
<L>Or warbled strain, that sinks remote‚Äî</L>
<L>So soft the sigh my bosom pours!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
<L>True as the wave to Cynthia's ray,</L>
<L>True as the vessel to the breeze,</L>
<L>True as the soul to music's sway,</L>
<L>Or music to Venetian seas:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soft as you silver beams, that sleep</L>
<L>Upon the ocean's trembling breast;</L>
<L>So soft, so true, fond Love shall weep,</L>
<L>so soft, so true, with <HI>thee</HI> shall rest.</L>
</LG>
<P>The cadence with which he returned
from the last stanza to a pepetition of the
first; the fine modulation in which his
voice stole upon the first line, and the pa‚à£thetic
enrgy with which it pronounced the
last, were such as only exquisite taste could
give. When he had concluded, he gave
the lute with a sigh to Emily, who, to avoid
any appearance of affectation, immediately
began to play. she sung a melancholy
little air, one of the popular songs of her
native province, with a simplicity and pa‚à£thos
that made it enchanting. But its
well-known melody brought so forcibly to
her fancy the scenes and the persons, among
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
which she had often heard it, that her spi‚à£rits
were overcome, her voice trembled and
ceased‚Äîand the strings of the lute were
struck with a disordered hand; till, ashamed
of the emotion she betrayed, she sud‚à£denly
passed on to a song so gay and ariy,
that the steps of the dance seemed almost
to echo to the notes. <HI>Bravissimo!</HI>
burst instantly from the lips of her delighted
auditors, and she was compelled to repeat
the air. Among the compliments that fol‚à£lowed,
those of the Count were not the least
audible, and they had not concluded,
when Emily gave the instrument to Signora
Livona, whose voice accompanied it with
true Italian taste.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Count, Emily, Cavigni,
and the Signora, sung <HI>canzonettes,</HI> accom‚à£panied
by a couple of lutes and a few other
instruments. sometimes the instruments
suddenly ceased, and the voices dropped
from the full swell of harmony into a low
chant; then, after a deep pause, they rose
by degrees, the instruments one by one
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
striking up, till the loud and full chorus
foared again to heaven!</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Montoni, who was weary of
this harmony, was considering how he
might disengage himself from his party,
or withdraw with such of it as would be
willing to play, to a Casino. In a pause of
the music, he proposed returning to shore,
but which the Count and the other gentle‚à£men
as warmly opposed.</P>
<P>Montoni still meditated how he might
excuse himself from longer attendance upon
the Count, for to him only he thought ex‚à£cuse
necessary, and how he might get to
land, till the gondolieri of an empty boat,
returning to Venice, hailed his people.
Without troubling himself logner about
an excuse, he seized this opportunity of
going thither, and, committing the ladies to
the care of his friends, departed with Or‚à£sino,
while Emily, for the first time, saw
him go with regret; for she considered
his presence a protection, though she knew
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
not what she should fear. He landed at
St. Mark's and, hurrying to a Casino, was
soon lost amidst a crowd of gamesters.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Count having secretly
dispatched a servant in Montoni's boat, for
his own gondola and musicians, Emily
heard, without knowing his project, the
gay song of gondolieri approaching, as
they sat on teh stern of the boat, and saw
the tremulous gleam of the moon light
wave, which their oars disturbed. Presently
she heard the sound of instruments, and
then a full symphony swelled on the air,
and, the boats meeting, the gondolieri hail‚à£ed
each other. The Count then explaining
himself, the party removed into his gondola,
which was embellished with all that taste
could bestow.</P>
<P>While they partook of a collation of
fruits and ice, the whole band, follow‚à£ing
at a distance, in the other boat,
played the most sweet and enchanting
strains, and the Count, who had again seated
himself by Emily, paid her unremitted at‚à£tention,
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
and sometimes, in a low but im‚à£passioned
voice, uttered compliments which
she could not misunderstand. To avoid
them she conversed with Signora Livona,
and her manner to the Count assumed a
mild reserve, which, though dignified, was
too gentle to repress his assiduities: he
could see, hear, speak to no person, but
Emily, while Cavigni observed him now
and then, with a look of displeasure, and
Emily, with one of uneasiness. She now
wished for nothing so much as to return to
Venice, but it was near midnight before the
gondolas approached St. Mark's Place,
where the voice of gaiety and song was
loud. The busy hum of mingling sounds
was heard at a considerable distance on the
water, and, had not a bright moon-light
discovered the city, with its terraces and
towers, a stranger would almost have
credited the fabled wonders of Neptune's
court, and believed, that the tumult arose
from beneath the waves.</P>
<P>They landed at St. Mark's, where the
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
gai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>ty of the colonnades and the beauty of
the night, made Madame Montoni willing‚à£ly
submit to the Count's solicitations to join
the promenade, and afterwards to take a sup‚à£per
with the rest of the party, at his Casino.
If any thing could have dissipated Emily's
uneasiness, it would have been the gran‚à£deur,
gaiety, and novelty of the surrounding
scene, adorned with Palladio's palaces,
and busy with parties of masqueraders.</P>
<P>At length they withdrew to the Casino,
which was fitted up with infinite taste, and
where a splendid banquet was prepared;
but here Emily's reserve made the Count
perceive, that it was necessary for his interest
to win the favour of Madame Montoni,
which, from the condescension she had al‚à£ready
shewn to him, appeared to be an
achievement of no great difficulty. He
transferred, therefore, part of his attention
from Emily to her aunt, who felt too much
flattered by the distinction even to disguise
her emotion; and, before the party broke
up, he had entirely engaged the esteem of
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
Madame Montoni. Whenever he addressed
her, her ungracious countenance relaxed
into smiles, and to whatever he proposed
she assented. He invited her, with the rest
of the party, to take coffee, in his box at the
opera,, on the following evening, and Emily
heard the invitation accepted, with strong
anxiety, concerning the means of excusing
herself from attending Madame Montoni thither.</P>
<P>It was very late before their gondola was
ordered, and Emily's surprise was extreme,
when, on quitting the Casino, she beheld
the broad sun rising out of the Adriatic,
while St. Mark's Place was yet crowded
with company. Sleep had long weighed
heavily on her eyes, but now the fresh sea‚à£breeze
revived her, and she would have
quitted the scene with regret, had not the
Count been present, performing the duty,
which he had imposed upon himself, of
escorting them home. There they heard
that Montoni was not yet returned; and
his wife, retiring in displeasure to her apart‚à£ment,
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
at length released. Emily from the
fatigue of further attendance.</P>
<P>Montoni came home late in the morn‚à£ing,
in a very ill humour, having lost con‚à£siderably
at play, and, before he withdrew
to rest, had a private conference with Ca‚à£vigni,
whose manner, on the following day,
seemed to tell, that the subject of it had not
bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/> leasing to him.</P>
<P>In the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="„Äà‚óä„Äâ"/>, Madame Montoni, who,
during the day, had observed a fullen silence
towards, her husband, received visits from
some Venetian ladies, with whose sweet
manners Emily was particularly charmed.
They had an air of ease and kindness to‚à£wards
the strangers, as if they had been their
familiar friends for years; and their con‚à£versation
was by turns tender, sentimental
and gay. Madame, though she had no
taste for such conversations and whose
coarseness and selfishness sometimes exhi‚à£bited
a ludicrous contrast to their excessive
refinement, could not remain wholly infen‚à£sible
to the captivations of their manner.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70"/>
In a pause of conversation, a lady who
was called Signora Herminia took up a
lute, and began to play and sing, with as
much easy gaiety, as if she had been alone.
Her voice was uncommonly rich in tone,
and various in expression; yet she appeared
to be entirely unconscious of its powers,
and meant nothing less than to display
them. She sung from the gaiety <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="„Äà‚óä„Äâ"/>
heart, as she sat with her veil <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="„Äà‚óä„Äâ"/>
back, holding gracefully the lute, under
the spreading foliage and flowers of some
plants, that rose from baskets, and inter‚à£laced
one of the lattices of the saloon.
Emily, retiring a little from the company,
sketched her figure, with the miniature
scenery around her, and drew a very in‚à£teresting
picture, which, though it would
not, perhaps, have borne criticism, had spi‚à£rit
and taste enough to awaken both the
fancy and the heart. When she had finish‚à£ed
it, she presented it to the beautiful ori‚à£ginal,
who was delighted with the offering,
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
as well as the sentiment it conveyed, and
assured Emily, with a smile of captivating
sweetness, that she should preserve ita as a
pledge of her friendship.</P>
<P>In the evening Cavigni joined the ladies,
but Montoni had other engagements; and
they embarked in the gondola for St.
Mark's, where the same gay company
seemed to flutter as on the preceding night.
The cool breeze, the glassy sea, the gentle
sound of its waves, and the sweeter mur‚à£mur
of distant music; the lofty porticos and
arcades, and the happy groups that saun‚à£tered
beneath them; these, with every fea‚à£ture
and circumstance of the scene, united
to charm Emily, no longer teased by the
officious attentions of Count Morano. But,
as she looked upon the moon-light sea, un‚à£dulating
along the walls of St. Mark, and,
lingering for a moment over those walls,
caught the sweet and melancholy song of
some gondolier as he sat in his boat below,
waiting for his master, her softened mind
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
returned to the memory of her home, of
her friends, and of all that was dear in her
native country.</P>
<P>After wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>king some time, they sat down at
the door of a Casino, and, while Cavigni was
accommodating them with coffee and ice,
were joined by Count Morano. He sought
Emily with a look of impatient delight,
who, remembering all the attention he had
shewn her on the preceding evening, was
compelled, as before, to shrink from his
assiduities into a timid reserve, except when
she conversved with Signora Herminia and
the other ladies of her party.</P>
<P>It was near midnight before they with‚à£drew
to the opera, where Emily was not so
charmed but that, when she remembered
the scene she had just quitted, she felt how
infinitely inferior all the splendour of art is
to the sublimity of nature. Her heart was
not now affected, tears of admiration did
not start to her eyes, as when she viewed
the vast expanse of ocean, the grandeur
of the heavens, and listened to the rolling.
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
waters, and to the faint music that, at in‚à£tervals,
mingled with their roar. Remem‚à£bering
these, the scene before her faded
into insignificance.</P>
<P>Of the evening, which passon without
any particular incident, she wished the conclusion,
that she might escape from the at‚à£tentions
of the Count; and, as opposite
qualities frequently attract each other in our
thoughts, thus Emily, when she looked on
Count Morano, remembered Valancourt,
and a sigh sometime followed the recol‚à£lection.</P>
<P>Several weeks passed in the course of
customary visits, during which nothing re‚à£markable
occurred. Emily was amused
by the manners and scenes that surrounded
her, so different from those of France, but
where Count Morano, too frequently for
her comfort, contrived to introduce him‚à£self.
His manner, figure and accomplish‚à£ment,
which were generally admired,
Emily would, perhaps, have admired also,
had her heart been disengaged from Va‚à£lancourt,
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
and had the Count forborne to
persecute her with officious attentions, dur‚à£ing
which she observed some traits in his
character, that prejudiced her against what‚à£ever
might otherwise be good in it.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival at Venice, Mon‚à£toni
received a packet from M. Quesnel,
in which the latter mentioned the death of
his wife's uncle, at his villa on the Brenta;
and that, in consequence of this event, he
should hasten to take possession of that
estate and of other effects bequeathed to
him. This uncle was the brother of
Madame Quesnel's late mother; Montoni
was related to her by the father's side, and
though he could have had neither claim
nor expectation concerning these possessions,
he could scarcely conceal the envy which
M. Quesnel's letter excited.</P>
<P>Emily had observed with concern, that,
since they left France, Montoni had not
even affected kindness towards her aunt,
and that, after treating her, at first, with
neglect, he now met her with uniform ill‚à£humour
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
and reserve. She had never sup‚à£posed,
that her aunt's foibles could have
escaped the discernment of Montoni, or
that her mind or figure were of a kind to
deserve his attention. Her surprise, there‚à£fore,
at this match, had been extreme; but
since he had made the choice, she did not
suspect that he would so openly have disco‚à£vered
his contempt of it. But Montoni,
who had been allured by the seeming wealth
of Madame Cheron, was now severely dis‚à£appointed
by her comparative poverty, and
highly exasperated by the deceit she had
employed to conceal it, till concealment
was no longer necessary. He had been
deceived in an affair, wherein he meant to
be the deceiver; out-witted by the superior
cunning of a woman, whose understanding
he despised, and to whom he had sacrificed
his pride and his liberty, without saviang
himself from the ruin, which had impended
over his head. Madame Montoni had
contrived to have the greatest part of what
she really did possess, settled upon herself:
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
what remained, though it was totally inade‚à£quate
both to her husband's expectation,
and to his necessities, he had converted into
money, and brought with him to Venice,
that he might a little longer delude society,
and make a last effort to regain the fortunes
he had lost</P>
<P>The hints which had been thrown out to
Valancourt, concerning Montoni's charac‚à£ter
and condition, were too true; but it
was now left to time and occasion, to un‚à£fold
the circumstances, both of what had,
and of what had not been hinted, and to
time and occasion we commit them.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni was not of a nature to
bear injuries with meekness, or to resent
them with dignity: her exasperated pride
displayed itself in all the violence and
acrimony of a little, or at least of an ill‚à£regulated
mind. She would not acknow‚à£ledge,
even to herself, that she had in any
degree provoked contempt by her dupli‚à£city,
but weakly persisted in believing, that
she alone was to be pitied, and Montoni
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
alone to be censure; for, as her mind had
naturally little perception of moral obliga‚à£tion,
she seldom understood its force but
when it happened to be violated towards
herself: her vanity had already been severe‚à£ly
shocked by a discovery of Montoni's
contempt; it remained to be farther re‚à£proved
by a discovery of his circumstances.
His mansion at Venice, though its furniture
discovered a part of the truth to unprejudiced
persons, told nothing to those who were
blinded by a resolution to believe whatever
they wished. Madame Montoni still thought
herself little less than a princess, possessing
a palace at Venice, and a castle among the
Apennines. To the castle di Udolpho,
indeed, Montoni sometimes talked of going
for a few weeks to examine into its condi‚à£tion,
and to receive some rents; for it appeared
that he had not been there for two
years, and that, during this period, it had
been inhabited only by an old servant,
whom he called his steward.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78"/>
Emily listened to the mention of this
journey with pleasure, for she not only
expected from it new ideas, but a release
from the persevering assiduities of Count
Morano. In the country, too, she would
have leisure to think of Valancourt, and to
indulge the melancholy, which his image,
and a recollection of the scenes of La Val‚à£lee,
always blessed with the memory of her
parent, awakened. The ideal scenes were
dearer, and more soothing to her heart,
than all the splendour of gay assemblies;
they were a kind of talisman that expelled
the poison of temporary evils, and supported
her hopes of happy days: they appeared
like a beautiful landscape, lighted up by a
gleam of sun-shine, and seen through a per
spective of dark and rugged rocks.</P>
<P>But count Morano did not long confine
himself to silent assiduities; he declared
his passion to Emily, and made proposals
to Montoni, who encouraged, though
Emily rejected him: with Montoni for his
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
friend, and an abundance of vanity to de‚à£lude
him, he did not despair of success
Emily was astonished and highly disgusted
at his perseverance, after she had explained
her sentiments with a frankness that would
not allow him to misunderstand them.</P>
<P>He now passed the greater part of his
time at Montoni's, dining there almost
daily, and attending Madame and Emily
wherever they went; and all this, notwith‚à£standing
the uniform reserve of Emily,
whose aunt seemed as anxious as Montoni
to promote this marriage; and would never
dispense with her attendance at any assembly
where the Count proposed to be present.</P>
<P>Montoni now said nothing of his intended
journey, of which Emily waited impatiently
to hear; and he was seldom at home but
when the Count, or Signor Orsino, was there,
fro between himself and Cavigni a coolness
seemed to subsist, though the latter re‚à£mained
in his house. With Orsino, Mon‚à£toni
was frequently closeted for hours to‚à£gether,
and, whatever might be the busi‚à£ness,
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
upon which they consulted, it ap‚à£peared
to be of consequence, since Mon‚à£toni
often sacrifice to it his favourite
passion for play, and remained at home the
whole night. There was somewhat of
privacy, too, in the manner of Orsino's
visits, which had never before occurred,
and which excited not only surprise, but
some degree of alarm in Emily's mind,
who had unwillingly discovered much of
his character when he had most endea‚à£voured
to disguise it. After these visits,
Montoni was often more thoughtful than
usual; sometimes the deep workings of
his mind entirely abstracted him from sur‚à£rounding
objects, and threw a gloom over
his visage that rendered it terrible; at
others, his eyes seemed almost to flash
fire, and all the energies of his soul appear‚à£ed
to be roused for some great enterprise.
Emily observed these written characters of
his thoughts with deep interest, and not
without some degree of awe, when she con‚à£sidered
that she was entirely in his power; but
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
forbore even to hint her fears, or her obser‚à£vations,
to Madame Montoni, who dis‚à£cerned
nothing in her husband, at these
times, but his usual sternness.</P>
<P>A second letter from M. Quesnel annou‚à£ced
the arrival of himself and his lady
at the villa Miarenti; stated several cir‚à£cumstances
of his good fortune, respecting
the affair that had brought him into Italy;
and concluded with an earnest request to
see Montoni, his wife and niece, at his new
estate.</P>
<P>Emily received, about the same period,
a much more interesting letter, and which
foothed for a while every anxiety of her
heart. Valancourt, hoping she might be
still at Venice, had trusted a letter to the
ordinary post, that told her of his health,
and of his unceasing and anxious affection.
He had lingered at Tholouse for some time
after her departure, that he might indulge
the melancholy pleasure of wandering
through the scenes where he had been ac‚à£customed
to behold her, and had thence
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
gone to his brother's chateau, which was in
the neighbourhood of La VallÈe. Having
mentioned this, he added, ‚ÄúIf the duty
of attending may regiment did not require
my departure, I know not when I should
have resolution enough to quit the neigh‚à£bourhood
of a place which is endeared by
the remembrance of you. The vicinity to
La VallÈe has alone detained me thus long
at Estuviere: I frequently ride thither early
in the morning, that I may wander, at
leisure, through the day, among scenes,
which were once your home, where I have
been accustomed to see you, and to hear
you converse. I have renewed my ac‚à£quintance
with the good old Theresa,
who rejoiced to see me, that she might talk
of you: I need not say how much this
circumstance attached me to her, or how
eagerly I listened to her upon her favourite
subject. You will guess the motive that
first induced me to make myself known to
Theresa: it was, indeed, no other than
that of gaining admittance into the chateau
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
and gardens, which my Emily had so late‚à£ly
inhabited: here, then, I wander, and
meet your image under every shade: but
chiefly I love to fit beneath the spreading
branches of your favourite plane, where
once, Emily, we sat together; where I first
ventured to tell you, that I loved. O
Emily! the remembrance of those moments
overcomes me‚ÄîI sit lost in reverie‚ÄîI
endeavour to see you dimly through my tears,
in all the heaven of peace and innocence,
such as you then appeared to me; to hear
again the accents of that voice, which then
thrilled my heart with tenderness and hope.
I lean on the wall of the terrace, where we
together watched the rapid current of the
Garonne below, while I described the wild
scenery about its source, but thought only of
you. O Emily! are these moments passed
for ever‚Äîwill they never more return?‚Äù</P>
<P>In another part of his letter he wrote
thus. ‚ÄúYou see my letter in dated on many
different days, and, if you look back to
the first, you will perceive, that I began to
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
write soon after your departure from France.
To write was, indeed, the only employment
that withdrew me from my own melancholy
and rendered your absence supportable, or
rather, it seemed to destroy absence; for,
when I was conversing with you on paper,
and telling you every sentiment and affection
of my heart, you almost appeared to
be present. This employment has been
from time to time my chief consolation,
and I have deferred sending off my packet,
merely for the comfort of prolonging it,
though it was certain, that what I had
written, was written to no purpose till you
received it. Whenever my mind has been
more than usually depressed I have come
to pour forth its sorrows to you, and have
always sound consolation; and, when any
little occurrence has interested my heart,
and given a gleam of joy to may spirits, I
have hastened to communicate it to you,
and have received reflected satisfaction.
Thus, my letter is a kind of picture of my
life and of my thoughts for the last month,
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
and thus, though it had been deeply interest‚à£ing
to me, while I wrote it, and I dare hope
will, for the same reason, be not indifferent
to you, yet to other readers it would seem
to abound only in Frivolities Thus it is
always, when we attempt to describe the finer
movements of the heart, for they are too fine
to be discerned, they can only be experi
enced, and are therefore passed over by the
indifferent observer, while the interested one
feels, that all description is imperfect and
unnecessary, except as it may prove the
sincerity of the writer, and soothe his own
sufferings. You will pardon all this
egotism‚Äîfor I am a lover.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI have just heard of a circumstance,
which entirely destroys all my fairy para
dise of ideal delight, and which will recon
cile me to the necessity of returning to my
regiment, for I must no longer wander be‚à£neath
the beloved shades, where I have been
accustomed to meet you in thought‚ÄîLa
VallÈe is let! I have reason to believe this
is without your knowledge, from what
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
Theresa told me this morning, and, there
fore, I mention the circumstance. She shed
tears, while she related, that she was going
to leave the service of her dear mistress, and
the chateau where she had lived so many
happy years; and all this, added she, with
out even a letter from Mademoiselle to soften
the news; but it is all Mons. Quesnel's do‚à£ings,
and I dare say she does not even know
what is going forward.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúTheresa added, That she had received a letter from him, informing her the chateau
was let, and that, as her services would no
longer be required, she must quit the place,
on that day week, when the new tenant
would arrive.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúTheresa had been surprised by a &amp; visit
from M. Quesnel, some time before the receipt
of this letter, who was accompanied
by a stranger that viewed the premises with
much curiosity.‚Äù</P>
<P>Towards the conclusion of his letter,
which is dated a week after this sentence,
Valancourt adds, ‚ÄúI have received a fum‚à£mons
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
from my regiment, and I join it
without regret, since I am shut out from
the scenes that are so interesting to my heart.
I rode to La VallÈe this morning, and heard
that the new tenant was arrived, and that
Theresa was gone. I should not treat the
subject thus familiarly if I did not believe
you to be uninformed of this disposal of
your house; for your satisfaction I have
endeavoured to learn something of the cha‚à£racter
and fortune of your tenant, but with‚à£out
success. He is a gentleman, they say,
and this is all I can hear. The place, as I
wandered round the boundaries, appeared
more melancholy to my imagination, than
I had ever seen it. I whished earnestly to
have got admittance, that I might have
taken another leave of your favourite plane‚à£tree,
and thougth of you once more beneath
its shade: but I forbore to tempt the cu‚à£riosity
of strangers: the fishing-house in the
woods, however, was still open to me; thither
I went, and passed an hour, which I
cannot even look back upon without emo‚à£tion.
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
O Emily! surely we are not sepa‚à£rated-for
ever‚Äîsurely we shall live for each
other!"</P>
<P>This letter brought many tears to Emily's
eyes; tears of tenderness and satisfaction
on learning that Valancourt was well, and
that time and absence had in no degree
effaced her image from his heart. There
were passages in this letter which particu‚à£larly
affected her, such as those describing
his visits to La VallÈe, and the sen‚à£timents
of delicate affection that its scenes had
awakened. It was a considerable time before
her mind was sufficiently abstracted from
Valancourt to feel the force of his intelligence
concerning La VallÈe. That Mons. Quesnel
should let it, without even consulting her
on the measure, both surpirsed and shocked
her, particularly as it proved the absolute
authority he thought himself entitled to
exercise in her affairrs. It is true, he had
proposed, before she left France, that the
chateau should be let, during her absence,
and to the oeonomical prudence of this
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
she had nothing to object; but the com‚à£mitting
what had been her father's villa to
the power and caprice of strangers, and the
depriving herself of a sure home, should
any unhappy circumstances make her look
back to her home as an asylum, were con‚à£siderations
that made her, even then,
strongly oppose the measure. Her father,
too, in his last hour, had received from her
a solemn promise never to dispose of La
VallÈe; and this she considered as in
some degree violated if she suffered the
place to be let. But it was now evident
with how little respect M. Quesnel had
regarded these objections, and how insig‚à£nificant
he considered every obstacle to pe‚à£cuniary
advantage. It appeared, also, that
he had not even condescended to in‚à£form
Montoni of the step he had taken,.
since no motive was evident for Montoni's
concealing the circumstance from her, if it
had been made known to him: this both dis‚à£pleased
and surprised her; but the chief subjects
of her uneasiness were‚Äîthe temporary
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
disposal of La VallÈe, and the dismission
of her father's old and faithful servant.
‚ÄúPoor Theresa,‚Äù said Emily, ‚Äúthou hadst
not saved much in thy servitude, for thou
wast always tender towards the poor, and
believed'st thou shouldst die in the family,
where thy best years had been spent.
Poor Theresa!‚Äînow thou art turned out
in thy old age to seek thy bread!‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily wept bitterly as these thoughts
passed over her mind, and she determined
to consider what could be done for Theresa,
and to talk very explicitly to M. Quesnel
on the subject; but she much feared that
his cold heart could feel only for itself. she
determined also to enquire whether he had
made any mention of her affairs, in his let‚à£ters
to Montoni, who soon gave her the
opportunity she sought, by desiring that she
would attend him in his study. She had
little doubt, that the interview was intended
for the purpose of communicating to her a
part of M. Quesnel's letter concerning the
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
transactions at La VallÈe, and she obeyed
him immediately. Montoni was alone.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI have just been writing to Mons.
Quesnel,‚Äù said he when Emily appeared,
‚Äúin reply to the letter I received from
him a few days ago, and I wished to talk
to you upon a subject that occupied part
of it.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI also wished to speak with you on
this topic, sir,‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is a subject of some interest to you,
undoubtedly,‚Äù rejoined Montoni, ‚Äúand I
think you must see it in the light that I
do; indeed it will not bear any other. I
trust you will agree with me, that any ob‚à£jection
founded on sentiment, as they call
it, ought to yield to circumstances of solid
advantage.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúGranting this, sir.‚Äù replied Emily,
modestly, ‚Äúthose of humanity ought surely
to be attended to. But I fear it is now too
late to deliberate upon this plan, and I Must
regret, that it is no longer in my power to
reject it.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92"/>
‚ÄúIt is too late,‚Äù said Montoni, ‚Äúbut
since it is so, I am pleased to observe, that
you submit to reason and necessity with‚à£out
indulging useless complaint. I applaud
this conduct exceedingly, the more, per‚à£haps,
since it discovers a strength of mind
seldom observable in your sex. When
you are older you will look back with gra‚à£titude
to the friends who assisted in rescuing
you from the romantic illusions of sentiment,
and will perceive, that they are only
the snares of childhood, and should be
vanquished the moment you escape from
the nursery. I have not closed my letter,
and you may add a few lines to inform your
uncle of your acquiescence. You will
soon see him, for it is my intention to take
you, with Madame Montoni, in a few days
to Miarenti, and you can then talk over
the affair.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily wrote on the opposite page of the
paper as follows:</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is now useless, sir, for me to remon‚à£strate
upon the circumstances of which
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
Signor Montoni informs me that he has
written. I could have wished, at least, that
the affair had been concluded with less pr‚à£cipitation,
that I might have taught myself
to subdue some prejudices, as the Signor
calls them, which still linger in my heart.
As it is, I submit. In point of prudence
nothing certainly can be objected; but,
though I submit, I have yet much to say
on some other points of the subject, when
I shall have the honour of seeing you. In
the meantime I entreat you will take care
of Theresa, for the sake of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
Your affectionate niece,
<SIGNED>EMILY ST. AUBERT.‚Äù</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<P>Montoni smiled satirically at what Emily
had written, but did not object to it, and
she withdrew to her own apartment, where
she sat down to begin a letter to Valancourt,
in which she related the particulars of her
journey, and her arrival at Venice, described
some of the most striking scenes in the pas‚à£sage
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
over the Alps; her emotions on her
first view of Italy; the manners and cha‚à£racters
of the people around her, and some
few circumstances of Montoni's conduct.
But she avoided even naming Count Mo‚à£rano,
much more the declaration he had
made, since she well knew how tremblingly
alive to fear is real love, how jealously
watchful of every circumstance that may
affect its interest; and she scrupulously
avoided to give Valancourt even the slightest
reason for believing he had a rival.</P>
<P>On the following day Count Morano
dined again at Montoni's. He was in an
uncommon flow of spirits, and Emily
thought there was somewhat of exultation
in his manner of addressing her, which she
had never observed before. She endeavour‚à£ed
to repress this by more than her usual re‚à£serve,
but the cold civility of her air now
seemed rather to encourage than to deprss
him. He appeared watchful of an oppor‚à£tunity
of speaking with her alone, and more
than once solicited this; but Emily always
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
replied, that she could hear nothing from
him which he would be unwilling to repeat
before the whole company.</P>
<P>In the evening, Madame Montoni and
her party went out upon the sea, and as
the Count led Emily to his <HI>zendaletto,</HI> he
carried her hand to his lips, and thanked
her for the condescension she had shewn
him,. Emily, in extreme surprise and dis‚à£pleassure,
hastily withdrew her hand, and
concluded that he had spoken ironically;
but, on reaching the steps of the terrace,
and observing by the livery, that it was
the Count's <HI>zendaletto,</HI> which waited below,
while the rest of the party, having arranged
themselves in the gondolas, were moving
on, she determined not to permit a separate
conversation, and, wishing him a good
evening, returned to the portico, The
Count followed to expostulate and entreat,
and Montoni, who then came out, re
dered solicitation unnecessary, for, without
condescending to speak, he took her hand,
and led her to the <HI>zendaletto.</HI> Emily was
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
not silent; she entreated Montoni, in a low
voice, to consider the impropriety of these
circumstances, and that he would spare her
the mortification of submitting to them;
he, however, was inflexible.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThis caprice is intolerable,‚Äù said he,
‚Äúand shall not be indulged: here is no
impropriety in the case.‚Äù</P>
<P>At this moment, Emily's dislike of Count
Morano arose to abhorrence. That he
should, with undaunted assurance, thus
pursue her, notwithstanding all she had
expressed on the subject of his addresses,
and think, as it was evident he did, that
her opinion of him was of no consequence,
so long as his pretensions were sanctioned by
Montoni, added indignation to the disgust
which she had felt towards his. She was
somewhat relieved by observing that Mon‚à£toni
was to be of the party, who seated him‚à£self
on one side of her, while Morano placed
himself on the other. There was a pause
of some moments as the gondolieri prepared
their oars, and Emily trembled from appre‚à£hension
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
of the discourse that might follow
this silence. At length she collected cou‚à£rage
to break it herself, in the hope of pre‚à£venting
fine speeches from Morano, and
reproof from Montoni. To some trivial
remark which she made, the letter returned
a short and disobliging reply; but Morano
immediately followed with a general ob‚à£servation,
which he contrived to end with a
particular compliment, and, though Emily
passed it without even the notice of a smile,
he was not discouraged.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI have been impatient,‚Äù said he, ad‚à£dressing
Emily, ‚Äúto express my gratitude;
to thank you for your goodness; but I must
also thank Signor Montoni, who has allow‚à£ed
me this opportunity of doing so.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily regarded the Count with a look
of mingled astonishment and displeasure.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy.‚Äù continued he, ‚Äúshould you
wish to diminish the delight of this mo‚à£ment
by that air of cruel reserve?‚ÄîWhy
seek to throw me again into the perplexities
of doubt, by teaching your eyes to contra‚à£dict
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
the kindness of your late declaration?
You cannot doubt the sincerity, the ardour
of my passion; it is therefore unnecessary,
charming Emily! surely unnecessary, any
longer to attempt a disguise of your senti‚à£ments.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIf ever had disguised them, sir,‚Äù said
Emily, with recollected spirit, ‚Äúit would
certainly be unnecessary any longer to do
so. I had hoped, sir, that you would
have spared me any farther necessity of al‚à£luding
to them; but, since you do not
grant this, hear me declare, and for the last
time, that your perseverance had deprived
you even of the esteem, which I was in‚à£clined
to believe you merited.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAstonishing!‚Äù exclaimed Montoni
‚Äúthis is beyond even my expectation, though
I have hitherto done justice to the caprice
of the sex! But you will observe, Made‚à£moiselle
Emily, that I am no lover, though
Count Morano is, and that I will not be
made the amusement of your capricious
moments. Here is the offer of an alliance,
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
which would do honour to any family;
yours, you will recollect, is not noble; you
long resisted my remonstrances, but my
honour is now engaged, and it shall not
be trifled with.‚ÄîYou shall adhere to the
declaration, which you have made me an
agent to convey to the Count.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI must certainly mistake you, sir,‚Äù said
Emily; ‚Äúmy answers on the subject have
been uniform; it is unworthy of you to
accuse me of caprice. If you have con‚à£descended
to be my agent, it is an honour
I did not folicit. I myself have constantly
assured Count Morano, and you also, sir,
that I never can accept the honour he offers
me, and I now repeat the declaration.‚Äù</P>
<P>The Count looked with an air of surpirse
and enquiry at Montoni, whose countenance
also was marked with surpise, but it was
surpise mingled with indignation.</P>
<P>‚ÄúHere is confidence, as well as caprice!‚Äù
said the latter, ‚ÄúWill you deny your own
words, Madam?</P>
<P>‚ÄúSuch a question is unworthy of an an‚à£swer,
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
sir;said Emily blushing; you wil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>
recollect yourself, and be sorry that you
have asked it.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúSpeak to the point,‚Äù rejoined Mon‚à£toni,
in a voice of increasing vehemence.
‚ÄúWill you deny your own words; will
you deny, that you acknowledged, only
a few hours ago, that it was too late to
recede from your engagements, and that
you accepted the Count's hand?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI will deny all this, for no words of
mine ever imported it.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAstonishing! Will you deny what you
wrote to Mons. Quesnel, your uncle? If
you do, you own hand will bear testimony
against you. What have you now to say?‚Äù
continued Montoni, observing the silence
and confusion of Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI now perceive, sir, that you are under
a very great error, and that I have been
equally mistaken.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo more duplicity, I entreat; be
open and candid, if it be possible.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI have always been so, sir; and can
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
claim no merit in such conduct, for I have
had nothing to conceal.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow is this, Signor?‚Äù cried Morano,
with trembliing emotion.</P>
<P>‚ÄúSuspend your judgment, Count,‚Äù re‚à£plied
Montoni, ‚Äúthe wiles of a female
heart are unsearchable. Now, Madam,
your <HI>explanation.</HI>‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúExcuse me, sir, if I withhold my ex‚à£planation
till you appear willing to give me
your confidence; assertion at present can
only subject me to insult.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYour explanation, I entreat you!‚Äù
said Morano.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù rejoined Montoni, ‚ÄúI
give you my condidence; let us hear this
explanation.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúLet me lead to it then, by asking a
question.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAs many as you please,‚Äù said Mon‚à£toni,
contemptuously.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat, then, was the subject of your
letter to Mons. Quesnell?‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="102"/>
‚ÄúThe same that was the subject of your
note to him, certainly. You did well to
stipulate for my confidence before you de‚à£manded
that question.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI must beg you will be more explicit,
sir; what was that subject?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat could it be, but the noble offer
of Count Morano,‚Äù said Montoni</P>
<P>‚ÄúThen sir we entirely misunderstood
each other,‚Äù replied Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWe entirely misunderstood each other
too, I suppose,‚Äù rejoined Montoni, ‚Äúin
the conversation which preceded the writ‚à£ing
of that note? I must do you the justice
to own, that you are very ingenious at this
same art of misunderstanding.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily tried to restrain the tears that
came to her eyes, and to answer with be‚à£coming
firmness. ‚ÄúAllow me, sir, to ex‚à£plain
myself fully or to be wholly silent.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThe explanation may now be dis‚à£pensed
with; it is anticipated. If Count
Morano still thinks one necessary, I will
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
give him an honest one.‚ÄîYou have changed
your intention since our last conversation;
and, if he can have patience and humility
enough to wait till to-morrow, he will pro‚à£bably
find it changed again: but as I have
neither the patience or the humility, which
you expect from a lover, I warn you of the
effect of my displeasure!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúMontoni, you are too precipitate,‚Äù said
the Count, who had listened to this con‚à£versation
in extreme anxiety and impa‚à£tience;
- Signora, I entreat you own ex‚à£planation
of this affair!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúSignor Montoni has said justly,‚Äù re‚à£plied
Emily, ‚Äúthat explanation may
now be dispensed with; after what has
passed I cannot suffer myself to give one.
It is sufficient for me, and for you, sir, that
I repeat my late declaration; let me hope
this is the last time it will be necessary for
me to repeat it - I never can accept the ho‚à£nour
of you alliance.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúCharming Emily!‚Äù exclaimed the
count in an impassioned tone, ‚Äúlet not
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
resentment make you unjust; let me not
suffer for the offence of Montoni!- Re‚à£voke‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúOffence!‚Äù interrupted Montoni‚Äî
‚ÄúCount, this language is ridiculous, this
submission is childish!- speak as becomes
a man, not as the slave of a pretty tyrant.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou distract me, Signor; suffer me to
plead my own cause; you have already
proved insufficient to it.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAll conversation on this subject, sir,‚Äù
said Emily, ‚Äúis worse than useless, since
it can bring only pain to each of us: if you
would oblige me, pursue it no farther.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is impossible, Madam, that I can
thus easily resign the object of my life.
Which the delight and torment of my life.
-I must still love- still pursue you with
unremitting ardour;- when you shall be
convinced of the strength and constancy of
my passion, your heart must soften into pity
and repentance.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIs this generous, sir? is this manly?
Can it it either deserve or obtain the esteem
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
you folicit, thus to continue a persecution
from which I have no present means of
escaping?‚Äù</P>
<P>A gleam of moonlight that fell upon
Morano's countenance, revealed the strong
emotions of his soul; and, glancing on
Montoni discovered the dark resentment,
which contrasted his features.</P>
<P>‚ÄúBy heaven this is too much!‚Äù sud‚à£denly
exclaimed the Count; ‚ÄúSugnor
Montoni, you treat me ill; it is from you
that I shall look for explanation.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúFrom me, sir! you shall have it;‚Äù
muttered Montoni, ‚Äúif your discernment
is indeed so far obscured by passion, as to
make explanation necessary. And for you,
Madam, you should learn, that a man of
honour is not to be trifled with, though you
may perhaps, with impunity, treat a boy
like a puppet.</P>
<P>This sarcasm roused the pride of Mo‚à£rano,
and the resentment which he had felt
at the indifference of Emily, being lost in
indignation of the unsolence of Montoni;
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
he determined to mortify him, by defend‚à£ing
her.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThis also he, replying to Mon‚à£toni's
last words,‚Äù this also, shall not pass
unnoticed. I bid you learn, sir, that you
have a stronger enemy than a woman to
contend with: I will protect Signora St.
Aubert from your threatened resentment.
You have misled me, and would revenge
your disappointed views upon the inno‚à£cent.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúMisled you!‚Äù retorted Montoni with
quickness, ‚Äúis my conduct-my word‚Äù‚à£then
pausing, while he seemed endeavouring
to restrain the resignment, that flashed in his eyes, in
next moment, he added, in a
subdued voice, ‚ÄúCount Morano, this is a
a language, a sort of conduct to which I
am not accustomed: it is the conduct of a
passionate boy-as such, I pass it over in
contempt.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIn contempt, Signor?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThe respect I owe myself,‚Äù rejoined
Montoni, requires, that I should converse
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
more largely with you upon some points of
the subject in dispute. Return with me to
Venice, and I will condescend to convince
you of your error,‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúCondescend, sir but I will not con‚à£descend
to be so conversed with.‚Äù</P>
<P>Montoni smiled contemptuously; and
Emily, now terrified for the consequences
of what she saw and heard, could no longer
be silent. She explained the whole subject
upon which she had mistaken Montoni in
the morning, declaring, that she under‚à£stood
to have consulted her solely con‚à£erning
the disposal of La VallÈe, and
concluding with entreating, that he would
write immediately to M. Quesnel, and rec‚à£tify
the mistake.</P>
<P>But Montoni either was, or affected to
be, still incredulous; and Count Morano
was still entangled in perplexity. While
she was speaking, however, the attention of
her auditors had been diverted from the
immediate occasion of their resentment,
and their passion consequently became less.
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
Montoni desired the Count would order
his servants to row back to Venice, that he
might have some private convesation with
him; and Morano, somewhat soothed by
his softened voice and manner, and eager
to examine into the full extent of his diffi‚à£culties,
complied.</P>
<P>Emily, comforted by this prospect of re‚à£lease,
employed the present moment in
endeavouring, with conciliating care, to
prevent any fatal mischief between the per‚à£sons
who so lately had persecuted and in‚à£sulted
her.</P>
<P>Her spirits revived, when she heard once
more the voice of song and laughter, re‚à£sounding
from the grand canal, and at
length entered again between its stately
piazzas. The <HI>zendaletto</HI> stopped at Mon‚à£toni's
mansion and the Count hastily led
her into the hall, where Montoni took his
arm, and said something in a low voice, on
which Morano kissed the hand he held,
not with standing Emily's effort to disen‚à£gage
it, and, wishing her a good evening,
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
with an accent look she could not mis‚à£understand,
returned to his <HI>zendaletto</HI> with
Montoni.</P>
<P>Emily, in her own apartmient, considered
with intense anxiety all the unjust and ty‚à£rannical
conduct of Montoni, the dauntless
perseverance of Morano, and her own de‚à£desolate
situation, removed in vain to Va‚à£lancourt,
confined by his profession to a
distant kingdom, as her protector; but it
gave her comfort to know, that there was,
at least, one person in the world, who would symphathize in her
afflictions, and
whose wishes would fly eagerly to release
her. Yet she determined not to give him
unavailing pain by relating the reasons she
had to regret the having rejected his better
judgment concerning Montoni; reasons,
however, which could not induce her to
lament the delicacy and disinterested affec‚à£tion
that had made her reject his proposal
for a clandestine marriage. The approach‚à£ing
interview with her uncle she regarded
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
with some degree of hope, for she deter‚à£mined
to represent to him the distresses of
her situation, and to entreat that he would
allow her to return to France with him and
Madame Quesnel. Then, suddenly re‚à£membering
that her beloved La VallÈe,
her only home, was no longer at her com‚à£mand,
her tears flowed anew, and she feared
that she had little pity to expect from a man
who, like M. Quelsnel, could dispose of it
without deigning to consult with her, and
could dismiss an aged and faithful servant,
destitute of either support or asylum. But,
though it was certain, that she had herself
no longer a home in France and few, very few
friends there, she determined to return,
if possible, that she might be released from
the power of Montoni, whose particularly
oppressive conduct towards herself, and ge‚à£neral
character as to others, were justly ter‚à£ribleto
her imagination. She had no wish
to reside with her uncle, M, Quesnel, since
his behaviour to her late father and to her‚à£self,
had been uniformly such as to con‚à£vince
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
her, that in flying to him she could only
obtain an exchange of oppressors; neither
had she the slightest intention of consenting
to the proposal of Valancourt for an imme‚à£diate
marriage, though this would give her
a lawful and a generous prospector, for the chief
reasons, which had formerly influ‚à£enced
her conduct, still existed against it while other,
which seemed to justify the
step, would now be done away; and his
interest his fame were at all times too dear
to her, to suffer her to cosent to a union,
which, at this early period of their lives,
would probably defeat both. One sure,
and proper asylum, however, would still
be open to her in France. She knew that
she could board in the convent, where she
had formerly experienced so much kindness,
and which had an affecting and solemn
claim upon her heart, since it contained the
remains of ther late father. Here she could
remain in safety and tranquillilty, till the
term, for which La VallÈe might be let,
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
should expire; or, till the arrangement of
M. Motteville's affairs enabled her so far to
judge whether it would be prudent for her
to reside there.</P>
<P>Concerning Montoni's conduct with re‚à£spect
to his letters to M. Quesnel, she had
many doubts; however he might be at first
mistaken on the subjuct, she much suspected
that he wilfully persevered in his error, as
a means of intimidating her into a com‚à£pliance
with his wishes of uniting her to
Count Morano. Whether this was or was
not the fact, she was extremely anxious
to explain the affair to M. Quesnel, and
looked forward with a mixture of impa‚à£tience,
hope and fear, to her approaching
visit.</P>
<P>On the following day, Madame Mon‚à£toni,
being alone with Emily, introduced
the mention of Count Morano, by ex‚à£pressing
her surprise, that she had not
joined the party on the water the preceding
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
evening, and at her abrupt departure to
Venice. Emily then related what had
passed, expressed her concern for the mu‚à£tual
mistake that had occurred between
Montoni and herself, and solicited her aunt's
kind offices in urging him to give a decisive
denial to the Count's further addresses; but
she soon perceived, that Madame Montoni
had not been ignorant of the late conversa‚à£tion,
when she introduced the present.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou have no encouragement to expect
from me,‚Äù said her aunt, ‚Äúin these no‚à£tions.
I have already given my opinion on
the subject, and think Signor Montoni right
in enforcing, by any means, your consent.
If young persons will be blind to their in‚à£terest,
and obstinately oppose it, why, the
greatest blessings they can have are friends,
who will oppose their folly. Pray what
pretensions of any kind do you think you
have to such a match as is now offered
you?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNot any whatever, Madam,‚Äù replied
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
Emily, ‚Äúand, therefore, at least, suffer
me to be happy in my humility.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNay, niece, it cannot be denied, that
you have pride enough; my poor brother,
your father, had his share of pride too;
tough, let me add, his fortune did not
justify it.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, somewhat embarrassed by the in‚à£dignation,
which this malevolent allusion to
her father excited, and by the difficulty of
rendering her answer as temperate as it
should be reprehensive, hesitated for some
moments, in a confusion, which highly gra‚à£tified
her aunt. At length she said, ‚ÄúMy
father's pride, Madam, had a noble ob‚à£ject
-the happiness which he knew could
be derived only from goodness, knowledge
and charity. As it never consisted in his
superiority, in point of fortune, to some
persons, it was not humbled by his inferi‚à£ority,
in that respect, to others. He never
disdained those, who were wretched by po‚à£verty
and misfortune; he did sometimes
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
despise persons, who with many opportu‚à£nities
of happiness, rendered themselves
miserable by vanity, ignorance and cruelty.
I shall think it my highest glory to emu‚à£late
such pride.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI do not pretend to understand any
thing of these high flown sentiments, niece;
you have all that glory to yourself: I would
teach you a little plain sense, and not have
you so wise as to despise happiness.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThat would indeed not be wisdom,
but folly,‚Äù said Emily, ‚Äúfor wisdom can
boast no higher attainment than happiness;
but you will allow, Madam, that our ideas
of happiness may differ. I cannot doubt,
that you wish me to be happy, but I must
fear you are mistaken in the means of mak‚à£ing
me so.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI cannot boast of a learned education,
niece, such as your father thought proper
to give you, and, therefore, do not pre‚à£tend
to understand all these fine speeches
about happiness. I must be contented to
understand only common sense, and happy
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
would it have been for you and your father,
if that had been included in his education.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily was too much shocked by these
reflections on her father's memory, to de‚à£spise
this speech as it deserved.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni was about to speak,
but Emily quitted the room, and retired to
her own, where the little spirit she had
lately exerted yielded to grief and vex‚à£ation,
and left her only to her tears. From
every review of her situation she could de‚à£rive,
indeed, only new sorrow. To the
discovery, which had just been forced upon
her, of Montoni's unworthiness she had
now to add, that of the cruel vanity, for
the gratification of which her aunt was
about to sacrifice her; of the effrontery
and cunning, with which, at the time that
she meditated the sacrifice, she boasted of
her tenderness, or insulted her victim: and
of the venomous envy, which, as it did not
scruple to attack her father's character,
could scarcely be expected to withhold
form her own.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117"/>
During the few days, that intervened be‚à£tween
this conversation and the departure
for Miarenti, Montoni did not once address
himself to Emily. His looks sufficiently
declared his resentment; but that he should
forbear to renew a mention of the subject
of it, exceedingly surprised her, who was
no less astonished, that, during three days,
Count Morano neither visited Montoni, or
was named by him. Several conjectures
arose in her mind. Sometimes she feared
that the dispute between them had been
revived, and had ended fatally to the Count.
Sometimes she was inclined to hope, that
weariness, or disgust at her firm rejuction of
his suit had induced him to relinquish it;
and, at others, she suspected that he had
now recourse to stratagem, and forbore his
visits, and prevailed with Montoni to for‚à£bear
the repetition of his name, in the expec‚à£tation
that gratitude and generosity would
prevail with her to give him the consent,
which he could not hope from love.</P>
<P>Thus passed the time in vain conjecture
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
and alternate hopes and fears, till the day
arrived when Montoni was to set out for
the villa of Miarenti, which, like the pre‚à£ceding
ones, neither brought the Count, or
the mention of him.</P>
<P>Montoni having determined not to leave
Venice, till towards evening, that he might
avoid the heats, and catch the cool breezes
of night, embarked about an hour before
sun-set, with his family, in a barge, for the
Brenta. Emily sat alone near the stern of
the vessel, and, as it floated slowly on,
watched the hay and lofty city lessening
from her view, till its places seemed to
sink in the distant waves, while its loftier
towers and domes, illumined by the declin‚à£ing
sun, appeared on the horizon, like those
far-seen clouds which, in more northern
climes, often linger on the western verge,
and catch the last light of a summeer's even‚à£ing.
Soon after, even these grew dim, and
faded in distance from her sight; but she
still sat gazing on the vast scene of cloud‚à£less
sky, and mighty waters; and listening
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
in pleasing awe to the deep-sounding waves,
while, as her eyes glanced over the Adriatic,
towards the opposite shores, which were,
however, far beyond the reach of sight, she
thought of Greece, and a thousand classical
remembrances stealing to her mind, she ex‚à£perienced
that pensive luxury which is felt on
viewing the scenes of ancient story, and on
comparing their present state of silence and
solitude with that of their former grandeur
and animation. The scenes of the Illiad
illapsed in glowing colours to her fancy‚à£scenes,
once the haunt of heroes- now
lonely, and in ruins; but which still shone,
in the poet's strain, in all their youthful
splendour.</P>
<P>As her imagination painted with melan‚à£choly
touches, the deserted plains of Troy,
such as they appeared in this after-day, she
reanimated the landscape with the follow‚à£ing
little story.</P>

<P><PB N="121" REF="123"/>
As Emily approached the shores of Italy
she began to discriminate the rich fearures
and varied colouring of the landscape‚à£the
purple hills, groves of orange pine and
cypress, shading magnificent villas, and
towns rising among vineyards and plan‚à£tations.
The noble Brenta, pouring its
broad waves in to the sea, now appeared, and, when
she reached its mouth, the barge
stopped, that the horses might be fastened
which were to tow it up the stream. This
done, Emily gave a last look to the Adriatic,
and to the dim sail,
<Q><L>‚Äî‚ÄúThat from the sky-mix'd wave</L>
<L>Dawns on the sight,‚Äù</L></Q>
and the barge slowly glided between the
green and luxuriant slopes of the river.
The grandeur of the Palladian villas, that
adorn these shores, was considerably height‚à£ened
by the setting rays, which threw
strong contra sits of light shade upon the
porticos and long arcades, and beamed
a mellow lustre upon the orangeries and
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
the tall groves of pine and cypress, that over‚à£hung
the buildings. The scent of oranges,
of flowering myrtles, and other odoriferous
plants was diffused upon the air, and often,
from these embowered retreats, a strain of
music stole on the calm, and ‚Äúsoftened
into silence.‚Äù</P>
<P>The sun now sunk below the horizon,
twilight fell over the landscape, and Emily,
wrapt in musing silence, continued to
watch its features gradually vanishing into
obscurity. She remembered her many
happy evenings, when with St. Aubert she
had observed the shades of twilight steal
over a scene as beautiful as this, from the
gardens of La VallÈe, and a tear fell to the
memory of her father. Her spirits were
softened into melancholy by the influence
of the hour, by the low murmur of the
wave passing under the vessel, and the still‚à£ness
of the air, that trembled only at inter‚à£vals
with distant music:- why else should
she, at these moments, have looked on her
attachment to Valancourt with presages so
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
very afflicting, since she had but lately re‚à£ceived
letters from him, that had foothed
for a while all her anxieties? It now seemed
to her oppressed mind, that she had taken
leave of him for ever, and that the coun‚à£tries,
which separated them, would never
more be re-traced by her. She looked upon
Count Morano with horror, as in some
degree the cause of this; but apart from him,
a conviction, if such that may be
called, which arises from no proof, and
which she knew not how to account for,
seized her mind-that she should never see
Valancourt again. Though she knew, that
neither Morano's solicitations, nor Mon‚à£toni's
commands had lawful power to en‚à£sorce
her obedience, she regarded both
with a superstitious dread, that they would
finally prevail.</P>
<P>Lost in this melancholy reverie, and
shedding frequent tears, Emily was at length
roused by Montoni, and she followed him
to the cabin, where refreshments were
spread, and her aunt was seated alone. The
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
countenance of Madame Montoni was in‚à£flamed
with resentment, that appeared to
be the consequence of some conversation
she had held with her husband, who regard‚à£ed
her with a kind of sullen disdain, and
both preserved, for some time, a haughty
silence. Montoni then spoke to Emily of
Mons. Quesnel: ‚ÄúYou will not, I hope,
persist in disclaiming your knowledge of
the subject of my letter to him?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou had sir, that it was no longer
necessary for me to disclaim it,‚Äù said Emily,
‚ÄúI had hoped, from your sillence, that you
was convinced of your error.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou have hoped impossibilities then,‚Äù
replied Montoni; ‚ÄúI might as reasonably
have expected to find sincerity and uni‚à£formity
of conduct in one of your sex,
as you to convict me of error in this af‚à£fair,‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily bllushed, and was silent; she now
perceived too clearly, that she had hoped
an impossibility, for, where no mistake had
been committed no conviction could follow;
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
and it was evident, that Montoni's conduct
had not been the consequence of mistake,
but of design.</P>
<P>Anxious to escape from conversation,
which was both afflicting and humiliating to her, she
soon returned to the deck, and
resumed her station near the stern, without
apprehension of cold, for no vapour rose
from the water, and the air was dry and
tranquil; here, at least, the benevolence
of nature allowed her the quiet which Mon‚à£toni
had denied her elsewhere. It was
now past midnight. The stars shed a kind
of twilight, that served to shew the dark
outline of the shores on either hand, and
the grey surface of the river; till the moon
rose from behind a high palm grove, and
shed her mellow lustre over the scene. The
vessel glided smoothly on: amid the still‚à£ness
of the hour Emily heard, now and
then, the solitary voice of the barge-men on
the bank, as they spoke to their horses;
while, from a remote part of the vessel,
with melancholy song,
<Q><PB N="126" REF="128"/>
<L>‚Äî‚ÄúThe sailor sooth'd,</L>
<L>Beneath the trembling moon, the midnight wave,‚Äù</L></Q></P>
<P>Emily, meanwhile,. anticipated her re‚à£ception
by Mons and Madame Quesnel,
considered what she should say on the sub‚à£ject
of La VallÈe; and then, to with-hold
her mind from more anxious topics, tried
to amuse herself by discriminating the faint‚à£drawn
features of the landscape, reposing
in the moon-light. While her fancy thus
wandered, she saw, at a distance, a building
peeping between the moon-light trees, and,
as the barge approached, heard voices speak‚à£ing,
and soon distinguished the lofty portico
of a villa, overshadowed by groves of pine
and sycamore, which she recollected to be
the same. that had formerly been pointed
out to her, as belonging to Madame Ques‚à£nel's
relative.</P>
<P>The barge stopped at a flight of marble
steps, which led up the bank to a lawn.
Lights appeared between some pillars be‚à£yond
the portico. Montoni sent forward
his servant, and then disembarked with his
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
family. They found Mons. and Madame
Quesnel, with a few friends, seated on sofas
in the portico, enjoying the cool breeze of
the night, and eating fruits and ices, while
some of their servants at a little distance, on
the river's bank., were performing a simple
serenade. Emily was now accustomed to
the way of living in this warm country, and
was not surprised to find Mons. and Madame
Quesnel in their portico, two hours after
midnight.</P>
<P>The usual salutations being over, the
company seated themselves in the portico,
and refreshments were brought them from
the adjoining hall, where a banquet was
spread, and servants attended. When
the bustle of this meeting had subsided,
and Emily had recovered from the little
flutter into which it had singular beauty of
the hall, so perfectly accommodated to the
luxuries of the season. It was of white
marble, and the roof, rising into an open
cupola, was supported by columns of the
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
same material, Two opposite sides of the
appartment, terminating in open porticos ad‚à£mitted
to the hall a full view of the gardens,
and of the river scenery; in the centre a
fountain continually refreshed the air, and
seemed to heighten the fragrance, that
breathed from the surrounding orangeries,
while its dashing waters gave an agreeable
and soothing sound. Etruscan lamps, sus‚à£pended
from the pillars, diffused a brilliant
light over the interior part of the hall,
leaving the remoter porticos to the softer
lustre of the moon.</P>
<P>Mons. Quesnel talked apart to Montoni
of his own affairs, in his usual strain of
self-importance; boasted of his new ac‚à£quisitions,
and then affected to pity some
disappoinments, which Montoni had lately
sustained. Meanwhile, the latter, whose
pride at least enabled him todespise such
vanity as this, and whose descernment at
once detected under this assumed pity,
the frivolous malignity of Quisnel's mind,
listened to him in contemptuous silence,
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
till he named his niece, and then they
left the portico, and walked away into the
gardens.</P>
<P>Emily, however, still attended to Madame
Quesnel, who spoke of France (for even
the name of her native country was dear
to her) and she found some pleasure in
looking at a person, who had lately been in
it. That country, too, was inhabited by
Valancourt, and she listened to the men‚à£tion
of it, with a faint hope, that he also
would be named. Madame Quesnel, who,
when she was in France, had talked with
rapture of Italy, now, that she was in Italy,
talked with equal praise of France, and en‚à£deavoured
to excite the wonder and the envy
of her auditors by accounts of places, which
they had not been happy enough to see.
In these descriptions she not only imposed
upon them, but upon herself, for she never
thought a present pleasure equal to one, that
was passed; and thus the delicious climate,
the fragrant orangeries and all the luxuries,
which surrounded her, slept unnoticed, while
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
her fancy wandered over the distant scenes
of a northern country.</P>
<P>Emily listened in vain for the name of
Valancourt. Madame Montoni spoke in
her turn of the delights of Venice, and of
the pleasure she expected from visiting the
fine castle of Montoni, on the Apennine;
which latter mention, at least was merely a
retaliating boast, for Emily well knew, that
her aunt had no taste for solitary grandeur,
and, particularly, for such as the castle of
Udolpho promised. Thus the party con‚à£tinued
to converse, and, as far as civility
would permit, to torture each other by mu‚à£tual
boasts, while they reclined on sofas in
the portico, and were environed with de‚à£lights
both from nature and art, by which
any honest minds would have been tempered
to benevolence, and happy imaginations
would have been soothed into enchant‚à£ment.</P>
<P>The dawn, soon after, trembled in the
eastern horizon, and the light tints of morn‚à£ing,
gradually expanding, shewed the beau‚à£tifully
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
declining forms of the Italian moun‚à£tains
and the gleaming landscapes, stretched
at their feet. Then the sun-beams, shooting
up from behind the hills, spread over the
scene that fine saffron tinge, which seems
to impart repose to all it touches. The
landscape no longer gleamed; all its
glowing colours were revealed, except
that its remoter features were still soften‚à£ed
and united in the mist of distance, whose
sweet effect was heightened to Emily by the
dark verdure of the pines and cypresses,
that over-arched the fore-ground of the
river.</P>
<P>The market people, passing with their
boats to Venice, now formed a moving
picture on the Brenta. Most of these had
little painted awnings, to shelter their owners
from the sun-beams, which, together with the
piles of fruit and flowers, displayed beneath,
and the tasteful simplicity of the peasant
girls, who watched the rural treasures,
rendered them gay and striking objects.
The swift movement of the boats down the
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
current, the quick glance of oars in the wa‚à£ter,
and now and then the passing chorus of
peasants, who reclined under the sail of their
little bark, or the tones of some rustic in‚à£strument,
played by a girl, as she sat near
her sylvan cargo, heightened the animation
and festivity of the scene.</P>
<P>When Montoni and M. Quesnel had
joined the ladies, the party left the portico
for the gardens, where the charming scenery
soon withdrew Emily's thoughts from pain‚à£ful
subjects. The majestic forms and rich
verdure of cypresses she had never seen
so perfect before: groves of cedar, lemon,
and orange, the spiry clusters fo the pine
and poplar, the luxuriant chesnut and
oriental plane, threw all their pomp of shade
over these gardens; while bowers of flower‚à£ing
myrtle and other spicy shrubs mingled
their fragrance with that of flowers, whose
vivid and various colouring glowed with
increased effect beneath the contrasted um‚à£brage
of the groves. The air also was con‚à£tinually
refreshed by rivulets, which, with
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
more taste than fashion, had been suffered
to wander among the green recesses.</P>
<P>Emily often lingered behind the party,
to contemplate the distant landscape, that
closed a vista, or that gleamed beneath the
dark foliage of the foreground;- the spiral
summits of the mountains, touched with a
purple tint, broken and steep above, but
shelving gradually to their base; the open
valley, marked by no formal lines of art;
and the tall groves of cypress, pine and pop‚à£lar,
sometimes embellished by a ruined villa,
whose broken columns appeared between
the branches of a pine, that seemed to
droop over their fall.</P>
<P>From other parts of the gardens, the
character of the view was entirely changed,
and the fine solitary beauty of the landscape
shifted for the crowded features and varied
colouring of inhabitation.</P>
<P>The sun was now gaining fast upon the
sky, and the party quitted the gardens, and
retired to repose.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<Q>‚ÄúAnd poor Misfortune feels the lash of Vice.‚Äù
<BIBL>THOMPSON.</BIBL></Q>
<P>EMILY seized the first opportunity of
conversing alone with Mons. Quesnel, con‚à£cerning
La VallÈe. His answers to her
enquiries were concise, and delivered with
the air of a man, who is conscious of pos‚à£sessing
absolute power and impatient of
hearing it questioned. He declared, that
the disposal of the place was a necessary
measure; and that she might consider herself
indebted to his prudence for even the small
income that remained for her. ‚ÄúBut,
however,‚Äù added he,‚Äù when this Venetian
Count (I have forgot his name) marries
you, your present disagreeable state of de‚à£pendence
will cease. As a relation to you
I rejoice in the circumstance, which is so
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
fortunate for you, and, I may add, so un‚à£expected
by your friends.‚Äù</P>
<P>For some moments Emily was chilled
into silence by this speech; and, when she
attempted to undeceive him, concerning
the purport of the note she had inclosed in
montoni's letter, he appeared to have some
private reason for disbelieving her assertion,
and, for a considerable time, persevered in
accusing her of capricious conduct. Being,
at length, however, convinced, that she
really disliked Morano and had positively
rejected his suit, his resentment was extra‚à£vagant,
and he expressed it in terms equally
pointed and inhuman; for, secretly flat‚à£tered
by the prospect of a connection with
a nobleman, whose title he had affected to
forget, he was incapable of feeling pity for
whatever sufferings of his niece might stand
in the way of his ambition.</P>
<P>Emily saw at once in his manner all the
difficulties, that awaited her, and though no
oppression could have power to make her
renounce Valancourt for Morano, her for‚à£titude
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
now trembled at an encounter with
the violent passions of her uncle.</P>
<P>She opposed his turbulence and indigna‚à£tion
only by the mild dignity of a supe‚à£rior
mind; but the gentle firmness of her
conduct served to exasperate still more his
resentment, since it compelled him to feel
his own inferiority, and, when he left her,
he declared, that if she persisted in her
folly, both himself and Montoni would
abandon her to the contempt of the world.</P>
<P>The calmnes,s she had assumed in his
presence failed Emily, when alone, and she
wept bitterly, and called frequently upon
the name of her departed father, whose
advice to her from his death-bed she then
remembered. ‚ÄúAlas!‚Äù said she,‚ÄúI do
indeed perceive how much more valuable
is the strength of fortitude than the grace
of sensibility, and I will also endeavour to
fulfil the promise I then made; I will not
indulge in unavailing lamentaton, but will
try to endure, with firmness the oppresion
I cannot elude.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139"/>
Somewhat soothed by the consciousness
of performing a part of St. Aubert's last re‚à£quest,
and of endeavouring to pursue the
conduct which he would have approved,
the overcame her tears, and when the com‚à£pany
met at dinner, had recovered her usual
serenity of countenance.</P>
<P>In the cool of the evening, the ladies
took the <HI>fersco</HI> along the bank of the Brenra
in Madame Quesnel's carriage. The state
of Emily's mind was in melancholy contrast
with the gay groups assembled beneath the
shades that overhung this enchanting stream.
Some were dancing under the trees, and
others reclining on the grass, taking ices
and coffee and calmly enjoying the effect
of a beautiful evening, on a luxuriant land‚à£scape,
when she looked at the snow-capt.
Apennines, ascending in the dis‚à£tance,
thought of Montoni's castle' and
suffered some terror, lest he should convey
her thither, for the purpose of enforcing her
obedience; but the thought vanished, when
she considered, that se was as much in
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
his power at Venice as she could be Ëlse‚à£where.</P>
<P>It was moonlight before the party re‚à£turned
to the villa, where supper was spread
in the airy hall, which had so much enchant‚à£ed
Emily's fancy, on the preceding night.
The ladies seated themselves in the portico,
till Mons. Quesnel, Montoni and other gen‚à£tlemen,
should join them at table, and Emily
endeavoured to resign herself to the tranquil‚à£lity
of the hour. Persently, a barge stopped
at the steps that led into the gardens, and
soon after, she distinguished, the voices of
Montoni and Quesnel, and then that of
Morano, who, in the next moment, appear‚à£ed.
His compliments she received in si‚à£lence,
and her cold air seemed at first to
discompos him; but he soon recovered his
usual gaiety of manner, though the officious
kindness of M.and Madame Quesnel Emily
perceived disgusted him. such a degree of
attention she had scarcely believed could be
shewn by M. Quesnel, for she had never
before seen him otherwise than in the pre‚à£sence
of his inferiors or equals.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141"/>
When she could retire to her own apart‚à£ment,
her mind almost
involuntarily dwelt
on the most probable means of prevailing
with the Count to withdraw his suit, and to
her liberal mind none appeared more pro‚à£bable,
than that of acknowledging to him a
prior attachment and throwing herself upon
his generosity for a release. When, how‚à£ever,
on the following day, he renewed his
addresses, she shrunk from the adoption of
the plan she had formed. There was some‚à£thing
so repugnant to her just pride, in
laying open the secret of her heart to such
a man as Morano, and in suing to him for
compassion, that she impatiently rejected this
design and wondered, that she could have
paused upon it for a moment. The rejec‚à£tion
of his suit she repeated in the most
decisive terms she could select, mingling
with it a severe consure of his conduct;
but, though the Count appeared morti‚à£fied
by this, he persevered in the most ar‚à£dent
professions of admiration, till he
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
was interrupted and Emily released by the
presence of Madame Quesnel.</P>
<P>during her stay at this pleasant villa,
Emily was thus rendered miserable by the
assiduities of Morano, together with the
cruelly exerted authority of M. Quesnel
and Montoni, who with her aunt, seemed
now more resolutely determined upon this
marriage than they had even appeared to be
at Venice. M. Quesnel, finding, that both
argument and menace were ineffectual in
enforcing an immediate conclusion to it,
at length relinquished his endeavours, and
trusted to the power of Montoni and to the
course of events at Venice. Emily, indeed,
looked to Venice with hope, for there she
would be relieved in some measure from
the persecution of Morano, who would no
longer be an inhabitant of the same house
with herself, and from that of Montoni,
whose engagements would not permit him
to be continually at home. But amidst the
pressure of her own misfortunes, she did
not forget those of poor Theresa, for whom
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
she pleaded with courageous tenderness to
Quesnel, who promised, in slight and ge‚à£neral
terms, that she should not be for‚à£gotten.</P>
<P>Montoni, in a long conversation with
M. Quesnel, arranged the plan to be pur‚à£sued
respecting Emily, and M. Quesnel
proposed to be at Venice, as soon as he
should be informed, that the nuptials were
concluded.</P>
<P>It was new to Emily to part with any
person, with whom she was connected, with‚à£out
feelings of regret; the moment, how‚à£ever,
in which she took leave of M.and
Madame Quesnel, was, perhaps, the only
satisfactory one she had known in their
presence.</P>
<P>Morano returned in Montoni's barge,
and Emily, as she watched her gradual ap‚à£proach
to that magic city, saw at her side
the only person, who occasioned her to
view it with less than perfect delight. They
arrived there about midnight, when Emily
was released from the presence of the Count,
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
who, with Montoni, went to a Casino, and
she was suffered to retire to her own apart‚à£ment.</P>
<P>On the following day, Montoni, in a
short conversation, which he held with
Emily, informed her, that he would no
longer be <HI>trifled</HI> with, and that, since her
marriage with the Count would be so highly
advantageous to her, that folly only could
object to it, and folly of such extent as was
incapable of conviction, it should be ce‚à£lebrated
without further delay, and, if that
was necessary, without her consent.</P>
<P>Emily, who had hitherto tried remon‚à£strance,
had now recourse to supplication,
for distress prevented her from foreseeing,
that with a man of Montoni's disposition,
supplication would be equally useless. She
afterwards enquired by what right he ex‚à£erted
this unlimited authority over her!
a question, which her better judgment
would have with-held her, in a calmer mo‚à£ment,
from making, since it could avail
her nothing, and would afford Montoni
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
another opportunity of triumphing over her
defenceless condition.</P>
<P>‚ÄúBy what right!‚Äù cried Montoni,
with a malicious smile, ‚Äúby the right of
my will; if you can elude that, I will not
enquire by what right you do so. I now
remind you, for the last time, that you are
a stranger, in a foreign country, and that
it is your interest to make me your friend;
you know the means; if you compel me
to become your enemy- I will venture
to tell you, that the punishment shall ex‚à£ceed
your expectation. You may know
I am not to be trifled with.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily continued, for some time after
Montoni had left her, in a state of despair,
or rather of stupefaction; a consciousness
of misery was all that remained in her mind.
in this situation Madame Montoni found
her, at the sound of whose voice Emily
looked up, and her aunt, somewhat softened
by the expression of despair, that fixed her
countenance, spoke in a manner more kind
than she had ever yet done. Emily's heart
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
was touched; she shed tears, and, after
weeping for some time, recovered suffi‚à£cient
composure to speak on the subject of
her distress, and to endeavour to interest
Madame Montoni in her behalf. But,
though the compassion of her aunt had
been surprised, her ambition was not to be
overcome, and her present object was to be
the aunt of a Countess. Emily's efforts,
therefore, were as unsuccessful as they had
been with Montoni, and she withdrew to
her apartment to think and weep alone.
How often did she remember the parting
scence with Valancourt, Montoni's character
with less reserve! When her mind, however,
had recovered from the first shock of this
behavior, she considered, that it would be
impossible for him to compel her alliance
with Morano, if she persisted in refusing
to repeat any part of the marriage cere‚à£money;
and she persevered in her resolu‚à£tion
to await Montoni's threatened ven‚à£geance
rather than give herself for life to a
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
man, whom she must have despised for his
present conduct, had she never even loved
Valancourt: yet she trembled at the re‚à£venge
she thus resolved to brave.</P>
<P>An affair, however, soon after occurred,
which somewhat called off Montoni's at‚à£tention
from Emily. The mysterious visits
of Orsino were renewed with more fre‚à£quency
since the return of the former to
Venice. There were others, also, besides
Orsino, admitted to these midnight coun‚à£cils,
and among them Cavigni and Verezzi‚à£Montoni
became more reserved and austere
in his manner than ever; and Emily, regard‚à£less
of his, might have perceived, that some‚à£thing
extraordinary was working in his
Mind.</P>
<P>One night, on which a council was not
held, Orsino came in great agitation of
spirits, and dispatched his considential ser‚à£vant
to Montoni, who was at a Casino,
desiring; that he would return home imme‚à£diately;
but charging the servant not to
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
mention his name. Montoni obeyed the
summon, and, on meeting Orsino, was in‚à£formed
of the circumstances, that occasioned
his visit and his visible alarm, with a part
of which he was already acquainted.</P>
<P>A venetian nobleman, who had, on
some late occasion, provoked the hatred
of Osino, had been way-laid and poniarded
by hired assassins: and, as the murdered
person was of the first connections, the Se‚à£nate
had taken up the affair. One of the
Sassassins was now apprehended, who had
consessed, that Orsino was his employer in
the atrocious deed; and the latter, informed
of his danger, had now come to montoni to
consult on the measures necessary to favour
his escape. He knew, that, at this time, the
officers of the police were upon the watch
for him, all over the city; to leave it, at
present, therefore was impracticable, and
Montoni consented to secrete him for a few
days till the vigilance of justice should re‚à£lax,
and then to assist him in quitting Ve‚à£nice.
He knew the danger he himself in‚à£curred
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
by permitting Orsino to remain in
his house, but such was the nature of his
obligations to this man, that he did not
think it prudent to refuse him an asylum.
such was the person whom Montoni had
admitted to his confidence, and for whom
he felt as much friendship as was compa‚à£tible
with his character.</P>
<P>While Orsino remained concealed in his
house, Montoni was unwilling to attract pub‚à£lic
observation by the nuptials of Count Mo‚à£rano;
but this obstacle was, in a few days,
overcome by the departure of his criminal
visitor, and he then informed Emily, that her
marriage was to be celebrated on the follow‚à£ing
morning. To her repeated assurances, that
it should not take place, he replied only by a
a malignant smile; and,telling her, that the
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
Count and a priest would be at his house,
early in the morning, he advised her no fur‚à£ther
to dare his resentment, by opposition to
his will and to her own interest. ‚ÄúI am now
going out for the evening,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúre‚à£member,
that I shall give your hand to
Count Morano in the morning.‚Äù Emily,
having, ever since his late threats, expected,
that her trails would at length arrive to
this crisis, was less shocked by the decla‚à£ration,
than she otherwise would have been,
and she endeavoured to support herself by
the belief, that the marriage could not be
valid, so long as she refused before the priest
to repeat any part of the ceremony. Yet,
as the moment of trail approached, her
long-harassed spirits shrunk almost equally
from the encounter of his vengeance, and
from the hand of Count Morano. She was
not even perfectly certain of the consequence
of her steady refusal at the altar, and she
trembled, more than ever, at the power of
Montoni, which seemed unlimited as his
will, for she saw, that he would not scruple
to transgress any law, if, by so doing, he
could accomplish his project.</P>
<P>While her mind was thus suffering and in
a state little short of distraction, she was in‚à£formed
that Morano asked permission to fee
her, and the servant had scarcely departed
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
with an excuse, before she repented that
she had sent one. In the next moment,
reverting to her former design, and deter‚à£mining
to try, whether expostulation and
entreaty would not succeed, where a refusal
and a just disdain had failed, she recalled
the servant, and, sending a different message,
prepared to go down to the Count.</P>
<P>The dignity and assumed composure with
which she met him, and the kind of pensive
resignation, that softened her countenance,
were circumstances not likely to induce him
to relinquish her, serving, as they did, to
heighten a passion, which had already in‚à£toxicated
his judgment. He listened to
all she said with an appearance of compla‚à£cency
and of a wish to oblige her; but
his resolution remained invariably the same,
and he endeavoured to win her admiration
by every insinuating art he so well knew
how to practise. Being, at length, assured
that she had nothing to hope from his
justice, she repeated, in a solemn and im‚à£pressive
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
manner, her absolute rejection of his
suit, and quitted him with an assurance, that
her refusal would be effectually maintained
against every circumstance, that could be
imagined for subduing it. A just pride had
resrained her tears in his presence, but now
they flowed from the fulness of her heart.
She often called upon the name of her late
father, and often dwelt with unutterable
anguish on the idea of Valancourt.</P>
<P>She did not go down to supper, but re‚à£mained
alone in her apartment, sometimes
yielding to the influence of grief and terror,
and, at others, endeavouring to fortify her
mind against them, and to prepare herself
to meet, with composed courage, the scene
of the following morning, when all the
stratagem of Morano and the violence of
Montoni would be united against her.</P>
<P>The evening was far advanced, when
Madame Montoni came to her chamber
With from bridal ornaments, which the
Count had sent to Emily. She had, this
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
day, purposely avoided her niece; perhaps,
because her usual insensibility failed her,
and she feared to trust herself with a view of
Emily's distress; or possibly, though her con‚à£science
was seldom audible, it now reproach‚à£ed
her with her conduct to her brother's or‚à£phan
child, whose happiness had been
entrusted to her care by a dying father.</P>
<P>Emily could not look at these presents,
and made a last, though almost hopeless,
effort to interest the compassion of Madame
Montoni, who, if she did feel any degree
of pity, or remorse, successfully concealed
being miserable, concerning a marriage,
which ought only to make her happy,‚ÄùI
am sure,‚Äúsaid she,‚Äúif I was unmarried,
and the Count had proposed to me, I should
have been flattered by the distinction: and
if I should have been so, I am sure, niece,
you, who have no fortune, ought to feel
yourself highly honoured, and shew a pro‚à£per
gratitude and humility towards the
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
Count, for his condescension. I am often
surprised, I must own, to observe how
humbly he deports himself to you, not‚à£withstanding
the haughty airs you give
yourself; I wonder he has patience to hu‚à£mour
you so: if I was he, I know, I should
often be ready to reprehend you, and make
you know yourself a little better. I would
not have flattered you, I can tell you, for
it is this absurd flattery that makes you
fancy yourself of so much consequence, that
you think nobody can deserve you, and I
often tell the Count so, for I have no pa‚à£tience
to hear him to pay you such extra‚à£vagant
compliments, which you believe
every word of!‚Äù</P>
<P>"Your patience, madam, cannot suffer
more cruelly on such occasions, than my
own,‚Äúsaid Emily.</P>
<P>‚Äúo! that is all mere affectation,‚Äùre‚à£joined
her aunt.‚ÄúI know that his flattery
delights you' and makes you so vain, that
you think you may have the whole world
at your feet. But you are very much mis‚à£taken;
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
I can assure you, niece, you will
not meet with many such suitors as the
Count: every other person would have turned
upon his heel, and left you to repent at your
liesure, long ago.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚Äúo that the Count had resembled every
other person, then!‚Äùsaid Emily, with a
heavy sigh.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is happy for you, that he does not,‚Äù
rejoined Madame Montoni;‚Äúand what I
am now saying is from pure kindness. I am
endeavouring to convince you of your good
fortune, and to persuade you to submit to
necessity with a good grace. It is nothing
to me, you know, whether you like this
marriage or not, for it must be; what I say,
therefore, is from pure kindness. I wish to
fee you happy, and it is your own sault if
you are not so. I would ask you, now,
seriously and calmly, what kind of a match
you can expect, since a Count cannot con‚à£tent
your ambition?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI have no ambition whatever, ma‚à£dam,‚Äù
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
replied Emily,‚Äúmy only wish is
to remain in my present station.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚Äúo! that is speaking quite from the
purpose,‚Äùsaid her aunt,‚ÄúI fee you are
still thinking of Mons. Valancourt. Pray
get rid of all those fantastic notions about
love, and this ridiculous pride, and be
something like reasonable creature. But,
however, this is nothing to the purpose‚à£for
your marriage with the Count takes
place to-morrow, you know, whether you
approve it or not. The Count will be trisled
with no longer.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily maid no attempt to reply to this
curious speech; she felt it would be mean,
and she knew it wold be useless. Ma‚à£dame
Montoni laid down the Count's presents
upon the table, on which Emily was lean‚à£ing,
and, then, desiring she would be ready
early in the morning, bade her good-night.
‚ÄúGood-night madam,‚Äùsaid Emily, with
a deep sigh, as the door closed upon her
aunt, and she was left once more to her
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
own fad reflections. For some time she fat
so lost in thought, as to be wholly uncon‚à£scious
where she was; at length, raising
her head, and looking round the room,
its gloom and profound stillness awed her.
She fixed her eyes on the door, through
which her aunt had disappeared, and list‚à£ened
anxiously for some found, that might
relieve the deep dejection of her spirits; but
it was past midnight, and all the family,
except the servant, who sat up for Montoni,
had retired to bed. Her mind, long ha‚à£rassed
by distress, now yielded to imaginary
terrors; she trembled to look into the ob‚à£scurity
of her spacious chamber, and feared
she knew not what; a state of mind, which
continued so long, that she would have
called up Annette, her aunt's woman, had
her fear permitted her to rise from her
chair, and to cross the apartment.</P>
<P>These melancholy at length be‚à£gan
to disperse, and she retired to her bed,
not to sleep, for that was scarcely possible,
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
but to try, at least, to quiet her disturbed
fancy, and to collect strength of spirits suf‚à£ficient
to bear her through the scene of the
approaching morning.</P>

<P>EMILY was recalled from the kind of
slumber, into which she had, at length,
sunk, by a quick knocking at her chamber
door. She started up in terror, for Mon‚à£toni
and Count Morano instantly came to
her mind; but, having listened in silence
for some time, and recognising the voice of
Annette, she rose and opened the door.
‚ÄúWhat brings you hither so early?‚Äùsaid
Emily, trembling excessively. She was un‚à£able
to support herself, and sat down on
the bed.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160"/>
‚ÄúDear ma'amselle!‚Äùsaid Annette,‚Äúdo
not look for pale. I am quite frightened to
see you. Here is a fine bustle below stairs,
all the servants running to and fro, and
none of them fast enough! Here is a bustle,
indeed, all of a sudden, and nobody knows
for what!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWho is below besides them?‚Äùsaid
Emily,‚ÄúAnnette, do not trifle with me!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNot for the world, ma'amselle, I
would not trifle for the world; but one can‚à£not
help making one's remarks, and there
is the signor in such a bustle, as I never saw
ma'am, to get ready immediately.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúGood God support me!‚Äùcried Emily,
almost sainting,‚ÄúCount Morano is below,
then!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo, ma'amselle, he is not below that
I know of,‚Äùreplied Annette,‚Äúonly his
Excellenza sent me to desire you would get
ready directly to leave Venice, for that the
gondolas would be at the steps of the canal
in a few minutes: but I must hurry back
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
to my lady, who is just at her wits end,
and knows not which way to turn for
haste.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúExplain, Annette, explain the mean‚à£ing
of all this before you go,‚Äùsaid Emily,
so overcome with surprise and timid hope,
that she had scarcely breath to speak.</P>
<P>‚ÄúNay. Ma'amselle, that is more than
I can do. I only know that the Signor is
just come home in a very ill humour, that
he has had us all called out of our beds,
and tells us we are all to leave Venice im‚à£mediately.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIs Count Morano to go with the Sig‚à£nor?‚Äù
said Emily,‚Äúand whither are we
going?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI know neither, ma'am for certain;
but I heard Ludovico say something about
going, after we got to Terra-firma, to the
Signor's castle among some mountains, that
he talked of.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThe Apennines!‚Äùsaid Emily, eagerly,
‚Äúo! then I have little to hope!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThat is the very place, ma'am. But
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
cheer up, and do not take it so much to
heart, and think what a little time you
have to get ready in, and how impatient
the Signor is. Holy St. Mark! I hear
the oars of the canal; and now they come
nearer, and now they are dashing at the steps
below; it is gondola, sure enough.‚Äù</P>
<P>Aannette hastened from the room; and
Emily prepared for this unexpected flight
as fast as her trembling hands would per‚à£mit,
not perceiving, that any change in her
situation could possibly be for the worse.
She had scarcely thrown her books and
clothes into her travelling trunk, when, re‚à£ceiving
a seconds summons, she went down
to her aunt's dressing room, where she found
Montoni impatiently reproving his wife
for delay. He went out, soon after, to give
some further orders to his people, and
Emily then enquired the occasion of this
hasty journey; but her aunt appeared to be
as ignorant as herself, and to undertake the
journey with more reluctance.</P>
<P>The family at length embarked, but nei‚à£ther
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
Count Morano, or Cavigni, was of
the party. Somewhat received by observing
this, Emily, when the gondolieri dashed
their oars in the water, and put of from the
steps of the portico, felt like a criminal, who
receive a short reprieve. Her heart beat yet
lighter, when hey emerged from the canal
into the ocean, and lighter still, when they
skimmed past the walls of St. Marks, with‚à£out
having stopped to take up Count Mo‚à£rano.</P>
<P>The dawn now began to tint the horizon,
and to break upon the shores of the Adri‚à£atic.
Emily did not venture to ask any
questions of Montoni, who sat, for some
time, in gloomy silence, and then rolled
himself up in his cloak, as if to sleep, while
Madame Montoni did the fame; but Emily,
who could not sleep, undrew one of the little
curtains of the gandola, and looked out
upon the sea. The rising dawn now enlight‚à£ened
the mountain-tops of Fruili, but their
lower sides, and the distant waves, that
rolled at their feet, were still in deep shadow.
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
Emily, sunk tranquil melancholy, watched
the strengthening light spreading upon the
ocean, shewing successively Venice and her
islets, and the shores of Italy, along which
boats, with their pointed latin fails, began
to move.</P>
<P>The gondolieri were frequently hailed,
at this early hour, by the market people, as
they glided by towards Venice, and the
Lagune soon displayed the gay scene of innu‚à£merable
little barks, paffing from Terra-firma
with provisions. Emily gave a last look
to that splendid city, but her mind was
then occupied by considering the probable
events, that awaited her, in the scenes, to
which she was removing, and with conjec‚à£tures,
concerning the motive of this sudden
journey. It appeared, upon calmer confide‚à£ration,
that montoni was removing her to
his secluded castle, because he could there,
with more probability of success, attempt to
terrify her into obedience; or that, should
its gloomy and sequestered scenes fail of
this effect, her forced marriage with the
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
Count could there be solemnized with
the secrecy, which was necessary to the ho‚à£nour
of Montoni. The little spirit, which
this reprieve had recalled, now began to
fail, and, when Emily reached the shore,
her mind had sunk into all its former de‚à£pression.</P>
<P>Montoni did not embark on the Brenta,
but persuad his way in carriages across the
country, towards the Apennine; during
which journey, his manner to Emily was
so particularly severe, that this alone would
have confirmed her conjecture, had any
such confirmation been necessary. Her
senses were now dead to the beautiful coun‚à£try,
through which she traveled. Sometimes
she was compelled to smile at the naivet
of Annette, in her remarks on what she
saw, and sometimes to sigh, as a scene of
peculiar beauty recalled Valancourt to her
thoughts, who was indeed seldom absent
from them, and of whom she could never
hope to hear in the solitude, to which she
was hastening.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166"/>
At length, the travellers began to ascend
among the Apennines. The immense pine‚à£forests,
which, at the period, overhung
these mountains, and between which the
road wound, excluded all view but of the
cliffs aspiring above, except, that, now and
then an opening through the dark woods
allowed the eye a momentary glimpse of
the country below. The gloom of these
shades, their solitary silence, except when
the breeze swept over their summits, the
tremendous precipices of the mountains,
that came partially to the eye, each assisted
to raise the solemnity of Emily's feelings
into awe; she saw only images of gloomy
grandeur, or of dreadful sublimity, around
her; other images, equally gloomy and
equally terrible, gleamed on her imagina‚à£tion.
She was going scarcely knew
whither, under the dominion of a person,
from whose arbitrary disposition she had
already suffered so much, to marry, per‚à£haps,
a man who possessed neither her af‚à£fection,
or esteem; or to endure, beyond
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
the hope of succour, whatever punishment re‚à£venge,
and that Italian revenge, might dictate.
‚ÄîThe more she considered what might be
the motive of the journey, the more she
became convinced, that it was for the pur‚à£pose
of concluding her nuptials with Count
Morano, with that secrecy which her reso‚à£lute
resistance had made necessary to te
honour, if not to be safety,‚Äúof Montoni.
From the deep solitudes, into which she was
immerging, and from the gloomy castle,
of which she had heard some systerious
hints, her sick heart recoiled despair,
and she experienced, that, though her mind
was already occupied by peculiar distress,
it was still alive to the influence of new and
local circumstance; why else did she shud‚à£der
at the idea of this desolate castle?</P>
<P>As the travelers still ascended among the
pine forests, steep rose over steep, the moun‚à£tains
seemed to multiply, as they went, and
what was the summit of one eminence
proved to be only the base of another, At
length, they reached a little plain, where
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
the drivers stopped to rest the mules, whence
a scene of such extent and magnificence
opened below, as drew even from Madame
Montoni a note of admiration. Emily
lost, for a moments, her sorrows, in the im‚à£mensity
of nature. Beyond the amphi‚à£theatre
of mountains, that streched below,
whose tops appeared as numerous almost, as
the waves of the sea, and whose feet were
concealed by the forests‚Äîextended the
Campagna of Italy, where cities and rivers,
and woods and all the glow of cultivation
were mingled in gay confusion. The Adri‚à£atic
bounded the horizon, into which the
Po and the Brenta, after winding through
the whole extent of the landscape, poured
their fruitful waves. Emily gazed long on
the splendours of the world she was quitting,
of which the whole magnificence seemed
thus given to her sight only to increase her
regret on leaving it; for her, Valancourt
alone was in that world; to him alone her
heart turned, and for him alone fell her bit‚à£ter
tears.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169"/>
From this sublime scene the travellers
continued to ascend among the pines, till they
entered a narrow pass of the mountains,
which shut out every feature of the distant
country, and, in its stead, exhibited only tre‚à£mendous
crags, impending over the road,
where no vestige of humanity, or even of
vegetation, appeared, except here and there
the trunk and scathed branches of an oak,
that hung nearly headlong from the rock,
into which its strong roots had fastened.
This pass, which led into the heart of the
Apennine, at length opened to day, and
a scene of mountains stretched in long
perspective, as wild as any the travelers
had yet passed. Still vast pine-forests
hung upon their base, and crowned the
ridgy precipice, that rose perpendicularly
from the vale, while, above, the rolling
mists caught the fun-beams, and touched
their cliffs with all the magical colouring
of light and shade. The scene seemed
perpetually changing, and its features to
assume new forms, as the winding road
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
brought them to the eye in different atti‚à£tudes;
while the shifting vapours, now par‚à£tially
concealing their minuter beauties and
now illuminating them with splendid tints,
assisted the illusions of the fight.</P>
<P>Though the deep vallies between these
mountains were, for the most part,
clothed with pines, sometimes an abrupt
opening presented a perspective of only
barren rocks, with a cataract flashing
from their summit among broken cliffs,
till its waters, reaching the bottom,
foamed along with unceasing fury; and
sometimes pastoral scenes exhibited their
‚Äúgreen delights‚Äùin the narrow vales,
smiling amid surrounding horror. There
herds and flocks of gots and sheep, brows‚à£ing
under the shade of hanging woods, and
the shepherd's little cabin, reared on the
margin of a clear stream, presented a sweet
picture of repose.</P>
<P>Wild and romantic as were these scenes,
their character had far less of the sub‚à£lime,
than had those of the Alps, which
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
guard the entrance of Italy. Emily was
often elevated, but seldom felt those emo‚à£ions
of indescribable awe, which she had so
continually experienced, in her pas'sage over
the Alps.</P>
<P>Towards the close of day, the road
wound into a deep valley. Mountains,
whose shaggy steeps appeared to be inaccessi‚à£ble,
almost srrounded it. To the east, a
vista opened, that exhibited the Apennines
in their darkest horrors; and the long per‚à£spective
of retiring summits, rising over each
other, their ridges clothed with pines, ex‚à£habited
a stronger image of grandeur, than
any that Emily had yet seen. The sun had
just sunk below the top of the mountains she
was descending, whose long shadow stretch‚à£ed
athwart the valley, but his sloping rays,
shooting through an opening of the cliffs,
touched with a yellow gleam the sum‚à£mits
of the forest, that hung upon the op‚à£posite
steeps, and streamed in full splendour
upon the towers and battlements of a
castle, that spred its extensive ramparts
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
along the brow of a precipice above. The
splendour of these illumined objects was
heightened by the contrasted shade, which
involved the valley below.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThere,‚Äùsaid Montoni, speaking for
the firs time in several hours, ‚Äúis Udol‚à£pho.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily grazed with melancholy awe upon
the castle, which she understood to be
Montoni,s; for, thogh it was now lighted
up by the setting sun, the gothic greaness
of its fetures, and its mouldering walls of
dark grey stone, rendered it a gloomy and
sublime object. As she gazed, the light
died away on its walls, leaving a melan‚à£choly
purple tint, which spread deeper and
deeper, as the thin vapour crept p the
mountain, wile the battlements above were
still tipped with splendour. From those
too, the rays soon faded, and the whole
edifice was invested with he solemn duski‚à£ness
of evening. Silent, lonely and sublime,
it seemed to stand the sovereign of the
scene, and to frown defiance on all, who
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
dared to invade its solitary reig. As the
twilight deepened, its features became more
awful in obscurity, and Emily continued to
gaze, till its clustering towers were alone
seen, rising over the tops of the woods, be‚à£neath
whose thick shade the carriages soon
after began to ascend.</P>
<P>The extent and darkrness of these tall
woods awakened terrific images in her
mind, and she almost expected to see ban‚à£ditti
start up from under the trees. At
length, the carriages emerged upon a heathy
rock, and, soon after, reached the castle
gates, where the deep tone of the portal
bell, which was struck upon to give notice
of their arrival, increa sed the fearful emo‚à£tions,
that had assailed Emily. While they
waited till the servant within slould come
to open the gates, she anxioussly surveyed the
edifice: but the gloom, that overspread it,
allowed her to distinguish little more than
a part of its outline, with the massy walls
of the ramparts, and to know, that it
was vas, ancient and dreary. From the
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
parts she saw, she judged of the heavy
strength and extent of the whole. The
gateway before her, leading into the courts,
was of gigantic size, nd was desended by
two round towers, crowned by overhang‚à£ing
turrets, embattled, where, instead of
banners, now waved long grass and wild
plants, that had taken root among the
mouldering stones, and which seemed to
sigh, as the breeze rolled past, over the de‚à£solation
around them. The towers were
united by a curtain, pierced and embattled
also, below which appeared the pointed
arch of an huge portcullis, srmounting
the gates: from these, the walls of the
ramparts extended to other towers, over‚à£looking
the precipice, whose shettered out‚à£line,
appearing on a gleam, that lingered
in the west told of the ravages of war‚Äî
of evening.</P>
<P>While Emily gazed with awe upon the
scence, footseps were heard within the gates,
and the undrawing of bolts; after which
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
an ancient servant of the castle appeared, for‚à£cing
back he huge fold of the portal, to
admit his lord. As the carriage-wheels
rolled heavily under the portcullis, Emily's
heart sunk, and she seemed, as if she was
going into her prison; the gloomy court,
into which she passed, served to confirm the
idea, and her imagination, ever awake to
circumstance, suggefted even more terrors,
than her reason could juftify.</P>
<P>Another gate delivered them into the
second court, grass-grown, and more wild
than the first, where, as she surveyed through
the twilight its desolation-its lofty walls,
overtopt-with briony, moss and night‚à£shade,
and the embattled towers that rose
above,-long -suffering and murder came
to her thoughts. One of those instanta‚à£neous
and unaccountable convictions, which
sometimes conquer even strong minds, im‚à£pressed
her with its horror. The sentiment
was not diminished,when she entered an
extensive gothic hall, obscured by the gloom
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
of evening, which a light, glimmering at a
distance through a long perspective of arches
only rendered more striking. As aservant
brought the lamp nearer, partial gleams
fell upon the pillars and the pointed arches,
forming a strong contrast with their sha‚à£dows,
that stretchd along the pavement
and the walls.</P>
<P>The sudden journey of Montony had
prevented his people from making any
other preparations for his reception, than
could be had in the short interval, since the
arrival of the servant, who had been sent
forward from Venice; and this, in some
measure, may account for the air of extreme
desolation, that every where appeared.</P>
<P>The servent, who came to light Montoni,
bowed in silence, and the muscles of his coun‚à£tenance
relaxed with no symptom of joy.‚Äî
Montoni noticed the salutations by a slight
montion of his hand, and passed on, while
his lady, following, and looking round with
a degree of surprise and discontent, which
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
she seemed fearful of expressing, and Emily,
surveying the extent and grandeur of the
hall in timid wonder, approached a marble
stair-case. The arches here opened to a
lofty vault, from the center of which hung
a tripod lamp, which a servant was hastily
lighting; and the rich fret-work of the
roof, a corridor, leading into several upper
apartments, and a painted window, stretch‚à£ing
nearly from the pavement to the ceil‚à£ing
of the hall, become gradually visible.</P>
<P>Having crossed the foot of the stair-case,
and passed through an anti-room, they en‚à£tered
a spacious apartment, whose walls,
Wainscoted with black larch-wood, the
growth of the neighbouring mountains,
were scarcely distinguishable from darkness
itselt. ‚ÄúBring more light,‚Äù said Montoni,
as he entered. The servant, setting down
his lamp, was withdrawing to obey him,
when Madame Montoni observing, that
the evening air of this mountainous re‚à£gion
was cold, and that she should like a
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
fire, Montoni ordered that wood might
be brought.</P>
<P>While he paced the room with thoughtful
steps, nd Madame Montoni sat slently on
a couch, at the upper end of it, waiting
till the servant returned, Emily was ob‚à£serving
the sngular solemnity and desola‚à£tion
of the apartment, viewed, as it now
was, by the glimmer of the single lamp,
placed near a large Venetian mirror, that
duskily reflected the scene, with the tall
figure of Montoni passing slowly along, his
arms folded, nd his countenance shaded
by the plume, that waved in his hat.</P>
<P>Form the contemplation of this scene,
Emily's mind proceeded to the apprehen‚à£sion
of what she might suffer in it, till the
remembrance of valancourt, far, dis‚à£tant!
came to her heart, and softened it
into sorrow. Aheavy sigh escaped her:
but, trying to conceal her tears, she walked
away to one of the high windows, that
opened upon the ramparts, below which,
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
spread the woods she had passed in her ap‚à£proach
to the castle. But the night-shade
sat deeply on the mountains beyond, and
their indented outline alone could be faintly
traced on the horizon, where a red streak
yet glimmered in the west, The valley
between was sunk in darkness.</P>
<P>The scene within, upon which Emily
turned on the opening of the door, was
scarcely less gloomy. The old servant.
who had received them at the gates, now
entered, bending under a load of pine‚à£branches,
while two of Montoni,s Venetian
servants followed with lights.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYour Excellenza is welcome to the
cstle,‚Äù said the old man, as he raised him‚à£self
from the hearth, where he had laid the
wood: ‚Äúit has been a lonely place a long
while; but you will excuse it, Signor,
knowing we had but short notice. It is
near two years, come next feast of St. Mark,
since your Excellenza was within these walls.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou have a good memory, old Carlo,‚Äù
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
said Montoni: ‚Äúit is thereabout; and how
hast thou contrived to live so long?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúA-well-a-day, sir, with much ado;
the cold winds, that blow through the castle
in winter, are almost too much for me; and
I thought sometimes of asking your Excel‚à£lenza
to let me leave he mountains, and go
down into the lowlands. But I don't know
how it is‚ÄîI am loth to quit these old walls
I have lived in so long.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, how have you gone on in the
castle, since I left it?‚Äùsaid Montoni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy much as usual, Signor, only it
want a good deal of repairing. There is
the north tower-some of the battlements
have tumbled down, and had liked one
day to have knocked my poor wife (God
rest her soul!) on the head. Your Excellenza
must know‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, but the repairs,‚Äù interrupted
Montoni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAye, the repairs,‚Äù said carlo:‚Äúa part
of the roof of the great hall has fallen in,
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
and all the winds from the mountains rushed
through it last winter, and whistled through
the whole castle so, that there was no
keeping one's self warm, be where one
would. There, my wife and I used to sit
shvering over a great fire in one corner
of the little hall, ready to die with cold,
and‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúBut there are no more repairs wanted,‚Äù
said Montoni, impatiently.</P>
<P>‚Äúo Lord! your Excellenza, yes-the wall
of the rampart has tumbled down in three
places; then, the stairs, that lead to the
west gallery, have been a long time so bad,
that it is dangerous to go up them; and the
passage leading to the great oak chamber,
that overhangs the north rampart‚Äîone
night last winter I ventured to go there by
myself, and your Excellenza‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, well, enough of this,‚Äù said Mon‚à£toni,
with quickness: ‚ÄúI will talk more
with thee to-morrow.‚Äù</P>
<P>The fire was now lighted; Carlo swept
the hearth, placed chairs, wiped the dust
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
from a large marble table that stood near
it, and then left the room.</P>
<P>Montoni and his family drew round the
fire. Madame Montoni made several at‚à£tempts
at conversation, but his sullen an‚à£swers
repulsed her, while Emily sat endea‚à£vouring
to acquire courage enough to speak
to him. At length, in a tremulous voice,
the said, ‚ÄúMay I ask, sir, the motive of
this sudden journey?‚Äù‚ÄîAfter a long pause,
the recovered sufficient courage to repeat
the question.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt does not suit me to answer enqui‚à£ries,‚Äù
said Montoni, ‚Äúnor does it become
you to make them; time may unfold them
all: but I desire I may be no further ha‚à£rassed,
and I recommend it to you to re‚à£tire
to your chamber, and to endeavour to
adopt a more rational conduct, than that of
yielding to fancies, and to a sensibility,
which, to call it by:the gentlest name, is
only a weakness.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily rose to withdraw. ‚ÄúGood night,
madam,‚Äù said she to her aunt, with an
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
assumed composure, that could not disguise
her emotion.</P>
<P>‚ÄúGood night, my dear,‚Äù said Madame
Montoni, in a tone of kindness, which her
niece had never before heard from her; and
the unexpected endearment brought tears
to Emily's eyes. She curtsied to Montoni,
and was retiring; ‚ÄúBut you do not know
the way to your chamber,‚Äù said her aunt.
Montoni called the servant, who waited
in the anti-room, and bade him send Ma‚à£dame
Montoni's woman, with whom, in
a few minutes, Emily withdrew.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDo you know which is my room?‚Äù
said she to Annette, as they crossed the
hall.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, I believe I do, ma'amselle; but
this is such a strange rambling place! I have
been lost in it already: they call it the
double chamber, over the south rampart,
and I went up this great stair case to it.
My lady's room is at the other end of the
castle.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily ascended the marble flair-cafe,
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
and came to the corridor, as they passed
through which, Annette resumed her chat‚Äî
‚ÄúWhat a wild lonely place this is, ma'am!
I shall be quite frightened to live in it.
How often, and often I have wished my‚à£self
in France again! I little thought, when
I came with my lady to see the world, that
I should ever be shut up in such a place as
this, or I would never have left my own
country! This way, ma'amselle down this
turning. I can almost believe in giants
again, and such like, for this is just like
one of their castles; and, some night or
other; I suppose I shall see fairies too, hop‚à£ping
about in that great old hall, that looks
more like a church, with its huge pillars,
than any thing else.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Emily, smiling, and glad
to escape from, more serious thought, ‚Äúif
we come to the corridor, about midnight,
and look down into the hall, we shall cer‚à£tainly
see it illuminated with a thousand
lamps, and the fairies tripping in gay circles
to the found of delicious music; for it is in
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
such places as this, you know, that they
come to hold their revels. But I am afraid,
Annette, you will not be able to pay the
necessary penance for such a sight: and, if
once they hear your voice, the whole scene
will vanish in an instant.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚Äúo! if you will bear me company,
me'amselle, I will come to the corridor,
this very night, and I promise you I will
hold my tongue; it shall not be my fault
if the show vanishes.‚ÄîBut do you think
they will come?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI cannot promise that with certainty,
but I will venture to say, it will not be your
fault if the enchantment should vanish.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, ma'amselle, that is saying more
than I expected of you: but I am not so
much afraid of fairies, as of ghosts, and they
say there are a plentiful many of them
about the castle: now I should be frightened
to death, if I should chance to see any of
them. But hush! ma'amselle, that is walk softly!
I have thought, several times something
passed by me.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="186"/>
‚ÄúRidiculous!‚Äù said Emily,‚Äúyou must
not indulge such fancies.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚Äúo ma'am I they are not fancies, for
aught I know; Benedetto says these dismal
galleries and halls are sir for nothing but
ghosts to live in; and I verily believe, if I
Iive long in them I shall turn to one my‚à£self!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI hope,‚Äù said Emily, ‚Äúyou will not
suffer Signor Montoni to hear of these
weak fears; they would highly displease
him.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat, you know then, ma'amselle, all
about it!‚Äùrejoined Annette. ‚ÄúNo, no,
I do know better than to do so though,
if the Signor can sleep found, nobody else
in the castle has any right to lie awake, I
am sure.‚ÄùEmily did not appear to notice
this remark.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDown this passage, ma'amselle; this
leads to a back stair-cafe. O! if I see any
thing, I shall be frightened out of my wits!</P>
<P>‚ÄúThat will scarcely be possible,‚Äù said
Emily, smiling, as she followed the wind‚à£ing
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
of the passage, which opened into ano‚à£ther
gallery: and then Annette, perceiving
that she had missed her way, while she had
been so eloquently haranguing on ghosts
and fairies, wandered about through other
passages and galleries, till, at length, fright‚à£ened
by their intricacies, and desolation,
she called aloud for assistance; but they were
beyond the hearing. of the servants, who
were on the other side of the castle, and
Emily now opened the door of a chamber
on die left.</P>
<P>‚ÄúO! do not go in there, ma'amselle,‚Äù
said Annette, ‚Äúyou will only lose yourself
further.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúBring the light forward,‚Äù said Emily,
‚Äúwe may possibly find our way through
these rooms.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette stood at the door, in an at‚à£titude
of hesitation, with the light held
up to shew the chamber, but the seeble
rays spread through not half of it. ‚ÄúWhy
do you hesitate?‚Äùsaid Emily,‚Äúlet me see
whither this room leads.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188"/>
Annette advanced reluctantly. It opened
into a suite of spacious and ancient apart‚à£ments,
some of which were hung with ta‚à£pestry,
and others wainscoted with cedar
and black larch-wood. What furniture
there was, seemed to be altmost as old as the
rooms, and retained an appearance of gran‚à£deur,
though covered with dust, and drop‚à£ping
to pieces with the damps, and with
age.</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow cold these rooms are, ma'amselle!‚Äù
said Annette:‚Äúnobody has lived in them
for many, many years, they say. Do let
us go.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThey may open upon the great stair‚à£cafe,
perhaps,‚Äù said Emily, passing on till
she came to a chamber, hung with pictures,
and took the light to examine that of a
soldier on horseback in a field of battle.‚Äî
He was darting his spear upon a man, who
lay under the feet of the horse, and who
held up one hand in a supplicating attitude.
The soldier, whose beaver was up, regard‚à£ed
him with a look of vengeance, and
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
the countenance, with that expression,
struck Emily as resembling Montoni. She
shuddered, and turned from it. Passing
the light hastily over several other pictures,
she came to one concealed by a veil of
black silk. The singularity of die circum‚à£stance
struck her, and she stopped before
it, wishing to remove the veil, and examine
what could thus carefully be concealed, but
somewhat wanting courage. ‚ÄúHoly Vir‚à£gin!
what can this mean?‚Äùexclaimed
Annette. ‚ÄúThis is surely the picture they
told me of at Venice.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat picture? said Emily.‚Äù Why
a picture‚Äîa picture,‚Äúreplied Annette, he‚à£sitatingly
‚Äî‚Äúbut I never could make out
exactly what it was about, either.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúRemove the veil, Annette.‚Äù</P>
<P>What! I ma'amselle!‚ÄîI! not for the
world!‚ÄúEmily, turning round, saw An‚à£nette's
countenance grow pale.‚Äù And
pray, what have you heard of this picture,
to terrify you so, my good girl?‚Äùsaid she
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
‚ÄúNothing, ma'amselle: I have heard no‚à£thing,
only let us find our way out.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúCertainly: but I with first to examine
the picture; take the light, Annette, while
I lift the veil.‚Äù Annette took the light,
and immediately walked away with it, dif‚à£regarding
Emily's calls to stay, who, not
choosing to be left alone in the dark cham‚à£ber,
at length followed her. ‚ÄúWhat is the
reason of this, Annette?‚Äùsaid Emily, when
she overtook her, ‚Äúwhat have you heard
concerning that picture, which makes you
so unwilling to stay when I bid you?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI don't know what is the reason,
ma'amselle, replied Annette,‚Äùnor any
thing about the picture, only I have heard
there is something very dreadful belonging
to it‚Äîand that it has been covered up in
black ever since‚Äîand that nobody has looked
at it for a great many years‚Äîand it some‚à£how
has to do with the owner of this castle
before Signor Montoni came to the possef‚à£sion
of it‚Äîand‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, Annette,‚Äù said Emily, smiling,
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
‚ÄúI perceive it is as you say‚Äîthat you
know nothing about the picture.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo, nothing, indeed, ma'amselle, for
they made me promise never to tell;
but‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù rejoined Emily, who observed
that she was struggling between her inclina‚à£tion
to reveal a secret, and her apprehension
for the consequence,‚Äù I will enquire no
further‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo' pray, ma'am, do not.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúLeft you should tell all,‚Äù interrupted
Emily.</P>
<P>Annette blushed, and Emily smiled, and
they passed on to the extremity of this
suite of apartments, and found themselves,
after some farther perplexity, once more
at the top of the marble stair-case, where
Annette left Emily, while she went to call
one of the servants of the castle to shew
them to the chamber, for which they had
been seeking.</P>
<P>While she was absent, Emily's thoughts,
returned to the picture; an unwillingness
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
to tamper with the integrity of a servant,
had checked her enquiries on this subject,
as well as concerning some alarming hints,
which Annette had dropped respecting
Montoni; though her curiosity was entirely
awakened, and she had perceived, that her
questions might easily be answered. She
was now, however, inclined to go back to
the apartment and examine the picture;
but the loneliness of the hour and of the
place, with the melancholy silence that
reigned around her, conspired with a cer‚à£tain
degree of awe, excited by the mystery
attending this picture, to prevent her. She
determined, however, when day-light should
have re-animated her spirits, to go thither
and remove the veil. As she leaned from
the corridor, over the stair-case, and her
eyes wandered round, she again observed,
with wonder, the vast strength of the walls,
now somewhat decayed, and the pillars of
solid marble, that rose from the hall, and
supported the roof.</P>
<P>A servant now appeared with Annette,
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
and conducted. Emily to her chamber,
which was in a remote part of the castle,
and at the end of the very corridor, from
whence the suite of apartments open‚à£ed,
through which, they had been wan‚à£dering.
The lonely aspect of her room
made Emily unwilling that Annette should
leave her immediately, and the dampness
of it chilled her with more than fear. She
begged Caterina, the servant of the castle,
to bring some wood and light a fire.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAye, lady, it's many a year since a fire
was lighted here,‚Äù said Caterina.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou need not tell us that, good wo‚à£man,‚Äù
said Annette; ‚Äúevery room in the
castle feels, like a well. I wonder how you
contrive to live here; for my part, I wish
myself at Venice again.‚Äù Emily waved her
hand for Caterina to fetch the wood.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI wonder, ma'am, why they call this
the double chamber?‚Äùsaid Annette, while
Emily surveyed it in silence and saw that
it was losty and spacious, like the others
she had seen, and, like many of them, too,
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
had its walls lined with dark larch-wood.
The bed and other furniture was very an‚à£cient,
and had an air of gloomy grandeur,
like all that she had seen in the castle. one
of the high casements, which she opened,
overlooked a rampart, but the view beyond
was hid in darkness.</P>
<P>In the presence of Annette, Emily tried
to support her spirits, and to restrain the
tears, which, every now and then, came to
her eyes. She wished much to enquirer
when Count Morano was expected at the
castle, but an unwillingness to ask unne‚à£cessary
questions, and to mention family
concerns to a servant, withheld her. Mean‚à£while,
Annette's thoughts were engaged
upon another subject: she dearly loved the
marvellous, and had heard of a circum‚à£stance,
connected with the castle, that
highly gratified this, taste. Having been
enjoined not to mention it, her inclination
to tell it was so strong, that she was every
instant on the point of speaking what she
had heard. Such a strange circumstance,
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
too, and to be obliged to conceal It, was a
severe punishment; but she knew, that
Montoni might impose one much severer,
and she feared to incur it by offending
him.</P>
<P>Caterina now brought the wood, and its
bright blaze dispellod, for a while, the
gloom of the chamber. She told Annette,
that her lady had enquired for her, and
Emily was once again left to her own sad
reflections. Her heart was not yet hardened
against the stern manners of Montoni,
and she was nearly as much shocked now,
as she had been when she first witnessed
them. The tenderness and affection, to
which she had been accustomed, till she
lost her patents, had made her particularly
sensible to any degree of unkindness, and
such a reverse as this no apprehension had
prepared her to support.</P>
<P>To call off her attention from subjects,
that pressed heavily upon her spirits, she
rose and again examined her room and its
furniture. As she walked round it, she
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
passed a door, that was not quite shut, and,
perceiving, that it was not the one, through
which she entered, she brought the light
forward to discover whither it led. She
opened it, and, going forward, had nearly
fallen down a steep, narrow stair-case, that
wound from it, between two stone walls.
She wished to know to what it led, and was
the more anxious, since it communicated so
immediately with her apartment; but, in
the present state of her spiritns, she wanted
courage to venture into the darkness alone.
Closing the door, therefore, she endeavoured
to fasten it, but, upon further examination,
perceived, that it had no bolts on the cham‚à£ber
side, though it had two on the other.
By placing a heavy chair against it, she
in some measure remedied the defect; yet
she was still alarmed at the thought of
sleeping in this remote room alone, with
a door opening she knew not whither, and
which could not be perfectly fastened on the
inside. Sometimes she wished to entreat of
Madame Montoni, that Annette might have
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
leave to remain with her all night, but was
deterred by an apprehension of betraying
what would be thought childish fears, and
by an unwillingness to increase the apt ter‚à£rors
of Annette.</P>
<P>Her gloomy reflections were, soon after,
interrupted by a footstep in the corridor, and
she was glad to see Annette enter with some
supper, sent by Madame Montoni. Hav‚à£ing
a table near the fire, she made the good
girl sit down and sup with her; and, when
their little repast was over, Annette, encou‚à£raged
by her kindness and stirring the wood
into a blaze, drew her chair upon the hearth,
nearer to Emily, and said,-‚ÄúDid you ever
hear, ma'amselle of the strange accident,
that made the Signor lord of this castle?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat wonderful story have you now
to tell?‚Äù said Emily, concealing the curio‚à£sity,
occasioned by the mystrerious hints she
had formerly heard on that subject.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI have heard all about it, ma'amselle,‚Äù
said Annette, looking round the chamber
and drawing closer to Emily; ‚ÄúBenedetto
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
told it me as we travelled togetiier: says he,
Annette, you don't know about this castle
here, that we are going to? No, says I,
Mr. Benedetto, pray what do you know?
But, ma'amselle, you can keep a secret, or
I would not tell it you for the world; for
I promised never to tell, and they say,
that the Signor does not like to have it
talked of.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIf you promised to keep this seeret,‚Äù
said Emily, ‚Äúyou do right not to men‚à£tion
it.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette paused a moment, and then
said, ‚ÄúO, but to you, ma'amselle, to you
I may tell it safely, I know.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily smiled, ‚ÄúI certainly shall keep it
as faithfully as yourself, Annette.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette replied very gravely, that would
do, and proceeded‚Äî‚ÄúThis castle, you must
know, ma'amselle, is very old, and very
strong, and has stood out many sieges, as
they say. Now it was not Signor Montoni's
always, nor his father's; no; but, by some
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
law or other, it was to come to the Signor,
if the lady died unmarried.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat lady?‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI am not come to that yet,‚Äù replied
Annette, ‚Äúit is the lady I am going to
tell you about, ma'amselle; but, as I was
saying, this lady lived in the castle, and
had every thing very grand about her, as
you may suppose, ma'amselle. The Signor
used often to come to see her, and was in
love with her, and offered to marry her;
for, though he was somehow related, that did
not signify. But she was in love with some‚à£body
else, and would not have him, which
made him, very angry, as they say, and
you know, ma'amselle, what an ill-looking
gentleman he is, when he is angry. Perhaps
she saw him in a passion, and therefore
would not have him. But, as I was saying,
she was very melancholy and unhappy,
and all that, for a long while, and‚ÄîHoly
Virgin! what noise is that? did not you
hear a sound, ma'amselle?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt was only the wind,‚Äù said Emily,
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
‚Äúbut do come to the end of your
story.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAs I was saying‚ÄîO, where was I?‚Äî
as I was saying‚Äîshe was very melancholy
and unhappy a long while, and used to
walk about upon the terrace, there, under
the windows, by herself, and cry so! It
would have done your heart good to hear her.
That is‚ÄîI don't mean good, but it would
have made you cry too, as they tell me,‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, but, Annette, do tell me the
substance of your tale.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAll in good time, ma'am; all this I
heard before at Venice, but what is to
come I never heard till to-day. This hap‚à£pened
a great many years ago, when Signor
Montoni was quite a young man. The
lady-they called her Signora Laurentini,
was very handsome, but she used to be in
great passions, too, sometimes, as well as the
Signor. Finding he could not make her
listen to him‚Äîwhat, does he do, but leave
the castle, and never comes near it for a
long; time! but it was all one to her; she
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
was just as unhappy whe ther he was here
or not, till one evening, Holy St. Peter!
ma'amselle,‚Äúcried Annette,‚Äúlook at that
lamp, see how blue it burns!‚Äù she looked
fearfully round the chamber.‚ÄúRidicu‚à£lous
girl!‚Äù said Emily,‚Äúwhy will you
indulge those fancies? Pray let me hear the
end of your story, I am weary.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette still kept her eyes on the lamp,
and proceeded in a lower voice.‚ÄúIt
was one evening, they say, at the latter
end of the year, it might be about the
middle of september, I suppose, or the be‚à£ginning
of October: nay, for that matter,
it might be November, for that, too, is the
latter end of the year, but that I connot
say for certain, because they did not tell me
for certain themselves. However, it was at
the latter end of the year, this grand lady
walked out of the castle into the woods
below, as she had often done before, all
alone, only her maid was with her. the
wind blew cold, and strewed the leaves
about, and whistled dismally among those
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
great old chesnut trees, that we passed,
ma'amselle, as we came to the castle‚Äîfor
Benedetto shewed me the trees as he was
talking‚Äîthe wind blew cold, and her wo‚à£man
would have persuaded her to return:
but all would not do, for she was fond of
walking in the woods, at evening time,
and, if the leaves were falling about her, so
much the better.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, they saw her go down among
the woods, but night came, and she did not
return; ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve
o'clock came, and not lady! Well, the ser‚à£vants
thought to be sure, some accident had
befallen her, and they went out to seek
her. they searched all night long, but
could not find her, or any trace of her;
and, from that day to this, ma'amselle, she
has never been heard of.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIs this true, Annette?‚Äù said Emily, in
much surprise.</P>
<P>‚ÄúTrue, ma'am!‚Äù said Annette, with a
look of horror,‚Äúyes, it is true, indeed.
But they do say,‚Äù she added, lowering her
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
voice, ‚Äúthey do say, that the signora has
been seen, several times since, walking in
the woods and about the castle in the night:
several of the old servants, who remained
here some time after, deeclare they saw her;
and, since then, she has been seen by some
of the vassals, who have happened to be in
the castle, at night. Carlo, the old steward,
could tell such things, they say, if he
would.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow contradictory is this, Annette!‚Äù
said Emily,‚Äúyou say nothing has been
since known of her, and yet she has been
seen!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúBut all this was told me for a great se‚à£cret‚Äù rejoined Annette, without noticing
the remark,,‚Äúand I am sure, ma'am, you
would not hurt ei ther me or Benedetto, so
much as to go and tell it again‚Äù Emily
remained silent, and Annette repeated her
last sentence</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou have nothing to fear from my
indiscretion,‚Äù replied Emily,‚Äúand let me
advise you, my good Annette, be discreet
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
yourself, and never mention what you have
jsust told me to any o ther person. Signor
Montoni, as you say, may be angry if he
hears of it. But what enquiries were made
concerning the lady?</P>
<P>‚ÄúO! a great dea!, indeed, ma'amselle,
for the Signor laid claim to the castle di‚à£rectly,
as being the next heir, and they
said, that is the judges, or the senators, or
somebody of that sort, said, he could not
take possession of it till so many years were
gone by, and then, if, after all, the lady
could not be found, why she would be as
good as dead, and the castle would be his
own; and so it is his own. But the story
went round, and many strange reports were
spread, so very strange, ma'amselle, that
I shall not tell them.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThat is stranger still, Annette,‚Äù said
Emily, smiling, and rousing herself from
her reverie.‚ÄúBut, when Signora Lauren‚à£tini
was afterwards seen in the castle, did
nobody speak to her?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚Äúspeak‚Äîspeak to her!‚Äù cried An‚à£nette,
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
with a look of terror;‚Äúon, to be
sure.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAnd why not?‚Äù rejoined Emily, will‚à£ing
to hear further.</P>
<P>‚ÄúHoly Mo ther! speak to a spirit!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúBut what reason had they to conclude
it was a spirit, unless they had approached,
and spoken to it?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO ma'amselle, I cannot tell. How
can you ask such shocking questions? But
nobody ever saw it come in, or go out of
the castle; and it was in one place now,
and then the next minute in quite ano ther
part of the castle; and then it never spoke,
and, if it was alive, what should it do in
the castle if it never spoke? Several parts
of the castle have never been gone into since,
they say, for that very reason.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat, because it never spoke?‚Äù said
Emily, trying to lough away the fears, that
began to steal upon her‚Äî‚ÄúNo, ma'am‚à£selle, no;‚Äù replied Annette, ra ther angrily,
‚Äúbut because something has been seen
there they say, too, there is an old cha‚à£pel
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
adjoining the west side of the castle,
where, any time at midnight, you may hear
such groans!‚Äîit makes one shudder to
think of them!‚Äîand strange sights have
been seen there‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúPr'y thee, Annette, no more of these
silly tales,‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚Äúsilly tales, ma'amselle! O, but I will
tell you one story about this, if you pleas
that Caterina told me. It was one cold
winter's night that Caterina (she often came
to the castle then, she says, to keep old
Carlo and his wife company, and so he
recommended her afterwards to the Signor,
and she lived here ever since) Caterina
was sitting with them in the little hall, says
Carlo, 'I wish we had some of those figs
to roast, that lie in the store-closet, but it
is a long way off, and I am loth to fetch
them; do, Caterina, ' says he, 'for you are
young and nimble, do bring us some
the fire is in a nice trim for roasting them;
they lie, ' says he, ' in such a corner of the
store-room, at the end of the noth-gallery;
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
here, take the lamp, ' says he, ' and mind,
as you go up the great stair-cafÈ, that the
wind, through the roof, does not blow it
out.' So, with that, Caterina took the
lamp‚ÄîHush! ma'amselle, I surely heard
a noise!"</P>
<P>Emily, whom Annette had now infected
with her own terrors, liftened attentively;
but every thing was still, and Annette pro‚à£ceeded:</P>
<P>‚ÄúCaterina went to the north-gallery, that
is the wide gallery we passed, ma'am, before
we came to the corridor, here. As she
went with the lamp in her hand, thinking
of nothing at all‚Äîthere, again!‚Äù cried
Annertte, suddenly‚Äî‚ÄúI heard it again!‚Äî
it was not fancy, ma'amselle!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHush!‚Äù said Emily, trembling. they
listened, and, continuing to fit quite still,
Emily heard a low knocking against the
Wall. It came repeatedly. Annette then
screamed loudly, and the chamber door
slowly opened.‚ÄîIt was Caterina, come to
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
tell Annette, that her lady wanted her.
Emily, though she now perceived who it
was, could not immediately overcome her
terror; while Annette, half laughing, half
crying, scolded Caterina heartily for thus
alarming them; and was also terrified left
what she had told had been overheard.‚Äî
Emily, whose mind was deeply impressed
by the chief circumstance of Annette's rela‚à£tion,
was unwilling to be left alone, in the
present state of her spirits; but, to avoid
offending Madame Mantoni, and betray‚à£ing
her own weakness, she struggled to
overcome the illusions of fear, and dis‚à£missed
Annette for the night.</P>
<P>When she was alone, her thoughts re‚à£curred
to the strange history of Signora Lau‚à£rentini
and then to her own strange situa‚à£tion,
in the wild and solitary mountains of
a foreign country, in the castle, and the
power of a man, to whom, only a few pre‚à£ceding
months, she was an entire stranger;
who had already exercised an usurped au‚à£thority
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
over her, and whose character she
now regarded, with a degree of terror, appa‚à£rently
justified by the fears of o thers. she
knew, that he had invention equal to the
conception and talents to the execution
of any project, and she greatly feared he
had a heart too void of feeling to op‚à£pose
the perpetration of whatever his in‚à£terest
might suggest. she had long ob‚à£served
the unhappines s of Madame Mon‚à£toni,
and had often been witnes s to the
stern and contemptuous behaviour she re‚à£ceived
from her husband. To these cir‚à£cumstances,
which conspired to give her
just cause for alarm, were now added those
thousand nameless terrors, which exist only
in active imaginations, and which set reason
and examination equally at defiance.</P>
<P>Emily remembered all that Vlancourt
had told her, on the eve of her departure
from languedoc, respecting Montoni,
and all that he had said to dis suade her
from venturing on the journey. His fears
had often since appeared to her prophetic
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
now they seemed confirmed. Hyer heart,
as it gave her back the image of Valancourt,
mourned in vain regret, but reson soon
came with a consolation, which, though
feeble at sirst, acquired vigour from reflec‚à£tion.
she considered, that, whatever might
be her sufferings, she had withheld from in‚à£volving
him in misfortune, and that what‚à£ever
her future sorrows could be, she was, at
least, free from self-reproach.</P>
<P>Her melancholy was as sisted by the hol‚à£low
fighings of the wind along along the corridor
And round the castle. the cheerful blaze
of the wood had long been exitinguished,
and she fat with her eyes fixed on the dying
embers, till a loud gust, that swept through
the corridor, and shook the doors and case‚à£ments,
alarmed her, for its violence had
moved the chair she had placed as a sfasten
ing, and the door, leading to the private
stair-cafÈ, stood half open. Her curiosity
and her fears were again awakened. she
took the lamp to the top of the s steps, and
stood hesitating ehe ther to go down; but
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
again the profound stillness and the gloom
of the place awed her, and, determining to
enquire fur ther, when day-light might assist
the search, she closed the door, and placed
against it a stoanger guard.</P>
<P>She now retired to her bed, leaving the
lamp burning on the table; but its gloomy
light, instead of dispelling her fear, assisted
it; for, by its uncertain rays, she almost
fancied she saw shapes slit passt her curtains
and glide into the remote obscurity of her
chamber.‚Äîthe castle clock struck one be‚à£fore
she closed her eyes to sleep.</P>

<BIBL>JULIUS CAESAR.</BIBL></Q>
<P>DAYLIGHT dispelled from Emily's
midn the glooms of superstition, but not
those of apprehension. the Count Morano
was the first image, that occured to her
waking thoughts, and then came a train of
anticipated evils, which she could nei ther
ocnquer, or avoid. She rose, and to re‚à£lieve
her mind from the busy ideas, that tor‚à£mented
it, compelled herself to notice ex‚à£ternal
objects. From her casement she
looked out upon the wild grandeur of the
scene, closed nearly on all sids by alpine steeps, whose tops, peeping over each o ther,
faded from the eye in mifty hues, while the
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
promontories below were dark with woods,
that swept down to their base, and stretched
along the narrow vallies. the rich pomp
of these woods was particularly delightful
to Emily; and she viewed with astonish‚à£ment
the fortifications of the castle spread‚à£ing
along a vast extent of rock, and now
partly in decay, the grandeur of the ram
parts below, and the towers and battlements
and various features of the fabric above.
From these her sight wandered over
the cliffs and woods into the valley, along which
foamed a broad and rapid stream, seen fall‚à£ing
among the crags of an opposite moun
tain, now flashing in the sun-beams, and
now shadowed by over-arching pines,
till it was entirely concealed by their thick
foliage. Again it burst from beneath this
darkness in one broad sheet of foam, and
fell thundering into the vale. Nearer,
towards the west, opened the mountain‚à£vista,, which Emily had viewed with such
sublime emotion, on her approach to the
castle: a thin dusky vapour, that rose from
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
the valley, overspread its features with a
sweet obscurity. As this ascended and
caught the sun-beams, it kindled into a
crimson tint, and touched with exquisite
beauty the woods and cliffs, over which it
passed to the summit of the mountains;
then, as the veil drew up, it was delightful
to watch the gleaming objects, that pro‚à£gressively
disclosed themselves in the val
ley‚Äîthe green turf‚Äîdark woods‚Äîlittle
rocky recesses‚Äîa few peasants' huts‚Äîthe
foaming stream-a herd of cattle, and va‚à£rious
images of pastoral beauty. then, the
pine-forests brightened, and then the broad
breast of the mountains, till, at length, the
mist settled round their summit, touching
them with a ruddy glow. the feastures of
the vista now appeared distinctly, and the
broad deep shadows, that fell from the
lower cliffs, gave strong effect to the stream‚à£ing
splendour above; while the moun
tains, gradually sinking in the perspec‚à£tive,
appeared to shelve into the Adriatic
sea, for such Emily imagined to be the
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
gleam of blueish light, that terminated the
view.</P>
<P>Thus she endeavoured to amuse her fancy,
and was not unsuccessful. the breezy
freshness of the morning, too, revived her.
She raised her thoughts in prayer, which
she felt always most disposed to do, when
viewing the sublimity of nature, and her
mind recovered its strength.</P>
<P>When she turned from the casement,
her eyes glanced upon the door she had so
carefully guarded, on the preceding night,
and she now determined to examine whe‚à£ther
it led; but, on advancing to remove
the chairs, she perceived, that they were
already moved a little way. Her surprise
cannot easily be imagined, when, in the
next minute, she perceived that the door
was fastened.‚ÄîShe felt, as if she had seen
an apparition. the door of the corridor
was locked as she had left it, but this door,
which could be secured only on the
outside, must have been bolted, during the
night. She became seriously uneasy at the
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
thought of sleeping again in a chamber,
thus liable to intrusion, so remote, too, as it
was from the family, and she determined
to mention the circumstance to Madame
Montoni, and to request a change.</P>
<P>After some perplexity she found her way
into the great hall, and to the room, which
she had left, on the preceding night, where
breakfast was spread, and her aunt was
alone, for Montoni had been walking over
the environs of the castle, examining the
condition of its fortifications, and talking
for some time with Carlo. Emily observed,
that her aunt had been weeping, and her
heart softened towards her, with an affec‚à£tion,
taht shewed itself in her manner, ra ther
than in words, while she carefully avoided
the appearance of having noticed, that she
was unhappy. She seized the opportunity
of Montoni's absence to mention the cir‚à£cumstance
of the door, to request that she
might be allowed ano ther apartmetn, and
to enquire again, concerning the occasion
of their sudden journey. On the first sub‚à£ject
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
her aunt referred her to Montoni, po‚à£sitively refusing to interfere in the affair; on
the last, she professed utter ignorance.</P>
<P>Emily, then, with a wish of making her
aunt more reconciled to her situation, prised
the grandeur of the castle and the surround‚à£ing
scenery, and endeavoured to soften
every unpleasing circumstance attending it.
But, though misfortune had somewhat con‚à£quered
the asperities of Madme Montoni's
temper, and, by increasing her cares for
herself, had taught her to fell in some de‚à£gree
for o thers, the capricious love of
rule, which nature had planted and habit
had nourished in her heart, wa not sub‚à£dued.
She could not now deny herself the
grativication of tyrannizing over the innocent
and helpless Emily, by attempting to ridi‚à£cule
the taste she could not feel.</P>
<P>Her satirical discourse was, however, in‚à£terrupted
by the entrance of Montoni, and
her countenance immediately assumed a
mingled expression of fear and resentment,
while he seated himself at the breakfast‚à£table,
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
as if unconscious of there being any
person but himself in the room.</P>
<P>Emily, as she observed him in silence,
saw, that his countenance was darker and
sterner than usual.‚ÄúO could I know,‚Äù
said she to herself,‚Äúwhat passes in that
mind; could I know that thoughts, that are
known there, I should no longer be con‚à£demned
to this torturing suspense!‚Äù their
breakfast passed in silence, till Emily ven‚à£tured
to request, that ano ther apartment
might be allotted to her, and related the
circumstance which made her wish it.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI have no time to attend to these idle
whims,‚Äù said Montomi,‚Äúthat chamber was
prepared for you, and you must rest con‚à£tented
with it. It is not probable, that any
person would take the trouble of going to
that remote stair-case, for the purpose of
fastening a door, If it was not fastened,
when you entered the chamber, the wind,
perhaps, shook the door and made the bolts
slide. But I know not why I should under‚à£take
to acccount for so trifling an occurrence.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="219"/>
This explanation was by no means satis‚à£factory
to Emily, who had observed, that
the bolts were rusted, and consequently
could not be thsu easily moved; but she for‚à£bore
to say so, and repeated her request.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIf you will not relaese yourself from
the slavery of these fears,‚Äù said Montoni,
sternly,‚Äúat least forbear to torment o thers
by the mention of them. Conquer such
whims, and endeavour to streng then your
mind. No existence is more contemptible
than that, which is embittered by fear.‚Äù As
he said this, his eye glanced upon Ma‚à£dame
Montoni, who coloured highly, but
was still silent. Emily, wounded and dis‚à£appointed,
thought her fears were, in this
instance, too reasonable to deserve ridicule;
but, perceiving, that, however they might op‚à£press
her, she must endure them, she tried
to withraw her attention from the subject.
Carlo soon after entered with some fruit:
‚ÄúYour <HI>Excellenza</HI> is tired after your long
ramble,‚Äù said he, as he set the fruit upon
the table;‚Äúbut you have more to see after
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
breakfast. there is a place in the vaulted
passage leading to‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P>Montoni frowned upon him, and waved
his hand fro him to leave the room. Carlo
stopped, looked down, and then added, as
he advanced to the breadfast-table, and took
up the basket of fruit,‚ÄúI made bold, your
<HI>Excellenza,</HI> to bring some cherries, here, for
my honoured lady and my young mistress.
Will your ladyship taste them, madam?‚Äù
said Carlo, presenting the basket,‚Äúthey
are very fine ones, though I ga thered them
myself, and from an old tree, that catches
all the south sun; they are as big as plums
your ladyship.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúVery well, old Carlo,‚Äùsaid Madame
Montoni;‚ÄúI am obliged to you.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAnd the yound Signora, too, she may
like some of them,‚Äúrejoined Carlo, turnign
with the basket to Emily,‚Äúit will do me
good to see her eat some.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThank you, Carlo,‚Äù said Emily taking
some cherries, and smiling kindly.</P>
<P>‚ÄúCome, come,‚Äù said Montoni, impa‚à£tiently,
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
‚Äúenough of this. Leave the room,
but be in waiting. I shall want you pre‚à£sently.‚Äù</P>
<P>Carlos obeyed, and Montoni, soon after,
went out to examine fur ther into the state
of the castle; while Emily remained with
her aunt, patiently enduring her ill humour,
and endeavouring, with much sweetness, to
sooth her affliction, in stead of resenting its
effect.</P>
<P>When Madame Montoni retired to her
dressing-room, Emily endeavoured to amuse
herself by a view of the castle. Through a
folding door, vhe passed from the great hall
to the ramparts, which extended along the
brow of the precipice, round three sides
of the edifice; the fourth was guarded by
the high walls of the courts, and by the gate‚à£way,
through which she had passed, on the
preceding evening. the grandeur of the
broad ramparts, and the changing scenery
they opverlooked, excited her high admira‚à£tion;
for the extent of the terraces allowed
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
the features of the country to be seen in such
various points of view, that they appeared
to form new landscapes. She often paused
to examine the gothic magnificence of
Udolpho, its proud irregularity, its lofty
towersand battlements, its high-arched
casements, and its slender watch-towers,
perched upon the corners of turrest. then
she would lean on the wall of the terrace,
and, shuddering, measure with her eye the
precipice below, till the dark summits of the
woods arrested it. Wherever she turned,
appeared mountain-tops, forests of pine and
narrow glens, openign among the Apennines
and retiring from the fight into inaccessible
regions.</P>
<P>While she thus leaned, Montoni, follow‚à£ed
by two men, appeared, ascending a wind‚à£ing
path, cut in the rock below. He stop‚à£ped
upon a cliff, and, pointing to the ram‚à£parts,
turned to his followers, and talked
with much eagerness of gesticulation.‚Äî
Emily perceived, that one of these men was
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
Carlo; the o ther was in the dress of a pe‚à£sant,
and he alone seemed to be receiving
the directions of Montoni.</P>
<P>She withdrew from the walls, and pursued
her walk, till she heard at a distance the
sound of carriage wheels, and then the loud
bell of the portal, when it instantly occur‚à£ed
to her, that Count Morano was arrived.
As she hastily passed the folding doors from
the terrace, towards her own apartment,
several persons entered the hall by an op‚à£posite
door. She saw them at the extre‚à£mity
of the arcades, and immediately re‚à£treated;
but the agitation of her spirits, and
the extent and duskiness of the hall, had
prevented her from distinguishing the per‚à£sons
of the strangers. Her fears, however,.
had but one object, and they had called up
that object to her fancy;‚Äîshe believed that
she had seen Count Morano.</P>
<P>When she thought what they had passed
the hall, she ventured again to the door, and
proceeded, unobserved, to her room, where
she remained, agitated with apprehensions,
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
and listening to every distant sound At
length, hearing voices on the rampart,
she hastened to her window, and observed
Montoni, with Signor Cabigni, walking
below, conversing earnestly, and often stop‚à£pingand
turning towards each o ther, at
which times theri discourse seemed to be
uncommonly interesting.</P>
<P>Of the several persons who had appeared
in the hall, here wa Cavigni alone: but
Emily's alarm was soon after heightened by
the steps of some one in the corridor, who,
she apprehended, borught a message from
the Count. In the next moment, Annette
appeared.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAh! ma'amselle,‚Äù said she,‚Äúhere is the Signor Cavigni arrived! I am sure I
rejoiced to see a christian person in this
place; and then he is so good nature too,
he always takes so much notice of me!‚Äî
And here is also Signor Verezzi, and who
do you think besides, ma'amselle?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI cannot guess, Annette; tell me
quickly.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225"/>
‚ÄúNay, ma'am, do guess once.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, then,‚Äù said Emily, with assum‚à£ed
composure,‚Äúit is - Count Morano, I
suppose.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHoly Virgin!‚Äù cried Annette,‚Äúare
you ill, ma'amselle? you are going to faint!
let me get some water.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily sunk into a chair‚ÄúStay, An
nette,‚Äù said she feebly,‚Äúdo not leave me
‚ÄîI shall soon be betters open the case
ment.‚Äîthe Count, you say‚Äîhe is come
then?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWho, I!‚Äîthe Count! No, ma'amselle,
I did not say so.‚Äù‚ÄúHe is <HI>not</HI> come
then?‚Äù said Emily, eagerly.‚ÄúNo, ma'am‚à£selle.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚Äúyou are sure of it?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúLord bless me!‚Äù said Annette,‚Äúyou
recover very suddenly, ma'am! why, I
thought you was dying, just now.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúBut the Count‚Äîyou are sure, is not come?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO yes, quite sure of that, ma'amselle.
Why, I was looking out through the grate
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
in the north turret, when the carriages drove
into the court-yard, and I never expected
to see such a goodly sight in this dismal
old castle! but here are masters and servants,
too, enough to make the place ring again.
O! I was ready to leap through the rusty
old bars, for yoi!- O! who would ever
have thought of seeing a christian face in
this huge dreary house? I could have kissed
the very horses that brought them.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, Annette, well, I am better now.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, ma'amselle, I see you are. O! all
the servants will lead merry lives here, now;
we shall have singingand dancing in the
little hall, for the Signor cannot hear us
there‚Äîand droll stories‚ÄîLudovico's come,
ma'am; yes, there is Ludovico, come with
them! You remember Ludovico, ma'am‚à£a
tall, handsome, young man Signor
Cavigni's lacquey‚Äîwho always wears his
cloak with such a grace, thrown round his
left arm, and his hat set on so smartly, all
on one side, and‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227"/>
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Emily, who was wearied by
her loquacity.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat, ma'amselle! don't you remem‚à£ber
Ludovico‚Äîwho rowed the Cavaliero's
gondola, at the last regatta, and won the
prizeand who used to sing such sweet
verses about Orlandosand about the black
a moors, too; and charly‚Äîcharly‚Äîmagne,
yes, that was the name, all under my lat‚à£tice,
in the west portico, on the moon‚à£light
nights at Venice? O! I have listened
to him!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI fear, to they peril, my good Annettes,‚Äù
said Emily;‚Äúfor it seems his verses have
stolen thy heart. But let me advise you;
if it is so, keep the secret; never let him
know it.‚Äù
‚ÄúAh‚Äîma'amselle!‚Äîhow can one keep
such a secret as that?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell Anneette, I am now so much
better, that you may leave me.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO, but, ma'amselle, I forgot to ask‚Äî
how did you sleep in this dreary old chamber
last night?‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúAs well as usual.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúDid
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
you hear no noises?‚Äú‚Äî‚Äù None.‚Äú‚Äî‚ÄùNor
see any thing?‚Äú‚Äî‚Äù Nothing.‚Äú‚Äî‚Äù well, that
is surprising!‚Äú‚Äî‚Äù Not in the least: and
now tell me, why you ask these questions.‚Äù
‚ÄúOn, ma'amselle! I would not tell you
to the world, nor all I have heard about
this chamber, ei ther; it would frighten
you so‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIf that is all, you have frightened me
already, and may therefore tell me what
you know, without hurting your con‚à£sscience‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO Lord! they say the room is haunted,
and has been so these many years.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is by a ghost, then, who can draw
bolts,‚Äù said Emily, endeavouring to laugh
away her apprrehensions; ‚Äúfor I left that
door open, last night, and found it fastenned
this mornig.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette turned pale, and said not a
word.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDo you know whe ther any of the ser‚à£vants
fastened this door in the morning,
before I rose?'</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="229"/>
‚ÄúNo, ma'am that I will be bound they
did not: but I don't know: shall I go and
ask, ma'amselle?‚Äù said Annette, moving
hastily towards the corridor.</P>
<P>‚ÄúStay, Annette, I have o ther questions
to ask; tell me what you have heard con‚à£cerning
this room and whi ther that stair
case leads.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI will go and ask it all directly, ma'am;
besides, I am sure my lady wants me. I
cannot stay now, indeed, ma'am.‚Äù</P>
<P>She hrried from the room; with‚à£out
waiting Emily's reply, whose heart,
lightened by the certainty, that Morano
was not arrived, allowed her to smile at
the superstitious terror, which had seiz
ed on Annette; for, though she sone‚à£times
felt its influence herself, she could
smile at it, when apparent in o ther per‚à£sons.</P>
<P>Montoni having refused Emily ano ther
chamber, she determiened tobear with pa‚à£tience
the evil she could not remove, and,
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
in order to make the room as comfortable as
possible, unpacked her books, her sweet de‚à£light
in happier days, and her soothing re‚à£source
in the hours of moderate srrow: but
there were hours when even these failed of
their effect; when the genius, the taste, the
enthusiasm of the sublimest writers were
felt no longer.</P>
<P>Her little library being arranged on a
high chest, part of the furniture of the room,
she took out her drawing utensils, and was
tranquil enough to be pleased with the
thought of sketching the sublime scenes,
beheld from her windows; but she suddenly
checked this pleasure, remembering how
often she had soo thed herself by the in‚à£stention
of obtaining amusement of this
kind, and had been prevented by some new
circumstance of misfortune.</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow can I suffer myself to be deluded
by hope,‚Äù said she,‚Äúand, because Count
Morano is not yet arrived, feel a momen‚à£tary
happiness? Alas! what is it to me,
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
whether he is here to-day, or to-morrow,
if he cornes at all?‚Äîand that he will come
‚Äîit were weakness to doubt.‚Äù</P>
<P>To withdraw her thoughts, however,
from the subject of her misfortunes, she
attempted to read, but her attention wan‚à£dered
from the page, and, at length, she
threw aside the book, and determined to
explore the adjoining chambers of the castle.
Her imagination was pleased with the view
of ancient grandeur, and an emotion of
melancholy awe awakened all its powers,
as she walked through rooms, obscure and
desolate, where no footsteps had pas sed pro‚à£bably
for may years, and remembered the
strange history of the former possessor of
the edifice. this brought to her recollec‚à£tion
the veiled picture, which had attracted
her curiosity, on the preceding night, and
she resolved to examine it. As she passed
through the chambers, that led to this, she
found herself somewhat agitated; its con‚à£nection
with the late lady of the castle, and
the conversation of Annette, toge ther with
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
the circumstance of the veil, throwing a
mystery over the subject, that excited a faint
degree of terror. But a terror of this na‚à£ture,
as it occupies and expands the mind,
and elevates it to high expectation, is purely
sublime, and leads us, by a kind of fasci‚à£nation,
to seek even the object, from which
we appear to shrink.</P>
<P>Emily passed on with faltering steps,
and having paused a moment at the door,
before she attempted to open it, she then
hastily entered the chamber, and went to‚à£wards
the picture, which appeared to be
enclosed in a frame of uncommon size, that
hung in a dark part of the room. She
paused again, and then, with a timid hand,
lifted the veil; but instantly let it fall‚Äî
perceiving that what it had concealed was
no picture, and, before she could leave the
chamber, she dropped senseles on the
floor.</P>
<P>when she recovered her recollection, the
remembrance of what she had seen had
nearly deprived her of it a second time.
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
She had searcely strength to remove from
the room, and regain her own; and, when
arrived there, wanted courage to remain
alone. Horror occupied her mind, and
excluded, for a time, all sense of past, and
dread of future misfortune: she seated
herself near the casement, because from
thence she heard voice, though distant, on
the terrace, and might see people pass, and
these, trisling as they were, were reviving
circumstances. When her spirits had re‚à£covered
their tone, she considered, whe ther
she should mention what she had seen to
Madame montoni, and various and im‚à£portant
motives urged her to do so, among
which the least was the hope of the relief,
which an overburdened mind finds in speak‚à£ing
of the subject of its interest. But she
was aware of the terrible consequences, which
such a communication might lead to; and,
dreading the indiscreation of her aunt, at
length, endeavoured to arm herself with
resolution to observe a profound silence, on
the subject. Montoni and Verezzi soon
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
after passed under the casement, speaking
cheerfully, and their voices revived her.
Presently the signors Bertolini and Ca‚à£vigni
joined the party on the terrace, and
emily, supposing that Madame Montoni
was then alone, went to seek her; for the
solitude of her chamber, and its proximity
to that where she had received so severe a
shock, again affected her spirits.</P>
<P>She found her aunt in her dressing‚à£room,
preparing for dinner. Emily's pale
and affrighted countenance alarmed even
Madame Montoni; but she had sufficient
strength of mind to be silent on the subject,
that still made her shudder, and which was
ready to burst from her lips. In her aunt's
apartment she remained, till they both de‚à£scended
to dinner. there she met the gen‚à£tlemen
lately arrived, who had a kind of
busy seriousness in their looks, which was
somewhat unusual with them, while their
thoughts seemed too much occupied by
some deep interest, to suffer them to be‚à£stow
much attention ei ther on Emily, or
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
Madame Montoni. they spoke little, and
Montoni less. Emily, as she now looked
on him, shuddered. the horror of the
chamber rushed on her mind. several
times the colour faded from her cheeks,
and she feared, that illness would betray
her emotions, and compel her to leave the
room; but the strength of her ressolution
remedied the weakness of her frame; she
obliged herself to converse, and even tried
to look cheerful.</P>
<P>Montoni evidently laboured under some
vexation, such as would probably have agi‚à£tated
a weaker mind, or a more susceptible
heart, but which appeared, from the stern‚à£ness of his countenance, only to bend up
his faculties to energy and fortitude.</P>
<P>It was a comfortless and silent meal. the
gloom of the castle seemed to have spread
its contagion even over the gay countenance
of Cavigni, and with this gloom was min‚à£gled
a fierceness, such as she had seldom
seen him indicate. Count MJorano was not
named, and what conversation there was,
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
turned chiefly upon the wars, which at that
time agitated the Italian states, the strength
of the Venetian armies, and the Characters
of their generals.</P>
<P>After dinner, when the servants had with‚à£drawn,
emily learned, that the cavalier,
who had drawn upon himself the vengeance
of Orvino, had since died of his wounds,
and that strict search was still making for his
murderer. the intelligence seemed to dis‚à£turb
Montoni, who mused, and then en‚à£quired,
where Orsino had concealed him‚à£self.
His guests, who all, except Ca‚à£vigni,
were ignorant, that Montoni had
himself assisted him to escape from Venice,
replied, that he had fled in the night with
such precipitation and secrecy, that his
most intimate companions knew not whe‚à£ther.
Montoni blamed himself for having
asked the question, for a second thought
convinced him, that a man of Orsino's sus‚à£picious
temper was not likely to trust any of the
persons present with the knowledge of
his asylum. He considered himselt, however,
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
as entitled to his utmost confidence, and
did not doubt, that he should soon hear of
him.</P>
<P>Emily retired with Madame Montoni,
soon after the cloth was withdrawn, and
left the cavaliers to their secret councils,
but not before the significant frowns of
Montoni had warned his wife to depart,
who passed from the hall to the ramparts,
and walked, for some time, in silence, which
Emily did not interrupt, for her mind was
also occupied by interests of its own. It
required all her resolution, to forbear com‚à£municating
to Madame Montoni the ter‚à£rible
subject, which still thrilled her every
nerve with horror; and sometimes she was
on the point of doing so, merely to obtain
the relief of a moment; but she knew how
wholly she was in the power of Montoni,
and, considering, that the indiscretion of
her aunt might prove fatal to them both,
she compelled herself to endure a present
and an inferior evil, ra ther than to tempt a
future and a heavier one. A strange kind
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
of presentiment frequently, on this day
occurred to her;‚Äîit seemed as if her fate
rested here, and was by some invisble means
connected with this castle.</P>
<P>‚ÄúLet me not accelerate it,‚Äù said she to
herself:‚Äúfor whatever I may be reserved, let me, at least,
avoid self-reproach.‚Äù</P>
<P>As she looked on the massy walls of the
edifice, her melancholy spirits represented it
to be her prison and she started as at a
new suggestion, when she considered how
far distant she was from her native country,
from her little peaceful home, and from her
only friend‚Äîhow remote was her hope of
happiness, how feeble the expectation of
again seeing him! Yet the idea of Valan‚à£court,
and her confidence in his faithful love,
had hi therto been her only solace, and she
struggled hard to retain them. A few
tears of agony started to her eyes, which she
turned aside to conceal.</P>
<P>While she afterwards leaned on the wall
of the rampart, some peasants, at a little dis‚à£tance,
were seen examining a breach, before
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
which lay a heap of strones, as if to repair it,
and a rusty old cannon, that appeared to
have fallen from its station above. Madame
Montoni stopped to speak to the men,
and enquired what they were going to
do.‚ÄúTo repair the fortifications, your
ladyship,‚Äù said one of them; a labour
which she was somewhat surprised, that
Montoni should think neccessary, particu‚à£larly
since he had never spoken of the Castle,
as of a place, at which he meant to reside for
any considerable time; but she passed on
towards a lofty arch, that led from the south
to the east rampart, and which adjoined
the castle, on one side, while, on the o ther,
it supported a small watch-tower, that en‚à£tirely
commanded the deep valley below.
As she approached this arch, she saw, be‚à£yond
it, winding along the woody descent
of a distant mountain, a long troop of
horse and foot, whom she knew to be sol‚à£diers,
only by the glitter of their pikes and
o ther arms, for the distance did not allow
her to discover the colour of their liveries.
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
As she gazed, the vanguard issued from the
woods into the valley, but the train still
continued to pour over the remote summit
of the mountain, in endless succession;
while, in the front, the military uniform
became distinguishable, and the command‚à£ers,
riding first, and seeming, by their ges‚à£tures,
to direct the march of those that fol‚à£lowed,
at length, approached very near to
the castle.</P>
<P>such a spectacle, in these solitary regions,
both surprised and alarmed madame Mon‚à£toni,
and she hastened towards some pea‚à£sfants,
who were employed in raising bastions
before the south rampart, where the rock
was leses abrupt than elsewhere. these men
could give no satisfactory answers to her
enquiries, but, being roused by them, gazed
in stupid astonishment upon the long caval‚à£cade.
Madame Montoni, then thinking
it necessary to communicate far ther the
subject of her alarm, sent Emily to say,
that she wished to speak to Montoni; an
errand her niece die not approve, for she
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
dreaded his frowns, which she knew this
message would provoke; but she obeyed in
silence.</P>
<P>As she drew near the apartment, in which
he sat with his guests, she heard them in
earnest and loud dispute, and she paused a
moment, trembling at the displeasure, which
her sudden interruption would occasion. In
the next, their voices sunk all toge ther; she
then ventured to open the door, and, while
Montoni turned hastily and looked at her,
without speaking, she delivered her mes‚à£sage.</P>
<P>‚ÄúTell Madam Montoni I am engaged,‚Äù
said he</P>
<P>Emily then throught
it proper to men‚à£tion
the subject of her alarm. Montoni
and his companions rose instantly and went
to the windows, but, these not affording them
a view of the troops, they at length pro‚à£ceeded
to the ramparts, where Cavigni con‚à£jectured
it to be a legion of <HI>Condottieri,</HI> on
their march towards Modena.</P>
<P>One part of the cavalcade now extended
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
along the valley, and ano ther wound among
the mountains towards the north, while
some troops still lingered on the woody
precipices, where the first had appeared,
so that the great length of the procession
seemed to include an whole army. While
Montoni and his family watched its pro‚à£gress, they heard the found of trumpets and
the clash of cymbals in the vale, and then
o thers, answering from the heights. Emily
listened with emotion to the shrill blast,
that woke the echoes of the mountains, and
Montoni explained the signals, with which
he appeared to be well acquainted, and
which meant nothing hostile. the uni‚à£forms
of the troops, and the kind of arms
they bore, confirmed to him the conjecture
of Cavigni, and he had the satisfaction to
see them pass by, wihtout even stopping
to gaze upon his castle. He did not, how‚à£ever,
leave the rampart, till the bases of the
mountains had shut them from his view,
and the last murmur of the trumpet floated
away on the wind. Cavigni and Verezzi
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
were inspirited by this spectacle, which
seemed to have roused all the fire of their
temper; Montoni turned into the castle in
thoughtful silence.</P>
<P>Emily's mind had not yet sufficiently
recovered from its late shock, to endure the
loneliness of her chamber, and she re‚à£mained
upon the ramparts; for Madame
Montoni had not invited her to her dressing‚à£room,
whi ther she had gone evidently in
low spirits, and Emily, from her late expe‚à£rience,
had lost all wish to explore the
gloomy and mysterious recesses of the
castle. The ramparts, therefore, were al‚à£most her only retreat, and here she lingered,
till the gray laaze of evening was again
spread over the scene.</P>
<P>The cavaliers supped by themselves, and
Madame Montoni remained in her apart‚à£ment,
whether Emily went, before she re‚à£tired
to her own. She found her aunt
weeping, and in much agitation. the ten‚à£derness of Emily was naturally so soothing,
that it seldom failed to give comfort to the
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
drooping heart: but Madame Montoni's
was torn, and the softest accents of Emily's
voice were lost upon it. With her usual
delicacy, she did not appear to observe her
aunt's distress, but it gave an involuntary
gentleness to her manners, and an air of fo‚à£licitude
to her countenance, which ma‚à£dame
Montoni was vexed to perceive, who
seemed to feel the pity of her niece to be an
insult to her pride, and dismissed her as
soon as she properly could. Emily did not
venture to mention again the reluctance
she felt to her gloomy chamber, but she
requeted that Annette might be permitted
to remain with her till she retired to rest;
and the request was somewhat reluctantly
granted. Annette, however, was now with
the servats, and Emily withdrew alone.</P>
<P>With light and hasty steps she feeble
glimmer of the lamp she carried only shew‚à£ed
the gloom around her, and the passing
air threatened to extinguish it. the lonely
silence, that reigned in this part of the castle,
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
awed her; now and then, indeed, she heard
a faint peal of laughter rise from a remote
part of the edifice, where the servants were
assembled, but it was soon lost, and a skind
of breathless stillness remained. As she
passed the suite of rooms which she had vi‚à£sited
in the morning, her eyes glanced fear‚à£fully
on the door, and she almost fancied she1
heard murmuring sounds within, but she
paused not a moment to enquire.</P>
<P>Having reached her own apartment,
where no blazing wood on the hearth dissi‚à£pated
the gloom, she sat down with a book,
to enliven her atention, till Annette should
come, and a fire could be kindled. she
continued to read till her light was nearly
expired, but Annette did not appear, and
the solitude and obscurity of her chamber
again affected her spirits, the more, beacuse
of its nearness to the scene of horror, that
she had witnessed in the morning. Gloomy
and fantastic images came to her mind.
She looked fearfully towards the door of
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
the stair- case, and then, examining whe ther
it was still fastened, found that it was so.
Unable to conquer the uneasiness she felt
at the prospect of sleeping again in this
remote and insecure apartment, which some
person seemed to have entered during the pre‚à£ceding
night her impatience to see Annette,
whom she had bidden to enquire concerning
this circumstance, became extremely painful.
She wished also to question her, as to the
object, which had excited so much horror
in her own mind, and which Annette on
the preceding evening had appeared to be
in part acquainted with, though her words
were very remote from the truth, and it
appeared plainly to Emily, that the girl
had been purposely misled by a false re‚à£port:
above all she was surprised, that the
door of the chamber, which contained it,
should be left unguarded. Such an in‚à£stance
of negligence almost surpassed be‚à£lief.
But her light was now expiring; the
faint flashes it threw upon the walls called
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
up all the terrors of fancy, and she rose to
find her way to the habitable part of the
castle, before it was quite extinguished.</P>
<P>As she opened the chamber door, she
heard remote voices, and, socn after, saw a
light issue upon the fur ther end of the
corridor, which Annette and ano ther ser‚à£vant
approached.‚ÄúI am glad you are
come,‚Äù said Emily:‚Äúwhat has detained
you so long? Pray light me a fire imme‚à£diately.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúMy lady wanted me, ma'amselle,‚Äù re‚à£plied
Annette in some confusion;‚ÄúI will
go and get the wood.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Caterina,‚Äúthat is my
business,‚Äù and left the room instantly,
while Annette would have followed; but,
being called back, she began to talk very
loud, and laugh, and seemed afraid to trust
a pause of silence.</P>
<P>Caterina soon returned with the wood,
and then, when the cheerful blaze once
more animated the room, and this servant
had withdrawn, Emily asked Annette, whe‚à£ther
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
she had made the enquiry she bade
her.‚ÄúYes, ma'amselle,‚Äúsaid Annette,
‚Äù but not a soul knows any thing about
the matter: and old Carlo,‚ÄîI watched him
well, for they say he knows strange things‚Äî
old Carlo looked so as I don't know how
to tell, and he asked me again and again,
if I was sure the door was ever unfasten‚à£ted.
Lord, says I‚Äîam I sure I am alive?
And as for me, ma'am, I am all astounded,
as one may say, and would no more sleep
in this chamber, than I would on the great
cannon at the end of the east rampart.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd what objection have you to that
cannon, more than to any of the rest?‚Äù
said Emily smiling:‚Äúthe best would be
ra ther a hard bed.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, ma'amselle, any of them would
be hard enough for that matter; but they
do say, that something has been seen in the
dead of night, standing beside the great
cannon, as if to guard it.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell! my good Annette, the people
who tell such stories, are happy in having
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
you for an auditor, for I perceive you be‚à£lieve
them all.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúDear ma'amselle! I will shew you the
very cannon; You can see it from these
windows!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Emily,‚Äúbut that does
not prove, that an apparition guards it.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat! not if I shew you the very
cannon! Dear ma'am, you will believe
nothing.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNothing probably upon this subject,
But what I see,‚Äù said Emily.‚Äî‚ÄúWell,
ma'am, but you shall see it, if you will on‚à£ly
step this way to the casement.‚Äù‚ÄîEmily
could not forbear laughing, and Annette
looked surprised. Perceiving her extreme
aptitude to credit the marvellous, Emily
forbore to mention the subject she had in‚à£tended,
lest it should overcome her with
ideal terrrors, and she began to speak on a
lively topic‚Äîthe regattas of Venice.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAye, ma'amselle, those rowing matches,‚Äù
said Annette,‚Äúand the fine moon-light
nights, are all, that are worth seeing in Ve‚à£nice.
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
To be sure that moon is brighter
than any I ever saw, and then to hear such
sweet music, too, as Ludovico has often
and often sung under the lattice by the
west portico! Ma'amselle, it was Ludovico,
that told me about that picture, which you
wanted so to look at last night, and‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat picture?‚Äù said Emily, wishing
Annette to explain herseslf.</P>
<P>‚ÄúO! that terrible picture with the black
veil over it.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou never saw it, then?‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWho, I!‚ÄîNo, ma'amselle, I never did,
But this morning,‚Äù continued Annette, low‚à£ering
her voice, and looking round the
room,‚Äúthis morning, as it was broad day‚à£light,
do you know, ma'am, I took a
strange fancy to see it, as I had heard such
odd hints about it, and I got as far as the
door, and should have opened it, if it had
not been locked!‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, endeavouring to conceal the
emotion this circumstance occationed, en‚à£quired
at what hour she went to the cham‚à£ber,
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
and found, that it was soon after her‚à£sself
had been there. She also asked fur‚à£ther
questions, and the answers convinced
her, that Annette, and probably her in‚à£former,
were ignorant of the terrible
truth, though in Annette's account some‚à£thing
very like the truth, now and then,
mingled with the falsehood. Emily now
began to fear, that her visit to the chamber
had been observed, since the door had
been closed, so immediately after her de‚à£parture;
and dreaded lest this should draw
upon her the vengeance of Montoni. Her
anxiety, also, was excited to know whence
and for what purpose, the delusive report,
which had been imposed upon Annette,
had originated, since Montoni could only
have wished for silence and secrecy; but
she felt, that the subject was too terrible
for this lonely hour, and she compelled
herself to leave it, to converse with Annette,
whose chat, simple as it was, she prefer‚à£red
to the stillness of total solitude.</P>
<P>Thus they sat, till near midnight, but
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
not without many hints from Annette, that
she wished to go. The embers were now nearly
burnt out; and Emily heard, at a distance,
the thundering sound of the hall doors, as
they were shut for the night. She, therefore,
prepared for rest, but was still unwilling
that Annette should leave her. At this in‚à£stant,
the great bell of the portal sounded.
They listened in fearful expectation, when,
after a long pause of silence, it sounded
again. Soon after, they heard the noise of
carriage wheels in the court-yard. Emily
sunk almost lifeless in her chair; ‚ÄúIt is the
Count,‚Äù said she.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat, at this time of night, ma'am!‚Äù
said Annette; ‚Äúno, my dear lady. But, for
that matter, it is a strange time of night for
any body to come!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNay, pr'ythee, good Annette, stay not
talking,‚Äù said Emily in a voice of agnoy‚Äî
‚ÄúGo, pr'ythee, go, and see who it is.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette left the room, and carried with her the light, leaving Emily in darkness,
which a few moments before would have
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
terrified her in this room, but was now
scarcely observed by her. She listened and
waited, in breathless expectation, and heard
distant noises, but Annette did not return.
Her patience, at length, exhausted, she tried
to find her way to the corridor, but it was
long before she could touch the door of the
chamber, and, when she had opened it, the
total darkness without made her fear to pro‚à£ceed.
Voices were now heard, and Emily
even thought she distinguished those of
Count Morano, and Montoni. Soon after,
she heard steps approaching, and then a ray
of light streamed through the darkness, and
Annette appeared, whom Emily went to
meet.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, ma'amselle,‚Äù said she,‚Äúyou was
right, it is the Count sure enough.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is he!‚Äù exclaimed Emily, lifting her
eyes towards heaven and supporting herself
by Annette's arm.</P>
<P>‚ÄúGood Lord! My dear lady, don't be in
such a sluster, and look so pale, we shall
soon hear more.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="254"/>
‚ÄúWe shall, indeed!‚Äù said Emily, moving
as fast as she was able towards her apart‚à£ment.
‚ÄúI am not well; give me air.‚Äù
Annette opened a casement,and brought
water. The faintness soon left Emily, but
she desired Annette would not go till she
heard from Montoni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDear ma'amselle! he surely will not
disturb you at this time of night; why he
must think you are asleep.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúStay with me till I am so, then,‚Äù said
Emily, who felt temporary relief from this
suggestion, which appeared probable enough,
though her fears had prevented its occurring
to her. Annette, with secret reluctance,
consented to stay, and Emily was now com‚à£posed
enough to ask her some questions;
among others, whether sshe had seen the
Count.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, ma'am, I saw him alight, for I
went from hence to the grate in the north
turret, that overlooks the inner court-yard,
you know. There I saw the Count's car‚à£rige,
and the Count in it, waiting at the
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
great door,‚Äîfor the porter was just gone to
bed‚Äîwith several men on horseback all by
the light of the torches they carried.‚Äù‚Äî
Emily was compelled to smile. ‚ÄúWhen the
door was opened, the Count said something,
that I could not make out, and then got out,
and another gentleman with him. I thought,
to be sure, the Signor was gone to bed, and
I hastened away to my lady's dressing-room,
to see what I could hear. But in the way
I met Ludovico, and he told me that the
Signor was up, counselling with his master
and the other Signors, in the room at the
end of the north gallery; and Ludovico
held up his finger, and laid it on his lips, as
much as to say‚ÄîThere is more going on,
than you think of, Annette, but you must
hold your tongue. And so I did hold my
tongue, ma'amselle, and came away to tell
you directly.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily enquired who the cavalier was,
that accompanied the Count, and how
Montoni received them;but Annette could
not inform her.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="256"/>
‚ÄúLudovice,‚Äù she added,‚Äù had just been
to call Signor Montoni's valet, that he might
tell him they were arrived, when I met him.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily sat musing, for some time, and then
her anxiety was so much increased, that she
desired Annette would go to the sevants'
hall, where it was possible she might hear
something of the Count's intention, respect‚à£ing
his stay at the castle.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, ma'am,‚Äù said Annette with readi‚à£ness;
‚Äúbut how am I to find the way, if I
leave the lamp with you?‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily said she would light her, and they
immediately quitted the chamber. When
they had reached the top of the great stair‚à£case,
Emily recollected, that she might be
seen by the Count, and, to avoid the great
hall, Annette conducted her through some
private passages to a back stair-case, which
led directly to that of the servants.</P>
<P>As she returned towards her chamber,
Emily began to fear, that she might again
lose herself in the intricacies of the castle,
and again be shocked by some mysterious
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
spectacle; and, though she was already per‚à£plexed
by the numerous turnings, she feared
to open one of the many doors, that offered.
While she stepped thoughtfully along, she
fancied, that she heard a low moaning at no
great distance, and, having paused a mo‚à£ment,
she heard it again and distinctly. Se‚à£veral
doors appeared on the right hand of
the passage. She advanced, and listened.
When she came to the second, she heard a
voice, apparently in complaint, within, to
which she continued to listen, afraid to open
the door, and unwilling to leave it. Con‚à£vulsive
sobs followed, and then the piercing
accents of an agonizing spirit burst forth.
Emily stood appalled, and looked through
the gloom, that surrounded her, in fearful
expectation. The lamentations continued.
Pity now began to subdue terror; it was
possible she might administer comfort to
the sufferer, at least, by expressing sympathy,
and she laid her hand on the door. While
she hesitated she thougth she knew this voice,
disguised as it was by tones of grief. Having,
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
therefore, set down the lamp in the passage,
she gently opened the door, within which all
was dark, except that form an inner apart‚à£ment
a partial light appeared; and she step‚à£ped
softly on. Before she reached it, the
appearance of Madame Montoni, leaning on
her dressing-table, weeping, and with a
handkerchief held to her eyes, struck her,
and she paused.</P>
<P>Some person was seated in a chair by the
fire, but who it was she could not distinguish.
He spoke, now and then, in a low voice,
that did not allow Emily to hear what was
uttered, but she thought, that Madame
Montoni, at those times, wept the more,
who was too much occupied by her own
distress, to observe Emily, while the latter,
though anxious to know what occasioned
this, and who was the person admitted at so
late an hour to her aunt's dressing-room,
forbore to add to her sufferings by surprising
her, or to take advantage of her situation,
by listening to a private discourse. She,
therefore, stepped softly back, and, after
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
some further difficulty, found the way to
her own chamber, where nearer interests, at
length, excluded the surprise and concern
she had felt, respecting Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>Annette, however, returned without satis‚à£factory
intelligence, for the servants, among
whom she had been, were either entirely ig‚à£norant,
or affected to be so, concerning the
Count's intended stay at the castle. They
could talk only of the steep and broken road
they had just passed, and of the numerous
dangers they had escaped, and express won‚à£der
how their lord could choose to encoun‚à£ter
all these, in the darkness of night; for
they scarcely allowed, that the torches had
served for any other purpose but that of
shewing the dreariness of the mountains.
Annette, finding she could gain no infor‚à£mation,
lest them, making noisy petitions,
for more wood on the fire and more supper
on the table.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAnd now, ma'amselle,‚Äù added she,‚Äù I
am so sleepy!‚ÄîI am sure, if you was so
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
sleepy, you would not desire me to sit up
with you.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, indeed, began to think it was
cruel to wish it; she had also waited so
long, without receiving a summons from
Montoni, that it appeared he did not mean
to disturb her, at this late hour, and she de‚à£termined
to dismiss Annette. But, when she
again looked round her gloomy chamber,
and recollected certain circumstances, fear
feized her spirits, and she hesitated.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAnd yet it were cruel of me to ask you
to stay, till I am asleep, Annette,‚Äù said she,
‚Äúfor I fear it will be very long before I for‚à£get
myself in sleep.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI dare say it will be very long, ma'am‚à£selle,‚Äù
said Annette.</P>
<P>‚ÄúBut, before you go,‚Äù rejoined Emily,
‚Äúlet me ask you‚ÄîHad Signor Montoni
left Count Morano, when you quitted the
hall?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO no, ma'am, they were alone to‚à£gether.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="261"/>
‚ÄúHave you been in my aunt's dressing‚à£room,
since you left me?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo, ma'amselle, I called at the door as
I passed, but it was fastened; so I thought
my lady was gone to bed.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWho, then, was with your lady just
now?‚Äù said Emily,forgetting, in surprise,
her usual prudence.</P>
<P>‚ÄúNobody, I believe, ma'am,‚Äù replied An‚à£nette,
‚Äúnobody had been with her, I be‚à£lieve,
since I left you.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily took no further notice of the sub‚à£ject,
and, after some struggle with imaginary
fears, her good nature prevailed over them
so far, that she dismissed Annette for the
night. She then sat, musing upon her own
circumstances and those of Madame Mon‚à£toni,
till her eye rested on the miniature
picture, which she had found, after her fa‚à£ther's
death, among the papers he had en‚à£joined
her to destory. It was open upon
the table, before her, among some loose
drawings, having, with them, been taken
out of a little box by Emily, some hours
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
before. The sight of it called up many in‚à£teresting
reflections, but the melancholy
sweetnes of the countenance foothed the
emotions, which these had occafioned. It
was the same style of countenance as that of
her late father, and, while she gazed on it
with fondness on this account, she even
fancied a resemblance in the features. But
this tranquillity was suddenly interrupted,
when she recollected the words in the ma‚à£nuscript,
that had been found with this pic‚à£ture,
and which had formerly occasioned
her so much doubt and horror. At length,
she roused herself from the deep reverie,
into which this remembrance had thrown
her; but, when she rose to undress, the
silence and solitude, to which she was left,
at this midnight hour, for not even a distant
sound was now heard, conspired with the
impression the subject she had been consi‚à£dering
had given to her mind, to appall
her. Annette's hints, too, concerning
this chamber, simple as they were, had
not failed to affect her, since they fol‚à£lowed
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
a circumstance of peculiar horror,
which she herself had witnessed, and since
the scene of this was a chamber nearly ad‚à£joining
her own.</P>
<P>The door of the stair-case was, perhaps,
a subject of more reasonable alarm, and she
now began to apprehend, such was the ap‚à£titude
of her fears, that this stair-case had
some private communication with the apart‚à£ment,
which she shuddered even to remem‚à£ber.
Determined not to undress, she lay
down to sleep in her clothes, with her late
father's dog, the faithful <HI>Manchon,</HI> at the
foot of the bed, whom she considered as a
kind of guard.</P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, she tried to banish
reflection, but her busy fancy would still
hover over the subjects of her interest, and
she heard the clock of the castle strike two,
before she closed her eyes.</P>
<P>From the disturbed slumber, into which
she then sunk, she was soon awakened by a
noise, which seemed to arise within her cham‚à£ber;
but the silence, that prevailed, as she
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
Fearfully listened, inclined her to believe,
that she had been alarmed by such sounds
as sometimes occur in dreams, and she laid
her head again upon the pillow.</P>
<P>A return of the noise again disturbed
her; it seemed to come from that part of
the room, which communicated with the
private stair-case, and she instantly remem‚à£bered
the odd circumstance of the door
having been fastened, during the preceding
night, by some unknown hand. Her late
alarming suspicion, concerning its com‚à£munication,
also occurred to her. Her heart
became faint with terror. Half raising her‚à£self
from the bed, and gently drawing aside
the curtain, she looked towards the door of
the stair-case, but the lamp, that burnt on the
hearth, spread so feeble a light through the
apartment, that the remote parts of it were
lost in shadow. The noise, however, which,
she was convinced, came from the door, con‚à£tinued.
It seemed like that made by the un‚à£drawing
of rusty bolts, and often ceased,
and was then renewed more gently, as
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
if the hand, that occasioned it, was restrained
by a fear of discovery.While Emily kept
her eyes fixed on the spot, she saw the door
move, and then slowly open, and perceived
something enter the room, but the extreme
duskiness prevented her distinguishing what
it was. Almost fainting with terror, she
had yet sufficient command over herself, to
check the shriek, that was escaping from her
lips, and, letting the curtain drop from her
hand, continued to observe in silence the mo‚à£tions
of the mysterious form she saw. It seem‚à£ed
to glide along the remote obscurity of the
apartment, then paused, and, as it approach‚à£ed
the hearth, she perceived, in the stronger
light, what appeared to be a human figure.
Certain remembrances now struck upon her
heart, and almost subdued the feeble re‚à£mains
of her spirits; she continued, how‚à£ever,
to watch the figure, which remained
for some time motionless, but then, advan‚à£cing
slowly towards the bed, stood silently at
the feet, where the curtains, being a little
open, allowed her still to see it; terror,
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
however, had now deprived her of the
power of discrimination, as well as of that
of utterance.</P>
<P>Having continued there a moment, the
form retreated towards the hearth, when it
took the lamp, held it up, surveyed the
chamber, for a few moments, and then
again advanced towards the bed. The
light at that instant awakening the dog,
that had slept at Emily's feet, he barked
loudly and, jumping to the floor, flew at
the stranger, who struck the animal smartly
with a sheathed sword, and, springing towards
the bed, Emily discovered‚ÄîCount Morano!</P>
<P>She gazed at him for a moment in speech‚à£less
affright, while he, throwing himself on
his knee at the bed-side, besought her to
fear nothing, and, having thrown down his
sword, would have taken her hand, when
the faculties, that terror had suspended, sud‚à£denly
returned; and she sprung from the
bed, in the dress, which surely a kind of
prophetic apprehension had prevented her,
on this night, from throwing aside.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267"/>
Morano rose, followed her to the door,
through which he had entered, and caught
her hand, as she reached the top of the stair‚à£case,
but not before she had discovered, by
the gleam of a lamp, another man half-way
down the steps. She now screamed in de‚à£spair,
and, believing herself given up by
Montoni, saw, indeed, no possibility of
escape.</P>
<P>The Count, who still held her hand, led
her back into the chamber.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy all this terror?‚Äù said he, in a tre‚à£mulous
voice. ‚ÄúHear me, Emily: I come
not to alarm you; no, by Heaven! I love
you too well‚Äîtoo well for my own peace.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily looked at him for a moment, in
fearful doubt.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThen leave me, sir,' said she, ‚Äúleave
me instantly.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHear me, Emily,‚Äù resumed Morano,
‚Äúhear me! I love, and am in despair‚Äîyes
‚Äîin despair. How can I gaze upon you,
and know, that it is, perhaps, for the last
time, without suffering all the phrensy of de‚à£spair?
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
But it shall not be so; you shall
be mine, in spite of Montoni and all his
villany.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIn spite of Montoni!‚Äù cried Emily
eagerly: ‚Äúwhat is it I hear?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou hear, that Montoni is a villain,‚Äù
exclaimed Morano with vehemence,‚Äî‚Äúa
villain who would have sold you to my
love!‚ÄîWho‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAnd is he less, who would have bought
me?‚Äù said Emily, fixing on the Count an
eye of calm contempt. ‚ÄúLeave the room,
sir, instantly,‚Äù she continued in a voice,
trembling between joy and fear, ‚Äúor I will
alarm the family, and you may receive that
from Signor Montoni's vengeance, which I
have vainly supplicated from his pity.‚Äù
But Emily knew, that she was beyond the
hearing of those, who might protect her.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou can never hope any thing from his
pity,‚Äù said Morano, ‚Äúhe has used me in‚à£famously,
and my vengeance shall pursue
him. And for you, Emily, for you, he has
new plans more profitable than the last, no
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
doubt.‚Äù The gleam of hope, which the
Count's former speech had revived, was
now nearly extinguished by the latter; and,
while Emily's countenance betrayed the
emotions of her mind, he endeavoured to
take advantage of the discovery.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI lose time,‚Äù said he: ‚ÄúI came not to
exclaim against Montoni; I came to solicit,
to plead‚Äîto Emily; to tell her all I suffer,
to entreat her to save me from despair, and
herself from destruction. Emily! the schemes
of montoni are insearchable, but, I warn
you, they are terrible; he has no principle,
when interest, or ambition leads. Can I
love you, and abandon you to his power?
Fly, then, fly from this gloomy prison, with
a lover, who adores you! I have bribed a
servant of the castle to open the gates, and,
before to-morrow's dawn, you shall be far
on the way to Venice.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, overcome by the sudden shock
she had received, at the moment, too, when
she had begun to hope for better days, now
thought she saw destruction surround her on
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
every side. Unable to reply, and almost to
think, she threw herself into a chair, pale
and breathless. That Montoni had for‚à£merly
sold her to Morano, was very proba‚à£ble;
that he had now withdrawn his con‚à£sent
to the marriage, was evident from the
Count's present conduct; and it was nearly
certain, that a scheme of stronger interest
only could have induced the selfish Mon‚à£toni
to forego a plan, which he had hitherto
so strenuously purssued. These reflections
made her tremble at the hints, which Mo‚à£rono
had just given, which she no longer
hesitated to believe; and, while she shrunk
from the new scenes of misery and oppres‚à£sion,
that might await her in the castle of
Udolpho, she was compelled to observe,
that almost her only means of escaping
them was by submitting herself to the pro‚à£tection
of this man, with whom evils more certain and not lest terrible appeared,‚Äîevils,
upon which she could not endure to pause
for an instant.</P>
<P>Her silence, though it was that of agony,
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
encouraged the hopes of Morano, who
watched her countenance with impatience,
took again the resisting hand she had with‚à£drawn,
and, as he pressed it to his heart,
again conjured her to determine immediate‚à£ly.
‚ÄúEvery moment we lose, will make our
departure more dangerous,‚Äù said he: ‚Äúthese
few moments lost may enable Montoni to
overtake us.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI beseech you, sir, be silent,‚Äù said
Emily faintly: ‚ÄúI am indeed very wretch‚à£ed,
and wretched I must remain. Leave
me‚ÄîI command you, leave me to my
fate.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNever!‚Äù cried the Count vehemently:
‚Äúlet me perish first! But forgive my vio‚à£lence!
the thought of losing you is madness.
You cannot be ignorant of Montoni's cha‚à£racter,
you may be ignorant of his schemes
‚Äînay, you must be so, or you would not
hesitate between my love and his power.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNor do I hesitate,‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúLet us go, then,‚Äù said Morano, eagerly
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
kissing her hand, and rising, ‚Äúmy carriage
waits, below the castle walls.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou mistake me, sir,‚Äù said Emily.
‚ÄúAllow me to thank you for the interest
you express in my welfare, and to decide by
my own choice. I shall remain under the
protection of Signor Montoni.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúUnder his protection!‚Äù exclaimed Mo‚à£rano,
proudly, ‚Äúhis <HI>protection!</HI> Emily,
why will you suffer yourself to be thus de‚à£luded?
I have already told you what you
have to expect form his <HI>protection.‚Äù</HI></P>
<P>‚ÄúAnd pardon me, sir, if, in this instance,
I doubt mere assertion, and, to be convinced,
require something approaching to proof.‚Äù</P>
<P>I have now neither the time, or the'
means of adducing proof,‚Äù replied the
Count.</P>
<P>‚ÄúNor have I, sir, the inclination to listen
to it, if you had.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúBut you trifle with my patience and my distress,‚Äù continued Morano. ‚ÄúIs a
marriage with a man, who adores you, so
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
very terrible in your eyes, that you would
prefer to it all the misery, to which Mon‚à£toni
may condemn you in this remote pri‚à£son?
Some wretch must have stolen those
affections, which ought to be mine, or you
could not thus obstinately persist in re‚à£fusing
an offer, that would place you be‚à£yond
the reach of oppression.‚Äù Morano
walked about the room, with quick steps,
and a disturbed air.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThus discourse, Count Morano, suffi‚à£ciently
proves, that my affections ought not
to be yours,‚Äù said Emily, mildly, ‚Äúand
this conduct, that I should not be placed
beyond the reach of oppression, so long as I
remained in your power. If you wish me
to believe otherwise, cease to oppress me
any longer by your presence. If you re‚à£fuse
this, you will compel me to expose you
to the resentment of Signor Montoni.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes let him come,‚Äù cried Morano furi‚à£ously,
‚Äúand brave <HI>my</HI> resentment! Let
him dare to face once more the man he has
so courageously injured; danger shall teach
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
him morality, and vengeance justice‚Äîlet
him come, and receive my sword in his
heart!‚Äù</P>
<P>The vehemence, with which this was ut‚à£tered,
gave Emily new cause of alarm, who
arose from her chair, but her trembling frame
refused to support her, and she resumed
her seat;‚Äîthe words died on her lips, and,
when she looked wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>t fully towards the door
of the corridor, which was locked, she con‚à£sidered
it was impossible for her to leave
the apartment, before Morano would be ap‚à£prised
of, and able to counteract, her inten‚à£tion.</P>
<P>Without observing her agitation, he con‚à£tinued
to pace the room in the utmost per‚à£turbation
of spirits. His darkened counte‚à£nance
expressed all the rage of jealousy and
revenge; and a person, who had seen his fer‚à£tures
under the smile of ineffable tenderness,
which he so lately assumed, would now
scarcely have believed them to be the same.</P>
<P>‚ÄúCount Morano,‚Äù said Emily, at length
recovering her voice, ‚Äúcalm, I entreat you,
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
these transports, and listen to reason, if you
will not to pity. You have equally mif‚à£placed
your love and your hatred.‚ÄîI never
could have returned the affection, with which
you honour me, and certainly have never en‚à£couraged
it; neither has Signor Montoni
injured you, for you must have known, that
he had no right to dispose of my hand, had
he even possessed the power to do so. Leave,
then, leave the castle, while you may with
safety. Spare yourself the dreadful conse‚à£quences
of an unjust revenge, and the re‚à£morse
of having prolonged to me these mo‚à£ments
of suffering.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIs it for mine, or for Montoni's safety,
that you are thus alarmed?‚Äù said Morano,
coldly, and turning towards her with a look
of acrimony.</P>
<P>‚ÄúFor both,‚Äù replied Emily, in a trem‚à£bling
voice.</P>
<P>‚ÄúUnjust revenge!‚Äù cried the Count, re‚à£suming
the abrupt tones of passion. ‚ÄúWho,
that looks upon that face, can imagine a punishment adequate to the injury he would
<PB N="274" REF="276"/>
have done me? Yes, I will leave the castle;
but it shall not be alone. I have trifled too
long. Since my prayers and my sufferings
cannot prevail, force shall. I have people in
waiting, who shall convey you to my carriages.
Your voice will bring no fuccour; it can‚à£not
be heard from this remote part of
the castle; submit, therefore, in silence to
go with me.‚Äù</P>
<P>This was an unnecessary injunction, at
present; for Emily was too certain, that her
call would avail her nothing; and terror
had so entirely disordered her thoughts, that
she knew not how to plead to Morano, but sat,
mute and trembling, in her chair, till he ad‚à£vanced
to lift her from it, when she suddenly
raised herself, and, with a repulsive gesture,
and a countenance of forced ferenity, said,
‚ÄúCount Morano! I am now in your power;
but you will observe, that this is not the
conduct which can win the esteem you ap‚à£pear
so solicitous to obtain, and that you
are preparing for yourself a load of remorse,
in the miseries of a friendless orphan, which
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
can never leave you. Do you believe your
heart to be, indeed, so hardened, that you
can look without emotion on the suffering,
to which you would condemn me?‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P>Emily was interrupted by the growling
of the dog, who now came again from the
bed, and Morano looked towards the door
of the stair-case, where no person appear‚à£ing,
he called aloud, ‚ÄúCesario!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúEmily,‚Äù said the Count, ‚Äúwhy will
you reduce me to adopt this conduct? How
much more willingly would I persuade,
than compel you to become my wife! but,
by Heaven! I will not leave you to be sold
by Montoni. Yet a thought glances across
my mind, that brings madness with it. I
know not how to name it. It is preposterous
‚Äîit cannot be.‚ÄîYet you tremble‚Äîyou
grow pale! It is! it is so;‚Äîyou‚Äîyou‚Äîlove
Montoni!‚Äù cried Morano, grasping Emily's
wrist, and stamping his foot on the floor.</P>
<P>An involuntary air of surprise appeared
on her countenance. ‚ÄúIf you have indeed
believed so,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúbelieve so still.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="278"/>
‚ÄúThat look, those words confirm it,‚Äù
exclaimed Morano, furiously. ‚ÄúNo, no,
no, Montoni had a richer prize in view,
than gold. But he shall not live to tri‚à£umph
over me!‚ÄîThis very instant‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>He was interrupted by the loud barking
of the dog.</P>
<P>‚ÄúStay, Count Morano,‚Äù said Emily,
terrified by his words, and by the fury ex‚à£pressed
in his eyes, ‚ÄúI will save you from
this error.‚ÄîOf all man, Signor Montoni is
not your rival; though, if I find all other
mean of saving myself vain, I will try
whether my voice may not arouse his ser‚à£vants
to my succour.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAssertion,‚Äù replied Morano, ‚Äúat such
a moment, is not to be depended upon.
How could I suffer myself to doubt, even
for an instant, that he could see you, and
not love?‚ÄîBut my first care shall be to
convey you from the castle. Cesario! ho,
‚ÄîCesario!‚Äù</P>
<P>A man now appeared at the door of the
stair-case, and other steps were heard ascend‚à£ing
<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
Emily uttered a loud shriek, as Mo‚à£rano
hurried her across the chamber, and,
at the same moment, she heard a noise at the
door, that opened upon the corridor. The
Count paused an instant, as if his mind was
suspended between love and the desire of
vengeance; and, in that instant, the door
gave way, and Montoni, followed by the
old steward and several other persons, burst
into the room.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDraw!‚Äù cried Montoni to the Count,
who did not pause for a second bidding,
but, giving Emily into the hand of the
people, that appeared from the stair-case,
turned fiercely round. ‚ÄúThis in thine
heart, villain!‚Äù said he, as he made a thrust
at Montoni with his sword, who parried
the blow, and aimed another, while some of
the persons who had followed him into the
room, endeavoured to part the combatants,
and others rescued Emily from the hands of
Morano's servants.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWar it for this, Count Morano,‚Äù said
<PB N="278" REF="280"/>
Montoni, in a cool sarcastic tone of voice,
‚Äúthat I received you under my roof, and
permitted you, though my declared enemy,
to remain under it for the night? Was it,
that you might repay my hospitality with
the treachery of a fiend, and rob me of my
niece?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWho talks of treachery?‚Äù said Mo‚à£rano,
in a tone of unrestrained vehemence.
‚ÄúLet him that does, shew an unblushing face
of innocence. Montoni, you are a villain!
If there is treachery in this affair, look to
yourself as the author of it. <HI>If</HI>‚Äîdo I say?
<HI>I</HI>‚Äîwhom you have wronged with unexam‚à£pled
baseness, whom you have injured al‚à£most
beyond redress! But why do I use
words?‚ÄîCome on, coward, and receive
justice at my hands!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúCoward!‚Äù cried Montoni, bursting from
the people who held him, and rushing on the
Count, when they both retreated into the
corridor, where the fight continued so despe‚à£rately,
that none of the spectators dared ap‚à£proach
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
them, Montoni swearing, that the
first, who interfered, should fall by his
sword.</P>
<P>Jealousy and revenge lent all their fury
to Morano, while the superior skill and the
temperance of Montoni enabled him to
wound his adversary, whom his servants now
attempted to seize, but he would not be re‚à£strained,
and, regardless of his would con‚à£tinued
to fight. He seemed to be insensible
both of pain and loss of blood, and alive
only to the energy of his passions. Mon‚à£toni,
on the contrary, persevered in the com‚à£bat,
with a fierce, yet wary, valour; he re‚à£ceived
the pint of Morano's sword on his
arm but, almo't in the same instant, se‚à£verily
wounded and disarmed him. The
Count then fell back into the arms of his
servant, while Montoni held his sword over
him, and bade him ask his like. Morano,
sinking under the anguish of his wound,
had scarcely replied by a gesture, and by a
few words, feebly articulated, that he would
not‚Äîwhen he fainted; and Montoni was
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
then going to have plunged the sword into
his breast, as he lay senseless, but his arm
was arrested by Cavigni. To the inter‚à£ruption
he yielded without much difficulty,
but his complexion changed almost to
blakness, as he looked upon his fallen ad‚à£versary,
and ordered, that he should be car‚à£ried
instantly from the cattle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Emily, who had been
with-held from leaving the chamber during
the affray, now came forward into the cor‚à£ridor,
and pleaded a cause of common hu‚à£manity,
with the feelings of the warmest
benevolence, when she entreated Montoni
to allow Morano the assistance in the castle,
which his situation required. But Mon‚à£toni,
who had seldom listened to pity, now
seemed rapacious of vengeance, and, with a
monster's cruelty, again ordered his defeated
enemy to be taken from the castle, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="‚Ä¢‚Ä¢"/>s
present state, though there were only the
woods, or a solitary neighbouring cottage,
to shelter him form the night.</P>
<P>The Count's servants having declared,
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
that they would not move him till he re‚à£vived,
Montoni's stood inactive, Cavigni re‚à£monstrating,
and Emily, superior to Mon‚à£toni's
menaces, giving water to Morano,
and directing the attendants to bind up his
wound. At length, Montoni had leisure to
feel pain form his own hurt, and he with‚à£drew
to examine it.</P>
<P>The Count, meanwhile, having slowly re‚à£coverd,
the first object he saw, on raising
his eyes, was Emily, bending over him
with a countenance strongly expressive of
solicitude. He surveyed her with a look of
anguish.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI have deserved this,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúbut not
form Montoni. It is from you, Emily,
that I have deserved punishment, yet I re‚à£ceive
only pity!‚Äù He paused, for the had
spoken with difficulty. After a moment,
he proceeded. ‚ÄúI must resign you, but
not to Montoni. Forgive me the suf‚à£ferings
I have already occasioned you! But
for <HI>that</HI> villain‚Äîhis infamy shall not go
unpunished. Carry me from this place,‚Äù
<PB N="282" REF="284"/>
said he to his servants. ‚ÄúI am in no con‚à£dition
to travel: you must, therefore, take
me to the nearest cottage, for I will not pass
the night under his roof, although I may
expire on the way from it.‚Äù</P>
<P>Cesario proposed to go out, and enquire
for a cottage, that might receive his master,
before he attempted to remove him‚Äù but Marano was impatient to be gone; the an‚à£guish
of his mind seemed to be ever greater
than that of his wound, and he rejected, with
disdain, the offer of Cavigni to entreat
Montoni, that he might be suffered to pass
the night in the castle. Cesario was now
going to call up the carriage to the great
gate, but the Count forbade him. ‚ÄúI can‚à£not
bear the motion of a carriage,‚Äù said he:
‚Äúcall some others of my people, that they
may assist in bearing me in their arms.‚Äù</P>
<P>At length, however, Morano submitted
to reason, and consented, that Cesario should
first prepare some cottage to receive him.
Emily, now that he had recovered his
senses, was about to withdraw from the cor‚à£ridor,
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
when a message from Montoni com‚à£manded
her to do so, and also that the
Count, if he was not already gone, should
quit the castle immediately. Indignation
flashed from Morano's eyes, and flushed
his cheeks</P>
<P>‚ÄúTell Montoni‚Äù said he,‚Äù that I shall
go when it suits my own convenience; that I quit the castle, he dares to call his, as I
would the nest of a serpeht, and that this is
not the last he shall hear from me. Tell
him, I will not leave <HI>another</HI> murder on his
conscience, if I can help it.‚Äù</P>
<P>"Count Morano! do you know what
you say?‚Äù said Cavigni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, Signor, I know well what I say,
and he will understand well what I mean.
His conscience will assist his understanding,
on this occasion.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúCount Morano,‚Äù said Verezzi, who had
hitherto silently observed him, ‚Äúdare again
to insult my friend, and I will plunge this
sword in your body.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt would be an action worthy the friend
<PB N="284" REF="286"/>
of a villain!‚Äù said Morano, as the strong
impulse of his indignation enabled his to
raise himself from the arms of his servants;
but the energy was momentary, and he sunk
back, exhausted by the effort. Montoni's
people, meanwhile, held Verezzi, who seem‚à£ed
inclined, even in this instant, to execute
his threat; and Cavigni, who was not so de‚à£praved
as to abet the cowardly malignity of
Verezzi, endeavoured to withdraw him
from the corridor; and Emily whom a
compassionate interest had thus long de‚à£tained,
was now quitting it in new terror,
when the supplication voice of Morano ar‚à£rested
her, and, by a feeble gesture, he beck‚à£oned
her to draw nearer. She advanced
with timid steps, but the fainting languor of
his countenance again awakened her pity,
and overcome her terror.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI am going from hence for ever‚Äù said
he: ‚Äúperhaps, I shall never see you again.
I would carry with me your forgiveness,
Emily; nay more‚ÄîI would also carry your
good wishes.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="287"/>
‚ÄúYou have my forgiveness, then,‚Äù said
Emily, ‚Äúand my sincere wishes for your
recovery.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAnd only for my recovery?‚Äù said Mo‚à£rano,
with a sigh. ‚ÄúFor your general
welfare,‚Äù added Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúPerhaps I ought to be contented with
this,‚Äù he resumed; ‚ÄúI certainly have not
deserved more; but I would ask you, Emily,
sometimes to think of me, and, forgetting
my offence, to remember only the passion
which occasioned it. I would ask, alas!
impossibilities: I would ask you to love me!
At this moment, when I am about to part
with you, and that, perhaps, for ever, I am
scarcely myself. Emily‚Äîmay you never
know the torture of a passion like mine!
What do I say? O, that, for me, you
might be sensible of such a passion!‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily looked impatient to be gone. ‚ÄúI
‚Äúentreat you, Count, to consult your own
safety,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúand linger here no longer.
I tremble for the consequences of Signor Ve‚à£rezzi's
passion, and of Montoni's resentment,
should he learn that you are still here.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="288"/>
Morano's face was overspread with a
momentary crimson, his eyes sparkled, but
he seemed endeavouring to conquer his emo‚à£tion,
and replied in a calm voice, ‚Äúsince
you are interested for my sfety, I will re‚à£gard
it, and be gone. But, before I go,
let me again hear you say, that you wish me
well,‚Äù faid he, fixing on her an earnest and
mournful look.</P>
<P>Emily repeated her assurances. He took
her hand, which she scarcely attempted to
withdraw, and put it to his lips. ‚ÄúFare‚à£wel,
Count Morano!‚Äù said Emily; and she
turned to go, when a second message arriv‚à£ed
from Montoni, and she again conjured
Morano, as he valued his life, to quit the
castle immediately. He regarded her in
silence, with a look of fixed despair. But
she had no time to enforce her compas‚à£sionate
entreaties, and, not daring to dis‚à£obey
the second command of Montoni, she
left the corridor, to attend him.</P>
<P>He was in the cedar parlour, that ad‚à£joined
the great hall, laid upon a couch,
<PB N="287" REF="289"/>
and suffering a degree of anguish form his
wound, which few persons could have dis‚à£guised,
as he did. His countenance, which
was stern, but calm, expressed the dark pas‚à£sion
of revenge, but no symptom of pain;
bodily pain, indeed, he had always despised,
and had yielded only to the strong and
terrible energies of the soul. He was at‚à£tended
by old Carlo and by Signor Berto‚à£lini,
by Madame Montoni was not with him.</P>
<P>Emily trembled, as she approached and
received his severs rebuke, for not having
obeyed his first summons; and perceived,
also, that he attributed her stay in the cor‚à£ridor
to a motive, that had not even occur‚à£red
to her artless mind.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThis is an instance of female caprice,‚Äù
said he, ‚Äúwhich I ought to have foreseen.
Count Morano, whose suit you obstinately
rejected, so long as it was countenanced by
me, you favour, it seems, since you find I
have dismissed him.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily looked astonished. ‚ÄúI do not
<PB N="288" REF="290"/>
comprehend you, sir,‚Äù said she: ‚ÄúYou cer‚à£tainly
do not mean to imply, that the de‚à£sign
of the Count to visit the double-cham‚à£ber,
was founded upon any approbation of
mine.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúTo that I reply nothing,‚Äù said Mon‚à£toni;
‚Äúbut it must certainly be a more
than common interest, that made you plead
so warmly in his cause, and that could de‚à£tain
you thus long in his presence, contrary
to my express order‚Äîin the presence of a
man, whom you have hitherto, on all occa‚à£sions,
most scrupulously shunned!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI fear,sir, it was a more than common
interest, that detained me,‚Äù said Emily
calmly; ‚Äúfor of late I have been inclined
to think, that of compassion is an uncom‚à£mon
one. But how could I, could <HI>you,</HI> sir,
witness Count Morano's deplorable con‚à£dition,
and not wish to relieve it?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou add hypocrisy to caprice,‚Äù said
Montoni, frowning, ‚Äúand an attempt at
satire, to both; bur, before you undertake
to regulate the morals of other persons,
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
you should learn and practise the virtues,
which are indispensable to a woman‚Äîsincerity,
uniformity of conduct and obe‚à£dience.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, who had always endeavoured to
regulate her conduct by the nicest laws, and
whose mind was finely sensible, not only of
what is just in morals, but of whatever is
beautiful in the female character, was
shocked by these words; yet, in the next
moment, her heart swelled with the con‚à£sciousness
of having deserved praise, in‚à£stead
of censure, and she was proudly silent.
Montoni, acquainted with the delicacy of
her mind, knew how keenly she would feel
his rebuke; but he was a stranger to the
luxury of conscious worth, and, therefore,
did not foresee the energy of that sentiment,
which now repelled his satire. Turning to
a servant who had lately entered the room,
he asked whether Morano had quitted the
castle. The man answered, that his ser‚à£vants
were then removing him, on a couch,
to a neighbouring cottage. Montoni seem‚à£ed
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
somewhat appeased, on hearing this;
and, when Ludovico appeared, a few mo‚à£ments
after,and said, that Morano was
gone, he told Emily she might retire to
her apartment.</P>
<P>She withdrew willingly from his pre‚à£sence;
but the thought of passing the re‚à£mainder
of the night in a chamber, which
the door from the stair-case made liable to
the intrusion of any person, now alarmed
her more than ever, and she determined to
call at Madam Montoni's room, and re‚à£quest,
that Annette might be permitted to
be with her.</P>
<P>On reaching the great gallery, she heard
voices seemingly in dispute, and, her spirits
now apt to take alarm, she paused, but
soon distinguished some words of Cavigni
and Verezzi, and went towards them, in
the hope of conciliating their difference.
They were alone. Verezzi's face was still
flushed with rage; and, as the first object of
it was now removed from him, he appear‚à£ed
willing to transfer his resentment to Ca‚à£vigni,
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
who seemed to be expostulating,
rather than disputing, with him.</P>
<P>Verezzi was protesting, that he would
instantly inform Montoni of the insult,
which Morano had thrown out against him,
and above all, that, wherein he had accused
him of murder.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThere is no answering,‚Äù said Cavigni,
‚Äúfor the words of a man in a passion; lit‚à£tle
serious regard ought to be paid to them.
If you persist in your resolution, the con‚à£sequences
may be fatal to both. We have
now more serious interests to pursue, than
those of a petty revenge.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily joined her entreaties to Cavigni's
arguments, and they, at length, prevailed
so far, as that Verezzi consented to retire,
without seeing Montoni.</P>
<P>On calling at her aunt's apartment, she
found it fastened. In a few minutes, how‚à£ever,
it was opened by Madame Montoni
herself.</P>
<P>It may be remembered, that it was by a
door leading into the bed-room from a
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
back passage, that Emily had secretly en‚à£tered
a few hours preceding. She now
conjectured, by the calmness of Madame
Montoni's air, that she was not apprised of
the accident, which had befallen her husband,
and was beginning to inform her of
it, in the tenderest manner she could, when
her aunt interrupted her, by saying, she was
acquainted with the whole affair.</P>
<P>Emily knew indeed, that she had little
reason to love Montoni, but could scarcely
have believed her capable of such perfect
apathy, as she now discovered towards him;
having obtained permission, however, for
Annette to sleep ni her chamber, she went
thither immediately.</P>
<P>A track of blood appeared along the
corridor, leading to it; and on the spot,
where the Count and Montoni had fought,
the whole flor was stained. Emily shud‚à£dered,
and leaned on Annette, as she pass‚à£ed.
When she reached her apartment, she
instantly determined, since the door of the
stair-case had been left open, and that An‚à£nette
<PB N="293" REF="295"/>
was now with her, to explore whither
it led,‚Äîa circumstance now materially con‚à£nected
with her won safety. Annette ac‚à£cordingly,
half curious and half afraid,
proposed to descend the stairs; but, on ap‚à£proaching
the door, they perceived, that it
was already fastened without, and their care
was then directed to the securing it on the
inside also, by placing against it as much
of the heavy furniture of the room, as they
could lift. Emily then retired to bed, and
Annette continued on a chair by the hearth,
where some feeble embers remained.</P>

<P>It is now necessary to mention some cir‚à£cumstance,
which could not be related
amidst the events of Emily's hasty departure
from Venice, or toghether with those which
so rapidly succeeded to her arrival in the
castle.</P>
<P>On the morning of her journey, Count
Morano had gone at the appointed hour to
the mansion of Montoni, to demand his
bride. When he reached it, he was some‚à£what
surprised by the silenc and solitary
air of the portico, where Montoni's lacqueys
usually loitered; but surprise was soon
changed to astonishment, and astonishment
to the rage of disappointment, when the
door was opened by an old woman, who
told his servants, that her master and his
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
family had left Venice, early in the morning,
for <HI>Terra-firma.</HI> Scarcely believing what
his sercvant told, he left his gondola, and
rushed into the hall to enquire further. The
old woman, who was the only person left in
care of the mansion, persisted in her story,
which the silent and deserted apartments
soon convinced him was no fiction. He
then seized her with a menacing air, as if he
meant to wreak all his vengeance upon her,
at the same time asking her twenty questions
in a breath, and all these with a gesticula‚à£tion
so furious, that she was deprived of the
power of answering them; then suddenly
letting her go, her stamped about the hall,
like a madman, cursing Montoni and his
own folly.</P>
<P>When the good woman was at liberty;
and had somewhat recovered from her fright,
she told him all she knew of the affair, which
was, indeed, very little, but enough to en‚à£able
Morano to discover, that Montoni was
gone to his castle on the Apennine. Thither
he followed, as soon as his servants could
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
complete the necessary preparation for the
journey, accompanied by a friend, and at‚à£tended
by a number his people, deter‚à£mined
to obtain Emily, or a full revenge
on Montoni. When his mind had reco‚à£vered
from the first effervescence of rage,
and his thoughts became less obscured, his
conscience hinted to him certain circum‚à£stances,
which, in some measure, explained
the conduct of Montoni: but how the latter
could have been led to suspect an inten‚à£tion,
which, he had believed, was known only
to himself, he could not even guess. On
this occasion, however, he had been partly
betrayed by that sympathetic intelligence,
which may be said to exist between bad minds,
and which reaches one man to judge what
another will do in the same circumstances.
Thus it was with Montoni, who had now
received indisputable proof of a truth, which
he had some time suspected‚Äîthat Morano's
circumstances, instead of being affluent, as
he had been bidden to believe, were greatly in‚à£volved.
Montoni had been interested in his
<PB N="297" REF="299"/>
fuit, by motives entirely selfiss, those of ava‚à£rice
and pride; the last of which would
have been gratified by an alliance with a
Venetian noblemen, the former by Emily's
estate in Gas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>ony, which he had stipulated,
as the price of his favour, should be de‚à£livered
up to him from the day of her
marriage. In the mean time, he had been
led to suspect the consequence of the Count's
boundless extravagance; but it was not till
the evening, preceding the intended nuptials,
that he obtained certain information of his
distressed circumstances. He did not hesi‚à£tate
then to infer, that Morano designed to
defraud him of Emily's estate; and in this
supposition he was confirmed, and with ap‚à£parent
reason, by the subsequent conduct of
the Count, who, after having appointed to
meet him on that night, for the purpose of
signing the instrument, which was to secure
to him his reward, failed in his engagement.
Such a circumstance, indeed, in a man of
Morano's gay and thoghtless character, and
at a time when his mind was engaged by
<PB N="298" REF="300"/>
the bustle of preparation for his nuptials,
might have been attributed to a cause less
decisive, than design; but Montoni did not
hesitate an instant to interpret it his own way,
and, after vainly waiting the Count's arrival,
for several hours, he gave orders for his
people to be in readiness to set off at a mo‚à£ment's
notice. By hastening to Udolpho
he intended to remove Emily from the
reach of Morano, as well as to break off
the affair, without submitting himself to use‚à£less
altercation: and, if the Count meant what
he called honourably, he would doubtless
follow Emily, and sign the writings in ques‚à£tion.
If this was done, so little considera‚à£tion
had Montoni for her welfare, that he
would not have scrupled to sacrifice her to
a man of ruined fortune, since by that means
he could enrich himeself; asnd he forbore to
mention to her the motive of his sudden
journey, left the hope it might revive should
render her more intractable, when submission
would be required.</P>
<P>With the se considerations, he had left Ve‚à£nice;
<PB N="299" REF="301"/>
and, with others totally different, Mo‚à£rano
had, soon after, pursued his steps across
the rugged Apennines. When his arrival
was announced at the castle, Montoni did
not believe, that he would have presumed
to shew himself, unless he had meant to fulfil
his engagement, and he, therefore, readily
admitted him; but the enraged countenarice
and expressions of Morano, as he entered
the apartment, instantly undeceived him;
and, when Montoni had explained, in part,
the motives of his abrupt departure from
Venice, the Count still persisted in demand‚à£ing
Emily, and reproaching Montoni, with‚à£out
even naming the former stipulation.</P>
<P>Montoni, at length, weary of the dispute,
deferred the settling of it till the morrow,
and Morano retired with some hope, sug‚à£gested
by Montoni's apparent indecision.
When, however, in the silence of his own
apartment, he began to consider the past
conversation, the character of Montoni, and
some former instances of his duplicity, the
hope, which he had admitted, vanished, and
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>
he determined not to neglect the present pos‚à£sibility
of obtaining Emily by other means.
To his confidential valet he told his design
of carrying away Emily, and sent him back
to Montoni's servants to find out one among
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>hem, who might enable him to execute it.
The choice of this person he entrusted to
the fellow's own discernment, and not im‚à£prudently;
for he discovered a man, whom
Montoni had, on some former occasion,
treated harshly, and who was now ready to
betray him. This man conducted cesario
round the castle, through a private passage,
to the stair-casse, that led to Emily's cham‚à£ber;
then shewed him a sshort way out of
the building, and af<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>erwards procured him
the keys, that would secure his retreat. The
man was well rewarded for his trouble; how
the Count was rewarded for his treachery,
has already appeared.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, old Carlo had overheard two
of Morano's servants, who had been ordered
to be in waiting with the carriage, beyond the
castle walls, expressing their surprise at their
<PB N="301" REF="303"/>
master's sudden, and secrer departure, for the
valet had entrusted them with no more of Mo‚à£rano's
designs, than it was necessary for them
to execute. They, however, indulged them‚à£selves
in surmises, and in expressing them to
each other; and from these Carlo had drawn a
just conclusion. But, before he ventured to
disclose his apprehensions to Montoni, he en‚à£deavoured
to obtain further confirmation of
them, and, for this purpose, placed himself,
with one of his fellow servants, at the door
of Emily's apartment, that opened upon the
corridor. He did not watch long in vain,
though the growling of the dog had once
nearly betrayed him. When he was con‚à£vinced,
that Morano was in the room, and
had listened long enough to his conversation,
to understand his scheme, he immediately
alarmed Montoni, and thus rescued Emily
from the designs of the count.</P>
<P>Montoni, on the following morning, ap‚à£peared
as usual, except that he wore his
wounded arm in a sting; he went out upon
the ramparts; overlooked the men employed
<PB N="302" REF="304"/>
in rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>ring them; gave orders for additional
workmen, and then came into the castle to
give audience to several persons, who were
just arrived, and who were shewen into a pri‚à£vate
apartment, where he communicated
with them, for near an hour. Carlo was then
summoned, and ordered to conduct the
strangers to a part of the castle, which, in
former times, had been occupied by the up‚à£per
servants of the family, and to provide
them with every necessary refreshment.‚Äî
When he had done this, he was bidden to
return to his masster.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Count remained in a cot‚à£tage
in the skirts of the woods below, suffer‚à£ing
under bodily and mental pain, and me‚à£ditating
deep revenge against Montoni. His
servant, whom he had dispatched for a surgeon
to the nearest town, which was however, at
a considerable distance, did not return till
the following day, when, his wounds being
examined and dressed, the plractitioner re‚à£fused
to deliver any positive opinion, con‚à£cerning
the degree of danger attending them;
<PB N="303" REF="305"/>
but, giving his patient a composing draught
and ordering him to be kept quiet, remained
at the cottage to watch the event.</P>
<P>Emily, for the remainder of the late
eventful night, had been suffered to sleep,
undisturbed; and, when her mind recovered
from the confusion of slumber, and she re‚à£membered,
that she was now released from
the addresses of Count Morano, her spirits
were suddenly relieved from a part of the
terrible anxiety, that had long oppressed
them; that which remained, arose chief<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>y
from a recollection of Morano's assertions,
concerning the schemes of Montoni. He
had said, that plans of the latter, concerning
Emily, were insearchable, yet that he knew
them to be terible. At the time he uttered
this, she almost believed it to be designed
for the purpose of prevailing with her to
throw herself into his protection, and she
still thought it might be chiefly so ac‚à£counted
for; but his assertions had left an
impression on her mind, which a consdera‚à£tion
<PB N="304" REF="306"/>
of the character and former conduct of
Montoni did not contribute to efface. She,
however, checked her propensity to antici‚à£pate
evil; and, determined to enjoy this
respite from actual misfortune, tried to dis‚à£miss
thought, took her instruments for draw‚à£ing,
and placed herself at a window, to select
into a landscape some features of the scenery
without.</P>
<P>As she was thus employed, she saw, walk‚à£ing
on the rampart below, the men, who
had so lately arrived at the castle. The
sight of strangers surprised her, but still
more, of strangers such as these. There was
a singularity in their dress, and a certain
fierceness in their air, that fixed all her at‚à£tention.
She withdrew from the casement,
while they passed, but soon returned to ob‚à£serve
them further. Their fugures seemed
so well suited to the wildness of the sur‚à£rounding
objects, that, as they stood survey‚à£ing
the castle, she sketched them for ban‚à£ditti,
amid the mountain-view of her picture,
<PB N="305" REF="307"/>
when sthe had finished which, she was sur‚à£prised
to observe the spirit of her group.
But she had copied from nature.</P>
<P>Carlo, when he had placed refreshment be‚à£fore
these men in the apartment assigned to
them, returened, as he was ordered, to Mon‚à£toni,
who was anxious to discover by what
servant the keys of the castle had been de‚à£livered
to Morano, on the preceding night.
But this man, though he was too faithful to
his master quietly to see him injured, would
not betray a fellow-servant even to justice;
he, therefore, pretended to be ignorant who
it was, that had conspired with Count Mo‚à£rano,
and related, as before, that he had only
overheard some of the strangers describing
the plot.</P>
<P>Montoni's suspicions naturally fell upon
the porter, whom he ordered now to attend.
Carlo hesitated, and then with slow steps
went to seek him.</P>
<P>Barnardine, the porter, denied the accu‚à£sation
with a counteanance to steady and un‚à£daunted,
that Montoni could scarcely be‚à£lieve
<PB N="306" REF="308"/>
him guilty, though he knew not how
to think him innocent. At lenght, the man
was dismissed from his presence, and,
though the real offender, escaped detection.</P>
<P>Montoni then went to his wife's apart‚à£ment,
whither Emily followed soon after,
but, finding them in high dispute, was in‚à£stantly
leaving the room, when her aunt
called her back, and desired her to stay.‚Äî
‚ÄúYou shall be a witness,‚Äù said she,‚Äù of my
oppostion. Now, sir, repeat the command,
I have so often refused to obey.‚Äù</P>
<P>Montoni turned, with a stern countenance,
to Emily, and bade her quit the apartment,
while his wife persisted in desiring, that she
would staly. Emily was eager to escape
from this scene of contention, and anxious,
also, to serve her aunt, but she despaired of
conciliating Montoni, in whose eyes the ri‚à£sing
mpest of his soul flashed terribly.</P>
<P>"Leave the room,‚Äù said he, in a voice of
thunder. Emily obeyed, and, walking
down to the rampart, which the strangers
had now lest, continued to meditate on the
<PB N="307" REF="309"/>
unhappy marriage of her father's sister, and
on her own desolate situation, occasioned
by the ridiculous imprudence of her, whom
she had always wished to respect and love.
Madame Montoni's conduct had, indeed,
rendered in impossible for Emily to do ei‚à£ther;
but her gently heart was touched by
her distress, and, in the pity thus awakened,
she forgot the injurious treatment she had
received from her.</P>
<P>As she sauntered on the rampart, Annette
appeared at the hall door, looked cautiously
round, and then advanced to meet her.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDear m'amselle, I have been looking
for you all over the caftle,‚Äù said she. ‚ÄúIf
you will step this way, I will shew you a
picture.;</P>
<P>‚ÄúA picture!‚Äù exclaimed Emily, and
shuddered.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, ma'am, a picture of the late lady
of this place. Old Carlo Just now told me
it was her, and I thought you would be
curious to see it. As to my lady, you
know, ma'amselle, one cannot talk about
such things to her.‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="310"/>
‚ÄúAnd so,‚Äù said Emily smilingly, ‚Äúas
you must talk of them to somebody‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy, yes, ma'amselle; what can one
do in such a place as this, if one must not
talk? If I was in a dungeon, if they would
let me talk‚Äîit would be some comfort;
nay, I would talk, if it was only to the
walls. But come, ma'amselle, we lose
time‚Äîlet me shew you to the picture.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIs it veiled?‚Äù said Emily, pausing.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDear ma'amselle!‚Äù said Annette, fix‚à£ing
her eyes on Emily's face, ‚Äúwhat makes
you look so pale?‚Äîare you ill?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo, Annette, I am well enough, but I
have no desire to see this picutre; return
into the hall.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat! ma'am, not to see the lady of
this castle?‚Äù said the girl‚Äî‚Äúthe lady, who
disappeared so strangely? Well! now, I
would have run to the furthest mountain
we can see, yonder, to have got a sight of
such a picture; and, to speak my mind, that
strange story is all, that makes me care about
this old castle, though it makes me thrill all
over, as it were, whenever I think of it.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="311"/>
‚ÄúYes, Annette, you love the wonderful;
but do you know, that, unlessw you guard
against this inclination, it will lead you into
all the misery of superstition?‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette might have smiled in her turn, at
this sage observation of Emily, who could
tremble with ideal terrors, as much as her‚à£self,
and listen almost as eagerly to the re‚à£cital
of a mysterious story. Annette urged
her request.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAre you sure it is a picture?‚Äù said
Emily, ‚ÄúHave you seen it?‚ÄîIs it veiled?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHoly Maria! ma'amselle, yes, no, yes.
I am sure it is a picture‚ÄîI have seen it,
and it is not veiled!‚Äù</P>
<P>The tone and look of surprise, with which
this was uttered, recalled Emily's prudence;
who concealed her emotion under a smile;
and bade Annette lead her to the picture.
It was in an obscure chamber, adjoining
that part of the castle, allotted to the ser‚à£vants.
Several other portraits hung on the
walls, covered, like this, with dust and
cobweb.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="312"/>
‚ÄúThat is it, ma'amselle,‚Äù said Annette,
in a low voice, and pointing. Emily ad‚à£vanced,
and surveyed the picture. It re‚à£presented
a lady in teh flower of youth and
beauty; her features were handsome and
noble, full of strong expression, but had
little of the captivating sweetness, that
Emily had looked for, and still less of the
pensive mildness she loved. It was a coun‚à£tenance,
which spoke the language of pas‚à£sion,
rather than that of sentiment; a
haughty impatience of misfortune‚Äînot the
placid melancholy of a spirit injured, yet resigned.</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow many years have passed, since this
lady disappeared, Annette?‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúTwenty years, ma'amselle, or there‚à£about,
as they tell me; I know it is a long
while ago.‚Äù Emily continued to gaze upon the portrait.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI think,‚Äù resumed Annette, ‚Äúthe Signor
would do well to hang it in a better place,
than this old chamber. Now, in my mind,
he ought to place the picture of a lady, who
<PB N="311" REF="313"/>
gave him all these riches, in the handsomest
room in the castle. But he may have good
reasons for what he does: and some peo‚à£ple
do say, that he has lost his riches, as
well as his gratitude. But hush, ma'am,
not a word!‚Äù added Annette, laying her
finger on her lips. Emily was too much
absorbed in thought, to hear what she said.</P>
<P>‚Äú'T is a handsome lady, I am sure,‚Äù con‚à£tinued
Annette: ‚Äúthe Signor need not be
ashamed to put her in the great apartment,
where the veiled picutre hangs.‚Äù Emily
turned round. ‚ÄúBut for that matter, she
would be as little seen there, as here, for
the door is always locked, I find.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúLet us leave this chamber,‚Äù said
Emily: ‚Äúand let me caution you again,
Annett#eA; be guarded in your conversation,
and never tell, that you know any thing of
that picture.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHoly mother!,, exclaimed Annette,
‚Äúit is no secret; why all the servants have
seen it already!‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily started. ‚ÄúHow is this?‚Äù said
sthe‚Äî‚ÄúHave seen it! When?‚Äîhow?‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="314"/>
‚ÄúDear, ma'amselle, there is nothing sur‚à£prising
in that: we had all a little more <HI>cu‚à£rivnsness</HI>
than you had.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI thought you told me, the door was
kept locked?‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIf that was the case, ma'amselle,‚Äù re‚à£plied
Annette, looking about her, ‚Äúhow
could we get here?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO! you mean <HI>this</HI> picture,‚Äù said Emily,
with returning calmness. ‚ÄúWell, Annette,
here is nothing more to engage my atten‚à£tion;
we will go.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, as she passed to her own apart‚à£ment,
saw Montoni go down to the hall,
and she turned into her aunt's dressing‚à£room,
whom she found weeping and alone,
grief and resentment struggling on her
countenance. Pride had hitherto restrained
complaint. Judging of Emily's disposition
from her own, and from a consciousness
of what her treatment of her deserved, she
had believed, that her griefs would be cause
of triumph to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>er niece, rather than of
sympathy; that she would despise, not pity
<PB N="313" REF="315"/>
her. But the knew not knew not the tenderness and
benevolence of Emily's heart, that had al‚à£ways
taught her to forget her own injuries
in the misfortunes of her enemy. The suf‚à£ferings
of others, whoever they might be,
called forth her ready compassion, which
dissipated at once every obscuring cloud to
goodness, that passion or prejudice might
have raised in her mind.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni's sufferings, at length,
rose above her pride, and, when Emily had
before entered the room, she would have
told them all, had not her husband prevented
her; now that she was no longer restrained
by his presence, she poured forth all her
complaints to her niece.</P>
<P>‚ÄúO Emily!‚Äù she exclaimed, ‚ÄúI am the
m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>st wretched of women‚ÄîI am indeed
cruelly treated! Who, with my prospects
of happiness, could have foreseen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="‚Ä¢‚Ä¢"/>ch a
wretched fate as this?‚Äîwho could have
thought, when I married such a man as the
Signor, I should ever have to bewail my lot?
But there is no judging what is for the
<PB N="314" REF="316"/>
best‚Äîthere is no knowing what is for our
good! The most flattering prospects often
change‚Äîthe best judgments may be de‚à£ceived
‚Äîwho could have foreseen, when I
married the Signor, that I should ever re‚à£pent
my <HI>generosity?‚Äù</HI></P>
<P>Emily thought she might have foreseen
it, but this was not a thought of triumph.
She placed herself in a chair near her aunt,
took her hand, and, with one of those looks
of sost compassion, which might characterize
the countenance of a guardian angel, spoke
to her in the tenderest accents. But these
did not sooth Madame Montoni, whom im‚à£patience
to talk made unwilling to listen.
She wanted to complain, not to be consoled;
and it was by exclamations of complaint
only, that Emily learned the particular cir‚à£cumstances
of her affliction.</P>
<P>‚ÄúUngrateful man!‚Äù said Madame Mon‚à£toni,
‚Äúhe has deceived me in every respect;
and now he has taken me from my country
and friends, to shut me up in this old castle;
and, here he thinks he can compel me to
<PB N="315" REF="317"/>
do whatever he designs! But he shall find
himself mistaken, he shall find that no
threats can alter‚ÄîBut who would have
believed! who would have supposed, that a
man of his family and apparent wealth had
absolutely no fortune?‚Äîno, scarcely a se‚à£quin
of his own! I did all for the best; I
thought he was a man of consequence, of
great property, or I am sure I would never
have married him,‚Äîungrateful, artful man!‚Äù
She paused to take breath.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDear Madam, be composed,‚Äù said
Emily: ‚Äúthe Signor may not be so rich as
you had reason to expect, but surely he
cannot be very poor, since this castle and
the mansion at Venice are his. May I ask
what are the circumstances, that particu‚à£larly
affect you?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat are the cirucstances!‚Äù exclaim‚à£ed
Madame Montoni with resentment:
‚ÄúWhy is it not sufficient, that he had
long ago ruined his own fortune by play,
and that he has since lost what I brought
him‚Äîand that now he would compel me
<PB N="316" REF="318"/>
to sign away my settlement (it was well I
had the chief of my property settled on my‚à£felf!&gt;
that he may lose this also, or throw
it away in wild schemes, which nobody can
understand but himself? And, and‚Äîis
not all this sufficient?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is, indeed,‚Äù said Emily, ‚Äúbut you
must recollect, dear madam, that I knew
nothing of all this.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, and is it not sufficient,‚Äù rejoined
her aunt, ‚Äúthat he is also ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>olutely ruin‚à£ed,
thathe is sunk deeply in debt, and that
neither this castle, or the mansion at Venice,
is his own, if all his debts, honourable
and dishonourable, were paid!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI am shocked by what you tell me,
madam,‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAnd is it not enough,‚Äù interrupted
Madame Montoni, ‚Äúthat he has treated me
with neglect, with cruelty, because I re‚à£fused
to relinquish my settlements, and, in‚à£stead
of being frightened by his menaces,
resolutely defied him, and upbraided him
with his shameful conduct? But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/> bore
<PB N="317" REF="319"/>
all meekly,‚Äîyou know, niece, I never ut‚à£tered
a word of complaint, till now; no!
That such a disposition as mine should be so
imposed upon! That I, whose only faul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>s are
too much kindness, too much generosity,
should be chained for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/> life to such a vile,
deceitful, cruel monster!‚Äù</P>
<P>Want of breath compelled Madame
Montoni to stop. If any thing could have
made Emily smile in these moments, it
would have been this speech of her aunt,
delivered in a voice very little below a
scream;and with a vehemence of gesticula‚à£tion
and of countenance, that turned the
whole into burlesque. Emily saw, that
her misfortunes did not admit of real con‚à£solation,
and, contemning the common‚à£place
terms of superficial comsort, she was
silent; while Madame Montoni, jealous of
her own consequence, miftook this for the
silence of indifference, or of contempt, and
reproached her with want of duty and feel‚à£ing.</P>
<P>‚ÄúO! I suspected what all this boasted
<PB N="318" REF="320"/>
sensibility would prove to be!‚Äù rejoined
she; ‚ÄúI thought it would not teach
you to feel either duty, or affection, for
your relations, who have tgreated you like
their own daughter!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúPardon me, madam,‚Äù said Emily,
mildly, ‚Äúit is not natural to me to boast,
and it it was, I am sure I would not boast
of sensibility‚Äîa quality, perhaps, more to
be feared, than desired.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, well, niece, I will not dispute
with you. But, as I said, Montoni threat‚à£ens
me with violence, if I any longer refuse
to sign away my settlements, and this was
the subject our contest, when you came
into the room before. Now, I am deter‚à£mined
no power on earth shall make me do
this. Neither will I bear all this tamely.
He shall hear his true character from me;
I will tell him all he deserves, in spite of
his threas and cruel treatment.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily seized a pause of Madame Mon‚à£oni's
voice, to speak. ‚ÄúDear madam,‚Äù
said she, ‚Äúbut will not this serve to irri‚à£tate
<PB N="319" REF="321"/>
the Signor unnecessarily? will it not
provoke the harsh treatment you dread?‚Äù</P>
<P>"I do not care,‚Äù replied Madame Mon‚à£toni,
‚Äúit does not signify: I will not submi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>
to such usage. You would have me give
up my settlements, too, I suppose!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo, madam, I do not exactly mean
that.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat is it you do mena then?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou spoke of reproaching the Signor,‚Äù
‚Äîsaid Emily, with hesitation. ‚ÄúWhy, does
he not deserve repraoaches?‚Äù said her aunt.</P>
<P>‚ÄúCertainly he does; but will it be pru‚à£dent
in you, madam, to make them?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúPrudent!‚Äù exclaimed Madame Montoni.
‚ÄúIs this a time to talk of prudence, when
one is threatened with all sorts of violence?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is to avoid that violence, that pru‚à£dence
is necessary,‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúOf prudence!‚Äù continued Madame
Montoni, without attending to her, ‚Äúof
prudence towards a man, who does not
scruple to break all the common ties of
humanity in his conduct to me! And is it
<PB N="320" REF="322"/>
for me to consider prudence in my beha‚à£viour
towards him! I am not so mean.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is for your own sake, not for the
Signor's, madam,‚Äù said Emily modestly,
‚Äúthat you should consult prudence. Your
reproaches, however just, cannot punish
him, but they may provoke him to further
violence against you.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat! would you have me submit,
then, to whatever he commands‚Äîwould
you have me kneel down at his feet, and
thank him for his cruelties? Would you
have me give up my settlements?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow much you mistake me, ma‚à£dam!‚Äù
said Emily, ‚ÄúI am unequal to ad‚à£vise
you on a point so important as the last:
but you will pardon me for saying, that, if
you consult your own peace, you will try
to conciliate Signor Montoni, rather that
to irritate him by reproaches.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúConciliate indeed! I tell you, niece,
it is utterly impossible; I disdain to at‚à£tempt
it.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily was shocked to observe the per‚à£verted
<PB N="321" REF="323"/>
understanding and obstinate temper
of Madame Montoni; but, not less grieved
for her sufferings, she looked round for
some alleviating circumstance to offer her.
‚ÄúYour situation is, perhaps, not so despe‚à£rate,
dear madam,‚Äù said Emily, ‚Äúas you
may imagine. The Signor may represent
his affairs to be worse than they are, for the
purpose of pleading a stronger necessity for
his possession of your settlement. Besides,
so long as you keep this, you may look
forward to it as a resource, at least, that
will afford you a competence, should the
Signor's future conduct compel you to sue for separation."</P>
<P>Madame Montoni impatiently interrupt‚à£ed
her. ‚ÄúUnfeeling, cruel girl!‚Äù said she,
‚Äúand so you would persuade me, that I
have no reason to complain; that the Sig‚à£nor
is in very flourishing circumstances,
that my future prospects promise nothing
but comfort, and that my griefs are as fanci‚à£ful
and romantic as your own! Is it the
way to console me, to endeavour to per‚à£suade
<PB N="322" REF="324"/>
me out of my senses and my feelings,
because you happen to have no feelings
yoursell? I thought I was opening my
heart to a person, who could sympathize in
my distress, but I find, that your people of
sensibility can feel for nobody but them‚à£selves!
6ou may retire to your chamber."</P>
<P>Emily, without replying, immediately left
the room, with a mingled emotion of pity
and contempt, and hastened to her own,
where she yielded to the mournful reflec‚à£tions,
which a knowledge of her aunt's situa‚à£tion
had occasioned. The conversation
of the Italian with Varancourt, in France,
again occurred to her. His hints, respect‚à£ing
the broken fortunes of Montoni, were
now completely justified; those, also, con‚à£cerning
his character, appeared not less so,
though the particular circumstances, con‚à£nected
with his fame, to which the stranger
had ailuded, yet remained to be explained.
Notwithstanding, that her own observa‚à£tions
and the words of Count Morano had
convinced her, that Montoni's situation was
<PB N="323" REF="325"/>
not what it formerly appeared to be, the
intelligence she had just received from her
aunt on this point, struck her with all the
force of astonishment, which was not weak‚à£ened,
when she considered the present stlyle
of Montoni's living, the number of servants
he maintained, and the new expences he
was incurring, by repairing and fortifying
his castle. Her anxiety for her aunt and
for herself increased with reflection. Se‚à£veral
assertions of Morano, which, on the
preceding night, she had believed were
prompted either by interest, or by resent‚à£ment,
now returned to her mind with the
strenght of truth. She could not doubt,
that Montoni had formerly agreed to give
her to the Count, for a pecuniary reward;‚Äî
his character, and his distressed circum‚à£stances
justified the belief; these, also,
seemed to confirm Morano's assertion, that
he now designed to dispose of her, more ad‚à£vantageously
for himself, to a richer suitor.</P>
<P>Amidst the reproaches, which Morano
had thrown our against Montoni, he had
<PB N="324" REF="326"/>
said‚Äîhe would not quit the castle <HI>be dared
to call his,</HI> nor wiilingly leave <HI>another</HI> mur‚à£der
on his conscience‚Äîhints, which might
have no other origin than the passion of the
moment: but Emily was now inclined to
account for them more seriously, and she
shuddered to think, that she was in the
hands of a man, to whom it was even pos‚à£sible
they could applly. At length, consi‚à£dering,
that reflection could neither release
her from her melancholy situation, or ena‚à£ble
her to bear it with greater fortitude,
she tried to divert her anxiety, and took
down from her little library a volume of
her favourite Ariosto; but his wild imagery
and rich invention could not long enchant
her attention; his spells did not reach her
heart, and over her sleeping fancy they
played, without awakening it.</P>
<P>She now put aside the book, and took
her lute, for it was seldom that her suffer‚à£ings
refused to yield to the magic of sweet
sounds; when they did so, she was oppressed
by sorrow, that came from excess of tender‚à£ness
<PB N="325" REF="327"/>
and regret; and there were times,
when music had increased such sorrow
to a degree, that was scarcely endura‚à£ble;
when, if it had not suddenly ceased,
she might have lost her reason. Such
was the time, when she mourned for her
father, and heard the midnight strains,
that floated by her window near the convent
in Languedoc, on the night that followed
his death.</P>
<P>She continued to play, till Annette
brought dinner into her chamber, at which
Emily was surprised, and enquired whose
order she obeyed. ‚ÄúMy lady's ma'am‚à£selle,‚Äù
replied Annette: ‚Äúthe Signor or‚à£dered
her dinner to be carried to her own
apartment, and so she has sent you yours.
There have been sad doings between them,
worse than ever, I think.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, not appearing to notice what
she said, sat down to the little table, that
was spread for her. But Annette was not
to be silenced thus easily. While she waited,
she told of the arrival of the men, whom
<PB N="326" REF="328"/>
Emily had observed on the ramparts, and
expressed much surprise at their strange ap‚à£pearance,
as well as at the manner, in
which they had been attended by Montoni's
order. ‚ÄúDo they dine with the Signor,
then?‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo, ma'amselle, they dined long ago,
in an apartment at the north end of the cas‚à£tle,
but I know not when they are to go,
for the Signor told old Carlo to see them
provided with every thing necessary. They
have been walking all about the castle, and
asking questions of the workmen on the
ramparts. I never saw such strange-look‚à£ing
men in my life; I am frightened when‚à£ever
I see them.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily enquired, if she had heard of
Count Morano, and whether he was likely
to recover: but Annette only knew, that
he was lodged in a cottage in the wood
below, and that every body said he must die.
Emily's countenance discovered her emotion.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDear ma'amselle,‚Äù said Annette," to
see how young ladies will disguise them‚à£selves,
<PB N="327" REF="329"/>
when they are in love! I thought
you hated the Count, or I am sure I would
not have told you; and I am sure you have
cause enough to hate him.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI hope I hate nobody,‚Äù replied Emily,
trying to smile; ‚Äúbut certainly I don not
love Count Morano. I should be shocked to
hear of any person dying by violent means.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, ma'amselle, but it is his own
fault.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily looked displeased; and Annette,
mistaking the cause of her disspleasure, im‚à£mediately
began to excuse the Count, in her
way. ‚ÄúTo be sure, it was very ungenteel
behaviour,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúto break into a
lady's room, and then, when he found his
discoursing was not agreeable to her, to re‚à£fuse
to go; and then, when the gentleman
of the castle comes to desire him to walk
about his business‚Äîto turn round, and
draw his sword, and swear he'll run him
though the body!‚ÄîTo be sure it was very
ungenteel behaviour, but then he was dis‚à£guised
in love, and so did not know what
he was about.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="330"/>
‚ÄúEnough of this,‚Äù said Emily, who now
smiled without an effort; and Annette re‚à£turned
to a mention of the desagreement be‚à£tween
Montoni, and her lady. ‚ÄúIt is no‚à£thing
new,‚Äù said she: ‚Äúwe saw and heard
enough of this at Venice, though I never
told you of it, ma'amselle.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, Annette, it was very prudent of
you not to mention it then: be as prudent
now; the subject is an unpleasant one.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAh dear, ma'amselle!‚Äîto see now how
considerate you can be about some folks,
who care so little about you! I cannot
bear to see you so deceived, and I must tell
you. But it is all for your own good, and
not to spite my lady, though, to speak truth,
I have little reason to love her; but‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou are not speaking thus of my aunt,
I hope, Annette?‚Äù said Emily, gravely.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes ma'amselle, but I am, though; and
if you knew as much as I do, you would
not look so angry. I have often, and often,
heard the Signor and her talking over your
marriage with the Count, and she always
<PB N="329" REF="331"/>
advised him never to give up to your foolish
whims, as she was pleased to call them, but
to be resolute, and compel you to be obe‚à£dient,
whether you would, or no. And I
am sure, my heart has ached a thousand
times, and I have thought, when she was so
unhappy herself, she might have felt a little
for other people, and‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI thank you for your pity, Annette,‚Äù
said Emily, interrupting her: ‚Äúbut my aunt
was unhappy then, and that disturbed her
temper perhaps, or I think‚ÄîI am sure‚Äî
You may take away, Annette, I have done.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúDear, ma'amselle, you have eat nothing
at all! Do try, and take a little bit more
Disturbed her temper truly! why, her tem‚à£per
is always disturbed, I think. And at
Tholouse too I have heard my lady talking
of you and Mons. Valancourt to Madame
Merveille and Madame Vaison, often and
often, in a very ill-natured way, as I thought,
telling them what a deal of trouble she had
to keep you in order, and what a fatigue
and distress it was to her, and that she be‚à£lieved
<PB N="330" REF="332"/>
you would run away with Mons. Va‚à£lancourt,
if she was not to watch you closely;
and that you connived at his coming about
the house at night, and‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúGood God!‚Äù excalimed Emily, blush‚à£ing
deeply, ‚Äúit is surely impossible my aunt
could thus have represented me!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIndeed, ma'am, I say nothing more
than the truth, and not all of that. But I
thought, myself, she might have found some‚à£thing
better to discourse about, than the
faults of her own niece, even if you had
been in fault, ma'amselle; but I did not be‚à£lieve
a word of what she said. But my
lady does not care what she says against any
body, for that matter.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHowever that may be, Annette,‚Äù inter‚à£rupted
Emily, recovering her composure,
‚Äúit does not become you to speak of the
faults of my aunt to me. I know you have
meant well, but‚Äîsay no more.‚ÄîI have
quite dined.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette blushed, looked down, and then
began slowly to clear the table.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="333"/>
‚ÄúIs this, then, the reward of my ingenu‚à£ousness?‚Äù
said Emily, when she was alone;
‚Äúthe treatment I am to receive from a re‚à£lation
‚Äîan aunt‚Äîwho ought to have been
the guardian, not the slanderer of my repu‚à£tation,
‚Äîwho, as a woman, ought to have
respected the delicacy of female honour,
and, as a relation, should have protected
mine! But, to utter falsehoods on so nice
a subject‚Äîto repay the openness, and, I
may say with honest pride, the propriety of
my conduct, with slanders‚Äîrequired a de‚à£pravity
of heart, such as I could scarcely
have believed existed, such as I weep to
find in a relation. O! what a contrast
does her character present to that of my be‚à£loved
father; while envy and low cunning
form the chief traits of hers, his was dis‚à£tinguished
by benevolence and philosophic
wisdom! But now, let me only remember,
if possible, that she is unfortunate.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily threw her veil over her, and went
down to walk upon the ramparts, the only
walk, indeed, which was open to her,
<PB N="332" REF="334"/>
though she often wished, that she might be
permitted to ramble among the woods be‚à£low,
and still more, that she might some‚à£times
explore the sublime scenes of the sur‚à£rounding
country. But, as Montoni would
not suffer her to pass the gates of the castle,
she tried to be contented with the romantic
views she beheld from the walls. The pea‚à£sants,
who had been employed on the forti‚à£fications,
had left their work, and the ram‚à£parts
were silent and solitary. Their lonely
appearance, together with the gloom of a
lowering sky, assisted the musings of her mind,
and threw over it a kind of melancholy tranquillity,
such as she often loved to indulge. She
turned to observe a fine effect of the sun,
as his rays, suddenly straming from behind
a heavy cloud, loghted up the west towers
of the castle, while the rest of the edifice
was in deep shade, except, that, though a
lofty gothic arch, adjoining the tower, which
led to another terrace, the beams darted in
full splendour, and shewed the three strangers
she had observed in the morning. Perceiv‚à£ing
<PB N="333" REF="335"/>
them, she started, and a momentary fear
came over her, as she looked up the long
rampart, and saw no other persons. While
she hesitated, they apporoached. The gate at
the end of the terrace, whither they were
advancing, she knew, was always locked,
and she could not depart by the opposite
extremity, without meeting them; but, be‚à£fore
she passed them, she bastily drew a thin
veil over her face, which did, indeed, bu ill
conceal her beauty. They looked earnestly
at her, and spoke to each other in bad Ita‚à£lian,
of which she caught only a few words;
but the fierceness of their contenances, now
that she was near enough to discriminate
them, struck her yet more than the wild
singularity of their air and dress had for‚à£merly
done. It was the countenance and
figure of him, who walked between the other
two, that chiefly seized her attention, which
expressed a sullen haughtiness and a kind of
dark watchful villany, that gave a thrill of
horror to her heart. All this was so legibly
written on his features, as to be seen by a
<PB N="334" REF="336"/>
ssingle glance, for she passed the group
swiftly, and her timid eyes scarcely rested
on them a moment. Having reached the
terrace, she stopped, and perceived the
strangers standing in the shadow of one of
the turrets, gazing after her, and seemingly,
by their action, in earnest conversation. She
immediately left the rampart, and retired to
her apartment.</P>
<P>In the evening, Montoni sat late, carous‚à£ing
with his guests in the cedar chamber.
His recent triumph over Count Morano, or,
perhaps, some other circumstance, contri‚à£buted
to elevate his spirits to an unusual
height. He filled the goblet often, and
gave a loose to merriment and talk. The
gaiety of Cavigni, on the contrary, was
somewhat clouded by anxiety. He kept
a watchful eye upon Verezzi, whom, with
the utmost difficulty, he had hitherto re‚à£strained
from exasperating Montoni further
against Morano, by a mention of his late
taunting words.</P>
<P>One of the company exultingly recurred
<PB N="335" REF="337"/>
to the event of the preceding evening. Ve‚à£rezzi's
eyes sparkled. The mention of Mo‚à£rano
led to that of Emily, of whom they
were all profuse in teh praise, except Mon‚à£toni,
who sat silent, and then interrupted the
subject.</P>
<P>When the servants had withdrawn, Mon‚à£toni
and his friends entered into close con‚à£versation,
which was sometimes checked by
the irascible temper of Verezzi, but in
which Montoni displayed his conscious su‚à£periority,
by that decisive look and manner,
which always accompanied the vigour of
his thought, and to which most of his com‚à£panions
submitted, as to a power, that they
had no right to question, though of each
other's self-importance they were jealously
serupulous. A midst this conversation, one of
them imprudently introduced again she name
of Morano;and Verezzi, now more heated
by wine, disregarded the expressive looks of
Cavigni, and gave some dark hints of what
had passed on the preceding night. These,
however, Montoni did not appear to under‚à£stand,
<PB N="336" REF="338"/>
for he continued silent in his chair,
without discovering any emotion, while, the
choier<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/> Verezzi increasing with the appa‚à£rent
insentibility Montoni, he at length
told the suggestion of Morano, that this
castle did not lawfully belong to him, and
that he would not wilingly leave another
murder on his consciences.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAm I to be insulted at my own table,
and by my own friends?‚Äù said Montoni,
with a coutenance pale in anger. ‚ÄúWhy
are the words of that madman repeated to
me?‚Äù Verezzi, who had expected to hear
Montoni's indignation poured forth against
Morano, and answered by thanks to himself,
looked with astonishment at Cavigni, who
enjoyed his confusion. ‚ÄúCan you be weak
enough to credit the assertions of a mad‚à£man?‚Äù
rejoined Montoni, ‚Äúor what is the
same thing, a man possessed by the sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>rit
of vengeance? But he has succeeded too
well; you believe what he said.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúSignor,‚Äù said Verezzi, ‚Äúwe believe
only what we know.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúHow!‚Äù inter‚à£rupted
<PB N="337" REF="339"/>
Montoni, sternly: ‚Äúproduce your
proof.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWe believe only what we know,‚Äù
repeated Verezzi, ‚Äúand we know nothing
of what Morano afferts.‚Äù Montoni seem‚à£ed
to recover himself. ‚ÄúI am has<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>y,
my friends,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúwith respect to
my honour; no man shall question it
with impunity‚Äîyou did not mean to
question it. These foolish words are not
worth your remembrance, or my resent‚à£ment.
Verezzi, here is to your first ex‚à£ploit.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúSuccess to your first exploit,‚Äù re echoed
the whole company.</P>
<P>‚ÄúNoble Signor,‚Äù replied Verezzi, glad
to find he had eseaped Montoni's resent‚à£ment,
‚Äúwith my good will, you shall build
your ramparts of gold.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúPass the goblet,‚Äù cried Montoni. ‚ÄúWe
will drink to Signora St. Aubert,‚Äù said
Cavigni. ‚ÄúBy your leave, we will sirst drink
to the lady of the castle,‚Äù said Ber<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>olini.‚Äî
Montoni was silent. ‚ÄúTo the lady of the
<PB N="338" REF="340"/>
castle,‚Äù said his guests. He bowed his
head.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI much surprises me, Signor,‚Äù said
Bertoliei, ‚Äúthat you have so long neglected
this castle;it is a noble edifice.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt suits our purpose,‚Äù replied Montoni,
‚Äúand <HI>is</HI> a noble edifice. You know not, it
seems, by what mischance it came to me.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt was a lucky mischance, be it what it
may, Signor,‚Äù replied Bertolini, smiling.
‚ÄúI would, that one so lucky had befallen
me.‚Äù</P>
<P>Montoni looked gravely at him. ‚ÄúIf
you will attend to what I say,‚Äù he resumed,
‚Äúyou shall hear the story.‚Äù</P>
<P>The countenances of Bertolini and Ve‚à£rezzi
expressed something more than curio‚à£sity;
Cavigni, who seemed to feel none, had
probably heard te relation before.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is now near twenty years,‚Äù said
Montoni, ‚Äúsince this castle came into my
possession. I inherit it by the female line.
The lady, my predecessor, was only distantly
related to me; I am the last of her family.
<PB N="339" REF="341"/>
She was beautiful and rich; I wooed her;
but her heart was fixed upon another, and
she rejected me. It is probable, however,
that she was herself rejected of the per‚à£son,
whoever he might be, on whom
she bestowed her favour, for a deep and
settled melancholy took possession of her;
and I have reason to believe she put a pe‚à£riod
to her own life. I was not at the castle
at the time; but, as there are some singular
and mysterious circumstances attending that
event, I shall repeat them.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúRepeat them.‚Äù said a voice.</P>
<P>Montoni was silent; the quests looked
at each other, to know who fpoke; but
they perceived, that each was making the
same enquiry. Montoni at length, recover‚à£ing
himself, ‚ÄúWe are overheard,‚Äù said he:
‚Äúwe will finish this subject another time.
Pafs the goblet.‚Äù</P>
<P>The cavaliers looked round the wide chamber.</P>
<P>‚ÄúHere is no person, but ourselves,;; said
Verezzi: ‚Äúpray, Signor, proceed.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="342"/>
‚ÄúDid you hear any thing?‚Äù said Mon‚à£toni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWe did,‚Äù said Bertolini.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt could be only fancy,‚Äù said Verezzi,
looking round again. ‚ÄúWe see no person
besides ourselves; and the sound I thought
I heard seemed within the room. Pray, Sig‚à£nor,
go on‚Äù</P>
<P>Montoni paused a moment, and then pro‚à£ceeded
in a lowered voice, while the cava‚à£liers
drew nearer to attend.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYe are to know, Signors, that the Lady
Laurentini had for some months shewn
symptoms of a dejected mind, nay, of a
distrubed imagination. Her mood was very
unequal; sometimes she was sunk in calm
melancholy, and, at others, as I have been
told, she betrayed all the symptoms of fran‚à£tic
madness. It was one night in the month
of October, after she had recovered from
one of those fits of excess, and had sunk again
into her usual melancholy, that she retired
alone to her chamber, and forbade all inter‚à£ruption.
It was the chamber at the end of
<PB N="341" REF="343"/>
the corridor, Signors, where we had the
affray, last night. From that hour, she was
seen no more.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow! seen no more!‚Äù said Bertolini,
‚Äúwas not her body found in the cham‚à£ber?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWere her remains never found?‚Äù cried
the rest of the company all together.</P>
<P>‚ÄúNever!‚Äù replied Montoni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat reasons were there to suppose
she destroyed herself, then?‚Äù said Bertolini.
‚Äî‚ÄúAye, what reasons?‚Äù said Verezzi.‚Äî
‚ÄúHow happened it, that her remains were
never found? Although she killed herself,
she could not bury herself.‚Äù Montoni
looked indignantly at Verezzi, who began
to apologize. ‚ÄúYour pardon, Signor,‚Äù
said he: ‚ÄúI did not consider, that the lady
was your relative, when I spoke of her so
lightly.‚Äù</P>
<P>Montoni accepted the apololgy.</P>
<P>‚ÄúBut the Signor will oblige us with the
reasons, which urged him to believe, that
the lady committed suicide.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="344"/>
‚ÄúThose I will explain herafter,‚Äù said
Montoni: ‚Äúat present let me relate a most
extraordinary circumstance. This conver‚à£sation
goes no further, Signors. Listen,
then, to what I am going to say.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúListen!‚Äù said a voice.</P>
<P>They were all again silent, and the coun‚à£tenance
of Montoni changed. ‚ÄúThis is no
illusion of the fancy,‚Äù said Cavigni, at
length breaking the profound selence.‚Äî
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Bertolini; ‚ÄúI heard it myself,
now. Yet here is no person in the room
but ourselves!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThis is very extraordinary,‚Äù said Mon‚à£toni,
suddenly rising. ‚ÄúThis is not to be
borne; here is some deception, some trick.
I will know what it means.‚Äù</P>
<P>All the company rose from their chairs
in consution.</P>
<P>‚Äúit is very odd!‚Äù said Bertolini.
‚ÄúHere is really no stranger in the room.
If it is a trick, Signor, you will do well to
punish the author of it severely.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="345"/>
‚ÄúA trick! what else can it be?‚Äù said
Cavigni, affecting a laugh.</P>
<P>The servants were now summoned, and
the chamber was searched, but no per‚à£son
was found. The surprise and conster‚à£nation
of the company increased. Montoni
was discomposed. ‚ÄúWe will leave this
room,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúand the subject of our
conversation also; it is too solemn.‚Äù His
guests were equally ready to quit the apart‚à£ment;
but the subject had roused their cu‚à£riosity,
they entreated Montoni to with‚à£draw
to another chamber, and finish it; no
entreaties could, however, prevail with him.
Notwithstanding his efforts to appear at ease,
he was visibly and greatly disordered.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy, Signor, you are not supersti‚à£tious,‚Äù
cried Verezzi, jeeringly; ‚Äúyou,
who have so o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>ten laughed at the credulity
of others!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI am not superstitious,‚Äù replied Mon‚à£toni,
regarding him with stern displeasure,
‚Äúthough I know how to despise the com‚à£mon
place sentences, which are frequently
<PB N="344" REF="346"/>
uttered against superstition. I will enquire
further into this affair' He then left the
room; and his guests, separating for the
night, retired to their respective apart‚à£ments.</P>

<P>WE now return to Valancourt, who, it
may be remembered, remained at Tholouse,
some time after the departure of Emily,
restless and miserable. Each morrow, that
apporached, he designed should carry him
from thence; yet to-morrow and to-morrow
came, and still saw him lingering in the
scene of his former happiness. He could
not immediately tear himself from the spot,
where he had been accustomed to converse
with Emily, or from the objects they had
viewed together, which appeared to him
memorials of her affection, as well as a
kind of surety for its faithfulness; and, next
to the pain of bidding her adieu, was that
of leaving the scenes, which so powerfully
awakened her image. Sometimes he had
<PB N="346" REF="348"/>
bribed a servant, who had been left in the
care of Madame Montoni's chateau, to per‚à£mit
him to visit the gardens, and there he
would wander, for hours together, rapt
in a melancholy, not unpleasing. The ter‚à£race,
and the pavilion at the end of it, where
he had taken leave of Emily, on the eve
of her departure from Tholouse, were his
most favourite haunts. There, as he walk‚à£ed,
or leaned from the window of the build‚à£ing,
he would endeavour to recollect all she
had said, on that night; to catch the tones
of her voice, as they faintly vibrated on his
memory, and to remember the exact ex‚à£pression
of her countenance, which some‚à£times
came suddenly to his fancy, like a
vision; that beautiful countenance, which
awakened, as by instantaneous magic, all
the tenderness of his heart, and seemed to
cell with irresislible eloquence‚Äîthat he had
loft her forever! At these moments, his
hurried steps would have discovered to a
spectator the despair of his heart. The
character of Montoni, such as he had re‚à£ceived
<PB N="347" REF="349"/>
from hints, and such as his fears re‚à£presented
it, would rise to his view, to‚à£gether
with all the dangers it seemed to
threaten to Emily and to his love. He
blamed himself, that he had not urged these
more forcibly to her, while it might have
been in his power to detain her, and that
he had suffered an abusurd and criminal de‚à£licacy,
as he termed it, to conquer so soon
the reasonable arguments he had opposed
to this journey. Any evil, that might have
attended their marriage, seemed so inferior
to those, which now threatened their love,
or even to the sufferings, that absence oc‚à£casioned,
that he wondered how he could
have ceased to urge his suit, till he had
convinced her of its propriety; and he
would certainly now have followed her to
Italy, if he could have been spared from
his regiment for so long a journey. His
regiment, indeed, soon reminded him, that
he had other duties to attend, than those of
love.</P>
<P>A short time after his arrival at his bro‚à£ther's
<PB N="348" REF="350"/>
house, he was summoned to join his
brother officers, and he accompanied a bat‚à£talion
to Paris; where a scene of novelty
and ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>ety opened upon him, such as, till
then, he had only a faint idea of. But gai‚à£ety
disgusted, and company fatigued, his
sick mind; and he became an object of un‚à£ceasing
raillery to his companions, from
whom, whenever he could steal an oppor‚à£tunity,
he escaped, to think of Emily. The
scenes around him, however, and the com‚à£pany
with whom he was obliged to mingle,
engaged his attention, though they failed
to amuse his fancy, and thus gradually
weakened the habit of yielding to lamen‚à£tation,
till it appeared less a duty to his
love to indulge it. Among his brother‚à£officers
were many, who added to the or‚à£dinary
character of French soldier's gai‚à£ety
some of those fascinating qualities,
which too frequently throw a veil over fol‚à£ly,
and sometimes even soften the features
of vice into smiles. To these men the re‚à£served
and thoughtful manners of Valan‚à£court
<PB N="349" REF="351"/>
were a kind of tacit censure on their
own, for which they rallied him when pre‚à£sent,
and plotted against him when absent;
they gloried in the thought of reducing him
to their own level, and, considering it to
be a spirited frolic, determined to accom‚à£plish
it.</P>
<P>Valancourt was a stranger to the gradual
progress of scheme and intrigue, against
which he could not be on his guard. He
had not been accustomed to receive ridi‚à£cule,
and he could ill endure its sting; he
resented it, and this only drew upon him a
louder laugh. To escape from such scenes,
he fled into solitude, and there the image
of Emily met him, and revived the pangs
of love and despair. He then southt to
renew those tasteful studies, which had been
the delight of his early years; but his mind
had lost the tranquillity, which is necessary
for their enjoyment. To forget himself
and the grief and anxiety, which the idea
of her recalled, he would quit his solitude,
and again mingle in the crowd‚Äîglad of a
<PB N="350" REF="352"/>
temporary relief, and rejoicing to snatch
amusement for the moment.</P>
<P>Thus passed weeks after weeks, time
gradually softening his sorrow, and habit
strengthening his desire of amusement till
the scenes around him seemed to awaken
into a new character, and Valancourt, to
have fallen among them from the clouds.</P>
<P>His figure and address made him a wel‚à£come
visitor, wherever he had been intro‚à£duced,
and he soon frequented the most gay
and fashionable circles of Paris. Among
these, was the assembly of the Countess La‚à£cleur,
a woman of eminent beauty and cap‚à£tivating
manners. She had passed the spring
of youth, but her wit prolonged the triumph
of its reign, and they mutually assisted the
same of each other; for those, who were
charmed by her loveliness, spoke with en‚à£thusiasm
of her talents; and others, who
admired her playful imagination, declared,
that her personal graces were unrivalled.
But her imagination was merely playful,
and her wit, if such it could be called, was
<PB N="351" REF="353"/>
brilliant, rather than just; it dazzled, and
its fallacy escaped the detection of the mo‚à£ment;
for the accents, in which she pro‚à£nounced
it, and the smile, accompa‚à£nied
them, were a spell upon the judg‚à£ment
of the auditors. Her petits soupers
were the most tasteful of any in Paris, and
were frequented by many of the second class
of literati. She was fond of music, was
herself a scientific performer, and had fre‚à£quently
concerts at her house. Valancourt,
who passionately loved music, and who
sometimes assisted at these concerts, ad‚à£mired
her execution, but remembered with
a sigh the eloquent simplicity of Emily's
songs and the natural expression of her
manner, which waited not to be approved
by the judgment, but found their way at
once to the heart.</P>
<P>Madame La Comtesse had often deep play
at her house, which she affected to restrain,
but secretly encouraged; and it was well
known among her friends, that the splen‚à£dour
of her establishment was chiefly sup‚à£plied
<PB N="352" REF="354"/>
from the profits of her tables. But
her petits soupers were the most charming
imaginable! Here were all the delicacies of
the four quarters of the world, all the wit and
the lighter efforts of genius, all the graces of
conversation‚Äîthe smiles of beauty, and the
charms of music; and Valancou rt passed
his pleasantest, as well as most dangerous
hours in these parties.</P>
<P>His brother, who remained with his fa‚à£mily
in Gascony, had contented himself
with giving him letters of introduction to
such of his relations, residing at Paris, as
the latter was not already known to.
All these were persons of some distinction;
and, as neither the person, mind, or man‚à£ners
of Valancourt the younger threatened
to disgrace their alliance, they received him
with as much kindness as their nature, har‚à£dened
by uninterrupted prosperity, would
admit of; but their attentions did not ex‚à£tend
to acts of real friendship; for they were
too much occupied by their own pursuits,
to feel any interst in his; and thus he was
<PB N="353" REF="355"/>
set down in the midst of Paris, in the pride
of youth, with an open, unsuspicious tem‚à£perand
ardent affections, without one
friend, to warn him of the dangers, to which
he was exposed. Emily, who, had she
been present, would have saved him from
these evils by awakening his heart, and en‚à£gaging
him in worthy pursuits, now only
increased his danger;‚Äîit was to lose the
grief, which the remembrance of her occa‚à£sioned,
that he first sought amusement; and
for this end he pursued it, till habit made it
an object of abstract interest.</P>
<P>There was also a Marchioness Champfort,
a young widow, at whose assemblies he passed
much of his time. She was handsome, still
more artful, gay and fond of intrigue. The
society, which she drew round her, was
less elegant and more vicious, than that
of the Countess Lacleur: but, as she had
address enough to throw a veil, though
but a slight one, over the worst parts of her
character, she was still visited by many per‚à£sons
of what is called distinction. Valan‚à£court
<PB N="354" REF="356"/>
was introduced to her parties by two
of his brother officers, whose late ridicule
he had now forgiven so far, that he could
sometimes join in the laugh, which a men‚à£tion
of his former manners would renew.</P>
<P>The gaiety of the most splendid court in
Europe, the magnificence of the palaces,
entertainments, and equipages, that sur‚à£rounded
him‚Äîall conspired to dazzle his
imagination, and re-animate his spirits, and
the example and maxims of his military as‚à£sociates
to delude his mind. Emily's image,
indeed, still lived there; but it was no longer
the friend. the monitor, that saved him
from himself, and to which he retiredto
weep the sweet, yet melancholy, tears of
tenderness. When he had recourse to it, it
assumed a countenance of mild reproach,
that wrung his soul, and called forth tears
of unmixed misery; his only escape from
which was to forget the object of it, and
he endeavoured, therefore, to think of
Emily as seldom as he could.</P>
<P>Thus dangerously circumstanced was Va‚à£lancourt,
<PB N="355" REF="357"/>
at the time, when Emily was suf‚à£fering
at Venice, from the persecuting ad‚à£dresses
of Count Morano, and the unjust
authority of Montoni; at which period we
leave him.</P>

<BIBL>KING JOHN.</BIBL></Q>
<P>LEAVING the gay scenes of Paris, we
return to those of the gloomy Apennine,
where Emily's thoughts were still faithful
to Valancourt. Looking to him as to her
only hope, she recollected with jealous ex‚à£actness,
every assurance and every proof she
had withnessed of his affection; read again
and again the letters she had received from
him; weighed, with intense anxiety, the
force of every word, that spoke of his attach‚à£ment;
and dried her tears, as she trusted in
his truth.</P>
<P>Montoni, meanwhile, had made strict en‚à£quiry,
concerning the starange circumstance
of his alarm, without obtaining information;
and was,d at length, obliged to account for
<PB N="357" REF="359"/>
it by the resonable supposition, that it was
a mischievous trick played off by one of his
domestics. His disgreements with Ma‚à£dame
Montoni, on the subject of her set‚à£tlements,
were now more frequent than ever;
he even confined her entirely to her own
apartment, and did not scruple to threaten
her with much greater severity, should she
persevere in a refusal.</P>
<P>Reason, had she consulted it, would now
have perplexed her in the choice of a con‚à£duct
to be adopted. It would have pointed
out the danger of irritating by further op‚à£position
a man, such as Montoni had proved
himself to be, and to whose power she had
so entirely committed herself; and it would
also have told her, of what extreme import‚à£ance
to her future comfort it was, to reserve
for herself those possessions, which would
enable her to live independently of Mon‚à£toni,
should she ever escape from his imme‚à£diate
controul. But she was directed by a
more decisve guide than reason‚Äîthe spi‚à£rit
of revenge, which urged her to oppose
<PB N="358" REF="360"/>
violence to violence, and obstinacy to obsti‚à£nacy.</P>
<P>Wholly confined to the solitude of her
apartment, she was now reduced to solicit the
society she so lately rejected; for Emily
was the only person, except Annette, with
whom she was permitted to converse.
Generously anxious for her peace, Emily,
therefore, tried to persuade, when she could
not convince, and sought by every gentle
means to induce her to forbear that aspe‚à£rity
of reply, which so greatly irritated Mon‚à£toni.
The pride of her aunt did sometimes
soften to the soothing voice of Emily, and
there even were moments, when she re‚à£graded
her affectionate attentions with good‚à£will.</P>
<P>The scenes of terrible contention, to
which Emily was frequently compelled to
be witness, exhausted her spirits more than
any circumstances, that had occurred since
her departure from Tholouse. The gentle‚à£ness
and goodness of her parents, together
with the scenes of her early happiness, often
<PB N="359" REF="361"/>
stole on her mind, like the visions of a
higher world; while the characters and cir‚à£cumstances,
now passing beneath her eye,
excited both terror and surprise. She could
scarcely have imagined, that passions so
fierce and so various, as those which Mon‚à£toni
exhibited, could have been concen‚à£trated
in one individual; yet what more
surprised her, was, that, on great occasions,
he could bend these passions, wild as they
were, to the cause of his interest, and gene‚à£rally
could disguise in his countenance their
operation on his mind; but she had seen
him too often, when he had thought it un‚à£necessary
to conceal his nature, to be de‚à£ceived
on such occasions.</P>
<P>Her present life appeared like the dream
of a distempered imagination, or like one
of those frightful fictions, in which the
wild genius of the poets sometimes de‚à£lighted.
Reflection brought only regret,
and anticipation terror. How often did she
wish to ‚Äústeal the lark's wing, and mount
le swiftest gale,‚Äù that Languedoc and re‚à£pose
might once more be hers!</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="362"/>
Of Count Morano's health she made fre‚à£quent
enquiry; but Annette heard only
vague reports of his danger, and that his
surgeon had said he would never leave the
cottage alive; while Emily could not but be
shocked to think, that she, however inno‚à£cently,
might be the means of his death;
and Annette, who did not fail to observe
her emotion, interpreted it in her own way.</P>
<P>But a circumstance soon occurred which
entirely withdrew Annette's attention from
this subject, and awakened the surprise and
curiosity so natural to her. Coming one
day to Emily's apartment, with a counte‚à£nance
full of importance, ‚ÄúWhat can all
this mean, ma'amselle?‚Äù said she. ‚ÄúWould
I was once safe in Languedoc again, they
should never catch me going on my travels
any more! I must think it a fine thing,
truly, to come abroad, and see foreign parts!
I little thought I was coming to be catched
up in an old castle, among such dreary
mountains, with the chance of being mur‚à£dered,
or, what is as good, having my
throat cut!‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="363"/>
‚ÄúWhat can all this mean, indeed, An‚à£nette?‚Äù
said Emily, in astonishment.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAye, ma'amselle, you may look sur‚à£prised;
but you won't believe it, perhaps,
till they have murdered you, too. You
would not believe about the ghost I told
you of, though I shewed you the very place,
where it used to appear!‚ÄîYou will believe
nothing, ma'amselle.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNot till you speak more reasonably,
Annette; for Heaven's sake, explain your
meaning. You spoke of murder!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAye, ma'amselle, they are coming to
murder us all, perhaps; but what signifies
explaining?‚Äîyou will not believe.‚Äù
Emily again desired her to relate what
she had seen, or heard.</P>
<P>‚ÄúO, I have seen enough, ma'am, and
heard too much, as Ludovico can prove.
poor soul! they will murder him, too!
I little thought, when he sung those sweet
verses under my lattice, at Venice!‚Äù‚ÄîEmily
looked impatient and displeased. ‚ÄúWell,
ma'amselle, as I was saying, these prepara‚à£tions
<PB N="362" REF="364"/>
about the castle, and these strange‚à£looking
people, that are calling here every
day, and the Signor's cruel usage of my
lady, and his odd goings on‚Äîall these, as I
told Ludovico, can bode no good. And he
bid me hold my tongue. So, says I, the
Signor's strangely altered, Ludovico, in this
gloomy castle, to what he was in France;
there, all so gay! Nobody so gallant to
my lady, the; and he could smile, too,
upon a poor servant, sometimes, and jeer
her, too, good-naturedly enough. I re‚à£member
once, when he said to me, as I was
going out of my lady's dressing-room‚ÄîAn‚à£nette,
says he‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNever mind what the Signor said,‚Äù in‚à£terrupted
Emily; ‚Äúbut tell me, at once, the
circumstance, which has thus alarmed you.‚Äù
"Aye, ma'amselle," rejoined Annette,
"that is just what Ludovico said: says he,
Never mind what the Signor says to you.
So I told him what I thought about the
Signor. He is so strangely altered, said I:
for now he is so haughty, ans so command‚à£ing,
<PB N="363" REF="365"/>
and so sharp with my lady; and, if he
meets one, he'll scarcely look at one, unless
it be to frown. So much the better, says
Ludovico, so much the better. And to
tell you the truth, ma'amselle, i thought
this was a very ill-natured speech of Ludo‚à£vico
but I went on. And then, says I,
he is always knitting his brows; and if one
speaks to him, he does not hear; and then
he sits up counselling so, of a nioght, with
the other signors‚Äîthere they are, till long
past midnight, discoursing together! Aye,
but says Ludovico, you don't know what
they are counselling about. No, said I,
but I can guess‚Äîit is about my young
lady. Upon that, Ludovico burst out
a-laughing, quite loud; so he put me
in a huff, for i did not like that either I, or
you, ma'amselle, should be laughed at; and
I turned away quick, but he stopped me.
Don't be affronted, Annette,' said he,
but I cannot help laughing;' and with
that he laughed again. 'What!' says he,
do you think the Signors sit up, night
<PB N="364" REF="366"/>
after night, only to counsel about thy you ng
lady! No, no, there is something more in
the wind than that. And these repairs
about the castle, and these preparations
about the ramparts‚Äîthey are not making
about young ladies. Why surely, said I,
the Signor, my master, is not going to
make war? 'Make war!' said Ludovico,
'what, upon the mountains and the woods?
for here is no living soul to make war upon,
that I see.'</P>
<P>"What are these preparations for, then?
said I; why surely nobody is coming to
take away my master's castle! 'Then there
are so many ill-looking fellows coming to
the castle every day,' says Ludovico, with‚à£out
answering my question, 'and the Sig‚à£nor
sees them allo, and talks with them all,
and they all stay in the neighbourhood!
By holy st. Marco! some of them are the
most cut-throat-looking dogs I ever set my
eyes upon.'</P>
<P>"I asked Ludovico again, if he thought
they were coming to take away my master's
<PB N="365" REF="367"/>
castle; and he said, No, he did not think
they were, but he did not know for certain.
'Then, yesterday,' said he, but you must
not tell this, ma'amselle, 'yesterday, a party
of these men came, and left all their horses
in the castle stables, where, it seems, they
are to stay, for the Signor ordered them all
to be entertained with the best provender in
the manger; but the men are, most of them,
in the neighbouring cottages.'</P>
<P>"So, ma'amselle, I came to tell you all
this, for I never heard any ting so strange
in my life. But what can these ill-looking
nen be come about, if it is not to murder
us? And the Signor knows this, or why
should he be so civil to them? And why
should he fortify the castle, and counsel so
much with the other Signors, and be so
thoughtful?"</P>
<P>"Is this all you have to tell, Annette?"
faid Emily. ‚ÄúHave you heard nothing else,
that alarms you?"</P>
<P>‚ÄúNothing else, ma'amselle!" said An‚à£nette;
"why, is not this enough?" ‚ÄúQuite
<PB N="366" REF="368"/>
enough for my patience, Annette, but not
quite enough to convince me we are all to be
murdered, though I acknowledge here is
sufficient food for curiosity. She forbore
to speak her apprehensions, because she
would not encourage Annette's wild terrors;
but the present circumstances of the castle
both surprised, and alarmed her. An‚à£nette,
having told her tale, left the cham‚à£ber,
on the wing for new wonders.</P>
<P>In the evening, Emily had passed sone
melancholy hours with Madame Montoni,
and was retiring to rest, when she was
alarmed by a strange and loud knocking
at her chamber door, and then a heavy
weight fell against it, that almost burst it
open. She called to know who was there,
and receiving no answer, repeated the call;
but a chilling silence followed. It occur‚à£red
to her‚Äîfor, at this moment, she could
not reason on the probability of circum‚à£stances
‚Äîthat some one of the strangers,
lately arrived at the castle, had discovered
her apartment, and was come with such
<PB N="367" REF="369"/>
intent, as their looks rendered too possible‚Äî
to rob, perhaps to murder, her. The mo‚à£ment
she admitted this possibility, terror
supplied the place of conviction, and a
kind of instinctive remembrance of her re‚à£mote
situation from the family heightened
it to a degree, that almost overcame her
senses. She looked at the door, which led
to the stair-case, expecting to see it open,
and listening, in fearful silence, for a re‚à£turn
of the noise, till she began to think it
had proceeded from this door, and a wish of
escaping through the opposite one rushed
upon her mind. She went to the galllery
door, and then, fearing to open it, lest
some person might be silently lurking for
her without, she sthopped, but with her eyes
fixed in expectation upon the opposite door
of the stair-case. As thus she stood, she heard
a faint breathing near her, and became con‚à£vinced,
that some person was on the other
side of the door, which was already locked.
She sought for other fastening, but there
was none.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="370"/>
While she yet listened, the breathing was
distinctly heard, and her terror was not
soothed, when, looking round her wide and
lonely chamber, she again considered her
remote situation. As she stood hesitating
whether to call for assistance, the continu‚à£ance
of the stillness surprised her; and her
spiritrs would have revived, had she not con‚à£tinued
to hear the faint breathing, that con‚à£vinced
her, the person, whoever it was, had
not quitted the door.</P>
<P>At length, worn out with anxiety, she
determined to call loudly for assistance
from her casement, and was advancing to
it, when, whether the terror of her mind
gave her idea sounds, or that real ones did
come, she thought footsteps were ascending
the private stair case; and, expecting to see
its door unclose she forgot all other cause
of alarm, and retreated towards the corri‚à£dor.
Here she endeavoured to make her
escape, but, on opening the door, was very
near falling over a person, who lay on the
floor without. She screamed, and would
<PB N="369" REF="371"/>
have passed, but her trembling frame re‚à£fused
to support her; and the moment, in
which she leaned against the wall of the
gallery, allowed her liesure to observe the
figure before her, and to recognise the fea‚à£tures
of Annette. Fear instantly yielded to
surprise. She spoke in vain to the poor
girl, who remained senseless on the floor,
and then, losing all consciousness of ther own
weakness, hurried to her assistance.</P>
<P>When Annette recovered, she was helped
by Emily into the chamber, but was still
unable to speak, and looked round her, as
if her eyes followed some person in the
room. Emily tried to sooth her disturbed
spirits, and forbore, at present, to ask her
any questions; but the faculty of speech
was never long with-held from Annette,
and she explained, in broken sentences, and
in her tedious way, the occasion of her dis‚à£order.
She Affirmed, and with a solem‚à£nity
of conviction, that almost staggered
the incredulity of Emily, that she had seen
<PB N="370" REF="372"/>
an apparition, as she was passing to her bed‚à£room,
through the corridor.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI had heard strange stories of that
chamber before,‚Äù said Annette: ‚Äúbut as it
was so near yours, ma'amselle, I would not
tell them to you, because they would fright‚à£en
you. the sevants had told me, often
and often, that it was haunted, and that
was the reason why it was shut up: nay, for
that matter, why the whole string of these
rooms, here, are shut up. I quaked when‚à£ever
I Went by, and I must say, I did some‚à£times
think I heard odd noises within it.
But, as I said, as I was passing along the
corridor, and not thinking a word about the
matter, or even of the stranger voice that
the Signors heard the other night, all of a
sudden comes a great light, and, looking
behind me, there was a tall figure, (I saw it
as plainly, ma'amselle, as I see you at this
moment) a tall figure gliding along (Oh! I
cannot describe how!) into the room that
is always shut up, and nobody has the key
<PB N="371" REF="373"/>
of it but the Signor, and the door shut di‚à£rectly.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThen it doubtless was the Signor,‚Äù
said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúO no, ma'am,selle, it could not be him,
for I left him busy a-quarrelling in my lady's
dressing-room!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou bring me strange tales, Annette,‚Äù
said Emily: ‚Äúit was but this morning,
that you would have terrified me with the
apprehension of murder; and now you
would persuade me, you have seen a ghost!
These wonderful stories come too quickly.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNay, ma'amselle, I will say no more,
only, if I had not ben frightened, I sholuld
not have fainted dead away, so. I ran as fast
as I could, to get to your door; but, what
was worst of all, i could not call out; then
I thought something must be starangely the
matter with me, and directly I dropt down.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWas it the chamber where the black
veil hangs?‚Äù said Emily. ‚ÄúO! no, ma'am‚à£selle,
it was one nearer to this. What shall
I do, to get to my room? I would not go
<PB N="372" REF="374"/>
out into the corridor again, for the whole
world!‚Äù Emily, whose spirits had been
severely shocked, and who, therefore, did
not like the thought of passing the night
alone, thold her she might sleep where she
was. ‚ÄúO, no, ma'amselle,‚Äù replied An‚à£nette,
‚ÄúI would not sliip in the room,
now, for a thosand sequins!‚Äù</P>
<P>Wearied and disappointed, Emily first
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>idiculed, though she shared, her fears, and
then tried to sooth them; but neither at‚à£tempt
succeeded, and the girl persisted in
believing and affirming, that what she had
seen was nothing human. It was not till
some time after Emily had recovered her
composure, that she recollected the steps she
had heard on the stair-case‚Äîa remembrance,
however, which made her insist that An‚à£nette
should pass the night with her, and,
with much difficulty, she, at length, pre‚à£vailed,
assisted by that part of the girl's
fear, which concerned the corridor.</P>
<P>Early on the following morning, as
Emily crossed the hall to the ramparts, she
<PB N="373" REF="375"/>
heard a noisy bustle in the court-yard, and
the clatter of horses' hoofs. such unusual
sounds excited her curiosity; and, instead of
going to the ramparts, she went to an
upper casement, from whence she saw, in
the court below, a large party of horse‚à£men,
dressed in a singular, but uniform,
habit, and completely, though variously,
armed. They wore a kind of short jacket,
composed of black and scarlet, and several
of them had a cloak, of plain black, which,
covering the person entirely, hung down to
the stirrups. As one of these cloaks glanced
aside, she saw, beneath, daggers, apparently
of different sizes, tucked into the horse‚à£man's
belt. She further observed, that
these were carried, in the same manner, by
many of the horsemen without cloaks, most
of whom bore also pikes, or javelins. On
their heads, were the small Italian caps,
some of which were distinguished by black
feathers. Whether these caps gave a fierce
air to the countenance, or that the counte‚à£nances
they surmounted had naturally such
<PB N="374" REF="376"/>
an appearance, Emily thought she had
never, till then, seen an assemblage of faces
so savage and terrific. While she gazed,
she almost fancied herself surrounded by
banditti; and a vague thought glanced
athwart her fancy‚Äîthat Montoni was the
captain of the group before her, and that
this castle was to be the place of rendez‚à£vous.
The strange and horrible supposition
was but momentary, though her reason
could supply none more probable, and
though she discovered, among the band,
the strangers she had formerly noticed with
so much alarm, who were now distinguished
by the black plume.</P>
<P>While she continued gazing, Cavigni,
Verezzi, and Bertolini came forth from the
hall, habited like the rest, except that they
wore hats, with a mixed plume of black and
scarlet, and that their arms differed from
those of the rest of the party. As they
mounted their horses, Emily was struck
with the exulting joy, expressed on the vi‚à£sage
of Verezzi, while Cavigni was gay, yet
<PB N="375" REF="377"/>
with a shade of thought on his countenance;
and, as he managed his horse with dexterity,
his graceful and commanding figure, which
exhibited the majesty of a hero, had never
appeared to more advantage. Emily, as
she observed him, thought he somewhat re‚à£sembled
Valancourt, in the spirit and dignity
of his person; but she looked in vain for the
noble, benevolent countenance‚Äîthe soul's
intelligence, which overspread the features
of the latter.</P>
<P>As she was hoping, she scarcely knew
why, that Montoni would accompany the
party, he appeared at the hall door, but un‚à£accoutred.
Having carefully observed the
horsemen, conversed awhile with the cava‚à£liers,
and bidden them farewel, the band
wheeled round the court, and, led by Ve‚à£rezzi,
issued forth under the portcullis;
Montoni following to the portal, and gazing
after them for some time. Emily then
retired from the casement, and, now certain
of being unmolested went to walk on the
ramparts, from whence she soon after saw
<PB N="376" REF="378"/>
the party winding among the mountains to
the west, appearing and disappearing be‚à£tween
the woods, till distance confused their
figures, consolidated their numbers, and
only a dingy mass appeared moving along
the heights.</P>
<P>Emily observed, that no workmen were
on the ramparts, and that the repairs of
the fortifications seemed to be completed.
While she sauntered thoughtfully on, she
heard distant footsteps, and, raising her eyes,
saw several men lurking under the castle
walls, who were evidently not workmen,
but looked, as if they would have accorded
well with the party which was gone. Won‚à£dering
where Annette had hid herself so
long, who might have explained some of
the late circumstances, and then considereing
that Madame Montoni was probably risen,
she went to her dressing-room, where she
mentioned what had occurred; but Madame
Montoni either would not, or could not,
give any explanation of the evednt. The
Signor's reserve to his wife, on this subject,
<PB N="377" REF="379"/>
was probably nothing more than usual; yet,
Emily, it gave an air of mystery to the
whole affair, that seerned to hint, there was
danger, if not villany, in his schemes.</P>
<P>Annette presently came, and, as usual,
was full of alarm; to her lady's eager
enquiries of what she had heard among the
servants, she replied:</P>
<P>‚ÄúAh, Madam! nobody knows what it
is all about, but old Carlo; he knows well
enough, I dare say, but he is as close as
his master. Some say the Signor is go‚à£ing
out to frighten the enemy, as they
call it: but where is the enemy? Then
others say, he is going to take away some
body's cstle: but I am sure he has room
enouth in his own, without taking other
people's; and I am sure i should like it a
great deal better, if there were more people
to fill it.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúAh! you will soon have your wish, I
fear,' replied Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo, madam, but such ill-looking fel‚à£lows
are not worth having. I mean such
<PB N="378" REF="380"/>
gallant, smart, merry fellows as Ludovico,
who is always telling droll stories, to make
one laugh. It was but yesterday, he told
me such a humour some tale! I can't help
laughing at it now.‚ÄîSays he‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, we can dispense with the story,‚Äù
said her lady. ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù continued Annette,
'he sees a great way, a great way further
than other people! Now he sees into all
the Signor's meaning, without knowing a
word about the matter!</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow is that?‚Äù said madame Montoni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy he says‚Äîbut he made me promise
not to telle, and i would not disoblige him
for the world.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat is it he made you promise not to
tell?‚Äù said her lady, sternly. ‚ÄúI insist upon
knowing immediately‚Äîwhat is it he made
you promise?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO Madam,‚Äù cried Annette, ‚ÄúI would
not tell for the universe!‚Äù ‚ÄúI insist upon
your telling this instant,‚Äù said Madame
Montoni. ‚ÄúO dear madam! I would not
tell for an hundred sequins! You would
<PB N="379" REF="381"/>
not have me forswear myself, madam!‚Äù
exclaimed Annette.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI will not wait another moment,‚Äù said
Madame Montoni. Annette was silent.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThe Signor shall be informed of this
directly,‚Äù rejoined her mistress: ‚Äúhe will
make you discover all.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is Ludovico, who has discovered,‚Äù
said Annette: ‚Äúbut for mercy's sake, ma‚à£dam,
don't tell the. Signor, and you shall
know all directly.‚Äù Madame Montoni
said, that she would not.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell then, madam, Ludovico says,
that the Signor, my master, is‚Äîis‚Äîthat is,
he only thinks so, and any body, you know,
madam, is free to think‚Äîthat the Signor,
my master, is‚Äîis‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúIs what?‚Äù said her lady, impatiently.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThat the Signor, my master, is going
to be‚Äîa great robber‚Äîthat is‚Äîhe is going
to rob on his own account;‚Äîto be, (but
I am sure I don't understand what he means)
to be a‚Äîcaptain of‚Äîrobbers.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúArt thou in thy senses, Annette?‚Äù said
<PB N="380" REF="382"/>
Madame Montoni; or is this a trick to de‚à£ceive
me? Tell me, tis instant, what Lu‚à£dovico
did say to thee;‚Äîno equivocation;
‚Äîthis instant.</P>
<P>‚ÄúNay, madam,‚Äù cried Annette, ‚Äúif this
is all I am to get for having told the se‚à£cret‚Äù
‚ÄîHer mistress thus continued to in‚à£sist,
and Annette to protest, till Montoni,
himself, appeared, who bade the latter leave
the room, and she withdrew, trembling for
the fate of her story. Emily also was re‚à£tiring,
but her aunt desired she would stay;
and Montoni had so often made her a wit‚à£ness
of their contention, that he no longer
had scruples on that account.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI insist upon knowing this instant,
Signor, what all this means:‚Äù said his
wife‚Äîwhat are all these armed men,
whom they tell me of, gone out about?
Montoni answered her only with a look of
scorn; and Emily whispered something to
her. ‚ÄúIt does not signify,‚Äù said her aunt:
‚ÄúI will know; and I will know, too, what
the castle has been fortified for.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="383"/>
‚ÄúCome, come, said Montoini,‚Äù other
business brought me here. I must be trifled
with no longer. I have immediate oc‚à£casion
for what I demand‚Äîthose estates
must be given up, without further conten‚à£tion;
or I may find a way‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúThey never shall be given up,‚Äù inter‚à£rupted
madame Montoni: ‚Äúthey never
shall enable you to carry on your wild
schemes;‚Äîbut what are these? I will know.
Do you expect the castle to be attacked?
Do you expect enemies? Am I to be shut
up here, to be killed in a siege?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúSign the writings,‚Äù said Montoni,
‚Äúand you shall know more.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhat enemy can be coming?‚Äù con‚à£tinued
his wife. ‚ÄúHave you entered into
the service of the state? Am I to be block‚à£ed
up here to die?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThat may possibly happen," said Mon‚à£toni,
‚Äúunless you yield to my demand: for,
come what may, you shall not quit the
castle till then." Madame Montoni burst
<PB N="382" REF="384"/>
into loud lamentation, which she as sud‚à£denly
checked, considering, that her hus‚à£band's
assertions might be only artifices, em‚à£ployed
to extort her consent. She hinted
this suspicion, and, in the next moment, told
him also, that his designs were not so ho‚à£nourable
as to serve the state, and that she
believed he had only commenced a captain
of banditti, to join the enemies of Venice,
in plundering and laying waste the sur‚à£rounding
country.</P>
<P>Montoni looked at her for a moment
with a steady and stern countenance; while
Emily trembled, and his wife, for once,
thought she had said too much. ‚ÄúYou
shall be removed, this night," said he, ‚Äúto
the east turrent: there, perhaps, you may
understand the danger of offending a man,
who has an unlimited power over you."</P>
<P>Emily now fell at his feet, and, with
tears of terror, supplicated for her aunt,
who sat, trembling with fear, and indigna‚à£tion;
now ready to pour forth execrations,
<PB N="383" REF="385"/>
and now to join the intercessions of Emily.
Montoni, however, soon interrupted these
entreaties with an horrible oath; and, as he
burst from Emily, leaving his cloak in her
hand, she fell to the floor, with a force, that
occasioned her a severe blow on the fore‚à£head.
But he quitted the room, without at‚à£tempting
to raise her, whose attention was
called from herself, by a deep groan from
Madame Montoni who continued other‚à£wise
unmoved in her chair, and had not
fainted. Emily, hastening to her assistance,
saw her eyes rolling, and her featres con‚à£vulsed.</P>
<P>Having spoken to her, without receiving
an answer, she brought water, and support‚à£ed
her head, while she held it to her lips;
but the increasing convulsions soon com‚à£pelled
Emily to call for assistance. On her
way through the hall, in search of Annette,
she met Montoni, whom she told what had
happened, and conjured to return and com‚à£fort
her aunt; but he turned silently away;
with a look of indifference, and went out
<PB N="384" REF="386"/>
upon the ramparts. At length she found
old Carlo and Annette, and they hastened
to the dressing-room, where Madame Mon‚à£toni
had fallen on the floor, and was lying
in strong convulsions. having lifted her
into the adjoining room, and laid her on
the bed, the force of her disorder still made
all their strength necessary to hold her, while
Annette trembled and sobbed, and old Car‚à£lo
looked silently and piteously on, as his
feeble hands grasped those of his mistress,
till, turning his eyes upon Emily, he ex‚à£claimed,
‚ÄúGod God! Signora, what is the
matter?"</P>
<P>Emily looked calmly at him, and saw
his enquiring eyes fixed on her and An‚à£nette,
looking up, screamed loudly; for
Emily's face was stained with blood, which
continued to fall slowly from her forehead:
but her attention had been so entirely oc‚à£cupied
by the scene before her, that she had
felt no pain from the wound. She now
held an handkerchief to her face, and, not‚à£withstanding
her fantness, continued to
<PB N="385" REF="387"/>
watch Madame Montoni, the violence of
whose convulsions was abating, till at
length they ceased, and left her in a kind
of stupor.</P>
<P>‚ÄúMy aunt must remain quiet," said
Emily. ‚ÄúGo, good Carlo; if we should
want your assistance, i will send for you.
In the mean time, if you have an opportu‚à£nity,
speak kindly of your mistress to your
master."</P>
<P>‚ÄúAlas!" said Carlo, ‚ÄúI have seen too
much! i have little insluence with the Sig‚à£nor.
But do, dear young lady, take some
care of yourself; that is an ugly wound,
and you look sadly."</P>
<P>‚ÄúThank you, my friend, for your consi‚à£sideration,"
said Emily, smiling kindly:
‚Äúthe wound is trifling, it came by a fall."</P>
<P>Carlo shook his head, and left the room;
and Emily, with Annette, continued to
watch by her aunt. 'Did my lady tell
the Signor what Ludovico said, ma'am‚à£selle?"
asked Annette in a whisper; but
Emly quieted her fears on the subject.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="388"/>
‚ÄúI thought what this quarrelling would
come to," continued Annette; ‚ÄúI suppose
the Signor has been beating my lady."</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo, no, Annette, you are totally mis‚à£taken,
nothing extraordinary has hap‚à£pened."</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy, extraordinary thoings happen here
so often, ma'amselle, that there is nothing
in them. Here is another legion of those
ill-looking fellows, come to the castle, this
morning."</P>
<P>‚ÄúHush! Annette, you will disturb my
aunt; we will talk of that by and bye."</P>
<P>They continued watching silently, till
Madame Montoni uttered a low sigh, when
Emily took her had, and spoke sooth‚à£ingly
to her; but the former gazed with
unconscious eyes, and it was long before
she knew her niece. Her first words then
enquired for Montoni; to which Emily re‚à£plied
by an entreaty, that she would com‚à£pose
her spirits, and consent to be kept
quiet, adding, that, if she wished any mes‚à£sage
to be converyed to him, she would her‚à£self
<PB N="387" REF="389"/>
deliver it. 'No," said her aunt faintly
‚Äúno‚ÄîI have nothing new to tell him. Does
he persist in saying I shall be removed from
my chamber?"</P>
<P>Emily replied, that he had not spoken,
on the pubject, since Madame Montoni
heard him; and then she tried to divert
her attention to some other topic; but
her aunt seemed to be inattentive to
what she said, and lost in secret thoghts.
Emily, having brought her some refresh‚à£ment,
now left her to the care of Annette,
and went in search of Montoni, Whom she
found on a remote part of the rampart, con‚à£versng
among a group of the men described
by Annette. They stood round hom with
fierce, yey subjugated, looks, while he,
speaking earnestly, and pointing to the
walls, did not perceive Emily, who remained
at smoe distance, waiting till he should be at
leisure, and observing involuntarily the ap‚à£pearance
of one man, more savage than his
fellow, who stood resting on his pike, and
looking, over the sholders of a comrade,
<PB N="388" REF="390"/>
at Montoni, to whom he listened with un‚à£common
earnestness. This man was appa‚à£rently
of low condition; yet his looks ap‚à£peared
not to acknowledge the superiority
of Montoni, as did those of his companions;
and sometimes they even assumed an air
of authority, which the decisive manner of
the Signor could not repress. Some few
words of Montoni then passed in the wind;
and, as the men were separating, she heard
him say, ‚ÄúThis evening, then, being the
watch at sun-set."</P>
<P>'At sun-set, signor," replied one or
two of them, and walked away; while
Emily approached Montoni, who appeared
desirous of avoiding her: but, though she
observed this, she had courage to proceed.
She endeavoured to interceded once more for
her aunt, represented to him her sufferings,
and urged the danger of exposing her to a
cold apartment in her present state. ‚ÄúShe
suffers by her own folly," said Montoni,
‚Äúand is not to be pitied;‚Äîshe knows how she
may avoid these sufferings in future‚Äîif she
<PB N="389" REF="391"/>
is removed to the turret, it will be her own
fault. Let her be obedient, and sign the
writings you heard of, and I will think no
more of it."</P>
<P>When Emily ventured still to plead, he
sternly silenced and rebuked her for inter‚à£fering
in his domestic affairs, but, at length,
dismissed her with this concession‚ÄîThat he
would not remove Madame Montoni, on
the ensuing night, but allow her till the
next to consider, whether she would resign
her settlements, or be imprisoned in the east
turret of the castle, ‚Äúwhere she shall find,"
he added, ‚Äúa punishment she may not ex‚à£pect."</P>
<P>Emily then hastened to inform her aunt
of this short respite and of the alternative,
that awaited her, to which the latter made
no reply, but appeared thoughtful, while
Emoly, in consideration of her extreme lan‚à£guor,
wished to sooth her mind by leading it
to less interesting topics and, though these ef‚à£forts
were unsuccessful, and Madame Monto‚à£ni
became peevish, her resolution, on the con‚à£tended
<PB N="390" REF="392"/>
point, seemed somewhat ro relax, and
Emily recommended, as her only means of
safety, that she should submit to Montoni's
demand. ‚ÄúYou know not what you ad‚à£vise,
said her aunt. Do you understand,
that these estates will descend to you at my
death, if I persist in a refusal?"</P>
<P>‚ÄúI was ignorant of that circumstance,
madam," replied Emily, 'but the know‚à£ledge
of it cannot with-hold me from ad‚à£vising
you to adopt the conduct, which not
only your peace, but, I fear, your safety re‚à£quires,
and I entreat, that you will not suffer
a consideration comparatively so trifling,
to make you hestate a moment in resigning
them."</P>
<P>‚ÄúAre you sincere, niece?" ‚ÄúIs it pos‚à£sible
yopu can doubt it, madam?" Her
aunt appeared to be affected. ‚ÄúYou are
not unworthy of these estates, niece," said
she: ‚ÄúI would wish to keep them for your
sake‚Äîyou shiw a virtue I did not ecpect."</P>
<P>‚ÄúHow have I deserved this reproof,
madam?" said Emily sorrowfully.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="393"/>
‚ÄúReproof!" replied Madame Montoni:
‚ÄúI meant to praise your virtue."</P>
<P>‚ÄúAlas! here is no exertion of virtue,"
rejoined Emily, ‚Äúfor here is no temptation
to be overcome."</P>
<P>‚ÄúYet Monsieur Valancourt"‚Äîsaid her
aunt. ‚ÄúO madan!" interrupted Emily,
anticipating what she would have said, 'do
not let me glance on that subject: do not
let my mind be stained with a wish so shock‚à£ingly
self-intersted." She immediately
changed the topic, and continued with Ma‚à£dame
Montoni, till she withdrew to her
apartment for the night.</P>
<P>At that hour, the castle was perfectly
still, and every inhabitant of it, except her‚à£self,
seemed to have retired to rest. As she
passed along the wide and lonely galleries,
dusky and silent, she felt forlorn and appre‚à£hensive
of‚Äîshe scarcely knew what; but
when, entering the corridor, she recollected
the incident of the preceding nignt, a dread
seized her, lest a subject of alarm, similar to
that, which had befallen Annette, should oc‚à£cur
<PB N="392" REF="394"/>
to her, and which, whether reals or
ideal, would, she felt, have an almost equal
effect upon her weakened spirits. The
chamber, to which Annette had alluded,
she did not exactly know, but understood
it to be one of those she must pass in the
way to her own; and, sending a fearful look
forward into the gloom, she stepped lightly
and cautiously along, till, coming to a door,
from whence issued a low sound, she hesi‚à£tated
and paused; and, during the delay of
that moment, her fears so much increased,
that she had no power to move from the
spot. Believing, that she heard a human
voice within, she was somewhat revived; but,
in the next moment, the door was opened,
and a person, whom she conceived to be
Montoni, appeared, who instantly started
back, and closed it, though not before she
had seen, by the light that burrned in the
had seen, by the light that burned in the
chamber, another person, sitting in a melan‚à£choly
attitude by the fire. Here terror va‚à£nished,
but her astonishment only began,
which was now roused by the mysterious
<PB N="393" REF="395"/>
secrecy of Montoni's mannr, and the dis‚à£covery
of a person, whom he thus visited at
midnight, in an apartment, which had long
been shut up, and of which such extraordi‚à£nary
reports were circulated.</P>
<P>While she thus continued hestating,
strongly prompted to watch Montoni's mo‚à£tions,
yet fearing to irritate him by appear‚à£ing
to notice them, the door was again
opened cautiously, and as instantly closed as
before. She then stepped softly to her
chamber, which was the next but one to
this, but, having put down her lamp, re‚à£turned
to an obscure corner of the corridor,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>o observe the proceedings of this half-seen
person, and to ascertain, whether it was in‚à£deed
Montoni.</P>
<P>Having waited in silent expectation for a
few minutes, with her eyes fixed on the door,
it was again opened, and the same person ap‚à£peared,
whom she now knew to be Montoni.
He looked cautiously round, wothout per‚à£ceiving
her, then, stepping forward, closed
the door, and left the corridor. Soon after,
<PB N="394" REF="396"/>
Emily heard the door fastened on the in‚à£side,
and she withdrew to her chamber, won‚à£dering
at what she had witnessed.</P>
<P>It was now twelve o'clock. As she closed
her casement, she heard footsteps on the ter‚à£race
below, and saw imperfectly, through
the gloom several persons advancing, who
Passed under the casement. She then heard
the clink of arms, and, in the next moment,
the watch-word; when, recollecting the com‚à£mand
she had over heard from Montoni, and
the hour of the night, she understood, that
these men were, for the first time, relieving
guard in the castle. Having listened till all
was again still, she retired to sleep.</P>

<P>ON the following morning, Emily went
early to the apartment of Madame Mon‚à£toni,
who had slept well, and was much re‚à£covered.
Her spirits also had returned with
her health, and her resolution to oppose
Montoni's demands revived, though it yet
struggled with her fears, which Emily, who
trembled for the consequence of further op‚à£position,
endeavoured to confirm.</P>
<P>Her aunt, as has been already shewn, had
a disposition, which delighted in contradic‚à£tion,
and which taught her, when unplea‚à£sant
circumstances were offered to her un‚à£derstanding,
not to enquire into their truth,
<PB N="396" REF="398"/>
but to seek for arguments, by which she
might make them appear false. Long habit
had so entirely confirmed this natural pro‚à£pensity,
that she was not conscious of pos‚à£sessing
it. Emily's remonstrances and re‚à£presentations,
therefore, roused her pride,
instead of alarming, or convincing her judg‚à£ment,
and she still relied upon the discovery
of some means, by which she could once
escape from his castle, she might defy his
power, and, obtaining a decisive separation,
live in comsort on the estates, that yet re‚à£mained
for her, she mentioned this to her
niece, who accorded with her in the wish,
but differed from her, as to the probability
of its completion. She representented the im‚à£possibility
of passing the gates, secured and
guarded as they were, and the extreme dan‚à£ger
of committing her design to the discre‚à£tion
of a servant, who might either pur‚à£posely
betray, or accidentaly disclose it.‚Äî
Montoni's vengeance would also disdain re‚à£straint,
<PB N="397" REF="399"/>
if her intention was detected: and,
though Emily dwished, as fervently as she
could do, to regain her freedom, and re‚à£turn
to France, she consulted only Madame
Montoni's safety, and perservered in advising
her to relinquish her settlement, without
braving further outrage.</P>
<P>The struggtle of contrary emotions, how‚à£ever,
continued to rage in her aunt's bosom,
and she still brooded over the chance of ef‚à£fecting
an escape. While she thus sat,
Montoni entered the room, and, without
noticing his wife's indisposition, said, that
he came to remind her of the impolicy of
trifling with him, and that he gave her only
till the evening to determine, whether she
would consent to his demand, or compel
him, by a refusal, to remove her to the east
turret. He added, that a party of cavaliers
would dine with him, that day, and that he
expected she would sit at the head of the
table, where Emily, also, must be present.
Madame Montoni was now on the point of
uttering an absolute refusal, but, suddenly
<PB N="398" REF="400"/>
considering, that her liberty, during this en‚à£tertainment,
though circumscribed, might
favour her further plans, she acquiesced,
with seeming reluctance, and Montoni, soon
after, left the apartment. His command
struck Emily with surprise and apprehen‚à£sion,
who shrunk from the thoght of being
exposed to the gaze of strangers, such as her
fancy represented these to be, and the words
of Count Morano, now again recollected,
did not sooth her fears.</P>
<P>When she withdrew to prepare for din‚à£ner,
she dressed herself with even more sim‚à£plicity
than usual, that she might escape
observation‚Äîa policy, which did not avail
her, for, as she was re-passed to her aunt's apart‚à£ment,
she was met by Montoni, who cen‚à£sured
what he called her prudish appearance,
and insisted, that she would wear the most
splendid dress she had, even that, which had
been prepared for her intended nuptials
with Count Morano, and which, it now ap‚à£peared,
her aunt had carefully brought with
her from Venice. This was made, not in
<PB N="399" REF="401"/>
the Venetian, but, in the Neapolitan fashion,
so as sat off the
shape and figure, to the
utmost afvantage. In it, her beautiful ches‚à£nut
tresses were negligently bound up in
pearls, and suffered to fall beck again on
her neck. The simplicity of a better tasste,
than Madame Montoni's, was conspicuous
in thid dress, slendid as it was, and Emily's
unaffected beauty never had appeared more
captivatingly. She had now o9nly to hope,
that Montoni's order was prompteed, not by
any extraordinary design, but by an ostenta‚à£tion
to the eyes of strangers; yet nothing less
than hi absolute command could have pre‚à£vailed
with her to wear a dress, that had been
designed for such an offensive purpos, much
less to have owrn it on this occasion. As
she descended to dinner, the emotion of her
mind threw a faint blush over her counte‚à£nace,
and heightened its interesting expres‚à£sion;
for timidity had made her linger in
her apartment, till the utmost moment, and,
when she entered the hall, in which a kind
<PB N="400" REF="402"/>
of state dinner was spread, Montoni adn
his guests were already seated at the table.
She was then going to place herself by her
aunt; but Montoni waved his hand, and two
of the cavaliers rose, and seated her between
them.</P>
<P>The eldesst of these was a tall man, with
srong Italian features, an quiline nos,
and dark penetrating eyes, that flashed with
fire, when his mind was agitated, and, even
in its state of res, retained somewhat of the
wildness of the passions. His visage was long
and narrow, and his complexion of a sickly
yellow.</P>
<P>The other, who appeared to be about
forty, had features of a different cast, yet
Italian, and his look was slow, subtle adn
penetrating; his eyes, of a dark grey, were
small, and hollow; his complexion was a
sun-burnt brown, and the contour of his
face, though inclined to oval, was irregular
and ill-formed.</P>
<P>Eight other guests sat round the table,
who were all dressed in an uniform, and had
<PB N="401" REF="403"/>
all an expression, more or less, of wild fierce‚à£ness,
of subtle design, or of licentious pas‚à£sions.
As Emily timidly surveyed them,
she remembered the scene of the preceding
mornign, and again almost fanciedd her‚à£ses
surrounded by banditti; then, looking
back to the tranquillity of her early life,
she felt scarcely less astibushment, than
grief, at her present stuation. The scene,
in which they sat, assisted the illusion; it
was an antient hall, gloomy from the style
and because almost the only light it re‚à£ceived
was from one large gothic window,
and from a pair of folding doors, which,
being open, admitted likewise a view of the
west rampart, with the wild mountains of
the Apennine beyond.</P>
<P>The middle compartment of this hall
rose into a vaulted roof, enriched with fre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>‚à£work,
and supported, on three sides, by
pillars of marble; beyond these, long co‚à£lonades
retired in gloomy grandeur, till
their extent was lost in twilight. The
<PB N="402" REF="404"/>
lightess footsteps of the servznts, as
they advanced tghroguh these, were re‚à£turned
in whispering echoes, and their
figures, seen at a distance imperfectly
Emily's imagination. She looked alter‚à£natley
at Montoni, at his guests and on the
her dear native province, her pleasant home
friends, whom she had lost, grief and sur‚à£prise
again occupied her mind.</P>
<P>When he thoughts could return form
these considerations, she fancied she observed
an air of authority towards his guests, such
as she had never before seen him assume,
though he had always been distinguished by
an haughty carriage; there was something
also in the manners of the strangers, that
seemed perfectly, though not servilely, to
acknowledge his superiority.</P>
<P>During dinner, the conversation was
chiefly on war and politics. They talked
with energy of the state of Venice,. its dan‚à£gers,
<PB N="403" REF="405"/>
the character of the reigning Doge
and of the chief senators; and then spoke
of the state of Rome. When the repast
was over, they rose, and, each filling his
goblet with wine from the gilded ewer, that
exploits!‚Äù Montoni was lifting his gob‚à£let
to his lips to drink this toast, when sud‚à£denly
teh wine hissed, rose to the brim,
and, as he held the glass from him, it burst
into a thousand pieces</P>
<P>To him, who constantly used that fort of
Venice glase, which had the quality of
breaking, upon receiving poisoned liquor,
a suspicion, that some of his guests had
endeavoured to betray him, instantly oc‚à£curred,
and he ordered all the gates to be
closed, drew his sword, and, lookign round
on them, who stood in silent amazement,
exlaimed, ‚ÄúHere is a traitor among us;
let those, that are innocent, assist in dis‚à£covering
the guilty.‚Äù</P>
<P>Indignation flashed from the eyes of the
cavaliers, who all drew their swords; and
<PB N="404" REF="406"/>
Madame Montoni, terrified at what might
ensue, was hastenign from the hall, when
her husband commanded her to stay; but
his further woeds could not now be disting‚à£uished
fro the voice of every person rose
together. His order, that all the servants
should appear, was at length obeyed, and
they declared their ignoraance of any deceit
a protestation which could not be believed;
for it was evident, that, a sMontoni's
liquor, and his only, had been poisoned, a
deliberate design had been formed against
his life, which could not have been carried
so fare towards its accomplish;emtn, without
the connivance of the servatn, who had the
care of the wine ewers.</P>
<P>This man, with another, whose face be‚à£trayed
either the consciousnesss of guilt, or
the fear of punishemtn, Montoni ordered to
be chained instantly, and confined in a
strong room, which had romerly been used
as a prison. Thither, likewise, he would
have sent all his guests, had he not foreseen
the consequence of so bold and unjustisiable
<PB N="405" REF="407"/>
a proceeding. As to those, therefore, he
contented himself with swearing, that no
man should pass the gates, till this extraor‚à£dinary
affair had been investigated, and
then sternly bade his wife retire to her
apartment, whither he suffered Emily to
attend her.</P>
<P>In about half an hour, he followed to
the dressing-room; and Emily observed,
with horror, his dark countenance and qui‚à£vering
lip, and heard him denounce ven‚à£geance
on her aunt.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt will avail you nothing,‚Äù said he to
his wife, ‚Äúto deny the fact; I have proof
of your guilt. Your only chance of mercy
rests on a full ocnsession;‚Äîthere is nothing
to hope from sullenness, or falsehood; your
accomplice has confessed all.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily's fainting spirits were roused by
astonishment, as she heard her aunt accused
of a crime so atrocious, and she could not,
for a moment, admit the possibility of her
guilt. Meanwhile Madame Montoni's agi‚à£tation
did not permit her to reply; alter‚à£nately
<PB N="406" REF="408"/>
her complexion varied from livid
paleness to a crimson flush; adn she trem‚à£bled
but, whether with fear, or with in‚à£dignation,
it were difficult to decide.</P>
<P>‚ÄúSpared your words,‚Äù said Montoni, seeing
her about to speak, ‚Äúyour countenance
makes full consession of your crime.-You
shall be instantly removed to the east turret.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThis accusation,‚Äù said Madme Mont‚à£oni,
speaking with difficulty, ‚Äúis used on‚à£ly
as an excuse for your cruelty; I disdain
to reply to it. You do not believe me
guilty.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúSignor!‚Äù said Emily solemnly, ‚Äúthis
dreadful cahrge, I would answer with my
life, is false. Nay, Signor,‚Äù she added, ob‚à£serving
the serity of his countenance,
‚Äúthis is no moment for restraint, on my
part; I do not scruple to tell you, that
by the suggestion of some person, who aims
at the ruin of my aunt:-it is impossible,
that you could yourself hav eimagined a
crime so hideous.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="409"/>
Montoni, his lips trembling more than
before, replied only, ‚ÄúIf you value your
own safety,‚Äù addressing Emily, ‚Äúyou will
be filent I shall know how to interpret
your remonstrances, should you perserve
in them.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily raised her eyes calmly to heaven
‚ÄúHere is, indeed, then, nothiong to hope!‚Äù
said she.</P>
<P>‚ÄúPeace!‚Äù cried Montoni, ‚Äúor your shall
find there is something to fear.‚Äù</P>
<P>He turned tohis wife, who had now re‚à£covered
her spirits, and who vehemently
and widly remonstrated upon this myste‚à£rious
suspicion: but Montoni's rage height‚à£ened
with her indignation, and Emily,
dreading the event of it, threw herself be‚à£tween
them, and clasped his knees in silence
looking up in his face with an expression,
that might have softened the heart of a
fiend. Whether his was hardened by a
conviction of Madame Montoni's guilt, or
that a bare suspicion of it made him eager
to exercise vengeanace, he was totally and
<PB N="408" REF="410"/>
alike insensible to the distress of his wife,
and to the pleading looks of Eamnily, whom
he made no attempt to raise, but was vehe‚à£mently
menacing both, when he was called
out of the room by some person at the door.
As he shut the door, Emily heard his turn
the lock and take out the key; so that
Madame Montoni and herself were now
prisoners; and she saw that his designs be‚à£came
more and more terrible. Her endea‚à£ours
to explain his motives for this circumstance
were almost as inessectual as
those to sooth the distress of her aunt,
whose innocence she could not doubt;
but she, at length, accounted for Montoni's
readiness to suspect his hiw own con‚à£sciousness
of cruelty towards her, and for
the sudden violence of his present conduct
againsst both, before even his suspicions
could be completely formed, by this general
eagerness to effect suddenly whatever he
was led to desire and his carelessness of justice,
or humanity, in accomplishing it.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni, after some time, again
<PB N="409" REF="411"/>
looked round, in search of a possibility of
escape from the castle, and conversed with
Emily on the subject, who was now willing
to encounter any hazard, though she forbore
to encourage a hope in her aunt, which
she herself did not admit. How strongly
the edisice was secured, and how vigilantly
guarded, she knew too well; and trembled
to commit their safety t the caprice of the
servant, whose assistance they must solicit.
Old Carlo was compassionate, but he seemed
to be too much in his master's interest to
be trusted by them; Annette could of her
self do little, and Emily knew Ludovico
only from her report. At present, how‚à£ever,
these considerations were useless, Ma‚à£dame
Montoni and her niece being shut up
from all intercourse, even with the persons,
whom there might be these reasons to
reject.</P>
<P>In the hall, confussion and tumult still
resigned. Emily, as she listened anxiously
to the murmur, that sounded along the
<PB N="410" REF="412"/>
gallery, sometimes fancied she heard the
clashing of swords, and, when she considered
the nature of the provocation, given by
Montoni, and his impetuosity, it appeared
probable, that nothing less than arms would
terminate the contention. Madame Mon‚à£toni,
having exhausted all her expressions
of indignation, and Emily, hers of comfort,
they remained silent, in that kind of breath‚à£less
stillness, which, in nature, often suc‚à£ceeds
to the uproar of conflicting elements;
a stillness, like the morning, that dawns
upon the ruins of an earthquake.</P>
<P>An uncertain kind of terror pervaded
Emily's mind; the circumstances of the
past hour still came dimly and confusedly
to her memory; and her thoughts were
various and rapid, though without tu‚à£mult.</P>
<P>From this state of waking visions she was
recalled by a knocking at the chamber‚à£door,
and, enquiring who was there, heard
the whispering voice of Annette.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="413"/>
‚ÄúDear madam, let me come in, I have a
great deal to say,‚Äù said the poor girl.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThe door is locked,‚Äù ansered her lady.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, ma'am, but do pray open it.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Signor has the key,‚Äù said Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúO blessed Virgin! What will become of us?‚Äù exclaimed Annette.</P>
<P>‚Äússift us to escape,‚Äù said her mistress.
‚ÄúWhere is Ludovico?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúBelow in the hall, ma'am amongst
them all, fighting with the best of them!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúFighting! Who are fighting? Cried
Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy the Signor, m'am, and all the
Signors, and a great many more.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIs any person much hurt?‚Äù said Emily,
in tremulous voice.‚ÄúHurt! Yes, ma'amselle,
‚Äîthere they lie bleeding, and the
swords are clashing, and‚ÄîO holy saints!
Do let me in, ma'am, they are coming this
Way‚ÄîI shall be murdered!‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="414"/>
‚ÄúFly!‚Äù cried Emily, ‚Äúfly! We cannot
open the door.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette repeated, that they were coming,
And in the same moment sled.</P>
<P>‚ÄúBe clam madam,‚Äù said Emily,turning
to her aunt, ‚ÄúI entreat you be calm, I am
not frightened‚Äînot frightened in the least,
do not you be alrmed.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou can scarcely support yourself,‚Äù re‚à£plied
her aunt; ‚ÄúMerciful God! What is
it they mean to do with us?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThey come perhaps to liberate us,‚Äù
said Emily, ‚ÄúSignor Montoni perhaps is‚Äî
is conquered.‚Äù</P>
<P>The belief of his death gave her spirits a
sudden shock, and she grew saint as she saw
him inimagination, expiring at her feet.</P>
<P>‚ÄúThey are coming!‚Äù cried Madame
Montoni‚Äî‚ÄúI hear their step‚Äîthey are at
the door!‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily turned her languid eyes to the
door, but terror deprived her of utterance.
The key sounded in the lock; the door
<PB N="413" REF="415"/>
opened, and Montoni appeared, followed
by three russian like men. ‚ÄúExecuse your
orders,‚Äù said he, turning to them, and
pointing to his wife, who shrieked, but was
immediately carried from the room; while
Emily shunk, senseless, on a couch by which
she had endeavoured to support herself.
When she recovered, she was alone, and re‚à£collected
only, that Madame Montoni had
been there, together with some unconnected
particulars of the preceding transcation,
which were, however, sufficient ot renew
all her terror She looked wildly round
the apartment, as if in search of some means
of intelligence, concerning her aunt, while
neither her own danger, of an idea of
escaping from the room, immediately oc‚à£curred.</P>
<P>When her recollection was more com‚à£plete,
she raised herself and went, but with
only a faint hope, to examine whether the
door was unfastened. It was so, and she
then stepped timidly our into the gallery,
but paused there, uncertain which way she
<PB N="414" REF="416"/>
should proceed. Her first wish was to ga‚à£ther
some information, as to her aunt, and
she, at length, turned her steps to go to the
lisser hall, where Annette and the other ser‚à£vants
usually waited.</P>
<P>Every where, as she passed, she heard,
from a distant, the uproar of contention,
and the figures and faces, which she met,
hurrying along the passage, struck her mind
with dismay. Emily might now have ap‚à£peared,
like an angel of light, encompassed
by fiends. At length, she reached the lasser
hall, which was silent and deserted, but,
panting for breath, she sat down to recover
herself. The total stillness of this place was
as awful as the tumult, from which she had
escaped; but she had now time to recall
her scattered thoughts, to remember her per‚à£sonal
danger, and to consider of some means
of safety. She perceived, that it was use‚à£less
to seek Madame Montoni, through the
wide extent and intricacies of the castle,
not, too, when every avenue seemed to be
beset by russians; in this hall she could not
<PB N="415" REF="417"/>
resolve to stay, for she knew not how soon
it might become their place of rendezvous;
and, though she wished to go to her cham‚à£ber,
she dreaded again to encounter them on
the way.</P>
<P>Thus she fat, trembling and hesitating,
when a distant murmur broke on the silence,
and grew louder and louder, till she distin‚à£guished
voices and step approaching. She
then rose to go, but the sound came along
the only passage, by which she could de‚à£part,
and she was compelled to await in the
hall, the arrival of the person, whose steps
she heard. As these advanced, she distinguished
groans, and then saw a man borne
slowly along by four other. Her spirits
faltered at the sight, and she leaned against
the wall for support. The bearers,mean‚à£while,
entered the hall, and, being too bu‚à£sily
occupied to detain, or even notice
Emily, she attempted to leave it, but her
strength failed, and she again sat down on
the bench. A damp chillness came over
her; her sight became confused; she knew
<PB N="416" REF="418"/>
not what had passed, or where she was, yet
the groans of the wounded person still vi‚à£brated
on her heart. In a few moments,
the tide of life seemed again to flow; she
began to breath more freely, and her senses
revived. She had not fainted, nor had ever
totally lost her consciousness, but had con‚à£trived
to support herself on the bench; still
without courage to turn her eyes upon the
unfortunate object, which remained near
her, and about whom the men were yet too
much engaged to attend to her.</P>
<P>When her strength returned, she rose, and
was suffered to leave the hall, though her
anxiety, having produced some vain en‚à£quiries,
concerning Madame Montoni, had
thus made a discovery of herself. Towards
her chamber she now hastened, as fast as
her steps would bear her, for she still per‚à£ceived,
upon her passage, the sounds of
confusion at a distance, and she endea‚à£voured,
by taking her way through some
obscure rooms, to avoide encoutenring the
person, whose looks had terrified her be‚à£fore,
<PB N="417" REF="419"/>
as well as those parts of the castle,
where the tumult might still rage.</P>
<P>At length, she reached her chamber, and,
having secured the door of the corridor,
felt herself, for a moment, in safety. A
profound stillness reigned in this remote
apartment, which not even the faint mur‚à£mur
of the most distant sounds now reached.
She sat down, near one of the casements,
and, as she gazed on the mountain-view
beyond, the deep repose of its beauty struck
her with all the force of contrast, and she
could scarcely believe herself so near a scene
of savage disord. The contending ele‚à£ments
seemed to have retired from their
natural spheres, and to have collected them‚à£selves
into the minds of men, for there along
the tempest now reigned.</P>
<P>Emily tried to tranquillize her spirits, but
anxiety made her constantly listen for some
found, and often look out upon the ram‚à£parts,
where all, however, was lonely and
still., As a sense of her own immediate
danger had decreased, her apprehension con‚à£cerning
<PB N="418" REF="420"/>
Madme Montoni heightened, who
she remembered, had been siercely threat‚à£ened
with consinement in the east turret,
and it was possible, that her husband had
satisfied his present vengeance with this
punishment. She, therefore, determined,
when night should return, and the inhabit‚à£ants
of the castle should be asleep, to ex‚à£plore
the way to the turret, which, as the
direction it stood in was mentioned, ap‚à£peared
not very difficult to be done. She
knew, indeed, that although her aunt might
be there, she could afford her no effectual
assistance, but it might give her some com‚à£fort
even to know, that she was discovered,
and to herar the sound of her niece's voice;
for herself, any certainty, concerning Ma‚à£dame
Montoni's fate, appeared more tole‚à£rable,
than this exhausting suspense.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Annette did not appear, and
Emily was surprised, and somewhat alarmed
for her, whom, in the confusion of the late
scene, various accidents might have befall‚à£len
and it was improbable, that she would
<PB N="419" REF="421"/>
have failed to come to her apartment, un‚à£less
something unfortunate had happened.</P>
<P>Thus the hours passed in solitude, in
silence, and in anxious conjecturing. Be‚à£ing
not once disturbed by a message, or
a sound, it appeared,that Montoni had
wholly forgotten her, and it gave her some
comfort to find, that she could be so unno‚à£ticed.
She endeavoured to withdraw her
thoughts from the anxiety, that preyed upon
them, but they refused contruoul; she could
neither read, or draw, and the tones of her
lute were so utterly discordant with the
present state of her feelings, that she could
not endure them for a moment.</P>
<P>The sun, at length, set behind the west‚à£ern
mountains; his siery beams faded from
the clouds, and then a dun melancholy
purple drew over them, and gradually in‚à£volved
the features of the country below.
Soon after, the sentinels passed on the ram‚à£part
to commence the watch.</P>
<P>Twilight had now spread its gloom over
every object; the dismal obscurity of her
<PB N="420" REF="422"/>
chamber recalled fearful thoughts, but she
remembered, that to procure a light she
must pass through a great extent of the
castle, and above all, through the halls,
where she had already experienced so much
horror. Darkenss, indeed, in the pre‚à£sent
state of her spirits,made silence and
solitude terrible to her; it would also
prevent the possibility of her finding her
way to the turret, and condemn her to
remain in suspense, concerning the fate of
her aunt; yet she dared not to venture forth
for a lamp.</P>
<P>Continuing at the casement, that she
might catch the last lingering gleam of
evening, a thousand vague images of fear
floated on her fancy. ‚Äúwhat if some of
these russians,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúshould find out
the private stair case, and in the darkenss of
night steal into my chamber!‚Äù Then, re‚à£collecting
the mysterious inhabitant of the
neighbouring apartment, her terror changed
its object ‚ÄúHe is not a prisoner,‚Äù said
she, ‚Äúthough he remains in one chamber
<PB N="421" REF="423"/>
for Montoni did not fasten the door, when
he left it; the unknown person himself did
this; it is certain, therefore,he can come
out when he pleases.‚Äù</P>
<P>She paused, for, notwithstanding the ter‚à£rors
of darkenss, she considered it to be
very improbable, whoever he was, that he
could have any interest in intruding upon
her retirement; and again the subject of
her emotion changed, when, remembering
her nearnessto the chamber, wher the veil
had formerly disclosed a dreadful spectacle,
she doubted whether some passage might
not communicate between it and the inse‚à£cure
door of the staire case.</P>
<P>It was now entirely dark, and she left the
casement. As she fat with her eyes fixed
on the hearth, she thought she perceived
there a spark of light; it twinkled and dis‚à£appeared,
and then again was visible. At
length, with much care, she fanned the
embers of a wood fire, that had been light‚à£ed
in the morning, into flame, and having
communicated it to lamp, which always
<PB N="422" REF="424"/>
stood in her room, felt a satisfaction not to
be conceived, without a review of her situa‚à£tion.
Her first care was to guard to the door
of the flaire-case, for which purpose she
placed against it all the furniture she could
move, and she was thus employed, for some
time, at the end of which she had another
instance how much more oppressive misfor‚à£tune
is to the idle, than to the busy; for,
having then leisure to think over all the
circumstances of her present afflictions, she
imagined a thousand evils for futurity, and
these real and ideal subjects of distress alike
wounded her mind.</P>
<P>Thus heavily moved the hours till mid‚à£Night,
when she counted the sulled notes of
The great clock, as they rolled along the
rampart, unmmngled with any sound, except
the distant foot-fall of a sentinel, who
came to relieve guard. She now thought
she might venture towards the turret, and
having gently opened the chamber door to
examine the corridor, and to listen if any
person was stirring in the castle, found all
<PB N="423" REF="425"/>
around in perfect stillness. Yet no sooner
had she left the room, than, she perceived a
light flash on the walkls of the corridor,
and, without waiting to see by whom it was
carried, she shrunk back, and closed her
door. No one approaching, she conjectured,
that it was Montoni going to pay his mid‚à£night
visit to her unknown neighbour, and
she determined to wait, till he should have
retired to his own apartment.</P>
<P>When the chimes had tolled another half
hour, she once more opened the door, and,
perceiving that no person was in the corri
dor,hastily crossed into a passage, that led
along the fouth side of the castle towards
the stair-case, whence she believed she could
easily find her way to the turret. Often
pausing on her way, listening apprehen‚à£sively
to the murmurs of the wind, and
looking fearfully onward into the gloom of
the long passages, she, at length, reached
the stair-case; but there her perplexity be‚à£gen.
Two passages appeared, of which she
knew not how to prefer one, and was com‚à£pelled,
<PB N="424" REF="426"/>
at last, to decide by chance, ra‚à£ther
than by circumstances. That she en‚à£tered,
opened first into a wide gallery, along
which she passed lightly and swiftly; for
the lonely aspect of the place awed her, and
she started at the echo of her own steps.</P>
<P>On a sudden, she thought she heard a
voice, and, not distinguishing from whence
it came, feared equally to proceed, or to
return. For some moments, she stood in an
attitude of listening expectation, shriking
almost from herself and scarcely daring to
look round her. The voice came again, but,
thought it was now near her, terror did not al‚à£low
her to judge exactly whence it proceeded.
She tought, however, that it was the voice
of complaint, and her belief was soon con‚à£firmed
by a low moaning sound, that seemed
to proceed from one of the chambers, open‚à£ing
into the gallery. It instantly occurred
to her, that Madame Montoni might be
there confined, and she advanced to the
door to speak, but was checked by consi
dering, that she was, perhaps, going to com‚à£mit
<PB N="425" REF="427"/>
herself to a stranger, who might disco‚à£ver
her to Montoni; for, though this per‚à£son,
whoever it was, seemed to be in afflic‚à£tion,
it did not follow, that he was a pri‚à£soner.</P>
<P>While these thoughts passed over her mind,
and left her still in hersitation, the voice
spoke again, and, calling ‚ÄúLudovico,‚Äù she
then perceived it to be that of Annette; on
which, no longer hesitating, she went in joy
to answer her.</P>
<P>‚ÄúLudovico!‚Äù cried Annette, sobbing‚Äî
‚ÄúLudovico!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is I,‚Äù said Emily, trying to open the
door. ‚ÄúHow came you here? Who shut
you up?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúLudovico!‚Äù repeated Annette
‚Äî‚ÄúO Ludovico!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is not Ludovico, it is I‚ÄîMademoi‚à£felle
Emily.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette ceased sobbing, and was silent.
‚ÄúIf you can open the door, let me in,‚Äù
said Emily, ‚Äúhere is no person to hurt
you.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="428"/>
‚ÄúLudovico!‚ÄîO, Ludovico!‚Äù cried
Annette.</P>
<P>Emily now lost her patience, and, her
fear of being overheard increasing, she was
even nearly about to leave the door, when
she considered, that Annette might,possI‚à£bly,
know something of the situation of
Madame Montoni, or direct her to the tur‚à£ret.
At length, she obtained a reply, though
little satisfactory, to her questions, for An‚à£nette
knew nothing of Madame Montoni,
and only conjured Emily to tell her what
was become of Ludovico. Of him she had
no information to give, and she again asked
who had shut Annette up.</P>
<P>‚ÄúLudovico,‚Äù said the poor girl, ‚ÄúLudo‚à£vico
shut me up, when I ran away from
the dressing -room door to-day, I went I
scarcely knew where, for safety; and, in
this gallery, here, i met Ludovic, who
hurried me into this chamber, and locked
me up to keep me out of harm, as he said.
But he was in such a hurry himself, he
hardly;spoke ten words, but he told me he
<PB N="427" REF="429"/>
would come, and let me out, when all was
quiet, and he took away the key with him.
Now all these hours are passed, and I have
neither seen, or heard a word of him; they
have murdered him‚ÄîI know they have!‚Äú</P>
<P>Emily suddenly remembered the wounded
person, whom she had seen borne into the
servants' hall, and she scarcely doubted, that
he was Ludovico, but she concealed the
circumstance from Annette, and endea‚à£voured
to comfort her.Then, impatient
to learn something of her aunt, she again
enquired the way to the turret.</P>
<P>‚ÄúO! you are not going, ma'amselle,‚Äù
said Annette, ‚Äúfor Heaven's fake, do not
go, and leave me here by myself.‚Äù
‚ÄúNay, Annette, you do not think I can
wait in the gallery all night,‚Äùreplied Emily.
‚ÄúDirect me to the turret; in the morning
I will endeavour to release you.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO holy Mary!‚Äù exclaimed Annette,
‚Äúam I to stay here by myself all night! I
shall be frightened out of my senses, and I
shall die of hunger; I have had nothing to
eat since dinner!‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="430"/>
Emily could scarcely forbear smiling at
the heterogeneous distresses of Annette,
though she sincerely pitied them, and said
what she sincerely pitied them, and said
what she could to sooth her. At length,
she obtained something like a direction to
the east turret, and quitted the door, from
whence, after many intricacies and perplexi‚à£ties,
she reached the steep and winding stairs
of the turret, at the foot of which she stopped
to resst, and to re-animate her courage with a
sense of her duty. As she furveyed this dis‚à£mal
place, she perceived a door on the oppo‚à£site
side of the stair-case, and, anxious to know
whether it would lead her to Madame Mon‚à£toni,
stried to undrw the bolts, which
fastened it. Afresher air came to her face, as
she unclosed the door, which opened upon
the easst rampart, and the sudden current had
nearly extinguished her light, which she now
removed to a distance; and again, looking out
upon the obscure terrace, she perceived only
the faint outline of the walls and of some
towers, while, above, heavy clouds, borne
along the wind, seemed to mingle with the
<PB N="429" REF="431"/>
stars, and wrap the night in thicker dark‚à£ness.
As she gazed, now willing to defer
the moment of certainty, from which she
expected only confirmation of evil, a distant
footstep reminded her, that she might be
observed by the men on watch, and hastily
closing the door, she took her lamp, and
passed up the stair-case. Termbling came
upon her, as she ascended through the
gloom. To her melancholy fancy this
seemed to be a place of death, and the chill‚à£ing
silence, that reigned, confirmed its cha‚à£racter.
her spirits faltered. ‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù
said she, ‚ÄúI am come hither only to
learn dreadful truth, or to witness some
horrible spectacle; i feel that my senses
would not suvive such and addition of
horror.‚Äù</P>
<P>The image of her aunt murdered‚Äîmur‚à£dered,
perhaps, by the had of Montoni,
rose to her mind; she trembled, gasped for
breath‚Äîrepented that she had dared to ven‚à£ture
hither, and checked her steps. But, af‚à£ter
she had paufed a few minutes, the consci‚à£ousness
<PB N="430" REF="432"/>
of her duty returned, and she went
on. Still all was silent. At length a track
of blood, upon a stair, cought her eye; and
instantly she perceived, that he wall and se‚à£veral
other steps were stained. She paused,
again struggled to support herself, and the
lamp almost fell from her trembling hand.
Still no found was heard, no living being
seemed to inhabit the turret; a thousand
times she wished herself again in her cham‚à£ber;
dreaded to enquire farther‚Äîdreaded to
encounter some horrible spectacle, and yet
could not resolve, now that she was so near
the termination of her efforts, to desist from
them. Having again recollected courage
to proceed, after ascending about half way
up the turret, she came to another door,
but here again she stopped in hesitation;
listened for sounds within, and then, sum‚à£moning
all her resolution, unclosed it, and
entered a chamber, which, as her lamp shot
its feeble rays through the darkenss, seemed
to exhibit only dew-stained and deserted
walls. As she stood examining it, in fearful
<PB N="431" REF="433"/>
expectation of discovering the remains of
her unfortunate aunt, she perceived some‚à£thing
lying in an obscure corner of the
room, and, struck with an horribleconvic‚à£tion,
she became, for an instant, motionless
and nearly insensible. Then, with a kind
of desperate esolution she hurried towards
the object that excited her terror, when,
perceiving the clothes of some person, on
the floor, she caught hold of them, and
found in her grasp the old uniform of a
soldier, beneath which appeared a heap of
pikes and other arms. scarcely daring to
trust her sight, she continued, for some mo‚à£ments,
to gaze on the object of her late
alarm, and then left the chamber, so much
comforted and occupied by the conviction,
that hjer aunt was not there, that she was
going to descend the turret, without enquir‚à£ing
farther; when, on turning to do so,
she observed upon some steps on the second
flight an appearance of blood, and remem‚à£bering,
that there was yet another chamber
to be explored, she again followed the
<PB N="432" REF="434"/>
windings of the ascent. Still, as she as‚à£cended,
the track of blood glared upon the
stairs.</P>
<P>It led her to the door of a landing place,
that terminated them, but she was unable
to follow it farther. Now that she was so
near the fought-for certainty, she dreaded
to know it, even more than before, and had
not fortitude sufficient to speak, or to at‚à£tempt
opening the door.</P>
<P>Having listened, in vain, for some sound,
that might confirm, or destroy her fears,
she, at length, laid her hand on the lock,
and, finding it fastened, called on Madame
Montoni; but only a chilling silence en‚à£sued.</P>
<P>‚ÄúShe is dead!‚Äù she cried,‚Äî‚Äúmurdered!
‚Äîher blood is on the stairs!</P>
<P>Emily grew very faint; could support
herself no longer, and had scarcely presence
of mind to set down the lamp, and place
herself on a step</P>
<P>When her recollection returned, she spoke
again at the door, and again attempted to
<PB N="433" REF="435"/>
open it, and, having lingered for some time,
without receiving any answer, or hearing a
sound, she descended the turret, and, with
all the swiftness her feebleness would per‚à£mit,
fought her own apartment.</P>
<P>As she turned into the corridor, the door
of a chamber opened, form whence Mon‚à£toni
came forth; but Emily, more terrified
than ever to behold him, shrunk back into
the passage soon enough to escape being no‚à£ticed,
and heard him close the door, which
she had perceived was the same she formerly
observed. Having here listened to his de‚à£parting
steps, till their faint found was lost
in distance, she ventured to her apartment,
and, securing it once again, retired to her
bed, leaving the lamp burning on the hearth.
But sleep was sled from her harassed mind,
to which images of horror alone occurred.
She endeavoured to think it possible, that
Madame Montoni had not been taken to
the turret; but, when she recollected the
former meanaces of her husband and the
terrible spirit of vengeance, which he had
<PB N="434" REF="436"/>
displayed on a late occasion; when she re‚à£membered
his general character, the looks
of the men, who had forced Madame Mon‚à£toni
from her apartment, and the written
traces on the stairs of the turret‚Äîshe could
not doubt, that her aunt had been carried
thither, and could scarcely hope, that she
had not been carried to be murdered.
The grey of morning had long dawned
through her casements, before Emily ciosed
her eyes in sleep; when wearied nature,
at length, yielded her a respite from suf‚à£fering.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP.XI.</HEAD>
<Q>‚ÄúWho rears the bloody hand?‚Äù
<BIBL>SAYER.</BIBL></Q>
<P>EMILY remained in her chamber, on
the following morning, without receiving
any notice from Montoni, or seeing a hu‚à£man
being, except the armed men, who
fometimes passed on the terrace below.
Having tasted no food since the dinner of
the preceding day, extreme faintness made
her feel the necessity of quitting the asylum
of her apartment to obtain resreshment, and
she was also very anxious to procure liberty
for Annette. Willing, however, to defer
venturing forth, as long as possible, and
considering, whether she should apply to
Montoni, or to the compassion of some
other person, her excessive anxiety concern‚à£ing
<PB N="436" REF="438"/>
her aunt, at length, overcame her ab‚à£horrence
of his presence, and she deter‚à£mined
to go to him, and to entreat, that
he would suffer her to see Madame Mon‚à£toni.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, it was too certain, from the
absence of Annette, that some accident had
befallen Ludovico, and that she was still in
confinement; Emily, therefore, resolved
also to visit the chamber, where she had
spoken to her, on the preceding night, and,
if the poor girl was yet there, to inform
Montoni of her situation.</P>
<P>It was near noon, before she ventured
from her apartment, and went first to the
south gallery, whither she passed without
meeting a single person, or hearing a sound,
except, now and then, the echo of a distant
footstep.</P>
<P>It was unnecessary to call Annette, whose
lamentations were audible upon the first
approach to the gallery, and who, bewail‚à£ing
her own and Ludovico's fate, told
Emily, that she should certainly be starved
<PB N="437" REF="439"/>
to death, if she was not let out immediately.
Emily replied, that she was going to beg
her release of Montoni; But the terrors of
hunger now yielded to those of the Signor,
and, when Emily left her, she was loudly
entreating, that her place of refuge might
be concealed from him.</P>
<P>As Emily drew near the great hall, the
sounds she heard and the people she met
in the passages renewed her alarm. The
latter, however, were peaceable, and did not
interrup her, though they looked earnestly
at her,as she passed, and sometimes spoke.
On crossing the hall towards the cedar
room, where Montoni usually fat, she per‚à£ceived,
on the pavement, fragments of
swords, some tattered garments stained with
blood, and almost expected to have seen
among them a dead body; but from such
a spectacle she was, at present, spared. As
she approached the room, the sound of se‚à£veral
voices issued from within, and a dread
of appearing before many strangers, as
well as of irritating Montoni by such an in‚à£trusion,
<PB N="438" REF="440"/>
made her pause and falter from
ber purpose. She looked up through the
long arcades of the hall, in search of a ser‚à£vant,
who might bear a message, but no
one appeared, and the urgency of what she
had to request made her still linger near
the door. The voices within were not in
contention, though she distinguished those
of several of the gursts of the preceding
day; but still her resolution failed, when‚à£ever
sthe would have tapped at the door.
and she had determined to walk in the hall,
till some person should appear, who might
call Montoni from the room, when as she
turned from the door, it was suddenly
opened by himseflf. Emily trembled, and
was consused, while he almost started with
surprise, and all the terrors of his counte‚à£nance
unfolded themselves. She forgot all
she would have said, and neither enquired
for her aunt, or entreated for Annette, but
stood silent and embarrassed.</P>
<P>After closing the door he reproved her for a
meanness, of which she had not been guilty.
<PB N="439" REF="441"/>
and sternly questioned her what she had
overheard; an accusation, which revived
her recollection so far, that she assured him
she had not come thither with an intention
to listen to his conversation, but to entreat
his compassion for her aunt, and for An‚à£netre.
Montoni seemed to doubt this as‚à£sertion,
for he regarded her with a scruti‚à£nizing
look; and the doubt evidently arose
from no trifling interest. Emily then fur‚à£ther
explained herself, and concluded with
entreating him to inform her, where her
aunt was placed, and to permit, that she
might visit her; but he looked upon her
only with a malignant smile, which instan‚à£taneously
confirmed her worst fears for her
aunt, and, at that moment, she had not
courage to renew her entreaties.</P>
<P>‚ÄúFor Annette,‚Äù said he,‚Äî‚Äúif you go
to Carlo, he will release the girl; the foolish
fellow, who shut her up, died yesterday.‚Äù
Emily shuddered.‚Äî‚ÄúBut my aunt,
Signor‚Äù‚Äîsaid she, ‚ÄúO tell me of my
aunt!‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="442"/>
‚ÄúShe is taken care of,‚Äù replied Montoni
hastily, ‚ÄúI have no time to answer idle
questions.‚Äù</P>
<P>He would have passed on, but Emily, in
a voice of agony, that could not be wholly
resisted, conjured him to tell her, where
Madame Montoni was; while he paused,
and she anxiously watched his counte‚à£nance,
a trumpet sounded, and, in the
next moment, sh heard the heavy gates
of the portal open, and then the clattering
of horses' hoofs in the court, with the con‚à£fusion
of many voices. She stood for a mo‚à£ment
hestating whether she should follow
Montoni, who, at the found of the trumpet,
had paffed through the hall, and, running
her eyes whence it came, she saw through
the door, that opened beyond a long per‚à£spective
of arched into the courts, a party
of horsemen, whom she judged,as well as
the distance and her embarrassment would
allow, to be the same she had seen depart
a few days before. But she said not to
scrutinize, for, when the trumpet sounded
<PB N="441" REF="443"/>
again, the chevaliers rushed out of the cedar
room, and men came running into the hall
from every quarter of the castle. Emily
once more hurried for shelter to her own
apartment. Thither she was still pursued
by images of horror. She re-considered
Montoni's manner and words, when he
had spoken of his wife, and they served
only to confirm her most terrible suspicions.
Tears refused any longer to relieve her dis‚à£tress,
and she had sat for a considerrable time
absorbed in thought, when a knocking at the
chamber door aroused her, on opening
which she found old Coarlo.</P>
<P>‚ÄúDear young lady,‚Äù said he, ‚ÄúI have
been so Hurried, I never once thought of
you till just now. I have brought you
some fruit and wine, and I am sure you
must stand in need of them by this
time.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThank you, Carlo,‚Äù said Emily, ‚Äúthis
is very good of you. Did the Signor re‚à£mind
you of me?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNo, Signora,‚Äù replied Carlo, ‚Äúhis
<PB N="442" REF="444"/>
Excellenza has business enough on his
hands. Emily then renewed her enqui‚à£ries,
concerning madme Montoni, but
Carlo had been employed at the other end
of the castle, during the time, that she was
removed, and he had heard nothing since,
concerning her.</P>
<P>While he spoke, Emily looked steadily at
him, for she scarcely knew whether he was
really ignorant, or concealed his knowledge
of the truth from a fear of offending his
master. To serval questions, concerning
the contentions of yesterday, he gave very
limited answers; but told, that the disputes
were now amicably settled, and that the
Signor believed himself to have been mis‚à£taken
in his suspicions of his guests. ‚ÄúThe
fighting was about that, Signora,‚Äù said
Carlo; ‚Äúbut I trust I shall never see such
another day in this castle, though strange
things are about to be done.‚Äù</P>
<P>On her enquiring his meaning, ‚ÄúAh,
Signora!‚Äù added he, ‚Äúit is not for me to
betray secrets, or tell all I think, but time
will tell.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="445"/>
She then desired him to release Annette,
and, having describbed the chamber in
which the poor girl was confined, he pro‚à£mised
to obey her immediately, and was
departing, when she remembered to ask
who were the persons just arrived. Her
late conjecture was right; it was Verezzi,
with his party.</P>
<P>Her spirits were smewhat soothed by
this short conversation with Carlo; for, in
her present circumstances, it afforded some
comfort to hear the accents of compasson.
and to meet the look of sympathy.
An hour paffed before Annette appear‚à£ed,
who then came weeping and sobbing.
‚ÄúO Ludovico‚ÄîLudovico!‚Äù cried she.</P>
<P>‚ÄúMy poor Annette!‚Äù said Emily, and
made her sit down.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWho could have soreseen this, ma'am‚à£selle?
O miserable, wretched, day‚Äîthat
ever I should live to see it! and she
continued to moan and lament, till Emily
thought it necessary to check her excess
of grief.‚Äù We are continually losing
<PB N="444" REF="446"/>
dear friends by death,' said she with a
sigh, that came from her heart. ‚ÄúWe must
submit to the will of Heaven‚Äîour tears,
alas! cannot recall the dead!‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette took the handkerchief from her
face.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou will meet Ludovico in a better
world, I hope,‚Äù added Emily.</P>
<P>‚Äúyes‚Äîyes,‚Äîma'amselle,‚Äù sobbed An‚à£nette,
‚Äúbut I hope I shall meet him
again in this‚Äîthough he is so wounded!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWounded!‚Äù exclaimed Emily, ‚Äúdoes
he live?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, ma'am, but‚Äîbut he has a ter‚à£rible
wound, and could not come to let
me out. They thought him dead, at first,
and he has not been rightly himself, till
within this hour.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell Annette, I rejoice to hear he
lives.‚Äù</P>
<P>Lives! Holy Saints! why he will not
die, surely!‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily said she hoped not, but this ex‚à£presson
of hope Annette thought implied
<PB N="445" REF="447"/>
fear and her own increased in proportion,
as Emily endeavoured to encourage her.
To enquiries,concerning Madame Mon‚à£toni,
she could give no satisfactory an‚à£swers.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI quite forgot to ask among the ser‚à£vants,
ma'amselle,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúfor I could
think of nobody but poor Ludovico.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette's grief was now somewhat as‚à£suaged,
and Emily sent her to make en‚à£quiries,
concerning her lady, of whom,
however, she could obtain no intelligence,
some of the people she spoke with being
really ignorant of her fate, and others
having probably received orders to con‚à£ceal
it.</P>
<P>This day passed with Emily in con‚à£tinued
grief and anxiety for her aunt; but
she was unmolested by any notice from
Montoni; and, now that Annette was li‚à£berated,
she obntained food, without ex‚à£posing
herself to danger, or impertinence.</P>
<P>Two following days passed in the same
manner, unmarked by any occurrence,
<PB N="446" REF="448"/>
during which she obtained no information
of Madame Montoni. On the evening of
the second, having dismissed Annette, and
retired to bed, her mind became haunted
by the most dismal images, such as her
long anxiety, concerning her aunt, sug‚à£gested;
and, unable to forget herself, for
a moment, or to vanquish the phantoms,
that tormented her, she rose from her bed,
and went to one of the casements of her
chamber, to breathe a freer air</P>
<P>All without was silent and dark, unless
that could be called light, which was only
the faint glimmer of the stars, shewing
imperfectly the outline of the mountains,
the western towers of the castle and the
ramparts below, where a solitary sentinel
was pacing. What an image of repose
did this scene present! The sierce and
terrible passons, too, which so often agi‚à£tated
the inhabitants of this edifice, seemed
now hushed in sleep;‚Äîthose mysterious
workings, that rouse the elements of man's
nature into tempest‚Äîwere calm. Emily's
<PB N="447" REF="449"/>
heart was not so but her sufferings, though
deep, partook of the gentle character of
her mind. Hers was a silent anguish,
weeping, yet enduring; not the wild
energy of passion, inflaming imagination,
bearing down the barriers of reason and
living in a world of its own.</P>
<P>The air refreshed her, and she con‚à£tinued
at the casement, looking on the
shadowy scene, over which the planets
burned with a clear light, amid the deep
blue aether, as they silently moved in their
destined course. She remembered how
often she had gazed on them with her
dear father, how often he had pointed
out their way in the heavens, and ex‚à£plained
their laws; and these reflections
led to others, which, in an almost equal
degree, awakened her grief and astonish‚à£ment.</P>
<P>They brought a retrospect of all the
strange and mournful events, which had
occurred since she lived in peace wit her
parents. And to Emily, who had been so
<PB N="448" REF="450"/>
tenderly educated, so tenderly loved, who
once knew only goodness and happiness‚Äî
to her, the late late events and her present
situation‚Äîin a foreign land‚Äîin a remote
castle‚Äîsurrounded by vice and violence‚Äî
seemed more like the visions of a distem‚à£pered
imagination, thean the circumstances
of truth. She wept to think of what her
parents would have suffered, could they
have foreseen the events of her future life.</P>
<P>While she raised her streaming eyes to
heaven, she observed the same planet,
which she had seen in Languedoc, on the
night, preceding her father's death, rise
above the easten towers of the castle,
while she remembered the conversation,
which had passed, concerning the probable
state of departed souls; remembered, also
the solemn music she had heard, and to
which the tenderness of her spirits had, in
spite of her reason, given a supperstitious
meaning. At these recollections she wept
again, and continued musing when sud‚à£denly
the notes of sweet music passed on
<PB N="449" REF="451"/>
the air. A supperstitious dread stole over
her; she stood listening, for some mo‚à£ments,
in trembling expectation, and then
endeavoured to recollect her thoughts, and
to reason herself into compossure; but hu‚à£man
reason cannot establish her laws on
subjects, lost in the obscurity of imagina‚à£tion,
any more than the eye can ascertain
the form of objects, that only glimmer
through the dimness of night:</P>
<P>Her surprise, on hearing such soothing
and delicious sounds, was, at least, justis‚à£able;
for it was long‚Äîvery long, since she
had liftened to any thing like melody. The fierce trumpet and the shril fife were
the only instruments she had heard, since
her arrival, at Udolpho.</P>
<P>When her mind was somewhat more
composed, she tried to ascertain form what
quarter the sounds proceded, and thought
they came from below; but whether from
a room of the castle, or from the terrace,
she could not with certainty judge. Fear
and surprise now yielded to the enhant‚à£ment
<PB N="450" REF="452"/>
of a strain, that floated on the silent
night, with most and melancholy
sweetness. Suddenly, it seemed removed
to a distance, trembled saintly, and then
entirely ceased.</P>
<P>She continued to listen, sunk in that
Pleasing repose, which soft music leaves on
the mind‚Äîbut it came no more. Upon
this strange, circumstance her thoughts were
long engaged, for strange it certainly was
to hear mussic at midnight, when every
inhabitant of the castle had long since re‚à£tired
to rest, and in a place, where nothing
like harmony had been heard before, pro‚à£bably,
for many years. Long-suffering
had made her spirits peculiarly sensible to
terror, and liable to be afected by the il‚à£lusions
of superstition.‚ÄîIt now seemed to
her, as if her dead father had spoken to
her that strain, to inspire her with com‚à£fort
and confidence, on the subject, which
had then occupied her mind. Yet reason
told her, that this was a wild conjecture,
and she was inclined to dismiss it; but,
<PB N="451" REF="453"/>
with the inconsistency so natural, when
imagination guided the thoughts, she then
wavered towards a belief as wild. She
remembered the singular even, connected
with the castle, which had given it into
the possession of its present owner; and,
when she considered the mysterious man‚à£ner,
in which its late possessor had disap‚à£peared,
and that she had never since been
heard of, her mind was impressed with an
high degree of solemn awe; so that,
though there appeared no clue to connect
that event with the late music, she was
inclined fancifully to think they had some
relation to each other. At this conjecture,
a sudden chillness ran through her frame;
she looked fearfully upon the durkiness of
her chamber, and the dead silence, that
prevailed there, heightened to her fancy
its gloomy aspect.</P>
<P>At length, she left the casement, but
Her steps faltered, as she approached the
bed, and she stopped and looked round.
The single lamp, that burned in her spa‚à£cious
<PB N="452" REF="454"/>
chamebr, was expiring; for a mo‚à£Ment,
she shrunk from the darkness be‚à£yond;
and then, ashamed of the weakness,
Which, however, she could not wholly con‚à£quer,
went forward to the bed, where her
mind did not soon know the soothings of
sleep. She still mused on the late occur‚à£rence,
and looked with anxiety to the next
night, when, at the same hour, she deter‚à£mined
to watch whether the music re‚à£turned.
‚ÄúIf those founds were human,‚Äù
aid she, ‚ÄúI shall probably hear them
again.‚Äù</P>

<P>ANNETTE came almost breathless
To Emily's apartment in the morning. ‚ÄúO
Ma'ameselle!‚Äù said she, in broken sentences,
‚Äúwhat news I have to tell! I have found
out who the prisoner is‚Äîbut he'was no
prisoner, neither;‚Äîhe that was shut up in
the chamber I told you of. I must think
him a ghost, forsooth!‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWho was the prisoner?‚Äù enquired
Emily, while her thoughts glanced back
to the circumstance of the preceeding night.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou mistake, ma'am,‚Äù said Annette;
‚Äúhe was not a prisoner, after all.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWho is the person, then?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHoly Saints!‚Äù rejoined Annette;
‚ÄúHow I was surprised! Met him just
<PB N="454" REF="456"/>
now, on the rempart below, there. I ne‚à£ver
was so surprised in my life! Ah!
ma'amselle! This is a strange place! I
should never have done wondering, if I
was to live here an hundred years. But,
as I was saying, I met him just now on
the rampart, and I was thinking of nobody less than of him.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThis trifling is insupportable,‚Äù said
Emily; ‚Äúprythee, Annette, do nout torture
my patience any longer.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNay, ma'ameselle, guess‚Äîguess who
it was; it was somebody you know very
well.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI cannot guess,‚Äù said Emily impa‚à£tiently.</P>
<P>‚ÄúNay, ma'ameselle, I'll tell you some‚à£thing
to guess by‚ÄîA tall Signor, with a
Jongish face, who walks so stately, and
used to wear such a high feather in his hat;
and used often to look down upon the
ground, when people spoke to him; and
to look at people from under his eye‚à£brows,
as it were, all so dark and frown‚à£ing.
<PB N="455" REF="457"/>
You have seen him, often and often,
at Vinice, ma'am. Then he was so inti‚à£mate
with the Signor, too. And, now I
think of it, I wonder what he could be
afraid of in this lonely old castle, that he
shold shut himself up for. But he is come
abroad now, for I met him on the rampart
just, this minute. I trembled when I saw
him for I always was afraid of him, some‚à£how;
but I determined I would not let
him see it' so I went up to him, and made
him a low curtesy, 'You are welcome to
the castle, Signor Orsino, ' said I.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO, it was Signor Orsino, then!.‚Äù said
Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes ma'amselle, Signor Orsino, him‚à£self,
who caused that Venetian gentleman
to be killed, and had been popping about
from place to place, ever since, as I hear.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood God!‚Äù exclaimed Emily, re‚à£covering
from the shock of this intelli‚à£gnce;
‚Äúand is be come to Udolpho!
He does well to endeavour to conceal
himself.‚Äù</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="458"/>
‚ÄúYes ma'amselle, but if that was all,
this disolate palce would conceal him,
without his shutting himself up in one
room. Who would think of coming to
look for him here? I am sure I should as
soon think of going to look for any body
in the other world.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThere is some truth in that,‚Äù said
Emily, who would now have concluded it
Was Orsino's music, which she had heard,
on the preceding night, had she not
Known, that he had neither taste, or skill
in the art. But, though she was unwilling
to add to the bumber of Annette's sur‚à£prises,
by mentioning the subject of her
own she enquired, whether any person in
the castle played on a musical instrument?</P>
<P>‚ÄúO yes, ma'amselle! there is Benedetto
plays the great drum to admiration; and
then, there is Launcelor the trumpeter;
nay, for that mater, Lundovico himself
can play on the trumpet;‚Äîbut he is ill
now. I remember once‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P>Emily interrupted her; ‚ÄúHave you
<PB N="457" REF="459"/>
heard no other music since you came to
the castle‚Äînone last night?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy, did you hear any last night,
ma'amselle?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúEmily evaded this question, by repeat‚à£ing
her own.</P>
<P>‚ÄúWhy, no ma'am,‚Äù replied Annette;
‚ÄúI never heard any music here, I must
say, but the drums and the trumpert; and,
as for last night, I did nothing but dream
I saw my late lady's ghost.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYour late lady's,‚Äù said Emily in a
tremulous voice; ‚Äúyou have heard more,
then. Tell me‚Äîtell me all, Annette, I
entreat; tell me the worst at once.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúNay, ma'amselle, you know the worst
already.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI know nothing,‚Äù said Emily.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYes, you do, ma'amselle; you know,
that nobody knows any thing about her;
and it is plain, therefore, she is gone, the
way of the first lady of the castle‚Äînobody
ever knew any thing about her.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily leaned her head upon her hand,
<PB N="458" REF="460"/>
and was, for some time, silent; then, tell‚à£ing
Annette she wished to be along, the
latter left the room.</P>
<P>The remark of Annette had revived
Emily's terrible suspicion, concerning the
fate of Madame Montoni; and she re‚à£solved
to make another effort to obtain
certainty on this subject, by applying to
Montoni once more.</P>
<P>When Annette returned, a few hours
After, she told Emily, that the porter of
the castle wished very much to speak with
her, for that he had something of import‚à£ance
to say; her spirits had, however, of
late been so subject ot alarm, that any new
circumstance excited it; and this massage
from the porter, when her first surprise
was over, made her look round for some
lurking danger, the more suspiciously, per‚à£haps,
because she had frequently remarked
the unpleasant air and countenance of this
man. She now hesitated, whether to speak
with him, doubting even, that this request
was only a pretext to draw her into some
<PB N="459" REF="461"/>
danger; but a llittle reflection shewed her
the improbabilty of this, and she blushed
at her weak fears.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI will speak to him, Annette,‚Äù said
she; ‚Äúdesire him to come to the corridor immediately.‚Äù</P>
<P>Annette deprted, and soon after re‚à£turned.</P>
<P>‚ÄúBarnardine, ma'amselle,‚Äù said she,
‚Äúdare not come to the corridor, left he
should be discovered, it is so far from his
post; and he dare not even leave the gates
for a moment now; but, if you will come
to him at the portl, through some round‚à£about
passages he told me of, without
crossing the courts, he has that to tell,
which will surprise you. But you must
not come through the courts, left the Sig‚à£nor
should see you.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, neither approving these ‚Äúround‚à£about
passages,‚Äù nor the other part of the
request, now positively refused to go.
‚ÄúTell him,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúif he had any
thing of consequence to impart, I will
<PB N="460" REF="462"/>
hear him in the corridor, whenever he has
an opportunity of coming thither.‚Äú</P>
<P>Annette went to deliver this message,
and was absent a considerable time. When
she returned,‚Äù It won't do, ma'amselle,'
said she. ‚ÄúBarnardine has been consider‚à£ing
all this time what can be done, for it
is as much as his place is worth to leave
his post now. But, if you will come to
the east rampart in the dusk of the even‚à£ing,
he can, perhaps, steal away, and tell
you all he has to say.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily was surprised and alarmed, at the
secrency which this man seemed to think so
necessary, and hesitated whether to meet
him, till, considering, that he might mean
to warn her of some serious danger, she re‚à£solved
to go.</P>
<P>‚ÄúSoon after sun-set,‚Äù said she, ‚ÄúI will
be at the end of the east rampart. But
then the watch will be set,‚Äù she added,
recollecting herself, ‚Äúand how can Bar‚à£nadine
pass unobserved?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThat is just what I said to him,
<PB N="461" REF="463"/>
ma'am, and he answered me, that he had
the key of the gate, at the end of the ram‚à£part,
that leads towards the courts, and
could let himself through that way; and
as for the sentinels, there were none at this
end of the terrace, because the place is
guraded enough by the high walls of the
castle, and the east turret; and he said
thosse at the other end were too far off to
see him, if it was pretty duskyish.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Emily, ‚ÄúI must hear
what he has to tell; and, therefore, desire
you will go with me to the terrace, this evening.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHe desired is might be pretty duskyish,
ma'amselle,‚Äù repeated Annette, ‚Äúbecause
of the watch."</P>
<P>Emily paused, and then said she would
Be on the terrace, an hour after sun-set;‚Äî
‚Äúand tell Barnardin,‚Äù she added,‚Äù to be
punctual to the time; for that I, also, may
be observed by Signor Montoni. Where
is the Signor? I would speak with him.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúHe is in the cedar chamber,ma'am,
<PB N="462" REF="464"/>
councelling with the other Signors. He is
going to give them a sort of a treat to-day,
to make up for what passed at the last, I
suppose; the people are all very busy in the kitchen.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily now enquired, if Montoi ex‚à£pected
any new guests? and Annette be‚à£lived
that he did not. ‚ÄúPoor Ludo‚à£vico!‚Äù
added she, ‚Äúwould be as merry
as the best of them, if he was well; but
he may recover yet. Count Morano was
wounded as bad, as he, and he is got well
again, and is gone back to Venice.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIs he so?‚Äù said Emily, ‚Äúwhen did
you hear this?‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI heard is, last night, ma'ameselle, but I forgot to tell it.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily asked some further uestions, and
then, desiring Annette would observe and
Inform her, when Montoni was alone, the
girl went to deliver her message to Barnardine.</P>
<P>Montoni was, however, so much en‚à£gaged,
during the whole day, that Emily
<PB N="463" REF="465"/>
had no opportunity of seeking a release
form her terrible suspense, concerning her
aunt. Annette was employed in watching
his steps, and in attending upon Ludovico, whom she, assitsted by Caterina, nursed
with the utmost care; and Emily was, of
course, left much alone. Her thoughts
dwelt often on the message of the porter,
and were employed in conjecturing the
subject, that occasioned it, which she some‚à£times
imagined concerned the fate of Ma‚à£dame
Montoni; at others, that it related
to some personal dange, which threatened
herself. The cautious secrecy which Bar‚à£nardine
observed in his conduct, inclined
her to believe the latter.</P>
<P>As the hour of appointment drew near,
Her impatience increased. At length, the
Fun set; she heard the passing steps of the
sentinels going to their posts; and waited
only for Annette to accompany her to th
terrace, who, soon after, came, and they
descended together. When Emily ex‚à£pressed
apprehensions of meeting Montoni,
<PB N="464" REF="466"/>
or some of his guests, ‚ÄúO, there is no
fear of that, ma'amselle,‚Äù said Annette,
‚Äúthey are all set in to seasting yet, and
that Barnardne knows.‚Äù</P>
<P>They reached the first terrace, where the
sentinels demanded who passed; and
Emily, having answered, walked on to the
east rampat, at the entrance of which
they were again stopped; and, having
again replied, were permitted to proceed.
But Emilydid not like to expose herself
to the discretion of these men, at such an
hour; and impatient ot withdraw from
the situatin, she stepped hastily on in
search of Barnardine. He was not yet come.
She leaned pensively on the wall of the
rampart, and waited for him. The gloom
of twilight sat deep on the surrounding ob‚à£Jects,
blending in soft confusion the valley,
the mountains, and the woods, whose tall
heads, stirred by the evening breeze, gave
cept a faint, faint chorus of distant voices,
that arose from within the castle.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="467"/>
‚ÄúWhat voices are those?‚Äù said Emily,
as she fearfully listened.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt is only the Signor and his guests,
carousing,‚Äù replied Annette.</P>
<P>‚ÄúGood God!‚Äù tought Emily, ‚Äúcan
this man's heart be so gay, when he has
made another being so wretched; if, in‚à£deed,
my aunt is yet suffered to feel her
wretchedness? O! whatever are my own
sufferings, may my heart never, never be
hardened against those of other!"</P>
<P>She looked up with a sensation of horror,
to the east turret, near which she then
stood; a light glimmered through the
grates of the lower chameber, but those of the up‚à£per
one were dark. Presently, she percieved
a person moving with a lampacross the lower
room; but this circumstance revived no
hope, concerning Madame Montoni, whom
she had vainly sought in that apartment,
which had appeared to contain only sol‚à£diers'
accoutrements. Emily, however, de‚à£termined
to attempt the outer door of the
turreet, as soon as Barnardine should with‚à£draw;
<PB N="466" REF="468"/>
and, if it was unfastened, to make
another effort to discover her aunt.</P>
<P>The moments passed, but still Barnar‚à£dine
did not appear; and Emily, becom‚à£ing
uneasy, hesitated whether to wait any
longer. She would have sent Annette to
the portal to hasten him, but feared to be
left alone, for it was now almost dark, and
a melancholy streak of red, that still lin‚à£gered
in the west, was the only vestige of
departed day. The strong interest, how‚à£ever,
which Barnardine's message had
awakened, overcame other apprehensions,
and still detained her.</P>
<P>While she was cnjecturing with Annette
What could thus occasion his absence, they'
heard a key turn in the lock of the gate
near them, and presently saw man ad‚à£vancing.
It was Barnardine, of whom
Emily hastily enquired what he had to
communicate, and desired, that he would
tell her quickly, ‚Äúfor I am chilled with
this evening air,‚Äù said she.</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou must dismis you maid, lady,‚Äù
<PB N="467" REF="469"/>
said the man in a voice, the deep tone of
which shocked her, ‚Äúwhat I have to tell
is to you only.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, after some hesitation, desred
Annette to withdraw to a little distance.
‚ÄúNow, my friend, what would you say?‚Äù
He was silent a moment, as if consider‚à£ing,
and then said‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúThat which would cost me my place,
at least, if it came to the Signor's ears.
You must promise, lady, that nothing
shall ever make you tell a syllable of the
matter; I have been trusted in this affair,
and, if it was known, that I betrayed
my trust, my life, perhaps, might an‚à£swer
it. But I was concerned for you,
lady, and I resolved to tell you.‚Äù He
paused‚Äî</P>
<P>Emily thanked him, assured him that
he might repose on her discretion, and en‚à£treated
him to dispatch.</P>
<P>‚ÄúAnnette told us in the hall how
unhappy you was about Signora Mon‚à£toni,
<PB N="468" REF="470"/>
and how much you wished to know
what was become of her.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúMost true,‚Äù said Emily eagerly,‚Äù and
you can inform me. I conjure you tell me
the worst, without hesitation.‚Äù She rested
her trembling arm upon the wall.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI can tell you,‚Äù said Barnardine, and
paused.‚Äî</P>
<P>Emily had no power to enforce her en‚à£treaties.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI <HI>can</HI> tell you,‚Äù resumed Barnardine,
‚Äî‚Äúbut‚Äî</P>
<P>‚ÄúBut what?‚Äù exclaimed Emily, reco‚à£vering
her resolution.</P>
<P>‚ÄúHere I am, ma'amselle,‚Äù said Annette,
who, having heard the eager tone, in which
Emily pronounced these words, came run‚à£ning
towards her.</P>
<P>‚ÄúRetire!‚Äù said Barnardine, sternly;
‚Äúyou are not wanted;‚Äù and, as Emily
said nothing, Annette obeyed.</P>
<P>‚ÄúI <HI>can</HI> tell you,‚Äù repeated the porter,
‚Äî‚Äúbut I know not how‚Äîyou was af‚à£flicted
before.‚Äù‚Äî</P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="471"/>
‚ÄúI am prepared for the worst, my
friend,‚Äù said Emily, in a firm and solemn
voice. ‚ÄúI can support any certainty bet‚à£ter
than this suspense.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell, Signora, if that is the case
you shall hear.‚ÄîYou know, I suppose,
that the Signor and his lady used some‚à£times
to disagree. It is none of my con‚à£cernes
to enquire what it was about, but I
believe you know it was so.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Emily, ‚Äúproceed.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúThe Signor, it seems, had lately been
very wrath against her. I saw all, and
heard all,‚Äîa great deal more than people
thoght for; but it was none of my busI‚à£ness,
so I said nothing. A few days ago,
the Signor sent for me. 'barnardine,' says
he, 'you are‚Äîan honest man, I think I
can trust you.' I assured his Excellenza
that he could. 'Then,' says he, as near
as I can remmber, 'I have an affair in
hand, which I want you to assist me in.'‚Äî
Then he told me what I was to do; but
<PB N="470" REF="472"/>
that I shall say nothing about‚Äîit con‚à£cerned
only the Signora.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúO Heavens!‚Äù exclaimed Emily‚Äî
‚Äúwhat have you done?‚Äù</P>
<P>Barnardine hesitated, and was silent.
‚ÄúWhat fiend could tempt him, or you,
to such an act!‚Äù cried Emily, chilled with horror, and scarcely able to support her
fainting spirits.</P>
<P>‚ÄúIt was a fiend,‚Äù said Barnardine in a
gloomy tone of voice. They were now both
silent;‚ÄîEmily had not courage to enquire
further, and Barnardine seemed to shrink
from telling more. At length he said,
‚ÄúIt is of no use to think of the past; the
Signor was cruel enough, but he would
be obeyed. What signified my refusing?
He would have found others, who had no
scruples.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúYou have murdered her, then!‚Äù said
Emily, in a hollow and inward voice‚Äî
‚ÄúI am talking with a murderer!‚Äù barnar‚à£dine
stood silent; while Emily turned from
him, and attempted to leave the place.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="473"/>
‚ÄúStay, lady!‚Äù said he‚Äù You deserve
to think so still‚Äîsince you can believe me
capable of such a deed.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúIf you are innocent, tell me quickly,‚Äù
said Emily, in saint accents, ‚Äúfor I feel
I shall not be able to hear you long‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúI will tell you no more,‚Äù said he, and
walked away. Emily had just strength
enough to bid him stay, and then to call
Annette, on whose arm she leaned, and
they walked slowly up the rampart, till
they heard steps behind them. It was
Barnardine again.</P>
<P>‚ÄúSend away the girl,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúand
I will tell you more.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúShe must not go,‚Äù said Emily; ‚Äúwhat
you have to say, she may hear.‚Äù</P>
<P>‚ÄúMay she so, lady? said he.‚Äù You
shall know no more, then,' and he was
going, though slowly, when Emily's anxi‚à£ety,
overcoming the resentment and fear,
which the man's behaviour had roused,
she desired him to stay, and bade Annette
retire.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="474"/>
‚ÄúThe Signora is alive,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúfor
me. She is my prisoner, though; his Ex‚à£cellenza
has shut her up in the chamber
over the great gates of the court, and I
have the charge of her. I was going to
have told you, you might see her‚Äîbut
now‚Äî‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily, relieved from an unutterable
load of anguish by this speech, had now
only to ask Barnardine's forgiveness, and
to conjure, that he would let her visit her
aunt.</P>
<P>He comlied with less reluctance, than
she expected, and told her, that, if she
would repair, on the following night, when
the Signor was retired to rest, to the pos‚à£tern-gate
of the castle, she should, perhaps,
see Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>Amid all the thankfulness, which Emily
Felt, for this concession, she thought she
Observed a malicious triumph in his man‚à£Ner,
when he pronounced the last words;
but, in the next moment, she dismissed
the thought, and, having again thanked
<PB N="473" REF="475"/>
him, commended her aunt to his pity, and
assured him, tha she would herself reward
him, and would be punctual to her ap‚à£pointment;
she bade him good night, and
retired, unobserved, to her chamber. It
was a considerable time, before the tumult
of joy, which Barnardine's unexpected in‚à£tellignece
had occasioned, allowed Emily
to think with clearness, or to be onscious
of the real dangers, that still s;urrounded
Madame Montoni and herself. When
this agitation subsided, she perceived, that
her aunt was yet the prisoner of a man, to
whose vengeance, or avarice, she might
fall a sacrifice; and, when she further con‚à£sidered
the savage aspect of the person,
who was appointed to guard Madame
Montoni, her doom appeared to be al‚à£ready
sealed, for the countenance of Bar‚à£nardine
seemed to bear the stamp of a mur‚à£derer;
and, when she had looked upon it,
she felt inclined to believe, that there was
no deed, however black, which he might
not be prevailed upon to execute. These
<PB N="474" REF="476"/>
reflections brought to her remembrance the
tone of voice, in which he had promised
to grant her request to see his prisoner;
and she mused upon it long in uneasiness
and doubt. Sometimes, she even hesitated,
whether to trust herself with him at the
lonely hour he had appointed; and once,
and only once, it struck her, that Madame
Montoni, might be already murdered, and
that this ressian was appointed to decoy
herself to some secret place, where her life
also was to be sacrificed to the avarice of
Montoni, who then would claim securely
the contested estates in Languedoc. The
considertaion of the enormity of such guilt
did, at length, relieve her from the belief
of its probability, but not from all the
doubts and fears, which a recollection of
Barnardine's manner had occasioned. From
these subjects, her thoughts, at length,
passed to other; and,as the evening ad‚à£vanced,
she remembered, with somewhat
more than surprise, the music she had
heared, on the preceding night, and now
<PB N="475" REF="477"/>
awaited its return, with more than curio‚à£sity.</P>
<P>She distinguished till a late hour, the
distant carousals of Montoni and his com‚à£panions
‚Äîthe loud contest, the dissolute
laugh and the choral song, that made the
halls re-echo. At length, she heard the
heavy gates of the castle shut for the night
and those sounds instantly sunk into a
silence, which was disturbed only by the
whispering steps of persons, passing through
the galleries to their remote rooms. Emily
now judging it to be about the time, when
she had heard the music, on the preceding
night, dismissed Annette, and gently open‚à£ed
the casement to watch for its return.
The planet she had so particularly noticed,
at the recurrence of the music, was not yet
risen; but, with superstitious weakness,
she kept her eyes fixed on that part of the
hemisphere, where it would rise, almost
expecting, that, when it appeared, the
sounds would return. At length, it came,
serenely bright, over the eastern towers of
<PB N="476" REF="478"/>
the castle. Her heart trembled, when she
perceived it, and she had scarcely courage
to remain at the casement, lest the return‚à£ing
music should confirm her terror, and
subdue the little strength, she yer retained.
The clock soon after struck one, and.,
knowing this to be about the time, when
the sounds had occurred, she sat down in
a chair, near the casement,and endeavour‚à£ed
to compose her spirits; but the anxiety
of expectation yet disturbed them. Every
thing, however, remained still; she heard
only the solitary step of a sentinel, and the
lulling murmur of the woods below, and
she again leaned from the casement, and
again looked, as if for intelligence, to the
planet, which was now risen high above
the towers.</P>
<P>Emily continued to listen, but no music
came. ‚ÄúThose were surely no mortal
sounds!‚Äù said she recollecting their en‚à£trancing
melody. ‚ÄúNo inhabitant of this
castle could utter such; and, where is the
feeling, that could modulate such exquisite
<PB N="477" REF="479"/>
expression? We all know, that it has been
assirmed celestial sounds have sometimes
been heard on earth. Father Pierre and
father Antoine declared, that they had
sometimes heard them in the stillness of
night, when they along were waking to
offer their orisons to heaven. Nay, my
dear father himself, once said, that, soon
after my mother's death,as he lay watch‚à£ful
in grief, sounds of uncommon sweet‚à£ness
called him from his bed; and, on
opening his window, he heard lofty music
pass along the midnight air. It soothed
him, he said; he looked up with confi‚à£dence
to heaven, and resigned her to his
God.‚Äù</P>
<P>Emily paused to weep at this recollec‚à£tion.
‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù resumed she, ‚Äúpehaps,
those strains I heard were sent to comfort,
‚Äîto encourage me! Never shall I forget
those I heard, at this hour, in Langue‚à£doc!
Perhaps, my father watched over
me, at this moment!‚Äù She wept again in
<PB N="478" REF="480"/>
tenderness. Thus passed the hour in watch‚à£fulness
and solemn thought; but no sounds
returned; and, after remaining at the case‚à£ment,
till the light tint of dawn began to
edge the mountain-tops and steal upon
the night-shade, she concluded, that they
would not return, and retired reluctantly
to repose.</P>
