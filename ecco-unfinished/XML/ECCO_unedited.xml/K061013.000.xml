NEW PAPER, &amp;c,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE greatest respect which cou'd possibly
have been shown to you by the People
of <HI>England,</HI> had been to have let your
Actions have sunk into forgetfulness, and
in kindness to you, have let neither you
nor your Deeds have been nam'd any more in your
Native Country.</P>
<P>But since those People who (in your House) were
so restless in their Endeavours to ruin us, are not asham'd
to undertake your Defence: We are oblig'd in the just
Vindication of our Native right further to expose your
Errors, than in Charity to your Memory we design'd.</P>
<P>We are bound to let the People know, that a late
Pamphlet Printed by your own Club, and industriously
spread over the whole Nation, Entituled, <HI>A Defence of
the last Parliament,</HI> is calculated to Wheedle the People
to Choose you again.</P>
<P>But we hope their Eyes will be open'd. And we
wonder you can suggest that the Free-holders shou'd so
contradict the Language of their Addresses, and be found
so to Mock the King and the Nation, as to Address
you out of Doors, and then put you in again them∣selves:
if they shou'd act so unaccountably, <HI>Kings for
the future will the better know what</HI> English <HI>Addressing
signifies.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The same Hand that presented your Speaker with a
Certain <HI>Memorial,</HI> call'd the <HI>Legion Paper,</HI> written, as
Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> very well knows, in a hand that stood the
Wrong Way; <HI>that Paper</HI> which came, as is said, from
Two Hundred Thousand <HI>Englishmen; that Paper</HI> which
frighted Mr. <HI>P.</HI> and Mr. <HI>H—t,</HI> and several others into
the Country; <HI>that Paper</HI> which Mr. <HI>Howe</HI> in a lamentable
Tone told the House, made him <HI>from the sense of his
own Guilt,</HI> afraid of his Life; <HI>that Paper</HI> which put you
all so besides your selves, as to make a sensless Ad∣dress
to His Majesty, to defend himself against His
People; which Address you were afterwards asham'd
to present; <HI>that Paper</HI> which you had so little Wit as
to read, and so much Modesty, <HI>that is Guilt,</HI> as to blush
at; <HI>that Paper</HI> which made you wish you had never
Committed the <HI>Kentish</HI> Petitioners, and made you afraid
to prosecute them; <HI>that Paper</HI> which made you clap up
the Sessions in such haste, as made the Lords baffle you,
and all the Nation asham'd of you; <HI>that Paper</HI> which
made you pass one good Vote at parting, to <HI>Desire the King
to make Alliances,</HI> &amp;c. which some of your Members call'd
a Sweetner, that you might not be afraid to go home:
The same hand presents you with this Paper, as the true
sense of the Nation concerning you.</P>
<P>The Author does not come <HI>Incognito</HI> as before, but
you may see it at the Corner of every Street, every
Bookseller can sell it you, every <HI>Englishman</HI> has it in his
Head; and your Humble Servant the Author is to be
spoken with at his House as constantly as a Quack-Doctor,
from Eight to Twelve in the Morning, and from Two
till Nine at Night.</P>
<P>It had been time for your Defender to have Voted
the Author of <HI>Legion</HI> to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> when the Charge there
given you in the Name of the People of <HI>England</HI> had
been clear'd.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
And the Author tells you, he will be content with
that Fate when you will fairly disprove one Article of
that yet unanswer'd Paper.</P>
<P>There you may see, Gentlemen, that the Nation's
Exceptions at your Behaviour, are not to be reduc'd to
Three Heads of your own making; the first of which
no Body never charg'd on you, but your new Defender;
but if we mistake not, there are no less than Fifteen
Articles of Illegal Proceedings, from one of which, you,
nor all the Men alive, cannot fairly parge you, which
for your better Satisfaction are here transcrib'd.</P>
<P>“I. To Raise Funds for Money, and Declare by
borrowing Clauses, that whosoever Advances Money on
those Funds, shall be Re-imburs'd out of the next Aids,
if the Funds fall short; and then give Subsequent Funds,
without Transferring the Deficiency of the former, is
a horrible Cheat on the Subject who lent the Money; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Breach of Publick Faith, and destructive to the Honour
and Credit of Parliaments.”</P>
<P>“II. To Imprison Men who are not your own Mem∣bers,
by no proceedings but a Vote of your House, and
to continue them in Custody <HI>Sine Die</HI> is Illegal; a Noto∣rious
Breach of the Liberty of the People; Setting up
a Dispensing Power in the House of Commons, which
your Fathers never pretended to; bidding defiance to the
<HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, which is the Bulwark of Personal
Liberty, Destructive of the Laws, and Betraying the
Trust repos'd in you. <HI>The King at the same time being
Obliged to ask you Leave to continue in Custody the Horrid
Assassinators of His Person.</HI>”</P>
<P>“III. Committing to Custody those Gentlemen, who
at the Command of the People (whose Servants you
are) and in a Peaceable way put you in mind of your
Duty, is Illegal and Injurious; Destructive of the Sub∣jects
Liberty of Petitioning for Redress of Grievances,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
which has by all Parliaments before you, been acknow∣ledged
to be their undoubted Right.”</P>
<P>“IV. Voting a Petition from the Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI>
Insolent; is Ridiculous and Impertinent, because the
Free-holders of <HI>England</HI> are your Superiours; and is a
contradiction in it Self, and a Contempt of the <HI>English</HI>
Freedom, and contrary to the Nature of Parliamentary
Power.”</P>
<P>“V. Voting People Guilty of Bribery and Ill Practices,
and Committing them as aforesaid, without Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, and
then upon submission and kneeling to your House, dis∣charging
them; Exacting Exorbitant Fees by your Officers,
is Illegal, Betraying the Justice of the Nation, Selling
the Liberty of the Subject, encouraging the Extortion
and Villany of Goalers and Officers; and discontinuing
the Legal Prosecutions of Offenders, in the ordinary
Course of Law.”</P>
<P>“VI. Prosecuting the Crime of Bribery in some to serve
a Party, and then proceed no further, tho' proof lay
before you, is Partial and Unjust; and a Scandal upon
the Honour of Parliaments.”</P>
<P>“VII. Voting the Treaty of Partition Fatal to <HI>Europe,</HI>
because it gave so much of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions to the
<HI>French,</HI> and not concern your selves to prevent their
taking Possession of it all. Deserting the <HI>Dutch</HI> when
the <HI>Prench</HI> are at their Doors, till it be almost too late
to help them; is Unjust to our Treaties, and unkind
to our Confederates; Dishonourable to the <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion,
and shews you very negligent of the Safety of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and of our Protestant Neighbours.”</P>
<P>“VIII. Ordering immediate Hearings to trifling Petiti∣ers,
to please Parties in Elections; and <HI>Postpone</HI> the Pe∣tition
of a Widow for the Blood of her Murthered
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Daughter, without giving it a reading; is an Illegal
delay of Justice, dishonourable to the Publick Justice of
the Nation.”</P>
<P>“IX. Addressing the King to displace His Friends up∣on
bare Surmises, before any Legal Tryal or Article
prov'd; is Illegal, an Inverting the Law, and making
Execution go before Judgment; contrary to the true
sense of the Law, which esteems every Man a good Man
till something appears to the contrary.”</P>
<P>“X. Delaying proceedings upon Capital Impeachments,
to blast the Reputation of the Persons, without pro∣ving
the Fact; is Illegal and Oppressive, Destructive of
the Liberty of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> a delay of Justice, and a
reproach to Parliaments.”</P>
<P>“XI. Suffering Sawey and indecent Reproaches upon
His Majesties Person, to be publickly made in your
House; particularly by that Impudent Scandal of Par∣liaments
<HI>J—n H—w,</HI> without shewing such resent∣ments
as your ought to do. The said <HI>H—w</HI> saying
openly, <HI>That His Majesty had made a Felonious Trea∣ty
to Rob his Neighbours; insinuating that the Partition
Treaty</HI> (which was every way as just as blowing up
one Man's House to save another) <HI>was a Combina∣tion
of the King to Rob the Crown of</HI> Spain <HI>of its due;</HI>
This is making a <HI>Billingsgate</HI> of the House, and set∣ting
up to <HI>Bully</HI> your Soveraign, contrary to the in∣tent
and meaning of that freedom of Speech which you
claim as a Right, is scandalous to Parliaments, Undu∣tiful
and Unmannerly, and a Reproach to the whole
Nation.”</P>
<P>“XII. Your S—r Exacting the Exorbitant rate of
10 <HI>l. per Diem</HI> for the V—s, and giving the Printer in∣couragement
to raise it on the People, by selling them
at <HI>4d. per</HI> Sheet; is an Illegal, and Arbitrary exaction,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
dishonourable to the House, and burthensome to the
People.”</P>
<P>“XIII. Neglecting still to pay the Nation's Debts
Compounding for Interest, and <HI>Postponing</HI> Petitions; is
Illegas, Dishonourable, and destructive of the Publick
Faith.”</P>
<P>“XIV. Publickly neglecting the great Work of Re∣formation
of Manners; though often pres'd to it by the
King; to the great dishonour of God, and encourage∣ment
of Vice, is a neglect of your Duty, and an abuse
of the Trust repos'd in you, by God, His Majesty and
the People.”</P>
<P>“XV. Being Scandalously Vitious your selves, both in
your Morals, and Religion; Lewd in Life, and Erroneous
in Doctrine, having publick Blasphemers and Impudent
denyers of the Divinity of our Saviour, among you, and
suffering them unreproved and unpunished, to the infi∣nite
regret of all good Christians, and the Just abhor∣rence
of the whole Nation.”</P>
<P>The best Shift that ever was found yet to help you
was by Sir <HI>Humphrey Mackworth,</HI> that you are not to be
told your Faults, altho they are true.</P>
<Q>Forbid it Heaven that Truth shou'd ever be
Subjected to Ʋsurp'd Authority.</Q>
<P>And are you the Men who want to be Chosen again,
who think you deserve so much favour from the Na∣tion,
as to be trusted again with those Liberties you
betray'd? With what Face can you desire the People
shou'd be so blind to their own Interest?</P>
<P>What we have now to say, was true of you some time
ago, but you had so fenc'd your selves by your Usurp'd
unlimited dispensing Power, and by Sir <HI>Hump. Machworth</HI>'s
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
new Doctrine, that an Honest Man could not inform
the World what you were, without the Danger of be∣ing
abus'd by your Sergeant, and being refus'd the benefit
of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, and confin'd in a Garre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
during the Arbitrary Pleasure of your House.</P>
<P>But since you are Dissolv'd, and now reduc'd to an
Equality with your Fellow Subjects, we think the least
we can do, is to let you know, the Free-holders of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
are sensible of your Behaviour, and those who are
not, may be inform'd from the following Particulars.</P>
<P>You are the Men who sitting in the Leates of Coun∣cil,
representing the good People of <HI>England,</HI> vested
with Legislative Authority, and having the Liberties
and Estates of your Native Country put into your
Hands, mis-improv'd that unlimited Power to oppress the
very People who chose you to defend them.</P>
<P>By unjustly lmprisoning the Free-holders of <HI>England,</HI>
for coming to put you in mind of your Duty, and op∣pressing
such as you had no power to Touch, they being
under the immediate protection of the known Laws.</P>
<P>By partial proceedings against such Persons as the
prevailing Party thought fit to expel, as guilty of
Bribery, Wisely, tho' Unjustly declining the Proceedings
against others more Guilty, whose assistance to do Evil
you wanted in the House.</P>
<P>By not refusing to Declare War without Ground,
for no Body desir'd it, but Delaying the Publick Affairs,
till the Enemy was at the Door. <HI>Flanders</HI> possest, <HI>Por∣tugal</HI>
discourag'd and fallen off, the <HI>Dutch</HI> besieg'd, and
His Majesty oblig'd to turn Sollicitor, and to your
Shame be it spoken, permitted almost to beg you to
make good the Leagues and Stipulations of his Pre∣decessors.</P>
<P>By Impeaching Members of the House of Lords, and
shuffling off their Tryal, by miserable Shifts, and ridi∣culous
Punctilioes; the end being to blast their Repu∣tation,
not prove the Fact, that they might be put
out of Places, and your selves put in.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
By Quarrelling with the House of Lords, at a time
when Peace at home was the most necessary thing in
the World, at the same time the Circumstances being
Unjust, and the Management ridiculous.</P>
<P>You are the Men, who since the last recess have
scattered your selves about the Kingdom, to make your
selves Advocates for your own Proceedings, and if
possible to reconcile the People to your Actions, and
possess them with a Belief of your Honesty; a certain
sign your Deeds would not speak for themselves, who
in all your foolish Discourses take upon you to Vil∣lifie
and Reproach the King, Expose his Servants
and Ministers, though your Accusation to this Hour
remain unprov'd.</P>
<P>Who so far from giving the People any hopes that
you wou'd recollect your selves against another Session,
and proceed to discharge your Duty, and the Trust
repos'd in you with more Fidelity and Moderation, have
fill'd the Town with your Threatnings of what you
wou'd do at your coming together again.</P>
<P>How you wou'd begin where you left off with your
Disputes against the House of Lords?</P>
<P>How you wou'd make the King agree to clip the
Wings of their Authority, or give him no Money?</P>
<P>How you wou'd enter upon no Business till you had hum∣bled
the Lords, that if they insisted on their Priviledges,
the blame of the Delays might lie upon them, and so
find a way at one Act to throw your spleen at the Peers,
and at the King together?</P>
<P>You are the Men to whom we owe the many Neu∣trallities
of the Princes, and Circles of the Empire, and
<HI>Italy,</HI> the League of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> with the <HI>French,</HI> and
the <HI>French</HI> King's venturing to acknowledge another
King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas the Fears of your being Corrupted by a <HI>French</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, made our Friends abroad shy of Engaging in the
Protestant Interest; and the hopes of it has on the other
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
hand encourag'd the <HI>French</HI> to insult the Christian
World, and bid faid for all the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas a Creature of your Speakers, and a fawning
Dependant upon the Party, who scribling for Favour,
had the Impudence to affirm in Print, <HI>That leagues
and Confederacies, Allies and Foreign Treaties were useless
and insignificant to</HI> England; <HI>that we were an Istant se∣perated
from the rest of the World independant of any Body;
And if all the World Leagu'd against us, if we were true to
our selves we need not care. As to our Trade, our Manu∣factures
had the Command of the World, and wou'd force
their way, and our Fleet could protect, and continue our
Trade in spight of all Mankind; and that the concern we
had in the safety of our Neighbours, was only pretence to raise
Armies to Enslave us at home.</HI></P>
<P>You are the Men that have acted, as if ye believ'd
this preposterous Doctrine, endeavouring to possess the
People with Fears and Jealousies of Slavery at home,
under the Protection and Government of the only King
in the World, that ever sincerely sought, and effectually
restor'd our Freedom.</P>
<P>But that we may do Justice also to those Gentlemen,
who to their utmost oppos'd all your Treacherous
proceedings before we come more freely to tell you our
Minds: We must plainly mark you out, that the In∣nocent
may not suffer with the Guilty.</P>
<P>I. Such of you (for such as these were among you)
who having been purchas'd <HI>in former Reigns</HI> by Court-Pensions,
to assist Arbitrary Princes, joyn'd with them
to Enslave us; selling the Liberties of your Country
to Gratifie the Lust of Dominion, and the Projects of
<HI>Popish Councils.</HI></P>
<P>II. Such of you (who being Poyson'd with Arbitra∣ry
Principles) gave your Consents to submit all our
Laws and Charters to a dispensing Authority in the
Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
III. Such of you as having forgot that the Original
of all Right is deriv'd from, and rested in the People,
had Complimented your Native Country out of her
Priviledges, and Elevated our Kings with a Divine right
of Government, which neither God, Nature, or the
People ever gave them.</P>
<P>IV. Such who having thus been the Tools of Ty∣ranny
in former Reigns, have still deluded the Credu∣lity
of the People, and by great Interests in small
Burroughs, have obtain'd again to be trusted in Parlia∣ment
with the People's Safety.</P>
<P>V. Such of you who having no Estate, nor able to
pay your own Debts, should put such a Banter upon
the People, as to desire to be Examiners of the Na∣tions
Accounts without a Sallary; as if we did not
know that if the Nation did not pay them, some body
else must.</P>
<P>VI. Such of you who brib'd by Foreign Hopes, and
<HI>French</HI> Money, expect to make your Fortunes at the
Expence of the Nation.</P>
<P>VII. Such as are blindly led by the Party, who pur∣sue
these Devilish Designs, whereas they are trusted
by their Country not to act by the Directions of others,
but ought either to be capable of Judging, and Acting
for the People that chose them, or be sent home in
Hanging Sleeves, and a Slaberring-Bib.</P>
<P>VIII. Such of you as shou'd ha' been Hang'd at the
Revolution for your formerly betraying your Coun∣try,
and are now like a true Thief, striving to Cut their
Throats who sav'd you from the Gallows.</P>
<P>IX. Such of you who cry out of the People of 41, for
raising War against, and deposing their Soveraign, but are
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
just 60 Years after going in the same Steps, and had
you the same Prince to do with, wou'd before now
ha' brought it to the Sword.</P>
<P>These are the Men which makes the People of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
give Thanks to God and the King, that has freed
them form the Ruin design'd for them by their own
Representatives.</P>
<P>'Tis for your Sakes that is come to pass in <HI>England,</HI>
which never was heard of before, that the People
should have recourse to the <HI>King</HI> to save them from be∣ing
undone by the <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>What means all the Language of the Addresses which
Croud from the extremest part of the Nation? That
when ever it shall please his Majesty to call a New Par∣liament,
they will endeavour to chuse <HI>such and such.</HI></P>
<P>Had you not been a Parliament in being, and your
unreasonable and wrong Extended power formidable,
'tis presum'd the Language of those Addresses would
have been for God sake, and for the Nation's sake, to
beseech His Majesty to call a New Parliament, and to
promise to choose Honester Men than they did before.</P>
<P>As for all those honest Gentlemen who had the mis∣fortune
to be over-power'd by your Numbers, to be
huff'd, ralli'd, and Bear-beated by the Clamours and
Noise of the Multitude; but still to their power, op∣posed
your Wicked Designs, and Discharg'd their Du∣ty
to their Country.</P>
<P>The Grateful remembrance of their Fidelity will re∣main
in the Hearts of every Honest <HI>Englishman,</HI> and be
on every occasion call'd to mind, and rewarded to them
and their Posterity.</P>
<P>We unanimously are of opinion, that the whole Na∣tion
ought to keep a Day of Rejoycing, and Solemn
Thanksgiving to God, who has put it into the Heart
of His Majesty once more to save this Nation from De∣struction,
by divesting you of that Power which you so
visibly exacted to the Ruine of your Country.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
That His Majesty has listned to the Voice of Things,
as well as to the Voice of his People, and having a
Discerning Judgment, has timely Discovered your Wick∣ed
Designs, and timely prevented the Confusion your
proceedings could ha' brought upon us.</P>
<P>That His Majesty has once more put it into the
Power of the English Free-holders to choose again, that
they may if possible find Honest Gentlemen enough in
this Degenerated Nation, who will stand up for Reli∣gion,
and hold the Ballance of the State with that
Equality, between every Branch of the Constitution,
as neither may oppress the other; that the whole may
be in its full and free Exercise, in order to bring more Easi∣ly
and Effectually to Pass that which is the great Original
of all Constitutions in the World, the Good of the People.</P>
<P>If we are still so infatuate, and Blind as not to set a
Mark of Infamy upon every Man of you.</P>
<P>If some ensuing Parliament does not by Legal Au∣thority
Disfranchise you as <HI>English-men,</HI> and make you
for ever Incapable of being chosen, or of Sitting in the
House. As Traytors in an Army are made incapable to serve.</P>
<P>If every Burrough, City, or Corporation, be not
Depriv'd of its Priviledge of choosing that shall ever
send one of you up again.</P>
<P>If every County be not double Tax'd that shall
choose any of you to represent them again.</P>
<P>Then we deserve to be betray'd to the end of the
Chapter, and <HI>England</HI> will fall unpittyed by all the
Nations of the World.</P>

<HEAD>LEGION's Address to His Majesty.
To the KING's Most Excellent Majesty.</HEAD>
<P>AMong the Throng of Your Loyal Subjects, and
Obedient <HI>Cities, Towns,</HI> and <HI>Corporations,</HI>
who come to Testify their Resentment of the
Affront put upon Your Majesty by the <HI>French</HI> King,
in acknowledging the Titles of Your Majesties King∣doms
to a contemptible Impostor, and to make ten∣der
of their Humble Duty to Your Majesty, We Be∣seech
your Majesty to permit the Humble Address of not
the sewest nor meanest of your most Dutiful Subjects.</P>
<P>We humbly approach Your Majesty in the Names
of all the Free-holders of <HI>England,</HI> who Love the
<HI>Protestant</HI> Interest, and seek the Prosperity of their
Native Country; and tho' we have not had time to
take their Hands to this Paper, We presume to assure
Your Majesty that the Hearts of the whole Nation
are here represented. Such Excepted as will be here∣after
Exprest, because the Sincerity of this Address
is such, and the Substance of it of such Moment; as no
Man can Dissent from, and remain either a Lover
of his Country, or a faithful Subject to Your Majesty.</P>
<P>We had come to Your Majesty with our Humble
Petition, but that we find no room left to complain,
Your Majesty having been always so ready to Redress
the Grievances of your People in a Parliamentary
may, that We have rather had cause to fear our Repre∣sentatives
too much of late falling into Parties, and
led by Purious Men, or Seperate Interests, shou'd im∣pose
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
upon Your Goodness, and Injure the People they
were sent to Serve, Than that any real Grievance
of the Nation shou'd not be redress'd, or any need∣ful
Laws pass'd by Your Majesty, at the first request
of your People.</P>
<P>We cannot but represent to Your Majesty, and
humbly complain that a Late House of Commons,
having with more freedom then they approv'd of,
been told the Illegality of their Proceedings, and
Charg'd with the Facts wherein they acted con∣trary
to the Sence and Interest of the People they
represented shou'd instead of rectifying or answering
the same, address Your Majesty to take care of, and
defend Your self against your People, as if it could
be possible Your People of <HI>England</HI> cou'd entertain
any Thoughts to the prejudice of Your Majesty, who
are so justly dear to them.</P>
<P>And whereas the Prosperity of this Nation depends
upon the Ʋnanimous Conjunction both of Hearts,
and Interest, between Your Majesty and your People,
and Your Majesty has fully testisied both Your sense of,
and your desire to Cultivate, and if possible to im∣prove
such a Conjunction, We cannot but Express
our Sorrow, and Disappointment that it shou'd ever
come to pass that an <HI>English</HI> Parliament shou'd be
less careful to preserve it than consisted with our
Safety, or Your Majesties Satisfaction.</P>
<P>'Tis not without a just concern We have for some
time past Observ'd, that it has been possible even for
so great an Assembly to Err, their Invading the
Rights of the People who they were chosen to Defend,
by Imprisoning such Gentlemen as by humble Peti∣tion,
according to Law, put them in Mind of their
Duty; and by addressing Your Majesty to put them
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
out of your Favour and Commission in the Countries where they
mere severally useful to Your Majesty and the Nation; Their
Evading the prosecution of Persons of Honour, whom they had
Impeach'd of Crimes they did not think fit to prove. Their
untimely and Inconsistent tristing the House of Lords, their un∣reasonable
Delays in paying the Just Debts of the Nation; their
Backwardness in assisting our <HI>Protestant</HI> Neighbours, ready to
be Insulted by the <HI>French;</HI> the Partiality of their Proceedings
in several particular Cases among themselves: These, and the
like Miscarriages, have often fill'd the Hearts of Your most
Dutiful Subjects with Trouble, to see those Gentlemen we sent
up as our Representatives so ill pursuing the great End of As∣sembling
in Parliament, <HI>viz.</HI> The Service and Benefit of Yours
Majesty, and their Country.</P>
<P>Your Majesty in Your Great Wisdom, We doubt not, had
been fully satisfied that wherein our Representatives have been
wanting in their Duty to Your Majesty in their Care of the
<HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> and Your Majesties Allies. So far they
have acted contrary to the General Sense of Ʋs Your Majesties
Most Dutiful Subjects the Free-holders of <HI>England,</HI> who chose
them, and have Betray'd the trust repos'd in them by their Country.</P>
<P>Your Majesty has sufficiently Exprest in all the Actions of
Your Glorious Life, Your Value for, and Resolution to Main∣tain
the <HI>English</HI> Constitution, and We acknowledge the Free∣dom
We now enjoy, is owing to the happy Conduct of Your
Majesty, in rescuing us from those who wou'd have Betray'd
us and our Liberties to the Power of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Popish</HI>
Counsels: And 'tis to our great Sorrow, that We observe some
of those very Instruments of Tyranny, have found ways to
be trusted again with the Liberties of their Country, not doubt∣ing
but 'tis by their restless Contrivances, that many of the
Gentlemen of that House have been Deluded, and Blindly
led under specious Pretences of Liberty, to Embroil us in Civil
Heats and Disorders.</P>
<P>Your Majesty (more than any of your late Predecessors)
has appear'd fully satisy'd with the constant Affections of your
Subjects; and have therefore Graciously granted them Constant
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
and Ʋninterrupted Assemblies of Parliaments; and your People
have on all occasions testify'd their Zeal for your Service,
Loyalry to your Person, and their Willingness to supply your
Majesty with all Needful Sums, for the Support of your Glo∣rious
Designs, firmly Believing (as they have always sound)
that your Majesty was ever intirely in the Common I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rest,
and a true Defender of the Liberty of your People; and tho'
to our Ʋnspeakable Grief, your Majesty has not been so well
serv'd, nor the Ends of the Nation so well answer'd by our
la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Representatives. Yet We humbly Beseech your Majesty
not to entertain from thence any Resentments against either
Parliaments in general; which your Majesty has so often de∣clar'd
to be the Safety and Glory of the <HI>English</HI> Constitution,
or against your Loyal and Loving Subjects (the Good People
of <HI>England</HI>) in particular.</P>
<P>And We take leave to assure your Majesty, That We cannot
Entertain any Fears that your Majesty shou'd decline your Af∣fection
to Parliaments in general, in that your Majesty has
thought fit to give us an opportunity to Elect again another Re∣presentative,
which We hope shall more fully answer the great
Ends for which they are Chosen.</P>
<P>Wherefore from our Deep sense of your Majesties great Care,
to preserve the Affections of your Loyal Subjects, and to pre∣vent
all Interruptions it may meet with from the private De∣signs
of our Enemies. We come to present your Majesty with
our Humble and Ʋnfigned Thanks for your late Proclamation,
for the Dissolution of the Parliament; and for your Gracious In∣tentions
therein Declar'd for the speedy calling another.</P>
<P>Nor can We forget to give your Majesty our most humble
Thanks, and grateful Acknowledgements, even for the very
Words of your said Proclamation; wherein your Majesty is plea∣sed
to take Notice of the true intent, and meaning of the re∣peated
Addresses of your People: who coming with Hearts full
of Resentment, at the Insolence of your Majesties Enemies, and
the In dignity Offered your Person in Fostering, and acknowledg∣ing
a Scandalous and Ridiculous Pretender, to your Majesties
rightful Dominions, cannot refrain expressing their just Fears,
that the late House of Commons would fail in their Duty, to your
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
Majesty and the Nation. By assuring your Majesty what Care
they would take, to send up such Men as should fully answer the
Expectations of all Good People, if your Majesty would be Gra∣tiously
pleased to give them an Opportunity, by calling a new
Parliament.</P>
<P>And We humbly Thank your Majesty for that (by your Gra∣tious
Proclamation) you have confirm'd what the Constitution of
<HI>England,</HI> the Reason, and Nature of the Thing: And all Im∣partial
Men have allow'd, that 'tis most reasonable, your Ma∣jesties
concurring the Free-holders of <HI>England,</HI> should have an
Opportunity of a new Choice given them when they find Cause,
in order to Choose such Men as are more likely to bring to pass
the Just and Pious Intentions of the N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion.</P>
<P>And because it may seem a new thing in <HI>England,</HI> for the
People to thank their King for dissolving the Parliament.
We humbly crave leave to assure your Majesty, that nothing
cou'd have led us to such a proceeding, but the Satisfaction of
having an Opportunity put into our hands, of sending up such
Representatives to attend your Majesty in Parliament, as may
with unshaken Fidelity to your Majesty, and unbyast regard to
the Interest of their Native Country, proceed in the weighty
Matters your Majesty shall lay before them, with that Ʋna∣nimity
of Council, and Vigour in Resolution, as is necessary at
this Juncture, to encourage the Protestant Confederacy abroad,
secure the Peace and Tranquillity of Europe, reduce the Ex∣orbitant
Power of our Enemies, compleat your Majesties Just and
Glorious Designs, and defend our Commerce in the World.</P>
<P>And We further humbly assure your Majesty, that if ever
a Parliament (which God forbid) should proceed contrary to
these just and reasonable Ends, they must be acted by some Ill
Agents, contrary to the sence of their Country. Their Duty
to your Majesty, and the honest Intentions of us your Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sties
Obedient Subjects who choose them.</P>
<P>And if ever that unhappy Time should come again, and as
often as it shall so happen, your Majesty will Infinitely Engage
the Hearts and Affections of all your honest Protectant Sub∣jects,
by giving them Opportunity to show their Resentments, by
Ghoosing Men of more honesty in their rooms.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<P>So shall the Peace and Tranguillity of these Nations be
preserved; the Glory of your Majesties Reign encreased; the
Enemies of our Happiness be defeated. Our Protestant Neigh∣bours,
your Majesties Allies be assisted and encouraged; Our
Religion, Liberty, and Trade secured: And your Majesties
Satisfaction compleated, to the Glory of God, and the Infinite
Comfort of all these who Wish and Pray for the Prosperity of
Your Majesty and <HI>Old England.</HI></P>
