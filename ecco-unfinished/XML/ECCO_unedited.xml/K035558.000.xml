<P>MR. <HI>Leatherhead</HI>, this is a strange Commotion has happen'd of late in your little Community; that <HI>Poppets</HI>; (who have been hitherto a peaceable Generation,) should all of a sudden, fall a tilting their brainless Heads at each other, to the utter Destruction of all brotherly Affection, is, I must confess very amazing. Pray Heaven at prove no ill Portent to our greater State; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I assure you, I cannot but apprehend it extremely.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lea.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Neighbour, the wisest among us are Strangers to what an after-Day may produce. I myself as little apprehended this Rupture, as any Body; but the Truth is, being oblig'd some time ago to make a Reform in my little Commonwealth, there being few of the old Members, who had not by frequent Scuffles, lost some a Nose, others a Leg, and others an Arm, I sent over to <HI>Ire∣land</HI>, for some of the best Wood that Coun∣try affords, in order to repair the Generations among which Stuff, there happen'd to be one damn'd knotty Log, from the County of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The County where <HI>Firebrand</HI> was born.</NOTE> <HI>Clare</HI>, who no sooner receiv'd human Form from the Artist's Chissel, than he began to discover some of that perverse cross-grain'd Disposition he was made of. For taking the Advantage, from a late Play I exhibited, call'd, <HI>Whittington and his Cat</HI>; or, <HI>the lucky Venture</HI>, He found Means to set the <HI>Commons</HI> (of which Number he was one) against their good old Friends, the <HI>Lord Mayor and Aldermen</HI>; by slyly insinuating, as if these latter in their late quarterly Feasts, had depriv'd them of their usual Share of Custard, which As∣sertion the <HI>Commons</HI> greedily swallowing, have conceiv'd an unconquerable hatred to the <HI>Alder∣men</HI>, insomuch, that instead of making use of loyal Toasts, as they were us'd to do, at their merry
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
Meetings, they do nothing but drink Confusion to one another. In short the Breach is made so wide by Means of this <HI>Incendiary</HI>, that if some Means be not suddenly taken to close it, I am a∣fraid it will be the utter Dissolution of the Society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nei.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is Strange indeed! that from one <HI>Block</HI>, should grow so much Confusion. But how happens it, Mr. <HI>Leatherhead</HI>, that your Night's En∣tertainment is call'd the <HI>Election?</HI> I can't see, what Reference these Broils have to such a Title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lea.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear. — You must know, in the midst of these Squabbles, it happen'd, that the <HI>Lord Mayor's High Steward</HI>, or <HI>Keeper of the Key of the Pant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI>, was made away with. For he being disrob'd of his old Cloaths, in order for a fresh Suit, was seiz'd, as he lay in a Corner, by my <HI>Cookmaid</HI>; who mistaking him for a Log of the old Party, took him to boil the Pot. Now, Sir, as the Vacancy occasion'd by this Accident cannot be fill'd, but by one duly elected to the Office, there have started up, four or five <HI>Candi∣dates</HI>, in the foremost of whom stands <HI>Firebrand</HI>, (the Poppet I just now mention'd,) and who is so call'd, from his being of a very hot Constituti∣on, and apt to swell, at the least mention of ar∣bitrary Power, and high Feeding. Now the <HI>Al∣dermen</HI>, being afraid that if this <HI>Poppet</HI> carries the <HI>Election</HI>, nothing but starving on their Side will ensue, use all their Interest to oppose him, while
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
he, on the other Hand, by cajoling the <HI>Commons</HI>, with large Promises of what he'll do for them, when he comes to be elected, has drawn them over to his Party. This, Sir, is the present Pos∣ture of Affairs, the Consequence of which this Night's Entertainment must determine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nei.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it must needs afford an abundance of Humour, if it be carry'd on, with the usual Heat attending Elections. — But pray, what part do you intend to take in these Commotions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lea.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>None, Sir, none. — I intend to stand Neuter to Night, and leave all their Affairs to their own Management: But see! the People begin to thicken, and 'tis Time we were begun. — Call forth <HI>Cheshire Tom</HI> there, till he speaks the Prologue. — Here <HI>Tom! — Cheshire Tom</HI>, hoa! —</P>

<L>And yet can any Thing from Players bear.</L>
<L>To such we say — we can no Method find</L>

<L>Let it suffice, that all who see our Play,</L>

<P>The End of all Governments, I take it (as <HI>Aris∣totle</HI> very wisely observes) depends (take Notice, I begin low, that I may rise in a proper Place, ac∣cording to the Method of <HI>Demosthenes</HI>) depends, I say, upon a certain Concatenation, Assimilation, or Aggregation of the several Parts, which being cemented, ligamented, or rather structerify'd, by the Adhesion, Cooperation, or similar Formation,
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
of the volitary, circumambient, fluctuating, Va∣gue, and irresidentary Particles; come at length to form, what in the strict Acceptation of the Word, may be termed either monarchical, aristocratical, or democratical, according to the several Usages, Customs, Humours, Habits, Views, political and religious Ordinations, Regulations, Institutions, Agreements, both publick and private, of the se∣veral Countries, wherein such Laws, Pandects, Councils, Statutes, Edicts, Rules, Acts, Orders, Decrees and Injunctions, are divulged, proclaimed, made known, or promulgated, from which no Member can possibly be torn, separated, rent, cashiered, disbanded, but the interiour, or more inward Parts receive a Contusion, Bump, Bruise, Pressure, Scratch, Scarification or Tumour, which is equal, similar, or Corresponsive, to that which occasions what is called the Hystericks, Fits, Maw-Worms, and Mulligrubs, in the Bowels of old aged Men, or young sucking Children, which Observa∣tion may be still strengthened, fortifyed, and cor∣roborated, by a Quotation from the <HI>Greek</HI>, of that most excellent Historian, and Politician, <HI>Paracel∣sus</HI>, where he says, in the fifth Chapter of his Book, <HI>de modo gubernandi Antiquorum. — Hei mihi, non habeo obolum in marsupio</HI>. As also, in that famous <HI>Italian</HI> Antiquary, <HI>Helvidius Priscus</HI>, the Son of a worthy <HI>Roman</HI> Knight, where talking of the <HI>Egyptian Coins</HI>, he says, (and indeed very much to

the purpose) <HI>Non omnia possumus omnes</HI>. By which it is evident, that to preserve one's Constitution long, they should live temperate.

<P>Flat Bribery and Corruption, by the <HI>L—d!</HI> take Notice, Sirrah, I will have you and your Lord, to answer this at the next Sitting of the great Coun∣cil.—Here's a Rogue for you!—suffer himself to be influenced!—But what says the <HI>Peruke-Maker</HI>.</P>

<P>Why, I say Sir, that 'tis a great Grief to me, that I cannot let my Vote go along with my Inclinations, for as I am a young Beginner, and have not many Customers, all my Hair will rot up∣on my Hands, unless I go according to the Instruc∣tions of 'Squire <HI>Pigtail</HI>.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bu.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why as to my Part, look ye, Sir, I defy Mankind to say, I am under the Influence of any Body. I detest such Baseness from my Heart, and think the Man who would be guilty of such a Thing, has no more Honour in him than an Ox; for which Reason I resolve to keep neuter, and vote only for him, who buys most Mutton.</P>

<P>Well, thy Stupidity will always be an Excuse for thy Knavery. — But what says the <HI>Weaver</HI>.</P>

<P>Why indeed, Sir, there is no Man has a warmer Zeal for his friend's Interest than I have; but the Truth is, the Times past have been so hard, and 'tis so long since I made a good Meal, that I am afraid I must be forc'd to vote for him

<P>May your Belly grow as small as your Conscience, you slim-gutted Dog! — and may you never eat any thing, but what you get at Elec∣tions — Zounds! the Universality of this Corrup∣tion, almost makes me mad. — Well, I'll try one more before I despair utterly, and that shall be the <HI>Carpenter</HI>. — His honest, plain Looks shew him to be of a <HI>Leaven</HI> quite different from these Dogs here, one who will dare be honest even in the worst of Times; such a Person's Vote does Honour to the Man 'tis given to, and if I mistake not, Sir, you have promis'd it to me already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Carp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, I did promise it to you, that's true, but I have thought better on it since, for my Wife advises me not to be too hasty in parting with it, because, says she, if you keep it till the End of the Election, and it comes to be a casting Vote, you may chance to get Money for it.</P>

<P><Q>“That you are all a Parcel of <HI>Numb-Skulls, Asses, Tom Noodles</HI> and <HI>Ninny-Hammers</HI>, will, I believe, be pretty apparent to yourselves, when I tell you that your Obstinacy in refu∣sing to elect me, puts me under the Neces∣sity of informing you, that there is no Person in this City so proper to represent you as myself. For G—d Zounds! (to talk calmly) what wou'd you be at? Is it my Inability to stuff your Paunches with the most delicate Food, or my Honesty in refusing to solicit af∣ter the mean customary Manner, that deprives me of your Favour? — If it be the first, with what Face can you expect a Dinner from me, who have always declar'd my Ab∣horrence of that Practice; or why expect I should Flatter, whom you all know to be an
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
Enemy to Fawning? and yet these are the only Methods, (base as they are) by which you seem resolv'd to be won. — Well Slaves! do! go on your own Way, never leave fol∣lowing Corruption, till you find the <HI>Pope</HI> at your Doors, the <HI>Pretender</HI> in your Chambers, the <HI>Devil</HI> in your Hearts, and <HI>Slavery</HI> every where; till your Bodies become as groveling as your Minds, and the <HI>Aldermen</HI> erect an Inqui∣sition to broil <HI>Free Citizens</HI>. And yet all this does not shame you! — No! — 'tis in vain I ring Freedom in your Ears, when the ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first Tinkle of Glasses, Flaggons, and Quart Pots, drives it out again, and you become as enamour'd of Slavery as ever. By which you shew, you are of the true breed of <HI>Circe</HI>'s Hogs, who had rather lye wallowing in the Filth of your accustom'd Drunkenness, and Gluttony; than, by abstaining a little, enjoy the sober Blessings of Reason, Virtue, and Li∣berty. But why shou'd I take so much Pains, or disturb my own Repose, to save a set of Fellows from Ruin, who seem resolv'd on their own Destruction? Did I consult my own Interest only, I should let them swim with the Stream, but Conscience which over∣rules all other Considerations, will not suffer me to see you quietly make away with yourselves. —No, ye scald Dogs! I love you, and that
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
is the Reason, that, cost me what pains it will, I am resolved at all Hazards to be your Representative; and this, not out of any vain Motive of raising myself above my Fellows, but through a Consciousness of my own Abi∣lities, which informs me, no Person else can do it so well; as for the other <HI>Candidates</HI>, who are Rivals with me in your Favour, I swear, by the Majesty of a <HI>Free Citizen</HI>, they are but mere Botches compar'd with me; Fellows who are as ignorant as designing, and who only make love to their own Fortunes by courting you, and how they will use you, when they get the Key of the <HI>Pantry</HI> into their own Hands, may be learn'd from the Behaviour of their Predecessors; who, while they wanted your Favour, were as cringing as Spaniels, but when they had no farther Occa∣sion for it, grew as fastidious and insolent as Lap-Dogs. — Therefore Gentlemen, be wary in your Choice for the future, — look sharp about you — choose one who is worthy to re∣present you. — I have told you over and over again, who I am, and if it seems meet to your Reason to elect me, I promise you, no Mastiff was ever truer to his Master's Inte∣rest, than I will be to yours, I will watch Night and Day for your Preservation, and the Wolf shall sooner snap away my share of the
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
Provender, than touch one Morsel of yours. In short, I will say no more, but if you do not elect me, you will be the greatest <HI>Slaves, Blockheads, Knaves, Asses</HI>, and <HI>Scoundrels</HI>, that ever sold City's Liberties. But if you do elect me, not <HI>Rome</HI> in all her Glory will be able to produce such a set of brave <HI>Citizens</HI>, Then will you find, in serving me you have serv'd yourselves, Plenty will then be the com∣mon Lot of all, and you may be assur'd, that as my Belly encreases in Bulk, yours will also swell in Proportion; which being the strong∣est Motive I have at present to offer, I con∣clude ”your affectionate Brother,</Q></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Fust.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know, being about to play the Tragedy of <HI>Oedipus</HI> soon, and not liking that clumsy way the Actors have always practis'd of throwing a sham Person off of the Tower instead of him; I consider'd how I might re∣medy this Indecorum, and observing that the Fellows who fly from the Tops of Steeples, do it by Means of a Groove fasten'd to their Breasts, I got one of them made, and tying a Rope to the Ceiling, attempted to slide down, but un∣luckily for me, e'er I got half way, my Balance forsook me, and I fell on my Side. — 'twas a mer∣cy twas not the Stage it happen'd on, or I shou'd be laught at most inordinately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Fire.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Fustian</HI>, have good Heart, I hope to see you do it with more Success yet. — You ought to get a Tumbler to give you two, or three Lessons on these Matters, that you may be in less Danger from your Agility.</P>

<P>Get over the Devil! What! is not my Pain great enough already, but you must strive to encrease it? Take your Plaister away and be

<P>And pray, Sir, if the Sight of it can effect so much good, what must not the Application? That certainly wou'd have made you immortal. — But here, <HI>Squirt</HI>, take it away, seeing there's no farther use for it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Fust.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think, <HI>Firebrand</HI>, all your Medicines have the same admirable Property with your Plai∣ster, they do better at the outside of the Belly than within it, and to effect the Cure of the Patient, you need only shew them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Fire.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I thank God, they are none of your mar∣cid, dead, unoperating Drugs, they, like my Writings, have a Spirit in them extraordinary. — But what Paper is that you took out of your Pocket?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Fust.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the Correction of a favourite Play of mine, call'd the <HI>Revenge</HI>, which I intend to ex∣hibit soon, and which I wou'd be glad to have your Opinion of beforehand. Now you must know this Play begins as all good <HI>Tragedies</HI> ought, with a Storm; and indeed, to say the Truth, it is no other than a Storm all through. Now I perceiving that nothing pleases People so well as Tempests in Plays, I have added a few Lines of my own, in order to make it still more Tempestuous. — Hark, and you shall hear

in their Works like it. They are Tame com∣par'd to me, as you shall see by the following, for I carry the Thought still farther.</P>
<Q><L>Let Hell itself affrighted with the Din</L>

<L>Confound all Nature with the horrid Change.</L>
<L>So shall the Heavens with Monsters strange be fill'd,</L>
<L>And Gods, like Dolphins, tumble in the Deep:</L>
<L>Men shall sink down to where Hell stood before,</L>
<L>And Devils roam about where Men did dwell;</L>
<L>So to their Contraries shall all Things turn,</L>
<L>Fire, freeze like Ice, and Ice like Fire burn;</L>

<P>By my Father's Great Shade! 'tis such a Confusion of the Elements as I never heard before; it is (as <HI>Milton</HI> says) Confusion worse confounded, and excels even the bellowing of <HI>Baralipton Bomboma∣chides</HI>, who, they say, was the natural Son of <HI>Aeolus</HI>, God of the Winds, and did every Thing by his Inspiration.

<P>Well, pray let it be soon. — But what's the Reason, <HI>Fustian</HI>, you never write a whole Play?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Fust.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! I leave that for Fellows who have less Capacity and Judgment than myself. I shew my Parts in correcting what the best Authors have wrote, in which I think I do wisely, for did I write any thing myself, perhaps the World wou'd not think it so good, so that I mump the Criticks there, for, by only mending others, I get all the Reputation of an Author, without giving them any thing to rail at.</P>

<P>Well, you're a crafty Fellow, and that your very Enemies allow you. But have you any Thing more that you wou'd ask my Opinion of? For to tell you the Truth, I am in some Haste to go write myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Fust.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will detain you but to hear one Altera∣tion I have made at the End of the Play, where <HI>Zanga</HI> is carry'd off to be executed; which, under Favour of so great an Author, was a very mean
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
Thing of him, to have the grand Hero of a Play carry'd to Execution, like one of our <HI>Tyburn</HI> Male∣factors, is most pitiful. I see nothing in <HI>George Barnwell</HI> half so shocking. For besides the Inde∣corum of making a Hero dye that Way, it de∣prives the Actor of the Reputation he might have got in performing it well. — Now Sir, how do you think I Remedy this? Why, as they offer to lay Hands on me, not thinking, I have any Wea∣pon, whip, pulls I it out,—and ere you cou'd well reckon one, plunges it into my own Entrails. — See Sir, I will both say the Words, and do the Action, that you may Judge of both together. — Now I am stabb'd — now I fall, — and here's the last Speech I utter.</P>

<PB N="44" REF="42"/>
no Joke, may serve to hit you as well, and that is, if you are not more moderate in your Puffs for the future, it will not be consistent either with my Modesty or Safety to print them.—I met just now <HI>Punchinello</HI> from the other House, who ra∣ted me on Account of your last Copy of Verses; he called me, numskull, Puppy, medling Fool, Wooden-headed Rogue, (and so forth) and won∣dered why to gratify a Vagabond, I would asperse so near a Relation.</P>

<P>You seem all to wonder, Gentlemen, (and with Reason,) at this sudden Alteration in my Deportment. But because your Love to me, claims no less, than a clear Explanation of this Mat∣ter, I will now let you into the secret of it. You must know, that for many Years past, I have been troubl'd with a certain <HI>Vertigo</HI> in my Head, ap∣proaching nearly, to what People call <HI>Madness</HI>; occasion'd by an ill Accident, which happen'd to me in one of my Chymical Projections. For as I was searching after the <HI>Philosophers Stone</HI>, (a Thing, I have since found to be attain'd, only by <HI>Faction</HI>) it happen'd that by too great an Infusi∣on of the sulphureous Matter, the Projection blew up: and the same Blast, that depriv'd me of half my Sight, did at the same Time carry off half my Reason; so that I grew not utterly Delirious, but as a Man wou'd say, <HI>half-witted</HI>; a thing plainly to be seen in my Writings, which however sensible in the Main, had a strange Tendency to abuse these worthy Gentlemen, the <HI>Aldermen</HI>, whom upon the Recovery of my Senses, I find, to be the best Friends of the City: therefore, blame not me, Brethren, but my unfortunate Phrenzy, for having so long misled you. The only Reparation I can now make, is, to advise you to go home, and mind your Occupations, as I intend to do mine. A future Industry may retrieve what your past Idle∣ness

has lost you, in all Emergencies of the City I will never fail to be your Friend. <HI>Dixi.</HI></P>

<L>But when true Wit, as just as e'er was stamp'd,</L>
<L>Is by a set of sordid Schemers cramp'd;</L>
<L>Not one of you will set your Throats a Bawling,</L>
<L>Or brandish Stick to keep his Cause from falling.</L>
<L>So well this strange Inconstancy of you,</L>
<L>Does prove, Alas! This Observation true,</L>
<L>"Excess of Merit makes the Brave to fall,</L>
<L>"And proves more hurtful than no Parts at all."</L>

<L>Well! 'tis resolv'd, nor do I care who know it,</L>
<L>Since Things are grown so bad, I'll turn <HI>Poet:</HI></L>
<L>And like my Brother Blockheads of the Age,</L>
<L>In stingless Satyr vent my venom'd Rage.</L>
<L>It matters not how dull each thing that's said,</L>
<L>If I but print, I surely will be read;</L>
<L>Some senseless Song, (to suit the <HI>manly Tone</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>Sullivan,)</HI> which <HI>Sheridan</HI> may own,</L>
<L>And claim an honour envy'd him by none.</L>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Prefaces are seldom look'd into, till the Book is read, I have, for the Ease of the Reader, plac'd mine at the End; which, if he be curious enough to peruse, he will find in it little more than what others usually contain; <HI>A Defence of the Work</HI>. A necessary Consolation against the ensuing Malice of some Cri∣ticks, who generally decry a Performance, with as lit∣tle Reason as the Author commends it. 'Tis in Conformity to so prudent a Rule, I here apprize my Readers, (especially such of them as are ignorant of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI>) that they will find the polite Elegance of <HI>Terence</HI>, the Wit and Humour of <HI>Plautus</HI>, the sharp Raillery of <HI>Aristophanes</HI>, and many of the unknown Excellencies of <HI>Menander</HI>, in this Piece happily united. I say nothing of the Moderns, whose Works I disdain to Copy; being of the same Opinion with many learn'd Criticks of this City, that except <HI>Colley Cibber, Far∣quhar</HI>, and two or three choice Plays of Mrs. <HI>Susannah Centlievre</HI>, the rest are not worth Reading. For certain I am, was there the least Grain of Merit in any of the others, as some positive Fools insist on; so wise and learn'd a City as <HI>Dublin</HI>, wou'd certainly e'er this have found it out. And here I cannot forbear, in the great Joy of my Heart, from congratulating my Countrymen upon the immense Treasure of Learning, and Genius they possess in the Person of the great Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, a Man who not only assists our Taste in acting such Plays as are conformable thereto, but brings all others of what Texture soever to the same Level. A <HI>Shakespear</HI> in his Hands, seems no more than a <HI>Young</HI> or a <HI>Rowe</HI> wou'd in anothers. He studies our Capacities, and corrects each sublime and knotty Passage to such an intelligible Lowness, as I am sure the meanest Auditor cannot but be satisfy'd therewith. 'Tis in order to be assistant to so great a Reformer, I have by me a perfect Plan, or set of new Rules, drawn from his own Practice, for adjust∣ing the Oeconomy of Dress, the Intervention of Songs,
<PB N="ii" REF="70"/>
and Dances between the Acts, Roratorio's, <HI>Hibernian</HI> Triumphs, and Concerts of Musick, with all the Play-House Tackle, such as Thunder, Lightning, Hail, Rain, Snow, Sea Scenes, Rising Suns, and Magick Lan∣thorns. In short every Thing that ought not to belong to a Play-House, I have most carefully collected: and till such Time as a proper Season comes for publishing them, it is requested that young Gentlemen will conti∣nue to resort <HI>Smock-Alley</HI> Play-House, as the only School in which they may have their Knowledge of these Matters encreased, and a Foundation laid for that sub∣lime Way of Thinking, which no Documents, or Rules to the contrary, will ever be able to eradicate.</P>
<P>But to return to the Praise of my Book,—I am not so arrogant to say, 'tis the best Piece of Ridicule ever was written, but if my Reader of his own Ac∣cord is willing to think as much, truly I will not quar∣rel with him for the Matter,—for the Sake of Peace much Obstinacy must be born with, —as odd Things have been asserted before now, and if it be necessary that Criticks should mistake sometimes, they may as well mistake in my Behalf, as in any other Author's, I shall not be the first who has got an undeserved Reputation; and indeed of late Years, the publick seem to have got a <HI>Knack</HI> of praising the worst Things most, As they say indulgent Parents treat with the greatest Tenderness their weak Children, but resign to Fortune, or their own In∣dustry, those of a more vigorous Constitution.</P>
