<HEAD>CIVIC SERMONS
TO THE
PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From mutual Wants springs mutual Happiness.</HEAD>
<P>WHY are some men set over other
men to rule and govern them?
This is a question we promised to examine,
but it will be necessary, in the first place,
to enquire of what <HI>use</HI> Government is,
for nothing that is useless can be worth
supporting at all; but if we succeed in
finding out its uses, we shall easily com∣prehend
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
every thing else relating to its
establishment. And thus we shall set Go∣vernment
upon a broad and firm founda∣tion,
a foundation which no man would
even wish to undermine, for no one desires
to destroy that which is a benefit to him.
You have probably read the story of the
Old Man with the bundle of Arrows, and
you know that singly we are all of us
weak, but collectively strong. You know
too that one man cannot make all the
things he wants. One of you can plough
the land; another graft and prune trees;
another weave cloth; another shape and
fashion the tools by which these things
are done. It is therefore very desireable
that men should associate and live together.
It is likewise pleasant, and agreeable to
the nature of Man, who loves society, to
be thus associated. You must be con∣vinced
of this by the pleasure you take in
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
forming yourselves into little clubs, and
knots of neighbourhood. A State is a
more numerous club; a wider neighbour∣hood;
an association including all lesser
associations: but as it is difficult at once
for the understanding to embrace an object
of such magnitude, the greater will be
better comprehended by beginning with
the less. If your child wants to know
what a State is, take him between your
knees and say to him—“My child!
when you were very little, our small
cottage, and its spot of garden-ground,
was all that you were acquainted with
of the wide world. Your mother nou∣rished
you at her breast, I carried you in
my arms; your brothers and sisters played
with and caressed you: all people besides
were strangers to you; so far from wishing
to see them, you shrunk and hung back
when they approached. Thus we guarded
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
the feeble beginnings of your life, as we
guard a taper that is just lit; spreading
the hands anxiously round it to shelter it
from wind, and keeping it still, till the
flame has gathered strength. This first
society is called a Family. It is the root
of every other society. It is the begin∣ning
of order, and kind affections, and
mutual helpfulness and provident regu∣lations.
If this spring be pure, what
proceeds from it will be pure: if it be
polluted, the broader waters will be dis∣coloured.
<HI>My child, love your family.</HI>
Its strength is your strength, its interests
are your interests; one stream of life flows
through every member of it. You owe
much to your parents; my child, pay it
to your children; for this is the wise ap∣pointment
and beautiful contrivance of
God, that so man might never, at any
moment of his existence, find himself
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
single, unconnected and free from obliga∣tion;
that so the relation of families might
not be broken off, but might be continued
through all generations in a lengthening
and perpetual chain. But, my child,
you are now grown older; your walks
are extended to all the cluster of houses
amongst which we live: you know the
inhabitants; every one of them takes you
by the hand, and bids you good-morrow
as you pass. You know every copse and
field, and pasture belonging to them; for
you have been with the old men of the
parish when they went to trace out and
mark the bounds of it. This then is the
next Society; the members of it are
townsmen; they know each other, they
care for each other; the rich help the
poor, the poor work for the rich; they
are more united than strangers. Now,
my child, if you travel on, you come to
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
other towns, and fields and villages, and
others still beyond them far, and further
than you can see, East and West, and North
and South, reaching on every side to the
great Ocean, and all these together make
up that large society called a <HI>State;</HI> so
large is it, that you must stretch your
imagination to conceive properly of its
extent; it contains thousands and thou∣sands
of families whom you never have
seen, nor probably ever will see; yet of
all this you are a part, and joined to it
in a most intimate and binding connection,
like a limb to the body, or a single shoot
to a large tree. These are all governed
by the same rules; they speak the same
language; they make war or peace to∣gether.
<HI>My child, love your Country!</HI> it
contains all you love; all lesser societies,
of friends families and townsmen, are in∣cluded
in this vast, this comprehensive
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
community.”—In this manner, my friends,
instruct your children, and make these
important terms <HI>familiar in their mouths
as houshold names.</HI></P>
<P>If it be asked for what <HI>reasons</HI> men
associate in this large connection, consider
within yourselves for what reasons you
associate in smaller societies. Consider
what services you would wish from your
neighbours, and what advantages you
would expect from agreeing to live to∣gether,
if you were to belong to no other
community than that of the little town∣ship
where you were about to settle your∣selves.—You
would wish, in the first
place, that no one might hurt or do any
injury to his neighbour. You would not
have the strong abuse the weak. You
would wish that a woman or a young
child, should cross the green, or go to the
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
neighbouring market, with as much safety
as the stoutest man amongst you. You
like to sleep in your beds, without being
disturbed by ruffians; and you would
think it a sad state of things if, when you
go out in the fields to work, you were
obliged to keep watch, and to spy anxiously
into every wood and bye-lane, lest troops
of robbers should fall upon you, and put
you to death, or carry you into slavery.
You wish, therefore, in the first place,
<HI>security to your persons.</HI> You further
wish, that when you have ploughed a
field, or laid down a meadow for hay,
your idle neighbour may not be permitted
to reap the corn you have sown; or to
turn in his cattle to trample down your
grass. You chuse to enjoy the fruits of
your industry. You like to say, <HI>this is
mine;</HI> when you have wrought any thing
by your skill, or produced it from the
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
earth by your labour, or saved it by your
oeconomy; and you feel that without this
encouragement you would not have suffi∣cient
motive for your exertions. You
wish therefore the <HI>security of property.</HI>
You wish further to have some general
rules, known and agreed to by all, by
which every one may conduct himself in
the intercourses of life: you wish regula∣tions
for your fairs and markets, established
weights and measures, and appointed days
for particular business. You wish then
<HI>Laws, and a Police.</HI> You wish for some
method of determining disputes which
may arise; and of bringing to reason any
refractory member of the society. You
wish then <HI>a Judicature.</HI> You would be
willing, especially those of you who are
in easy circumstances, to spare something
out of the produce of your shop, or your
farm, for a common purse, in order to
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
build a church, to make a road, to endow
a school, to erect a market-cross, to sink
a well, or any the like useful works; or
even to make a bowling-green, or plant
a walk of trees, where you may assemble
with your families, and amuse yourselves
when the labour of the day is over. You
wish then <HI>a revenue.</HI> Further, perceiving
that these excellent regulations you had
made would not execute themselves, and
that what is every one's business is no
one's business, you would appoint some
one or more persons amongst you whose
province it should be to see that all these
rules were observed, and your money laid
out with faithfulness and judgment. As
these persons could not well look after
your business and their own too, you
would be willing to appoint them a salary,
which might make them amends for their
time and trouble spent upon your affairs;
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
you would likewise contrive that by ap∣pointing
men to attend them when their
office required it, they should always have
power enough to make your rules be
observed, in spite of all the resistance of
ill-disposed and licentious people. You
wish then <HI>ruling powers, and an executive
force.</HI>—And thus you would have formed,
almost without knowing it, that institu∣tion
called <HI>Government:</HI> you would have
traced in miniature the same plan which,
with a larger outline, embraces the in∣terests
of States and Empires. It will
have been suggested to you, as every other
invention of man has been suggested to
him, by his wants; and therefore it is
that you will be at no loss to know its
uses. Men suffer from the cold, and they
contrive cloathing; they require shelter,
and they construct houses; they have
need of society, and they form Govern∣ments.
There is nothing of mystery in
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
this, nothing that requires to be wrapt
up in strange and unintelligible terms;
the steps are plain and easy; the benefits
are felt by all, and therefore it may be
comprehended by all.</P>
<P>It has been asserted by some, that if
men all were virtuous, there would be
no occasion for Government; this,
however, is far from being true. If
all men were virtuous, we should in∣deed
want no prisons, no terrible exe∣cutions,
no armed soldiers, but we should
still want Government, because we should
want society. Government is useful for
three things. First, for protection: every
man is protected with the force of every
man; no force can attack the subject of
the laws so great as that which defends
him; even the man who rises to injure
him is made at the same time, by the
compelling force of Government, to con∣tribute
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
his share towards his defence.
Secondly, for managing those affairs which
Societies have in common; when affairs
are too big for any private undertaking,
they are managed by the Society. By
Government the whole strength of the
community is made to act together, like
a giant beam of some vast machine which
plays with the complicated force of a
thousand movements, and executes at
once what a number of single arms would
attempt in vain. Thirdly, Government
is useful for regulating many things which
in themselves are indifferent, but which,
in order to prevent disputes, it is necessary
to determine by some fixed and precise
rule. In some cases, the law tells you
what is right, and what is wrong; but
in some it <HI>makes</HI> the right and wrong.
I will try to explain this. Reason tells
us, that every man should enjoy the fruit of
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
his own industry; but if a tenant finds in
his field a copper mine, or a coal-pit,
reason will not tell him whether it should
belong to himself, or to his landlord.
Reason will not tell him whether the
fish in the river ought to be in common,
or to belong to the occupier of the ground
on its banks: reason will say that his pro∣perty
should be secured to him during his
life, but reason will not say in what pro∣portions
it shall be divided after his death
amongst his family; if indeed it will
secure its perpetual continuance there.
Yet these are circumstances too important
to be left to the turbulent decisions of the
moment; they are therefore made the
object of law, and by this means a number
of cases are determined in a quiet and re∣gular
manner, which, without such an au∣thority
to appeal to, would occasion con∣tinual
animosity and contention, <HI>because</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
no clear right could exist on either side.—The
larger and more flourishing any
Society is, the more occasion it has for
Government, because it has more affairs
to manage in common, and more cases
to be determined by particular rules.
Along the vast plains of the middle of Asia
rove innumerable tribes of Shepherds,
leading their flocks from pasture to pasture,
and subsisting upon their milk and flesh.
These require very little of Government,
for they have few common affairs to
manage; when their tents are struck,
their towns are moved, and their whole
community unfixed. Few disputes of
property can arise amongst them, beyond
the right to a well of purer water, or the
liberty of pitching their canvass dwellings
in a meadow ground of richer pasture.
They have no public works, no extensive
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
commerce, no navigation; Government
holds them with a loose and slight band
of connection; few of their actions are
restrained. The division of tribes, in
which a kind of family government is
exercised, answers to them all the ends of
a more complicated scheme of legislation.
But it is not so in such a community as
ours. We want much more of Society;
and therefore Government extends itself
to many of our most common and in∣different
actions. We want security for
various kinds of property, of the most
delicate and complex nature: we want
provision for our teachers; we want pro∣vision
for our poor, and instruction for
them; we want armies and fleets for our
defence. You have seen a ship, and you
know how very little way one day's work
of any of you would go towards com∣pleating
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
it: we want many ships; we
want intercourse with foreign nations.
We want some things for the pomp and
decent splendor which becomes a great
and rich people; and all these affairs
must be managed and directed by the
public act and consent.—We require
much of Government, and therefore it
lays us under many restraints; restraints
as uneasy and difficult to bear, to one not
accustomed to our state of society, as the
fashion of our cloaths would be to the
half-naked Indian, that bounds along
without incumbrance amongst his native
plains. We bear these restraints, because
we think the advantages make it worth
while; there is no other reason.—Man,
feeble and defenceless in thyself, rejoice
that thou art joined to a community!
Individuals, rejoice that you are gathered
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
into a public! Its strength becomes
your strength, its riches your riches;
all its powers of defence to the last man
would be drawn out to shield one of your
little infants from violence or oppression.
If a single man were to attack one of you
who is stout, he could perhaps defend
himself; but he could not resist a band
of armed robbers. In countries where
there is no regular Government, there are
many such, who infest the roads, fall
upon and massacre the peaceable inha∣bitants,
burn the houses, and carry away
women and children into cruel slavery;
the law protects you against such; the
law is strong, because you are weak; the
law is armed, to defend you who are naked
and unarmed. Citizens, expand your
minds to take in these ideas! Let your
Country occupy a large space in your
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
minds! Love your Country; not merely
because you first drew breath in it, and
because its fields, and woods, and rivers
are endeared by early pleasures, and tender
recollections; though this too is agreeable
to our nature, and a source of fond and
exquisite delight; but because it includes
every other object of love, because it unites
all separate energies into one energy, all
separate wills into one will; and having
united and declared them, calls it Law.—Reverence
yourselves, for though but
a small part, still you are a part of your
Country. In yourselves you are weak,
but in your Country you are strong; in
yourselves you are obscure, but in your
Country you are celebrated; in yourselves
you are unlearned, but in your Country
you possess all science and all art; in your∣selves
you are defenceless, but in your
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Country you are invincible; in yourselves
you are perishable, but in your Country
you prolong an honourable existence from
age to age. Its splendors are your splen∣dors,
its triumphs are your triumphs;
every active citizen has a right to say,
“<HI>We</HI> did this,” when any honourable
action is recorded of his Country. Love
then this Country; unite its idea with
that of your domestic comforts, of your
industrious exertions, of your solemn
prayers; be ready for any sacrifice it may
require of you; and remember that as
each of you, however inconsiderable, is
benefited by your Country; so your
Country, however extensive, is benefited
by every one of the least of you, provided
he sincerely exerts himself for that
purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Having thus considered the uses of
Government, you are prepared to see
every thing belonging to it from its true
centre and proper point of view; and
will be able to judge what is mishapen,
monstrous, and out of proportion, and
what is well contrived, beautiful, and
harmonious. Government is a machine
constructed for a certain purpose. If any
one were to shew you a machine with a
number of wheels, springs and move∣ments,
and was to ask you to judge of its
construction, you would immediately en∣quire
for what purpose it was intended;
for without such information you might
see indeed that there was a great deal of
mechanism employed about it, but whe∣ther
well or ill contrived you would not
be able to tell; for the proportion of every
work depends on the effect to be produced
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
by it: a mill-wheel has not the same
proportion with a cart-wheel, nor a com∣mon
house the same proportions with a
Church, because their <HI>ends</HI> are different.
Never lose sight, therefore, of this truth,
that <HI>Government is an invention of man,
for the service of men:</HI> carry this idea
along with you, and apply it, as the
Carpenter does his rule and square, not
only to the fairer and more stately apart∣ments,
but to every recess and abutment
and hang-to of the State. I do not say
that no difficulties will remain, for Go∣vernment
is too noble an art not to have
its difficulties; but proportionally, few will
remain. All Politicians would be nearly
of a mind, if they were once agreed about
the end they are to have in view: but the
fact is, that in many States, I might say
most, Government is an invention for the
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
advantage of a <HI>few men,</HI> or perhaps of <HI>one
man,</HI> and consequently for the oppression
and degradation of the rest. I suppose
you can be at no loss to determine which
of these ends is the most desireable. You
need not consider long to be convinced,
that if happiness be good, the more of it
there is in the world the better; and that
it is a nobler plan which contrives the
happiness of all, than that which con∣trives
the happiness only of a part. If
then you agree with me in this opinion,
we will lay aside all the other plans of
Government as not to our purpose.
They may be very well contrived and
proportioned to answer the end they are
intended for, but it is not our end. We
do not think the happiness of a few men
a sufficient object; we want the happiness
of all; for this plain reason, that all have
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
an equal desire to be happy, and an equal
right to be so.</P>
<P>It would save a great deal of unnecessary
trouble, if those who pretend to explain
the wheels of any particular Government,
would tell you at once which of these
purposes it is intended for, for want of
which they cannot make the several
parts answer to their descriptions, and are
as strangely puzzled as a man would be
who should endeavour to explain to you
a pump, making you believe all the while
it was a machine to tell the hour of the
day; and then they find themselves obliged
to say, that the machine is made with such
exquisite skill, it is too difficult for any
but workmen to understand; whereas, if
they would fairly say, This Government
is not intended for the advantage of all,
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
but for the advantage of some men, or
bodies of men, it might appear to be very
ingeniously contrived for <HI>that</HI> purpose,
and might be comprehended with ease.
Governments are therefore of three sorts;
those intended for the advantage of one
man, those intended for the advantage of
a few men, and those intended for the
advantage of all men; of all which we
shall speak in their turns, and likewise
of chusing Governors.</P>
