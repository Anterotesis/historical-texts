<OPENER><DATE>December 17.</DATE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HAT a strange man this is, my
Cecilia! The more I reflect on his
conduct, the more I am amazed!
What a mixture is there in his Na∣ture!
Wild to a romantic de∣gree
in his conceptions, yet how steady, how
resolute, how consistent, in putting those
flights of fancy into act! Generous he cer∣tainly
is; how few men would put them∣selves
to the trouble and expence that he has
done, from such a disinterested, such a com∣passionate
motive! Nay, on the contrary, I
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
believe most men would be cruel enough to
take a sort of pleasure in the vexation of a
man, who had succeeded to the love of a
Mistress, once so much valued; and would
enjoy a mean triumph in being, though with∣out
reason, the object of <HI>his</HI> jealousy, who
had cut them off from all hope.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland is above this. I think my∣self
highly indebted to him, whether the
scheme he has in so extraordinary a manner
undertaken for my Service succeeds or not.
Yet do I wish from my heart, that the se∣paration
between Mr. Arnold and Mrs. Ger∣rarde
had been brought about by any other
means. What if Mr. Arnold should ever
come at the truth (though I think that hardly
possible) might it not leave him more estran∣ged
from me than he is even now? Or if
he should, in consequence of this odd ad∣venture,
return to his poor banished wife,
repent of his injurious suspicions of her, and
restore her to his confidence and love, can
he, can he ever restore to her that peace she
has so long been a stranger to? Will no
latent sparks of former unkindness ever re∣kindle
and light up the fire of discord? How
unwillingly do we repair the unprovoked in∣juries
which we find we have done to others!
Poor Mr. Arnold; if I am so happy as to
have my innocence cleared to him, how mi∣serable
will his own reflections make him!
But if he <HI>is</HI> convinced (which has been my
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
daily and hourly prayers), he <HI>shall</HI> not be
unhappy, if I can make him otherwise. Oh!
my dear, it is the wish, the ardent longing
of my soul, to recover the esteem, though I
lose the love, of Mr. Arnold! for I call that
Being to witness, who knows the secrets of
all hearts, that since I have been his wife, I
have never, even in thought, swerved from
that perfect and inviolable fidelity which I
vowed to him. What then must have been
my sufferings, deprived of his love, cast out
from his house, and branded with the dread∣ful
name of an Adultress? For where is the
difference between the intention and the Act?
To me there is no distinction, and the hus∣band
must be gross that makes one.</P>
<P>My mother has suffered me to tell her the
substance of Mr. Falkland's letters, tho'
she would not read them. I own I was
better satisfied that she should receive her
information thus, because his light manner
of expressing himself in many places would
have given her great offence. Sir George did
not consider this when he submitted the let∣ters
to my mother's as well as my perusal.
Many grave animadversions did she make
during my recital, and many Times lift up
her Eyes in wonder at Mrs. Gerrarde's be∣haviour.
She often said Mr. Faulkland was
frantic to undertake such a thing, and wished
he had not taken such a <HI>terrible</HI> woman in
hand. When I came to that part of the ac∣count
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
where Mrs. Gerrarde had been pre∣vailed
on to write to Mr. Arnold, I begged
she would give me leave to read the copy
of the letter to her, as I assured her there
was nothing in it but what would give her
pleasure.</P>
<P>She consented; and I read it, leaving out
Mr. Faulkland's apostrophes. My mother
did not interrupt me; and finding she con∣tinued
silent when I came to the conclusion,
I looked at her, and saw tears running down
her cheeks. Yes, my dear, my innocent
child, said she, passionately throwing her
arms round me, you <HI>were</HI> wronged; God
knows you were wronged; and He now
proclaims your innocence, even from the
mouth of your most inveterate enemy. And
lifting up her eyes, Thou hast turned the
hearts of sinners to the wisdom of the just;
therefore shall the righteous give Thee thanks.
And then, God forgive that woman all her
sins for this one act, and God forgive Mr.
Faulkland <HI>his</HI> sins, and reward him for this
goodness. Sure your husband will relent
now; sure he will long to take my poor,
forsaken, virtuous child (and her tears gush∣ed
as she spoke), to his bosom again.</P>
<P>I could not answer her for some time;
my own tears almost choaked me: at last I
said, My dear mother, I have no doubt of
Mr. Arnold's returning kindness: he will,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
I hope, be convinced that I am guiltless, and
we may yet be happy.</P>
<P>She dried her eyes: God send, God send
you may! But what has Mr. Faulkland
done with, his poor penitent? I hope he
will behave honourably to her; for this ex∣cellent
parent had no doubt but that the
letter, written by Mrs. Gerrarde, was, in a
great measure, the result of her own con∣trition;
for as I had not been minute in
giving her a particular account of all the
previous steps taken by Mr. Faulkland to
obtain it from her, she had not the least
idea that Mrs. Gerrarde had writ in that
manner from any other motive than the
good one which appeared obvious to her.</P>
<P>I told her, that I feared Mrs. Gerrarde
was far from being the penitent she supposed
her; and then acquainted her with the true
reasons which had induced her to write in
the manner she had done. I then proceed∣ed
to tell her of her behaviour after writing
the letter, and how Mr. Faulkland had act∣ed
in consequence of that; concluding with
informing her of Mrs. Gerrarde's being mar∣ried,
and provided for in a very reputable
way.</P>
<P>My mother was highly delighted at this
last circumstance; for, she said, M. Faulk∣land
had no right to be the punisher of her
crimes; and if he had not made a decent
provision for her, she would never have
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
looked upon him but as a dishonest person.</P>
<P>She told me, that though she was very
glad, upon the whole, that Mr. Arnold and
that bad woman were separated, yet she was
nevertheless not quite so well satisfied with
the manner of it; for I think, said she, that
it <HI>is</HI> impossible but that a man of Mr. Ar∣nold's
good sense must, one time or other, have
been convinced of his error, and, of his own
accord, returned to a right way of thinking.</P>
<P>I answered, that might possibly have hap∣pened:
but that he might have continued
long enough under his infatuation intirely to
ruin his family: and as for what regarded
me in particular, I knew of no means so like∣ly
to remove his unjust suspicions effectually,
as those which Mr. Faulkland had taken.</P>
<P>You are right, my dear, said she; let us
hope the best. I am glad Mr. Faulkland
does not mean to return soon to England:
there is but one event which could ever re∣concile
me to his doing so; and that is, in
order to do justice to the unfortunate Miss
Burchell. If he would wipe out that blot
in his Character by marrying her, I should
again allow him to be a good man: at present,
I own, I can't help being dissatisfied, that
one, so blameable as I think him, should
have laid my daughter under the obligations
which he has done.</P>
<P>I said it would rejoice me if he could be
prevailed on to make Miss Burchell the repa∣ration
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
she mentioned; but I feared she
had no advocate with Mr. Faulkland; tho'
I was of opinion, if he were made acquaint∣ed
with the life of sorrow she led, as well as
her reserved and modest behaviour, he would
be inclined to favour her; especially if he
were to see the poor little boy.</P>
<P>My mother said, he never could expect
quiet of mind, till he had wiped the tears
from her eyes.</P>
<P>Miss Burchell came in while we were speak∣ing
of her: my mother is always glad to see
her. The poor girl had been exceedingly
shocked at Mr. Faulkland's carrying away her
aunt. She thought this action put such an in∣vincible
bar between her and her hopes (al∣most
desperate before), that it went near to
distract her; for though there was no consan∣guinity
in the case, yet the degree of relation∣ship
between her and Mrs. Gerrarde, made
her look upon this amour (for so she consi∣dered
it) with the utmost horror. She had of∣ten
expressed her sense of it in so lively a man∣ner,
both to my mother and me, that had
Mr. Faulkland even been inclined to offer
her his hand, she could not, consistently ei∣ther
with virtue or common decency, have
accepted of it.</P>
<P>My mother, ever delighted with acts of
humanity, was in haste to communicate the
true state of the case to Miss Burchell. It
was her interest to keep our secret; therefore
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
I made no scruple of trusting her with it;
especially as I knew it would so much con∣tribute
to her peace of mind.</P>
<P>My mother accosted her with saying, Miss
Burchell, I have something to tell you, that I
believe will give you pleasure. The unhappy
young woman lifted up her melancholy eyes;
and, shaking her head, answered, <HI>That</HI> I be∣lieve,
Madam, is now impossible. Your aunt
is married, said my mother, but not to Mr.
Faulkland; and, what is more, there has ne∣ver
any thing passed between them that need
be a bar to you, if he could be brought to
consider you as he ought. Miss Burchell
looked amazed; then turned her eyes from
my mother to me, as if for an explanation.
My mother desired me to acquaint her with
the history at large of Mr. Faulkland's pro∣ceedings;
I did so, and took care not to
omit the tender manner in which he had
mentioned her in one of his letters. She
dropped some tears at the recital; and then,
turning to my mother, My dear good Ma∣dam,
you have snatched me from despair by
this discovery: I was over whelmed; I think I
could not have got the better of my grief:
a faint ray of glimmering hope is once more
let in upon me. Mr. Faulkland may <HI>yet</HI> be
mine without a crime; or, if he is not, I shall
at least have the satisfaction to think him not
so abandoned as he appeared to me an hour
ago. Oh! worthy and lovely Mrs. Arnold!
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
said she, addressing herself to me, you see
how Mr. Faulkland reveres you: oh! that
you would but engage in my behalf! <HI>you</HI>
can influence his heart; <HI>you</HI> can guide his
reason; <HI>you</HI> are his fate!</P>
<P>Her fine eyes, which she fixed on me, filled
with persuasive eloquence, let me into the
whole of her meaning, and conveyed more
to me than it was in the power of words to do.
I understand you, dear Madam, said I; and it
grieves my heart to think that I cannot, must
not interest myself for you in the manner I
would most ardently undertake to do, if there
were not such obstacles in my way, as it is im∣possible
for me to get over. Mr. Faulkland,
you see, is free from the guilt we all feared he
had plunged himself into: he is full of re∣morse
for the injury he did you, and I dare
believe, retains in his heart a tender sense of
your merit: he is still free; nay, he has de∣clared
his intention of continuing so. These
circumstances give large room for hope: your
unobjectionable conduct, joined to paternal
affection, may still bring about that wished∣for,
happy event; but this must be left to
time, and the workings of his own heart. You
know Mr. Faulkland is, in his natural temper,
impatient of restraint; he is but a very young
man, and has a few of those levities which a
little more settled age infallibly will correct,
where a good heart and a good understand∣ing
are united. Pardon me if I add, that
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Mr. Faulkland is not ungenerous, however
blameable he may have been in regard to you.
All these circumstances considered, I say, may
warrant your indulging a hope, that he will at
last be brought to make you the reparation,
which is mine and my mother's wish as much
as your own. Ah! Madam, said she, but
Mr. Faulkland is a great way from me: the
remembrance of me is already but too much
worn out; distance, time, and a variety of
objects, must intirely efface it. <HI>Your</HI> hand,
the powerful magic of <HI>your</HI> touch, would soon
brighten up the colouring of those faint,
faded traces, that he but scarcely preserves of
me in his memory. What could not your
pen, guided by a heart so tender, so sympa∣thizing
with the grief of others, effect on the
man who considers you as a divinity? If he
had any hopes of <HI>you,</HI> Madam, it would be
presumption in me to put in my claim; but,
as you cannot be my rival, be my advocate:
do, dear angelic lady! (and she lifted up her
hands to me fervently) write to Mr. Faulk∣land;
if you can restore him to me, what
prayers will I not pour out for your happi∣ness?</P>
<P>My mother, who was greatly affected at
her discourse, said to me, indeed, my dear,
if you could effect that, it would be a very
meritorious work. Who knows what the high
opinion Mr. Faulkland has of you, and the
great deference he pays to your judgment,
may produce?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
I was sorry my good mother's openness
of heart had made her enter so suddenly in∣to
Miss Burchell's sentiments: it encouraged
her to renew her intreaties; she snatched
both my mother's hands, and kissed them;
she wanted words to thank her.</P>
<P>I was unwilling to appear cold in Miss
Burchell's interest, or to refuse doing what
my mother seemed to approve; but the re∣solution
I had long before made, never to
see, or on any account whatsoever to hold the
least correspondence with Mr. Faulkland, de∣termined
me. If strict prudence might on so
extraordinary an occasion have dispensed with
this promise, which, as I had made it to my
own heart, I thought amounted almost to a
vow, I could not however answer it to that
decorum, which I had, as an inviolable law,
determined to guide myself by, in so critical
a situation. And I resolved to have it in my
power to say, in cafe Mr. Arnold and I were
ever to unite again, that I had not in the small∣est
article departed from it.</P>
<P>I told Miss Burchell there was but one rea∣son
which could prevent me from complying
with her request; but it was one of so much
weight with me, that, after my informing her
of it, I hoped she would be so good as not to
urge me farther. I did, said I, upon my
parting with my husband, make a firm re∣solution,
not only never to see Mr. Faulkland,
but never to receive from, or write a line to
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
him, nor in any manner whatsoever to keep
up the least intercourse with him.</P>
<P>I did not know but that Mr. Faulkland (if
he should learn the truth) considering himself
to be (as he really was, though innocently)
the cause of that unfortunate separation,
might, either with a design of consoling me,
or of vindicating himself from any suspicion
of blame, have endeavoured to see me or write
to me. In this I was mistaken; his prudence,
or his respect for me, prevented him from
attempting either. The resolution I had made,
however, I thought due to, my husband's ho∣nour,
as well as my own, The same cause
still subsists; the weight of it perhaps more
in my own imagination than in reality; but
if it even be so, indulge me, dear Madam
(to my mother), and dear Miss Burchell, in
this singularity. I have (not improbably),
the happy prospect of being restored to Mr.
Arnold's esteem; let me then be able to as∣sure
him, that these eyes, these ears, these
hands, have been as guiltless as my heart, and
all equally estranged from Mr. Faulkland.
This is a declaration I think due to that
punctilio, or, give me leave to call it, that
delicacy, I have endeavoured to preserve in
all my conduct. Mother! you always taught
me to avoid even the shadow of reproach.</P>
<P>Very true, my dearest, answered my mo∣ther;
I believe you are in the right. Miss
Burchell, I think my daughter cannot, con∣formably
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
to that discretion by which she has
always been governed, undertake your cause
at present: it did not appear to me at first
in the light wherein Sidney has, now put it.</P>
<P>Miss Burchell made no answer, but by her
tears; we were both affected, and I wished
sincerely to have had it in my power to serve
her. I told her, if Mr. Arnold and I should
ever be re-united, that I would endeavour
to draw him so far over to our party, as to
obtain his permission to correspond with Mr.
Faulkland: that I was sure he would join
with me in wishing her the reparation she
hoped for; and that I would make no
scruple of engaging warmly for her in such a
case. But then, Madam, said she, with what
face can you interest yourself for me, so long
as Mr. Arnold shall think that my aunt has
been criminal with Mr. Faulkland? That
thought, said I, did not occur to me before,
and is indeed a difficulty; for should Mr.
Arnold know that the elopement of Mrs.
Gerrarde was against her will, and the let∣ter
she wrote him extorted from her by
Mr. Faulkland, it might perhaps injure me
as much in his opinion, as Mrs. Gerrarde's
false suggestions had done before. Those in∣tricacies,
dear Miss Burchell, must be left to
time; which I hope may unravel them fa∣vourably
for us all. The attempt to dis∣close
this affair to Mr. Arnold must not be
sudden; Indeed I must be well assured of
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
his restored confidence and affection before I
can venture upon it at all. Whenever that joy∣ful
event happens, assure yourself of my best
endeavours to serve you, if I have really any
influence over Mr. Faulkland, and circum∣stances
should so happily concur as to put
it in my power to make use of it.</P>
<P>Be contented, good Miss Burchell, said my
mother, with this promise which my daughter
has made you: if Mr. Arnold and she should
live together again, Mr. Faulkland may pro∣bably
return to England; as nothing I be∣lieve
now keeps him abroad, but to avoid
giving Mr. Arnold umbrage, in the present
unhappy disunion between him and his
wife.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 18.—My brother continues
sullen; he seldom visits us, and when he
does, the meeting on his part is cold. He
has made himself master of many particu∣lars
relating to poor Mr. Arnold's unhappy
connection with Mrs. Gerrarde; for since
her elopement the affair has been more talk∣ed
of than it was before, and her whole hi∣story
traced out. She was the daughter of an
innkeeper in a country town, and ran away
with captain Gerrarde, in his march through
it, upon an acquaintance of but a few days.
The husband, who was passionately fond of
her, concealed the meanness of her birth,
and put her off to his relations for a young
lady of a reputable family, with whom he
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
got a good fortune. This induced his sister,
a widow lady, the mother of Miss Burchell,
to leave at her death the care of the un∣happy
girl to captain Gerrarde. The cap∣tain,
whose infirmities increased fast upon
him a few years after his marriage, got leave
to retire upon half-pay into the country; and
he lived for the most part at Ashby, a little
estate which he had purchased and settled
upon his wife: it seems he had a pretty good
personal fortune, which she had squandered,
for his fondness could refuse her nothing, ex∣cept
living apart from him at London, which
he could never consent to, though it was al∣ways
her desire; but being debarred of this,
she betook herself to such pleasures as the
country afforded, and was always a leading
woman at horse-races, assemblies, and such
other amusements, as were within her reach;
which, together with expensive treats at home,
and card-playing (her supreme delight) left
her at his death, which happened about five
years after their marriage, in the indigent state
she in her account of herself to Mr. Faulkland
acknowledges. It was then Mr. Arnold be∣came
acquainted with her, and in the manner
she represented; for my brother has lately
fallen into the acquaintance of that very <HI>rela∣tion</HI>
(as she calls him) which she mentions,
a Mr. Pinnick, at whose lodgings they first
met. This gentleman, who was in reality
nothing more than an humble servant of the
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
lady's, though she called him cousin, the
better to skreen a more particular connecti∣on,
was so provoked at her deserting him
in favour of Mr. Arnold, whom he said he
was sure she had insnared, that he made no
scruple of telling all he knew of her. He
said, she had two brothers, very great pro∣fligates;
one of whom had been put into pri∣son
for forgery, and would have been hang∣ed,
had not Mr. Arnold, at the expence of
a very considerable sum, saved his life. The
other, some very mean retainer to the law,
a plausible fellow, and Mrs. Gerrarde's great
favourite, for whom she had art and insluence
enough to prevail on Mr. Arnold to purchase
a considerable employment. It would be
endless, said Mr. Pinnick, to tell you the
variety of stratagems, she made use of to get
money out of those whom she had in her
power, and who were able to supply her.
I, for my part, was not rich enough for her,
which was the chief reason I suppose of Mr.
Arnold's supplanting me; and I take it for
granted, that those arts, which she practised
on me to little effect, succeeded better with
him. One time her poor father was in gaol,
and his whole family would be undone, and
her mother sent a begging, if he was not
relieved from his distress, by a trifling sum;
fifty pounds would do. Another time her
sister's husband, a country shopkeeper, was
upon the point of breaking, and would be
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
inevitably ruined if he was not assisted. And
then she had a formal letter to produce from
her sister upon the melancholy occasion.
These circumstances she made no scruple
of laying open to me, as she knew I was no
stranger to her origin, having resided for
some years in the town where she formerly
lived, though I did not then know her. Her
mother was a Roman Catholick; and in
order to have her daughter brought up in
the same principles with herself, had sent her
to a relation in Dublin, where she received
her education in a nunnery. Though her
artifices to get money from me were grown
quite stale, I make no doubt but she practi∣sed
them all over again on poor Arnold.
She was rot contented with the lodgings
I had placed her in, but obliged him to take
a handsome house, elegantly furnished for
her: a very fine chariot and horses were the
next purchase; for a hired one the lady
would not vouchsafe to sit in: and I am
sure I have seen her in the boxes at the play,
with as many jewels on her as any lady
there.</P>
<P>All these ungrateful particulars, which Sir
George had received from Mr. Pinnick, he
took a sort of ill-natured pleasure in repeating
to my mother and me. Unhappy Mr. Ar∣nold,
into what a gulph didst thou unwarily
plunge thyself! Is it not amazing that this
affair was even so long a secret? That it was
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
so to <HI>me</HI> is not strange; for it is natural to
suppose that I must have been the last person
to receive a hint of this nature; but that
my brother should never have been informed
of it is surprizing! 'Tis certain Mr. Arnold
was at first very cautious in his visits, make∣ing
them generally at night, and even then
he never was carried in his own chariot. I
am shocked to think of the mischiefs which
I fear he has done to his temporal affairs,
for his ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldren's sake as well as his own;
but since he is delivered from the thraldom
in which this woman held him, the rest, I
hope, by future good management, may be
retrieved. Would to heaven! I had nothing
left me to lament, but the waste of his for∣tune.
Sir George says he is sure he is deeply
in debt. The law-suit too I hear is likely to
go against us; if that is to be the case, it will
be a blow indeed!</P>
<P><HI>December.</HI> 19.—How miserable is a
state of suspence! I am, if possible, more
unhappy now, than when I was without
hope of recovering my dear, and now more
dear, because undone Mr. Arnold. Our
cause came to a final hearing many days ago
(though I was not told it 'till this morn∣ing),
and only prepared for it yesterday,
and it is given against us. Mr. Arnold by
this stroke loses 900 pounds a year, besides
considerable costs. Nothing now remains
but my jointure. Into what an abyss of
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
misery is my unfortunate husband plunged!
Oh! that I could but see him! that I could
but regain his considence, that I might sooth
and comfort him in his afflictions!</P>
<P>My brother is very unkind; after telling
me the fatal news, he said, he thought I should
be very much to blame if I returned to Mr.
Arnold, though he were even desirous of it,
What prospect can you have with him but
beggary? said he; for I suppose his next
step will be to wheedle you out of your join∣ture,
the only support you have now left <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
yourself and your children.</P>
<P>Oh! brother, brother, said I, you have
no heart! I could say no more, for I burst
into tears.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may not be put to the trial,
answered he cruelly; but if you should, you
are to take your own way, Mrs. Arnold, for my
advice had never any weight with you or my
mother.</P>
<P>My mother replied, Sir George, you do
not use either me or your sister well. Let
her, in the name of God, follow the dictates
of her duty. If the unfortunate Mr. Arnold
sees his error, can you be so unchristian as
to endeavour at steeling his wife's heart a∣gainst
him? O son! this is not the way to
obtain forgiveness of God for your own
faults! Far be it from Sidney to reject the
proffered love of a repenting husband. My
dear (to me) don't, afflict yourself; if your
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
husband has grace, you shall both be as
happy together as <HI>I</HI> can make you. Misfor∣tunes,
said Sir George, are mighty great pro∣moters
of <HI>grace;</HI> I don't doubt but Mr. Ar∣nold
will repent most heartily—the having
lavished away his fortune; and the hopes of
repairing it, may give him the <HI>grace</HI> to take
his wife again.</P>
<P>Sir George, said my mother angrily, you
will oblige me if you say no more on the
subject.</P>
<P>I have done, madam, said my brother, and
took his leave.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot to tell yon by what
means the widow Arnold carried her suit
against us. You may remember I informed
you she had at the beginning threatened to
produce a witness, who could prove that her
late husband had been with her on a particu∣lar
night, a very little time before his death.
Who this witness was, had been kept an im∣penetrable
secret. She did, however pro∣duce
him, when the cause came to be tried;
and this witness proved to be Mrs. Gerrarde's
brother. That very brother whom Mr.
Arnold had redeemed from a gaol and peril
of hanging. This man it seems had been
very intimate with her during her husband's
life-time, while she was in a state of sepa∣ration
from him: but whether he was at all
acquainted with, the late Mr. Arnold, we
have no other testimony than his own. 'Tis
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
however most certain, that she was suspected
of an intrigue with him, and in all human
probability that child, which is to inherit the
Arnold estate, is his.</P>
<P>This concealed villain undoubtedly was
the person who first suggested this vile at∣tempt
to her, and secretly abetted her in all
her proceedings. It was after the commence∣ment
of the law-suit that he was put into
gaol, and Mr. Arnold little imagined, when
under Mrs. Gerrarde's influence he obtained
his liberty, that he was bestowing on this
wicked wretch power to ruin him.</P>
<P>I do not imagine Mrs. Gerrarde was in
this secret. I suppose she would not know∣ingly
have contributed to beggar the man by
whom she was supported in affluence. But
be that as it will, the evidence of this fellow,
who was bred an attorney, together with
that of Mrs. Arnold's maid, established the
proof on which the issue of the whole affair
turned.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for us, we could find no∣body
capable of giving any testimony which
could overthrow theirs: and the irregularity
of the late Mr. Arnold's life gave these evi∣dences
an appearance at least of truth. God
forgive those people the foul play they made
use of! I would not possess a king's revenue
on the terms they now enjoy the Arnold
estate. 'Tis whispered, that the widow is
supposed to be privately married to this at∣torney;
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
she owes him a recompence; for I
fear he has risqued a great deal to serve her.
The wretch had the effrontery to acknowledge
his obligation to Mr. Arnold; and at the
same time declared, that nothing but the
justice which he owed the widow, and the
orphan of his late friend, could have extort∣ed
a testimony from him to his prejudice.</P>
<P>I need not tell you in what light my poor
Mr. Arnold looks upon this affair. He said
to a gentleman, from whom Sir George had
the account, that he was justlypunished for
having furnished such a villain with the means
of undoing him, and execrates the memory
of Mrs. Gerrarde, who prevailed on him to
do it; for he scarce knew the fellow at that
time, having only seen him once or twice
at her lodgings. But let me drop the men∣tion
of such wretches at once. My heart is
full of impatience to hear something from
Mr. Arnold. Mrs. Gerrarde's letter I fear
as had no effect on him; he must have re∣ceived
it long since. What can this dread∣ful
silence mean? My mother now expects
the advances towards a reconciliation should
be on <HI>his</HI> side. I would I were rid of my
suspence.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 29.—Lord and Lady V—
arrived in town last night. They sent a com∣pliment
to me as soon as they alighted at
their house, which was not 'till nine o'clock;
and this morning at the same hour I was a∣greeably
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
surprized by a visit from my lord:
surprized, I say, for he is seldom out of bed
so soon. I had him up to my dressing-room;
my mother had never seen him, and as she
was undressed, did not chuse to appear. Well,
my good lady, said he, after saluting me, have
you heard any-thing from Mr. Arnold lately?
I told him I had not. I don't know whether
you are apprized, said he, that I am in all your
secrets: Mr. Faulkland and I correspond,
and I know how all matters stand. You are
not made acquainted, perhaps, that I was
aiding and abetting to a certain scheme. I
told him that Mr. Faulkland had writ my bro∣ther
the whole account, and that I was sure
of his kind participation in every thing that
related to me. That you may depend on,
said he; the thing cannot be named that I
would not do to serve you. I understand
from Mr. Faulkland, that Mrs. Gerrarde has
writ to Mr. Arnold: Have you heard of no
effects produced by that letter? I told him,
I had never heard a word from Mr. Arnold
since he had received it. I hope it will not
be long before you will, answered he; I
called on you this morning on purpose to
prepare you; for I suspect Mr. Arnold
wants to be reconciled: he wrote to me ten
days ago, conjuring me in the strongest
terms to come to town, and to prevail on
lady V—to accompany me: he said he
had something of the utmost: consequence to
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
consult us upon, in which our friendship
might be of most material service to him:
he concluded with telling me, that the whole
happiness of his life depended on our com∣plying
with his request. Now as this was
immediately on his receiving Mrs. Gerrarde's
letter, for I had regular intelligence of the
whole proceeding, I flatter myself that it was
in consequence of that letter he made this
request, with a design, as I hope, of get∣ting
us to mediate between you. As I could
not just then attend his summons, having
business at V—hall to detain me, I wrote
him word, that I should certainly be in town
as on this day; and that lady V—would be
sure to accompany me. I have not heard
from him since 'till last night, when I sent a
message to his house to desire his company
to breakfast with me this morning; I expect
him at ten o'clock. Now I had a mind to
inform you of this opening, which to me
seems to promise very favourably for you.
I shall not mention my having seen you, so
that I can say nothing from you to him. I
asked him, was my lady acquainted with
the affair as it really stood? He said she was;
for that she had been so exasperated against
Mr. Faulkland on his first going off with
Mrs. Gerrarde, whom she thought he had
run away with upon a very different de∣sign,
that he was very glad to undeceive her,
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
and that she would presently have done the
same by me, after the letter she had wrote
me about that affair, but that he prevented
her, thinking Mr. Faulkland would be bet∣ter
pleased to unravel the mystery himself.
He added, that she was too much my friend,
not to enter warmly into my interests, and
had been extremely impatient to come to
town. I thanked my lord for his and his
lady's friendship. He then asked me how
our law-suit went on? I answered, it had
been determined some days ago, and we had
lost our cause. He turned pale at the news.
Good God! what an unfortunate man your
husband is, said he! What will become of
him?</P>
<P>He put an end to his visit immediately,
telling me, that either he or his lady would
call on me in the afternoon, to let me know
the result of their conference with Mr. Ar∣nold.</P>
<P>I flew to my mother, to tell her the joy∣ful
news. She offered up a prayer that it
might turn out as my lord V—had sugges∣ted;
and said, she herself was of the same
opinion.</P>
<P>With a heart elated with pleasure, my
dear Cecilia, I have scribbled over the occur∣rences
of this morning. God grant I may
be able to close my journal of to day with
the happy wished-for event!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
I never counted the clock with such impa∣tience
as I did this day, waiting the promi∣sed
visit of lord or lady V—, and I ordered
myself to be denied to all company but them.
At one o'clock good lady V—came, without
my lord. When I heard the rap at the door,
and saw from the window it was her equ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣page,
I was seized with such a trembling, that
when lady V—, who hurried up stairs, en∣tered
the room, I was unable to speak, or sa∣lute
her. She ran up to me, and taking me
by the hand, affectionately embraced me.
My mother was present; I made a shift to
present her to lady V—. She then led me to
a chair, and sat down by me. Come, my
dear Mrs Arnold, said she, recover your
spirits; all will be well. I began to apologize
for giving her ladyship the trouble of coming
to me, when it was my duty to have waited
on her. Do not mention ceremony, said she,
I was in too much haste to bring you good
news, to think of forms. We have had Mr.
Arnold with us till within this half hour, and
indeed he more deserves your pity now than
your resentment.</P>
<P>Oh! I feared it, said I, and tears started
into my eyes. If you are so affected at the
barely knowing this, said my lady, I must
not tell you the particulars of our conversati∣on;
it will be enough for you to know, that
your husband is convinced of the injuries he
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
has done you, and desires nothing more than
your forgiveness.</P>
<P>Dear lady V—, said I, excuse me; my
heart is really so softened by sorrow, that I
cannot command my tears. But I beg that
may not deter you from indulging me with
the particulars of what passed between you
and Mr. Arnold. If I do weep, as my tears
no longer proceed from grief, do not let them
interrupt you.</P>
<P>My mother joined in begging lady V—to
inform us of all that passed in that morning's
interview.</P>
<P>Lady V—obligingly complied, and gave
the following account of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold came exactly at ten o'clock;
my lord was just returned from his visit to
you, and had got in but a few minutes before
him. Poor Mr. Arnold looked abashed up∣on
seeing me; his countenance and his voice
discovered the humiliation of his mind. Af∣ter
the first compliments were over, we sat
down to breakfast; your husband drank a dish
of coffee, but eat nothing. We were in
haste, that the servants should leave the room,
and dismissed them as soon as we could. My
lord then opened the conversation, by saying,
Well, Arnold, here are lady V—and I
come to attend your summons; now tell us
what service you have to employ us in, for I
assure you, we are both ready to do you any
act of friendship in our power.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29"/>
My lord, I thank you, said Mr. Arnold;
the friendship you honour me with, I flatte∣red
myself, some time ago, might have been
serviceable to me; I must not now think of
making use of it. When I requested the fa∣vour
of lady V—'s presence and your's in
town, I meant to intreat your interposition
between me and Mrs. Arnold I know I
have wronged her so, that were she any other
than the woman she is, I could never hope
for forgiveness; but from <HI>her</HI> I did hope it,
and thought your good offices might bring
about a reunion. But that is all over, I nei∣ther
desire nor wish it now.</P>
<P>I am sorry for that, Mr. Arnold, said I;
I am sure nothing in this world besides can
ever make either your lady or you happy.</P>
<P>Do you know, madam, said he, (and the
poor man really looked wildly) that you see
an absolute beggar before you? A man with∣out
a foot of land, overwhelmed with debts,
and who shortly will not have a house to shel∣ter
himself in. <HI>I</HI> deserve it all, but Mrs.
Arnold does not. Do you think, that after
all the wrongs I have done her, I will involve
her in poverty too? No, lady V—, no. I
am not such an abandoned wretch. All I de∣sire
now of your ladyship is, to tell my wife
that I beg her forgiveness, and request she
will take care of our two children; through
the scanty pittance that her mother's scrupu∣lous
nicety retained for her will hardly ena∣ble
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
her to do it; but while lady Bidulph lives,
I believe she will not see them want.</P>
<P>He uttered all this with so much eagerness,
that we never once attempted to interrupt him.</P>
<P>As I did not then know of the loss of your
cause, I was surprized to hear him speak of
his circumstances being so desperate, and real∣ly
feared his head was turned. But my lord
soon explained the matter, by saying, he had
heard that morning of the Issue of his law∣suit,
yet still hoped, that matters were not so
bad as he represented them to be. He then
told Mr. Arnold, he was extremely glad to
find that his wife had recovered his good
opinion; adding, that <HI>he</HI> always had the
highest one of your virtue. It amazes me,
Mr. Arnold, said I, that you ever could en∣tertain
a doubt of it. So it does <HI>me</HI> now,
madam, said Mr. Arnold; but I have been
for this year past in a dream, a horrid deliri∣um,
from which that vile sorceress, who
brought it on me, has but just now rouzed me.</P>
<P>I wanted to draw Mr. Arnold to this
point. Have you heard any thing of her
since she left you, Sir, said I?</P>
<P>He drew a letter out of his pocket, and
without answering me, put it into my hands,
and desired me to read it; then rose off his
chair, and walked about the room.</P>
<P>My lord and I read Mrs. Gerrarde's letter
together; we were both curious to see it,
Mr. Faukland having mentioned it in his
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
correspondence. Mr. Arnold, said I, return∣ing
it to him, <HI>without</HI> any such proof as this,
I believe nobody that knows your lady would
think her guilty; nor could I ever entertain
so bad an opinion of Mr. Faulkland: I have
known him from his boyish days, and never
had reason to believe him capable of a disho∣nourable
action.</P>
<P>I believe him innocent, as to <HI>this,</HI> answe∣red
Mr. Arnold, but you cannot conceive the
pains that were taken by that vile woman to
make me think otherwise; neither would her
retracting all she said now work so much on
me, as other corroborating circumstances: her
running away with the very man, of whom
she raised my jealousy, after having plunder∣ed
me of almost every thing I had to bestow,
does not look like a sudden resolution: the
scheme must have been concerted for some
time, and Faulkland, I suppose, was <HI>her</HI> pa∣ramour,
at the very time she so basely slande∣red
Mrs. Arnold; for I am not so blind,
even to the personal charms of my wife, as
to imagine the greatest inconstant would grow
tired of her in so short a time.</P>
<P>Why, I must own, said my lord, that is a
natural inference, which, joined to the perfi∣dy
and falshood of Mrs. Gerrarde, puts it
out of dispute, that she traduced Mr. Faulk∣land
and your wife, merely to gain her own
wicked ends; one part of which I am incli∣ned
to think she confesses in her letter; that
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
is to say, to have you intirely in her own
hands, though not for the reason she there
gives. Her other motive, I think, now
plainly appears by the consequence: she
thought, if you were jealous of your wife,
you would hardly suspect <HI>her</HI> with the same
person, whose visits, to my knowledge, were
pretty frequent at her house. Then, said I,
(throwing my weight into the scale) the un∣objectionable
character of Mrs. Arnold, her
pious education, her modest and affectionate
behaviour to you for so long a time, and the
recluse life that she has led with her mother
since you parted, makes the thought of any
ill in her quite incredible.</P>
<P>Lady V—, said your husband, impatient∣ly,
I am as conscious of it all as you can pos∣sibly
wish me. I know I am a blind infatua∣ted
monster: What can you say more?
Faulkland, I thank you for ridding me of
such a pest; Oh! that you had taken her be∣fore
I was so curst as to see her face! If you
had, I should not now be the undone wretch
I am! My lord, my lady, will you do me the
favour to tell my wife and lady Bidulph, how
contrite I am (and he laid his hand on his
breast): while I had any thing to offer her
besides repentance, I could have thrown my∣self
at her feet for pardon, and conjured her
to have returned to my bosom, and to her
own deserted house, from whence my mad∣ness
drove her; but I have now no house to
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
bring her to, and do not desire even to see
her face.</P>
<P>His manner was so vehement, that I really
feared the agitations of his mind might disor∣der
his brain. My lord told him he was too
desponding, and said, he hoped all might be
yet retrieved. He then enquired into the par∣ticular
situation of his affairs, which are, I am
grieved to say it, very bad indeed. We were
told, when we were in Kent, that a part of
South-Park was mortgaged, but did not be∣lieve
it, as we knew it was settled on you.
Upon being asked, Mr. Arnold himself ac∣knowledged
it, confessing at the same time,
that he had been prevailed on to do this, in
order to deliver Mrs. Gerrarde's brother out
of goal, and that it was the other villainous
brother who had transacted the affair for him.
I find, besides this mortgage, that, with the
costs of his suit, he owes near seven thousand
pounds; to answer which, he says, he is not
worth six-pence, his plate and the furniture
of his houses in town and country excepted.</P>
<P>Though I have shed many tears, whilst La∣dy
V—was describing Mr. Arnold's behavi∣our
at the beginning of her discourse, I heard
this latter part of her account with a compo∣sed
attention.</P>
<P>Lady V—took me by the hand: I am
sorry, dear Mrs. Arnold, said she, that I am
obliged to repeat such uncomfortable tidings
to you, but you must know all, soon or late,
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
and it as well now as hereafter. I am sure
your patient temper and good sense will ena∣ble
you to bear up against misfortunes.</P>
<P>My lord then proceeded to ask Mr. Arnold,
if his friends could make his circumstances a
little easier, and Mrs. Arnold would consent
to live with him again, had he any objection
to it?</P>
<P>My lord, answered your husband, from the
moment I heard of Mrs. Gerrarde's elope∣ment,
I flattered myself with the hopes of be∣ing
restored to my senses, and my peace, by
a reunion with my wife; for I own to you,
her innocence from that very time became e∣vident
to me, and it was mere shame that
prevented me from making my application to
lady Bidulph, for the purpose of a reconcili∣ation.
The receipt of Mrs. Gerrarde's letter
—(whether the wretch has <HI>really</HI> felt com∣punction,
or whether her cruelty to me, in
order to make me more unhappy, has drawn
it from her I know not) the receipt of that let∣ter,
I say, wherein Mrs. Arnold s innocence
is so entirely cleared, convinced me, I ought
not to delay making my wife all the repara∣tion
in my power. Though I was shocked to
think how much I had foolishly squandered
away, I was still in possession of an estate of
nine hundred pounds a year; for though it
was then in ligitation, my lawyers amused me
to the last, with a belief that I should carry
my suit; and notwithstanding that the pay∣ment
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
of my debts would lessen it, I knew,
with one of her contented and gentle spirit, it
would be sufficient to make us happy, and her
jointure (which I hoped soon to clear) added
to it, would enable us to fit down in the coun∣try
in tolerable affluence, and I had come to
a resolution to make it the study of my life
to render Mrs. Arnold happy. I knew she
is an admirable oeconomist; I resolved to imi∣tate
her, and I hoped in time to retrieve our
circumstances. These were my sentiments,
my lord, when I wrote to you, to beg that
you and my lady would come to town. I own
I had not courage enough to make any efforts
towards the so much wished-for reunion, with∣out
the interposition of friends, whose good
hearts I knew would rejoice, could their endea∣vours
bring it about, and whose influence over
Mrs. Arnold I was certain would make the
accomplishment easy. Do me the justice my
lord, to believe, that if I had not thought it
in my power, to have made Mrs Arnold a∣mends
for the injuries I have done her, this
hand should have been sooner employed to
send a pistol bullet thro' my head, than to
have endeavoured to procure your mediation
in the affair.</P>
<P>But as things have turned out, I would not
for this earthly globe involve her in my ruin;
nor shall her family have it to say, I sought
their friendship when I was abandoned of eve∣ry
other hope.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36"/>
As to that point, answered my lord, I can
bear you witness, that your first overture to
me, in order to bring about a reconciliation,
arrived before there was any likelihood of
your standing in need of assistance, either from
your wife's friends or your own; for I believe
they all, as well as yourself, were pretty sure
of your carrying your suit, which, if you had
done, your affairs might, with a little care,
have soon been, in a great measure, retriev∣ed.
Therefore, if they should attempt to
make the ungenerous charge you apprehend,
I can confute it, and will to all the world;
and for the rest, we must manage as well as
we can.</P>
<P>My lord then proposed some methods to
make his affairs a little more easy; as I am
sure his friendship for Mr. Arnold and you
will make him endeavour to settle them to the
best of his power.</P>
<P>My lady V—'s politeness and generosity
would not suffer her to mention the particu∣lars
of the methods proposed; but I have rea∣son
to believe, my good lord V—will interest
himself rather farther than I wish.</P>
<P>When my lord and Mr. Arnold, she pro∣ceeded,
had talked over these matters for some
time, in which my lord had much ado to get
the better of Mr. Arnold's obstinacy, he told
him, that I should undertake to explain his
situation to you and lady Bidulph. That he
made no doubt of your tenderness in forget∣ting
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
all that was past, and being willing to
embrace his fortunes, let them be what they
would; for, said he, I am sure Mrs. Arnold
will think herself happier with you, on three
hundred pounds a year, than she would with
twice so many thousands without you.</P>
<P>Oh! madam, said I, interrupting her, my
lord has read my very heart.</P>
<P>My lady smiled and went on. Lady Bi∣dulph,
said my lord, is so good a woman,
that as she must look on you in the light of
a repenting sinner, you may be assured of her
pardon and favour. That he may rest sa∣tisfied
of, answering my mother. My in∣come
is not considerable, and I have never
been able to lay any thing by; but if Mr.
Arnold can be extricated from his present
difficulties, so as to be able to retire quietly
into the country, I will share that little with
him.</P>
<P>My lady V—'s Eyes moistened, mine
were quite suffused. I assure you, said lady
V—, it was not without abundance of ar∣guments
used by my lord, and downright
quarrelling on my side, that Mr. Arnold
could be prevailed on to consent that any
other application should be made on his part,
than that of acquainting you with his pen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tence,
and communicating his resolution, to∣gether
with his motives for it, of never seeing
you more.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
He says, Sir George Bidulph never was
his friend; and, as he supposes him more
now his enemy than ever, he would be sorry
to be under any obligations to him.</P>
<P>My mother who never conceals her
thoughts, answered directly, of that I be∣lieve
he need not be apprehensive; Sir
George is not very liberal; he would have
persuaded his sister against returning to her
husband, and I am sure will not be willing to
contribute towards making their reunion
happy. Besides, as he is now going to be
married, he troubles himself with little else
than his intended bride.</P>
<P>Lady V—seemed shocked; I was sorry
my mother had spoke so freely of Sir George,
to one who was an entire stranger both to
him and her; but she is so good, that even
her errors proceed from virtue.</P>
<P>Well, said lady V—, we have now seen
the worst side of the prospect; let us turn
our eyes towards the pleasanter view. What
do you mean to do, Mrs. Arnold?</P>
<P>Mean, madam, said I! To go directly to
my Husband.</P>
<P>Well, well, replied she, smiling, <HI>that</HI> I
suppose; but how do you purpose to settle
your little houshold matters?</P>
<P>I think, said my mother, the best thing you
can do, is, to go directly down to my house
in Wiltshire. You know <HI>that,</HI> and the furni∣ture
are mine, during my life; they go to your
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
brother afterwards. Send for your two chil∣dren
and honest Martha; dispose of your
house in town, and all your effects here, as
well as at South-park and in Essex—let
the produce be applied to the payment of
debts, as far as it will go. You will then
have your jointure to receive, to which I will
add two hundred pounds a year, which will
enable you, by degrees, to pay off the rest of
your debts, and I do not see why you may
not live comfortably besides.</P>
<P>Extremely well, said my lady, with Mrs.
Arnold's good management; especially as
they will not have the expence of house-rent.
I am sure my lord will willingly undertake
to manage Mr. Arnold's affairs in town for
him, and I would have you both get into
the country as fast as you can.</P>
<P>I am entirely of your opinion lady V—,
said my mother, What do you think, child?
Dear madam, I think that I am the hap∣piest
woman breathing. Such a parent as
you, such a friend as lady V—, and such a
husband, as I promise myself Mr. Arnold
will prove—How can I be otherwise than
happy? I am ready to do, to do joyfully,
whatever you direct. Dear lady V—, ought
not I to see poor Mr. Arnold immedi∣ately?</P>
<P>Why, said lady V—, I would not have
you surprize him; he is to dine with us
to-day, and I will prepare him to receive
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
you in the afternoon at my house, if you
chuse it.</P>
<P>By all means, my good lady V—, I will
come to your house at five o' clock. Well,
said she, bring a few spirits with you, and
do not let the interview soften you too
much.</P>
<P>Lady V—then took her leave, as she said
she should hardly have time to dress before
dinner. My mother and I spent the inter∣val
between that time and evening, in talk∣ing
of our future scheme of life. Remem∣ber,
my dear, said she, that when I die, you
lose the best part of your income, as my
house, together with my jointure, revert to
Sir George; and you have no great reason
to expect that he will continue either to you;
it therefore behoves you to use oeconomy,
as well for the sake of <HI>saving</HI> a little, as to
accustom yourselves to <HI>live</HI> upon a little.
I would myself accompany you down to
the country, but as my son's marriage is so
near, he would have reason to take it amiss
of me; and I know I shall have his imperi∣ous
temper to battle with, on our making up
matters between you and your husband;
but I shall make myself easy, by reflecting
that we have both acted agreeably to our
duty.</P>
<P>You never, my Cecilia, experienced such
a situation as mine, and therefore can have
no idea of what I felt, in expectation of see∣ing
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
the person, whose presence I most ar∣dently
wished for, and yet was afraid of the
interview. My fears were not on my own
account: conscious as I was of my innocence,
I had no apprehensions on that head: but I
could not bear the thoughts of beholding
poor Mr. Arnold, in the state of humiliation
in which I supposed I should find him. I
wished the first encounter of our eyes over;
and as the appointed hour approached, my
anxiety encreased: I was faint, and seized
with universal tremors My mother did all
she could to encourage me, and a little be∣fore
five o'clock, I was put into a chair, and
carried to lord V—'s house.</P>
<P>My lady met me on the stairs; I could
scarce breathe. She carried me into her
dressing-room, and made me sit down till I
recovered a little; she was affected herself,
but endeavoured to raise my spirits. I wish,
said she, smiling you had been in my lord's
hands, he would have prepared you better
than lady Bidulph has for this meeting; he
has been trying to make Mr. Arnold drunk,
in order to give him courage, he says, to face
you. Poor man, he could scarcely credit me
when I told him you were to come this even∣ing
She proposed my taking a few drops,
which I agreed to; and bidding me pluck
up my spirit, said she would send Mr. Ar∣nold
to me.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42"/>
I catched lady V—by the hand, and beg∣ged
she would desire him, from me, not to
mention any thing that was past, but let our
meeting be, as if the separation had only been
occasioned by a long journey.</P>
<P>She left me, and Mr. Arnold in a few
minutes entered the room. He approached
me speechless; my arms were extended to
receive him; he fell into them; we neither
of us spoke; there was no language but
tears, which we both shed plentifully. Mr.
Arnold sobbed as I pressed him to my bosom.
My dearest Sidney, said he, can it be! Is it
possible that you love me still?</P>
<P>If lady V—delivered my message to you,
my dear Mr. Arnold, sure you would not
speak thus to me.</P>
<P>I understand you, said he; Oh! my dear:
I never wished for wealth or length of days,
till now—but what I can I. will.</P>
<P>Forbear, my love, said I; remember my
request. I wanted to give his thoughts ano∣ther
turn. My mother longs to see you:
When will you visit her.</P>
<P>I will throw myself at her feet, said he; I
want a blessing from her, and she has sent
me one, throwing his arms again round
me.</P>
<P>How much are we obliged to good lord
and lady V—, said I.</P>
<P>Oh! they have opened to me the path to
Heaven, he answered—if it had not been for
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
them—I think we had better go to them,
said I, they will partake in our happiness.</P>
<P>He took me by the hand without an∣swering,
and led me into the drawing∣room.</P>
<P>I have, my sister, endeavoured to recol∣lect
our disjointed conversation, in order to
give it to you as well as I could. All that I
can remember I have set down, though I am
sure a good deal more passed.</P>
<P>Lord V—'s eyes sparkled when he saw us
enter together; but my lady and he, I sup∣pose,
had agreed before-hand to say nothing
that could recall any past griefs, for they on∣ly
smiled at our entrance; and my lord said,
Arnold, you really hand your lady in with as
gallant an air, as if you were married with∣in
these three hours. And so I have been,
my lord, answered Mr. Arnold. My lady
presently called for tea, and we chatted as if
nothing had happened. The servants wait∣ing
in the room made this necessary; though
I could observe the two footmen, who had
lived a good while with lord V—, looked
with no small astonishment at Mr. Arnold and
me.</P>
<P>When the servants were withdrawn, my
lady introduced the subject of our going out
of town. She had before acquainted him
with my mother's proposal, and I repeated
what she had said to me on that head, after
ady V—had left us. My lord renew∣ed
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
the kind offers of his friendship, and said,
as we meant so shortly to part with our house
in St. James's street, that he thought it would
be better for us not to go into it at all, but
make use of his house while we staid in
town; as perhaps Mr. Arnold might not like
to be at lady Bidulph's, on account of Sir
George's coming there.</P>
<P>I readily assented to this proposal; and
Mr. Arnold said it would be most agreeable
to him. I told him, however, I should be
glad of my mother's approbation; and ask∣ed
Mr. Arnold if he did not think it would
be right of us both to wait on her together,
to let her know of my lord's kind invitation.
My lady V—said, by all means, and the
sooner the better: if you please, I will order
the chariot; I would have you see lady Bi∣dulph
directly. Mr. Arnold said, it was
what he purposed doing that very night.</P>
<P>The chariot was presently at the door: la∣dy
V—said, I have an apartment rea∣dy,
and shall, with lady Bidulph's permissi∣on,
expect you back to-night. We promised
to return, and drove to my mother's.</P>
<P>I left Mr. Arnold in the parlour, whilst I
ran up stairs to inform her of his being come
to wait on her.</P>
<P>Unluckily, as well as unexpectedly, I found
my brother with her. I judged by his voice,
as I came up stairs, that he was talking
warmly to my mother; he stopped, however,
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
when I came into the room. He was stand∣ing,
and had his hat under his arm. I con∣cluded
he was going, and was not sorry for
it; he cast a cold look at me, and, with an
ironical smile, I wish you joy Mrs. <HI>Arnold,</HI> and
he pronounced my name with an emphasis.
Tho' I was stung at his manner, I would not
let him see it. Thank you brother, said I,
God be praised I <HI>have</HI> cause to rejoice. Oh!
no doubt on't, said he, so have we all, that
your husband has been graciously pleased, af∣ter
beggaring you and your children, turning
you out of doors, and branding you with
infamy, to receive you at last into his fa∣vour.</P>
<P>Sir George, said I, you shock me exceed∣ingly:
where is the need of those cruel re∣petitions?
Indeed you are very unkind; and
I could not refrain from tears.</P>
<P>The more blameable Mr. Arnold's con∣duct
has been, said my mother, the more
cause have we to rejoice in his amendment.
We must make allowances for human fail∣ings.</P>
<P>Ay, madam, I wish you had thought of
that in Mr. <HI>Faulkland</HI>'s case, cried my bro∣ther.</P>
<P>My mother seemed discontented at the re∣buke.
Sir George looked and smiled, with
an air of ill-natured triumph. As my mo∣ther
was not quick in answering, I replied,
the cases are very different, brother; what
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
duty obliges us to pass by in a husband, it is
hardly moral not to discountenance in another
man.</P>
<P>You say true, child, said my mother; a
woman certainly ought not to marry a loose
man, if she knows him to be such; but if it
be her misfortune to be joined to such a one,
she is not to reject him, but more especially
if she sees him willing to reform. Where is
your husband my dear? Madam, he is be∣low
in the parlour: he is come to receive
your forgiveness, and your blessing. He shall
have both, said my good mother, and my
prayers too. Sir George looked a little sur∣prized:
I will not interrupt so <HI>pious</HI> a cere∣mony,
said he, but I hope you will give me
leave to withdraw before you desire him up
stairs; saying this, he bowed slightly to my
mother, and left the room: we neither of
us said any thing to stop him; my mother
rang the bell, but before a servant could at∣tend,
he went out, and clapped the door vio∣lently
after him.</P>
<P>Go bring your husband up to me, said my
mother. I begged she would not mention
any thing of Sir George's behaviour. I found
Mr. Arnold impatient at my stay. Poor man,
his situation made him jealous of every thing
that looked like a slight. I told him, my
brother had been above stairs, and as I did
not think a meeting would at that time have
been agreeable to either of them, I waited
till he was gone. I perceive he knew <HI>I</HI> was
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
in the house, said Mr. Arnold, by the blus∣tering
manner of his departure. I made no
reply; but taking him under the arm, led
him to my mother.</P>
<P>That best of women received him with a
tenderness that delighted me; he put one
knee to the ground while she embraced him
with maternal love, then raised him, and ta∣king
his hand and mine, joined them, hold∣ing
them between her own. God bless you
my children, said she, and may you never
more be separated, till God, who joined you,
calls one or other of you to himself. Amen,
cried I fervently. Amen, repeated Mr. Ar∣nold.</P>
<P>He then besought my mother to forgive
him for all the affliction he had occasioned
both to her and me; assuring her that his
veneration for her, and his tenderness for me,
were augmented a hundred - fold, and
should for the future influence his whole con∣duct.</P>
<P>After this, we fell on the subject of our do∣mestick
affairs: we informed my mother of
my lord V—'s proposal, and said, as we
should stay in town but two or thee days, we
had accepted of the offer of being at his house,
rather than by our presence banish my bro∣ther
from her's.</P>
<P>He is an untractable man, said she; but
as I do not wish to quarrel with my children,
I think it will be prudent for you to stay at my
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
lord's rather than here. Mr. Arnold said his
obligations to lord V—were unspeakable;
for that he had promised not only to see all
our affairs properly settled, but to take the
mortgage of South-Park into his own hands,
as he fears the person who now has it will not
be so tender a creditor as himself. He also
proposes (as the sale of my effects cannot a∣mount
to what my debts come to) to pay
what may be deficient, and make himself
my sole creditor. If it had not been for such
a prospect as this, added my dear Mr.
Arnold, notwithstanding your goodness
and lady Bidulph's, I had resolved never to
have appeared before either of you.</P>
<P>We determined to set out for Sidney∣Castle
in three or four days at farthest;
and took leave of my mother for this
night.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 21.—I told lady V—this
morning, that though I was determined ne∣ver
to mention our past misfortune to Mr.
Arnold, yet I owned I had a great curiosity
to know what means Mrs. Gerrarde had
made use of, to work up his suspicions to
the high pitch she had done; but I would ra∣ther
remain unsatisfied, than mortify him by
the recollection of this particular.</P>
<P>I can inform you of her whole proceed∣ings,
answered lady V—, as I had it from
Mr. Arnold himself; for to tell you the truth,
I was as curious about that as you, and took
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
the liberty to ask your husband concerning
it yesterday, when we had him to ourselves.
It was the interval between dinner, and the
hour that you were expected here in the even∣ing,
that I laid hold of for this purpose, as I
found him then composed enough to bear the
enquiry.</P>
<P>He told me, that from the time of his go∣ing
down to South-Park, Mrs. Gerrarde
had begun to throw out insinuations concern∣ing
you, that had a little alarmed him. She
asked him, Whether you made a good wife?
which he answering in the affirmative, she re∣plied,
she was glad of it; for that she had
been told your affections were formerly deep∣ly
engaged to a very fine young gentle∣man,
who, as his fortune was very much
above your expectations, your mother, fear∣ing
your violent fondness for him might lead
you into some act of indiscretion, had carried
you out of town on purpose to avoid him;
and was glad to marry you as hastily as
she could, to put you out of the reach of
harm.</P>
<P>Your husband acknowledges, that he be∣lieves
he had himself casually informed Mrs.
Gerrarde of the manner of his first becom∣ing
acquainted with you, and the suddenness
with which his marriage was concluded; yet
she pretended to him, she was before ap∣prized
of these particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50"/>
He owns that those hints, though far from
giving him any suspicion of your virtue, had
nevertheless made some impression on him.
You know, Madam, added he, that, madly
devoted as my affections were to Mrs. Ger∣rarde,
I had always behaved to my wife
with great tenderness and respect. This I
suppose it was which raised Mrs. Gerrarde's
jealously, and made her leave no method un∣attempted
to part us. Mr. Faulkland had
not been long at V—hall, when she asked
me, with uncommon earnestness, whether he
visited at my house; I told her he did not,
and asked the meaning of her enquiry. She
affected to turn it off, and said, she had no
particular reason for her question; but her
manner was such, as the more excited my
curiosity. At length she was prevailed on to
tell me, that Mr. Faulkland was the man
(for she had not before named the person),
whom my wife had so passionately loved. Pre∣possessed
as I was with jealousy, I now took
the alarm. I recollected that Mrs. Arnold
had told me at lord V—'s, upon my first
seeing him there, that she <HI>had</HI> been very well
acquainted with him; and I even thought
that I had observed something particular in
his countenance when he addressed her. I
was now sure that he had come into the
neighbourhood merely on her account. The
hell that I suffered is not to be described; for
though I really fancied that I had conceived
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
almost an aversion to Mrs. Arnold, I yet
could not bear the thoughts of being disho∣noured.
An accident happened which served
to strengthen my suspicions: he then related
the▪ circumstance of his seeing you at the
public house on the night of the fire; and of
his finding Mr. Faulkland putting you into
your chariot. He owned at the same time,
that he was there with Mrs. Gerrarde, whom
he had conducted out of the play-house, hav∣ing
called for her there in his return from
making a visit, as he had promised to sup
with her that night. Mrs. Gerrarde, when
she had him at her house, affected to speak
with some surprize of your imprudence, in
suffering a young man of Mr. Falkland's
<HI>known</HI> turn for gallantry, to attend you to
<HI>such</HI> a place, and at that hour. Though,
added he, Mrs. Arnold's own account of this
had satisfied me at the time, yet Mrs. Ger∣rarde's
insinuations blew up the fire anew in
my breast. She pretended to sooth me; but
the methods she took rather increased my
uneasiness. She told me, she believed my
honour as <HI>yet</HI> had received no injury; and to
preserve it effectually, she thought I could
not do better than to forbid my wife to see
Mr. Faulkland. The designing vile woman,
continued your husband, knowing that this
prohibition would cut off her visits at
V—hall, no doubt apprehended my wife
would not so readily acquiesce under it; and
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
she was sure any resistance on her part would
but the more inflame me. But in this she
was disappointed; for I no sooner required
Mrs. Arnold's promise on the occasion, than
she, without the least hesitation, made it.
My requiring so extraordinary a proof of her
obedience, induced Mrs. Arnold to enquire
into the cause, and upon my explaining it,
she acknowleged that Mr. Faulkland had
once been her lover, and that the match was
broken off by her mother, who had conceiv∣ed
some dislike to him. This was so far
from gaining credit with me, that it only
served to corroborate what Mrs. Gerrarde
had told me. I was, however, contented for
the present with the promise that my wife
had made me; of which I informed Mrs.
Gerrarde.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to tell me of his find∣ing
you and Mr. Faulkland together one
evening at the house of Mrs. Gerrarde. I
must confefs, continued he, this unexpected
incident transported me beyond the bounds
of patience: I suffered, notwithstanding, Mr.
Faulkland to go quietly out of the house,
more for Mrs. Gerrarde's sake than any other
consideration, and permitted her to go home
with my wife (who I then thought <HI>pretended</HI>
illness), waiting in the mean time at her house
for her return, in order to have this extraor∣dinary
and unexpected meeting explained.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53"/>
Mrs. Gerrarde, on her return expressed the
utmost concern and resentment on the occasi∣on.
She told me, that as she had expected me
that evening (which was really the case), she
had sent to my wife to engage her for the
next day, in order to prevent her coming to
interrupt us, which was not unlikely, as Mrs.
Arnold had not been to see her from the time
she was laid up by the hurt she received;
and she said, she did not care to lay herself
so open to her servants, as to have herself
denied to the wife, whilst she entertained the
husband.</P>
<P>I myself, continued he, having the same
apprehensions, had asked Mrs. Arnold, on
my going abroad in the morning, how she
purposed to dispose of herself for the day;
and she had told me she intended to stay at
home. Mrs. Gerrarde said, that notwith∣standing
her message, she was surprized with
a visit from Mrs. Arnold just as she was sit∣ting
down to dinner; that she however put a
good face on the matter, and received her
very cordially; but in order to get rid of her
soon, told her, she was engaged abroad in
the afternoon. Mrs. Arnold, she added,
however thought proper to stay, and I could
not avoid asking her to drink coffee. While
we were at it, behold, to my very great
surprize, Mr. Faulkland sent in his name,
and immediately entered the parlour.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54"/>
As I guessed, continued Mrs. Gerrarde,
that this was a settled assignation, I own I
was extremely provoked at it. Mr. Faulk∣land,
with whom I formerly had a very slight
acquaintance at Bath, <HI>so</HI> slight indeed as ne∣ver
to be visited by him, now very audaci∣ously
made an apology for not having waited
on me sooner; but said, that he did not hear
of my being in the neighbourhood, 'till a day
or two before, and hoped I would allow him
the honour of renewing his acquaintance. I
had hardly temper enough to make him a
civil answer; but said, I was sorry I was en∣gaged
that evening, and must be obliged to
go out immediately. I thought this hint was
enough for Mrs. Arnold; and that she would
have had the discretion to have taken her
leave. She asked pardon for having kept
me at home so long, protesting she had really
forgot that I told her I was engaged. She
begged she might not detain me any longer,
saying, she had ordered her chariot to come
for her in the evening, and that she would
wait for it, as she found herself not very well,
and therefore not able to walk home. I now
saw into the whole scheme: Mr. Faulkland
would naturally stay to keep her company,
and they would have my house to themselves;
but I resolved to disappoint them both; and
telling Mrs. Arnold I would leave her at
home, ordered the chariot to the door. Mrs.
Arnold opposed this, under pretence of not
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
giving me so much trouble, and pretending
to be sick and faint, said, she would step to
the door, in order to get a little more air; I
followed her hastily, and your coming in the
instant, I suppose, detained Mr. Faulkland in
the parlour, for he could not but see you
from the window. You know the rest, added
Mrs. Gerrarde; and I leave you to judge,
whether Mrs. Arnold be inclined to keep her
word with you, in regard to Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>Can you blame me, Madam, proceeded
your husband, if, after what I now saw and
heard, I was enraged almost to madness
against my wife? The base woman, who had
now accomplished her wicked purpose, en∣couraged
me in my desperation. In the midst of
my fury, however, I could not help making
one observation, which was, that as Mrs.
Gerrarde's going, or pretending to go out
that evening, was a casual thing, they could
hardly have expected an opportunity of being
<HI>alone</HI> at her house, even though the meeting
was concerted. Mrs. Gerrarde answered,
That was very true; and she supposed there
was nothing at first farther intended, than
that the <HI>lovers</HI> should have the pleasure of
seeing and conversing together, as they had
been so long separated; the other, to be sure,
said she, was an after-thought, which the
opportunity suggested. She then, after mak∣ing
me swear secrecy, told me, that Mrs.
Arnold had, when she followed her out to
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
the door, conjured her not to tell me that
Mr. Faulkland and she (Mrs. Gerrarde) were
acquainted; for, said she, as Mr. Arnold is
of a jealous temper, and has heard that Mr.
Faulkland formerly courted me, he would not
suffer me to come near your house, if he
knew that Mr. Faulkland visited you. I pro∣mised
her I would not, added Mrs. Gerrarde;
and I make no doubt but that she hoped in
time (relying on my good nature, my seem∣ing
fondness for her, and the easiness of my
temper) to engage me as the confidant and
abetter of her loose amour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde concluded with saying, that
she believed nothing criminal had as <HI>yet</HI> pas∣sed
between Mr. Faulkland and my Wife, at
least since his coming to V—hall; but as
there was no with holding a woman from her
will, it was very probable that Mrs. Arnold
would contrive the means of meeting, though
not at <HI>her</HI> house, yet somewhere else, I
raved, threatened, talked of fighting Faulk∣land,
and locking up my wife. She artfully
dissuaded me from such violent measures by
a number of arguments, which I will not
trouble you with repeating: Amongst other
things, she said, that I had no right to call
Faulkland to an account merely from surmise,
which was all I had to ground my charge on;
and though there was the strongest reason to
believe he had dishonourable designs on Mrs.
Arnold, yet as I could not directly accuse him
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
of them, I should be laughed at for engaging
in a quarrel, which to the world would ap∣pear
to be so ill-grounded. As to what I threa∣tened
in regard to my wife, she said, such
measures only make a woman desperate, and
would be far from preventing the evil; in
short, that it would be better to part quietly,
without embroiling myself with her friends,
or undertaking the hateful office of becoming
g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aler to my wife. She found me but too
well disposed to follow her fatal council. I
wrote that cruel letter to my wife, which
turned her from her home, at Mrs. Gerrarde's
house. She kept me with her till midnight;
and had worked up my resentment to such a
pitch, that I determined not to see Mrs. Ar∣nold
any more. To avoid expostulations, I
went to a friend's house, at the distance of
several miles. When I came back, Mrs.
Gerrarde told me that Mr. Faulkland was
absent from V—hall, and she concluded the
lovers were now together.</P>
<P>I interrupted your husband at this part of
the story, pursued Lady V—, and told him,
that to <HI>my</HI> knowledge Mr. Faulkland had
gone to Sidney-Castle, to see Sir George
Bidulph, before you left your own house;
and did not set out from thence on his re∣turn
'till about three weeks after your separa∣tion;
at the account of which he was exceed∣ingly
surprized.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58"/>
Dear Lady V—, said he, do you think I
<HI>now</HI> want any farther arguments to convince
me what an injurious wretch I have been to
the best of women?</P>
<P>I have one observation to make to you,
Mr. Arnold, added I; which is, that your
lady's misfortune was intirely owing, to her
great delicacy, and the nice regard she had
to your peace and honour.</P>
<P>I do not understand you, Madam, he re∣plied.</P>
<P>Know then, said I, that your wife was well
acquainted with your connection with Mrs.
Gerrarde, from the very night that you found
her at the public house, to which the accident
that happened to her obliged her to go. She
owned to me, at the time you drove her
from her home, that she had discovered your
amour from a conversation she overheard that
night between you and Mrs. Gerrarde. This
I extorted from her, by letting her know I was
no stranger to the intrigue. I then repeated
to him the discourse that passed between him
and that wicked woman, as far as you had
told me, and he very well remembered it.
Now, Mr. Arnold, said I, to prove the asser∣tion
I made in regard to your lady, had she
reproached you with your infidelity, as <HI>some</HI>
wives would have done, tho' it might have oc∣casioned
a temporary uneasiness to you both,
yet would it have prevented her from falling a
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
sacrifice to that most artful and wicked of her
sex; for you could not then have had such
an improbable falshood imposed on you, as
that Mrs. Arnold would have made choice of
the <HI>mistress</HI> of her husband for a confidant,
and fix on <HI>her</HI> house, as the rendezvous for a
love intrigue. The base woman herself had
no reason, from Mrs. Arnold's prudent and
gentle behaviour, to think she was suspected
by her.</P>
<P>Your husband lifted up his eyes to hea∣ven;
and striking his breast, blind, blind
wretch, he cried! infatuated, ungrateful
monster! are there no amends—no
amends in thy power for such goodness?</P>
<P>I could not bear such a description of my
poor Mr. Arnold's deep contrition. I stop∣ped
Lady V—; and, being now informed
of all I wanted to know, changed the con∣versation.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 22.—We are preparing to get
into the country with all speed. I have
writ to Patty to set out with the two children
for Sidney-Castle as soon as possible. Mr.
Arnold has put his affairs intirely into the
hands of our worthy friend Lord V—, and
we think, upon a calculation, that what
we have in town, at South-Park, and at Ar∣nold-Abbey,
will go near to answer the pre∣sent
demands that are upon us.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60"/>
Lady V—is the best creature living; she
knows that neither Mr. Arnold nor I chuse
to see any visitors, and she has let in none
these two days. I am vexed at laying her
under such a restraint, though her good-na∣ture
will not suffer her to think it one. We
shall go out of town on Monday; to mor∣row
we spend with my mother, as do Lord
and Lady V—(who are mightily charmed
with her), and then adieu to London, per∣haps
for ever. If my mother comes down
to me, as she intends to do, I shall have no
temptation ever to return to it.</P>
<P>Sidney-Castle, <DATE>December 29.</DATE></P>
<P>Here am I, my dear, in the house of my
nativity. Your Sidney and her Arnold as
happy as a king and a queen! or, to speak
more properly, happier than any king or
queen in christendom. My two dear little
girls are well, thank God! and look charm∣ingly.
Poor babes! they could have no idea
of their loss when I left them, yet they now
seem pleased at seeing me again. My faith∣ful
Patty is almost out of her wits with joy.
I have no maid but her, and an honest ser∣vant,
whom my mother left here to look
after her house. Mr. Arnold has retained
but one of his men: the garden is taken care
of by an old man in the neighbourhood, to
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
whom my mother allows something for keep∣ing
it in order.</P>
<P>With what delight do I recall the days of
my childhood, which I passed here so happily!
You, my dear Cecilia, mix yourself in all
my thoughts; every spot almost brings you
fresh into my memory. The little filbert∣wood,
the summer-house, the mount, and
the chesnut-close that you used to love so!
but the sight of your old dwelling makes me
melancholy. I think I could not bear to go
into the house; the deserted avenue to me
appears much darker than it used to do;
and your poor doves are all flying about
wild, and I think seem to mourn the absence
of their gentle mistress. Oh! Cecilia, how
exquisite are the pleasures and the pains that
those of too nice feelings are liable to! You,
whose sensibility is as strong as mine, know
this. From what trifles do minds of such a
turn derive both joy and grief! Our names,
our virgin names, I find cut out on several
of the old elm trees: this conjures up a thou∣sand
pleasing ideas, and brings back those
days when we were inseparable. But you
are no longer Rivers, nor I Bidulph. Then
I think what I have suffered since I lost that
name, and at how remote a distance you are
from me; and I weep like a child—But
away with such reflections: I am now hap∣pier,
beyond comparison happier, I think,
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
than I was before my afflictions overtook me.
Mr. Arnold's <HI>recovered</HI> heart I prize infinite∣ly
more than I did when he first made me
an offer of it; because I am sure he gives it
now from a thorough conviction that I de∣serve
it, and therefore I am certain never to
have it alienated again.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 4.—It is almost three years since
I left this place; and the welcomes I have
received from all our old neighbours and ac∣quaintance,
have given me more satisfaction
than I can express. Mr. Arnold is highly
pleased with the marks of affection which he
sees me daily receive, from those who have
known me from my infancy. I am the more
delighted with it, as I think it gives me an
additional value with him. 'Tis a proof at
least that I never misbehaved during the
long number of years that our former friends
knew me, and we must needs be pleased to
see the object of our love approved of by
others. This I speak from my own experi∣ence.
Mr. Arnold is exceedingly caressed
by all our friends, and seems equally delight∣ed
with them: you know we have some of
the best people in the world amongst our old
set of acquaintance. If you, my mother, and
good Lady V—, were within my reach, I
should think Sidney-Castle a paradise.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63"/>
<HI>January</HI> 10.—I have had two letters to∣day;
one from Lady V—, the other from
my dear mother. Lady V—tells me her
lord is bustling about for us, to put affairs
in the best condition he can. She says, he
has already got a purchaser for the lease of
our house in St. James's-Street; and all the
moveables in it, as they now stand. They
have been valued at two thousand seven hun∣dred
pounds. As most of our plate is there,
as well as our chariot and a pair of horses,
this has fallen very short of our expectations;
but Lady V—says, she is sure there was not
more allowed for the furniture than half their
original value, though they have not been a
great while in use. She tells me, that my
lord has employed a person to go down to
Arnold-Abbey, to dispose of the things there;
but she fears we shall receive a very indiffe∣rent
return from thence, as there is but part
of the furniture of Mr. Arnold's putting in,
the old goods going together with the house
to the widow. My lord's steward at V—hall
has instructions about South-Park: he writes
word to his lord, that he believes the whole
of what is there will not sell for more than
four hundred pounds: the house indeed was
but small, and the furniture not expensive.
Mrs. Gerrarde, he says, has had an attach∣ment
laid on her house by a person who built
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
some bauble for her in her garden, for which
he claims a debt, of ninety pounds, though
the steward says it is not worth thirty. “All
things, however, my lady adds, shall be
adjusted in the best manner we can; and
my lord will not let Mr. Arnold be dis∣tressed
on account of any deficiency that
may happen in those sales.” What a jewel,
my Cecilia, is an honest warm friend!</P>
<P>The contents of my mother's letter are,
That Sir George was married yesterday to
Lady Sarah P—. She says, the bride was
most extravagantly fine; but looked neither
handsome nor genteel. This was much for
my good mother to let drop from her pen;
but I know she never liked Lady Sarah, nor
did her ladyship ever treat her with the re∣gard
due to her character, and to the person
of one who was to stand in the close and re∣spectable
degree of relationship to her, which
my mother now does. But I believe I have
before told you, that the blessings of good
sense and good temper are bestowed but in
a moderate degree on Lady Sarah; and for
a woman of quality, Lady V—tells me (for
I have never seen her), that her breeding is
not of the highest form. But you know a
great fortune covers a multitude of imper∣fections
in the eyes of most people, and I
hope her love for my brother will make her
a good wife.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65"/>
<HI>January</HI> 23.—I am grown a perfect far∣mer's
wife, and have got a notable dairy;
I am mistress of three cows, I assure you,
which more than supply my family; then I
have the best poultry in the country, and my
garden flourishes like Eden. Mr. Arnold
is such a sportsman that we have more game
than we know what to do with; but his
chief pleasure is hunting.</P>
<P>Your little namesake promises to be the
greatest beauty in the county. Dolly, who
is a pretty little cherry-cheek, and her fa∣ther's
great favourite, prates like a parrot.
How delightful will be the task of expanding
and forming the minds of these two cherubs!
how joyfully and how thankfully do I look
back on the troubled sea which I have pas∣sed!
My voyage indeed was not long, but
my sufferings were great while they lasted.
I never, since I was married, enjoyed life
till now. You know my match was origi∣nally
the result of duty to the best of mo∣thers;
and though, if I ever knew my own
heart, it was absolutely freed from all attach∣ment
to any other person, yet was it not so
devoted to Mr. Arnold, as to have made
him my choice preferably to all other men,
if I had not resolved in <HI>this,</HI> as in every
other action of my life, to be determined by
those to whom I owed obedience. When I
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
married Mr. Arnold, I esteemed him; a
sufficient foundation, in the person of a hus∣band,
whereon to build love. That love,
his kindness, and my own gratitude, in a little
time produced in my heart; and I will ven∣ture
to say few wives loved so well, none bet∣ter.
You know I could never bear to con∣sider
love as a childish divinity, who exer∣cises
his power by throwing the heart into
tumultuous raptures: <HI>my</HI> love, tho' of a more
temperate kind, was sufficiently servent to
make Mr. Arnold's coldness towards me
alone capable of wounding my heart most
sensibly; but when this coldness was aggra∣vated
by the cruel distrust which he was
taught to entertain of me, the blow indeed
became scarce supportable; and I did not
till then know the progress he had made in
my affections.</P>
<P>Sorrows, my Cecilia, soften and subdue
the mind prodigiously; and I think my heart
was better prepared from its sufferings to re∣ceive
Mr. Arnold's returning tenderness, than
an age of courtship in the gay and prospe∣rous
days of life could have framed it to.
I exult in his restored affections, and love
him a thousand times better than ever I did.
He deserves it; I am sure he does: he was
led away from me by enchantment; nothing
else could have done it. But the charm is
broke, thank heaven! and I find him now
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
the tenderest, the best of men. Every look,
every word, every action of his life, is ex∣pressive
of a love next to adoration. Oh!
I should be too happy if the blessings I now
possess were to be my continued portion in
this life! There is, however, but <HI>one</HI> about
which I can rationally indulge any fears—
My mother—Her years, and her growing
infirmities, will not suffer me to hope for her
being long absent from her final place of feli∣city.
You always used to say I anticipated mis∣fortunes:
this event <HI>may</HI> be farther off than
my anxious fears sometimes suggest to me;
so no more of it.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 10.—My good Lady V—writes
me word, that all our business is finished,
The whole amount of our effects came but
to three thousand four hundred pounds; our
debts (including some charges which have
occurred in the transacting of our affairs) ex∣ceeded
eight thousand. Our worthy Lord
V—has paid the whole, and has made him∣self
our only creditor. We have nothing
now, that we can call our own, but my join∣ture.
I do not reckon upon my mother's
bounty to us; our income from her, and
the house we live in, will be Sir George's,
whenever it is our misfortune to lose her.
But she tells me she is well, and talks of
coming down in about a fortnight.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68"/>
<HI>March</HI> 11.—I am here in a scene of still
life, my dear; and you must now expect to
hear of nothing but such trivial matters as
used to be the subjects of our journals when
we were both girls, and you lived within a
bow shot of Sidney-Castle, and saw me eve∣ry
day. The last three months of my life
have glided away like a smooth stream, when
there is not a breath of wind to ruffle it; and
after you have read the transactions of one
day, you know how I pass all the rest.</P>
<P>I have told you of every-body that came
to see me, and all the visits that I returned:
I have given you an account of all our old
acquaintance, and of some new ones. You
know what my amusements are, and what
my business. Indeed, what I call busi∣ness,
is my chief pleasure. You, who
are surrounded by the gaieties of a splen∣did
court, had need of the partiality which
I know you have for your Sidney, to desire
a continuation of her insipid narrative. But,
I suppose, if I were to tell you, that, on such
a day, my white Guiney-hen brought out a
fine brood of chickens, you might be as well
pleased with it, as I should be to hear from
you of the birth of an arch-dutchess. In∣deed,
my Cecilia, there is such a sameness in
my now-tranquil days, that I believe I must
have recourse to telling you my dreams, to
furnish out matter of variety.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69"/>
<HI>March</HI> 19.—We have had a wedding to∣day
in our neighbourhood. Young Main
(Patty's brother) has got a very pretty young
gentlewoman, with a fortune of five thou∣sand
pounds. It seems, this pair had been
fond of each other from their Childhood;
but the girl's fortune put her above her lo∣ver's
hopes: however, as he has, for a good
while, been in very great business, and has the
reputation of being better skilled in his pro∣fession
than any one in the country, he was
in hopes, that his character, his mistress's af∣fection
for him, and his own constancy,
would have some little weight with her fa∣mily.
Accordingly he ventured to make his
application to the young woman's brother,
at whose disposal she was, her father having
been dead for some years; but he was re∣jected
with scorn, and forbid the house.</P>
<P>The girl's father, it seems, had been an
humourist, and left her the fortune under a
severe restriction; for, if ever she married
without her brother's consent, she was to lose
it; so that, in that particular instance of dis∣posing
of her person, she was never to be
her own mistress. In the disposal of her for∣tune,
however, he did not so tie her up; for
after the age of one-and-twenty, she had the
power of bequeathing her fortune by will to
whom she pleased.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70"/>
The brother, who is a very honest man,
had no motive, but a regard to his sister's in∣terest,
in refusing poor Mr. Main: a man
of a good fortune had proposed for her,
whom the brother importuned her to accept
of; but she was firm to her first attachment.</P>
<P>The young lover found means to convey
a letter to his mistress, in which he told her,
that as he was in circumstances to support
her genteelly, if she would venture to ac∣cept
of his hand, he would never more bestow
a thought on her fortune. This proposal the
prudent young woman declined on her own
part, but advised him to make it to her bro∣ther,
as she was not then without suspicions
that he wished to retain her fortune in the fa∣mily;
and that it was only to save appearan∣ces
he had proposed a match to her, of which
he was sure she would not accept. But in this
opinion she injured him. She thought, how∣ever,
the experiment might be of use, in
giving the better colour to her marrying
afterwards the man whom she loved.</P>
<P>But it was an ill-judged attempt, and
succeeded accordingly: for, if the brother
should have given his consent, he could
have no pretence for with-holding her por∣tion;
or, if he did so by mutual agreement,
his motive for denying his consent be∣fore,
must appear too obviously to be a
bad one.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71"/>
The young people, not considering this
sufficiently, resolved to make the trial; ac∣cordingly
Mr. Main wrote to the brother
a very submissive letter, telling him he
would, in the most solemn manner, relin∣quish
all claim to his sister's fortune, if,
he would make him happy by consenting
to their marriage; without which he said,
the young lady's regard for her brother,
would not suffer her to take such a step.</P>
<P>This letter had no other effect than that
of making the brother extremely angry.
He sent a severe message to the young man,
to acquaint him, that he looked upon
his proposal as a most injurious affront
to his character; but that he was ready
to convince him, and every-body else, that
he had no designs upon his sister's for∣tune,
as he would not refuse his consent to
her marriage with any other man in the
country but himself. This was a thun∣der-clap
to the poor lover: he comforted
himself, however, with the hopes that his
mistress's heart would determine her in his
favour, notwithstanding the severity of the
brother.</P>
<P>There had been, it seems, besides this
gentleman's not thinking Main a suitable
match for his sister, some old family pique
between him and Mr. Main's father.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72"/>
These transactions happened some time
before I came to the country. Just about
that juncture, the poor girl had the mis∣fortune
to receive a hurt in her breast, by
falling against the sharp corner of a desk
from a stool, on which she had stood in
order to reach down a book that was in a
little case over it. This accident threw her
into a fit of illness, which put a stop to
all correspondence between her and her
lover.</P>
<P>In this illness, a fever, which was her
apparent complaint, was the only thing
to which the physician paid attention, and
the hurt in her breast was not enquired
after; so that by the time she was tolerably
recovered from the former, the latter was
discovered to be in a very dangerous way,
and required the immediate assistance of a
surgeon. You may be sure poor Main was
not the person pitched upon to attend her;
another was called in, of less skill, but not
so obnoxious to the family.</P>
<P>By this bungler she was tortured for near
three months; at the end of which time,
through improper treatment, the malady was
so far increased, that the operator declared
the breast must be taken off, as the only
possible means of saving her life.</P>
<P>The young gentlewoman's family were all
in the greatest affliction; she herself seemed
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
the only composed person amongst them:
She appointed the day when she was to un∣dergo
this severe trial of her fortitude; it
was at the distance of about a week. The
surgeon objected to the having it put off so
long, but she was peremptory, and at last
prevailed.</P>
<P>On the evening preceding the appointed
day, the conjured her brother in the most
earnest manner, to permit Mr. Main to be
present at the operation. The brother was
unwilling to comply, as he thought it might
very much discompose her, but she was so
extremely pressing, that he was constrained
to yield.</P>
<P>The attending surgeon was consulted on
the occasion; who having declared, that he
had no objection to Mr. Main's being pre∣sent,
that young man was sent to. He had
been quite inconsolable at the accounts he
received, of the dangerous state in which
his mistress was, and went with an aching
heart to her brother's house in the morning.</P>
<P>He was introduced into her chamber,
where he found the whole chirurgical appa∣ratus
ready. The young woman herself was
in her closet, but came out in a few minutes,
with a countenance perfectly serene. She
seated herself in an elbow chair, and desired
she might be indulged for a quarter of an
hour, to speak a few words, to her brother,
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
before they proceeded to their work. Her
brother was immediately called to her, when
taking him by the hand, she requested him
to sit down by her.</P>
<P>You have, said she, been a father to me,
since I lost my own; I acknowledge your
tenderness and your care of me with grati∣tude.
I believe your refusal of me to Mr.
Main, was from no other motive, but your
desire of seeing me matched to a richer
man. I therefore freely forgive you that on∣ly
act, in which you ever exercised the au∣thority
my father gave you over me. My
life, I now apprehend, is in imminent dan∣ger,
the hazard nearly equal, whether I do,
or do not undergo the operation; but as
they tell me there is a chance in my favour
on one side, I am determined to submit to
it.</P>
<P>I put it off to this day, on account of its
being my birth-day. I am now one and
twenty, and as the consequences of what I
have to go through, may deprive me of the
power of doing what I intended, I have spent
this morning in making my will. You,
brother, have an ample fortune; I have no
poor relations; I ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, therefore, I shall
stand justified to the world, for having
made Mr. Main my heir. Saying this, she
pulled a paper from under her gown, which
she put into her brother's hand, that he
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
might read it. It was her will, wrote by
herself, regularly signed, and witnessed by
two servants of the family.</P>
<P>Sir, said she, turning to the other surgeon,
as soon as my brother is withdrawn, I am
ready for you. You may imagine this had
various effects on the different persons con∣cerned.
The brother, however displeased he
might have been at this act of his sister's,
had too much humanity to make any ani∣madversions
on it at that time. He returned
the paper to his sister without speaking, and
retired.</P>
<P>Poor Main, who had stood at the back of
her chair, from his first coming in, had been
endeavouring to supprese his tears all the
time; but at this proof of his mistress's
tenderness and generosity, it was no long∣er
in his power to do so, and they burst
from him with the utmost violence of passion.</P>
<P>The other surgeon desired him to com∣pose
himself, for that they were losing time,
and the lady would be too much ruffled.</P>
<P>The heroic young woman, with a smiling
countenance, begged of him to dry his eyes:
perhaps, said she, I may recover. Then
fixing herself firmly in the chair, she pro∣nounced
with much composure, “I am rea∣dy.”
Two maid servants stood one at each
side of her, and the surgeon drew near to do
his painful work. He had uncovered her
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
bosom, and taken off the dressings, when Mr.
Main, casting his eyes at her breast, begged
he might have leave to examine it before
they proceeded. The other surgeon, with
some indignation, said, his doing so was only
an unnecessary delay; and had, already laid
hold of his knife, when Mr. Main having
looked at it, said, he was of opinion it might
be saved, without endangering the lady's
life. The other, with a contemptuous
smile, told him, he was sorry he thought
him so ignorant of his profession, and with∣out
much ceremony, putting him aside, was
about to proceed to the operation; when
Mr. Main laying hold of him, said, that
he never should do it in his presence; adding,
with some warmth, that he would engage
to make a perfect cure of it in a month,
without the pain or hazard of amputati∣on.</P>
<P>The young lady, who had been an eye∣witness
of what passed, for she would not
suffer her face to be covered, now thought
it proper to interpose. She told the un∣feeling
operator, that he might be very
sure she would embrace any distant hope
of saving herself from the pain, the dan∣ger,
and the loss she must sustain, if he
pursued the method he intended. She
was not, however, so irresolute, she said,
as to desire either to avoid or postpone
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
the operation, if it should be found necessary;
but as there was hope given her of a cure
without it, she thought it but reasonable to
make the experiment; and should therefore
refer the decision of her case to a third per∣son
of skill in the profession, by whose opini∣on
she would be determined.</P>
<P>The two women servants, who are always
professed enemies to chirurgical operations,
readily joined in her sentiments, and saying
it was a mortal sin to cut and hack any chris∣tian,
they made haste to cover up their young
lady again.</P>
<P>The disappointed surgeon hardly forbore
rude language to the women; and telling
Mr. Main he would make him know what it
was to traduce the skill of a practitioner of
his standing, marched off in a violent pas∣sion,
saying to his patient, if she had a mind
to kill herself, it was nothing to him.</P>
<P>The modest young man, delighted to find
the case of his beloved not so desperate as he
had supposed it to be, begged she would per∣mit
him to apply some proper dressings to the
afflicted part, and conjuring her to call in the
aid of the ablest surgeon that could be procu∣red,
took his leave.</P>
<P>The brother of the lady being apprized of
what had passed, lost no time in sending an
express to Bath; and by a very handsome
gratuity, induced a surgeon of great emi∣nence
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
to set out immediately for his house,
who arrived early the next morning. But in
the mean time poor Main had like to have
paid dear for his superior skill in his profes∣sion.
The other surgeon had no sooner got
home, than he sent him a challenge, to meet
him that evening, in a field at some distance
from the town. They met; Main had the
good fortune, after wounding, to disarm, his
antagonist, but first received himself a dan∣gerous
wound.</P>
<P>This accident was kept from the knowledge
of his mistress; but on the arrival of the sur∣geon
from Bath, as he would not take off the
dressings, but in the presence of the person
who put them on, it was thought proper that
both Mr. Main and the other man should be
sent for. The latter was not by any means
in a condition to attend; but the former,
though very ill and feverish, desired that he
might be carried to the house. The Bath sur∣geon
having, in his and the brother's pre∣sence,
examined the case, declared it as his
opinion, that the complaint might be remo∣ved
without amputation; adding, that it was
owing to wrong management that the grie∣vance
had gone so far. He consulted with
Main, in the presence of the family, as to
his intended method of treating it for the fu∣ture;
he agreed with him intirely, with re∣gard
to the propriety of it; and having assu∣red
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
the friends of the girl, that he thought him
a skilful and ingenious young man, took his
leave, being obliged to return directly home.</P>
<P>The testimony of this gentleman, whose
skill was undoubted, and whose impartiality
must be so too, having never seen any of the
parties concerned in his life before, wrought
so much on the brother of the lady, that he
did not hesitate to put his sister under the
care of her lover.</P>
<P>Poor Main, though scarce able to leave
his bed for some time, was nevertheless car∣ried
to his patient every day, at the hazard
of his life. His skill, his tenderness, and his
assiduity, were all exerted in a particular
manner on the present occasion; and in less
than, five weeks he had the pleasure to see his
mistress restored to perfect health.</P>
<P>The consequence of this incident was ve∣ry
happy for them both; the brother, ex∣ceedingly
pleased at his whole behaviour,
told him, he was an honest generous fellow;
and since he was convinced it was his sister's
person, and not her fortune he was attached
to, he would, with all his heart, bestow
both on him; and accordingly Mr. Arnold
and I had this day the satisfaction of see∣ing
this worthy young pair united in mar∣riage.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80"/>
My Patty is not a little delighted at her
brother's good fortune. The honest youth,
who has ever since his father's death support∣ed
his mother, and as many of the younger
children as were not able to gain their own
livelihood, has now invited his sister Patty to
live with him; but the faithful girl declined
the offer; telling her brother, she would ne∣ver
quit me, while I thought her worthy of
my regard.</P>
<P>I lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k upon myself to be much obliged to
her for this, as the station she is now in, can∣not
be so advantageous as I hoped to make it,
when I first took her into my service; but I
will make up in kindness what may be want∣ing
in profit. Indeed I consider her rather
as a friend than a servant, and Mr. Arnold
always treats her with respect.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 20.—I am very uneasy at not
having it in my power to fulfil my promise to
poor miss Burchell; but that is a string I
dare not as yet touch upon. Indeed I can∣not
bear any conversation that leads to the
subject. Whenever Mr. Arnold begins to
accuse himself for his unhappy conduct, in re∣lation
to Mrs. Gerrarde, which he often does,
I always stop him, or turn the discourse to
something else. He never speaks of her now,
but with a contemptuous indifference; and
is so firmly persuaded that she went off wil∣lingly
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
with Mr. Faulkland, that I dare not as
yet undeceive him; which I must necessarily
do, should I express even a wish that Mr.
Faulkland should repair the niece's wrongs by
marriage. Mr. Arnold knows nothing of
miss Burchell's affair. I went once so far as
to say I had heard Mr. Faulkland formerly
liked this young lady. Mr. Arnold answer∣ed,
I am glad it went no farther than liking;
if it had, probably I should not have been
so soon delivered from my thraldom to her
aunt. This reply silenced me; I am exceed∣ingly
perplexed about it. Would to Heaven
Mr. Faulkland would of himself think of do∣ing
the amiable unhappy girl justice!</P>
<P>My mother writes me word, that Sir
George had informed Mr. Faulkland, by
letter, of the success of his project, and
that his answer was full of congratulations,
and expressions of joy. He is now in Ita∣ly;
but talks of returning to England next
summer. He says, he hears sometimes from
Pivet, and that he and his wife live very well
together.</P>
<P>My mother says she often sees miss Bur∣chell,
and that she encourages her with the
hope of what may happen when Mr. Faul∣land
comes back. If this match should ever
take place, it would give me most sincere
satisfaction. The girl's family is not con∣temptible;
her fortune is pretty large, her
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
person lovely; the unfortunate false step she
made, is an entire secret, except to the per∣sons
immediately concerned; so that with
regard to the world, her character too is
good. Mrs. Gerrarde, at worst, was only
her aunt by marriage; but if that circum∣stance
should be the only rub in her way to
happiness, I would sooner declare the whole
affair, and run the risk of Mr. Arnold's
being let into this ticklish secret, than be a
hindrance to the poor young creature's wel∣fare.
This affair never comes a-cross me,
but it makes me sigh. God send, a favour∣able
issue to it!</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 26.—Alas! my Cecilia, we have
received most heavy news! My good, lord
V—, that stedfast, that worthy, that
best of friends, is no more! He was prepar∣ing
to go to V—hall, three days ago, but
was seized with an apoplexy, as he was com∣ing
down stairs to go into his coach, and di∣ed
before any assistance could reach him.
Oh! we have a severe loss in the death of
this most dear and valuable man—but
why do I mention <HI>our</HI> loss?—his lady—
poor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> V—is almost distracted—
and well she may—the best of husbands,
fathers, every thing! His eldest son, who
is abroad, is sent for home on this melancho∣ly
occasion—My poor mother is afflicted
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
exceedingly: every body that knew him
must be so. Mr. Arnold and I have lost
more than a father. How <HI>self</HI> recurs every
minute; let me think of lady V—again,
and not dare to complain on my own account;
but my obligations to him were of such a
nature, as claim all my gratitude to his me∣mory,
and all the tears that I have abundant∣ly
shed for him.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold is largely in his debt, we have
no room to expect the same friendship from
the present lord V—, that we experienced
from his father.</P>
<P>This circumstance did not occur to me till
poor Mr. Arnold put me in the mind of it:
my thoughts were too much absorbed in
grief, which the death alone of our friend
occasioned. My mother hinted at it too,
in her letter to Mr. Arnold; for it was
to him she wrote the mournful tidings.</P>
<P>What a dark cloud of sorrow is now
spread over Sidney-castle! and how this
stroke has imbittered our little domestick
joys! But let me not carry my complainings
into presumptuous murmurings. I have
lost a sincere and truly valued friend; but
do I not still possess infinite blessings?
My husband, my dear Mr. Arnold, my two
sweet children, the best of mothers, and thee,
my ever-beloved Cecilia, whom I still
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
call mine, though at such a distance from
me.</P>
<P>Then I comfort myself with reflecting
that lady V—has sons, who, I hope, will
be a blessing to her; that h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r fortune is af∣fluent,
and that my lord had passed through
a well-spent life, to a pretty advanced
age. He was turned of sixty. All these
considerations sooth my mind, and I acknow∣ledge,
that, upon the whole, I have, by
far more cause to be thankful, than to re∣pine.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 30.—Lady V—'s journey
down to V—hall having been so fatally
prevented, she is obliged to remain in Lon∣don.
The shock she received has brought
on her a fit of illness. I find my lord has
not left any ready money; his fortune was
large, but as they always lived in great
splendor, he laid none of his income by:
the whole sum which he could com∣mand,
he laid out for our use. My la∣dy's
jointure is pretty considerable; if it
were ten times more, she deserves it. Oh,
may her sons prove worthy of such a pa∣rent!
The youngest I hear is a very fine
youth. He is come to her from Oxford to
comfort her, till the arrival of his elder bro∣ther.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="85"/>
My mother writes me word, that her
old friend lady Grimston is dead! She has
left her whole fortune to charitable uses:
not a sixpence to either of her daughters.
Poor Mrs. Vere! She is content with her
little income, and has no loss of so unnatural
a parent, who carried her vindictive spirit
with her to the grave. As for the eldest,
she did not stand in need of any assistance
from her; but I own, though I had no great
esteem for lady Grimston, I could not help
being shocked at the brutal behaviour of her
son-in-law to her in her last hours. She had ne∣ver
seen either him or her daughter, from the
time I told you they had quarrelled; but
when she found herself dying, she sent a
message to this favourite daughter, desir∣ing
to see her; her husband, whether
out of disregard to the old lady, or his
wife, or both, absolutely refused to let her
go. My Mother remarks on this passage
in these words, “Thus was this unfortu∣nate
parent punished in kind, for deny∣ing
her late husband the satisfaction of
seeing his youngest daughter, when, he
was in the same circumstances with her∣self.”</P>
<P>My mother is nevertheless very much
troubled for the death of her old acquain∣tance;
who, she says, was a valuable wo∣man:
she considers her decease as a me∣mento,
which warns her of her own ap∣proaching
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
end; for they were just of an
age.</P>
<P>I fear my mother is not well, though
she does not say so; for she has put off her
coming down to Sidney-castle, without giv∣ing
me a reason for it.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 22.—I thank you, my beloved
Cecilia, for your cordial wish. Your opini∣on,
that all my troubles are at an end, is
consonant to your desires, but I doubt far
from the real fact. The young lord V—
is returned home; but oh! how unlike that
honest man, whose title and fortune he inhe∣rits!
How deceived were his worthy parents
in their hopes of him! he is a stranger to
every sentiment of virtue. I have had a
letter this day from my lady V—, wherein
she laments the degeneracy of her son,
whom they were made to believe a pattern of
excellence: but the tutor to whom they en∣trusted
him was as profligate as himself. In
short, she says he is quite a reprobate; she
has not the least authority or influence over
him; she laments this, particularly on our
account; we are indebted to him near five
thousand pounds, and my lady says, she fears
he will press Mr. Arnold. He is profuse, she
says, in his expences, without being gene∣rous.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87"/>
What can we do, my dear? There is not
the least prospect now of our being able to
pay this money, but by our selling the only
remaining stake we have left. Had my lord
lived, he made us hope that by his Interest
he could procure Mr. Arnold some employ∣ment,
which would have enabled him to
discharge this debt at his ease, without our
being obliged to strip ourselves of our all.
As we purposed living with the utmost oeco∣nomy,
this might have been accomplished in
a few years. This prospect is now lost to us.
We must submit. I have begged of Mr.
Arnold to think immediately of selling my
jointure, for we have no reason to expect
any lenity from a man of such a character as
the present lord V—is. We can subsist
upon the income, which my mother is so
good as to allow us: it is precarious it is true,
but something may happen; I rely on that
providence, who has hitherto protected me.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 28.—Lady V—'s apprehensions
were but too well founded. We have had
a letter from her son's agent. The debt
<HI>must</HI> be paid; and we are come to a resolu∣tion
to sell two hundred and fifty pounds a
year. We shall then have but fifty pounds
a year in the world which we can call our
own! I reckon not upon my Mother's life;
these afflictions, I fear, will hasten her depar∣ture
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
to another world. From Sir George we
have nothing to expect: he is absorbed in
vanity; his new alliances engross him in∣tirely.</P>
<P>My dear lady V—writes us word, she will
do her utmost to promote Mr. Arnold's in∣terest.
She has numerous and powerful
friends; and says, she makes ho doubt of
obtaining something for him worth his ac∣ceptance.
Believe me, my Cecilia, I am not
disheartened at this fresh blow. If my dear
Mr. Arnold could reconcile himself to it,
I could be well contented. I will not now
(though you used to accuse me of it) antici∣pate
misfortunes; we have still enough for
the present to live on decently; and if my
lady V—'s kind endeavours should succeed,
we may yet be happily provided for. I will
not let the thought of my mother's death in∣terfere:
let me but calm the anxious fears
of my poor Mr. Arnold, and all will be
well.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 12—Thank God we have done
with the merciless lord V—! his money is to
be paid directly to him. I have recovered
my tranquillity; I enjoy my little in peace;
and have the comfort to see Mr. Arnold's
mind more at ease, and reconciled to his lot.
To lady V—'s goodness, as well as my own
earnest endeavours, I impute this. She says,
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
she has the promise of an honourable and a
profitable post for him; but we are to wait
some months for it. The person who is now
in possession of this place is to be preferred to
a better, and she says, she has the word of an
<HI>honest</HI> man on the occasion; “he is a very
<HI>great</HI> man too, says my lady in her letter,
but as it is on the first part of his character
chiefly we are to depend, I mention the
other only by the by.”</P>
<P>Now, my dear, have I not reason to be
contented? A thankless heart should I have
if I were not; but I am, indeed, my Cecilia,
I am; and I begin again to be happy. Our
domestick felicity was but disturbed for a
while, it was not over-thrown.</P>
<P>Here will I close; I have an opportunity
of sending this immediately by a private hand
to my beloved.</P>
<Q>[Here Mrs. Arnold's maid Patty continues
the journal].</Q>
<P><HI>May</HI> 15.—By my lady's orders I take
up the pen; and she has charged me to set
down every particular. God knows I am
ill able to do it! but I will strive to obey her,
My poor dear lady is in such trouble, she has
not the heart to write, nor scarcely to do
any thing</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90"/>
My master—Oh! madam, how shall I ex∣press
my self! my poor master, now he is so
good, we are going, I fear, to lose him:
I must write, according to my lady's custom,
every thing in the best order I can.</P>
<P>You cannot think, madam, how happy
they have lived together ever since my lady
came home to him again. He seemed to
grow fonder and fonder of her every day; I
believe he perfectly adored her, and he had
reason.</P>
<P>You know, madam, my lady was always
used to a chariot; but they never attempted
keeping one since they came down to Sid∣ney-castle.
She asked my master once, if
he had a horse quiet enough for her to ven∣ture
to ride on to church? I observed my
master turned away his face, and put his
handkerchief to his eyes. I believe he thought
of a little favourite pad that he had given to
Mrs. Gerrarde. I have not one, my love,
said he, that I would trust you on. You
had once a pretty horse that you were fond
of, but my desperate folly has not even left
you that; but I will look out for one that
will suit you. No matter, my dear, said my
lady smiling, and taking him by the hand, I
will ride double, I think that will suit me
best. Dearest of women! said my master (and
he fetched a deep sigh), when shall I be able
to make you amends? He lamented hour∣ly
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
the lose of his fortune for her sake. What
will become of you, my dearest creature, and
my two poor children, said he (when he was
obliged to part with her jointure), if I should
die before you; and then he cried, and wrung
his hands My lady begged of him to put
such melancholy thoughts out of his head,
saying, they never disturbed her. I hope,
said she, I shall never see your death; but
if it pleases God to punish me so far, a little,
a very little, will content me for the rest of
my days. My master embraced her, and the
children; and said, if heaven spared him
life, he would yet be the happiest man in the
world. Many a time have I been witness to
such discourse between them; for they knew
my love for them was so great, that they
would never scruple talking of their affairs
before me. Oh! madam, I believe there
was never a truer penitent than my master,
My dear lady has said to me, since they were
forced to sell her jointure, Patty, though we
are now reduced to little more than two hun∣dred
pounds a year, I have much more com∣fort
than when we had twelve. I have the
satisfaction of seeing Mr. Arnold such as I
wish him; he is an a tered man, Patty; he
is truly virtuous, and I am sure he loves me
now from right reason. I am content with
the little that is left us.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92"/>
I always prayed for her prosperity; but
madam, God is pleased to order things other∣wise
than we poor silly mortals think the best.
My lady has always been good, and pious,
and I hope, he will yet bring her out of her
troubles, tho' they are great and many.</P>
<P>My lady always charged me to be minute,
and to write particulars; but, good madam,
excuse the silly way I put my words together▪
I have not yet come to the dismal part of my
story, and I hardly know how to go on, for
indeed I am forced to break off every now
and then to cry. Reason enough I have, to
be sure; but what is <HI>my</HI> sorrow compared to
my lady's!</P>
<P>The day before yesterday my master was
asked by some gentlemen in our neighbour∣hood
to go a hunting; he had no mind to
go, for my lady was not very well, and he was
unwilling to leave her; but she persuaded
him, because she knew he loved hunting
dearly; she has blamed herself for it ever
since, but she could not know by enchant∣ment
what was to happen. He left my lady
in bed, and went out about five o'clock in the
morning. At eight, as my lady was sitting
at breakfast, and I attending, the other maid
called me out. Our man, who had gone
abroad with my master, was in the kitchen,
and looked as pale as death. I asked him
what was the matter? The poor fellow could
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
hardly speak; but at last said, my master
has got a desperate fall in leaping a ditch, and
I am afraid has hurt his skull: he is lying
at farmer Hill's cottage, and one of the
gentlemen is rid off for a surgeon; but that
is no place for him, we must get him home:
but I thought it best to prepare my lady
before she sees him. My lady rung her
bell before I could answer him; I ran in,
but I am sure I looked like a ghost, for my
lady started when she saw me. Bless me!
Patty, said she, what is the matter? Has
any thing happened to your master? Not
much, Madam, said I. He is killed, she cri∣ed,
and sprung out of her chair. Indeed
he is not, Madam, I answered, standing be∣tween
her and the door; but he has got a
fall, and is a little hurt. She made me no
answer, but slew down stairs, out at the front
door, and down the avenue as quick as an
arrow. I ran after her, and the other ser∣vants
after me; we could not overtake her;
but she was soon stopped, for she met my
poor master borne by four men. I sup∣pose
she thought he was dead, for she faint∣ed
away directly, and we carried her in after
him.</P>
<P>My Master was put to bed; he was
alive, but not able to speak. He had got a
dreadful cut in his head, and was sadly brui∣sed
besides.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94"/>
As soon as my lady came to herself, we
told her my master was not killed. She
went into his room, but had not power to
speak, but sat like a stone statue at his bed∣side.
The surgeon came in less than half
an hour. I believe he is but a sorry one;
for after he had dressed the wound, he said
there was no danger in it. At first we were
all in hopes that it was so; for about two o'
clock my master got his speech again; he
complained of sickness at his stomach, and
violent pains all over him.</P>
<P>My lady, on hearing him speak, seemed
to be rouzed as if out of a deep sleep. Se∣veral
of the gentlemen, who had been out
with my master, had come to enquire how
he did; and though some of them came
into his chamber, my mistress did not speak,
nor seem to regard any of them. The first
word she uttered was to call me; Patty,
said she, what is the reason I do not see
Mr. Main here? It was my brother, she
meant, who is a surgeon; and I believe,
madam, she has mentioned him to you, as
one that is reckoned pretty skilful in his bu∣siness.
One of the gentlemen immediately
said, by all means let him be sent for direct∣ly.
My brother was soon fetched, and he
thought proper to bleed my master in the
arm. He would not take the dressings off
his head, as the other surgeon had declared
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
the skull was not touched; but said, he would
be present when the wound was dressed the
next day; and would watch all night by my
master.</P>
<P>My lady was not to be removed from the
bed-side, nor could we persuade her to take
any sustenance the whole day. My poor
master was in a high fever all night; and
I thought he strove to stifle his groans, that
my lady might not hear them. She did for
all that; and I am sure every one of them
was worse than a dagger to her heart. She
stole out of the room several times for a mi∣nute,
and I could hear her bursting into tears,
as soon as she was without side the door;
then she would come in again, and sit by him,
till her heart was again so full, she was for∣ced
to go out to give it vent. The whole
night passed over in this dismal way.</P>
<P>When my master's head was examined the
next day, my brother found that the skull
was not touched where he had received the
cut, but that it was broken in two other
places, and in so dangerous a way, that it
was impossible to save his life, as it was not
in a part where he could be trapanned. The
other surgeon, who found he had been mis∣taken
at first, now joined with my brother in
opinion that the world could not save my ma∣ster's
life. Oh! madam, if you had seen
my lady when this was declared to her! I
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
shall never forget her looks. I remember a
a piece of fine painting at your house, which
I used to hear your family commend mighti∣ly.
It was the picture of despair. My lady
put me in mind of this piece; she had the
very countenance of it; but I think, if she
had then sat to a painter, he could have made
a stronger and more heart-breaking look even
than that picture has.</P>
<P>Such another dismal day and night I be∣lieve
never was passed in this house. My
brother staid with us, though he could do
but little service, except to watch my
poor master, for he was between whiles
quite out of his reason—</P>
<P>No rest did my lady take all last night. She
could not be got out of the room; she has
tasted nothing these two days, nor slept a
wink these two nights—She will destroy her∣self
—What will become of us?—I have wrote
to my lady Bidulph, to let her know the de∣plorable
condition we are all in—My God!
what will become of the poor children, if my
lady goes on at this rate! She cannot hold out
to be sure, such a load of sorrow at her heart,
without nourishment or sleep—. Oh! my
good madam, I am not able to go on with
my, task—We have not the least hopes in the
world—My master grows worse and worse
every hour: he has his reason now, and is sen∣sible
that he is dying. Heaven knows, if I
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
could lay down my life to save his, how glad∣ly
I would do it! I should be no loss, but he
will be a grievous one—</P>
<P>Lord help me! I am not able to go on—I
have writ this by bits and scraps—</P>
<Q>[Mr. Main in continuation.]</Q>
<P><DATE>May 16,</DATE> Three o'clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold had been delirious the greatest
part of yesterday; but about six o'clock in
the evening, having come a little to his senses,
he was conscious that he was going fast, and
desired that prayers might be read by him.
His lady sent for the minister of the parish,
but he was gone to London: the gentleman
whom he had left to do his duty, was taken
ill the night before, and was not able to leave
his bed. He sent the messenger that went for
him, to another clergyman, who lived about
four miles farther off, to request he would at∣tend
in his stead; but he was engaged on the
same duty in his own parish, and could not
come, he said, till next morning. The servant
had wasted above two hours on this errand; it
was nine o'clock when he returned. Mr.
Arnold during this interval had had several
ramblings; but was now again a little compo∣sed,
though apparently worse. I whispered
the apothecary, who just then came in, that
he could not live 'till morning. Mrs. Arnold
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
observed me, and begged to know what I said.
I told her tenderly, that I feared Mr. Atkins
(that was the clergyman's name) would arrive
too late, if he deferred his visit till next
day.</P>
<P>She made me no answer, but seemed to
study a little; then went composedly to Mr.
Arnold's bed-side. My dear, said she, Mr.
Downs is unluckily from home; his assistant
is sick in bed; and we cannot to night get
any other clergyman to visit you: but as you
are desirous of offering up your prayers to Al∣mighty
God, I hope it will not be improper
if I read the service for the sick by you. He
streched out his hand towards her, and said
in a faint, yet eager voice, Do, do, my good
angel! Tears stood in the lady's eyes as she
turned from him; but she quickly wiped them
off, and requested of me and the apothecary
to join with her in the solemn office she was
going to perform, which she said, though she
was sensible it was an irregular act, yet she
hoped, from the necessity of the case, would
be accepted in the sight of God.</P>
<P>She ordered my sister to fetch her a prayer∣book;
and then kneeled down at Mr. Ar∣nold's
bed-side.</P>
<P>Surely nothing ever appeared so graceful;
her fine hands and her fine eyes lifted up to
heaven, while the book lay open before h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r
on a little table. Such a reverential, such an
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
ardent, yet such a mournful supplication
in those fine eyes! she looked like something
more than human! After having in this pos∣ture
offered up a short petition in silence, she
began the service.</P>
<P>Never did I see true devotion before; the
servor of her looks, and the tone of her voice
was such, you would have thought she be∣held
her Creator with her bodily eyes. For
my part, I looked on her with such reve∣rence,
that she appeared to me like an angel,
interceding for us poor mortal sinners.</P>
<P>She went through the office with admira∣ble
strength of mind (omitting the exhortati∣on)
'till she came to that part of the prayer,
which says, “yet for as much, as in all ap∣pearance
the time of his dissolution draweth
nigh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>” Here her voice faultered, and
she stopped; but soon recovered herself, and
proceeded with an unbroken tone to the end.
Every one present wept but herself, she
thanked us for our kindness in staying, and
begged we would continue by poor Mr. Ar∣nold,
while there was the least possibility of
administering any relief to him.</P>
<P>I told her I would most willingly obey her
commands, and sit up all the night with him,
though it was not in human power to give
him any assistance.</P>
<P>She repeated her thanks, and then sitting
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
down by the bed-side, remained composed
and silent.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock, finding Mr. Arnold
speechless, I entreated her to retire to her
own chamber, and if she could not sleep, to
take some little refreshment; for she had ta∣ken
nothing that whole day, nor for the two
preceding ones, but a dish of tea which my
sister had forced on her.</P>
<P>Mr. Main, said she, suffer me to continue
a little longer; my task will soon be over. I
was unwilling to urge her; and she remained
sitting in her place.</P>
<P>About two o'clock we heard Mr. Arnold
give a deep groan: He is gone, said she, and
started off her chair. I stepped to his bed-side,
and found indeed he had breathed his
last. She snatched up one of his hands
that lay upon the coverlid of the bed, held
it for near a minute to her lips, and then,
without any audible token of grief, went out
of the room.</P>
<P>I pray God to support and comfort this ex∣cellent
woman.</P>
<Q>[Patty in continuation.]</Q>
<P>Amen! Amen!—Sure my dear unhappy
lady is enough to break one's heart to lee
her. I was not able to go on, good madam,
and begged of my brother to let down what
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
happened, and he has put it in better words
than I could. My lady shut herself up for
the remainder of the night, and would not
suffer any one to come near her; it is easy
to guess how she spent her time: rest, to be
sure, she took none; she could not, if she
had been inclined; for there was no bed in
the chamber where she locked herself up. In
the morning, a lady, who is our neighbour,
a worthy good woman, came in her own
coach, and took away my lady and the two
children. She neither consented nor refused;
but seemed to let us do what we would with
her; for she said nothing, but suffered the
lady and me to lead her down stairs, and put
her into the coach. But the sight of the two
children, threw her into such an agony, that
I thought I should have died on the spot only
with seeing her.</P>
<P>I have writ again to lady Bidulph: if she
is able, to be sure she will come down; but
I had rather she would send for my lady, for
this is a sorrowful place for her to stay in.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 20—My lady has received a letter
from her mother, desiring her to come to town
directly with the children. She says she is
not able to come down for her, as her health
is but bad; and my lady V—has been so
good as to send down her own coach to carry
the little family to town.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102"/>
My brother has taken the care of my mas∣ter's
funeral upon himself. He is to be carried
to the family burying place at Arnold Abbey.
As soon as that is over, we must try to get
my lady to town; she has no business to go
into her own lonely house again; it would be
enough to kill her.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 30.—Thank God we have got
back safe to London. My lady keeps up
wonderfully, under the load of grief that she
has at her heart. She does not complain nor
lament herself, as I have seen some do, who
have not been in half her trouble. She hard∣ly
spoke a word during her whole journey,
and strove as much as possible not to cry; but
I could observe that she never turned her eyes
on the two little babes, one of whom sat in
my lap, and the other beside me, but the
tears ran down her cheeks.</P>
<P>It was a doleful sight, the meeting between
her and my lady Bidulph. The poor old la∣dy
grieves sadly, and looks mighty ill: I
am afraid she will not hold out long; she
has had great trials, for a lady so far in years.
Sir George came to see my lady; he looked
troubled; I hope he will be good to her.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 1.—My lady asked me this
morning if I had thought of keeping any
journal for this fortnight past. I told her I
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
had, and she desired to see it. She shed so
many tears while she read it, that the paper
was quite wet when she gave it to me again.
She ordered me to make up the packet, and
send it off, as she was not in a condition to
add any thing to it herself.</P>
<Q>[Mrs. Arnold in continuation.]</Q>
<P><HI>June</HI> 20.—Yes, my dear Cecilia, I have
need of the tender condolements, with which
your last kind packet was filled. Well may
you call me a child of affliction; I am now
so exercised in sorrows, that I look forward
to nothing else.</P>
<P>Patty, I find, has been a faithful journal∣ist;
and has carried down her melancholy
narrative to this day: this day, on which,
for the first time, I have taken a pen in my
hand for more than two months; but my eyes
are much better, and I hope I shall not have
occasion for the assistance of her pen, unless
some new calamity should again disqualify me
from using my own.</P>
<P>Yet in the midft of my griess, ought I
not to return thanks to heaven, that I have
such an asylum to fly to, as the arms of one
of the best of mothers? Oh! my dear,
while I have her, I ought not to say, that I
have lost every thing. Sir George has been
more obliging since my fatal loss than he was
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
before; but still there wants that cordial
heart which he formerly had. As for his
lady, I know very little of her. She came
to see me twice since my arrival in town, in
all the formal parade of a state visit. How
ill does the vanity of pomp suit with a house
of mourning! Her visits were short, formal,
and cold. She seems to be intolerably proud,
and I thought looked as if she was disgusted
at visiting; people in lodgings, who were so
nearly related to her. My brother and she
are to go down this summer into Scotland, to
see a nobleman who is her uncle by her mo∣ther's
side. She is ridiculously vain of her
family, and has taught Sir George to be so
too; so that now he hardly vouchsafes to own
a relation that is untitled.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21.—Lady V—, whose friendship
has been one of the chief resources of com∣fort
to me, went out of town this morning.
She is retired, for life I fear, to a distant part
of Lancashire, in order to spend the rest of
her days with her eldest sister, a widow lady,
of whom she is very fond. Her son's ill be∣haviour
has disgusted her so, she has broke
with him intirely. Her younger son is gone
into the army, not, I find, with her appro∣bation:
and she told me, she has nothing
now worth living for, at least nothing for
which she should subject herself to the cares
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
of life. She insisted on my corresponding
with her; and renewed her assurances of
that kind attachment, which 1 have already
so strongly experienced.</P>
<P>At another time the loss of this dear wo∣man's
society would have affected me more
sensibly; but I am so inured to disappoint∣ment
and grief, that I am almost become a
stoic.</P>
<P>Patty has already informed you, that Miss
Burchell is often with us; she is more sollici∣tous,
more assiduous than ever in her atten∣dance
on my mother. I find she even
sat up with her two nights, on an illness
which seized her on her first hearing the news
of my misfortune. Poor girl! My mother
tells me she went so far as to express her ap∣prehensions
on my being again single; but
my mother quieted her fears on that head
(not without a soft reprimand for her doubt∣ing),
by putting her in mind, that besides
the circumstances not being altered in regard
to her, she had received my solemn promise,
that, whenever it was in my power, I would
use my whole influence (whatever that might
be) in her favour. I did make her such a
promise, and shall fulfil it to the utmost.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland's absence from the king∣dom,
hitherto put it out of my power; nor
would I, without my beloved Mr. Arnold's
participation, have ever attempted it. Had
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
he lived, fully restored as I was to his con∣fidence
and good opinion, I should have
ventured to disclose the secret to
him, and got him to join with me in
such measures, as I should have thought
best for Miss Burchell's happiness. It now
rests upon myself alone, and I will leave
nothing unattempted to serve her.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 22—You will be surprized
perhaps, my Cecilia, when I tell you that
Mr. Faulkland is now in England. Miss
Burchell told me so this day. She men∣tioned
it in a careless manner, rather di∣recting
her discourse to my mother. She
had too much delicacy to hint at conse∣quences
of any kind from this circumstance,
and quickly turned from the subject. My
mother asked her impatiently, when he
came; where he was; and several other
questions; to none of which she could give
any answer, but that she heard he had
been returned above three months, and
was at his seat in Hertfordshire. I am
surprized Sir George never mentioned this
to me: to be sure he knew it; he is
not extremely nice in his notions; how∣ever
this is a decorum for which I am
obliged to him. Lady V—doubtless
was ignorant of it, or she would have told
me.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="107"/>
There is nothing now to prevent me
from warmly interfering for Miss Burchell.
Charming young woman! how is she to
be pitied! The tedious years of suspence,
of almost hopeless love, that she has passed,
deserve a recompence; and her little boy,
my mother tells me, is a lovely creature.
Miss Burchell brought him once to see my
mother; Mr. Faulkland's former house∣keeper
visits the child often, and has
brought his mother frequent and large sup∣plies
for his use.</P>
<P>I told Miss Burchell, at parting to-day,
that I had not forgot my promise; and
that, as soon as decency would per∣mit,
nothing should hinder me from being
a most strenuous advocate for her. She
squeezed my hand, and whispered, dear
madam, my fate is in your power!</P>
<P>I would it were, then should she soon
be happy. But I will acquit myself as far as
I am able.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 22.—I was prevailed on to
dine at my brother's to-day, the first time
that I have been abroad ever since I came
to town: I had no mind to go; but my
mother, not being well, had excused her∣self;
and she said, it would be taken amiss
if I did so too, lady Sarah herself having
made the invitation. Her ladyship said, I
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
need not be fearful of meeting strangers
at her house, as it was to be a private day.
So much the better thought I; nothing else
should induce me to go.</P>
<P>It was the first time I ever was in Sir
George's house, which is a very magni∣ficent
one, within a door or two of Mr.
Faulkland's, in St. James's-Square, as lady
Sarah did not approve of that which he
had before. But, my dear, the ostentation
of this woman made me sick; such a pa∣rade
of grandeur, such an unnecessary dis∣play
of state and splendor, I thought, looked
like an insult upon me. I was carried
into a most sumptuous drawing-room; but
as this was a private day, as she called it,
the furniture was all covered up with bo∣dy-cloths;
and the room, having been newly
washed, felt extremely cold.</P>
<P>I was told her ladyship was dressing,
though it was then, as I imagined, her
dinner-time. After I had shivered here for
about half an hour, lady Sarah's woman
came to desire me to walk up stairs. As
the woman did not know me, and, from
the little ceremony she saw me treated
with, concluded I was some humble visi∣tor,
she took me up the back stairs to her
lady's dressing room, where I found lady
Sarah, who was not yet half dressed, in
consultation with her millener. The wo∣man
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
man was trying some head-dresses on her
before the glass. She made me a very slight
apology for having kept me waiting so
long; and, to mend the matter, told me,
as she was not near ready, if I chose look∣ing
at the house, I should have time enough
to do it before dinner. I thanked her; but
said, I had already sat so long in the cold,
that I felt myself chilled; and with her la∣dyship's
permission, would place myself at
her fire-side till dinner was ready. She ask∣ed
her woman, carelesly, why I had not
been shewn into the dining-parlour. She
then turned to her millener again, to whom
she gave a particular charge to have a
suit of very rich point, which she had fixed
on, done up for her against the next night;
by which I found my sister was going to
throw off her mourning intirely; that which
she had on being so slight, that it was scarcely
to be distinguished for such.</P>
<P>My brother entered the room while she
was thus employed; and having saluted me,
looked at his watch, and asked lady Sarah,
had she ordered dinner later than usual?
She told him, she had ordered it half an
hour later than ordinary, as she had a mind
to make a long morning, having dedicated
it to trades-people, with whom she had a
hundred things to settle. My brother cast
a side-glance at me: I thought he looked
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
a little abashed at the impertinence and ill-breeding
of his wife.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah had by this time huddled on
her cloaths: a laced footman appeared at
the door, who summoned us by a silent
bow, to dinner.</P>
<P>The millener gathered up her frippery,
and put them into a band-box; telling her,
she would wait on her ladyship again. Lady
Sarah answered, You have a monstrous way
to go, Mrs.—(I forget the name);
and, as I have not half done with you yet,
you may stay and dine here, as we are
alone, and I will look over the rest of the
things in the evening, as I shall not have
another leisure day while I am in town.</P>
<P>This was going a little too far: Sir
George felt it. I believe, lady Sarah, said
he, this gentlewoman has a coach waiting
for her at the door (he had seen it, for
he was but just come in); perhaps it may
be inconvenient to detain her: she may
leave the things, and call another time.
The woman took the hint, though she
before seemed inclined to accept of the ho∣nour
lady Sarah had done her. She made
her court'sey, and withdrew. As this, how∣ever,
had brought on a variety of fresh
instructions, it detained us so long, that
the dinner was quite cold; nor was our
repast, had it even been warm, by any
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
means answerable to the elegance of the
service, the superb sideboard, and the num∣ber
of attendants. In short, the dinner was
composed of a parcel of tossed-up dishes,
that looked like the fragments of a feast.
You know there is nobody more indiffe∣rent
to the pleasures of the table than I
am; yet I own that this, joined to the rest
of this foolish woman's behaviour, nettled
me extremely. There was such a mixture
of sordidness and vanity in the whole ap∣paratus,
as made it truly contemptible.</P>
<P>I made haste to put an end to my vi∣sit,
as soon as I possibly could after din∣ner,
with a resolution never to repeat it.</P>
<P>From these few sketches of lady Sarah,
you may form some kind of an idea of
what sort of a creature it is. I should pity
Sir George, but that I think her disposi∣tion
is not extremely opposite to his own.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 24.—I am told that the widow
Arnold is actually married to that vile at∣torney
who was the contriver, and more
than partner, in her iniquity. I am really
glad she has lost the name of a family
to which she was a disgrace. Every body
now believes that I and my children have
been greatly injured; but how unavailing
is compassion; it only mortifies, when it
is expressed by the pitying words and looks
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
of people, who have it neither in their
power nor inclination to assist you. This
Mrs. Arnold, bad as she is, is visited and
caressed. Favour always follows the for∣tunate.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 25.—This day Sir George and
his lady set out for Scotland. He came to
take his leave of us; but made an apo∣logy
for lady Sarah, whose hurry would
not permit her to call on us. My bro∣ther
says, they shall stay some months at
her uncle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Lord K—. He told me,
at parting, he should write to me as soon
as he got to his journey's end, having
something very particular to say to me.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 7.—I have read over my journal
of the last fortnight, and am startled to
think what a poor insignificant being I am!
Not a single act worth recording, even to
<HI>you.</HI> My whole life perhaps may have
passed so; yet one is apt to fancy, that
they are doing something of importance,
while they are engaged in the little bustle
of the world, be it in ever so trifling a
manner; and when you find you have a
variety of incidents to relate, in which you
yourself were concerned, that your time
has not been spent in vain. But for these
last fourteen days, had I kept a journal
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
for my cat, I think I should have had as
much to say for her.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8.—I shall grow busy again: I
have received the promised letter from Sir
George; an extraordinary one it is: but I
will not anticipate the contents; read them
yourself.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Dear Sidney, <DATE>July 4, 1706.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I have a serious subject to offer to your
consideration, which made me the rather
chuse to engage your attention in this man∣ner,
than in a conversation between our∣selves;
liable as that would be to inter∣ruptions,
objections, and frivolous puncti∣lios,
from which you have already suffered
so severely.</P>
<P>I have paid so much regard to that de∣corum
of which you are so fond, as ne∣ver
to have mentioned Mr. Faulkland's
name to you since you were become a widow,
though it is near four months since he re∣turned
to England.</P>
<P>As I kept up a correspondence with him
when he was abroad, you may be sure I
informed him of your reconciliation to your
late husband; a reconciliation, which, if
you thought it a happiness to you, you were
indebted to Faulkland for. This single
circumstance it was that inclined him to
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
return to England, which otherwise perhaps
he would never again have seen, though the
necessity of his affairs here, which he had
left at random, required his presence. To
avoid giving umbrage to your husband, he
repaired privately to his house in the country,
where I paid him a visit. Few of his friends,
except myself, knew of his being in the king∣dom.</P>
<P>Remember, Sidney, the great obligations
you have to Mr. Faulkland, and let that
prepare your mind for what I am going to
say.</P>
<P>You are now become a free woman:
Faulkland loves you still, with an unparal∣lel'd
affection. I had a letter from him
soon after your arrival in town, wherein he
mentions the revival of his hopes from your
present situation, and intreats me to be
mindful of his interest. He charged me,
however, not to mention his name to you,
till a decent time was passed; otherwise
probably you would have been acquainted
with these particulars sooner: but Faulk∣land
himself has a little too much of that
ridiculous nicety which you admire so. I
think I have waited till a <HI>very</HI> decent time,
as you have now been almost three months
a widow.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115"/>
I have very little reason to imagine that
<HI>my</HI> influence, on this occasion will have any
weight either with you or my mother: I
have had proofs of this already; but I hope
you will not be so blind to your own interest,
as to refuse the good that fortune once more
throws at your feet. I can hardly suppose
you so weak, as to let the absurd objection,
which formerly prevented your happiness,
still prevail with you to reject the same hap∣piness,
so unexpectedly again offered to your
acceptance.</P>
<P>My mother and you have by this time
learnt how how to forgive <HI>human frailties.</HI>
Indeed you forgave such enormities, that
Faulkland's transgression, in comparison of
them, was innocence. But I will not re∣proach
the memory of the dead.</P>
<P>Whatever pretence you might formerly
have had to carry your punctilios to an ex∣traordinary
height, certain circumstances in
your life have now made your situation very
different. You are destitute of fortune, in∣cumbered
with children. Reflect on this,
and let your own imagination supply the
rest. To any body but yourself, I should
think all that I have said needless; but
I know the minds that I have to deal
with.</P>
<P>I must take this opportunity of telling you,
that I am surprized at my mother's continued
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
attachment to Miss Burchell; she is an art∣ful
creature, and, I think, by no means a
proper acquaintance for you. I am far from
wishing to injure her; but such an intimacy
may be dangerous.</P>
<P>You will certainly hear from Faulkland
before it be long. I repeat it again, You
owe him more than ever you will be able to
repay: the recompence he desires will ensure
your own happiness and prosperity: your
gratitude, as well as your prudence, will now
be put to the test, and your conduct, on
this occasion, will determine me as to the
light in which I shall henceforth consider
you.</P>
<P>Present my duty to my mother. Lady Sa∣rah
desires her service may be accepted.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>What a letter is this, my sister! But
Sir George is still himself; gross; void of
sentiment: he dreams of nothing but the
glaring advantages that fortune and rank
in life procure. And how he argues too!
Weak arguer! He <HI>will not suppose that the
objection</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>absurd he calls it), <HI>which formerly
prevented my happiness, should still prevail
with me to reject the same happiness</HI>—Why
not? Is the nature of Mr. Faulkland's of∣fence
changed? Has he ever repaired it?
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
Has not miss Burchell the same claim she
ever had? Nay, a stronger than ever, if
years of unabated love can give it her? <HI>My
mother and I have by this time learnt to forgive
human frailties; nay, we forgave enormities</HI>—
Unkind brother, to rake up the unfortunate
ashes of my beloved. We have, indeed,
learnt to forgive human frailties; but they
were the frailties of a husband, a repenting
husband, who was seduced to the commission
of those crimes which he abhorred: but sure∣ly
that is no plea for my overlooking the
faults of another, to whom I am under no such
tie. I am now <HI>without fortune and incumbred
with children.</HI> Indelicate man! does he think
<HI>that</HI> an argument in favour of his proposal?
It is a strong one against it. Shall I, who,
when I was in the virgin-bloom of youth,
flattered with some advantages of person,
which time and grief have since impaired,
and not destitute of fortune; I, who then re∣jected
Mr. Faulkland from motives which
still subsist; shall I, now that I have lost those
advantages, meanly condescend to accept of
this rejected man? This would, indeed, be
acknowleging, that the humiliating change
had levelled me to those principles which I
formerly contemned; would lay me under
mortifying obligations to Mr. Faulkland, and
destroy the merit of that refusal which pro∣ceeded
from such justifiable motives.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118"/>
No, my sordid brother! if I <HI>could</HI> recom∣pence
Mr. Faulkland as he deserves at my
hands, I <HI>would</HI> do it; but, with such a mind
as I bear, it cannot be done your way. I say
nothing of the promise I made miss Burchell;
if I had never made her such, my sentiments
would be the same from those other conside∣rations;
but such a promise, binding as it is,
determines my conduct beyond the possibility
of a doubt.</P>
<P>How unreasonable are Sir George's preju∣dices
with regard to this unhappy young
creature! He is for ever throwing out some
invective against her. It is cruel; but I am
tempted to forgive him, as I know it pro∣ceeds
from his attachment to his friend. He
need not put me in mind of the gratitude I
owe Mr. Faulkland; I am thoroughly sensi∣ble
of it; but Sir George and I differ widely
in our ideas of expressing this gratitude. My
<HI>conduct in this affair is to determine him as to
the light in which he is hereafter to consider me.</HI>
Why, be it so. He has long lost the tender∣ness
of a brother for me; I will not regain it
at the expence of my honour. I know the
worst that can befall me is poverty. I have
already experienced almost every possible ill
in life but that, and for that I am prepared.
But I will not call myself poor while I have
an upright heart to support me; and the
means, poor and despicable as they are, of
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
sustaining life. But what do I call despica∣ble?
Have I not an estate, my dear, a whole
fifty pounds a year, that I can call my own?
This much was reserved to me out of my
jointure when the rest was sold; and on this,
whenever it pleases heaven to take my mother
away, will I retire to some cottage in a cheap
country, where my two children and I will
live, and smile at the rich and the great.</P>
<P>My brother's letter has vexed and disgust∣ed
me exceedingly. <HI>Lady Sarah presents her
service.</HI> Vain woman! is that a becoming
phrase to the mother of her husband? I am
so provoked I think I shall not answer him:
he has no relish for such arguments as I could
produce in support of my own opinions, and
my writing to him would only bring on dis∣agreeable
altercations. My mother is in a
downright passion with him: Selfish wretch!
she called him; and said, he would sacrifice
both honour and justice to his own pride.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 19.—Miss Burchell; poor soul, how
I pity her! Her anxiety increases every hour.
She, you may be sure, keeps a look-out on
all Mr. Faulkland's motions; for, she tells
me, she hears he is arrived in town. I sup∣pose
I shall receive a notice of some kind or
other from him. The unhappy girl; she
grieves me to see her! There never was so
extravagant a love as her's: she has nourished
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
it in solitude, and I believe has a heart natu∣rally
tender to an uncommon degree; other∣wise
she could not, for so long a time, and
with so little hopes, have preserved so undi∣minished
a fondness; but some accidents
have, I know not how, combined to feed
this flame. She acknowledges that Mr.
Faulkland's being disappointed in espousing
me, gave the first encouragement to her
hopes; for, she said, she had reason to be∣lieve
that I was the only woman in the world
that stood between her and her happiness;
and Mr. Faulkland's remaining single ever
since confirmed her in that opinion. Then
the generous attention that he paid to her
welfare, in recommending her to my mo∣ther's
notice, when he first left England;
the noble supplies that he constantly furnish∣ed
her with, ever since, for the child's use;
his behaviour to Mr. Gerrarde, who, she
says, is the most ensnaring of creatures; the
tender manner that he mentioned her in his
letter to my brother; my mother's constant∣ly
indulging her in the belief that she would
one day recover Mr. Faulkland's affections:
all these circumstances, I say, joined toge∣ther,
have kept alive the warmest and most
romantic love I ever saw or heard of. Well
may the men say, that forsaken women are
always the most passionate lovers: it may
be so, and Miss Burchell is one instance of
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
the truth of this observation; but I think I
should never make another. There is some∣thing
to me unaccountable in this; but Miss
Burchell is all made up of languishments
and softness. I have beard her speak of Mr.
Faulkland in so rapturous a strain as has
amazed me; and she once owned to me,
that she is sure she must have died, if he
had not returned her love. Return it! Ah!
my Cecilia, how did he return it? How
mortifying is her situation! to be compelled
to court the man who flies her, and to make
use of a rival's mediation too! but let me
forget that name; I am no longer so to her,
and shall do my best to prove it. She wea∣ried
me with importunities to write to Mr.
Faulkland, now he is come to town; but I
beseeched her to have a little patience, till
some overture was first made by him toward
a renewal of our acquaintance, which, I
told her, it was very probable I should soon
receive. You may be sure I took care not
to let her know of the intimation I had from
Sir George. She seems fearful of my see∣ing
Mr. Faulkland. Oh! madam, said she,
if he beholds your face again, I am undone,
unless you can first prevail with him—She
stopped. “I understand you, dear Miss
Burchell; I give you my word I will not
see Mr. Faulkland unless I am first con∣vinced
I can restore him to you.” “How
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
good you are, madam! your influence,
all potent as it is, can work miracles.
If Mr. Faulkland is <HI>sure</HI> you never will
be his, perhaps he may return to his <HI>first</HI>
love.” My dear, ought she to have said
so? But it is no matter; it is nothing to me
now, who was his first or second love.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 20.—It has happened to my
wish; a billet from Mr. Faulkland, sent
with compliments and how-do-ye's, to my
mother and me. Miss Burchell, who al∣most
lives with us, was present when I re∣ceived
it: her colour came and went se∣veral
times while our servant delivered his
message. I gave the letter into her hand
as soon as I had read it. There is nothing
alarming in it, madam, said I; see your∣self;
only a few friendly lines, such as I
might expect. Her hands shook while she
held the paper. Now, madam, said she,
returning it; now you have a charming
opportunity of writing to him. I shall
not fail, said I, to make use of it, and will
let you see what I write.</P>
<P>These are the contents of Mr. Faulk∣land's
letter:</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123"/>
Will you, madam, permit a forgot∣ten,
though not the least zealous of your
friends, to enquire after your welfare?
Forgive me, if I renew your grief, when
I tell you, that, as I must participate in
every thing that relates to you, I have
deeply mourned with you on the late ca∣lamity
that has befallen you. When La∣dy
Bidulph opens her doors to her gene∣ral
acquaintance, if I may presume to
mingle in the crowd, and kiss her hands,
I shall esteem it as a particular honour;
but will not, without her permission, at∣tempt
it. She is too good to refuse me this
indulgence: you, madam, I hope, will
not forbid it to</P>

Yes, Orlando, I must forbid you; I
know the consequences of thy insidious
visits. I'll try you to the quick. You
have given me an opportunity of wri∣ting
to you (I think) without any impro∣priety.
Miss Burchell's interest is upper∣most
in my wishes, and I will at least try
what my influence on this romantic way∣ward
heart can effect.</P>
<P>How happy should I think myself, if
<HI>my</HI> mediation, <HI>all potent</HI> as she called it,
would have the desired success!</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 21.—I wrote to Mr. Faulkland
last night: my mother approved of the
letter, which I shewed her before I sent
it. Mr. Faulkland was abroad when it
was left at his house; but as I received
an answer to it early this morning, I will
give you copies of the two letters, toge∣ther;
and first that of mine to Mr. Faulk∣land.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir, thank you from my
heart, for your friendship, and beg you
will not think me ungrateful for having
thus long deferred to pay you my acknow∣ledgments
for the signal favours I have
received at your hands. I am sensible,
Sir, that it was owing to your compassion,
your generosity, and disinterested nobleness
of mind, that I was once indebted for the
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
greatest blessing of my life. To you I
owe the vindicating of my suspected faith,
and the being restored to the affection of
my dear husband. For this goodness I
have never ceased to bless and pray for
you, and shall continue to do so while I
live. But oh! Sir, while you have given
<HI>me</HI> so much cause for gratitude and esteem,
why will you leave one heart to sigh for
your unkindness? a heart that admires,
that loves, that adores you! a heart wor∣thy
of your acceptance, and which has
a right to demand all your tenderness.
Need I name the amiable possessor of this
heart? I need not; there is but one wo∣man
in the world who owns this descrip∣tion:
for her let me become an advocate;
she has won me to her party: indeed, Sir,
she, and she only, deserves your love.
Her's, I am sure, you have ever pos∣sessed,
unrivalled, though her youth, her
beauty, and charming accomplishments,
must have made her the object of every
one's wishes who saw her. 'Tis above
four years since you first won her virgin
affections. What has been her portion
since that fatal time? Tears, solitude,
and unremitting anguish. How can a
mind like yours, susceptible as it is of pity
for the woes of others condemn <HI>such</HI> a
woman to perpetual sorrow? How can
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
that generosity, which has been so active
on other occasions, droop and languish
where there is <HI>such</HI> a cause to call forth
all its exertions?.</P>
<P>Do, Mr. Faulkland, permit pity to
plead in your bosom for the dear Miss
Burchell. I should urge paternal affection
too; but to the voice of nature you can∣not
be deaf. Your sweet little son calls
upon you to do him and his mother jus∣tice;
the injured lady herself implores your
compassion; my mother, who equally ad∣mires
and loves her, intreats you; I,
whom you once esteemed, conjure you;
the secret monitor in your own soul must
join in our sollicitations. Why then,
why will you shut your ears against the
united voice of reason, of conscience, and
of gratitude? You cannot, you will not
do it. Miss Burchell's merit and suffer∣ings
must be rewarded; and I shall bless
Mr. Faulkland as the guardian of the in∣jured,
the patron of the afflicted, the as∣sertor
of his own, as well as of my ho∣nour.
This is the light, and this only, in
which I shall rejoice to see him.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
<OPENER>Mr. FAULKLAND's Answer.</OPENER>
<P>You do well, Madam, you do well to
anticipate my suit; and, with so much
cruel eloquence, to bid me despair. Yes,
I see Miss Burchell has won you to her
party; but what have I done to merit such
a malevolent fate, that <HI>you,</HI> you of all
created beings, should become <HI>her</HI> advo∣cate?
I little thought Mrs. Arnold would
make such a barbarous use of her power.
Tell me, thou dear tyrant, how have I
deserved this? Would it not have been
kinder to have said at once, Faulkland, do
not hope; I never will be yours; I hate,
I despise you, and leave you to your fate?
Oh! no; you are artful in your cruelty;
you would prevent even my wishes, and
cut off my hopes in their blossom, before
they dare to unfold themselves to you.</P>
<P>But you have furnished me with wea∣pons
against yourself, and I will use them
with as little mercy as you have shewn
to me. If four years are past since I
won Miss Burchell's affections, is it not
also <HI>as</HI> long that I have loved you with an
ardor—Oh thou insensible! Were you
not mine by your own consent, with your
mother's approbation? Was not the day,
the hour fixed, that I was to have led
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
you to the altar? Miss Burchell's hopes
were never raised to such a pitch as
mine, when an avenging fiend snatched
the promised blessing from my grasp.
Think what were then my sufferings. I
saw you afterwards in the arms of ano∣ther.
Miss Burchell never suffered <HI>such</HI>
torture. Had I seen you <HI>happy,</HI> I might
have been consoled. If Miss Burchell
loved me as I have loved you, she would
rejoice in the prospect of my felicity. I
should have done so in your's, Heaven is
my witness! Had you been happy, I
should not have thought myself miserable,
though you were lost to my hopes.</P>
<P>Why do you compel me to urge an
ungrateful truth in regard to Miss Bur∣chell?
Madam, she has no claim to my
vows: my gratitude, my compassion, she
has an ample right to, and she has them.
More might by this time have been her's,
if I had never seen Mrs. Arnold.</P>
<P>Remember, I do not yet desire permission
to throw myself at your feet; I revere you
too much to make such a request; but
do not banish me your presence. I can∣not
always be proof against such rigours.
Indulge me at least in the hope that time
may do something in my favour. I will
not desire you to tell me so; but do not
forbid it. Lady Bidulph knows I respect
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
her; but she is still obdurate. If <HI>she</HI>
relented, would not <HI>you,</HI> madam, do so
too?</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>How this man distresses me, my dear!
What a difficult talk have I undertaken!
yet I will go through with it. I am
fearful of letting Miss Burchell see his
answer, so discouraging as it is for her;
yet how can I withold it from her sight?
'Tis necessary I should conceal nothing
from her on this occasion; she confides
in me, and I must not give her cause for
suspicion. <HI>She has no right to his vows.</HI>
This he always said. It is necessary the
lady should be quite explicit with me. I
doubt she has not been altogether sincere
in what she has said to my mother on this
subject. I shall see her presently, and
discourse with her more particularly on
this head than I have ever yet done.…</P>
<P>I have had a conference with Miss
Burchell, a long one, and in private;
for I told my mother I wished to talk
with her alone.</P>
<P>I began with shewing her Mr. Faulk∣land's
last letter. It had the effect I ex∣pected.
She was exceedingly shocked. I
laid my finger on that paragraph, <HI>She
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
has no right to my vows.</HI> It is necessary,
my dear madam, said I, that you should
be perfectly open and candid with me on
this head. I have entered the lists for
you, and will not give, up your cause; but
it depends on you to furnish me with
every possible argument in your favour.
If you mislead me by wrong insinuations,
instead of putting it in my power to serve
you, you will only create to yourself fresh
obstacles.</P>
<P>It is a nice subject, madam, and what
I have ever been cautious of touching
upon to you; but in the present situation
of your affairs, it is of the utmost impor∣tance
to you, that you should have no
reserves to me. When Mr. Faulkland first
recommended you to my mother's ac∣quaintance,
he referred her to your ho∣nour,
for an explanation of certain points,
of so delicate a nature, that I am loath
to touch upon them. But pardon me,
dear Miss Burchell, you must be open
with me. Mr. Faulkland was obliged to
declare, in his own justification, that he
never sought to gain your affections; and
was so far from endeavouring to take ad∣vantage
of the kind sentiments you had
for him, that he avoided all opportunities
of improving them; that he was even
surprized into the fatal step, which has
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
since made you so unhappy, by the arti∣fices
of that vile woman, who had the care
of you.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland relied so entirely on
your candour, that, as I told you before,
he referred my mother to you, for a con∣firmation
of the truth of what he ad∣vanced;
imagining that your testimony
would in some measure extenuate his
fault. My mother, I have reason to be∣lieve,
has heard the story from you in a
light less favourable to Mr. Faulkland.
I was married before she received any in∣formation
on this subject from you; and
as any extenuation on Mr. Faulkland's
side was then become a matter of indif∣ference
to me, I enquired not into par∣ticulars;
but by what I could judge from
my mother's discourse then, and from
hints which she has many times dropped
since, I am inclined to believe, that either
Mr. Faulkland concealed some particu∣lars,
or that you, from a delicacy very
natural to a young lady in such circum∣stances,
chose to draw a veil over some
parts of your story. But, dear madam,
all disguises must now be thrown aside;
depend upon it, your candour will more
effectually recommend you to Mr. Faulk∣land's
esteem, than any thing else; and,
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
perhaps, your justifying him to <HI>me,</HI> may
be no immaterial circumstance in your
favour.</P>
<P>Variety of passions discovered them∣selves
on her face while I spoke, but
shame was predominant. She was mute,
and hung down her head. I took her by
the hand, Do not think, my dear, I mean
to ensnare you; far be such perfidy from
my heart! Have I not promised you my
assistance? I declare, by every thing that
is sacred, you shall have it to the utmost
stretch of my power; but do not let a
false bashfulness stand between you and
sincerity; you will stop up the way to your
own happiness if you do. Speak, dear
madam, has Mr. Faulkland been just in
his representations?</P>
<P>She burst into a flood of tears: Oh!
madam, you read my very soul; what
disguise can I make use of, before such
penetrating eyes as yours? Yes, Mr.
Faulkland <HI>has</HI> spoke the truth, shameful
as the confession is for me, I own it.
Mrs. Gerrarde, base woman! betrayed
me; my own mad passion did the rest.
Mr. Faulkland told me, a few days after
the fatal evening, that he was the most
miserable man on earth for what had
happened: he said there was a lady in
the world to whom he was bound to of∣fer
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
his hand; that her brother was his
particular friend; that his marriage was
then actually negotiating; and he was
pressed on that occasion to return to
London. He owned he had never seen
the lady, but as his honour was engaged
to her brother he could not look upon
himself as a free man. He cursed his ill
fate, that he had not an opportunity of
informing me of this sooner; which, he
said, might have prevented me from cast∣ing
away my affection on a man, who
could not deserve it. What could I say,
madam? There was no room for re∣proaches
or complaints. I made none; I
had nobody to accuse but myself. I had
declared my frantic love to Mr. Faulk∣land
unasked; I had implored his in re∣turn:
in one dreadful moment I fell a sa∣crifice
to my own weakness. The only
hope that now remained for me, was
built on that circumstance of Mr. Faulk∣land's
having never seen his destined bride.
Had I known you, madam, to have been
the person, there could have sprung but
small comfort from that consideration;
but ignorant as I was of the lady's merit,
I thought it not impossible but that some
objection might have arisen either to her
person or temper; or the lady, perhaps,
(though that I thought almost incredible)
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
might not approve of Mr. Faulkland:
in either case, some glimmerings of hope
remained for me. Mr. Faulkland's ge∣nerous
compassion for me, gave me room
to think he did not hate me, and I was
unwilling to lose the little interest I
thought I had gained in his heart, by
<HI>fond complainings,</HI> much less upbraidings,
for which he had given me no cause. I
therefore acquiesced, determined to wait
for what my fate was to do with me; re∣solving
privately in my own mind, that
in case Mr. Faulkland's intended nupti∣als
should not take place, to remind him
of my love. I did not confess to my
aunt what had been the result of that in∣terview,
which she had contrived between
Mr. Faulkland and me: shame would
not suffer me to divulge it. But it was
not long in my power to conceal it: I
believe indeed, she suspected it before.
She reproached me for the error which
she herself had caused; but I believe, what
most nettled her was Mr. Faulkland's
having escaped the snare; for I am sure
she would have been base enough to have
had me retain him as a lover, though I
could not secure him for a husband; for
he was not the first, that this bad woman
would have seduced me to favour, for
her own private interest.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="135"/>
In the midst of the horror, into which
the condition I found myself in threw me,
I heard that Mr. Faulkland was on the
point of being married.</P>
<P>The prospect I had before me drove
me to despair. I knew I could not re∣main
long in my uncle's house. I knew
not whither to fly. In my distraction I
wrote to Mr. Faulkland: You, madam,
saw the letter, that ill-fated letter, which
deprived Mr. Faulkland of his happiness.</P>
<P>I soon received an answer, wherein
Mr. Faulkland related to me at large the
unfortunate consequences that letter had
produced. He lamented, in the tenderest
manner, my unhappy situation; told me,
he would provide me a proper place for
my retreat; and, as I was an entire stran∣ger
in London, having never been there,
would recommend me to the notice of
one of the best of women, lady Bidulph,
from whom, as my unhappy story was
known to her, I might expect the utmost
humanity. And here, madam, with
blushes let me own it, he urged me not
to conceal a single circumstance of the
truth from that lady.</P>
<P>“You know, said he, my dear miss
Burchell, I am not a <HI>seducer;</HI> rescue
me from that black suspicion; and, as
far as the unhappy case will admit,
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
clear my honour to lady Bidulph. See
what a reliance I have on <HI>your</HI> honour,
when I trust the vindicating of my own
to you, in such delicate circumstances.
He concluded his letter with telling me
frankly, that though he had been re∣jected
by Miss Bidulph, he loved her
with such an ardent passion, that it was
impossible for him ever to think of any
other woman; and till he had a heart
to bestow, he should never entertain a
thought of marriage.”</P>
<P>You know Mr. Faulkland at this junc∣ture
went abroad; and thus was I cir∣cumstanced
when I came to that house,
which he had provided for me. And so
frank and noble were his proceedings,
that I solemnly declare, I was determin∣ed,
though at the hazard of divulging
my own shame, to have acquitted him
to the utmost of my power to lady Bi∣dulph;
and should have rejoiced, could
I have been the means of procuring him
the happiness he deserved, in regaining
your favour; as I had been, though un∣knowingly,
the unlucky cause of his losing
it. But fortune had disposed of you other∣wise,
before I saw lady Bidulph. This
she quickly informed me of, and I will
own to you, madam, that as I found
there was now an insuperable bar to Mr.
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
Faulkland's hopes, I was mean enough
not to have the courage to speak truth.
I saw it could not avail him, in regard to
his prospects with you. Lady Bidulph's
eye awed me; yet I think she led me in∣to
a justification of myself, so great were
her prejudices against Mr. Faulkland. Or,
perhaps, having already disposed of you
in marriage in vindication of this step,
she did not wish to be undeceived. Yes,
again, in spite of my confusion, I must
repeat it, I was not sincere; I threw out
such hints to lady Bidulph, as must have
made her think Mr. Faulkland had taken
pains to undo me: to this act of disin∣genuousness,
my sole motive was, that I
might appear in a less culpable light in
the eyes of a lady of such strict virtue
as your mother. By making her my
friend, I was in hopes one day of making
you so too. Devoted, as Mr. Faulkland
was, to the most charming woman in
the world, I was not afraid of his making
a second choice. I thought, if he <HI>were</HI>
to be induced to marry, he might, in
time, be prevailed upon to turn his thoughts
towards me. In this hope I have dragged
on so many tedious years. I was not mis∣taken
in my opinion, that he could find
none worthy to succeed Mrs. Arnold in
his heart. He loves you still, madam;
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
but you have declared you never will be
his; he is still free; these are the circum∣stances
that nourish my hope. My heart
is in your hand; I have made you mis∣tress
of my dearest secret. Can you for∣give
me, madam? But you have an he∣roic
soul! Remember, Mrs. Arnold, to
your generosity I now trust what is dearer
to me than life. Should Mr. Faulkland
know, should lady Bidulph know, how I
have abused their confidence, I think I
could not out-live it.</P>
<P>They never shall, madam, said I: I
thank you for this frank acknowledgment
of your heart; such a proof of your
confidence in me, I should be a wretch
to abuse; and I hope to make such a
use of the candid confession you have now
made me, as will greatly promote your
interest.</P>
<P>And is it possible, madam, said she,
you can yield up the interest you have
in Mr. Faulkland without a pang? Oh!
the exquisite charmer! and she said it
with such an emphasis, drawing out
her breath in long sighs. But you are
heroic, as I said before: Nature did not
mold your heart, as she has done those
of the rest of your sex. Who that was
beloved by Mr. Faulkland, would yield,
him to another? Worlds! ten thousand
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
worlds would I give to be beloved by
him as you are! but you are a prodigy of
a woman! I stopped Miss Burchell in
her transports. There is less merit,
madam, than you ascribe to me in my
conduct: I readily acquiesced under my
mother's rejection of Mr. Faulkland,
when he <HI>had</HI> some interest in my heart;
but there is no self-denial in what I am
now about to do for you. My affecti∣ons
have long since changed their object,
and now lie buried with him in his
grave.</P>
<P>My tears here bore witness to the
truth of what I said: Miss Burchell wept
too. Her mind was agitated; the con∣fession
she had made to me had hum∣bled
her; her heart overflowed with
fondness; I had filled her with pleasing
hopes: all these sensations combined
together, melted her into tenderness:
she is made up of tears, and sighs, and
romantic wishes.</P>
<P>I can now, said I, assure Mr. Faulk∣land,
that you have done him justice,
and that he is highly obliged to your
candour.</P>
<P>She interrupted me; But, madam,
if he should know how <HI>late</HI> my acknow∣legements
came—He need not know
it, said I; my mother shall not know
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
it neither; leave every thing to my
management, and depend upon my word.
She snatched my hand eagerly, and kis∣sed
it.</P>
<P>But oh! madam, above all things,
said she, let not Sir George Bidulph
know any thing of your intended good∣ness,
in mediating for me. He hates
me, implacably he hates me. I upbraid
him not for it: his strong attachment to
Mr. Faulkland is the cause of it: he ac∣cuses
me in his heart of being the occasi∣on,
(which I own I was, though ignorant∣ly)
of Mr. Falkland's disappointment.
I am sure, were he to know what you de∣sign
in my favour, he would counterwork
you, and use all his influence over his
friend to ruin me.</P>
<P>I made her easy on this head, by assur∣ing
her Sir George should know nothing
of the matter; and put her in mind how
lucky it was for her that he was absent.</P>
<P>I cannot help thinking, my Cecilia,
that there is a sort of a fatality has at∣tended
Mr. Faulkland's attachment to
me. By what a strange accident did we
come to the knowledge of Miss Burchell's
affair! How strong were my mother's
prepossessions against Mr. Faulkland; and
how many little circumstances concur∣red
to encourage her in this dispositi∣on!
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
His letter from Bath to my bro∣ther
helped to confirm her in her dis∣like
of his conduct; Miss Burchell's let∣ter
to Mr. Faulkland, though meant
very differently, was a strong motive
of condemnation. The only means of
justification left for him, my mother did
not apply to, till it was too late; and
then that very circumstance of it's <HI>be∣ing</HI>
too late to serve him, Miss Bur∣chell
acknowledges, was the reason that
the very method which he had proposed
for his defence, was turned to his con∣demnation.</P>
<P>Rooted, as my mother's prejudices
were, she engages herself, she engages
me, in a promise, to use my endea∣vours
to promote Miss Burchell's mar∣riage
with Mr. Faulkland. Does not all
this look as if some unseen power, who
guides our actions, had set a stamp of
disapprobation on the union between this
man and me.</P>
<P>I wish I had seen that letter which
Mr. Faulkland wrote to my brother from
Bath: my mother said, she did not read
it through. He treated the subject light∣ly,
and there was one circumstance in
particular in it that shocked her; and
yet surely, if the <HI>whole</HI> might not have
borne a favourable construction, Sir George
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
would not have shewn her that account,
by way of justifying his friend. This
reflection comes too late! Why did it
not occur sooner to my mother or to
me? We drew no other inference from
Sir George's disclosing this letter, than
that as Mr. Faulkland treated the affair
ludicrously, it was therefore expected,
both by him and my brother, that we
should consider it so too. That could
not have been the case. Miss Bur∣chell's
confession has opened my eyes—Poor
Mr. Faulkland! What a
wayward fate is thine! But let me be∣ware
of relenting; that might be fa∣tal.
There is still one indelible blot re∣mains
upon his conduct. Miss Burchell,
blameable as she acknowledges herself,
was still betrayed; and though not by
Mr. Faulkland, yet sure his having paid
the price of her innocence to the wick∣ed
aunt, renders him so far guilty, as
that he owes her a great reparation.
This was a particular I durst not touch
upon; the unhappy girl herself being
ignorant of it. There is a wide gulph
fixed between Mr. Faulkland and me.
How many things are leagued against
him? Alas! he thinks the principle bar
to his hopes is removed, and that if
Miss Burchell has been just, he ought
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
to be forgiven. But he little knows thy
Sidney's heart; critically delicate as my
situation is, in regard to him, I am re∣moved
a thousand times farther than
ever from his wishes. Neither knows
he the engagements I am under to Miss
Burchell; which alone would put an
everlasting bar between us. Unhappy
Miss Burchell! She has bound me to
her by stronger ties than ever. She
has been ingenuous; she has owned her
weakness to me; she declares she would
have done this sooner, if it could have
promoted my happiness: perhaps she
would; shall I not then endeavour to
promote her's? I will, I must; my
word is given. Yet Faulkland deserves—oh!
he deserves a worthier lot.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 22.—I now send you, my <HI>Cecilia,</HI>
my second letter to Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>“Why do you compel me, Sir, no∣ble
and disinterested as your conduct
has been towards me, to accuse you
now of unkindness? You call me in∣sensible—Oh!
it is from my too
great sensibility that all my sorrows
have sprung. Destitute as I am of
happiness myself, or even of a possibili∣ty
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
of ever attaining it here, I look
for no other comfort in this life, but
what must arise from seeing those
whom I most esteem in possession of
that tranquility of mind, which I can
never hope to enjoy. If Mr. Faulk∣land
were happy, if Miss Burchell were
happy, I should be less miserable. Re∣member,
Sir, it was not this lady's
fault that you were disappointed in
your former hope. She did not try,
by female wiles, to engage a heart
which you refused her. She used no
ungenerous arts to cross your wishes.
Loving you, as she did, almost to
distraction, she yielded you up in si∣lent
anguish to a rival; a rival supe∣rior
to herself in nothing. I acknow∣ledge,
Sir, I was to have been yours,
and with my own consent; but was
it not also with my own consent those
bonds were cancelled, by which we
were to have been united? I was
then convinced Miss Burchell had a
prior claim; I think so still, and ever
shall. Miss Burchell's family is not
mean, her fortune is considerable; her
beauty and personal accomplishments
inferior to none; and, but for Mr.
Faulkland, she had been innocent.
Yet do not imagine I would aggra∣vate
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
your fault; Miss Burchell's can∣dor
could not suffer this. How char∣mingly
ingenuous was her confession!
In the midst of tears and blushes, she
owned her weakness; you, she said,
were not to blame. She praised your
generosity, your compassion, the in∣tegrity
and frankness of your whole
behaviour towards her; and could Miss
Burchell's suffrage have ensured to
you the completion of your wishes,
Mr. Faulkland would have been in∣debted
to her for what he once thought
his happiness. But though her testi∣mony
could not avail you in that par∣ticular,
yet are your obligations to her
the same. Does not then Miss Bur∣chell
love Mr. Faulkland with a ge∣nerosity
equal to his own? Do years
of fervent and unalterable affection
deserve no return? Does the child,
the dear innocent that calls you fa∣ther,
deserve no consideration? He
bears your name, Sir; let him not
blush to own it: he may one day
be an honour and a comfort to you.
Put it in his power to make it his
boast, instead of his shame, that Mr.
Faulkland was his father. The ami∣able
lady, whose very life is bound
up in you, has, in the midst of her
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
affliction, one great source of comfort;
her character has escaped the malig∣nity
of cruel tongues, by the privacy
with which she conducted her mea∣sures,
till after the birth of your son.
The retirement she has since lived
in; her prudent, her modest, her ex∣emplary
conduct, have created esteem
in every body that knows her; this
circumstance, as it is a peculiar feli∣city
to herself, so ought it to be a
motive of encouragement to you, Sir,
to complete her happiness. The false-judging
part of the world will have
nothing to point at; Miss Burehell's
relation, or even connection with Mrs.
Gerrarde is hardly known here; she
has had no correspondence with that
irregular woman since she became a
widow; and her character had not
suffered before, in such a manner, as
to reflect dishonour on the young la∣dy,
who was then under her care.
How then can you persist in a cruel
rejection of this lady? You own she
is amiable: I am sure she has a thou∣sand
good qualities. Is her love for
you, her unparalleled love, to be im∣puted
to her as a crime? if it be
one, long and bitter has been her
punishment! On you it rests to re∣compence
her sufferings. What may
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
you not expect from a grateful heart
that worships you? Such a fervent,
such a faithful love (deserving as you
are) you perhaps may never a∣gain
meet with in woman. With
her you may be happy, she will
make it the whole study of her life
to render you so. Your own heart,
conscious of having acted nobly, will
confirm your happiness. Would to
God I could inspire you with such
sentiments as would induce you to
make the generous experiment! How
would your character rise in the es∣teem
of the two persons whom you
profess to revere! How would you be
adored by the amiable sufferer! but
above all, how delightful must be
the exultations of the self-approving
mind! There wants but this act to
render you the most deserving of men.
I would fain esteem, respect, admire you
as I ought; but you will not let me:
you will be a <HI>common</HI> man, and un∣distinguished,
amongst the light ones
of your sex.”</P>
<P>I shewed this letter to Miss Burchell;
she read it with grateful tears running
down her cheeks. In about an hour
I received the following answer to it.</P>
<P>“Miss Burchell may triumph, Ma∣dam,
since she has obtained <HI>you</HI> for
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
her advocate. Well have you acquit∣ted
yourself of the task your rigid
heart has undertaken. I thank the
lady for the justice her charming in∣genuousness
(as you rightly call it)
has done me. But what have I gained
by this? Have I not raised the fair
complainant still higher in your es∣teem,
given her a stronger claim to
your pity, and furnished you with
arms against myself? Wretch that I
am, I do, I must acknowledge the
force of every thing that you have
urged. Miss Burchell is amiable, her
sincerity, her constancy and (by me)
unmerited love, deserve to be greatly
recompenced. I would to heaven I
had a heart to give her! but I have
not; <HI>you</HI> know I have not; <HI>she</HI> knows
it too. Could I have made Miss Bur∣chell
the return she deserves, I would
not thus long have shunned her pre∣sence.
I acknowledged the state of
my heart to her even at the time I
had lost all hopes of possessing you.
And in the spite of my own strug∣gles,
after years of confirmed despair,
I found myself still enslaved. How
then could I offer a hand, devoted
as my whole soul was to another ob∣ject,
to a lady, whose constant, ten∣der,
and delicate affection, demanded
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
all the return that a sensible and grate∣ful
heart could make? This, Madam,
is all the plea I can urge in answer to
those arguments you offer to promote
your favourite wish. Consalt your own
delicacy, let Miss Burchell consult hers,
and then perhaps I shall stand acquit∣ted
of ingratitude.”</P>
<P>“I hoped, Madam, that cleared as I
have been of <HI>one</HI> imputation, I might
have recovered some favour in your's
and Lady Bidulph's thoughts. I was
flattered with this consolation, small
as it was, when every other hope for∣sook
me. But when an unexpected
event again brought happiness within
my prospect, this reflection, I own, be∣came
of more importance, and served
to strengthen my then revived hopes.
But you dash them with an unrelent∣ing
hand; and again build up those bar∣riers
between us, that heaven itself
had overthrown. What can I say to
you, inflexible as you are? has Miss
Burchell <HI>all</HI> your pity? You may com∣mand
my life, Madam; I would lay
it down freely for you; but I cannot,
must not, will not give up my love;
and till you declare in express terms
that I <HI>must</HI> be miserable, I will not even
give up my hope.”</P>

<P><PB N="149" REF="150"/>
See, my Cecilia, the heart I have to
deal with. Hard to be subdued, and ob∣stinate
in all its purposes. I expected
difficulties, but was in hopes he would
be less determined in regard to his per∣severance
towards me. I think however
I have gained some ground; he acknow∣ledges
Miss Burchell's merit, and seems
obliged to her for the part she has ac∣ted
towards him. I have been under
some difficulties on this occasion; for as
Miss Burchell was not so candid in her
acknowledgments to my mother as she
has been to me, I cannot let her know
the whole of her confession; for this
reason, I only told her the general pur∣port
of what I wrote last to Mr. Faulk∣land;
and in reading his answer to her,
I passed over such passages as I thought
might induce her to require an expla∣nation.
I own I am a little hurt at Miss
Burchell's former perverting of facts on
this occasion; but, as I have already said
more than once, there are great allowan∣ces
to be made for one in her very cri∣tical
situation. Neither have I the least
right to reproach her for it even in my
thoughts; for had she been ever so expli∣cit
at my mother's first interview with
her, it could not have availed me.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151"/>
You find, my dear, it is necessary I
should speak plainly to Mr. Faulkland.
I shall write to him again, and here you
shall have a copy of what I say; but I
must lead this violent spirit with gentle∣ness,
and endeavour to convince his rea∣son,
without wounding his tenderness.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mrs. Arnold's third letter to Mr. Faulk∣land.</OPENER>
<P>“You give me pleasure, Sir; I begin
to descry hopes for your and my a∣miable
friend. I know such a heart as
Mr. Faulkland's cannot be proof against
sentiments of gratitude and compassi∣on;
it will not be difficult to convert
those sentiments into love, when the
object is so deserving. Try, Sir, try;
the experiment cannot fail. How much
to your honour will so noble a triumph
be over an ill-fated passion! What de∣lightful
returns may you not expect
from the obliged, the grateful partner
of your happiness! Do not call me in∣flexible,
or rigid; filled as I am with
gratitude, and a sense of your merit,
I should hate myself if I did not ac∣knowledge
that you deserve more from
me than it can ever be in my power
to repay. I must be plain with you,
since you require it; it is impossible I
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
ever can be yours. Sorry I am, that
the necessity of circumstances compels
me to make so early a declaration, from
which I thought my present situa∣tion
would have exempted me; but I
forgive you, Sir, for urging me on this
head, and draw a happy, presage from
your resting your hopes in relation to
me, on my own determination. You
appeal to my delicacy, whether you
ought, with a heart estranged, to offer
your hand to Miss Burchell? Were de∣licacy
alone to be consulted, the an∣swer
perhaps might be easy; but there
are superior considerations in your
case; to be taken in love, without
doubt, demands love in return; but
where injured honour is to be repair∣ed,
where the disgrace of a darling
child is to be prevented, those nicer
sentiments of the soul must and ought
to give way; and I will venture to
pronounce, that Miss Burchell would,
with raptures, receive the hand which
would confer such valuable blessings
on her; leaving it to time, and her
own unremitting tenderness and assi∣duity,
to get an interest in the heart,
which, by such an act, proved its
own rectitude. On this subject. I,
from experience, am qualified to speak.
You know, Sir, the interest you once
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
had in me; you cannot think me so
light a creature, as to suppose I so
soon after my breaking with you, be∣stowed
my affections on another. I
did not; obedience to my mother's
commands was the sole motive which
engaged my vows to Mr. Arnold; and
I married him with no other senti∣ments,
than those of esteem and gra∣titude
for the great love he bore me.
Yet from these seeds sown in my heart,
sprung a tender an ardent affection: ne∣ver
did wife love a husband better than
I did Mr. Arnold; his kindness merited,
and <HI>did</HI> win my whole affections; nor
could a temporary alienation of his
heart, dispossess him of the place he
he held in <HI>mine.</HI> His returning love
(for which, with all thankfulness, I
own myself bound to yon, Sir) made
him still dearer to me than ever, and
I now profess myself wedded to his
memory. You have a right, Sir, to
expect that I should explain myself at
once to you on this subject; for your
own sake, and for Miss Burchell's, I
must not suffer you to entertain a
doubt of my resolution. You com∣pel
me to repeat, that I think Miss
Burchell deserves your love, and has a
just right to your hand. She throws
herself upon your honour, without pre∣tending
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
to have any <HI>lawful</HI> claim; if
she <HI>had,</HI> I should not condescend to
solicit the man who could refuse to do
her justice.”</P>
<P>“My mother is firm to her first re∣solves;
could you place a crown on
my head, her integrity would still o∣blige
her to reject it; nor would a
crown tempt me to forfeit the duty
which I owe to her.”</P>
<P>“See then, Sir, if that <HI>unexpected
event</HI> which you mention (a fatal event
to me!) has brought you nearer to
your wishes; and here let me add,
in justice to my own particular sen∣timents,
that I think Mr. Faulkland
is the last man who ought to be my
choice, even if my heart were dispo∣sed
to make one. Reproach me not
with ingratitude, or caprice, till I
have explained myself. It is not
long, Sir, (blameless and unconscious
as you were of the injury, and nobly
as you repaired it) since you were the
cause of a separation between me and
my husband. I know you will say
that our mutual innocence on this oc∣casion,
and the secret's being known
but to a few of our friends, make
that objection of little weight. I
grant you, with many it might be
so; all minds are not equally suscep∣tible;
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
'tis my unhappiness to have a
too resenting heart. My own honour
(scrupulous you may call it) would not
suffer me to let the man succeed Mr.
Arnold in my love, who was the oc∣casion
of so much uneasiness to him,
and the cause of my being suspected
in my fidelity. Would it not be an
insult on his memory? Oh, Sir,
what is the world's opinion to the
approbation, of our own hearts! mine
has never yet reproached me, and
this has been my support in all my
trials. Thus much I say for the re∣verence
I bear my dear Mr. Arnold's
memory: but I have other reasons to
offer in my excuse; refinements you
will call them, but my heart feels
their force. I am not the same wo∣man
whom you once loved; afflicti∣ons
have impaired my health, and
those little advantages of person which
nature bestowed on me, have not been
improved by time; my spirits, bro∣ken
by misfortunes, have left me
languid and insensible to joy. Peace
is the utmost of my wish, and all that
I am now capable of relishing. The
bride, whom Mr. Faulkland once
sought, was in the bloom of youth,
admired and caressed by a flattering
world; unblemished in her character,
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
her fortune equal to her wishes: her
heart, her virgin heart, was then a
present, (with pride let me say it)
worthy of any man's acceptance.
It was then in her power to bestow
happiness, and Mr. Faulkland would
not have been matched unequally.
But the scene is changed; what
should I now bring to your arms? A
person faded by grief; a reputation
(though undeservedly) once called in
question; a little helpless family with∣out
fortune; a widowed heart, dead
to love, and incapable of pleasure.
Oh, Sir! could I bear to be your
wife on such conditions? Indebted to
you as I am, past a possibility of
my ever making you a return, to
what a mighty sum would you raise
the obligation? How poor would
you make me in my own eyes?
Humbled as I am by adversity,
my soul has still too much pride,
or let me call it delicacy, to sub∣mit
to this. No, if there was
no Miss Burchell in the world,
no parental sway to guide me, in
my present circumstances, I never
would be yours.”</P>
<P>“You, have now before you my fi∣nal
determination. I shall trouble
you no more on the subject. If
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
your heart relents towards Miss Bur∣chell,
great will be your reward. In
her you are sure of a tender, faithful,
and charming friend; who will more
than repay every act of kindness to∣wards
her; and he who is the au∣thor
of justice and mercy will not fail
to bless you.”</P>

<P>Methinks, my dear friend, I have
now eased my heart of a load that
oppressed it. What can I say more?
Mr. Faulkland now knows my deter∣mined
purpose in regard to myself;
and if he is not quite insensible, I
think Miss Burchell must at last obtain
the wish of her soul. Oh, my Cecilia,
I would not have my heart devoured
by such a flame as her's, for the
whole world. But have I not acted
as I should do? I hope I have; I feel
satisfied with my own conduct, and I
never yet found that to be the case
when I acted wrong. There are some
nice points, in which our own hearts
are the best, as well as the most im∣partial
judges. If Mr. Faulkland per∣sists
in rejecting poor Miss Burchell, I
can urge him no farther; but I am
determined not to see him.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158"/>
<HI>June</HI> 25.—How uneasy has been my
suspence these three days! I question if
Miss Burchell's is much greater. No an∣swer
from this strange man; perhaps he
is flown off again.—No, I wrong him,
a letter is this minute brought up to me
from him.—Read it, read it, my belov∣ed,
and congratulate me.</P>
<P>“You were born to conquer, Ma∣dam;
what is there that you cannot ef∣fect?
My heart was made for you,
and you can mould it as you please.
Enjoy your triumph, if it be one. I
will receive Miss Burchell as <HI>your</HI>
gift; and since I cannot obtain your
love, I will at least compel your esteem.
Why should <HI>your</HI> generosity, <HI>your</HI> com∣passion
for an unhappy lady, to whom
you have no obligation, exceed that of a
man who owns himself bound to her in
gratitude? I wish I could repay her the
debt of love I owe her, but I will try
to repair my fault hereafter; and in her
gentle bosom perhaps I may recover
that peace, to which I have been so
long a stranger. She will forgive the
waywardness of a heart, which never
disguised its anguish to her; and which
she knows has been torn by a fatal pas∣sion,
that, like a cruel disease, was not
either to be resisted or subdued. But
thanks to you, Madam, I think I be∣gin
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
to feel my cure approaching. Miss
Burchell's tenderness will finish what
you have begun. You shall never ap∣proach
me more; if I <HI>ever</HI> had an
interest in your heart, I will not forfeit
it now, but make that proud heart ac∣knowledge,
spite of itself, that Mr. Faulk∣land
was not unworthy of it.”</P>
<P>Ha! my Cecilia, what do you say to my
Orlando now! <HI>My</HI> Orlando let me this
once call him. Has he not a noble mind!
Happy! happy Miss Burchell! you are at
length arrived at the summit of your wish∣es.
Long may you enjoy them, and may
you make your love as blest as he de∣serves
to be! My mother clasped her
hands together in joy, when I read this
letter to her. God bless him, God bless
him, said she; he is now indeed a
righteous man. How rejoiced I am, my
dear, that I have been the means of bring∣ing
about this so-much-wished-for event.
And yet, methinks, if I were in Miss
Burchell's place, though my heart doat∣ed
on the man to death, I could not re∣ceive
him on such terms. He accepts her
as <HI>my</HI> gift; it is to raise himself in <HI>my</HI> es∣teem,
he does her justice: Nay, I think
the assuming man seems to insinuate a sort
of superiority over me, by this concession.
Why let it be so, I shall be content in
my humiliation, if <HI>my</HI> gift will restore

him to his peace. If it does, which I pray
heaven it may, ought he not think him∣self
indebted to me?</P>
<P>I think I should not let Miss Burchell see
this last letter; he does not consent with
a good grace; and it may damp her
joy. Though, upon second thoughts, I
question whether she has delicacy enough
to be much affected by this circum∣stance.—</P>
<P>I am saved the trouble of observing any
decorum towards Miss Burchell. She has
been just here, wild with transport; and was
several minutes in the room before I could
get her to speak coherently. She had re∣ceived
a letter from Mr. Faulkland written
by his own angelic hand, she said. She
made no difficulty of leaving it with me,
and here it is.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I congratulated Miss Burchell (after
reading this letter) on her approaching
felicity. She had not words to express
her acknowledgments to me. The service
I had rendered her was indeed to her a
most important one; and there are some
occasions where <HI>words</HI> are of no use;
Miss Burchell can be eloquent without
them. She embraced me a thousand
times, and wept in tender transport on
my neck.</P>
<P>My mother is as much delighted at
this happy event, as if it immediately
concerned her own welfare. She recom∣mended
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
it to Miss Burchell, to have her
little boy with her when Mr. Faulkland
came to visit her. It seems he has not
seen the child since his last return to Eng∣land:
he did not care to go to the house
where it was boarded, for fear of
drawing any observation on himself to
Miss Burchell's prejudice; and the peo∣ple
never permitted the child to be
taken abroad by any one but Miss Bur∣chell,
(who passes for its aunt) or Mr.
Faulkland's house-keeper; but this good
woman, happening to be sick when he
came to town, Mr. Faulkland had not an
opportunity of sending for it.</P>
<P>Miss Burchell greatly approved of the
motion, and flew from us to prepare for
this so-much-desired interview.</P>
<P>And now my Cecilia, do you not think
Mr. Faulkland has proved himself a di∣sinterested
(lover shall I say) of your Sid∣ney?
indeed he has given a noble testi∣mony
of his esteem and deference for
me, as well as he formerly did of his affec∣tion.
If Miss Burchell does not render
herself worthy of him, how I shall hate
myself for having brought about this uni∣on!
But she loves him too ardently, and
is herself too lovely, not to get possessi∣on
of his heart, when it becomes his du∣ty,
as well as his interest, to give it up to
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
her. All acquaintance between her and
me, must now cease; for her sake, as well
as Mr. Faulkland's, this will be necessary;
my presence may disturb, but never can
contribute to the tranquillity of either of
them.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 26—Miss Burchell was in too much
haste to communicate her joy to us, to
defer the giving an account of what passed
between her and Mr. Faulkland yesterday
evening. She hurried to us last night, at
almost ten o'clock.</P>
<P>He came to her house, she said, at six,
the hour she had appointed him; and look∣ed
<HI>so</HI> enchantingly. She herself was dres∣sed
out very elegantly to receive him, and
I thought looked really charming; her
countenance was so lightned up with joy,
that she did not appear the same wo∣man.</P>
<P>She had endeavoured, she said, to com∣pose
herself for this interview, and had
tried to assume something of dignity; but it
all vanished when her conqueror approach∣ed,
and the tumult of her heart so intirely
banished all recollection, and presence of
mind, that she was not able to tell me in
what manner she received him. She only
knows, she says, that having snatched up
her little boy, who stood by her and hung
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
on her gown, she put him into his father's
arms, and bidding the babe thank him for
his goodness, she burst into tears. Mr.
Faulkland tenderly embraced the child,
not without a visible emotion of counte∣nance;
and having gently set him down
again, he placed himself by Miss Burchell's
side: She was still sobbing. Those gene∣rous
tears, Madam, said he, taking her by
the hand, reproach me too much: I have
not deserved this tenderness; I cannot look
upon you, nor that dear boy, without
blushing; but you have forgiven me; it
shall be the study of my life to make you
both happy. Oh! Madam, continued Miss
Burchell, what an exquisite joy must such
a declaration give me from the beloved of
my soul. I wrung his hand; Oh, Sir, you
are too, too good: What return can I
make you? One thing only say to me,
that you do not offer me a <HI>very</HI> reluctant
hand, and I shall then be the happiest of
women.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland paused a little while,
and then, with a noble frankness, replied:
“You know, my dear Miss Burchell,
with what an excess of passion I have
ever loved Mrs. Arnold: Had no such
woman existed, <HI>you</HI> would have been
my choice, preferably to any other:
but when I first knew you, I looked
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
upon myself as bound to her, though, at
that time, I had never seen her: my
knowledge of her afterwards confirmed
me her's. I made no secret of this to you,
and you may remember what my de∣clarations
to you were, even at the time
my hopes were frustrated. I have loved
her fervently ever since; even in the
arms of a husband I adored her; and
I will be candid enough to own to you,
that, as my attachment to her has, du∣ring
all that time, estranged me from
you, so should I still, had I the least
hopes of succeeding, have persisted in
my suit. But she has cut off all hope;
she has declared she never can be mine,
and at the same time has represented
my obligations, to you in so strong a light,
that I am convinced I ought to be your's.
And let me own, Madam, (you who
are generous, and know what it is to
love, will pardon a declaration which I
durst not make to any other woman)
to you I will confess that Mrs. Arnold
is arbitress of my fate; and in approv∣ing
myself to her, I do so to my own
conscience. I do not therefore, though
my actions have been guided by her,
yield with reluctance to her will: her
virtue, her religion, and enlarged mind,
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
have only dictated to me, what my
own reason tells me I ought to do. I
have been a slave to a hopeless pas∣sion
too long; I am now resolved to
struggle with my chains: you, madam,
must assist me in breaking them in∣tirely;
and I make no doubt but that
time, joined to my own efforts, and
aided by yout sweetness of disposi∣tion,
your tenderness, and admirable
sense, will enable me to conquer what
I must now call a weakness, and make
the triumph equally happy for us both.
But remember, madam, I never see
Mrs. Arnold more. 'Tis for your
peace sake as well as my own, that
I make this a preliminary to our mar∣riage.
I will, when you shall vouchsafe me
the honour of your hand, receive it, if
you please, from Lady Bidulph; and
as I presume it with be agreeable to
you to have the ceremony intirely pri∣vate,
that I may, for our dear lit∣tle
boy's sake, present you rather as
my acknowledged wife, than as my
new made bride, I will, with the ut∣most
speed and secrecy, have such dis∣positions
made, as shall be suitable to
my condition, and your own merit.”</P>
<P>“I should like, after we are united,
if you have no objection to it, to pay
a visit for a while to an estate I have
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
in Ireland; which I have never yet
seen, and which I intended to have
looked at, if this event, this happy
event, (and he kissed my hand) had
not taken place.”</P>
<P>Penetrated as I was, pursued Miss Bur∣chell,
with a sense of the generosity and
openness of his heart, I could not for∣bear
raising his hand to my lips; he ten∣derly
withdrew it from me, as if abash∣ed
at my condescension. He then turned
the discourse to less interesting subjects,
and after three delightful hours spent with
me, took his leave; not without hav∣ing
first fixed on Wednesday, next Wed∣nesday,
to be the blessed day that is to
make him mine for ever.</P>
<P>Happy, happy may you be, said I! you
<HI>must</HI> be happy; but let me see you once
again before you are Mrs. Faulkland: there
are not many hours to come before that
name will be yours. My dear Madam!
said she, and patted my bosom with her
hand, I hope all is well <HI>here;</HI> she looked
earnestly in my face, and then added, but
you have a noble heart. 'Tis an honest
one I hope, said I, a little disconcerted
at her manner. Why did she address
me thus, my dear? I hope I did not
discover any thing in my behaviour as if I
repined at her good fortune; if I did,
far be such a wreched meaness from the
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
heart of thy friend. Was it not my own
act to make Miss Burchell the happy
woman she now thinks herself? Yet I
own there is something in Mr. Faulk∣land's
conduct which has raised my esteem
to admiration. Oh may his future days
be blessed, else shall I indeed be wretched!</P>
<P>My mother told Miss Burchell, it would
give her inexpressible satisfaction, to be∣stow
her in marriage on Mr. Faulkland;
and desired she would let her know to∣morrow
at what time, and place the cere∣mony
was to be performed. She answer∣ed,
at her own house, as she could be
no where else so private; and that Mr.
Faulkland would engage for the purpose
a clergyman, a particular friend of his,
and fellow-collegian, on whose discretion
he could rely.</P>
<P>Miss Burchell's spirits were too much
exhilarated to let her think of rest;
she staid with us till it was very late,
and having taken occasion to mention how
grieved she was at the thoughts of losing
my society, and of the necessity Mr. Faulk∣land
expressed himself under of never
seeing me more, my mother took that
opportunity of gravely entering into the
subject of matrimonial duties. She high∣ly
applauded Mr. Faulkland's resolution
on that head, and told Miss Burchell, it
ought exceedingly to enhance his merit
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
towards her. Let this be a memoran∣dum
to you, my dear Madam, said she,
how sacred the bond is to be held that
is now going to unite you: He will not,
you see, run the hazard of being tempt∣ed,
even in thought, to swerve from that
faith which he is going to plight to you;
your situation is delicate, and it will re∣quire
the utmost prudence and circumspec∣tion
on your part, to secure such an in∣terest
in his heart as he now seems in∣clined
to give you. It is not on your
personal charms that you are to rely, for
subduing, or preserving the affections of
such a man as he is. They alone, you
see, were not able to effect this; it is to
Mr. Faulkland's honour rather than his
love, that you are now obliged for the
justice he has done you: never let this
be out of your thoughts; be grateful,
but let your gratitude have dignity in it;
and by your behaviour convince your
husband that honour was with you a first
motive to wish this union, love will then
come in with a better grace as a secon∣dary
inducement.</P>
<P>The freedom of my mother's observa∣tions,
and instructions, I was not surpriz∣ed
at, because she always speaks her mind;
but the emphasis with which she deliver∣ed
herself was unusual. Miss Burchell ex∣pressed
herself as obliged to her, and
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
joined intirely in her opinion; I could per∣ceive
however she was not pleased with the
lecture.</P>
<P>When Miss Burchell was gone, my
mother told me, she thought it necessary
to speak as she had done. Miss Bur∣chell,
said she, is not <HI>quite</HI> the girl I took
her for; so much modesty and reserve, I
thought I never had met with in a
young creature before; when she used to
speak of Mr. Faulkland, it was with af∣fection
indeed, but with such a nice de∣corum
as convinced me of the inno∣cence
and purity of her heart. But of
late I have observed she has been less
delicate in her expressions of tenderness;
such passionate flights have sometimes
broke from her, as I did not think becom∣ing
in a young woman, and which indeed
almost offended me; and this night her
joy has been ungoverned. Great reason she
has for joy 'tis true; but there are some
considerations which ought to have made
her chasten that joy into a sober, and at
least seemingly, moderate satisfaction. She
loves Mr. Faulkland, but let her beware
of disgusting a man of his sense by too
strong an expression of her fondness.</P>
<P>My mother's observation, and her un∣commonly
forcible manner of expressing
it, struck me prodigiously. It is true I
had made the same remarks myself, but
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
as you know she is not extremely penetrat∣ing,
and in general but a superficial observer,
I was the more surprized at what she said.
Miss Burchell's behaviour must have been
formerly very different from what it now
is, to have made my mother so sensible of
the change. <HI>Some considerations,</HI> she said,
ought to have made her chasten her joy.
Perhaps, she meant no more than that the
young lady, even in the midst of that joy,
had, upon reflection, cause for humilia∣tion.
I hope, she did not think that her
gaiety on this desired event affected me,
who had so warmly promoted it. My
mother is too open not to give the full
meaning of her thoughts. This may be
only the suggestion of my own fancy, yet
it has mortified me. I had but little rest
last night, and rose this morning by day∣light,
to throw together in writing the
above particulars.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 27.—Miss Burchell came not to us
till late this evening; pleasure danced in
her eyes. I whispered to her, We rejoice
with you, dear Madam, sincerely rejoice,
at your approaching felicity; but our pre∣sent
state will not suffer us to keep pace
with you in that gaiety, however justifia∣ble
it may be from the cause: restrain
yourself a little; my mother will not think
you kind, as we are so soon to part with
you. She smiled, and thanking me for
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
the hint, immediately composed her fea∣tures
to such a decorum (I will not call it
demureness) that it was impossible to dis∣cover
she was agitated by any extraordi∣nary
emotion. I own, I was amazed at
the command she so suddenly assumed over
her countenance. I was glad, however,
she did so, that my mother might not
have fresh cause of dislike towards her.</P>
<P>She told us, that Mr. Faulkland had
settled a thousand pounds a year on her,
and that too without ever having inform∣ed
himself of the state of her fortune; for,
in the hurry of her thoughts, she had ne∣glected
to mention it to him: (Generous
man! whispered I to myself). She then,
with great gravity, applied herself to my
mother, and told her she hoped for the
honour of her presence, the next morn∣ing,
at her own house; where the cere∣mony
was to be performed, before no
other witnesses but her ladyship, and the
gentlewoman, who had been Mr. Faulk∣land's
housekeeper; and that the follow∣ing
day they puposed retiring to Mr.
Faulkland's seat in Hartfordshire, and after
a short stay there, to set out for Ireland.</P>
<P>My mother commended Mr. Faulk∣land's
diligence, for having so suddenly
disposed every thing for this important
event, and told our friend she would
not fail to attend her at the appointed time.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173"/>
Miss Burchell's behaviour was ex∣tremely
composed; she either really was,
or affected to be, extremely sorry at part∣ing
with me; she could not stay long
with us, she said, as she had many things
still to settle in the remaining part of
that evening. On taking leave of me,
I shall not see you again, worthiest of
women, said he, at least, for many
months; but my love, my respect, and
my gratitude towards you will be as
lasting as my life. You shall hear oft∣en
from me, and be so good as some∣times
to tell me I am not forgotten.
She embraced me with tears in her
eyes, but I thought she tripped down stairs
to her chair, as if her heart was very light.</P>
<P>My mother liked her deportment: she
said, she believed the flightiness of her
behaviour before, was owing to her be∣ing
quite intoxicated with the sudden∣ness
of her joy, on so unexpected a turn
of fortune; but that, since she had time
for recollection, she had recovered her
wonted bashful and sober air, with which
she used to be so delighted. My mo∣ther
says, she will contrive to carry a
rich white brocade gown with her, in
order to slip it on at Miss Burchell's
house; for she would not, on any con∣sideration,
appear in mourning on this
joyful occasion. You know the reverence
she has for omens.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174"/>
<HI>June</HI> 28.—The important event is
over, my Cecilia. Miss Burchell is now
Mrs. Faulkland. My mother is just
returned, and saw the nuptial knot tied.
The lady, she said, looked very lovely;
and it was easy to observe she gave
her hand with all her heart. Mr.
Faulkland's behaviour was polite and
unconstrained; but his attention to his
bride was more gallant than tender;
and his whole deportment was that of
a man who seemed to endeavour at
acquitting himself with a good grace of
an act of duty, rather than of inclination.
The latter part of the observation is
mine, not my mother's; but I collected
it from certain little particulars, which
she related to me in her own way,
without drawing any inference from them.</P>
<P>He thanked her in a most respectful
manner for the honour she had done
him, and for her former friendship to
Miss Burchell; but did not once men∣tion
my name. So much the better;
I hope he will forget me.</P>
<P>My mother is mighty alert on the
occasion, and felicitates both herself and
me on our having brought about this
very important affair. She joined hear∣tily
with me in praying that the new
married pair may be happy in each
other. She is quite reconciled to Mr.
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
Faulkland. What a pity it was, said
she—and stopped; then added, But
every thing is for the best. I under∣stood
her, but made no reply.</P>
<P>They go out of town to-morrow morn∣ing;
all happiness attend them!</P>
<P>I expect Sir George will be quite outra∣geous
about this marriage. My second
refusal of his friend, with the addition
of his now being wedded, through my
persuasion, to a woman my brother ne∣ver
could endure, will I fear exasperate
him beyond a possibility of reconciliation.
I cannot help it; I have acted agreeably
to the dictates of my duty; that must
be my consolation: life is in itself a war∣fare,
<HI>my</HI> life has been particularly so.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8th.—My mother is far from be∣ing
well; her spirits have been a little
heightened for these few days past, but
her disorder I see gains ground: the
swelling in her legs is returning, and
her rest at night quite broken. I am
hourly habituating myself to think of her
dissolution; or in other words, am pre∣paring
myself for the worst evil that can
now befal me. I hope I shall find myself
equal to the trial.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 10th—Here is a storm for you
my dear; a letter from Sir George. I
wanted such a thing to rouse me from
the almost lethargic dulness that was
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
creeping on me. Mr. Faulkland has ac∣quainted
him with his marriage. Pray
observe his brotherly address.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD, <DATE>July 6, 1706.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>“For I disclaim all relation to you.
I have just now had a letter from Faulk∣land,
wherein I am at once informed
of your having finally rejected him, and
of his being married to Miss Burchell.
As for the first, your own folly be on
your head. You will have time enough
for repentance, and I need wish you
no other punishment, than what <HI>will,</HI>
and for me <HI>shall,</HI> be the consequence
of your obstinate adherence to your
own romantick wild opinions. But
what in the name of blind infatua∣tion
could provoke you to urge the
man, to whom you owed such obliga∣tions,
to his destruction? <HI>You</HI> I know
have done it; he could not be so
mad but under <HI>your</HI> influence. You
and my mother I suppose fancy you
have done a righteous deed; but you
have done what I am afraid poor
Faulkland will have reason to—I
will suppress the shocking word, that
my indignation suggested.”</P>
<P>“Why was not I made acquainted
with this precious design of marrying
my friend to that insinuating little vi∣per?
I might perhaps have prevented
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
the mischief; for I cannot think if she
had not imposed upon you▪ that you
would have pushed your chimerical
notions of honour to such extremities.”</P>
<P>“Perhaps you meant well; but it
has ever been your peculiar misfor∣tune
I think, to have your good in∣tentions
productive of nothing but evil:
this last action I fear will be a severe
proof of the truth of this observation.
I warned you in time against this wo∣man,
but my advice has always been
despised.”</P>
<P>“I will say no more on the hateful
subject; what is done is irrevocable:
but I believe you will hardly be able
to answer it to yourself, if you find
that you have condemned one of the
noblest fellows in the world to the
arms of a prostitute.”</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Lord bless me! my Cecilia, was there
ever such a barbarian? with what an
implacable aversion does he pursue this
poor girl! But what does he mean by
the odious epithet with which he closes
his horrid letter? Sure Miss Burchell
merits not that name. Her weakness
in regard to Mr. Faulkland cannot bring
on her so detestable a charge. If George
knows any thing more of her character
than I do, why did he not tell me so
before? It cannot be; his aversion to
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
her makes him cruel and unjust. He
says true; I should not indeed forgive
myself if I were the means of making
Mr. Faulkland unhappy; and his obser∣vation
would be dreadfully verified, that
all my good intentions produce nothing
but evil, if this marriage should prove
to be unfortunate.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 20—I have had a letter from
Mrs. Faulkland. She and her husband
are arrived safely at his estate on the
borders of the north of Ireland, within
less than thirty miles of the capital. It
is a pleasant part of the country she says,
but as Mr. Faulkland has no house there,
they have taken up their lodgings, for
the present, at the house of his steward.
Her letter is filled with declarations of
the felicity she enjoys; she says she
would not change her lot to be the
greatest Queen on earth.—May she
continue to deserve her happy fortune,
and to render her husband as satisfied
with <HI>his</HI> lot as she is with <HI>hers!</HI> then
shall I triumph over Sir George for his
vile insinuations.</P>
<P>I have heard from my good Lady
V—, in answer to the letter I wrote
her, giving an account of Mr Faulk∣land's
marriage. As he had not made
her acquainted with his return to Eng∣land,
I knew not whether he had in∣formed
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
her of this particular; and I find
he had not. As Lady V—was a
stranger to his former connection with
Miss Burchell, (with whom I have already
told you she was acquainted, and that
she entertained a very favourable opinion
of her) she expressed no displeasure at the
alliance; but said, she supposed he mar∣ried
in a tifft, upon my refusal of him;
for which I gave her such reasons as
I had before given Mr. Faulkland, ex∣cepting,
those which related to Miss Bur∣chell;
which for both their sakes, must
now be no more mentioned. Lady V—
says, she <HI>will not condemn the delicacy of
my sentiments, though she owns her wish
was, that it could have been got over, as
she is sure that Mr. Faulkland can never
be happy with any one but me.</HI></P>
<P>[Here follows an interval of near two
months, in which nothing material oc∣curred]</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 13.—The time approaches,
my Cecilia, when thy friend shall be
poor and destitute. I know thy gene∣rous
heart will mere than sympathize
with me in my calamity, from the ag∣gravating
reflection that it is not in your
power to assist me. The account you
have given me of your husband's close
disposition has too fully convinced me
of this. Nor should I have mentioned
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
my apprehensions to you at this time,
but that I am bound not to conceal a
thought from the friend of my heart.</P>
<P>Sir George has dropt all correspon∣dence
with us, I have nothing to expect
from him; nor does that mortal live
(yourself excepted) to whom I would on
such an occasion be indebted. I have
already sighed too often under the weight
of obligations which I could not repay.</P>
<P>My mother is hastening apace towards
a better world. She sees her end approach∣ing
with such a calmness, such a truly pious
joy, as almost makes me ashamed of la∣menting
her loss; for what is it in me,
my dear, but selfishness? 'Tis true, the
loss of a tender parent, a faithful friend,
at a time when all other comforts of life
are fled, is an evil one would wish wholly
to avoid, or at least to postpone to the
longest date possible: but when I consi∣der
<HI>her</HI> welfare, ought I to indulge myself
in such a wish? Her life is already be∣come
a burden to her; her infirmities are
painful; and without hope of cure; she
longs to be released, and to receive that re∣ward
of her righteousness, which cannot
be obtained on this side of the grave.</P>
<P>If we had a friend, who in compas∣sion
to our wants or weakness, consen∣ted
to live with us, though under the
pressure of years and bodily pain; and
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
that friend were invited to a remote coun∣try,
with an assurance of recovering
health, of having youth renewed, and
of possessing all the riches, power, ho∣nours,
and accumulated pleasures that
this world can bestow; should we not
blush to own even a with to detain him
from such a station? what but a love
of ourselves, superior to that which we
bear to our friend, could suggest such a
thought? How much more to be desired
then is the change, to which my mother
looks forward, with an assured hope!</P>
<P>But there is something dismal in the idea
of death! 'Tis only our prejudices makes
it so. I have been endeavouring for ma∣ny
days past to familiarise it to my thoughts,
and to consider death only as the name
of a region through which my mother
is to pass, in order to get at that delightful
country to which she is invited, and whi∣ther
I shall assuredly follow her. Such is
the present frame of my mind; judge
then, my sister, if this philosophy will not
bear me up against the expected blow
when it falls upon me.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 15.—'Tis strange, my Ceci∣lia,
that this best of parents, who has al∣ways
so tenderly loved me, expresses now
not the least uneasiness at the forlorn con∣dition
in which she must soon leave me.
Her thoughts are employed on higher
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
objects, and she seems to have weaned
herself from all worldly attachments.</P>
<P>I am going from you, my daughter,
said she to me just now, and have no
other legacy to leave you but a pa∣rent's
blessing. Your brother possesses
all when I die; I wish you had the
means of enjoying life with comfort; but
you must be contented. See that you bear
your lot as becomes you. I perceive your
grief for the melancholy condition to which
I am reduced; but added she smiling, I
shall soon be released. Remember how
David behaved on the death of that son,
whose life he had so earnestly besought
of his Maker: let that serve you as an
example, not to give yourself up to
unprofitable sorrow. Bring up your chil∣dren
in the principles that I taught <HI>you,</HI>
and God will take care of them; for <HI>I
have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor
his seed begging their bread.</HI></P>
<P>She said, she found herself drowsy, and
desired me to leave her for a while. I have
left her, going I hope to get a little sleep;
she breaths with so much difficulty that she
cannot bear to lie down, and never gets
any rest but by snatches, as she sits in an
arm-chair supported by pillows.</P>
<P>How heavy and cast down do I feel my
spirits; but I know the worst—<HI>that</HI> is
something.—</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183"/>
It is all over: and my mother, blessed
woman! opens not her eyes again but to
a joyful resurrection. Oh, my dear, there
is no terror in death when he seizes us
not unprepared! I went into my mother's
chamber, in about half an hour after
I had quitted it, at her desire: I found
her leaning back in her chair, her eyes
shut, and a complacent air diffused over
her face, which made me hope that her
slumber was sweeter, and more profound
than usual. I sat down by her to contem∣pleat
her benign countenance; and was some
minutes before I discovered that she did
not breathe, I took her hand, she had no
pulse; and I soon found that the happy spi∣rit
had escaped from its house of clay. May
I die the death of the righteous, and my
latter end be like hers. No murmurings,
no, no my sister, I will be patience itself!</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 25.—I have sent the remains
of my venerable parent down to Sidney-Castle,
there to be interred with her
ancestors. I wrote my brother an account
of her death on the day it happened,
but have as yet received no answer. Un∣natural
son! but I will not reproach
him; some accident might have preven∣ted
his writing immediately on the re∣ceipt
of my letter. He never intirely
forsook the duty he owed his mother,
but he has of late been quite estranged
from us; his wife, vain, weak and impe∣rious,
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
governs him totally. I must now
begin to look about me for a place
of abode suited to my present circum∣stances.
My whole income would not
pay more than half the rent of these
lodgings in which I have lived with my
dear mother. My poor Patty! I am
grieved for <HI>her.</HI> I begged of her to
seek another mistress, who might be a∣ble
to reward her merit, and provide
for her as she deserves; but the
worthy affectionate girl told me, it
would break her heart, if I talked of
parting with her. You must have a Ser∣vant
of some sort, Madam, said she, why
may not I do as well as another? If I were
able to make you a proper return, Patty,
said I, you should not leave me, but I
cannot afford to pay a servant of your abi∣lities
as you deserve; and I must be my
own maid for the future. Never, never,
Madam, cried the honest creature, bursting
into tears, while I have hands to serve
you. Let me but attend on you, and the
two dear children; I desire nothing.—I
want nothing. Your goodness has all a∣long
supplied me so, that I am sure I
have cloaths enough to serve me during
my life, and if I could not put up with
the same humble way of living that my
mistress does, sure I should be a presumptu∣ous
wretch! My tears thanked the grate∣ful
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
girl; and taking her by the hand, I
told her, that I would not talk of par∣ting
for the present, but when any thing
worth her her acceptance offered, I should
then insist on her embracing it.</P>
<P>I am determined to retire to some
village at a distance from London, and
either to take a little cottage to myself,
or board with my children at some farm∣house,
as I shall find most convenient.
Fifty pounds a year will be but a slen∣der
support for three persons brought
up in affluence. My little ones indeed
will not now be sensible of the change,
and by the time they are grown up,
they will be so inured to their home∣ly
board, that they will not, I hope,
aspire after what cannot consistently (per∣haps)
with virtue, lie within their reach.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 27.—After paying the ex∣pences
of my mother's funeral, dis∣charging
our lodgings, and some other
demands, I find my purse will be so
extremely reduced, that I shall have but
barely enough to keep out want, till
my small income becomes due to me.
I must therefore, for the present, de∣fer
putting my scheme into executi∣on,
as I am not qualified to under∣take
a journey with my little family;
especially as I am as yet uncertain what
place to fix on for my residence; nei∣ther
will I afford my brother (though
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
I have no reason to expect any thing
from him) a farther pretence of re∣proaching
me, by giving him room to
say, I left London without consulting
him, or waiting for his return to it.
I shall therefore look out for a lodg∣ing
of a small price, where I will con∣ceal
myself from every body that knows
me, and wait for Sir George's arrival.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 28.—How happy you make
me, my ever dear friend, by your
approbation of my conduct, since my
receiving your last packet, which came
to my hands late last night, I am bet∣ter
reconciled to my present lot than
I was before I heard from you. I
<HI>could not do otherwise,</HI> you say, after
my solemn promise given to Miss Bur∣chell,
than use my utmost endeavours
to promote her marriage with Mr. Faulk∣land.
True; I could not: but I wish
you had entered more into my senti∣ments,
in regard to those punctilios,
which, you tell me, you think <HI>might</HI>
have been got over, if that young
woman had been out of the question.
I could not help smiling at your wish,
unchristian as it was; but my dear,
if that <HI>were</HI> to happen, do you think
Mr. Faulkland so void of reason, nay
of feeling, as after all that has past
to persevere? Or if he did, that I
could be so mean as to owe the very
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>
bread that I and my children should
eat, to his generosity? Would you,
my Cecilia, wish to see your friend so
humbled? 'Tis not in the power even
of the cold, hard hand of poverty it∣self,
to dash me so low as that would
do. But where is the need of forming
resolutions or even making declarations
about what never <HI>can</HI> happen? I see
notwithstanding, that you think my
heart has <HI>again</HI> done itself some vio∣lence:
You know that heart too well
for me to attempt to hide from you
its secret workings. I own to you honest∣ly
I now feel my own unhappiness in
its full extent. I look back and take a
survey of the past, and cannot help think∣ing
that I have had the most wayward
fate allotted me that ever woman had.</P>
<P>Disappointment in a first love, has, I
think, been ever accounted a grief scarce
surmountable even by time: but this can
only be the case, where the heart, extremely
vulnerable by nature (like Miss Burchell's)
suffers itself to be so intirely immersed in that
passion, that all the other duties of life are
swallowed up in it; and where an indolent
turn of mind, a want of rational avo∣cations,
and perhaps of a new object,
all contribute to indulge and confirm
the disease. This you know was not my
case. I loved, 'tis true; but it was
with temperance; and though my dis∣appointment
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
afflicted me, it did not
subdue me. I got the better of it, I
think I got the better of it even be∣fore
I married; but sure I am, I to∣tally
conquered all remembrance of it
after I became a wife. I then laid down
a new scheme of happiness, and was for
a time in possession of it; how I was
thrown from this is still bitter to remem∣brance.
You well know what I suffer∣ed,
when I found myself deprived of
my husband's love, and suspected of a
crime at which my soul shrunk. But
it pleased the just God to deliver me
from this heavy misfortune, and I think
the happiest days of my marriage were
those which I passed with Mr. Arnold
after our re-union. Then it was, I was
thoroughly sensible that the heart <HI>can</HI>
love a second time, truly and ardent∣ly;
but I was soon again plunged in∣to
affliction by the death of a husband
endeared to me more than ever by his
misfortunes. My grief for him was
proportionate to my love. Yet, my
friend, as time is an universal conque∣ror,
it might have healed this wound
as well as the former one; and a few,
a very few years would perhaps have
disposed me to return Mr. Faulkland's
still unabated passion, if a variety of
circumstances had not interposed, that
strongly forbad our union. Convinced
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
as I was of this, I acted agreeably to
the dictates both of my reason, and
my conscience, in persuading Mr.
Faulkland to make Miss Burchell his
wife. I should have been grieved and
mortified had he rejected her, and I
had determined never to have seen
him more. Yet how deceitful is the
human heart! this very act which I la∣boured
with so much assiduity to accom∣plish,
and on the accomplishment of
which, I had founded, I know not how,
a sort of contentment for myself, has been
the very means of destroying what little
peace of mind I was beginning to
taste before. Sure that man was born
to torment me in a variety of ways!
If I was disappointed in my early love,
I had however duty, and a consciousness
of what I then thought superior worth,
to support me. If on his account I
suffered cruel and injurious aspersions,
the innocence of my own self-acquitted
heart bore me up under it: but he
has at length found the way to pu∣nish
me without leaving me any re∣source.
My pride is of no use, he has
raised himself in my esteem superior
to every thing. His whole behaviour
so generous, so candid; a love so disin∣terested,
so fervent; what noble, what
uncommon proofs has he given me
of it! and at length what a triumph∣ant
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
sacrifice has he made of that
over-ruling passion, to the sober calls
of reason and humanity! He has left
me, my dear, to gaze after him
with grateful admiration! and some∣times
perhaps to sigh that our fates
rendered it impossible for us to meet.
But if I do sometimes sigh, it is not
at the advantages of fortune, which I
might have enjoyed with him; no,
no, surrounded as I am with distress,
I do not envy Miss Burchell's afflu∣ence
or splendor. If <HI>that</HI> motive could
have had weight with me, I might have
been mean enough not to have acted
as I have done. 'Tis the qualities of
the man's mind I esteem; I think our
souls have something congenial in them,
and that we were originally designed
for each other. And if I believed the
doctrine which teaches us, that there are lit∣tle
officious spirits that preside over the
actions of men, I should think that our
two evil geniuses laid their heads toge∣ther
in conjunction with Miss Burchell's
active demon, to thwart and cross all our
measures.</P>
<P>I have nothing now left but to pray for
the happiness of one whose lot in this life
he has suffered <HI>me</HI> to determine; and to be∣seech
Heaven that he may never stand in
that fatal predicament which Sir George,
with such outrageous barbarity, marked
out in his vile letter.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191"/>
I now return to myself, and to my pre∣sent
state; which I think I may say brings
up the rear of my misfortunes. Let the
chastisement stop here, and I shall bow me
to it with resignation.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 29.—Ah, my Cecilia, what
an aggravation is here to the already too
deep regret I began to feel on Mr. Faulk∣land's
account! His triumph over me is
now complete!</P>
<P>In sorting my mother's papers (as I am
to leave these lodgings to-morrow) I found
that letter which Mr. Faulkland wrote
to my brother from Bath. You may re∣member
I told you my mother had, in her
resentment, flung it to Sir George, and
that, as it happened to fall on the ground,
he had quitted the room in a passion with∣out
taking it up. My mother, I suppose,
when she cooled, laid it by, though I dare
say she never looked into it afterwards.
Read it, and see by what a fatality we
have been governed.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mr. Faulkland's letter to Sir G. Bidulph.
<DATELINE>Bath, <DATE>May 9, 1703.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>“How you mortify me, my dear Bi∣dulph,
when you tell me of the happi∣ness
I lose by staying so long at Bath!
<HI>The ladies are impatient to see me,</HI> say you?
Ah! Sir George, thou hast spoke better
of me than I deserve, I fear.”</P>
<P>“I am sadly out of humour with my∣self
at present. I have got into a very
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
foolish sort of scrape here. My wrist is
quite well, and I should have thrown
myself at Miss Bidulph's feet before now,
but to tell you a secret, my virtue not
being proof against temptation, I have
been intercepted.”</P>
<P>“'Tis but a slight lapse, however, a fly∣ing
affair; neither my honour, nor my
heart in the question. A little vagrant
Cupid has contented himself with pick∣ing
my pocket, just lightly fluttering
through my breast, and away.”</P>
<P>“Are you fallen so low as that, Faulk∣land,
say you? to <HI>buy</HI> the favour of the
fair, No, George, no; not quite so con∣temptible
as that neither: and yet,
faith, I did <HI>buy</HI> it too, for it cost me
three hundred pounds; but the lady to
whom I am obliged knows nothing of
this part of her own history; at least, I
hope so, for my credit sake. The case
in short is this: an old gouty officer, and
his wife, (a very notable dame; a fine
woman too) happened to lodge in the
same house with me. The man came
hither to get rid of his aches; the lady
of her money, and her virtue, if she has
any, for she is eternally at the card tables.”</P>
<P>“Under the conduct of this hopeful
guide, came a niece of the husband's;
an extremely fine girl, innocent too, I
believe, and the best dancer I ever saw. I
don't know how it happened, but she
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
took a fancy to me, which, upon my
word, and I am sure you have no doubts
of me, I was far from wishing to improve.
You know I always despised the mean
triumph of gaining a heart, for which I
could not give another in return. I saw
with pain her growing inclination for
me, but as we lived in the same house,
and met every day in the rooms, it was
impossible for me to avoid her as much
as I wished to do. The aunt I found,
had her eye upon me, and took some
pains to promote a liking on my side. I
saw her design, and was so much upon
my guard, that she, who I soon found
was an adept in love matters, almost de∣spaired
of gaining her ends. The young
lady's inclination however seemed to in∣crease;
a pair of fine blue eyes told me
so every day; and I was upon the point
of flying to avoid the soft contagion,
when an accident happened that totally
overthrew all my good resolutions.”</P>
<P>“I had not seen the young lady for two
or three days; I enquired for her, and
her aunt answered, with a mysterious
smile, She is ill, poor thing, why don't
you look in upon her, and ask her
how she does? I replied, if the lady
will permit me, I will do myself that
honour, and intended literally to have
kept my word, by just asking her at her
chamber door how she did.”</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194"/>
“You are very cruel, said the aunt;
would you persuade me that you don't know
the girl is in love with you? O, your Ser∣vant,
Madam; if you think me vain, I
thank you for the reprimand. Come, come,
said she, this is all affectation, we'll drink
tea with her this evening. Upon my word,
said I, if I am to believe what you say, I
think you ought not to desire me. I am
not blind to the young lady's merit, but
am so unfortunate as not to have it in my
power to make such returns as she deserves.
I found the occasion required my being se∣rious.”</P>
<P>“If you have not love, said she, you may at
least have a little complaisance. Was there
ever such a barbarian, not to go and see a
woman that is dying for him? I promised
to bring you, and she expects you. What
is the pretty creature afraid of (patting my
cheek) I'll stay by it all the while. There
was no withstanding this; I promised to
wait on her.”</P>
<P>“She knocked at my door about six o'clock,
and, looking in, asked if the coy Narcissus
was ready? I went with her, and she led
me directly to her niece's chamber. The
young lady looked pale and languishing,
but very pretty. I was really grieved to
see her, and enquired, with an unaffected
concern after her health. The tea-things
were set, and I tried to force something
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
like conversation, but I believe I was rather
formal.”</P>
<P>“When we had done tea, the aunt looked
at her watch, started off her chair, said she
had outstaid her appointment with the par∣ty
she was to meet at cards, and turning to
me, I hope, Sir, you will have the <HI>Charity</HI>
to stay with my niece; and then hurried
out of the room. I begged leave to hand
her to her chair, intending to take that op∣portunity
of slipping away, and resolved
to quit the house the next morning. But
the determined gipsey was prepared for this
motion, and insisting that I should not stir,
thrust me back from the door, which she
shut, and flew down stairs.”</P>
<P>“What was to become of me now, George?
my situation was dangerous, and really cri∣tical.
To be short, I forgot my prudence,
and found the young lady's heart too, too
tender.”</P>
<P>“I never felt remorse before. I never had
cause. I accuse myself of indiscretion, but
I have not the aggravating addition to my
fault of oaths and promises to fly in my face.
I made none—love, foolish love did all,
and led a willing victim to his altar, who
asked nothing in return for the sacrifice she
offered; and received nothing but unavail∣ing
repentance on my side.”</P>
<P>“I know not any thing now that would
give me so much pleasure as to find that
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
the girl hated me heartily, though I have
given her no cause.”</P>
<P>“A just reparation I cannot make her.
Every thing forbids that thought. I do
not consider myself as free; but if I were
so, I am not a seducer, and therefore do
not think myself bound to carry my peni∣tence
to such lengths. The damned aunt
has been the serpent. And here let me ex∣plain
to you what I called buying the lady's
favour. You must know, the aunt one
night, (the greatest part of which she had
spent at hazard) lost two hundred pounds;
at least she told me so the next morning,
and with tears in her eyes besought me, in
the most earnest manner, to lend her that
sum. She said, she should be undone if
her husband were to know it, and that she
would pay me in a very few days, as she
had as much due to her from different peo∣ple
who had lost to her at play. Though
our short acquaintance could hardly warrant
her making such a request, I nevertheless
did not hesitate, but gave her the money
directly. She meant indeed to pay me,
but it was in a different coin, and this I sup∣pose
was the price she set on the unhappy
girl's honour.”</P>
<P>“My reflections on this unlucky affair make
me very grave. I have explained my situ∣ation
to the young lady, and expressed my
concern at not having it in my power to be
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
any other than a friend to her. She blames
her own weakness, and her aunt's conduct,
but does not reproach me. She cannot with
justice, yet I wish she would, for then I
should reproach myself less.”</P>
<P>“'Tis a foolish business, and I must get
off as handsomely as I can. Prithee, Bi∣dulph,
say something to encourage me, and
put me into more favour with myself. You
have often been my confessor, but I never
wanted absolution so much as now; nor
ever was so well intitled to it, for I am really
full of penitence, and look <HI>so</HI> mortified,
you would pity me. I am ashamed of
having been surprised into a folly; I who
<HI>ought</HI> to have been upon my guard, know∣ing
the natural impetuosity of my own
temper.”</P>
<P>“I must not conclude without telling you,
that this very morning, the precious aunt,
instead of paying me the two hundred
pounds she had of me before, very mo∣destly
requested I would oblige her with
another hundred, to redeem a pair of dia∣mond
ear-rings which she had been obli∣ged
to part with for the supply of some
other necessary demands; and with abun∣dance
of smooth speeches, she assured me,
in a fortnight she would pay me all to∣gether,
having notes to that value, which
would then become due to her. I was
such a booby as to give it her—Why, fare
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
it well—I never expect to see a shilling of
it. She thinks, perhaps, there is value
received for it. Vile woman! The affair,
fortunately for us all, has not taken wind;
and for me, the names of both aunt and
niece, may ever stand enrolled amongst
those of chaste matrons and virgins. The
family quits this place soon, as the old gen∣tleman
is better.”</P>
<P>“I thank you for your care, in relation to
my house. I hope to take possession of it in
a weak or ten days; you are very good in
fixing me so near yourself. Adieu.”</P>
<CLOSER>“I am, &amp;c.”</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>What do you think of this letter, my Ce∣cilia,
written in confidence to my brother?
Mr. Faulkland could not conceive it pro∣bable
that any body but Sir George should
ever see it; he had no reason therefore to
gloss over any of the circumstances. <HI>Had</HI>
I seen it but in time—Oh, what anguish of
heart might we all have been spared! Miss
Burchell singly, as she <HI>ought,</HI> would have
borne the punishment of her folly.</P>
<P>My mother had not patience to read this
letter through; nice and punctilious as her
virtue was, she passed a censure on the crime
in gross, without admitting any palliating
circumstance. But I blame her not; the
excellence of her own morals, made her scru∣pulous
in weighing those of others; she
read the letter in a cursory way, and it is
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
plain but half of it; prepossessed as she was
before by knowing the material point.</P>
<P>The account was given with levity at the
<HI>first</HI> mention of the young lady. Then she
understood he had <HI>bought</HI> her of her aunt;
there is a paragraph which <HI>looks</HI> like it, and
to be sure she attended not to the explana∣tion.
Fatal oversight! she read not far
enough to have this matter cleared up. She
took nothing but the bare facts into her ac∣count.
A young lady dishonoured, her dis∣grace
likely to be public, then her tenderness
for the man who had undone her, and that
man rejecting her, and on the point of mar∣rying
another. These were the only points
of view in which my mother beheld the story.
Her justice, her humanity, and her religion
prempted her to act as she did; and her
conduct stands fully acquitted to judgment,
tho' my heart must, upon this full conviction
of Mr. Faulkland's honour, sigh at recollect∣ing
the past.</P>
<P>I know that the memory of my mother's
own first disastrous love wrought strongly on
her mind. She was warm in her passions,
liable to deep impressions, and always ad∣hered
strictly to those opinions she first im∣bibed.
Her education had been severe and
recluse; and she had drawn all her ideas of
mankind from her own father and mine, who
I have been told, were both men of exem∣plary
lives. From all these considerations, I
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
must again say, that I entirely acquit my
dear mother, in regard to her whole con∣duct,
however I have suffered by it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 30.—I am now fixed in a very
humble habitation. Shall I own it to you,
my Cecilia? I was shocked at the change.
A room two pair of stairs high, with a closet,
and a small indifferent parlour, compose the
whole of my apartment. Hither did my
faithful Patty, my two children, and myself,
remove this day. It put us not to much
trouble, having nothing to take with us but
our wearing apparel, which is all the world∣ly
goods of which I am now possessed.</P>
<P>When I wrote to Lady V—, (which was
a day or two before my mother's death) I
mentioned not that she was then in so dan∣gerous
a way. I know the generosity and
good nature of that worthy woman; but I
have already been too much obliged to her
to lay any fresh tax on her friendship, which
I am sure she would too readily pay, if she
were acquainted with my situation. I shall
therefore, as long as I can, defer acquaint∣ing
her with my mother's death; and when
I do, I shall not give her room to suspect that
my brother has cast me off, which I have
now too much reason to believe he has;
otherwise sure, in more than a fortnight, he
might have found time to write to me, I
neither expect ceremony nor tenderness from
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
him; but the occasion of my letter demand∣ed
some notice.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 2.—Patty has just now been in∣formed,
that Lady Sarah Bidulph is arrived
in town. She met one of their servants, who
told her that my brother is not come with
her; it seems, they parted on the road. He
is gone to Sidney Castle, which is now his,
and Lady Sarah chose to come to London.
She has, I find, been in London four days,
though she has not yet vouchsafed to send
me any notice of her arrival. She could not
be at a loss where to find me, as I left my
direction at my former lodging, in case of
any letter, or message, coming from any of
my friends; though I desired the people of
the house, not to inform any indifferent vi∣sitants
where I was to be found.</P>
<P>Though George has, in his turbulent way,
renounced me, as his sister, yet sure his wife,
whom I never disobliged, ought not to de∣part
so from humanity and common good
breeding, as not to enquire after the sister
of her husband, who has an occasion of
grief so recent, in which she ought to
partake. I shall not however take notice
of this slight, but am preparing to send
Patty to her, with an enquiry after her health,
and to know when my brother is expected
in town.—</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="202"/>
Patty is just returned from her embassy to
Lady Sarah; I will give you the conversation
she had with her.</P>
<P>Patty sent in her message, with great
respect, by a footman, and waited for her
answer in the hall; though her pretty figure
and genteel mourning dress had induced the
servant to ask her into the house-keeper's
room.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah was alone in the parlour, and
desired her to be called to the door. So,
young woman, said she, your mistress de∣sires
to know when Sir George will be in
town. I am really surprised, after the letter
she received from him, that she can fancy
Sir George means to concern himself about
her. Do you know her business with him?
You are in your mistress's secrets, I suppose.
I do not know, Madam, answered Patty,
what particular business my lady may have;
but I believe it would be a comfort to her,
to see her brother in her present melancholy
circumstances. I don't know that there is
any thing uncommonly melancholy in her
circumstances, replied the lady; her mo∣ther's
years and infirmities made her death
a thing to be looked for; I suppose your
mistress is not in <HI>want.</HI> My poor inge∣nuous
Patty said, she blushed at the cruel
indifference with which Lady Sarah spoke
this. Not in immediate want, Madam, I
hope; but your ladyship must needs think
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
she is in a destitute way, with two child∣ren,
and but fifty pounds a year in the
world. What do you mean, woman, cried
Lady Sarah? it is impossible but Lady Bi∣dulph
must have left money behind her;
Sir George, I am sure, has got nothing but
what she could not keep from him. Patty
answered, Lady Bidulph, Madam, left no
money behind her more than what was
barely sufficient to defray some necessary
expences that occurred immediately after
her death. Well, and so your mistress, I
suppose, after having behaved so ill as she
has done to her brother, expects he should
provide handsomely for her, and her child∣ren;
<HI>Arnold</HI>'s children, for the rest of their
lives. I know not, Madam, returned Patty,
what my lady's expectations are, but I be∣lieve
she would be very glad to see Sir George
before she goes out of town, or at least in∣form
him of her design. What <HI>is</HI> her de∣sign,
pray? asked Lady Sarah. To retire
into the country, Madam, as she has not
wherewithal to subsist on in London. She
can't do better, I think, said the Lady.
Where does she live now? My poor maid,
who thought this question tended to the
proud woman's calling on, or at least send∣ing
to me, made haste to inform her; she
lodges, Madam, at a milliner's, at the cor∣ner
of the Hay-market, the left hand as you
turn—Oh dear! pray stop: you need not
<PB N="203" REF="204"/>
be so particular, I have no design of paying
her a visit in her corner-shop; my only rea∣son
for enquiring was, to know whether she
had thought proper to keep those expensive
lodgings her mother was in, in expectation
of Sir George's continuing <HI>her</HI> in them. My
Lady has no such view, I believe, Madam.
Well, you may tell your <HI>Lady,</HI> that if she
will go out of town with her children, I will
endeavour to prevail on Sir George to allow
her something. He will pot be in town this
month, so that she need not wait for his ar∣rival.
She might, if she would have been
guided by her brother, have been a credit
to her friends, instead of what she now is.
Patty owns, she was so full of indignation,
that she wished at that moment not to have
been a servant, that she might have reproach∣ed
her with her hard-heartedness. Oh, my
dear, these are the stings of poverty! It is
not the hard bed, nor the homely board, but
the oppressive insolence of proud prosperity;
'tis that only which can inflict a wound on
the ingenuous mind.</P>
<P>As for that mean woman, I despise her
too much to suffer myself to be obliged to
her. <HI>She will endeavour to prevail on my bro∣ther.</HI>
If his own heart cannot prevail on
him, I disclaim her influence; I know she
means not to use it in my favour; on the
contrary, I make no doubt but she will en∣deavour
to irritate Sir George against me by
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
misrepresentations. Her pride makes her
wish to have an indigent relation out of the
way, yet her avarice would not suffer her to
enable me to retire; and she will make my
continuing here through necessity, a pre∣tence
for still with-holding any assistance from
me. Let it be so; I would rather submit to
the most abject drudgery, than owe a wretch∣ed
dependant existence to such a woman. I
am sure my brother, notwithstanding his re∣sentment,
if he knew what my situation
truly is, would not behave with cruelty; but
my mind is not become so sordid, fallen as I
am, as to turn petitioner for relief. But no
more, my Cecilia, let not my fate interrupt
your happiness.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 4th.—I have had a letter from
Mrs. Faulkland, filled with the overflowings
of a joyful heart. She says, Mr. Faulkland
is so delighted with the country he is in, and
finds his estate capable of such vast improve∣ment,
that he thinks of making a longer
residence there than he at first intended:
the rather, as he has some suspicions that his
agent has not acted faithfully by him; and
as he is sure the extensive plan, that he has
now laid down, will be better executed un∣der
his own eye. He purposes building a
little convenient lodge on a very charming
spot in the center of his estate, where he
may reside whilst his works are carrying on;
so that Mrs. Faulkland promises herself
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
much pleasure, in spending her time partly
there and partly in Dublin. She has alrea∣dy
made a large circle of acquaintance, and
bestows high encomiums on the great po∣liteness
and hospitality with which they are
received by all the fashionable people in the
county.</P>
<P>She knows not of my mother's death; yet
in my answer to her letter, I cannot avoid
mentioning it. Though I could wish for
obvious reasons to conceal it. Mr. Faulk∣land
well knows the ruin of our fortune;
and though he cannot suppose, while I have
a brother living, that I am driven to such
straights, yet I know what his liberal heart
may suggest to him on this occasion, which
might lay me under fresh difficulties.</P>
<P>I have but just now apprised Lady V—of
the decease of my dear mother, but have not
insinuated any other grief than the loss of a
tender parent, and an agreeable companion.
Indeed I have carried my dissimulation so far,
as not to desire this lady to change her ad∣dress
to me, lest, if I gave her my present
direction, she might be led to think, neces∣sity
had obliged me to change my former
lodgings for worse. I shall use the same pre∣caution
towards Mrs. Faulkland, as I have
obtained permission from the gentlewoman,
whose house I lately left, to have my letters
sent thither: when I go into the country, a
general direction to the post-house may suf∣fice.
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
I shall now look out for some little
spot to retire to, where I can support life on
the cheapest terms. In two months I shall
have my small pittance due to me, which I
reserve to carry me out of town, and to set∣tle
me in my new scheme of oeconomy in
the country. If I could persuade my poor
Patty to quit me, and see her settled in some
eligible situation, I should then have no ma∣terial
concern to attend to, but the bringing
up my children in the paths of virtue and
humility. Humility, that happy frame of
mind, on which so much of our temporal as
well as our eternal welfare depends.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 9th.—Who shall say, now is the
measure of my griefs complete: Providence,
thou canst inflict no more! O my sister! in
the midst of other sorrows, I thought not of
one that still remained behind; my children,
my two little angels! both dangerously ill.
The small-pox is their distemper, and of the
worst kind. The disease has been hanging
over them for some days, and my close at∣tendance
on them, prevented me from using
my pen. The cruel distemper now appears
with the most malignant symptoms. The
eldest always slept with me; I have resigned
my bed to her for these three last nights, and
have watched by her. Patty has done the
same by the youngest. A humane and skil∣ful
physician attends them, but my reliance
rests not on him.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208"/>
<HI>October</HI> 12th.—Three days and nights of
sorrowful anxiety have at length produced a
little comfort to me. The distemper has
now reached one crisis, whence the physician
can form a judgment with some degree of
certainty, and he bids me hope. Oh if it
were not for that healing word, how could
the wretched drag on existence from day
to day? I do, I will hope, for there is a
merciful providence that superintends his
works.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 21.—Thank God! thank God!
my Cecilia, the dear babes are out of dan∣ger.
Fifteen melancholy days and nights
has their disconsolate mother watched by
the poor little sufferers; but I am fully re∣paid
by having them restored to my pray∣ers.
They are now able to sit up, and
open their pretty eyes which had been closed
for many days; and to add to my satisfaction
I think they will not be marked: but they
are still so feeble that it will be at least ano∣ther
fortnight, before I can think of venturing
their little tender frames out of doors.</P>
<P>The physician's care and diligence deserv∣ed
a greater recompence than I had it in my
power to make him; however what I have
done has reduced me to a single guinea.
But this affects me not; I shall make no
difficulty of parting with some of my now
unnecessary fineries, which neither I nor my
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
children probably will ever again have any
pretensions to wear.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 22.—I have felt the wounds of
grief, the pangs of disappointment, and the
smart of indignation; yet was my heart never
more sensibly affected than it was just now,
by a circumstance proceeding from a cause
very different from all these. I had taken
out of my drawers a few superfluous orna∣ments,
which I desired Patty to dispose of as
if they were her own, to the woman where
we lodge; being things in her own way of
business. The poor girl looked at me for
some time with a grief in her countenance
that pierced me to the soul. There is no
need, Madam, said she, with her voice almost
stifled, there is no need I hope as yet for
this. You don't consider, Patty, said I, that
the children's weak condition requires now a
more than ordinary attention to their diet;
and I have not sufficient to supply them long
with such necessaries as they want. I have
no occasion for these trifles, and I cannot see
my little ones droop for want of such com∣fortable
nourishment as may restore them to
their strength. Nor shall they want it, Ma∣dam,
answered Patty; don't be angry with
me, Madam, if I beg you will let me use my
endeavours to supply them. What do you
mean, said I, I know the goodness of your
disposition, but how have you it in your
power? You know, Madam, said she, I am
<PB N="209" REF="210"/>
pretty expert at my needle; and as our land∣lady
has always abundance of work on her
hands, I undertook to assist her, and have
for this fortnight past, while I was closely
confined to miss's room, finished a piece of
curious work, for which she has this day paid
me thirty shillings. You amaze me, said I,
I never saw you employed otherwise than in
your attendance on the child. I was afraid
you would be displeased, Madam, she replied,
and always hid my work when you came in∣to
the room, which I could easily do, as it
was only a fine piece of point which I was
grounding; and as I sat up night and day,
I had an opportunity of sticking almost con∣stantly
to it, which enabled me to do in a
fortnight, what to another hand would be a
month's, labour. Now, Madam, with your
leave, I can go on in this manner; and though
perhaps I cannot always earn so much, yet I
am sure I can still procure enough to prevent
your being drove to the necessity of parting
with your apparel, till we are in a condition
to leave such an expensive place as London
is. And do you think, my dear Patty, said
I, with tears of affection and gratitude in
my eyes, that I will consent to take the fruits
of your ingenious and honest industry from
you? no, no, if you can find time by these
means to procure a little supply for your own
pocket, do so; but I will not suffer you to
expend a farthing of what you can earn, on
<PB N="210" REF="211"/>
my account. I saw she looked distressed and
confounded; excuse me, madam, said she,
but I have made bold to lay out part of the
money already; I thought the poor children
would want a little wine to nourish them,
and indeed, Madam, your spirits want
some support after your long fatigue. I
have bought a few bottles of wine, Madam,
and some other little necessaries, I hope you
will not take it ill.</P>
<P>I pressed the affectionate creature's hand;
I cannot be angry with you, Patty, for your
goodness, but such proofs of it as these di∣stress
me more than my wants could. I ac∣cept
of your kindness for this time, but insist
on your not doing such a thing again. If
there be occasion for it, I can apply to my
needle as well as you, and would sooner do
so, than part with any of my things, since it
gives you so much uneasiness.</P>
<P>The poor girl was rejoiced at my accep∣tance
of her friendly and tender offer, and pro∣duced
her little purchase, which was indeed
both seasonable and useful.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 23. I had this day a letter from
Lady V—. I send you a copy of it.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>“I condole with you, my dear Mrs. Ar∣nold,
on the afflicting loss you sustained in
your good mother's death. You mention
not any particular consequences from this
accident; but I know, that by Lady Bi∣dulph's
death, you are deprived of a con∣siderable
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
part of your income, and on this
account I have taken the liberty of friend∣ship,
to send you a supply, which your fa∣mily
calls may require, till your affairs are
settled upon a better footing.”</P>
<P>“Let me know how you and your brother
stand; if he should not be so kind to you
as he ought, I insist upon your looking on
me as your banker, who know not how to
make so good a use of my income, as shar∣ing
it with those I love as I do you.”</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The supply which Lady V.—mentioned,
accompanied this letter, and was a bank bill
of three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>I own to you, my Cecilia, that my first
emotions were only those of joy, surprize, and
gratitude, for so unexpected and important a
donation; but when those were a little sub∣sided,
I began to reflect on the nature, and
manner of this noble act of friendship. I
know Lady V—is one of the best women
living; that she is generous, and compassionate,
and has always honoured me with a particu∣lar
regard; yet I must confess to you, her
present now comes to me suspected. I believe
I told you, that Lady V—had retired into
Lancashire, to live with an only sister she has
there: this Lady is a widow, and I have since
been informed, was left with a very nume∣rous
young family, and an income scarce suf∣ficient
to support them genteelly; they are
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
now most of them grown up, and all the
girls, of which there are five, unprovided for.
Since Lady V—'s departure, I have been
told, that it was principally on account of
these young girls, of whom she is extremely
fond, that she went to reside with her sister,
in order to to support them more agreeably to
their rank; their father having been a gene∣ral
officer, and a man of high birth. Lady
V'—s jointure is a thousand pounds a year;
but as I hear the family make a respectable
figure in the country, and I am sure Lady
V—'s fondness for her nieces, would induce
her to save what she could, in order to leave
them something at her death, I cannot recon∣cile
it to her prudence, notwithstanding the
liberality of her Spirit, and the friendship she
has for me, that she should make so con∣siderable
a present, and at the same time give
me as it were an unbounded letter of credit
on her. Had she sent me the sixth part of
the sum, I should not have doubted its being
only the effects of her kindness towards me;
and in her present situation, as considerable
a proof of it, as she ought in regard to her
family, to have given to one whom she has
already bound under strong obligations.
But the largeness of the sum renders it sus∣picious;
and to tell you the secret inspira∣tions
of my heart, I fear it comes from a dif∣ferent
quarter.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="214"/>
I made Mrs. Faulkland acquainted with
my mother's death, about the same time that
I informed Lady V—of it. To neither did
I give the most distant hint of my circum∣stances,
yet Mr. Faulkland knows they can∣not
be happy. He too knows better than
any body, how far Sir George's resentment
may carry him. Is it not natural then, my
dear, to imagine that this man, who is ge∣nerosity
itself, should have taken this method
of making Lady V—the channel through
which he conveys his liberality? I am sure it
must be so. It is three weeks since Lady V—
had the notice of my mother's death; Why
thought she not sooner of reaching out her
supporting hand, if she imagined I stood in
need of it? I gave her no cause to believe I
did; otherwise I make no question of her
ready friendship, as far as her abilities would
go: but <HI>she</HI> could not know as well as Mr.
Faulkland, how much my brother was exas∣perated
against me, and therefore could not
suppose me to be as destitute as I really am.
She desires to know how my brother and I
stand. This question is not Her's; Sir
George, for his own credit, perhaps has not
told Mr. Faulkland what his conduct has
been towards me, but he wants to be in∣formed.
Contriving man! I will disappoint
him; nor shall he heap such obligations on
me as must sink me under their weight. I
will not receive this suspected gift of Lady
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
V—'s; but it is a delicate point, and, whilst
I refuse, I must take care not to offend. I
will send Lady V—her bill back again, but
in such a manner as to shew her, I refuse her
gift for no other reason but its being too
valuable.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 24.—See, my Cecilia, whether I
have succeeded in my endeavours to refuse,
with a good grace, my Lady V—'s offered
kindness.</P>
<P>This is my answer to her.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Lady V—</OPENER>
<P>“You oppress me, my dear and ever ho∣noured
Lady V—, by a generosity and
friendship that knows no bounds. Why
will you force me to appear proud, or un∣grateful,
by refusing the favours of so true
a friend? But, my dear Madam, do not be∣lieve
me either the one or the other. Had
you sent me a trifling token of your love,
you would have been convinced of my re∣spect
for you, by the thankfulness with
which I should have accepted it; but do
not seek to humble me so far, my good
Lady V—, by heaping favours on me,
which I can never have a prospect of re∣turning.
With equal respect and grati∣tude,
permit me, Madam, to return your
too considerable present. I cannot, in
honour, receive a liberality, which I am
so little intitled to; and the less, as Justice
now demands, that your bounteous heart,
<PB N="215" REF="216"/>
so diffusive in its generosity, should a little
restrain itself.”</P>
<P>“I cannot say that my circumstances are
as happy as they have been; yet have I,
I thank Heaven, accommodated my mind
to them. My brother has not been in
town since my mother's death; but I am
not without hope that he will make my
situation easy. On this account, I know
my dear Lady V—will the more readily
pardon my refusal of her obliging offer,
and believe that her goodness is not be∣stowed
on an unthankful heart.”</P>
<CLOSER>“I am, &amp;c.”</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>In this letter I re-inclosed her bill, and
have sent it off. Did I not well, my Ceci∣lia?
If, as I strongly suspect, this present
came from Mr. Faulkland, I should never
endure myself, had I retained it. If it
should have really come from Lady V—
herself, I must still approve my own con∣duct.
The sum (circumstanced as she now
is) was certainly to much for <HI>her</HI> to be∣stow,
or <HI>me</HI> to receive; and in the manner of
my refusal, I think I have insinuated this,
with as much deference for Lady V—'s judg∣ment
as I could shew. She will see my mo∣tive,
and I think that will be a sort of touch∣stone,
whereby I shall discover, from her
behaviour, whether my doubts are well
grounded or not.—</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="217"/>
Patty has, by her enquiries, heard of a
little pleasant retirement in the country,
about fifty miles off, where my children and
I can be tolerably lodged and boarded for
thirty pounds a year, at the house of an ho∣nest
farmer, a relation of hers; thither I
shall repair as soon as my little girls are in a
condition to be removed.</P>
<Q>[Continued by Patty.]</Q>
<P><HI>October</HI> 26.—The dismal task is fallen up∣on
me again, to keep an account of our me∣lancholy
days. My dear suffering lady is
seized with a fever, and confined to her bed.
She orders me, Madam, to write down every
thing as it happens. Lord keep us! there is
nothing but sorrows in this world: I am sure,
at least, my poor lady has had her full share
of them. Her close attendance on the chil∣dren,
and the loss of rest for so many nights,
has brought this new affliction on her. Oh,
Madam, the loss of health is a grievous
thing, even where there are riches: what
must it be in my lady's circumstances? But
she has the patience of Job himself. To be
sure, Madam, her trials are enough to put
another beside themselves; but I think my
lady's courage encreases with her troubles.
I was obliged, to-day, with an aching heart,
to dispose of a fine lace head of my lady's.
I heard her say, it cost sixty pounds; but,
though it never was was wet but once, I got
but fifteen for it, and this, perhaps, may all
<PB N="217" REF="218"/>
go to the doctor, if my lady's illness con∣tinues
long. What does it signify? We can∣not
buy health too dear.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 30.—My lady is better between
whiles; the doctor says, her disorder is
chiefly on her spirits; and though it is not
dangerous, he is afraid it will be very te∣dious.
Lord! what will become of us if it
is?</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 3.—My lady has had a letter this
day, from Lady V—, which she has ordered
me to send you, Madam, a copy of.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Mrs. Arnold.</OPENER>
<P>“You cannot imagine, my dear Mrs. Ar∣nold,
how uneasy you have made me, by
your not accepting of the bill I sent you,
because I too well know the occasion you
have for it. But, since you <HI>have</HI> refused
it, (and I know the sincerity and strength
of your resolutions) I must not take to my∣self
the merit of this friendly and generous
offer; too liberal indeed, as you, with
great delicacy, hinted, for <HI>me</HI> to make.
To let you into the secret at once, and that
your gratitude may be directed to the pro∣per
place, it was from our noble friend Mr.
Faulkland that I received that sum, with in∣structions
to send it to you, as from myself,
for he well knows you would not have ac∣cepted
it from him; but, since I see you
determined to reject it, as coming even
from me, I think I ought, in justice to him,
<PB N="218" REF="219"/>
to place this act of friendship to the right
account.”</P>
<P>“I had a letter lately from Mr. Faulkland,
wherein he tells me, that having heard,
from your correspondence with Mrs. Faulk∣land,
of Lady Bidulph's death, he fears
you are, by her loss, rendered extremely
unhappy in your circumstances. He is not
a stranger to the losses you formerly sustain∣ed
in your fortune, and he says besides, he
knows your brother's warm temper so well,
that he is apprehensive he will carry an un∣reasonable
resentment he has taken up so
far, as to deny you that brotherly kindness
and assistance, which you have a right to
expect from him.” “If this should be the
case” (he adds) “what must be Mrs. Ar∣nold's
situation?” “He then conjures me
to convey to you that trifle (as he called it)
under the sanction of my own name, that
being the only one from which he had a
hope it would not be refused; and he far∣ther
said, that if you should be prevailed
upon, on account of the friendship which
he knew there was between you and me,
to accept of my service, he would contrive,
from time to time, to furnish you with
such little supplies, as might make you
easy, 'till Sir George and you should be
on better terms. Now, my dear Mrs.
Arnold, you have the truth of this whole
affair. I own it was with great reluctance I
<PB N="219" REF="220"/>
lent my name to impose on you, but, as it
was so much for your benefit, I overcame
my scruple.”</P>
<P>“I could wish your extreme nicety had not
forbid you to accept this offer: I have rea∣son
to be angry with you on this account;
yet, my amiable sagacious friend, perhaps
you had your doubts. Be that as it will,
remember you said you would not have re∣fused
a small token of my love; I wish I could
send you one worthy of your acceptance,
and the love I bear you; we should then
see whose punctilio should get the better.
As it is, I send you a very small token,
which I insist on your taking, if you have
the least occasion for it; if this should be
the case, I know the candour of your heart,
and that you will be too ingenuous to grieve
me by a refusal.”</P>
<P>“I hope Mr. Faulkland will not be angry
with me for betraying his secret; But what
would it now avail to keep it? I would have
<HI>you,</HI> as well as myself, know his worth.
Oh how I lament—but it is to no pur∣pose
—Adieu, my dear good creature!
you are tried like fine gold, and your ex∣cellence
is become the more conspicuous by
adversity—.”</P>
<CLOSER>“I am, &amp;c.”</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>My Lady's spirits were greatly affected by
reading this letter; she wept bitterly, and
was so cast down all day, I was afraid it
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
would make her disorder much worse. The
good Lady V—inclosed a bill of fifty
pounds in it. My Lady said she must not re∣fuse
it, but would thank her ladyship when∣ever
she was able to take a pen in her hand.
God knows when that will be; for though
she struggles with her illness, it still gets the
mastery. The two young misses mend but
slowly; they do not gather the least strength,
and one of them has such a weakness in her
eyes that she cannot bear the least light.
Indeed, Madam, this is a most melancholy
family. I pray to God night and day to
keep me in my health, more for their sakes
than my own; for I think it would quite
break my heart if they should want my at∣tendance,
and I should not be able to give it
to them.—</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 6.—I write on, Madam, as I
am ordered, though I have but little to say,
in the confinement of a dismal sick room,
where I never see any body but a doctor and
an apothecary: but my lady is unwilling to
let this packet go, till she is able herself to
tell you (with her own hand) that she is bet∣ter,
for fear my dull account should make
you uneasy.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 7.—There is such changes and
turns in my lady's disorder, that we do not
know what to make of it. One while we
think she is a little better, and then again
the next hour she seems much worse than be∣fore.
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
The doctor would have a consultation,
though my lady is quite against it; but these
doctors love to bring in one another. My
Lady V—'s present came in good time,
but if they go on at this rate it will not
last long. My lady said to me to-day, Patty,
one would think that 1 was of great conse∣quence,
and mighty happy, by this bustle
to preserve my life; but there is the tie
(pointing to the two children); for their sakes
I must try to get well.</P>
<P>[After an interval of six weeks written by
Mrs. Arnold in a hand scarce legible.]</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 20—Restored at length by the
mercy of God from, the jaws of death!
restored to my children, to my dear Cecilia,
and just able to tell her with a feeble hand
that her Sidney lives.—</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 25.—I am now able, my dear,
to reassume that task, once the most pleasing
of my life, when health, joy and prosperity
gilded all my days. The scene is now
changed; and I think I have nothing the
same about me, but the feelings and affec∣tions
of my mind. You cannot imagine, my
Cecilia, how I am altered; you would not
now say, that you envied my white and red;
you would hardly know me, and it is not to
be wondered at, preyed on as I have been for
near two months by a slow but tormenting
fever. It is with difficulty that I hold my
pen, but my willing hand obeys my heart
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
when it would pour itself out to thee. I have
made a shift to scrawl a few lines to my good
Lady V—, to thank her for her kindness.
I could not refuse it; it would indeed have
been disingenuons, considering the footing
on which she put my acceptance of it. I
should have been driven to extreme streights,
if it had not been for her present, confined
as long as I have been to the languishing bed
of sickness.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 26.—Patty heard to-day that my
brother has been in town some time, but he
takes no notice of me. I have not a rela∣tion
in the world but himself. He could
not sure be so cruel, if he knew all. But
Lady Sarah keeps it from him; she thinks
perhaps I am slunk into some obscure corner,
where she leaves me to distress. Sir George
is not of a savage nature, yet his humanity
is not strong enough to seek out the afflicted.
His pride too I know is gratified by having
me out of the way of observation, and so
long as I do not call upon him, I find he will
not enquire after me.</P>
<P>The winter is now so far advanced, and I
am in a condition so extremely weak, that
I cannot, till the spring advances a little,
think of taking my flight to my peaceful re∣treat
in the country. I look eagerly forward
to the time of my enlargement; such I may
call it, for indeed, my dear, my spirits
are quite exhausted with my long confine∣ment
<PB N="223" REF="224"/>
in a little close lodging in this irksome
town.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 27.—The gentlewoman with
whom I lodged in St. Alban's-street, told
Patty who went to her house to-day to en∣quire
if there were any letters for me, that
there have been, at different times, several
people of my former acquaintance to look
for me; but I do not find that one enquiry
has come from my brother. I had given
the gentlewoman instructions not to tell any
stranger where I lodged. I believe this cau∣tion
was needless, there are few who give
themselves the trouble to trace out the steps
of the unhappy; and I dare say, that those
whom common form obliged to pay me a vi∣sit
of condolence on my mother's death, were
none of them much hurt at the disappoint∣ment
of not finding me.—</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 30.—I have been laying down a
little sort of plan for my future life. I told
you the terms I could live upon with the
farmer whom Patty found out for me; but
as I cannot expect to be boarded at so cheap
a rate when my children are grown bigger,
I have been devising the means how to en∣large
my scanty income against the time
that our wants must necessarily increase:
for I am firmly resolved my kind Lady
V—shall never augment the debt I al∣ready
owe her. You know, my dear, I am
pretty dexterous at my needle; the woman
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>
where I lodge deals in embroidery, which
is much in fashion, and I think I have
not seen any, though she pays largely
to her artificers in this way, equal to some
pieces of my own work. Now, my Cecilia,
I have resolved to apply myself to this when
I get into the country. I shewed the woman
a small fire-skreen wrought by me when I
was a girl, the same which I remember my
poor Mr. Arnold accused me of neglecting for
my Horace, and which had never been made
up; she said the work was so curious, that
she would give any price for such a hand.
Patty is well skilled in this sort of work too,
and as I find she is determined not to quit
me, I must, in return, endeavour not to let
the poor girl be too great a sufferer for her
kindness.</P>
<P>I think we shall between us be able to do
a good deal, and my landlady has promised
to receive and dispose of our work for a small
consideration, as fast as we can send it to her;
which we shall have constant opportunities of
doing.</P>
<P>You cannot imagine how pleased I am
with my scheme. Patty is in raptures at
the thoughts of her being permitted to con∣tinue
with me. I would even now set about
my project if my health would allow me,
but alas! my Cecilia, I am still so feeble,
I am not able to sit up more than an hour or
two at a time; and cannot walk a-cross my
<PB N="225" REF="226"/>
narrow room without help. Fresh air and a
little gentle exercise would I am sure, more
than any thing, contribute to restore my
strength; but the means to procure these,
are not conveniently within my power; so
that I must wait that slow, but generally sure
remedy, patience.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 10.—I have a wonderful incident
to relate to you! you, my Cecilia, I know
will join with me in admiring and praising
God for his gracious providence!</P>
<P>This morning I was but just risen and got
down into my little parlour, when Patty
came to tell me, a man desired to speak with
me. I immediately ordered him to be ad∣mitted.
Patty accordingly introduced the
person, who had stood in the entry while she
was speaking to me. He seemed to be a
man between forty and fifty years old, mean
in his apparel, though clean. I nodded to
my maid to leave the room, which when she
had done, I civilly demanded of the stranger
his business.</P>
<P>I was standing when he entered the room,
and continued doing so while I spoke to him,
not thinking from his appearance that he
was intitled to sit down with me. You know
I am not proud, but there is a sort of usuage
established, which we naturally fall into.
The man who had advanced some steps into
the room, looked over his shoulder as if for
a chair; so I understood the motion, and ac∣cordingly
<PB N="226" REF="227"/>
sat down myself, and bad him do
so too. He did, and with an air as if he
considered the civility to be only what was
due to him.</P>
<P>I believe, Madam, said he, though you
do not remember me, that you cannot be
ignorant of your having had a relation of
the name of Warner, who went to the West-Indies
about five and twenty years ago. I
answered, I do remember to have heard of
such a person.</P>
<P>You see that unfortunate man before you,
he replied; I am your near relation, Madam,
your father was my mother's only brother:
I have been very unhappy, I lost, in my re∣turn
to England, what almost five and twen∣ty
years industry had scraped together: the
sum was but a moderate one, yet sufficient
to have supported me decently for the re∣mainder
of my life. I asked him, how it
happened? I began, said he, to grow sickly
abroad, and was told that my native air
might restore me. This advice so well a∣greed
with my own inclinations, which were,
for a long time past, bent upon returning
home, that I took the first opportunity of a
ship bound for England; but we were un∣luckily
met by a French privateer, who strip∣ped
me of every thing but the cloaths on
my back, and set me on shore on the coast
of Spain, whence I begged my passage to
England, having nothing to support me but
<PB N="227" REF="228"/>
a few shillings, part of a collection, made
for me and my fellow sufferers, amongst
some English gentlemen.</P>
<P>Whilst he spoke, I thought I could dis∣cover
a likeness in his face to my father.
He was reckoned extremely to resemble his
sister, the mother of this unhappy Mr.
Warner; she was a fine woman, and I had
seen her picture. His story was credible;
and I had no reason to doubt the truth of
what he said.</P>
<P>And here I will give you a brief account
of what occasioned this unfortunate relation
to be thus long an alien from his family.</P>
<P>His mother, as you have just now heard,
was my father's sister, who threw her per∣son
and her fortune away upon a broken of∣ficer.
This act disobliged my father so
much, that from the time of her marriage,
to the hour of her death, he never would
see her. Her husband died, when this their
only child was about nine years old; the
poor mother survived him but a short time,
and the orphan boy was left to my father's
mercy. I have often heard him say he was
very unlucky, and never could be persuaded
into a love of his book; he was, however,
put to school, and my father bestowed the
same expence on his education, as if he had
been his own son. When he was about six∣teen
years old, as he wrote a good hand,
and had a great capacity for figures, he
<PB N="228" REF="229"/>
bound him apprentice to a merchant, in
which situation he had been above a year,
(and during that time he had made several
elopements, and was with difficulty recon∣ciled
to his master, through my father's me∣diation)
when he committed such a misde∣meanour
in his master's family, as obliged
him to abscond. Accordingly he stole un∣known
to any body, on board a ship bound
to the West-Indies, of which his master was
partly owner, where he hid himself, and
nobody could tell what was become of him,
'till my father, about nine months after his
departure, received a letter from him, dated
from Jamaica, wherein he begged pardon of
him, and his master, for his elopement,
told him, that he had been taken into a
merchant's compting-house, and declared,
that he meant, by his diligence and good
behaviour, to make amends for his past ill
conduct. This was the only letter my fa∣ther
or any of his friends ever had from him.
He answered it, but had no return; nor
could he, from repeated enquiries, made
two or three years after, learn any thing of
him; so that all his relations concluded him
dead.</P>
<P>These particulars I had heard before from
my father, and his relation perfectly agree∣ing
with them in every circumstance, I could
have no doubt but that he was the man.
Sir, said I, I very well remember to have
<PB N="229" REF="230"/>
heard your story; your likeness to my father,
who was the image of your mother, leaves
me no room to question your being the Mr.
Warner, of whom I have so often heard:
you are indeed my near relation, and it
grieves my heart to see you in such distress;
and the more so, as I have not the ability I
could wish to assist you; but we will talk o∣ver
more particulars after breakfast. I rang
the bell, and ordered Patty to get some cof∣fee.
While we were at breakfast, I asked
my new-found kinsman by what means he
had discovered me so soon? (for, by the
way, I should have told you that he said he
had been arrived but two days in London).
He answered, that one of the English gen∣tlemen,
who had been kind to him at Ca∣diz,
had given him a letter to a gentleman in
London, for whom he was to leave it at a
coffee-house in Pall-mall; that as he was de∣livering
it, he perceived another letter lying
on the bar, directed to Sir George Bidulph.
The two names struck him, remembring
them to be those of his cousin. His uncle,
he supposed, was dead; but he determined
to enquire who that gentleman was, and if
he found it to be my brother, to apply to him
for assistance. He had soon an opportunity
of being satisfied; my brother happened to
come in his chariot to the door, just as Mr.
Warner was going out; he knew the arms,
and had some recollection even of his fea∣tures.
<PB N="230" REF="231"/>
It was past three o'clock, said he,
and I heard Sir George direct his servant
home. I concluded he was going to dinner,
and that the morning was the properest time
to call on him, and having informed myself
where he lived, I accordingly went yester∣day
morning.</P>
<P>He stopped, and sipped his coffee for
some time without speaking.</P>
<P>And did you see him, Sir? Yes, Madam,
I saw him, and heard him too. He has got
a fine house, and seems to have every thing
very elegant about him. When I was let
into the hall, I desired the footman to ac∣quaint
his master that a Gentleman, newly
arrived from the West-Indies, wanted to
speak with him, being commissioned by Mr.
Warner, a relation of his, to enquire after
him. The footman went up stairs, and re∣turning
presently, asked me if I brought a
letter from the gentleman I mentioned. I
said, No, but I had something to say to
him.</P>
<P>The servant, after delivering this message,
came half way down the first flight of the
stairs, and leaning over the banisters, he
bid me walk up. I found your brother, and
his lady (I suppose) in her dressing-room, at
breakfast. There was tea and chocolate on
the table. I bowed very respectfully; the
lady scarce moved her head; your brother
said, Your servant, Sir, and viewed me from
<PB N="231" REF="232"/>
head to foot, but fixed his eyes earnestly on
my face. The footman who introduced me
had withdrawn. Sir, said I, have you quite
forgot me? I remember you well. He an∣swered
hesitatingly, and with a change of
countenance that boded me no good, I pro∣test,
Sir,—I—I know nothing of you.
“Have you forgot your cousin Ned Warner?”
He looked at his wife, and she at him; he
forced a smile at her, which she returned,
without knowing for what. “I do remem∣ber
there was such a one related to the fa∣mily,
whom we all supposed to be dead, as
for recollecting his person—'tis really so
long ago—that I—can't say I do.” All this
while he let me stand, he was lolling in an
easy chair, and had a dish of chocolate in
his hand, of which he sipped and spoke to
me by turns His wife was feeding a mon∣key
that was perched on her shoulder.</P>
<P>I am indeed more altered than you, Sir
George; the hardships which I have under∣gone,
and my long residence in a warmer
climate, may readily account for that; but
have you no traces of my features? no recol∣lection
of my voice? I have carried you
many times in my arms. “Sir, I do not
dispute the <HI>identity</HI> of your person, but I
should be glad to know your commands
with me.” <HI>Commands</HI> I have none, Sir:
the poor must entreat, not command.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233"/>
I then proceeded to tell him my unhappy
story in the same words I just now gave it to
you. His lady seemed not to mind me, but
kept talking to her marmouset. He listen∣ed
to me, but with so much impatience in
his looks, as quite abashed me. I was still
standing, but a little to take off the auk∣wardness
of my posture, I had ventured to
rest one arm on the back of a chair.</P>
<P>When I had done speaking, your brother
got up in a violent passion, to which he
seemed to have been working himself up
during the time I took to explain myself.
He whisked away the chair on which I was
leaning, and walked to the other end of the
room; then turning to his lady, Is not this
a pretty fellow to force his way in upon us,
by a sham story of a message from a rela∣tion?
and now truly, by way of an agree∣able
surprize he turns out to be that very
relation come a begging in his own proper
person. Sir, said I, I ask your pardon for
the liberty I took to gain admittance to you;
but you will be the more inclined to excuse
me, if you please to consider that it was out
of respect to you that I would not in the
mean appearance I now make, acknowledge
myself to any of your servants; for the
same reason I imagined, that had I not sent
a message which I was in hopes would have
a little interested you in my favour, I might
have been ordered to send up my business
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>
by your footman, which would, I thought,
have been quite improper. You might have
writ, said he, interrupting me. Ah Sir,
(shaking my head) if I <HI>had</HI>—and I stopped
short. “You might not have been much
the better for it, Is that what you would
say? (with a contemptuous half sneer.)
In short, Sir, I can do nothing for you; what
is it that you expect I <HI>should</HI> do?” I do not
mean to be a burden on you, Sir, I replied, I
was bred to business, I write a good hand,
and understand accounts. I hope to get into
some merchant's house; but in the mean
time I am starving. I am an utter stranger
here though in my own country. I observ∣ed
he had slipped his hand into his breeches
pocket, and seemed to be feeling for a bit of
money. Sir George, said the lady (who had
observed him as well as I) 'tis to no purpose
to give any thing to these sort of people;
assist one, and They will send another to
you, and so there is no end of such claims.
Your brother withdrew his hand from his
pocket, as if checked by his lady's looks.
“Sir, it is not in my power to assist you.” I
then asked him if you were living, and
where I could find you? for though you
were not born when I left England, I heard
afterwards that Sir Robert Bidulph had a
daughter. Your brother replied peevishly,
he knew nothing of you, as you preferred
the friendship of strangers to that of your re∣lations.
<PB N="234" REF="235"/>
He then rang the bell, and, call∣ing
his man to dress him, went out of the
room, without casting a look at me. I ven∣tured
to ask his lady your name (if you had
changed it) and where you lived. She told
me your name, but said she knew not where
you lodged, adding, I might spare myself
the trouble of enquiring you out, for to her
knowledge you could do nothing for me.</P>
<P>I took my leave; but enquiring of a foot∣man,
whom I found in the hall, he directed
me to St. Alban's Street, where you for∣merly
lodged. I went there, and it was
with difficulty that I could prevail on the
woman of the house, to tell me where you
now lived; but my necessities made me ur∣gent,
and I waited on you this morning,
Madam, to make my distress known to
you; but I am afraid the information I had
from your sister-in law, concerning you, has
but too much truth in it. As he spoke this,
he cast his eyes round my meanly furnished
parlour, looked at the poor equipage of my
tea-table, and again sipped his unfinished
and now cold dish of coffee.</P>
<P>Sir, said I, when my sister informed you
that I was poor, it is certain she spoke truth;
I am not however, I thank God, <HI>so</HI> poor,
but that I can spare you a little; if you will
take a cheap lodging near me, I will supply
you with enough to pay for it; and if you
can eat as I and my little family do, you
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>
shall be welcome to us every day, till some∣thing
can be done for you. I see but very
few people; but I will speak to such as come
in my way, to try to have you recommended
to some one for employment. I then put my
hand in my pocket, and taking out five shil∣lings
(all the silver I had) I put it into his
hand: Sir, you may owe some little trifle
where you have slept these two nights, I fear
your lodging has been but poor, but if this
will not discharge it, tell me freely.</P>
<P>He suffered me to drop the shillings into
his unclosed hand. He fixed his eyes ea∣gerly
on my face; but instead of replying
to what I said, he only cried out, Good
God! good God! and undoing two or three
buttons at his breast, he sobbed as if his bo∣som
was bursting. I was affected with his
gratitude, and tried to disperse the tears that
mounted to my eyes. I wish I could weep,
said he, but I can't; and may those be the
last tears that ever you shall have occasion to
shed! My worthy, my generous, my pious
relation! God forgive me for trying such a
heart, but I will reward it, amply will I re∣ward
your goodness.</P>
<P>He then drew a red letter-case out of his
bosom, and, opening it, he put a bill into
my hand for two thousand pounds on the
Bank of England. Think, my dear, how
I stared at such a vision! Sir, you amaze
me! was all I could say. I beg your par∣don
<PB N="236" REF="237"/>
don for deceiving you, said he, but it was
with a good intent. I suppose it is needless
to tell you that I am not that poor forlorn
wretch that I represented myself to you.
Hear the real truth of my circumstances.
You see before you (of a private man) one
of the richest subjects in these dominions.
You have heard that my setting-out was no
other than that of a common writing clerk
in a merchant's compting-house at Jamaica;
from whence I wrote twice to your father,
but never had any answer. I interrupted
him to tell him, I had heard my father say,
he had got one letter from him, and had
writ to him in return, and afterwards made
many enquiries after him, without success.
Perhaps he might, said he, but I never re∣ceived
it, nor heard of any enquiries made,
which piqued me so, that I resolved never
to write again. In a little time I made my∣self
so useful to my master, that he grew ex∣ceedingly
fond of me; and having no heir
but an only daughter, who, it seems, had
conceived an inclination for me, though
without my suspecting it, but which her
father had by some means discovered, he
frankly made an offer of her to me in mar∣riage;
with an assurance of leaving me all
that he was worth at his decease, and an im∣mediate
proffer of entering into partnership
with him. The only return he requested
on my part, was to change my name, and
<PB N="237" REF="238"/>
assume his, which was Collet. I made no
scruple of complying; for though my re∣gard
to the young lady had never risen to
what is commonly called love, I yet thought
her, in all respects, an unexceptionable
match. I married her; my patron punc∣tually
fulfilled his promise, and at the end
of three years I found myself, by his death,
in possession of a considerable estate. The
following year I lost my wife in childbed of
her first child, who died with its mother.
The changing my name was probably the
occasion of my not being found out by those
employed to enquire after me; and I, per∣haps,
ought now to acknowledge myself
careless in not acquainting my friends with
my good fortune.</P>
<P>I had such uncommon success in trade,
that my wealth increased amazingly. In
about five years after the decease of my
first wife, I married the widow of a mer∣chant,
with whom I got an immense for∣tune.
This lady I truly loved. She was
an amiable creature. I had one son by her,
a fine youth, and we lived happily together
for twelve years; at the end of which it
pleased God to take from me both wife and
child. Poor man! his tears began to slow
here. He proceeded. After this loss, my own
life began to grow tiresome to me; I had
more riches than I knew what to do with,
and had no-body to leave them to; my
<PB N="238" REF="239"/>
health began to decline; I grew weary of
the place, partly to divert my melancholy,
and partly through affection to my native
country, to see England once more. I set∣tled
my affairs in the best manner, sent
considerable sums of money over before me,
and brought a large one with me. During
my voyage the whim took me, that I would
enquire privately after your family, and pre∣sent
myself to you as I have done, in order
to make trial of your dispositions, resolving,
according as I found you worthy of it, to share
my fortune amongst you, as I knew I had no
other relations in the world.</P>
<P>I have been in England above a month.
The first thing I did, was to go down into
Wiltshire, where I was soon informed, that
your father and mother were dead, and that
your brother was married and resided for the
most part in London; you, I was told, had
been married and was a widow, but I could
learn no more about you. On my return
to town, I soon found where your brother
lived, and had the pleasure to hear a good
character of him; but I had determined to
make my own experiment on him, and I
did intend, had he received me ever so
kindly, to have made the same experiment
on you, before I disclosed my plot to either
of you.</P>
<P>I dressed myself in these old cloaths on
purpose, and what the success of my scheme
<PB N="239" REF="240"/>
has been you know. Your brother, nar∣row-hearted,
inhuman wretch! I blot for∣ever
from my thoughts: it will be the better
for you, though I have more than enough
for you both.</P>
<P>Your kindness, I tell you again, my va∣luable
relation, I will repay an hundred∣fold.
Accept of that bill in your hand for
your present use. I am sure you want it;
and accept of it only as an earnest of my
future friendship towards you. That bro∣ther,
in affluence himself, who could see
his sister, <HI>such</HI> a sister want, must have left
all regards to ties of blood, and 'tis no
wonder that I, so much further removed in
kindred, met with such treatment at his
hands.</P>
<P>See, my Cecilia, what an amazing turn
of fortune! what could I do but lift up my
eyes, as I did my heart, in silent adoration
of that God, who is a father to the fatherless,
and defendeth the cause of the widow!</P>
<P>It was some time before I could frame my
mind to discourse on ordinary subjects. I
gratefully accepted my cousin's noble pre∣sent.
He enquired minutely into my situ∣ation;
there was no need of concealing any
thing from him, nor did I attempt it. He
was very inquisitive as to my brother's beha∣viour
towards me. I told him the whole of
it; he was even bitter in his invectives
against him and Lady Sarah. But, said
<PB N="240" REF="241"/>
he, I will have my revenge on them; I will
make you triumph over him, and that proud
upstart his wife. What lodgings you are in,
my poor creature! is this your best room?
I told him I had nothing but that and a bed-chamber
where my children and I lay, and
a closet for my maid. He desired to see the
children; and I had them both brought in.
He kissed them tenderly; poor babes! you
have a cursed uncle, but you have a very
good mama; and I will take care of you
all.</P>
<P>I will dine with you to-morrow, said he;
let us eat a comfortable morsel together,
and, for your life, not a word of what has
past to any body. He then took an affec∣tionate
leave of me, and departed—Let
me here lay down my pen, and wonder at
my fate!</P>
<P>I have got into a flow of spirits, my dear.
What scenes of happiness might now open
upon me, if happiness consisted in riches
alone? but no, no, it does not. My heart,
broken by vexation, cannot recover its tran∣quillity
so soon. Yet is there room for joy,
joy springing from a rational, from a hu∣mane,
from a commendable motive; and I
will a little indulge it. I can now in part
return the vast obligation I owe Mr. Faulk∣land,
as far at least as relates to pecuniary
debts. I can now repay many-fold the kind∣ness
of my good lady V—. I can provide
<PB N="241" REF="242"/>
for my affectionate worthy Patty. I have
the delightful prospect of giving my child∣ren
an education suitable to their birth;
and, if my life is prolonged, of seeing them
honourably and happily settled in the world.
I shall have the glorious power of diffusing
benefits! Oh, my dear, 'tis good for me,
that I have been in trouble; it has so en∣larged
my charity, that I feel transports
which prosperity is a stranger to, at the bare
idea of having it in my power to succour
the afflicted. Who would not suffer adver∣sity,
to have the heart so improved?</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 11th.—My new-found relation
dined with me to-day, according to pro∣mise.
Patty had provided two dishes of the
best things in season, and dressed them ad∣mirably;
I need not tell you in what satis∣faction
Mr. Warner and I enjoyed our little
chearful meal. He had sent me in the morn∣ing
a hamper of excellent wine, and seemed
to relish his bottle with an extraordinary good
goust.</P>
<P>When Patty had carried the children up
stairs, and we were left alone, he told me,
that he had been that morning looking out
for a house for me; you must quit these
lodgings directly, and submit a little to my
management; for I <HI>will</HI> mortify your pal∣try
brother and his wife. You shall have
as handsome a house as his, and better fur∣nished
too, or I'll know why. You must
<PB N="242" REF="243"/>
know, I mean to set you out like a dutchess,
and you shall roll by that worthless puppy's
door in a better equipage than his minx is
carried in. But I do not intend to live with
you, as well as I love you; for though I am
an old weather-beaten fellow, you are young
and handsome, and the world I know is
full of scandal. I shall therefore content
myself with a lodging some where in your
neighbourhood, and come and see you now
and then. I thanked him for the prudence
of his consideration, but begged he would
restrain his generosity, and suffer me to live
in that moderate state, which, if I had ever
so much riches, would be my choice. Don't
oppose me, coz; said he, pray don't. I
<HI>must</HI> have my way in this; I have set my
heart upon it. You shall <HI>blaze</HI> for a while
at least; when I have had my revenge, you
may live as you please afterwards. I was
unwilling to contradict him in his odd hu∣mour,
yet was very much afraid of the con∣sequences
of <HI>blazing,</HI> as he called it, all at
once. But, dear Sir, said I, what will the
world think of my emerging thus from ob∣scurity
into the splendour you talk of? tho'
you do not live with me, as I am still young,
may it not give room for censure? busy
people will pry into the source from whence
I draw my affluence, and envy will not be
backward in putting wrong constructions on
<PB N="243" REF="244"/>
an appearance, by which it will be so much
excited.</P>
<P>He listened, looking me earnestly in the
face; then, nodding his head, with a very
grave countenance, said, You are a sensible
woman, coz, and I commend your pru∣dence,
but I must have my will for all that.
I could not forbear smiling at his manner;
and going on, if, said I, I were to enter
again into publick life with a moderately
genteel appearance only, no-body's curiosity
would be excited, as it might easily be sup∣posed,
that my brother had enabled me to
support a decent figure in the world—I
soon found that I had made use of a wrong
argument, which put my friend into a vio∣lent
passion. A fiddle-stick for you and your
brother too, said he? do you think I will
let that whelp have the credit of what <HI>I</HI>
mean to do for <HI>you?</HI> no, no, set your heart
at rest about that; what <HI>I</HI> do, all the world
shall know, and my reasons for it too. I'll
have my own way; there is no hurt, I hope,
in providing for a near kinswoman, that is
left to starve by a still nearer relation, I make
you my heir, look you, and I'll spread it all
over the town. Is there any harm in that?
God knows, I have no more ill in my heart
than one of your children; but I am a little
resenting may be, so say no more of it. I
found Mr. Warner was pretty positive, there∣fore
thought it the wisest way to insist no
<PB N="244" REF="245"/>
farther upon the argument; but told him, I
would submit entirely to his discretion. It
will be best for you, said he, consider me as
your father, and I will <HI>be</HI> a father to you. He
then told me, that he had been trying to
get a house for me near my brother's, that
I might <HI>nose</HI> him, as he called it; but that,
as there were none empty in the square, he
had fixed on a very handsome one in an ad∣joining
street. I did not like the furniture,
said he, so I ordered it out, and have be∣spoke
new of an upholder, who promises
me, in a week or ten days at farthest, to
have every thing completely fitted up. In
the mean time I can't bear to see you in
this sorry room; poor soul! how long have
you been here? I told him near four months,
and that, with his permission, I would con∣tinue
in these lodgings till the house was
ready, as it was not worth while to change
them for so short a time. Well, said he,
you may do as you will for that; I'll see
that every thing is to your satisfaction. He
took his leave, with an affectionate shake by
the hand.</P>
<P>How miraculous is all this, my dear! this
messenger of good tidings, is he not sent to
me by Providence? As I found he intended
not to make a secret of his designs in my
favour, I was in haste to divulge the joyful
news to my friends. I have accordingly
writ to my Lady V—, giving her an ac∣count
<PB N="245" REF="246"/>
of the wonderful revolution in my af∣fairs;
and I intend, as soon as I can fix
upon some curious present worth her ac∣ceptance,
to make her a large return for
her favours. I have also acquainted Mrs.
Faulkland of the happy turn in my fortune,
and I design a magnificent present for her
as soon as I have time to prepare it. To
neither of these ladies have I hinted at my
brother's behaviour, either to myself, or
Mr. Warner. I have made the good wo∣man,
with whom I lodge, stare wonderfully
at the relation, I could get nothing from
her but exclamations of astonishment, her
hands and eyes lifted up, “Good God!
Lord bless us! what strange things come
about! what luck <HI>some</HI> people are born
to! and this was your <HI>own, own</HI> cousin, that
you never set eyes on before? my good∣ness,
what a swarthy gentleman he is! but
tumbling in gold, I warrant him. It
would be long before such good fortune
would happen to me, though I have a
cousin beyond seas too.” I could plainly
see, that this poor woman envied my pro∣sperity,
though she tried to congratulate me;
but it is the less to be wondered at, as she
knew not, that I was born to any better pro∣spect,
than that of working for my bread in
a two pair of stairs room.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 15.—I have not seen my honest
kinsman these four days; but he sent me a
<PB N="246" REF="247"/>
note to inform me, that he was busy in see∣ing
every thing put in order in my new
house; and, that he abstained from visiting
me out of <HI>discretion;</HI> this word he marked,
the more to impress his full meaning. He
says, I shall not see any thing, till all is
ready; neither has he yet so much as told
me, the street where I am to live. I find
he <HI>will,</HI> as he himself says, have his own
way.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 22.—Now, my Cecilia, I may
reasonably hope, that my afflictions are at an
end: as far as wealth can promote felicity,
that felicity is mine.</P>
<P>I had just settled with my landlady, and
having paid her for her lodgings, made her
a present, a little to reconcile her to my
prosperity, when a new chariot, most su∣perbly
gilt, stopped at my door; a black
and a white footman in rich laced liveries
behind it. One of these brought me a note
from Mr. Warner, who informed me, that
he had sent my <HI>own</HI> equipage to carry me
home, where I should find him waiting to
welcome me to my <HI>own</HI> house.</P>
<P>Patty seemed to have got wings to her
feet; she flew up to me with the welcome
notice, and begged of me to observe from
the window, that the servants were in our
own family livery; with this difference,
that the lace was silver, instead of what we
used to give.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="248"/>
On expressing my surprise at this, Patty
told me, that Mr. Warner had, at his second
visit, enquired of her, as she let him out,
what liveries we used to give, but bid her
not mention it to me; which she said she
would not do, as she guessed, he meant to
surprise me. But this was not all; he had
been so minutely correct, as to have the
Arnold arms in a lozenge, elegantly painted,
on the doors; what these were, he was at
the pains of informing himfelf elsewhere.
My Patty, almost frantick with joy, hurried
the two children down stairs, and stuck
them up in the chariot, telling them both
it was their own, as she put them into it;
but the poor babes fell a crying, and were
not to be pacified by the novelty or finery
of the thing, till I came to them. She
staid behind, to send our little baggage after
us, and I drove to my new house in Pall∣mall;
where I found my generous benefac∣tor
waiting, as he had promised, to receive
me.</P>
<P>Oh, my dear, he is a princely man! such
grandeur, such elegance! he led me through
every room, where wealth and magnificence
were displayed, even to profusion. From
top to bottom there is not the smallest arti∣cle
wanting, that luxury itself can imagine.
The carpets, skreens, cabinets, and an
abundance of fine china, are beyond com∣parison
more beautiful than any thing of
<PB N="248" REF="249"/>
the kind I have ever seen. 'Tis but eleven
days since my kinsman mentioned his design
to me, and you must believe he has been
indefatigable in his diligence, since he has
left nothing for me to do, but at once to
take possession of this splendid mansion.
All the necessary domesticks are hired, and
ready in their respective stations; and I am
already as much settled in a few hours, as
if I had lived here so many years.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner told me, that, as a trifle
would not be sufficient to keep up every
thing in proportionable state about me, he
intended to allow me three thousand pounds
a year. This appointment, said he, you are
to consider as your own property, and just
call upon me as you would on your steward.
I am sure you will employ it well, you gave
me a proof of that in <HI>your five shillings.</HI> You
need not be afraid of being too profuse in
your charities; when I die, you will find
yourself possessed of the means of continuing
them.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, said I, long may you live to feel
and rejoice in the blessings which <HI>your</HI> boun∣ty
will, through me, I hope, draw down on
us both. I leave you to enjoy yourself, said
he; but I am impatient till your brother
knows what he has lost by his hard-hearted∣ness.
He cannot long be ignorant of it,
Sir, replied I; but indeed I flatter myself,
that he is not quite so much to blame, in
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>
regard to me, as we have both imagined.
You see he seemed to know nothing of my
situation, when you enquired after me, and
even threw out something like a reproach
for my having withdrawn myself, without
acquainting him where I was; I am very
sure Lady Sarah never informed him of
my having applied to her—It was his
duty to have enquired you out, said he;
did he not know you were poor? He
knew, said I, that my circumstances were
very much straightened; but he did not
know <HI>how</HI> much. Well, well, answered
Mr. Warner, it is good in you to excuse
him, but <HI>I</HI> know him to be a narrow-hearted
poltroon. He took his leave, and
said he would see me soon again, having
taken lodgings for himself in my neighbour∣hood.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 23.—I begin to doubt, my Ce∣cilia,
whether I am really awake or not!
'Tis all enchantment! I am afraid my old
kinsman is a wizard..…… I have
been talking to, and examining my servants,
to see if they are real living people, or only
phantoms; I look at, and handle the rich
furniture of my apartments, to try if it be
substantial!—'Tis all so—every thing real—
I beg my cousin's pardon, for suspecting him
of sorcery; I believe he deals in no charms,
but that all-powerful one—money.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="251"/>
Now, my sister, what a spacious field is
there opened before me! Three thousand
pounds a year! How many hearts will it be
in my power to make glad! and I will make
many glad.</P>
<P>“O Lord God, who hast showered down
thy blessings in abundance on my head,
vouchsafe me such a portion of thy grace,
that I may become an humble instrument
of thy mercy, to those whom the rod of
adversity has laid in the dust. Teach me
so to use this thy bounteous favour, that
<HI>Thy</HI> honour, not <HI>my</HI> worldly desires, may
be promoted; that <HI>Thy</HI> praise, not <HI>my</HI>
pride, may be exalted. And if, O Lord,
thou hast chosen me to be the dispenser of
thy fatherly kindness to the afflicted that
cry unto thee, quicken in my heart such
diligence, humility, and integrity, as may
render me not unworthy of the important
trust. But if, O my God! thou hast sent
riches only to be a trial of my strength,
unsupported by thee; be merciful, take
them from me, and restore to me that
poverty, which first taught me to know
myself.”</P>
<P>Upon my knees I have poured out this
prayer to the Almighty, and it is the fervent
wish of my soul that he would grant it.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 26.—You will smile, my dear,
as I did, in pity of the meanness of poor
<PB N="251" REF="252"/>
Lady Sarah; but proud people are always
mean. I have been here but four days, yet
I find she has already heard of my meta∣morphosis.
Indeed she could hardly do
otherwise, so near her as I am. Mr. War∣ner
has been very urgent with me to drive
out in my new chariot; this I readily com∣plied
with, as both the children and I wanted
air and exercise, and yesterday we drove
to Hide Park. I did not, however, go at
the hour when there is most company, but
I conclude I was seen either by Lady Sarah
herself, or by some one who told her; for
this morning, prodigious! she sent her wo∣man
to me with a message. I had her cal∣led
up stairs, and enquired very civilly after
my brother and his lady.</P>
<P>She told me, that Lady Sarah sent her hum∣ble
service to me, and was very much sur∣prised
that she had not heard from me in so
long a time; that she supposed I was gone
out of town, but as Sir George seemed un∣easy
that I never wrote to him, her ladyship
had sent her to enquire for me at my old
lodgings in the Hay Market, from whence
she had been directed to me here; and that
she was ordered to tell me, that her Lady had
talked to my brother about the affair that I
knew of, and that Sir George would act
agreeably to her request, if I would call or
write a line to him.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="253"/>
I found the woman had been instructed
to feign an entire ignorance, on her Lady's
part, of the change in my circumstances; but
I was resolved to let her see I had detected
this paltry artifice. I could observe, that
the servant, though she endeavoured to avoid
it, eyed every thing in my apartment with
surprise and curiosity; and I concluded, that
Lady Sarah had sent her for no other purpose,
but to satisfy herself, from her maid's ac∣count,
whether the report she had heard
concerning me was true. Tell your Lady,
said I, she needed not to have been at the
pains of framing such a message, to have
gratified her curiosity; my house is open
to any one who has a mind to look at it,
even to Lady Sarah herself. You shall see
it all over, and may report to her Ladyship,
what my cousin Warner's bounty has done
for me; and she may then judge, whether
I stand in need of the assistance she now pre∣tends
to offer me. The woman looked
abashed, and, though she seemed inclined to
ask questions, was ashamed to do so. This
was that very servant, who had so unce∣remoniously
led me up the back stairs, when
I went to visit her Lady; but I appeared in
a quite different light to her now: I rang
the bell, and ordered a footman to <HI>shew her
the house.</HI> She curtsied in silence, and with∣drew.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="254"/>
What a poor creature is Lady Sarah!
Mr. Warner called upon me before her wo∣man
went away. I told him the whole
passage. Oh! how he chuckled, and re∣joiced,
shrugging his shoulders, and rub∣bing
his hands! He wanted to see the ser∣vant,
but I was afraid he would be too
strong in his insults, and turned him from
the point.</P>
<P>He told me, he invited himself to dine
with me; and accordingly he favoured me
with his company; and staid during the
greatest part of the evening. He is a man
of a strong natural sense, though he is care∣less
of improving it. He has passed his
life in business, and in acquiring riches. He
does not let me into the particulars of these,
though he is, in other respects, very com∣municative
and entertaining. There is a
whimsical vein runs through his conversa∣tion.
He now, for the first time, desired
me to give him the particulars of my life
from my childhood, which he had but a
partial account of at different times, from
myself. I took up my story at the earliest
period of my life, wherein any thing inte∣resting
had occurred, and traced every cir∣cumstance
minutely to the hour he first saw me.</P>
<P>I could easily see, that he had a tender
sympathizing heart, for he was moved to
tears more than once during my relation;
<PB N="254" REF="255"/>
nor was he ashamed of them, for he suffered
them to run down his cheeks, whilst he lis∣tened
with mute attention to my story. He
praised Mr. Faulkland highly, said he was
a man after his own heart, and deserved the
best woman in the world. I wish you had
married him, said he, such a princely fel∣low
deserves a princely fortune. He owned,
my brother had some reason to be nettled at
my refusal of such a man. Our sex, said
he, have not such <HI>chimaera</HI> notions as you
women have; but still that does not excuse
his sordidness.</P>
<P>I took this opportunity of telling Mr.
Warner, that my brother did not really
know the very great distress I was in, and
that I had reason to believe, from the gene∣ral
tenor of Lady Sarah's character, that she
had either concealed it from him, or made
misrepresentations of my case; doubtless she
had not informed him to what straights I
was reduced immediately upon my mother's
death; and who knows but Sir George,
having left me for a while to feel the effects
of that resentment, with which he had
threatened me in his last letter, still meant
to shew himself a brother; for if he were
ignorant, as I am willing to believe, of that
particular which I have mentioned, he could
not suppose that I was driven to absolute
want; and from Lady Sarah's insinuations,
perhaps he thought that my mother left a
<PB N="255" REF="256"/>
sum of money behind her. He knew not
of the illness that my children and I were
visited with; and indeed it appears to me,
from what he hinted to yourself, that he was
quite unacquainted with my situation.</P>
<P>To say the truth, my Cecilia, as you
know I am of a placable disposition, I should
be glad to be on good terms with my bro∣ther,
the only relation (my kinsman ex∣cepted)
that I have in the world. I was
willing therefore, if possible, a little to re∣concile
Mr Warner to him; as I durst not,
without his permission, seek a reconciliation
with Sir George.</P>
<P>There <HI>may</HI> be something in what you say,
Coz, answered my friend; perhaps he had a
mind to let you bite on the bridle for a while,
and I am willing to suppose with you, that
hereafter, may be, he would have given you
some dirty trifle; for a generous thing I am
sure he is not capable of, from his sordidness
to me. I found this stuck most with the
good man. Oh, Sir, said I, but consider
Lady Sarah's influence stepped in <HI>there</HI>
too. My brother, you acknowledge, <HI>was</HI>
going to give you something, 'till she inter∣posed.
—Half a crown, I suppose, said he:
To say the truth, I believe she is the worst of
the two. She has a great deal of pride, Sir,
answered I; she has communicated some of
it to my brother; probably he was mortified
and disconcerted at the sight of so near a re∣lation,
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
in his wife's presence, whose exterior
appearance could do him no credit; perhaps,
had you applied privately to him, he would
have behaved better. You have not much
worldly wisdom, replied my cousin, to ex∣cuse
him thus; however, I think the better
of you for it, whatever I may do of him.
But speak honestly, now, don't you want to
be friends with Sir George, that he and his
wife may have an opportunity of seeing you
in all your finery? As I knew Mr. Warner's
temper, I was resolved to humour him in it,
and thought I could not give my desire of
seeing my brother a better turn than this, to
one of my kinsman's disposition. To deal
openly with you, Sir, said I, I think our
triumph over Lady Sarah will not be com∣plete,
unless she herself is a witness of that
high fortune, of which she might have been
a partaker, had it not been for her own
meanness of spirit. And to be sincere with
you, my Cecilia, I did think Lady Sarah de∣served
this mortification, though it did not
so far influence me as to make me desirous
of being on terms with her: as for my bro∣ther,
I was governed by no other motive than
affection towards him.</P>
<P>Well, said Mr. Warner, suppose yon were
to invite them both to dine with you, and to
have me at table, handsomely dressed out,
(for I can dress fine when I please) and let
them see that the man, who was not thought
<PB N="257" REF="258"/>
worthy to sit down in their presence, they
had better have used with more ceremony. Oh,
Sir, said I, that would be too severe an insult;
besides, I doubt whether my brother would
come; you know he is angry with me, and
thinks he has reason If you will permit me
first to call on my brother, when we are re∣conciled,
I can afterwards ask both him and
his lady to my house; and though I am sure
you have too much good nature and polite∣ness
to shock them all at once, by violating
the laws of hospitality in this house, which
your bounty has made mine, yet will you
have sufficient room for retaliation, by treat∣ing
them, in your turn, with neglect.</P>
<P>Thou art a milky thing, answered Mr.
Warner; but as I am willing to please you,
you may do as you like; but by—, and he
swore a tremendous oath, they shall never
have a cross from me.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 27.—Having obtained Mr. War∣ner's
consent, I went this day to my brother.
He was not at home, but I was introduced
to Lady Sarah, for whom. I enquired. Poor
woman! how she looked! My resentment
was disarmed; even my contempt subsided;
and I felt nothing but pity. Her confusion
was so great, she knew hot how to receive
me: she curtesied without knowing what to
say, or how to behave. I would not embar∣rass
her too far, but taking a chair by her,
As you favoured me with a message yester∣day,
<PB N="258" REF="259"/>
Lady Sarah, said I, in as obliging a
tone as I could speak, I thought it a sisterly
duty to wait on you and Sir George: I hope
my brother is well, I long to see him, and
flatter myself he will forget all former cold∣ness,
and again be my brother.</P>
<P>I spoke this long sentence on purpose to
give her time to recover herself. She rubbed
her hand over her forehead, I believe to hide
the glow that was in her face from my first en∣trance;
“Lord, Mrs. Arnold—I am so sur∣prized—this
visit was so unexpected—I
thought you were in the country”—(her
woman you know had been with me the day
before, I passed this by however) I have not
been out of town at all, Madam, I was de∣tained
by illness—“I am mighty sorry for
it—I hope you are quite recovered—pray,
why did not you let me know you were ill?”
as I had heard nothing from you, Madam,
after my first message, I was afraid that the
mediation, you were so kind as to promise
me, had failed, and that my brother's re∣sentment
was so great, he would not hear of
me.</P>
<P>“Oh dear, that is true indeed—it was a
sad affair—I mentioned you to your brother
when he came to town; but he was in <HI>such</HI>
a passion, I durst not name you to him a∣gain.”
(She durst not name me, observe
that, my dear; poor George, whom she go∣verns
with despotic sway) Then probably,
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
Madam, my brother knew not <HI>all</HI> my di∣stress?
I protest I don't know—said she—
you know your brother is very warm, and
when ever I attempted to speak of you, he
always stopped me short—so—I don't
know how it was; but I never could get to
tell him your situation—I should think I had
great reason to resent my brother's cruelty,
Madam, said I, if he had known those par∣ticulars
of which my maid informed <HI>you,</HI> but
since he did not, I will not reproach him;
neither will I accuse your ladyship of unkind∣ness
in concealing them from him. My suf∣ferings
are, thank God! at an end, and I
am now come to offer you, and Sir George,
my sisterly love, I hope he will not refuse me
his love in return, I have nothing else now to
ask for. She blushed again, and seemed in
great confusion; “You are very good, Mrs.
Arnold, we must forget and forgive”—
Shall I not be permitted to see my brother,
Madam? By the message I received from
you, I was in hopes you had prevailed on
him—The poor woman was now struck
dumb. She felt for her snuff-box, and <HI>would</HI>
not find it in her pocket; but got up to look
for it to gain a little time; rummaged her toi∣let,
and at last took it out of her pocket;
offered me a pinch of snuff, then sat down
again. Why, that message, to tell you the
truth, said she (forcing a conscious silly smile)
your brother knew nothing of; but not having
<PB N="260" REF="261"/>
heard from you in so long a time, I was re∣solved
to enquire after you; and was de∣termined,
myself, out of my own pin-mo∣ney,
to allow you what I could spare, till I
could get Sir George in better temper; but I
made use of his name, because I thought you
would more readily accept of any thing from
him than from me. Your brother thought
you were actually in the country, till we
were surprized with the account of the <HI>won∣derful</HI>
fortune that has come to you lately.
“Then you <HI>had</HI> heard of it, Madam, inter∣rupted
I, before you sent to me?” an un∣toward
question, my dear; it plunged her
again in the mud, and she flounced and
floundered to get out, which only sunk
her the deeper. We had heard a strange
flying report, said she, of which I did not
believe a word, and therefore sent Holmes
(that is her woman's name) to you to offer
you my service.</P>
<P>I was not ill-natured enough, my Cecilia,
to persist in embarrassing this mean woman
any farther, though the insincerity of her
whole behaviour, and the low falsities she
had recourse to, very well deserved reproof.
I was glad to find my brother was not so
culpable as he had at first appeared; for I
could easily discover from the whole tenor of
her discourse, she was so far from giving him
any intimation of my distress, that she had
prevented him from enquiring after me, by
<PB N="261" REF="262"/>
telling him that I was gone out of town;
probably too with some aggravating circum∣stances,
either of a pretended neglect on my
side towards them both, or, perhaps, some
other falshood still more injurious. It was very
apparent that she had sent her maid only as
a spy, and, by way of passport, with a sham
offer of kindness, of which she knew I stood
not in need: and she depended on my pride
and resentment so justly provoked, for my
never coming to any explanation either with
her or my brother. No wonder then, she
was confounded at the sight of me, and the
more so, as she apprehended I might re∣proach
my brother, who could so well excuse
himself by pleading ignorance of my situa∣tion:
and her conduct must then appear so
despicable to her husband, that hardy as she
is, she would be at a loss to justify it.</P>
<P>All this being very obvious to me, I de∣termined
to make her easy at once. I shall
think no more of what is past, Lady Sarah,
said I, I only wish to be on terms of friend∣ship
with my brother and you; and since he
knows not of the message you sent to me, I
will not mention it to him, nor any thing
else that can recal past unkindness. I hope
this visit will be taken as it is meant, out of
pure affection, and that you, Madam, will
be so kind as to make my peace with my
brother; whom I am very sorry I was under
a necessity of disobliging, but as I never did
<PB N="262" REF="263"/>
offend him, and I am sure never should but
in that one instance, wherein <HI>I</HI> was so much
more nearly interested than himself, I hope
he will think no more of it; but restore me
to a share of his love, which is all that is
now wanting to my happiness.</P>
<P>This declaration (as I intended it should)
entirely restored Lady Sarah's tranquillity.
Her countenance brightened up; I'll take
upon me to answer for Sir George, said she,
that he <HI>shall</HI> restore you to his affection; I
shall insist upon a general act of oblivion be∣ing
past on his side, and I beg, sister, on
your part, that you may not, by reproaching
your brother, revive the memory of your
past coldness.</P>
<P>The weakest people are often very cun∣ning;
this caution of Lady Sarah's, artfully
enough introduced, conveyed an obvious
meaning to me, very different from her pre∣tended
reason; she was afraid of an eclair∣cessement.
I promised her I should meet my
brother, whenever he would permit me, as if
nothing had ever happened to disturb our
friendship.</P>
<P>See, my dear, how this woman, who <HI>durst</HI>
not name me when I was poor, took upon
her now to <HI>make</HI> her husband, whose anger
had so much intimidated her, subscribe in∣tirely
to her opinion: but I was now become
an object of attention; a finer house, and
a finer equipage than her ladyship's, gave
<PB N="263" REF="264"/>
me an indisputable title to that regard, to
which, as a <HI>sister,</HI> and in distress, I had not the
least claim.</P>
<P>She now ventured to ask me some parti∣culars
relating to the very extraordinary
change in my fortune. I satisfied her mi∣nutely,
not without mentioning the cause of
Mr. Warner's having made me the <HI>sole</HI> ob∣ject
of his bounty. Poor Lady Sarah could
not conceal her vexation at the thoughts of
what she had lost by her ill-timed pride and
parcimony. A strange whimsical old mortal,
she called him, to come upon them so ab∣ruptly,
and in such a scandalous garb, that
Sir George was quite ashamed of him. I am
glad, however, Mrs. Arnold, that he has
made <HI>you</HI> the better for him; I hope he will
continue his fondness, but such odd hu∣mourists
are not to be depended on. Don't
tell him, however, what I say; I should be
glad to shew him any civility in my power,
for his kindness to you.</P>
<P>I took my leave of her ladyship, with a
cordial invitation to come and see me; which
she said she would not fail to do.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner called on me for a few mi∣nutes
in the evening to know the result of
my visit, as I had told him I intended to
make it. I related every thing that had
passed between Lady Sarah and me; he en∣joyed
her confusion as I described it, with a
triumphant satisfaction, which nothing but a
<PB N="264" REF="265"/>
very strong resentment could have excited
in so good-natured a man, as he really seems
to be.</P>
<P>He has added to my store of china to∣day
(of which I have already an abundance)
a pair of most magnificent jars, above four
feet high, which, he values at a hundred
and fifty pounds; these, with an entire ser∣vice
of the finest Nankeen china, and a
most beautiful Persian carpet, I have set apart
as a present for Lady V—, and shall send
them to her the first opportunity.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner very much approves of my
design, as he knows the obligations I have to
her.</P>
<P>I have also got him to bespeak a set of
jewels to the amount of fifteen hundred
pounds, with which I intend to present Mrs.
Faulkland. This sum will not exceed my
debt to Mr. Faulkland, if his agreement
with Pivet stands in force for the term
prescribed.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner, who mightily loves to be
employed, has undertaken to get these
jewels made up for me in the most elegant
taste.</P>
<P>This man's generosity is as inexhaustible
as his riches; I fancy he is still some way
concerned in trade, though he does not tell
me so. These jars he said he had just re∣ceived
by the arrival of an East-India ship,
and I understand that his former dealings
<PB N="265" REF="266"/>
were extremely extensive: all over the world,
he said, where there was commerce, he put
in for his share.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 29.—Lady Sarah has returned
my visit; she was not slow you see in her
ceremony. <HI>So</HI> obliging, <HI>so</HI> polite; every
thing praised, and admired; and <HI>sister</HI> at
every second word, and the children caressed,
<HI>Arnold</HI>'s children. What a fine thing it is,
my dear, to be independent! I shewed her
all my house; but not with ostentation. I
thought it would have looked affected not to
have recommended so much wealth and ele∣gance
to her notice. My sideboard, she says,
is absolutely the handsomest she ever saw;
indeed both for workmanship and richness it
does surpass any I have seen.</P>
<P>She told me she had talked to my brother,
and that though he still resented my obsti∣nacy,
as <HI>he</HI> called it, yet as I had made such
advances towards a reconciliation, he was
very ready to meet me, and desired every
thing might be forgotten on my side, as it
should be on his. He would have come to
see you, added Lady Sarah, but as he does
not chuse to meet Mr. Warner, he would
rather that the first interview between you
were at his own house. I told her ladyship
I would breakfast with her the next morning,
and we parted upon wonderful courteous
terms.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267"/>
<HI>January</HI> 30.—Just returned from my bro∣ther's.
Sir George received me with open
arms, and I returned the embrace with the
utmost cordiality of affection. Surely, my
dear, there is something wonderfully powerful
in the natural affections; Sir George, spite of
his resentment, his turbulence, and the threats
denounced against me, could not at sight of
me, after an absence of so many months,
resist the first impulse of his heart, in giving
me strong tokens of brotherly love; though
probably had he not seen me, the latent ten∣derness
might have lain for ever dormant in
his heart.</P>
<P>I entered immediately on the topic of my
extraordinary acquisition, as I was determined
not to lead to a subject which might bring on
the explanations so much dreaded by Lady
Sarah; and I could observe that my brother
avoided any thing tending that way as much
as I did.</P>
<P>He congratulated me heartily on my good
fortune, but said, between jest and earnest,
that if he could have divined his cousin War∣ner
had come to him to make experiments,
he should have taken care to have treated
him better. But I don't know how it was,
said he, he came in an evil hour; and I was
in an ill humour.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah kept up the conversation with
a great deal of vivacity; always taking care
to keep clear of the rock she was afraid of,
<PB N="267" REF="268"/>
till a lady, with whom she was engaged to
go to an auction, called to take her up. Sir
George would fain have detained me, but she
insisted on my going with her, to have <HI>my</HI>
judgment she said on the things she intended
to buy. It appeared to me that she did not
chuse to leave my brother and me together,
for fear mutual confidence (in the fulness of
our hearts) might have brought her disinge∣nuous
proceedings to light: but cunning
people often over-act their parts; she was so
extremely pressing that my brother could not
but take notice of it. I acquiesced to avoid
giving her uneasiness; having first engaged
my brother to dine with me on Friday. Lady
Sarah and he both consented, but promised,
that Mr. Warner was not to be of the party;
this I ventured to promise, as I was resolved,
if Mr. Warner invited himself, which is his
usual way, to put him off by fairly telling
him the truth, and trusting to his good na∣ture
for the consequence.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 2—After the trivial incidents of
these two last days, my Cecilia, now hasten
to more interesting particulars. But first a
word or two of my cousin Warner. I had
not seen him since the day that my brother
and I met, till this morning; when he called
to ask me how I did, and to know how the
puppy George, as he calls him, had behaved
to me. After having satisfied him in this
enquiry, in a way the most favourable I could
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>
for my brother, I told him, that as I had
really found both him, and his lady extreme∣ly
penitent and mortified, I had asked them
to dine with me that day. I am glad of it,
said he, (very quick) I'll be here to snoutch
them. Dear Sir, said I, for heaven's sake
have a little compassion: you cannot conceive
how humbled they are; they dare not look
you in the face, and it was one of their con∣ditions
with me, before they would consent to
come, that they should not see you. Ho, ho,
said he, exultingly, have they changed their
Note? Well, I will not distress you so far in
your own house, as to mortify them with my
company at dinner, but if I should take it in
my head to drop in, in the afternoon, you
must not take it amiss. I only want to see
them look a little like fools.</P>
<P>I could not venture to oppose him in this,
but resolved to make it as easy as possible,
by preparing my brother and sister for his
visit.</P>
<P>I told him that would do extremely well,
and he went away rejoicing at the thoughts of
his intended triumph.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner had but just left me, when I
was surprized with a message that Sir George
was below. I went down to him directly,
and seeing him in his morning-dress, ima∣gined
that something had happened which
prevented their dining with me, and that he
called to excuse himself; but he undeceived
<PB N="269" REF="270"/>
me presently. As I had not an opportunity,
said he, of asking you any questions the other
day, and shall be prevented probably in the
same manner this day, I am come to have
an hour's chat with you before dinner. And
first, pray inform me, Sidney, where you
have lived ever since my mother's death, and
how it comes to pass, that in all this time,
you never took any notice of either Lady
Sarah or me? As to your first question, bro∣ther,
it is easily answered, I have never been
out of London: for the rest, let us avoid all
retrospection, which can now answer no end
to either of us.</P>
<P>You surprize me, said he, I understood
you had been in the country; Lady Sarah
was told that you were gone to Lady V—.</P>
<P>She was misinformed, I replied—</P>
<P>What was the meaning then, said he, that
you never called, or sent to her? <HI>She</HI> had no
resentment to you, though <HI>I</HI> had.</P>
<P>Dear Sir George, ask me no more questions,
I thought it had been premised that we were
not to talk of the past.</P>
<P>I see, Sidney, answered he, there is some∣thing
you have no mind to explain; you
know I love and respect my wife, and that I
cannot easily be brought to take any thing ill
of her; but she was so extremely earnest with
me not to ask you any questions, that it made
me suspect there was something she had a
mind to conceal from me. What confirms
<PB N="270" REF="271"/>
me in this opinion, is, that as I know you
are ingenuous and open to conviction, you
would have made me some apology for a ne∣glect
both of me and Lady Sarah, which,
you could not but suppose, offended me, if
you had not looked upon yourself as by much
the most injured Person.</P>
<P>You urge me very home, brother; I
thought I was injured when you disclaimed
all relationship to me, if I did not comply in
a certain particular, which I was not at liberty
to do.</P>
<P>I <HI>was</HI> very angry with you, said he, but
should not have carried my resentment any
lengths after my mother's death, if you had
made any concession, or desired to throw
yourself under my protection, instead of a
stranger's, for Lady V—comparatively is
one. I could not suppose you were in imme∣diate
want of my assistance, as I understand
my mother's private purse was not inconsi∣derable,
and to tell you the truth, I was re∣solved
till you did condescend to inform me
of your situation, not to give myself any pain
about you.</P>
<P>I can only tell you in two words, Sir
George, that you have been extremely mis∣led
in regard to me; I wish not to revive so
disagreeable a subject, pray say no more of
it.</P>
<P>But one word more, said he, just for my
own satisfaction, and then I have done: was
<PB N="271" REF="272"/>
Lady Sarah made acquainted with your cir∣cumstances?
You must have lived in miserable
obscurity to be so long in London without my
knowledge.</P>
<P>You love and respect your wife, brother;
you must not take any thing ill of her.</P>
<P>I am answered, he replied: He walked
about the room, and I could see he was a∣shamed
and affected.</P>
<P>You will make me very unhappy, Sir
George, said I, if you resent any thing on
my account to your lady; she did not think,
perhaps, that things were quite so bad with
me as they really were; but if she heard
(which by the way I knew was an invention
of her own) that my mother left any thing
behind her, she was deceived, there really
was nothing. But let us call another sub∣ject.—When
did you hear from Mr. Faulk∣land?
it is some time since I have had a let∣ter
from his lady.</P>
<P>His lady, he repeated, and stamping with
his foot, cursed be the hour which gave her
that title!</P>
<P>Dear Sir George, you shock me! how can
you be so uncharitable, so unchristian?</P>
<P>If you knew her as well as <HI>I</HI> do, said he,—and
shook his head.</P>
<P>You are so strong in your indignation a∣gainst
her, I replied, that you almost make
me suspect that you <HI>do</HI> know more of her than
I do; her weakness in regard to Mr. Faulk∣land
<PB N="272" REF="273"/>
excepted; I could never entertain an
ill thought of her; but you have raised
a curiosity, which, though I tremble to
have it gratified, yet I must beg you to speak
out.</P>
<P>Do not think me malicious, Sidney, said
he, a woman's reputation is too sacred a
thing to be trifled with; if her weakness, as
you call it, had been confined to Mr. Faulk∣land,
<HI>her's</HI> should be so with me: but I can∣not
think, with temper, on the sacrifice that
noble fellow has been forced to make to
caprice.</P>
<P>Dear brother, explain yourself; you terri∣fy
me.</P>
<P>My heat on this occasion, he answered,
would be unjustifiable, if I had not <HI>proof</HI>
for what I say; Miss Burchell, for I will not
call her by my friend's name, is that mon∣ster,
a female libertine, a rake in the worst
sense of the word.</P>
<P>Monstrous! cried I, your prejudice makes
you believe every cruel tale you may have
heard.—</P>
<P><HI>Heard!</HI> he interrupted with an indignant
smile, the d—l's in it, if I have not more
than <HI>hear-say</HI> for my knowledge.</P>
<P>Lord! brother, you make me shudder;
what do you mean?</P>
<P>He replied, you will not believe me per∣haps,
when I tell you, that <HI>I</HI> am as much
<PB N="273" REF="274"/>
obliged to Miss Burchell's favour, as Mr.
Faulkland was.</P>
<P>If Sir George had plunged a dagger in
my heart, I could not have felt a sharper
pang. He saw me struck with amazement
and grief.</P>
<P>I knew it would shock you, said he, but
you extorted the secret from me; for a se∣cret
it has, and ever should have, remained,
but in my own justification you compelled
me to disclose it.</P>
<P>You know, said he, that from the first I
never considered Faulkland's engagement
to her, as a serious one, nor in any shape
binding: This judgment I formed, without
knowing any thing of the woman, but from
Faulkland's own representation of the fact;
tho', to say the truth, he always spoke of her
with more tenderness than she deserved;
and imputing her frailty to her love of him,
was, as most men are apt to do on such oc∣casions,
disposed to judge favourably of her.
The first time I saw her was at Sidney Cas∣tle▪
that time when my mother invited her,
and when, you may remember, I went
down there in compliment to my mother.
I own I thought her extremely agreeable,
which was alone sufficient to make me a
little more than barely polite; but my mo∣ther's
extraordinary attachment to her en∣gaged
me to go still further, and to oblige
her, I was more than ordinarily attentive
<PB N="274" REF="275"/>
to please Miss Burchell. When I assure
you, upon my honour, that I had no farther
views, I believe you will not doubt my ve∣racity;
but whether Miss Burchell mistook
my civilities for fondness, or whether, as
I rather believe, her natural disposition was
so loose, that every man she saw lighted up a
flame in her heart, I know not; but certain it
was, she made me such advances, that I must
have been extremely stupid not to have un∣derstood
her, and absolutely frozen, to have
repelled her.</P>
<P>My good mother's unsuspecting temper
permitted us too many opportunities, and
the light ones of your sex do not easily for∣give
the neglect of those.</P>
<P>In short, Miss Burchell yielded to the im∣petuosity
of her wishes, and I followed her
lead, more through vacancy, and a want of
better employment, than out of inclination.
I was very glad when she was recalled home,
for I was heartily weary of her. The day
before she left Sidney Castle, when we were
alone, she said to me, I have too great a re∣liance
on your honour, to suppose you capa∣ble
of injuring my reputation, by ever di∣vulging
what has passed between us; I am
easy therefore on that head. But there is
one circumstance, on which you must give
me the most solemn promise that is in your
power to make, without which I shall be
the most unhappy creature in the world.
<PB N="275" REF="276"/>
I know there is a friendship between you
and Mr. Faulkland, and I am not ignorant
that you men, in your unreserved moments
of confidence, do not scruple to disclose such
secrets as I have entrusted you with; I do not
fear your imprudence with regard to any
one else; but it is of the utmost importance
to me, that <HI>He</HI> in particular should never
know what my tenderness for you has led
me into. You know I have a son by him;
he has hitherto provided liberally for the
child's maintenance; and, to let you into a
secret, which no-body besides must know,
I myself am indebted to him for the princi∣pal
part of my support; though he, as well
as the rest of the world, believe that I have
a fortune. Now, though I do not entertain
the least hope, nor indeed wish, ever to be
Mr. Faulkland's wife, yet would it be of
terrible consequence to me, to forfeit his re∣gard,
which you may naturally suppose
would be the case, if he were to come to
the knowledge of what has happened. He
has given me to understand by his house∣keeper,
that, when he comes to England, he
will provide for me: the woman hinted
something like a design of his making a
handsome establishment for any worthy man
of whom I should make choice; insinuating,
at the same time, that this depended on my
conduct. I have no thoughts of marrying;
but as mine and my child's future welfare
<PB N="276" REF="277"/>
must be chiefly owing to Mr. Faulkland,
you see the necessity there is for my preserv∣ing
his good opinion. For this reason, then,
my dear Sir George, you must swear to me,
that you will never betray me to him.</P>
<P>The reasons were so plausible, and the
request so natural, that I made no scruple of
giving her a solemn oath, to preserve the
secret inviolable from Faulkland's know∣ledge;
for so she herself worded the promise
she urged me to make: in regard to any one
else, she said she was satisfied all assurances
were needless.</P>
<P>You see, continued my brother, that by
this declaration, she laid me under a double
tye of secrecy. As I had no conception
that Faulkland could ever be brought to
think of marrying her, I thought myself
bound not to injure her in his opinion: and
therefore religiously kept my promise.
Faulkland was not then in England; but
when he returned, and came to visit me at
Sidney Castle, just at the time you parted
from your husband, he spoke of Miss Bur∣ehell
in a manner, which, though it con∣vinced
me he had a regard for her, and
wished to see her happy, yet was it far from
alarming me on his own account; I there∣fore
should have thought it the highest
baseness and cruelty to have hurt her in his
esteem.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="278"/>
I never have had the least intercourse, ei∣ther
by letter, or otherwise, with Miss Bur∣chell,
since we parted. I make no doubt
but she has dispensed her favours wherever
her inclination has led her, and you see she
has had the good fortune to keep all her
amours secret. But what hope can there
be, that such a profligate will keep her faith
to <HI>one</HI> man, though that man is the most
amiable in the World?</P>
<P>Oh, brother, what a scene of iniquity
have you disclosed! I would to Heaven you
had kept the horrid secret to yourself, or
divulged it time enough to have prevented
the misery, into which I, unhappy that I
am! have precipitated your friend. But I
ought not to blame you; you acted agree∣ably
to the dictates of honour. Detestable
woman! I cried, in the bitterness of my
heart, I do not wonder at her cautioning
me against letting you into my design of
urging Mr. Faulkland to marry her; I then
little knew the reason you had for the oppo∣sition
she said you would give to this fatal
match: every thing fell out to her wish,
and coincided to promote her successful
guilt.—Your absence from London, mine,
and my mother's urgency, and the too ge∣nerous
yielding of our dear unhappy Faulk∣land.
I burst into tears—my heart was torn
with anguish, and in that instant my tender∣ness
for him revived. Sir George strove not
<PB N="278" REF="279"/>
to comfort me. He was too much affected
himself.</P>
<P>I have but one hope, said I, and that is,
in the extraordinary love she has for Mr.
Faulkland, and his uncommon merit, which
may probably ensure to him the continuance
of it.</P>
<P>You know not what you say, answered
my brother; the merit of an angel could
not secure the fidelity of such a heart as
her's. Her love is gross; a new object
will always have charms for her. Had I
been as credulous as Faulkland, I should
have thought myself the idol of her soul, so
lavish was she in her expressions of tender∣ness.</P>
<P>Is it not strange though, I asked, that,
with so loose a mind, she should have so long
preserved an attachment to Mr. Faulkland?
for most certainly her affection to <HI>him</HI> has at
least been sincere.</P>
<P>Her affection to his estate, answered my
brother, has, I believe, all along been sincere.
Do you not know she is a beggar?</P>
<P>I told him, in this she had imposed on
him, to answer her own ends, in engaging
him the more firmly to keep her secret; for,
to my knowledge, she had seven thousand
pounds, as 1 was informed by Lady V—,
who knew her circumstances.</P>
<P>Sir George vented two or three curses on
her head. I am not surprized at any in∣stance
<PB N="279" REF="280"/>
of her falshood, said he; she is made
up of deceit. Such characters as her's are
not uncommon; but none of them ever fell
in your way before, and I hope never will
again. If you will look back on her whole
conduct, however it may surprize you, you
will find there is nothing inconsistent in it.
She is only a sly rake in petticoats, of which
there are numbers, that you good women
would stare at, if you knew their behaviour.
She considers men, just as the libertines of
our sex do women. She likes for the pre∣sent;
she seduces; her inclinations cool to∣wards
an old lover, and are warmed again
by a new face. She retained not Faulkland
long enough to grow tired of him, and
therefore possibly still preserved some ten∣derness
for him; indeed his uncommon at∣tractions
must have made an impression
even on <HI>her</HI> heart; but this did not hinder
her from indulging her inclinations else∣where.
You must throw into the account
too, that she had, by accident, got a sort of
hold on him, of which, by my mother's in∣dulgence,
and some other concurring cir∣cumstances,
she hoped, one day or other, to
avail herself. With so pretty a person as
she has, and the fortune you tell me she is
mistress of, do you think she could have
failed of marrying creditably, if that had
been her view? No, no, she meant not to
confine herself. Her passion for Faulkland,
<PB N="280" REF="281"/>
whether real or pretended, gave a colour
to her preserving that liberty, in the licen∣tious
use of which she placed her happiness:
nor would she, in the end, have confined
herself within the bounds of marriage, if
an immense fortune had not sweetened the
restraint.</P>
<P>I pray Heaven it may, answered I; 'tis all
we have now to trust to. You have given
me an idea of a character, which I thought
was not in the female world.</P>
<P>I own, replied Sir George, I live in per∣petual
fears of her relapsing into vice. A
woman without principle, Sidney, is not to
be relied on. Love (if in such a breast it can
merit that name) even towards the most
deserving object, is never permanent. Fear,
and even shame, are subdued by repeated
crimes; what hold then remains; interest
alone (where that happens to interfere); but
if detection can be avoided, even that can
have no farther influence.</P>
<P>Sir George took his leave of me, in or∣der
to go home to dress; but I was not to
say a word of his morning visit, so that I
found I needed not to be under any appre∣hensions
of his reproaching Lady Sarah with
her behaviour towards me; for he meant
not to let her know he was informed of it.
So much the better; I should be extremely
sorry to be the occasion of any difference be∣tween
them.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="282"/>
They came at the appointed hour; I en∣tertained
them magnificently; and we were
all harmony and good humour. When
dinner was over, I told them, they must not
be surprised, if we should have a visit from
our West-Indian relation, in the evening;
for, that it was very probable he would call,
and if I should be denied, he would never
forgive me, as he might possibly find it out.
Lady Sarah looked frightened, and said she
would not stay; but Sir George declared he
would arm himself with a few bumpers, and
stand his ground.</P>
<P>I affected to treat the interview with plea∣santry,
and reconciled them both to it; for
I was really apprehensive, that Mr. Warner
would take it very ill, and think I betrayed
him, if I let them escape. I supposed too,
that after he had indulged himself in a short
triumph, all would be over, and they might
afterwards meet on better terms.</P>
<P>In less than half an hour, we heard a loud
rap; Lady Sarah turned pale; Sir George
laughed at her, but was himself a little dis∣concerted.
The parlour door flew open—
a footman entered—Mr. Warner—and in
stalked my kinsman, with a very stately
tread. He was dressed out, I assure you. A
large well-powdered wig, tied with, a rose;
a suit of the finest cinnamon-coloured cloth,
and over it a surtout of the richest mohair
and silk, with gold frogs; and a fine cloud∣ed
<PB N="282" REF="283"/>
cane, with a gold head; silk stockings
of the same colour with his coat; a fine lace∣cravat,
his hat under his arm. He really
looked very gentleman-like, and venerable;
for he appears older than he is.</P>
<P>He glanced his eyes, with a supercilious
scorn, over my brother and sister, who stood
up at his entrance, and making up directly
to me, saluted me, and took his place by
me. A short silence ensued, which was
broken by my asking Mr. Warner to drink a
glass of wine. I could almost have smiled
at the embarrassme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of my brother and
Lady Sarah; the old gentleman enjoyed it,
and looked at them both, but as if he knew
neither. My brother had recourse to the
bottle; he drank my health, and civilly
enough bowed to Mr. Warner, just pro∣nouncing
the word Sir!—the other scarce
returned it by a slight inclination of his
head.</P>
<P>At last, addressing himself to me, cousin,
if you have no aversion to tobacco, I should
be glad you would indulge me with a pipe;
'tis my custom after dinner, but I have not
smoaked yet.</P>
<P>As I had never observed him to do this,
when he had dined with me before, I took
it for granted, the compliment was meant
for Lady Sarah.</P>
<P>I said <HI>I</HI> had no objection, and referred
myself by a bow to Lady Sarah.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="284"/>
She made no reply, and my kinsman,
without seeming to mind any one else, rang
the bell, saying, If <HI>you</HI> don't dislike it, there
is no more to be said. The black, whom
he had given me, presenting himself at the
door, Mr. Warner desired him to step to his
lodgings for his pipe, and some tobacco.
The man quickly returned with a long
japaned reed, with a boll fixed at the end of
it. Mr. Warner called for a lighted taper,
and throwing himself back in his chair with
one leg crossed over the other; lighted his
pipe with much composure, puffing large
clouds of smoak a-cross Lady Sarah's nose,
who sat at his right-hand My sister, who
had really an unaffected aversion to tobacco,
could not bear this; she coughed exces∣sively,
and, with tears in her eyes, rose off
her chair, and retired to the other end of
the room. My old gentleman laughed till
he wheezed, nodded his head after her,
and looking at me, as much as to say, I am
glad I have sent her off.</P>
<P>Sir George, though determined not to be
put out of humour, thought this was go∣ing
too far; I was really uneasy myself, and
hardly knew how to act; for if I shewed
any mark of distinction to Lady Sarah, I
knew it would be construed by Mr. Warner
as an affront to him. I ventured, however,
to tell her, that if she would step into the
<PB N="284" REF="285"/>
drawing-room, I should order coffee, and
wait on her immediately.</P>
<P>Ay, said my brother, approaching his
Lady, and taking her by the hand, let us get
out of the horrid atmosphere that this honest
gentleman has raised about us. The honest
gentleman vouchsafed not to look at him,
and my brother and sister withdrew into the
adjoining room.</P>
<P>As soon as they were gone, Mr. Warner
threw down his pipe, and, striking the table
with his clenched fist, burst into a loud
laugh. Lord, Lord! said he, pride <HI>will</HI>
have a fall. I think I have brought them
down a little; how like asses they both
looked! Well, now I am satisfied—I have
had my revenge, you may go and drink
your coffee with them; I'll bid you good∣by.</P>
<P>He immediately withdrew, and I joined
my brother and sister, who were heartily re∣joiced
that they had got rid of him.</P>
<P>Sir George said, he saw his design, but
was resolved not to give an opportunity for
insults, and so held his tongue. As he is
your friend, Sidney, said he, I would not
distress you, by engaging you as a party on
either side, which must have been the case;
for that old fellow would not have suffered
you to remain neutral.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="286"/>
I told him our kinsman was whimsical,
but that, as he was now thoroughly satisfied,
at having paid them in kind, I was sure he
would never again seek to give them any
offence, and they ought to forgive him by
the law of retaliation.</P>
<P>They laughed at the singularity of his
manner, and the whole passed off in mirth:
though Lady Sarah declared, he had made
her quite sick with his nauseous tobacco.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 3.—The ridiculous scene of yes∣terday,
my Cecilia, for a while called off
my thoughts from the melancholy subject,
which is now nearest my heart, I mean the
shocking account which Sir George gave
me of Mrs.—, can I bear to call her
—Faulkland! but it now recurs to me with
all its horrours. Oh, my dear, what a fatal
wretch have I been to Mr. Faulkland! my
best purposes, by some unseen power, are
perverted from their ends. I wonder the
food which I take to nourish me is not con∣verted
into poison when I touch it. But I
will calm my troubled mind with this reflec∣tion,
that I <HI>meant</HI> not to do evil. Mr. Faulk∣land,
ignorant of his own misfortune, may
(as hundreds of others in the same situation
are) still be happy, if that light creature has
but a single grain of honour or gratitude.
I will net think of it—anticipating, as you
used to call it, I will banish the hateful
idea from my mind.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="287"/>
<HI>February</HI> 12.—What do you think, my
Cecilia? Mrs. Gerrarde has eloped from
her husband, and is now at Paris in quality
of mistress to a young nobleman, who main∣tains
her in vast splendour. I had this
news in a letter from Mrs. Faulkland to∣day.</P>
<P>Poor Pivet wrote his master an account
of it. You know the agreement, to pay
this young man an annual sum, was con∣ditional.
Upon Mr. Arnold's death, Pivet,
tired of the termagant spirit, and intolera∣ble
coquetry of his wife, was very glad to
relax his discipline; and declared, were he
to have had a thousand a year, he would
not undertake to keep her within bounds;
and that nothing but his great respect for
Mr. Faulkland could have engaged him in
the task so long. He acknowledges, that he
is very glad to be rid of her; and as Mr.
Faulkland enabled him to set up very hand∣somely
in his business, I really think he is
happy in his loss.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 14.—I have been deeply af∣fected,
my Cecilia, within these two days.
If it had not been in my power to relieve
the distress I have been a witness to, how
unhappy would it have made me!</P>
<P>I was stepping out of my chariot yester∣day
morning, when a young woman, who
stood at my door, in an old linen gown,
presented to me a little band-box, open
<PB N="287" REF="288"/>
and fill'd with artificial flowers; she spoke
not, but the silent anguish in her looks drew
my attention. She seemed about eighteen,
and very pretty. As an appearance of in∣dustry
I think doubles the claim which the
poor have to our compassion, I took out of
her box a small sprig of jessamin, very natu∣rally
imitated, and asked the young woman
if she made those flowers herself.</P>
<P>She modestly replied, she did. And can∣not
you, child, said I, find any one who
would give you constant employment in this
way, without wandering about the streets to
dispose of your work?</P>
<P>She answered, Yes, Madam, but I have a
poor decrepid father in jail, who cannot be
without my assistance. I live with him, and
only come out once a week to sell my flowers.
I might go to service, but he would die if
I were to leave him. Her gentle speech,
her youth, and the unaffected tender sor∣row
that appeared in her face, when she
spoke of her father, touched me to the
heart.</P>
<P>I bade her come in, and taking her into
the parlour, was desirous to ask her some
questions.</P>
<P>You look, said I, as if you had not been
bred in poverty; pray, what is your fa∣ther?</P>
<P>She blushed, and with down cast eyes, re∣plied,
a clergyman, Madam.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="289"/>
A clergyman, I repeated what misfor∣tunes
(for such I must suppose they were)
drove him to the distressed situation you
mention?</P>
<P>It <HI>was</HI> a misfortune, Madam, and not any
crime, answered the girl with tears in her
eyes; my father is as good a man as ever
was born.</P>
<P>I asked his name, and she told me it was
Price.</P>
<P>My curiosity was excited by her manner.
I desired her to sit down, and relate to me the
particulars of her story.</P>
<P>She obeyed with a sensible politeness that
pleased me.</P>
<P>About twelve years ago, said she, my fa∣ther
had a little cure in Berkshire; he was
reckoned a fine preacher and a very great
scholar, and what was more than either, one
of the best of men. In the parish to which
my father belonged, lived a gentleman of a
very great estate, his name was Ware; he
was a very worthy man, and had so high an
opinion of my father, that he pitched upon
him to go abroad in quality of governor
to his only son, then a youth of about nine∣teen.
As my father had travelled in the
same capacity once before, he was very well
qualified for the employment; and had no
objection to the acceptance of it, but his
leaving my mother, of whom he was very
fond, and me his only child, then scarce
<PB N="289" REF="290"/>
more than an infant. The elder Mr. Ware
assured him he would be a friend and
guardian to us both (and so he was) and
that he would, in his absence, allow us dou∣ble
the income which my father received
from his cure.</P>
<P>This, together with the appointment,
which he was to receive as his son's gover∣nor
was too handsome an offer to be refused,
especially as the gentleman promised he
should never want a patron in him, while he
lived; and every body knew he had interest
enough to make this promise of consequence.
My father was then past fifty, but as he was
of a very healthy strong constitution, he did
not think it too late to undertake, for the
good of his family, what he said was a very
troublesome task.</P>
<P>I could not help interrupting the young
gentlewoman, to ask her how it came to pass
that her father, such a man as she represent∣ed
him to be, was no better provided for at
his time of life, especially as she said he had
before been intrusted with the care of a pu∣pil,
whom I presumed to be a person of for∣tune,
as scarce any others are sent to travel.</P>
<P>She said, he had a small patrimony of his
own, and that his original design was to stu∣dy
physick; but being persuaded by the
particular love he bore a young gentleman,
to whom he was private tutor at the Univer∣sity,
to go abroad with him, he had for
<PB N="290" REF="291"/>
some years, while they continued on their
travels, been obliged to decline his study.
When he had brought his pupil safe back to
England, he intended to pursue it, and for
this purpose was preparing to go to Leyden;
but the gentleman, who really had an affecti∣on
for him, declared he could not part with
him; and, that if he would consent to stay
and take holy orders, he would get him a
living, which was in his father's gift (a no∣bleman
then alive,) as soon as it should be∣come
vacant, of which there was a good
prospect, on account of the age of the incum∣bent;
and that in the mean time he should
live with him. As the young gentleman had
been married immediately after his return
from his travels to a lady of a vast fortune,
and was settled with a family of his own
about him, my father, who fondly loved
him, did not disrelish the proposal; and,
without much difficulty, consented to it.
He now laid aside the thoughts of physick,
and turned his attention to the study of di∣vinity;
nor was he in haste for the promis∣ed
living's being vacated, as he was resolv∣ed
not to take orders, till he was properly
qualified for the holy profession he was now
destined to. He continued thus <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our years
with his young patron; the gentleman who
possessed the living, though very sickly, still
holding it.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="292"/>
My father being then inclined to go into
orders, his friend got him nominated to a
cure in town, the duties of which he con∣stantly
performed for two years, still living
with his benefactor: but it was his misfor∣tune
then to lose him. He was drowned
in crossing a deep water on horseback, which
he thought was fordable. My poor father
had now lost, as it proved, his best friend;
though he then but lamented him as a son
he loved; and I have heard him say, he was
more afflicted for his death, than his real fa∣ther
was.</P>
<P>As that nobleman was well acquainted
with his son's intentions, in regard to his tu∣tor,
my father had no doubts of his fulfil∣ling
them, especially as he had given his
promise to do so. About this time the cu∣rate
of the parish in Berkshire, which I
mentioned to you before, having a mind to
make an exchange for one in London,
where all his friends lived, proposed it to
my father, who had been at College with
him. As he had now no attachment in
town, and preferred a country life, he rea∣dily
agreed to the change; and having first
waited on the father of his late friend, to
remind him of his promise, which he again
confirmed, he went down to Berkshire.
Here it was he fell in love with my mother,
who was the daughter of the rector, whose
cure he served; she liked him, and as her
<PB N="292" REF="293"/>
father looked upon him as a man certain of
preferment, and every way esteemable in his
character, he did not scruple to give her to
him.</P>
<P>In a few months after their marriage, the
incumbent of the long-promised living died.
My father immediately waited on the no∣bleman,
so sure of success, that he thought
he should have nothing to do, but to thank
him for it; but that Lord told him, with a
pretended concern, that he had disposed of
it, having heard, that my father was well
provided for in Berkshire, and had married
a lady of great fortune.</P>
<P>He returned home shocked and disap∣pointed,
more on account of the family he
had married into, than on his own. He
now found himself at near forty years of age,
with a family coming on him, and no other
provision, than a curacy of forty pounds a
year. My grandfather pretended he had
been deceived by him, and made that ex∣cuse
for withdrawing all his favour from
him. My mother had children pretty fast,
but they all died young, excepting myself;
and, as he loved her too well to let her feel
the inconvenience of streightened circum∣stances,
he was content to let his own little
patrimony, which he had preserved till now,
gradually waste; for my grandfather never
gave her any fortune. At his death, which
happened a few years after, it appeared he
<PB N="293" REF="294"/>
could not, for he left but little behind him.
In this situation my father, having lost all
hope of being better provided for, with
the melancholy reflection of having thrown
away the best part of his days in a fruitless
attendance and expectation, dragged on a
life of obscurity and toil for eleven years,
and then it was that Mr. Ware applied to
him in the manner I have mentioned.</P>
<P>I told this amiable girl, I was glad I had
interrupted the thread of her story, as by
that means she had obliged me with so ma∣ny
interesting particulars of her family, and
then requested she would proceed. She
bowed with a pretty modest grace, and
went on.</P>
<P>I informed you, Madam, that my father,
having accepted of the tuition of Mr. Ware's
son, prepared to attend him on his travels.
He took his leave very reluctantly of my
poor mother and me, whom he tenderly re∣commended
to Mr. Ware's patronage, and
set out with the young gentleman, having
given up his cure, as his absence was to be
of a long continuance.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware, who was a truly good man,
was punctual in the performance of his pro∣mise
towards my mother and me, and be∣haved,
while my father was away, like a se∣cond
parent. His son continued abroad up∣wards
of four years, and returned a very ac∣complished
gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="295"/>
Mr. Ware was exceedingly pleased with
my father's conduct, for which he told him,
both his son and himself owed him the ut∣most
gratitude. He was now far advanced
in years, and grown indolent from infirmi∣ties,
he thought it better to be himself the
rewarder of my father's merit, than take up∣on
him the trouble of solliciting other peo∣ple
to provide for him; and accordingly re∣solved
to give him an annual income of two
hundred pounds during his life. He told
him at the same time, that as his estate was
entailed, it was not in his power to confirm
this grant by a will; but he was sure his son
was too sensible of what he owed him, not to
promise in the most solemn manner to con∣tinue
to him this income, when he should
come to his inheritance. The young gen∣tleman,
who was present, handsomely ac∣knowledged
the obligations he had to my
father, and assured him, he thought he could
never sufficiently repay them.</P>
<P>My father, who now wished for nothing
more than to sit down peaceably on a com∣petency,
thought himself very happy; he re∣tired
to his little house in Berkshire, where
my mother and I still lived, and gave him∣self
up to domestic contentment.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was punctual to his
agreement, constantly paying my father fifty
pounds every quarter▪ He died in some∣thing
less than three years; his son immedi∣ately
<PB N="295" REF="296"/>
on his accession to his fortune, being
at that time in London, wrote my father a
very affectionate letter, assuring him of the
continuance of his friendship. Nor did he
fail in his promise; for two years he was
punctual in his remittances to my father.
He did not, during that time, come down to
Berkshire, having another country-seat, of
which he was fonder. At this time I lost
my dear mother, who had been for some
years in a declining way; and tho' during
her health, as she was an exceedingly good
oeconomist, my father might have laid by
some of his income, yet the frequent jour∣nies
she was prescribed to Bath, and other
places, for change of air, together with the
expence of physicians at home, put it out
of his power to save any thing: which on
my account gave him great uneasiness;
but, as he was still strong and hale, he was
in hopes he might yet live to lay by some∣thing
for me. I was now about fifteen, and
the darling of my father's heart. He was
inconsolable for my mother's death, but I
endeavoured to comfort him, and at last in
some measure succeeded. Mr. Ware, whom
my father had not seen since the death of the
good old gentleman, came down now to
revisit his paternal seat. He would not o∣mit
paying a visit of condolement to his old
friend and tutor, and accordingly came to
our house the day after his arrival in the
<PB N="296" REF="297"/>
country. Though I had seen him before,
as it was in my childhood, I had taken but
little notice of him; he is indeed a handsome
genteel young man.</P>
<P>The innocent girl blushed as she spoke
these words; but I seemed not to observe
it.</P>
<P>She proceeded with a sigh. My father,
who loved him, was rejoiced to see him:
Mr. Ware behaved with a tenderness and
respect, almost filial, towards him, and was
very obliging to me. He continued about
a week in the country, calling to ask my fa∣ther
how he did every day. When he was
about to return to London, he pressed my
father to pass a few weeks with him in
town: you are melancholy here, said he,
changing the scene a little, will divert both
your daughter and you.</P>
<P>My father thanked him for the honour he
did him, but modestly declined it.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware guessed at his motive, and told
him smiling, I know your objection, but, to
obviate it at once, I must tell you, that I have
prevailed on my sister to come and keep
house for me, and I expect to find her at
home on my return. I knew his sister, a
maiden lady, some years older than himself,
who had, on the death of his father, gone to
live with a near relation of theirs. My fa∣ther,
smiling in his turn, told him, he had
guessed his mind rightly, and since that was
<PB N="297" REF="298"/>
the case he would not deprive his poor girl
(looking at me) of the happiness of the good
lady's company for a while.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware said, we might go to town
with him in his coach, and as we had but
little preparation to make, we set out with
him next day.</P>
<P>When we arrived at his house in Lon∣don,
he welcomed us with all the marks
of politeness and respect. I was surprized
we did not see his sister the whole night,
but as she was not apprized of our coming,
I thought that either she was abroad, or had
not yet quitted her friend with whom she
lived.</P>
<P>The next morning, at breakfast, Mr.
Ware made an apology for his sister's ab∣sence.
He said, that the lady, at whose
house she lived, was ill, and that she could
not possibly leave her till she was better,
which he supposed would be in a few
days, as her sickness was no other than
the consequence of her lying-in; mean
while he hoped Mr. Price would not be
uneasy, as he was himself his daughter's
guardian.</P>
<P>Though my father was not pleased at this
excuse, he however concealed his thoughts
from Mr. Ware; but told me if Miss Ware
did not come home in a few days, he pur∣posed
that we should take our leave and re∣turn
into the country.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="299"/>
We had very handsome appartments as∣signed
us; and my father was put in pos∣session
of Mr. Ware's library; a very noble
one, where that gentleman knew he would
pass his most agreeable hours.</P>
<P>For my part, as I did not care to go abroad,
'till I had a proper person for me to appear
with, I declined the offer Mr. Ware oblig∣ingly
made of getting some ladies of his ac∣quaintance
to take me to public places. I
expected his sister every day, and if she
came, as I knew my father purposed staying
a month, I thought I should have time e∣nough
to see every thing; so I chose to en∣tertain
myself with working, and reading in
my own room.</P>
<P>But, Madam, I soon found that Mr.
Ware was a very base man. The third day
after we came to his house, his behaviour to∣wards
me began to change intirely from what
it was before; he took every opportunity of
being particular to me in his compliments.
I received them at first with that distant ci∣vility
which I thought would neither encou∣rage
nor offend; I looked upon him as a
worthy young man, and my father's friend
and benefactor; and thought in my humble
station I should not be too quick at taking
exceptions, as there had nothing as yet ap∣peared
in his behaviour which exceeded the
bounds of respect: but he did not preserve
<PB N="299" REF="300"/>
this long; on the fifth day he came into a
closet where I was reading, and there in the
warmest manner declared himself my lover.
I would fain have turned his discourse into
pleasantry, but he had recourse to oaths and
protestations, and swore he could not live
without my favour. I represented the cruel∣ty
of the insult he offered me in his own
house, and begged he would leave me, as I
was determined to depart immediately. I
will not, Sir, said I, let my father know the
unkind return you have made for all his care
of you, but I can easily prevail with him to
leave your house. He fell at my feet, beg∣ged
my pardon, and talked all that sort of
stuff which I have read in romances. At
length I got him out of the closet, and lock∣ed
the door; resolving never to sit alone,
without using the same precaution while we
staid in his house, which I hoped would not
be above a day or two longer; for I conclud∣ed
there was no sister to come, and that this
was only made use of as a snare to draw us
to town.</P>
<P>As I had a mind to try the young girl, I
asked her, how came you to receive Mr.
Ware's addresses in the manner you men∣tioned:
how did you know but he intended
to marry you?</P>
<P>Ah no, Madam, said she, I could not en∣tertain
such a thought; I have not troubled
<PB N="300" REF="301"/>
you with the particulars of what he said to
me, but young as I was, I knew too well
what it tended to; besides the fear he shewed
lest my father should know of his pretended
courtship, was enough to convince me what
his designs were, without any thing else to
guide me.</P>
<P>Did you like him, I asked? the ingenuous
young woman blushed.</P>
<P>I <HI>could</HI> have liked him, Madam, she re∣plied,
better than any body I had ever seen,
if there had not been such a distance between
us. I desired her to proceed.</P>
<P>I told my father that same evening, that
as I saw there was no likelihood of the lady's
coming to her brother; and as I led but a
melancholy life, having no woman to con∣verse
with, I had much rather be at home
amongst my neighbours and acquaintance,
and begged he would return to Berkshire.</P>
<P>My father said, it was what he had deter∣mined
on after completing our week in town,
unless Miss Ware came in the interim; I
have just told our friend so, said he; he seems
to take it unkindly, and says, he is afraid he
has disobliged me; but I assured him, my
only reason was, that I did not think the
house of a handsome young batchelor, a pro∣per
place for a pretty little country girl, even
though her old father was with her. He as∣sures
me his sister will come, and wants to
<PB N="301" REF="302"/>
protract our stay a few days longer; I hardly
know how to refuse his entreaties, but I shall
be uneasy till we are at home.</P>
<P>I told my father, Mr. Ware had too much
sense to take his refusal amiss, and begged
him to stick to his day.</P>
<P>I gave Mr. Ware no opportunity of speak∣ing
to me the remainder of that day, nor all
the next; though he came to my closet door
where I always sate, and entreated for ad∣mission;
but I was peremptory in my denial,
and he went away reproaching me with
cruelty.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware made an apology to my father,
on account of his being obliged to spend the
evening abroad, the first time that he had
been absent from us since we came to his
house. He had twice entertained us with a
very agreeable concert, at which there was a
great deal of company, both gentlemen and
ladies. He had got it performed at his own
house, on purpose to amuse my father, who
was a great lover of music; but excepting
those two mornings, I had never seen any
company with him, as he said he would not
invite strangers, 'till I had got a companion
of my own sex to keep me in countenance.
My father and I supped alone; we were to
go out of town the next day, and we retired
to our respective chambers about eleven
o'clock, in order to go to bed.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="303"/>
The poor girl paused at this part of her
story, as if she were ashamed to proceed.</P>
<P>I hope, said I, Mr. Ware did not violate
the laws of hospitality, by intruding on you
that night. Oh, Madam, he did, he did,
said she, the vile wretch hid himself some.
where, I know not where, for it was not in
my closet. The house-keeper slept in my
room, in a little tent bed, which had been
put up for that purpose; but she was not as
yet come up stairs. The chamber-maid,
who had attended me to my room, told me
there was a great deal of company to dine
with her master the next day; and as the
house-keeper was very busy in making jellies
and pastry, she was afraid she should sit up
late, and hoped I should not be disturbed at
her coming into the room. I always dis∣missed
the maid immediately, as I was not
used to have a person to undress me, I went
to bed, but not being a very sound sleeper,
and knowing a particularity I had, which
was, that if once rouzed, I could not com∣pose
myself to rest again, I resolved not to
attempt it at all, till the house-keeper came
to bed. I placed the candle on a stand near
me, and took up a book that I found on a
chair, by my bed-side, which I had been
reading in the evening. I had been a∣bout
an hour thus employed, when I heard
somebody treading softly in the room; as I
<PB N="303" REF="304"/>
had not heard the door open, I called
out, in a fright, to know who was there.
I received no answer; but immediately
Mr. Ware presented himself on his knees,
at my bed-side, and half leaning on my
bed. I shrieked out; I knew not what
he said, but I remember the most wicked
of men held me fast, and talked a great
deal; I continued shrieking incessantly,
and struggling to get loose from him,
which at last I did, by giving a violent
spring, which threw me out of bed on the
floor.</P>
<P>I had hurt myself sadly by the fall; but
dragging the quilt off the bed after me,
I wrapped it about me, and shrieked
louder than before. The vile man tried
to pacify me, and said I should disturb my
father.</P>
<P>Providentially for me, my dear father had
not gone to bed, for his room was a great
way from mine, but was reading in the
study, which was over my bed-chamber.
He had heard my shrieks from the first,
but, little dreaming it was his poor daugh∣ter's
voice, he imagined the noise was in the
street, and had lifted up the sash, and look∣ed
out to try whence it proceeded. Finding
every thing quiet without doors, he ran
down stairs, and was led, by my cries, into
my room, for my vile persecutor had not
locked the door, very well knowing none
<PB N="304" REF="305"/>
of his own people could dare to molest
him, and he did not think my cries would
have reached my father's ears, as indeed
they would not, if he had gone to bed.
Think, Madam, what my poor father must
feel, when he saw me on the floor (for I was
notable to rise) such a spectacle of horrour;
my cap was off, and my nose bleeding with
the fall.</P>
<P>The wretch was endeavouring to lift me
up, and I trying to resist him. Good God
defend me! said my father, what is this I
see? Oh, Sir, said I, clinging round him,
carry me out of the house! carry me out
directly from this monster! My father
looked aghast. You do not mean Mr.
Ware, my child, said he, it cannot be <HI>He</HI>
who has put you into this condition? Mr.
Ware quitted the room the minute he saw
my father, which was not till I catched hold
of him; for he had his back to the door,
and, I suppose, was in too much agitation to
hear him coming in.</P>
<P>My poor father, speechless with astonish∣ment,
took me into his arms, and put me
sitting on the bed, then stepping into my
closet, brought out a bottle of water, some
of which he made me drink, and afterwards
washed the blood from my face, which he
soon found only proceeded from my having
hurt my nose a little.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="306"/>
When I had recovered breath enough, I
told him all that had passed. His despair,
Madam, is not to be described; he tore his
hair, and was like a madman. Where is
the ungrateful villain, said he? I will go
this minute and upbraid him with his trea∣chery;
he ran to the chamber door, but it
was locked on the outside. My father thus
prevented from going out, had time to cool
a little; he considered it would be to no pur∣pose
to reproach a powerful tyrant with the
injuries he did us; he resolved to quit the
inhospitable house as soon as any one in the
family was up to open the door to him, and
without ever seeing his face again, commit
himself to providence for his future sub∣sistence.</P>
<P>It would have been happy for us if he
could have executed this design; but the
profligate man prevented us. We spent
the remainder of the night in lamenting our
misery. At day-light Mr. Ware entered the
room in his night-gown, for I suppose he
had gone to rest after he left us.</P>
<P>He told my father he was sorry for what
had passed, and imputed it to his having
drunk too much. I own, said he, I love
your daughter to distraction, and could not
bear the thoughts of losing her, as I found
you resolved to go out of town so suddenly.
My father answered, I will not reproach you
as I ought, but my tender care of your
<PB N="306" REF="307"/>
youth did not deserve this return: suffer us
to depart out of your house, and you shall
never more be troubled with us.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware entreated to speak with my fa∣ther
by himself, and with much difficulty
prevailed on him to go into his study with
him. They staid together near half an
hour, and I heard them talking high; my
father then entered my room with tears
streaming from his eyes. He threw himself
into a chair in an agony of grief. The vil∣lain,
said he, has finished his work—he has
stabbed your father's heart—I ran to him
almost frantic; I thought he had made an
attempt upon his life. When I found he
was not hurt, I asked him the meaning of
his words.</P>
<P>He would have me <HI>sell</HI> you to him, said
he; he would have bribed the father to pro∣stitute
his child. Oh, Sir, said I, why do
we stay under this detested roof? there is no
safety for us here, said he, come, my dear,
let us get out of the house, and then we will
consider which way we are to turn ourselves.</P>
<P>My father laid hold of my hand, and I
followed him, just as I was in my morning
gown. We thought if we could once find
ourselves in the street, we should be happy,
though neither of us knew where to go,
having no acquaintance in London. I had
never been there before, and my father had
<PB N="307" REF="308"/>
been so long absent, that he was forgotten
by every body.</P>
<P>We got out of my room into a little sort
of ante-chamber, but found the door of that
fast locked.</P>
<P>We now gave ourselves up for lost; our
despair is not to be expressed: we sat down,
and consulted what was best to be done. I
saw now there was nothing that our base per∣secutor
would not attempt, and I told my
father I was resolved at all events to make
my escape.</P>
<P>He said that the shocking wretch had gi∣ven
him till the next day to consider of his
proposal; and he hoped, by that time, both
father and daughter would come enough to
their senses, to think he had made them a
very advantageous offer.</P>
<P>I told him in that lucky interval I hoped
to be able to effect my deliverance; which
I thought I might accomplish, with his assist∣ance,
by tying the sheets of my bed toge∣ther,
and so from the window, sliding into
the street.</P>
<P>We were both pleased with this expedient;
but the next thing to be considered was,
what place I shouid go to, as I could not
make this attempt till late at night, and must
go alone; for my father being in years, and
pretty corpulent, I could not think of let∣ting
him run the same hazard, which might
have put his life into imminent danger, es∣pecially
<PB N="308" REF="309"/>
as I could not give him the same
help which he could afford me. This was
a difficulty, till I recollected a mantua-maker,
who was then making some cloaths for me;
and I happened to know where she lived.
To her house I resolved to go (having first
settled all my previous steps) and to remain
concealed there till my father should get an
opportunity of coming to me. I told him
as I was the unhappy object on whom Mr.
Ware had designs, I supposed he would not
detain my father after I was gone. He
shook his head, but said, he hoped he would
not.</P>
<P>Having now settled our little plan, we
were more composed. A servant brought
breakfast into my apartment at the usual
hour, and dinner, and supper, in the like
manner. We did not appear troubled, but
as carefully avoided seeming chearful, for
fear of giving suspicion.</P>
<P>The house-keeper was generally the last
person up in the family; so that I was either
to seize the opportunity before she came up
to my room, or wait till she was asleep.
The last I thought the securest method, as
she was an extremely sound sleeper. I lifted
up the sash in the bed-chamber, to be in
readiness, and closed the shutters again.</P>
<P>Very fortunately my father, having re∣ceived
his quarterly payment from Mr.
Ware just before we came to town, had fifty
<PB N="309" REF="310"/>
guineas in his purse, half of which he in∣sisted
on my taking in case of any emergency.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock the house keeper
came into the room where we were sitting,
as she was obliged to pass through that to go
to the room where she lay.</P>
<P>We heard her at the door, and my father
suddenly changing the subject of our dis∣course,
made me a sign which I understood;
and as the woman entered, affected to be
representing to me the charms of wealth and
grandeur, whilst I seemed to listen with a
fort of pleasure to him. He stopped when
the woman came in, but not till he was sure
she had heard what he said, for we ob∣served
she staid at the out side of the door
a little while, as if to listen to our conver∣sation.
On seeing us engaged in discourse,
she made a motion to withdraw, saying she
would come up again when Mr. Price
was retired to rest; but I told her she might
if she pleased, then go to bed, as we should
not sit up long. But as I suppose she had
orders to lock me in after my father had
left me, she did not chuse to do this. She
said she was not sleepy, but would come
up in half an hour, and left the room
smiling.</P>
<P>This was an opportunity which I thought
was not to be lost. I repaired to the win∣dow,
and hearing a watchman cry the hour,
<PB N="310" REF="311"/>
I waited till he came under it, and having
prepared a piece of paper, in which I had
put a weight to carry it down, I lighted it
and dropped it at his feet; it was fastened
to a string, and at some distance from it
above, was fastened another large piece of
white paper folded up, in which I put a
guinea, and in two lines written in a large
plain hand, beseeched him to assist me in get∣ting
down, for which I would reward him
with another guinea.</P>
<P>The lighted paper (as I concluded it would)
attracted the man's notice; he stopped and
took it up, and finding another paper hang∣ing
to the string, looked up at the window.
I leaned my body out as far as I could,
and in a low voice, but loud enough for him
to hear me, bid him read it. He opened
the paper, and, by the light of his own
lantern, read the lines, at the same time
taking out the guinea, which I could per∣ceive
he also eximined by the same light.
He then said, I'll help you, stay a little.</P>
<P>He made what haste he could away, and
I was now afraid he intended to leave me,
and return no more. My terror was inex∣pressible
during the man's absence, especially
as several people in that interval passed by;
however, he soon returned with a compa∣nion;
and the street being now clear, I saw
he had brought a sort of plank, or board,
under his arm, which he fixed from the
<PB N="311" REF="312"/>
iron pallisadoes across to the stone work
which jutted out from the bottom of the
lower windows; on this he without difficulty
mounted, and being now much nearer to me,
he told me he would receive me, if I could
contrive to get down to him.</P>
<P>My poor father hastily kissed, and blessed
me, and having my apparatus ready for de∣scending;
he had the farther precaution to
fix some strong ribbons, which I had tied
together for the purpose, under my arms;
these he held in his hands, whilst I slid down
by the sheets which I had fastened together
corner-ways with a knot.</P>
<P>The trusty watchman caught me in his
arms, and lifted me over the pallisados, to
his comrade, who set me safely down in the
street.</P>
<P>It was very dark, but I could distinguish
when my father drew in the linen, and heard
him shut the window. I then told my deli∣verer
that I must beg a farther act of kind∣ness
from him, which was to see me safe to
the street where I wanted to go.</P>
<P>He readily complied, and leaving it to
his comrade to carry away the plank, took
me under the arm, and we got without be∣ing
molested to the mantua-maker's house.</P>
<P>The family were all in bed; when after
repeated knocking, a maid looked out of an
upper window, and asked us what we want∣ed.
I told her an acquaintance of her mis∣tress
<PB N="312" REF="313"/>
had urgent business with her, and beg∣ged
she would step down and speak to me
from the parlour window. After keeping
me a long while waiting, she at length came
down; I then gave the watchman the other
guinea I had promised him, and dismissed
him, very well pleased with his night's ad∣venture.</P>
<P>After he was gone, I told the woman my
name, and begged she would let me in,
which she immediately did. I without scru∣ple
acquainted her with the manner of my
escape, and the occasion of it; she was
shocked and affected with my story, and
promised to keep me concealed till my fa∣ther
should come to carry me to some place
of greater safety; for she said, as Mr. Ware's
house-keeper was her acquaintance, I might
be discovered at her house.</P>
<P>This terrified me exceedingly, but the
good natured woman gave me the most so∣lemn
assurances that I should be safe for the
short time she supposed I should stay with
her. She invited me to part of her bed, as
she told me she had never a spare one, and
I readily accepted of her offer.</P>
<P>I remained all the next day in the utmost
grief and anxiety, at hearing nothing from
my poor father. In the evening of the se∣cond
day, a porter brought a letter to the
mantua-maker, which served only as a co∣ver
for a note directed to me. Seeing it
<PB N="313" REF="314"/>
writ in my father's hand, I eagerly opened it;
but oh, Madam, how shall I tell you my
grief, and horrour, when I saw it dated from
a prison! My poor father told me, that our
cruel persecutor, enraged at my escape, which
he did not discover 'till next day, had charged
my father with it, who immediately acknow∣ledged
he had assisted in delivering me from
ruin; that Mr. Ware, after treating him
with the most injurious language, demanded
payment of him for the sums he said he had
lent him from time to time since his father's
death.</P>
<P>To this my father making no other reply,
than that Mr. Ware knew he had it not in
his power to refund any of that money,
which, though it was a free gift he would
restore sooner than lie under any obligation to
such a base man, the villain was barbarous
enough to have him arrested, and sent to jail,
where he said he should remain, 'till his stub∣born
spirit should be glad to yield up his
daughter to him.</P>
<P>My father desired me to come to him di∣rectly,
and to bring some body with me to
protect me by the way. I instantly obeyed,
and sending for a hackney coach, the mantua-maker
got her husband, a decent tradesman,
and his apprentice to accompany me. We
drove directly to my poor father's melan∣choly
habitation, where they delivered me
safe into his hands. His joy at seeing me a∣gain,
<PB N="314" REF="315"/>
made him for a while forget the sorrows
which surrounded us.</P>
<P>He told me, that after he had seen me get
safe into the street, and had recommended me
to the care of providence, he had put every
thing out of the way which had assisted me
in my escape; and putting out one of the
candles left it in my room, that the house-keeper,
when she came up, might suppose me
in bed; he then went to his own. He con∣cluded
that the woman, when she went into
my room, supposed me asleep. Mr. Ware
was at home the whole evening, and had be∣fore
that retired to rest, so that there was no
discovery made that night.</P>
<P>My father now informed me that Mr.
Ware had said, when he first made the odious
proposal to him, that if I complied, he would
allow my father four hundred pounds a year,
and settle the like sum upon me for life; at
the same time, in case of refusal, insinuating
the threat which he afterwards put in execu∣tion.
Thinking, no doubt, he should by
this intimidate my poor father so much, that
upon reflexion he would use his endeavours
to prevail on me to comply; and it was for
this wicked purpose he was permitted, or
rather compelled, to pass the whole day with
me. I would not, added my father, relate
this particular to you, for fear your tender∣ness
to me might shake your virtue: but the
trial, God be praised! is now past; you are
<PB N="315" REF="316"/>
here, my poor child, at least in safety. We
have some money to support us for a while,
perhaps the wicked wretch may relent. If
he gives me my liberty I may still obtain
a livelihood; and if I can get you receiv∣ed
into some worthy family, that will pro∣tect
you from his violence, I shall be con∣tented.</P>
<P>My father, unwilling to expose his un∣grateful
pupil, and thinking when he cooled
a little he would be ashamed of his conduct
and release him, resolved not to apprise any
of his friends in Berkshire of his situation;
but wrote a long expostulatory letter to Mr.
Ware, which he concluded with requesting
no other favour but his liberty.</P>
<P>To this, Mr. Ware wrote in answer, that
he was still ready to make good his first pro∣posals,
and since he now found he had got
his daughter with him, he should obtain his
liberty on no other terms.</P>
<P>My father still loth to believe him so lost
to humanity as to persist in this barbarous re∣solution,
patiently waited another month; at
the end of which he again wrote him a very
affecting letter; but to this he received no
answer, being told Mr. Ware was gone into
Berkshire. He wrote to two or three gen∣tlemen
of his acquaintance there, informing
them of his deplorable situation, and beg∣ging
them to use their influence with Mr.
Ware in his behalf. He did not disclose
<PB N="316" REF="317"/>
the enormity of his behaviour, but only said,
that on a quarrel he had with him, he had
confined him under colour of a debt, which
it was not in his power to discharge; this he
did as much in tenderness to Mr. Ware's
character, as to avoid exasperating him more
against him.</P>
<P>He ordered me at the same time to write
to an old maid servant, who took care of our
little house in the country, to send me my
cloaths, my father's books, and such other
things as belonged to him. As I had come
to town but for a month, and was in deep
mourning for my mother, I had left the
best part of my apparel behind me, and I had
taken nothing with me from Mr. Ware's
but a little bundle of linen; my father had
been permitted to carry his with him to the
prison.</P>
<P>As the furniture in this little house was of
no great value, my father having purchased
it as it stood in the house of the former
curate, he made a present of it to this old
servant, who had lived with him from the
time he married.</P>
<P>He received no answer to any of the letters
he wrote to the gentlemen; but I got a letter
from this old servant, at the same time that
she sent the things which I wrote for. And
you will scarce believe, Madam, to what a
height this abandoned wretch carried his
crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="318"/>
Not contented with having plunged my
poor father and me into the deepest distress,
he endeavoured to blast and destroy our
characters in the country. He gave out
that my father, taking advantage of his
(Mr. Ware's) being a little overcome with
wine one night, had put his daughter to bed
to him, and would have insisted the next day
that he had married them. To punish the
ungrateful designing old rogue, he said,
he had put him into jail, where he intend∣ed
to keep him a month or two till he re∣pented.</P>
<P>Though the respectable character my fa∣ther
bore in his neighbourhood made this
story incredible, yet Mr. Ware's power and
influence was such, that people seemed to
believe it, and applauded Mr. Ware's cle∣mency
in my father's punishment. No
wonder then his letters were unanswered;
they were shewn to Mr. Ware, and laughed
at. The old servant who was sure we were
both cruelly belied, lamented our unhappy
fate, but poor creature she could do nothing
<HI>but</HI> lament. This last blow quite subdued
my father's courage; he fell sick upon it, and
languished many weeks in a most melancholy
condition.</P>
<P>When he recovered a little from his sick∣ness,
he was suddenly struck with the dead
palsey on one side, by which he lost the use of
<PB N="318" REF="319"/>
his right hand; so that I am obliged to dress
and undress him like a child.</P>
<P>When the money which we had brought
with us to the prison was spent, we were
obliged to sell most of my father's books,
and the best of my cloaths.</P>
<P>We had repeated messages from the mer∣ciless
man, by his vile house-keeper, who used
all her rhetorick to persuade us to compliance;
but my father constantly repulsed her, with
contempt and indignation; 'till at length
Mr. Ware, tired, I believe, with persecuting
us, left us to perish in peace. He supposed
my father could not hold out long, and he
then concluded I should be at his mercy;
for, as I never stirred out of the jail, he had
no hopes of getting me into his power whilst
my poor father lived.</P>
<P>If I had even had a place of refuge to go
to, I could not think of leaving him in the
wretched helpless condition to which he was
now reduced. I thought therefore of apply∣ing
myself to something, by which I could
obtain bread for our support. I set about
making those little artificial flowers, which
had formerly been one of my amusements;
and a woman, who was confined in the same
prison with us, and worked for some shops,
undertook to dispose of them for me. She
had a daughter, who came often to see her,
and used to carry her work and mine to the
people who bespoke it.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="320"/>
In this manner we have languished, Ma∣dam,
near eighteen months; when hearing
lately that Mr. Ware was gone to Bath, and
the girl who used to visit her mother being
sick, I ventured out myself with the work.
The person who employs us did live in the
city, but has lately taken a shop in this
street; and though it is a journey from
what I now call my dismal home, I have
come to her once a week, for this month
past, with the product of my own, and, I
may say, my fellow prisoner's labours. She
this day told me she was overstocked with
such flowers as I brought her, and, having
picked out a few of the best of them, she
left those, which you see in the band-box,
upon my hands. I was returning home
very disconsolate, when, to avoid your cha∣riot,
which drew up close to the house, I
stood upon one of your steps, not knowing
it was going to stop; and something in
your countenance, Madam, I know not how,
encouraged me to offer my little ware to
you.</P>
<P>I have given you this affecting story, my
Cecilia, pretty nearly in the girl's own words.
I was much moved by it. If this be all fact,
said I, what monsters are there among man∣kind!</P>
<P>She replied, It was all very true.</P>
<P>Though the girl was very young, and, as
I told you, had a modest and ingenuous
<PB N="320" REF="321"/>
look, yet, as I had seen such cheating faces
before, I would not yield up my belief impli∣citly.
This story might be invented to move
compassion, at least, the most material cir∣cumstances
of it; and though I could not
suppose she had contrived it on the spot, yet
I did not know but it might have been con∣trived
for her.</P>
<P>I have a mind to see your father, child,
said I.</P>
<P>She answered, quite composed, Then,
Madam, you will see an object, that would
greatly move your pity.</P>
<P>She rose up as she spoke this, saying her
poor father would be very uneasy at her stay∣ing
so long, and was preparing to go.</P>
<P>I was seized with a strong inclination to
visit this unhappy father directly. If, said I,
the case be as she represents it, I cannot be
too speedy in my relief; and, if she has falsifi∣ed
in any thing, I shall probably detect her,
by not giving her an opportunity of seeing
and preparing him first.</P>
<P>It was not more than eleven o'clock; and
I resolved not to defer the charity I intended.
I desired the young woman to stay a while,
and ordering Patty to bring down a plain
black silk hood and scarf of her own, I made
the poor girl, to her great astonishment, put
them on. I then ordered a hackney coach
to be called, and said, I would go with her to
her father. She looked surprized, but not
<PB N="321" REF="322"/>
startled, which made a favourable impression
on me. She appeared decent, and I desired
her to get into the coach, which I ordered,
according to her direction, to drive to the
jail, where her father was confined.</P>
<P>When we arrived at this mansion of hor∣rour,
for so it appeared to me, I let her go
up stairs before me. She stopped at a door,
and said that was the room where her father
lay. I bid her go in first; she entered, and
I stood without-side the door, where (as the
lobby was dark) I could not readily be per∣ceived.</P>
<P>I saw there a man of about sixty; and,
as she had told me her father was corpu∣lent,
I did not at first take him to be the
person, for he looked worn out, pale, and
emaciated. He wore his own grisled hair,
and had on a cassock, girded about him with
a silk sash. One of his hands was slung in
a black crape; he sat pensively, leaning on
a table, with a book open before him, which
seemed to be the Bible.</P>
<P>Upon his daughter's going into the room,
he lifted up his eyes to see who it was: he
had a fine countenance; candour and since∣rity
were painted on it.</P>
<P>My dear, you made a long stay, said he,
in a melancholy voice, I was afraid some∣thing
had happened to you. What has de∣tained
you?</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, said she, looking towards the
<PB N="322" REF="323"/>
door, I believe I met with a good angel, who
is come to visit you in prison.</P>
<P>I entered at these words: the venerable
man rose.—A good angel indeed, if her
mind be like her face! He bowed respect∣fully.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, keep your seat.</P>
<P>I took a chair, and placed myself by him.
He did not seem in the least embarrassed,
but gravely, and modestly demanded to what
it was that he owed the honour of a visit
from a lady of my appearance; for, said he,
affluence and prosperity seldom seek the
dwellings of the wretched.</P>
<P>I informed him, that having met with his
daughter by accident, she had given me a
melancholy account of his situation, and that
I wished to hear the particulars from his own
mouth. He made an apology for the length
of his story; but said, if I had patience, he
would relate it. I told him, I had come for
that purpose.</P>
<P>He then repeated to me every particular,
as I had before heard them from his daughter,
enlarging on certain passages, which she had
but slightly touched upon. He shewed me
the copies of his two letters to Mr. Ware,
and that gentleman's answer to the first, as
also the old servant's letter to his daughter,
which convinced me of the truth of every
thing he had said.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="324"/>
I asked Mr. Price, what Mr. Ware's de∣mand
on him might amount to?</P>
<P>He said, four hundred pounds, which was
what he had received from him, since his
father's death.</P>
<P>Take courage, Sir, said I, you shall not
long remain here.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, cried he, may God be the
rewarder of your goodness! but my enemy is
a hardened man; he is not to be influenced by
honour or virtue.</P>
<P>I perceived by this that the poor gentle∣man
had no thought of my paying his debt,
but supposed I would endeavour to soften
Mr. Ware in his favour. Have a little pa∣tience,
said I, and we will try what is to be
done.</P>
<P>I requested he would give me Mr. Ware's
letter, wherein he promised to make good his
first proposal, if he would consent to yield
up his daughter to him.</P>
<P>I took my leave, and slipped my purse,
which had ten guineas in it, into his daugh∣ter's
hand as I went down stairs.</P>
<P>As soon as I returned home, I sent for
Mr. Warner, and related to him circumstan∣tially
the distress of this worthy father and
child. His honest indignation burst forth
against the base betrayer of them both; honest
I must call it, though he vented his wrath in
oaths and execrations on his head.</P>
<P>These are proper objects said I, to exercise
<PB N="324" REF="325"/>
our humanity on; I mean to pay his debt, and
make the remnant of his days comfortable.
You are a good girl, said he, you know my
purse is open to you.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, said I, there is no need to tax
your generosity upon this occasion, the two
thousand pounds you so lately gave me is but
little diminished. Psha, psha, said he, I gave
you that to make ducks and drakes of; it is
not to go into the account; you know your
quarter's income is commenced, you may
have what you will.</P>
<P>I begged he would immediately write to
Mr. Ware, who is now at Bath, and make
him a tender of his money, that we might
get the poor man discharged from confine∣ment
as soon as possible.</P>
<P>I gave him that vile fellow's letter, and
advised him to let him know that he was ac∣quainted
with the whole truth of the story;
which, perhaps, might frighten him into
better terms than insisting on his whole de∣mand.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner said, there was a merchant of
his acquaintance at Bristol, to whom he would
write immediately, and order him to pay the
money directly, if it was insisted on. He
said he knew his friend would readily under∣take
the thing, and execute it as soon as
possible.</P>
<P>He called for pen, ink, and paper, and
wrote before me the following letter to his
<PB N="325" REF="326"/>
correspondent, which as he left it with me to
seal, and send to the post-office, I first co∣pied.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I beg immediately on the receipt of this,
you will take the trouble of riding to Bath,
and there enquire for a man of fortune,
one Ware, who is the greatest villain in
England, and you may tell him I say so.
He had kept a poor honest clergyman
starving in jail this year and a half, because
he would not sell his daughter to him. He
pretends the parson owes him four hundred
pounds, which is a lie; for though he re∣ceived
that sum from him, it was paid him
for value received by agreement. How∣ever,
as the man can have no redress, I
request you will immediately tender him
that sum, and get a discharge, for I will
have the poor fellow out.”</P>
<P>“I herewith send you inclosed a letter
which that scoundrel Ware wrote; pray
shew it to him, as a token that the parson's
case is known, and that he has got friends to
stand by him.”</P>
<P>“Your speedy execution of this affair, and
answer, will oblige,</P>
<CLOSER>Your friend and servant,
<SIGNED>EDWARD WARNER.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<PB N="326" REF="327"/>
<OPENER>To Mr. William Blow, merchant, at Bristol.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Feb. 14, 1707-8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>My honest kinsman desired I would imme∣diately
send this letter off! I suppose his cor∣respondent
will have more discretion than to
let Mr. Ware see the contents, but I hope we
shall have a good account of this negotiation.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 22.—I have been very impatient,
my Celicia, for an answer to Mr. Warner's
odd letter, and this day he received one.
His friend at Bristol I take it for granted acted
very prudently, for he says, that having <HI>waited</HI>
on Mr. Ware (which word Mr. Warner took
great exceptions to) he acquainted him with
his commission, and at the same time pro∣duced
his letter to Mr. Price by way of iden∣tifying
the person, as Mr. Ware at first seem∣ed
not to recollect any thing of the matter.
He said Mr. Ware blushed upon seeing his
own letter, in the hands of a stranger; Aye,
I remember the silly affair now, said he; the
man is an old hypocrite, and his daughter is
a young one; but as I never meant to ruin
him, I will forgive him the debt; and accor∣dingly
wrote a full acquittal, which the mer∣chant
transmitted with his answer.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained but to pay the usual
fees, and get the poor old gentleman out as
fast as we could. Mr. Warner undertook to
do what was proper on the occasion, and in∣stantly
set about it with an alacrity that shewed
the goodness of his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="328"/>
How wonderfully shame operates on some
minds! this wretched man, Ware, whom
neither the laws of God nor man could re∣strain,
has, by this single passion alone been
subdued. He found his base conduct was
known by people whom he could not impose
on; and his forgiving the pretended debt,
no doubt was meant as a bribe to prevent his
disgrace from being propagated; for though
he could sit down and enjoy himself under
the accumulated guilt of fraud, perfidy,
cruelty, oppression, and ingratitude; he was
not proof against the reproach and ridicule
of the world. This shews at least that he
was not long practised in crimes of this sort.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 24.—I did not see Mr. Warner
again till this morning, when he entered my
room making flourishes with his hands.</P>
<P>Mr. Price and his daughter were with him
—Here they are for you, said he, and it has
done my heart good to deliver such honest
people from their misery.</P>
<P>The good old man poured forth such ser∣vent
prayers, and thanks for my kindness to∣wards
them, that my heart exulted with rap∣ture,
at being the means of conferring such
happiness, as this worthy parent and child
seemed to enjoy. The young girl's gratitude
was silent, but not less ardent than her father's.
She had kneeled down before me, and kissed
my hands. I was greatly touched with the
<PB N="328" REF="329"/>
humility and tenderness of her acknowlege∣ment.</P>
<P>I put an end to the grateful effusions of
these honest hearts. I have done but little
for you, said I, as yet; as Mr. Ware had the
grace to refuse the offered sum, I shall apply
that money which I intended for him, to your
future use, or your liberty will avail you but
little.</P>
<P>We shall think of some method of settling
you comfortably for life; in the mean while
your daughter and you shall be welcome to
live with me.</P>
<P>I stopped him from renewing his thanks,
and insisted on his saying no more on that
subject. The poor old gentleman is extreme∣ly
feeble and languishing from his long con∣finement,
but I hope with proper care, as
he is naturally strong, he will recover his
health.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 1.—What a true delight springs
from benevolent actions, my dear! I never
experienced such heart-felt satisfaction as I
have received from restoring comfort to these
truly deferring people. I have bought the
young lady some new cloaths, plain, but gen∣teel;
and you cannot imagine what a pretty
creature she is, now she is dressed. I find the
old gentleman a man of admirable under∣standing,
and great reading. He has a sim∣plicity
in his manner that is truly engaging,
but at the same time a politeness that shews
<PB N="329" REF="330"/>
he is no stranger to the great world. Of his
integrity he has given convincing proofs.
Praised be the Lord! who has made me, and
honest Mr. Warner, the instruments of deli∣vering
such a man from the depths of afflicti∣on.
He mends apace in his health, but I am
afraid he will never recover the use of his
hand; though as it is not painful, it seems not
to give him any uneasiness.—</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 10.—I am infinitely charmed with
the conversation of this couple; for the girl
is very sensible, and prettily accomplished, I
wish she were married to some honest man
that knew her value; for I find she has still
terrors on Mr. Ware's account, nor is her
father without his apprehensions.</P>
<P>He said to me to-day, if I were to die, Ma∣dam,
I would conjure you as my last request
to take my daughter into your service. With
such a pattern before her she must be virtuous,
and with such a protector I am sure she would
be safe.</P>
<P>I told him he might rely on me, but that I
hoped he would live long enough to see her
happily disposed of in marriage.</P>
<P>If I could see that day, said he, I should
then have no other worldly care to disturb
me.</P>
<P>Here, my dearest Cecilia, I will close my
very long narrative. The pacquet is already
swelled to an enormous size, but you never
think them too large.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="331"/>
<HI>April</HI> 14—After so many trifles, my dear,
as my journal for nearly a month past contain∣ed,
you will be glad of something a little
more serious. I mentioned in my last week's
journal, that I had cast my eyes on a young
man, who I thought would make a suitable
match for Miss Price, if he were approved
of by her, and her father. This person is a
linen draper in the strand, a second brother
of my Patty's. You can't have forgot Harry
Main, my dear, whom we both knew when
a boy, remarkable for a sober behaviour, mo∣desty,
and sweetness of temper. He is just
now out of his time, and his eldest brother
has set him up in a handsome shop. You
may be sure I am his customer. 'Tis on this
lad then that I have turned my thoughts, as
a fit husband for the amiable girl. I went
yesterday morning to buy some linen for
Miss Price, and carried her with me, as I had
done once or twice before. After we had
made our markets, I told young Main, with
a freedom which a long acquaintance gave
me, that I thought he was so well settled, he
wanted nothing but a good wife to complete
his happiness. He replied, he should think
himself very happy, if he could light on some
good young woman as a partner for life. Why
do you not look out for one, said I? they are
not so hard to become at. I believe, Madam,
he answered, I must get some one else to do it
for me, my friends laugh at me and say I
<PB N="313" REF="332"/>
am too bashful to speak for myself; but I
fancy were I to meet with a person that really
touched my heart, I should make a shift to find
courage enough to tell her so.</P>
<P>And have you never yet seen such a person,
said I? he blushed, and by an involuntary
motion his eyes were turned on Miss Price, of
whom I concluded his sister Patty, as she
often visits him, had given him the history.
He said if I commanded him to tell his secret,
I should know it another time.</P>
<P>This was enough; I asked in a jocose way,
would he take a wife of my chusing? sooner
than any body's in the world, Madam, he
replied.</P>
<P>We took our leave, and I asked Patty
when I went home, whether she had ever
mentioned any thing about Miss Price to her
brother? poor Patty coloured for fear she had
committed a fault, but owned directly she
had told him every circumstance of her story;
her brother having been very inquisitive
about her, from the first time he had seen
her with me; and added, that she believed
he was downright in love with her.</P>
<P>I told her if Miss Price liked her brother,
and her father did not disapprove the match,
I saw no reason why they might nod make
each other happy, as I should give Miss
Price a fortune worth the young man's ac∣ceptance.</P>
<P>Patty said, she was sure her brother would
<PB N="332" REF="333"/>
rejoice at the offer, and that she herself
could not wish him to make a better choice.</P>
<P>It only remained now to know how the
young lady herself stood affected towards him.
I put Patty (for whom Miss Price had con∣ceived
a great affection) upon this task. I
thought she would speak her mind with less
reserve to her, as I feared the obligation she
thought herself under to me, might have such
an influence on her gratitude, as to prevent
that freedom which I wished her to use; for I
was resolved not to put the least shadow of
constraint on her inclinations.</P>
<P>Patty succeeded so well, that without seem∣ing
to have any design in it, she drew a con∣fession
from Miss Price very much in her bro∣ther's
favour.</P>
<P>Being now sure that the young people liked
each other, I thought I might open my design
to the old gentleman, which I did in few
words. How the good man was delighted
with the happy prospect which his deservedly
belov'd daughter had before her! he has
left the affair intirely to me, so that I hope
to have the girl disposed of very much to all
our satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 18.—I am charmed with Mr. War∣ner's
noble behaviour, I claim an interest,
said he, in these honest creatures that you
have taken under your protection. I like
the old fellow mightily, and admire the little
girl so much, that if you had not provided a
<PB N="333" REF="334"/>
better husband for her, I should have been
half tempted to have taken her myself; but
since it is as it is, we must do handsomely by
her.</P>
<P>I told him I had enquired into the young
man's circumstances, and found that about
a thousand pounds would set him forward
extremely well, and that this was the portion
I intended to give him with the young gen∣tlewoman.</P>
<P>Well, said he, I believe that will do; but
I must make the poor thing a present myself
for wedding trinkets. And the old man too,
must we not take care of him?</P>
<P>Dear Sir, said I, how good you are? you
would remind me of my duty, if I myself
were forgetful of it. But I have already set∣tled
a hundred pounds a year on him.</P>
<P>Is that enough, said he? will it make the
good fellow easy?</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, it exceeds his wishes; he intends
to live with his daughter, as his growing in∣firmities
require her tender care.</P>
<P>Every thing is to be this day settled, Mr.
Price is exceedingly pleased with his son-in-law
elect; and the wedding will be no longer
delayed, than till Mr. Main receives the
answers to those letters which he has wrote to
his friends in the country, to apprize them of
his approaching marriage.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 26.—I am sure my dear Cecilia will
rejoice with her friend in the acquisition she
<PB N="334" REF="335"/>
has received to her own happiness by confer∣ring
so much on a worthy family. The bride
is this day gone home to her own house;
her delighted father with her. Their prayers
and blessings poured out from truly grateful
and virtuous hearts, remain with me. A
reward, my dear, and a rich one too, for the
self-satisfying part I have acted.</P>
<P>My worthy Patty, whose merit alone raises
her much above her station, I shall no longer
consider as my servant. She has been my
friend in the tenderest and most enlarged
sense of the word, and she shall continue so.
I have hired another maid to wait on me,
and with a sort of merry ceremony enfran∣chised
Patty, on the day of her brother's
marriage; for I had her dressed elegantly as
bride's maid to her new sister, and she sat on
her right-hand at the wedding-dinner. I look
on her as my companion, but I cannot per∣suade
her to forget that I was her mistress.
She shews this by actions, not by words.</P>
<P>[Here follows an interval of thirteen
months, in which nothing material to the
thread of the story occurs. The journal con∣tains
only a continued series of such actions,
as shewed the noble and pious use which Mrs.
Arnold made of the great fortune which pro∣vidence
had blessed her with. The rest is
filled up with a variety of little incidents, many
of them relative to her brother and his lady,
to Mr. Warner, and several letters from
<PB N="335" REF="336"/>
Lady V—, with whom she constantly
corresponded. At the end of that period the
journals proceed thus.]</P>
<P><DATE>1709.</DATE></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 28.—And shall I really be so blessed,
my ever beloved Cecilia, as to see you at the
time you mention? Oh, my dear, after an
absence of six long years, how my heart
bounds with joy at your approach! the two
months that are to intervene before we meet
will appear very tedious to me. But it is al∣ways
so with happiness that is within our view.
Before I expected you, though I regretted
your absence, yet did I patiently acquiesce
under it, and could entertain my thoughts
with other objects; but I am now, I cannot
tell you how anxious and impatient to see you.
And yet, my Cecilia, we shall have nothing
new to say to each other, knowing as we both
do, every circumstance of each other's life
since we parted. Mine has been a strange
one; but my lot is now fallen on a fair ground,
where, I hope, it will please heaven to con∣tinue
me whilst I am to remain in this world.
The noble, I may almost call it, princely for∣tune
that my kinsman has settled on me, will
enable me to leave my children greatly provi∣ded
for, whenever it shall be God's pleasure
to call me away. Let me but live to em∣brace
my Cecilia, and then, providence, thy
will be done!</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="337"/>
<HI>April</HI> 29.—Gracious God! for what am I
yet reserved? My trembling hand can scarce
hold my pen, but I will try to tell you the
event which yesterday produced.</P>
<P>I was but just set down to dinner; no body
with me but Patty and my children. A note
was brought in to me, which, they said, came
by a porter, who waited for an answer. I
opened and read it. My eyes were struck
with the unlooked-for name of Orlando
Faulkland at the bottom; the contents filled
me with terror and surprize. I know not
what I have done with the note, but he in∣formed
me in it that he was just arrived in
town, and begged I would appoint an hour
that evening to see him alone, adding, that
his arrival was, and must be, a secret to every
body but me.</P>
<P>Troubled and shocked as I was, I returned
for answer, by the same messenger, that I
should expect him at six o'clock. I need not
tell you how I passed the interval till that
hour. It was impossible for me, amidst a
thousand conjectures, to form one which
could probably occasion this amazing visit.
So strangely introduced! so unthought of!
and from one I imagined to be in another
kingdom.</P>
<P>Precisely at six o'clock, I heard a coachstop
at the door; Patty was in the way to receive
him, and presently Mr. Faulkland himself en∣tered
the drawing-room, Distraction was in
<PB N="337" REF="338"/>
his looks! I rose to receive him, but shook
from head to foot; and I felt the blood for∣saking
my face. He ran to me, as if with a
design to salute me, but started back without
making the offer. I made a motion to a chair
for him, and sat down myself, for I was not
able to stand. You are welcome to England,
Sir, I am glad to see you—scarce knowing
what I said. I hope your lady is well? He
looked wildly as if in horror at the question.
Then suddenly catching both my hands, he
fell on his knees before me, his eyes fixed
mournfully on my face, and it was some time
before he could answer.</P>
<P>I could not speak; I burst into tears:—
there was something dreadful in his silence.
He kissed both my hands, but I withdrew
them from him. Sir, Sir, speak I conjure you.
You shock me to death! I see I have, said
he, and I am afraid to proceed: you will die
at the relation. For God's sake, Sir, explain
yourself.—</P>
<P>You see a man, said he, whose life is forfeit∣ed
to the law.—My wife is dead—and by my
hand—</P>
<P>I don't know whether he said more, for I
fainted away. It seems he did not call for
any help, but by his own endeavours at last
brought me to myself, and I found him weep∣ing
bitterly over me.</P>
<P>The sound of the last horrid words I had
<PB N="338" REF="339"/>
heard him speak still rung in my ears. I begged
him to explain them.</P>
<P>That wife, said he, that woman whom <HI>you</HI>
persuaded me to marry, I caught in adultery,
and I punished the villain that wronged me
with death. She shared in his fate tho' with∣out
my intending it. For this act of justice,
which the law will deem murder, I myself must
die, and I am come but to take a last look.—
What recompence then can you make the
man, whom you have brought to misery,
shame, and death?</P>
<P>His looks, and the tone of voice with which
he spoke this, made my blood run cold, and
my heart die within me.</P>
<P>I wrung my hands, and redoubling my tears,
I do not need your reproaches, said I, to make
me the most miserable woman on earth—
What recompence indeed <HI>can</HI> I make you?—
None, none, but to tell you that if you will
fly this instant, my fortune shall be at your
disposal, and I will take care to supply you in
what part soever of the world you shall chuse
for your residence.</P>
<P>And can you after all that is past, said he,
persist in such barbarity as to drive me from
you? or are you determined to see me perish
here? if that be so, I will soon rid you of this
miserable hated wretch.</P>
<P>He drew his sword like a madman, and with
a dreadful imprecation, which made me
shudder, swore that if I did not that minute,
<PB N="339" REF="340"/>
promise to bear him company in his flight, he
would plunge it into his breast, and die before
my eyes—Good God, what a scene of horror
was this! I will, I will, I cried. I will go with
you to the farthest verge of the earth. I catched
his arm, fell down on my knees, and was more
mad, if possible, than himself.</P>
<P>I begged of him to put up his sword, which
he did, seeing me almost dead with fear. You
know, said he, the means of dying are always
in my own power; take care you do not
trifle with me, nor plead in excuse for falsify∣ing
your promise, that you made it to save me
from immediate destruction.</P>
<P>I beseeched him to calm himself a little, and
to permit me to send for my brother. Sir
George you know has an intire affection for
you, said I, you may trust him with your life
and safety.</P>
<P>I had forgot him, said he; poor Bidulph!
he will be afflicted when he hears my story.</P>
<P>I instantly wrote a line to my brother re∣questing
to see him immediately. By good
fortune he was at home, and came to me
directly.</P>
<P>In the mean time as I saw Mr. Faulkland's
mind was exceedingly disturbed, I endeavour∣ed,
by giving him an account of my own situ∣ation,
to divert his thoughts from the trouble
that preyed on them; for I was apprehensive
of his relapsing into the same phrenzy that
had so much terrified me, if I touched on the
<PB N="340" REF="341"/>
cause, and therefore chose to defer enquiring
into the particulars of his misfortune, till my
brother should be present.</P>
<P>Sir George was equally astonished with me
at the sight of Mr. Faulkland; they embraced
tenderly; poor Mr. Faulkland wept upon my
brother's neck. It was easy to discover he la∣boured
under some extraordinary affliction.</P>
<P>My brother looked at me as if for an ex∣planation;
he seemed to guess at least part of
the fatal truth. Are you come to England
alone, Faulkland, said he? I prevented the
reply; he is alone, said I, he has a dreadful
story to relate to you. Mrs. Faulkland is dead.
I durst not ask the manner of her death, till
you were by, to calm the transports of your
friend.</P>
<P>My heart forebodes, answered my brother,
addressing himself to Mr. Faulkland, that the
ungrateful woman you married has betrayed
you. She did, replied Mr. Faulkland, but I did
not mean to stain my hands with her blood,
perfidious as she was; her death be on her
own head.</P>
<P>Sir George looked astonished; that she is
dead I rejoice, said he, but how, my dear
Faulkland, were you accessary to it?</P>
<P>We were that instant interrupted. Mr.
Warner passing by, called to ask me how I
did, and as my brother's chariot stood at the
door, I could not be denied to him, tho' I
had ordered that no body should be let in.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="342"/>
I was called down to him, and indeed was
not sorry to have an excuse for absenting
myself a while, for my spirits were quite over∣powered.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner quickly observed that some∣thing
extraordinary had happened, and as he
was already acquainted with the greatest part of
Mr. Faulkland's history, some particulars re∣lative
to his wife excepted, I made no scruple,
relying on his prudence and secrecy, of telling
him the cause of my present distress; in which
he seemed to take a friendly and even paternal
share.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I returned to the room
where I had left my brother and his friend.
They both seemed in extreme agitation, they
were walking about.</P>
<P>This is an unfortunate affair, said my bro∣ther,
and may be attended with dreadful
consequences, if Faulkland does not shew more
regard to his own safety, than he seems in∣clined
to do. I have been persuading him to
retire to a place which I can provide for him,
where he may lie concealed for a day or two,
till he is recovered from the fatigue of his
journey; for he has travelled night and day,
for these three days, without sleeping.</P>
<P>Sir George looked at me, and by a sorrow∣ful
sign which he made, I apprehended he
feared his unhappy friend's head was dis∣turbed.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="343"/>
For heaven's sake, Sir, said I, be advised by
my brother, who loves you; suffer him to
conduct you to some place of security; when
you have had a little repose we will both come
to you, and concert such measures as shall be
best for your safety.</P>
<P>He snatched my hand, Sir George is my
true friend, said he, take care that <HI>you</HI> do not
deceive me. I find myself giddy for want
of rest, I am satisfied to be disposed of for
to-night how you please. But give me your
word of honour that I shall see you in the
morning.</P>
<P>You shall indeed, Sir, I replied.</P>
<P>Depend upon it, answered Sir George, I'll
bring her to you myself.</P>
<P>He looked irresolute, and as if he knew
not what to say; then turning to my brother,
and leaning on his shoulder, do, dear Bidulph,
carry me to some place where I may lie down,
for my spirits can hold out no longer.</P>
<P>Come, said Sir George, taking him under
the arm, my chariot is at the door, I will bring
you to a house where you may be quite at
home.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland riveted his eyes on me, as
my brother led him out of the room, but he
did not speak.</P>
<P>Sir George whispered me that he would re∣turn
again. They went into the chariot to∣gether
and drove away.</P>
<P>It was ten o'clock before my brother re∣turned.
<PB N="343" REF="344"/>
He told me he had lodged Mr.
Faulkland safely at a friend's house in whom
he could confide, as he did not think his own,
in case of a search, a place of security. He
said he had seen him in bed, and hoped a little
sleep would compose his mind, which seem∣ed
very much disturbed. 1 requested my bro∣ther
to give me the particulars of that terrible
affair, which Mr. Faulkland had mentioned.
Sir George related to me what follows, tho'
Mr. Faulkland, he said, told the story but in∣coherently.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland said he had no reason to be
displeased with his wife's conduct for more
than a year after their marriage; her affection
for him seemed lively and sincere; and he
had made her the most grateful returns, it be∣ing
the study of his life to render her happy.
Her love abated not of its ardor, and he had
all the reason in the world, to imagine himself
intirely possessed of her heart.</P>
<P>Whilst Mr. Faulkland's house in the country
was building, he had been invited by a neigh∣bouring
gentleman, who lived at the distance
of about three miles from his own place, to stay
at his house; which obliging offer Mr. Faulk∣land
had readily accepted, as by that means
he had daily opportunities of seeing, and ex∣pediting
his own improvements.</P>
<P>Mr. Bond (that was the gentleman's name)
had a wife and two or three daughters,
all very agreeable women; with whom
<PB N="344" REF="345"/>
Mrs. Faulkland had, by living so much in
their family, contracted a great intimacy;
but particularly with the eldest, a sprightly
fine young woman, of about twenty years
old. They had been three or four months
at Mr. Bond's; their house, which was no∣thing
more than a little lodge, was finished;
and they only waited till it was thoroughly
dry, to remove into it, as Mr. Faulkland
had laid out extensive gardens, in the finish∣ing
of which he proposed to amuse himself
some time; for he acknowleged to my
brother, he was in no haste to return to Eng∣land.</P>
<P>During their residence with this gentle∣man,
they had made two or three excursions
to town. On their return from one of
these, after an absence of about a fortnight,
they found a visitor at Mr Bond's; his
name was Smyth; he was an officer, a gen∣teel
handsome man; and they were given
to understand he made his addresses to the
eldest daughter; of whom he had been an
admirer a long time, but durst not make
his pretensions known to her father, till
having lately been promoted in the army
to the rank of major, the young lady's pa∣rents
admitted his visits to their daughter.
She had long before that acknowleged to
Mrs. Faulkland in confidence, her attach∣ment
to him. Mr. Faulkland, who had
learned this secret from his wife, was very
<PB N="345" REF="346"/>
glad to find that Miss Bond, for whom he
had a great esteern, was likely to have her
wishes accomplished, as he saw that Major
Smyth was treated with distinction by her
parents, who complimented him with a bed
at their house; for he generally staid two
or three nights with them, every time he
paid them a visit, as his regiment was then
quartered at a town about fifteen miles di∣stant
from their house.</P>
<P>The Major, without being a man of very
shining parts, had such talents as made him
acceptable to the women. He sung pretti∣ly,
was lively to extravagance, full of agree∣able
trifling, and always in good humour.
Miss Bond loved him; and as he was con∣sidered
in the light of a person, who would
shortly be one of the family, Mr. Faulkland
soon contracted a friendship with him, which
the Major, on his part, seemed very solici∣tous
to improve.</P>
<P>The marriage was now agreed on, and
was only deferred till the young lady's bro∣ther
should be at age, as he was to join with
his father in making a settlement on his
sister. This desirable event was at the
distance of four months; but as the lover
was in the mean time permitted to enjoy so
much of his mistress's conversation, he
seemed to submit to the delay with pa∣tience.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="347"/>
Things were in this situation, when Mr.
Faulkland, thinking it time to remove to
his own house, proposed it to his lady;
but she objected to it, declaring she did not
think it safe, as the house had been so lately
built. Though indeed it was now perfect∣ly
well seasoned; for the shell had been in∣tirely
finished some time before Mr. Faulk∣land
had gone to Mr. Bond's house, and it
was only the inside work, and a kitchen,
that was built apart from the lodge, that
wanted to be compleated. Mr. Faulkland
was unwilling to oppose his lady in any
thing; but he was the more solicitous that
she should comply with his request in this
particular, as he thought he had observed,
that the eldest Miss Bond had, of late, be∣haved
with more coldness towards her than
usual. Though he was far from guessing
the cause of this, he thought it, however, a
sufficient reason for their removal. He was
afraid they had already staid too long; and
that, perhaps, notwithstanding the good-na∣ture
and hospitality of the family, they all
now secretly wished their absenee. This,
tho' he intended to make a suitable return
for their friendly reception of him during
so long a time, made him resolve not to
continue there; and the more so, as Miss
Bond, who was present when he proposed
it to Mrs. Faulkland, seemed to wish for
their departure; as she dissented from that
<PB N="347" REF="348"/>
lady, with regard to her opinion of the state
of the new house, and seemed to think there
could no danger attend their immediate en∣trance
into it. Mrs. Faulkland seemed net∣tled
at this, and immediately assented to her
husband's proposal; the next day they took
their leave of Mr. Bond's family, and re∣paired
to their own house.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland, from this period, re∣marked
a change in his wife's behaviour;
she grew melancholy and peevish; but, as
she complained of not being well, he im∣puted
the alteration in her temper to that
alone; and the more so, as she did not abate
in the tokens of her seeming affection for
him.</P>
<P>Mr. Bond's family frequently visited
them; Major Smyth always made one of
the party, and often came without them.
Though they lived but at the distance of
three miles from each other, yet as the road
for carriages between the two houses, being
a cross one, was very bad, the ladies were
often prevailed on, if they staid late, to lie
a night at Mr. Faulkland's, and, in conse∣quence
of this, Mr. Bond and the Major
had frequently done the same, when they
were of the party.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Faulkland was far from
having any injurious suspicion of his wife,
yet he could not help observing, that all her
complaints vanished, when ever this family
<PB N="348" REF="349"/>
were at her house. This, however, he
ascribed to nothing more than her being
fond of their company, though he thought
a coolness between her, and the eldest Miss
Bond, was still apparent. The principals of
the family, however, behaved with their
usual frankness and good humour, and Mr.
Faulkland thought there might be some
little female pique between the two ladies,
which was not worth enquiring into.</P>
<P>As they punctually returned the friendly
visits of these agreeable neighbours, Mrs.
Faulkland always proposed passing the night
there, to induce them, as she said, to use
the same obliging freedom at her house.
Mr. Faulkland, on those occasions, observed,
that his lady always rose much earlier than
usual; but unsuspecting as he was, he was
satisfied with the reason she assigned for it,
that of enjoying the pleasant hours of the
morning in a very delicious garden; a
pleasure which they could not have at home,
as Mr. Faulkland's improvements were only
in their infancy.</P>
<P>The mutual intercourse between the two
families was thus carried on for more than
three months, when the time drew near,
that Miss Bond and her lover were to be
united, and every thing was preparing for
the purpose. The young Mr. Bond was
come home from the college, and the house,
<PB N="349" REF="350"/>
on this occasion, was more chearful than
ever. Mr. Faulkland and his lady were
there at a ball one night, when the latter,
after dancing a long time, complained sud∣denly
of being violently ill, and either really
did, or pretended to, faint. She was im∣mediately
conveyed to bed, and at her re∣quest,
another room prepared for Mr.
Faulkland. He, extremely alarmed at her
indisposition, came to her bed-side, pur∣posing
to sit up by her the whole night;
the youngest of the Miss Bonds offering to
do the same, but Mrs. Faulkland absolutely
refused them both, and about midnight, say∣ing
she found herself inclined to sleep, in∣sisted
on their retiring; nor would she admit
a servant to stay in the room, but contented
herself with having a candle burning on the
hearth.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland, who really had an affec∣tion
for his lady, was impatient the next
morning to enquire after her health; he
found her in bed, the complaints of the pre∣ceding
night all renewed.</P>
<P>The family were extremely disconcerted at
this unlucky accident, and expressed the ut∣most
uneasiness, all but the eldest Miss Bond,
who was silent; and heard her mother
and sisters condoling with Mr. Faulkland,
not only with unconcern, but a suppressed
smile of contempt, which did not escape
Mr. Faulkland's observation. He now be∣gan
<PB N="350" REF="351"/>
to resent such a behaviour, which he
thought very unkind; and told his Lady, he
wished she was in a condition to be removed,
as he was fearful, in her present situation, it
might be very inconvenient to the family, to
have her remain sick in their house; especi∣ally
as it quite broke in on the mirth and festi∣vity
which were now going forward.</P>
<P>To this she replied, that she found her∣self
so very weak and dispirited, which she
said was always the consequence of those
faintings, to which she had been subject from
her childhood, that she could not think of
leaving her room. She made a shift, how∣ever,
to rise, and said, she hoped in a day
or two to be able to remove.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bond, who was of an extremely hu∣mane
and tender disposition, begged of her
not to think of stirring, till she found her
health perfectly re-established: Mrs. Faulk∣land
thankfully accepted her offer, and Mr.
Faulkland, though reluctantly, was obliged
to acquiesce.</P>
<P>They remained thus two days longer,
Mrs. Faulkland's complaints still furnishing
her with a pretence for sleeping alone; and
under colour of not giving trouble in the fa∣mily,
she. would not suffer a maid to sit up
with her.</P>
<P>Major Smyth, who had been in the house
all this time,, had now some call to his regi∣ment,
which obliged him to go to the town
<PB N="351" REF="352"/>
where it lay, and Mr. Faulkland heard him
give his man directions for their journey.</P>
<P>Mrs. Faulkland still kept her room, and
had not left it since the time she was first
taken ill. It happened, that the chamber,
which was assigned for Mr. Faulkland, im∣mediately
joined his lady's, and was only
separated from it by a wainscot partition, by
which means he could hear the least stir in
her chamber.</P>
<P>The unsuspecting injured husband, whose
anxiety for his faithless wife, had always
made him watchful and attentive to her
motions, happened this night to be more
than ordinarily so. The family had now
been for some hours buried in sleep; every
thing was profoundly silent for some time.
Mr. Faulkland, who hoped his lady was
settled to rest, was endeavouring to com∣pose
himself to sleep, when he heard her stir.
This immediately rouzed him, and, raising
his head off the pillow, he found she got
out of bed. Though she seemed to use the
utmost precaution, he nevertheless heard her
very distinctly open her door, and go out.
Surprized as he was at this motion, no
other thought occurred to him, than that
perhaps Mrs. Faulkland:, finding herself ill,
had got up to call some of the female ser∣vants.
Prepossessed with this belief, he start∣ed
out of bed, and hastily slipping on his
<PB N="352" REF="353"/>
cloaths, ran into his lady's room, where he
found her candle still burning.</P>
<P>As he concluded she would presently re∣turn,
he waited some minutes in her cham∣ber;
at length, perceiving her cloaths lying
on a chair at her bed-side, he was afraid she
had gone out without putting any thing on
her, and though the night was not cold, he
was apprehensive, that in her apparently
weak condition, her health might be farther
injured.</P>
<P>On this account, he determined to go in
quest of her; and concluding she had gone
to the apartment of the female servants,
which was on the floor over that on which
they lay, he ascended the stairs as silently as
possible.</P>
<P>As he was passing by a room on the top
of the first flight, he heard some one speak
in a low voice, and listening, fancied it was
his wife's.</P>
<P>As he knew not who lay in the room, he
made no doubt but that it was she, who was
calling the person that slept there; and,
without farther reflection, hastily opened
the door, and went in, with the candle,
which he had taken, in his hand. On his
sudden entrance, the person, who was in
bed, eagerly called out, Who is there?</P>
<P>He soon perceived by his voice, that it
was major Smyth. He was about to make
<PB N="353" REF="354"/>
an apology for his intrusion, when per∣ceiving
his lady's wrapping-gown, which
he had seen her wear that morning, lying
on the floor, and in the same instant recol∣lecting
that he had heard a woman's voice
when he was without-side the door, the hor∣rour
of her guilt rushed upon him at once,
and without making any answer to the ma∣jor,
he suddenly drew back the feet curtains
of the bed, where he plainly perceived that
the major had a companion, though she had
hid her head under the cloaths.</P>
<P>The major instantly leapt out of bed; and
though he saw Mr. Faulkland was unarm∣ed,
he snatched up one of his own pistols,
which lay on the table, and which his man
had charged that night, as they were to go
a short journey the next morning. Mr.
Faulkland, in the first transports of his rage,
seized the other; the miserable woman, ob∣serving
their fatal motions, threw herself
out of bed. Mr. Faulkland was too much
distracted, to be able to give a distinct ac∣count
of this dreadful incident; all he can
say is, that major Smyth snapped his pistol
at him, which, he thinks, missed fire, and
he instantly discharged his with more fatal
success; for Mrs. Faulkland, who had in the
instant rushed between them, shrieked out,
and dropped on the ground; and the Major,
reeling a few steps, fell against one of the
<PB N="354" REF="355"/>
pillars of the bed, and cried out he has kil∣led
us both.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland says, that after this dread∣ful
action, without knowing what he did,
he ran down stairs, and opening the front
door, made the best of his way home on
foot. The phrenzy of his mind was such
that he thought not of providing for his
safety; but having got into his house, he
had no intention of going farther, when, in
less than a quarter of an hour, one of his
servanrs, whom he had left behind him at
Mr. Bond's, a faithful fellow, who had lived
with him many years, came to him, scared
and breathless, having ran himself almost
dead to overtake his master.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, said he, for heaven's sake, get
away as fast as you can: Mr. Bond's family
are all in an uproar; you will be taken, if
you do not make your escape this instant.</P>
<P>Have I killed any body? demanded Mr.
Faulkland.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, answered the man, you have
killed my lady, and major Smyth is mortally
wounded.</P>
<P>I know not what I did cried, Mr. Faulk∣land,
but I did not mean to hurt your mis∣tress.</P>
<P>I believe it, Sir, replied the servant, but
I fear no body else will, for that wicked
wretch, though they think he cannot live
many hours, would take away your life if
<PB N="355" REF="356"/>
he could. The report of the pistol alarmed
the family, and we all ran into his room,
gentry and servants and all; the major was
able to speak, but my lady was quite dead.</P>
<P>The account he gives is, that my lady's
candle having gone out, she got up to get
it lighted, and was endeavouring to find one
of the maid's rooms, when passing by his,
and seeing a light, for he was but just got
into bed, she stepped in; and before she had
time to retire again, you rushed in like a
madman; and seeing his pistols lye on the
table, you snatched them both up, and dis∣charging
one at your lady, which killed her
on the spot, you fired the other at him,
while he was leaping out of bed. I am
sure, Sir, this is a false story, yet, as the fa∣mily
may all believe it, I beg you, on my
knees, to provide for your safety. Miss
Bond was tearing her hair for her lover; but
I heard her say, she was glad that wicked
woman (meaning my lady) had lost her
life.</P>
<P>They had sent off some of the people for
a surgeon, and I ran as fast as I could to
warn you of your danger.</P>
<P>This honest fellow, not contented with
urging his master, soon saddled a very swift
hunter, which he had in the stable; and
Mr. Faulkland, now convinced of the ne∣cessity
of flying, mounted it directly, and,
attended only by one groom, galloped off
<PB N="356" REF="357"/>
to Dublin, which he reached by seven o'clock
in the morning, and was lucky enough to
arrive just as a packet, which was going off
with an express, was ready to sail. He went
on board, and landed at Holy-head in
twelve hours; from thence, without stop∣ping
night or day, except to change horses,
he rode post to London, and presented him∣self,
in the manner I have already told you,
before me.</P>
<P>Such, my Cecilia, are the dismal parti∣culars
of this sad story. My brother staid
with me 'till it was very late; our time was
past in consulting on measures for Mr. Faulk∣land's
preservation. He said, he would ad∣vise
him, by all means, to get over to Hol∣land
as fast as he could; for if that story,
which the execrable Smyth had invented,
should be believed, and it was very likely
to gain credit in case he died of his wound,
and persevered in it to the last, Mr. Faulk∣land,
having no witness to disprove any part
of the charge, would be in imminent danger
of losing his life.</P>
<P>I need not describe to you the horrour in
which I passed last night. I rose this morn∣ing
at day-light, and was but just dressed,
when I was informed Mr. Warner wanted
to speak to me. I went down stairs to him
directly.</P>
<P>I could not sleep all night for thinking of
your affairs, said he, without any previous
<PB N="357" REF="358"/>
salute; and I am so impatient to hear Faulk∣land's
story, that I could not rest 'till I came
to you to be informed of it, for I suppose
you heard every thing last night.</P>
<P>I related all the particulars minutely as I
have done to you, Mr. Warner never once
interrupting me. When I had ended the
story, what do you intend for Faulkland,
said my kinsman? I know not what to do,
Sir, I replied, but this I am sure of, that if
it were in the power of wealth to relieve his
afflicted mind, he has an undoubted right to
a large portion of the fortune I possess; this
I think myself bound to bestow on the man,
who when I was destitute, offered me his.
If we can prevail on him to take care of his
own safety, which, when he is a little more
collected, I hope we shall be able to do, I
must entreat your assistance, Sir, in helping
me to make him as easy as his unhappy cir∣cumstances
will admit of—And is this <HI>all,</HI>
demanded Mr. Warner sternly? does not
your gratitude suggest a warmer recompence
than giving him a paltry income?</P>
<P>I was startled at the question, and not re∣plying
immediately, you must marry him,
said he in a peremptory tone; there is no∣thing
now to hinder you; the heavy mis∣fortune
which has fallen upon him, puts it in
your power to make him such a return as his
prosperous days would not have allowed you.
You can confer an obligation on him now;
<PB N="358" REF="359"/>
so <HI>that</HI> scruple is rubbed out. As for any
former idle aspersions, you have already done
more than enough, to convince the world
they were without foundation. I could wish
indeed that jezebel of a wife had been cut
off in the common way; but since he was
guiltless in his intentions, it would be bar∣barous
to make <HI>that</HI> an objection, and I dare
answer for it, all mankind will acquit him,
though the law perhaps may not, of that
scoundrel's death, who so well deserved it at
his hands.</P>
<P>I told Mr. Warner, that though Mr.
Faulkland had proposed something like
this, I was sure it was owing to his dis∣tracted
mind, for that he had at first de∣clared
he only came to take a last look at me,
and that I hoped, when he came to the cool
use of his reason, he would be far from urg∣ing
such a request—The more are you bound
then, said he, interrupting me, to deal ge∣nerously
by him—What does your brother
say upon the subject? He has not touched
upon it, I replied, I was so taken up with
hearing Mr. Faulkland's melancholy story
from my brother, that I mentioned not to
him his wild proposal; and as Sir George
told me, Mr. Faulkland was much more
composed when he left him to his rest, I
presume he hinted nothing of that kind to
my brother.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="360"/>
Ay, ay, cried Mr. Warner, Sir George
to be sure will change his note. Faulkland
is now a fallen man, therefore depend upon
it he will not be for your marrying him;
but for this very reason, I insist on your do∣ing
a noble thing. If you have a grain of
honour, or of gratitude in you, you will not
hesitate a moment. I will not desire you,
continued he, finding me silent, to carry
your gratitude so far as to marry a madman,
if he should prove so; but if on your visit
to him this morning, you find him compos∣ed,
and in his right mind, make him a
frank offer of your hand, and see you do it
handsomely; consult not George, upon the
subject, I will have it all <HI>my</HI> doing. Go,
added he, if I did not know that at the bot∣tom
of your heart you <HI>love</HI> Faulkland, I
would not make this a point with you; but
notwithstanding all your pretended demurs I
am sure that is the case.</P>
<P>I should be disingenuous to deny it, an∣swered
I; far from doing so, I will own that
I should prefer him before all the world, if
the strangeness of his present situation did
not frighten me. Trouble not your head
about that, cried Mr. Warner, if the man
is in his senses, do as I bid you, and take
care that you acquit yourself with honour.</P>
<P>He left me without waiting for a reply.
What can I say or do, my Cecilia? my heart
and my reason are at variance. What a
<PB N="360" REF="361"/>
strange dilemma am I driven to? nobody
to advise me. Mr. Warner precipitate and
fanciful in his determinations, urges me on
to I know not what. Marry Mr. Faulkland!
receive a hand stained with—Oh the very
thought is terrible!</P>
<P>What would the world say to such an
union? it cannot be. He will not sure
when he comes to the use of his cooler rea∣son
insist upon a promise, which my own ter∣rour,
and his desperation, extorted from me.</P>
<P>I must try to convince Mr. Warner's
judgment; I hope he will not obstinately
persist in pressing me to what I dare not
comply with …………….
…….. My brother is just come to
carry me to Mr. Faulkland. Heaven grant
I may find him restored to his right
mind! ……………….
…. Just returned from my visit to Mr.
Faulkland. What a scene! he wrung my
very heart. I would I had never seen him.</P>
<P>We found him up, and walking about
his room; his looks much more composed
than they were last night.</P>
<P>On our entering his chamber, his eyes
sparkled with pleasure. He ran to my bro∣ther,
and embraced him. Thank you, my
dear, dear Bidulph, said he, you at length
give her to me, and with her own consent
too. My bride! turning passionately to me,
and snatching my hand.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="362"/>
My brother seemed shocked, and cast his
eyes mournfully at me: mine moistened, and
I was obliged to apply my handkerchief to
them, turning my head away.</P>
<P>Tears! cried Mr. Faulkland, in a tone of
surprize, and on our wedding-day! I could
not bear this, I sobbed aloud. My brother
was willing, if possible, to give his thoughts
another turn, for not knowing what had
passed the day before, he thought this was
some sudden start of phrenzy.</P>
<P>My dear Faulkland, said he, you affect
my sister too much; we have been consult∣ing
for your safety, and came to talk with
you upon it.</P>
<P>I think there is no time to be lost, and
that you ought immediately to retire into
Holland.</P>
<P>I am ready, replied Mr. Faulkland, but
Mrs. Arnold goes with me, I have her pro∣mise
for it.</P>
<P>Sidney shall follow you, answered my bro∣ther,
making a motion to me to shew he
would have me humour him in his ravings.
I will not go without her, cried Mr. Faulk∣land;
the universe shall not now part us.</P>
<P>I was almost distracted with apprehension,
and knew not what reply to make; my bro∣ther
looked confounded, and was silent.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland approached me, and with
a look of gloomy despair, you are both
mute, said he, Bidulph, I always thought
<PB N="362" REF="363"/>
<HI>you</HI> loved me. Mrs. Arnold I hoped did
not wish my death; but I am deceived in
you both—I have no farther business with
life—The friend I most confided in betrays
me; the woman whom my soul worships,
and to whom I sacrificed all my hopes of
happiness, repays me with ingratitude. Why
should such a wretch any longer submit to
life? I have borne it too long already; but
there's my remedy, pointing furiously to
his sword, which lay in the scabbard on a
table.</P>
<P>I could no longer contain myself, but
bursting into tears, Oh, Sir, said I, accuse
me not of ingratitude; I would to heaven
<HI>my</HI> death could repair the heavy afflictions I
have brought upon you; if it could, I would
welcome it this hour. Your reproaches, cruel
as they are, I forgive. I own myself the
unhappy cause of all your misfortunes; we
have been mutually fatal to each other. You
know I always valued and esteemed you,
and have in your calamity already been suffi∣ciently
punished for the share I have had in
bringing it on you. What shall I say to
you, Sir? my whole fortune I think too
small, too poor a recompence, to the man
who has obliged me beyond a possibility of
return. Yet what have I to offer more?
can you, Sir, can you urge me to a mar∣riage
at so strange a juncture? think how
it will expose us both to censure. Your long
<PB N="363" REF="364"/>
attachment to me has not been a secret.
Think what dreadful constructions may be
put on <HI>your</HI> conduct, nay, on <HI>mine,</HI> should
a union now take place, brought about, as
it must appear, by so terrible an event.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland was silent, his eyes fixed
on the ground. My brother took up the
argument. Indeed, my dear Faulkland,
my sister has reason for her fears. You
know I ever was your sincere friend; you
know too I always was of opinion that Sid∣ney
ought to have been your wife; her for∣mer
objections I thought were romantic scru∣ples,
and hardly forgave her refusing you.
The present obstacle has more weight in
it—Do not mistake me, added he hastily
(seeing Mr. Faulkland raise his eyes full of
resentment at him) I wish my sister still to
be yours, and will consent to your marriage
with my whole heart; but let me conjure
you to take a more favourable juncture:
withdraw yourself but for the present; your
affairs may not be so desperate as you ima∣gine.
If that villain Smyth should chance to
recover, perhaps his conscience may awaken
remorse, and he may be prevailed on to
do you justice. In that case you must be
cleared from the most distant imputation
of what my sister hinted at, and what has
but too justly alarmed her. Cleared as your
character will then be, and conscious as we
both are of the innocence of your intentions,
<PB N="364" REF="365"/>
there will remain no bar to Mrs. Arnold's
giving you her hand.</P>
<P>Smyth <HI>cannot</HI> recover, interrupted Mr.
Faulkland, sullenly—there is no hope can
spring from that. Then, answered my bro∣ther,
at worst you can but live abroad; all
parts of the world are alike to such a philo∣sopher
as my sister is; and probably circum∣stanced
as your marriage will appear, she
may like best to reside out of England.—</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland shook his head, and with
a smile of indignation, leave me, Bidulph,
cried he, I cannot bear <HI>your</HI> attempting to
deceive me. You think me mad, and are
cruel enough to endeavour at imposing on
me—I know my mind is disturbed—but
who has driven me to despair! to madness!
to death! and he cast a look at me that chilled
my blood.</P>
<P>Be satisfied, madam, you shall soon be
rid of this fatal—hated—betrayed—aban∣doned
wretch! he spoke this with his hands
grasped eagerly together, and his eyes lifted
up to heaven. Then striking his breast, he
burst into tears, and rushing suddenly into
his closet, he shut the door violently, locking
it on the inside.</P>
<P>He wept aloud, and his agonies reduced
me almost to the same condition with him∣self.</P>
<P>I begged my brother would endeavour to
prevail on him to open the door, for I was
<PB N="365" REF="366"/>
fearful of his making some dreadful attempt
upon his own life; but Sir George a little
quieted my fears, by shewing me his sword,
which still lay on the table, and which, at
my desire, he put out of the way.</P>
<P>My brother approached the closet door,
and in the most soothing language beseeched
him to open it; but he could get no other
answer from Mr. Faulkland, than to beg he
would leave him to himself.</P>
<P>I found this was not a time for arguing.
I told my brother, we had better suffer him
to vent his passion alone, and that, perhaps,
when he had time to reflect a little on what
had been said, he would permit his cooler
reason to govern him.</P>
<P>Sir George was very unwilling to leave
him in such a distracted state of mind; he
renewed his efforts to persuade him to come
out of the closet, but to no purpose.</P>
<P>I beseech you to leave me, Sir George,
said he, I am not in a condition to talk—I
cannot bear the sight of Mrs. Arnold—let
me recover myself—another time perhaps I
may be better able to discourse with you.</P>
<P>Will you promise me then, replied my
brother, that you will in the interim do no∣thing
that may be injurious to your life or
health? Indeed, my dear Faulkland, you
distress my sister and me more than you
can imagine. Name the hour when you
will permit me to come to you again; and
<PB N="366" REF="367"/>
for heaven's sake think of your own imme∣diate
preservation: <HI>that</HI> once secured, there
is nothing which my sister and I will not af∣terwards
do to make you happy—Can I rely
on you, Faulkland? do you promise me not
to be rash? You have my sword in your pos∣session,
answered Mr. Faulkland, (still speak∣ing
within the closet) I have no other weapon
about me—leave me, Sir George—I cannot
talk.</P>
<P>Say but that you wish to see me again,
replied my brother, and I will go, and give
you no further trouble. Mr. Faulkland
sighed deeply. Say, I wish to see you! he
repeated, ah, Bidulph! and his voice seemed
choaked. My brother could not refrain from
tears. I will come to you in the evening,
Faulkland—You will find me your true
friend.—I should be loath to lay you under
any restraint here, in the house of my friend:
do but say there is no need of it. Promise
me—the slightest word will suffice. I know
my dear Faulkland will not break his word.</P>
<P>Well—I will not attempt my life, cried
he impatiently, let that satisfy you—leave
me, and let me not be exposed to any insults
here.</P>
<P>I leave you, answered my brother, and
hope to find you more composed a few hours
hence. Mrs. Arnold too begs you will be
calm, and think of preserving a life which is
so dear to us both.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="368"/>
Mr. Faulkland was silent, and my brother
and I withdrew; he thought it best I should
not speak to him.</P>
<P>Sir George left me at home, and said he
would call again on Mr. Faulkland in the
afternoon, and bring me word how he should
find him. My brother is exceedingly affect∣ed
with his situation, and says, he knows
not what to advise. He is fearful that Mr.
Falkland's phrenzy is not to be calmed,
but by consenting to marry him, and cir∣cumstanced
as he now is, that thought is
terrible. Yet, if I persist in my refusal, I
drive the noblest of minds to desperation.
Oh, my Cecilia, is this the return I ought
to make to the most generous of men?
whose servent love for me has been a con∣stant
source of torment to him for so many
years? Yet how can I yield him my hand?
All my former scruples, weighty as they ap∣peared
to me, were light to the dreadful bar
that now interposes.</P>
<P>Had that ill-fated woman died the com∣mon
way, with what joy, what exultation
could I have rewarded his honest persever∣ing
love! all my duties fulfilled, obedience
to my mother, justice to the woman I thought
injured, reverence to the memory of my
husband, the respect due to my own cha∣racter.
Should I not, my Cecilia, after thus
being acquitted of all other obligations, have
been to blame, if, after a series of misfor∣tunes,
<PB N="368" REF="369"/>
all brought on by my strict adherence
to those duties; should I not have been to
blame for refusing at length to do justice to
the most deserving of men? When I reflect
on the past, when I survey the present, and
my foreboding heart whispers to me the
future sufferings of our dear unhappy Mr.
Faulkland, all my philosophy forsakes me.
I have borne up under my own sorrows—his
quite subdue me—I must lay by my pen
—my eyes are brim full of tears ……
………….. Ah, my dear, what
will become of us? I am almost dead with
apprehension. Rash, rash, unhappy Mr.
Faulkland! He has fled from the house
where my brother had concealed him: I
know not what I am writing, my fears dis∣tract
me. 'Tis but two hours since we left
him, Sir George relying on his promise, and
unwilling to provoke him by any appearance
of constraint, gave no caution to the gentle∣man
with whom he was lodged to observe
his motions; he is ready to kill himself for
this neglect; but relying on Mr. Faulkland's
promise not to make any attempt on his
life, he suspected not that he would endea∣vour
to escape. Escape do I call it? rather
let me say, to throw himself into certain
destruction.—He is set out on his way for
Ireland. Heaven knows what will be the
consequence of this, if my brother does not
overtake and persuade him back. He is
<PB N="369" REF="370"/>
gone after him, my cousin Warner with him;
both rode post.</P>
<P>My thoughts are so confused, I can put
nothing in order. It seems we had not long
quitted him, when he called up his servant,
(that groom who, as I informed you, had
come over with him) and telling him he was
going out of town, ordered him to go directly
to an inn somewhere in the city, and hire
two post-horses, and that he would follow
him presently.</P>
<P>The man obeyed, and in about half an
hour, his master came in a hackney-coach to
the place where he had directed him to wait
for him.</P>
<P>Upon the inn-keeper's enquiring whither
the horses were to go, Mr. Faulkland re∣plied,
to St. Albans. The man objected
to the length of the stage, and named Bar∣net.
Mr. Faulkland seemed impatient and
angry; his unusual earnestness, his wild
looks, and the road he purposed taking,
alarmed his servant (a discreet elderly man)
and he had the prudence immediately to dis∣patch
the master of the house, whom he
prevailed on by a piece of money, to go di∣rectly
to my brother with this intelligence.</P>
<P>He had the precaution not to mention
his master's name, only bad him find out
Sir George Bidulph, and tell him that his
friend was set out for St. Albans, and that
his man had dispatched him with the news,
<PB N="370" REF="371"/>
and would, if possible, endeavour to detain
him on the road, that Sir George might
overtake him.</P>
<P>The man was punctual in delivering his
message. My brother, wild with amaze∣ment
and horror, just called as he past my
door, to tell me this new and unexpected
misfortune. Mr. Warner had that instant
come to enquire what had past between Mr.
Faulkland and me in our interview this
morning. I had no time to tell him any∣thing.
He looked very much displeased at
my brother and me, upon hearing Mr. Faulk∣land
was gone; but said he would accom∣pany
Sir George, and they both hurried
away together.</P>
<P>The man said, Mr. Faulkland had set off
before he could leave his house, the servant
having scarce time to give him the mes∣sage.</P>
<P>I fear it will be impossible for my brother
to overtake him—He will be lost forever—
what then will be my portion? Happy had
it been for me indeed, as my dear mother
once said, in the bitterness of her heart, that
I had died in my cradle!</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Tuesday night twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>Heaven be praised, they are returned!
<HI>All</HI> returned; Mr. Faulkland has been pre∣vailed
on to come back, Mr. Warner has
prevailed on him. He hag saved his life;
but, my Cecilia, thy friend's temporal hap∣piness,
<PB N="371" REF="372"/>
and peace of mind, is the only price
that could ransom this desperate self-devoted
victim!</P>
<P>Mr. Warner has bound himself by a so∣lemn
oath that I should become his wife,
or Mr. Faulkland, determined on his own
destruction, would, spite of all they could
do, have pursued his fatal journey to Ire∣land,
in order to deliver himself up to
justice.</P>
<P>It was near ten o'clock before they re∣turned
to town. My brother carried Mr.
Faulkland back to the gentleman's house,
where he was before lodged; and my kins∣man
left them together, in order to come and
give me an account of what passed.</P>
<P>He said the gentleman, at whose house
he was lodged by my brother, was extreme∣ly
surprized at seeing him again, Mr.
Faulkland having with great composure ta∣ken
his leave of him in the morning; and
after thanking him for the shelter he had
afforded him, told him he was going out of
town.</P>
<P>My brother and my kinsman overtook
him about a mile on this side St. Alban's,
for which success they were intirely indebt∣ed
to the prudence of the servant who at∣tended
him: for the poor man, finding
him pushing on with the utmost eagerness,
and Mr. Faulkland no longer making a se∣cret
of his intention of returning to Ireland,
<PB N="372" REF="373"/>
resolved at all events to prevent his ruin; and
hoping that by a little delay, Sir George might
overtake them, contrived at their first stage,
so dexterously to slip a nail in between the
horse's shoe and his hoof, that he knew he
could not go far without being lame.</P>
<P>This succeeded so well, that the poor animal
was soon disabled, and Mr. Faulkland not
having it in his power to mount himself better,
was obliged to go on at a very easy rate, 'till
they arrived at the next stage.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner and my brother overtook him
in this situation: Sir George knew him as soon
as they came in sight of him, and followed
him at a proper distance, still keeping him
in view, 'till he alighted at the post-house.
They then at once entered the room, into
which he had retired, whilst fresh horses were
getting ready.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland started at the sight of my
brother; he looked earnestly at Mr. Warner,
whom he had never seen before; but spoke
not to either of them.</P>
<P>Sir George, pursued my kinsman, accosted
him affectionately: Dear Faulkland, was this
kind of you, thus to fly from your friends
that love you? He presented me to him at the
same time, naming me as his relation.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland grasped the hand, which I
reached out in salutation to him; he fixed
his fine sparkling eyes on my face: Is it
Mr. Warner whom I have the honour to
<PB N="373" REF="374"/>
salute? Sir, I am no stranger to your worth:
I honour, I revere you. You are too good
to interest yourself thus for an unhappy
wretch, cast off, and forsaken by all the
world.</P>
<P>Do I forsake you, Faulkland, cried your
brother, kindly enough? No, Faulkland, I
am your constant sincere friend, and will prove
myself so, if you will but let me. Mr. Faulk∣land
made no reply.</P>
<P>Dear Faulkland, am I not your friend?
You are Mrs. Arnold's brother.—You are
not the man you were. Indeed, Faulkland,
I am; I am your true friend; suffer me to be
so, come back with me; Mr. Warner and I
have followed you, in the hope of prevailing
on you to return with us; do, Faulkland, let
us persuade you to preserve a life so dear to
us all.</P>
<P>What am I to live for, answered Mr.
Faulkland sternly? <HI>You</HI> have tried to deceive
me; the man I loved most, now I am fallen,
rejects me. Your sister persists in her obsti∣nate
cruelty towards me; she breaks her pro∣mise,
and you encourage her in it. I have
neither friends, fortune, or country! and do
you talk to me of life on <HI>such</HI> conditions?
No, Bidulph, it is a burden, of which I
will rid myself.—Mr. Warner, <HI>you</HI> are a
generous man, <HI>you</HI> have an enlarged mind;
may a stranger ask a favour of you?</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="375"/>
I could have wept, continued my kinsman,
to see such a frank noble fellow driven to
such desperation. Command me, Sir, I re∣plied,
there is nothing I would not do to serve
you.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir; I have a little son; let
me recommend the unhappy orphan to your
protection. He will soon want a father: will
you be one to him, Sir? I will send him over
to you; he laid hold of my hand, and repeat∣ed
his question, Will you, Mr. Warner? <HI>You</HI>
have an enlarged mind, and do not despise
the unfortunate.</P>
<P>I cried down right; he touched me to the
very quick. I never was so affected in my
life; and I own I was heartily displeased both
with you and your brother, for driving him
to such extremities: <HI>You</HI> especially, on whom
I laid injunctions to act in a contrary way.
As for Sir George, I am not surprized at <HI>his</HI>
behaviour.</P>
<P>From Mr. Faulkland's discourse, proceeded
my kinsman, it was apparent to me, that his
distraction proceeded from no other cause,
than his belief that you and your brother
slighted him in his misfortunes. It was plain
when he fled to England, that he was suffici∣ently
in his senses to be anxious for his own
safety; and though the sight of you, joined
to the hurry of his spirits, his fatigue, and
want of sleep, might, in a man of such violent
passions, have created a temporary phrenzy,
<PB N="375" REF="376"/>
yet I am very certain it would all have subsid∣ed,
if you had behaved to him as you ought
to have done, and as I desired you would:
nor do I see how you can answer it to your∣self,
after the miseries you have already
brought on such a glorious man (for I never
saw his equal either in mind or person) to per∣sist
in a behaviour which has already turned
his brain, and must in the end occasion his
death: for death he is determined on, if you
refuse to become his wife.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, cried I, leave him not to himself,
I conjure you; you see the influence you have
over his mind; you have done wonders in
bringing him back.—</P>
<P>Hold, replied Mr. Warner, till I inform you
of the means I was obliged to use.</P>
<P>I have told you how I was affected with
his situation, and the request he made me to
take care of his child. This was not the sug∣gestion
of madness; it was plain to me, that
if the cause were removed, he would soon be
restored to the perfect use of his reason, and
I could not bear to see the desolation of such
a noble frame, and all charged to your ac∣count.</P>
<P>Sir, I hope you do not mean, said I, to
return to Ireland, do you not know the risque
that you run by putting yourself into the
power of an exasperated family, from whom
you can expect nothing but the most malevo∣lent
persecution?</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="377"/>
I deliver myself up to the laws, replied Mr.
Faulkland; my life is devoted, 'tis indifferent
to me how I die.</P>
<P>Suppose, said I, Mrs. Arnold should consent
to marry you, would not that reconcile you to
life?</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, and he shook his head, I am not
to be deceived <HI>twice.</HI> (Your brother walked
about the room without taking part in the
conversation.)</P>
<P>I do not mean it, Sir, Mrs. Arnold must
be yours; <HI>I</HI> can influence her; do but return
back with me, I give you my honour I will
do my utmost to prevail on her to give you
her hand immediately. Her heart is har∣dened,
Sir, she will not consent, replied he.
I have no friend to urge her, I am an out∣cast;
and not fit to live—<HI>I</HI> will urge her, Sir,
she respects me, she will be guided by me;
she shall fulfil the promise she made you—
Oh, Sir, you but deceive yourself—she will
find out new excuses, I am not to be again
allured by false hopes.</P>
<P>He stepped towards the door as he spoke
these words, and was about to open it. Your
brother followed, and laid hold of his arm;
I did the same. Sir George, said he, expose
me not to insults, why do you persecute me?
leave me, Sir, I am <HI>not</HI> a madman—but I
am <HI>determined</HI>—and he spoke it as if he were
<HI>indeed</HI> so.</P>
<P>For heaven's sake, Faulkland, said your
<PB N="377" REF="378"/>
brother, be composed: you have Mr. War∣ner's
word of honour; you shall have mine
too, that we will do our utmost to persuade
Mrs. Arnold to consent to your wishes.
You have <HI>my</HI> full consent, you have won
Mr. Warner to your interest, my sister will
yield to our joint entreaties. <HI>Yield,</HI> he
repeated, no, no, Sir George, she has a
stubborn heart. I once thought it other∣wise;
but it is turned to stone, nothing but
my death will satisfy her, and she <HI>shall</HI> be sa∣tisfied.</P>
<P>He made an effort to break from us. Stay
Mr. Faulkland, said I, again laying hold of
his hand, and I here swear to you by every
thing that is sacred, that if you will suffer
me to conduct you back into Mrs. Arnold's
presence, I will insist on her immediately
accepting of you for her husband, or I will
for ever renounce all friendship with her:
I know she esteems and values you above
all men, I am therefore sure, I do no vio∣lence
to her inclinations; and if she perse∣veres
in her obstinate punctilios, I swear to
you by the same oath, that I will no longer
oppose you in your resolutions, let them be
what they will.</P>
<P>Sir George, added I, Do you join with
me in giving your friend the same as∣surances?
I do, answered he, solemnly ad∣dressing
himself to Mr. Faulkland, and
swear by all my hopes of happiness here∣after,
<PB N="378" REF="379"/>
to act in conjunction with Mr. War∣ner
in every particular that he has promis∣ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland seemed to be moved, he
looked wistfully at us by turns, as if wil∣ling,
though afraid, to yield to our intrea∣ties.</P>
<P>At length, I <HI>think</HI> I may rely on you, said
he, you will not break an oath (to Sir George)
but that woman has such an <HI>inflexible</HI> heart!
you cannot change <HI>that.</HI></P>
<P>We will do our utmost, we both answered
together. Remember then, said he, stretch∣ing
out a hand to each of us, you have sworn,
if she persists in her resolution, that you will
leave me to myself, and oppose me no longer.
We have. I will go back with you then,
cried Mr. Faulkland, and stepped again nim∣bly
to the door.</P>
<P>It will be best, said I, if we can hire a
coach to carry us; there is no necessity for
our riding post, and we shall be less liable
to observation than if we were on horse∣back.
Mr. Faulkland looked as if he sus∣pected
some design; do you not mean, said
he, to go directly back to London? Cer∣tainly,
I replied. And shall I see Mrs. Arnold
to-night? Without doubt, if you desire it.
Let us go then, said he; I think a coach is
a tedious way of travelling, but I submit to
<HI>your</HI> guidance.</P>
<P>I left Sir George with him, and went out
<PB N="379" REF="380"/>
to enquire whether we could be provided
with a coach and four; which after some de∣lay
was procured for us. We prevailed on
Mr. Faulkland, whilst it was getting ready,
to take a little refreshment. He asked us,
by what means we were informed of his de∣parture.</P>
<P>Sir George, unwilling to let him know
that his servant had discovered it, evaded the
question; and only replied, Do you think,
Faulkland, that in the humour I left you, I
could be inattentive to your motions? I am
not a madman, Bidulph, I must not be treated
like one. I do not think you one, answered
your brother, but I know you are warm, and
too fearless of danger.</P>
<P>When the coach was ready, Mr. Faulkland
very willingly got into it with us. He spoke
but little, and appeared very thoughtful during
our journey.</P>
<P>The coachman stopped at an inn, after we
had driven about fifteen miles, to bate his
horses for a while. He seemed startled at it,
and said he would not alight. We told him
there was no occasion, but your brother and
I chose to go into the house, that he might
not think we watched him He seemed pleas∣ed
at this, and smiled when we set forward
again, but did not speak.</P>
<P>When we arrived in London, Now, Sir,
said I, we will, if you please, go directly to
Mrs. Arnold's house. As I am sure your
<PB N="380" REF="381"/>
absenting yourself in the manner you did,
exceedingly afflicted her, so am I certain your
return will give her sincere joy. I am ready
therefore to attend you immediately to her;
but if I may advise you, I think it were
better that I should first see and talk to her.
It will be proper to prepare her, by giving
her at least one night to reflect on the im∣portant
event, which I expect will take place
to-morrow. Sir George, what are your sen∣timents?
I am of your own mind, replied
your brother; I think my sister ought by all
means to have so much time given her for
recollection. If Faulkland has no objection
to it, we will go to my friend's house, where
he was before. When you have seen my
sister, you may come to us there with her de∣termination.</P>
<P>I have submitted myself for the present,
answered Mr. Faulkland, to your guidance.
To-morrow remember I am to be at liberty.
Bidulph, beware how you watch my motions
again.</P>
<P>Your brother then directed the coachman
to his friend's house, Mr. Faulkland not op∣posing
the motion. I went in for a few mi∣nutes
merely to satisfy myself in what manner
Mr. Faulkland had escaped from thence in
order to inform you.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland was very urgent with me to
go to you. Keep me not long in suspence,
<PB N="381" REF="382"/>
Sir, said he, I may as well know my fate to∣night,
as to-morrow.</P>
<P>I left him with a promise to return with
your final answer. You know <HI>my</HI> sentiments,
you know your brother's, and it rests on you
to pronounce sentence of life or death (for
your answer imports no less) on a man who is
worthy of the greatest queen in the universe.
What do you say, Mrs. Arnold, must Faulk∣land
die?</P>
<P>Heaven forbid, cried I, no, Sir; I should be
inflexible <HI>indeed,</HI> if after what yon have told
me, I were any longer to resist. I yield, Sir,
to your request, to Mr. Falkland's, and to
my brother's; and I will own at the same time
that my heart strongly impels me to consent.
Yet, my dear Sir, believe me I should have
resisted <HI>that</HI> impulse, if I could hope that my
refusal would not be followed by consequences
too dreadful to be thought on. There is
therefore <HI>no</HI> alternative, I <HI>must</HI> be the wife of
Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>The sooner the affair is finished then the
better, said he; Faulkland stands here on slip∣pery
ground; perhaps some of the Bond family
may by this time be arrived in England, and
in pursuit of him; therefore let your marriage
be dispatched immediately, and send him away
directly to Holland. I suppose when he has
made sure of you, he may be prevailed on to
go without you. Oh, Sir, said I, urge this
request to him I beseech you, it is of the last
<PB N="382" REF="383"/>
importance to me that he should comply with
it, and the only preliminary that I have now
to make to our marriage. Yes, yes, answered
my kinsman, I think we shall convince him
of the necessity of this. I shall escort you
to Holland myself, for I have business at
Rotterdam; and I had thoughts of taking
the voyage if this occasion had not offered.
We will but just stay to settle some affairs
here, and observe what measures can be
taken for his service, and then follow him.
Take courage, my dear, continued he, see∣ing
me look sad, all may come right again.
I love out-of-the-way adventures, and this
I think <HI>is</HI> one. We will live like princes let
us go where we will. I only wish that your
brother were <HI>against</HI> the match, that I might
have the more pleasure in forwarding it;
but I need not grudge him that <HI>once</HI> in
his life he has shewn some token of genero∣sity.</P>
<P>I will return to Faulkland, I long to set
his noble heart at ease. Strange perverse
creatures your sex are! it amazes me that
any thing could tempt you to reject such a
man! were I a woman, I should run mad
for him. Well, I will go to him, and let
him know without any farther demurs, you
will give him your hand to-morrow morn∣ing.
Our honest friend Price I think may
join you. I will call on him, after I have
seen Faulkland, to bid him prepare for the
<PB N="383" REF="384"/>
business. I will myself have the pleasure of
giving you away. Good by—and away he
went with a pleased busy countenance.</P>
<P>I took up my pen as soon as he departed,
and have scribbled thus far without suffering
any reflections to stop me. Let me now lay
down my pen, to pause before I leap into
the frightful precipice that opens before
me …………………
…… To-morrow! Ah, my Cecilia,
what is that morrow to produce? it joins
me for ever to Mr. Faulkland! the chosen
of my heart, my first love! the man who
adores me; who deserves all my affection,
who has obliged me beyond all recompence.
Who has a claim to my warmest gratitude,
to my esteem, to my whole heart. I save
his life, I have the power to make him hap∣py;
my brother, my kinsman urge me;
my own heart too prompts me. Why can
not I then reconcile myself to my lot? Oh
that question is answered by a fearful image
that starts up to my fancy—I am not super∣stitious,
yet believe me, my dear, I am at
this instant chilled with horror.</P>
<P>I am ashamed to confess my weakness,
but I must call Patty to sit with me the re∣mainder
of the night. I cannot think of rest!</P>
<P>Wednesday Morning.</P>
<P>I have passed the whole night in endea∣vouring
to fortify my mind against the im∣portant
<PB N="384" REF="385"/>
event that a few hours will accom∣plish.
If Mr. Faulkland's mind should again
become tranquil, which my kinsman gave
me room to hope would be the consequence
of gratifying the ardent wish of his soul, I
must take care not to disturb it, by shewing
any reluctance in yielding him my hand.
Had an Angel <HI>once</HI> told me that I should
give my hand <HI>reluctantly</HI> to Mr. Faulkland,
I would not have believed it; yet fatally cir∣cumstanced
as our marriage <HI>now</HI> is, it can∣not
be otherwise.</P>
<P>And yet I <HI>ought</HI> to be his. I owe him a
great sacrifice, and I am about to pay it.
I am dressed and ready. I wait for my
kinsman, or my brother, one of whom, or
both perhaps, will be here presently ….
………… Mr. Warner is come;
I have but just time to tell you that my bro∣ther
and Mr. Price are with Mr. Faulkland,
My kinsman says, he is quite a new man.
They wait for me, I go. Heaven guide my
steps …………………</P>
<P><HI>Thursday.</HI>—My fate is accomplished! What
a change! Join with me, my dear Cecilia,
in beseeching heaven to look graciously down
on me in my new state, and to guide and
protect my beloved Mr. Faulkland, my ever
destined husband. Alas! my dear, he is
now many miles separated from me.</P>
<P>The worthy Mr. Price performed the sa∣cred
ceremony. Mr. Warner did the office
<PB N="385" REF="386"/>
of a father. He and my brother were all
who were present.</P>
<P>There is something so amazing in all
this, I can scarce credit my senses; but my
life has been a series of strange, strange
events!</P>
<P>I am so bewildered, I cannot connect my
thoughts; but I will try to give you my
yesterday's <HI>vision,</HI> for I can hardly persuade
myself that what I recollect really happened.</P>
<P>I broke off just as Mr. Warner called on
me, to carry me to the house of my brother's
friend.</P>
<P>While we were in the coach, he told me,
that having the night before informed Mr.
Faulkland of the joyful news of my consent∣ing
to marry him the next day, he seemed
at first to doubt, and repeatedly conjured
him not to deceive him; 'till having received
the most solemn assurances of its being true,
Mr. Faulkland gave himself up to such ex∣tacies,
as made them apprehensive his joy
might have effects almost as fatal in their
consequences, as his despair was likely to
produce before.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner had a mind to lower him a lit∣tle,
and thought, by putting him in mind of
his danger, somewhat to allay his transports.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold's consent to make you happy,
said he, fills me with extreme joy; but it is
not now a time, to indulge it: you are here
in peril of your life; you must preserve it
<PB N="386" REF="387"/>
now for Mrs. Arnold's sake. For Mrs. Ar∣nold's
sake! he replied with ecstasy, yes,
yes, 'tis now worth preserving. Mr. War∣ner,
Kinsman, Friend of my life, (grasping
his hand) dispose of me as you please; you
shall guide all my steps. Will not Mrs.
Arnold go with me after we are made one?</P>
<P>If, after having considered what may be
urged to you on that head, you should still
continue to desire it, replied my cousin, she
will without doubt accompany you. But,
my dear Sir, consider, circumstanced as you
now are, what will the world say, should
she accompany your flight? It will fix an
indelible stain on her character, which is
dearer to her than life, and which I am sure,
upon cooler thoughts, you will prize at an
equal value. This marriage will be a pro∣found
secret to the world; it may remain so
as long as we please. I have business in
Holland, which will demand my presence
there in a very short time. Her accompany∣ing
me thither can give rise to no suspicion.
I will dispatch my affairs with all possible
speed, and conduct her to you.</P>
<P>The joy that before lighted up his counte∣nance,
pursued my cousin, seemed a little
clouded. He took a turn or two about the
room, as if to consider of what I had said;
then, addressing himself jointly to your bro∣ther
and me. You are both cooler than I am;
perhaps you may judge better; let me but
<PB N="387" REF="388"/>
call her <HI>mine,</HI> I will then do as you would
have me. I cannot determine on any thing
now.</P>
<P>As soon as my sister and you are married,
said Sir George, I think, Faulkland, you
ought to get out of England with all the
speed you can. It will be but a short ab∣sence;
Sidney will soon follow you. What
do you purpose doing in regard to your son?
I had forgot him, cried Mr. Faulkland.
Poor child! My heart has been in such tu∣mults
since Mr. Warner came in, that I
could think of nothing but the blessed news
he has brought me. But I must not neglect my
boy. I will write to the honest servant that
I left behind; he shall bring him over: You,
my dear Bidulph, will take care of him, 'till
an opportunity offers of sending him to me.</P>
<P>I hope there will be no need, replied your
brother, of sending him out of England;
your affairs may yet turn out so as to permit
your return into your own country.—Im∣possible!
interrupted Mr. Faulkland: if
Smyth should even recover, <HI>his</HI> representation
of the other accident cuts off every hope.
He will not, for his own sake, confess the
truth, but impute the error of my fatal hand
to premeditated guilt. Heaven knows,
base as she was, I would not have attempted
her life; but I was born to be the avenger of
those crimes, into the commission of which I,
perhaps, first led her. As for the contempti∣ble
<PB N="388" REF="389"/>
villain who wronged me, I do not repent
of the punishment I inflicted on him; though
probably, had I been allowed a moment's
time for recollection, I might have taken
vengeance in a manner more worthy of
myself.</P>
<P>I was delighted, proceeded Mr. Warner,
to find him so cool and rational in his reflexi∣ons.
He continued talking calmly and reason∣ably
on the subject of his misfortunes; but on
the mention of your name, started again into
transports; but they now seemed to be only
those of joy, upon the prospect of what was
to happen the next day.</P>
<P>After I left him, I went to Mr. Price, who
promised to be in readiness at the appointed
hour.</P>
<P>We were now got to the house of my bro∣ther's
friend. Mr Warner led me up stairs
into the room, where Sir George, Mr. Faulk∣land,
and Mr. Price, were sitting together.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland was so agitated at the sight
of me, that having risen to salute me, he
was not able to speak; but seizing both my
hands, he kissed them fervently one after the
other, tears dropping on them as he held
them to his lips. Every one was silent; we
were all too much affected to speak. My
brother was the first that broke silence. Well,
Faulkland, said he, have we not kept our
promise?</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland turned towards him: Oh,
<PB N="389" REF="390"/>
Bidulph, forgive me for doubting; I am
afraid I have used you ill: Can you pardon
the madness that I was driven to by despair?
—Mr. Warner, Mrs. Arnold, I believe you
think me distracted. Indeed I am not. I
was only—(and he seemed to hesitate for a
word) weary of life.—I thought I had lost
every thing.—The world was grown a de∣sart.
—No one in it for me.</P>
<P>You formed a wrong judgment, my dear
Sir, answered Mr. Warner; you find your∣self
now with your sincere friends; Sir George
and myself are both so; and your bride,
your dear Mrs. Arnold, is ready to give you
her hand. I <HI>am,</HI> Sir, said I, and if your
happiness still depends on me, it gives me
joy that I have at length the power of <HI>be∣stowing</HI>
it.</P>
<P>I have no <HI>words,</HI> he replied, I can <HI>find</HI> none,
it is all <HI>here;</HI> and he laid his hand on his
heart, his eyes fixed with delight on my face.</P>
<P>I beheld him now, my Cecilia, in a light
in which I had never before viewed him;
overwhelmed by misfortunes, of which I ac∣cused
myself as being the author. I saw him
an exile, likely to be deprived of a noble
fortune, his heart pierced with remorse for an
involuntary crime, I saw too that he loved me;
loved me with a servent and unconquerable
passion. Of this, in the anguish of his soul,
at a time when he was wrought up to phrenzy,
he had given but too strong demonstration.
<PB N="390" REF="391"/>
Shall I own it to you, my Cecilia, I think I
never loved him as I did in that moment.</P>
<P>My heart was at once assailed by a variety
of passions; amongst which, gratitude, and
the softest compassion, were predominant.</P>
<P>I continued silent, whilst Mr. Faulkland
remained ardently gazing at me.</P>
<P>My brother, I believe, thought us too so∣lemn;
the occasion indeed required it: but
his fears for Mr. Faulkland made him wish
to give the scene a livelier turn.</P>
<P>Come sister, said he, let us not defer the
happy event for which we are now met, we
have no time to waste in ceremony. You
remember what our mother used to say,
“Many things fall out between the cup and
the lip.” My brother rose off his chair as
he said this. Mr. Warner taking the hint,
approached, and took me by the hand. Let
<HI>me,</HI> said he, to Mr. Faulkland, have the hap∣piness
of bestowing this best of Creatures on
the man that I think <HI>best</HI> deserves her.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland made no reply; but in tak∣ing
the hand that my kinsman put into his,
his looks spoke the rapture that swelled his
heart; though I saw he put a constraint upon
himself, and endeavoured to assume a deport∣ment
suitable to the important and solemn
occasion.</P>
<P>After the indissoluble knot was tied, my
brother desired Mr. Faulkland to retire with
him into the next room for a few minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="392"/>
I concluded it was in order to press his de∣parture,
and to prevail on him to submit to
going without me</P>
<P>This I found afterwards was the subject of
their conversation.</P>
<P>They returned to us in about a quarter of
an hour, Mr. Faulkland's countenance less
embarrassed than it was at going out of the
room. On their entering, Mr. Price took his
leave. My brother addressed Mr. Warner
and me. Faulkland, said he, is convinced
of the necessity there is for his immediately
withdrawing from England, and he is de∣termined
to depart from hence at three
o'clock to morrow morning; for I would by
no means have him leave London by day-light,
as we know not who may be on the
watch to trace his steps. He has consented
that you, sister, should remain behind till
Mr. Warner's affairs will permit him to
conduct you over. In the mean time master
Faulkland is to be brought from Ireland;
and if you should not be ready to depart be∣fore
his arrival, you may take him over with
you to Holland.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland seemed rather to <HI>suffer</HI> my
brother to make this explanation for him,
than to assent chearfully to it. Mr. War∣ner
and I however, laid hold of it, and im∣mediately
entered into discourse on the sub∣ject
of our domestic concerns, and the mea∣sures
<PB N="392" REF="393"/>
proper to be observed on so critical an
occasion.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland joined in the conversation
with the utmost composure; and to my un∣speakable
joy seemed perfectly settled and
collected in his mind. I thought indeed he
appeared a little constrained, and that he
seemed to keep a constant guard over him∣self,
left he should betray any symptom of a
too much heated imagination: but my kins∣man
afterwards observed with pleasure to
me, that this denoted nothing more than a
consciousness in Mr. Faulkland of the un∣happy
wandering that had before so much
alarmed us all; and into which he was sure
there was not the least danger of his relapsing,
as his heart was now perfectly at ease.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland told us he had letters to
write to Ireland, which he would dispatch,
that he might have nothing to interrupt the
few short hours we had to pass together in
the evening.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner said he had business to do
that called him away, but that he would re∣turn
after dinner: and my brother (that
Mr. Faulkland might be quite undisturbed)
proposed my going home with him, and that
we should come back together in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland did not object to this, and
I went with Sir George.</P>
<P>We returned early in the afternoon to
Mr. Faulkland. As my brother had let his
<PB N="393" REF="394"/>
friend into our secret, we passed up stairs
without any notice being taken of us.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland had writ two letters; one
of them very long, to Mr. Bond, which he
gave my brother to read, but I know not the
contents of it. The other was to that careful
honest servant whom he had mentioned to us,
with orders to bring over Master Faulkland
with all convenient speed, and put him into
Sir George's hands.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner but just called in upon us in
the evening, he said he had been making the
necessary preparations for Mr. Faulkland's
journey; and that having resolved himself
to attend him as far as Harwich, he would,
at the hour appointed, call on him in a coach,
which should carry them a few miles out of
town, where the horses were to wait for
them.</P>
<P>Worthy, compassionate, and generous kins∣man,
how I love you for the honest warmth
of your heart!</P>
<P>My brother and Mr. Faulkland had a great
deal of discourse about the necessary measures
that were to be taken by us all; and we
passed the evening in a kind of chastened
satisfaction, which could not arise to happi∣ness
from the near prospect we had of part∣ing.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock my brother took an
affectionate leave of his friend, he excused
himself from accompanying him on his
<PB N="394" REF="395"/>
journey, on account of Lady Sarah's not
being well.</P>
<P>To see <HI>such</HI> a parting, would at another
time have deeply affected me, but my own
hour of separation drew near. It came, and
Mr. Warner, punctual to his time, hurried
Mr. Faulkland almost by force into the coach,
and drove off with him.</P>
<P>I threw myself into a chair which he had
ordered for me, and was carried home. I
went not to bed; but had recourse to my
pen. God preserve my dear fugitive! I can
do nothing but weep.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 2.—My mind was too much unsettled
yesterday to dictate any thing coherent. I
am now, thank heaven, more composed. Sir
George and Lady Sarah have been with me
during the greatest part of the day; both
kind and consoling. My brother seems to
have all his former affection for me revived
in his heart; he is indeed charmed with my
justice, as he calls it. Lady Sarah, who at the
bottom of her heart is no way concerned
about this event, affects however to think as
her husband does, and commends me for my
generosity.</P>
<P>I feel myself easier in proportion as I think
Mr. Faulkland gets farther out of the reach
of danger. Sir George says by this time he
may be on his voyage.</P>
<P>I shall certainly wait till the child arrives,
in order to take him with me. My two little
<PB N="395" REF="396"/>
girls will be fond of such a brother, for he
is a charming boy.</P>
<P>My brother flatters me with a possibility
at least of Major Smyth's recovering; and
if so, he says that Mr. Faulkland may stand
his trial for the other accident, as he is in
hopes Smyth will not persist in his villainy so
far as to add, perjury to his other crimes.</P>
<P>I have but little expectations of justice
from so bad a man, but I would not dis∣courage
my friends in their endeavours to
comfort me.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 3.—Mr. Warner is returned from
Harwich, after having seen Mr. Faulkland
safe on board the packet, and even under sail
for Holland.</P>
<P>What a benevolent heart has this good
relation of mine! Indeed I dearly love and
respect him. His return has revived my
spirits, and I begin to lose my fears. He
brought me a short letter from Mr. Faulk∣land;
short it is, but his heart speaks in every
syllable of it. I will not give you the con∣tents,
my Cecilia, you will think it too ex∣travagant,
too romantic, for a husband to
write so to his wife.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 6.—I long, yet dread to hear ac∣counts
from Ireland. I fear that wretched
Smyth is dead. No mail has arrived from
thence these eight days. Contrary winds
they tell me detain the packets on the other
side very often for a fortnight together. If
<PB N="396" REF="397"/>
that be so, how fortunate was Mr. Faulkland
in seizing on a lucky hour for his departure
from the Irish shore.</P>
<P>I suppose Mr. Bond's family, whom he
must have rendered very unhappy, particu∣larly
the daughter, are all now his implaca∣ble
enemies; and are tormenting themselves
in being detained from the pursuit of their
vengeance. But let them come now when
they will, he is far out of the reach of his
foes.</P>
<P>I would it were possible for my Cecilia to
arrive in England before my departure for
Holland. Indeed, my dear, I shall not be
sorry if I am detained from Mr. Faulkland,
till I have the happiness of first embracing
you, as our separation may be afterwards of
a long continuance. I shall wait for the
arrival of Master Faulkland, and who knows
but adverse winds may detain him till your
return. Oh! that I may pass, though it be
but one day, with the dear companion of my
youth before we are again divided!</P>
<P>I will not send this packet off, till I am
ready to depart from England, as that will be
closing an important period of my Life.
What would I give that my dearest friend
would come, and instead of this tedious nar∣rative
which I have written, receive the ac∣count
from my own lips! If my wishes
should not be granted in this, cannot you
make Holland your way home? Mr. Faulk∣land
<PB N="397" REF="398"/>
purposes staying at the Hague till I go
to him.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 9.—Cecilia! have I been a murmurer
at the decrees of providence? have I been
an impious repiner when heaven has poured
down its wrath upon my head? if not, why
am I marked out for divine vengeance? be∣fore
I lose my senses, or my life, for both I
cannot retain, hear the last act of your friend's
tragic story.</P>
<P>My brother called on me this day; he
gave me a letter directed to Mr. Faulkland,
which came under a cover to him. Read it,
said he, it is from Ireland, and may contain
something material for us to know.</P>
<P>It was from the honest servant Mr. Faulk∣land
left behind him. See what he says,
and then tell me if I ought to live any longer.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“Honoured Sir,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I have the happiness to send you a piece
of good news, which made me wish for
wings to have flown over to you with it.”</P>
<P>“My lady, heaven be praised, is not dead,
nor so much as hurt. I am thankful for
this, Sir, on your account, not her's.”</P>
<P>“I don't know what possessed the people
at Mr. Bond's, to tell me she was dead;
the mistake, to be sure, was occasioned by
the great confusion the family were thrown
into, and indeed, from what I myself saw
I was sure she was actually dead.”</P>
<P>“Major Smyth lived till the surgeon came;
<PB N="398" REF="399"/>
but had been speechless for two or three
hours, and died whilst his wound was pro∣bing.</P>
<P>“My lady had only fallen into a fit, and
the major having bled prodigiously, she re∣ceived
a great deal of his blood upon her
linen, and as he afterwards contrived to
throw himself on the bed, which was at
some distance from the place where she had
fallen, it gave occasion to Mrs. Bond, (who
was herself the first person that entered the
room, after the sad accident) on finding
my lady lying senseless, pale, and bloody
on the floor to suppose she had been
killed.”</P>
<P>“This alarm ran through the family, and
was confirmed to me by every one in it,
as we servants soon quitted the chamber;
and the major himself said, that you dis∣charged
one of the pistols at your lady, and
the other at him.”</P>
<P>“I returned to Mr. Bond's in the morning,
after you were gone off, to enquire whether
Major Smyth was alive or not; he was just
then dead.”</P>
<P>“The waiting-maid informed me, that
my lady, to their great surprize, was reco∣vered,
having only been in a fainting fit,
which held her above an hour, without her
shewing any signs of life; and that she had
fallen from one to another 'till morning:
and she farther said, (begging your honour's
<PB N="399" REF="400"/>
pardon) it would be no great matter if she
had died in one; for she believed it was
for no good she went in the major's room
at that time of the night.”</P>
<P>“I staid about the house all the day to pick
up what intelligence I could from the ser∣vants.
Young Mr. Bond, with two or three
men went to your house, and not finding
you there, I suppose rode in pursuit of you;
but heaven be praised, you have escaped
their hands.”</P>
<P>“The waiting-maid, who is a very civil
young woman, told me in the evening,
that my lady, being come a little to herself,
(though I believe not in a right mind) was
informed of the major's death; at which
she was so exceedingly terrified, that,
finding herself ill besides, she confessed the
whole truth of the matter, and proved,
that the major died with a lie in his mouth:
so that I hope Mr. Bond's family will not
be so spiteful as to prosecute the affair any
farther.”</P>
<P>“My lady was sent home directly in the
chariot, as they could not bear the sight of
her any longer in the house. She takes
on mightily; but we all bless ourselves,
that she is alive.”</P>
<P>“I shall make bold to inclose this, accord∣ing
to your order, to Sir George Bidulph;
and as soon as I receive your commands
<PB N="400" REF="401"/>
about Master, shall make no delay in this
unlucky place. I am,”</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Adieu, my Cecilia, adieu; nothing but
my death should close such a scene as this.</P>
<P>Here to the editor's great disappointment,
Mrs. Arnold's interesting story broke off;
that unhappy lady not having continued her
journal any farther.</P>
<P>But as this seemed to be one of the most
affecting periods of her life, his curiosity in∣duced
him to enquire of the gentleman from
whom he received those papers, whether
he could give him any farther light into her
story; as he thought it not improbable that
he might have learned, from his mother,
some other particulars relating to her.</P>
<P>His friend told him that he knew his mo∣ther
had drawn up a narrative of the subse∣quent
remarkable events in the life of Mrs.
Arnold, at the request of a particular friend;
that he had once heard it read; but, as he
was then a boy, it made but little impression
upon him; that afterwards, when he wanted
to have his curiosity gratified, his mother
told him, she could not find the manuscript,
and feared it was lost. However, he said,
<PB N="401" REF="402"/>
he would search her papers, and, if he re∣covered
it, it should be at his service.</P>
<P>After some time the gentleman informed
the editor, that he had made the strictest
scrutiny into his mother's papers, and could
find nothiny relative to the subject of Mrs.
Arnold, excepting a few loose sheets, which
seemed to have been the foul copy of the be∣ginning
of her narrative; and, at the same
time, put them into his hands.</P>
<P>These the editor offers to the public, as
he received them, without any alteration or
addition.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>CECILIA's NARRATIVE, &amp;c.
BEING
A SUPPLEMENT to Mrs. ARNOLD's
JOURNAL.</HEAD>
<P>I Set out on my return for England, im∣mediately
after the receipt of her last jour∣nal,
the melancholy close of which had ex∣ceedingly
terrified and afflicted me.</P>
<P>Immediately on my arrival in London, I
flew to the dear friend of my heart; she was
still at her house in Pall-mall.</P>
<P>I found the dear Sidney alone, in her
bed-chamber. She had been prepared to
receive me; but, though I had endeavoured
to arm myself with resolution for this af∣fecting
<PB N="402" REF="403"/>
interview, I was not mistress of my∣self
at the sight of her.</P>
<P>The tears I shed, did not spring from that
sweet emotion, which long severed friends
feel at seeing each other again; I wept in
sorrow for the heavy misfortunes of the best
of women.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Arnold, still herself, and su∣perior
to adversity, received me with the
tenderest marks of friendship, and with a
composure that amazed me.</P>
<P>Piety, meekness, and patience, were ever
Mrs. Arnold's characteristicks; and they now
all appeared blended, and so strongly impres∣sed
on her beautiful face, that I could not
look at her without admiration.</P>
<P>As I was astonished to find her so calm
under so trying an affliction, I could not help
expressing myself to that purpose; but Mrs.
Arnold checked me, with this reply: “I have
been set up as a mark, my Cecilia; let me
fulfil the intention of my Maker, by shew∣ing
a perfect resignation to His will. I
hope, my task is almost finished, and that
he will soon permit me to return to the dust
from which I came.”</P>
<P>Frederick Hildy had arrived from Ire∣land
above a fortnight before, with Master
Faulkland, a beautiful child of about six
years old. They were both lodged in Mrs.
Arnold's house.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="404"/>
She told me, that Sir George Bidulph and
Mr. Warner had set out together for Holland,
immediately after the receipt of the letter,
which informed them of Mrs. Falkland's
being alive.</P>
<P>My brother, said Mrs. Arnold, thought
it necessary himself to be the bearer of news
so fatal in its import to his friend. He hop∣ed,
besides, he should be able to persuade
him to return and stand his trial for having
killed Major Smyth, as there is no doubt
of his being acquitted; all Mr. Bond's fa∣mily
being now convinced, from Mrs. Faulk∣land's
own confession, that there was no∣thing
premeditated in this fatal event, and that
what Mr. Faulkland did was in defence of
his own life.</P>
<P>I have writ, continued she, to Mr. Faulk∣land,
to endeavour to console him under our
mutual misfortune.</P>
<P>At my request, she shewed me a copy
of this letter; wherein she assured him, she
would take the tenderest care of his son,
'till the child could be delivered safe into
his hands; and conjured him, for that child's
sake, to be careful of his own interest and
preservation; adding, that as their ill-fated
marriage was an absolute secret to
every one but the persons immediately
concerned, she hoped he would not suffer
the thoughts of it to break in upon his fu∣ture
quiet; and concluded with beseech∣ing
<PB N="404" REF="405"/>
him to forget her, as they were never
more to meet.</P>
<P>This was the substance of what she wrote.
There were no murmurings at her fate,
no womanish complainings, mixed with the
tender, yet noble sentiments of her heart,
She endeavoured to conceal her own anguish
under the mask of contentment, that Mr.
Faulkand might the better support this final
destruction of all his hopes.</P>
<P>I asked her, whether she had heard since
from Mr. Faulkland? She told me, she had
as yet received no answer from him to this
letter, but that she had heard severally from
Sir George and Mr. Warner, who both in∣formed
her, that Mr. Faulkland, after his
first transports of surprize and grief were
over, at receiving this new and unexpected
blow, had grown more calm, and seemed
inclined to return with them to England.
Sir George added, in the last letter she had
from him, that they only waited 'till Mr.
Warner had accomplished the business that
he had to do in Holland, and hoped, before
a fortnight was at an end, to return home,
and to have the pleasure of conducting Mr.
Faulkland back.</P>
<P>It is ten days, continued Mrs. Arnold,
since I received this account, and I flatter
myself, that they may be now on their jour∣ney
homeward.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="406"/>
Mrs. Arnold said, that she waited but for
Sir George's return, in order to deliver Master
Faulkland into his hands, and that she then
meant to retire into the country, with her two
children, and Patty, the faithful companion
and partner of her grief.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah Bidulph, who would gladly
have gone with Sir George to Holland, had
been persuaded by him to stay behind, in
order to bear his sister company in her
affliction; and Mrs. Arnold said, she had
dedicated much of her time to that friendly
purpose.</P>
<P>Her Ladyship came to pay her a visit
whilst I was there. I had never seen Lady
Sarah before; and we were introduced to
each other.</P>
<P>I took my leave of Mrs. Arnold, and pro∣mised
to see her again the next day.</P>
<P>In the morning, as I was preparing to go
to her, I received a note from Lady Sarah
Bidulph, earnestly requesting the favour of
seeing me, at her house, in St. James's Square,
before I went to Mrs. Arnold.</P>
<P>I obeyed this unexpected summons, and im∣mediately
waited on her.</P>
<P>I took the liberty, Madam, said she, of de∣siring
to see you here this morning, at Sir
George's request: He arrived late last night,
and brings most melancholy news from
Holland.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="407"/>
Sir George entered the room while she
spoke. After the first greetings of friends
long parted were over, I am afraid to ask,
Sir George, said I, yet am impatient to learn
something of Mr. Faulkland, your lady has
terribly alarmed me; Mr. Faulkland is not
returned; I dare not enquire the reason.
Tears instantly sprung into Sir George's eyes.
He returns to more, said he, his remains are
soon to be conveyed to England to be laid
with his ancestors.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir, cried I, what will poor Mrs. Arnold
say to this fresh misfortune?</P>
<P>It was on that account, Madam, he replied,
that we now requested to speak with you, be∣fore
you saw my sister. You, who are her
bosom friend, can more tenderly disclose this
melancholy event than any one. I have not
the courage to see her. We must beg of
you, dear Madam, to prepare the unhappy
Sidney for the news.</P>
<P>I asked him the manner of Mr. Faulkland's
death. I cannot positively say, answered Sir
George, but much I fear he precipitated his
own fate.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner, or I, constantly staid with
him from the time we disclosed the fatal
account we brought concerning Mrs. Faulk∣land.
Knowing as we did the violence of
his temper, we were apprehensive of sudden
and dreadful consequences; but he deceiv∣ed
us both; for after the first starts of
<PB N="407" REF="408"/>
passion were over, which though they shock∣ed,
did not alarm us, as we expected them,
he assumed a calm resignation to his fate;
and talked with such a rational composure
of the strange circumstances of this inci∣dent,
that we began to entertain hopes, that
the efforts of his reason, joined to our con∣stant
endeavours to sooth and console him,
would in time so far succeed, as though we
never expected to see him restored to a
tranquil state of mind, we yet flattered our∣selves
he would submit to life upon such
terms as Providence thought fit to impose on
him.</P>
<P>I was with him, proceeded Sir George,
when he received a letter from my sister.
His hands shook so on perceiving by the
superscription that it came from her, that he
let the letter drop. Read it for me, Bidulph,
said he, and tell me how it fears with Mrs.
Arnold.</P>
<P>I instantly complied with his request. I
found by the date of the letter that it had been
delayed much longer than it ought to have
been, which I immediately observed to him,
as he had often expressed his uneasiness at not
hearing from my sister.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold is well, said I, giving him the
letter; read what she says, and let her teach
you fortitude.</P>
<P>He withdrew to a window to peruse it.
After he had read it, I admire your sister's
<PB N="408" REF="409"/>
stoicism, said he, stepping back to his chair.
This is true philosophy, laying his finger
on the letter which he still held in his hand.
<HI>Her</HI> heroic soul is still unmoved, and above
the reach of adversity. Happy Mrs. Arnold.
—What a vain fool was I to think that
such a mind as <HI>hers</HI> could be subdued. He
paused and seemed for a while buried in
thought. Then putting the letter up in his
pocket, lie began to discourse on some other
topic.</P>
<P>We passed the evening together, continued
Sir George, and though Faulkland was far
from being chearful, I thought he appeared
more tranquil than he had done since my
arrival.</P>
<P>I talked to him of his returning to England
with me. He said with a smile, I think I
ought. to go if it were for no other reason
but that I may have my dust mingled with
that of my forefather's; and this office, Bi∣dulph,
I expect from you, if you should out∣live
me.</P>
<P>I laughed at him, and said I thought he had
a much more material reason that pressed his
return.</P>
<P>Your estate, said I, is unsettled; and if you
were to die abroad in the predicament in
which you now stand, what is to become of
your son?</P>
<P>I have already done for my son, said he, all
<PB N="409" REF="410"/>
that I thought in justice was in my power to
do: I have long ago settled my personal for∣tune
on him, that in case my next heirs,
should on account of the illegitimacy of his
birth, claim the family estate, he may have a
handsome support without it.</P>
<P>And indeed I never wished to debar my
lawful heirs in favour of this child; though I
love him tenderly, and they are worthless peo∣ple,
whom I despise, and with whom I never
had any intercourse.</P>
<P>I replied, if that were so, as the manner of
the child's birth was a secret, I wished he
might, undisturbed, inherit his father's fortune,
when he should come to pay the last debt to
nature.</P>
<P>He answered, where such a vast property
was at stake, there would not be people
wanting whose interest would engage them
to discover the secret; and he doubted not
but the irregularity of his wife's conduct,
had already occasioned enquiries to be
made.</P>
<P>Supposing, said I, you had had another
son by Mrs. Faulkland since your marriage
—as you could have no objection to the
bequeathing your fortune to him, would it
not have appeared strange in the eyes of the
world that you should disinherit your eldest
son?</P>
<P>It might have appeared so, said he, but
I certainly should have done it: and for
<PB N="410" REF="411"/>
that reason, as I have no child but him, I
have made such a disposition of my fortune
as I now tell you. If I live, I may increase
my son's patrimony; if not he must be
contented with that which I have bequeath∣ed
to him, and let my kindred scramble for
the rest.</P>
<P>We staid together till it was late; he dis∣coursed
on a variety of subjects, but mention∣ed
not my sister's name during the whole
time.</P>
<P>I thought I left him well, and his mind to∣lerably
composed. We were to set out on our
return in six days; but an account was brought
to me in the morning, that Mr. Faulkland
was found dead in his bed.</P>
<P>There were no symptoms discovered on the
body that could let us into the occasion of his
death; but as my own fears suggested too
much, I chose not to be particular in my en∣quiries.
Wishing rather that his fatal story
should be buried in silence.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner found that his affairs were
likely to delay him longer than the time pro∣posed;
and as I had nothing farther to detain
me in Holland, I set out the day after my un∣fortunate
friend's death, leaving to Mr. War∣ner,
the care of conveying his remains to
England, agreeably to the desire he had ex∣pressed,
which I now considered as his last in∣junction
laid on me.</P>
<P>Thus, proceeded Sir George, by a series of
<PB N="411" REF="412"/>
fatal events, each of which was occasioned by
motives in themselves laudable, has one of
the bravest and most noble minded men on
earth been cut off in the prime of his youth
—Oh! Faulkland, why did you suffer that
gallant spirit to be vanquished?—</P>
<P>Sir George's emotion stopped his farther
speech. I was too much affected to say any
thing to him, but took a hasty leave of Lady
Sarah, in order to go to Mrs. Arnold.</P>
<P>As soon as I entered my friend's room,
Cecilia, said she, if your countenance be as
faithful an interpreter of your mind as it used
to be, you have some thing disasterous to re∣late;
you may say any thing, misfortune and
I have been so familiar, I shall not shrink at
its approach.</P>
<P>Sir George is returned, I replied, you will
see him to-day.</P>
<P>Is he come alone, she asked? Alone, I
replied. You but repeat my words, Cecilia,
without adding any thing from yourself. Shall
I interpret the meaning of that mournful echo?
Mr. Faulkland no longer lives!</P>
<P>I was silent—Oh I knew him too well, said
she, raising her voice with energy, to think he
would survive this last blow.</P>
<P>His death was natural, said I, for any thing
that appeared to the contrary. God be prais∣ed
for that, cried Mrs. Arnold! <HI>If</HI> so, I am
satisfied that he is at peace.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="413"/>
She then enquired after Mr. Warner, and
her brother, without making any farther
mention of Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>Whilst we were in discourse, Master Faulk∣land
ran into the room. He had been at
play with the two little Miss Arnolds, who
were in pursuit of him, and he flew to Mrs.
Arnold to hide him. She folded him tenderly
in her arms; then turning to me, look at this
boy, said she, he is the perfect image of his
father.</P>
<P>When am I to go to my papa? cried the
child, as he hung round her neck: this in∣nocent
unexpected demand quite vanquished
Mrs. Arnold's fortitude. She set him down,
without being able to answer his question;
then said, Excuse me, my Cecilia, I would
wish to be alone for to-day. It was not yet
a season to administer consolation, and I with∣drew.</P>
<P>She staid in London but two days after
this; when, as she had before resolved, she
retired to an estate in Buckinghamshire,
which her kinsman had purchased and settled
on her for ever.</P>
<P>With her brother's consent, she took Ma∣ster
Faulkland with her, and prevailed on
Mr. Price to accompany her into the country,
to whom she committed the care of the
child's education.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner, whom she had acquainted
by letter with her intention, approved of the
<PB N="413" REF="414"/>
step she had taken. He returned to Eng∣land
in about three weeks after her depar∣ture
from her house in town, which she had
left for his reception, just as he had fitted it
up for her.</P>
<P>Before I accompany Mrs. Arnold into her
solitude, I shall just briefly mention some
other persons, who were connected with her
story.</P>
<P>The relations of Mr. Faulkland, as he had
foreseen, claimed his estate, and at length
obtained it, the illegitimacy of the child be∣ing
proved.</P>
<P>The wretched Mrs. Faulkland, abandoned
and despised, returned to England; but as
she was there hated and shunned by every
one, she remained in obscurity for a few
years, and then died unpitied and unla∣mented.</P>
<P>I now return to Mrs. Arnold, who, set∣tled
in her quiet retreat in the country, it
might be hoped, would have passed the re∣mainder
of her days undisturbed by any new
calamity.</P>
<P>That only source of true heroism of soul,
religion, had all along supported, and pre∣vented
her from sinking under the most try∣ing
afflictions. Many and bitter were the
sufferings she had already endured; but she
was, to use her own words, <HI>Set up as a
mark;</HI> and the deep afflictions that still pur∣sued
her, and clouded even her latter days
<PB N="414" REF="415"/>
with misfortunes, may serve to shew, that it
is not <HI>here</HI> that true virtue is to look for its
reward. I saw her at a time when this re∣flection,
as it had been her chief, so was it
her last and only consolation.</P>
<P>Possessed as she was of an admirable un∣derstanding,
and an enlarged mind, in the
deepest solitude she had always resources of
entertainment within herself. Her natural
disposition, ever sweet and complying, was
improved by her sufferings into a patience
very rare in woman; and a resignation im∣bibed
at first from a rigid education, was
heightened by religion into an almost saint∣like
meekness and humility.</P>
<P>I shall pass over the first ten years of her
retirement, in which nothing material hap∣pened,
but the marriage of the amiable Patty
Main to a gentleman of a large estate, and
the death of her worthy kinsman Mr. War∣ner,
who bequeathed her his whole fortune.</P>
<P>Miss Arnold, her eldest daughter, was
now something more than fifteen, and ful∣filled
the promise her childhood gave, of her
being a perfect beauty. Miss Cecilia was
about a year younger, and, though not so
handsome as her sister, was accounted one of
the finest young Ladies of her time.</P>
<P>With what delight have I seen this ex∣cellent
mother, whilst these two charming
young creatures were all attention, relate to
<PB N="415" REF="416"/>
them the extraordinary and affecting inci∣dents
of her life.</P>
<P>This, said she, I do, not as a murmurer at
my fate, nor to move your pity at my mis∣fortunes,
but to teach you by my example,
that there is no situation in life exempt from
trouble. It found <HI>me</HI> under the tender care
of the best of parents, it pursued me into
my husband's house. In my virgin state,
when I was a wife, and in my widowhood,
I was equally persecuted.</P>
<P>Poverty, I once thought, would have ex∣empted
me from every ill, but what its own
hand inflicted; and had it remained my com∣panion,
the bitterest misfortune of my life
would have been prevented; for, if wealth
had not accompanied my hand, the world
could not have persuaded me to yield it to
Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>Do not therefore pride yourselves on the
great fortunes you are likely to possess: I
have received no other satisfaction in mine,
than what arose from the benefits I have con∣ferred
on others.</P>
<P>By such lessons as these, did this tender
parent endeavour to fortify their young minds
against the vicissitudes of fortune, and to
teach them, not to place their confidence in
riches.</P>
<P>She dwelt so often upon this theme, that
she seemed to have a pre-sentiment of those
<PB N="416" REF="417"/>
evils, which were now ready to pour in like
a torrent upon her.</P>
<P>Gracious Heaven! how inscrutable are thy
ways! Her affluent fortune, the very cir∣cumstance
which seemed to promise her, in
the eve of life, some compensation for the
miseries she had endured in her early days,
now proved the source of new and dreadful
calamities to her, which, by involving the
unhappy daughters of an unhappy mother,
in scenes of the most exquisite distress, cut
off from her even the last resource of hope
in this life, and rendered the close of her
history still more. ……………

<P>Here the lady's narrative breaks off, and
the editor, not having it in his power, after
the most diligent enquiry, to recover any
more of the manuscript, is, to his great
mortification, compelled to offer this frag∣ment.</P>
