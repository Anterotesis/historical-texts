<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>WO Sea-port Cities mark <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Fame,</L>
<L>They from Commerce different Honours claim.</L>
<L>What different Honours shall the Muses pay,</L>
<L>While one inspires, and one untunes the Lay?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now silver <HI>Isis</HI> bright'ning flows along,</L>
<L>Echoing from <HI>Oxford</HI>'s Shore each classick Song;</L>
<L>Then weds with <HI>Tame,</HI> and these, O <HI>London,</HI> see</L>
<L>Swelling with naval Pride, the Pride of Thee!</L>
<L>Wide, deep, unsully'd <HI>Thames</HI> meand'ring glides,</L>
<L>And bears thy Wealth on mild majestic Tides.</L>
<L>Thy Ships, with gilded Palaces that vie</L>
<L>In glitt'ring Pomp, strike wond'ring <HI>China</HI>'s Eye;</L>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>And thence returning bear, in splendid State,</L>
<L>To <HI>Britain</HI>'s Merchants <HI>India</HI>'s eastern Freight.</L>
<L><HI>India,</HI> her Treasures from her western Shores,</L>
<L>Due at thy Feet, a willing Tribute pours;</L>
<L>Thy warring Navies distant Nations awe,</L>
<L>And bid the World obey thy righteous Law.</L>
<L>Thus shine thy manly Sons of lib'ral Mind,</L>
<L>Thy <HI>'Change</HI> deep-busied, yet as Courts refin'd;</L>
<L>Councils, like Senates, that enforce Debate</L>
<L>With fluent Eloquence, and Reason's weight;</L>
<L>Whose Patriot Virtue, lawless Pow'r controuls;</L>
<L>Their <HI>British</HI> emulating <HI>Roman</HI> Souls.</L>
<L>Of these the Worthiest still selected stand;</L>
<L>Still lead the Senate, and still save the Land:</L>
<L>Social, not Selfish, here, O <HI>Learning!</HI> trace</L>
<L>Thy Friends, the Lovers of all Human Race!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In a dark Bottom sunk, O <HI>Bristol!</HI> now,</L>
<L>With native Malice, lift thy low'ring Brow!</L>
<L>Then as some Hell-born Sprite, in mortal Guise,</L>
<L>The Shape of Goodness borrows, and belies,</L>
<L>All fair, all smug, to yon proud Hall invite,</L>
<L>To feast all Strangers, ape an Air polite!</L>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>From <HI>Cambria</HI> drain'd, or <HI>England</HI>'s western-Coast,</L>
<L>Not elegant, yet costly Banquets boast!</L>
<L>Revere, or seem the Stranger to revere;</L>
<L>Praise, fawn, profess, be all Things but sincere.</L>
<L>Insidious now, our bosom Secret steal,</L>
<L>And then with sly sarcastic Sneer reveal.</L>
<L>Present, we meet thy sneaking treach'rous Smiles;</L>
<L>The harmless absent still thy Sneer reviles;</L>
<L>Such as in thee all Parts superior find;</L>
<L>The Sneer that marks the Fool and Knave combin'd.</L>
<L>When melting Pity wou'd afford Relief,</L>
<L>The ruthless Sneer, that Insult adds to Grief.</L>
<L>What Friendship can'st thou boast? what Honours claim?</L>
<L>To thee each Stranger owes an injur'd Name.</L>
<L>What Smiles thy Sons must in their Foes excite?</L>
<L>Thy Sons, to whom all Discord is Delight;</L>
<L>From whom eternal mutual Railing flows;</L>
<L>Who, in each others Crimes, their own expose;</L>
<L>Thy Sons, tho' crafty, deaf to Wisdom's Call;</L>
<L>Despising all Men, and despis'd by all;</L>
<L>Sons, while thy Clifts a ditch-like River laves,</L>
<L>Rude as thy Rocks, and muddy as thy Waves;</L>
<L>Of Thoughts as narrow as of Words immense;</L>
<L>As full of Turbulence as void of Sense:</L>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>Thee, Thee what Senatorial Souls adorn?</L>
<L>Thy Natives sure wou'd prove a Senate's Scorn.</L>
<L>Do Strangers deign to serve thee? what their Praise?</L>
<L>Their gen'rous Services thy Murmurs raise.</L>
<L>What Fiend malign, that o'er thy Air presides,</L>
<L>Around from Breast to Breast inherent glides,</L>
<L>And, as he glides, there scatters in a Trice</L>
<L>The lurking Seeds of ev'ry rank Device?</L>
<L>Let foreign Youths to thy Indentures run!</L>
<L>Each, each will prove, thy true-adopted Son,</L>
<L>Proud, pert and dull—tho' brilliant once from Schools,</L>
<L>Will scorn all Learning's, as all Virtue's Rules;</L>
<L>And, tho' by Nature friendly, honest, brave,</L>
<L>Turn a sly, selfish, simp'ring, sharping Knave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Boast petty Courts, where 'stead of fluent Ease,</L>
<L>Of cited Precedents and learned Pleas:</L>
<L>'Stead of sage Council in the dubious Cause,</L>
<L>Attorneys chatter, and burlesque the Laws.</L>
<L>So shameless Quacks, who <HI>Galen</HI>'s Art invade,</L>
<L>Of Jargon and of Poison form a Trade.</L>
<L>So canting Cobblers, while from Tubs they teach,</L>
<L>Buffoon the Gospel they pretend to preach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>Boast petty Courts, whose Quirks new Rigour draw;</L>
<L>Unknown to Nature's and to Statute Law;</L>
<L>Quirks that explain all saving Rights away,</L>
<L>To give th' Attorney and the Catchpole Prey.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s there where Law too rig'rous may descend?</L>
<L>Does Charity her kindly Hand extend?</L>
<L>Thy Chests that shut when Pity wou'd redress,</L>
<L>Spontaneous open to inflict Distress.</L>
<L>Try Misdemeanours!—All thy Wiles employ,</L>
<L>Not to chastise th' Offender, but destroy;</L>
<L>Bid the large lawless Fine his Fate foretell;</L>
<L>Bid it beyond his Crime and Fortune swell,</L>
<L>Cut off from Service due to kindred Blood,</L>
<L>To private Welfare and to publick Good.</L>
<L>Pitied by all, but thee, he sentenc'd lies;</L>
<L>Imprison'd languishes, imprison'd dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Boast swarming Vessels, whose Plebeian State</L>
<L>Owes not to Merchants, but Mechanicks Freight.</L>
<L>Boast nought but peddling Fleets—in War's Alarms</L>
<L>Unknown to Glory, as unknown to Arms.</L>
<L>Boast thy base <HI>Tolsey</HI> and thy turn-spit Dogs;</L>
<L>Thy Holliers Horses, and thy human Hogs:</L>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<L>Upstarts and Muckworms, proud, relentless Hearts</L>
<L>Thou Blank of Sciences! thou Dearth of Arts!</L>
<L>Such Foes as Learning once was doom'd to see,</L>
<L><HI>Huns, Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> were but Types of thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proceed, great <HI>Bristol,</HI> in all-righteous Ways,</L>
<L>And let one Justice heighten yet thy Praise.</L>
<L>Still spare the Catamite, and swinge the Whore,</L>
<L>And be whate'er <HI>Gomorrah</HI> was before.</L>
