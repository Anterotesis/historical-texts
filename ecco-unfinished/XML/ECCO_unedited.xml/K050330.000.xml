<HEAD>REASONS
Concerning the
Immediate Demolishing
OF
DUNKIRK, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THEY who undertake so unpo∣pular
an Argument as this of
the Demolishing of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is,
must be prepared to be very ill
treated by those who are on the other
side; who, besides what Arguments they
think fit to use, are always ready to quar∣rel
with what they may not approve.</P>
<P>Be it known to such, That the Writer
of these Sheets was ever a Protestant,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
and truly jealous for the Protestants a∣gainst
the Popish Interest: He has been
so far from a French Party, that he was
ever against all Parties: And as for the
Pretender, he has willingly and unfeign∣edly
abjur'd him.</P>
<P>Yet he sees many Reasons why he can∣not
agree with the common Opinion of
those whose Judgment he may in other
Things acknowledge to be much better
than his own, in that he cannot think
it safe for the Government of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI>
to go so hastily as the People seem
to desire, and just at this time, about
the Demolishing <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></P>
<P>The Demolishing <HI>Dunkirk</HI> having been
agreed upon in the late Treaty with the
French King, and made a part of the
Peace concluded at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> it is no lon∣ger
a Question, whether the French are
obliged to Demolish it or not, if the
Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> insists upon it;
None will contend this part (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the
French must and ought to perform what is
so agreed; and the Town is put into the
Queens Hand, to assure Her Majesty, on
the part of <HI>France,</HI> that it shall be done
when required.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
There are not the same Reasons, or
the same Obligations upon Her Majesty
to Demolish <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> as there are upon
the French King to do it if Her Majesty
requires it; on the contrary, there are
divers very good Reasons to be given why
Her Majesty may not think it proper to
suffer the said Fortifications to be YET
Demolished.</P>
<P>The Enquiry therefore into the Vali∣dity
of the Treaty, and how far the
French King is oblig'd to Demolish <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI>
if we insist upon it, is not the Case;
but the Question before us is, WHE∣THER,
as <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is now in Her Ma∣jesty's
hand, and was given as a Pledge
or Security to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> for the Per∣formance
of those things stipulated by
<HI>France</HI> on one hand, and to impower the
Queen to do Her Subjects Right in the
<HI>Netherlands,</HI> on the other hand; I say,
whether it consists with common Pru∣dence
to give up this Pledge before that
Safety and Advantage which it was put
into our hands to obtain and secure, be
obtain'd and secured.</P>
<P>To enter fairly into this Argument,
we must enquire, what were the true Mo∣tives
upon which the <HI>British</HI> Court took
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> into Possession? and why Her
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Majesty insisted so steadily upon that Pos∣session
preliminary so much as to any
Engagement of Treating about a Peace?
And perhaps the setting this matter right,
may go a great way to the satisfying
those People who now argue so hotly
on this Point, and to the reconciling them
to the Reasons which shall be aftetwards
given.</P>
<P>It is true that, in the first place, the
Restitution of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was insisted upon
as a Testimony to be given by the <HI>French</HI>
King, that he was truly desirous of Peace;
and sincerely resolved to give Satisfaction
to Her Majesty and Her Allies; and,
That Her Majesty should be Arbitress of
what should or should not be esteem'd
Satisfaction when a Treaty should be so
commenc'd.</P>
<P>If in any thing the <HI>French</HI> King had
not comply'd, if he had refused to grant
any thing which Her Majesty judged es∣sential
to the Safety and Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI>
either which was insisted on by the
Queen, or by Her Allies; <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was
deem'd to be a sufficient Satisfaction to
the Queen, and a sufficient Loss to <HI>France:</HI>
So that leaving <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in Her Majesty's
hands, he was at liberty to Treat or not
to Treat, Conclude or not Conclude, as
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
he thought fit; since the Possession of
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> was a thing so considerable to
us, and in case of carrying on the War,
would have been so fatal to <HI>France,</HI> that
it required but a small Penetration to
know that we had thereby the Key of
<HI>France</HI> on that side put into our hands,
and could, without any difficulty, have
done what (however talk'd of) had been
found so impracticable to bring to pass in
22 Years War, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to have carried
the War into the Heart of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>It should be next enquired, when the
Article of putting <HI>Dunkirk</HI> into Her Ma∣jesty's
hands was in Debate, from who
and from what Foundation came the Ad∣dition
of that Clause, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Fortifi∣cations
to be Demolished? Was it from
the <HI>British,</HI> or from the <HI>French,</HI> or on some
third Interest, that this part was pro∣posed?</P>
<P>No Man will be so weak as not to al∣low,
that if the Town of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with
all its Fortifications, Harbours, Peers,
Rice-bank, Citadel, Bassin, <HI>&amp; c.</HI> could
have been obtain'd, and the Possession
and Soveraignty of them made over to
the Queen, the <HI>British</HI> Ministers would
gladly have accepted it; nor could they
have answer'd it to God and their Queen
if they had not.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
It was not then the <HI>British</HI> Ministers
that demanded the Demolishing of <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI>
the gaining Possession of it, was
their Point; which having obtain'd, they
would never, if in their right Mind, have
offer'd the Demolishing it, if it had not
been insisted on by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>What Interest other Nations, our Al∣lies,
have in this part, and how far they
would be from being easy in the Town
of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>'s remaining in <HI>English</HI> hands un∣demolished,
shall be enquired into after∣wards.</P>
<P>But for the present, this brief Obser∣vation
may be drawn from the Premisses,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) As it could not reasonably be our
part to Article for the Demolishing <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI>
when it was put into our hands; so
neither can it be reasonable, that while
we have it in Possession we should be
more in haste to Demolish it, than other
Nations.</P>
<P>The Case seems very clear, we have
the Town in Possession: If it were never
Demolished, what can the Hurt be on
our fide? The Damage is to <HI>France,</HI> be∣cause
they are deprived of it; and in case
of any future Rupture with us, the Dan∣ger
will be to them: But it is a most
mysterious Suggestion, that the Fortifica∣tions
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> should be dangerous to
us who have them in Possession.</P>
<P>But this Mystery may perhaps be un∣folded
more easily, when the Reason and
Nature of Things comes to be a little far∣ther
enquired into.</P>
<P>It is the Unhappiness of this Nation to
be miserably divided into Parties; which
Parties, have this one Peculiar which per∣haps
distinguishes them from all that ever
went before them, <HI>viz.</HI> That they agree
in nothing: Many Divisions have been
in this Nation and other Nations, and
have been carried on to great heights,
even to Blood and War; but still they
determin'd what they differ'd in, and
what they agreed in.</P>
<P>Thus the late Differences between
Church and Dissenter, however warmly
they differ'd, even to Persecution and Suf∣fering;
yet they agreed to join against Po∣pery.
The late Differences between <HI>Whig</HI>
and <HI>Tory,</HI> Liberty and Arbitrary Power,
ran very high; but they all join'd against
Standing Armies, Dispensing Power, and
the like.</P>
<P>But the People who differ now, seem
to agree in nothing but to Dislike and
Oppose whatever the other Party do, or
espouse, meerly because done and espou∣sed
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
by them, without enquiring into the
Reason and Merit of the Case; as if they
were unwilling the opposite Party to them
should have the Reputation of doing what
is right, any more than the Power of do∣ing
what is wrong.</P>
<P>But this seems to be a Temper fatal to
the Publick Good, for that it is carried
such a Length, that the Parties appear
satisfied their Country should suffer the
want of any Publick Service, rather than
the Party who they oppose should be the
Instruments in bringing it to pass.</P>
<P>This Digression appears necessary in this
Place, as it will be hard to give any other
rational Account; for the several parts of
the Conduct of our People, with relation
to the taking Possession, Keeping, and
Demolishing of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> and the Sinceri∣ty
of the Complainers, must suffer great
Reflection if the Particulars are well en∣quired
into.</P>
<P>When first it was known that <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
was to be deposited into Her Majesty's
hands, the Friends of the Managers of
that Affair began to magnify that Acqui∣sition,
as a great Point gain'd; <HI>That</HI> it
was a Service to the Kingdom, which
could no other way have been brought to
pass; <HI>That</HI> it was a sufficient Pledge that
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
they should be sincerely dealt with by the
<HI>French</HI> King in the ensuing Treaty; and,
<HI>That</HI> it ought to be taken for a Token of
the real Concern the Ministry had for the
Advantage of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and their Ca∣pacity
to shew it.</P>
<P>No sooner was this done, but the other
Party, as if they opposed what was done
because the other had done it; began im∣mediately
to cry it down, to depreciate
the thing it self, and give a wrong Ac∣count
of the Circumstances: They repre∣sented
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> as a thing of no great Con∣sequence;
that as to our having it, it
would cost us more to keep than it was
worth, and would only serve the Mini∣stry
for a Pretence to keep a Standing
Army on foot, and the like. And as to
the King of <HI>France,</HI> it was no such migh∣ty
Loss to him; for, as the Town was
to be restored to him when Demolished,
he could easily restore the Works, and
open the Harbour again: But that the
Truth was, he was a-going to let us see
he did not value it; that he was going to
fortify <HI>Graveling,</HI> and would make it as
Impregnable by Land as <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> and
as to the Harbour, the Engineers had en∣gaged
to make it a better, and to have
two foot Water more in the Port than
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
in that of <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> So that <HI>Graveling</HI>
would be every thing by Sea that <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
was. These things were not the Publick
Discourse of those People only, but were
often printed and published in their seve∣ral
Pamphlets and News-papers, as may
be proved if there were occasion.</P>
<P>Now although this needed no other
Confutation than Matter of Fact, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Impracticableness of the Place (<HI>Grave∣ling</HI>)
to make any such Harbour, and the
reality of this Truth, <HI>viz.</HI> that no such
thing is attempted, or indeed design'd by
the <HI>French;</HI> yet these Reports have been
industriously spread abroad, and kept up,
tho' contradicted by uncontestable Evi∣dence;
it being thought needful to lessen
the Value of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in the Eyes of the
People, and consequently to lessen the
Merit of those who struggled so much to
get it into our hands, and esteem'd it of
so great Advantage to us now it was
obtain'd.</P>
<P>But one would have thought the Te∣stimony
and Credit of the last Age should
have establish'd our Opinion of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
in the present. When it was Sold by
K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. to the present <HI>French</HI> King,
how was the Politicks of that Reign cen∣sured
for it? How is it recorded on seve∣ral
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Accounts, as a Mark of Infamy upon
the whole Court, and a Reproach to the
Nation? What has the Memory of the
Lord Chancellor <HI>Hyde</HI> suffer'd for being
the Adviser of it, though he neither was
guilty of it, nor did he forbear modestly
to oppose it.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was called the Key of
Commerce, a Door into <HI>France,</HI> a Muzzle
or a Ring in the Nose of the <HI>Flemish-Lyon;</HI>
its Value counted Inestimable, and the
Nation betray'd in giving it over to the
<HI>French.</HI> It was admirable to see the Voice
of the Nation so suddenly changed; that
when it was parted with, tho' at a great
Price, it was raised up to such an intole∣rable
Rate, and our Loss esteem'd so Irre∣parable;
and yet the Town was of no great
Strength at that time, and the Harbour
of less Importance than that of <HI>Calais;</HI> as
being capable to receive no Vessels of Bur∣then;
and now, on the other hand, when
it is acknowledged to be the most Important
Place on this Side the World, the Portable
to receive great Fleets, and to fit out Expe∣ditions
to Invade us; the Town it self Im∣pregnable,
and a Terror to all its Neigh∣bours;
yet, on a sudden, the Price is fal∣len
among our States-Men, and it is not
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
worth our taking, tho' we were to have
it, as it were, for Nothing.</P>
<P>This is an unanswerable Evidence of
the Power of our Divisions, and how the
Prejudices that are among us Influence
our Judgments to Argue even against
Light, and against the Conviction of our
own Reason.</P>
<P>We can hardly express how much we
are beholding in this Matter to the <HI>worthy</HI>
Mr. <HI>Steele,</HI> the publisher of the <HI>Guardian,</HI>
No. 128. I will not be so unjust to him as
to call him the Author; who has effectu∣ally
set us right in this Matter, and has
rescued the Town and Harbour of <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI>
from the depreciating Arts of our
Party-Men, who, it was to be fear'd,
would have brought it at last so low, that
we might have been made believe the
King of <HI>France,</HI> if we should offer to give
it him again, would not accept of it.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Guardian</HI> has taken the Cou∣rage
to do Justice to the <HI>Dunkirkers,</HI> and of
Consequence to the Ministry, in securing
such a Place in the Possession of the Queen;
for he has told us expresly, that to take
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> from the <HI>French</HI> is removing
<HI>France</HI> two or three hundred Miles fur∣ther
from us; that they have not any Port
where they can sit out any Fleet till they
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
come to <HI>Brest;</HI> that it is of the last Con∣sequence
to <HI>Britain</HI> that it should no
more be in the <HI>French</HI> Power, that the In∣jury
we have received from them is In∣estimable.
His words follow.</P>
<P>“That when <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is demolished,
the Power of <HI>France,</HI> on that Side,
should it ever be turned against us,
will be removed several hundred Miles
further off of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> than it is
at present. Vide <HI>Guardian,</HI> No. 128.</P>
<P>As this is an undoubted Testimony gi∣ven
to the Zeal of the Ministry, in taking
hold of the present Conjuncture, to get
that Important Fortress into our Hands,
and is the greatest and most just Panegy∣rick
which Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> ever made upon any
great Action in the World, and which,
no doubt, he did in Honour to the Queen,
and the present Government; and that
the said Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> has gained the just Ap∣probation
of all her Majesty's good Sub∣jects
for so doing, so it is a fair Confuta∣tion
of all those weak Things which had
been advanced by a Party among us, in
Prejudice of the late Negociations; but
above all, that it is an unanswerable Argu∣ment
against our too soon parting with,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
or too hastily Demolishing this Important
Place, which is of such Consequence to
the Nation; and I cannot doubt, but
Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> did it that Justice with this
Intent. For it is impossible a Man of
his Penetration, and of his exquisite Po∣liticks,
could Argue for our immediate
putting the Place out of our Possession,
because it was a Place of very great Con∣sequence,
and that the Security of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
depended on it. This will always
be allow'd to be a good Argument with
any true <HI>Britain,</HI> why we should get it
into our Possession, and why we should
keep it now we have it, at least till we
are effectually Secured; but it will be very
hard to make this pass with any reasona∣ble
Man for an Argument, why we should
pull it to pieces, and give it away again
to <HI>France;</HI> and, God be praised, those
who are of that mind have not the Town
in their Possession, nor the Power to de∣stroy
our Security, before the Thing to be
Secur'd by it be actually obtain'd.</P>
<P>Having therefore so good a Testimony
to the Value of the Thing, we shall not
need to say any thing to do Justice to
those Councils who manag'd <HI>France</HI> so, as
to get a Town of that Consequence put
into our Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
But to return to the Parties among us,
and the Designs which we now see mana∣ged
by them, one against another. When
they found that depreciating and run∣ning
down the Value of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> would
do them no Service, that their own Com∣plaints
formerly, when it was first parted
with to the <HI>French,</HI> contradicted it, and
that the real Importance of the Place was
so well known to every one, that it be∣came
ridiculous to attempt the making Peo∣ple
believe otherwise; they took other
Measures.</P>
<P>First, They endeavoured to make it
be believed, that we had not really gotten
Possession of it, that the <HI>French</HI> held the
principal Parts of it, that the Garrison was
restrain'd by the Burghers, that the <HI>French</HI>
could Dispossess them of it when they
pleased; and the like.</P>
<P>This also their <HI>Flying-Post</HI> and other
Libels Published for a certain Truth,
tho' the Fact was quite otherwife from
the beginning. The <HI>English</HI> Troops being
put into an immediate Possession of every
part of the Town, the Cittadel, Rice-Bank,
all the Gates, the two Peers, every Out∣work,
and also of Fort-Louis, at a good
distance from the Town; so that there
was not the least part left in Possession
of the <HI>French,</HI> nor were any <HI>French</HI> Troops
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
left in the Place, except a few Ma∣rines,
who were appointed to guard the
old unrigged Gallies and Men of War
which lay in the Basin, and which could
not be carryed away, and which being
but meer Hulks, it was necessary to keep
a small Guard upon them, to keep the
People of the Town from pulling them
in pieces.</P>
<P>A little Time therefore discovering the
Truth, this Shift would serve no longer,
and so was abandon'd for a quite con∣trary
extream; for, on a sudden, the very
same People who had run down <HI>Dunkirk,</HI>
as good for nothing, or <HI>to use their own
Words,</HI> of no great Consequence, not
worth having, and the like; turn'd their
Tale, and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was now of the utmost
Consequence in the World.</P>
<P>It was with some Impatience, that the
<HI>On-Looking</HI> and Impartial part of Man∣kind
waited to know what they would
infer from this new Opinion, for every
one allow'd they were now in the right;
That <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was of the last Importance,
no Body could question; But what could
they draw from thence?</P>
<P>To say that therefore the Ministry had
acted Wisely in getting so great and so
terrible a Place out of the Hands of so
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
dangerous a Person as the <HI>French</HI> King,
without Blood or Blows, to have it qui∣etly
Surrendered and put into our Hands
as a pledge of Peace; that a Fortress which
had been so fatal to us, was now secured,
whatever might happen, from ever doing
<HI>Britain</HI> any more Mischief; this went
against their Nature, and the very Thoughts
of it made their Party-Blood run cold
within them.</P>
<P>As this therefore could not be expected
from them, so no Man in the World
could ever have believed, that from the
Acknowledgment of its Importance, could
be drawn an Argument for our throwing
it out of our Hands.</P>
<P>If they had said they would have it
Demolished, because the <HI>Dutch</HI> are not
willing we should keep it; because the
<HI>Flemings</HI> are not willing to have us be
so much their Masters; because the Em∣peror
does not care to Trust us with it;
because by it you are able to Establish
the <HI>English</HI> Trade in <HI>Flanders,</HI> whether
the <HI>States-General</HI> approve of it or no.
These are Reasons which have some Force
in them, and which out of the Mouth
of a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> or an <HI>Imperialist,</HI> would
be very Rational. But for <HI>Englishmen</HI> to
Argue thus has something unnatural in
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
it, and looks as if those People had more
regard to the Interest of <HI>Holland,</HI> or the
<HI>Emperor,</HI> than to their own Country.</P>
<P>But so it is; and let there be Reason
in it or no Reason in it, force of Argu∣ment
or no force of Argument, we must
give them leave to make it popular, that
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> must immediately be Demo∣lished,
and given back to the <HI>French;</HI>
because it is of the greatest Importance
to us in the World; which, on the con∣trary,
<HI>we say</HI> is the very Reason why it
should not be Demolished till all those
Things are secured and obtained for
which it was at first put into our Hands.
And whatever the Clamour of these Men
may be, it is still hoped the Government,
whose Business it is not to do what these
People seek, but what it is reasonable
and just they should do for the Publick
Good, will consider well what other
Things, absolutely necessary to be done
for the good of the Nation, ought to be
finished, before <HI>Dunkirk</HI> be Demolished.</P>
<P>And that we may not be amused with
Generals, any more on one Side than
another, it may be very useful to set
down some particular Reasons why <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI>
ought not yet to be Demolished; if
the other People can assign better Rea∣sons
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
why it should be immediately done
the World will easily be convinced; and,
in the mean time, the Nation will have
leisure to Judge on either Side.</P>
<P>Besides what has been said of the Rea∣sons
why <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was Deposited by the
<HI>French</HI> in the Hands of Her Majesty, at
the beginning of the Treaty; it is to be
enquired what other Reasons there were
why Her Majesty insisted on that Surren∣der.
I shall put them all together.</P>
<P>I. The Reasons which respected <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>II. The Reasons which respected <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Putting the Sincerity of the <HI>French</HI>
King, in his Proposals for a Treaty,
out of doubt. A Security against the
<HI>French</HI> King's breaking in upon any of
the Preliminaries before the Treaty was
concluded. A Security for the Perfor∣mance
of the Treaty it self, of which this
was an effectual Preliminary.</P>
<P>These were the Reasons on the <HI>French</HI>
King's part, in general, why he should
Surrender <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the Allies.</P>
<P>But these were not the Reasons why
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> should be Deposited in the Hands
of the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> more than
any other of the Allies: The Reasons for
that were such as these.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
1. That the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
who had given her Opinion, and declared
her Resolution for a Treaty of Peace, and
had signified so much to her Allies, might
be very well assured that the Satisfaction
which her Majesty was resolved to en∣deavour
to procure for her said Allies,
and which <HI>France</HI> had proposed to give;
should be really and <HI>Bona fide</HI> performed
on the part of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>2. That the <HI>British</HI> Commerce which
remained unsettled in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI>
and which the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by reason of the
large extent of their Barrier in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
had the power to interrupt, might not
be so much at the Mercy either of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> or the <HI>Emperor,</HI> as otherwise it
would be.</P>
<P>From a further Examination of these
Particulars, it will appear, that there are
very good and sufficient Reasons why
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> ought not to
Demolish <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> or part with that
Power which is in Her Hands, to do
Herself and Her Subjects Right, as well
in the Matter of Commerce, as of other
Things, till those Things are fully settled
to Her Satisfaction. Let us enquire into
them more particularly.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
The Reason why the Demolishing of
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> was limited to a Time, was on a
Supposition that the Peace would have been
General, and that the <HI>Emperor</HI> should
accept such Conditions as were judged
reasonable by the other Powers then in
Alliance with him. This his Imperial
Majesty has not thought fit to do; but
the War is going on: If, on the one hand,
the Arms of <HI>France</HI> are like to be Victo∣rious,
the Queen has no tye upon the
<HI>French,</HI> to bring them to grant Terms
of Accommodation to <HI>Germany,</HI> and to
restore their Conquest, but the keeping
the Town of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in her Hands;
which the <HI>French</HI> will be very loth to
submit to or suffer; for it is a gross vul∣gar
Mistake, to think that not to Demo∣lish
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> is a favour to <HI>France;</HI> and we
shall soon find the King of <HI>France</HI> insist
upon its being Demolished, since it is out
of his Hand, if he should but imagine
that the <HI>English</HI> Design to keep it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, while the War is
continued between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
it may be possible, tho' not at all proba∣ble,
that the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Arms may be Suc∣cessful:
If such an unlikely Thing should
happen, let any one judge whether it
were proper that her Majesty should be
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
quite shut out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and have no
other Influence on Affairs than what
should be at the good liking of either
Party.</P>
<P>For which Reason, I cannot think any
Man that has the Honour and Interest of
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> at Heart, can desire that
this Important Pledge of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Peace
ought to be put out of Her Majesty's Hand,
till the <HI>Emperor</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King
have decided their Quarrel, and till the
Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> is compleatly Established:
And this is one Reason.</P>
<P>2. The Treaties of Barrier, and other
Engagements between the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and the <HI>States-General,</HI> of which
so much stir has been made and by
which our Trade to <HI>Flanders</HI> is to be set∣tled
and regulated, neither are, nor can
be yet, nor perhaps for some considerable
time made so Effectual, as that we may
be able to say we shall have a fair and
equal Regulation of Commerce in <HI>Flan∣ders.</HI>
The Refractory and Disobliging
Behaviour of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> even while
our Troops have been in Possession of
their Country. The Conduct of the
Council of State there, while the Civil
Government has been provisionally in
the Hands of the Queen, and the <HI>States-General.</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
These all give us Reason to see,
that we have nothing to expect from
them but what we have Power to ob∣tain,
by doing our selves Justice. How
far the <HI>Dutch</HI> will do us Justice in such
part as shall be in their Hands, I will not
undertake to determine beforehand, but
no true <HI>Britain</HI> will contend that we
ought not to leave the <HI>British</HI> Commerce
in <HI>Flanders</HI> at the Mercy either of one or
other: And this is a second Reason why
I think we ought not to divest ourselves
of so great an Advantage as the Possession
of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is, by which we may be al∣ways
in a Condition to do our selves
right, if others refuse it, till we see our
Commerce setled, and the <HI>English</HI> Trade
in <HI>Flanders</HI> regulated upon an equal Foot
with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as it was agreed to be, and
as it is, but just and equal that it should be.</P>
<P>If any one think that this Reason is
not good, I refer them back to the Par∣liament,
who were so sensible of the
Value of our Trade there, and of the un∣equal
Terms we should stand upon, if
we were quite divested of a Footing in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> that they Addressed Her Majesty
not to part with any Thing She was pos∣sessed
of in <HI>Flanders,</HI> till the Trade of
Her Subjects was effectually Secured.
What those People mean, and whose In∣terest
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
they are acting, contrary to that of
their own Country, who are for having
Her Majesty give up and Demolish <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI>
before these Things are settled, and
before sufficient Security for our Trade
is made and obtain'd will easily appear;
nor can they ever Answer the Charge of
referring the Interest of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
the <HI>Emperor,</HI> to that of their own Country.
The Resolution of the Parliament in this
Case, is as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> “That an humble Address be
presented to Her Majesty, That She will
be pleased to take Care, that the Towns in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> in Her Majesty's Possession, be
not evacuated, till those who are to have
the Sovereignty of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI>
agree to such Articles for regulating of
Trade, as may put the Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
upon an equal Foot with those of
any other Nation. <HI>Vide Votes, 22 June,</HI> 1713.”</P>
<P>After such an Authority as this, What
Man can have the Face to say, the BRI∣TISH
NATION EXPECTS <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to
be immediately Demolished? the <HI>House of
Commons</HI> is the Representative of the
BRITISH NATION, and, it is plain,
they expect the contrary, and have Ad∣dressed
Her Majesty to the contrary;
and, I doubt not, but if some Powers
go on as they have begun, and continue
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
to show the little Inclination they have
to do Justice to Her Majesty, or Her
Subjects, the <HI>House of Commons</HI> may come,
in time, to Address Her Majesty not to
suffer <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to be Demolished at all, till
Right be done; at least, they would have
little cause to Thank those who should go
about to Demolish it, till all that we
ought to expect be done, and the Liberty
and Conditions of our Trade in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
sufficiently and effectually Secured to us.</P>
<P>3. The Third Case is this: The Pos∣session
of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> being, as was said, a
Pledge of the Sincerity of the <HI>French</HI> King,
in the Affair of the Treaty, so was it also
a Pledge of the Conditions agreed on by
His most Christian Majesty to Her Majesty
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and for this
Reason, it cannot be EXPECTED, even by
His most Christian Majesty himself, that
Her Majesty should suffer <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to be
Demolished till the Conditions of the said
Treaty, on the part of His said most
Christian Majesty, shall be fully Executed
in all the Parts thereof; particularly the
Treaty of Commerce, <HI>which having met with
some Obstruction here,</HI> has not been brought
into Practice, and cannot be for some
time, at least, not till the Meeting of
the next Parliament. Now, tho' the
<HI>French</HI> King indeed might Complain, and
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
say, that he being ready to execute the
Treaty upon his part, and the delay be∣ing
on the <HI>British</HI> Side only, it was not
reasonable to keep His Town of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
from Him, or to delay the Demolishing
of it upon an occasion which had its
Original wholly in our selves, and might
therefore Demand that it be immediately
Demolished, according to the Treaty;
Yet it is unaccountable how this can be
an Argument on our Side, and that the
People of <HI>Britain</HI> should be impatient to
put out of their own Hand what is their
Security, for the performance of the Terms
of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Trade;</HI> and the unaccounta∣bleness
of this confirms what is before
suggested, <HI>viz.</HI> That these Men are car∣rying
on the Interest, of another People,
not of their own Country.</P>
<P><HI>There is no doubt,</HI> but the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
<HI>Emperor,</HI> the <HI>Flemings,</HI> and all that are in
their Interest, would be glad to have <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI>
out of Her Majesty's Possession;
if it had been in their Choice, it should
never have come into Her Hands; nor
can they be much blamed for it, there
are many Things to be said for it on their
Side.</P>
<P>But what an <HI>Englishman</HI> can say for it,
why he should desire it, especially before
every Thing, for which it is a Security,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
is really Secured, is an unaccountable My∣stery,
and can never be unfolded, but
very much to the Disadvantage of the
People who are concerned in it: What
can a Subject of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> Plead, why
he should be in such great hast to have
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> Demolished? If he has the true
Interest of his Country at his Heart, he
cannot but desire <HI>Great-Britain</HI> should
keep the Hold it has of any Foreign Power,
whereby it may oblige them to do his
Country Justice, <HI>till that Justice is obtain'd.</HI></P>
<P>There is but one Thing left to those
People to Plead, and this, altho' they
will secretly acknowledge that they have
it in their View, yet they care not to
acknowledge they entertain any Thought
so bad in their Hearts, <HI>viz.</HI> That they
suggest <HI>France,</HI> and the present Govern∣ment,
to be so much in one Interest, that
this Important Fortress shall be again put
into the Hands of the King of <HI>France,</HI> or
Subjected to his Interest upon all Occa∣sions,
tho' in prejudice of the <HI>British</HI> In∣terest;
but this is so unnatural a Thing,
I care not to say more of it here; it were
to be wished there were no Cause to have
said so much.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, <HI>the Case is this,</HI> as to
<HI>Dunkirk:</HI> It is our Security for the Per∣formance
of the Articles of <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
It is <HI>Europe</HI>'s Security, that <HI>France</HI> shall
give good Terms of <HI>Peace</HI> to the House
of <HI>Austria,</HI> tho' his Arms should be Vic∣torious</P>
<P>It is the Security of our Commerce in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> which is not yet setled.</P>
<P>And till all these Things are brought to
a Conclusion, it would be most unreasona∣ble
to EXPECT, that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> should be
Demolished.</P>
<P>Whoever he was therefore who put that
Letter into the <HI>GƲARDIAN,</HI> perempto∣rily
telling the Government, that the <HI>Bri∣tish
Nation EXPECTED Dunkirk</HI> should
be <HI>IMMEDIATELY</HI> Demolished, was guil∣ty
of the following Crimes.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Insolence,</HI> and want both of Manners
and Duty to the Queen, in giving such
Language to his Soveraign, on so ill-grounded
an Occasion.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Falshood,</HI> in speaking <HI>that,</HI> in the Name
of the <HI>British-Nation,</HI> which they neither
gave him Authority to do, or which the
Nature of Things made reasonable.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Sedition,</HI> in stirring up the People to
Mutiny and Disaffection, when there has
not been the least occasion of Discontent
given.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Absurdity,</HI> in Arguing for that, which
it is the most reasonable Thing in the
World, that every true <HI>Britain</HI> should Ar∣gue
against and Oppose▪</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30"/>
1. <HI>Insolence, and want of Manners and
Duty to the Queen.</HI> I am sorry to say this
is grown so fashionable a Crime now,
among those who pretend to be most zea∣lous
for the Publick Good, that it is suffi∣cient
to mark a Man out as an Enemy to
that Publick Good, to complain of their
using the Queen Ill; as if the Respect and
Veneration due to the Person of their Sove∣raign,
lessen'd that just Zeal and Fidelity
which an Honest Man bears always in his
Heart for, and to the true Interest of his
Country. What the <HI>GƲARDIAN</HI> has shewn
of this kind, is but a light Excursion, com∣pared
to what is to be found in the general
Conversation of those Men who are so
warm for the Demolishing of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI>
and I Note it here, because it is the very
Argument they use for the more immedi∣ate
Demolishing <HI>Dunkirk, viz.</HI> Their Di∣strust
of the Queen Herself: and I do
them no wrong when I say, that if in
private Conversation you ask them what
makes them so uneasie about <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and
if they dare not trust the Queen with the
keeping it, they will not refrain to Answer
readily and plainly, <HI>No.</HI> That the Con∣cern
Her Majesty has shewen for the Safety
and Welfare of Her People has deserved
better Usage, is known very well, even to
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
these Men themselves; and it cannot be
spoken without great Resentment in the
Minds of all her Majesty's true and faith∣ful
Subjects. But this Use I shall make
of it here, <HI>viz.</HI> That those People merit
much less than the Queen to be trusted
either with the Keeping of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> or
with any other Power in this Nation;
I forbear saying more to it, because
the Business of this Tract is rather to
Convince than Expose them, it is hoped
that when they see <HI>Dunkirk</HI> Demo∣lish'd,
as in its proper time there is no
Reason to doubt it will be, or so conce∣ded
to this Nation, that it shall not be
in the Power even of the Crown it self,
to restore it to <HI>France;</HI> I say, when this
appears, these Men will see great Reason
to blush for their present Conduct, and
to be asham'd as well of their Treating
her Majesty in such an undutiful manner,
as of their pretended Fears of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>'s
being restored to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>2. But this is not all; the <HI>Guardian</HI> is
also guilty of <HI>Falshood,</HI> in speaking what is
really not true in Fact; <HI>viz.</HI> That the
<HI>British Nation</HI> expects <HI>Dunkirk</HI> should be
immediately Demolished. As there can∣not
be a greater Blemish on the Character
of a Gentleman, than not to speak Truth,
for which Reason the giving the LYE to
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
a Gentleman is counted the grossest Af∣front
that can be offer'd; so really no∣thing
ought to be a Gentleman's Care
more than always to speak the Truth,
and not lay his Reputation open even to
the nicest Reprover, as to his Veracity.
That the <HI>Guardian</HI> has not taken this
Care, let the World judge when they read
his said Paper, <HI>Guardian</HI> No. 128. <HI>Aug.</HI> 7.
<HI>The British Nation expects the IMMEDIATE
Demolishing of</HI> Dunkirk; when at the same
time he could not but know, that the
Parliament, the two Houses of Lords and
Commons, which may be more properly
called the <HI>British Nation</HI> than any Body
of People whose Assent could be obtain'd
to that Assertion, and that these did not
EXPECT it: If then I prove that the
Parliament did not Expect it, I hope I
may be allow'd to say, with as much De∣cency
as I can, That what the <HI>Guardian</HI>
has said, is FALSE.</P>
<P>Now that the Parliament did not Ex∣pect
it, appears,</P>
<P>1. By the aforesaid Address to her
Majesty, to keep Possession of what she
held in <HI>Flanders</HI> till the <HI>British</HI> Trade was
settled and secured.</P>
<P>2. By the Parliament granting Mony
to Subsist the Garrison of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to next
<HI>Christmas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>
It cannot be possible that the Parlia∣ment
EXPECTED <HI>Dunkirk</HI> should be
immediately Demolished, and at the same
time gave Mony to pay the Garrison
that was to keep it till <HI>Christmas</HI> next;
that were to make them EXPECT one
thing, and DIRECT another.</P>
<P>What can be more Convincing than
this? And how was it possible the Au∣thor
of the <HI>Guardian</HI> could be guilty of
so wide a Step from the Honour and
Truth which ought to be the denomina∣ting
Quality of a Gentleman?</P>
<P>Can it be pleaded, that the Parliament
is not to be called the <HI>British Nation?</HI>
Let him tell us then, who are the <HI>British
Nation;</HI> and let him tell us, how he as∣sum'd
so much upon Truth and Honour
as to say the <HI>British Nation,</HI> when he
knew he spoke but the Sence of a Party,
that Party but few, and that few Ig∣norant
of the true Reasons why <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI>
was not yet to be Demolished; nay
it is rather to be feared, he gave the De∣nomination
of the <HI>British Nation</HI> to his
own grave Self, and a little Party of a
Party whose Idol he was fond of appear∣ing
to be, and that he is so far from being
able to prove what he asserts, <HI>viz.</HI> that
the <HI>British Nation</HI> expects, <HI>&amp; c.</HI> that he
cannot prove he had any Authority, but
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
from his own Notion, to publish any
thing of that nature in the Names of any
part of the <HI>British Nation.</HI></P>
<P>There has not been so accumulated a
Guilt in any Forgery published in this
Age, by which a Man who was thought
to be a Gentleman, however at this time
he had descended to the Rank of a De∣ceiver,
could ever have Imposed upon a
Nation as he has done; and as he promi∣ses
himself to be a Member of Parliament
in the present Election, it is not doubted
but that Honorable House will do Justice
in the Case when it comes before them.</P>
<P>3. The next Charge upon the Publish∣er
of that Letter in the <HI>Guardian,</HI> is <HI>Se∣dition.</HI>
It is true the Charge is high, and
but one Step short of <HI>Treason;</HI> and ought
to be well grounded before it be laid
home to a Person. I take <HI>Sedition</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
consist, <HI>among other things,</HI> of this; <HI>(viz.)
Spreading groundless and false Suggestions
among the People, knowing those Suggestions
to be false,</HI> with Design <HI>to amuse the said
People, and stir them up to Discontent at the
Government they live under.</HI></P>
<P>That the Suggestion spread by the
<HI>Guardian</HI> was <HI>false</HI> and <HI>groundless,</HI> I think
is made evident, and cannot be deny'd:
How the <HI>Guardian</HI> will come off from
the last part, <HI>viz.</HI> that this was spread
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
abroad among the People, to stir them
up to Murmur at the Goverment because
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> was not immediately Demolish∣ed,
he best knows. The best way that
I know to clear him is, to have him tell
us what other End he could have in it,
and then prove he had such Ends as he
proposes. It is very plain, the Publish∣ing
it was to stir up the People to Cla∣mour
and Discontent; and what else is
the Repetition every Day in the <HI>Flying-Post,</HI>
viz. <HI>Dunkirk is not yet begun to be
Demolished?</HI> Alas! do these Scribblers think
to Bully the Queen and the Ministry in∣to
the doing it before it is proper to do
it? No, they are not so foolish; but they
hope to stir up a Clamour among the Peo∣ple,
and a general Discontent at its not
being done; and this is SEDITION.
Should the Ministry have Weakness e∣nough
to be moved by these Seditious
Clamours, and fall into the Snare of gi∣ving
up the Fortifications of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to
be Demolished, before they had obtained
the Performance of all things for which
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> was a Pledge, these Men would
be the first to fall upon the Ministry for
neglecting the Publick Safety, and for gi∣ving
up the Security before the Things
for which it was a Security are obtain'd.
And this brings in the fourth part of the
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
Charge on the <HI>Guardian</HI> and his Party,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>4. The ABSURDITY of it. And to
argue coolly on that Head, <HI>What can be
more absurd,</HI> than the desiring the Ministry
to quit the Possession of the only thing
which is their Security for the making
good the Treaties of Peace and Com∣merce,
and their Security against Miscon∣structions
in the Executing the said Trea∣ties
on the Part of <HI>France?</HI> Would they
not all say, that this was to have no Treaty
at all, and that it was to put it out of
our Power to oblige the <HI>French</HI> King to
the Performance? And what Treatment
must the Ministers have expected from
the same Men who now make this Com∣plaint,
if they had been so weak to do
thus?</P>
<P>It is said here, by way of Objection,
That the Time for beginning to Demo∣lish
it is stipulated in express Terms in
the Treaty; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“The most Christian King shall take
Care, that all the Fortifications of the
City of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> be razed, that the Har∣bour
be fill'd up, and that the Sluices
or Moles which serve to cleanse the
Harbour be Levelled, and that at the
said King's own Expence, within the
space of five Months after the Condi∣tions
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
of Peace are Concluded and
Signed.”</P>
<P>What can be more against them than
this Allegation? It is evident this is a Sti∣pulation
on the part of <HI>France,</HI> viz. That
he shall not be obliged to begin the Work
sooner; and on the part of the Queen of
<HI>Great-Britain,</HI> That if her Majesty deman∣ded
it, he should be oblig'd to begin it
so soon: But no way obliging the Queen
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that whether all other
Things were done or not, her Majesty
should be bound to let it be Demolished
so soon.</P>
<P>The very nature of the thing is quite
otherwise; If a Security be consign'd over
for the Performance of a Condition, and
any thing happens to delay the Perfor∣mance
of that Condition; if the Security
is not to remain, how shall the Perfor∣mance
of the Condition be ascertain'd to
the Person to whom it was to be done?</P>
<P>Here are Conditions of the Treaty not
made Effectual, the Treaty of Commerce
is delay'd here; the Emperor is not yet
come into the Peace, by which means the
Government and Trade of the late <HI>Spanish</HI>
now <HI>Imperial Netherlands</HI> is not settled, or
the <HI>British</HI> Interest there secured: The
Parliament has been so sensible of the
Danger to <HI>Great Britain</HI> from this Posture
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
of Affairs there, that they have desired
her Majesty to keep more Footing in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> rather than less, till that Mat∣ter
is secured: Can it be thought the Par∣liament
would have been willing <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
should have been thrown up, when they
were willing <HI>Newport</HI> and other Towns
should be possess'd till the Queen had Sa∣tisfaction,
and till our Trade was secured
on that side? What Thanks would any
succeeding Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> have gi∣ven
a Ministry, that when the House of
Commons had desired her Majesty to keep
Possession of what she held in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
should give up <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> which was more
than all the rest, and the keeping of which
was the only way to enable Her to keep
all the rest, and more especially when the
said Parliament had made Provision of
Mony particularly and expresly for the
paying the Expence of keeping <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
till <HI>Christmas</HI> next, if it should be needful.</P>
<P><HI>Is not this as much as if the Parliament
had said to the Queen,</HI> Madam, Since the
Treaty of Commerce has been delay'd, and
must of course come to be debated by another
Parliament; since the Emperor has not thought
fit to come into the Peace, by which means the
Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI> &amp;c. is not yet set∣tled,
and the <HI>British</HI> Commerce there is not
regulated; we desire Your Majesty to keep the
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
Town of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in your Hands, and not Demolish
the same till the Meeting of the next Parliament, and
that it shall be determin'd in Parliament what shall
or may be thought proper to be done with it, whether
Demolished or not, as the situation of Affairs shall
then appear to be; and that Your Majesty may the
better be Enabled to do this, your Loyal and Faith∣ful
Commons have made Provision for the Mainte∣nance
of the Garrison till that time, or till <HI>Christ∣mas,</HI>
which is supposed to be near the time when
another Parliament will assemble.</P>
<P>Let Mr. <HI>Guardian</HI> be the Judge himself, whe∣ther
this be not the true state of the Case, and
whether he has any Wrong done him in expo∣sing
what he has published as the greatest Ab∣surdity
imaginable.</P>
<P>Thus the Proposal of immediately Demolish∣ing
<HI>Dunkirk,</HI> seems to me to be sufficiently pro∣ved,
according to the four Heads above writ∣ten,
to be Unmannerly, False, Seditious, and
Ridiculous.</P>
<P>From what has been said, the Author desires
to draw some Inferences, and defend himself
against some other which the Partiality of Man∣kind
may be pleased to draw from it. I begin
with the latter.</P>
<P>1. It does by no means follow from what has
been said, that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is not to be Demolished
at all.</P>
<P>2. Less yet does it follow from hence, that
it is to be delivered back to the <HI>French</HI> whole
and undismantled.</P>
<P>3. And least of all does it follow, that it is
to be kept in Concert between <HI>Britain</HI> and
<HI>France</HI> for private Designs too ridiculous as well
as too malicious to be nam'd.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="40"/>
These Things had not been mentioned, but
that the People who began the aforesaid Reflecti∣ons
have not been backward, however groundless,
to insist upon them all, and to make use of them
upon sundry Party-occasions, as the several De∣signs
now carrying on require.</P>
<P>It can scarce be admitted within the Limits of
Charity, to suppose that any one should suggest
Things so unnatural of the present Government;
and we cannot wonder that the worst and most
scandalous Things in the World should be charged
upon them, when we see Things so criminal, as
well as so contrary to their Interest, suggested.</P>
<P>It would be hard to assign a Reason why the
Ministry should take a Step so dangerous to them∣selves,
as well as so disgusting to the Generality
of the Nation, as that of giving back <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
to the <HI>French</HI> King undemolish'd: If they are so
much in the <HI>French</HI> Interest as to be willing to
gratify the <HI>French</HI> King in any thing he desires,
which is the Crime their Enemies would willing∣ly
fasten upon them, or at least would have the
People believe; why then had they not made the
Treaty with him without taking <HI>Dunkirk</HI> at all?
If they had been so willing to have oblig'd the
<HI>French</HI> King, that had been the proper time; then
it might have been past over without so much
notice, and they might have accepted of some
Equivalent less to the <HI>French</HI> King's Disadvan∣tage,
and perhaps equally, if not more, satis∣factory
to the other Allies than that of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
Why did they insist upon such a Pledge for the
<HI>French</HI> King's Performance of Conditions? A
Pledge, which it is well known, the <HI>French</HI> did
not part with but with the u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>most Difficulty, and
with the greatest Reluctance imaginable. It had
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
been easy to have gratified the <HI>French</HI> King at
that time, without giving so general a Distaste,
and at least without having it lie as a particular
Charge upon them. If the City of <HI>Lisle</HI> had been
left to the <HI>Dutch</HI> instead of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and as an
Equivalent, it can scarce be doubted but the
<HI>States-General</HI> would have been made full as easy
as at having <HI>Dunkirk</HI> put into the Hands of the
<HI>English;</HI> and no question the <HI>French</HI> King would
have given some Millions to have made the
Exchange: So that if the Design had been to
have given back <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> undisman∣tled,
the Ministry could have gratify'd the <HI>French</HI>
with leaving it in their Hands at first, much bet∣ter
and much more to their own Safety, than they
can restore it again after they have gotten it: Nor
is it rational to think that the <HI>British</HI> Govern∣ment,
who so strenuously and so immovably in∣sisted,
at the time of the Treaty, on the Condi∣tion
of having <HI>Dunkirk</HI> delivered up to them as a
Pledge for the Security of the Performance of
the other part of the Treaty, should now deli∣ver
it back to the <HI>French</HI> Undemolish'd. Can any
one believe that the Memory of its being parted
with to <HI>France</HI> formerly, and the Reproach, <HI>tho'
unjustly too,</HI> which was cast on the Reputation of
the late Lord Chancellor <HI>Hyde</HI> for being instru∣mental
in the Bargain and Sale of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> is
not recent enough in the Memory of our Mini∣stry
to move them to avoid splitting their Cha∣racters
on such a Rock? If the Ministry had no
Regard to the Safety and Honour of their Coun∣try
in the Treaty, why did they steddily insist
upon having <HI>Dunkirk</HI> put into their Hands? And
if they had so much Concern for the Interest and
Honour of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as to refuse all Condi∣tions
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
of a Treaty without that important Point,
why should they be suspected of so much Weak∣ness,
as well as Unfaithfulness to their said Coun∣try,
as to give it back again? The Charge does
not seem to be supported by Reason; besides, it
is very unjust and unfair to suppose such a thing
when the very Suggestion of it is so unnatural and
improbable.</P>
<P>2. As to the Opinion of its being in the De∣sign
of the Ministry not to Demolish it at all; it
does not seem to have any Foundation in the
Reason and Nature of the Thing, unless the
<HI>French</HI> King should not punctually and honora∣bly
perform the Conditions of his Treaty, ac∣cording
to the true Intent and Meaning of the
Treaty; and in such case, no true <HI>Britain,</HI> faith∣ful
to the Interest of his Country, can give his
Consent to the Demolishing <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> In the
mean time, 'tis a marvellous thing that we should
have Men among us, who should desire to have
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> divest her self of the
Power she has now in her Hands to enforce the
Treaty, and to oblige the <HI>French</HI> to perform the
Conditions. To have the <HI>French</HI> King willing
that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> should be first Demolished, and un∣easy
that he is not permitted to go about it;
this would be rational, and what might be ex∣pected:
but, that the <HI>English,</HI> the <HI>British Nation,</HI>
People who pretend to be concern'd for the Ho∣nour
and Interest of their Country; to have
these be uneasy, and in haste to have <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
Demolished, this is really admirable, and the
Occasion of it unaccountable.</P>
<P>3 <HI>dly,</HI> As to keeping it in Concert between <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and <HI>France,</HI> for private Designs: When
those private Designs are rationally suggested,
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
some Reply may be made; but at present it is so
incongruous and weak a Suggestion, that it merits
no Answer at all.</P>
<P>A few Observations then may serve to set us
right in this Matter.</P>
<P>1. There is no reason to doubt, but that
when the Conditions of the Treaty of Peace are
perform'd, our Commerce secured, the Peace of
this part of <HI>Europe</HI> Established, and the Dangers
that we may justly apprehend from the War, yet
depending between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King
at an End, <HI>Dunkirk</HI> will be Demolished; I say, there
is no Cause to fear it, for two Reasons, (1.) Be∣cause
there is no doubt but the <HI>French</HI> King will
insist upon it, and be very ill satisfied if it is
not done. (2.) Because Her Majesty being a
Just, a Righteous, and a Christian Queen, and ha∣ving
Capitulated with the <HI>French</HI> to suffer it to
be done, it cannot without great Indecency be
suggested, that those Capitulations shall not be
performed. If no just Reasons drawn from the
Non-performance of Articles on the other Side,
shall occur to make it just and reasonable not to
do it.</P>
<P>2. If such reasonable Obstructions should hap∣pen,
as should make it necessary to keep the
Pledge, as a farther Security, of which also the
Parliament may be Judges, it would be very un∣accountable
to suggest, especially by a Subject of
<HI>Britain,</HI> that it should not be safe in our OWN
<HI>Hands;</HI> and indeed, this makes the Complaint
appear so wonderful among us, <HI>viz.</HI> That it should
not be safe for Her Majesty to keep <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in
Her OWN <HI>Hands;</HI> and, it is to be fear'd, those
that think so, do not think it safe for the Queen
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
to keep the Crown in Her own Hands; they
would do well to speak plain, and tell us.</P>
<P><HI>1st.</HI> Would they have it Demolished before the
Conditions, for which it is a Security, are per∣form'd?</P>
<P>2 <HI>dly.</HI> Whose Hand would they think it safe to
have it kept by in the mean time, if not in our
own Hands; and why not in our Hands, to
whom the said Conditions are to be perform'd?</P>
<P>But let us come to the main Point, and suppose
it were never to be Demolished at all, and so
advantagious an Article had been obtain'd, that
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> should have been Mistress of one of
the best Ports made by Art, and the strongest
Fortresses in the World; Had this been our Loss
or our inestimable Advantage? Sure the like Ar∣gument
to this was never used, in any Case of this
Nature, in the Memory of Man, or beyond it;
that the most impregnable Fortification of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI>
the most advantagious Port of the whole
Western part of the World, the Curb of <HI>France,</HI>
the Bridle of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> the Terror of the <HI>Hol∣lander,</HI>
and that has been the Plague of <HI>Great-Bri∣tain,</HI>
should be put into our OWN Hands, and
we should be afraid to keep it.</P>
<P>Were it possible to bring the <HI>French</HI> King to
consent that the Queen should keep Possession of
the Town of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with all its Fortifications.
What Minister of State could Answer it to his
Country, or his Honour, to refuse or neglect se∣curing
such a Thing to the Nation? And what
<HI>Englishman,</HI> or what Subject, faithful to the Inte∣rest
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but would rejoyce to see such
an addition of Strength made to the <HI>British</HI> Empire?
But an unhappy Spirit now reigning among us, runs
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
up Things to such a highth of Dissention, that we
are made afraid of our selves; afraid that those
who are Intrusted by Heaven with the Crown it
self, should be Intrusted by us with the keeping of
<HI>Dunkirk,</HI> nay, with the keeping it till we can be
safe in Surrendering and Demolishing it: A little
Time will fully expose the Folly of this Notion,
and let us see not the Necessity of keeping it a
while only, but the Infinite Glory and Advantage
it would bring to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> if once more the
Important Town of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> could be united to
the <HI>British</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>One of the weak and absurd Objections against
it, and which it is wonderful wise Men are not
asham'd to mention, is the Charge of keeping
it; as if the Importance of the Place was not
infinitely greater than the Expence of maintaining
it can be; and this is still more foolish, because it
is well known the Customs of the Harbour of
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> will always be sufficient to pay the Gar∣rison,
and all the Expence of the Fortifications,
and much more; but if it were not so, the Argu∣ment
is of no Force at all.</P>
<P>3 <HI>dly.</HI> That it will be a pretence for keeping up
a standing Force: This is equally absurd with the
former, because the Garrison of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> being li∣mited
to a certain Number of Men, just as many
as are sufficient to its necessary Defence, it will
always be necessary to keep them there, since a
full Garrison, such as in Case of a Siege would be
needful, might not be needful to be always there,
the Sea being at our Command, and we always
ready to supply the Place from <HI>England</HI> out of
the standing Forces which are allowed; or a
certain Number of those Established Forces might
be always added to the usual Garrison, which
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
indeed would always make our Establishment less,
rather than more.</P>
<P>The present Ministry have shew'd so little In∣clination
to Govern by a standing Army, and, on
the contrary, have given such an undisputed Tes∣timony
to prove that they are Enemies to a stand∣ing
Army, that it is not without the greatest
Injustice, that such a Thought of them can be
entertain'd, seeing they have appointed the Esta∣blishment
of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to be Two thousand
Men less than was appointed after the Peace of
<HI>Ryswick.</HI></P>
<P>I see no Argument of any Force remaining,
to urge the speedy Demolishing of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> or
the Demolishing it all, if it could be preserved in
our own Possession; our dear bought Experience
might have admonished us in such a Case, since
we so hastily dismantled <HI>Tangier,</HI> which was an
infinite Detriment and Disadvantage to us, during
the last War, especially till <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> by an un∣expected
and unforeseen Casualty, fell into our
Hands; and it is wonderful, our People who are
so willing to have <HI>Dunkirk</HI> out of our Hands,
should not have the same Passion to discharge us
of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> and <HI>Port-Mahon,</HI> the Arguments be∣ing
much the same, as to Expence of keeping
and standing Forces; but we hope, in a short
while, we shall see our own Interest more clearly;
and if ever a War should be renew'd in this part
of the World, and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> should be ours, we
should be presently convinced of the Consequence
of it.</P>
<P>In a word, the Case is this: If we must be
forced to Demolish <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> we must do it be∣cause
we are engaged to do it, after all Conditions
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
of Peace and Commerce are performed and se∣cured;
but if it could be obtain'd to <HI>Great-Bri∣tain,</HI>
to keep it as our own, it would be an inex∣pressible
Honour and Advantage to the whole
Kingdom: The Particulars of what Advantage
it would be, are reserved for a larger Descrip∣tion.</P>
