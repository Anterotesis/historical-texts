<HEAD>THE
QUARREL
OF THE
School-Boys
AT
ATHENS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Days of the
ancient Philosophers,
when People acted by
the Light of Nature;
and when Reason was
the Guide of Politici∣ans,
as State Maxims are now, a
Grave Instructor of others told the
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
following Story for the Ends and
Purposes, for which it was proper to
be made Use of.</P>
<P>There was, said he, in <HI>Peleponessus,</HI>
a certain <HI>Grecian</HI> Schoolmaster, who
taught Philosophy to his Scholars
in his own City, and with very
great Success and Reputation; He
was a Person of great Excellency in
himself, famed for his Wisdom and
for his Experience, and especially for
his Dextcrity in the Government of
his School, and for his exquisite
Skill in the Instructing his Scho∣lars;
and as this had gain'd him
great Applause in the Country
where he dwelt, so it had made his
Name very much talk'd of, and
respected in other Parts of the
World; He had a very great School
in his own Country, which he had
enjoyed for many Years, and of
which his Father had been School∣master
before him; indeed his Father
was a very good Schoolmaster in
his Time, but was so outshin'd by
the Excellencies of his Son, that the
World seem'd to remember him, <HI>as
it were,</HI> only for the Honour he had
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
to introduce so extraordinary a
Person, <HI>as his Son was,</HI> into the
World.</P>
<P>In Process of Time, <HI>Fate,</HI> who
singles out Men from their Birth,
determining them for great Things
first, and then finishing them for
the great Works they are determin'd
to do: I say, <HI>Fate</HI> and the Decrees
<HI>of the Immortal Gods,</HI> which nothing
can withstand, had handed on the
Fame of this great Instructor, to a
Neighbouring Commonwealth, and
had so effectually recommended his
Person, his Endowments, and par∣ticularly
that of his being so ex∣ceedingly
qualified for the Govern∣ment
of Youth, more than other
Men; That upon the Vacancy of
the greatest and most famous School
in those Parts of the World, he was
by the unanimous Suffrage of the
Senate and People of that Coun∣try,
first nominated to that Post;
which, to be short, in Process of
Time, he was afterwards call'd to,
and went over the Sea, (for it was
on the other Side of the Gulph,) to
take Possession of; where he was
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
received with the joyful Acclamation
of the People of the Country.</P>
<P>It was true, and perhaps was
one Reason of the exceeding Joy of
the People on his Arrival, I say, <HI>it
was true,</HI> that after he was thus no∣minated
to this School, and before
the Schoolmaster's Place became
vacant, his Interest was opposed by
some of the idlest, and most ignorant
of the Scholars, who were appre∣hensive
of being kept under a strict∣er
Discipline, than they had been
used to in the former Time; and
who loving their Vices, and especi∣ally
Indulging their Neglect of Lear∣ning,
were loth to submit to such a
regular Government of the School,
as they expected from him; These
laid several Plots, got together into
Parties, and form'd several Designs,
to have prevented the new School∣master's
taking Possession of the
School; nay, so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar had they carri∣ed
on their Projects, that, after his
Coming, they offered great Distur∣bance
to him, insomuch, that con∣trary
to his inclination, which was
to have taught them Obedience by
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Precepts and Perswasions, rather
than by Coertion and Discipline;
he was obliged to take the Rod and
the Ferula in his Hand, almost as-soon
as he came into the School;
and first, whereas at his very En∣trance,
he found some Dunces and
illiterate Youths, and who, he
thought, were placed too high in
the School, beyond the Proficiency
they had arriv'd to; These he be∣gan
with, and immediately displac∣ing
them, caused them to go back
to the lower Classes, from whence
they had been too hastily raised by
the Favour, rather than Judgment,
of the former Pedagogues.</P>
<P>This bred some bad Blood in the
School, and some of them took it
so ill, that they left the School up∣on
it, and raised Reproaches and
Slanders against the good Govern∣ment
of the Schoolmaster, which
made him indeed a great many Ene∣mies
in that Country: Others of
them behav'd so ill in the Classes
to which they were removed, that
there was no bearing them, and he
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
was oblig'd to cause them to be
expell'd the School.</P>
<P>But as these Things are Matter
of History, and would carry us too
far back into the Conduct of these
Youths, in the Time of the former
Schoolmasters, Things which do
not relate much to the present De∣sign,
they are therefore omitted, to
proceed with the Story.</P>
<P>The Schoolmaster having with an
inimitable Dexterity managed the
turbulent Spirits of these Youths;
and having purg'd the School, so
that all the higher Classes, upon
which depended the good Order of
the whole, were fill'd with VERY
GOOD BOYS; and having esta∣blish'd
such Rules of Government
and Discipline in the School, as he
thought might be most effectual to
preserve the Peace of the School,
he made his Only Son USHER of
the School; and taking Boat, went
over the Gulph into his Native
Country, to visit and set in Order
the School he had lest there.</P>
<P>His Son was a Person of some
Proficiency in Learning, but he was
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Young, and not so fully experienc'd,
as his Father was, in the Art of go∣verning
a School of such a Magni∣tude;
and especially where the up∣per
Youths had been so long out of
Government, and so accustom'd to an
ill Habit of self-Management; How∣ever,
the old <HI>Preceptor</HI> believing that
in Duty to him, and to preserve the
Oeconomy of the School, and above
all, from the Love which the said
Scholars of the Upper Classes profess'd
for his Son, he might be easie, and
need not question, but they would
keep the School in very good Order,
and that the Son would have the
Reputation of having managed well
in the Absence of his Father.</P>
<P>Indeed the People without Doors,
said the old Schoolmaster was not at
all in the wrong, to trust the elder
Scholars as Assistants to the <HI>ƲSHER,</HI>
in the good Government of the School;
for that their Wisdom and Prudence,
their Vigilance and good Manage∣ment
in that Affair, would exceeding∣ly
recommend them, not to their Head
Schoolmaster only at his Return, but
to all the Families in the Country,
(in the mean time,) whose Children
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
being entrusted to their Discipline, in
the lower Classes of the School, had
a very just Concern in the Peace and
good Administration of Things
during the Absence of the Head
Schoolmaster.</P>
<P>But <HI>alas!</HI> all these good Measures
and wise Dispositions were not able
to preserve the Peace and Government
of the School; For no sooner was
the old Gentleman's Back turn'd, but
the School became a Scene of Confu∣sion
and Disorder; not that the Con∣duct
of the <HI>ƲSHER</HI> can be reflect∣ed
on, who did his best, according to
the utmost of his Skill and Capacity,
to have preserv'd the Harmony and
good Understaning of the Senior
Boys. But <HI>alas!</HI> they despised his
Youth, and his want of Authority to
punish them; they also said some very
ill-natured Things of him, with Re∣spect
to his Judgment, in teaching
and instructing the Boys; Tho' this
was very disobliging, and the <HI>ƲSH∣ER</HI>
was not quite destitute of good
Intelligence in the Case, yet he con∣cealed
his Resentment for the present,
and from time to time laid it all be∣fore
his Father, resolving to receive
all his Instructions from his own Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
It must be observ'd here; for Ju∣stice
must be done as we go along,
that we do not find any of the Dis∣orders,
of which we are now giving
an Account, proceeded from Dislike
of the Government of the School∣master,
Disrespect to his Person, or
Disgust at his Way of Teaching; nor
were there any of these Boys con∣cern'd
in it at first, who had been
concern'd in opposing his coming to
take Possession of the School, after he
had been nominated to it as above;
for all those had, as has been noted,
either run away for Fear of being
whipp'd, or been expell'd the School
at first, or were at least mix'd so up
and down among the lower Classes of
the School, as that they had no Inte∣rest
in these things, and were scarce
known among the rest.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Youths of
whom we are now to speak, were
chiefly of those, who having testified
their Affection to their new Master,
even before his Coming; and run the
Risque of being ill treated for their
Fidelity, during the late disorderly
Government of the School, had been
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
now placed at the Head of the several
Classes, as the Reward of their for∣mer
good Conduct; nay, some of
them had really been expell'd the
School on that Account; a Treat∣ment
which signifies the highest Dis∣satisfaction
and Displeasure of the
Schoolmaster, and is a Disgrace which,
to <HI>a good Boy,</HI> is much more mortify∣ing
and afflicting, than the ordinary
Correction of the School.</P>
<P>To descend a little to Particulars:
One of these was Captain of the Ma∣thematical
Form or Class. History has
not recorded his Name, nor indeed
the Names of any of the Scholars;
neither in Things done so many Ages
ago, and in so remote a Part of the
World, would those Names be of any
Signification to us at this Time; we
shall therefore content our selves with
such Descriptions of their several Cha∣racters,
and Stations in the School, as
the Relation we have met with fur∣nishes
us with; from whence we shall
gather enough to distinguish the Per∣sons;
so that the Reader may know
any of them, as they meet with their
Characters in the telling the Story,
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
and so as may let us far enough into
the several Circumstances of their fu∣ture
Conduct on this Occasion.</P>
<P>One of these Scholars, as is said,
was Captain of the Mathematical
Form or Class, which being the first
in the whole School, he was by Con∣sequence
call'd <HI>Captain General</HI> of all
the Boys: He was of an antient Race
among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> a sprightly, vigo∣rous
Youth, of wonderful Vivacity
and Spirit; he had a Genius for great
things, and his peculiar Study was in
those Parts of the Mathematicks, which
relate to <HI>the Art of War;</HI> such as
<HI>fortifying of Towns, encamping of Ar∣mies,
and Managing great Enterprizes;</HI>
he had obtain'd such a great Chara∣cter
in his Studies, that it was thought
he was fit to have led on the greatest
Armies; he had <HI>a cool Head,</HI> and <HI>a
warm Heart;</HI> and in a Word, as he
delighted in great Actions, so he dis∣charged
himself in the greatest Affairs
of the School with such Dexterity,
that he kept all the tumultuous, cla∣mouring
Classes that were under him
in great Awe: He was no less a Po∣litician,
than a Youth of Action; for
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
he had made himself Master of all the
Affairs of <HI>Greece;</HI> he knew the separate
Interests of all the Princes, Cities,
and Commonwealths of <HI>Greece,</HI> as
well as if he had been bred among
them; and in a Word, by these con∣curring
Excellencies in his Capacity,
he had with great Applause been en∣tertain'd
by the new Schoolmaster,
not as an inferiour, and a Pupil, or
Scholar, but rather as a Friend, an
Intimate or Confident, and one on
whose Counsel and Fidelity the Master
might depend in Matters of the great∣est
Consequence: Nor was this Con∣fidence
due to his distinguishing Merit
only; (I mean, as to his Capacity for
Council) but it was in some Measure
due also to the Merit of his past Suf∣ferings;
for he had been furiously
chastis'd by the former Schoolmasters
and Ushers, and had been persecuted
by the incessant Malice of the other
Heads of the Classes, to that Degree,
that they not only expell'd him from
the School, but even oblig'd him to
fly out of his native City; and all this
ill Usage befel him principally, because
he very early declar'd himself for the
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
new Schoolmaster, even from his first
Nomination, and continued immove∣able
to his Interest to the last.</P>
<P>Next to him, was a Youth of <HI>Nor∣thern</HI>
Extract, of an ancient <HI>Gothick</HI>
Race, who coming from among the
<HI>Barbarians,</HI> had pretended to be ci∣viliz'd
in the School of Wisdom a∣mong
the <HI>Greeks:</HI> He was of a fiery
Disposition, and a most impetuous
Courage, <HI>as is the known Character of
those Nations;</HI> but wanted Temper to
manage that Spirit, which would have
otherwise been an Ornament to him:
He was ambitious and avaritious, but
managed both with more Policy than
he did his Passion: He had long en∣vy'd
the Captain of the Mathematick
Class, and aspired to be <HI>Captain Gene∣ral</HI>
of all the School; nay, in a Word,
he had upon many Occasions given
to understand, that nothing less would
content him: As this was his Design,
so till he might bring it to pass, he
shew'd an Impatience of being under
Command, and valued himself so high,
as to treat those who were plac'd a∣bove
him, with the utmost Contempt:
This had caused several Breaches be∣tween
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
him and the Captains of the
Classes, that were above him, especi∣ally
in the time of the former School∣masters,
some of which were never re∣conciled
at all: He had an insinuating
Art in his Conversation, and had be∣hav'd
very well in the Case mention'd
before, <HI>viz.</HI> of preserving the Interest
of the Master of the School, in the In∣terval
between his Nomination and
Accession; and for this, as in Point of
Gratitude, was very well accepted
when the Master came to the School;
after this, being of a sprightly Temper,
and addicted much to his Pleasures, he
lived very gay and courtly, and with an
uncommon Art, got himself particu∣larly
into the Favour of the <HI>ƲSHER,</HI>
by whose Support he kept himself very
well also with the Schoolmaster for a
great while.</P>
<P>To allay the good Qualifications he
was Master of, he had some dark
Ways with him, which very much
exposed him; for he very early
drank in wicked Principles, and gave
himself over to all manner of Vice;
in a Word, he was lewd enough to
have debauch'd the whole School; nor
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
had he any Government of himself in
these Follies; but being bold and
forward, and, as is said, of a fiery Dis∣position,
he made himself a Leader in
Vice, and expected to be followed:
The Schoolmaster, who was a Lover
of Honour, and an Encourager of
Virtue, was soon tir'd of this Youth,
even in Spight of the Inclinations he
had to be kind to him; and having
employ'd him in a Matter of great
Consequence, in which, though he
came off well at last, yet he had al∣most
ruin'd the Business, and himself
too, by his Rashness; I say, having
acted thus, the Schoolmaster, who
was a true Judge of Merit, let him
know, that he forgave him his Want
of Conduct, for the Sake of the Sin∣cerity
of his Intention; but made him
sensible, that he had not acted so as
to deserve abundance of Commenda∣tion.
From this Time also the School∣master,
who, I say, was a perfect
Judge of Merit, abated something of
the Complacency he had formerly
shewn him; but he, hot, and ambi∣tious,
and impatient of Abatement
of Favour, shew'd himself uneasy e∣nough,
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
and afterwards, on a nice Oc∣casion,
acted a very sly and subtil
Part, which gave the Master such
Distast, that he expell'd him the
School, and so got rid of him at once.
It was thought by some, that the
<HI>Ʋsher</HI> would have kept him in, as to
that Part of his Scituation in the
School, which HE was concern'd
with him in; but he shew'd too much
Judgment, as well as Duty, for that;
and resolving not to countenance any
Boy in the School, who his Father
appeared dissatisfied with, he parted
with him also; and thus he was re∣duced
to his former independent State,
where we shall have but little Occa∣sion
to speak of him again; for his
being out of Place made him very un∣capable,
though not the less willing,
to frame a Party in the ensuing Di∣visions.</P>
<P>The
Schoolmaster had yet a third
Favourite among his Scholars, of
whom it is needful to speak some∣thing:
He was a Native of the Coun∣try,
and one the Schoolmaster had
heard much of, though he had no
Knowledge of him, as he had of the
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
other two before he came over; he
was not equal to the other two in
Birth and Dignity of Family, but su∣periour
to many in his Capacities; he
had signalized himself by his extraor∣dinary
Conduct, and early appearing
in the Interest of the present School∣master,
as much as any Boy in the
School; also in the Case of some Pri∣vileges
of the School, which were in∣vaded
during the Government of for∣mer
Schoolmasters and Ushers; he had
appeared very boldly, and indeed had
been ill used by them for it; for they
had him soundly whipp'd, put into
<HI>Dunce</HI>'s Hole, and at last expell'd the
School; in a Word, they put all the
Indignity possible upon him, in Hopes
to have made him fly his Country,
as well as the School; but as one of
his Antagonists, a Boy of Craft and
Subtilty, said of him, <HI>that he had a
most audacious Courage;</HI> so indeed he
stood stoutly up to them, and never
flinched; nay, when he was turned
out of the School, he came up to the
very School Door, and insulted them
all; and thus he continued to behave
to the last, till the Vacancy came,
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
and the new Schoolmaster took Pos∣session,
and then it was his Turn;
for as the new Schoolmaster em∣braced
him with a great deal of Af∣fection,
so he gave him the Power to
enquire into, and expose the Conduct
of those, who had opposed his Interest
before his Coming; and he, on the
other Hand, made Use of it; for he
spared none of them, but pushed at
them with all that Vigour and Fury,
which was natural to his Temper; and
'twas thought many of them fled a∣way,
rather because they thought he
was implacable, than that the Master
was so: It was said of the other go∣verning
Boys, which used this honest
Boy so cruelly, that they were but sorry
Politicians, even in that Particular;
or that it was a Sign they knew little
of the Temper of this Boy, to deal
that Way with him; for had they
known him perfectly, how fierce, how
terrible, and how implacable his Spirit,
they would not have exasperated him;
because they could not but know, that
he was one of those, who would pay
them Home for it, if ever they came
into his Power.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
The Schoolmaster did not make
him Captain of one of the ordina∣ry
Classes, which some think had
been a more suitable Station for one
of his Temper, but made him Head
of those selected Boys, who he em∣ployed
for the greatest Trust, <HI>viz.</HI>
to keep, receive, and direct the com∣mon
Cash of the School, as well the
ordinary Salary or Revenue of the
Teachers, Usher, and Master, as the
extraordinary Money for the Incidents
of the School-Government: In this
Employ he was very faithful, as to
the Money; but as this Post furnished
him with extraordinary Power and
Influence over the rest of the Scholars,
so it raised him many Enemies, even
in the very School; and particularly
the <HI>Captain General,</HI> and the <HI>Gothick
Captain,</HI> and all that stuck to them,
began to change their Countenances
to him: Without Doors also there
were Complaints and Insinuations made
of him, <HI>viz.</HI> that being of an enter∣prizing
Temper, he began to make
Excursions out of his Post, and to
top upon, encroach, and invade the
Office of the rest of those favourite
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Boys, who the Master had entrusted
with the Affairs of the School; nay,
they said, he could scarce refrain from
jostling with the USHER himself,
though he was the only Son of the
Schoolmaster: It is true, that this
Boy was innocent of most of the
Charge; but his Enemies raising first
the Report against him, left him to
clear himself as well as he could, not
doubting but some Dirt would stick,
though some might fall off.</P>
<P>This forward Youth had the good
Fortune to have a Brother in Law,
who, though of another Class, was
yet a great Assistant to him; and that
especially, as he frequently moderated
the Warmth of his Temper, and as∣sisted
him to consider Things more
sedately than he would otherwise
have done; he was of a better Family,
and of a h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gher Rank than the other,
though a Degree lower in his Station
in the School, being one of the chief
Clerks of the School: He was a Youth
of admirable Integrity, had great and
just Ideas of things, and a most clear
and penetrating Judgment; he was a
steddy Friend to the Master, and had
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
always espoused his Interest in the
Time of the greatest Opposition to it,
and was deservedly therefore placed in
a Post of as great Trust as any in the
School; for the Clerks are those, thro'
whose Hands most of the secular Bu∣siness
of the School passes, and are
most necessary to the Master, to take
off the Hurry of ordinary Matters from
his Mind, that nothing may divert
him from the great Affair of instruct∣ing
his Scholars in Justice, Virtue, and
the Worship of the Gods.</P>
<P>There were some other flourishing
Scholars in this famous School, who
had different Studies, and who were
encouraged and advanced in their
Proportion by the Master, <HI>viz.</HI> some
to the Study of the Laws of their
Country, out of whom the Princes of
those Days usually chose their Chan∣cellors,
Advocates, Counsellors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and some to the sacred Offi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of
Priests of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> But of there Hi∣story
has left little or no Remembrance,
except this, that at the coming of
the new Schoolmaster, he sound a ve∣ry
scandalous, unhappy Wreten, Cap∣tain
of this Form; a Boy he was,
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
whose principal Merit lay in those
Things which wise Men reject, and
who was advanced to be Captain of
that Class, rather because he had ser∣vile,
base Principles, which would pro∣stitute
him to any Drudgery that was
imposed upon him, than for any Re∣spect
those who placed him there
really entertained for him; as he was
brought in with a Design to have him
betray the School, and overthrow the
Interest of the present Schoolmaster,
so he failed not to run any Lengths
which were required; for he was a
Boy that always loved Wickedness, nor
did he stop at any Mischief that was
ever proposed to him: He had arrived
to the Degree he was in, by meer
Eff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontry and Strength of Forehead;
for he was a most prof<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gate Youth
in his Person, a Contemner of Virtue,
and a Lover of those who destroyed
the Temples of the Gods; he had
been expell'd his Father's House for de∣filing
a devoted Virgin, and had been
always esteemed a Leader of the Sedi∣tious,
and an Enemy to his Country.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
This young Man was justly ex∣pell'd
the School; but whether it was
the Clemency of the Schoolmaster, or
that his Time was not yet come,
when the Shame which, no doubt,
the just Fates have reserved for his Im∣piety
shall be brought upon him; I
say, whether of these were the Cause
that he was not then put into the
Hands of Justice, History is altogether
silent about.</P>
<P>Having expelled this wicked Boy
from the School, the Schoolmaster re∣stored
a Youth, who formerly had
been Captain of that Class; but was
put out, as above, to make Room for
one, who would prostitute himself
in a Manner, which it was known the
other would abhor, and do the Drud∣gery,
as above, which the other would
not; this Youth had, 'tis true, in his
first setting out, deviated in some
Things from the Rules of Virtue and
Honour; but was since reformed, and
became a Patron of Virtue in others;
whether he was eminent in the Pra∣ctice
of it himself or not, is not to the
present Purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Having thus given the Character of
some of the Head Boys of the School,
it remains that we go on with the
Story. The Master being thus gone
Abroad, and the Conduct of the School
being left too much in the Power of
these three or four upper Boys, it
was not long, but not only all the
Harmony and Affection, good Under∣standing
and Unanimity, which at
the Departure of their Master appeared
among them, was lost; but they, <HI>as
Boys will,</HI> and as indeed <HI>none but Boys
would,</HI> fell all to wrangling, quarrel∣ling,
and disputing with one ano∣ther,
till the Concern for the publick
Good of the School, which was their
Duty, and ought to have been their
disinterested Care, was quite forgot,
or turned almost wholly to the form∣ing
of Parties and Interests to supplant
and to undermine one another, to
the great endangering the Peace of
the <HI>School,</HI> perplexing the good Hu∣mour'd
USHER; and, in a Word,
to the putting the inserior <HI>Scholars</HI> and
<HI>Classes</HI> into the utmost Confusion; a
brief Account of some Part of these
Things, take as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
The warlike Youth we mentioned
first, had always the superior Inte∣rest
in the Master's Affection; and the
greatest Trust of his whole Concern
was, next to the <HI>ƲSHER,</HI> reposed
in him; but it fell out at that Time,
the poor Young Man was taken with
a violent Distemper, which threatned
his Life, and indeed brought him so
low, that he was given over by the
Physicians; this Distemper was not
only dangerous, but tedious and lin∣gring,
and had several Relapses and
Returns, so that it held him a
long Time, which was a great Blow
to his Interest; for not his Enemies
only, but even his own Friends, began
to fear he would never recover.</P>
<P>Though it's true, the Seeds of Jea∣sousy
and Misunderstanding had been
sown a good while among these
Youths, yet it never so openly shew'd
it self as upon this Occasion, almost
all the other Leaders of the Boys
forming, and now professing to be
embark'd in Designs to get into his
Place, as well in the Favour of the
Prince, as in the Advantages he made
of, and Power he had in his Class.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
It happened well for the <HI>Captain Ge∣neral,</HI>
(<HI>as you know he was call'd</HI>) that
three of the best Friends he had in the
School, and who were always fast to
his Interest, went Abroad with, or
soon after to the Schoolmaster; so
that having three such powerful
Friends with the Master, no one
could offer the least Slur upon his
Conduct or Character, but it was im∣mediately
taken up, and such good
Offices done with the Master in his
Behalf, as always preserv'd his Interest
flourishing and invulnerable.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Rivals to
his Power were far from being idle;
but as, by Reason of his Illness, the
whole Management of the School, at
least under the USHER, devolv'd
upon them, or upon other Boys in
their Interest; so they had Occasion in
all their Dispatches to the School∣master,
to lay before him their secret
Objections against those who acted
under the <HI>Captain General,</HI> not forget∣ting
to lay such Foundations for them∣selves
as they found necessary, in Case
of his Decease, which indeed not they
only, but every one in the School,
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
thought inevitable. It is not said,
whether the first and chiefest Con∣tention
began upon the aspiring to
his Place, as Captain of the Mathe∣matick
Class, or as he was the first
Person in, and principal Possessor,
next to the <HI>Ʋsher,</HI> of the Favour
and Affection of the Schoolmaster;
the latter seem'd most probable, tho'
we may suppose it to be both; for we
seldom see such Things terminated in
the Compass of one Point.</P>
<P>Supposing it therefore to be both,
this reduced the main Strife to lye be∣tween
the said Captain General, and
his Interest on one Hand, and the o∣ther
Favourite Boy who kept the
School Cash, and his Friends and
Dependents on the other.</P>
<P>Like a Fire in a House, which lies
smothering a great while, before it
gets Vent, but creeps with the Help
of Time, and enters its way into the
Rafters and Timber of the House, en∣creasing
its Heat, and drying up all
the Moisture, till at last it breaks
out at once into a Flame; so those
cunning Boys did not at once fall to∣gether
by the Ears, and go to box it
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
out, but they managed slily and se∣cretly,
engrossing Friends, and draw∣ing
by Degrees almost the whole
School to be concern'd, and to show
themselves on one side or the other.</P>
<P>The Captain General held his Hold
principally by his Interest in the
Schoolmaster, but felt a sensible In∣jury
to his Cause in the want of his
Health; and being not so well able to
manage as before, he found the other
Boy gat Ground of him in the School;
for there were so many Boys who had
their Dependance upon the Cash-keep∣er,
or at least, he had so many ways
to oblige and serve his Friends, that
great Numbers adher'd to him on
that Account: and besides that, the
dextrous Management of that Youth,
who was Head Clark of the School,
got Ground for him; in short, that
one Boy carried all before him, he
dispatch'd Business so readily, with
such Exactness and Application, that
none ever executed that Office so
much to the common Good; and this
gain'd him such a Character, and he
deserv'd it so well, that it was thought
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
the Schoolmaster could not but have
an exceeding Value for him.</P>
<P>It is certain, that in most Govern∣ments,
it is sometimes a Crime to
excel; Moderate Merit gets many
Friends, but uncommon Merit raises
invincible Enemies, and Opposition;
for all those who cannot come up
to it, find they must sink under it,
and therefore vote it dangerous: The
Captain General of the Boys being
now recovered, and come into the
School again, soon found that the
Captain of the Cashkeepers, supported
by the extraordinary Assistance of his
Brother in Law, began to be formida∣ble,
and therefore found, that if he ex∣pected
to carry his Point, this Sup∣porter
must be removed; not that he
had either any Room to form an Ac∣cusation
against him, or any m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lici∣ous
Desire to hurt or de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame him,
but he found he stood in the Way
of his Interest, and would, perhaps,
in Time, be fatal to it: and therefore,
as it is said, he resolv'd he must be
removed.</P>
<P>Historians differ in the Manner how
this Blow was given. Some relate that
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
it was done purely by Defamation
and Slander, representing him to the
<HI>Schoolmaster</HI> as turbulent and quarrel∣some
in the <HI>School,</HI> haughty and fierce,
affronting his <HI>Schoolfellows,</HI> presuming
on the Merit of his <HI>Services,</HI> and his
Interest with the Master, and such like;
Others relate, that they got a Propo∣sal
craftily made to him, about bring∣ing
in some <HI>Foreign</HI> Boys into the
<HI>School,</HI> which the Master had a Kind∣ness
for; and that, on the other Hand,
they as craftily brought him to oppose
it; and then accused him of Disrespect
to the Master: Others relate it
otherwise; so the Matter is left doubt∣ful
in History; but this they all
agree in, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that without the least
previous Notice, without any Reproof,
or the least Hint from the Schoolma∣ster,
that he was displeased with him,
his Quietus was brought over, and
presented him, and he was immedi∣ately
removed from the Class.</P>
<P>It is impossible to describe the
Confusion, this sudden Blow put all
the School in; The Boys were from
that Time forward all in an Uproar,
no Body knew who would be in, or
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
who out, nor did any think himself
safe; Some believing it was all done
by the Captain General of the Boys,
began to think he would carry all
before him, and therefore willing to
secure themselves, they run all over
to him, clapt him on the Back, and
cry'd, <HI>G—d a mercy John:</HI> and so
took Care to be thought his Friends,
if the worst came to the worst.</P>
<P>Others chagrin'd at this unusual,
unexpected Stop, and at the Manner
of it especially, murmur'd in private,
and said, that it was very strange,
that the Head Boys of the School
should act thus, after all that had
been seen and said, of the Madness
and Folly of those that went before
them, when it was evident, that di∣viding
and Party-making among the
Captains of Forms, and the Head
Boys of the School, was the Ruine and
Destruction of the School; and that
these very Boys had exclaim'd against
it so much, nay, when in the publick
Exercises of the School, they had of∣ten
recommended these Things as the
Subject of their Orations, Declama∣tions,
and Poetical Flights, (<HI>viz.) the
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
Wisdom of Governments in preserving
Peace among the Senators: the Danger
of Divisions in a State: the Excellen∣cy
of Ʋnity among the Citizens: the
Necessity of a Harmony among Magi∣strates,
to the Safety of the Common∣wealth,
and the like.</HI> They said, it
was a strange Thing, to see such
Doings among Boys, who had made
such loud Pretences to the contrary.</P>
<P><HI>Again, they said,</HI> the Reputation
of the <HI>School</HI> would be entirely ru∣in'd,
if not the very Constitution of
it; For now it would be said, that
these Boys were no better than those
that went before them; that it
would be evident now to all the
World, that all the pretended Zeal
they had shewn against the Rudeness
and unlucky Tricks of the Boys that
were in before, was only that they
might get them expell'd, and so
might slip into their Places; that any
<HI>Schoolmaster</HI> would have been alike
to them, only that they found
this <HI>Schoolmaster</HI> would stand by them,
and therefore it was, that they were
so eager to stand by him; That
now they were gotten in to be Heads
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
of Classes, and Captains of the Forms,
it was plain, they meant no other than
their own private Interest and Glory;
for that now, to maintain themselves,
and supplant one another, they made
no Scruple to run the Hazard of ru∣ining
the Master, and all the rest of
the Scholars, and in a Word, of break∣ing
the whole School.</P>
<P>Others exclaimed another Way,
and said, the Design was good, and
that all the Captain General had in
View was, to temper the Heat of the
Cash-keepers Party in the School, who
carry'd Things too high, and was so
uneasy, that he would never leave, till,
on Pretence of Justice and Revenge,
he had frighted all the Boys that were
not of his Party away from the
School; they said, moderate Measures
was the only Way to preserve the In∣terest
of the Schoolmaster; that it
was sufficient that the Heads of former
Disorders had been severely scourged,
and expelled the School; that to pur∣sue
to Extremity all the particular
Boys, who had the least Concern in
former Things, but were now re∣claimed,
was carrying things too far;
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
that the Business was to govern them,
not to destroy them; that the School∣master's
Power was such, that he was
out of Danger from their evil De∣signs,
if they had any; and that it
was more agreeable to the Clemency
of his Disposition, to forgive, than to
punish them; that to run things on
with Severity, and spare no Body,
was to con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess a Weakness of Power,
and a Fear that those few Scholars
yet culpable, might be dangerous,
which it was below the Spirit of the
Master to apprehend; that Examples
enough had been made; and that now
it was Time to think of gentler Me∣thods,
that the Schoolmaster might
gain the Affection, as well as secure
the Submission of all his Scholars.
They added, that it was never known
before, but when any new <HI>School∣master</HI>
came to the <HI>School,</HI> he would
forgive what was past, that he might
encourage the Boys to merit well
of him for Time to come; but that to
ravel into Trifles, was rather to seek
Occasions against the Scholars, than
to do Justice; and that therefore they
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
were for bringing the Troubles of
the School to an End.</P>
<P>To this it was return'd: That this
tended to make a divided School of it
to the End of the World; that it
would preserve Faction, and cultivate
Parties for ever; that now was the
Time they had so long struggled for,
and which their new Master had pro∣mised,
should be the Effect of his
coming to the School, <HI>viz.</HI> that the
School should be purged effectually of
all wicked, debauch'd, refractory, and
rebellious Boys, and that they should
be expell'd, whoever they were; that
they abhorred the Notion of a <HI>MOT∣LEY</HI>
School, to set up some Friends
to the Schoolmaster, and some Ene∣mies,
so to have the Schoolmaster be
never easy, never serv'd, and the
School it self never safe: They said,
this was to lose all the Fruit of their
long Struggle at once, and to pull
down with their own Hands the Bul∣warks
of the School which they had
built up.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted, but as this
put all the School into a Disorder, so
an Account of it was, from time to
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
time, sent over to the Schoolmaster,
and to desire him to hasten over as
fast as his Business would permit him,
that by his Presence and Authority,
and the Majesty of his Office, he
might quiet the School, and bring
things into some better Order.</P>
<P>The Schoolmaster, sensible of the
Necessity there was of his Presence,
made all the Haste he could to dis∣patch
his Affairs; but having things
of great Consequence on his Hands,
they took him up more Time than he,
or the Scholars, either expected, be∣fore
he could come.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the School was
a meer <HI>Bedlam,</HI> Books and Business
seem'd all laid aside, every mean Scho∣lar,
that had scarce entred into the
Verges of Philosophy, was over Head
and Ears in Politicks, and attach'd to
his Party. The Forms were all up in
Arms against one another, as the Heads
or Captains guided them, they fell into
the warmest Disputes imaginable;
nay, sometimes they were so hot, that
they were ready to throw their Books
at one anothers Heads.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
In a Word; this Contention was
come to that Height, that, had it not
been that they had a Master, whose
Authority and Person maintained an
Awe in their Minds, and who, they
knew, when he did come, would be
in a Condition to call them all to an
Account, and would not be afraid to
do it; I say, had it not been for this,
it was the Opinion of wise Men at
that Time, that they would have torn
one another to Pieces, and set the
whole School on Fire.</P>
<P>In the very Crisis of this Fewd,
and just as they were all going mad,
being as it may be said, just got out
of the Government of themselves,
comes the Schoolmaster on Shore, and
making no Stay, he went directly to
the School: He found by the Noise,
there was no Room for Words, Per∣swasions,
Expostulations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where∣fore
with an awful Frown upon his
Brow, and holding up his Rod in his
Hand, he enters the <HI>School,</HI> and being
just within the Door, looked sternly
round him, not speaking a Word.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39"/>
The Boys no sooner saw the Master
and the Rod, but they all sat down
as quiet and as still, as if nothing had
happened at all; not a Word was
spoken, not the least Noise heard, all
was perfectly calm and quiet in a Mo∣ment;
the Master went peaceably up to
his Chair of Instruction, and laid down
his Rod; the <HI>Scholars</HI> fell very loving∣ly
to their Books, and have been very
good Boys ever since.</P>
