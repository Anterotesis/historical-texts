<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON
METHODS for preventing the Ruine
of GREAT-BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE it hath pleased God to visit this
Land, and make us feel the fatal Effects
of our Corruption and Folly, it should be
our care to profit by this Judgment, and
make it an occasion of our Reformation ra∣ther
than of our final Ruin. Sure it is, if we had
been suffered to go on, a few Years longer,
in that full tide of Prosperity, which hath al∣ready
so bewitched and debauched the Nation,
we must have irretrievably undone our selves,
and grown the same vile corrupt Slaves, with
those whose Vices and Follies we have so
eagerly copied: whereas if warned by our
present Calamities, we seriously reflect on the
Causes that led to them, and remove them by a
contrary Conduct, we may still become a greater
and more flourishing People than ever; it be∣ing
as evident, both from Reason and Experi∣ence,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
that Industry, Sobriety of Manners,
and the Fear of God build up and preserve a
People, as that Vice and Irreligion ruin them.
It is therefore heartily to be wished that our
Legislature would, as they love their Coun∣try,
think of effectual methods for restoring
and promoting <HI>Religion, Industry, Frugality,</HI>
and <HI>Public Spirit,</HI> which ever were, and ever
will be, the only sure Foundation of public
Happiness and Prosperity.</P>
<P>RELIGION hath in former days been
cherished and reverenced by wise Patriots and
Lawgivers, as knowing it to be impossible,
that a Nation should thrive and flourish with∣out
Virtue, or that Virtue should subsist with∣out
Conscience, or Conscience without Reli∣gion:
insomuch, that an Atheist or Infidel
was looked on with Abhorrence, and treated
as an Enemy to his Country. But in these
wiser times, a cold Indifference for the natio∣nal
Religion, and indeed for all matters of
Faith and divine Worship, is thought good
Sense. It is even become fashionable to decry
Religion; and that little talent of Ridicule
is applied to such wrong purposes, that a good
Christian can hardly keep himself in Counte∣nance.</P>
<P>Liberty is the greatest humane Blessing that
a virtuous Man can possess, and is very con∣sistent
with the Duties of a good Subject and
a good Christian. But the present Age a∣boundeth
with injudicious Patrons of Liberty,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
who, not distinguishing between that and
Licentiousness, take the surest Method
to discredit what they would seem to
propagate. For, in effect, can there be a
greater Affront offered to that just freedom
of Thought and Action, which is the Prero∣gative
of a Rational Creature, or can any
thing recommend it less to honest Minds,
than under Colour thereof to obtrude Scurri∣lity
and Profaneness on the World? But it
hath been always observed of weak Men, that
they know not how to avoid one Extream
without running into another.</P>
<P>Too many of this sort pass upon vulgar
Readers for great Authors and Men of pro∣found
Thought, not on account of any Su∣periority
either in Sense or Style, both which
they possess in a very moderate degree, nor
of any Discoveries they have made in Arts or
Sciences, which they seem to be little ac∣quainted
with: but purely because they flat∣ter
the Passions of corrupt Men, who are
pleased to have the clamours of Conscience
silenced, and those great points of the Chri∣stian
Religion made suspected which with∣held
them from many vices of Pleasure and
Interest, or made them uneasy in the com∣mission
of them.</P>
<P>In order to promote that laudable design
of effacing all Sense of Religion from among
us, they form themselves into Assemblies, and
proceed with united Counsels and Endeavours.
With what Success, and with what Merit to∣wards
the Public, the Effects too plainly
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
shew. I will not say, these Gentlemen have
formed a direct design to ruin their Coun∣try,
or that they have the Sense to see half
the ill Consequences, which must necessa∣rily
flow from the spreading of their Opini∣ons.
But the Nation feels them, and it is
high time the Legislature put a stop to
them.</P>
<P>I am not for placing an invidious Power in
the Hands of the Clergy, or complying with
the Narrowness of any mistaken Zealots, who
should incline to persecute Dissenters: but
whatever Conduct, common Sense as well as
Christian Charity obligeth us to use, towards
those who differ from us in some points of
Religion, yet the public Safety requireth,
that the avowed Contemners of all Religion
should be severely chastised. And, perhaps,
it may be no easy matter to assign a good
reason, why Blasphemy against God should
not be inquired into and punished with the
same rigour as Treason against the King.</P>
<P>For in fine, we may attempt to patch up
our Affairs: but it will be to no purpose.
The Finger of God will unravel all our vain
Projects, and make them Snares to draw us
into greater Calamities; if we do not reform
that scandalous Libertinism, which (whate∣ver
some shallow Men may think) is our worst
Symptome and the surest Prognostic of our
Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
INDUSTRY is the natural sure way to
Wealth. This is so true, that it is impossible
an industrious free People should want the
Necessaries and Comforts of Life, or an idle
enjoy them under any form of Government.
Money is so far useful to the Public, as it
promoteth Industry; and Credit having the
same effect, is of the same value with Mo∣ney.
But Money or Credit circulating tho∣rough
a Nation from Hand to Hand, with∣out
producing Labour and Industry in the In∣habitants,
is direct Gaming.</P>
<P>It is not impossible for cunning Men to make
such plausible Schemes, as may draw those
who are less skilful into their own and the
public Ruin. But surely, there is no Man of
Sense and Honesty but must see and own,
whether he understands the Game or not,
that it is an evident Folly for any People, in∣stead
of prosecuting the old honest methods
of Industry and Frugality, to sit down to a
public Gaming Table, and play off their Mo∣ny
one to another.</P>
<P>The more Methods there are in a State for
acquiring Riches without Industry or Merit,
the less there will be of either in that State.
This is as evident as the Ruin that attends it.
Besides, when Mony is shifted from Hand to
Hand in such a blind fortuitous manner, that
some Men shall from nothing in an instant
acquire vast Estates without the least desert:
while others are as suddenly stript of plenti∣ful
Fortunes, and left on the Parish by their
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
own Avarice and Credulity: what can be
hoped for on the one hand, but abandoned
Luxury and Wantonness; or on the other, but
extream Madness and Despair?</P>
<P>In short, all Projects for growing rich by
sudden and extraordinary methods, as they ope∣rate
violently on the Passions of Men, and en∣courage
them to despise the slow moderate
Gains that are to be made by an honest In∣dustry,
must be ruinous to the Public; and
even the Winners themselves will at length be
involved in the Public Ruine.</P>
<P>It is an easy matter to contrive Projects for
the Encouragement of Industry; I wish it were
as easy to perswade Men to put them in practice.
There is no Country in <HI>Europe</HI> where there is
so much Charity collected for the Poor, and
none where it is so ill managed. If the Poor
Tax was fixed at a medium in every Parish,
taken from a Calculation of the last ten Years,
and raised for seven Years by Act of Parlia∣ment,
that Sum (if the common Estimate be
not very wrong) frugally and prudently laid
out in Work-houses, would for ever free the
Nation from the care of providing for the
Poor, and at the same time considerably im∣prove
our Manufactures. We might by these
means rid our Streets of Beggars; even the
Children, the Maimed, and the Blind might
be put in a way of doing something for their
livelyhood. As for the small number of those,
who by Age or Infirmities, are utterly inca∣pable
of all Employment, they might be main∣tained
by the Labour of others. And the
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Public would receive no small advan∣tage
from the Industry of those, who
are now so great a Burthen and Expence
to it.</P>
<P>The same Tax, continued three Years longer,
might be very usefully employed in making
high Roads, and rendering Rivers Navigable,
two things of so much Profit and Ornament
to a Nation, that we seem the only People in
<HI>Europe</HI> who have neglected them. So that in
the Space of ten Years the Public may be for
ever freed from a heavy Tax, Industry encou∣raged,
Commerce facilitated, and the whole
Country improved. And all this only by a fru∣gal
honest Management, without raising one
Penny extraordinary.</P>
<P>The Number of People is both Means and
Motive to Industry, it should therefore be of
great use to encourage Propagation, by allow∣ing
some Reward or Privilege to those who
have a certain number of Children; And, on
the other hand, enacting that the Public shall
inherit the unentailed Estates of all who die un∣married
of either Sex.</P>
<P>Beside the immediate End proposed by the
foregoing methods, they furnish Taxes upon
Passengers, and dead Batchelors, which are in
no sort grievous to the Subject, and may be
applied towards clearing the public Debt:
which, all Mankind agree, highly concerneth
the Nation in general, both Court and Coun∣try.
<HI>Caesar,</HI> indeed, mentions it as a piece of
Policy, that he borrowed Mony from his Offi∣cers
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
to bestow it on the Soldiers, which fixed
both to his Interest. And tho' something like
this may pass for Skill at certain junctures in
Civil Government, yet if carried too far it will
prove a dangerous Experiment.</P>
<P>There is still room for Invention or Im∣provement
in most Trades and Manufactures;
and it is probable, that Premiums given on
that account to ingenious Artists would soon
be repayed a hundred-fold to the Public. No
Colour is so much worn in <HI>Italy, Spain,</HI> and
<HI>Portugal</HI> as Black: but our black Cloth is nei∣ther
so lasting nor of so good a Dye as the
<HI>Dutch;</HI> which is the reason of their engrossing
the Profits of that Trade. This is so true, that
I have known <HI>English</HI> Merchants abroad wear
black Cloth of <HI>Holland</HI> themselves, and sell and
recommend it as better than that of their own
Country. It is commonly said the Water of
<HI>Leyden</HI> hath a peculiar property for colouring
Black. But it hath been also said and passed
current, that good Glasses could be made no
where but at <HI>Venice,</HI> and there only in the lit∣tle
Island of <HI>Morano:</HI> which was attributed to
some peculiar property in the Air. And we
may possibly find other Opinions of that sort
to be as groundless, should the Legislature think
it worth while to propose Premiums in the
foregoing or the like cases of general Benefit
to the Public. But I remember to have seen,
about seven Years ago, a Man pointed at in a
Coffee-house, who (they said) had first intro∣duced
the right Scarlet Dye among us; by
which the Nation in general, as well as many
private Persons, have since been great Gainers;
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
tho' he was himself a Beggar; who, if this be
true, deserved an honourable Maintenance from
the Public.</P>
<P>There are also several Manufactures which
we have from abroad, that may be carried on
to as great Perfection here as elsewhere. If it
be considered that more fine Linnen is worn
in <HI>Great Britain</HI> than in any other Country of
<HI>Europe,</HI> it will be difficult to assign a Reason
why Paper may not be made here as good,
and in the same quantity, as in <HI>Holland,</HI> or
<HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Genoa.</HI> This is a Manufacture of
great consumption, and would save much to
the Public. The like may be said of Tapestry,
Lace, and other Manufactures, which if set
on foot in cheap parts of the Country, would
employ many hands, and save Mony to the
Nation, as well as bring it from abroad. Pro∣jects
for improving old Manufactures, or set∣ting
up new ones, should not be despised in a
trading Country: But the making them pre∣tences
for Stockjobbing hath been a fatal Im∣position.</P>
<P>As Industry dependeth upon Trade, and
this, as well as the public Security, upon our
Navigation, it concerneth the Legislature to
provide that the number of our Sailors do not
decrease. To which it would very much con∣duce,
if a Law were made prohibiting the
Payment of Sailors in Foreign Ports: for it is
usual with those on board Merchant-men, as
soon as they set foot ashore to receive their
Pay, which is soon spent in riotous living.
And when they have emptied their Pockets,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
the temptation of a Pistole present Mony ne∣ver
faileth to draw them into any Foreign Ser∣vice.
To this (if I may credit the Informati∣on
I have had from some <HI>English</HI> Factors abroad)
it is chiefly owing, that the <HI>Venetians, Spani∣ards,</HI>
and others, have so many <HI>English</HI> on board
their Ships. Some Merchants indeed and Ma∣sters
of Vessels may make a Profit in defraud∣ing
those poor Wretches, when they pay
them in strange Coin (which I have been as∣sured
often amounts to twelve-pence in the
Crown) as well as in ridding themselves of
the Charge of keeping them when they sell
their Ships, or stay long in Port. But the
Public loseth both the Mony and the Men,
who, if their Arrears were to be cleared at
home, would be sure to return, and spend
them in their own Country. It is a shame this
abuse should not be remedied.</P>
<P>FRUGALITY of Manners is the Nou∣rishment
and Strength of Bodies Politic. It
is that by which they grow and subsist, till
they are corrupted by Luxury, the natural
cause of their decay and ruine. Of this we
have Examples in the <HI>Persians, Lacedaemonians</HI>
and <HI>Romans:</HI> not to mention many later Go∣vernments
which have sprung up, continued a
while, and then perished by the same natural
Causes. But these are it seems of no use to us:
and, in spight of them, we are in a fair way of
becoming our selves another useless Example to
future Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Men are apt to measure national Prosperity
by Riches: it would be righter to measure it
by the Use that is made of them. Where they
promote an honest Commerce among Men,
and are Motives to Industry and Virtue, they
are without doubt of great advantage. But
where they are made (as too often happens) an
Instrument to Luxury, they enervate and di∣spirit
the bravest People. So just is that Re∣mark
of <HI>Machiavel</HI>'s, that there is no truth
in the common Saying, <HI>Mony is the Nerves of
War.</HI> And tho' we may subsist tolerably for
a time among corrupt Neighbours, yet if ever
we have to do with a hardy, temperate, reli∣gious
sort of Men, we shall find, to our cost,
that all our Riches are but a poor exchange
for that Simplicity of Manners which we de∣spise
in our Ancestors. This sole advantage
hath been the main support of all those Re∣publics
that have made a figure in the World:
and perhaps it might be no ill Policy in a King∣dom
to form it self upon the Manners of a Re∣public.</P>
<P>Simplicity of Manners may be more easily
preserved in a Republic than a Monarchy; but,
if once lost, may be sooner recovered in a Monar∣chy,
the Example of a Court being of great Effi∣cacy,
either to reform or corrupt a People.
That alone were sufficient to discountenance
the wearing of Gold or Silver, either on Cloaths
or Equipages. And if the same were prohibi∣ted
by Law, the saving so much Bullion would
be the smallest Benefit of such an Institution;
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
there being nothing more apt to debase the
Virtue and good Sense of our Gentry of both
Sexes, than that trifling vanity of Apparel,
which we have learned from <HI>France,</HI> and which
hath had such visible ill Consequences on the Ge∣nius
of that People. Wiser Nations have made
it their Care to shut out this folly by severe
Laws and Penalties. And its spreading among
us can forebode no good, if there be any truth
in the Observation of one of the Ancients, that
<HI>the direct way to ruine a Man is to dress him
up in fine Cloaths.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be denied that Luxury of Dress
giveth a light Behaviour to our Women, which
may pass for a small Offence, because it is a
common one, but is, in truth, the source of great
Corruptions. For this very Offence the Prophet
<HI>Isaiah</HI> denounced a severe Judgment against the
Ladies of his time. I shall give the Passage at
length. “Moreover the Lord saith, because
the Daughters of <HI>Zion</HI> are haughty and walk
with stretched forth Necks, walking and
mincing as they go, and making a tinkling
with their Feet. Therefore the Lord will
smite with a scab the Crown of the Head
of the Daughters of <HI>Zion,</HI> and the Lord will
discover their secret parts. In that Day the
Lord will take away the bravery of their
tinkling Ornaments about their Feet, and
their cauls and their round tires like the
Moon; the chains, and the bracelets, and
the mufflers; the bonnets and the ornaments
of the Legs, and the head-bands, and the
tablets and the ear-rings. The rings and
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
nose-jewels, the changeable Suits of Appa∣rel,
and the mantles, and the wimples, and
the crisping pins. The glasses and the fine
linnen, and the hoods and the vails. And
it shall come to pass that instead of sweet
smell there shall be a stink: and instead of
a girdle a rent; and instead of well-set
hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher
a girding of sackcloth: and burning instead
of Beauty.” The Scab, the Stench, and the
Burning are terrible pestilential Symptoms,
and our Ladies would do well to consider,
they may chance to resemble those of <HI>Zion</HI>
in their Punishment as well as their Offence.</P>
<P>But Dress is not the only thing to be re∣formed.
Sumptuary Laws are useful in ma∣ny
other Points. In former times the natu∣ral
Plainness and good Sense of the <HI>English</HI>
made them less necessary. But ever since the
luxurious Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second,
we have been doing Violence to our Natures,
and are by this time so much altered for the
worse, that it is to be feared, the very same Dis∣positions
that make them necessary, will for ever
hinder their being Enacted or put in Execution.</P>
<P>A private Family in difficult Circumstances,
all Men agree, ought to melt down their
Plate, walk on foot, retrench the number of
their Servants, wear neither Jewels nor rich
Cloaths, and deny themselves expensive Diver∣sions;
and why not the Public? Had any
thing like this been done, our Taxes had been
less, or, which is the same thing, we shou'd
have felt them less. But it is very remarkable,
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
that Luxury was never at so great a height,
nor spread so generally through the Nation, as
during the Expence of the late Wars and the
heavy Debt that still lieth upon us.</P>
<P>This Vice draweth after it a train of E∣vils
which cruelly infest the Public: Faction,
Ambition, Envy, Avarice, and that of the
worst kind, being much more hurtful in its
consequences, tho' not so infamous as Penury.
It was the great art of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu,</HI> by
encouraging Luxury and Expence to impove∣rish
the <HI>French</HI> Nobility, and render them altoge∣ther
dependent on the Crown, which hath been
since very successfully effected. These and
many more Considerations shew the necessity
there is for Sumptuary Laws. Nor can any
thing be said against them in this Island, which
might not with equal force be objected in o∣ther
Countries, which have nevertheless
judged the public benefit of such Instituti∣ons,
to be of far greater importance than the
short sufferings of a few who subsist by the
Luxury of others.</P>
<P>It is evident, that old Taxes may be better
born, as well as new ones raised by Sumptu∣ary
Laws judiciously framed, not to damage
our Trade but retrench our Luxury. It is
evident, that for want of these, Luxury
(which, like other fashions, never faileth to des∣cend)
hath infected all ranks of People, and
that this enableth the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> to
undersell us, to the great prejudice of our
Traffic. We cannot but know that in our
present circumstances, it should be our Care,
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
as it is our Interest, to make Poverty tolera∣ble.
In fine, we have the Experience of ma∣ny
Ages to convince us, that a corrupt
luxurious People must of themselves fall into
Slavery, altho' no Attempt be made upon
them. These and the like obvious Reflexions
should, one would think, have forced any
People in their Senses upon frugal measures.</P>
<P>But we are doomed to be undone. Neither
the plain Reason of the thing, nor the Ex∣perience
of passed Ages, nor the Examples
we have before our Eyes, can restrain us from
imitating, not to say surpassing, the most cor∣rupt
and ruined People, in those very points
of Luxury that ruined them. Our Gaming,
our Opera's, our Masquerades, are, in spight
of our Debts and Poverty, become the Won∣der
of our Neighbours. If there be any
Man so void of all Thought and common
Sense, as not to see where this must end,
let him but compare what <HI>Venice</HI> was at
the League of <HI>Cambray,</HI> with what it is at
present, and he will be convinced, how truly
those fashionable Pastimes are calculated to
depress and ruine a Nation.</P>
<P>But neither <HI>Venice</HI> nor <HI>Paris,</HI> nor any other
Town in any part of the World, ever knew
such an expensive ruinous Folly as our Mas∣querade.
This alone is sufficient to inflame
and satisfy the several Appetites for Gaming,
Dressing, Intriguing, luxurious Eating and
Drinking. It is a most skilful Abridgment,
the very Quintessence, the Abstract, of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those
senseless Vanities, that have ever been the
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
ruine of Fools and detestation of Wise Men.
And all this under the notion of an elegant
Entertainment hath been admitted among us:
tho' it be in truth a Contagion of the worst
kind. The Plague, dreadful as it is, is an E∣vil
of short duration. Cities have often re∣covered
and flourished after it. But when
was it known that a People broken and cor∣rupted
by Luxury recovered themselves? Not
to say, that general Corruption of Manners
never faileth to draw after it some heavy
Judgment of War, Famine or Pestilence. Of
this we have a fresh instance in one of the
most debauched Towns of <HI>Europe.</HI> And no
body knows how soon it may be our own
Case. This elegant Entertainment is indeed
suspended for the present, but there remains
so strong a Propension towards it, that if the
Wisdom of the Legislature do not interpose,
it will soon return with the additional temp∣tation
of having been forbid for a time. It
were stupid and barbarous to declaim against
keeping up the Spirit of the People by pro∣per
Diversions. But then they should be pro∣per,
such as polish and improve their Minds
or encrease the Strength and Activity of their
Bodies: none of which Ends are answered by
the Masquerade, no more than by those
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Follies, which, to our
shame, are imported and encouraged at a time,
when the Nation ought to be too grave for
such Trifles.</P>
<P>It is not to be believed, what Influence
public Diversions have on the Spirit and Man∣ners
of a People. The <HI>Greeks</HI> wisely saw
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
this, and made a very serious affair of their
Public Sports. For the same reason, it will
perhaps seem worthy the care of our Legisla∣ture,
to regulate the Public Diversions, by an
absolute Prohibition of those which have a
direct tendency to corrupt our Morals, as well
as by a Reformation of the Drama: which,
when rightly managed, is such a noble enter∣tainment,
and gave those fine Lessons of Mo∣rality
and good Sense to the <HI>Athenians</HI> of
old, and to our <HI>British</HI> Gentry about a Cen∣tury
ago: but for these last sixty Years, hath
entertained us, for the most part, with such
poor sorry things as spoil, instead of improv∣ing,
the Taste and Manners of the Audience.
Those who are attentive to such propositions
only, as may fill their Pockets, will proba∣bly
slight these things as Trifles below the
care of the Legislature. But I am sure, all
Honest Thinking Men must lament to see
their Country run headlong into all those
Luxurious Follies, which, it is evident, have
been fatal to other Nations, and will un∣doubtedly
prove fatal to us also, if a timely
stop be not put to them.</P>
<P>PUBLIC SPIRIT, that Glorious
Principle of all that is great and good, is so
far from being cherished or encouraged,
that it is become ridiculous in this en∣lightened
Age, which is taught to laugh at
every thing that is serious as well as sacred.
The same Atheistical narrow Spirit, centring
all our Cares upon private Interest, and con∣tracting
all our Hopes within the Enjoyment
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
of this present Life, equally produceth a neg∣lect
of what we owe to God and our Coun∣try.
<HI>Tully</HI> hath long since observed, that it
is impossible for those, who have no belief of
the Immortality of the Soul or a future State
of Rewards and Punishments, to Sacrifice
their particular Interests and Passions to the
Public Good, or have a generous Concern
for Posterity: And our own Experience con∣firmeth
the truth of this Observation.</P>
<P>In order therefore to recover a Sense of
Public Spirit, it is to be wished that Men
were first affected with a true Sense of Reli∣gion:
<HI>Pro aris &amp; focis</HI> having ever been the
great Motive to Courage and Perseverance in
a Public Cause.</P>
<P>It wou'd likewise be a very useful Policy,
and warranted by the example of the wisest
Governments, to make the natural Love of
Fame and Reputation subservient to promot∣ing
that noble Principle. Triumphal Arches,
Columns, Statues, Inscriptions, and the like
Monuments of Public Services, have in for∣mer
times been found great Incentives to
Virtue and Magnanimity, and would proba∣bly
have the same effects on <HI>Englishmen,</HI> which
they have had on <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> And,
perhaps, a Pillar of Infamy would be found
a proper and exemplary Punishment in cases
of signal Public Villany, where the loss of
Fortune, Liberty or Life are not proportioned
to the Crime: or where the Skill of the Of∣fender,
or the Nature of his Offence, may
skreen him from the Letter of the Law.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
Several of these are to be seen at <HI>Genoa,
Milan,</HI> and other Towns of <HI>Italy,</HI> where it
is the Custom to demolish the House of a Ci∣tizen,
who hath conspired the Ruin of his
Country, or been guilty of any enormous
Crime towards the Public, and in place there∣of
to erect a Monument of the Crime and
Criminal described in the blackest manner.
We have nothing of this sort, that I know,
but that which is commonly called the Monu∣ment:
which in the last Age was erected for
a trifle, in all its circumstances and conse∣quences,
if compared with the modern un∣exampled
attempt of Men easy in their For∣tunes,
and unprovoked by Hardships of any
sort in cool Blood and with open Eyes to
ruine their Native Country. This foul fact
will never be forgotten, and it were to be
wished that with it the Public Detestation
thereof may be transmitted to Posterity,
which would in some measure vindicate the
Honour of the present and be an useful Les∣son
to future Ages.</P>
<P>Those noble Arts of Architecture, Sculp∣ture,
and Painting do not only adorn the
Public, but have also an influence on the
Minds and Manners of Men, filling them
with great Ideas, and spiriting them up to
an Emulation of worthy Actions. For this
Cause they were cultivated and encouraged
by the <HI>Greek</HI> Cities, who vied with each o∣ther
in building and adorning their Temples,
Theaters, Portico's and the like Public
Works, at the same time that they discou∣raged
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
private Luxury: the very reverse of our
Conduct.</P>
<P>To propose the building a Parliament
House, Courts of Justice, Royal Palace, and
other Public Edifices suitable to the Dignity
of the Nation, and adorning them with
Paintings and Statues, which may transmit
memorable Things and Persons to Posterity,
would probably be laughed at as a vain Affair,
of great Expence and little use to the Public;
and it must be owned, we have reduced our
selves to such Straits, that any Proposition of
Expence suiteth ill with our present circum∣stances.
But how improper soever this Pro∣posal
may be for the Times, yet it comes so
properly into a Discourse of Public Spirit,
that I could not but say something of it.
And at another time it will not seem un∣reasonable,
if we consider that it is no more
than the wisest Nations have done before us,
that it would spirit up new Arts, employ
many Hands, keep the Mony circulating at
home, and lastly, that it would be a notable
instance of Public Spirit, as well as a Motive
to it.</P>
<P>The same noble Principle may be also en∣couraged,
by erecting an Academy of inge∣nious
Men whose Employment it should be
to compile the History of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to
make Discourses proper to inspire Men with a
Zeal for the Public, and celebrate the Memo∣ry
of those who have been Ornaments to the
Nation, or done it eminent Service. Not to
mention, that this would improve our Lan∣guage,
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
and amuse some busy Spirits of the
Age: which, perhaps, would be no ill Po∣licy.</P>
<P>This is not without Example: for, to say
nothing of the <HI>French</HI> Academy which is
prostituted to meaner Purposes, it hath been
the Custom of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate, to ap∣point
one of their Order to continue the
History of the Republic. This was introdu∣ced
in the flourishing State of that People,
and is still in force. We fall short of other
Nations in the number of good Historians,
tho' no Nation in Christendom hath produced
greater Events, or more worthy to be record∣ed.
The <HI>Athenian</HI> Senate appointed Orators
to commemorate annually those who died in
defence of their Country, which Solemnity
was performed at the Monuments erected in
honour of them by the Public: and the Pa∣negyrics
composed by <HI>Isocrates</HI> and <HI>Pericles,</HI>
as well as many Passages in <HI>Tully,</HI> inform
us with what pleasure the ancient Orators
used to expatiate in Praise of their Coun∣try.</P>
<P>Concord and Union among our selves is ra∣ther
to be hoped for, as an Effect of public
Spirit, than proposed as a Means to promote
it. Candid, generous Men, who are true
Lovers of their Country, can never be Ene∣mies
to one half of their Countrymen, or car∣ry
their Resentments so far as to ruine the
Public for the sake of a Party. Now I have
fallen upon the mention of our Parties, I shall
beg leave to insert a Remark or two, for the
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
Service both of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> without en∣tering
into their respective Merits. <HI>First,</HI> It
is impossible for either Party to ruine the o∣ther,
without involving Themselves and their
Posterity in the same Ruine. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It is
very feasible for either Party to get the bet∣ter
of the other, if they could first get the
better of themselves; and instead of indulging
the little womanish Passions of Obstinacy,
Resentment, and Revenge, steadily promote
the true Interest of their Country, in those
great clear Points of Piety, Industry, Sobrie∣ty
of Manners, and an honest Regard for Po∣sterity;
which, all Men of Sense agree, are
essential to public Happiness. There would
be something so great and good in this Con∣duct,
as must necessarily overbear all Ca∣lumny
and Opposition. But that Men should
act reasonably is rather to be wished than
hoped.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that to talk of public
Spirit, and the Means of retrieving it, must
to narrow sordid Minds be matter of Jest and
Ridicule, how conformable soever it be to
right Reason and the Maxims of Antiquity.
Tho' one would think, the most selfish Men
might see it was their Interest to encourage
a Spirit in others by which they, to be
sure, must be Gainers. Yet, such is the Cor∣ruption
and Folly of the present Age, that a
public Spirit is treated like Ignorance of the
World, and want of Sense; and all the Re∣spect
is paid to cunning Men, who bend
and wrest the Public Interest to their own
private Ends, that in other times hath been
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
thought due to those who were generous e∣nough
to sacrifice their private Interest to
that of their Country.</P>
<P>Such Practices and such Maxims as these
must necessarily ruine a State. But if the
contrary should prevail, we may hope to see
Men in Power prefer the public Wealth and
Security to their own, and Men of Money
make free Gifts or lend it without Interest
to their Country. This, how strange and
incredible soever it may seem to us, hath
been often done in other States. And the
natural <HI>English</HI> Temper considered, together
with the force of Example, no one can tell
how far a Proposal for a free Gift may go
among the monied Men, when set on Foot
by the Legislature, and encouraged by the
Example of two or three Men of Figure,
who have the Spirit to do a generous thing,
and the Understanding to see it is every pri∣vate
Man's Interest to support that of the
Public.</P>
<P>If they who have their Fortunes in Money
should make a voluntary Gift, the Public
would be eased, and at the same time main∣tain
it's Credit. Nor is a generous Love of
their Country the only Motive that should
induce them to this. Common Equity re∣quireth
that all Subjects should equally share
the public Burthen. And common Sense
sheweth, that those who are foremost in the
Danger should not be the most backward in
contributing to prevent it</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Before I leave this Subject, I cannot but
take notice of that most infamous Practice of
Bribery, than which nothing can be more
opposite to Public Spirit. Since every one
who takes a Bribe, plainly owns that he pre∣fers
his private Interest to that of his Country.
This Corruption is become a national Crime,
having infected the lowest as well as the highest
among us, and is so general and notorious,
that, as it cannot be matched in former Ages,
so it is to be hoped it will not be imitated by
Posterity. This calls to mind another natio∣nal
Guilt which we possess in a very eminent
degree: There being no Nation under the
Sun where solemn Perjury is so common, or
where there are such Temptations to it. The
making Men swear so often in their own
Cases, and where they have an Interest to
conceal the Truth, hath gradually worn off
that awful Respect which was once thought
due to an Appeal to Almighty God: Inso∣much
that Men now-a-days break their Fast
and a Custom-house Oath with the same
Peace of Mind. It is a Policy peculiar to us,
the obliging Men to perjure or betray them∣selves,
and hath had no one good Effect, but
many very ill Ones. Sure I am, that o∣ther
Nations, without the hundredth part of
our Swearing, contrive to do their Business, at
least as well as we do. And perhaps our Le∣gislature
will think it proper to follow their
Example. For whatever Measures are taken,
so long as we lie under such a load of Guilt,
as National Perjury and National Bribery, it
is impossible we can prosper.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
This poor Nation hath sorely smarted of
late; and to ease the present Smart, a sudden
Remedy (as is natural in such cases) hath been
thought of. But we must beware not to mi∣stake
an Anodyne for a Cure. Where the Vi∣tals
are touched, and the whole mass of Hu∣mours
vitiated, it is not enough to ease the
part pained, we must look further and apply
general Correctives; otherwise the ill humour
may soon shew it self in some other part.</P>
<P>The <HI>South-Sea</HI> Affair, how sensible soever,
is not the original Evil or the great Source
of our Misfortunes; it is but the natural Effect
of those Principles which for many Years have
been propagated with great Industry. And as
a sharp Distemper by reclaiming a Man from
Intemperance may prolong his Life, so it is
not impossible but this public Calamity that
lieth so heavy on the Nation may prevent its
Ruine: It would certainly prove the greatest of
Blessings if it should make all honest Men of
one Party; If it should put Religion and Vir∣tue
in countenance, restore a sense of Public
Spirit, and convince Men it is a dangerous fol∣ly
to pursue private Aims in opposition to the
Good of their Country; If it should turn our
Thoughts from Cousenage and Stock-jobbing
to Industry and frugal Methods of Life; In
fine, if it should revive and inflame that native
spark of <HI>British</HI> Worth and Honour which hath
too long lain smothered and oppressed.</P>
<P>With this view I have, among so many
Projects for remedying the ill state of our Af∣fairs
in a particular Instance, ventured to pub∣lish
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
the foregoing general hints, which as they
have been thrown together from a Zeal for
the public Good, so I heartily wish they may
be regarded neither more nor less than as they
are fitted to promote that end.</P>
<P>Tho' it must be owned that little can be
hoped if we consider the corrupt degenerate
Age we live in. I know it is an old folly to
make peevish complaints of the Times, and
charge the common failures of human Nature
on a particular Age. One may nevertheless
venture to affirm, that the present hath brought
forth new and portentous Villanies, not to be
parallel'd in our own or any other History.
We have been long preparing for some great
Catastrophe. Vice and Villainy have by de∣grees
grown reputable among us. Our Infi∣dels
have passed for fine Gentlemen, and our
venal Traytors for Men of Sense who knew
the World. We have made a jest of Public
Spirit, and cancelled all respect for whatever
our Laws and Religion repute Sacred. The old
<HI>English</HI> modesty is quite worn off, and instead
of blushing for our Crimes, we are ashamed
only of Piety and Virtue. In short, other Na∣tions
have been wicked, but we are the first
who have been wicked upon Principle.</P>
<P>The truth is, our Symptoms are so bad that
notwithstanding all the care and vigilance of
the Legislature, it is to be feared the final Pe∣riod
of our State approaches. Strong Consti∣tutions,
whether politic or natural, do not feel
light disorders. But, when they are sensibly
affected, the Distemper is for the most part
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
violent and of an ill Prognostic. Free Govern∣ments
like our own were planted by the <HI>Goths</HI>
in most parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> And tho' we all know
what they are come to, yet we seem disposed
rather to follow their Example, than to pro∣fit
by it.</P>
<P>Whether it be in the order of things, that
Civil States should have, like natural Products,
their several Periods of Growth, Perfection,
and Decay: or whether it be an Effect, as
seemeth more probable, of humane Folly, that as
Industry produceth Wealth, so Wealth should
produce Vice, and Vice Ruine.</P>
<P>God grant the time be not near, when Po∣sterity
shall say, “This Island was once inha∣bited'
by a Religious, Brave, Sincere People,
of plain uncorrupt Manners, respecting in∣bred
Worth rather than Titles and Appea∣rances,
Asserters of Liberty, Lovers of their
Country, jealous of their own Rights, and
unwilling to infringe the Rights of others;
Improvers of Learning and useful Arts, E∣nemies
to Luxury, tender of other Mens
Lives, and prodigal of their own; inferior in
nothing to the old <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans,</HI> and su∣perior
to each of those People in the Per∣fections
of the other. Such were our An∣cestors
during their Rise and Greatness; but
they degenerated, grew servile Flatterers of
Men in Power, adopted <HI>Epicurean</HI> Notions,
became venal, corrupt, injurious, which drew
upon them the Hatred of God and Man, and
occasioned their final Ruine.”</P>
