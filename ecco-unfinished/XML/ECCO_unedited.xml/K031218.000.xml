<L>Nature with Novelty does still abound;</L>
<L>On every Side fresh Follies may be found.</L>
<L>But then the Taste of every Guest to hit,</L>
<L>To please at once, the Gall'ry, Box, and Pit;</L>
<L>Require's at least—no common Share of Wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Those, who adorn the Orb of higher Life,</L>
<L>Demand the lively Rake, or modish Wife;</L>
<L>Whilst they, who in a lower Circle move,</L>
<L>Yawn at their Wit, and slumber at their Love.</L>
<L>If light, low Mirth employs the comic Scene,</L>
<L>Such Mirth, as drives from vulgar Minds the Spleen;</L>
<L>The polish'd Critic damns the wretched Stuff,</L>
<L>And crys,—"'twill please the Gall'ries well enough."</L>
<L>Such jarring Judgments who can reconcile,</L>

<L>Dismount and bear the Ass—Then what a Noise!—</L>
<L>Huzzas—Loud Laughs, low Gibe, and bitter Joke,</L>
<L>From the yet silent Sire, these Words provoke.</L>
