<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>IS then my friend so much afflicted?</L>
<L>Can Werter be thus chang'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEUTHROP.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas!</L>
<L>So chang'd of late he's scarcely to be known;</L>
<L>Those scenes which once delight'd please no more,</L>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<L>No more he seeks the social joys of life,</L>
<L>But pines in solitude, and ever wastes</L>
<L>The live long day in grief.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Such were my fears.</L>
<L>For every letter breath'd the said reverse:</L>
<L>Can you unfold the cause?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEUTHROP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love is the cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! then I dread the tale—for well I know</L>
<L>How passion sways my friend.—Yet quickly say</L>
<L>Who has engag'd his love?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEUTHROP.</SPEAKER>
<L>One much too fair,</L>
<L>Too rich in virtue's choicest gifts, t' escape</L>
<L>The quick discerning eye of kindred worth:</L>
<L>Her name is Charlotte, Walheim's proudest boast.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And whence arose this passion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEUTHROP.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll tell thee all;</L>
<L>Some few nights past, intreated by a friend,</L>
<L>He went to mingle in a revel here,</L>
<L>The lovely Charlotte graced the ball—her eye</L>
<L>Was fix'd on him alone; too soon he saw</L>
<L>And own'd its power—Thence their passions grew,</L>
<L>And now each sees how much the other loves.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why then lament? Methinks he shou'd be blest</L>
<L>Beyond his utmost hopes.—</L>
</SP>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEUTHROP.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! No, a rival,</L>
<L>A generous rival, stands between his love;</L>
<L>His name is Albert, and his honour sounds</L>
<L>Wherever sounds his name.—His various virtues</L>
<L>Long since endear'd him to Charlotte's friends,</L>
<L>And friendship has supplied the want of love,</L>
<L>For she has yielded to his suit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Heavens!</L>
<L>What scenes of sorrow open to my view;</L>
<L>How can I act?—Has Albert heard this tale?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEUTHROP.</SPEAKER>
<L>No; he is distant hence, and little thinks</L>
<L>How much my master loves; but soon returns</L>
<L>To wed his lovely prize, and then your friend</L>
<L>Must leave for ever what he holds most dear;</L>
<L>Prepare him Heaven for so great a trial.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! poor Werter, oh! 'twas kindly done</L>
<L>To hide this story from thine anxious friends;</L>
<L>Thine own afflictions nobly boded their's.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEUTHROP.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet, when he sees you, he'll unload his heart</L>
<L>And pour his sorrows forth.—I know him well—</L>
<L>Ah! you remember, Sir, the time has been</L>
<L>When Werter was the happiest of his friends;</L>
<L>Alas! how chang'd the scene—forgive my tears—</L>
<L>He has no pang that it not felt by me.</L>

<L>Ha! welcome, my Sebastian!</L>
<L>My heart exults to see my friend again.</L>
<L>O! to what angel do I owe this bliss,</L>
<L>This best of blessings?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou ow'st it to thy grief;</L>
<L>I thought affliction lurk'd in Werter's breast,</L>
<L>And therefore came to prove myself his friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WERTER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Would I could thank thee for thy generous thought,</L>
<L>For Heaven can witness, that I need a friend.</L>
<L>Yes, I've been wretched since we parted last;</L>
<L>Pleasure is driven from her late abode,</L>
<L>And sorrow—ceaseless sorrow—triumphs there.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know the whole, and much lament thy fate;</L>
<L>Yet, Werter—yet there is a way mark'd out</L>

<L>If all that's perfect can be thus forgot;</L>
<L>Why is it Gods, such excellence is made?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why purse a passion then thou know'st was vain?</L>
<L>Reason should shudder at a thought so wild.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WERTER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Reason is banish'd from a lover's mind,</L>
<L>For love admits of no associate there;</L>
<L>Had icy apathy congeal'd my soul,</L>
<L>It must have melted at my Charlotte's looks.</L>
<L>My friend, such looks! as pitying angels give</L>
<L>To dying saints alone,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet, had reason reign'd</L>
<L>'Twou'd place a dismal prospect to thy view,</L>
<L>'Twould tell thee to avoid the gathering storm</L>
<L>That must be fatal, if not quickly shun'd.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>WERTER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh, I am grown so careless of myself,</L>
<L>Nor storms, nor dangers can appal me now;</L>
<L>Place me alone 'midst hot Arabia's sands;</L>
<L>Leave me unclad 'midst freezing Zembla's snow;</L>
<L>Find me where mortal never trod before;</L>
<L>And only tell me that my Charlotte loves,</L>
<L>And hopeless Werter shall be happier far,</L>
<L>Than monarchs glittering on triumphant thrones.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Has love then banish'd honour from thy breast,</L>
<L>Or art thou senseless of the wrongs design'd</L>
<L>The generous Albert! That, that alone</L>
<L>Should check thy boasted transports.</L>
</SP>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WERTER.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, my friend,</L>
<L>Thou'st touch'd the cord that sounds to all my woes—</L>
<L>To that alone I owe my present pangs.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, he begins to soften into reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WERTER.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, had my rival borne a worthless name,</L>
<L>Or us'd deception to obtain his suit,</L>
<L>Or play'd the villain in a single act,</L>
<L>I'd not have yielded, or suffer'd thus;</L>
<L>But Albert is the gentlest, best of men:</L>
<L>Yes, he has shewn such nobleness of mind,</L>
<L>Such truth, such honour, and such generous love,</L>
<L>That by my soul! I'd rather be despis'd</L>
<L>By her I idolize, than injure him,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mysterious heaven! why is a soul so good</L>
<L>Tortur'd with pangs the bad alone should feel?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WERTER.</SPEAKER>
<L>He is so honour'd and esteem'd by all,</L>
<L>That though my rival, he must be my friend.</L>
<L>Yes; I will emulate his noble virtues;</L>
<L>Convince him Werter merits his esteem,</L>
<L>And shew Sebastian that my honour's safe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Werter's himself again! and reason now</L>
<L>With double force returns—Wilt thou forgive</L>
<L>The rash expressions that my harshness dropt?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WERTER.</SPEAKER>
<L>To sue forgiveness is for me, my friend.</L>
<L>My joys, when joy did revel in this breast,</L>
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
<L>Became more dear when shar'd by my Sebastian;</L>
<L>But when his friendship would partake my grief,</L>
<L>I owe him much indeed—and much I fear</L>
<L>I never can requite him.</L>
</SP>

<L>Talk not of love, it has destroy'd my peace:</L>

<L>Yet in this world can I e'er hope for peace?</L>
<L>Peace!—when my Charlotte is another's wife.</L>
<L>E'en now perhaps she languishes away,</L>

<L>Ha! that dread thought works inward on my souls</L>
<L>Like darting poison—and my mad'ning brain</L>

<L>Of horrors! and it calls for horrid deeds—</L>
<L>One of the three must die—that heaven decrees—</L>
<L>Shall it be Albert? shall these yet spotless hands</L>
<L>Shed virtue's blood? and shall the honest fall,</L>

<L>To let the guilty take their happier seats?</L>
<L>O damn'd thought!—I shudder at myself,</L>

<L>Be torn—be mangled—and in Werter's cause?</L>
<L>Oh, cruel! cruel fate!—I'll pause no more—</L>
<L>One thought alone possesses all my soul,</L>

<L>Of that unhappy agitated being,</L>
<L>Who knew no pleasure but in sight of thee!</L>
<L>Oh! when you wander thro' your long-lov'd vale,</L>

<L>Have dew'd the weeping grass!—and if you wish</L>

<L>Look!—towards the church-yard that contains his bones,</L>

<L>IF dreams are ominous, some dreadful woe</L>

<L>For even now opprest with heaviest care,</L>
<L>I sought for comfort in a short repose;</L>

<L>And the pale moon in the blackest clouds was lost,</L>
<L>I wildly wander'd to that dreary vale—</L>
<L>That vale! where Werter first confess'd his love,</L>
<L>And oft in secret sigh'd!—But to my tale—</L>
<L>The light'ning's fire, and moon's few scatter'd rays,</L>
<L>Just shew'd the awful horror of the scene;</L>
<L>Loud roaring waves rush'd o'er the fertile fields,</L>

<L>Urg'd, at the moment, of a secret wish</L>
<L>To gain its summit—in the flood I plung'd!</L>
<L>And driven by the torrent, reach'd its foot—</L>
<L>Loud hollow'd the wind, the tempest still increas'd—</L>
<L>Trembling—sad omen! I began to climb—</L>
<L>And midway saw—oh, horrible to tell!—</L>
<L>An human being, on the highest verge,</L>
<L>With arms outstretch'd, propending o'er the deep—</L>
<L>I scream'd aloud—struck with the sudden noise;</L>
<L>He started—madening I slew to his relief,</L>
<L>And saw with eyes, as frantic as his own—</L>
