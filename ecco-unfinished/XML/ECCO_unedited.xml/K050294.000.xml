<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>NGRATITUDE is by so much the more Criminal, as it lies in every Man's Power, to be, at least, Thankful for Benefits receiv'd, if he has not the Power to return them.</P>
<P>The unmerited Obligations you have laid me under, require my most grateful Acknowledgments; and it is because I despair of ever having the Opportunity to return them in Kind, that I lay hold of this Occasion, in a Publick Manner, to express my Gratitude: And as I know,
<PB REF="4"/>
that it is your Excellence to do Good merely for its <HI>own Sake,</HI> so I am confident, you'll excuse the Boldness of this Address, and receive it, as I intend it (however mean the Present) as the Free-will Offering of a grateful Heart.</P>
<P>It contains a rough, but faithful Re∣lation of the several Dispensations of Pro∣vidence to me, for the Space of almost <HI>4</HI> Years, which were a constant Series of Tryals and Misfortunes; and whatever Faults it may abound with, it has this principal Excellency, which is all I can boast, That it is strictly and faithfully True in every Particular, except what I deliver from the Relations of others, which, however, I have no Reason to doubt, but mention with the more Cau∣tion, as I was not an Eye-Witness of the Veracity of their Relations.</P>
<P>Whatever Pleasure the World may take in the Recital of my Personal Mis∣fortunes and Adventures, at least, I hope, the Description of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, their Product, Manufactures, &amp;c. may be of Use to my Countrymen trading thither; and I wish I had had

Capacity, as well as Opportunity, to scru∣tinize more exactly than I was able to do, into the <HI>Salts, Minerals,</HI> &amp;c. of the seve∣ral Islands: But as I was far from think∣ing to appear in Print (that being owing to a tedious Fit of Sickness, which inca∣pacitated me for any thing else) so had I taken no Notes but what were in confused Scraps of Paper, having no Book to re∣gister them regularly; To which Misfor∣tune is owing a great deal of that indi∣gested Form in which this Treatise ap∣pears. Had I thought of publishing my Ad∣ventures, I had, doubtless, been more curi∣ous and exact; but my Friends would per∣suade me, that I had experienc'd a suffi∣cient Variety of uncommon Events to please the Curious World, and to afford Matter of Instruction for Mariners obliged to sail to those Parts; and, as I said, my Ill∣ness contributing Leisure to their Per∣suasions, I gave into it; and commenc'd, perhaps, no less to your Surprize, than my own, an Author.</P>
<P>You, Sir, will have the Goodness to ex∣cuse all Defects, and I hope the World will not have so much Ill-nature, as to censure

the Performance of a Person whose Pro∣fession and Opportunities have not given him those Advantages which others may boast; but that they will, on the Score of Truth and Faithfulness, pardon the In∣elegance; &amp;c. of this unpolish'd Essay. It is my first Production of this Kind, and 'tis very likely may be the last; And can∣not give me, come what will, any great Dissatisfaction, since, at the same Time, it affords me the Pleasure of acknowledg∣ing your Favours, and to assure you, That it shall always be my Prayers, that God will, for many Years, continue to you the Blessings you at present enjoy, and, at length, translate you to Everlasting Hap∣piness.

<HEAD>A VOYAGE TO THE <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Year of our Lord 1721, on the 14th Day of <HI>September,</HI> I made a Contract with Mr. <HI>Dennis Lang∣tor,</HI> Merchant and Goldsmith, liv∣ing at the <HI>Wheatsheaf</HI> in <HI>Lombard∣street,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Ady,</HI> Packer, living in the House that was Sheriff <HI>Cornish</HI>'s near <HI>Blackwell-Hall-Gate,</HI> and Captain <HI>Andrew Scott,</HI> living then on <HI>Little Tower-Hill,</HI> to go to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and take Possession of a Sloop there call'd the <HI>Dolphin;</HI> and there to buy a Cargo to slave with on the Coast of <HI>Guinea;</HI> and from thence to proceed to <HI>Virginia</HI> or <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> as I found would be most to the Gentlemens Advan∣tage who were concern'd with me; from thence to load or take Freight to <HI>London:</HI> To which the before-mentioned Gentlemen sign'd an Obligation for the Payment of their Dividends, both for Sloop
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
and Cargo; and by their Order I shipp'd a Chi∣rurgeon to go from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Virginia</HI> for half Pay, and from thence to be in whole Pay 'till ar∣rived in the <HI>Thames.</HI> Captain <HI>Andrew Scott</HI> at the same time being Commander of the <HI>King Sa∣gamore,</HI> a Ship of twenty two Guns, and bound from the <HI>Thames,</HI> to touch at the Island of <HI>Ma∣dera,</HI> at the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> Islands, at the Island of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> from thence to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and from <HI>Virginia,</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> &amp;c. And I agreed with Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> by Consent of the other Owners, who were to be concern'd with me in the above-mention'd Sloop and Cargo, to go his Chief Mate in the <HI>King Sagamore,</HI> till we arrived at <HI>Virginia,</HI> and then and there to be discharged, to take Possession of the before-mentioned Sloop; and accordingly I went on Board, as also my Chirurgeon, for whose Passage I contracted to <HI>Virginia;</HI> also the Chest of Me∣dicines was put on Board by the afore-mention'd Gentlemen, to be delivered to me at our Arri∣val in <HI>Virginia.</HI> We proceeded on our Voyage according to Appointment, but in the Channel meeting with contrary Winds, we were oblig'd to put into <HI>Plymouth,</HI> a very commodious Har∣bour for Shipping, lying in the County of <HI>De∣von,</HI> where we were forc'd to lie for a fair Wind near two Months. We happen'd to be there at that time when my Lord <HI>Belhaven</HI> was going Governor to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> in the <HI>Royal Anne</HI> Galley Man of War, who put into this Port a few Days after us; and the Wind shortly after present∣ing fair, tho' the Weather look'd very unsettled, and the Wind not like to stand, the Man of War in which his Lordship was, sailed, and had not been long out before they met with hard and contrary Gales of Wind, which (as was sup∣posed by the Rashness of their Lieutenant) oc∣casion'd
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
that sad Tragedy of their Lives which is not unknown to most People in <HI>England.</HI> Cap∣tain <HI>Scott</HI> was inclinable to sail at the same time that the Man of War did, but I perswaded him to wait a little till he saw the Wind and Weather better settled, at least, not to go out now it was almost Night, and would be Night before we could have got the Ship unmoor'd; and, as I told him, if the Wind continued till next Morn∣ing, then in God's Name to proceed; which Ad∣vice Captain <HI>Scott</HI> took, and the more willing, because he had given Orders the Day before, to kill some Beef for the Voyage, which we could not have till the next Day, which proving but untoward Weather, as well as a foul Wind, obli∣ged us to lie there near a Month after my Lord <HI>Belhaven</HI> sail'd out in the Man of War; during which time we heard from <HI>Falmouth,</HI> that my Lord and almost all the Souls that were in the Man of War, were cast away on the Stagg Rocks off the <HI>Lizard.</HI> After we had lain Wind∣bound a considerable time, it pleased God to send moderate Weather, with an indifferent fair Wind, which Opportunity thus offer'd, we laid hold of, and sail'd, and met with nothing worth no∣ting, 'till we arrived near the Latitude of <HI>Ma∣dera,</HI> at which time Captain <HI>Scott</HI> altering his Mind, or, at least, it was the first Discovery of the altering of his Mind or Owners Orders, he would not touch at <HI>Madera,</HI> but resolv'd to touch at the Island of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> it being one of the <HI>Ca∣nary</HI> Islands, and indeed, for Traffick the best of them; which accordingly we did, and an∣chor'd in the Road of <HI>Oratava,</HI> where Captain <HI>Scott</HI> barter'd some Goods for Wine. We were forced out of the Roads by reason of a <HI>North-West</HI> Wind coming, which all Ships there, when those Winds come, are obliged to do. We
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
slipp'd our Moorings, and put to Sea, leaving Captain <HI>Scott</HI> ashore on the Island, as often hap∣pens to Cammanders of Ships who trade there; for there is no sending the Boat for them, nor waiting for them to come off, for as soon as ever a <HI>North-West</HI> is perceived, which most times is fore-shewed by a <HI>North-West</HI> Swell rouling in, they are oblig'd to slip their Moorings, for which Reason they have always Ship-Buoys ready bent: Seldom, or never, any Ships that are forc'd from thence by these Winds, stay to take up their An∣chors, for if they should, they might run a great Hazard of losing the Ship and their Lives too. But that <HI>North-West</HI> that forced us out, did not prove so bad as we expected; so that the second Day after we slipp'd our Cables, we got into the Road, and took in our Moorings again; and as soon as we got our Wine in, which was about forty Pipes, we sailed, having been about ten Days at this Island; and altho' there are many Things remarkable about and on this Island, not vulgarly known, which might be Matter of Profit as well as Delight to know, (among which may be rank'd the great Coral-Tree, which, perhaps, is the largest of that Kind yet known in the World; also the Gold Mine within Point <HI>de Nagos,</HI> on account of which a poor Man, be∣ing more hasty to get rich than his Neighbours, was taken on one of those golden Mountains, with such Tools or Instruments about him, as plainly shew'd what he had been a hunting for; they found also some Gold about him, for which they hanged him but a few Days before we ar∣rived here;) yet by reason it is an Island pretty much resorted to by our Shipping, I shall wave giving any further Description of it, (only that on these Islands is made the most generous Wine that is made, I think, in the Universe) and left
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
I should seem to some (as the Proverb goes) to light a Candle to see the Day, I shall proceed on in my Narration of our farther Proceedings. We sailed from the Island of <HI>Teneriff</HI> in the Even∣ing with a light Gale of Wind about the <HI>North-East</HI> and by <HI>North,</HI> but after we had got an Offing from the Island, the Gale freshen'd up and continued, we had Sight of the Pike of <HI>Teneriff</HI> (which is a high peeked Mountain, by some sup∣posed to be the highest Mountain in the World) all the next Day, till Night; and altho' we then reckon'd ourselves to be little less than forty Leagues distant from the Pike, yet we could see it very plain. We met with nothing very re∣markable all the Passage, 'till we made the Island of <HI>Sal,</HI> which is one of the Windwardmost of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> Islands, for which Reason I always endeavour'd to make that Island first, when bound to touch at any of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> Islands: We made this Island of <HI>Sal</HI> in the Morning, and I, by the Captain's Order, went ashore with the Pinnace and six Men arm'd, in a Bay call'd <HI>Palmera,</HI> to see what we could observe: At our Landing▪ we found some Huts, which were in good Repair, and seem'd by the Grass which was in them, that some People had lately been there, which made me suspect that there might be some Turtle-catchers here since the last Tur∣tle Season, or they might be Men shipwreck'd, or by other Accidents left there, as by Pirates, &amp;c. After I had gone a little farther towards the Palm-Trees, I saw two Fire-Places, which, by the Freshness of the Ashes, seem'd to have been but lately made; and some Heaps of Fish-Bones lying by the Fire-Places, which were not thoroughly dry; the under Part of them, as also the Middle of the Heap being moist, which I turn'd up on Purpose; these Reasons, I say, far∣ther
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
confirm'd my Opinion that there were some People upon the Island, the Certainty of which I was willing to be satisfied in; for which Cause I divided my Men into two Companies, resolv∣ing, if possible, to discover whether there was any People on the Island, or not: We walk'd and search'd as high up as the Middle of the Island, without discovering any Creature of hu∣mane Kind; we saw abundance of small Land Birds, Asses, &amp;c. And Captain <HI>Scott</HI> fearing that some Accident might have befallen us, made a Signal for us to come on Board, which I did as soon as I could get the Men together. We got on Board about Eight a Clock at Night, and brought off with us some Land-Crabs, Dates, and three or four of the wild bitter Gourds, whereof there is great Plenty there; (with which the Natives in those Islands commonly purge themselves, as we do here, under the Name of <HI>Coloquintidum</HI> or <HI>Alhandal)</HI> these were all we found there that was remarkable, at this Time. As soon as we came on Board, and got the Boat in, we made Sail for the Island of <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> it being the Island resolv'd upon to make a Cargo of Salt, and the next Day we arriv'd at <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> and anchor'd in the <HI>English</HI> Road, as they call it, under the little Island, about ten a Clock at Night, in about five Fathom Water, clear sandy Ground within the sunken Rock.</P>
<P>Next Day I went ashore with Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> to agree with the Inhabitants for their Assistance to bring the Salt from the Salt-Ponds down to the Water-side; as also to settle the Prizes of our Goods, and also of their Horses, Asses, &amp;c. for we were to take in Horses and Asses after we had got our Salt on Board. Captain <HI>Scott</HI> being an utter Stranger to all these Islands, as well as the <HI>Ca∣nary</HI> Islands, both as to their Language and Trade,
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
I was forc'd to be with him, as well on the Trad∣ing Account, as of speaking the <HI>Lingua;</HI> so having settled all Matters relating to our Trading and Business there, we went to work to make our Salt as fast as we could; it being customary in those Voyages for the Ship's Crew to make the Salt for the Cargo themselves, and after it is made, to carry or wheel it out a little Way from the Ponds, to a dry Place, and there to heap it up in large Heaps to drain and dry; from thence the Natives bring it down upon Asses at so much <HI>per diem, per</HI> Ass, and likewise to the Black that drives the Asses; one Black being commonly allow'd to every fifteen Asses, who is employ'd to drive them; every Master of a Ship bespeaking his Asses and Drivers in Proportion to his Company and Craft that he has to ship it off with; for it must not be brought down to the Landing-place any faster than it can be shipp'd off, for if it be, the Sand is so light, and there being commonly in the Day a fresh Breeze of Wind, that the Salt would be blown so full of Sand, that it would spoil your Salt, and make it good for no∣thing, as I have often seen experienc'd, and at several Times by Masters, (both at this Island, and also at the Isle of <HI>May)</HI> who were over-hasty to have their Salt brought down, and not having Hands enough, or their Craft being out of Or∣der, have caused a Sail to be spread on the Sand to lay the Salt upon, and notwithstanding they took all the Care they could to keep it cover'd with another Sail, except when they were a start∣ing the Salt brought down, or carrying down to ship off; yet, I say, notwithstanding all their Care, the Salt was so full of Sand, that they had better a hove it over-board than took it in, for I am per∣swaded it did more Harm to the Sale of their Cargo, than it was worth; but there are some
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
Men think if they can but get their Ship loaden, that's enough. Sometimes when a Ship's Com∣pany is but few, the Masters are forc'd to hire some of the Natives to work in the Salt-Ponds while the Salt is making, and also to work in the shipping the Salt off. I advised Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> as he had brought but little Hay with him out of <HI>England</HI> for his live Cargo, to get the Blacks to bring some down every Day while we were ma∣king the Salt; but he depended on the Blacks Words, who told him, they would supply him with Hay enough in one Day, for his Voyage, which made him think it needless to provide Hay before-hand, tho' I knew to the contrary, as having experience'd them before; but yet, Captain <HI>Scott</HI> depended on their Words, which in the End had like to have been the Loss of all our live Cargo; and as it was, it spoil'd the Sale of them at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> as you will find in the Se∣quel of the Story. No Ship being here but our∣selves, we had all the Salt-Ponds, to pick and chuse the best, and had but little Trouble to make our Salt, to what it is sometimes, as I have seen when Ships have been forc'd to wait three Weeks or a Month for a▪Birth, to make Salt in the Ponds, and then be forc'd to take up with, perhaps, such ordinary Ponds, that ten or a do∣zen Ponds in that poor Ground might not yield much more than one or two Ponds would yield where it is a rich Salt Soil, and yet have as much Labour, in a manner, with those Ponds, as you would have in tending the best Ponds; but we in the making our Cargo, had little more to do but to rake the Salt out of the Ponds, and wheel it out to the Heap. While we lay here, came in a Sloop belonging to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but last from <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> on the Island of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> and bound to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> he hinder'd us almost a
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
Day's Work; for we not knowing but it might be a Pirate, got all our Hands on Board, and so kept ourselves in Readiness to receive him, 'till he sent his Boat on Board, which we commanded, and satisfied us what he was. Now Captain <HI>Scott</HI> having bought more Asses by far than he could stow on Board, and it being all in the Sloop's Way, they agreed, that the Sloop should take in as many Asses as she could stow, at so much <HI>per</HI> Head, to be deliver'd at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> After we got our Salt all on Board, we took in Horses and Asses, as many as we could stow, and also put as many Asses on Board the Sloop as she could stow; after which, we were forc'd to stay twenty-four Hours for Grass and Hay, and then nei∣ther, we could not get half enough for the Voy∣age; but our Water also being almost expended, we could tarry no longer; for you must know, that the Island of <HI>Bona Vist</HI> has no drinking Wa∣ter but what lies a long Way up in the Country, and those Ships that come there only to make Salt, must bring fresh Water enough with them to serve while they are making and shipping off their Salt, or they must pay dear for that Water that must be brought down out of the Country by the Natives, on Asses Backs; but those that come here to buy Cattle, if they do not bring Water with them, it is next kin to an Impossibi∣lity, at least, it would be so chargeable, as well as tedious, to have their Water brought out of the Country, that it would cost more than the Beasts; neither could you ever get a Stock of Water this Way, for your Cattle would drink it, in a man∣ner, as fast as it could be brought down. So ha∣ving got in all that we could get, we and the Sloop sail'd in Company together, and touch'd at the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> where we met with five Sail of
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
Ships loading there with Salt for the <HI>East</HI>-Coun∣try, up the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, among whom we got some Water, and also Tobacco, the Want of which had almost brought a <HI>West</HI>-Country Famine on us, as the Sailors used to term it. We took in six Cows to carry down to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and one was given to Captain <HI>Scott</HI> for Freight. We stay'd one Night at the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and the next Morn∣ing weigh'd for St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which was the Place we design'd to take in Water, Hay, and Wood for the Voyage, the Sloop also being in our Com∣pany. Captain <HI>Scott</HI> being ambitious to keep a∣head of the Sloop, who went very well, as did we in the Ship also, crouded all his small Sails, and would not shorten Sail before we came the Length of the Port of <HI>Villa de Praya,</HI> and it blowing a fresh Gale of Wind, and generally off the high Land, and in the Bay there comes off very hard Flaws of Wind; so that standing with all our Sail out 'till we brought the Bay open, before we could hand our small Sails, and take a Reef in each Top-sail, to Luff into the Bay, we were drove to Leeward of the Road, and it holding such taut Gales, and our Decks being clutter'd with the Cattle, that we could not work the Ship so well as we otherwise might, it was three Days before we could get into the Road; in which Time several of our Asses died, and the rest were so dispirited, that they never recover'd during the Voyage. The Sloop got into <HI>Villa de Praya</HI> the Evening after we came from the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and by the Time that we got into the Bay, he had got all his Water on Board for the Voyage: As soon as we got in, and were moor'd, Captain <HI>Scott</HI> went on Shore to buy Hay and Wood, and to work we went with all our Boats to Water. After we had water'd, wooded, and got as much Hay, green Cocoa-Nuts, &amp;c. for the
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
Cattle, as could be gotten, we unmoored and weighed from thence with the Sloop in Com∣pany, and steered away for the Island of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> meeting with little remarkable in our Passage down, saving that we met with a dead Whale about the middle of the Passage, having an innumera∣ble Quantity of Fowls about it, notwithstanding it could not be less than 300 Leagues from any Land. We had mostly light Winds all the Passage down till we arriv'd at the Island of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which was on the latter Part of <HI>March,</HI> in the Year 1722. The first we did was to get our live Cargo out, which we did as soon as we had Li∣berty from the Governor and Custom-house, but both Horses and Asses were so weak and poor, that none of the Horses, and very few of the Asses, were sold while we lay here; so that if a Coun∣try Genleman had not given Captain <HI>Scott</HI> the feed∣ing of his Horses and Asses in the Country <HI>gratis,</HI> after he saw he could not sell them, the cheapest way would have been to have knock'd them all on the Head, for they would have cost more to have put them in a Market Case than they would sell for: And likewise the Wine did not go off ve∣ry well; for the Inhabitants of this Island, as likewise all our Islands in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> being for the most part used to <HI>Madera</HI> Wine, they did not seem to like so well our <HI>Canary</HI> Wine; nay, most of them were afraid to buy it, think∣ing it was not good, because different in Flavour from that of the Island of <HI>Madera,</HI> their accus∣tomed Wine, though the Wine which we brought, as it cost almost double the Price which Wine com∣monly costs in <HI>Madera,</HI> so it was of twice the Good∣ness of any Wine commonly brought from that Island, tho' it rather sold here under the Price of common <HI>Madera</HI> Wine. These Disappointments in the Cattle, Wine, &amp;c. and some other Rea∣sons which I shall forbear mentioning here, made
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
Captain <HI>Scott</HI> entirely decline, and fully resolve of not proceeding to <HI>Virginia,</HI> notwithstanding the Scheme of the Voyage was to have proceeded there directly from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> as also were his Or∣ders and Instructions from his Owners; however, resolved he was not to go to <HI>Virginia,</HI> but to con∣trive or lay a Scheme to proceed some other Way, which new Resolutions of his, did not only sur∣prize me at the present, but likewise dissatisfied me very much, and I could not resolve with my self what Course to take in this unexpected Disappoint∣ment; but it being in vain to sit unresolved what to do, I at last fix'd my Resolution, which was thus; To make up my Account with Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> and cause him to pay me the Ballance, and so to return home to give the Gentlemen an Account how finely they and I were deluded, they by ha∣ving such a Partner concern'd with them, and I by having such an Owner as Captain <HI>Scott</HI> was. Now you must know that I had lent Captain <HI>Scott</HI> some Money at several Times before our Departure from <HI>London,</HI> to be repay'd me at our Arrival at <HI>Virginia,</HI> which, with the Wages that were due to me on board the <HI>King Sagamore,</HI> came to near Nine∣ty Pounds, which I demanded of him; on which his Answer to me was, That he could not raise that Money at present, by reason he could not dispose of his Effects, but if I thought well of it, he would buy a Sloop in his own Name, for which he could have Credit on his Effects till they were sold, and would make a Bill of Sale to me, to hold a Part in the Sloop proportionable to the Debt; and I considering how difficult it would be for me to recover my Money of him there, if not impossible, resolv'd to accept of his Offer; for tho' he was reputed at <HI>London</HI> to have considerable Effects in <HI>Maryland,</HI> yet when I came to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> I understood by some Masters of

Vessels that came from, and belonged to the Place where he pretended his Effects lay, that he was so far from having any Effects there, that it was the Reverse; for they believed that he was so much in Debt there, that they thought for that Reason he did not much care to come there; wherefore I was after a sort, as it were, necessitated to accept of his Proposals, for fear of entirely losing my Mo∣ney; tho' I believe I had obliged my Friends more, and especially those Gentlemen who were to be concern'd with me, had we proceeded to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and I am sure done my self more Service to have run the Hazard of losing my Money, and come home; as the Sequel hath fully made manifest.</P>
<P>Accordingly we pitch'd upon a Sloop that was to be sold there; I forget the Gentleman's Name at present that own'd her, neither is it much ma∣terial. She was then call'd the <HI>Margaret,</HI> and the then Master's Name was <HI>Alexander Fisher;</HI> she was about 60 Tun of Cask, indifferently well found for those Parts, and by the Register she was be∣tween 4 and 5 Years old, and was an extraordi∣nary Penny-worth. I was discharg'd by Captain <HI>Scott</HI> from the <HI>King Sagamore April</HI> the 24th, 1722, and the same Day took Possession of the Sloop; and being oblig'd to register her anew, the old Register Certificate being pretty much torn, and the Property now altered, accordingly a new Register Certificate was taken out in Captain <HI>Scott</HI>'s Name, and also that of Mr. <HI>George Johnson,</HI> a Mer∣chant who then lived at <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> after which, I shipped Hands and began to get things ready as fast as I could; but found Captain <HI>Scott</HI> very backward to furnish me with Money towards the fitting of her out, or for a Cargo; however I made shift to rubalong, and what I could not have of Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> I pieced out with the little Mo∣ney I raised there. I often asked him to come
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
to an Account, that we might settle our Affairs; but he still put me off from time to time with one Excuse or another: However we concluded and agreed uponthe Voyage which was for me to go to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and thence to the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands to trade, or only to the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, as I thought proper; but the Cargo was all that re∣main'd in Dispute: However Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> did put in a small Quota namely 30 Bushels of Maiz, 4 Hogsheads of Rum, and then he fell sick, and got up in the Country: However I made shift as well as I could, and had some Corn, Rice, Flower, &amp;c. put on board of me by some Gentlemen who rather than I should be baulk'd, were resolved to venture with me; and I was to make them such Returns, if I succeeded, as I thought might be reasonable. I likewise purchased what Rum I was able, as also Sugar, Tobacco, &amp;c. and in short, one way or another, I got together a pretty Car∣go, sufficient to have answered my Design, if it had pleased God that I had escaped the Pirates; as in the Sequel of the Story you shall hear.</P>
<P>By this time Captain <HI>Scott</HI>'s Ship was ready for sailing, and he understanding what Goods I had on board, offered to barter some of his Goods that would answer at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> in lieu of some of my Goods which would answer where he was intend∣ed to go; provided I would alter my Voyage and go to the <HI>Canaries,</HI> which I did not approve of, and so there was no more said on that Head. We were both ready to sail, and I urged him to come to an Account, which he said was then impossible; but as we had agreed to keep Company together till we came in the Latitude of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, so we should have time enough to settle before we parted; and abundance of such like Discourses: Besides he said, he could not yet hold a Pen in his Hand by means of his late Sickness.
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
Having no other Remedy, I was forc'd to acquiesce, he promising me, to make me a Bill of Sale not only in Proportion to the Debt he owed me, but, if I had a Mind, he would make me an Assign∣ment of the whole Bill of Sale, and pay him when I thought fit.</P>
<P>So we concluded to sail together the next Day, which accordingly we did, being about the mid∣dle of <HI>July</HI> 1722, and were to keep Company together till we arrived in the Latitude of the <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> Islands, which I was desirous of, on two Accounts; first, that I might have an Opportunity of settling Accounts between us, and also to have a Consignment made over to me of a Part of the Sloop in Proportion to the Debt, which would have been for Half the Sloop at least. The other Reason was, I was apprehen∣sive of some Pirates which we had an Account of at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> that lay lurking about the <HI>Cari∣bees.</HI></P>
<P>We had a fresh Trade-Wind, considering the Time of Year, about the North-East and by North, with some Squalls of Wind and Rain; I was indis∣posed before I sailed from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> with a Deje∣ction of the Spirits, Faintness, and Want of Appe∣tite, which might be occasion'd by my fretting and vexing at my Disappointments. I had the Advice of some Gentlemen of the Faculty of Physick there, who ordered me what they thought proper, and withal told me, as I also believed and hoped, that the fresh Air of the Sea would carry off my Indis∣position.</P>
<P>The <HI>King Sagamore</HI> and I kept Company three Days; and about half an Hour past 6 in the Even∣ing the third Day, came on a taut Squall of Wind and Rain which split my Main-sail at the Head, insomuch that I was forc'd to lower it down; and the Ship keeping on her Way, I lost Sight of her
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
in that Squall, which continued 'till duskish. We were then got clear of the Islands, and Captain <HI>Scott,</HI> as I suppose, concluded that he was clear of the Pirates, which we had had an Account of at <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> which, with some other Reasons, I believe, might be the Cause why he did not shorten Sail for me when my Main-sail split, but made the best of his Way; neither was I much concern'd then, not doubting but I should meet with him at some of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> Islands, where he design'd to Trade, and, as I suppos'd, might be another Reason of his making the best of his Way to get to the Islands before me; for he knew that I had Goods in for these Islands, tho' my Design was, if Winds and Weather permit∣ted, to touch on the Windward Part of the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> about the <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> before I came to the Islands, and did not much doubt but to have been at the Islands time enough to have done my Business with Captain <HI>Scott</HI> before he left the Islands; my Sloop sailing much better than his Ship, especially on a Wind, which, in crossing the Trade, is a great Advantage: But my Illness encreased after I came out to Sea, which was contrary to what I expected, as well as to the Opinion of the Doctors; insomuch, that after struggling with it as much and as long as I could, I was at last forc'd to keep my Bed ten Days with a Fever, accompanied with exces∣sive cold, clammy Sweats, with Faintings; after which, growing better, as soon as I was able to keep an Account of the Vessel's Way, I demand∣ed of my Mate the Latitude and Longitude we we were got into by his Account, which he gave me; which, upon Perusal, made me conjecture that we were not got so far to the <HI>Eastward</HI> as his Account made out; wherefore I requir'd his Log-Book, to see how far that might agree with
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
his general Account; for sometimes the best of Men may make a Mistake, either in transcribing their Day's Work, by misplacing of a Figure, or even by an Error or Mistake in the Working; all these Mistakes a Man may be overtaken with, and any one of them may lead one so far out of the Truth, as may not only be a Disappointment to his Expectation, but of evil Consequence to Ship, Cargo, and even our very Lives; by which it is easy to guess, how careful and circumspect that Man ought to be, that takes upon him the Charge of navigating a Ship at Sea, when the only misplacing of one Figure, may put the Ship and Cargo in danger of being lost, as well as the Lives of all those who at the same Time are on Board.</P>
<P>I took the Pains to work every Day's Work apart, and made Allowance, as usual, for what I found Diurnally noted in his Logg-Book; which although it be not so exact as a Man could account for, were he Daily to observe the several Occurrences as they then happen, and allow for, and rectify according to his Judgment, while they are fresh in Mind; yet it is something more satis∣factory, than to take a general and summed up Account; as any Man who has had the Expe∣rience of keeping an Account of a Ship's Way, can easily perceive: There were about 14 Leagues Difference between what I made out, as I took it out of his Logg-Book, and the general Account he first gave me, he being so much to the East∣ward of what he made out by his Logg-Book; which farther confirmed me in my Opinion, that we were not so far to the Eastward, as he reckon'd we were.</P>
<P>We had light Gales, and sometimes Calms, after we were got to the Northward of the Trade, with heavy Showers of Rain, which is usual a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
that Time of the Year in these Latitudes; we stood as far to the Northward as 31 Degrees of Latitude, and then I bent my Course Souther∣ly, and to the Eastward withal, till we got into the Trade again: My Suspicion, as I observ'd to you before, that we were not so far to the East∣ward as our Reckoning made us, caused me to run about 80 Leagues to the Eastward of the Me∣ridian of the Islands, before I came into the Latitude of them, and the Winds after we got into the Trade, holding from the East to the East-South-East, I could not possibly, without losing a great deal of Time, get hold of the Coast of <HI>Guiney,</HI> so far to windward as I had at first resolved; therefore, I concluded to run di∣rectly for the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> Islands, and design∣ing to make the Isle of <HI>Sal</HI> first, it being the Windwardmost of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> Islands, I stretched to the Southward till I got into the Latitude of it, and then, by our Account, we were between 60 and 70 Leagues to the East∣ward of it; but my Mate was very positive, that the Vessel was considerably farther to the East∣ward than our Reckoning made her. After we were in the Latitude, I run down West by Day, and lay to by Night; for though I had a good Observation two or three Times every 24 Hours by the Stars, and sometimes a Meridian Obser∣vation by the Sun, yet I would not venture to run in the Night, for fear of missing the Island, by reason the Weather was sometimes hazy, sometimes overcast, and a taut Gale of Wind from the East-South-East, to the South-East, and South-South-East. I run down about 100 Leagues West, without making any of the Islands; and then concluding, as good Reason I had, that we were to the Westward of the Islands, I had no other Remedy lest, but to stand to the North∣ward
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
again, till out of the Trade, to get into a variable Wind's way, and so to get to the East∣ward, and that Way to gain the Islands; for the Time of the Rains being almost come, I did not much care then for touching on the Coast of <HI>Guiney,</HI> as I had before proposed; so made the best of my Way for the Islands, which by the Ig∣norance or Carelesness, or both, of my Mate, we had missed. I stood to the Northward with a very hard Gale of Wind at South-South-East, with Rain and a very deep hollow Sea, which held for about four Days; after which the Wea∣ther being more moderate, I stood to 31 Degrees 30 Minutes of North Latitude, and then run my Easting out, and so bent my Course to the South∣ward, till we got into the Latitude of the Isle of <HI>Sal</HI> again, without meeting with any Thing worth noting here: I then bore away West till we made the Island, and it being green Trutle Season, I stretched in, and anchored in a Road under the West-side of the Island called <HI>Palmera,</HI> I suppose so called, from the Date-trees growing there, in the Valley in the Southermost Bay. The Road of <HI>Palmera</HI> in some Places is very foul and rocky, but if you turn up into the Northermost Bay, you may anchor there in three or four fathom Water, in clear sandy Ground; and with∣out that Depth, it is all foul and rocky Ground. You may likewise anchor in the Southwardmost Bay, in four, five, or six fathom Water, bring∣ing the Palm-trees East-and-by-North from you; but without those Depths it is uncertain Ground, in some Places clear, in others foul.</P>
<P>After we came to an Anchor I sent my Boat ashore, to see if there were any Signs of the Turtle landing, or if any People were there a Turtling, and if so, and they had any fresh caught, to bring one on Board; for the <HI>French</HI> often∣times
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
come there to make a Turtle-Voyage, salt∣ing their Turtle on the Shore, and drying it, much after the same Manner as they do Cod at <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> of which and the Oil, they make good Markets at their Islands in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> they saving the Shell for the <HI>French</HI> Market, where it generally yields a better Price than with us in <HI>England,</HI> especially the Shell of that Turtle caught about these Islands, which is of the thinnest Sort, and extraordinary clear, as well as finely clouded; besides, there are oftentimes found greater Quantities of Ambergreese at this Island, than at any of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> Islands, and were it not for the wild Cats that eat it (as also does the green Turtle) there would be much more found than there is.</P>
<P>In about two Hours after the Boat went ashore, she came off, and brought a green Turtle which might weigh, I believe, between Two and Three hundred Weight, and also a Black, being a Native of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s Island, who told me, that his Companions ashore sent me that Turtle which the Boat brought off, as a Present; and that there were about 60 Persons Natives of the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who were brought hither in a Sloop belonging to a Place, the Name of which he could not remember. I ask'd him if he was an <HI>Englishman?</HI> and he told me Yes; so I named several Places in <HI>England,</HI> but he still said No; till at last, among other Places, I named <HI>Ber∣mudas,</HI> and then he said he was a <HI>Bermudian.</HI> I asked him, If he was sure of it? and he said Yes, he was certain that the Master told him he be∣longed to <HI>Bermudas,</HI> and that he brought them from S. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s hither, to catch and cure Turtle, and that about 10 Weeks ago he sailed from hence, and told the Blacks he would go to <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> and take in some Salt, and then stretch over to
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to take in some Provisions for them, and promised them, without fail, to be with them in 10 Days at farthest; but they had heard no∣thing of him since, and therefore they had given him over, and believed that he was either lost, or had alter'd his Mind, and was gone some other Voyage, and offered me half their Turtle, Oil, Shell, Ambergreese, &amp;c. to transport them with the other half to the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> I told him I was bound down to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and if any of them had a Mind to go, I would give them their Passage for nothing; but I likewise told him, I would carry none of the Effects off the Island, until I knew the Right of the Matter, which I supposed I might when I arrived at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and according as I found how it was, I did not know but I might come back again to the Isle of <HI>Sal.</HI> He desired me to let the Boat put him ashore, that he might go and tell his Companions, which accordingly I did, and gave him two Bot∣tles of Rum, and his Hat full of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, to drink and eat with his Companions, when he came on Shore: He was very thankful; and I ordered the Boat to put ashore, which accord∣ingly was done: And in about an Hour's time it came off again, and brought an Old Man and a Woman, who begged that I would give them their Passage to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> adding, that they had nothing to pay me for it, but the Turtle, Oil, and Shell which they had made here, and if I pleased to accept of that, they would freely give all that they had, rather than to stay here; for they said they were almost starved, having no∣thing to eat but the Fish that they catched. I told them I would consider of it, and it being al∣most Night, I sent them ashore, and told them I would come ashore in the Morning and talk with them.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="28"/>
Next Morning I went ashore, and they all came about me that were in the Bay, which were eight Men and two Women, one of them having a young Child; for when they began to be out of hopes of the Sloop's coming again, they sepa∣rated into Companies, and each Company went to a several Bay, for the greater Conveniency of living; for were they all to stay in one Place, they could not so well supply their Wants, all their Food being then what Fish they daily catched. There being, as I observed before, 11 Souls at this Bay of <HI>Palmera,</HI> they begg'd that I would give them a Passage to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and they would give me all their Shell, Oil, and part of their dry'd Turtle, to carry them and the other Part of their dry'd Turtle, to St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> I answer'd, as the Day before, that I would meddle with none of the Goods till I had been at St. <HI>Ni∣cholas,</HI> to understand the Right of the Story; and if in case that the Sloop which brought them hither was gone, or had come to any Disaster, as it was very likely, we should hear something of it there, and they need not much fear, but that I should come up again to the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> and carry them down to St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> but then I should expect as they had offered me now; to wit, all the Turtle, Oil, Turtle-shell, and half the dry'd Turtle. They said, they were sure every-body would be very glad to agree to that now, without giving myself any farther Trouble. But I not know∣ing upon what Terms they were sent there, and what might be the Reason of the Sloop's tarrying so long, and not being willing to disappoint any Man, not knowing what Charges the Man might have been at in relation to them, and the little Credit that is to be given to any Thing that those Blacks say, made me resolve not to meddle with any Thing till I heard farther of the Business; and so
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
I told them, if any of them wanted to go down to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> I would carry them for nothing, but would not carry off any of the Effects; and that I was re∣solved to sail that Evening: upon which they told me, that they should not have Time to send to their Comrades who were in the other Bays; but if I pleased to give them their Passage, and Liberty to carry a little dry'd Turtle with them for Food, they should be very thankful: Which I granted, and so six Men and the two Women, and a little Child, agreed to go, and two Old Men stayed on the Island, and promised to send the rest Word as soon as they could, of what had happened, and the great Likelihood of their good Fortune to get Home in a short Time, &amp;c. I ordered those who designed to go with me to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to get themselves ready, and also to bring the Turtle they designed to carry with them for the Voyage, down to the Water-side, that it might be put on board: This they readily com∣ply'd with, and brought down as much as the Boat could carry at twice, which I ordered on board, and they would have brought more, but I would not permit them; So on board I came, and brought off with me a live green Turtle, which the Blacks had catched the Night before; and after Dinner I sent my Boat ashore to bring them off, which they immediately did to the Number of six Men, two Women, and a sucking Infant. About 7 a Clock in the Afternoon we weighed from <HI>Palmera,</HI> and steer'd away for the Island of St. <HI>Ni∣cholas;</HI> and after we got clear from under the Lee of the Land, which might be about 10 a Clock at Night, we had a pleasant fresh Gale, and by Day-dawning we were off of the East-Point of the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> but after we got under the Lee of the Island, it being high steep Land, with a great many deep Gullies, we met with such hard
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
Squalls of Wind coming down those Gullies, that it was 9 at Night before I could get to an An∣chor; which I did in a Road at the West-End of the Island, called <HI>Trefall Road,</HI> in about 6 Fathom Water.</P>
<P>Next Morning the Priest, who was a Native of <HI>Portugal,</HI> came down from their Town, and I sent the Boat ashore for him: Who told me, when he came on board, That he had sent the Sloop to the Isle of <HI>Sal</HI> with the Blacks; and that the Sloop was all his own, he having bought her from the Master, whose Name was <HI>James Peer,</HI> living at <HI>Bristol;</HI> and that he had sent her to the Isle of <HI>Sal</HI> with the Blacks to make Turtle, some of which were his own Slaves, the rest being hired, some at two Dollars, some three, and other some at four Dollars <HI>per</HI> Month; and that all the Turtle, Oil, Shell, &amp;c. that they had made, was intirely his; and that his Sloop had been here at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> since she came last from the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> and he had sent her to trade at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and the other Islands to the Leeward, and that she was to be back again in three Weeks or a Month at farthest: That it was now almost 3 Months since he sent her away, and, therefore, was afraid she was come to some Accident, or else blown off from the Islands, they having had two or three <HI>Travadoes</HI> since she went. He also offered to freight me to the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> to bring off the Effects and Men, the Turtle Season being in a manner over, and their remaining upon that Island, being now only an Expence to him, without any farther View of making much more Profit this Season. He added, that he did not much fear his Sloop's being safe; but as it might possibly be some time before she could arrive to transport his People from the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> he would gladly agree on reasonable Terms to freight me thither;
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
and if not, he must e'en wait the coming of his own Sloop. I told him, if I undertook the Mat∣ter, I would not be unreasonable; but as yet I was not resolv'd whether to go to the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> or not; but was designed in the Evening, or the next Morning, if the Weather proved moderate, to weigh my Anchor, and turn up into <HI>Paragheesi Road,</HI> and then I would resolve him.</P>
<P>Now the Blacks which I had brought from the Isle of <HI>Sal</HI> told me, that the Island of St. <HI>Nicho∣las,</HI> as also all the Windward Islands of the Cape <HI>de Verd,</HI> were in great Want of Povisions; and that the Famine had raged so at this Island, in particu∣lar, that within the last 12 Months, there died no less than 500 Souls purely for want of Food, the Famine having been for several Years past at the other Windward Islands; but altho' St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> had groaned under it but one Year, yet it was visited the severest of all the Islands during the Time that it held. Now this was the Reason why I re∣solved for <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> because it was nigher their Town, and for the most part a level Way (which is very rare in those Islands, they being generally very steep and rocky) my Intent being to truck or barter away some of my Corn, Rice, &amp;c. with the Inhabitants, in Exchange for Cot∣ton-Cloths (such as we trade with on the Coast of <HI>Guiney,</HI> called by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and from them by the <HI>Blacks, Barrafools)</HI> likewise for Ambergreese, Dragons-blood, Money, &amp;c. the Road of <HI>Trefall</HI> where I lay, not being so convenient for Trading, by reason of its Distance from the Town, which was about 16 or 18 Miles, and that being a rocky Way, with very high and steep Ascents and Descents.</P>
<P>The Priest went ashore in the Afternoon, as also did some of the Blacks which I brought from the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> and went up to Town; and under∣standing
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
that I designed for <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> they de∣sired that I would let their Turtle remain on board till the Vessel came there, which I did.</P>
<P>Next Morning I weighed from <HI>Trefall,</HI> and got up to <HI>Paragheesi</HI> about 9 a Clock that Forenoon, and Anchored in the <HI>Old Road</HI> in 6 fathom Water; the Reason why I did not go into <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> was, be∣cause the Blacks I had on Board, informed me, that if I went in there (it being a little narrow Gut be∣tween 2 Rocky Points; and tho' there was Water enough for any Ship, insomuch that Vessels might moor close to the Rock with one Anchor off, and might even moor by Shore-fasts without any Anchor out, yet it lying so close to the Rock, that you might step from that on board, and from on board to Shore) I should be so pester'd with the Inhabitants, when they came to hear I had Provi∣sions to sell, that I should never be able keep my Vessel clear of them; and, perhaps, the greatest Number of them that would flock on board, would be poor, and unable to do any Thing but beg or steal; whereas, as I lay off at an Anchor, there could none come on Board but such as I thought fit to bring off in my Boat, and then I need not be troubled with any, but those who brought something with them to trade.</P>
<P>I approved and made use of their Advice; however, few or none came down besides the Priest, and those who waited upon him, or were his Followers; whether it was because I did not moor in the Harbour, or that the Priest prevented them, for fear it should hinder my agreeing with him to go to the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> I am not able to de∣termine; however, I was willing to lay hold of the Frieght offered, for fear his Sloop should come, being satisfied I should have Time enough to make my Market at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> after my Re∣turn from the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> which would not take
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
up above a Week's time if no Accident happened: besides I did not fear any Vessel coming with Provisions to spoil my Market, by reason it was the wrong Time of the Year, being the Season for shifting Winds, and Capt. <HI>Scott,</HI> as I heard, had been there about 10 Days before my Arrival, but could supply them but with very little Provisions, which was the only Thing they then wanted; and that Captain <HI>Scott</HI> was gone to <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> and so from thence to trade among the Leeward Islands. So the Priest and I agreed for me to sail to the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> and bring off all the People and Effects that belonged to him, or on his Ac∣count, and he was to pay me 100 Dollars, and a lusty stout sound Man Slave, about 30 Years of Age; to be paid and delivered at our Return to the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> before any of the Ef∣fects brought from the Isle of <HI>Sal</HI> were landed; the Priest also engaging himself to go along with me, to make the better Dispatch in embarquing the Goods from that Island.</P>
<P>So I concluded to weigh Anchor from <HI>Para∣gheesi</HI> next Morning, and turn up to <HI>Currisal,</HI> a Road lying on the South-East side of the Island, being very commodious for Watering; the fresh Water running down to the Sea; where I re∣solved to recruit my Store of Water and Wood, which was almost spent; the Priest promising to meet me there the next Morning, with some Blacks to assist my Men in that Work. Accordingly next Morning I weighed before Day, and got up and Anchored in <HI>Currisal Road</HI> before Noon; where, according to Promise, the Priest met me with four Blacks. We were not long a Watering, the Water being, as I observed so nigh the Seaside; but the Wood was a long Way to fetch, and over steep Rocks, so that if it had not been for the Blacks Assistance, I believe my own Men would
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
not have been able to have found it, or to get it down when found. The last Turn of Wood we got on board about 11 a Clock at Night, and it proving Calm in the Road, I could not weigh An∣chor that Night as I designed. The Priest, with his 4 Blacks, being Sea-sick, lay ashore on the Sand all Night according to their Desire; and if I saw an Opportunity of weighing, I was to send the Boat for them. He had sent some other Blacks while we were Wooding and Watering, to hunt for wild Goats, who brought in two, whereof he sent me one on board.</P>
<P>Next Morning, about Dawning, as it was my usual Custom, I turned out, it continuing still Calm; and as the Day broke out, looking about, I espy'd three Sail of Ships off the Bay, one Ship to the Eastward, another Ship to the Westward, and the Third right off the Middle of the Bay; the first of them that I made plain with my Glass was the Eastwardmost Ship, which seemed to be a full-built and loaden Ship, and I took the rest to be the same, and of her Company, and imagin'd that, perhaps, they might want Water, &amp;c▪ They had but very little Wind in the Offing, and it continued still Calm in the Bay. I saw them bring to, then edge away, but could not perceive any Signals made by them; and seeing them act thus, I still continued in my first Opinion, that they wanted to touch at the Island for Wood, Water, &amp;c. but that, perhaps, they might be unac∣quainted with the Roads or Harbours of the Island; insomuch that I was almost of the Mind to send my Mate off with the Boat to conduct them in.</P>
<P>As soon as the Day broke up clear, that they made me, the Middlemost of the three stood right in for me, and as the Sun rose, the Wind freshened and backed more to the Eastward, as is
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
usual there after calm Nights. As she drew nigh∣er, I made her with my Glass to be a Scooner, and full of Hands, all in their white Shirts, and likewise I saw a whole Tier of Great Guns; and then, indeed, I began to suspect what they were: But I had no Remedy but patiently to wait the Event, for I could do nothing, except I put the Vessel ashore, which would have been meer Madness to have done, altho' I had been sure they were Pirates; and I was so surrounded by them, that there was no Possibility of escaping from them, and especially, it holding calm within the Bay; and they coming in with the Day-Breeze, came in as fast as the Wind. He came in under an <HI>English</HI> Ensign, Jack, and Pendant, and as soon as I perceiv'd his Colours, I hoisted my Ensign; he had eight Guns, and six Patte∣reroes, and seventy Men. He stretch'd a-head of us, and haled us; I answer'd him: He ask'd, <HI>Where the Sloop belong'd to?</HI> I answer'd, <HI>To</HI> Lon∣don. He ask'd, <HI>From whence we came?</HI> I told him, <HI>From</HI> Barbadoes. He said, <HI>It was very well; he knew that;</HI> and so brought to a-head of us, and bid me send my Boat on Board of him; which accordingly I did, with two Hands in her, and I my self kept walking on the Deck. The Captain of the Scooner, whose Name was <HI>John Lopez,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese</HI> (as I was told after∣wards; but then went by the Name of <HI>John Rus∣sel,</HI> pretending, tho' falsely, that he was born in the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts of <HI>England)</HI> ask'd the People who came on Board of him with the Boat, <HI>Where the Master of the Sloop was?</HI> who answer'd, <HI>That he was on Board, and sent them with the Boat to know what they wanted.</HI> He ask'd them, <HI>Which was the Master of the Sloop?</HI> So they shew'd me to him as I was walking the Sloop's Deck, and then he immediately call'd to me, saying, <HI>You</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
<HI>Dog! you Son of a B—! you speckled-Shirt Dog!</HI> (for I had a speckled Holland Shirt on, and was Slip-shoe'd, and without Stockings, being just as I turn'd out of my Cabin) So he still continued calling in that Manner, and I considering what Hands I was fallen into, and that it would be easie for them to send a Ball through me for my Silence, which, perhaps, they might deem Con∣tempt of them, as indeed it was, I thought it was the safest and wisest Course, to answer, ac∣cording to the Proverb, <HI>When your Hand is in the Lion's Mouth, get it out as easie as you can,</HI> and not, in the least, to seem to resent any thing that they said, or did to me, but endeavour to submit, if not with a willing Mind, yet with a seeming Patience, as, in truth, I could do no otherwise, except I would, with a foolish Rashness, provoke them to be my Executioners; and, God knows, a small Provocation, nay, if they do but conceit it so, will occasion the taking any honest Man's Life away. So I answer'd him, <HI>Ho lo:</HI> He said, <HI>You Dog, you, why did not you come on Board with the Boat, you Son of a B—? I will drub you, you Dog, within an Inch of your Life, and that Inch too.</HI> I made him Answer, <HI>That he only com∣manding the Boat on Board, I did not think he re∣quired me; but if he pleased to send the Boat, I would come and wait upon him on Board.</HI> He an∣swer'd, <HI>Ay, you Dog, and I will teach you better Manners.</HI> Upon this, he order'd some of the Pirates into my Boat, to fetch me, as also eight or ten more of them, to take Possession of the Sloop mean while; which accordingly was done, and I came along Side of the Scooner. The Captain of her still continued to threaten me with drubbing, <HI>to teach me better Manners than so to affront him.</HI> I answer'd, <HI>I did not design to af∣front him, or any of the Company. D—u you, you</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
<HI>Dog,</HI> said he, <HI>do not stand there to chatter; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome on Board.</HI> So up the Side I came, this glib∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongu'd Captain standing at the Entring-place, with his Cutlash ready drawn in his Hand, to receive me. The least I expected was a sound drubbing Bout, and I had abundance of Reason to apprehend even worse than that, he still con∣tinuing to threaten what he would do to me when I came in: But a Man in a Gold Laced Hat, whom afterwards I understood to be the Gunner, looked over the Side, as I was coming up, and said, <HI>Come up, Master, you shall not he abused.</HI> After I got in, the Captain up with his Cutlash, as tho' he was going to cleave me down, and said, <HI>You Dog, you, what was the Reason you did not come on board when the Boat first came? What do you think you deserve?</HI> I answered, <HI>If I had done amiss, it was through Ignorance, and for want of knowing better; and hoped that he would excuse this my Fault, I not knowing who or what they were.</HI> Then he rapped out an Oath, with a <HI>Damn you, you Dog, what, or who do you think we are?</HI> I paused a while, not well knowing what Answer to make, for fear of offending them again; for one displeasing Word is as much as the best Man in the World's Life is worth, while in their Clutches. How∣ever, after a little Pause, I told him, <HI>I believed they were Gentlemen of Fortune belonging to the Sec.</HI> At which he answered and said, <HI>You lie by G—, we are Pirates, by G—.</HI> Then I answered again, and said, <HI>Well, Gentlemen, now I know who you are, but not before, and am sorry I have not carried myself as I should;</HI> but, as I had told them before, I said, <HI>It was my Ignorance, never having been taken by such Gentlemen as they before, and, therefore, did not know the Way of behaving myself to them, as they might have expected, had I been acquainted with their Ways or Customs;</HI> (tho'
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
I had been once taken by Pirates before, coming from <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> when I was a Youth, but I did not then think it proper to take notice of it to them, but the Reverse; and thought it the safest Course at present, to pretend Ignorance, as the only Way to appease his unmerited, though dan∣gerous and threatning Wrath.) So after he had hectored and bounced thus a while, he asked me, in a gaming Way, <HI>Why I had not put on my best Cloaths, when I came a visiting such Gentlemen as they were?</HI> I told him, <HI>That that was the com∣mon Dress which I wore on Board my own Vessel in a Morning, and did not know that I should have paid a Visit to such Gentlemen as they were, when I dressed myself. Besides, when he called me to come on Board of him, he threatned me so, that I came from on board my own Vessel as it were in a Fright, that made me have but very little Thought, or Stomach either, to change my present Dress; but if he pleased to let me go on board the Sloop, and grant me the Liberty, it would not be too late yet, to dress myself in better Cloaths. No, damn you,</HI> said he, <HI>now it is too late: What Cloaths we took you in, you shall keep: But your Sloop, and what is in her, is ours.</HI> I told him, <HI>I perceived it was, but still hoped, as I wholly lay at his Mercy, he would be so generous as to take only what they had Occasion for, and leave me the rest.</HI> He answered, <HI>As to that, he could say nothing as yet, that being a Com∣pany-business to decide;</HI> and withal demanded of me, an Account of every Thing that was on board of the Sloop, particularly of the Cargo, and what Money I had, or knew to be on board; and if I did not give a true and exact Account, and discover to him every Thing; and if upon their Rummaging, they found the least Thing on board which I did not discover, they would set the Sloop on fire, and me in her. He added, That he
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
had a full Account of what Cargo I brought out from <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> and, therefore, if I had touch'd any where, and disposed of any of it, I must not conceal the Money; for if I did, I should fare the worse. All the rest of the <HI>Johns</HI> that were standing by, in a seeming friendly Manner, told me, that it would be much better for me, to make a full and true Discovery of every Thing, especially of Money, Arms, and Ammunition, which, as they said, were the principal Things they sought after; for it was their Manner to punish Liars and Concealers, especially of those Things they had now mention'd, in a very se∣vere Manner. I told them, I would give them an Account of every Thing on board, as exact as my Memory would suffer me, which accord∣ingly I then did; and withal told them, That if I failed in giving them an exact Account of every Thing, that it was not with a Design to conceal any Thing from them, but meerly the Fault of my Memory, for which, if any hap∣pened, I hoped they would excuse me, and not punish me, as culpable for that, which was not a wilful or designed Omission. <HI>But,</HI> said I, <HI>if you please, Gentlemen, to give me Liberty to go on board of the Sloop for my Papers, and to peruse them, I shall then be able to give you a very exact Inventory, I think, I may say of every Thing on board, except what properly belonged to my Men.</HI> But Captain <HI>Russel</HI> told me <HI>No, and as for my Papers, be would take Care of them, and if any Thing was found on board, more than I had given an Account of, I must stand clear.</HI></P>
<P>All this while the Pirates were Rommaging on board the Sloop, which, when they had done. I suppose, as much as they thought fit, some of them came on board, with an Account of what they had found or seen there, which was nothing
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
more than what I had told them of before, saving a Ring, and my silver Buckles, which really I had forgotten, otherwise I should have mention'd them: However, they were so gene∣rous as to keep them.</P>
<P><HI>By this Time the Priests and the Blacks, mis∣trusting how the Game went, were got a pretty Way up the Rocks, in order to escape into the Mountains, which the Pirates observing, Captain</HI> Russel <HI>asked me,</HI> If I knew who those People were? <HI>I not knowing but the same Question might have been asked of some of my People, and that, perhaps, they might have told them, and not being willing, and, indeed, I may say, not daring, to be caught in a Lye, ingenuously told them the Truth, and said,</HI> They were the Priest, and some Blacks with him, who were to have gone with me to the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> if I had not thus met with them. <HI>He then asked,</HI> What we were to have done at the Isle of <HI>Sal? So I told him the Occasion, and also of the Bargain which I had made with him on that Head. He said,</HI> The Priest would never see his Sloop more. <HI>I asked him,</HI> If he heard any thing of her? <HI>He said</HI> Yes, they had taken her, and their own Gang, that they had put on board of her, ran away with her, with a Booty of Eight hundred Pounds in Money, besides other Goods; <HI>and also he said,</HI> He had an Account of me, and what Cargo I brought out of <HI>Barba∣does,</HI> and that, in all Probability, I was then ar∣rived at St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> which Information, and also that the Priest and Governor of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> had a pretty large Bag of Dollars, which each of them had boarded up, was the only Occasion of their coming here: otherwise, if they had not received this Information, they were designed to have gone directly from the Island of <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> after they
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
had cleaned and fitted their Vessels, on their intend∣ed Enterprize.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I could not imagine who could give him that Information of me, for that I had hardly communicated my Design of touching at these Islands to any, that I thought was or could be liable to fall into their Hands, except one Person. <HI>He told me,</HI> It was one that came out in Company with me from <HI>Barbadoes; and to be short, said,</HI> it was Captain <HI>Scot</HI> told them, and how that all the Sloop was his, and he had filled my Hold full of Sugar, Rum, &amp;c. and that he was sure I was, by this Time, arrived at the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> St. <HI>Antonia,</HI> or some of the Windward Islands, unless I was run away with his Sloop and Cargo; and likewise that he had seen, when he was last a Trading at St. <HI>Ni∣cholas,</HI> both the Priest's and Governor's Money, which, as he reported to them, he was certain, neither of them could have less than <HI>1600,</HI> or <HI>2000</HI> Dollars apiece. <HI>So I asked them,</HI> How it was with Captain <HI>Scot? They told me,</HI> He was but indif∣ferent yet, they thought he was better than he de∣served; and told me how they had burnt his Ship, and that he had been put ashore by them at <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> where they believed he at present was.</P>
<P>Russel <HI>still eyeing the Priest and Blacks, asked me,</HI> If I thought it was possible to go ashore and catch them? <HI>I told him,</HI> I thought not. <HI>He asked me,</HI> Why? For, he had Men on board could out-walk or out-run them, he was sure. <HI>I told him,</HI> I believed not; for before his Boat could put ashore, they would be got two or three Miles up in∣to the Country, and that the Way there was so steep and rocky, that I was sure his Men could not climb up, much less pretend to catch them. <HI>He answer∣ed,</HI> It did not signify much; for he would have him, <HI>meaning the Priest,</HI> and some more of them, before this Time to-morrow; <HI>and asked me,</HI> Which
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
was the nighest Anchoring-place to the Town? <HI>And also</HI> from which Anchoring-place was the smoothest Path or Road up to it? <HI>I told him,</HI> I did not know for certain; neither was I any-ways ac∣quainted on the Island, having never been half a Quarter of a Mile up from the Sea-side, on any Part of it. <HI>He said,</HI> I might have heard from the Inhabitants. <HI>I told him,</HI> I did hear some of the Inhabitants say, that the Road of <HI>Paragheesi</HI> was the nighest Anchoring-place to the Town, of all the Roads about the Island; but what sort of Path∣way it was up to Town, I had not so exactly in∣quired, as to be able to satisfy him in that. Well, <HI>says</HI> Russel, we will go to <HI>Paragheesi;</HI> and, <HI>says he to me,</HI> you shall pilot us thither. <HI>I told him,</HI> I never had been there, and did not know, but there might be sunken Rocks in the Way; and, therefore, thought myself very unqualified to take Charge of the Vessel thither; but, <HI>I told him,</HI> there were two Blacks on board the Sloop, both Natives and Fishermen of that Island; and that one of them was my Pilot, and might be, as far as I knew, very capable to pilot their Vessel into the Road; or, perhaps, might discover to them some more conve∣nient Place to anchor or land at. <HI>Upon this, he swore and damn'd, saying,</HI> What! do you think I will let a Negro pilot me? No, no; <HI>but swore</HI> I should pilot the Vessel into an Anchoring-place, and stand clear if the least Accident happened to her. <HI>I told him,</HI> I would do as well as I could, and that I had acquainted him already of my little Knowledge of the Island. Well, <HI>says he,</HI> do as well as you can: Do as you would do, was it your own Vessel. <HI>I told him</HI> I would: Well, <HI>said he,</HI> we desire you to do no more; <HI>and immediately he gave Orders to make the best of our Way down to</HI> Para∣gheesi, <HI>which accordingly was done; and the Pi∣rates on board my Sloop slipped the Cable, be∣cause</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
<HI>they would not take the Pains to weigh the Anchor, and so, through Sloth and Laziness, left a good Cable and Anchor behind.</HI></P>
<P>All this Time, the other two Ships lay too in the Offing, but as soon as they saw us make sail down to Leeward, the <HI>Rose Pink,</HI> having 36 Guns mounted, commanded by <HI>Edward Loe,</HI> who was then Commodore of them, edged in towards us, upon which we edged off towards him, and spoke with him, and <HI>Russel</HI> gave him an Account of what had passed, and of his Design of landing that Evening upon the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> in order to take the Priest and Governor, if he ap∣proved of their Resolution. Which the Commo∣dore said he did, and immediately ordered his great Launch to be mann'd, and sent some more of his Ship's Company to join and reinforce the Scooner's Crew, and to go ashore with them in the Expedition; which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>Then we haled in for the Shore again, and when we were got the Length of <HI>Porto Lappa,</HI> which is a Road, or Bay, lying about Mid∣way, or a little more, between <HI>Currisal</HI> and <HI>Pa∣ragheesi;</HI> one of the Scooner's Company raps out a great Oath, <HI>That that was the best Place to land at, and the nighest to the Town;</HI> upon which Captain <HI>Russel,</HI> whom I understood then to be, not only Captain of the Scooner, but also Quarter-Master-General of all the Companies, asked me, <HI>If it was as the Fellow said?</HI> I told him, <HI>I could not tell; it might be so as far as I knew; for all the Knowledge I had as to that, was only by the Relation of the Inhabitants, and there∣fore could not be certain myself, not knowing but they might deceive me in the Relations they made me.</HI> The Fellow swore, <HI>That he knew the Place perfectly well; and that he had landed there be∣fore, and was acquainted with the Way up to the</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
<HI>Town:</HI> Upon which, Captain <HI>Russel</HI> ordered to stand in for the Bay of <HI>Porto Lappa,</HI> and likewise directed the Gang, that was to go ashore, to have their Arms ready, and every Man to pre∣pare so many Rounds of Cartridges, both for Pistols and Pieces, and to be in a Readiness to embarque in the Boats, as soon as we should be got nigh enough to the Land. When we came within about half a League of the Shore, the Boats were mann'd by <HI>Russel</HI>'s Order, who also went ashore, and headed them, to the Num∣ber of 35, besides those which went in the Boats to bring them off again. We were ordered by <HI>Russel,</HI> as soon as the Boats were put off, to make the best of our Way down to <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> and come to an Anchor, and stay there till farther Orders, and the Boats were to follow us down to the Bay, after they had landed the Men at <HI>Porto Lappa.</HI></P>
<P>All this was accordingly perform'd, and we cast Anchor in the <HI>Old R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad,</HI> where I had an∣chor'd before in the Sloop; and the Boats, after they had landed the Men, also came down, and got on board of us about 6 a-Clock that Evening; the two Ships keeping plying off, and on, open with where we lay.</P>
<P>Here we rid all Night, during which, the Commodore kept out a Light, as we also did to answer him; and next Day Captain <HI>Russel,</HI> with all his Company, came down to <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> and brought with them as Prisoners, the Priest, and the old Governor's Son, with five or six Men∣blacks; and upon their haling the Scooner, the Boats were mann'd and sent ashore for them, and they were all brought off together. It was about one a-Clock in the Afternoon when they came on board, and immediately we weighed, and stood off to the Ships, which were then ly∣ing
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
too in the Offing; and when we were come within Call of the Commodore, he haled us, and asked, <HI>How all fared? And what Luck?</HI> And was answered by <HI>Russel, That he would wait on him on board, and give him a full and particular Account.</HI> Accordingly the Launch was forthwith manned, and the Men sent from the Commodore, to join the Scooner's Men, for the Shore Expedition, were ordered to embarque in her, to go on board their own Ship; which being done, I was order∣ed also to get into her, to present myself, and pay my Respects to the great Captain <HI>Loe,</HI> their Commodore: Accordingly I went into the Launch, and <HI>Russel</HI> follow'd us in his own Boat, with the Priest, and the other Prisoners, which they had brought off the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>When I came on board the <HI>Rose Pink,</HI> the Company welcomed me on board, and said, <HI>They were sorry for my Loss; but told me, I must go to pay my Respects to the Captain, who was in the Cabbin, and waited for me.</HI> I was ushered in by an Officer, who, I think, was their Gunner, and who, by his Deportment, acted as though he had been Master of the Ceremonies; tho' I do not remember to have heard of such an Officer or Office mentioned among them, neither do I know whether they are always so formal on Board their Commodore, at the first Reception of their captivated Masters of Vessels. When I came into the Cabbin, the Officer who conducted me thither, after paying his Respects to the Commo∣dore, told him, <HI>That I was the Master of the Sloop which they had taken the Day before,</HI> and then withdrew out of the Cabbin, leaving us two alone.</P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Loe, <HI>with the usual Compliment, wel∣comed me on board, and told me,</HI> He was very sorry for my Loss, and that it was not his Desire to
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
meet with any of his Country-men, but rather with Foreigners, excepting some few that he wanted to chastise for their Rogueishness, <HI>as he call'd it:</HI> But however, <HI>says he,</HI> since Fortune has ordered it so, that you have fallen into our Hands, I would have you to be of good Cheer, and not to be cast down. <HI>I told him,</HI> That I also was very sorry, that it was my Chance to fall into their Way; but still en∣couraged myself in the Hopes, that I was in the Hands of Gentlemen of Honour and Generosity; it being still in their Power whether to make this their Capture of me, a Misfortune or not. <HI>He said,</HI> It did not lie in his particular Power; for he was but one Man, and all Business of this Nature, must be done in Publick, and by a Majority of Votes by the whole Company; and though neither he, nor, he believed, any of the Company, desired to meet with any of their own Nation (except some few Persons for the Reasons before-mention'd) yet when they did, it could not well be avoided, but that they must take as their own what Providence sent them: And as they were Gentlemen, who entirely depended upon Fortune, they durst not be so ungrateful to her, as to refuse any Thing which she put into their Way; for if they should despise any of her Favours, tho' never so mean, they might offend her, and thereby cause her to withdraw her Hand from them; and so, perhaps, they might perish for want of those Things, which in their rash Folly they slighted. <HI>He then, in a very obliging Tone, desired me to sit down, he himself all this Time not once moving from his Seat, which was one of the great Guns, though there were Chairs enough in the Cabbin; but I suppose, he thought he should not appear so martial, or Hero-like, if he sat on a Chair, as he did on a great Gun.</HI></P>
<P><HI>After I had sat down, he asked me,</HI> What I would drink? <HI>I thank'd him, and told him,</HI> I did
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
not much Care for drinking; but out of a Sense of the Honour he did me in asking, I would drink any Thing with him which he pleased to drink. <HI>He told me,</HI> It would not avail me any Thing to be cast down: It was Fortune of War, and grieving or vexing myself, might be of no good Consequence in respect to my Health; besides, it would be more taking, <HI>he said,</HI> with the Company, to appear brisk, lively, and with as little Concern as I could. And come, <HI>says he,</HI> you may, and I hope you will, have better Fortune hereafter. <HI>So ringing the Cabbin∣bell, and one of his</HI> Valet de Chambres, <HI>or rather</HI> Valet de Cabins, <HI>appearing, he commanded him to make a Bowl of Punch, in the great Bowl, which was a rich silver one, and held, I believe, about two Gallons; which being done, he order∣ed likewise some Wine to be set on the Table, and accordingly two Bottles of Claret were brought; and then he took the Bowl and drank to me in Punch; but bid me pledge him in which I liked best; which I did in Wine. He told me,</HI> That what he could favour me in, he would, and wished that it had been my Fortune to have been taken by them ten Days or a Fortnight sooner; for then, <HI>he said,</HI> they had abundance of good Commodi∣ties, which they took in <HI>2 Portugueze</HI> outward-bound <HI>Brasile</HI> Men, viz. Cloth, as well Linens as Wool∣lens, both fine and coarse, Hats of all sorts, Silk, Iron, and other rich Goods in abundance, and be∣lieved, he could have prevailed with the Company even to have loaded my Sloop. But now they had no Goods at all, he believed, having disposed of them all, either by giving them to other Prizes, &amp;c. or heaving the rest into <HI>David Jones's Locker (i. e. the Sea);</HI> but did not know, but it might be his Lot, perhaps, to meet with me again, when it might lie in his Way to make me a Retaliation for my present Loss; and he did assure me, that when
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
such an Occasion, as he was but now a speaking of, offered, I might depend he would not be wanting to serve me in any Thing that might turn to my Ad∣vantage, as far as his Power or Interest could reach. <HI>I could do no less, in common Civility, and the Truth is, I dared do no less, than thank him.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time, word was brought into the Cabbin, that the Quarter-Master-General <HI>Russel</HI> was come on board, with the Priest and the other Prisoners, which they had brought off from the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> Captain <HI>Loe</HI> ordered Cap∣tain <HI>Russel,</HI> the Priest, and the Governor's Son of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to be called into the great Cabbin, and accordingly they came, and the Cabbin was immediately fill'd with Officers, and some others of the principal Pirates, who, I suppose, by their long standing, or their Activity in Villainy, had signaliz'd themselves for Principals of the Crew; out of whom, as Occasion served, they also chose their Officers, &amp;c. The Cabbin having been thus filled, <HI>Loe,</HI> after Compliments passed, bid <HI>Russel</HI> and the Prisoners sit down, and then asked <HI>Russel, What News? And how the Game went?</HI> Upon which, <HI>Russel</HI> began his Relation, in these Words, as near as I can remember.</P>
<P><Q>“”According to our last Agreement in Consul∣tation, says he, we landed with 35 Men, on the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> Yesterday in the Af∣ternoon, as soon as possibly we could after the taking the Sloop, and putting Things in such Order as was proper; and immediately after our landing, we apprehended two Blacks of the Natives, who were come down to know who we were, and what Account we were up∣on, that they might go and acquaint the Go∣vernor of us, as they said. But we retarded their Journey, by making them our Guides, to
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
direct and shew us the Way to the Town; and it was well we happened to meet them, for Night coming on, we should never have found the Way; and besides, if we had, we should not have been able, in the Dark, to know whe∣ther we were going right or wrong, the Way being, moreover, very rocky, stony, and there being some very steep, as well as high Ascents and Descents; so that if we had not had a Guide, we should have been so discouraged, as to defer our Journey till the succeeding Day, which would have balked us; for if we had not got up to Town last Night, before we were discovered, the Rumour of our coming, would, I believe, have frightened all the Inhabitants out of the Town, and caused them to fly to the Mountains, and then we should have thought that there was a Booty, but that our being dis∣covered, gave them an Opportunity of con∣veying it away. But by our taking those Men, we prevented any Rumour or Notice of our coming, and so were assured there was no Booty there, but what we found. We got to Town about 9 a-Clock at Night, and, by Estimation, from the Place of our landing to the Town, was about 12 Miles. We went directly to the Governor's House, and having set a Guard there, to prevent any Body's going out, or in, that there might be no Opportunity of con∣veying any Thing out of the House, I took some Hands with me, and went to the Priest's House, whom we found not to have been long come home, from <HI>Currisal,</HI> and had not the least Thought of our so sudden Arrival here, believing it was impossible that we could reach the Town till the Day following, if we were designed to come up; neither had he any No∣tice of our Arrival before, till his own Eyes

confirm'd it. But, however, he did not seem to be much surpriz'd. I set a Guard, to prevent any Thing being conveyed out; and the Priest ordered such Victuals as he had, to be set on the Table, and Wine enough, and told me, <HI>That he could not entertain us at such an unsea∣sonable Time of Night as he would, and hoped we would excuse him for not being better provided, and take the Will for the Deed;</HI> adding, <HI>That to such as we found, we were very welcome, wishing it had been better; but if we tarried till next Day,</HI> he said, <HI>we should be supplied plentifully, with whatever the Island afforded.</HI> Upon which I thank'd him, and told him, <HI>I came of an Er∣rand, and must perform it, which was, That we had a positive Information, from very good Hands, who had been Eye-witnesses, that he, as also the Governor, had good Store of Dollars, as well as Gold hoarded up, and that we were come to share it with them, it being one great Branch of our Trade not to let Money lie rusting and canker∣ing in old Bags or Chests, but to make it move and circulate, whenever we could come at it.</HI> At which, the Priest, without any apparent Con∣cern, replied, <HI>That whoever gave us that Infor∣mation, gave a false one, as any one might easily conceive, if they but gave themselves leave to con∣sider how unlikely, nay, he might very well say, impossible it was, to get Money in those barren, un∣cultivated and commerceless Islands.</HI> I told him, <HI>I was Master of but two Senses that could give me Satisfaction whether the Information was false, or what he now said was true, which were Seeing and Feeling.</HI> He said, <HI>I was welcome to make use of those Senses to my Satisfaction, which I am sure,</HI> says he, <HI>will then fully confirm the Truth of what I have said;</HI> and immediately ordered Wax-candles, (they having no other there, and
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
them only for the Use of the Church, being all consecrated, and sent thither by the Bishop of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> whose Business it is to send consecra∣ted Candles, Oil, &amp;c. for the Use of the Church, to all the adjacent Islands) to be lighted; and we searched all the House, Chests, Trunks, and every where throughout and about the House, and found nothing worth taking, and only about twenty Dollars in Money, which I did not think it worth our while to take from him. From thence I went to the Governor's House, and search'd there as narrowly as we could, and found less there; after which I disposed of my Men as I thought most convenient for the reposing and refreshing them after their fatiguing Journey, but yet with a due Regard withal to our own Security, by setting a Guard, and ordering the rest to repose as as well as they could, and not one of them to offer to stir out of the Governor's House; and withal giving them a strict Charge to be ready with their Arms at all Calls, and at a Moment's Warning, and not one of them to unarm, or unsling his Pistols: Which was accordingly ve∣ry regularly and orderly performed; and next Morning we concluded, that not having lighted on the Booty according to Information given, or rather the Information being false, no such Booty being there, we had therefore agreed to seize and bring on Board the Governor, Priest, and four or five besides, of the principal Inha∣bitants for your more ample Satisfaction.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Loe <HI>sitting as demure and attentive all the while, as a Judge upon the Bench, of a sud∣den started, as it were, out of a deep Study, and interrupting</HI> Russel <HI>in his Story, said,</HI> Z—ds, what Satisfaction is this to me or the Company? We did not want these Fellows, d—n them; No, we
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
wanted their Money, if they had any; and if not, they might have stay'd ashore, or gone to the Devil where they belong to, so we had had the Money: <HI>To this</HI> Russel <HI>replied in a something more stern Tone, and said,</HI> Captain <HI>Loe,</HI> we had as much Reason for, and Interest in, getting the Money, if there had been any, as you had, or any of the Com∣pany could have, and we did as much as could be done to find it; neither do I believe they have any more than what we saw, and which, had I taken it, would not have amounted to Sixpence apiece when shar'd among the Company, and 'twas not worth having our Name call'd in Question for such an in∣significant Trifle. For my part, I am for something that is worth taking, and if I cannot light with such, I never will give the World Occasion to say I am a poor, pitiful, or mean-spirited Fellow: No, I will rob for something of Value, or else will not rob at all, especially from these People among whom we may reckon one of our Places of Refuge in case any of us should be separated from the Company, or the Company break, &amp;c. and therefore I boldly affirm, that by drawing on us an Odium from these People for a Trifle, might be of pernicious Consequence to us, and more especially, if any of us should be put to such Extremities as might happen: For this, <HI>said he,</HI> would by all Men be accounted a narrow-soul'd, mean-spirited Folly, and we should, to all Futurity, be curs'd by our own Fraternity as often as any of them were pinch'd with the Effects, which would be very likely to follow such an Oversight.</P>
<P>Hereupon Captain <HI>Loe</HI> interrupting him, re∣ply'd, <HI>That what he said was very true, and car∣ry'd abundance of Sense and Reason with it, and desired that he would proceed no farther on that Head;</HI> adding, <HI>That he was satisfied in what he did, and believ'd that there was neither want of Judg∣ment or Courage in the Management of it;</HI> but withal
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
desired that he would proceed to finish the History of his Expedition. <HI>But come,</HI> says he, <HI>let us do no∣thing rashly;</HI> and so fills a Bumper, and gave his Service to Captain <HI>Russel,</HI> and wishing me better Success for the future; I thank'd him, and so the Cup was order'd to pass round with a full Bumper to every one, except me, who alone was permit∣ted to drink Wine.</P>
<P>After every one had drank round, Captain <HI>Russel</HI> reassumed his Tale, and proceeded thus:</P>
<P><Q>“”Captain <HI>Loe,</HI> as I told you before, how that we had resolved to bring the Priest, the Go∣vernor, and four or five Blacks on Board, to satis∣fie you and the Company, that it was not Fear nor Cowardise that deterr'd us from obtaining the Booty, which we and you expected to find; so, pursuant to our Resolution, I sent for the Priest to come to me at the Governor's House; but the Person I sent, found that he was fled away in the Night, with all his Slaves, saving an old, lame Woman, who told them this. Hereupon I told the Governor, who was a very ancient Negro, <HI>If he did not cause the Priest to be brought to me in two Hours time, it should be the worse for the Inhabitants of the Island.</HI> The Governor answer'd, <HI>That he much fear'd it was impossible to bring him in, by reason he heard that he was fled, with some of his Slaves, to the Moun∣tains, and that it was very easy for him to re∣main there several Months, notwithstanding all the Means which he could possibly use to discover him.</HI> He gave an Instance of this in one of the Priest's Slaves, who formerly had run away from his Master, and notwithstanding the Priest used all manner of Diligence to apprehend him, (and that he could do more that Way than any one) yet that Slave was undiscover'd for near twelve Months, and by most People
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
thought to be dead: The Governor added, That the same Slave being with him now, he had, no doubt, thoroughly acquainted his Ma∣ster with all the Caverns, Caves, and other Places of Secrecy. Upon which I told him, <HI>If he did not bring him, or cause him to be brought and deliver'd to me in three Hours time at farthest, I would, as soon as that Time was expired, burn the Town down to Ashes:</HI> He answer'd, <HI>He lay at my Mercy, and would use all Diligence to find, and cause him, if possible, to be deliver'd to me within the Time limited; but hop'd, that after he had used his utmost Endeavour, if it should prove fruitless, that I would be more considerate than to make the Innocent suffer for the Fault of the Guilty.</HI> I told him, <HI>The Time was set, and I would not defer burning the Town down to the Ground, one Minute after that Time was expired, if the Priest was not delivered into my Hands.</HI> Then he told me, <HI>He hop'd we would not kill him, nor abuse him in his Person: As for our Goods,</HI> says he, <HI>them we leave wholly to your Mercy.</HI> I told him, <HI>The Priest should not be hurt in his Body, if he came and surrender'd him∣self within the Time limited, and behaved himself like a Man.</HI> The Governor sent immediately several Parties of his Blacks in quest of the Priest; and in the mean time I order'd him to kill an Ox, and dress it as soon as he could, for my Men, and also to get a Pipe of Wine, and set it abroach, which he accordingly did. In about two Hours, some of the Blacks who had been sent out by the Governor in quest of the Priest, return'd, and brought word, That they had found the Priest, and secur'd him from escaping; but he had sent them to desire the Governor to pray me not to be angry, and heartily to beg my Pardon, being very sorry
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
that he had given me so much Trouble, and in Affiance on my Goodness, he would wait upon me, and cast himself entirely upon my Mercy. I told the Governor, he might come without Fear, for he should not be abused; upon which he came, and very submissively ask'd my Par∣don, and hop'd I would not be angry for his be∣ing so rude, after I and our Company had be∣hav'd our selves so civilly; repenting that he should be so foolish as to sneak away so, and abscond, having no Reason, as he believed, to do so, but his own groundless Apprehensions; adding, That he was perswaded to it, or else he should not have done it of himself neither. I bid him not be afraid, we would not hurt him, but told him, he had like to have hurt the whole Island by his unadvised Rashness; for if he had not come as he did, I was resolv'd, as soon as my Men had got their Victuals, to have burn'd the Town down to Ashes, Church and all. He said, <HI>He thank'd God that he was, he hop'd, come Time enough to save it, and thank'd me for my Clemency in deferring it so long.</HI> I told him, it was very well, and bid him sit down, which he did, and sent to his House for Wine, Fowls, and an Anchor of Rum, which were brought, and we made our selves very merry, eat and drank heartily, kept Open House, and treated all the Natives that came to us; the greatest Part having taken Ex∣ample by the Priest, I suppose, and fled out to the Mountains for fear of us, tho' my De∣sign was not to hurt any of them, while they continued civil.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>“After we had eaten and drank, and sufficient∣ly refreshed our selves, I told the Priest and Governor,</HI> That they and six more whom I should choose, must go on Board the Commadore. <HI>The</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
<HI>Priest seem'd to be much surprized at this News, and told me,</HI> That he hoped we would not carry them quite away from the Island, nor make Slaves of them. <HI>Upon which I told him,</HI> I was a Ro∣man-Catholick as well as he; neither should there be any Harm done to him, nor any of them that went with him; and that they should only go on Board the Commadore, and satisfie him that the Information which he had of their having so much Money, was false. <HI>At which he seem'd to be very well contented, and accordingly we came down and got on Board. And now here they are, do you with them as you please.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Russel</HI> having thus ended his Relation, Captain <HI>Loe</HI> said, <HI>He had done very well,</HI> and ask'd the Priest several Questions, after which, he directed them to be put on Board the Scooner, and from her, to be put ashore; but I was order'd to remain on Board the Commadore till by a gene∣ral Vote of the Company it should be determin'd how I and the Sloop were to be dispos'd of; and Captain <HI>Loe</HI> ordered a Hammock and Bedding to be fix'd for me, and told me, <HI>That he would not oblige me to sit up later than I thought fit, nor drink more than suited my own Inclination; and that he lik'd my Company no longer than his was agreeable to me;</HI> adding, <HI>That there should be no Confine∣ment or Obligation as to drinking, or sitting up, but I might drink, and go to sleep, when I pleas'd, with∣out any Exceptions being taken, ordering me to want for nothing that was on Board; for I was very wel∣come to any thing that was there, as to Eatables and Drinkables.</HI> I thank'd him, and told him, <HI>I would, with all due Gratefulness, make Use of that Freedom which he was so generous to offer me,</HI> &amp;c. About Eight a-Clock at Night I took my Leave of him, and went to my Hammock, where I continued all Night, with Thoughts roving and perplex'd
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
enough, not being able, as yet, to guess what they design'd to do with me, whether they in∣tended to give me the Sloop again, or to burn her, as I heard it toss'd about by some, or to keep me as a Prisoner on Board, or put me ashoar.</P>
<P>My two Boys and Mate remained still on Board the Sloop, but all the rest they took on Board of them, not once so much as asking them whether they would Enter with them, only de∣manding their Names, which the Steward writ down in their Roll-Book.</P>
<P>About eight a-Clock in the Morning I turn'd out, and went upon Deck, and as I was walking backwards and forwards, as is usual amongst us Sailors, there came up one of the Company to me, and bid me Good-Morrow, and told me, <HI>He was very sorry for my Misfortune.</HI> I answer'd, <HI>So was I:</HI> He look'd at me, and said, <HI>He be∣liev'd I did not know him.</HI> I replied, <HI>It was true, I did not know him; neither, at present, could I call to mind that ever I had seen him before in the whole Course of my Life.</HI> He smil'd, and said, <HI>He once belong'd to me, and sail'd with me when I was Commander of the</HI> Susannah <HI>in the Year</HI> 1718 (At that Time I was Master of a Ship call'd the <HI>Su∣sannah,</HI> about the Burthen of 300 Tons, where∣of was sole Owner Mr. <HI>Richard Stephens,</HI> Mer∣chant, living at this present writing in <HI>Shad-Thames, Southwark</HI> Side, near <HI>London—.)</HI> In the <HI>Interim</HI> came up two more, who told me they all belong'd to me in the <HI>Susannah,</HI> at one Time. By this time I had recollected my Me∣mory so far as just to call them to Mind, and that was all; and then I told them I did remember them. They said, they were truly very sorry for my Misfortune, and would do all that lay in their Power to serve me, and told me, they had among
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
them the Quantity of about 40 or 50 Pieces of white Linnen Cloth, and 6 or 8 Pieces of Silk, besides some other Things; and they would also, they said, make what Interest they could for me with their Consorts and Intimates, and with them would make a Gathering for me of what Things they could, and would put it on Board for me as soon as the Company had determined that I should have my Sloop again. They then look'd about them as tho' they had some∣thing to say that they were not willing any body should hear; but as it happen'd, there was no body nigh us, which was an Opportunity very rare in these Sort of Ships, of speaking with∣out Interruption: But we lying too all Night, no body had any thing to do, but the Lookers-out, at the Topmast-head; the Mate of the Watch, Quarter-master of the Watch, Helms∣man, &amp;c. being gone down to drink a Dram, I suppose, or to smoak a Pipe of Tobacco, or the like. However it was, we had the Quarter Deck intire to our selves, and they seeing the Coast clear, told me, with much seeming Concern, That if I did not take abundance of Care, they would force me to stay with them, for my Mate had inform'd them, that I was very well acquaint∣ed on the Coast of <HI>Brasile,</HI> and they were bound down along the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and afterwards design'd to stretch over to the Coast of <HI>Bra∣sile:</HI> That there was not one Man of all the Company that had ever been upon any Part of that Coast; and that there was but one Way for me to escape being forced; but I must be very close, and not discover what they were going to tell me; for if it was known that they had divulg'd it, notwithstanding they were en∣ter'd Men, and as much of the Company as any of them, yet they were sure it would cost them
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
no smaller a Price for it than their Lives. I told them, I was very much obliged to them for their Good-will, and did not wish them to have any Occasion for my Service; but if ever it should be so, they might depend it should be to the utmost of my Power; and as for my betraying any thing that they should tell me of, they could not fear that, because my own Interest would be a suffici∣ent Tye upon me to the contrary; and were it not so, and that I was sure to get Mountains of Gold by divulging it to their Prejudice, I would fooner suffer my Tongue to be pluck'd out.</P>
<P><HI>They said, they did not much fear my reveal∣ing it, because the disclosing it would rather be a Prejudice to me than an Advantage, and there∣fore out of pure Respect to me they would tell me; which was thus:</HI> You must know, <HI>said they,</HI> that we have an Article which we are sworn to, which is, not to force any married Man, against his Will, to serve us: Now we have been at a close Consultation whether we should oblige you to go with us, not as one of the Company, but as a forc'd Pri∣soner, in order to be our Pilot on the Coast of <HI>Bra∣sile,</HI> where we are designed to Cruise, and hope to make our Voyage; and your Mate, <HI>continued they,</HI> has offer'd to Enter with us, but desires to defer it till we have determined your Case. Now your Mate, as yet, is ignorant of our Articles, we never expo∣sing them to any till they are going to sign them. He was ask'd, Whether you was married or not? and he said, he could not tell for certain, but believed you was not: Upon which we spoke, and said, we had known you several Years, and had sail'd with you in a Frigat-built Ship of <HI>300</HI> Tons, or more: That you was an extraordinary good Man to your Men, both for Usage and Payment; and that, to our Knowledge, you was married, and had four Children then: However, there is one Man who
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
would fain have the Company break through their Oath on that Article, and tells them, they may, and ought to do it, because it is a Case of Necessity, they having no Possibility of getting a Pilot at present for that Coast, except they take you: And in their Run a∣long the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> if they should light of any body that was acquainted with the Coast of <HI>Brasile,</HI> and no way exempted from serving them by the Ar∣ticles, then they might take him, and turn you a∣shore, but 'till such offer'd, he did not see but the Oath might be dispens'd with; but, <HI>continued they,</HI> Captain <HI>Loe</HI> is very much against it, and told them, That it would be an ill Precedent, and of bad Con∣sequence; for if we once take the Liberty of breaking our Articles and Oath, then there is none of us can be sure of any thing: If, <HI>said Captain</HI> Loe, you can perswade the Man upon any Terms to stay with us as a Prisoner, or otherwise, well and good; if not, do not let us break the Laws that we have made our selves, and sworn to. <HI>They went on, and told me,</HI> That most of the Company seem'd to agree with Captain <HI>Loe</HI>'s Opinion, but <HI>Russel, said they,</HI> seem'd to be sadly nettled at it, that his Advice was not to be taken; and, <HI>continued they,</HI> you will be ask'd the Question, we reckon, by and by, when <HI>Russel</HI> comes on Board, and all the Heads meet again; but you must be sure to say you are married, and have five or six Children; for it is only that, that will prevent your being forced; tho', you may depend upon it, <HI>Russel</HI> will do what he can to perswade the Company to break the Article, which we hope they will not, nor shall they ever have our Consent; and, indeed, there are very few of the Company but what are against it, but <HI>Russel</HI> bears a great Sway in the Company, and can al∣most draw them any Way. However, we have put you in the best Method that we can, and hope it will do: But, for fear Notice should be taken of our be∣ing
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
so long together, we have told you as much as we can, and leave you to manage it; and so God bless you.</P>
<P>Upon this, away they went, and by-and-by Captain <HI>Loe</HI> turns out, and comes upon Deck, and bidding me Good-morrow, ask'd me, <HI>How I did? and how I lik'd my Bed?</HI> I thank'd him, and told him, <HI>I was very well, at his Service, and lik'd my Bed very well, and was very much obliged to him for the Care he had taken of me.</HI> After which, he order'd a Consultation Signal to be made, which was their <HI>Green Trumpeter,</HI> as they call'd him, hoisted at the Mizen-Peek: It was a green silk Flag, with a yellow Figure of a Man blow∣ing a Trumpet on it. The Signal being made, away came the Boats flocking on Board the Com∣madore, and when they were all come on Board, Captain <HI>Loe</HI> told them, He only wanted them to Breakfast with him; so down they went into the Cabbin, as many as it would well hold, and the rest in the Steerage, and where they could.</P>
<P><HI>After Breakfast, Captain</HI> Loe <HI>ask'd me,</HI> If I was married? and how many Children I had? <HI>I told him,</HI> I had been married about ten Years, and had five Children when I came from Home, and did not know but I might have six now, one being on the Stocks when I came from Home. <HI>He asked me,</HI> Whether I had left my Wife well provided for, when I came from Home? <HI>I told him,</HI> I had left her in but very indifferent Circumstances: That having met with former Misfortunes, I was so low reduc'd, that the greatest Part of my Sub∣stance was in this Sloop and Cargo; and that, if I was put by this Trip, I did not know but my Fa∣mily might want Bread before I could supply them.</P>
<P>Loe <HI>then turning to</HI> Russel, <HI>said,</HI> It will not do, <HI>Russel.</HI> What will not do, <HI>said</HI> Russel? Loe <HI>an∣swer'd,</HI> You know who I mean; we must not, and it
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
shall not be, by G—d. It must, and shall, by G—d, <HI>reply'd</HI> Russel; Self-Preservation is the first Law of Nature, and Necessity, according to the old Pro∣verb, has no Law. Well, <HI>says</HI> Loe, It shall never be with my Consent. <HI>Hereupon most of the Com∣pany said,</HI> It was a Pity, and ought to be taken into Consideration, and seriously weighed amongst them, and then put to the Vote. <HI>At which</HI> Loe <HI>said,</HI> So it ought, and there is nothing like the Time present to decide the Controversy, and to determine the Matter. <HI>They all answered,</HI> Ay, it was best to end it now.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Loe</HI> ordered them all to go upon Deck, and bid me stay in the Cabbin; so up they went all hands, and I sat still and smoak'd a Pipe of Tobacco, Wine and Punch being left on the Ta∣ble: And tho' I was very impatient to know the Determination, sometimes hoping it would be in my Favour, and sometimes fearing the contrary; yet I durst not go out of the Cabbin to hear what they said, nor make any Enquiry about it.</P>
<P><HI>After they had been upon Deck about two Hours, they came down again, and</HI> Loe <HI>ask'd me,</HI> How I did? and how I lik'd my Company since they went upon Deck? <HI>I thank'd him, and said,</HI> I was very well, at his Service; and as for my Company, I lik'd it very well, and it was Company that few would dislike. Why, <HI>said he,</HI> I thought you had been all alone ever since we went upon Deck. <HI>I answer'd,</HI> How could you think, Sir, that I was alone, when you left me three such boon, jolly Companions to keep me Company?</P>
<P>Z—ds, <HI>says</HI> Loe, <HI>and seem'd a little angry,</HI> I left no-body, and ordered no-body but the Boy <HI>Jack,</HI> and him I bid stay at the Cabbin-Door, with∣out-side, and not go in, nor stir from the Door, 'till I bid him. But, <HI>I said,</HI> Sir, my three Companions were not humane Bodies, but those which you left on
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
the Table, to wit, a Pipe of Tobacco, a Bottle of <HI>French</HI> Claret, and a Bowl of Punch; <HI>at which they all laugh'd, and</HI> Loe <HI>said,</HI> I was right: <HI>So after some Discourses had pass'd by way of Di∣version,</HI> Russel <HI>said to me,</HI> Master, your Sloop is very Leaky; <HI>I said,</HI> Yes, she made Water. Water! <HI>says he,</HI> I do not know what you could do with her, suppose we were to give her to you. Besides, you have no Hands, for all your Hands now belong to us. <HI>I said,</HI> Sirs, if you please to give her to me, I do not fear, with God's Blessing, but to manage her well enough, if you let me have only those which are on Board, which I hope you will: namely, my Mate and the two Boys. Well, <HI>says he,</HI> and sup∣pose we did, you have no Cargo, for we have taken, to replenish our Stores, all the Rum, Sugar, To∣bacco, Rice, Flower, and, in short, all your Cargo and Provisions. <HI>I told him,</HI> I would do as well as I could, and if the worst came to the worst, I could load the Sloop with Salt, and carry it to the <HI>Canaries,</HI> where, I knew, they were in great Want of Salt at present, and therefore was sure it would come to a good Market there: Ay, but, <HI>says he,</HI> how will you do to make your Cargo of Salt, having no Hands, and having nothing wherewith to hire the Natives to help you to make it, or to pay for their bringing it down on their Asses; for you must believe, <HI>said he,</HI> I understand Trade. <HI>I told him,</HI> If it did come to that Extremity, I had so good Inte∣rest both at the Island of <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> as likewise at the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> that I was sure the Inhabitants would assist me all that they could, and trust me for their Pay till I return'd again; especially when they came to know the Occasion that oblig'd me to it; and that, upon the Whole, I did not fear, with God's Blessing, to get a Cargo of Salt on Board, if they would be so generous as to give me the Sloop again. Well but, <HI>says Russel,</HI> suppose we should let you
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
have the Sloop, and that you could do as you say, what would you do for Provisions? for we shall leave you none; and I suppose I need not tell you, for, without doubt, you know it already, that all these Islands to Windward are in great Scarcity of Victuals, and especially the two Islands that pro∣duce the Salt, which have been oppress'd for many Years with a sore Famine. <HI>I told him,</HI> I was very sensible that all he said last was true, but hop'd, if they gave me the Sloop, they would also be so generous as to give me some Provisions, a small Quantity of which would serve my little Company; but if not, I could go down to the Leeward Islands, where, likewise, I had some small Interest, and I did not doubt but I could have a small Matter of such Provisions as the Islands afforded, namely, Maiz Pompions, Feshunes, &amp;c. with which, by God's Assistance, we would endeavour to make shift, 'till it pleased God we could get better. Ay but, <HI>says he,</HI> perhaps your Mate and Boys will not be willing to run that Hazard with you, nor care to endure such Hardship. <HI>I told him,</HI> As for my Boys, I did not fear their Compliance, and hop'd my Mate would also do the same, seeing I requir'd him to undergo no other Hardship but what I partook of myself. Ay, but, <HI>says Russel,</HI> Your Mate has not the same Reasons as you have, to induce him to bear with all those Hardships, which you must certainly be exposed to in doing what you propose; and there∣fore you cannot expect him to be very forward in accepting such hard Terms with you; (tho' I cannot conceive it to be so easie to go through with, in the Manner you propose, as you seem to make it). <HI>I answer'd,</HI> As for the Mate's Inclinations, I was not able positively to judge in this Affair, but I be∣lieved him to be an honest, as well as a conscien∣tious Man, and as I had been very civil▪ to him in several Respects, in my Prosperity, so I did not
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
doubt, if I had the Liberty to talk with him a little on this Affair, but he would be very willing to undergo as much Hardship to extricate me out of this my Adversity, as he could well bear, or I in Reason require of him, which would be no more than I should bear myself; and when it pleased God to turn the Scales, I would endeavour to make him Satisfaction to the full of what, in reason, he could expect, or, at least, as far as I was able.</P>
<P>Come, come, <HI>says Captain</HI> Loe, let us drink about. Boy! how does the Dinner go forward? <HI>The Boy answer'd,</HI> Very well, Sir. <HI>Says Loe,</HI> Gentlemen, you must all Dine with me to Day. <HI>They unanimously answer'd,</HI> Ay: Come then, says <HI>Loe,</HI> toss the Bowl about, and let us have a fresh One, and call a fresh Cause.</P>
<P>They all agreed to this, and then began to talk of their past Transactions at <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> the <HI>Western Islands, Canary Islands,</HI> &amp;c. What Ships they had taken, and how they serv'd them when in their Possession; and how they oblig'd the Go∣vernor of the Island of St. <HI>Michael</HI> to send them off two Boat-Loads of fresh Meat, Greens, Wine, Fowls, &amp;c. or otherwise, threatned to damnifie the Island, by burning some of the small Vilages: Of their Landing on the Island of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> to the Northward of <HI>Oratavo,</HI> in hopes of meeting with a Booty, but got nothing but their Skins full of Wine; and how they had like to have been sur∣priz'd by the Country, which was raised upon that Occasion, but got all off safe, and without any Harm, except one Man, who receiv'd a Shot in his Thigh after they were got into their Boats; but, they said, they caused several of the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> to drop; and, That they should have been certainly lost, if they had tarried but half a quar∣ter of an Hour longer in the House where they were drinking, and where they expected to get the
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
Booty, which they Landed in quest of, accord∣ing to the Information given them by one of the Inhabitants of the Island, who was taken by them in a Fishing-Boat, and told them, that, that Gentleman had an incredible Quantity of Mo∣ney, as well as Plate, in his House: And on this Occasion they threatned the poor Fisherman how severly they would punish him for giving them a false Information, if ever they should light of him again; but, I suppose, the Fellow kept close ashore after they let him go, all the Time they lay lurking about the Island: They also boasted how many <HI>French</HI> Ships they had taken upon the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and what a vast Quantity of Wine, especially <HI>French</HI> Claret, they took from them; with abundance of such like Stuff; which, as it did not immediately concern me, so I shall not trouble myself with particularizing: And, indeed, my Attention was so wholly taken up with the Uncertainty of my own Affairs, that I gave no great Heed to those Subjects that were foreign to me; and which, for that Reason, made but a slight Im∣pression on my Memory.</P>
<P>In this Manner they pass'd the Time away, drinking and carousing merrily, both before and after Dinner, which they eat in a very disorderly Manner, more like a Kennel of Hounds, than like Men, snatching and catching the Victuals from one another; which, tho' it was very odi∣ous to me, it seem'd one of their chief Diversi∣ons, and, they said, look'd Martial-like.</P>
<P>Before it was quite dark, every one repaired on Board their respective Vessels, and about Eight a-Clock at Night I went to my Hammock, without observing, as I remember, any thing worth remarking, save, that Captain <HI>Loe,</HI> and I, and three or four more, drank a couple of Bot∣tles
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
of Wine after the Company were gone, be∣fore we went to Sleep, in which time we had abundance of Discourse concerning <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> as also about <HI>Trade,</HI> which would be te∣dious to relate in that confused Manner we talked of these Subjects, besides the Reason I just now mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Loe</HI> stay'd up after me, and when I was in my Hammock, I heard him give the necessary Or∣ders for the Night, which were, that they were to lie too with their Head to the <HI>North Westward,</HI> as, indeed, we had ever since I had been on Board of him; to mind the Top-light, and for the Watch, to be sure, above all things, to keep a good Look-out; and to call him if they saw any thing, or if the other Ships made any Signals.</P>
<P>I passed this Night as the former, ruminating on my present unhappy Condition, not yet being able to dive into, or fathom their Designs, or what they intended to do with me, and often thinking on what the three Men told me, as also on what the Company said, but in a more parti∣cular manner, of what <HI>Russel</HI> told me concerning my Mate, 'till Sleep overpowered my Senses, and gave me a short Recess from my Troubles.</P>
<P>In the Morning, about five a-Clock, I turned out, and a little after, one of the three Men who spoke to me the Morning before, came to me, and bid me Good-morrow, and ask'd me very courteously how I did? and told me, that they would all three, as before, have come and spoke to me, but were afraid the Company, especially <HI>Russel</HI>'s Friends, would think they held a secret Correspondence with me, which was against one of their Articles, it being punishable by Death, to hold any secret Correspondence with a Priso∣ner; but they hop'd all would be well, and that they believ'd I should have my Sloop again; <HI>Rus∣sel</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
being the only Man who endeavour'd to hin∣der it, and he only, on the Account of having me to go with them on the Coast of <HI>Brasile;</HI> but that most of the Company was against it, except the meer Creatures of <HI>Russel.</HI> He said, I might thank my Mate for it all, who, he much fear'd, would prove a Rogue to me, and Enter with them; and then, if they should give me my Sloop, I should be sadly put to it to manage her myself, with one Boy, and the little Child. He also said, That he, and the other two, heartily wish'd they could go with me in her, but that it was impossible to expect it, it being Death even to motion it, by another of their Articles, which says, <HI>That if any of the Company shall advise, or speak any thing tending to the separating or breaking of the Company, or shall by any Means offer or en∣deavour to desert or quit the Company, that Person shall be shot to Death by the Quarter-Master's Or∣der, without the Sentence of a Court-Martial.</HI> He added, That 'till my Mate had given <HI>Russel</HI> an Account of my being acquainted on the Coast of <HI>Brasile,</HI> he seem'd to be my best Friend, and would certainly have prov'd so, and would have prevail'd with the Company to have made a Ga∣thering for me, which, perhaps, might not have come much short in Value of what they had ta∣ken from me; for there was but few in the Com∣pany but had several Pieces of Linnen Cloth, Pieces of Silk, spare Hats, Shoes, Stockings, gold Lace, and abundance of other Goods, besides the publick Store, which, if <HI>Russel</HI> had continued my Friend, for one Word speaking, there was not one of them but would have contributed to make up my Loss; it being usual for them to reserve such Things for no other Use but to give to any whom they should take, or that formerly was of their Acquaintance, or that they took a
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
present Liking to: He said farther, That he be∣liev'd Captain <HI>Loe</HI> would be my Friend, and do what he could for me; but that, in Opposition to <HI>Russel,</HI> he could do but little, <HI>Russel</HI> bearing twice the Sway with the Company, that Captain <HI>Loe</HI> did; and that <HI>Russel</HI> was always more consi∣derate to those they took, than <HI>Loe;</HI> but now I must expect no Favour from him, he was so exas∣perated by the Opposition that the Company, and especially Captain <HI>Loe,</HI> made to my being forc'd to go with them on the Coast of <HI>Brasile:</HI> He, however, bid me have a good Heart, and wish'd it lay in his Power to serve me more than it did, and bid me not to take very much Notice, or shew much Freedom with them, but rather a seeming Indifference: Adding, That he and his two Consorts wish'd me as well as Heart could wish, and whatever Service they could do me, while among them, I might assure myself it should not be wanting; desiring me to excuse him, and not take amiss his withdrawing from me; concluding, with Tears in his Eyes, that he did not know whether he should have another Opportunity of private Discourse with me; nei∣ther would it be for the Advantage of either of us, except some new Matter offer'd them Occa∣sion to forewarn, or precaution me, which, if it did, one of them would not fail to acquaint me with it: And so he left me.</P>
<P>Some time after, Captain <HI>Loe</HI> turn'd out, and after the usual Compliments pass'd, we took a Dram of Rum, and enter'd into Discourse with one or another, on different Subjects; for as a Tavern or Alehouse-keeper endeavours to pro∣mote his Trade, by conforming to the Humours of every Customer, so was I forc'd to be plea∣sant with every one, and bear a Bob with them in almost all their Sorts of Discourse, tho' never
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
so contrary and disagreeable to my own Inclina∣tions; otherwise I should have fallen under an <HI>Odium</HI> with them, and when once that happens to be the Case with any poor Man, the Lord have Mercy upon him; for then every rascally Fellow will let loose his Brutal Fancy upon him, and either abuse him with his Tongue, (which is the least hurtful) or kick or cuff him, or other∣ways abuse him, as they are more or less cruel, or artificially raised by Drinking, Passion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Russel,</HI> with some more, came on Board about ten or eleven a-Clock in the Fore∣noon, and seem'd to be very pleasant to me, asking me how I did? telling me, that he had been considering of what I said Yesterday, and could not see, how I should be able to go through with it: That it would be very difficult, if not wholly impossible, and I should run a very great Hazard in what I propos'd. He believ'd, he said, that I was a Man, and a Man of Under∣standing, but in this Case I rather seem'd to be directed by an obstinate Desperation, than by Reason; and for his Part, since I was so care∣less of myself as to determine to throw myself away, he did not think it would stand with the Credit or Reputation of the Company, to put it into my Power. He wish'd me well, he said, and did assure me, that the Thoughts of me had taken him up the greatest Part of the Night; and he had hit on a Way which, he was sure, would be much more to my Advantage, and not expose me to so much Hazard and Danger, and yet would be more profitable, than I could expect by having the Sloop, tho' every thing was to fall out to exceed my Expectation; and did not doubt of the Company's agreeing to it: <HI>And this,</HI> says he, <HI>is, to take and sink or burn your Sloop, and keep you with us no otherwise than as you are now,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
<HI>viz. a Prisoner; and I promise you, and will en∣gage to get the Company to sign and agree to it, the first Prize we take, if you like her; and if not, you shall stay with us till we take a Prize that you like, and you shall have her with all her Cargo, to dispose of how and where you please, for your own proper Use.</HI> He added, <HI>that this, perhaps, might be the making of me, and put me in a Capa∣city of leaving off the Sea, and living ashore, if I was so inclin'd;</HI> protesting, <HI>that he did all this purely out of Respect to me, because he saw I was a Man of Sense,</HI> as he said, <HI>and was willing to take Care and Pains to get a Living for myself and Family.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I thank'd him, and told him,</HI> I was sorry I could not accept of his kind Offer; and hoped he would excuse me, and not impute it to an obstinate Temper; because, <HI>I said,</HI> I did not perceive it would be of any Advantage to me, but rather the Reverse; for I could not see how I should be able to dispose of the Ship, or any Part of her Cargo; because no Body would buy, except I had a lawful Power to sell; and they all certainly knew, they had no farther Right to any Ship or Goods that they took, than so long as such Ship or Goods was with∣in the Verge of their Power; which, they were sen∣sible, could not extend so far, as to reach any Place where such Sale could be made: Besides, <HI>I said,</HI> if the Owners of any such Ship or Goods should ever come to hear of it, then should I be lia∣ble to make them Restitution, to the full Value of such Ship and Cargo, or be oblig'd to lie in a Prison the remaining Part of my Days; or, perhaps, by a more rigid Prosecution of the Law against my Per∣son, run a Hazard of my Life.</P>
<P>Russel <HI>said,</HI> These were but needless and ground∣less Scruples, and might easily be evaded: As for my having a Right to make Sale of the Ship and
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
Cargo, which they would give me, they could easily make me a Bill of Sale of the Ship, and such other necessary Powers in Writing, as were sufficient to justify my Title to it beyond all Possibility of Sus∣picion; so that I should not have any Reason to fear my being detected in the Sale: And as for my Ap∣prehension of being discover'd to the Owners, that might as easily be prevented; for they should al∣ways know, by Examination of the Master, &amp;c. and also by the Writings taken on board such Ship (which they always took Care to seize upon) who were the Owners and Merchants concern'd in both Ship and Cargo, as also their Places of Abode; by which I might be able to shun a Possibility of their discovering me: <HI>Adding,</HI> That I might have the Powers and Writings made in another Name, which I might go by 'till I had finish'd the Business, and then could assume my own; which Method would certainly secure me from all Possibility of Dis∣covery.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I must confess, there was not only a Probability, but a seeming Certainty, in what he said, and that it argued abundance of Wit in the Contrivance; but, <HI>I assur'd him,</HI> that were I positively certain, which I could not be, that 'till the Hour of my Death it would not be discover'd, yet there was still a stronger Motive to deter me from accepting it; which, tho' it might seem, per∣haps, to them to be of no Weight, and but a meer Chimera, yet it had greater Force with me than all the Reasons I had hitherto mention'd; and that was my Conscience; which would be a continual Witness against me, and a constant Sting, even when, perhaps, no Body would accuse me: And as there could be no hearty and unfeigned Repentance, without making a full Restitution, as far as I was able, to the injur'd Person; <HI>I ask'd them,</HI> What Benefit would it be to me, if I got Thousands
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
of Pounds, and could not be at Peace with my Con∣science, 'till I had restor'd every Thing to the pro∣per Owners, and after all, remain as I was before? <HI>A great deal more, I told them, I could say upon this Head; but doubted that Discourses of this Nature were not very taking with some of them, and might seem of very little Account;</HI> Yet I hope, <HI>said I,</HI> and God forbid that there should not be some of you, who have a Thought of a great and powerful God, and á Consciousness of his impar∣tial Justice to punish, as well as of his unfathoma∣ble Mercy to pardon Offenders upon their unfeigned Repentance, which would not so far extend as to encourage us to run on in sinning, thereby presuming to impose on his Mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Some of them said,</HI> I should do well to preach a Sermon, and would make them a good Chaplain. <HI>Others said,</HI> No, they wanted no Godliness to be preach'd there: That Pirates had no God but their <HI>Money,</HI> nor <HI>Saviour</HI> but their <HI>Arms. Others said,</HI> That I had said nothing but what was very good, true, and rational, and they wish'd that God∣liness, or, at least, some Humanity, were in more Practice among them; which they believ'd, would be more to their Reputation, and cause a greater Esteem to be had for them, both from God and Man.</P>
<P><HI>After this, a Silence follow'd; which Capt.</HI> Russel <HI>broke, saying to me again,</HI> Master, as to your Fear that you wrong your Neighbour in taking a Ship from us, which we first took from him; in any Judgment, it is groundless and without Cause; nor is it a Breach of the Laws of God or Man, as far as I am able to apprehend; for you do not take their Goods from them, nor usurp their Property: That we have done without your Advice, Concur∣rence, or Assistance; and therefore whatever Sin <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Guilt follows that Action, it is intirely <HI>Ours,</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
and, in my Opinion, cannot extend to make any unconcern'd Person guilty with us. It is plain, beyond disputing, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> that you can be no Way Partaker with us in any Capture, while you are only a constrain'd Prisoner, neither giving your Advice or Consent, or any Ways assisting; and therefore it may be most certainly concluded, that it is <HI>We</HI> only that have invaded the Right, and u∣surp'd the Property of another; and that you must be innocent, and cannot be Partaker of the Crime, unless concern'd in that Action that made it a Crime. But you seem to allow, that we have a Property, while we are in Possession; but, <HI>added he,</HI> I sup∣pose you think, that all the Claim we have to the Ships and Goods that we take, is by an Act of Vio∣lence, and therefore unjust, and of no longer Force than while we are capable to maintain them by the same superior Strength by which we obtain'd them.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I could not express my Conceptions of it better or fuller, I thought, than he had done; but hoped, neither he, nor Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> nor any of the Gentlemen present, would be offended at my taking so much Liberty; which was rather to ac∣quaint them with my Reasons for not being able to accept of their kind Offer, than to give any Gentle∣man Offence; <HI>adding,</HI> That I had so much Confi∣dence in their Favours, that, if I could have ac∣cepted them, I verily believ'd, they would all have concurred with Capt. <HI>Russel</HI> in what he so kindly and friendly design'd me.</P>
<P><HI>At which Words they all cry'd,</HI> Ay, Ay, by G—, <HI>and that</HI> I was deserving of that and more.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I heartily thank'd them all in gene∣ral, and did not wish any of them so unfortunate, as to stand in Need of my Service; yet, if ever they did, they should find, that the uttermost of my Abi∣lity should not be wanting in Retaliation of all the Civilities they had shewn me, ever since▪ it was my
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
Lot to fall into their Hands; but, in a more espe∣cial Manner, for this their now offer'd Kindness, tho' I could not accept it with a safe and clear Con∣science, which I valued above any Thing to be en∣joy'd in this World. <HI>I said,</HI> I could add farther Reasons to those I had already urg'd; but I would not trouble them longer, fearing I had already been too tedious or offensive to some of them; which; if I had, I heartily begg'd their Pardon; assuring them once more, that if it was so, it was neither my Design nor Intent, but the Reverse.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon they all said,</HI> They liked to hear us talk, and thought we were very well match'd: <HI>Adding,</HI> That Capt. <HI>Russel</HI> could seldom meet with a Man that could stand him: But, as for their Parts, they were pleas'd with our Discourse, and were very sure <HI>Loe</HI> and <HI>Russel</HI> were so too.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> then said, He liked it very well; but told me, I had not return'd Capt. <HI>Russel</HI> an Answer to what he last said, which he thought deserv'd one.</P>
<P>I answer'd, That since the Gentlemen were so good-natur'd, as not only to take in good Part what I had hitherto said, but also to give me free Liberty to pursue my Discourse, I should make Use of their Indulgence, and answer what Capt. <HI>Russel</HI> had said last to me, in as brief and inoffensive a Manner as I was capable of.</P>
<P><HI>Then turning to</HI> Russel, <HI>I said,</HI> Sir, Your Opi∣nion of my Notion of the Right you have to any Ship or Goods you may take, is exactly true; and I think your Right cannot extend farther than your Power to maintain that Right; and therefore it must follow, you can transfer no other Right to any one than what you have your selves, which will render any Person who receiv'd them, as guilty for detaining them from the proper Owners, as you for the taking them.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76"/>
<HI>He said,</HI> Be it so; we will suppose <HI>(and seem∣ed a little angry)</HI> for Argument Sake, we have taken a Ship, and are resolv'd to sink or burn her, unless you will accept of her: Now, pray, where is the Owner's Property, when the Ship is sunk, or burned? I think the Impossibility of his having her again, cuts off his Property to all Intents and Pur∣poses, and our Power was the same, notwithstand∣ing our giving her to you, if we had thought fit to make use of it.</P>
<P>I was loth to argue any farther, seeing him be∣gin to be peevish; and knowing, by the Infor∣mation afore given me by the three Men, that all his pretended Kindness and Arguments were only in order to detain me, without the Imputation of having broken their Articles; which he found the major Part of the Company very averse to; wherefore, to cut all short, I told him, I was very sensible of the Favours design'd me; and should always retain a grateful Sense of them: That I knew I was absolutely in their Power, and they might dispose of me as they pleas'd; but that having been hitherto treated so gene∣rously by them, I could not doubt of their fu∣ture Goodness to me: And that if they would be pleas'd to give me my Sloop again, it was all I requested at their Hands; and I doubted not, but that, by the Blessing of God on my honest Endeavours, I should soon be able to retrieve my present Loss; at least, I said, I should have nothing to reproach myself with, whatever should befal me, as I should have, if I were to comply with the Favour they had so kindly intended for me.</P>
<P><HI>Upon which, Capt.</HI> Loe <HI>said,</HI> Gentlemen, the Master, I must needs say, has spoke nothing but what is very reasonable, and I think he ought to have his Sloop. What do you say Gentlemen?</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="77"/>
The greatest Part of them answer'd aloud, <HI>Ay, Ay, by G—, let the poor Man have his Sloop again, and go in God's Name, and seek a Living in her for his Family. Ay,</HI> said some of them, <HI>and we ought to make something of a Gathering for the poor Man, since we have taken every Thing that he had on Board his Vessel.</HI> This put an End to the Dispute; and every Body talked accord∣ing to their Inclinations, the Punch, Wine, and Tobacco being moving Commodities all this Time: And every one who had an Opportunity of speaking to me, wish'd me much Joy with, and Success in, my newly obtain'd Sloop.</P>
<P>Towards Night, <HI>Russel</HI> told Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> that as the Company had agreed to give me the Sloop again, it was to be hoped they would discharge me, and let me go about my Business in a short Time; and therefore, with his Leave, he would take me on Board the Scooner with him, to treat me with a Sneaker of Punch before parting. Accordingly, I accompany'd him on Board his Vessel, tho' I had rather stay'd with <HI>Loe,</HI> and he welcomed me there, and made abundance of Protestations of his Kindness and Respect to me; but still argued, that he thought I was very much overseen in not accepting what he had so kindly, and out of pure Respect, offer'd to me, and which, he said, would really have been the making of me. I told him, I thank'd him for his Favour and Good-will; but was very well satisfy'd with the Company's Generosity in agree∣ing to give me the Sloop again, which, I said, was more satisfactory to me, than the richest Prize that they could take.</P>
<P>Well, says he, I wish it may prove according to your Expectation. I thank'd him; so down we went into the Cabbin, and, with the Officers
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
only, diverted ourselves in talking 'till Supper was laid on the Table.</P>
<P>After Supper, a Bowl of Punch, and half a Dozen of Claret, being set on the Table, Capt. <HI>Russel</HI> took a Bumper, and drank <HI>Success to their Undertaking;</HI> which went round, I not daring to refuse it. Next Health was <HI>Prosperity to Trade,</HI> meaning their own Trade. The third Health was, <HI>The King of France:</HI> After which, <HI>Russel</HI> began the <HI>King of</HI> England<HI>'s Health;</HI> so they all drank round, some saying, <HI>The King of</HI> England<HI>'s Health,</HI> others only <HI>The aforesaid Health,</HI> 'till it came round to me; and Capt. <HI>Russel</HI> having emp∣ty'd two Bottles of Claret into the Bowl, as a Recruit, and there being no Liquor that I have a greater Aversion to, than red Wine in Punch, I heartily begg'd the Captain and the Company would excuse my drinking any more of that Bowl, and give me leave to pledge the Health in a Bumper of Claret.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon</HI> Russel <HI>said,</HI> Damn you, you shall drink in your Turn a full Bumper of that Sort of Liquor that the Company does. Well, Gentlemen, <HI>said I,</HI> rather than have any Words about it, I will drink it, tho' it is in a Manner Poyson to me; be∣cause I never drank any of this Liquor, to the best of my Remembrance, but it made me sick two or three Days at least after it. And d—n you, <HI>says</HI> Russel, if it be in a Manner, or out of a Manner, or really, rank Poyson, you shall drink as much, and as often, as any one here, unless you fall down dead, dead!</P>
<P>So I took the Glass, which was one of your <HI>Hollands</HI> Glasses, made in the Form of a Beaker, without a Foot, holding about three Quarters of a Pint, and filling it to the Brim, said, <HI>Gentle∣men, here is the aforesaid Health. What Health is that,</HI> said <HI>Russel? Why,</HI> says I, <HI>the same</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
<HI>Health you all have drank, The King of</HI> England<HI>'s Health. Why,</HI> says <HI>Russel, who is King of</HI> Eng∣land? I answer'd, <HI>In my Opinion, he that wears the Crown, is certainly King while he keeps it. Well,</HI> says he, <HI>and pray who is that? Why,</HI> says I, <HI>King</HI> George <HI>at present wears it.</HI> Hereupon he broke out in the most outrageous Fury, damn∣ing me, and calling me Rascally Son of a B—; and abusing his Majesty in such a virulent Man∣ner, as is not fit to be repeated, asserting, with bitter Curses, that we had no King.</P>
<P>I said, <HI>I admir'd that he would begin and drink a Health to a Person who was not in being.</HI> Upon which, he whipp'd one of his Pistols from his Sash, and I really believe would have shot me dead, if the Gunner of the Scooner had not snatch'd it out of his Hand.</P>
<P>This rather more exasperated <HI>Russel,</HI> who continu'd swearing and cursing his Majesty in the most outrageous Terms, and asserting the Pre∣tender to be the lawful King of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. He added, That 'twas a Sin to suffer such a false traiterous Dog as I was to live; and with that whipp'd out another Pistol from his Sash, and cock'd it, and swore he would shoot me through the Head, and was sure he should do God and his Country good Service, by ridding the World of such a traiterous Villain. But the Master of the Scooner prevented him, by striking the Pistol out of his Hand.</P>
<P>Whether it was with the Fall, or his Finger being on the Trigger, I cannot tell, but the Pistol went off without doing any Damage: At which the Master, and all present, blamed <HI>Russel</HI> for being so rash and hasty; and the Gunner said, I was not to blame; for that I drank the Health as it was first propos'd, and there being no Names mention'd, and King <HI>George</HI> being
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
possess'd of the Crown, and establish'd by Au∣thority of Parliament, he did not see but his Title was the best. <HI>But what have we to do,</HI> continued he, <HI>with the Rights of Kings or Princes? Our Business here, is to chuse a King for our own Commonwealth; to make such Laws as we think most conducive to the Ends we design; and to keep ourselves from being overcome, and subjected to the Penalty of those Laws which are made against us.</HI> He then intimated to <HI>Russel,</HI> That he must speak his Sentiments freely, and imputed his Quarrel with me, to his being hinder'd from breaking thro' their Articles: Urging, that he would ap∣pear no better than an Infringer of their Laws, if the Matter were narrowly look'd into: And that it was impossible ever to have any Order or Rule observ'd, if their Statutes were once bro∣ken thro'. He put him in Mind of the Penalty, which was Death, to any one who should infringe their Laws; and urg'd, That if it were once admitted that a Man, thro' Passion, or the like, should be excused breaking in upon them, there would be an End to their Society: And con∣cluded with telling him, that it was an extraor∣dinary Indulgence in the Company, not to re∣mind him of the Penalty he had incurr'd.</P>
<P><HI>Russel,</HI> still continuing his Passion, answer'd, That if he had transgress'd, it was not for the Sake of his own private Interest, but for the ge∣neral Good of the Company; and therefore did not fear, neither in Justice could he expect, any Severity from the Company for what he had done; and for that Reason, whatever he (the Gunner) or those of his Sentiments, thought of it, he was resolv'd, whatever came of it, to pur∣sue his present Humour.</P>

<HI>Then says the Gunner to the rest,</HI> Well, Gentlemen, if you have a Mind to maintain those Laws made, establish'd, and sworn to by you all, as I think we are all obligated by the strongest Tyes of Reason and Self-Interest to do, I assure you, my Opinion is, that we ought to secure <HI>John Russel,</HI> so as to prevent his breaking our Laws and Consti∣tutions, and thereby do ourselves, and him too, good Service: Ourselves, by not suffering such an Acti∣on of Cruelty in cold Blood, as he more than once attempted to commit, as you are Eye-witnesses of, and, I believe, most on Board have been Ear-wit∣nesses to the Pistol's going off; and all this for no other Reason in the World, but through a proud and ambitious Humour, conceiting he is the Man that is not to be contradicted, and that his Words, though tending to our Ruin, must yet be receiv'd as an Ora∣cle, without any Opposition.</P>
<P>At which they all said, It was a pity the Ma∣ster should suffer, neither would they permit it; and speaking to <HI>Russel,</HI> they said, they would not allow him to be so barbarous: That they had always valued themselves upon this very Thing of being civil to their Prisoners, and not abusing their Persons: That, 'till now, he him∣self had been always the greatest Perswader to Clemency, and even to the forgiving Provocati∣ons, and permitting them to go from 'em with as little Loss as could be, after they had taken what they had Occasion for: <HI>But now,</HI> said they, <HI>you are quite the Reverse, to this poor Man, and for no other Reason, that we know of, but, as the Gunner said just now, because we would not yield a greater Power to you alone, then you with the whole Com∣pany have when conjoin'd; that is, that you at any Time, to gratify your own Humour, shall have Li∣berty, not only to dispense with our Laws, but to act against the Sentiments of the whole Company.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="82"/>
Russel <HI>answer'd, That he never did oppose the Company before; neither could he believe any present could charge him with any Cruelty in cold Blood, ever since he belong'd to the Com∣pany; but that he had a Reason for what he did, or would have done, if he had not been prevent∣ed. Hereupon the Master interrupting him, said,</HI> Capt. <HI>Russel,</HI> we know of no Reason for your passionate Design, but what we have told you; and, as you have been told before, it reflects a Revenge against the Company; but not being able to effect that, you turn it on that poor Man the Master of the Sloop, and, as it were, in despite of the Company, because they have decreed him his Sloop again, that he may provide a Living for his Family, you would barbarously, nay brutishly, as well as to the Compa∣ny contemptuously, murder that poor Man, who has given you no Occasion to induce you to such an Acti∣on that we know of; and if he has given you any sufficient Cause to be so offended at him, we promise you this Instant, to deliver him up to you, to suffer Death, or what other Punishment you think fit to inflict on him.</P>
<P><HI>Russel</HI> told them, That he had been in the Company almost from the first, and he challeng'd any one to charge him with Singularity, or Op∣position to the Company, or of Cruelty to any one Prisoner before that Rascal, as he call'd me, and that therefore they might be assur'd, he should not have taken up such Resentments a∣gainst me, if he had not a sufficient Reason to provoke him to it, which he did not think pro∣per at that Time to divulge.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>says the Gunner,</HI> neither do we think proper that you shall take any Man's Life away in cold Blood, 'till you think fit to acquaint the Com∣pany with the Reasons for it; and I think it was your Place to satisfy the Company, before you took
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
the Liberty to attempt the Life of any Man under the Company's Protection, as I think all Prisoners are: And, to say the Truth, I do verily believe, you have no other Reasons to give than those hinted by the Master and me; and therefore, I think it but Reason, to use such Methods as may prevent your passionate Design, and secure the Prisoner 'till Morn∣ing, and then send him on Board the Commodore, who, with the Advice of the Majority, may order the Matter as he thinks best.</P>
<P>This was consented to by all, and so <HI>Russel,</HI> having his Arms taken from him, was order'd not to offer the least Disturbance again, nor con∣cern himself with or about me, 'till after I was on Board the Commodore, on Pain of the Crew's Displeasure, and also of being prosecuted as a Mutineer; and the Gunner, Master, Boatswain, &amp;c. bid me not be discourag'd; assuring me, that there should no Harm come to me while I was on Board of them; and that they would send me away now, but that there is, said they, an express Order among us, to receive no Boats on Board after eight at Night, or nine a-Clock at farthest; but they would put me on Board Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> in the Morning, where they were sure I should be protected and secur'd from the re∣vengeful Hand of Capt. <HI>Russel;</HI> for they said, they were sure that Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> had a great Re∣spect for me, and would be a Means to counter∣ballance <HI>Russel;</HI> and they said they would sit up with me all Night for my greater Security: Which they did, smoaking and drinking and talking, eve∣ry one according to his Inclination, and so we pass'd the Time away 'till Day.</P>
<P><HI>Russel</HI> went to sleep about two a-Clock in the Morning in his Cabbin; however, the Master, the Gunner, and five or six more, did not go to Bed all that Night, but would have had me gone
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
to sleep, telling me, I need not fear, for they would take Care that <HI>Russel</HI> should not hurt me.</P>
<P>About eight a-Clock in the Morning, I was carry'd on Board Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> the Gunner and Steward going with me, who told him all that had pass'd; and acquainted him, that they still believ'd <HI>Russel</HI> to be so implacable against me, that he would murder me in cold Blood before I got clear of them, if he did not interpose to protect me from his Violence. Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> said, He very well knew, and he believ'd so did they all, what was the Reason that made <HI>Russel</HI> so in∣veterate and implacable to me: He added, That <HI>Russel</HI> did not do well; and that I had be∣hav'd myself so inoffensively, that there could be no Reason to induce the most savage Monster to be such an irreconcileable Enemy to me; but that 'twas an easy Matter to dive into the Cause of it, to wit, his being thwarted by the Compa∣ny in his Humour; and because they would not break thro' the Articles which cemented them together, and which were sign'd and swore to by them all, as the standing Rule of their Duty, by which only they could decide and settle Con∣troversies and Differences among themselves; the least Breach of which, would be a Precedent for the like Infractions, whenever <HI>Russel,</HI> or any other, thought fit to give Way either to Re∣venge or Ambition, and that then all their Counsels would be fluctuating; and Fancy, and not Reason, would be the Rule of their Con∣duct; and their Resolutions would be render'd more unconstant than the Weathercock. He added, That he hoped the Company would in∣violably adhere to their establish'd Laws, which, he said, were very good; and were they not, yet, as they were made by the unanimous Con∣sent of the whole Company, so they ought not
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
to be alter'd without the same unanimous Con∣sent; concluding, that, for his Part, he would rather chuse to be out of the Company than in it, if they did not resolve to be determin'd by their Articles. Hereupon they answer'd, That what he had said was very good, and they were resolv'd to adhere to his Advice.</P>
<P>After this they drank a Dram, and then re∣turn'd with their Boat on Board the Scooner; and Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> told me, he was sorry for Capt. <HI>Russel</HI>'s Disgust against me, because he believ'd it would be a Disadvantage to me; but, how∣ever, there was no Remedy but Patience; as∣suring me, That <HI>Russel</HI> should neither kill me, nor abuse my Person, and I should have my Sloop again, and be discharg'd in as short a while as possible, that I might be clear of <HI>Russel,</HI> who, he was afraid, would always continue my Foe.</P>
<P>All the Officers and Men likewise spoke very friendly to me, and bid me not be daunted; so we pass'd the Time away in several Kinds of Discourse 'till Dinner; after which, <HI>Loe</HI> order'd a Bowl of Punch to be made, and said he wish'd I was well clear of them.</P>
<P>About four a-Clock in the Afternoon Capt. <HI>Russel</HI> came on Board, as did also <HI>Francis Spriggs,</HI> who commanded the other Ship, and after a little while, says <HI>Russel</HI> to Capt. <HI>Loe, The Mate of the Sloop is willing to enter with us as a Volunteer.</HI></P>
<P>Loe <HI>made Answer, and said,</HI> How must we do in that Case? For then the Master of the Sloop will have no Body to help him, but one Boy; for, <HI>says</HI> he, the little Child is no Help at all.</P>
<P>Russel <HI>said,</HI> He could not help that. But, <HI>said</HI> Loe, we must not take all the Hands from the poor Men, if we design to give him his Sloop again;
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>
<HI>adding,</HI> That he thought in Reason there could not be less than two Boys and the Mate.</P>
<P>Z—ds, <HI>says</HI> Russel, his Mate is a lusty young brisk Man, and has been upon the Account before, and told me but even now, (for, <HI>said he,</HI> I was on Board the Sloop but just before I came here, and <HI>Frank Spriggs</HI> was along with me, and heard him say,) That he was fully resolv'd to go with us, and would not go any more in the Sloop, unless forced; and when he came out of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> he said, his Design was to enter himself on Board the first Pyrate that he met with; and will you refuse such a Man, contrary to your Articles, which you all so much profess to follow; and which enjoin you by all Means, not repugnant to them, to encrease and fill your Company? Besides, <HI>continued he,</HI> he spoke to me the first Day, that he was resolv'd is enter with us.</P>
<P><HI>Loe</HI> reply'd, That to give the Man his Sloop, and no Hands with him to assist him, was but putting him to a lingering Death, and they had as good almost knock him on the Head, as do it.</P>
<P><HI>Russel</HI> answer'd, As to that, they might do as they pleas'd; what he spoke now was for the Good of the whole Company, and agreeable to the Articles, and he would fain see or hear that Man that should oppose him in it. He said, He was Quarter-Master of the whole Company, and, by the Authority of his Place, he would enter the Mate directly, and had a Pistol ready for the Man that should oppose him in it.</P>
<P><HI>Loe</HI> said, As for what was the Law and Cu∣stom among them (as what he now pleaded, was) he would neither oppose, nor argue against; but, if they thought fit to take the Man's Mate from him, then they might let him have one of his own Men with him.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="87"/>
Russel <HI>said, No; for all the Sloop's Men were already enroll'd in their Books, and therefore none of them should go in her again.</HI> Gentlemen, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> you must consider I am now arguing, as well for the Good of the Company, as for the due Maintenance and Execution of the Laws and Articles; and as I am the proper Officer substituted and intrusted by this Company with Authority to execute the same, so (as I told you before) I have a Pistol and a Brace of Balls ready for any one, who dare oppose me herein; <HI>and turning to me, said,</HI> Master, the Company has decreed you your Sloop, and you shall have her; you shall have your two Boys, and that is all: You shall have neither Provisions, nor any Thing else, more than as she now is. And, I hear, there are some of the Compa∣ny design to make a Gathering for you; but that also I forbid, by the Authority of my Place, be∣cause we are not certain but we may have Occasion ourselves for those very Things before we get more; and for that Reason I prohibit a Gathering; and I swear by all that is Great and Good, that if I know any Thing whatsoever carry'd, or left on Board the Sloop against my Order, or without my Knowledge, that very Instant I will set her on Fire, and you in her.</P>
<P>Upon which I said, that since it was their Pleasure to order it thus, I begged that they would not put me on Board the Sloop in such a Condition; but rather begg'd, if they so pleas'd, to do what they would with the Sloop, and put me, and my two Boys, ashore on one of the Islands.</P>
<P><HI>Russel</HI> said, No; for they were to Leeward of all the Islands, and should hardly come near any of them this Season again.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="88"/>
I said, I should rather be put ashore any where else, either on the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> or on what∣ever Coast they came at first, than be put as a Victim on Board the Sloop; where I should have no Possibility of any Thing but perishing, except by an extraordinary Miracle.</P>
<P>He told me, My Fate was already decreed by the Company, and he, by his Place, was to see all their Orders put in Execution; and he would accordingly see me safely put on Board the Sloop, in the exact Condition as he had but now men∣tion'd.</P>
<P>I was going to make him a Reply, but casting my Eye on Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> he wink'd at me to be si∣lent; and taking a Bumper, drank Success to their Proceedings. The Health went round, and <HI>Loe</HI> order'd the great Bowl to be fill'd with Punch, and Bottles of Wine to be set on the Table in the Cabbin, to which we all resorted, and spent the remaining Part of the Evening in Discourses on different Subjects: Only <HI>Frank Spriggs</HI> offer'd to perswade me to accept of what was first offer'd me, which <HI>Russel</HI> swore I should not now have, I having not once, but several Times already refus'd it. Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> not being then willing to have any more of that Kind of Discourse, broke it off by singing a Song, and enjoining every one present to do the same, ex∣cept me, whom he said he would excuse 'till Times grew better with me: And thus they di∣verted themselves, and pass'd the Evening away 'till towards eight a-Clock, and then every one repair'd on Board their respective Ships; and, after they were gone, <HI>Loe</HI> and I, and two or three of his Confidents, smoak'd a Pipe, and drank a Bottle or two of Wine; in which Time he told me, He was very sorry that <HI>Jack Russel</HI> was so set against me. I said, So was I, and
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
wonder'd what should be the Reason of it, hav∣ing given him no Cause, unless by drinking that Health the preceding Night: I said, I had im∣puted to Liquor, the Fury he was then in, and was in Hopes, that after that had work'd off, his Resentments also would have cooled, and was not a little concern'd to find it otherwise. <HI>Loe</HI> said, The Health was not the Cause, but rather the Effect of his Anger, and a meer Pretence to cloak his Resentment for other Disappointments: Adding, That I did right to take his Hint given me by winking, to answer no more; <HI>For,</HI> says he, <HI>I knew that every Thing which you could speak to him, would be taken Edge-ways; and the more you said to excuse yourself, the more it would add Fuel to his Anger, which he turn'd against you who could not resist him, because he could not have his Will of us; but we will endeavour to draw him off by Degrees; and for that Reason will not dis∣charge you, but I will keep you on Board with me, where he shall not hurt nor abuse you, except with his Tongue, which you must bear, 'till we see if we can alter his Temper, so as to deal with you a little more favourable than at present he designs.</HI></P>
<P>I thank'd him, and all of them present, for their Favours and Good-will, and it being near Midnight, we parted, and every one retired to his Rest, and I to my Hammock; and being pretty much fatigued the Night before, as well as the preceding Day, soon fell asleep; and about Day-dawning, I got up, and came upon Deck, and walking upon the Quarter Deck very solitary, one of the three Men, mention'd before, pass'd by me, and ask'd me how I did, and said he was very sorry for the Unkindness already shew'd me, and like to be shew'd; but it was what they expected, as they had before hinted to me, and that still there was like to be a tough
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
Struggle about me: That <HI>Russel</HI> did design to be very barbarous to me, and that <HI>Loe,</HI> and a great Part of the Company, intended to oppose him in it; that there were a great many who were <HI>Russel</HI>'s Gang or Clan, and design'd to stand by him in it, and had threaten'd, that if there were much Disturbance about it, they would shoot me, and so put an End to the Controversy: That there were some, on the other Hand, that threaten'd hard if they did, to revenge my Death by some of theirs; so that it was likely to be an untoward Touch, and he wish'd it might not prove to my Disadvantage in the End; but would have me still to keep a good Heart, and trust in God, and hope for the best, and by no means to speak one Word, or concern myself either Way, but patiently wait the Issue, which he hoped would be better for me than some of them intended; and so heartily wishing me well, walk'd his Way.</P>
<P>Now you must believe these Accounts were not a little shocking to me; but I had no Friend that I could really rely on, but God, to whom I made my Petitions, and whose Assistance I hum∣bly besought, to extricate me, in his own good Time, out of these Difficulties and Snares which were laid for me on every Side, and, in the mean Time, patiently so to bear them, as not to murmur and repine at his fatherly Chastise∣ments, nor, by their Extremity, through Despe∣ration, wound my Conscience; but that in all Things I might, through the Guidance of the holy Spirit, be directed so as to submit myself entirely to his Will, who infinitely knew what was better for me than I knew myself.</P>
<P>After some Time pass'd, Capt. <HI>Loe</HI> came upon Deck, who ask'd me how I had rested the pre∣ceding Night? I told him, Very well, considering
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
my present Case; but, next under God, had grounded my Hopes upon him, to rid me of my present Fears, by dispatching me away as soon as possible he could with Conveniency. He told me, He would do every Thing in his Power to further my Desires, and hoped that what he had already done on my Account, would sufficiently convince me of his Desire to serve me; but that Things hitherto had fallen out very unluckily and cross, as I myself was able to judge by what was already pass'd.</P>
<P>I told him, I had very good Reasons to re∣turn him my hearty Thanks, and own'd myself bound to him in the strictest Ties of Gratitude; and that if it ever should be in my Power to serve him, I would not content myself with bare Acknowledgments of his Favour.</P>
<P>He said, His Will was at present more exten∣sive than his Power; but that he still hoped to prevail with <HI>Russel,</HI> and those who were of his Side, to be more compassionate to me before I parted with them, than at present they seem'd to intend, and as soon as he had brought them to a better Temper, he then would procure my Discharge; but if <HI>Russel</HI> still continu'd inexora∣ble, which he should be very sorry for, then you must endeavour, says he, to keep up a good Heart, and patiently wait 'till Providence brings you out of your present Calamities, which I hope he will.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, and told him, I would endea∣vour to follow his Advice, tho', I said, 'twas with some Impatience that I waited to have my Doom determin'd in a Discharge from them. He bid me be easy, it should be shortly.</P>
<P>By this Time there were several join'd with us, so we broke off that Discourse, and fell into other Talk.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="92"/>
About two or three a-Clock in the Afternoon, Capt. <HI>Russel,</HI> Capt. <HI>Spriggs,</HI> and some of their Officers, came on Board, and held a Consulta∣tion, which I was not allow'd to be a Hearer of; but understood afterwards, 'twas chiefly about their own Affairs, in Relation to the further Pro∣secution of their intended Voyage; and by the little mention that was made of me, it appear'd, that <HI>Russel</HI> continu'd still inflexible, bitterly swearing, that he would, if he had a thousand Lives, lose them all, rather than miscarry in this his fix'd Resolution.</P>
<P>In this difficult Situation I stood, not daring to speak freely for fear of offending, nor be si∣lent, lest I should be thought contemptuous; not knowing how to avoid their Resentments, and every Resentment menacing, and often bring∣ing Death. And thus I tediously, as well as dangerously, pass'd my Time among them, un∣til it pleas'd God to put it into their Hearts to discharge me; tho', if seriously weigh'd, this my Discharge seem'd like sentencing me to a lingering and miserable Death; yet I must needs confess, considering the whole Matter, that I was in a Manner miraculously befriended and sup∣ported, even in spite of Malice, Rage, and Re∣venge, for which I shall always pay my humble Acknowledgements to the Divine Providence.</P>
<P>After several Efforts made by Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> and others, and abundance of Arguments used to bring <HI>Russel</HI> to better Temper relating to me; and finding it all to no Purpose, and that some of his Clan had bound themselves by Oath to stand by him, even to my Destruction, if the Dispute continu'd much longer; Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Spriggs,</HI> and others, who were my Friends, resolv'd on sending me away as soon as possible; and for that Purpose <HI>Loe,</HI> the 10th Day after I
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
was taken, made a Signal for a general Consul∣tation on Board of him; and as soon as the Offi∣cers and leading Men of the other two Ships, were assembled, he made a Speech to them, to let them know the Reason of his calling them to a Consultation, telling them, <HI>That he thought it was Time to discharge me, as they had before agreed, as also to prosecute their intended Voyage, they hav∣ing lain a long Time driving; and that, altogether out of their Way, by Reason they could not expect, either here, or in this Drift, to meet with any Ships.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To this they all agreeing, Capt.</HI> Loe <HI>told them,</HI> He thought it would be best to discharge me first, for several Reasons, among which, my being cum∣bersome to them, as well as unserviceable, they be∣ing forc'd to sail the Sloop themselves; besides, he said it was not proper that I should be made ac∣quainted with the Design of their Voyage.</P>
<P><HI>They ask'd,</HI> Why he did not turn me away? <HI>Saying,</HI> They did not know for what Reason I had been kept so long, the Company having settled that Matter so long since.</P>
<P><HI>Capt.</HI> Loe <HI>said,</HI> Gentlemen, you all know what Arguments we have had already about this Matter, and how Capt. <HI>Russel,</HI> and some more, were angry with the Master of the Sloop, and, I verily believe, without any Cause by him given to any of you de∣signedly; and therefore, I hope you have consider'd better of it since, and laid aside your Resentments against the poor Man; neither, <HI>said he,</HI> let us do any Thing now in Passion, for I do not design (nor would I, if I could) to inforce any of you to com∣ply to any Thing against your Will; nor would I have you think, Gentlemen, that I shall ever shew so much Respect to any Prisoner, as, on his Ac∣count, to cause a Difference or Wrangling among our¦selves; but yet, Gentlemen, give me Leave to say,
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
That tho' we are Pirates, yet we are Mon, and tho' we are deem'd by some People dishonest, yet let us not wholly divest ourselves of Humanity, and make ourselves more Savage than Brutes. If we send this poor Man away from us, without Provisi∣ons or Hands to assist him, Pray what greater Cru∣elty can there be? I think the more lingering any Death is made, the more barbarous 'tis accounted by all Men; and therefore, Gentlemen, I leave it to your own Consideration.</P>
<P><HI>To this,</HI> Russel <HI>made answer,</HI> That he, in the Company's Name, had made the Master of the Sloop very good and generous Offers, in the Hearing of all the Company; but that I had, in his Opinion, after a very slighting Manner, refus'd them: That 'twas my Choice to be sent thus on Board the Sloop, rather than the Compulsion of the Company; and that, not∣withstanding he told me what I must trust to by insisting on the Sloop, and how favourable they were design'd to be to me, if I would have but a little Patience 'till they could provide for me, yet that I had refus'd their Favours, notwithstanding the Pains he took to perswade me; <HI>adding an egregious Fal∣shood, (but I durst not tell him so)</HI> That I had petition'd and begg'd of the Company, rather to be put in the Sloop in the Condition he now propos'd for me, and that therefore, according to my Desire, it should be so; and he hoped it could never be reckon'd Cruelty in them to give a Person his free Choice. And, Gentlemen, <HI>says he,</HI> we have had a great many more Words about this Matter already, than ever we had in the like Case before; but I hope you all have so much Value and Respect for one another, and for the general Peace, as that we shall have no more Debate on this Head, but determine at once the Time when he is to be discharg'd, the Manner of it being already settled by the major Part, and I as your Quarter-master, as my Office requires, will
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
see it executed, and, perhaps, in a more favourable Manner than at first I design'd, or he really de∣serves at mine or your Hands either; but let that rest there.</P>
<P><HI>Then Capt.</HI> Loe <HI>said,</HI> Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> hath spoke to you, Gentlemen, his Sentiments, which, in the main, are reasonable and true, and I am glad he is reconcil'd to the Master of the Sloop before their parting; and, I cannot say, but I always believ'd <HI>Jack Russel</HI> to be a Man of so much Sense, as well as Good-nature, that he would scorn to take Revenge on one whose Condition render'd him uncapable of helping himself. And I think, Gentlemen, we may discharge him as soon as you please, and this After∣noon, if you are all agreed to it. <HI>They all said</HI> Ay. <HI>Upon which</HI> Russel <HI>told them, it should be done that Afternoon; telling</HI> Loe, That after Dinner he would take me on Board the Scooner with him, and, from thence, send me on Board the Sloop, and see what could be done for me.</P>
<P><HI>Some of</HI> Loe<HI>'s Company said,</HI> They would look out some Things, and give me along with me when I was going away; <HI>but</HI> Russel <HI>told them,</HI> they should not, for he would toss them all into <HI>Davy Jones</HI>'s <HI>Locker</HI> if they did; for I was the Scooner's Prize, and she had all my Cargo and Plunder on Board of her, and therefore what was given to me should be given to me out of her: <HI>And turning to me said,</HI> Well, Master, I will this Evening put you on Board your own Sloop, and will be a better Friend to you, perhaps, than them that pretended a great deal more; but I am above being led by Passion, &amp;c. <HI>They all din'd on Board of</HI> Loe, <HI>who, after Dinner, order'd a Bowl of Punch to be made in the great Silver Bowl, and set a Dozen of Claret on the Table, and that they said was for me to take my Leave of them, and part Sailor-like. I thank'd them; so they drank</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
<HI>round to my good Success, and then to their own fortunate Proceedings and good Success; and</HI> Loe <HI>told me,</HI> He wish'd me very well, and hoped to meet with me again, at some Time when they had a good Prize of rich Goods, and he would not fail to make me a Retaliation with good Advan∣tage for my present Loss. <HI>And they all present said,</HI> I need not fear meeting with a Friend, when∣ever I met with them again.</P>
<P>About duskish, they began to prepare to go on Board their Ships, and I took my Leave of Capt. <HI>Loe,</HI> and all his Ship's Company, and in particular of the three Men, who, I believe, were my hearty Friends, and return'd them all Thanks for their Kindness, as well as good Hu∣mour, shew'd to me since my first coming on Board of them. I also took my Leave of Capt. <HI>Spriggs,</HI> and those of his Company who were present, wish'd me well, but not one of them, I believe, dar'd to give me any Lumher with me, nor durst I have accepted of it had they offer'd it, for Fear of angering my but newly and seem∣ingly reconcil'd Enemy, who, in all Likelihood, would have taken from me whatever they would have given me: And for that Reason I believe it was, that none of them offer'd to give me a Farthing, notwithstanding all their Professions of Kindness to me; tho' this Generosity is very usual with them, to People that they profess much less Favour for, than they did to me.</P>
<P><HI>Russel</HI> being ready, I was order'd to go in his Boat, which I did; and, as soon as we were come on Board the Scooner, he order'd a Sup∣per to▪ be got ready, and, in the mean Time, there was a Bowl of Punch made, and some Wine set on the Table. <HI>Russel</HI> invited me down into the Cabbin, as also all his Officers, and we drank and smoak'd 'till Supper was brought, and
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
then he told me I was very welcome, and bid me eat and drink heartily; <HI>For,</HI> he said▪ <HI>I had as tedious a Voyage to go through, as</HI> Elijah<HI>'s forty Days Journey was to Mount</HI> Horeb, <HI>and, as far as he knew, without a Miracle, it must only be by the Strength of what I eat now; for I should have neither Eatables nor Drinkables with me in the Sloop.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I hoped not so: <HI>He rapt out a great Oath,</HI> That I should find it certainly true. <HI>I told him,</HI> That rather than be put on Board the Sloop, in that Manner, where there was no Possibi∣lity to escape perishing, without a Miracle, I would submit to tarry on Board, 'till an Opportunity of∣fer'd to put me ashore where they pleas'd; or would yield to any Thing else they should think fit to do with me, excepting to enter into their Service.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> It was once in my Power to have been my own Friend; but my slighting their proffer'd Favours, and my own chusing what I now must cer∣tainly accept, had render'd me uncapable of any other Choice; and that therefore all Apologies were but in vain; and he thought he shew'd himself more my Friend than I could well expect, or than I had deserv'd at his Hands, having caused him to have a great deal of Difference with the Company, more than ever he had in his Life before, or ever should have again, he hoped.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I was very sorry that I was so un∣fortunate as to be the unhappy Occasion of it; but could from my Heart aver, that it was not only un∣design'd, but also sorely against my Inclinations; <HI>and begg'd of him, and all the Gentlemen then present,</HI> to consider me as an Object rather of their Pity, than of their Revenge.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> All my Arguments and Perswasions now were in vain, it being too late: I had not only refus'd their Commiseration when I was offer'd it,
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
but ungratefully despis'd it: Therefore, <HI>says he,</HI> as I told you before, it's in vain for you to plead any more: Your Lot is cast, and you have nothing now to do, but to go through with your Chance as well as you can, and fill your Belly with good Victu∣als and good Drink, to strengthen you to hold it as long as you can: It may be, and is very probable to be, the last Meal that ever you may eat in this World: However, perhaps, such a Conscientious Man as you would fain seem, or it may be are, may have a supernatural, or, at least, a natural Means wrought by a supernatural Power, in a mi∣raculous Manner, to deliver you. However, I cannot say but I pity the two Boys, and have a great Mind to take them on Board, and let thé miraculous Deliverance be wrought on you alone.</P>
<P><HI>The Master and Gunner said,</HI> They heard the Boys say, they were willing to take their Chance with their Master, let it be what it would. Nay, then, <HI>says</HI> Russel, it's fit they should. I suppose their Master has made them as religious and as con∣scientious as himself. However, Master, <HI>says</HI> Rus∣sel, <HI>(speaking to me)</HI> I would have you eat and drink heartily, and talk no more about changing your allotted Chance; because, as I told you before, it is all in vain; besides, it may be a Means of Provocation to serve you worse.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, <HI>says I,</HI> I have done: I will say no more; you can do no more than God is pleas'd to permit you; and I own, for that Reason, I ought to take it patiently.</P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>says</HI> Russel, if it be done by God's Permission, you need not fear that he will permit any Thing hurtful to befall so good a Man as you are.</P>
<P><HI>About ten a-Clock at Night, he order'd to call the Sloop's Boat, which was brought by some of the Pirates of his own Clan, who were</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
<HI>station'd on Board of her, and ask'd them,</HI> If they had done as he had order'd them, <HI>viz.</HI> to clear the Sloop of every Thing? <HI>And they said</HI> Yes, <HI>rap∣ing out a great Oath or two, adding,</HI> She had nothing on Board except Ballast and Water. Z—ds, <HI>said</HI> Russel, did not I bid you stave all the Casks that had Water in them on Board? So we did, <HI>said they;</HI> but the Water that we spoke of was Salt∣water, leak'd in by the Vessel, and is now above the Ballast; for we have not pump'd her we do not know when.</P>
<P><HI>Said</HI> Russel, Have you brought away the Sails I told you of? <HI>They said,</HI> All but the Mainsail that was bent, for the other old Mainsail that he had order'd to be left, was good for nothing but to cut up for Parceling, and hardly for that, it was so rotten; besides, it was so torn, that it could not be brought too, and was past mending, and for that Reason they let it lie, and would not unbend the other Mainsail.</P>
<P>Z—ds, <HI>says</HI> Russel, we must have it, for I want it to make us a Mainsail. D—n it, <HI>said the Men,</HI> then you must turn the Man adrift in the Sloop with∣out a Mainsail.</P>
<P>Pish, <HI>said</HI> Russel, the same miraculous Power that is to bring him Provisions, can also bring him a Sail.</P>
<P>What a Devil, is he a Conjurer? <HI>said one of them.</HI></P>
<P>No, no, <HI>says</HI> Russel, but he expects Miracles to be wrought for him, or he never would have chosen what he hath.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, <HI>said they,</HI> if he be such a one, he will do well enough; but I doubt, <HI>says one of them,</HI> he will fall short of his Expectation; for if he be such a mighty Conjurer, how the Devil was it that he did not conjure himself clear of us?</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="100"/>
Pish, <HI>said another,</HI> it may be his conjuring Books were shut up. Ay, but, <HI>said another,</HI> now we have hove all his Conjuration Books over Board, I doubt he will be hard put to it to find them again.</P>
<P>Come, come, <HI>says the Gunner,</HI> Gentlemen, the poor Man is like to go through Hardship enough, and very probably may perish; yet it is not impossible but he may meet with some Ship, or other timely Suc∣cour, to prevent his perishing, and I heartily wish he may; but however, you ought not to add Af∣fliction to the Afflicted; You have sentenc'd him to a very dangerous Chance, which I think is sufficient to stop your Mouths from making a Droll and Game of him. I would have you consider, <HI>added he,</HI> if any of you were at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> or any other Place to be executed, as many better and stouter Men than some of you, have been, and the Spectators, or <HI>Jack Catch</HI> should make a Droll and May-game of you, you would think them a very hard-hearted, as well as an inconsiderate Sort of People: And pray, Gentlemen, consider the Sentence which you are now going to execute on this poor Man, will be as bad, or rather worse, than one of our Cases would be there; because, unless Providence stand his Friend in an extraordinary Manner, his Death must as cer∣tainly ensue or be the Consequence of this your Sen∣tence, as it would there be to any of us by the Sen∣tence of a Judge, and so much the more miserable, by how much it is more lingering.</P>
<P>Damn it, <HI>said</HI> Russel, we have had enough, and too much of this already.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>said the Gunner,</HI> and take Care, <HI>Russel,</HI> you have not this to answer for one Day, when per∣haps you will then, but too late, wish you had ne∣ver done it. But you have got the Company's As∣sent in this, I cannot tell how, and therefore I shall say no more, only that I, as I believe most of the Company, came here to get Money, but not to kill,
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
except in Fight, and not in cold Blood, or for pri∣vate Revenge. And I tell you, <HI>John Russel,</HI> if ever such Cases as these be any more practis'd, my Endeavour shall be to leave this Company as soon as I possibly can.</P>
<P>To which <HI>Russel</HI> said nothing in Answer; but bid the Men that came on Board in the Boat, to leave the Sloop's Boat on Board the Scooner, and take the Scooner's Boat with them on Board the Sloop; and, as soon as they saw the Lights upon Deck on Board of the Scooner, to come away from the Sloop with the Scooner's Boat, and bring the Master of the Sloop's biggest Boy with them; and to take their Hands out of the Sloop's Boat, and put the Master's Boy on Board of the Sloop's Boat with his Master, and let them go on Board themselves with their Boat, and to be sure to bring the Sloop's Mainsail with them, and also the Mate of the Sloop. All which they said they would do; so away they went; and then <HI>Russel</HI> told me, <HI>He would give me something with me to remember him;</HI> which was an old Musket, and a Cartridge of Powder, but for what Reason he made me that Present, I cannot tell; and then order'd the Candles to be lighted in the Lanthorns and carry'd upon Deck, and order'd two Hands to step into the Sloop's Boat to carry me away, and to execute his for∣mer Orders; and then shaking Hands with me, he wish'd me a good Voyage. I told him I hoped I should. The Gunner, Master, and several of the Crew, shook Hands with me also, and hear∣tily wish'd me Success, and hoped I should meet with a speedy and safe Deliverance. I thank'd them for their good Wishes; and told them I was now forc'd into a Necessity of going through it, whether I would or not; but thank'd God I was very easy at present, not doubting in God's
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
Mercy to me, tho' I was not deserving of it: And that if I was permitted to perish, I knew the worst; and doubted not but he would graci∣ously pardon my Sins, and receive me to his Everlasting Rest; and, in this Respect, what they had intended for my Misfortune, would be the Beginning of my Happiness; and that in the mean Time, I had nothing to do but to resign myself to his blessed Will and Protection, and bear my Lot with Patience. And so bidding them farewell, I went over the Side into the Boat, which was directly put off; and about half Way between the Scooner and Sloop, we met the Scooner's Boat, and, according to their Orders from <HI>Russel,</HI> they put my Boy on Board of me, and so put away again to get on Board their own Vessel.</P>
<P>After their Boat put away from us, I thought I heard the Voice of my Mate, but was not cer∣tain, because he spoke so low, his Conscience checking him, I suppose, for his leaving me so basely. I call'd to him, and said Arthur, <HI>what are you going to leave me?</HI> He answer'd, <HI>Ay. What,</HI> said I, <HI>do you do it voluntary, or are you forc'd?</HI> He answer'd faintly, <HI>I am forc'd, I think.</HI> I said, <HI>It was very well.</HI> He call'd to me again, and said, <HI>He would desire me to write to his Bro∣ther, and give him an Account where he was, if ever I should have an Opportunity.</HI> I told him, <HI>I did not know where his Brother liv'd.</HI> He called and said, <HI>He liv'd in</HI> Carlingford. I told him, <HI>I did not know where that was.</HI> He said, <HI>It was in</HI> Ireland. <HI>Why,</HI> said I, <HI>you told me in</HI> Barbadoes <HI>that you was a</HI> Scotchman, <HI>and that all your Friends liv'd in</HI> Scotland. But he made me no further Answer; but away they row'd towards their Vessel, and I towards the Sloop, and it be∣ing a very dark, as well as a close Night, it was
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
as much as ever I could do to see her; this be∣ing the last Time that I spoke to, or saw any of them, nor do I ever more desire to see them, ex∣cept at some Place of Execution.</P>
<P>I shipp'd this Man at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and he told me then, that he had been Mate of a Sloop be∣longing to some Part of <HI>New-England,</HI> but was shipwreck'd, and lost every Thing; and was al∣most naked when I first met with him, not hav∣ing a Shirt, or any Thing else of Cloathing, to shift in the Room of what he had on, 'till they were wash'd, neither had he any Money; but was out of Debt there I believe, because I ne∣ver heard of any Body's coming after him for any Demands that Way, as is usual for Land∣lords, &amp;c. in those Parts in such Cases; for as soon as any of their Lodgers or Debtors are shipp'd on Board any Vessel, they make it their Business to find out the Master, and acquaint him with their being Creditor to such a Person; and in Presence of the said Person procure a Promise, if they can, from the Master to keep their Wages, as they shall become due, in his Hands, or, at least, so much as amounts to the Debt, 'till his Return there, obliging the Debtor to assign over to the Master an Order to autho∣rise him so to do, otherwise they will not suffer him to go off the Island. I bought him Cloaths and Instruments, with such other Necessaries as I thought might be absolutely requisite for him to the Performance of the Voyage. I observ'd no∣thing in him tending to any of the common Vices, too common among Seafareing Men, es∣pecially those who have frequented these Parts; to wit, Swearing, Drunkenness, Debauchery, &amp;c. He was a pretended rigid Presbyterian, and seem'd mighty averse to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as establish'd by Law, about which we had seve∣ral
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
Arguments. I do not remember, all the Time that he was with me, to have heard him swear; and yet, as my biggest Boy told me, af∣ter he had acquainted the Pirates of his Resolu∣tion, (or rather return'd to be a Pirate again, as he by his own Discourse to them manifested) then, it seems, he far exceeded the most profli∣gate of them, both in the Frequency and Hor∣ribleness of them; and, as my Boys told me, was almost constantly drunk, while on Board the Sloop, after the Pirates had taken me.</P>
<P>But to proceed: My Boy and I got on Board the Sloop, and found neither Fire, nor Candle, nor any Thing that we knew of on Board to make the one or the other. I could hear the Water which the Sloop had in her, by her Mo∣tion with the Sea, rowl from one Side to the other, as if she had been almost full of Water: I ask'd the Boys when she had been last pump'd, and whether she had been then suck'd dry; they told me, She had not been pump'd these three Days past, and that she had then been suck'd dry; and they said they would have pump'd her several Times since, but the Pirates swore at them, and would not let them, saying, Damn her, let her sink and be damn'd, they had a Boat on Board sufficient to carry them all to their own Ships; and agreed to have cut a Hole through her, or fire several Shot through her Bottom as that Night, in order to sink her, and with the Boat to go all on Board their own Vessel; and were consulting about the Manner of doing it, just as the Scooner call'd for them to send the Sloop's Boat on Board; and they verily believ'd she had been quitted, if not sunk by this Time, if they had been let alone.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="105"/>
I made fast a Rope to the Mast for a Mainrope, and went down in the Hold to see what Quantity of Water was in the Sloop, and finding it not above a Foot above the Ballast, I was a little en∣courag'd, though that was dismal enough, but yet nothing nigh so bad as at first I thought it was; for, indeed, by the Noise that the Water made, with the Motion the Sea gave the Vessel, I thought she had been half full at least; but finding it better than I expected, I was in Hopes to free her; and when once freed, we had little Reason of doubting, but what we should be able, while our Strength held out, to keep her so, 'till it pleas'd God to send us some Succour.</P>
<P>I came upon Deck, and ask'd <HI>Potter,</HI> my big∣gest Boy, if the Pumps were in order, or whe∣ther the Pirates had broke or put them out of order? He said, he thought not; so I went to work with them, being the only Way to know; I put the two Boys to one Pump, and I exer∣cis'd the other; I bid them not strike with the Pump, but to draw a long drawing Stroke, which in a Manner delivers as much Water as striking, especially when there are not Hands to <HI>Spell</HI> (that is, to take Turns while the others recover Breath) besides, it doth not tire so soon, and consequent∣ly would not make them so drowthy as striking would. I inquir'd what drinking Water they had on Board. <HI>Potter</HI> told me, he believ'd there was not one Drop of fresh Water on Board, be∣cause, he said, all that was in the Sloop, except one Hogshead, was sent on Board the Pirates; and after they came from on Board the Scooner, the two Men that went in the Boat said, Capt. <HI>Russel</HI> order'd them to stave that, and not leave one Drop of fresh Water on Board the Sloop. <HI>But, Sir,</HI> said he, <HI>I think they have done as bar∣barously by us in another Respect, as in leaving us</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
<HI>without Provisions. Ay,</HI> said I, <HI>What is that? Why,</HI> said he, <HI>they have taken all our Sails, except the Jib and old Foresail that is bent, and that old Mainsail that is good for nothing, it is so rotten. What,</HI> said I, <HI>have they serv'd us so,</HI> (making as tho' I had known nothing of the Matter, neither did I but of the Mainsail, which <HI>Russel</HI> order'd them to unbend, and bring away with them when they came away from the Sloop.) <HI>Well,</HI> says I, <HI>never fear, Boy, I trust in God we shall do well enough still, in despight of all their Malice. Ay, Ay, Sir,</HI> says the Boy, <HI>I do not fear it, and am heartily glad we are got clear of them. They often ask'd me to enter, and go along with them, but I would rather chuse to go with a</HI> Turk <HI>or</HI> In∣fidel: <HI>Besides, was I sure to perish, I could not leave you, when I consider how kind you have been to me, and shall never forget it while I live: And I wonder,</HI> says he, <HI>that Mr.</HI> Hunter <HI>(i. e.</HI> the Mate) <HI>should be so barbarous to leave you in this Extremity, as some of the Pirates here on Board told him, for he had acquainted them how kind you had been to him, and they refus'd at first to enter him; and I believe they would not have let him enter, if it had not been for Capt.</HI> Russel.</P>
<P>I shall take Leave briefly to mention in this Place some Account of this Boy: His Name is <HI>Potter;</HI> and he had serv'd his Time to a Potter at <HI>Kingston upon Thames,</HI> and after, in a youth∣ful Frolick, inconsiderately took a Fancy to go to Sea, and in order thereto spoke to a Man who pretended to be a <HI>Crimp, i. e.</HI> one that used to provide Sailors with Voyages, Boys to Ma∣sters, &amp;c. and who undertook to help him to one. This Fellow so manag'd the Matter, as to bind him a Plantation-Servant for <HI>America</HI> for the Term of five Years; and after the Boy was put on Board the Ship, and found how he had been
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
trapann'd, he began to repent of his Voyage; but they made him believe they were at very great Charges for the <HI>Crimp</HI>'s Trouble and Pains, and for his Lodging, Diet, &amp;c. which they en∣hanc'd to such a Sum, as they thought was above his Purse, and demanded to be reimburs'd of, before his Acquittal; so that for want of Friends, or thro' Shame to apply himself to them, he was forc'd to acquiesce, and was carry'd to <HI>Bar∣badoes,</HI> where he was to be sold; and I under∣standing the Lad's unhappy Case, upon his Prayers, and Promises what a good and faithful Servant he would be, I bought his Time, and paid twelve Pounds for him of that Country Money: And, indeed, I always found him, not only true and faithful to my Interest, but af∣fectionate to my Person, insomuch, that it rais'd my Value for him, so that I look'd upon him rather as a Child or Relation, than as a bare Servant.</P>
<P>But to return: In this Manner we pump'd and talk'd, sometimes the one, and sometimes the other, and gain'd upon the Vessel apace, in∣somuch, that before Day-light we had suck'd her dry, and then we gave over. I forgot to mention, that <HI>Russel,</HI> when he gave me the old Musket, and the Cartridge of Powder, gave me also two half Pound Papers of Tobacco, and <HI>Potter</HI> finding a short broken Pipe in the Cabbin, I smoak'd a Pipe, and lying too under my Fore∣sail all Night, when Day appear'd I look'd all about me, but lost Sight of the Pirates, who, I suppose, made Sail in the Night, not caring I should know or see which Way they bent their Course, for fear of giving an Information of them; for they were prodigiously afraid of meet∣ing with any of his Majesty's Ships, nor could they endure to hear any Talk of them: Though
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
as secret as they thought they had kept the De∣sign of their intended Voyage from me, yet I perfectly knew it to be to go directly for the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and to fetch as far to Wind∣ward as they could, and then to cruise along that Coast, and then stretch over on the Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> where they promis'd themselves Moun∣tains of Treasure; from thence along the Coast of <HI>Guana,</HI> and so down among the Islands, and to be at the latter End of the Spring on the Coast of <HI>North America,</HI> namely, <HI>Carolina, Vir∣ginia, New-York, New-England,</HI> and so by the Summer, to be on the Coast of <HI>Newfoundland; Russel</HI> being the chief Scheme Projector in the Company.</P>
<P>As soon as the Day broke out clear, I went to work, to find out, whether, by Chance or Design, they had left on Board any Thing fitting to eat or drink. I made my first Search in the Cabbin, and swept out of all the Bread-lockers, near the Crown of my Hat full of Dust and Crumbs toge∣ther, of Bisket, which I secur'd very safe; and, in another Locker, I found four or five Hands of Tobacco, which, with the Pound given me by <HI>Russel,</HI> made up a good Stock of that Commodi∣ty. I found also, four or five short broken Pipes about the Cabbin, and they left my <HI>Fore-staff,</HI> with only the <HI>Thirty-cross,</HI> having, as I suppose, flung the other Crosses over-board. They left me also my Bedding, that being useless to them, there being not above three or four in any of the Ships, that lay either in a Cabbin or Hammock, namely, the Captain, Master, Steward, and Gun∣ner, the rest kennelling like Hounds on Deck, or where they could.</P>
<P>From the Cabbin, I went into the Hold, and rummaged there, and found in one Hogshead, a∣bout the Quantity of ten Gallons, as near as I
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
could guess, of Rum, and, in a Rice Cask, be∣tween 20 and 30 Pound of Rice; and, searching farther, I found a small Remnant of Flower in the Bottom of a Flower Cask▪ I tried, and drained all the Water Casks, and found that to be our scarcest Commodity, not being able to drain out of all of them, above two or three Pints.</P>
<P>Having seen all my Store of Provisions, and what I had, under God, to trust to of that Kind, I proceeded next to examine what Condition my Sails were in; and, I cannot say, but I took it more barbarous of them, to take my Sails from me, than their turning me away without Water or Provisions; at least, I verily believe <HI>Russel</HI> thought I had not one Mouthful of any Sort of Eatable, nor one Drop of Water; they left me the same Jibb that was bent, and an old Fore-Sail, and an old Main-Sail that was much rent, torn, and rotten: I haled it upon Deck, and spread it, but was at a sad loss, how to contrive to mend it. I went down into the Cabbin, to see whether they had left any Needles or Twine, and found in the Twine-Locker, half a Dozen Skeins of Twine, but not one Sail-Needle. <HI>Potter,</HI> in the mean Time, was hunting in the Mens Chests and Lockers in the Steerage, and found in one of them, six Needles, and about a Pound and a half of Twine, and two Pawms; at which, I was ve∣ry glad, and we went to work to mend the Main-Sail, but not having Stuff enough on Board, I cut off the first Reef, and tabled down the Foot of it again, and sowed on the Bolt-Rope, and, with what I cut off, I mended it as far as it would go, and what more more was wanting, we mended with some old Canvas, which lay in the Mate's Cabbin, underneath his Bed, which, by good luck, was neither taken away, nor hove over-board.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="110"/>
We were three Days fixing and mending the Main-Sail, before we could fit it so as to bend it; during which Time, we had light Winds, Calms, with variable Airs of Wind, cloudy, and mostly overcast by Day, but clear and Star-light com∣monly by Night, but saw nothing like a Vessel all this Time, which was the chief and principal Thing we looked out for.</P>
<P>The fourth Day in the Morning, we bent the Main-Sail, but it proving calm, did set it, but lay driving and rowling in the Sea, with only the Fore-Sail up, and had been so ever since we were left by the Pirates; our daily Food was raw Flower, or Rice, with a Dram of Rum; laying up safe, our little Stock of Water, till I had a little idle Time, and then I got some Flower up, and made as much Dough as my Water would, of which I made Cakes, and baked them on the Bottom of an iron Pot which I had on Board; and, after I had baked all, which was four little Cakes, I took one, and divided it among us three, but <HI>Potter</HI> was very unwilling to eat any, desiring me, to keep the Bread all for myself, to take a Dram with, and said, he and the little Boy could eat raw Rice and Flower well enough, and that it agreed very well with him, and so little <HI>Jack</HI> said too, and that they had not suffer'd any Thing as yet, either as to Hunger or Thirst. I told them, they must take but a very little Rum to get down their Flower or Rice, for too much would make them dry; they said, they would not: so we eat our Cake, and each of us took a small Dram of Rum, and so had the best Meal that I made, since I came last on board of the Sloop.</P>
<P>This Night, I took two several Observations, one by the North Star, the other, by the Cocks Foot, and sound myself in seventeen Degrees of North Latitude, there being six Minutes Diffe∣rence
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
between the two Observations, but whether this happen'd by the Sett of the Current, the Eye, Horizon, or Declination of the Stars, I shall not now examine nor determine. I had asked the Master of the Scooner, that Night I came away from them, What Distance he reckoned he was from the Island of St. <HI>Antonia?</HI> and he told me, about sixty-five, or seventy Leagues, and the Island bore East, half a Point southerly.</P>
<P>Next Day we had a fresh Trade, and I began to be in a Doubt which Way to endeavour for; <HI>Guinea</HI> being the nighest and easiest Land to fetch, especially with a Trade, or even most Winds; but I thought to myself, What can I do when I come there? I can neither have Credit, nor, if I had, could I, but by a meer Chance, except on Board a Ship, meet with any Thing there to refit me.</P>
<P>To go for <HI>Barbadoes</HI> was a long Run, and the Season being then so subject to Calms, and most∣ly light Winds, it might be a very tedious and long Run thither. If I endeavour'd to run for the Islands of the <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> I must beat it up to Windward, if a Trade Wind continu'd, which would also be a long Time effecting; and besides, my Sails, all but the Jib, were so bad, that it would be hazardous, if not impossible, to make them hold out to beat up sixty or seventy Leagues right in the Wind's Eye; but those Islands of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> being the nighest Land by far, the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> which probably I might fetch, being the Distance of about two hundred Leagues, and <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the nighest Island of <HI>America</HI> to us, being little less than six hundred Leagues distant from us; whereas the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, as I said before, were not above seventy Leagues distant at most, and the Winds in∣clinable
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
to shifting, I concluded with myself, to endeavour for any one of those Islands, but chiefly that of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>The Trade blowing now about the North North-East Point, I set Sail, and stood to the Eastward with my Larboard Tack on Board, by which I shorten'd my Way to both the nighest Lands to me at once, namely the Islands, and the Coast of <HI>Guinea;</HI> so that if the Trade held fresh, in about a Week's Time, I should be upon the Coast of <HI>Guinea;</HI> and if I run three or four Days as we now lay up, and then, if the Wind should veer to the Eastward, or East Southerly, then I should have a fair Chance, if not to fetch them, yet to fetch very nigh them; and I must own, that only the Sight of Land would have been at this Time very pleasant and reviving to our Hopes, which I cannot say as yet were any Thing faintish.</P>
<P>So steering East-and-by-North, East, East-and-by-South, and East-South-East, according as the Winds would suffer us, I kept my Luff as nigh as with a full fair standing Sail she would lie, being oblig'd not to touch or hank her up in the Wind, because of my Mainsail's being les∣sen'd, as I mention'd before, by Reason I could not get Canvas to mend it withal, and therefore it may easily be conceiv'd, that she neither did hold the Wind, nor make the Way through, which she would have done, had not her Sails been lessen'd.</P>
<P>We sail'd with a steady fresh moderate Gale of Wind, from ten a-Clock in the Morning 'till about eleven that Night, and then the Wind be∣gan to die away, insomuch, that between two and three in the Morning, it fell flat Calm, and so continu'd all the Day following 'till about six in the Afternoon; after which Time, we had
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
sometimes light Airs of Wind, variable from the North West, round to the Westward, and so to the Southward, and to the South-South-East, with Thunder and Lightning, and it look'd as if there was a <HI>Turnado</HI> brewing; but we had none, neither had we any Rain, though it look'd very likely, and we very much hoped and long'd for it, but in vain. Those variable light Airs of Wind would hold sometimes half an Hour, other some less; some of them would be gone before we could get the Sloop's Head the right Way to make Use of them; and between those Airs be flat Calm, one Hour between, some two Hours, others two and a half, three, four, five, or six Hours Calm; and this Sort of Weather held us better than two Days. We made the best Ad∣vantage we could to get as much as possible to the Eastward; and in these two or three Days we got about twenty-five Leagues, according to my Judgment, to the Eastward; and, by Ob∣servation, I found myself in sixteen Degrees and fifty-six Minutes of North Latitude, and, by Computation, the Island of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> bore about forty-six Leagues Distance.</P>
<P>I ought before to have acquainted the Reader, That it was <HI>October</HI> the 19th, 1722, that I was taken by the Pirates, and the 29th Day of the same Month, they discharg'd me, and I have brought down my Relation to the 7th of <HI>Novem∣ber;</HI> in the Afternoon of which it falling Calm, I lower'd all my Sails, and let her lie.</P>
<P>The Night following we had one smart Show∣er of Rain, which made us fall to work to save every Drop we could, with as much Care and Caution, as an Alchymist would use in preparing his Grand Arcanum; and, by that Means, sav'd about a Gallon, besides some Draughts which we drank, and eat some Rice with it.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="114"/>
We had two or three other small Showers, but scarce enough thoroughly to wet the Deck and therefore could save no Water from them. We had also a great deal of Thunder and Lightening, but especially in the great Shower.</P>
<P>About four a-Clock in the Morning, which was the 8th Day of <HI>November,</HI> it clear'd up, but continu'd calm, and the Sea very smooth: When Day broke out I spread the Mainsail, and dry'd that and the Foresail, both which wanted mend∣ing again; and as soon as the Mainsail was dry enough to sow, I began upon that first, which took me up the most Part of the Day: In the mean Time, I order'd a Fire to be made, and boiling some Flower in some of the Water which we had saved, we made a little Pap, which we eat, and it went down most sweetly, taking a Dram of Rum after it, and were very thankful to Providence for this delicious Meal, it being very warm to our Stomachs. I resolv'd to save the rest of the Water for the like Occasion, that we might refresh our Spirits with so comfortable a Recruit, when we might grow faint by eating of the raw Rice or Flower.</P>
<P>It still continu'd calm, with light <HI>Cat-Skins,</HI> as we commonly term them in the Sea Dialect, which are light Airs of Wind, not spreading perhaps above half a Mile, or some of them above the Quantity of an Acre of Ground on the Water; some perhaps reaching you, but dying away before you could set your Sails, or get your Vessel the right Way with her Head; some dying away before they reach you, some going but just past you, and differ from a <HI>Breese,</HI> in that the latter spreads, or blows all over beyond what your Sight can reach, at least on one Side; both being however soft Winds, running on the Face of the Sea, most commonly after, or in a
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
Calm, making, as it were, a gentle Trepidation or Curling on the Surface of the Sea, and there∣by giving the Part it strikes upon a different Hue or Aspect, insomuch, that you may see them at a considerable Distance, before they reach you. Both these differ from a <HI>Gale</HI> in the Sea Notion, in the Strength of the latter: For a <HI>Breese</HI> blow∣ing constant and a little brisk, it then loses its Name with us, and is call'd a <HI>Gale of Wind,</HI> and is distinguish'd into <HI>moderate, hard,</HI> or <HI>taut,</HI> in Proportion to the Strength it hath increas'd to. And this Definition of a <HI>Catskin, Breese,</HI> and <HI>Gale,</HI> I thought proper to give for the Sake of such of my Readers, who are not acquainted with the Sea Language.</P>
<P>After I had mended up the Mainsail, I fixed the Foresail as well as I could, and about five a-Clock in the Afternoon, <HI>Nov.</HI> 10, a moderate Gale sprung up at East, and freshen'd up, and veer'd to the East-South-East, and about ten or eleven at Night to the South-East. I made Sail with the Starboard Tack on Board to the North-North-East, North-East, and East-North-East, according as the Wind veer'd, keeping my Luff, and endeavouring to get to the Eastward all that I could; for all that I gain'd to that Point, was so much gain'd to Windward.</P>
<P>The Gale continu'd fresh, yet moderate, some∣times cloudy, sometimes overcast, but often∣times in the Night clear, till the 12th Day; and then the Wind back'd to the Eastward, and by ten or eleven at Night back'd to the North-East, and North-East-and-by-North, that being the true Trade, which caus'd me to put about, and stand to the South-Eastward, and about two a-Clock in the Morning, <HI>Nov.</HI> 13. I observ'd the North Star, and found myself in 19 Degrees and 37 Minutes North Latitude.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="116"/>
I stretch'd away to the South Eastward 'till the 16th Day, and about ten in the Forenoon we saw St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> which then bore from us East, half a Point northerly, and I judg'd we were about 18 or 19 Leagues distant from it, and it falling calm, we lay with our Sails all down, to save them from flapping.</P>
<P>The Calm continuing all Day, and the Sea be∣ing very smooth, about one or two in the After∣noon <HI>Potter</HI> saw a Shark, a voracious Fish, the Description of which is so common, that I shall not trouble my Reader with it. I look'd about, and saw four more, but one swindging one, swam close up along Side, and almost even with the Waters Edge. <HI>Come, Come,</HI> said I, <HI>we will, with God's Leave, have him by-and-by. Ay, Sir,</HI> said the Boy, <HI>if we had our Shark-Hook, and a Piece of Beef or Pork. No Matter,</HI> said I, <HI>we will have him presently.</HI> So I got some Rags of several Colours, and made them fast together, being about the Bulk of a three or four Pound Piece of Meat, knowing there is hardly any Thing but what the Sharks will snap at, and having made it fast to the End of a Rope, hove it over Board, and order'd the Boy to tend it as a Bait, or Decoy, and as the Shark came nigh it, to hale it up, and only play with him, to keep him about the Ves∣sel, while I got ready another Rope, at the End of which I made a running bowling Knot, and the Noose so as to keep it open with one Hand, lowering the under Part beneath the Surface of the Water about two or three Foot, which was easily done, by Reason it was flat Calm, and the Vessel had no Way at all, holding with my other Hand the single Part of the Rope, ready when the Shark had wholly got his Head through the
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
Noose, to hale, and thereby jam the running Knot taut about him, the Boy all the Time play∣ing with the Bait before the Noose.</P>
<P>This fell out according to our Desire; for the Shark coming up, and endeavouring to get the Bait, enter'd his Head through the Snare; but I, being over-eager, with a sudden Jirk, jamm'd the Noose close, before the Neck Fins were got through, and haled his Head above Water as high as we could, making fast the Rope; but in two or three Plunges he slipp'd his Head out, and immediately darted, as it were, out of Sight, after whom all the other Sharks pursued, think∣ing, as I suppose, he had got some Prize.</P>
<P>I was not a little concern'd at his Escape, and blam'd myself for being so hasty, as not to wait 'till his Head and Throat Fins had pass'd through the Snare before I had jamm'd it; but my Con∣cern was dissipated by the fresh Appearance of the same Sharks, as I suppos'd, being the same Number, and, as nigh as I could guess, of the same Size; upon which I hove the Bait over∣board again, and fix'd my Snare as at first, and, as I suppos'd by his Bigness, the same Shark again made to the Bait, but shunn'd the Snare, and so continu'd playing about it near three Quarters of an Hour, and then he darted at the Bait with such Swiftness, as if he had a Design, either to pass the Noose, or to make sure of the Bait, which he had been deluded with so long. I had as much Eagerness to catch him, as he had to catch the Bait, and my former Oversight made me more wary and dextrous, and as soon as I judg'd him enter'd far enough in the Noose, I jamm'd the Snare by a sudden Jirk of the Rope, and haled him up so high, that his Head, with about a Quarter of his Bo∣dy, was above Water, and finding him well
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
secur'd, I let him hang so, and gave him Time to tire himself, by beating against the Vessel, which he did now and then pretty hard.</P>
<P>When he had lain so about an Hour, he began to be pretty quiet, now and then striking and flouncing, but very weak and faint, so that I thought I might venture to get him in, or, at least, take him wholly out of the Water, and making a running bowling Knot on the End of another Rope, I cast it over his Tail Fin; I jamm'd it close, and haled his Tail also above Water, and made it fast. He lay as if he had been dead, for about three or four Minutes, and then began to strike so hard with his Tail, that at every Stroke he made, the Vessel shook, and fearing it would do it harm, I lower'd his Tail down in the Water again, and clapp'd a Tackle on the Rope that was about his Throat, he being so heavy, we could not hale him by Hands any higher, and hoisted him up so, that about a Foot and a half of the Tail Part, was in the Water, and let him hang till he seemed to be almost dead, and then I hoisted him first by one End, and then by the other, with the Tackle, till we got him in upon Deck, and then he began again to strike so hard with his Tail, as if he would have beat the Deck down, which I soon put a Stop to, by cut∣ting off about a Foot of his Tail Part, in which lies most of this Fish's Strength: He then lay pret∣ty quiet, and I put an End of a Boot-hook Staff into his Mouth, which he crush'd to Splinters, with as much Ease, as one could squeeze an Egg∣shell.</P>
<P>On cutting the Belly open, I found five young Ones, all alive, about the Bigness of a small Whiting; tho' I have hitherto call'd it <HI>He,</HI> accord∣ing to an old Rule I had been taught at School,
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
to reckon any Nouns whose Gender, by the Rules of Grammar, I could not find out, <HI>Masculine.</HI></P>
<P>She had a very fine Liver, not blackish, nor dark reddish, as most large Sharks have, but of a fair gray Colour, which I preserv'd. The whole Length of the Shark, was something more than eleven Foot and a half, and it must needs be near upon 300 Weight. I struck a Light by Help of the old Gun that <HI>Russel</HI> gave me at parting, which I then thought a useless Present, and accepted it only, because I durst do no otherwise; but having neither Tinder-Box, nor Steel left me, it would have been impossible for us to get Fire without it; and though they left me the two Compasses that were in the <HI>Beetacle,</HI> there was not one Inch of Candle; which, however, in sailing upon a Wind I did not much matter, except when any light Air, Breese, or Catskin, came in the Night, and the Sky was overcast, and no Stars to be seen, more especially if it was large, as any Way from the western Hank, in which Case I was forc'd to supply the want of Candle, by blowing a Coal of Fire, whereby I could discern the Compass so, as to get her Head the right Way.</P>
<P>Having, as I said, struck a Light, and caused a Fire to be made; the Pot was put on, with Sea Water, and, as soon as our Fish was boiled, we eat heartily of it. After which, I cut the greatest Part of the Shark into thin long Slices, and dried it in the Sun to preserve it, having no Salt on board.</P>
<P>About ten o' the Clock at Night, it looked black to the westward Board, and lighten'd much that Way, and about eleven, came up a light Air of Wind at West North-West, increasing to a moderate light Gale. I kept the Fire in, to have a Coal always in readiness, that I might see the Compass every now and then, and steer'd East
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
North-East, choosing to be well to the North∣ward, to be ready if the Trade-wind should blow, which is mostly North North-East and North-East and by North.</P>
<P>It still continuing black, and to lighten much in the werstern Board, about Midnight it began to Thunder, and rained a smart Shower, of which, we sav'd about three Gallons; and about four o' the Clock in the Morning, it clear'd up, and the Stars shew'd themselves, which sav'd me the Trouble of blowing a Coal to see the Compass.</P>
<P>It continuing a fine pleasant fresh Gale, veering to the North-West; as soon as it was Day, I set the Island of <HI>St. Anthony,</HI> which bore from me South South-East, about ten Leagues, the Gale continuing still; but dying away by Degrees, about eleven in the Forenoon, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 17, it fell flat calm again, at which Time, <HI>St. Anthony</HI> bore South and by West, about eight Leagues distant.</P>
<P>I broil'd some of the Fish for Breakfast, and eat of it pretty heartily, which made us all very dry, but thank God we had a good Stock of Water, so that now we could venture to drink a little. I made them put the Pot on, with some fresh Wa∣ter, and a little Rice to boil, and when the Rice was a little soft, I had it thicken'd with Flower, and then put a Piece of the Shark's Liver into it, shred small, which soon dissolv'd in it mostly to oil, as Fish Livers generally do; and this serv'd us in the Room of Butter in our Hasty-pudding, which we Sailors usually call Pap, of which, we made a hearty and pleasant Meal; and, as we had the Sight of Land, our Hopes were much re∣viv'd. I lower'd down all my Sails, and over∣haled them, and mended what was amiss, the Calm continuing till two o' the Clock the Morning following, and it being a clear serene Star-light Night.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="121"/>
Afterwards a Gale sprung up at South-South-West, and veer'd to the West-North-West, I still steering East-North-East; and about eight a-Clock in the Morning, <HI>Nov.</HI> 18, it fell calm, and continu'd so all that Day, and 'till nine o' Clock at Night, intermixt with light insignificant Airs, and Catskins. The Wind freshen'd up to a Gale about ten at Night, with Thunder and Lightning from the North-North-West Board, as was the Wind also. We had several small Showers of Rain, but so small, that we could not save any Water from them; and as it thunder'd pretty much, and look'd very black and thick over the Island of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> we judg'd that there fell abundance of Rain that Night there, which we heartily grudg'd them, and had rather it had fallen where we were, tho' we had under∣gone a wet Jacket for it, and had no Cloaths to shift us.</P>
<P>In the Morning of <HI>Nov.</HI> 19, when the Day clear'd, we could very plainly see, St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> St. <HI>Lucia, Terra Branca,</HI> and the <HI>Monte Gourda,</HI> which is the highest Mountain of the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> lying on the North-West Side of it, but a good Way up in the Land, and may be seen from any Side of the Island, at about nine or ten Leagues Distance, in the Form of a flattish Sugar-Loaf; it bore from us South-South-East about ten Leagues distant.</P>
<P>About four in the Afternoon sprung up a light Gale at North-North-East, and it look'd hazy to Windward, and very like a true Trade; and I was the rather induc'd to think it so, because it was the Time of Year for the true Trades to blow, and for the most Part to hold strong, from their first coming, 'till towards the latter Part of <HI>March;</HI> and not knowing but the Wind might, as is very usual, veer to the North-East, East-North-East,
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
or perhaps further, and being desi∣rous to fetch the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> rather than any of the other Islands, because I was well acquainted there, and it was the likeliest Place to get a Mainsail at, by Reason they spin the best there; I therefore kept my Luff, and steer'd away East, which I was sure would carry me a good Distance to Windward of the Island; so that if the true Trade held, I should not fear go∣ing to Windward of it, and be thereby enabled to chuse, as well as to make a large Wind to which Road I lik'd best to anchor in.</P>
<P>Besides, as I knew that the Pirates had taken he Priest's Sloop, I was sure, if I could get there, I should not want what Freight I could in Reason desire, as soon as I could refit, and put myself into a Posture to go to the Isle of <HI>Sal;</HI> for I was sure the Priest, for his own Interest, would do all that lay in his Power to assist me; there being hardly a Family on the Island, but what had a Relation then on the Island of <HI>Sal,</HI> where they all apprehended they might pro∣bably perish, before another Occasion offer'd, if I did not go.</P>
<P>The Gale continuing all Night, about four o' Clock in the Morning I edg'd away more to the Southward, and about eight it fell calm 'till Noon, but was very hazy, insomuch, that I could see no Land. Between twelve and one in the Afternoon, <HI>Nov.</HI> 20, sprung up a Gale at North-East, which increasing, soon clear'd the Air, so that I saw the Island of <HI>St. Nicholas,</HI> the East Point bearing West-South-West, and, by Supposition, about eight or nine Leagues distant. I crowded all the Sail that I could make to get in to an Anchor before Night, the Wind still in∣creasing. About five in the Evening I doubled the East Point of the Island; after which, when
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
I came to luff up to keep the Land aboard, I found the Wind more Northerly, with very hard Flaws coming down the deep Gullies.</P>
<P>It being late in the Evening, and likely to prove, as indeed it did, a close Night, and not having Day-light enough to gain, as I intended, the Road of <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> but fearing I might miss it in the Night, the high Lands being so very like one another, I resolv'd to anchor in <HI>Currisal</HI> Road, it being nigher, as likewise to get off some Water, there being none to be had within two Miles of <HI>Paragheesi.</HI></P>
<P>I was forc'd to make a Board or two, to fetch into the anchoring Place, and anchor'd in sixteen Fathom Water, about a Quarter of a Mile from the Shore, just about duskish; and saw a Fire and some People on the Shore.</P>
<P>After we had stow'd our Sails, I hoisted the Boat out to get in the End of the Cable which the Pi∣rates had slipt, and put a Buoy on the Cable End, having discern'd it and the Buoy on the Anchor before I anchor'd, and for that Reason let go my Anchor nigh enough to it to get the End of it on Board. In order to which, I took a Quoil or two of small Rope with me in the Boat, to make one End fast to the Cable End, and to bring the other on Board; and so by the small Rope to hale or heave the Cable on Board the Sloop, and ride moor'd 'till I thought proper to move from thence; but being so few Hands, we were so long a getting the Boat out, that Night came on, and it was so dark, that I could not, with all my Diligence, find the Buoy; and so was forc'd to come on Board again with the Boat, without effecting my Design.</P>
<P><HI>Potter</HI> then requested me to let him scull the Boat ashore to get a Cag of Water, which I con∣sented to, but bid him be sure not to make any
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
Stay at all ashore, but come off as soon as he had got his Cask filled, which could not be long, the Water being close to the Sea Side.</P>
<P>Soon after he was gone with the Boat, I was taken very ill with Faintness and Trembling at Heart, insomuch, that I had much ado to get down to my Cabbin, which I attributed to my Overwatching and Working to get the Vessel in, and to our Drowthiness the preceding Day, which was more excessive than I had experienc'd ever since we parted with the Pirates. I bid the little Boy <HI>Jack</HI> keep a good Look-out for the Boat, and have a Rope ready to heave to her when she came off; and to be sure not to fall asleep: All which he promis'd to observe. I had not long lain down on my Bed, before I fell fast asleep; and waking in a Surprize, I call'd to the little Boy, who not answering, I turn'd out, and came upon Deck, and found him fast asleep in the <HI>Gangway.</HI> I awak'd him, and ask'd him, If the Boat was come on Board? He told me No; and looking about me, I could but just see the Island. This was as nigh as I could guess between twelve and one a-Clock, and I was not a little surpriz'd to see myself thus again expos'd to the Sea, and that in a much worse Condition than before; my Spirits and Strength being much wasted; my Help gone; the Sloop daily growing more leaky; depriv'd of my Boat, and my Thirst very great, which perhaps was increas'd by the Hopes I had of getting some Water, as well as owing to the great Fatigue of the preceding Day; but know∣ing it in vain to despair, I resolv'd to do what I could, and depend upon Providence for the rest: However, I had two tough Jobs to manage, to wit, to heave the Anchor up, there being a whole Cable out to the better End; and to pump the Water out, which was in some Places above the
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>
Ballast: And the latter being the more danger∣ous, I concluded to begin with that first, know∣ing, that if I could suck her dry, I should be in Hopes to keep her so. Accordingly I went to work, and pump'd about half an Hour, in which Time I gain'd upon her considerably, and resting a while, took the other half Hour's Spell; after which I rested again, and smoak'd a Pipe of Tobacco, and took a Dram of Rum with a lit∣tle raw Rice, and then fell to my Work of Pump∣ing, and in five or six good Spells more, I suck'd her; and then immediately apply'd myself to heave in the Cable; and to enable the little Boy to hold on, I made him a <HI>Jigger</HI> with a Block fix'd to the Cable, and a Rope reev'd through it, so that having a double Purchase, he made shift to hold on; tho' it was very tedious and slow. I hove up till about half the Cable was in, and then I went and took a Spell at the Pump, and pump'd her out dry; after which I rested, took a Dram, and smoak'd half a Pipe of Tobacco, and then went to heaving up the Anchor again, then to the Pump again, and the next Spell I got the Anchor up, and stow'd it with the Pawm over the Gunnel; after which I set Sail, and the Trade-Wind continuing to blow, I stretch'd to the North-West, finding that I was able to keep the Sloop free, though she made a great deal of Water; and I think I never found myself hear∣tier or stronger in all my Life. It was a great Concern to me to think of leaving my Boy and Boat at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> besides the Hopes of sup∣plying myself with a Sail, which I could not ex∣pect at any of the other Islands; neither could I propose any Thing at any of the other Islands, but the saving mine and the Boy's Life, by run∣ning the Sloop on Shore in some convenient Place; having no Boat to go ashore for Water,
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
or to get any of the Natives to go with me; for I could not expect that any of them would ven∣ture to swim off to me, without some previous Conversation, or Acquaintance, for fear I should be lurking there to steal some of them away: Wherefore being determin'd to get to the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> I stretch'd, as I said before, to the North-West, and stood till I brought the South-West Point of the Island North-North-East from me about the Distance of six Leagues, and then I tack'd and stood to the Eastward till I came a-breast of <HI>Currisal,</HI> it being then about six in the Evening, and bearing North, distant about seven Leagues; and falling calm in a little Time after, I lower'd down all the Sails, and let her lie while that held, which was all Night, and till between eight and nine a-Clock the next Day.</P>
<P>I was tedious dry, but had no Help nor Means to quench it; and durst not eat any of the dry'd Fish, because it made me more thirsty, as I thought, than if it had been salted.</P>
<P>This seem'd to me the most irksome Situation I had yet been in; for I was now, as it were, alone, having little or no Help in the little Boy, unless to hold the Helm while I was at the Pump, which was every half Hour, or oftner, or while I was doing any other Business; not daring to lie down to take a Nap, except a short one which I ventur'd to take during the Calm.</P>
<P>I smoak'd a Pipe of Tobacco or two, and also took a Dram, with a little Rice; and about nine o'Clock in the Morning, <HI>Nov.</HI> 22, some small Catskins came on, and towards Noon sprung up a Breese at North-East: I then made Sail, and stood to the North-North-West, and hoped to fetch <HI>Paragheesi</HI> with that Board; but the Lee-Tide being made, I fell short by half a League,
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
and fearing to be put again to Leeward of the Island, and the Boy and I not being able to work the Sloop as we ought, I was resolv'd to fetch in with any Anchoring-Place I could fetch, and stretching in till I got the Shore close on Board, I then edg'd away to a sandy Bay, call'd by the Natives <HI>Puttacko,</HI> where I anchor'd in six Fathom Water, in clear sandy Ground.</P>
<P>I had hardly been at an Anchor an Hour, when a Black came down to the Water-Side, and call'd to me. I answer'd him again. He said some∣thing, and wav'd a long Pole, which he had with him; but the Wind blowing fresh, I could hear nothing that he said to understand it, only <HI>Logo,</HI> which, in their Language, is as much as to say, <HI>presently,</HI> or <HI>by-and-by.</HI> He went away; and in about half an Hour, another Black came down to the Water-Side, and waving his long Staff, as the other had done, said something, but I could hear only, <HI>Logo, Presto;</HI> and away he went.</P>
<P>I gave God Thanks for his Mercy, that I was once more got to an Anchor; and hoped my Boy would get some of the Inhabitants to help him to bring the Boat from <HI>Currisal;</HI> but not ex∣pecting him till the next Morning, I tended the Pump, in the Intervals smoaking a Pipe of To∣bacco, &amp;c. About Sun-set I saw a small Boat come from <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> with several Blacks in her, rowing towards us, at which I was not a little rejoic'd.</P>
<P><HI>They came on Board to the Number of seven, all lusty stout young Fellows, and brought with them two ten Gallon Casks full of Water, and bid me drink heartily of it. I drank twice; and they urging me to drink again, I told them, I had enough; at which they seem'd to admire; and one of them said, If he had been so long</HI>

<HI>without Water, he could drink one of those ten Gallon Casks of Water himself before he should be satisfy'd. They told me,</HI> That the Priest and Governor of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> had sent them on Board with that little Boat, which was the Priest's, to assist me to get my Sloop up to <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> in order to secure her, this being a very foul Road, and open to the Easterly Winds, which were very fre∣quent at this Time of the Year, and always made such a Sea in this Bay, that it would be next to impossible for the Vessel to be safe there; and that the sunken Rocks (which lay a large Stones-Cast from the Shore) were so sharp, that the best Swim∣mer on that Island could have no Hopes to save himself if the Vessel should be put from her Anchor. <HI>I told them,</HI> I would stay till my Servant came to me from <HI>Currisal</HI> with the Boat.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> That could not be this Fortnight or three Weeks, the Wind being set in a strong Trade, which commonly at this Time of the Year, blew hard, and continued long: That they were sent by the Priest and Governour to help me, and they thought it a very good Opportunity to get up to <HI>Para∣gheesi,</HI> as soon as the windward Current was made, which would be in an Hour or two: That they were <HI>Homo's de Mare</HI> (i. e. <HI>Seamen)</HI> and two of them understood the Sea very well, and were Pilots. <HI>Which is a Title they give to any of their own People that can steer or take Charge of any of their little Boats that go a Fishing. They told me,</HI> I need not be concern'd at my Boy's not being on board, for they were bred up Seamen from their Infancy, and could work the Sloop up to the Port of <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> or any where to the other Islands, and would not have me trouble myself about it, but smoak my Pipe, or go and take my Rest, for they would take Charge of the Vessel, and get her into the Port, and moor her safe; For, <HI>said they,</HI> we have been very much used to take
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
Charge of Strangers; <HI>an Appellation which they give to all</HI> Europeans, <HI>except</HI> Portuguese, <HI>whom they call</HI> Branca<HI>'s, i. e.</HI> White<HI>'s, or</HI> white People, <HI>I suppose, because they were the first white People they ever saw; and, from whom, it's probable, they learnt, after the Manner of that Nation, to call all other People</HI> Strangers. <HI>I told them,</HI> I thought it was much better to stay till the Day-tide, when they would be better able to see the Ropes, and stand by the Work, then they could in the Night, they being Strangers to the Vessel; and besides, perhaps the rest of their Company might not be such good Seamen, or be used to working in Vessels, as they were.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> The rest of their Company were not Pilots, as they two were, and could not work a Vessel as they could; but that they were good Sailors, and could endure Hardships, and do any Thing that they were commanded, as well as any white Sailor whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>I said,</HI> If they could do that, it was sufficient: but I had another Reason to offer, which might, I thought sway with them, to tarry till the Day-Tide, which was, That my Sails were very bad, and would not hold in any Thing of a taut Wind, and, if any Thing gave Way, we could better mend it, and set it to rights by Day than by Night.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> No, it was much better to try for it in the Night-tide, by Reason it was always less Wind under the Land by Night, than by Day, neither did the strong Flaws come down through the▪ Gulleys, as they generally do in the Day.</P>
<P><HI>I still insisting in my Opinion, they told me,</HI> If my Sails were so bad, as I represented them, they would certainly not hold out to beat up in the Day Time; for I should not fail of having taut Winds blow off the Land, as well as hard Flaws come down the deep Gullies; and if I was not resolved to weigh the next windward Tide coming on, they would all
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
go on Shore, and not stay on Board to run the Hazard of losing their Lives, or being drove out to Sea; which might chance to happen on a Lee Tide, where they might have no Possibility of fetching any Part of the Island.</P>
<P>I consider'd with my self a while, and found some Reason in what they said, and promis'd to weigh the next Spring-Tide, if they were sure that we could get to <HI>Paragheesi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> That if they had not been very certain of that, I might be sure they would not ven∣ture to weigh from thence, and bid me not to trouble myself about such Thoughts; they would engage to get her safe up and moored, long enough before the windward Current was spent, even without one Knot of Sail, if we took the Advantage of the whole Tide.</P>
<P>I told them, I was glad to hear it was so easy to get up to the Road, and wish'd it to fall out as they said.</P>
<P>They said, I need not at all doubt that; and about eight at Night, they told me the Current was set to Windward, and that it was Time to weigh.</P>
<P><HI>I said,</HI> That, according to the best Observa∣tions that I had made among these Islands, the Cur∣rent should not set to Windward, till near ten o'Clock. <HI>They said,</HI> As for the Time, or Hours, they were ignorant of them, as being not used to reckon that Way; but they could tell by the Rising of the Moon, or by the Rising and Height of several Stars; and they perfectly well knew, that the Tide was already made up to Windward, and, if I did not think fit to weigh now, they would all Hands go ashore with their Boat, and believed I should have no more Help from the Island, if I did not lay hold of such a fair Opportunity as now offer'd. <HI>So I told them,</HI> If they were sure the Tide was made to Windward, they
<PB N="125" REF="131"/>
might go to work, and heave up the Anchor as soon as they pleased. <HI>At which, they went to work, but would not let me heave at the Windlace, be∣cause they said,</HI> they were Hands enough, and I need do no more, but order what I would have done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We got the Anchor up, and stow'd it, and set the Sails, and made a Trip off to the South-East, with a moderate Gale, and the Wind increasing, we stood along Shore, and off withal, till we reckoned (as well as we could discern the Land to know it) to be abreast of a Place call'd <HI>Porto Ghuy;</HI> and then putting her a Stays, the Mainsail split so in the Staying, that I was forc'd to lower it down, for fear it would blow all to Pieces; which so daunted them, that they resolv'd to quit the Sloop, and take to the little Boat which they came off in. This put me into as great a Streight, as any I had been in yet: We being then about two Leagues from the Shore, an ugly chopping Sea running, the Wind blowing fresh, and it look∣ing very black to Windward.</P>
<P>I then observ'd, to add to the Misfortune, that the Blacks were almost all drunk; for when they first came on Board, I made the little Boy fetch them a Bottle of Rum, and they observing where he brought it from, were so impudent, seeing none but the Boy and I (notwithstanding I for∣bad them) to fetch it themselves, telling me, <HI>That the least they could expect, was to participate of what was in the Sloop, and that I shew'd myself very un∣grateful, as well as nigardly, to think much at any Thing they could eat or drink that was on board the Vessel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I did not begrudge them, but would have them only forbear drinking, till we had secured the Sloop, and then they should be very welcome to it all.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="132"/>
<HI>They had the Impudence to tell me,</HI> The Sloop was as much theirs as she was mine, and also every Thing that was in her; that I was in Distress, and must have certainly perished, if they had not come off, and brought me and the Boy some Water.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That it was a Kindness, I own'd; but that I was in no evident Danger of perishing, when they came on Board, the Sloop being well at an Anchor, and the Pump suck'd dry; and, Thanks be to God, I was in good Health, and therefore able enough, with God's Blessing, to keep her free, till my Boy could come to me from <HI>Currisal</HI> with my Boat. <HI>They said,</HI> That if I had waited there, till the Boy came to me with my Boat, I might wait long enough, for they did not believe, that any of the Islanders would venture to come down in the Boat with him, till the blowing Weather was over, which they did not expect to be, this two or three Months.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> If they left me now with the Boat, they would leave me in a much worse Condition than they found me in, when they came on Board; for they had drank all the Water that they brought on Board, and though I was destitute of it when they came, yet I was at an Anchor nigh the Shore, and should always have been in Hopes of a Supply; and, at worst, could put the Sloop on Shore, and so escape perishing that Way.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They could not see what I could do with the Sloop now, having no Sails to work her with; and to lie, and drive to Leeward all Night, and the next Day, till we got the Sail mended, we should be so far to Leeward of the Island, that it would be impossible to fetch any Part of the Island, and then we must either perish at Sea, or be forced to some Place, from whence they might never be able to get to their Families, or Homes, any more; and therefore, they were resolved not to run that Hazard,
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
but endeavour to get thither in the small Boat, which they had brought with them.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I thought the Hazard to be so great, by venturing in the Boat, the Sea running so high, and the Wind blowing so hard, and right off the Shore, that it was next to an Impossibility to row to the Shore.</P>
<P><HI>They replied,</HI> They were satisfied it was a great Risque, but to abide in the Sloop, in their Judg∣ment, was a greater; and, if they must perish, would rather choose it in Sight of their native Land, than any where else; and if I thought fit to take my Chance with them, and they found we were too many for the Boat to carry, there were several among them that could, in Case of Necessity, depend on swim∣ming ashore, and if Necessity required it, they would, for the Security of the rest, take to the Water and swim; <HI>and one of them, who reckon'd himself the best Pilot, said,</HI> That if the Boat should be over∣turn'd by the Waves, he would not have me to doubt, but what he could, and would, carry me safe to the Shore.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That was a very ticklish Chance to trust to, and that he would soon be tired in the Water with such a Load as I should be, not being able to strike one Stroke; and that I could expect no less, than to be quitted by him, rather than perish himself.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> That if I relied upon him, he would sooner die with me, than leave me; besides, there were others in the Company, <HI>he said,</HI> that could swim as well as he, and they would take Turns, and did not fear getting me and the little Boy safe ashore, though there was no Boat at all.</P>
<P>I consider'd, that all, or most of this, proceeded from the Rum, the Fumes of which, had got in their Brains; and that it would have been as desperate an Action to go with them, as to cast my self headlong into the Sea; the Boat being
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>
so small, that nine or ten Hands were as many as she could conveniently carry in smooth Water, and what else could be expected, but to perish in such a Sea as then run?</P>
<P><HI>Whereupon I told them,</HI> I was resolv'd to trust to Providence, and continue in the Sloop; and if they would do so to, I doubted not, with God's Blessing, but they would by far, stand the better Chance.</P>
<P><HI>They replied,</HI> That if they must perish, they would perish in Sight of their own Land, and not be driven to an unknown Place to perish, where they should ne∣ver be heard of.</P>
<P><HI>I said,</HI> That if they were to perish in endea∣vouring to get ashore in the Boat, there could no Account be given of them, nor could their Friends know any more what was become of them, than if they had been lost in the farthest Part of the World. <HI>They answered,</HI> They were sure that some of them should be able to get safe ashore, were both Sloop and Boat to go to the Bottom; and, if but one of them got safe ashore, it would be sufficient to give an Ac∣count, where, when, and how they were lost, which would be a great Satisfaction to their Friends; and it would be more pleasing to themselves, to think they should die so near their own Homes.</P>
<P>I repeated to them the Danger they would ex∣pose themselves to, and that there was hardly any Possibility of their escaping, if they ventur'd all of them to take to the Boat, whatever Chance might befal some of them; but 'twas all in vain; They said, <HI>Their Chance could be no better, if they staid in a leaky Sloop, without Sails, Water, Provi∣sions,</HI> &amp;c. And often repeated, <HI>That it would be better for them to perish in Sight of their Homes, than in a far, or strange Place.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, <HI>says one them,</HI> if you should get to any Land, You would w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt for nothing, but We could expect nothing but to be kill'd, or made Slaves of;
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
during our Lives, which, to us, would be worse than Death itself; and therefore, <HI>continued he,</HI> I am re∣solv'd, come what will, to trust myself to the Boat and St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> and doubt not, but he will prevail with God, to carry me safe; and so, <HI>says he to the rest,</HI> let us be gone, for the longer we delay, the far∣ther off we drive, and the farther we have to row before we can get to the Shore: and let us, moreover, make a Vow to St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> That if he will bring us safe to our Homes, we will join and pay for a <HI>sung Mass</HI> in his Church, the first <HI>Sunday</HI> after our safe Arrival: And let us also, <HI>said he,</HI> give the blessed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the Mother of God, a <HI>sung Mass</HI> in her Chapel, that she may command her Son to assist St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> to conduct us safe to the Shore.</P>
<P>Now you must know, there is a vast Difference, betwixt a <HI>sung Mass,</HI> and a <HI>said Mass,</HI> as well in the Price, as the Efficacy; it being, according to those People's Opinion, the Way of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to raise their Prices, in Proportion to the pretended Merit, or Efficacy of the Thing; now a sung Mass, which they call <HI>Missa Cantado,</HI> is sung by the Priest, and the whole Choir, by Note, and is so common in this Island, that there are very few Males, but what are taught, tho' I don't know, that ever I heard that the Females learn'd to sing. They are taught by the head Singer, who is stiled <HI>Meastre Musica, (i. e.</HI> Master of Mu∣sick) and is chosen to that Office, for the Good∣ness of his Voice, &amp;c. This <HI>Missa Cantado,</HI> costs ten <HI>Testoons,</HI> that is, between five and six Shillings, and is paid to the Priest, out of which, he pays the Singers; but a <HI>said Mass,</HI> is only called <HI>Missa,</HI> for which they pay to the Priest, two <HI>Testoons;</HI> so that it is not so efficacious as a <HI>Missa Cantado,</HI> but in the same Proportion, as two is to ten; and 'tis reckon'd almost scandalous, for any but the poorer Sort, to have a <HI>said Mass,</HI> either for the
<PB N="130" REF="136"/>
Living or the Dead. There is hardly a more gain∣ful Branch of their Trade, then this of saying and singing Masses, both for the Quick and Dead; but I shall enlarge upon this, when I come to describe each of the Islands, their Kinds of People, Man∣ners, Customs, and Differences in Religion.</P>
<P>But to return, they concluded to take to the Boat, and accordingly, it was haled up along Side, and the Water hove out, Oars got in, (which were more like Paddles for a Canoo, than Oars for a Boat) and every Thing being got ready, the head Pilot, who took upon him to be Spokesman for the rest, told me, <HI>They were just upon departing, and, if I thought fit to take my Chance along with them, I should fare as they fared, and no otherwise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I was resolv'd to abide in the Sloop, and desired them, to tell my Boy on the Island, if all, or any of them, should get safe to the Shore, that I would endeavour to get to the Island if I could; but if I should not come soon, and he could light of an Opportunity, by any Ship's touching there, to be sure not to slip it, but make use of it to get off the Island as soon as be could; and also desired them to give my Thanks and Service to the Priest and Governor, for their Care in sending Assistance: But could wish they had not come on Board at all, since it happen'd as it did; for then I had still been lying safe at an Anchor. <HI>Into the Boat they stepp'd, being all, or most of them, very drunk, the Night very dark, and a brisk Gale of Wind; and, what with my Concern at my present Case, and the Darkness of the Night, I did not count them, nor mind whether all they that came on Board, went in the Boat or no.</HI></P>
<P>After they were gone, I began to consider what a comfortless Plight I was in, and repented that I let them weigh my Anchor, and heartily wish'd that the Boy and I were safe ashore with the other
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
Boy, on the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas:</HI> I should wil∣lingly have gone in the Boat, and quitted the Sloop, but that it was so small, that I could not but think it would be a great Presumption to ven∣ture to do so, especially as they were all so drunk.</P>
<P>But, however, recollecting myself, that there was now no Remedy but Patience, I began to con∣sider, what Course to take, to extricate myself out of this my present, and indeed hitherto, greatest Misfortune; for my Mainsail was very much torn, my Twine almost expended, and I had no Help, nor any Body to consult with.</P>
<P>The Wind also, was now veering to the Eastern Trade, so that it seem'd a Hazard, whether I should be able to fetch with my Head-Sails, the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> or even St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which was the Lee∣wardmost Island that I was acquainted with of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> Islands: The Islands of S. <HI>Philip,</HI> and that also of St. <HI>John,</HI> I was utterly unacquainted with, they being very little, or not at all used by our Shipping, the Sea-Draughts giving but a very imperfect Description of them, and the Waggon∣ers and Pilots of those Parts, being every whit as much, or more defective, making them both to be very dangerous; the Island of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> to have few or no Inhabitants, the Roads, or Anchoring-Places, very bad; the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> to have one good Road, but very difficult for one unacquainted to enter, by Reason of the abundance of Rocks both sunken, and otherways; though most of these Descriptions I found to be false.</P>
<P>I passed the Remainder of the Night, very solita∣rily, lying with my Head to the North North-West. It blew a fresh Gale at North-East, cloudy, and sometimes overcast, hazy and windy-like to Wind∣ward.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="138"/>
In the Morning, as soon as the Day broke out clear, I could see from me East North-East, the <HI>Terra Vermilia,</HI> as it is called by the Inhabitants, and the <HI>Punte de Vermilharee,</HI> North-East and by North. I wore the Sloop, and put her Head away to the East-South-East, and made the Boy steer her, the Wind being then about the North-East and by North. I kept her away one Point from the Wind, because, having none but the Head-Sails, she would make no Way through the Water if I kept her hankering up in the Wind; and then I went to work, to overhale the Mainsail, which I found so torn, that it was past mending, neither had I Twine enough to do it, if it had not; wherefore I lashed the upper Reef Cringle down to the Boom, and tore, or cut the Sail, even at the Foot, all along the upper Reef; and where it wanted, I mended it as well as I could, and then set it; by which Time, it was as nigh as I could guess, three or four o' Clock in the Afternoon, when, to my great Surprize, I heard the Voice of Men in the Hold. I went to the Hatchway, and looking down, I saw three Blacks, who call'd to me, and asked me, <HI>If we were at an Anchor?</HI> I told them, <HI>We were at Sea.</HI> They asked me, <HI>If I could see any Land?</HI> I told them, <HI>I could not.</HI> They asked, <HI>Where I was design'd to go to?</HI> I told them, <HI>I could not tell, it must be where God pleased, and was re∣solv'd for the first Land that I could make, and was in Hopes, we should fetch St.</HI> Jago.</P>
<P><HI>At which they seem'd to rejoice, and got upon Deck, and one of them told me,</HI> That he was very well acquainted at the Islands of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> St. <HI>Philip,</HI> and St. <HI>John,</HI> and that he had been at all of them, and round them also. That he had been three Years and Inhabitant on the Island of St. <HI>John:</HI> That he was carried there from St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> in a <HI>French</HI> Pirate, who left him at the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>
where he remained three Years; and that the same Pirate came again, with whom he return'd to St. <HI>Ni∣cholas. The Pirate Captain's Name, he said, was</HI> Maringwin, <HI>a</HI> French Briton; <HI>and the Black that told me all this, was called</HI> Nicholau Verd.</P>
<P><HI>I asked them,</HI> How it came, that they did not go with their Countrymen when they went away with the Boat?</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> They were afraid the Boat would sink before they could get to the Land; besides, the rest of their Consorts were very much in Liquor, which made them the more afraid, and thought I might know better than they, and therefore believ'd they chose the least Danger, by staying with me, and hop'd if we should be put to any strange Land, that I would neither sell them for Slaves myself, nor suffer any Body else to do so.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> They might depend upon it, that they that made Slaves of them, should make one of me also.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> They came first on Board, with an Intention to serve me, in assisting me to gain the Port of <HI>Paragheesi,</HI> which my want of Sails, and other Necessaries, <HI>they said,</HI> had prevented; but that now they would gladly do any Thing that I bid them, and desired, that I would accept them as Servants.</P>
<P>They added, <HI>That they were very sorry their Comrades went away and left me, after they had drank off my Rum,</HI> though, by the Way, they themselves, as they afterwards told me, when they had got fafe on Shore, had also drank plentifully of it, and that was the chief Reason of their stay∣ing behind, having drank in the Hold till they fell dead drunk asleep, though now they pretended it was out of pure Love and Respect to me, and they would never leave me, but continue with me al∣ways Servants, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="140"/>
<HI>They asked me,</HI> What I thought of the Boat? and whether those that went in her, were got safe ashore or no? <HI>I was willing to encourage them, and told them,</HI> I believ'd not, and was much afraid they were all perish'd.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They did believe as much, and reckoned themselves happy in not accompanying them in their rash Folly; for they thought it could not be right, be∣cause I was so averse to it, and they were all sure, that I knew a thousand Times better then any of them, <HI>and abundance of such Parlavers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They also said,</HI> They had Relations, some on this Island, some on t'other; and if we could but arrive at this, or that Island, oh! I should want for nothing, but should be plentifully supplied with every Thing the Island afforded.</P>
<P>Night coming on (which prov'd clear over Head, but very hazy all round the Horizon) and it con∣tinuing a taut fresh Gale at North-East, I steer'd East-South-East, and South-East-and-by-East, all Night, and the next Morning, when the Day broke out clear, we saw the Peek of the Island of St. <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI> in the Form of a Sugar-Loaf above the Haze. We could not see any of the other Parts of the Island, though very high Land, the Haze seeming to be elevated above the imaginary Horizon, about twenty Degrees; and the Peek seem'd to have its Head elevated to thirty Degrees or more.</P>
<P>The Blacks were very much rejoiced at this Discovery of Land, but could not throughly give Credit to their own Eyes, and used every now and then, to distrust and fear, it was not certainly Land that we saw, and then they would come and ask me, to remove their distrust: And so often repeated their Questions, that I was throughly tired with their Interrogations.</P>
<P>I was in Hopes of seeing St. <HI>Jago,</HI> but it was so hazy, that I could not, though if it had been any
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
Thing clear, we might have seen it very plain; the Peek of St. <HI>Philip</HI> bore, when we saw it, from us South-East-and-by-South; and, as the Sun rose, the Haze was more elevated by his attractive Rays, that the Peek was altogether obfuscated, and hid from our Sight; which increased the Blacks doubt∣ing and confirmed their Opinion, that it was not real, but imaginary Land we had seen, neither could I perswade them, though I was as certain as was possible to be by the Sense of Seeing; but they were very much down in the Mouth.</P>
<P>I encourag'd them all that I could, by telling them we should be in with the Land before Night, to which they gave little Credit, supposing, as they told me afterwards, that I only told them so, that they might not be cast down.</P>
<P>I found, by the Bearing of the Land from me, with Consideration to the Course I had steer'd, that the Current set strong to the Westward, and therefore, notwithstanding the Island bore South-East-and-by-South, I resolv'd to steer South-East-and-by-East, being assur'd that the Current must needs set us down very near the Island, be∣fore we could run the Length of it; however, I knew we could not run so far wide of it, as not to see it, let it be never so hazy, and was re∣solv'd, if possible, to come in with it on the Weather Side, as being then capable of running down along the Shore at my Leisure, and view the Coast narrowly, to find some convenient Road or Bay to anchor in, or, at least, to run the Sloop on Shore in, to save our Lives, if we saw no Way or Prospect of doing better.</P>
<P>The Blacks tended the Pump, and told me, If the Boy and I would but steer, they would do that, or any Thing else I bid them do, that they were able; which was a great Help, as well as Encouragement to me, to what it was when the
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>
Boat, and, as I then thought, all the Blacks had left me and the Boy to shift for ourselves.</P>
<P>However, they continu'd very uneasy, and continually one or other of them was asking me, <HI>Whether I thought that was Land that we had seen? Whether I was sure of it? And how long I thought it might be before we should get Sight of it again,</HI> &amp;c.? But to their great Satisfaction, as well as mine, we saw it again, and seem'd to be very near it, the Top of the Peek being, as I suppos'd, 45 Degrees, or thereabouts, elevated above the Horizon; and we could see the Top of the great Mountain, which lies on the North-West Side of the Peek, which is the highest, excepting the Peek, on that Island.</P>
<P>The Land still continu'd discernible when the Haze was thin, which we could perceive to fly very fast over it, and this was about four in the Afternoon, and the Peek then bore South-South-East a little Southerly, and I then steer'd right down for the Island.</P>
<P><HI>The Blacks were exceedingly rejoic'd at this Sight, and mighty inquisitive to know,</HI> How long it would be before they could get ashore? <HI>I told them,</HI> I was afraid it would be very difficult to get ashore on this Island, having no Boat; besides, I thought there were but very few Inhabitants there, and therefore probably we might be in Danger of faring hard, or, perhaps, famishing; and that I was inform'd the Island of St. <HI>John</HI> was better; for that there were more Inhabitants on it, and pro∣bably we should there have a better Chance to find Necessaries to sustain Nature, till it pleas'd God an Opportunity offer'd for us to get off the Island; and that, besides, there was in it a good Harbour, if we should be so fortunate as to find it.</P>
<P><HI>To which</HI> Nicholan Verde <HI>answer'd,</HI> That my Informer gave me a very wrong Description of those

two Islands; for the Island of St. <HI>Philip</HI> was one of the most plentiful of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, for Maiz, Feshoons, Pumkins, Man-d'-yoaks, as also for Cows, Horses, Goats, Mules, &amp;c. for the latter of which, <HI>he said,</HI> they used to have formerly a great Trade with the <HI>French;</HI> and that it had three or four Times the Number of People on it that St. <HI>John's</HI> had; but the Harbours or Roads were indeed very bad, and a great Sea always tumbled in upon the Shore; and that it was dangerous even for one that could swim very well, to venture to swim ashore there, the Surf breaking in so heavy on the Shore, except at particular Times, as, namely, in the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> when the Northern Trade blew very weak.</P>
<P><HI>He added,</HI> That be was at that Island when a <HI>French</HI> Ship was there trading for Mules, &amp;c. and he observ'd that the Sea run so high for several Days together, that they were not able to send their Boat ashore sometimes for three or four Days successively, and used to curse the Island very often, because the Roads were so bad.</P>
<P>The Island of St. <HI>John, he said,</HI> was indiffe∣rently plenty, and had a Hundred or more Inhabi∣tants on it when he was there, which, as nigh as he could guess, was about twenty Years past, and had a very good Harbour, which he was positive he could direct me into as well as to any Part of the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> where he was born, and had liv'd all his Life, except that Time that he was carry'd off by the <HI>French</HI> Pirate <HI>Maringwin,</HI> who left him at St. <HI>John</HI>'s about three Years; and that he had been round both the Islands, and had been several Times, at several Places of these two Islands, as well as St. <HI>Jago,</HI> ashore with the said Pirates Boat, who always took him with them as a Linguist for them, by which Means he was very well acquainted, both
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
with the People and Landing-Places of all the three Islands.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> If he thought he could find the Way, and direct me into that Road without running foul of the sunken Rocks, it would do well for us all.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He would engage his Life to do it; <HI>whereupon I told him,</HI> I would lie by all Night to Windward of the Island of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> and a little before Day would bear away for the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> that we might have Day-light to get into the Harbour, and be the better able to shun the Rocks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They seem'd very much dissatisfy'd at this, fearing, if they did not directly get there, when Night came on they should lose Sight of the Land, and never attain it more, and had a great Cabal and Murmuring amongst themselves; after which, <HI>Nicholau Verde</HI> told me, <HI>That he thought I had better run for the Island of St.</HI> John <HI>directly, being sure we should get Sight of it before Night, and that then he would engage his Life to carry the Vessel safe into the Harbour let it be never so dark.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I did not think it proper, neither would it be safe; for the Weather being hazy, and it being almost Night, it would be impossible for us to get Sight of St. <HI>John</HI>'s before Night, and so per∣chance we might, by the Uncertainty of the Current, miss the Island, especially as we had no Candle on Board to see how to steer a direct Course by the Compass. Besides, <HI>I told them,</HI> the Night was likely to prove very dark and hazy, and we might be on the Rocks before we could see them, and so perish all together.</P>
<P><HI>Upon his insisting,</HI> That he was sure, if he could once see the Island, if it was never so dark be could find the Way into the Harbour; <HI>I told him,</HI> I would not venture in the Night; but if he was so positive he knew the Way into the Harbour in the
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
Night, I could the better depend upon him to find the Way in by Day.</P>
<P><HI>Whereupon they all said,</HI> That if I would not run in now directly, they were sure we should lose Sight of the Land before the next Morning, and then what could they or I either expect but to perish?</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> They need not fear that; for I would engage my Life to bring them to the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> with God's Assistance, by the next Day Noon at farthest, and did not fear but we should be much better off than their Consorts, (who, in all Likelihood, had rashly perish'd with the Boat) if <HI>Nicholau</HI> could but direct me into the Harbour.</P>
<P>So about half an Hour past six in the Evening, it being then duskish, I laid the Sloop a-try un∣der her Foresail, with her Head to the North-Westward, the Peek then bearing South-South-East, a little Easterly, and the North-East Point of the Island South-South-West, a little Wester∣ly; the Vessel came up to North-and-by-West, and fell off to the North-West-and-by-North.</P>
<P>The Blacks were so dishearten'd, for fear we should lose the Land, that they went down in the Hold, and there lay upon the Ballast, resolving not to see themselves perish; nor could I perswade any of them once to come up and take a Spell at the Pump all the Night, but were so dispirited, that they lay like dead People, not caring to stir, nor even to speak; so that the Boy and I was forc'd to look out, and tend the Pump, which I was the better able to do, because they had eased me of that Labour all the Day before.</P>
<P>I now and then catch'd a Nod as I sat on the Deck, and then took a Spell at the Pump, and then a Pipe of Tobacco, and so I pass'd the Night away till about four o'Clock the next Morning; at which Time I set the North Point of the Island, and it then bore South, a little
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
Easterly, distant, according to my Estimation, about four or five Leagues.</P>
<P>I then call'd to the Blacks to come up and help me to hoist the Mainsail, for that it was Time to make Sail, and bear away for St. <HI>John</HI>'s; but they would neither come up, nor answer, sup∣posing, as afterwards they told me, that I did it only to get them to pump, concluding, that we were out of Sight of all Land, and should ever remain so: So I was forc'd to bring the main Ha∣liards to the Windlace, and make the Boy hold on, while I hove the Mainsail up, as much as we had of it, which was not above half a Sail, it be∣ing shorten'd three Reeves.</P>
<P>After I had got the Mainsail up, I made the Boy put the Helm a Weather, and hoisted the Jib, and steer'd away for the North Point of the Island of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> keeping it a Point or better open upon the Larboard Bow.</P>
<P>After we had been under Sail about an Hour, or something better, they hearing me cun the Boy at the Helm, began to have a Mind to see or hear what I was doing; <HI>Nicholau</HI> call'd to me, and ask'd, <HI>Whether I saw the Land?</HI> I told him <HI>Yes; and that we were very near the Point of the Island (which was under our Lee-bow) when they went down, and were now sailing directly for the Island of St.</HI> John.</P>
<P>Upon this good News they all started up, and came upon Deck, and as soon as they saw we were so near the Land, contrary to what they ex∣pected, and even contrary to what they all thought was possible, they were very much rejoic'd and reviv'd, and immediately went to the Pump, and pumped the Vessel out dry; though there was not much Water then to pump out of her; for I sel∣dom let her stand half an Hour without pumping, dreading to let too much Water be in her at a
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
Time, for fear a large Spell would make me thirsty; and having nothing to quench my Thirst on Board, and very little to allay Hunger, the Rice and the Rum being almost gone, and the dry'd Shark I dar'd not eat of, it always making me very thirsty whenever I eat any of it.</P>
<P>By this Time 'twas Day, and doubling the Point of the Island, I haled more Southerly a∣long the Coast of the Island, till we got abreast of that Part of St <HI>Philip</HI>'s, call'd by the Inhabi∣tants <HI>The Ghors,</HI> which is very much noted for the exceeding hard and sudden Gusts of Winds that come off there, the nearer to which, the harder they are, and reach off the Shore about four Leagues, and then lose their fierce Violence. These Gusts are but weak in the Night, and ra∣ther weaker in the Morning till about ten in the Forenoon, at which Time the Sun rising above the Mountains, they blow prodigious hard till about four or five in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>We were, when abreast of it, about two Leagues from the Shore, and it being so early in the Morning, had not much of them, though it could not well have damag'd us for the Quantity of our Sails that we had spread; but the Rotten∣ness of them render'd them unable to have held out the Force or Violence of such of them, as might be counted very moderate, in respect of the more violent Flaws.</P>
<P>We could see the Island of St. <HI>John</HI> very plain, and I steer'd directly for it; and, in a little Time, raised the little Islands which lie on the North-East Point of the Island, and by the Natives call'd <HI>Ghuys;</HI> within which lies the best Road or Harbour in the Island, call'd by the Inhabitants <HI>Fuurno,</HI> which in their Language signifies <HI>an Oven;</HI> so call'd, I suppose, from the several Caves which are thereabouts.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="148"/>
As soon as we made the little Islands, I, by the Direction of my Pilot <HI>Nicholau,</HI> steer'd di∣rectly for the Eastermost of them, which was the highest, and kept it a little open on the Star∣board Bow, and so run till we were got within about half a League of the East End of it, and then kept along the Island till we were abreast of the West End, which hath a high rocky Point, almost like a Sugar-Loaf, with the Top broke off, not flat, but a little rounding. When we were got abreast of the last mention'd Point, we then steer'd for the North-East Point of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, by the Natives call'd <HI>Ghelungo,</HI> which bears from the West Point of the Eastwardmost of the little Islands about South-West-and-by-South, distant about a large League and a half, or two Leagues.</P>
<P>Then I began to ask my Pilot <HI>Nicholau, Where∣abouts the Harbour was?</HI> who very readily shew'd me, as he thought; but when we had sailed a little farther, then he shew'd another Place, and as we ran along, he still was shewing me a new Place for the Harbour; insomuch, that I plainly saw he was utterly ignorant: for every new Point of Land that we raised, still that was the Point, he said, that made the Har∣bour; insomuch that the other Blacks began to chide at him, and tell him, <HI>That they believ'd he knew nothing of it; and that either he never had been at the Island of St.</HI> John, <HI>or else this that we now saw, must be some other Land that he had never seen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I was positive this was the Island of St. <HI>John;</HI> and that they might certainly credit me; for I could not be mistaken in the Island, whatever was the Matter that <HI>Nicholau</HI> could not remember which, or where the Harbour was.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="149"/>
<HI>They said,</HI> They could not tell the Meaning of it, for the Land was so remarkable, that any Body, that ever had seen it but once, might know it again.</P>
<P>Nicholau <HI>said,</HI> He was sure it was the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> but it was so long since he had been there, that he could not, he saw plainly, know the Harbour at a Distance; yet he was sure he should know it when he came to it.</P>
<P>I asked him, <HI>If he was certain we were not past it already?</HI> He said, <HI>He was sure we were not,</HI> and so I kept on all along the Island, within about a Mile or less, of the Shore, that I might be sure not to miss it; and, at last, we discover'd it; but then we were got to Leeward, for the Harbour lies round a Point, and turning up to Windward, so that you cannot perceive its Opening, till you are past it; and under the Land, the Wind is always light, though it blows never so hard a Trade in the Offin, which makes a short popling Sea, and in a light Wind, makes it very difficult, for any Vessel to turn up under the Shore; but impossible to us, our Sails being so small, that the Vessel would scarce answer her Helm in that popling short Sea; and besides a strong Lee Current, which we perceiv'd to horse us down to Leeward apace.</P>
<P><HI>I asked my Pilot</HI> Nicholau, Whether there was no Place to Leeward, that we might Anchor at? <HI>He told me,</HI> No, and that if I did not put the Sloop ashore before I drove to Leeward of <HI>Punta de Sal,</HI> I should not be able to get ashore, but we must all of us certainly perish. <HI>I asked him,</HI> What he would advise me to do? <HI>He said,</HI> He would have me put the Sloop ashore upon the Rocks, and every one make their Escape as they could.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> Neither I nor the Boy could swim, and we should run as great a Hazard that Way, having no Boat, as by driving to Sea again.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150"/>
<HI>He said,</HI> As for his Part, since he was got so nigh the Shore, if I would not put the Sloop ashore my∣self, they could, and would, whether I wou'd or no.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I had a Gun ready loaden for any, or all of them, that should offer to do any Thing on Board of my Vessel against my Will. <HI>Upon which Words, he jump'd over-board, saying,</HI> He wished me well, and the rest that were with me, but would endeavour not to perish himself; <HI>and away he swam ashore.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The other Blacks told me,</HI> They could not swim well, and dared not to venture; but if they were sure they could safely swim ashore, they would not leave me, till I could also secure myself; but withal, they hoped I did not design to carry them away to Sea without any Water or Provisions.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I cared as little for starving, or pe∣rishing at Sea, as they could; neither did I design to go in this Condition any farther, than to find a con∣venient Place to Anchor the Sloop in; and, if not, to put the Sloop ashore in the best Manner, and at the most convenient Place I could find for our safe escaping ashore.</P>
<P>But, <HI>said they,</HI> Nicholau said, if you did not put the Sloop ashore, before you drove past that Point, <HI>(pointing to</HI> Punta de Sal) you cannot get ashore at all.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> Nicholau knew nothing of the Mat∣ter, as they might easily perceive, by his not know∣ing the Harbour before they were past it, and too late; for, <HI>continued I,</HI> had he known it, we had now, with God's Blessing, been safe in and moored; and, perhaps, I might have so recruited here, as to have been able to put you all ashore at St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> again.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="151"/>
At which, they began bitterly to cnrse <HI>Nicholau,</HI> and to wish that he might be drowned before he got ashore; or, if he did get thither safe, that he might break his Neck down the Rocks before he got quite up.</P>
<P>I told them, <HI>I was not out of Hopes yet, and was almost sure I should find an Anchoring-Place about</HI> Punto de Sal, <HI>and, with God's Assistance, would get them all safe ashore, if they would pump the Wa∣ter out of the Sloop;</HI> for our Eagerness of looking out for the Harbour, and Disappointment in missing it, had made me neglect the Pump, and she had a great deal of Water in her, insomuch, that with her rowling in the Sea, the Water washed over the Ballast.</P>
<P><HI>However, my black Ship-Mates told me flat and plain,</HI> They would not pump, nor do any Thing else, till they saw whether they should live or die; and, as soon as the Sloop was safe at an Anchor, they would then Pump, or do any Thing that I would de∣sire them.</P>
<P><HI>Ay, said I,</HI> I suppose to get ashore, and leave me as <HI>Nicholau</HI> has done.</P>
<P>Hereupon they made bitter Imprecations upon themselves, if ever they would leave me, or the Sloop, till I thought fit myself; but all that I could do, could not perswade them to pump one Stroke.</P>
<P>I run down along Shore, and haled in close to <HI>Punto de Sal,</HI> insomuch, that haling about the Point, a Man might almost have jumped ashore.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps be thought, that I was Fool-har∣dy for venturing so nigh the Rocks, without being acquainted with them; but if the Necessity I lay un∣der, and the Reasons that induced me to do so, be considered, I think I may be clear'd on that Head; for that Point being the Leewardmost Land of the Island that I could see, I did not know how the Land might trench away on the other Side of it: So, that,
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
as far as I knew, I might not be able to hale in with the Land on the other Side of the Point. I also observ'd it to be a smooth steep Rock, yet not so smooth but what it seem'd possible to get up it, and generally such Sort of Rocks are steep too; so that my Intention was, as soon as I had open'd the Land beyond the Point, if I had no Prospect either to hold the Shore on Board, or of an Anchoring-Place, to run her so nigh the Point, if Necessity so requir'd, that with the Way that the Vessel had, I could sheer her to the Rock, so that the Boy and I might jump ashore; for to drive to Sea as now we were, if we could any Ways avoid it, would be too great a Pre∣sumption.</P>
<P>As soon as I open'd the Land on the other Side of the Point, I discover'd a small deep little Bay, and luffing in about it, having my Lead ready upon Deck, I hove a Cast, and had thirteen Fa∣thom Water: I hove again, and had twelve Fa∣thoms, the Northern Stream being made, which sets strong into the Bay, and round the Point, check'd me in mainly. I hove the Lead again, and had ten Fathoms; the next Cast I had nine, and then I cockbilled my Anchor, and heaving one Cast more, I had eight Fathoms and a half. I not liking the Shore well, which to me look'd very ragged, which most-an-end denotes foul Ground, though, by the Lead, it seem'd to be both even and clear; I let go my Anchor in eight Fathom Water; and as soon as I had veer'd Cable enough to hold the Sloop, and stow'd the Sails, I took and rigg'd both Pumps, and took hold of one Pump-break myself, and bid them take hold of the other, and we should soon pump her out: But they said, <HI>They wanted Water, and were very dry, faint, and hungry, and unable to pump; but</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
<HI>they would swim ashore, and see for some Water, and come on Board again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> There was no Place nigh us, I be∣liev'd, that had any Water; neither did it look as if there were any; and therefore desir'd them to wait with Patience till the Morning, and to be sure some of the Inhabitants would come down to us, and per∣haps might bring some Provisions too, since they must needs know and bear of our Necessity by <HI>Nicholau,</HI> who I was sure would not fail to give them an Ac∣count who we were, and of our Necessities.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> They did not know but <HI>Nicholau</HI> might be drown'd, or devour'd by some Fish before he got ashore, and that they would not trust to that: That it might be, the Sloop would drive to Sea again in the Night.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> They need not fear that; and if we found no Relief before the next Noon, I myself would hale the Sloop in, and go with them ashore.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They would go ashore and get some Water, and would come off to me in the Morning betimes, and bring me some, if I did not go away with the Sloop in the Night.</P>
<P>So away they went overboard, and swam ashore, which was not far, being about a large Stone's Cast, and never came to me more.</P>
<P>It was Evening, and almost duskish, when they went away; but I could see some of the Natives up aloft on the Tops of the Rocks, but they did not come down that Night.</P>
<P>So the little Boy and I were again left alone to shift for ourselves as well as we could; and after I had put some Service in the Hawse, I fell to work at my old Trade of pumping, and was heartily tir'd before I got her suck'd; for being nigh the Shore, so that I could have made shift to have saved the Boy and myself, I was not so much afraid as when I was at Sea; which Fear, I found
<PB N="148" REF="154"/>
now, had made me so vigorous, and I thought, strong, that I was not then tir'd, as I could per∣ceive, at all; but now it seem'd not only tiresome, but tedious and irksome, insomuch, that I began almost to despair of being able to hold out without some other Assistance; however, with much to do, I, after a long and tedious pumping, got her to suck. She had as much, or more Water in her, than she had when the Pirates first left me; but then I had my biggest Boy to help me, who could pump as much as I could, and then I was more strong and vigorous, being pretty much fatigued, emaciated and debilitated since then.</P>
<P>However, I resolv'd with myself to keep her, if I could possible, till I could find, whether there was Hopes to get any Thing at this Island, so as to recruit, and enable me to run down to <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> for I hoped, if I could get a little Provisions, and persuade two or three of the Blacks to go with me to help me at the Pump, which, now she became so leaky, was the principal Part of the Work, the Sails, with a small Matter of mending, would serve to run down.</P>
<P>As soon as it was Day, three of the Inhabitants of the Island came down to the Sea-side, and haled the Sloop. I answer'd them. They ask'd me <HI>How I did?</HI> and welcom'd me to their Island. I thank'd them. They ask'd, <HI>Whether they might come on Board?</HI> I told them, <HI>They might if they pleas'd, or knew how, for I had no Boat.</HI> They said, <HI>They had a Boat of their own:</HI> At which they jump'd into the Sea, and swam off to me. As soon as they were come on Board, they ask'd me, <HI>Whe∣ther I was not an</HI> Englishman? I told them <HI>Tea.</HI> They said, <HI>They lov'd the</HI> English <HI>the best of any Nation,</HI> and ask'd me, <HI>Where the rest of my Company were?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="155"/>
<HI>I told them,</HI> The Pirates had taken all my Men from me.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They knew that, for <HI>Nicholau Verd</HI> had told them of that the Day before.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>said I, Nicholau</HI> is got ashore? Yes, <HI>said they,</HI> and he would have come down to you with us, but that he has hurt his Thigh and Hip against the Rocks as he was landing, insomuch, that if we had not been there when he came ashore, to help him out of the Water, he would have certainly perish'd; but, <HI>said they,</HI> we ask'd not for your Men, that is the <HI>Englishmen,</HI> but the Blacks which <HI>Nicholau</HI> told us he had left on Board when he swam ashore. <HI>I told them,</HI> They went ashore the preceding Night; and told me when they swam ashore, that they would come again on Board this Morning, and bring me some Water off with them; but I had not heard of them since.</P>
<P><HI>They ask'd me,</HI> If I had any Water on Board, for <HI>Nicholau Verd, they said,</HI> had told them, that I had had no Water when he came ashore, nor for a long Time before.</P>
<P><HI>I told them I had not one Drop. They said,</HI> If I would go on Shore, they had some Pompion there, and would make a Fire and dress some of it, and get me some Water.</P>
<P>I told them, <HI>I could not swim;</HI> at which they much admir'd, that any Man should venture to go to Sea without knowing how to swim.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That abundance of our Countrymen did; and that swimming was not so common amongst us, as it was amongst them.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> It was very strange, that we using the Sea more than any Nation, yea, even more than the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who had taught all the World to be Sailors, as they were inform'd, should not practice swimming: It was what they practis'd, <HI>they said,</HI> even from their Infancy, not excepting their very
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
Women; and that they should be afraid to go down upon the Rocks to fish, unless they could swim; for fear they should at any Time happen to fall into the Sea; in which Case, if they could not swim, they could expect nothing less than to be drown'd.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> If there was any Water nigh Hand? <HI>They said,</HI> Yes, <HI>and shew'd me whereabouts it was, and told me,</HI> If I would give them a large Calabash, they would swim over the Bay, and fetch some; for the Rocks were so steep, that if a Man went ashore on one Side of the Bay, he could not go round to the other Side, without swimming.</P>
<P>I thank'd them, and told them, <HI>I had no Cala∣bashes, but I had a small Cask;</HI> and bid the Boy hand up a half Anchor which was in the Hold.</P>
<P>When the Boy brought it up, they said <HI>it was too cumbersome to swim with, and they would there∣fore go ashore, and take their own Calabashes:</HI> Which are Gourds, that after all the Pulp and Seeds are taken out, are set to dry, and so become hard, and serve them to carry their Water to their Houses, as also when they go a fishing or hunt∣ing; for they never go abroad from their Huts without a Calabash of Water with them; and for their more easy Carriage of that, and their Pro∣visions, when they go a Journey, as also to bring home the Fish or Venison that they catch, they have every one of them a Goatskin, stripped off without cutting the Skin open, something like a Soldier's Knapsack; and the Hide of the Legs being stripped down to the Hoofs, and the Hoofs cut off with the Skin, serves to sling them for their more easy Carriage, which they do by mak∣ing fast the Feet of one Side together, and put∣ting their Arms through, by which Means they hang over their Backs with little or no Trouble to them, as they are so us'd to them.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="157"/>
They accordingly swam ashore; and by that Time they had reach'd it, there appear'd in Sight aloft on the Rocks, some more of them, who hallow'd and hoop'd much after the Manner of the <HI>Mandingo Negro's;</HI> from whom, I believe, they might take their Original, being very like them in Gesture, Manners, and Physiogno∣my, and using a great deal of the <HI>Mandingo</HI> Dia∣lect in their Speech.</P>
<P><HI>They were answer'd by the Blacks who swam ashore; at which they descended down the Rocks, and the others below waited for them till they came down, and, I suppose, told them of their being on Board, &amp;c. after which, these new∣come Blacks swam off, being three in Number, and came on Board, and ask'd me,</HI> How I did, <HI>&amp;c. and told me,</HI> They had brought nothing from the Town with them, because they did not know of my Necessity; saving two Pompions, which belong'd to those Blacks who were gone to fetch me Water, who had desir'd them to bring them off with them: That they also had met with the Blacks who came ashore last Night, and who, as they told them, were going to the Governor to get him to send me down some Men to pump the Water out of the Ship, for that there was a great deal of Water came in thro' her Bottom, and if the Governor did not send me down some Help, the Ship would sink; and that they were so tir'd with the Pump that they were almost dead; but had said nothing of my Want of Water and Provisions.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> Whether the Governor was a good Man or not?</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> He was an extraordinary good Man, and they believ'd he would have been down with me before now, but that he was very sick of a Fever and Cough, which he had had a long Time, insomuch, that he had not been out a hunting for
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
several Months; but they were sure I should have some Help down that Day; <HI>and desir'd me</HI> to shew them the Pump, that they might see what it was; <HI>which I did: And then they desir'd me</HI> to let them see how I work'd with it, that they might help me. <HI>Which I did very willingly, and they pump'd till it suck'd, and then I made them leave off.</HI></P>
<P>In about two Hours, the Blacks who went for the Water return'd, and brought two Calabashes full with them, which I believe might be about six Quarts: I then went to work to make a Fire, and the Blacks were so obliging, they would not let me make it, but made it themselves. I made the Boy get up a little Rice, and sliced a Pompion into the Pot with it, of which we made some good Pap, and, as soon as boil'd, we all eat heartily; after which, I gave them a small Dram of Rum apiece, for which they were very thankful.</P>
<P>I would have dress'd some of my dry'd Shark; but as soon as they saw it, they ask'd me, <HI>If that was not Fish call'd</HI> Sarde? I told them, <HI>I did not know.</HI></P>
<P>They ask'd me, <HI>Where I got it.</HI> I told them, <HI>I catch'd it at Sea;</HI> and when I told them after what Manner, they lifted up their Hands and Eyes, and much admir'd my Ingenuity in the Contrivance of catching it, and that any <HI>English</HI> should eat it; and were sure it was that Kind of Fish which they call'd <HI>Sarde,</HI> asking me, <HI>If it would not seize and devour an human Creature, if it should light on one in the Water?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> It would, and was a very voracious Fish. <HI>Then they said,</HI> It was the same; <HI>and di∣rectly, without asking my Consent, toss'd it all overboard, and said,</HI> They thought that no Man of any Nation would eat any Fish that fed upon human Flesh; but especially the <HI>English,</HI> whom they took to be the nicest and cleanliest People in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="159"/>
<HI>I told them,</HI> We did not use it commonly for Food, and that where Necessity did not enforce us, we al∣ways abhor'd such Food; but I catch'd it to keep me from starving, and yet, notwithstanding I had it so long on Board, and was reduc'd to such Want, I was sure there was not three Pound Weight of it eaten.</P>
<P><HI>Some said,</HI> It was better to eat any Thing than starve; <HI>others,</HI> That they would sooner starve than eat any Thing that lived upon human Kind.</P>
<P><HI>After we had eaten, and talk'd a while in this Manner, they began to talk among themselves about going to their Town, and told me,</HI> They wonder'd that the Governor had not sent some Men down to me, and believ'd that they who went from me to Town, had not spoke with the Governor, or perhaps they might be weary, or not find the Way to it; but they would go ashore, and make the best of their Way to Town, and speak to the Governor that Night, to send me some Help betimes in the Morning, and likewise to order me some Venison and other Pro∣visions; and did not know but some of themselves might come on the Morrow, if they were not too much tir'd; for, <HI>they said,</HI> it was an ugly difficult Way to Town, as well as long and dangerous, the Rocks being very apt to fall; but some of them would stay to help me to do what I wanted to be done, that was in their Power to do, and also go and catch me some fresh Fish.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd them, and desir'd them</HI> to give my Ser∣vice to the Governor, and desire him to send me ten or a Dozen Men down, to hale my Vessel further in∣to the Bay, to make her fast, and I would pay to his Satisfaction with any Thing I had on Board the Vessel.</P>
<P>They said, <HI>I need not fear having twenty, or more Men down on the Morrow;</HI> and so went a∣shore all together, two of them having concluded
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
to stay, but went ashore with the rest to catch some Fish for my Supper. They also pump'd the Vessel dry before they went ashore, as they had done all the Time that they were on Board.</P>
<P>Now I began to be a little up in my Spirits, seeing the People were so affable, and was in Hopes that the Danger of perishing by Famine was over. About duskish, the two Men who went a fishng return'd on Board, and brought a good handsome Dish of Fish, and a Calabash of Water with them, which we dress'd, with some Pompion; and after we had taken the Fish up out of the Pot, at their Desire, I made the Boy bring up a little Flower, and with it and the Fish-Broth we made some Pap, which by the Blacks was accounted a most favoury Dish, as also it was to me and the Boy, not having eat any hot or dress'd Victuals a long Time before.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> They would not have me trouble myself with the Pump, but the Boy and I might go to Sleep, and take a whole Night's Rest, which they did believe, <HI>they said,</HI> I very much stood in need of.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd them, and said,</HI> I would accept of their kind Offer; but desir'd, if I should chance to fall asleep, and it should blow, or fall Calm, or the Wind should shift, that they would not fail to call me; for, <HI>said I,</HI> if it should fall calm, the Vessel, by the turning of the Tide, might take a Turn with the Cable round the Anchor, and when the Anchor was foul with the Cable, it would not hold, but let the Vessel drive either on the Rocks, or else out to Sea, according as the Wind blew.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They would be sure to call me if Oc∣casion requir'd, or any Alteration happen'd different from what it was when I lay down.</P>
<P>So I smoak'd a Pipe of Tobacco which they had brought with them, and gave to each of them a
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
short Junk of Pipe, for I had no other left by the Pirates, and considering I could not employ or make Use of my Rum better, than to entertain such Guests as they were with it, I gave each of them a small Dram apiece, and told them, <HI>I had but very little of it now; but had a great deal of it when the Pirates took me, who had robb'd me of it all, except a little that lay in the Bottom of a Cask, which I believ'd they knew nothing of, or they had not left me that; but since I saw they were so kind to me, I could wish I had something better to give them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They thank'd me, and told me,</HI> They would ra∣ther have me keep it for myself, because, perhaps, I being used to drink it, might not so well be able to live without it; but as for their Parts they could do very well without it, tho' it was the best Liquor that ever they had tasted; having often heard of it, and several of their Islanders had drank pretty much of it, especially when the Pirates used to come thi∣ther; but for their Parts they never before tasted any <HI>Aqua ardenta, (which is the general Name they give to all hot Spirits, not knowing the Difference, or how to distinguish Rum from Brandy, &amp;c.)</HI> But they would not, <HI>they said,</HI> have me own that I had any on Board, for there were some of the Inha∣bitants who knew what <HI>Aqua ardenta</HI> was; and if once they came to know I had it, they would drink it all away from me, and then I should be destitute of something to comfort me, and perhaps die for want of it; for they had heard that their Food was so different and ordinary to what ours was, that an <HI>Englishman</HI> could not live upon it. Besides, their People not being used to any such, could not have any want of it, Water being their only Drink, and therefore more natural to them. They also had heard it related, <HI>they said,</HI> That a certain Pirate call'd <HI>Maringwin,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> which Country they did
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
not know but might be in <HI>England,</HI> having landed on this Island, <HI>(which, as my unlucky Pilot</HI> Ni∣cholau Verd <HI>told me, was about 20 Years before, and these two Blacks, by their Countenance, I judg'd to be about 24 Years of Age)</HI> had abun∣dance of that strong Water on Board, and was very free of it among the black People of this Island, who drank plentifully of it, and not being us'd to it, were mad for some Time after, and some of them fell sick, and dy'd of mad Fevers: Notwithstanding which, many that were now on this Island, were almost every Day wishing, that a Pirate, or any other Ship, would come and take them with them to some Country, where they might have enough of that hot Liquor to drink; and that they had often declar'd, they would certainly go with them.</P>
<P>Hearing this, made me in Hopes, that if I could recruit myself with a small Matter of Pro∣visions and Water, it would be an easy Mat∣ter, if what they said but now was true, to get three or four of them to go with me, to help to carry the Sloop down to <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> If there was good Store of Cotton on the Island.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> There was Cotton enough, but nothing nigh so much as had been, because the Seasons had not been so kindly, for want of Rain, as they us'd to be, nor their Island so plenty as formerly; but still, <HI>they said,</HI> they did not want, there being more by one half than they gather'd and made use of.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> If they did not make Cotton Cloths to sell.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> There was few or none on the Island but what had Cotton Cloths, and some had a great many; but no Ships coming to buy them, they gene∣rally made no more than they had Occasion for, for their own Use: But that, however, some Women had six or eight Cloths; of which Number, <HI>says one</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
<HI>of them,</HI> my Mother is one; but they wore them so seldom, that a Cloth would last some Years.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> Whether I could not get some Cot∣ton Thread to mend my Sails?</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> I need not fear that, they were sure no Body would refuse to give me a Skein or two of Thread for asking.</P>
<P>I told them, <HI>I would buy it;</HI> for I had some Glass Beads, and some old Cloths, &amp;c. than which you cannot have a more acceptable Com∣modity to traffick with those People.</P>
<P><HI>It growing late, (I believe near or about the Hour of ten) they said,</HI> They would have me go lie down and sleep, and they would look out for me, and call whenever there was Occasion, and would keep the Sloop always pumping dry.</P>
<P>Being pretty sleepy, and much fatigu'd by sit∣ting up all the Night before, I was willing to ac∣cept their Kindness, and gave them a half-Hour Glass, and shew'd them, that in a certain Space of Time, all the Sand would run out of the upper Glass into the lower, and then, by turning the End which had the Sand in it, uppermost, in the same Space the Sand would run again into the other End; and so by turning the Glass as soon as the upper End was empty, they might know how the Time pass'd; and that it would be enough to pump the Vessel every Time they turn'd the Glass, and when they had suck'd her, to let the Pump stand till the upper End of the Glass was empty; and then to turn the Glass and pump again.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They would; <HI>and ask'd,</HI> How many Times the Glass must run out, and be turn'd again, to make that Space of Time which I call'd an Hour? <HI>Having told them</HI> twice, <HI>they ask'd me,</HI> Whether the Glass would run the Sand in that Time if every one went to Sleep, as exactly as if it was watch'd?</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="164"/>
<HI>I told them,</HI> It was all the same; <HI>and they ask'd me,</HI> If I knew how many Glasses would run out be∣fore the Day appear'd.</P>
<P><HI>I said,</HI> I could, if they took Care to turn the Glass again as soon as the upper End was empty, and not before, provided I could know exactly what Hour of the Night it was when the Glass was first turn'd.</P>
<P>But how will you do to know that, <HI>said they?</HI></P>
<P>I have a Thing, <HI>said I,</HI> by which I could tell by the Stars, if the North Side of the Sky were clear to the Water; but now I cannot, because the Land hinders me.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They believ'd all White Men were <HI>Fittaseers</HI> (i. e. <HI>Conjurers.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> We utterly detested having any Cor∣respondence with the Devil, and in our Country when any one was found guilty of Sorcery, he or she was by the Law of the Land immediately burn'd.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> It was a very good Law, and they wish'd they would do so there also; But, <HI>said they,</HI> we do not mean, when we say all White Men are <HI>Fitta∣seers,</HI> that they are such evil Persons, or commit such Mischievousness as our <HI>Fittaseers</HI> do, or that you are beholden to the Devil for your Skill, as ours are: We rather think you are more ingenious, and know more than the Devil himself does; and there∣fore we do believe, that it is not in the Power of our <HI>Fittaseers,</HI> with all their Skill and Assistance of the Devil, to hurt a White Man, especially if he be a <HI>Scholastico,</HI> (i. e. <HI>an Artist, or Man of Learning)</HI> as they believ'd most Strangers to be, who were <HI>Pilo∣to's,</HI> and therefore when I went up to Town, they hoped I would do something to affright them, so as to make them forbear hurting them and their Cattle, and especially little Children, against whom they had such a Spite, especially if their Parents had any Ways offended them; that in some Families they would not
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
suffer a Child to live, but would so bewitch it, that in a little Time it would pine away, and die.</P>
<P><HI>I was willing to keep up their Esteem of me, and told them,</HI> I would see what was to be done in that Matter when I went up to their Town, which I design'd should be as soon as the Governor sent me down some Men to help me, and that I had got the Sloop a little better made fast, and farther into the Bay.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> I should have Hands enough by the Morrow; <HI>and ask'd,</HI> How many Glasses they must turn to make it the Middle of the Night? And how many more to bring Day? And if I could not guess this, within two, three, or four Glasses, by any of the other Sides of the Sky besides the North?</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I did believe I could; <HI>and so gues∣sing the Time of the Night to be about ten, I bid them,</HI> turn the Glass then, and let it run out, and turn it thrice more, and that would bring Midnight; and then turn it eleven Times more, and that would very near, or quite bring Day; <HI>asking them,</HI> If they could be sure to keep a true Account of the Num∣ber of Glasses which they turn'd?</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> Yea: Then, <HI>said I,</HI> you can reckon well I suppose: <HI>They said,</HI> Yes, yes, they would have me to think they were not like the <HI>Terra firma Preato's</HI> (i. e. <HI>Mainland Blacks)</HI> for although they were black, yet they believ'd there was a God and a Christ, and they thank'd St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> and were be∣holden to him above all the Saints, even more than to St. <HI>John,</HI> who was the Guardian Saint of their Island, and under whose Care they had been put by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> when they first brought their Fore∣fathers from the <HI>Terra firma,</HI> and plac'd them on this Island. Yet, <HI>said they,</HI> we are more obligated to St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> because it was he that directed the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and conducted them with us to this Island, through whom we not only came to the Know∣ledge
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
of himself, but also of God, Christ, St. <HI>John,</HI> and also of all the other Saints that we know; and of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who is God's Mother, and can command her Son to do any Thing she pleases; and we are sure that God cannot deny his Mother, which is the Reason that we oftner pray to her than to God, or Christ; because she being a Woman, is more easily perswaded, as are almost all Women, than Men.</P>
<P><HI>They added,</HI> That a great many of them could both read, write, and cast Accompt, though they own'd they had not the Use of Figures like the <HI>English,</HI> who, as they had been inform'd, exceeded all People in the World, for Navigation, Physick, Conju∣ration, and Arithmetick; even the <HI>Portuguese</HI> them∣selves, from whom they had learned all that they knew; and therefore, as we exceeded the <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI> who were their Teachers, so it could not be otherwise but we must abundantly exceed them.</P>
<P>They then repeated their Desire, that I would go to sleep; whereupon I bid them good Night, charging them to be sure to call me if they saw any Alteration; which they promis'd, and I went to my Cabbin, and mus'd and contemplated on my present Condition, as well as what Means I could use to extricate me out of it, with a hear∣ty Desire that the Almighty would direct me in the best Way and Method; and seeing it a fine Night, and a steady, fresh, yet moderate Wind, blowing the right Trade, and likely so to conti∣nue, I at last fell asleep, and held it till about four or five in the Morning; at which Time awaking in a Sort of a Surprize, as not being a long Time used to such long and undisturb'd Sleeps, I arose, and came upon Deck, and found my two new Shipmates sitting forward, talking together.</P>
<P>I bid them a good Morning, and ask'd them, <HI>How they had pass'd the Night?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="167"/>
<HI>They said,</HI> Very well; <HI>and ask'd me,</HI> How I had slept?</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> Very well. <HI>They said,</HI> They were got forward to talk, because they would not wake or disturb me; and thought, considering the Watch∣ing and Fatigue I had had, that I should not have waked before the Sun was up.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I had not had such a long or sound Sleep in a great while before; <HI>and ask'd them,</HI> How long it was since they pump'd? <HI>They said,</HI> They pump'd when they turn'd the Glass, which was about half out, and I took the sounding Rod and sounded, and found the Sloop had not above eight Inches Wa∣ter in her.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> That the last Time they pumped, for fear they should not do right, they call'd the little Boy, who told them, that she was dry enough, and then they made him go to sleep again; but were loth to wake me, lest I should not go to sleep again presently, which they knew the Boy would presently do.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> How many Glasses they had got out? or, Whether they had not let them stand?</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They had not let them stand at all; after it was out of one End, they immediately turn'd it; and that this Glass that was now running, was the tenth; and that they had watch'd it the narrower, to see if it could tell them when Day came.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That it would be Day, I believ'd, before two Glasses more run out, besides that which was then running.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>they said,</HI> if it was so, that would be just as I had told them before I went to sleep; and if it so fell out, they should think it was one of the most ingenious Things that ever they had seen in their Lives; and that as I had told them in the Beginning of the Night, that I could not tell the exact Time of the Night, being hinder'd by the Land, so if the
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
Day came in the thirteenth Glass, they thought it was exact enough. <HI>They ask'd me,</HI> Whether I would not go and take another Nap of Sleep? <HI>I told them</HI> No; but they might, and I would look out and tend the Pump. <HI>They said,</HI> No; they had ra∣ther watch and count the Glasses till Day; and as for the Pump, they would not have me trouble myself with that any more, for I should always have Men enough while I was here, that would come of their own accord, and take Turns on Board.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> By what I had already seen of them, I had no Reason to believe that I should want Help, or any Thing else that the Island afforded.</P>
<P>They ask'd me, <HI>If I would smoak a Pipe of To∣bacco.</HI> I thank'd them, and told them, <HI>Yea.</HI> So they rummag'd their Pouches, but betwixt them could hardly make a Pipe full, they having ex∣pended the Stock which they had brought from Home: Whereupon I told them, I had some Tobacco yet, which the Pirates had left me, and offer'd each of them a Pipe, which they thank∣fully accepted; and so we pass'd the Time till Day, which broke out a little after they had turn'd the twelfth Glass; at which they much wonder'd, that such an inanimate Thing should measure and keep Time so exactly, and that they who had Life and Sense in them, could nothing nigh measure or guess Time as that did; and sometimes they said there was something of Ma∣gick in it</P>
<P>About Sun-rise there was a great Noise, and calling from the Tops of the lower Rocks, as if there had been a hundred People. The Blacks which were with me on Board, told me, they be∣liev'd these that I heard whooping upon the Rocks, were the Forerunners of the Company which the Governor had sent. I said, I wish'd it might be so; and that by the Noise they made, there
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
seem'd to be a great many: But they said it was only the sounding of the Rocks, which made me think so; but they knew there were but two Men.</P>
<P>The Reader will perhaps wonder how I came to be so perfect in their Language so soon, it being the first Time I came among them: But I must acquaint him, That the Ground or Original of their Language is the same with that of their Stock, which was, as I hinted before, from the <HI>Mandingo Negro's;</HI> from which they retain a Dialoct, as well as a great many of the primitive Words of that large Nation, and far extended Language; and the rest of it is made up of a corrupted <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and some other Words, which seem to be coined or invented since their Settlement here, and incorporated by Use with their hodge-podge Language.</P>
<P>Now I had a tolerable Smatch of the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> Language, which is the most significant Part of their Dialect: Besides, they have so many Motions (as indeed most of the Inhabi∣tants of the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> Islands have, especially those of this, and the Island of St. <HI>Philip)</HI> that thereby, and by the Accent, which gives Life and Force to their Meaning, of which I had some Notion before, that they serv'd very much to explain what they said. I also understood some∣thing of the general barbarous Language of the Windward Islands, which comes so nigh to the Language of the Leeward Islands, as in a great Measure enabled me to apprehend the Purport of what they said in the general, and to make us understand one another; but yet so obscurely and confusedly, and with so much Difficulty, as would have render'd an Interpreter necessary, could such a one have been had; tho' perhaps he could not express himself with the Emphasis or
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
Force that I could, however, he might be a better Master of the Tongue. But to return: The Blacks waited a while to see if they would come down; but seeing they did not, they said they would go ashore and meet them, and send them on Board, and they themselves would go a fish∣ing, and bring some on Board for Dinner: So away they swam on Shore.</P>
<P>Some Time after, two Men came down, and swam on Board, being the same who had whoop'd in the Morning, and brought with them a Pom∣pion; and told me, that the other two, who had been on Board all Night, were gone a Fishing, and would be back about Noon, and had given them a great Charge to mind the Pump; and desir'd me to shew them what they must do.</P>
<P>This I very readily did, and they as readily wrought as they were taught; and about twelve or one o'Clock, the other two return'd with a handsome Dish of Fish, which we dress'd with some Pompion, and, as before, made some Pap with the Fish-Broth, and made a hearty Meal thereon; but my Mess-mates desir'd me not to use my Flower, but keep it for myself, and Boy; which they all took to be my Son, and still be∣lieve to be so.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> I should not get any such Food here, as my Flower was; and that if the Priest heard that I had any, he would, they believ'd, ex∣pect me to give him some.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That I had but a very little; but the Priest, Governor, or any Body else on the Island, was very welcome to that, or any Thing else that I had on Board.</P>
<P>I waited and expected to have some Help down, but none came; and in the Afternoon it began to blow, and look'd dark, cloudy, and heavy to Windward, over the Land, which is a certain
<PB N="165" REF="171"/>
Sign of a Gale of Wind, so that I began to fear, if it should blow hard, and my Ground-Tackle give Way, I should drive out to Sea, and then should be in a worse Condition than ever I had been yet: I propos'd therefore to them, to swim with the End of a small Rope ashore, and by that to hale a Cable-end, and make it fast to the Rocks; which they did, but so slightly, that it slipt; and all the Arguments that I could use to persuade them, could not prevail with them to try once more, and to carry a Fast ashore: Which made me very disconsolate, the Wind in∣creasing still: They seeing me dissatisfy'd, and asking the Reason, I told them, <HI>That I could ex∣pect nothing but to perish, if I and the Boy should drive again out to Sea;</HI> and told them, <HI>how safely that might be prevented, if I had a Cable well made fast ashore.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They had try'd already, and the E∣vening now grew cold; besides, they were so spent and tired with what they had done, that they could not pretend to get it ashore again; besides, they knew that they could never make it well fast; but they were sure there were some Men would come down the next Day from the Town without fail, that could make fast my Cable to the Rocks, or do any Thing else that I had occasion to have done.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I did not know what Sort of Ground we had in the Bottom, and did not know but it might be rocky, and would cut my Cable; which, if it did, I could expect nothing but to drive to Sea, and perish, having no Way to escape to the Land, and no Boat, and neither the Boy nor I being able to swim one Stroke.</P>
<P><HI>They bid me not be dishearten'd,</HI> For they would manage that well enough; And, <HI>said they,</HI> we two that tarry'd with you on Board last Night, will go up to Town to Night; and will go to the Governor
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
as soon as we come up, and speak to him to order Men down to help you, and will come down with them ourselves; and the other two Men who came down to Day, will stay on Board with you, to pump, or do any Thing you desire them, that they can, till we come back again; and if the Vessel should drive away, you need not fear but what we would safely and securely get you ashore, and the Boy also; <HI>and pointing to the Cross-jeck Yard which lay upon Deck, they said,</HI> With that they could carry me a hundred Times farther than from thence to the Shore, with Ease.</P>
<P>I thank'd them; and desir'd them to take a little Flower up with them for the Priest and Go∣vernor, and with it to give my Service to them, and desire them to send some People down to me, and to be sure to get <HI>Nicholau Verd</HI> to come with them, because he would be more serviceable than they, by reason he could make fast a Rope, or do any Thing else much more handy than any of them could.</P>
<P>They told me, It was better to let the Flower alone; because they had a long, as well as a dangerous Way to climb up the Rocks, and that it was now so late, that were it not that my Ne∣cessity requir'd it, they should not care to climb up those steep, as well as rotten Rocks; but they would tell both the Priest and Governor of it, with the Reasons of their not bringing it up with them, and desire them to send some Body down for it themselves: So away they went ashore.</P>
<P>It continu'd to blow at Night, as it had done in the Afternoon; but towards Day it was a little moderate, and the Sun rose pretty clear, only, be∣fore his Rising, it shewed very hazy and fiery to the North-East and East-North-East Board, which the two Blacks that were on Board with
<PB N="167" REF="173"/>
me, said, was a great and sure Sign of very hard Gales of Wind, as the Day increas'd, and the Sun rose up higher; but more especially after the Sun began to fall. All which came to pass very exactly, though I could see nothing that portend∣ed any Thing of a hard Gale.</P>
<P>After the Sun had mounted about 30 Degrees of Altitude, it began to blow very hard, and the Flaws came down the Rocks with an incredi∣ble Force, even beyond what I could believe to have been in the Wind, if I had not felt it: Sometimes they would come right off the high rocky Land, and sometimes a counter Flaw would blow right counter to that on the Land, and raise up the Water beyond what I ever saw a Whale or Grampus do, to an almost incredi∣ble Degree; and if they took the Sloop at any Time on the Bow, Quarter, or Broadside, she would heel to it, more than any Body would believe that had not seen it. Indeed they did not hold long, some a Minute, or half a Minute, some came with a sudden Puff, and would be gone again before she brought her Cable taut.</P>
<P>I could not tell what to do; but often wished that the Boy and I were safe ashore, and fre∣quently looked out, to see if I could perceive any of the Blacks coming down the Rocks to us; but all in vain.</P>
<P><HI>About two in the Afternoon it ceased a little, but still continued to blow very hard, though not in such strong Flaws as it did, and I began to hope the Heart of the Gale was broke; and about three in the Afternoon, the two Blacks who went up the Evening before, came down, and swam off on Board, and was glad to see that we were not drove out to Sea.</HI> They were afraid, <HI>they said,</HI> they should have been blown off the
<PB N="168" REF="174"/>
Rocks, as they were a coming down; <HI>and told me.</HI> They had been with the Priest and the Governor, who had told them, they had both of them spoke to the People, and had ordered so many to come down to assist me, that they thought I had had Help be∣fore them: That thereupon they went to speak to the People; but found them all unwilling to come down, nor did they care to give them any Reason wherefore: That they went also to find <HI>Nicholau Verd,</HI> to get him to come with them, as I had de∣sir'd them, but they could not find him: That at last one told them the Reason that none of them would venture to come down; which was, that <HI>Nicholau</HI> was afraid to come on Board, for fear I should carry him to Sea again, and had prepossess'd the rest with the like Fear.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They did all that they could to per∣suade them that their Fears were groundless, but all in vain; wherefore, seeing they could not prevail with any of them, they came down themselves to let me know it, and to do me any Service they could.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd them, and told them,</HI> The only and best Service they could do me, was to get the Rope ashore, as they did the Day before, and make it well fast; and then, if the Cable at the Anchor gave Way, I could always hale or heave the Sloop to the Rock, and by that Means the Boy and I should have a fair Chance to save our Lives.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> If that was all, they would carry me and the Boy ashore now, and they would stay in the Sloop.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd them, and told them,</HI> I would rather stay on Board, while I had any Hopes of saving her; and wish'd they would carry a Rope ashore, which would be a Means to prevent the Anchor-Cable being cut with the Rocks, which otherways I could expect no less, by her ranging and sweeping
<PB N="169" REF="175"/>
the Ground so with the Cable, with the uncer∣tain and variable Flaws.</P>
<P>They said they would; so I bid them carry the small Rope ashore, and make it fast to the Rock, and then we would hale the Sloop to the Rock, and I would go ashore myself and make fast the Cable; which accordingly they agreed to; so I unreev'd the Topping Lift, the Main Haliards, and Jibb Haliards, and bent them, and three of the Blacks jump'd into the Sea, one of them taking the End of the Rope, the other two taking the Bite at a Distance, the one from the other, as I directed them, and got the End ashore, and made it fast; and then they came on Board again, and I unbent the main Sheet, and unreev'd it, which was a new Rope, that I had bought at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and bent it to the Cable that was at the Anchor, to lengthen it, to veer the Sloop to the Rock; which we did, by veer∣ing the Cable, and heaving in the Shore-fast, till we hove the Sloop to the Rock Side, which was as steep up and down as a Key, and about two Fathom Water at the Rock Side.</P>
<P>I then jumped ashore, and made fast an End of a Cable to the Rock, and casting off the Rope from the Shore, I veered off by the Cable made fast ashore, and hove in upon the Anchor-Cable, 'till I got her off in her Birth again; but still being dubious of the Anchor Cable sweeping and ranging the Ground, I was willing to see whether it was rubbed, chafed, or stranded any where, and bending the main Sheet to the Shore-Cable, to lengthen that, I hove a Peek on the Anchor, and found it rubbed in several Places, and in one Place, better than a whole Strand cut through.</P>
<P>My Design was, as the Wind then blew off Shore, and not now extraordinary hard, though still a taut Gale, and the Sloop riding altogether
<PB N="170" REF="176"/>
by the Shore-fast, to have hove the Anchor up, and to cut the Cable off where it was stranded, and bend it again to the Anchor, and let it go under Foot, and then veer upon the Anchor-Cable, and heave in upon the other Cable that was fast ashore, and so ride moored: But all of a sudden, the Blacks laid down their Hand-Spikes, and told me, I was going to carry them away to Sea, and looked very angry: I told them, no, and shewed them the Cable where it was cut, and did all that I could to persuade them out of their Opinion, and urged my Necessity for what I was going to do, and that the Sloop could not be saved without doing it; and also, that I dared not do it, until I had got a Cable fast on the Shore.</P>
<P>They told me, I had made it fast, so that it would loose whensoever I had a Mind it should, and that it was only to amuse them, the better to decoy them away: That if I had served some of them that was upon the Island, as I intended to serve them, they would kill me directly; but they would not do me any harm, but would run no more Hazard, by assisting me, to be carried away to any Place, where they should never see their Friends or Home any more.</P>
<P>I endeavoured all I could to pacify them, not knowing what Danger such a Notion might bring me into; and, perhaps, fix an Odium on me from those, who, in all Likelihood, were to be my Neighbours during a long Time; at least, longer than I desired, if not for all my Life; and at last persuaded them to lend me a Hand to hale in again the Shore-fast, and moor her again be∣tween that and the Anchor, which they did, and then began to talk to one another about going ashore.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="177"/>
I did all I could to persuade them to stay on Board, not so much for their Assistance, as for fear they should spread a Notion, that I was going to carry them away from the Island; for I had a good Cable End ashore, and well made fast, so that the Boy and I could, at any Time, heave her in to the Rock Side, when the Anchor-Cable gave way, and, without any Danger, in a man∣ner, step ashore.</P>
<P>I much importuned them to tarry with me this Night, and not to go ashore 'till the Morning.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> I might endeavour to persuade them to this, in order to have the better Opportunity to carry them to Sea in the Night.</P>
<P><HI>I represented</HI> how unprovided I was, both for Sails, Provisions, and Water, which was the only Reason that brought me there: That they all knew very well, I had not recruited in the least with any thing since I came there: Besides, they were Four strong, lusty Men, and I but one, and weak, and half famished; and that the Boy could be reckoned as no-body.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> That I had a <HI>Spring Guarda</HI> (i. e. <HI>a Musket)</HI> and with it, could kill Twenty or Thirty of them, and therefore they were sure, if they resisted, to be killed; but would rather perish here, than be compelled by Force to go with me; and, that that was the Reason which made <HI>Nicholau Verd</HI> jump over-board from me into the Sea, and make his Escape to them, because he knew, that as long as I had the <HI>Spring Guarda,</HI> I could make him, and a Hundred more, if they should oppose me, die, or sub∣mit to what I required of them.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> If that was what they were afraid of, I would bring it up, and put it into their Hands, for their Satisfaction and Security, and thereby give them an Occasion to see, that I was not at all afraid to venture my Life into their Power, and that volun∣tarily,
<PB N="172" REF="178"/>
without any Compulsion, more than the Desire to satisfy them.</P>
<P>Hereupon, I went down into the Cabbin and brought it up, and it being loaden, I fired it off, which a little surprized them; but I told them, it was only to clear it, so that it should not harm them.</P>
<P>They took it, and seemed to be better satisfied, and concluded, all Four of them, to stay on Board all Night, which they did; during which, it con∣tinued to blow a taut Gale, with hard Squalls off the Land, but nothing so hard as those which we had the preceding Day.</P>
<P>We passed the Night as well as we could, and they would have had me gone to sleep; but I could not all the Night, though, to please them, I went and lay down, but had too many Thoughts to let me rest.</P>
<P>In the Morning it looked as it did the Day be∣fore, and, I thought, more fiery and red; and the Blacks told me, It would blow very hard as soon as the Sun was risen up above the Mountains, and, they believed, harder than it did the Day before.</P>
<P>I told them, That I hoped their Fears which they had of me the Evening before, were over, and that therefore, they would assist me to weigh the Anchor, to cut the Cable where I shewed them, the Day before, it was stranded, in order to secure the Sloop.</P>
<P>They said, They would not meddle with it yet, 'till some more Men came down, which they did expect.</P>
<P>I said, I believed no-body would come down, 'till some of them went up to Town.</P>
<P>They said, Yes there would, for they were sure some of them would come down on the Rocks to see whether the Sloop was gone or no, and as
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
soon as they saw any of them, they would call to them, and they were sure they would venture to come on Board, when they had spoke to them; so I was forced to be easy, and wait their Lei∣sure.</P>
<P>About Nine or Ten o'Clock, it began again to blow much harder, if it was possible, than it did the Day before, and we were all as wet, as if we had been thrown into the Sea, with the Spray, or what else you please to call it, which the Sea hove up into the Air like a Water-Spout; inso∣much, that sometimes we could not see the Land, though it was so nigh and so high.</P>
<P>We saw several People on the Rocks, but it blew so hard, that they could not hear us, and sometimes could not see us, when the Spray was whirled up by the fierce Gusts encountering one another.</P>
<P>About Twelve or one o' Clock in the Day, which was the 29th of <HI>November,</HI> 1722, the Anchor-Cable parted with a Counter-flaw on the Land, and drove us on a Point of broken Rocks, which lay in the Bay. We did all we could to heave in upon the Cable that was fast on the South-East Point of the Bay, to clear the Sloop of that Point of broken Rocks, over which the Sea broke very much; but all in vain, for the fierce Gust blowing right on, carried us upon them, maugre all the Art and Diligence we could use to the contrary, and sticking there, the Sea struck so forcibly, that it soon made Way for the Water to come in through her Bottom, and, in a very short Time, the Water was almost as high within, as without, and the Sea being raised like a Water-Spout, with the Violence of the Winds encountering one another, something like the Whirlwinds raising the light Sands on the De∣sarts of <HI>Africa,</HI> insomuch, that we could not see
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
the high Lands over us, only the Shore under∣neath, and the Violence of the Sea and Weather, struck so upon the Sloop, that I expected, at every Stroke, the Mast would have jumped out, and could hardly tell which way to stand, to be clear of the Fall of it.</P>
<P>This frightful Situation made all the Blacks get ashore, and leave the Boy and I alone; but as the Sloop did not heave nor strike so much when the Bottom was broke and opened, so that the Sea had a free Passage in and out, as it did before, and the Boy crying and making a pitiful Lamen∣tation, and the Violence of the Flaw of Wind being a little abated, Two of them came off, their Fright being a little over, and one of them took the Boy and carried him ashore: The other asked me, if I would go, which I consenting to, he advised me to tarry 'till he went ashore and got some more of them to help him, because, the sunken Rocks were so very sharp, and, in some Places, the Water so shallow, that one of the Blacks was very much cut by them, as he was getting ashore; but if I had any Cloaths to send ashore, he said, he would carry them with him now, and then would come with some of his Con∣sorts to help me off.</P>
<P>Upon this, I gave him what Things I could find swimming about the Cabbin, and he went down and fished all the old Cloaths and Rags he could find, and went ashore with them, and af∣terwards came off with Two more, to carry me likewise thither.</P>
<P>I would have taken the Cross-Jeck-Yard, which lay lashed to the Side upon Deck, to have swam upon, and they to guide it; but they said, That would be the Way to lose my Life and theirs too, because of the shallow Water over the sunken Rocks; adding, That if the Sea-Breaks should
<PB N="175" REF="181"/>
drive us against another Rock, it would, pro∣bably, beat them all to Pieces, and wash me off the Yard; but when they had only me to take care of, they should do much better.</P>
<P>I proposed something to help buoy me up, for fear I should be too heavy for them, as I could not swim at all; but they said, They did not doubt in the least, to convey me safe, with the Help of St. <HI>Anthonio,</HI> who, they were sure, would assist them, because they had said a <HI>Padre nos</HI> be∣fore they came off.</P>
<P><HI>Upon my telling them, I trusted in God and Christ to help me, They said,</HI> So did they; but as they had desired St. <HI>Anthonio,</HI> it was the same as if they had asked God, or Christ, he being God's Friend, who would not therefore deny him any thing; and they always chose to ask him, or any of the Saints, because, as they were formerly Men, they had a thorough Sense of their Wants, and were al∣ways compassionate, and ready to help them.</P>
<P>So Two of them getting into the Water, the other staid to ease me down to them, and calling upon St. <HI>Anthonio</HI> to help them, and bidding me call upon my Saint to help me, after they had settled themselves in the Water, they bid me come in, which I did, and one took me under one Arm, and the other under the other, bidding me lie still in the Water, and to be sure to keep my Feet together, that they might not impede theirs in their swimming, while the Third, leaning over the Sloop's Gunnel, held me by the Head till they fixed and settled them∣selves, and then they launched off, bidding me not to fear, but trust in St. <HI>Anthonio,</HI> which was all one as to trust in Christ: To which I made no Answer, it not being a Time to argue, but com∣mended myself to the Almighty, who alone is able to deliver out of Dangers.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="182"/>
About Midway, they swam with me over a shallow Rock, which I touched with my Feet, and just as we got over it, a Sea came up with us, and breaking upon us, one of the Blacks dived down with me under Water, and then let me go, which frightened me pretty much; but the other held me fast, and brought me up again, and the Third Black, who swam close after us, as soon as he saw that I was quitted by one of them, darted up along-side of me like a Fish, and sup∣plied the Place of him who had forsook me, and, through the Assistance of a merciful God, we got safe to Shore.</P>
<P>He that had slipped me in the Water, seeing the other had taken hold of me, swam back again to the Sloop, to see if there was any Thing to be got, worth saving for me; and took down the Looking-Glass, which was fix'd up in the After-part of the Cabbin, and found three Stockings, and a Pair of old Shoes; all which he brought ashore with him; and before he had well reach'd it, the Stern, with the After-part of the Deck, parted, and drove away; and presently after came two terrible Gusts off the high Lands, tum∣bling down through Gullies in the Rocks, as though they would over-turn the Rocks and Moun∣tains, and encountering one another on the Sur∣face of the Sea, rais'd the Water to a great Height; and the Counter-Gust overcoming the other, brought down upon us such a heavy Shower, like a Deluge, that we could not tell where to get out of the Way of it, and, indeed, I began to fear we should perish, notwithstanding we were got safe to the Land; for where we were come ashore, there was no Passage for me to get up, hardly high enough to keep clear of the Wa∣ter, when it was full Sea.</P>
<P><PB REF="183"/>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="177" REF="184"/>
the Squall being over, and the Air cleared a little (after the Water raised up was fallen) the Figure of the Sloop was gone, her Stern, and a Piece of the Deck, driving away; the Off-side of her was broke from the Bottom, and the Mast was down, which, however, the Rigging kept fast to the Inner-side, which, as yet, was not parted from the Bottom.</P>
<P>The Natives who were on the Top of the Rocks, saw the Sloop come on the Ledge of the Rocks, and likewise beheld us take to the Water, but could not see whether we got ashore or not; whereupon they made all the Haste down that they could, to see what was become of us; and about Two Hours, or more, after we got ashore, came to us to the Number of Five or Six, and were very glad we were all got safe to the Shore, and seemed to take Abundance of Notice of the Boy, seeing him so young and little, and pitied him very much.</P>
<P>The Blacks who had been with me in the Sloop, asked the others, Why they had not brought them down something to eat?</P>
<P>They told them, That as soon as they saw the Sea wash over the Sloop, and us take to the Water, they made the best of their Way down to assist, if there was Occasion, to get the Captain of the Sloop, and his Child, ashore, because they knew that white People were not so hardy, nor used to the Water like the Blacks; and that there were a great many People coming (that could not clamber down the Rocks so well as they) who, they believed, had something with them to eat.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in about Half an Hour, came another Parcel of them down, and cursed the Way, saying, They would not have ventured to come down, if they had known it had been so bad; and soon after, came another Parcel, who brought
<PB N="178" REF="185"/>
with them some Pompions, and some Milk in a Calabash, and asked, Whether we could not make a Fire? they said, They had nothing to strike a Fire with, neither had they any Fewel to make it with; one said, He had Steel, Tinder, and Cot∣ton, and some of the others asked me, If the Wood of the Wreck would not burn? I told them yes, very well; at which, an elderly Man bid some of the young Men swim off, and bring some of the smallest and lightest Pieces of Boards which were swimming about in the Water, which they did, the Weather being something abated, and the Sun beginning to shine; notwithstanding which, I shook with Cold, as also did my wet Companions.</P>
<P>But when the Wood was brought ashore, we had no convenient Place to kindle a Fire there, the Beach being wet; and though the Water, by this Time, was low, yet, some of them said, when the Sea filled again, it would overflow all the Beach up to the Rocks; others said not: However they hunted about, and at last found a Place in the Rock, that was about Sixteen or Eighteen Foot above the Flowing of the Sea, and about Seven or Eight Foot broad, with the Rock over-hanging: There they concluded to make the Fire, and said, That we that were cold and wet, would have Room enough to sit down and warm ourselves, and for the rest, they might do well enough without; and asked, Whe∣ther we could not boil some Pompion, to have something hot to warm us within?</P>
<P>I told them, there were Two Pots in the Sloop, but I believed they could not be got now the Sloop was broke, though they were left on the Deck, which was whole, and fastened to that Part of the Sloop that stuck on the Rock; but
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
that it was probable the Sea had washed them off, and that they were sunk to the Bottom.</P>
<P>They said, That signified nothing; and that as soon as it was moderate Weather, which, they hoped, would be towards the Evening, some of the young Men should swim off and get them, if the Sea had not carried them too far, or drove them under the Hollow of the Rocks, be∣yond their Discovery. Nor did they fear, they said, getting them, or any thing else that would sink, and not drive away too far.</P>
<P>They then made me and the Boy drink some of the Milk they had brought in the Calabash; and seeing my Feather-bed swimming about on the Sea, Two of them swam off, and saved it, and laid it upon the Rock to dry.</P>
<P>After this, some of the Blacks went in quest of Wood to make a Fire with, and some Grass, &amp;c. to sleep on; while others staid with us below all Night, which we passed as well as we could, it proving moderate Weather, clear, and Starlight.</P>
<P>The next Day also proved fine Weather, and the Sun rising clear and pleasant, and it growing warm, some of my Companions swam off to seek for what they could find, the Bottom of the Wreck still lying on the Ledge of Rocks, and the Mast, and some of the Rigging being entangled there.</P>
<P>They brought some small Pieces of small Ropes ashore, and all the Bits and Pieces of Boards on which they found any Paint, esteeming them the richest Stuff of all, and told me, there were the Sails fast to the Mast, and asked me, Whether they should save them? I told them, If they could, I should be very glad, and bid them save that, or any thing else that could be saved; at which they swam off again, a Dozen or Fourteen of them, and disentangled the Mast, Sails, and
<PB N="180" REF="187"/>
Ropes, from the Wreck, casting off, or cutting with their Knives, where it was fast, and brought the Mast, Boom, and Boltsprit, all entangled and fast together, to the Shore, and we haled them as far on as we could; and what Ropes we could get, we laid up as secure as possible in the Clefts and Hollows of the Rocks. The Main-Sail was also washed to Lint, in a manner, there not being a Piece to be found of it good for any thing; and the Fore-sail was not in much better Condition; for being so rotten, the Sea had washed them almost away, excepting a few good-for-nothing Jags which hung to the Bolt Ropes. The Jibb was pretty much torn, but being a sound, as well as strong Sail, there was a pretty deal of that fit to serve for several Uses, as indeed it afterwards did.</P>
<P>The Blacks said, If we could any way fasten and secure the Mast, Boom, Boltsprit, &amp;c. till they could have a calm Day, they could tow them up to the Harbour called the <HI>Ovens,</HI> and it might be, they might be serviceable to me one Way or another.</P>
<P>I told them, they would, and if any Ship hap∣pened to put in there, that should want them, I could sell them for something, which should be for their Benefit, to help make them Amends for this their Kindness to me, and the great Trouble they had been at to serve me.</P>
<P>They said, They were glad they had been of Service to me, and thought it their Duty to serve any Stranger that was in Distress, as I was, notwithstanding they were of different Colours, and by us, they believed, accounted different Creatures: Yet they thought we were all of one Species, and they were all Men, as we were, tho' they allowed themselves to be much inferior to us in every thing.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="188"/>
I told them, As for that, I did not see any Difference, only in the Colour, which I did not know whether it was in their Nature, or whether it might be occasioned by the excessive Heat of the Sun, and could not tell but that if a white Man and Woman were to come and live with them, and go naked, and be exposed to the scorching Sun as they were, in Three or Four Generations, they might be changed to their Complexion.</P>
<P>They said, No; for they had heard, that not∣withstanding their Skin might lose its Whiteness, and change to a reddish or brown Colour, yet their Hair would always hold its Nature, and not be frisled like theirs, which they took to be an infallible Sign to know a Stranger, let his Colour be what it would, from one of them. They said moreover, That there was a Curse laid on them, that they should always be Subjects and Servants to the Whites.</P>
<P>I told them, I had heard something of it (being willing to continue them in their Esteem of us.)</P>
<P>They said, They were convinced that I knew it, and believed, there was no White but knew that the Blacks were by God destined to be their Servants, which was plainly manifest by the white Men coming, as they have been told, every Year to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and carrying away a great many Thousands to be their Slaves; and if they had not been by the Whites <HI>(i. e. Portuguese)</HI> brought away from <HI>Guinea,</HI> and, as it were, privi∣leged, or rather a Freedom indulged to them, as well by the <HI>Brancas</HI> who brought them first hither, as also by all other Strangers, to whose Power they lie open, they might carry them away, and make Slaves of them, as well as those of their first native Country, whenever they pleased.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="189"/>
They said, They did not know whether it were a Favour voluntarily given to them by all Na∣tions, or procured for them by the <HI>Brancas,</HI> who first placed them there; but in Gratitude, they thought themselves obligated to do all the Good they could to Strangers, and to assist them in what∣soever they were able, and in a more especial Manner <HI>Englishmen,</HI> who were always accounted the best Friends to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and one of whose Kings, they had been told, had married the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Daughter. This I con∣firmed to them; and they professed abundance of Love, Value, and Respect to <HI>Englishmen,</HI> whom, they said, they esteemed as much as they did the <HI>Portuguese:</HI> Which pleased me very well, hoping to have friendly Neighbours of them.</P>
<P>They continued, one or other of them, swim∣ing about the Wreck all Day, bringing Pieces of Boards, especially those that had any Paint on them; and filled all the Clefts of the Rocks adja∣cent, with Pieces of Wood, Boards, &amp;c. and found both the Iron Pots, and brought them ashore; also an Iron Crow, a Pair of Stilliards, the Gun that the Pirates had given me, though the Stock was broke, also a small Cooper's Adz, which I had found one Day ashore on the Beach at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and several other Things; all which they put up in the Clefts, &amp;c. of the Rocks, high enough out of the Reach of the Sea.</P>
<P>They all seemed overjoyed that the Pots were found, and said, That now I might dress my Victuals my own Way (as though I could dress it a Jot the more my Way▪ in the Iron Pot, than I could in one of their Earthen Pots). They found several other Things, as the Cook's Tormenters, a Pair of Brass Compasses, and a Pair of Brass Dividers, a Tin Kettle and Sawcepan,
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
a Chissel, a caulking Iron, and several other trifling Things.</P>
<P>The Manner of their finding them was thus; Several Places about the Wreck, to and from the Water, were so shallow, that they could stand up∣on the Tops of the sunken Rocks with the Wa∣ter up to their Breasts, their Navels, and in some Places not so high, and the Sea being pretty smooth, as it always is here in fine Weather (this little Bay of <HI>Punta de Sal,</HI> lying on the Lee-side of the Island) they could look all round about them on the Bottom, which they could see very plain, in four, five, or six Fathom Water, especially where the Bottom is Stony or Rocky, and I my self have seen little Shells, &amp;c. from a Rock down to the Bottom, in six, seven, and even in ten, or twelve Fathom Water: And 'tis a common Practice with the Blacks, for their Diversion, when they have done fishing, to stand on the Rocks and heave Stones into the Water, and for others to dive and bring them up, at which Exercise they are very expert, and account it no Piece of Dexteri∣ty to dive to the Bottom in four or five Fathom, and when there, to search and creep along for a Minute, or better.</P>
<P>We put on one of the Pots with some Pompion, and some of those who went in the Morning to Fish, came back about Noon with a good Mess, which we boiled with the Pompion, and made a hearty Meal.</P>
<P>The Place of the Bay where we came ashore, was the worst Place that we could possibly land at; for they were forced to swim from thence to the Fishing-places, and also for Water; though at low Water, a Man might have made shift to crawl along the Rocks to where the Water was, which came out of a Rock stilling down into a hollow Place like a Cistern; but that way was so trouble∣some,
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
as well as dangerous, by Reason of the Rocks and Stones tumbling very frequently down from the Mountains overhead; that they chose rather to swim always for the Water, than to go that way for it.</P>
<P>About one or two o'Clock, the Governor sent a Man down to me, to tell me he was very sorry for my Misfortune, and gave his Service to me, and desired, that when I came up to Town, I would make use of his House as my own, and that I should not want for any Thing which their poor Island afforded while I remained on it: and withal, sent me down some Pompion and three or four Po∣tatoes; declaring, That his Illness had prevented his coming down to me, and hoped I would not take it amiss; and also, that he had sent some Men out that Morning to hunt for some wild Goats; but they were not returned, the Messenger said, when he came from Home; but if they came time enough, he would send me some that Night; if not, I should have some Venison on the Mor∣row, without fail.</P>
<P>I told him, I was obliged to the <HI>Signor Gover∣nador,</HI> and thanked him; and a little while after, came a Black from the Priest, with the same Com∣pliment from him; but brought nothing to eat as the Governor's Black did, and told me, that his Master desired to know, Whether I had saved any Flower, and if I had, he requested me to send him some by him; and that if I had saved any <HI>Aqua Ardenta</HI> also, his Master would be no less glad of it, though he had not bid him ask for any.</P>
<P>I told him, we had very little of either on Board; but our Distress was so great, that if there had been never so great a Quantity, we should not have been able to save any, when the Sloop run on that Ledge of Rocks; Adding, That all we had been able to save from the Wreck, was
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
the Pieces of Board, &amp;c. which he saw about us, and those Iron Pots.</P>
<P>He said, his Master was more able to do me Service, than even the Governor himself; and he believed, if I presented him one of those Pots, it would be very acceptable; and that it would be nothing in Comparison to the Benefit he was capable of doing me in Return.</P>
<P>I told him, That I was sorry I had nothing to oblige his Master with, worthy his Acceptance; but should be proud he would receive from me any Thing that had been left me by my hard For∣tune.</P>
<P>About four in the Afternoon, he and the Go∣vernor's Black went away; I bid them present my humble Service to their Masters, hoping I should have the Happiness of always continuing in their Favour and Esteem, and it should be my constant Study and Endeavour to deserve it.</P>
<P>They said, I need not doubt it; for their Ma∣sters profess'd abundance of Concern for my Mis∣fortune, as well as a great Affection for my Per∣son, though unknown to them by Sight; and they both had heard their Masters say, that I should want for nothing that the Island afforded, while I remained on it; so away they went.</P>
<P>Some time after, among other Blacks that came down, came one called, <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> who was Son to <HI>Antonio Gumms,</HI> who had formerly been Governor of the Island; who, together with his Brother, brought down some Pompions, Ba∣nana's, a Pappai, and a Cake of Bread, made of Banana's and Maiz, which was the first Bread I had eat or seen, since I came among them: <HI>Domingo</HI> told me, that his Father sent me the Pompion and Fruit, and his Mother the Cake, and if I lik'd it, she would make me some more, and send me; and likewise desired to know if I lov'd
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
Milk; and if I did, I should have some sent down.</P>
<P>I thanked them very kindly, and told them, that Milk was what I often used to eat in my own Country; and tasting the Bread, at his Desire, told him I lik'd it very well; and he said, he was glad of it, and assured me, that I should have more.</P>
<P>I thanked him, and told them, I gave them all abundance of Trouble, and had received many Favours from them, but was not in a Capacity of making any suitable Returns, otherways, than by a grateful Acknowledgment of their Kindnesses at present; and a Resolution, that if ever God Al∣mighty should be pleased to make me able here∣after, I would make them, as far as in me lay, a grateful Satisfaction.</P>
<P>They said, They did not desire any Thing in Return, but to continue in my good Esteem, and to let my Country-men know, how kindly I had been used among them; and that no other Re∣turn would be required by them, or any of the Islanders, unless the Priest, who they heard was always very craving, as well from Strangers, as also from the Natives; and therefore, he thought it was convenient to give me this Caution, for fear he might be begging any Thing of me ac∣cording to his usual Wont.</P>
<P>I told him, I had nothing in the World left me here, that would be worth any Body's asking, or my giving.</P>
<P>He said, that if I had never so much, he was sure no Body would desire any Thing from me, but would rather give me, if they had any Thing that would be of Service to me, and that the utmost of what they desired, was, as he had told me before, to be Noted, and to be had in Esteem by Strangers; and were sorry that their Island af∣forded
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
nothing worth the Stranger's while to come and traffick for.</P>
<P>I told them, That I believed, when it pleased God, that I return'd to my Country, and gave them an Account of their Civility to Strangers, I did not doubt, but some of our Shipping would come and visit them.</P>
<P>He said, If their Island had any Production that was worth their while to come and traffick for, it might be so; but that, as far as he could learn, by what he heard from his Father and other old Men, who could remember the coming of se∣veral Strangers to it, most of whom were of that Nation which had robbed me, <HI>(viz. Pirates,</HI> for they thought it was a particular Nation so called) who, though they used me so hardly, he said, were very civil to them, making large Requitals for every little Favour they were able to shew them; and who would often tell them, that their Island was very poor, and that they lived exceeding mise∣rable, in Comparison of what the white Men did, in their own Country; and that their not having any Production that was good for any Thing, was the Reason so few Ships came to visit them.</P>
<P>I told him, It was very true, that our Ships sel∣dom or never came there, because it was not known to us, that they had any Commodities worth trafficking for; but that, perhaps, their Island might yield valuable Commodities, but they and we both, might be ignorant of them, or what might be produced in them by Art.</P>
<P>I then instanced how ignorant the <HI>Portuguese</HI> were of the rich Productions of <HI>Guinea,</HI> at their first Discovery of that Coast, and how little the Inhabitants thereof regarded those rich Commo∣dities, which it almost every where afforded, by reason they knew not the Value of them, nor the manifold Uses to which they contributed, both for
<PB N="188" REF="195"/>
Pleasure and Profit to Mankind; and that in those Times, the Blacks set a very inconsiderable Value on Gold, and Ambergrease, and less on Teeth, Wax, &amp;c. and that they were intirely ignorant of any other Use for their Woods, which now were a considerable Part of the Trade, but for Firing.</P>
<P>All the Time that was I was talking thus, I ob∣served, that one Man of the Company, listen'd, with more than ordinary Attention, to our Dis∣course; and ey'd me constantly, whose Com∣plexion was very different from any of those I had yet seen; for all the rest were black, and had Coal-black frizled Hair, unless chang'd by Age to Grey, like the Blacks on the Coast of the main Continent of <HI>Guinea,</HI> but he was of a ruddy, copper, or tawny Colour, something resembling the <HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Arabs</HI> on the Southermost Parts of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and had strait, tho' short Hair, and of a light brown Colour.</P>
<P>This Man, as soon as I had finish'd my Talk, to my exceeding Surprize, as well as Joy, an∣swer'd me in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, That what I had said was very true, and that there were many rich Commodities, to his Knowledge, produced in the Nothermost Part of <HI>Guinea,</HI> which as well the <HI>English</HI> as the Natives were utterly ignorant of; they of their Use and Value, and we of their being produced in that Part; and therefore, what might be as plentiful and as easy got, and perhaps cost less there, is sought for in other more distant Places, with greater Difficulty, Danger, and Charge, as he experimently knew, having been an Inhabitant in those Parts some considerable Time, occasion'd by Misfortunes, as I might now be here; by which Means he had an Opportunity to observe the Commodities produced in the inland Places of that Part of the Continent.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="196"/>
Upon my asking him, What Country-man he was? he told me, <Q>“”He was a <HI>Welshman</HI> born, and had been Master of several Ships out of <HI>Bristol:</HI> That he had been taken by <HI>Bartholomew Ro∣berts,</HI> as he was going to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and by him was detain'd, and brought on the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> from whom he there made his Escape, and having formerly traded to those Parts, as well as to most Parts of <HI>Guinea,</HI> he was acquaint∣ed with almost all the Coast along: That it was at <HI>Seirra Leon</HI> that he had made his Escape, from Captain <HI>Roberts</HI> the Pirate, and got to a Black King up the River, whom he formerly in his Trading had been acquainted with, who en∣tertained him very courteously, and promised him his Protection and Assistance, against all that should oppose or offer to molest him:</Q></P>
<Q>“That altho' <HI>Roberts</HI> used all his Endeavours to get him again, thro' the Interest of those Blacks whom he had won by his Presents, by whom he had offered to the said King several Presents, of considerable Value, as the said Black King told him, yet the King would not except any, but sent <HI>Roberts</HI> Word by the said Blacks, that he was not of so base a Principle, as to be∣tray any distressed Person who had fled to him for Succour, especially to such cruel Enemies to all manner of honest Trade and Traffick, as he understood they were; and withal, gave him to understand, that he neither stood in want of his Money, Cloaths, Arms, or Ammunition, having enough of every Sort, and a thousand stout Men, that understood how to use Arms, as well as his Men did, for all they were black; and who were always ready to receive him, if he dar'd presume to come within his Territories, to offer the least Incivility; and that if a thou∣sand would not be sufficient to make him sensi∣ble
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
of his Folly, he would give him the Di∣version of being entertained with double, treble, or quadruple the Number.”</Q>
<Q>“That this answer so daunted <HI>Roberts,</HI> that he strove no more about it, but endeavoured to supply himself with Water, Wood, and what other Refreshments he could get; and having ob∣tained them, he sailed from thence, and prose∣cuted his intended Voyage of cruising down along the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> as far as St. <HI>Thoma,</HI> or <HI>Princes</HI> Island.”</Q>
<P><HI>I asked him his Name? He said,</HI> <Q>“It was <HI>Charles Franklin,</HI> and that he was born within two Miles of <HI>Carleon,</HI> upon <HI>Usk,</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> and that his Father was a Justice of Peace, <HI>&amp;c.”</HI></Q></P>
<P>I asked him, How he came here in this bye and unfrequented Island? He said, <HI>He would inform me of the whole, if I would please to hear him;</HI> which, I told him, I would very gladly: Where∣upon he proceeded and said;</P>
<Q>“That after Captain <HI>Roberts,</HI> the Pirate, was sailed, he took the Liberty to range about in the Country, to see and observe what was curi∣ous or remarkable, either in the Manners, Cu∣stoms, and Constitutions of the People, or in the Productions of the Country, and, by one Means or other, Captain <HI>Plunket,</HI> who was Go∣vernor of the <HI>English</HI> Factory, heard, there was a Man who had belonged to <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Com∣pany left behind, and entertained by King <HI>Thome,</HI> to whom he sent to deliver him up to him, to punish him according to Justice, and the Custom of the <HI>English</HI> Nation.”</Q>
<Q>“That as soon as the King received this Mes∣sage he sent for him, (i. e. <HI>Franklin)</HI> to whom he communicated it, declaring, That he was loth to disoblige Governor <HI>Plunket,</HI> because he might thereby disoblige all the <HI>English</HI> Nation;
<PB N="191" REF="198"/>
but withal told him, That if he thought the <HI>English</HI> Governor would do him any harm, he would by no Means deliver him up; but bid him consider and advise him what Answer to send, assuring him, that let his Case be how it would, he was resolved to protect him, but withal thought it best, if he was guilty of any Action which would render him obnoxious to Danger, to acquaint him with it, that he might take the best Measures, both to secure him from any harm, and to give the Governor as little Dissatisfaction as might be.”</Q>
<P><Q>“”That he told the King, that he never had been guilty of any ill Action that might make him liable to Punishment; but, perhaps, the Governor might suppose he had been one of Captain <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Company, and left behind by chance, and therefore might think he deserved to be punished as such; but he could assure him he was not, but was forced and kept a Prisoner on board of them, till he made his Escape; but yet told the King, he did not care to be put into the Hands of the <HI>English</HI> Factory, being a Stranger to Governor <HI>Plunket,</HI> as well as to the rest of the Gentlemen of the Factory, who per∣haps might conceit him to be one of the Pirates Company, and disbelieve what he said, and therefore, though undeservedly, punish him, as though he had been actually or willingly a Pi∣rate; for which Reason, if his Majesty pleased, he would rather still continue to be under his Protection, till some Ship came thither to trade, the Captain or Company of which might know his Character or Family, of which he was very certain few Ships that came from <HI>England</HI> to these Parts to trade, but what the Commanders, or some Body belonging to them, must be ac∣quainted with him.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="192" REF="199"/>
<HI>“That the King upon this gave him his Word, and swore by his Darling God, he should not, be delivered into the Power of any Body, but by his own choice; and accordingly sent Word to Governor</HI> Plunket, That the White, un∣der his Protection, was not of the Pirates Com∣pany, but by Compulsion, having been taken by Force, and detained a Prisoner, and escaped from them, when they arrived there, and in order to avoid being taken by them again, had thrown himself upon his Protection, not being acquainted that there was an <HI>English</HI> Factory there, which if he had known, without Doubt, he would have apply'd to for Protection: That upon these Con∣siderations, he could do no less than succour and defend him, as a Stranger in Distress; which he had the rather done, as he was one of the Go∣vernor's Countrymen, between whom and him there had always been a good Understanding.”</Q>
<Q><HI>“That the King also acquainted the Governor,</HI> that he <HI>(Franklin)</HI> had a Mind to continue with him, to inform himself of the Custom and Trade of his Country: That he approved his Deportment and Conversation, and therefore gave him Leave to do so; but that, if he thought fit to go to the Governor, or the Governor would send to his Town, to inform himself farther concerning him, they were equally at Liberty to do so; disclaiming all Thoughts of keeping <HI>Franklin</HI> against his Will, or in Breach of the Friendship which had always subsisted between himself and the <HI>English</HI> Fa∣ctory.”</Q>
<P><Q>“”That hereupon Governor <HI>Plunket</HI> sent up a white Servant of his, with two Blacks, to inquire into the Matter, and to know <HI>Franklin</HI>'s Name; which as soon as they had been inform'd of, they returned. The Governor taking him for one of that Name who was a notorious Pirate, he
<PB N="193" REF="200"/>
sent Word again to the King, <HI>That he was cer∣tainly one of the Pirates, and not what he repre∣sented himself to be, and therefore desired that the King would deliver him into his Hands; by which Means he would not only manifest himself to be a Friend to the whole</HI> English <HI>Nation, but to the honest Traders of all Nations.</HI></Q></P>
<Q>“That hereupon the King sent for him again, and acquainted him with the Message, and told him, that he was very unwilling to give the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Factory of <HI>Sierra Leon</HI> any Distaste; but was still firm in his Resolution, not to put him into their Hands, if he thought it would be any ways prejudicial to him, or if it was contrary to his Inclination; and, therefore, desired him to order it so, that the <HI>English</HI> might not be dis∣obliged on one Hand, nor his Safety endanger'd on the other.”</Q>
<P><HI>Franklin</HI> then continued to tell us, <Q>“That hav∣ing acknowledged the King's Goodness to him, he desir'd to be sent farther into the Country, to some neighbouring King of his Acquain∣tance, out of Governor <HI>Plunket</HI>'s Knowledge, and consequently out of his Reach or Influence.”</Q></P>
<P><HI>Upon which I interrupted him, and said,</HI> I do not see what Danger or Hazard you could be in, by being in Governor <HI>Plunket</HI>'s Hands; but rather I should think it would have been the best Method you could have taken; for they would not have hurt you, if your Case had been as you say.</P>
<P>He reply'd, <Q>“It was very true; neither was he afraid that they could do him any harm, but that there was one of his Name, who had been a Pirate, and a very noted one too; and asked me, If I never had seen the Name of <HI>Charles Franklin,</HI> notified in the <HI>London Gazette?”</HI></Q> I told him, I could not then call to Mind that I had. He said, <Q>“It was possible I might forget
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
to have seen it; but he had read it several Times, and his Name being the same, he did not care to run himself into the Danger of a long Confinement, and to be obliged to take his Tryal as a Criminal, being descended of an ancient and worshipful Family, none of whom were ever tainted with the least Imputation of Guilt either to their King or Country; tho' it was morally impossible but he should be ac∣quitted of Pyracy, upon a fair Tryal: Besides, he said, he had another Reason to induce him to be sent up the Country, which was a Curiosi∣ty natural to his Temper, to search and disco∣ver unknown Places; and being sensible that this Coast of <HI>Africa</HI> in general abounded with Gold, beyond any Continent in the World, and having also learnt from his Conversation with the Natives, that the Parts far within Land abounded with Gold, and from whence what of that Metal they had, proceeded, it made him desirous to see into it, now that so plausible an Occasion offered, which, perhaps, no <HI>European</HI> ever had before: And this Enquiry, he said, was the more pleasing to him, because having served an Apprenticeship in <HI>Bristol,</HI> to the Goldsmith's Trade, and wrought at it in several Places, he had attained to a tolerable Knowledge of the Nature of Me∣tals and Minerals, and had endeavoured as much as he could, to inform himself in some of the greatest Mysteries of fusing as well as separating Metals from Minerals, as well as one Metal from another; and that in his trading on the Coast of <HI>Guiney,</HI> he had made the nicest Experiments on the mineral Earths, Stones, Sands, &amp;c. and had collected, with the greatest Exactness he was capable of, the Value and Quantity of Metal contained in them, which
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>
Experiments and Observations he had taken down Memorandums in Writing of.”</Q></P>
<P>I told him, I hoped to have a farther and bet∣ter Opportunity to renew our Discourse on this Subject; but wish'd at present he would give me some Account of the Production of this Island, and of the Temper of the Inhabitants; that I might, since it was my Lot to be cast among them, so comport myself, as to win their Favour, and avoid any Occasion of disgusting them. He said, It was the greatest Happiness he could have hoped for to have a Countryman to converse with; and would very readily comply with that, and every other Request I should make him, which he was able to satisfy. <Q>“As for this Island, he said, I might easily, at first Sight, discover, that it was exceeding barren, being nothing but one conti∣nu'd Rock, as it were, and only here and there in the Clefts and Vallies, cover'd over with a thin Crust of Earth, which produc'd nothing that would be thought fit Aliment for the hu∣man Species by an <HI>European,</HI> who had never been used to these barren rocky Mountains: That, however, <HI>Banana's</HI> grew pretty well in some of the Vallies, but were nothing near so large as on the Continent: That in several Places at the Foot of the Mountains, where there is any Earth, Pompions and Potatoes grow pretty well; that they had likewise a large Quantity of Feshoons, and wild Figs, which were generally eaten by the Natives for Food; as also a pretty many Papai's; and that those who would take the Pains to plant it, had Maiz enough; but that the Natives were generally so slothful and lazy, that in a great measure it was the Cause of their Poverty: That there was Store of very good Fish about the Island; and that there had been considerable Numbers of good
<PB N="196" REF="203"/>
wild Goats; but that most of them had been destroy'd: That some of the Inhabitants had Cows, Horses, Asses, and Hogs, of which last Sort they had the most Plenty; but seldom made use of any of them, except at their publick Feasts.”</Q></P>
<P>I ask'd him, How they caught their Fish? He told me, <Q>“That some of them had Fish-hooks left yet, which they had got when Ships had been there, and others had preserved Nails, Pieces of Iron, Wire, and the like, which they were very eager to procure at all Opportunities, and very chary of when procured: That there was an old Man on the Island, a Native of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> who had a Hammer and three or four Files, who made Charcoal out of the Wood of the wild Fig-Tree, by Help of which, he made shift to bungle up a Hook out of an old Nail, for doing of which, he had another Nail; and the Party for whom he made the Hook, was always oblig'd, as often as he got a Mess of Fish, to make him a Present of some; so that, said he, the old <HI>Farrier,</HI> as they call him, sel∣dom wants Fish, and often supplies his Neigh∣bours with some, when they stand in Need thereof.”</Q> <Q>He added, “That the Fish about this Island were so voracious, that a bended Nail would take them; so that there was no fear of catching Fish enough.”</Q></P>
<P>I said, I was glad there was no Apprehension of starving; and that I could save so many Nails out of the Pieces of the Wreck which the Blacks brought ashore, that I should not grudge to give the old Farrier three or four of them for fixing me one, or for lending me his Hammer and Files to make them myself; for I had made a great many Fishing-Hooks in my Time with a File▪ He said, It would be an easy Matter for me to
<PB N="197" REF="204"/>
exceed the Black; for he himself made all the Hooks that he fished with, and likewise for the Family that he lived among; and that every Body knew them from those made by the old Man, and preferr'd them to his: But, said he, you will have no Occasion to go a Fishing; for I will engage, they will supply you with Fish, or any Thing else which the Island affords, without your seeking for it.</P>
<P>He added, That they would have been equally civil to him; but that he chose to fish for himself, to divert his melancholy Hours; and that it was principally to this Diversion, and Hunting, that he ow'd the Preservation of his Life, or at least his Senses, in his great Misfortunes. But that, as for Hunting, I should find very little Pleasure in it, and that it would be even impracticable for me, till my Feet were harden'd, as his were, be∣cause of the clambering up the broken and rotten Rocks, which were equally difficult and dange∣rous.</P>
<P>I ask'd him, How long he had been on this Island? He said, Something above three Years; but he had been on the Island of St. <HI>Philip</HI> some time before he came hither; and when I was disposed to hear it, he would continue the Rela∣tion of his Misfortunes to the Time of his coming upon this Island.</P>
<P>I said, I should be very much oblig'd to him for the Favour of such a Relation; and took No∣tice, that the two Blacks who came down in Com∣pany with him, seem'd, as I thought, by the ex∣traordinary Attention which they paid to our Dis∣course, to understand what we said. He said, No, they were ignorant of every Word we said, excepting two, which he had taught them, to wit, <HI>Ay</HI> and <HI>No.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="205"/>
However, turning to <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> I ask'd him, How he did? and whether he understood our Language? He said, No; he wish'd he did; and that he would give any Thing in his Power to be Master of it; but that he was glad we could un∣derstand one another.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Franklin</HI> told them, That I was his Countryman; which seem'd to surprize <HI>Domingo,</HI> who said, he thought him to be a <HI>Gaulego,</HI> (i. e. a <HI>Welshman)</HI> and that I was an <HI>Englishman.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, That the Place where Signior <HI>Ca∣rolos</HI> (which they pronounce <HI>Singore,</HI> and was the Name that he went by among the Natives) was born, was a Part of <HI>England,</HI> call'd <HI>Gualego,</HI> as the Bay we were then in was call'd the <HI>Bay of the Salt Point,</HI> and yet still was a Part of the Island of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>It soon past about among all the Blacks there present, that Singore <HI>Carolos</HI> was an <HI>Englishman;</HI> and they all severally ask'd me, Whether it was so or no? it being their Manner always to trace any Relation to the Source or Fountain-head, before they will give Credit to it, and not take any Hear∣say Account, if they can get any other.</P>
<P>I satisfy'd their Curiosity; and ask'd <HI>Franklin</HI> What Sort of a Way it was up to their Town? He said, It was so bad, that I should never be able to get up it; and the more dangerous, be∣cause the Stones and Rocks were so loose and rot∣ten, that a Man could not be secure, either in what he rested on with his Feet, or any Hold he could take with his Hands.</P>
<P>I ask'd him, How so many of them came down, if the Way was so hazardous? He said, It was hazardous enough for them; and he heard seve∣ral of them complain of the Dangerousness of the Way, and say, If they had known it had been so perilous, they would not have ventur'd to come
<PB N="199" REF="206"/>
down; for, said he, it is to be question'd, whe∣ther there be one Person living on the Island, that ever has been down to this Place before now; and it is probable, if it had not been on this Occa∣sion, there might never any of them have come here, where we are now. It's true, said he, they often come down to that black Point that you came round before you anchor'd, to gather Salt for their necessary Occasions, from whence, I be∣lieve, it took the Name of the <HI>Salt Point;</HI> but then the Rocks where they come down to that, are sound and firm, and though very steep, yet not so steep, by a great deal, as the Way that comes down here.</P>
<P>I objected, That I thought I was as able to get up, as several ancient Men that I saw, and as he himself, who was more corpulent than I: But he said, That Use was a great Matter in that Case; and he had been on this Island, and St. <HI>Philips</HI> (which was as bad or worse) nigh six Years, and yet, for all that, there were several of the Natives, who were very ancient, as well as corpulent, and seemingly decrepid through Age, in Comparison of him, yet could climb up Rocks without either Fear or Apprehension of Danger, which he nei∣ther could, nor dared to attempt; and besides, he was forced, he said, to swim near half a Mile, or he should not have been able to have come hither to me.</P>
<P>How must I do then, said I, if I can proceed no farther, and yet at high Water have not here so much Room to stand, or walk upon, as half a Ship's Quarter-Deck? I shall be worse than a Person pent up in a solitary close Prison all his Days.</P>
<P>He said, He would ask the Blacks; who were most of them standing round about us, listning as attentively to what we had been discoursing all
<PB N="200" REF="207"/>
this Time, as though they had understood every Word we had said. He accordingly ask'd them their Opinions, who confirm'd all he said as to the Difficulty; Especially; as they said, that they sup∣pos'd I could not go without Shoes among such sharp-pointed ragged Rocks, as I should meet with in the Way. I told them, That was very true; but I suppos'd, that when once a Man had climbed up to the Top of the Rocks, the Way was something better, and more level.</P>
<P>They said it was; but that it was a great Way to get to the Top; and ask'd me, Whether I took as far as I could see to be the Top. I told them, Yea. They said, That which I saw now, and took to be the Top of the Rocks, was not the hundredth Part of that Height that I must climb to, before I could come to the Top; For, said one, for my Part, I can hardly tell which is the Top. An∣other said, The Middle of the Island is the Top; for the Rocks and Ground rose continually till one came to the Middle of the Island. <HI>Franklin</HI> hereupon propos'd to them to give me a more in∣telligible Account of the difficult Situation of the Island: This disgusted the Blacks, who thought he pretended to know the Country better than they; and one of them resented it accordingly, raising his Voice, and contracting his Brow, and wonder'd he should pretend to give a better Ac∣count than they could do, who were used to tra∣vel to such unfrequented Paths on Account of Fishing, which he dared not attempt to go in, were he to starve for want of Food. He ex∣cus'd himself very submissively, professing he did not mean it so, and that he could not pretend to know the Island near so well as they; and that all he could mean was, That being able to dis∣course me in my own Language, he was the more capable to make me understand what he said:
<PB N="201" REF="208"/>
And he hoped they would not be offended, at the Liberty he took to discourse me in my own Tongue.</P>
<P>They seeing me a little surpriz'd and concern'd at their Resentment, soften'd their Tone, and told him, They were heartily glad he could talk with and divert the Captain, and that they would have him talk with me in that Language that pleased him best; but as I could very well talk their Language, they should rather we would, because they should then have the Advantage of hearing some Things, which they never knew or heard of before; but however, they desir'd I would please myself, and they would dispense with their own Satisfaction, for the Sake of add∣ing to mine.</P>
<P>I told them, I was much oblig'd to them; but finding <HI>Franklin</HI> was of my own Opinion, that he had half anger'd them, which he said was owing to the Jealousy they had, that he should stand better in my Graces than they; I told him, We should have, I doubted, but too many Op∣portunities to discourse together, and so would forbear at present to say any Thing more which might augment their Suspicions.</P>
<P>By this Time, Night approaching, some of the Men thought it best to go seek for a Place more convenient to take up their Abode, before it was too late: But <HI>Domingo</HI> and <HI>Franklin,</HI> and two or three more, staid with me. Some of them, as they were going away, ask'd <HI>Franklin</HI> to go with them; for that they should fare much better than they could below, as hardly having there Room to lie clear of the Sea, nor any Shelter from the Wind. <HI>Franklin</HI> seem'd inclinable to go; but upon <HI>Domingo</HI>'s telling them, That he thought <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> had more good Manners in him, as well as good Nature, than to leave

his Countryman the first Night; he told them, That he could not well leave the Captain to Night, and bid them that went, not to forget to go and catch a Dish of Fish, and bring it to me in the Morning for my Breakfast. They said, That enow of them would stay till the Morning to catch a Dish of Fish. I thank'd them, and ask'd them, How far up the Rocks they design'd to go? They told me, They should not go very high that Night; but they had a long Way to swim from the Point, over the other Bay, (pointing towards the Westward) to the Point call'd <HI>Pis∣carree Pickyeana,</HI> and then a little ways up.</P>
<P>I told them, I thought it would be cold swim∣ing now in the Evening. They said, <HI>No Force,</HI> (which is a very common Word with these Peo∣ple, as well as among the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> from whom probably they learn'd it) and that after they had swam cross the Bay, they had then but a little Way to go, before they came at a <HI>Fuurno,</HI> or Cave, large enough to shelter a hundred Persons or more from Rain or Wind; and there was always Wood enough there, or thereabouts, which the People brought down with them, every Time they came there to fish; and that if it was not late, they could catch a Dish for their Suppers, and would send me some too for mine.</P>
<P>I thank'd them, and told them, I wish'd I was there.</P>
<P>They said, They wish'd so too, and then they believ'd I could make shift to get up to Town; though even then I should find it troublesome enough.</P>
<P>I told them, I should not mind the Trouble, so it was but possible; But, said I, how must I con∣trive to get there.</P>
<P>One said, They would contrive, when the Weather was fine, to carry me over the Bay.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="210"/>
Another said, There was no Occasion for run∣ning that Risque, when the first fine Day, they could bring down <HI>Antonia Riverio</HI>'s Boat, and carry me and all my Cloaths, and other Goods, up to the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> from whence I might easily get to Town, because the Governor to be sure would send a Horse for me to ride up upon.</P>
<P>Another said, I needed not to fear a Horse; for both the Governor and Priest had sent their Men down to me, to invite me to take up my Abode with them at their Houses.</P>
<P>Ay, but, said another, speaking low, as if I was not to hear him, for my Part, if I was the Captain, I should rather chuse to lodge with <HI>Singore Antonia Gumms,</HI> than with any one on the Island, he having always a good Stock of every Thing to eat, and more plenty than the Go∣vernor.</P>
<P>Ay, but, said another, the Priest has Meat and Fish oftner than <HI>Antonia Gumms,</HI> or any Body else on the Island.</P>
<P>It's true, said another; but if the Captain lives with the Priest, he will beg all his Cloaths from him, and you all know what a covetous Man he is; we cannot make any thing of a handsome Cotton Cloth Cap, or have any thing else that is either handsome or delightful, but presently he is begging it from us. Another said, That Stran∣gers were not reckon'd to be so subject to, or to set so much Value and Esteem on the <HI>Padre's (i. e.</HI> Priests) and especially <HI>English,</HI> as they did; nor even, if they were inform'd right, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> themselves: But that their Priests Power over them must be imputed to their Ignorance: And indeed there was all the Reason in the World it should be so; because what little Knowledge they had, they were oblig'd for it, they said, to the Priest, as having no other Means to obtain it, as
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
he had no other Means to obtain his, but by that Book which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> instructed him in, and left with him, when they consecrated him a Priest, and the Bishop blessed him, with the full Priestly Power and Authority to forgive and absolve Sins; But though Strangers had not that Power of for∣giving Sins among themselves, saving the Clergy, yet they believed they stood in no need of any Information or Knowledge from them, and there∣fore had no need of a Priest for Instruction, all the Use or Benefit which they had of him, being for Forgiveness of their Sins.</P>
<P>I told them, We never received Forgiveness of our Sins from a Priest, but always sought it of God alone, through Jesus Christ: They said, Except God or Christ personally or sensibly spoke to me, and let me know that he had pardoned me, they did not know how I could be satisfied that ever I had Absolution or Remission of my Sins, and consequently, for want of that Know∣ledge of being certain whether I was forgiven or not, I should never know of my being pardoned, and must certainly be always full of Fears and Doubts, whether I was in a State to qualify me for Heaven or Hell; but for their Parts, they could not be unprepared of a Certainty of Quali∣fication to go to Heaven; unless, by their own Negligence, they did not repair to the Priest for Absolution of all their Sins.</P>
<P>I told them, It was very well if they could purchase a Remission of their Sins at so easy a Rate, and in so satisfactory a Manner; They said, Yea, that they could, and the Priest dared not deny absolving any Man of his Sins, provided he confessed them to him; and it would be their own Fault, if they concealed their Sins, that they were not all pardoned.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="212"/>
But, continued they, We do not doubt, but when you come up to Town, that the Priest and you will have abundance of Discourse about these Matters, from whom you will have a better Ac∣count than we can give you, especially if you can speak <HI>Latin,</HI> as most of you Strangers, and more especially you that are Pilots, can.</P>
<P>After this Conversation, it beginning to grow late, those that left us, wished us a good Night, promising to return in the Morning, and bring me some Fish to eat, and so departed: And we that stayed behind, passed our Time in Discourses on my Condition and Circumstances; and having made a good Fire of the Pieces of the Wreck which they had brought on Shore, some of them lay down about it, or where they could best, to take their Rest and Sleep.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Basil,</HI> with <HI>Franklin,</HI> sat up with me by the Fire, and I took this Opportunity to tell them, That I should be glad to hear the Remainder of Signor <HI>Carolos</HI>'s Relation of his Adventures; and that, as I sup∣posed they had all frequently heard the same, and that therefore it would be no Novelty to them, I hoped they would not take it amiss, if I desired him to continue his Narrative in my own Tongue; because it would otherwise occasion a deal of Cir∣cumlocution, as I did not understand several Words in their Language, and should be obliged to in∣terrupt him often, for an Explanation of them. They reply'd, That they had, indeed, frequently heard him relate his Adventures; but that never∣theless, they were so very extraordinary, that they should never be tired in hearing them; But how∣ever, since it would contribute to my Satisfaction, they would take Pleasure in attending to his Talk, though they should not be able to understand him: And hereupon, turning to <HI>Franklin,</HI> they
<PB N="206" REF="213"/>
said, <HI>Pray,</HI> Singore Carolos, <HI>oblige the Captain with a Relation of your Adventures, or what else you think fit; and, as he desires, in your own Native Language.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I said,</HI> No, I should make shift to understand the most, or at least, a great Part of it, and what I did not understand, rather than make an Interruption in the Story, I would wait another Opportunity, or stay 'till I had a more perfect Idea and Understanding in the Country Language.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Franklin <HI>said,</HI> He believed he could express himself in such Words, as both they and the Cap∣tain could understand tolerably well.</P>
<P><HI>They answered,</HI> No, he would infinitely more oblige them to relate it to the Captain in his own Language; and therefore desired him to proceed, if I so pleased.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> It would not be good Manners for us to divert ourselves in a Language which they understood not, and would be no less than an Affront to offer; and especially as I knew that it was purely out of Respect to me, though undeserved at their Hands, that they were thus deprived of their natu∣ral Rest, as well as of the Diversion which they might have at their own Homes; and that it was the least that I could do, to endeavour all that in me lay, to be diverting to them, although it were to baulk my own Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> No, they could divert themselves very well; and besides, they should take more Delight to hear us talk in our own Language, though they could not understand a Syllable of it, for the Novelty of it, by far, than it would be to hear it in their own; and desired him to continue his Story.</P>
<P>Hereupon I desired Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> if he pleased, before he proceeded, to favour me with an Account of the Nature and Dispositions of the Inhabitants of this Island, because at present it might be of
<PB N="207" REF="214"/>
more Concern and Use to me to know, in order to regulate myself among them, without giving them any Cause of Offence, and ingratiate myself in their Favour, by all Means possible. As for the farther Description of the Island, or the Pro∣ductions of it, I said, we would refer that till ano∣ther Opportunity, or till I could satisfy myself ocularly, as not being of so much Importance at present, as the other would, because the Igno∣rance of their Humours, Customs, and Manners, might occasion me to disoblige them.</P>
<P>He was very ready to comply with my De∣sire, and said, That the People were affable and friendly, and very free of communicating any thing they possessed, one to another; but in an especial Manner to a Stranger, as he could assert by his own long Experience: That they were not inclinable to be soon affronted; and were very merry and chearful in their Way; and if I could be pleasant and chearful among them, it would inhance their Esteem for me, and they would take much more Notice of me, than if I behaved my∣self after a dull and melancholy Manner, or af∣fected Solitariness. I said, <HI>How can a Man in my Condition be merry? Surely, if they were to see me merry, or brisk, they must needs think that I not only lost little or nothing, but that also, I was got into a Country that exceeded mine by far, or else, that I must be a Fool, and incapable of a true Sense of my Misfortunes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> It was their little Sense of what a Misfortune was, as having but very little more Thought or Consideration that Way, than the Beasts of the Field, nor the least Notion, unless in a very dark and confused Manner, of any thing beyond the Extension or Limits of their Island; and for that Reason, <HI>continued he,</HI> they have so little Notion of Misfortunes, not having any thing themselves to lose,
<PB N="208" REF="215"/>
that all of them reckon your greatest Misfortune to be the Loss of your Cloaths, and your present Con∣finement here, in not being yet able to get up to their Town: For the rest, they look on it no otherways, than as though one of them had spent Two or Three Days at fishing, and had lost their Hooks and Time, and caught nothing; for as to that Part of the Mis∣fortune, of being absent from your native Country, though to them it would be the greatest Hardship in the World, yet they think it is nothing to us Stran∣gers, as they call us, because we are so used to it: Neither is it in mortal Power to convince them of the contrary: For all which Reasons (though I am very sensible that you must needs have a deep Sorrow for your present Misfortunes) as well as indeed for the Sake of your own Health, you must endeavour, as much as you can, to be chearful; for I know, by my own woful Experience, that nothing impairs the Health more than a settled Grief.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> It was very true, and I was not myself insensible of it, as having experimented it be∣fore this Time.</P>
<P>After we had discoursed a little upon this Head, I desired him, if he pleased, to finish the Account of his Adventures, as well while he was in <HI>Guinea,</HI> as also what occurred till his Arrival on this Island.</P>
<P>He said he would, and hoped it would be a a Means to divert me, and help pass the Night away the better; and began, saying,</P>
<P><Q>“I need not relate to you over again, what I have already done, and therefore shall proceed where I left off. The Notion that I had, that there was Gold within-Land, and that most of the Mountains abounded with it throughout all that vast Tract, more especially between the Latitudes of Twelve or Thirteen from the Northward and Southward, to the Equinoctial
<PB N="209" REF="216"/>
Line, and perhaps as far Southerly as that Land reaches, made me very solicitous to be sent up the Country by King <HI>Thome;</HI> and what strength∣en'd my Curiosity, was the Opportunity now offer'd, which would not leave them the least Room to suspect that it was design'd upon the Account of making any Remarks or Inspection, either into the Constitutions, Polity, or Strength of the Inhabitants, or of the Nature, Pro∣ductions, or Riches of the Country; of both which, as far as ever I could learn, the Natives, especially those within Land, are very jealous, and by that Means are unacquainted either with Strangers, or their Manner of Trade; and by the other Blacks bordering on the Sea-Coast, this Notion is kept up as much as possible, per∣haps to deter them from venturing down to the Sea-Coast to vend their Commodities; they prepossessing them with the Fear of being car∣ry'd off by the Whites, and likewise of the great Subtlety, as well as Power, which the <HI>Bacca∣rau's,</HI> or Whites, are Masters of; insomuch, that the most Part of those inland Nations do suppose, that it's entirely owing to their Coun∣try being yet undiscover'd by us, that they have hitherto remain'd secure from being totally subjected to us; and that whenever we come to know the Riches and Value of the Country, and its exceeding Populousness, we shall imme∣diately seize upon the Country, and carry them into Slavery in Foreign Countries at our Plea∣sure. They believe, that all the Whites think their inland Countries are nothing but wild and barren Desarts, frequented only with ravenous and voracious Beasts, of which they have a mighty Notion that we stand very much in fear; and tell the inland Blacks, that this is the Rea∣son the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> do not venture far up the
<PB N="210" REF="217"/>
Country; which Notions, said <HI>Franklin,</HI> I be∣lieve have been infus'd into them by the Nati∣ons who live along the Sea-Coast, out of Po∣licy to ingross the whole Trade into their own Hands; it being also usual with them to tell Strangers, on the other Hand, that there is no Gold in the inland Country, and that it is all contain'd in the Sands and Shore of the Rivers on the Coast: They have also Notions, that the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> have a new World, where they in∣tend to reside; but it wants a great deal to be done to it, to make it fit for their Reception: That they send all their most valuable Things from their old World thither; the Labour of which is carry'd on by the Negro's which they yearly carry from <HI>Guinea:</HI> That they want prodigious Numbers of Slaves to work in that new World, which they believe the Whites will all remove into as soon as it is got in order: That this new World is an inconceiveable De∣gree better than the old one; but that it will be an exceeding Length of Time before it can be fitted for the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> to go into: That dur∣ing all that long Time, all those Blacks which are yearly carried away off the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> must work and slave very hard, without any In∣termission or Redemption, until the new World is compleatly fitted up in a very beautiful Man∣ner, and the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> are all settled there; and that when that is done, they will have no farther Service for the Blacks, and will then send them home to this World again, and never more come to this old World, which the Blacks will be left to inhabit, without ever being mo∣lested by the Whites more. This happy Time they earnestly wish for, that they need not stand in fear of being made Slaves. They believe, that the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> trouble not their Heads any
<PB N="211" REF="218"/>
farther, than to carry them from <HI>Guinea</HI> to the new World; and that then they leave all the Work of fitting it up to be done by the Negro's, whom they deliver over for that Purpose to the Power of certain <HI>Fitteza's, (i. e.</HI> Demi-Gods) who have the Charge of managing, ordering, and contriving to make it as pleasant and delight∣ful as is possible: That these <HI>Fitteza's</HI> set the Negro's their Tasks, who are prodigiously <HI>fum∣fummed (i. e.</HI> beat) by them, if they do not perform them well.”</Q></P>
<P><HI>Franklin</HI> said, <Q>“”His being resident among them so long, gave him an Opportunity of being ac∣quainted with these Notions of the Inland Ne∣gro's, which might perhaps be new to me, as well as to others, who had only touch'd on the Sea-Coasts; for which Reason, he said, he had mention'd them to me, as a Novelty that might divert me.' He then proceeded to tell me, That he advis'd King <HI>Thome,</HI> in order to pre∣vent any Jealousy or Animosity between himself and Governor <HI>Plunket,</HI> to send him away to the King of his Acquaintance, and to imform the Governor, that that King came to visit him, and finding a White who could speak so much of their Language as to be understood, he had prevail'd upon him to permit him to go along with him, promising him his Favour, and Li∣berty to return whenever he pleas'd; and that to confirm the same, he <HI>(Franklin)</HI> would write a Letter to Governor <HI>Plunket,</HI> to assure him, that in a little Time he would return, and wait upon him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”This Advice, he said, pleas'd the King, who order'd it to be given out, that he was gone with King <HI>Bembolu</HI> to his Town, to abide with him a small Time; and that he wrote a Letter to Governor <HI>Plunket,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="212" REF="219"/>
Factory at <HI>Sierra Leon,</HI> (having brought no less than two Quire of Paper from the Pirates; which he would rather have wanted Cloaths than been without) in which he declar'd, That hav∣ing been taken by <HI>Roberts</HI> the Pirate on the <HI>American</HI> Seas, they not only depriv'd him of his Vessel, but forceably detain'd him as a Pri∣soner, and so strictly watch'd him, that he ne∣ver had an Opportunity to make his Escape till he arriv'd at <HI>Sierra Leon,</HI> where he got a Deli∣verance from them: That if he had fled for Refuge to them, they were too weak to defend him from <HI>Roberts,</HI> who was so formidable a Pirate, that he could have destroy'd their Set∣tlement for giving him Protection; which made it very happy for them, as well as himself, that he had put himself into the Power of the Negro Prince, instead of that of the Factory: That he was now going up in the Country with King <HI>Bembolu,</HI> to reside with him a small Time, and hoped he should have an Opportunity to make such Discoveries, as might be of Use to the whole Factory, and to the Trade of the <HI>English</HI> Nation in general; and concluded, with wish∣ing him and the Factory Health and Success,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>“”This Letter, continu'd he, I left with the King; who, after he had consulted his Nobles, sent me to the afore-nam'd King <HI>Bembolu,</HI> at∣tended by four of his Guards, with his Staff of State, which serves as a Credential; and the Blacks that accompany'd me, were to satisfy him in all Things that were necessary, and to tell him, that I was a potent <HI>Baccarau</HI> Prince, who was a great Friend to the Negro's, and had come thither to settle Trade, after a more ami∣cable Way than hitherto had been carry'd on between the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI> &amp;c. That he was seven Days on his Journey to King
<PB N="213" REF="220"/>
<HI>Bembolu</HI>'s Town, which, as nigh as he could compute, was a Journey of about ninety or a hundred Miles, to which he travell'd on Foot, stopping by the Way at several of their Towns, where they were used very courteously by every Body that they met: That for the first four Days he observ'd nothing of any Consequence; but after that, perceiv'd Gold among them in a very great abundance, but dared not make any Enquiry about it, or seem to take much Notice, as not very well understanding the common Speech, nor being able to place any Confidence upon any one, in the short Time they stopp'd any where as they went: That as soon as he had eaten or smoak'd, unless he lay down to sleep, they were for going; but if he lay half the Day, and feign'd himself asleep, they would let him lie undisturb'd: That he understood afterwards, that those who attended him, had Orders to give him no Opportunity to make any Remarks or Observations of the Country, and more especially to carry him the Desart Way as much as they could, and to see that he did not write at any Time; for though the King had taken all his Paper from him, telling him, He would have no Occasion to use it till he came back, and that he would lay it up safe for him till he return'd, for fear, as he under∣stood afterwards, that he should take Notes of the Country, &amp;c. yet they had an Opinion, that he, as well as all the Whites, had a <HI>Fitteza,</HI> (or <HI>Genius)</HI> who would bring him Paper, at his Call, or any Thing he wanted: That there∣fore his Attendants were directed, if they saw him have any Paper, and offer to write upon it, to deliver him up instantly to the King of <HI>Aucadingo,</HI> who, it seems, was an Enemy to them, as well as to all <HI>Whites.</HI> It was also
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
given them as a Caution, that if he was honest and good, and had no Design, they would per∣ceive it by his not writing; but if otherwise, he would call to his <HI>Fitteza,</HI> who would not fail to assist him with Paper, or what else he should have occasion for: And that in this Case, they should not offer any Violence to him them∣selves, but immediately deliver him up to the aforesaid King of <HI>Aucadingo,</HI> on whom alone the <HI>Fitteza's</HI> of the <HI>Baccarau's</HI> had no Power to act or hurt. At length, continu'd he, we ar∣riv'd at King <HI>Bembolu</HI>'s Town, or Court, call it which you please; and after the Blacks that conducted me, had shewn the Staff of Credit, and told their Errand, we were receiv'd with abundance of Respect and Honour; and there was gazing enough upon me, I being the first <HI>European</HI> that ever was remember'd to have been up at that Town.</Q></P>
<Q>“I was mightily made much of, said he, both by King <HI>Bembolu,</HI> and his Nobles, who shew'd me every Thing they thought might contribute to my Diversion. But having committed every Thing that pass'd of Conversation, and what I observ'd of Rarities, &amp;c. to Paper, I shall not take up your Time with repeating them now; referring myself to what I have written, which I will shew you when you can get up to Town, which I hope will not be long.”</Q>
<P>Why, <HI>said I,</HI> I cannot be satisfy'd how I shall do to get up to the Town, if it be so difficult as you all represent it to be.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> That I need not fear, but in a Day or two, if we had any Thing of fine Weather, but they would bring the Boat round here, and carry me up to <HI>Fuurno,</HI> where I should have a tolerable good Way, which though very steep, <HI>said he,</HI> yet it's very passable, even for Horses; although I question,
<PB N="215" REF="222"/>
whether any Horse in <HI>England</HI> would be able to get up from thence to Town, and yet that's the best Read reckon'd in all the Island. <HI>And indeed so it is.</HI></P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>said I,</HI> I sha'nt much mind whether I have a Horse or not, so I can but make shift to scramble up any how; I only wish, <HI>said I,</HI> I was gone from this Place.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd him,</HI> Whether the Inhabitants knew how to manage a Boat? or, Who it was that would order the Boat down?</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> That it belong'd to a Man call'd <HI>Anto∣nio Riverio;</HI> but he believ'd that the Governor would see to get some Hands to bring it down for me, as soon as it was fine Weather.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> If he thought it would be any Thing difficult, or troublesome, that I would rather venture to swim cross the Bay, with the Mast or Boom, guided by three or four of the Blacks, than give them too much Trouble, or tarry the Uncertainty of their coming.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> It was very possible I might go over the Bay very safe, in the Manner I propos'd, or even without Mast, Boom, or any Thing else to help me, more than the Blacks alone, though the Bay were ten Times as wide as it is: But, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> you need not at all doubt of the Boat being brought down for you as soon as the Weather permits; for I will go to Town myself to Morrow, and will speak with the Governor, and likewise with <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> for the Boat; and if no Body else will, I am sure <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> and his Brother, will come with me; but I rather fear I shall have more offer their Service to go in her, than she will be able to carry, or I care to encumber myself with.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd him,</HI> How big the Boat was? <HI>and,</HI> How many it required to bring her down?</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="223"/>
<HI>He said,</HI> It was but a little Bauble of a Thing; two Men could carry it very easily, when it had been some time out of the Water and dry; but that he had known six, seven, or eight People in her at a Time.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>said I,</HI> because they did not matter half a Farthing, whether she sunk or swam with them, because they could always save themselves by swim∣ming, if at any Time they were put to it.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> It was true enough; for they would hardly venture in her farther off the Shore, than they were sure they could save themselves by swim∣ming, if Occasion so requir'd: Nay, <HI>said he,</HI> and I believe was it never so good a Boat, and never so large, it would be the same.</P>
<P>What Sort of a Boat is she, <HI>said I?</HI> or did they make her themselves? Why, <HI>said he,</HI> when you see her, you will say you never saw such a Thing in your Life; but she does well enough to go a fishing with; and I have been with her myself, and four more, as far as the little Islands, which you saw as you came along to this Island.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>said I,</HI> sure they would not pretend to swim from the little Islands to this Island.</P>
<P><HI>He smiled, and said,</HI> If it were not for fear of the voracious Fish, of which there is great Plenty about these Islands, they would not fear swimming a great Way farther; <HI>and speaking to</HI> Domingo <HI>in the Island Language, he told him what we were talking of, and how I thought it impossible for a Man to swim from the little Islands</HI> (Guy's) <HI>to the Island of St.</HI> John<HI>'s: At which</HI> Domingo <HI>laugh'd, and said,</HI> That if it was not for fear of the Fish, he could swim to the Island of St. <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I thought it impossible for him, or any Body else, to swim one Quarter so far, not∣withstanding I knew that all, or most black People,
<PB N="217" REF="224"/>
swam very well; <HI>(it being eight large</HI> English <HI>Leagues).</HI></P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> I was very much mistaken, it being possible for a Man, provided the Cramp did not take him, to be in the Water several Days.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I thought half a Day, or less, would have been Time enough, and more than enough, to spend the strongest Man in the World.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> I was much mistaken.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Franklin <HI>told</HI> Domingo, That I was some∣thing fearful of going in the Boat to <HI>Fuurno; who answer'd,</HI> That if the Boat was to fill with Water as soon as ever we turn'd the <HI>Salt Point,</HI> he would engage, with the Assistance of one more, whom he could pick out, to carry me safe up to the <HI>Fuurno.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> It might be so; but I would much ra∣ther be carry'd round in the Boat, than put him to the Trouble, or myself in the Danger.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> As for the Trouble, he should think it none; and as to Danger, I run none; yet he would much rather that I went round in the Boat, because, that in the oversetting or filling of the Boat with Water, I might chance to lose some of my Things.</P>
<P><HI>I said,</HI> Ay, and your Boat too. No, <HI>said he,</HI> we should not lose our Boat neither, except it was very bad Weather, and a Lee Current; for, <HI>said he,</HI> I am sure in fine Weather, I and three more could bring that Boat safe into the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> if she was to be filled with Water, and half Way over between here and St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s: <HI>He added,</HI> That <HI>Franklin</HI> knew what he said to be true; who was, <HI>he said,</HI> the knowingest Man on the Island; nay, and did believe, there were not many white <HI>Piloto's</HI> that knew so much of the Sea, or how to govern a Boat in the Sea, as he did; and therefore, if <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> would go up with him to Morrow, he would go and ask <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> for his Boat, and get as many good Hands as <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> should think suffici∣ent,
<PB N="218" REF="225"/>
if I could dispense with <HI>Singore</HI>'s Absence so long; or if not, he would go himself, and get the Boat down, and so bring us both up together, with all my Things.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd him, and told him,</HI> If <HI>Singore Caro∣los</HI> pleas'd to give himself the Trouble to go, and come with him, I should not only be very willing but should also take it as a very great Favour.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> said, He would go up with <HI>Do∣mingo</HI> to bring down the Boat for the more Dis∣patch. After which we fell into other Talk, sometimes about one Thing, and sometimes about another, till at last <HI>Domingo,</HI> with his Brother, and all the rest of the Blacks fell asleep: After which, upon my Desire, Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> re-assum'd his Discourse about his last Adventures, and how he came to be placed on this remote Island. But as the Relation of them would too much break in upon my own History, and indeed require a Vo∣lume of itself, I shall at present pass them by, and return to what more immediately relates to myself.</P>
<P>After our long Discourse, I began to grow sleepy, and laid me down on the Rock, by the Fire Side, in order to take a Nap, and <HI>Franklin</HI> did the same, and so we fell fast asleep; <HI>Domingo</HI> in the mean time awaking, took Care of the Fire, and was so kind, as to raise my Head softly, and, without waking me, laid it in his Lap, which might be one good Reason of my not waking till the Morning.</P>
<P>About eight or nine a-Clock in the Forenoon, came down from Town a Parcel of the Natives, to the Number of twelve or fourteen, two of whom were sent by the Governor, with a Side of wild Goat, a couple of Pompions, a Water-Me∣lon, a little Calabash of Milk, containing about a Quart, and with his Service, promised me, that
<PB N="219" REF="226"/>
he would send me more on the Morrow, or next Day, if I tarry'd so long; but hoped to have me up to Town in a Day or two.</P>
<P>He understood (they said) what a difficult Place I was got ashore at, it being impossible, as he was inform'd, for me to climb up the Rocks from where I was; besides, if it were, he would by no Means have me, for fear I should tumble down and lose my Life, the Rocks being, as he was in∣form'd, so rotten, that I could not be certain or secure, either by Foot or Hand-hold; and was sorry that I could not swim over the Bay, which if I could, I might then travel up to Town, which though it might seem to me a difficult Way, yet it would then be without any Danger; but he would not have me be troubled at that, for he had bor∣row'd a Boat, which was the only one they had on the Island fit to swim; (for he had a Boat himself, but she had lain, it seems, two Years on the dry Land, and was then in a Manner all to Pieces, neither did they know how to repair her; though afterwards I put them in the Way; but concerning this, he did not send me any Account now, but I understood it afterwards) but he sent me Word also, that the Owner would let the Boat come for me, on this Condition only, that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> himself should go in the Boat; for else he would not trust his Boat to the Management of the Blacks, for fear of losing his Boat. And therefore (continu'd the Governor's Man) <HI>Singore Governador</HI> would have you, to get <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> to go up to Town to Night; and if it should be fine Weather to Morrow, you may be brought up to the <HI>Fuurno.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, I thank'd his Master, and would speak directly to <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> about it, who was standing by all the Time, and heard all our Dis∣course; and preventing my asking him, said, I
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
need not give myself the Trouble, for he was resolv'd, as he had given me his Word last Night, as did also <HI>Singore Domingo Gumms,</HI> to have gone up to Town, in order to have borrow'd the Boat of the▪ Owner <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> himself, and like∣wise to have got some more Blacks to assist him and <HI>Singore Domingo,</HI> to bring down the Boat from where she was for me; but was glad the Governor had done it to his Hand, not so much upon the Account of saving him the Trou∣ble, which, in respect to whom it was for, (mean∣ing me) it would not be any; yet, as it was the Governor's Act, it would prevent any Heart-burn∣ing or Jealousy. Why, said I, what Jealousy or Heart-burning could it occasion to you, to endea∣vour to get me out of this melancholy, disconso∣late, as well as dangerous Place, where a Man is not secure one Moment from being dashed to Pieces, by the Rocks and Stones so frequently tumbling down? and surely, continu'd I in <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> these People must be of a very dangerous, as well as barbarous Principle, to be angry or dis∣pleas'd with any Person, for endeavouring to rescue one from the almost hourly Danger of Death, as we all are threaten'd with, by the so often tumbling down of the Stones from the Mountains.</P>
<P>This mostly happen'd early in the Mornings, and late in the Evenings, which gave me very good Ground to believe the Reason which the Blacks gave for it, as they said by ocular Demonstration, which was, that it was the wild Goats going to their Dens and Caves on the Edge of the Moun∣tain, whose Foot was at the Top of the Rock under which we were; for the Land rises some∣thing like those Draughts, which are drawn to re∣present the Pyramids of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> the Foot of one Mountain being, as it were, the Top of ano∣ther, till you descended to the Sea; and thus they
<PB N="221" REF="228"/>
rise one above another, till you arrive at the Mid∣dle of the Island, which is the highest; and which, though at a Distance off at Sea it appears with a rounding Head, yet when you are on the Top of it, it then seems indifferent flat, yet de∣clining till you come to the Edges, which then goes down steep, something like St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cupu∣lo, rising as it were out of the Body of the Church, and at every Height of Pillars, and ends in a roundish flat Head, supposing the Cross, &amp;c. not to be there.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo Gumms</HI> being also present when Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> spoke to me, and at all our Discourse, said it was Time to be going to Townwards.</P>
<P>To whom Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> said, It was Time enough after they had got their Dinner. <HI>Domingo</HI> said, There was nothing here but only Pomption and Water-Melon to eat, which they could get up at Town, except the Milk which the Governor had sent the Captain, which he thought would be a pity to rob him off.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> said, He was sure that some of those that went to the <HI>Piscaree Picuana,</HI> would come and bring some Fish with them for my Din∣ner, and he would stay and eat some Fish and Pompion with me before he went to Town. <HI>Do∣mingo</HI> said, He was afraid it would be too late to stay their coming, and after that the boiling of the Fish and Pompion.</P>
<P>To which Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> said, Then he would not stay the boiling of either; but would cut some Pompion and roast, and if they brought the Fish before it was enough, he would take a Fish and broil it to eat with the Pompion, and if they did not, he would eat a Piece of Pompion, and then walk with him to Town; And, said he to <HI>Domingo,</HI> What need you be in such Haste? You know if we were to go away from hence, to get
<PB N="222" REF="229"/>
up to <HI>Porto de Cauvra</HI> by Day-light, we can get well enough up to Town by Night, and 'twill be more pleasant to walk then, than in the Day, when the Sun shines so hot.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> said, As for their getting up, he did not fear that, and for his own Part, he could get up better than most of the Blacks on the Island, and even in the Night, if Necessity required it; but he was urgent to get up to Town before Night, to speak with the Governor and <HI>Antonio Riverio,</HI> that he might procure such Hands, as he thought proper, to launch the Boat in the Morning before Day, in order, if the fair Wea∣ther continued, to be back with me to the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> before the Day Gale came on.</P>
<P>To which Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> said, That as for their coming back to <HI>Fuurno</HI> on the Morrow, it would be impossible, before the Day-Breeze set in; and as they must hale the Boat ashore where they could find a Place out of the Danger of the Sea's staving her at high Water, so they must wait all Night to take me, and my Things, in the next Morning at Day-break, otherways, they would not be able to row up to <HI>Fuurno</HI> before the Day Breeze set in, by reason that the Rowl or Set of the Sea, even in a Calm, was always to Leeward; and therefore, he would rather come down in the Afternoon, when the Day-Breeze blew strong down, because the Wind would drive the Boat faster than they could row in a Calm.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> said, He knew best what could be done; but that the Boat being but small, if I thought well of it, they that intended to go up that Night, would every one carry some of my Things with them.</P>
<P>I thanked them very kindly; but said, I had nothing now left me, what with the Pirates, and
<PB N="223" REF="230"/>
the Sea, that was worth their taking the Pains to carry with so much Jeopardy.</P>
<P>Yes, said he, you have still enough left you, to be the richest Man upon our Island.</P>
<P>At which I smiled, and said, Then the Island is very poor.</P>
<P>He said, That he was sure I had more Cloaths, than any Two on the Island, not excepting the Priest himself.</P>
<P>I said, I never had less in all my Life.</P>
<P>He said, That might be, and told me, That if I, and <HI>Singore Carolos,</HI> thought well of it, he would then also carry my little Boy with him up to Town.</P>
<P>I told him, I did not think it proper nor safe, and would rather the Boy went up with me when I went.</P>
<P>He told me, As for the Safeness, he would en∣gage the Child should go as safe as he did, and would take it upon himself to carry him up, and the Child should come to no Disaster, but what he should participate of, and <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> should be the Judge.</P>
<P>I told him, If he could get the Child up those Rocks, which they all along represented to me so difficult to ascend, and who, in a manner, was helpless, surely I might, with a little of their Assistance, make shift to get up.</P>
<P>He told me, No, for the Rocks were so steep and difficult, as well as rotten and dangerous, that I should never be able to get up.</P>
<P>Why, said I, then how can the Child get up? for I am sure I can climb up much better than he.</P>
<P>Why, says he, I can carry him upon my Back, and that I cannot do you.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="231"/>
But, said I, I should think I could get up any Place that you could carry such a big Boy as that.</P>
<P>He said, No, and if I would not believe him, he bid me ask <HI>Singore Carolos.</HI></P>
<P>To which Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> made Answer, saying, It was true what <HI>Singore Domingo</HI> said, for he could with Ease and Security, he was well assured, climb up where neither himself, nor I, could, nor would care to venture.</P>
<P>Truly, said I, unless I was sure of the Boys going safe, I would not let him go by any means.</P>
<P>He said, I need not fear, if <HI>Domingo</HI> took the Charge upon him, for then he was sure he would sooner suffer a Disaster himself, than the Boy: Why, said I, I do not see any Advantage in sending the Boy up now, and, I think, he may as well go round in the Boat, when I go round; for he could be but little Weight in the Boat.</P>
<P><HI>Franklin</HI> said, That was true enough; but still he thought, since they desired it, it would be better to let the Boy go up now; and perhaps, my refusing might be taken as if I mistrusted them.</P>
<P>I said, I did not much fear but they would do as well as they could; but was not willing the poor Child should run any more Hazard, than I did myself.</P>
<P>He said, As to the Hazard, he was satisfied there could be none; for if <HI>Domingo</HI> was not sure of carrying him safe up, he would never under∣take it; who, to his Knowledge, was so sure-footed, that there was none on the Island could, or dared venture to go where he could; nor could a wild Goat escape from him, that he had a Mind to catch; and it was his Opinion, That I had best send the Boy up now.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="232"/>
Well, said I, in God's Name, I will venture, and if you find any Difficulty in getting the Boat for me, I will then try to get up myself.</P>
<P>He said, I need not fear the Boat's coming for me the first Opportunity of fine Weather.</P>
<P>Said I, Don't you reckon this fine Weather that we have now?</P>
<P>Yes, said he, and if it continues as it is now, you need not at all doubt, with God's Leave, the Boats being down some time To-morrow.</P>
<P>I said, I wish'd and hop'd it would, and thought it best for them to go the sooner on the Account of the Boy, that they might be past the most dangerous Part of the Way before it was dark.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> said, They had Time enough; but <HI>Domingo</HI> said, It was better to go now, and then they should have Day-light all the Way; as likewise, that it would be something tedious car∣rying the Boy at his Back.</P>
<P>By this Time, they beheld some of the Blacks, who went from us the preceding Night, (accom∣pany'd, as it prov'd, by the three Men I had brought with me from St. <HI>Nicholas)</HI> coming with some Fish; whereupon <HI>Franklin</HI> said, he would broil and eat a Fish before he went.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> said, He would not stay upon the Boy's Account; and press'd me to let him carry him up then; so I yielded: And Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> told <HI>Do∣mingo,</HI> That as they did not go one Way, he be∣ing forc'd to swim over the Bay before he could ascend the Rocks, and <HI>Domingo</HI> going with the Boy right up, he might be going on, and as soon as he had eaten his Fish, he would follow him; and considering that he had the Boy to carry, he believ'd he should overtake him, and which ever of them first arriv'd at the first <HI>Curraal de Vauca,</HI> to stay there till the other came.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="233"/>
To this <HI>Domingo</HI> consented; and taking a Cot∣ten Sash, he bound the Boy with it on his Back, and four more Men accompany'd him, and took some of my old Rags, and some of the painted Lineing of my Cabbin, which was saved as afore related, and away they went; and after Mr. <HI>Frank∣lin</HI> had broil'd and eaten one Fish, he also depart∣ed, with two or three Blacks who chose to go his Way, promising his utmost Diligence to bring the Boat, or let me see him, if any Accident hap∣pen'd to hinder his coming with it. The Priest's and Governor's Men went also away to Town.</P>
<P>I then turn'd myself to the three Men I had brought with me from St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> and the first Salutation I had from them, was a Weeping and Howling after the Negro Manner, to testify their Sorrow for my Misfortune, as also their Respect to me; and made abundance of Protestations on that Head; for it seems the Inhabitants had very much blamed them for their leaving, and not assisting me.</P>
<P>I told them, It was very well; and it being neither a seasonable Time or Place to upbraid them, I made as though they were not much blameable.</P>
<P>One of them, whose Name was <HI>Manuel,</HI> told me, That since it pleased God that I had escap'd with my Life, notwithstanding their Baseness in so leaving me, and not assisting me, which he was heartily asham'd of, and should never forgive him∣self for; and having given over all Hopes of ever seeing his Native Land, Wife, or Children, he therefore would dedicate his remaining Days to my Service; and that it was with that Intent he was come down, and was resolv'd not to go up till I went, and desir'd that I would take him no other∣ways than as my Servant, or Slave.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="234"/>
I thank'd him, and told him, That I only de∣sir'd to be esteem'd as a Friend by them, and by all the Natives of the Island.</P>
<P>To which all present answer'd, That I need not doubt the Friendship of the whole Island; and they believ'd me to be so good and honest a <HI>Sin∣gore,</HI> that I could not fail of being belov'd by all People where-ever I came; and <HI>Manuel</HI> desir'd me not to use any Compliment to him, but to take him as he had freely offer'd himself to me, and was resolv'd to be no otherwise than my Slave as long as he liv'd.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, but told him, I was in no Con∣dition of providing for myself, much less to have Servants to provide for. He told me, He did not offer himself with that View, but rather that he should work and provide for me; and that it was his full Resolution, not to leave me while he liv'd: For all which I thank'd him; and so fell into other Discourse, needless here to relate, till our Fish and Pompion were boil'd, which was to∣wards Sun-set, whereof I made a hearty Meal, every one forcing upon me three or four times the Quantity of what each of themselves had, and being serv'd on a broken Piece of Calabash, or, for want of that, on a clean flat Stone ga∣ther'd off the Beach; and they were so respect∣ful, that not one of them would presume to eat with me, except <HI>Nicholau Verd,</HI> who once took that Liberty, for which he was roundly check'd by all that were then present; and though I often importun'd them to let me eat with them, or some of the ancientest of them, yet they never would accept of it; but modestly reply'd, That black Men were made to serve white Men, and that it was honour enough to wait on the Whites, without being their Companions, or Equals.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="235"/>
I must confess, it put me even to the Blush to see such Humility, as well as Hospitality, amongst those innocent and ignorant poor Creatures, when I consider'd how vastly they exceed us in those Virtues, who pretend to so much Learning and Knowledge: And in particular, their Veneration for Age is extremely laudable and worthy of Imi∣tation; they paying a great Regard to their El∣ders of all Ranks.</P>
<P>After eating, we pass'd our Time away as well as our Circumstances would permit, being parti∣cularly edify'd by the Charity, Morality, and Kindness of those Persons, whom, tho' we count Savages or Barbarians, far exceed the Generality of us Christians, to our Shame be it spoken, tho' we pretend, and really have so many greater Ad∣vantages over them.</P>
<P>I was very uneasy about the Boy, and longed to hear of his being safe got up the Rocks; and the Morning proving fine Weather, as did also the Night past, gave us all Reason to expect the Boat down; but in vain.</P>
<P>About Noon it began to blow fresh, and some of the Blacks swam over to the <HI>Salt Point</HI> to look out for the Boat, and took their fishing Geer with them, and came back in the Evening with a good Mess of Fish.</P>
<P>I do believe, that I did not more long, or wish for the Boat, than these kind-hearted Creatures did, but it was all in vain; and what made us the more impatient, no body came down from Town to tell us the Reason.</P>
<P>About duskish two of the Blacks went up to know the Occasion of it; and we pass'd the Night as well as we could.</P>
<P>Next Day, about Noon, came down two Men from Town, who told us, That <HI>Singore Antonio Riverio</HI> had lent the Boat, and that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="236"/>
had sent <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> with Hands enough down, and promis'd himself to follow them: That <HI>Domingo</HI> went down accordingly, and lay all Night at the Boat, and not seeing <HI>Singore Ca∣rolos</HI> come, he launch'd the Boat into the Water, and waited till the Sun was up; but no <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> coming, he sent a Man up to Town to know the Reason of it, who, upon Enquiry, found, that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> went from Town about the first Cock-crow, and that they thought he had been down at the Boat, or a good Part of his Journey towards where I was, before then; But, continu'd they, we have as bad News as all that to tell you, which is, That one of the two Men that left you last Night, can't be heard of: He that went with him says, That when they went in the Water, one said to the other, Let us see which of us can swim cross the Bay swiftest; and that having out-swam his Consort a pretty Way, all of a sudden he could not hear him; and that he turn'd, and call'd him several times, but re∣ceiving no Answer at all, he made the best of his Way in a Fright to the other Side of the Bay, and so got ashore, and travell'd in the Night up to Town; and says, That he does not know, whe∣ther it was the Cramp took him, or whether it was a Fish devour'd him; but however, it so terrify'd them, that never after any of them would ven∣ture to swim over that Bay.</P>
<P>I express'd my Concern hereat; and ask'd him, Whether he had heard any Thing of the little Boy? He said, Yes, he was got safe up, and the Governor would fain have had him lived with him, but <HI>Singore Antonio Gumms</HI> would not let him, but kept him with himself, saying, he had most Right to do so; for that his Son <HI>Domingo</HI> had brought him up with great Hazard and Difficulty, and hoped the Captain would not only let him conti∣nue
<PB N="230" REF="237"/>
with him, but also would himself take up his Abode with him; and had order'd <HI>Domingo,</HI> and all his Sons, as they tender'd his future Favour, not to neglect their utmost Diligence to get the Captain up, as soon as possible.</P>
<P>I was very glad to hear the Boy was safe, and heartily wish'd myself with him.</P>
<P>I heard nothing farther till the next Day in the Afternoon, when <HI>Domingo</HI> came down, and confirm'd to me what the Man had told me the Day before; and that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> had order'd him and the Men down, and promis'd to follow them that Night: That thereupon he launch'd the Boat in the Morning to be the more ready, and when to his Surprize he came not, he sent a Man up to Town to know the Reason, who brought him Word, that he had set out from the Town about Cock-crow, and they thought he had been with us; and, continu'd he, we waited till almost Night, and then haled the Boat up on the Land again, and so went up to Town, where we had an Account, that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> was taken so bad on the Way, as he was coming down to us, that he was like to die; and that it was by meer Chance he was found, and was brought up to Town on an Ass, being so weak, that two Men were forced to support him: He added, That the Townsmen were just going, if he had not come up, to send them Word to hale the Boat up, if he had launch'd her, and come to Town again, for that <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> would not trust the Boat without <HI>Singore Carolos;</HI> after which, said he, my Father would have me come down to acquaint you, and desires that you would rest contented a little, till it please God <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> is better, which if he is not in a little Time, we will make shift, by some how or other, to get you from hence, &amp;c. And withal, says he, my Father gives
<PB N="231" REF="238"/>
his Service to you, and bid me tell you, that your little Boy is safe with him, and hopes he shall have the Honour of entertaining you both, when you come up; and although he is not Go∣vernor now, yet he might have continu'd so as long as he pleas'd, and does not doubt, but he shall be able to entertain you as well as any one upon the Island, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I return'd him Thanks for his unmerited Fa∣vours; but was not a little troubled at my Disap∣pointment of the Boat, and the more, by Reason of their Aversion and fear to swim over the Bay, occasion'd by the late Disaster; by which my Hopes that Way were cut off: However, I pass'd the following Night as well as I could, neither wanting Company, nor enough to eat of the best the Island afforded.</P>
<P>Next Morning I told <HI>Domingo,</HI> I had a great Mind to try to get up the Rocks. He disswaded me all he could, urging the Impossibility, as well as Danger. I told him, I was sure I could get up any where, where he was able to get up with such a great Boy, as my Boy was that he carry'd up. He said, I could not. I told him, If they would assist me, I would try, and perhaps I might do better than they imagin'd; and if I found that I could not, which I should never be con∣vinc'd of till I try'd, then, said I, I must desist, and be contented as well as I can, till it please God some other Means offer.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> said, He was afraid I should get so high, that it might be very hazardous to get me down again; and was positive I could not get quite up, nor any one upon the Island with Shoes on. I told him, I would very readily pull my Shoes off, after I had gone as far as I could with them.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239"/>
Some of the Blacks present said to <HI>Domingo,</HI> Let us go and assist him; you see how desirous he is, and perhaps his Eagerness may enable him to do better than we think for.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> said, That I myself could not be more desirous to get safe up, than he was; but he knew the Impossibility of it; but however, said he, to please the Captain, and to let him see that no En∣deavour shall be wanting, let us go six or eight of us, and try what we can do.</P>
<P>So away we went, and <HI>Domingo</HI> led the Way. It was low Water, and we walk'd on the Beach, along by the Foot of the Rock, about three or four large Stones-cast, till we found one of the best Places to mount at, tho' God knows bad enough. <HI>Domingo</HI> sent a young Fellow up first to try whether the Way was passable; who soon mounted up out of Sight, and was gone a little above a Quarter of an Hour, and then return'd again, and said, he had been a good Way up, and that Place was better to go up at, than any other they had yet found out. <HI>Domingo</HI> bid me stay a little, and he would go up a little Way to view it, that I might not be forc'd to come back, perhaps after I had got up some Part of the Way; for, said he, we are often forc'd to do so ourselves. He accordingly went a little Way, and came down to me again, and said, it was much the bet∣ter Way of any he had seen yet. The Rock was pretty steep, but not right Perpendicular, about the Height of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cupola, or higher; after which, it seem'd to overhang as much as the lower sloped in; but they told me, That after I got up there, there was a good Path in some Places; so up we got, and I found the Hold that we had with our Feet was so little, that I was forc'd to pull off my Shoes, and they supporting me below, that my Feet should not slip, and them that was
<PB N="233" REF="240"/>
got above me, when they attain'd to any Place that they could secure themselves, (which they could very well do, when they got a Place to fix their Feet upon two or three Inches broad) then they would reach down their long Staffs for me to take hold of, and hale me up, those below shoveing me up with their Hands; and when I was out of their Reach that Way, then they would shove me up with their long Staves, till I had attain'd some Place to hold and secure myself with my Feet and Hands, while they shifted higher, and fix'd themselves to assist my ascending another Degree.</P>
<P>When I was about half Way up the first Rock, I began to sweat with Fear: I looked down but once after I had got any Thing high; but I be∣lieve, had I not been supported, I should have tumbled down: My very Sight dazled; nor is it possible for any one to conceive how it is, except those who have been in the like Cases, nor they neither have the Idea so lively or striking after∣wards.</P>
<P>At last we got up to the first Resting-Place, which, as I told you before, was as high or higher than St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cupola at <HI>London,</HI> from the Bot∣tom of the Rock, and we had then a flat pretty even Path, which look'd like a Gallery, only want∣ing Rails: We walk'd along that Path, which was about three Foot broad, for about half a quarter of a Mile, or more, sometimes descend∣ing, but mostly ascending; and in some Places so narrow and dangerous, that they were oblig'd to pass some of them first, and then reach the End of their Staves to me, while those behind bounded me to with their Staves till I got over.</P>
<P>When we had wander'd to the End of that Vein, as I may call it, the Rock was in a Manner Perpendicular, and we could hardly find a Place whereon to fix ones Toe, or Tops of ones Fin∣gers,
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
which put a Stop to my Journey: They search'd all about to find a Way passable for me, but all in vain, and had like to have prov'd fatal to some of them; for as they search'd, and climb'd, a great Piece of a rotten crumbly Rock tumbled down; and two of them, of which <HI>Do∣mingo</HI> was one, had the narrowest Escape that ever I knew or heard of; which was thus, One of them was got up a pretty Heighth above the other two, on a Pinacle or Piece of a Rock that stood without the rest; and one of them thrusting and striking at it with his Staff, to see whether it was hollow, or would bear him, as is their usual Practice, there tumbled down a huge Piece of Rock that was right over those two, who, like two Rats, were clinging to the Rocks with their Feet and Hands: But as Providence would have it, it roul'd offwards, without doing them much Damage, save the Fright, and a few Scratches, occasion'd, as I suppose, by some of the small Stones that dropt down after the great Piece of the Rock was fallen; but it rais'd such a Dust, that the Air, for as far as we could discern, was all, as it were, in a thick Smoak, and it made such a terrible Noise, that I thought all the Rocks over us were coming down upon us; and I verily believe, it was half a quarter of an Hour before the tumbling Pieces of the Rocks reach'd the Bottom, for so long or longer I heard the Sound of them falling; for we were then got a prodigi∣ous Height up, and, by our turning and winding, quite out of Sight of the Sea, it being along the Edge of the Mountain, where the Gathering of the Waters is from the Inland in the Rains, and so passes down to the Sea, making deep Gullies where the Rock is soft, and where not, descends in great Falls.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="242"/>
After all was quiet, and the Dust laid, we knew not what to do, neither seeing nor hear∣ing any of the Three that were gone before us to discover the Way; at last, one of them that was with me, after recovering of his Fright, said, That he believed <HI>Domingo Gums,</HI> and the other Two that were with him, were killed; and that it was their being on that Rock, that made it tumble down: When presently, we heard a Whooping and Hollowing, which we answered, and as soon as they had again descended down that Precipice, which they had so dangerously strove to ascend, they came to us, who all this Time sat still, squeezing ourselves as close to the Rock as we could, for fear any more should tum∣ble down. When <HI>Domingo</HI> came to us, he was very much rejoic'd to see us all well, thinking that we had been closer after them, and that we had been kill'd by the Rocks that tumbled down; and said, He thought it was one of the greatest Dangers that ever he was in; And, says the Man that was a-top, that tumbled the Rock down, I thought that <HI>Domingo,</HI> and all of you were kill'd; and the Noise of it was so great, that the very Rock trembled whereon I stood, and I expected every Minute it would tumble down, and me with it; but, said he to me, if you was a little higher than where you are, you might get up more easily than what you have already pass'd; but that it was impossible, as he thought, for me to get to the Place where he stood when the Rocks fell; neither would he himself venture to go there again.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> said, He would rather than any thing that I was down again; and that I must not pre∣tend to strive to go any higher.</P>
<P>I told him, Except they could find a better Way than this we were now in, I might as well
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
lie down here and die, as attempt it. Neither, continu'd I, have I any Hopes of getting this Way; but sure, said I, that was a better Way that you went, when you carry'd the Boy at your Back, than this that we came now.</P>
<P>He said, He thought that Way was rather worse as to climbing, only that the Rocks were something stronger and firmer than these; But, said he, don't be cast down nor discourag'd at this; the worst Jobb we have now, is to get you down again, the which, when accomplish'd, you need not doubt your getting up to Town, whether <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> be well or no: And, continu'd he, I wish <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> had tarry'd down with you, and I had gone without him for the Boat, which, had it been so, you would have been at Town before now. As for getting you to Town, added he, I am not a bit concern'd; for I do not fear having the Liberty of the Boat from <HI>Antonio Riverio</HI> myself, if <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> should not be able to go in her; but if not, I will take her whe∣ther he will or not.</P>
<P>Then said I, they will blame me if any Misfor∣tune should happen to the Boat. He said, No, he would take all that upon himself, and knew himself able so to do, and give any Man upon the Island a Knock on the Pate that should offer to check or stop him, excepting <HI>Singore Antonio</HI> his Father, and <HI>Singore Padre</HI> the Priest; But, said he, we must now make it our present Endea∣vour to get you down again to the Sea, and then leave the rest all to me; after which, you your∣self shall be judge, whether our Family, or the Governor, or Priest, or any on our Island, de∣serves most to have the Credit and Honour of en∣tertaining you at their House; and hope you will do the Honour to those who are most careful of your Welfare.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="244"/>
I told him, I was very sensible I could neither honour nor credit any Body, by giving them the Trouble to maintain me, but should rather take it as an Honour, as well as Charity, done to myself, that any one on the Island would contribute so far only, as to prevent the Boy's and my starving, until it pleas'd God of his Mercy to put into our Hands an Opportunity of getting into our own Country again.</P>
<P>He told me, He would have me not to doubt, that all the Island, as well as the Inhabitants, was at my Service.</P>
<P>I told him, I had no Reason at all to doubt of their Goodness and Hospitality towards me, hav∣ing receiv'd Proofs enough already, and a very re∣markable one but now, by their but late narrow and miraculous escaping the losing of their Lives, in endeavouring to serve me; and hoped the Fright of that would not deter them from affording me their further Assistance, without which I could expect nothing less than inevitably to perish here, among these hideous, frightful, and dismal Rocks.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> told me, That all the Difficulty that I should encounter with more, would be in getting down again to where I came from, and after that he would have me be easy, and leave the rest to him.</P>
<P>God knows, said I, how it will be; but, come Life, come Death, I must submit to it; and have this Satisfaction, that if I do perish, I perish among those whose Desires and Endeavours have not, and, I believe, will not be wanting to extri∣cate me, as far as they are able. At which the kind-hearted <HI>Domingo,</HI> with a Voice of Concern, and Tears in his Eyes, reply'd, O <HI>Singore Capiteen,</HI> I have begun to assist you, and will lose my Life, or get you up safe to Town.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="245"/>
Every one present express'd themselves in the same Manner, tho' not in so tender an Accent, as <HI>Domingo;</HI> and so we set out to return the same Way that we went; and when we were arriv'd at the End of our unrail'd Gallery, and some of them were about descending the Rock, where we had first ascended, <HI>Domingo</HI> call'd to them to stop, and said, He would not trust the Captain to go down now, that the Rocks were more crumbly; as indeed I afterwards found by Experience they were, occasion'd, I suppose, by the Scorching of the Sun, which, as it were, calcined them, and made them more apt to crumble and break; whereas in the Night, they seem'd to attract from the Air a Kind of <HI>Gluten,</HI> which cemented and render'd them more strong and firm: Whether I have properly accounted for their being stronger in the Night than in the Day, I cannot tell; but that they are so, is confirm'd by Experience: For which Reason <HI>Domingo</HI> would by no Means let me attempt to go down till Morning, when the Sun was but just risen, enough to dry up the Dew from the Surperficies of the Rocks: And so we pitch'd on the broadest and most convenient Place for us to make our Abode in till the next Morn∣ing; and then <HI>Domingo,</HI> and two more, went down, and brought a Stick of Fire, and some of the Wreck Wood, with some Pompion and Fish; and there we took up our Lodging that Night: And in the Morning, with much Difficulty, as well as Hazard, we got down, and came to the old Place again.</P>
<P>Soon after, <HI>Domingo,</HI> having rested and re∣freshed himself with a little Fish and Pompion, took his Leave of me, and, with some of the Blacks, went up to Town to get the Boat down for me, and bid me expect him, if the Weather was good, the Evening following, or the Day
<PB N="239" REF="246"/>
after; but yet if it should happen so that he tarried longer, not to be out of Hopes, or im∣pute it in the least to his Neglect; for he assured me, no Endeavour or Diligence of his should be wanting: This, he said, he could boldly aver for his own Part, and believed, that no one on the Island, but would contribute their Assistance to it, to the utmost of their Power.</P>
<P>I thanked him, and them all, and told him, I had no Reason in the least to doubt what he said, and bid him give my humble Service to his <HI>Singore Pay</HI> (i. e. his Father) to the <HI>Singore Pa∣dre,</HI> and <HI>Singore Governardo,</HI> and to all the <HI>Sin∣gores</HI> in general, not forgetting <HI>Singore Carolos:</HI> He said, he would; so away they went.</P>
<P><HI>Manuel,</HI> whom I told you of before, had set his Resolution, never more to part with me, un∣less I brought him to his Home and Family, nor then neither, unless I would: The Time that I was gone, he had got all my Rags and Cloaths, and had washed them; as also every Rag of the Sails that was as broad as my Hand, and had them spread to dry; and as they dried, he folded them up, and laid them in a Hole in the Rock, where neither the Sea, Dust, nor Dew, could come to annoy them; and told me, That he was not in any great Hopes that I should have been able to have got up; but was in great Fear that any Disaster should happen to me, by reason the Rocks were so difficult to climb up, as well as dangerous, which he had shunned, by his swim∣ming; yet he heard so much from those that passed that Way, that he had little Hopes that I could; but wished heartily, that I might, and had washed, and was a drying all my Things, in order to bring them up after me, as soon as he heard that I was safe up.</P>

I thanked him; He said, I owed him no Thanks; that it was but his bare Duty, and as such, he did it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It was almost calm, and as the Sun drew to the Meridian, it fell quite calm, contrary to what it is on the Weather Side, as well South-East, and North-West Sides of the Island, where the nigher the Sun approaches the Meridian, the fresher the Gale, blows; but on the South-West Side, the contrary; though sometimes, especially if it be calm in the Offing, even a faint Trade, between the Hours of 10 M. and 3 P. M. you shall have a fine Sea Breeze at South-West; and such a Breeze would have been very refreshing to me now.</P>
<P>The Sun, as I said, was extreme hot, darting his Rays against the solid Rocks, which reflected upon us an inconceivable Heat, so that by its stronger Light or Fire, it not only dimm'd, but had like to have quite extinguished the weak Lamp of my Life.</P>
<P>For it so inflamed my Blood, that, with other Causes concurring, such as the Badness of Food for some Time past, and drinking no Liquor, but that fiery Spirit, Rum; my great Fatigues, Colds, Heats, &amp;c. and now my feeding altogether, and of a sudden, on watry Food, such as Pompion, Water-Melon, Bananas, &amp;c. and instead of Rum, drinking cold Rock Water; with my labouring and Frights striving to scramble up the Rocks; the former setting, as it were, my Blood all on Fire, the other chilling, and, as it were, stag∣nating it; of both which, I had a sensible Percep∣tion.</P>
<P>All these together, I say, threw me into such an Illness, that it was the Wonder of every one, and the great Mercy of the Almighty, that I re∣covered from it.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="250"/>
I found myself very much out of Order, but was afraid either to conceit myself so, or own it to any-body else: They all saw an Alteration, and asked me, Whether I found myself ill or no? I told them, I was indifferent, but thought it was the Heat of the Sun that made me a little faintish; they said, They believed I was not a little, but a great deal ill; for, says <HI>Manuel,</HI> your Face is as red, as the very Fire, and I will let you see it yourself, and away he goes, and fetches me some clear Sea Water in a Calabash, and held it for me to behold my Face in, which I could almost as well see, as in an ordinary Look∣ing-Glass, and I was really surprized to see myself; it was just as if I had got a Surfeit, or like one when the Small-Pox first comes out; and upon examining, I found, that all my Body was the same.</P>
<P>My Head was ready to split, and I thought my Eyes would have started out, and at last I was forc'd to bind something about my Head; and I could hear them talk one to another, that I had an exceeding high and strong Fever; some al∣ready concluding I should die, others hoping not, all wishing that I was up at Town; and <HI>Manuel</HI> crying, and cursing his Consorts, laying all the blame on them, by whose base Neglect, he said, came my Misfortunes, and the Grief which occa∣sion'd my present Illness, &amp;c.</P>
<P>My Distemper increas'd so, that I was not able to sit up, but was forc'd to lie along on the Rock on Fieces of Sails, &amp;c. with which they made a Bed for me as well as they could; and in the Evening, seeing me so bad, they all left me but three, of which <HI>Manuel</HI> was one; who would have had the other two have gone up also, telling them they could do me no good now, and that he alone was sufficient to look after me, and only
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
wanted them to come down, one or two, every Day, to bring down Necessaries, and daily give an Account at Town how I was; but they all said, No, they would always leave two with him, as well for Company, as to assist him, or to send away to Town upon any extraordinary Occasion; so away they went.</P>
<P>I was very ill the whole Night, and a great Part of it was delirious, and so continued the Day following; in the Evening, <HI>Domingo,</HI> and some more, came down, and was very sorrowful to see me in such a Condition; most of the Afternoon I was pretty sensible, and perceived several of the Blacks weep, and especially <HI>Manuel</HI> and <HI>Domingo,</HI> who often wished, that I had not fallen sick be∣fore I got to Town, when they should have been better able to take care of me, and keep me from the Cold.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> told me, That <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> was still ill, but much better than I, and was mighty sorry when the Men that came up last Night, brought Word of my Illness; but did not believe that I had been so bad, as he, to his great Grief, found that I was; and that <HI>Singore Carolos,</HI> he hoped, would, in a little Time, be better; and as soon as ever he was able, would be down to look after me; and that the Governor and Priest, as likewise all the People in general, sent Word to me by him, That they were all ready to serve me, and that I should not want for any thing that the Island afforded; but more especially his Father <HI>Singore Anthonia Gums,</HI> who would have come down before now, but that he is a heavy old Man; and so would the Governor, but that (as I had heard before) he was sick, and still was ia a weak Condition; and the Priest being a fat, heavy, corpulent Man, he could not climb up
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
or down the Rocks, as he believed, so well as I.</P>
<P>About the Time that the Goats go to their Dens, there came down a great many Stones and much Dust where we all were, without doing any con∣siderable Hurt to any of us, though there hap∣pen'd several Stones to fall pretty nigh me, and a good deal of Earth and Dust upon me; one large Stone fell, I believe, within half a Yard of my Head, which frighted them more than me, for my Sickness was so extreme, that I was but very little affected with any Apprehension of Danger; but <HI>Domingo</HI> and <HI>Manuel</HI> could not be easy till they mov'd me to a Place, which tho' to them seem'd less dangerous, yet it was much more in∣convenient, there hardly being Room for me to extend myself, and the least Turn would have rowled me of; which, although the Fall would not have been very great, as not being above four or five Foot above the Beech, yet it being all stony, it was not only possible, but also very probable, that I might be hurt; and at high Water, there was about a Foot and a half, or two Foot Water, especially at Spring Tides, and moderate Weather, the Sea did but little more than come up to the Rock; but my good Atten∣dants took Care enough of me, two of them keeping by me all Night, and if I offer'd but to turn, they would be ready, and ask me if I had a mind to turn, which if I said I had, they would turn me with as much Tenderness, as a Mother could do her tender Babe; and so they tended me by turns till they thought the Goats were all got out from their Dens, and that the Dan∣ger of the Stones tumbling down was over; and then they remov'd me where I had something more Room, and also contriv'd a Sort of an Auning or Shade for me from the Sun; after which, <HI>Do∣mingo</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
giving <HI>Manuel</HI> Charge to tend me well, (as also to remove me before the Sun got below the Tops of the Mountains, and place me where I had been last Night, for fear of the Goats tum∣bling the Stones down on me, and in the Morn∣ing to move me again) he went away to Town; at whose Arrival, and News, they were very sorry; and Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> told them, That I should be much better, if I lay better; and <HI>Domingo</HI> having a Cotton Hammock, which his Father had of the Pirates when they were at this Island, he ask'd Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> whether that would be of any Service to me, who told him it would, and bid him carry it down, and shew'd him how to hang it.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> came down again that Night, and his Brother <HI>Basil,</HI> with some other of the Blacks, and brought with them some Milk, Pompion, &amp;c. and the Hammock, which had been fix'd ready for hanging up, at Town, by Mr. <HI>Franklin;</HI> and they found Means to hang it up at the Side of the Rock by some Nobs that stuck out, and just high enough, that the Sea could not slow up to me; tho' when it blew hard, that the Sea rowl'd in, and beat in against the Rocks, the Spray would oftentimes fall into my Hammock, and make me as wet as if I had been dipped in the Sea.</P>
<P>They catch'd two Quails, which they had knock'd down in the Way as they came along, and some others brought down a couple of Fowls; neither wanted I any thing all the Time I was there, nor after that I could be got upon the Island; and <HI>Manuel</HI> constantly tended me Night and Day with a Tenderness that is not common; besides it was very seldom, but what there was some of the Inhabitants down with him.</P>
<P>I was pretty much delirious, insomuch, that sometimes, as they have since told me, they were
<PB N="245" REF="254"/>
to stand in the Water, when it was full Sea, to keep me in my Hammock, their Tenderness not permitting them to tye me down; neither would they, during the whole Time of my Illness, tell me any Thing I did, or what I said in my rav∣ing Fits, because, as they afterwards told me, they would not discourage me.</P>
<P>I had a tolerable Bed to lie on, made up of Pieces of Sails doubled, and laid in the Ham∣mock, and my Bed-tick smooth over that; but they had taken all the Feathers out and flung them away, because they were wet; on that was spread a Cotton Cloth, and another Cotton Cloth was laid over me, and on that my Rug, which they had also saved; so that considering where I was, I may say I was extraordinarily accommo∣dated.</P>
<P>A high burning continual Fever held me near about a Month; after which I was less delirious, but extreme weak, not being able so much as to turn myself; and in the Spring Tides I used to be often wet with the Spray of the Sea dashing against the Rock where I hung, and then in the Morning they would take me out of my Ham∣mock, and spread the Things and dry them; and during the Time that I was out of the Hammock, one or another used to lay my Head in their Laps, or sometimes set me on their Laps leaning against their Breast, or any Way which I found most easy; and I believe I was troublesome enough to them.</P>
<P>I shall trouble the Readers with one Instance of the Strength of my Delirium: One Night, when the Water was down, so that the Beach was dry, I had a Notion came into my Head that I could very easily go up the Rocks, and thought, in my Imagination, that I had seen a Way never disco∣ver'd by the Natives, which I thought I could
<PB N="246" REF="255"/>
very easily get up; and looking about me, de∣signing to get away without any Body's discover∣ing me, I pleas'd myself to think how I should surprize all the Town to see me there, who would be apt to think I had some supernatural Help. I thought I was so strong, that I was able almost to do any Thing; and every one being sitting about the Fire on the Top of the Rock, which I could see as I lay in the Hammock, I got out without making any Noise, and was going along as easy as I could, that I might not be discover'd, when <HI>Manuel</HI> spying me, came running to me, and ask'd me, Where I was going? I told him, I was going to Town. He said, He wish'd with all his Heart I was able. I told him, I was able enough. He said, No; and begg'd me to go with him back to the Hammock. No, I told him, I would go to Town. He said, That when I was well, I could not get up; and how could I pre∣tend to it now I was ill? I told him, I was as well as ever I was in my Life, and as strong, (and in∣deed so I thought I was) and was resolv'd to be up at Town before Day-light. He desir'd me to go to my Hammock, and stay till Day-light, and then I should see to walk better. I told him, I had lain so long in the Hammock, that I was tired of it. Then said he, Come and sit down by the Fire with us till Day, and we will all go toge∣ther. For, said he, you know that not one of the Islanders will venture to go up the Rocks in the Night. Pish, said I, I know a Way that ne'er a one on the Island knows. Pray, says he, let me persuade you either to go to your Hammock, or come and sit down by the Fire with us. I said, No; I was strong and well enough, and perfectly knew every Step of the Way. How can that be, said he, and you never was up that, nor any other Way on this Island, in your Life? No Matter for
<PB N="247" REF="256"/>
that, said I, I have been shewn the Way, and have seen, that if I was to go it a thousand Times, or oft<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, I could not know it better than I now do; and therefore am resolv'd to go now, while I have the Knowledge of it so fresh in my Mind, lest God Almighty, who has shew'd it me, may perhaps take away my Knowledge To-mor∣row; And, said I, it signifies nothing your talk∣ing, I will go to Town now, while I can, and will not any longer tarry here. Well, said he, if you are resolv'd to go, I will go with you, and I will put a Cotten Cloth about you, that you may not catch cold (for I was all this Time standing stark naked). Well do, said I, and bring a Stick for me, to have in my Hand to keep off the Dogs when we come into Town, for I reckon we shall be there a good while before Day. Ay, said he, and it will help you to walk. No, said I, the Way that I shall lead you, you may walk it very easily without a Stick; but I would not have you shew it to any body, that they may admire how we got up, and the more for coming up in the Night.</P>
<P>He said, He would not; and brought a Cot∣ten Cloth out of the Hammock, and borrow'd a Stick of one of the Blacks who was sitting at the Fire, telling them where I was going, and what I said. Some of them said, I was light-headed; others, That God was a great Friend to white People, and out of Compassion to me, had per∣haps sent his Angel to shew me, in a Vision, the Way. Ay, said another, but there is no such easy Way from hence up; nay, nor any where on the Island from the Sea-side, as what he talks of. Well, but, said another, God can do all Things; may be he hath sent his Angel to make the Way so easy for him; and a great deal more such
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
innocent foolish Talk, which I heard of after∣wards.</P>
<P><HI>Manuel</HI> soon return'd, and brought me a Stick as I had desir'd him, and a Cloth, which he ty'd about me after the Negro Fashion, and away we trudg'd; I being, I thought, as strong and hear∣ty as ever I was in my Life: But we had not walk'd above a Stones-cast or two, before my Delirium began to leave me, and with that all my imaginary Strength, so that I was unable to help myself; and <HI>Manuel</HI> had enough to do to set me on my Legs again, and began to persuade me to go back with him to the Fire, or to lie down in the Hammock again; but I would not hear any Thing that Way, but bid him go his way to his Consorts, for that I could find the Way to Town without any body's Assistance, and shoved him from me; who letting me go, I dropp'd down thro' extreme Weakness.</P>
<P>Hereupon he call'd to his Consorts at the Fire, who presently came, and among them carry'd me to the Hammock, where I lay quiet enough.</P>
<P>I believe this was the last strong raving Fit I had, being for the most Part sensible after that; and then I had been laid up better than a Month, and was very weak.</P>
<P>I lay three Days and Nights, they told me, without opening either my Eyes or Mouth, only when they forc'd it open with a Knife, &amp;c. to pour Broth or Milk down my Throat, and never stirr'd; so that they very often thought I had been dead, till they felt my Heart beat, which they would every now and then.</P>
<P>When I awaked from this Lethargy, I was just, I thought, as though I had risen out of a sweet Sleep, not thinking, nor they telling me then, it had been a Nap of three Days.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="258"/>
It was a little before that, that Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> being something recover'd, came down to see me; but was gone before I awaked out of that long Sleep, and strictly enjoin'd them, before he went, to be sure to take Care of me, while any Life remain'd in me; but as soon as ever they perceiv'd me dead, to send directly to him, and he would, if able, come down. He was of Opi∣nion, That I should never recover; but wish'd that he had seen and spoke to me before I was so bad, that he might have known where to write to my Friends, that they might have the Satisfacti∣on to know when, where, and how I died; he said he could not stay with me, not being well re∣cover'd, and found it prejudicial to him to lie open, expos'd to the Dew, and therefore went up again.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> also came down often, and most of the Time that I was ill, every Night almost, there were two, or three, or more Companions with <HI>Manuel.</HI></P>
<P>I continu'd still very weak, but sensible, and sweat so every Night, that in the Morning you might have wrung all the Cloaths about me, and yet remain'd so cold and clammy, that I could not be warm all Night, do what they could to cover me: The Blacks said, This extreme Sweating was a good Sign, and that my Distemper was going away in those Sweats.</P>
<P>When I had lain about six Weeks in that Con∣dition, it pleas'd God it held calm for two or three Days together, and <HI>Carolos</HI> and <HI>Domingo,</HI> with three others, brought the Boat down; but about an Hour, as near as I could guess, before the Boat came, a terrible Accident happen'd, which gives me still the greatest Concern; for a great Piece of Rock tumbled down, right over where my Hammock hung; and it being low Water,
<PB N="250" REF="259"/>
and a fine Day, poor <HI>Manuel</HI> was sitting on the Beach, a little Way off from me, on whom seve∣ral of the great Stones fell, and made a woful Spectacle of him, by smashing him as it were al∣most to a Mummy; my Hammock hanging close to the Side of the Rock, the Piece of Rock, and Stones, which came tumbling after it, rowl'd off, clear of my Hammock, excepting some few, which scratched and rased the Skin in several Places, and gave me a slight Contusion in my left Arm, a little Cut on my left Thigh, and bruis'd the out∣side of my left Ankle, which was the worst, and pain'd me above two Months after.</P>
<P>It happen'd luckily that there was not any Bo∣dy else there at that Time; for there had been four with <HI>Manuel</HI> the preceding Night; but they seeing the Day before had been calm, and that the Morning promis'd the same for the ensuing Day, two of them went up to Town at Break of Day, to remind my Friends to get down the Boat, and the other two went a fishing.</P>
<P>When the Boat came to the Beach, poor <HI>Ma∣nuel</HI> was the first Spectacle they saw; and looking farther about, they saw me lying down on the Beach with my Hammock almost cover'd with Dust, and in so weak a Condition, that I was not able to move, and almost unable to speak.</P>
<P>The first that came to me, ask'd me, when he saw my Eyes open, for till then, he said, he thought I had been dead, in a very sharp Tone, How came <HI>Manuel</HI> to be kill'd so?</P>
<P>I answer'd, as well as I was able, That I could not tell; and by that Time Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> and the rest came up to me; and when he saw that I was alive, and spoke, he said, He was very glad; and ask'd me, How long <HI>Manuel</HI> had been dead? I told him, I did not know of his Death; but I be∣liev'd it was about an Hour since I heard the Rocks
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
fall, which beat down my Hammock, and I be∣liev'd had hurt me a little.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> said, What signifies asking him Que∣stions? Let us get him down to the Boat before any more falls, and thank God he has so narrowly escap'd; so away they took me four of them, and carry'd me down to the Boat, and put what they thought worth carrying away, into it; and away we went, and got up to <HI>Fuurno</HI> about two Hours before Sun-set, where they brought me ashore, and laid me in a little Cave, upon a Bed which they made me of dry'd Grass which they gather'd, and cover'd me with the Rug and Cloaths they brought up in the Boat; and kindled a Fire at the Mouth of the Cave.</P>
<P>They told me, That they did not, when they tame away, design to have come back to <HI>Fuurno</HI> till the next Morning; nor, they believ'd, had not, if it had not been for that unlucky Disaster of the Rocks falling and killing <HI>Manuel,</HI> and hurting me, and therefore expected no Horses down for me till Morning; at which Time <HI>Domingo</HI> said, his Brother would be down with a Horse from his Father, and hoped I would do their Father the Honour to lodge with him.</P>
<P>I can't tell whether it was with the Joy of my Deliverance from that dismal Place, or how; but I found myself more hearty, and could speak so as to be intelligible without straining, or making me so faint as it used to do for some Time past.</P>
<P>I told <HI>Domingo,</HI> That it could be no Honour; and that I should give abundance of Trouble to whosoever entertain'd me; and I thought I ow'd more Obligations to him than to any one on the Island, and therefore, since he was so good as to desire it, I would give him that Trouble and Charge.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="261"/>
He told me, The Governor, he believ'd, would send a Horse for me also; but desir'd that I would ride up on his Father's Horse, since I had pro∣mis'd him to take up my abode with him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> told <HI>Domingo,</HI> That since I had given my Word to lodge with his Father, he need say no more about it, for that it was the Property of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, sooner to die than to go from it.</P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> said, He believ'd it; and went away directly to carry up the joyful News, as he call'd it, of my safe Arrival at the <HI>Fuurno.</HI> Next Morning betimes he return'd, with several of the Blacks, and his Brother, who brought a Horse for me: The Governor also sent a Man and Horse for me.</P>
<P>My Fever had in a Manner left me; but I was so weak, that when I was set on my Feet, I could not stand a Moment without being supported; and Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> said, That the Governor's Horse was the quietest, as well as securest to carry me, and the Saddle was the deepest, and easiest for me to sit upon, and so propos'd that I should ride up on that, which <HI>Domingo,</HI> with some Reluctancy, for fear the Governor should take it as an Obliga∣tion for me to live with him, comply'd with, upon my repeated Promise that I would take up my Abode at his Father's; and after they had well girted and secur'd the Saddle, they set me on the Governor's Horse; and, for the greater Security, tied my Feet under the Horse's Belly with a Cot∣ten Sash, much as they do a Criminal; the Pum∣mel of the Saddle afore being as high almost as the Pitt of my Stomach, and it was as high be∣hind; and they fasten'd me so, that if I had been dead, or asleep, I could not fall: They then put the Horse in the Path, and turn'd him loose, and bid me not fear, for he knew his Way home;
<PB N="253" REF="262"/>
and away went the Horse afore a good Pace, but did not trot; and never stay'd till he came to the Governor's Hut Door, who, with several of his Relations, and a good many others, was ready to receive him.</P>
<P>I was up some time before the Blacks; and the Governor welcomed me with all the Signs of Joy imaginable, and excus'd himself for not coming down to me at the <HI>Salt Point Bay,</HI> by Reason of his Illness, &amp;c. but now I was come up, he would endeavour to make Amends to me for that, &amp;c. and told me, His House, himself, his Family, his Friends, and all that the Island afforded, was at my Service, and he himself would be to me in the Room of my <HI>Manuel</HI> whom I had lost, and which he was very sorry for, since he heard, he said, he was an affectionate and faithful Servant; and order'd to unloose me, and take me down off the Horse.</P>
<P>I told him, I was extremely oblig'd to him, and all the <HI>Singores</HI> on the Island; and, if he pleas'd to hear me without being angry, I would give him my Reasons, why I could not possibly take up my Abode with him, without incurring the Displeasure of <HI>Singore Padre</HI> to both himself and me, and what the Consequence of that might be, I believ'd him to be a better Judge than myself; which was, that <HI>Singore Padre</HI> was the first that offer'd me his House, as he was the second: Now, continu'd I, if I should lodge at the <HI>Padre</HI>'s House, I suppose you would have taken it ill of me, and I am inform'd, that if I lodge at your House, he will do both you and me all the Preju∣dice that lies in his Power.</P>
<P>Ay, said he, I know that he loves me but from the Teeth outwards; I have been upon my Guard a great while; I know he is spiteful and malici∣ous enough, but I do not value him tho' he's a
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
<HI>Padre;</HI> but it may be, that out of Malice he may, some Way or other, privately do you a Prejudice, but openly he shall not; and tho' for your Reasons given, I could agree to your living with any one else on the Island, yet I never shall agree to your Lodging at the <HI>Padre</HI>'s. I know, said he, his Eagerness to have you live with him, is not out of Respect to Strangers, but for what he can get from you.</P>
<P>Nay, said I, he can expect nothing from me, I having been robb'd of every Thing before I came here.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, said he, you have Cloaths, and he will be glad to get some of them.</P>
<P>Well, says I, if you will be contented for me to live at another House, I will give you my Word I will not live at the Priest's.</P>
<P>He said, So it were with one that he thought would take Care of me, he would.</P>
<P>I reply'd, That to avoid giving any Offence, or, at least, as little as I could, to any Party, I thought it best to go to <HI>Singore Antonio Gumms.</HI></P>
<P>He said, I did very prudently, as we Whites alway<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did; and he liked <HI>Singore Antonio</HI> very well, he being a good Man, and having a better House by far to entertain me in, than his; but hoped, when I was able to walk abroad, that I would not be a Stranger to his House.</P>
<P>I told him, I should not: At which he seem'd satisfy'd.</P>
<P>By this Time the People who follow'd me came up; and tho' the Governor was sway'd so with the Reasons that I gave him, so as to be satisfy'd with my going to live at <HI>Singore Antonio Gumms,</HI> yet some of his Friends present were not; and began to say one to another, that this was owing to <HI>Singore Carolos,</HI> and to <HI>Domingo Gumms,</HI> and that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> ought to be chastiz'd for his
<PB N="255" REF="264"/>
Insolence; who being but a Stranger, should take that Liberty to perswade the Captain not to live with the <HI>Singore Governador.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Domingo</HI> over-hearing them, said, It was false, to say that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> had any Hand in per∣swading <HI>Singore Capiteen</HI> to live at his Father's; it was he himself that did it; and his Father was as well able to accommodate <HI>Singore Capiteen,</HI> as <HI>Sin∣gore Governador</HI> was; and his Father was <HI>Gover∣nador</HI> when <HI>Singore Luonell Gonsalvo</HI> (that was the present Governor's Name) was but a Boy, and might, if he pleas'd, have been Governor now, but that he was old, and would not take the Trouble upon him; and that Man that should say that <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> had a Hand in perswading the <HI>Capiteen,</HI> he had a <HI>Faukade</HI> ready for him; and immediately drew out a long sharp-pointed Knife.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> told them, That he did not per∣swade me either to one House, or another; but that I had promis'd, at the repeated Request of <HI>Domingo,</HI> to go to his Father's, lest I should dis∣oblige either the Governor or the <HI>Padre.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding this Excuse, one of them up with his Stick to strike at Mr. <HI>Franklin;</HI> but <HI>Do∣mingo</HI> gave him such a Rap on the Head with his Stick, that he lay'd him down as quiet as if he had been in his last Sleep, for some Minutes; which put them all into such a Ferment, that the Gover∣nor, fearing it might be of no good Consequence to me, got me into his House; leaving Orders to apprehend and make a Prisoner of him, who first lifted his Stick to strike Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> as being the first Breaker of the Peace; And this, indeed, was the most prudent Way he could have acted, to prevent a Commotion among them; and this intirely put a Stop to their forming Parties, which they were going to do.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="265"/>
After I was brought into the House, the Go∣vernor shew'd me the Bed which he had made up for me, in hopes that I would have remain'd with him; but he was, as he told me before, satisfied (to prevent giving Offence) at my living with <HI>Singore Antonio,</HI> whom all the Island respected; but since I was alighted, he would have me stay at his House till the Cool of the Evening, and then he would send me down to <HI>Singore Antonio</HI>'s; so I was lay'd on the Bed, which indeed was ex∣traordinary, considering the People and Country; for there were four Posts drove into the Floor, in the Form of a long Square, and four Pieces of Wood tied to them with Banana Cords, which form'd the Head, Feet, and Sides of the Bed, and three or four Sticks laid across, and tied at each End to the two Pieces that made the Sides of the Bed; over that was lay'd a Hurdle made of large Cane Reed, being the same Sort which is brought out of <HI>Portugal,</HI> &amp;c. over the Cane Hurdle was good Store of dry'd Banana. Leaves, laid after the same Manner as the poorer Sort of the Native <HI>Irish</HI> do their Beds of Straw; over the Banana Leaves was laid a Banana Mat, and on that two white Cotten Cloths as Sheets, with a thick blue-and-white Cotten Cloth over all, as a Rug or Quilt.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in describing this Bed, because Beds are not usual there, they all lying on the Ground, and, as he told me, it was of his Brother's Contrivance, who had liv'd some Time at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and had been once at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where he saw those Sort of Beds there, used by the <HI>Branca's</HI> (i. e. <HI>Portuguese)</HI> inhabiting there; and said, He was sure there was ne'er ano∣ther Bed upon the Island of that Sort, except one that his Brother made for <HI>Singore Padre;</HI> and he would keep it always ready for me, against I was
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
recover'd, in hopes I would pass a Night now and then with him; which I said I would, so it gave no Offence. He said, He would beg that Favour of <HI>Singore Antonio,</HI> who he was sure would not deny him.</P>
<P>The Prisoner who had begun the Fray, was bound Hand and Foot, and put in the Governor's House, and so remain'd till next Day; and upon all Parties becoming Friends again, he was set free.</P>
<P>I had a Fowl boil'd for me, and I supp'd a little of the Broth; and in the Cool of the Even∣ing I was carry'd down in my Hammock, by the Inhabitants on their Shoulders, it being fix'd on a Pole by Mr. <HI>Franklin.</HI> I was joyfully receiv'd by <HI>Singore Antonio,</HI> who told me, Since I had been so kind to come to live with him, notwith∣standing I had been so importun'd by the Priest and Governor, he reckon'd himself and all his Family so highly obligated to me, that all that they could do for me was much too little. And, indeed, he made it appear that what he said was sincere; for during the whole Time that I continu'd ill and weak, which was about six Weeks more, the good old Man would trust neither his Wife, who was also a good tender and motherly old Woman, nor any of his Children, nor even <HI>Domingo,</HI> either to make up my Bed, which was done every Night, or to lift me out while it was made, or to serve me with my Victuals; but did all himself; often telling me, that it was the greatest Honour he ever had in his Life, to be my Servitor.</P>
<P>My Bed was of the same Fashion of that which I describ'd before at the Governor's; for the old Man, as soon as he had any Assurance of my coming to his House, went to the Priest's, to see how his Bed was made, and by that Pattern fix'd
<PB N="258" REF="267"/>
one for me, after the <HI>Branca's</HI> Fashion, as they call'd it.</P>
<P>During the Time of my Illness, every Day some or other of the Inhabitants would come to see how I did; but never hardly any of them came without bringing something for me, either a Fowl, some Banana's, Indian Corn, and Banana Cakes, Pompion, Water-Melons, &amp;c. according as they had; but <HI>Singore Antonio</HI> very seldom let them come into the House, excepting some few of the better Sort, for fear of disturbing me, but receiv'd their Offering at the Door, and there answer'd them how I did, and return'd them Thanks for their Presents on my Behalf.</P>
<P>The Priest paid me a Visit the next Day after I came up; and the Governor used to come and see me almost every Day; and every two or three Days sent me, sometimes a Quarter, some∣times a Side, and sometimes a whole Carcass of a wild Goat.</P>
<P>After I began to gather Strength, that I could dress myself and sit up, they used to be admitted in; for then <HI>Singore Antonio</HI> thought, he said, that Company might divert me, and do me good.</P>
<P>When I came to be able to eat pretty well, and could take a Walk out in the Air, which was about two Months after I came up to Town, I told <HI>Singore Antonio,</HI> that I began to be pretty well, I thank'd God, and all the good People of the Island, and in a particular Manner himself, and <HI>Domingo,</HI> who, under God, was a great In∣strument of saving my Life; and that now my Stomach was pretty strong, I would endeavour to eat as they did, <HI>viz.</HI> Pompion, Feshoon, parch'd Indian Corn, &amp;c. and that I reckon'd I had de∣stroy'd his Stock of Fowls already. (which was the largest Stock that any four on the Island had
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
besides himself). He said, I had not destroy'd his Stock, for they were not his Fowls that I eat, but my own. I told him, It was his Goodness to make them so. He said, No; they were my own properly, and were given to me by the <HI>Singores,</HI> who came daily to see me in the Time of my Sickness: And, says he, How many Fowls do you think you have yet left alive? I told him, I could not tell; neither did I know that I had any. Why, said he, you have more Fowls, I be∣lieve, than I; and calling his <HI>Singora Muritia,</HI> (which was his Wife's Name) he ask'd her, How many Fowls the Captain had left alive? who told him fifty-one, or fifty-two. I was in amaze at it, and said, I was indebted to all the <HI>Singores</HI> of the Island more than ever I should be able to pay.</P>
<P>He smiled, and said, That to help any one that was in Need, but more especially a Stranger, was a Duty incumbent on every one; and that if any of them should ever happen to be in the like Circumstances in my Country, it would be then a Duty in me to do the same for them; and he did not doubt but I should have been of that Opi∣nion, if I had never been on this Island, and re∣ceiv'd Kindness from them.</P>
<P>After I was able to walk Abroad, I had every Day Invitations, till I had visited all the Inhabi∣tants Houses or Huts on the Island, except the <HI>Fiteseers (i. e.</HI> Witches) Houses; against which, my Landlord, as also the Governor, and the Priest, gave me a Caution, neither to eat, nor drink, nor have any Intimacy or Acquaintance with them, but as little as I could.</P>
<P>The first Visit I paid (for which I ask'd the Governor's Leave, and praying him not to be offended at it, which he readily granted, and pro∣mis'd not in the least) was to the Priest, who took
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
it very kind, that I had done him the first Favour at my first going Abroad; the next was to the Governor; and after him to <HI>Singore George Gon∣salvo,</HI> who had formerly been a Governor; and then to the rest in order, according to their Seni∣ority, as my Landlord <HI>Antonio Gumms</HI> directed me, whose Advice in that Affair I wholly fol∣low'd.</P>
<P>I now began to be pretty strong and hearty, and used to go out with the Natives a hunting and fishing; the last I used often to be at, as being more diverting and less fatiguing.</P>
<P>I had Nails enow sav'd out of the Pieces of the Wreck, to have supply'd the Island perhaps an Age, or more, with Fishing-Hooks; for all that the Natives had sav'd and knock'd out with Stones, they brought to me, after I was come up to <HI>Singore Antonio Gumms;</HI> for the Priest had told them, That if they kept any thing that they had sav'd, of what Kind soever, from me, God would certainly take Vengeance of them, and they would never thrive, nor prosper in any thing that they undertook; so that I had every Bit of Iron which they had hazardously and painfully sav'd, and brought up; as also every Piece of Board, or any thing else; which was all of Service to me, as in the Sequel of this Story you shall hear.</P>
<P>Our Manner of Fishing was thus: We used to go from Town before Day, so as to get down to the Sea-side before the Sun was very high, to avoid his scorching Heat in our Journey down the Rocks, and took with us a Calabash or two of Water, according as our Company was, more or less, also some Pompion, Banana's, &amp;c. for Food. Our fishing Utensils were long Canes for fishing Rods, and Cotten Lines, which they made and twisted so well, that I think they exceeded any of our Hemp or Flax Lines made in <HI>England,</HI> both
<PB N="261" REF="270"/>
for Strength and Durableness; we made use of Stones, for want of Lead, to sink our Lines, and did well enough, because in most Places where we fish'd on the Rocks, there was little or no Tide run.</P>
<P>Our Hooks, as I hinted before, were made by the old bungling Smith, of old Nails; though I generally made my own Hooks, and also for the Family, whereof I now was a Member; for I could borrow a Hammer and a File of the old Farrier, as they call'd him, whenever I would, and I think my Hooks far exceeded his; but a bended sharp-pointed Nail, without any other Prepara∣tion, would have been sufficient; for the Fish in those Parts were so voracious, that if you were not very watchful, and quick, they would swal∣low the Hook down into their Belly, which they seldom let them do, endeavouring always to hook them in the Mouth, to prevent their cutting their Lines with their Teeth, as almost all the Fish there∣abouts have large and sharp Teeth, rather like ravenous Land Animals, than our Fish on the Coast of <HI>England;</HI> and when at any Time they hale a Fish up that hath swallow'd the Hook, if it should chance to cut the Line and escape, they would blame the Fisherman, and impute it to his want of Skill, or Carelessness, or both.</P>
<P>Our Bait was generally Crabs, which they were very dexterous at catching; and when we could not catch Crabs, we us'd to take Limpits, or any other Shell-Fish we could get upon the Rocks; and when we had caught a Fish, we generally made Bait of that; though Crabs was the best and surest Bait we could use.</P>
<P>They always brought Wood down with them for Firing, which they gather'd as they went along, to boil our Fish, and roast our Pompion, &amp;c. with, and used to be out sometimes three,
<PB N="262" REF="271"/>
four, five, or six Days, according as we caught Fish, or our Inclinations led us.</P>
<P>They gather'd Salt on the Rocks, which was made by the Heat of the Sun, of the Sea-Water, lying in the Holes of the Rocks, being either cast up in the Hollows of the Rocks by the Spray of the Sea beating up against them when it blew; or when it was a clear Sun-shine Day, at high Water the Sea would fill some Hollows of the Rocks; and after the Sea was fallen, before it came up again, it would all, if the Hole was shallow, be a dry Salt; but if deep, then the Salt would lie at the Bottom; or, if too deep, those Hollows that the Sea flow'd up to, could not, in so short Time, kern any Salt; but those Hollows or Holes which were above the flowing of the Sea, and fill'd with Water, I have known it all converted to Salt, or rather all the Water ex∣hal'd by the Sun, and only the Salt left in the Hole; and have observ'd it two Foot thick of Salt, and to the Quantity of about▪ four Bushels, or more, in a Hole which did not exceed five or six Yards square.</P>
<P>I am apt to think, that there is a certain Qua∣lity in some Rocks that helps, and in others, that hinders the Salt's kerning; for in some I have seen Water that has stood so long, that it has been all vapour'd away, leaving behind only a Sediment as muddy Water does, but very salt, and sometimes a thin Crust lying on the Sediment, something resembling the Crust, or Cream that lies on the Top of the Water, when you wash or purify Tartar, and commonly call'd <HI>Cream of Tartar,</HI> but extreme salt and strong, even to a Corosiveness; whereas other Rocks shall yield one third or one fourth Part of Salt, in Proportion to the Quantity of Water contain'd in those Hollows.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="272"/>
The Natives us'd to get their Salt in a Readi∣ness first, as much as they thought sufficient for that Day's Use, and then all Hands went to fish∣ing; and in the Evening they us'd to gut, split, and salt what they caught, and let them lie in the Salt in Heaps all Night; and in the Morning, after the Sun was up, they spread them in the Sun to dry, turning them as occasion requir'd; and when they were hungry, they dress'd some Fish and Pompion, which we never wanted whenever I happen'd to be with them; but if not, they very seldom carry'd any, contenting themselves with a little boil'd or broil'd Fish while abroad, and that seldom oftner than once, towards Night, after they had done fishing.</P>
<P>At those Fishing-places which were easy of Ac∣cess, and often frequented by them, they used to leave an Earthen Pot, which was free for any to use who came a fishing, and that for the Sake of the Fish-Broth, which they esteem much beyond any Broth made of Flesh.</P>
<P>At Night they repose themselves in the Hollow of the Rocks; being always careful not to lie expos'd to the falling of the Night-Dew; and they would gather dry Grass, &amp;c. and bring it down to lie on.</P>
<P>When we had caught Fish enough, or was tir'd of our Sport, and had a Mind to go to Town, they would send one up for an Ass, to come as far as it could, and the rest would bring the Fish up at their Backs to the Place where the Ass was, which they loaded with it up to Town; and they would always oblige me to ride down as far as the Beast could go, which was also brought for me to ride on up again, with the Ass that was to carry the Fish up.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="273"/>
When we were come up with our Fish, they us'd to send to their Friends and Relations such a Quantity as they thought fit, who us'd to do the same to them again: And this was our Manner of fishing at the Island of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>One Thing I forgot to observe, that we always, each of us, was provided with two Lines, one, which was the smaller, we had fix'd to our Fishing-Rod with a little Hook, for catching the lesser Fish, and had our large Lines and Hooks ready by us, when we saw a large Fish, which we fear'd would be too heavy for our small Hooks and Fish∣ing-Canes; and sometimes, when Fish did not bite, they would swim away to a more convenient Place, when they could not otherwise get along for the Smoothness and Steepness of the Rocks, and swim back again with a much larger Quantity of Fish, than they could carry on the dry Land, or be able to hale out of the Water without Help.</P>
<P>As to their Hunting, the Privilege of killing the wild Goats is intirely the Governor's, without whose Leave, no one dare hunt; and this was a Law made by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> when they first peo∣pled these Islands, and put a Breed of Cattle on them, to prevent the Breed from being utterly destroy'd.</P>
<P>This is the principal Privilege or Advantage the Governor hath; who also commands the Peace, and decides the little Differences which sometimes happens among them, and can, upon their not submitting to his Decision, confine them till they do, in an open Place, wall'd round like the Pounds which are in some Parts of <HI>England</HI> for imprison∣ing Cattle, when they are caught trespassing on their Neighbours Ground; but instead of a Gate, they generally lay only a Stick a-cross, and those innocent Criminals will stay there, without at∣tempting
<PB N="265" REF="274"/>
to go out, as if they had been in the securest Prison in the World; except when some of the highest spirited amongst them, happening to be overcome with Passion, and inspir'd with Revenge against those that have offended them, fly out in their Rage; who, however, as soon as caught again, are, by the Governor's Order, ty'd Hand and Foot, and a Centinel is set to watch them, and prevent their escaping again, till they agree with their Antagonist, ask the Governor's Pardon for going out of Prison without being clear'd, and remain in Prison such a Space of Time, as the Governor thinks his Crime hath de∣serv'd; which is the utmost Punishment the Go∣vernor hath Power to inflict: Nay, if one kills another, which hardly happens in an Age, all the Governor can do, is to confine him till he pacifies the Relations of the Deceas'd by the Mediation of his Friends, who are bound for the Criminal's Appearance, when a Judge comes authoriz'd from <HI>Portugal</HI> to do Justice: Which never has been yet, as far as I could learn from the Natives.</P>
<P>Sometimes when it is a small Crime, especially if it be a senior Person, the Governor confines him only in his own, or some other House; and this is reckon'd a great Favour; for to be impri∣son'd, is accounted such a great Scandal among them, that <HI>Tyburn</HI> itself is hardly so much dreaded by our Criminals in <HI>England,</HI> as those open Pri∣sons are by them. But to proceed: When the Governor has a mind to make a general Hunt, all the Islanders are summon'd, and all the Hunting-Dogs are call'd. These are between a Beagle and a Greyhound, not unlike the Mungrel Greyhounds we have in <HI>England,</HI> but shorter legg'd, and clum∣sier, with large Ears hanging down.</P>
<P>At Night, or when the Governor thinks fit to leave off hunting, they meet all together, and the

Governor parts the Venison among them as he pleases, sending what he judges proper to his own House, with all the Skins; and after he comes home, he sends a Piece to one, and a Piece to another, of those that are old, or that were not out a hunting; and the Skins he distributes among them as he thinks convenient, or as their Necessity requires, reserving the Remainder of the Skins for the Lord of the Soil.</P>
<P>They have a Report, that the King of <HI>Portu∣gal</HI> has lately given their Island to one of the Ladies of his Court: But how they came by this Information I never could tell; however, most of the He-Goat Skins were laid by for her, in a House built for that Purpose, according to their Report, ever since the <HI>Portuguese</HI> first brought them hither, and which is call'd by them <HI>Casa de Fazendo, (i. e.</HI> a Warehouse). And here they have lain so long, that many of them, as I observ'd, were almost reduc'd to Dust.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Governor hunts for his private Diversion, and then he sends only to such a Num∣ber, as he thinks fit, to accompany him; and sometimes he only sends, and does not go a hunt∣ing himself; and then, all the Venison is brought, together with the Skins, to his House, where he distributes it as he thinks fit; and there is none allow'd to keep Hunting-Dogs but whom he li∣censes, and those are call'd <HI>Caussadors,</HI> or Hunts∣men.</P>
<P>I made Enquiry from Time to Time when any Ship had touch'd on the Island, and was inform'd, that only two Ships had touch'd there in seven Years Time, the one an <HI>Englishman,</HI> who bought some Hogs of them, and the other a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who anchor'd in a Bay call'd <HI>Ferrier,</HI> and landed his Cask to fill Water, but was blown off, and left his Water-Cask behind him; as also one Black, a
<PB N="267" REF="276"/>
Native of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who swam from them, and gave an Account, that they had some more of his Countrymen on Board, whom they were carrying to <HI>Brasil</HI> for Slaves.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> and the rest inform'd me, that <HI>French</HI> Ships often us'd to touch at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and now and then a Ship came to trade there for Mules, and that the <HI>French</HI> frequently us'd to come over in their Boats to buy Fowls and Hogs; but of late Years they had discontinu'd that Practice, which made them conclude, either that no Ships had been there trading lately, or that they sup∣ply'd themselves better at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, than they could at St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon, I would fain have had the Governor to let me mend up his old Boat to go over to St.</HI> Philip<HI>'s, and offer'd to be the Carpenter myself, and also to find Nails, which, as I mention'd be∣fore, I had a great Quantity of, and likewise to make her Sails of my Jib, &amp;c. but he would not consent to it,</HI> For fear, <HI>he said,</HI> that I should come to any Mischance, by Reason the Boat was small, and the Wood very much decay'd and rotten: Be∣sides, he had heard, <HI>he said,</HI> that the Channel be∣tween St. <HI>John</HI>'s and St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, was very turbu∣lent, with great Seas, strong Currents, and violent Gales of Wind. <HI>All which was very true; yet I would freely have run the Hazard, if the Gover∣nor would have let me mend his Boat; but he still deny'd me for the Reasons above mention'd; but however told me,</HI> If I understood how to build a Vessel, I might build one new, large, and strong, there being Wood enough on the Island, and he doubt∣ed not but all the Inhabitants likewise would assist me, as much as they were capable: And, <HI>continu'd he, Singore Carolos</HI> hath often told us, that he could build any Vessel, if he had Conveniencies: Now you have Nails enough to build a large Vessel,
<PB N="268" REF="277"/>
I believe, and we have three or four Hatchets among us, and you have an Adz which was sav'd, and you need not do any of the laborious Work, but leave that for us, and you, and <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> only do that Part of the Work which our Ingenuity won't reach to. We have Wood enough, and several of us can handle a Hatchet, so as to cut down Fig-Trees, split them, and hew Boards out of them, and I will engage to provide you with Boards enough, or what other Sort of Timber you would have; and my Brother, who put up the Bed for me, who, I told you, had been at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> is a good Carpenter, tho' I won't pretend to say, like your White Carpen∣ters; but yet he can work very well, and makes almost all our Doors on the Island, and has besides made Stools for the <HI>Padre,</HI> which also several others on the Island can do; and the Chair which you have seen at the <HI>Padre</HI>'s House, shews that he is a Work∣man.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I was afraid I should not have Nails enough; <HI>(having only six or seven hundred broken and whole, besides a great many large Spikes, some Bolts, and other Iron-work, which they had sav'd. He said,</HI> He thought I was the best Judge in that Case; and that if I wanted, I could instruct the old Farrier, who was also ingenious of himself, so as to make me some Nails out of the old Iron. But, <HI>said he,</HI> you shall promise me to make one large enough to carry you over the Channel of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s safely without any Danger, and that cannot be less than twice the Bigness, at least, of my Boat; therefore, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> you shall not make her less than twice as long, and twice as broad, and twice, or more, as deep as mine was, that the great Seas, in passing over the Channel, may not be able to fill her.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>said I,</HI> to make a Boat twice the Length, Breadth, and Depth of yours, would be to make
<PB N="269" REF="278"/>
one a great many Times bigger than your Boat; <HI>but all the Geometry that I was Master of, could not convince him of that.</HI></P>
<P>So at last we concluded to build; and when we had taken a general Survey of the whole Island, to find what Tools were on it fit for our Occasion, we muster'd up three small Hatchets, a Thing like a Butcher's Cleaver, two Gimblets, one about the Size fit for a twenty-penny Nail, the other a very large Spike Gimblet, a small Pin-mall, one Claw Hammer, one like a Cobler's Hammer, and a double-headed Hammer about three Pound Weight, besides what the Smith had.</P>
<P>So after we had fully concluded upon the Mat∣ter, all the Inhabitants were summon'd to meet before the Governor's House, which accordingly they did, the Governor making a Speech to them, shewing them the Cause for which they met, and how charitable and good a Work it was to assist me, and withal, how it would redound to their Credit, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>They answer'd,</HI> That he could not be more ready to ask, than they to grant; and that they were wholly at my Call, when and where I pleas'd, and that I might always command them as my Servants and Slaves. They were very sorry, <HI>they said,</HI> to think of my leaving them; but when they consider'd how mean I liv'd here, both for Food and Raiment, as well as perhaps the Want of other Things which they might be ignorant of, they could not be so unjust as to desire me to continue in that Misery, which they were sensible I underwent while there with them: That they wish'd their Island yielded those Necessa∣ries, as well as Pleasures and Delights, which my Country did, and then perhaps they would keep me with them per Force, and think they did not wrong me; but, as it was, they could not in Reason per∣suade me, much less force me to stay with them.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="279"/>
<HI>I told them,</HI> I thank'd them kindly, and hoped I should come back one Time or other, when I had it in my Power to make them some Retaliation.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They desir'd none, my good Opinion of them was all they wish'd for, and for the Continu∣ance of that they would do any Thing that was in their Power. <HI>They said,</HI> That since they had but three Hatchets, all them that could use them, would take their Turns Day by Day, that the Hatchets might never be idle, and those that could not exercise the Hatchets, must carry down the Boards and Timber, after hew'd and a little dry'd, to the Place where I had a Design to build the Boat at.</P>
<P>All this was accordingly put in Execution, nei∣ther would they let me work at the cutting of the Trees down, or splitting, or hewing them into Boards; but bid me reserve myself against I came to build the Boat, to do that Part which they could not.</P>
<P>They had an Ingenuity peculiar to themselves in splitting the Trees after they felled them, which was thus: When they had cut down the Tree to that Length which would serve to work it for a Board, which seldom exceeded 7 or 8 Foot, though sometimes, by Chance, they run 12 or 14 Foot in Length, they would lay the Piece along, and chock it fast with Stones, that it might not roll, and then they would chop a Channel, or Gutter, as narrow as they could, and deep; after which, they would turn the Piece of Timber, and right opposite to the first, they would dig in another Gutter with their Hatchets, as deep as they could, the whole Length of the Piece, and then they would get Wedge-like Stones, that were so thick, as to fill up the Breadth of the Gutter, before it touched the Bottom; then tak∣ing great Stones, as big as they could lift, and standing close to the Piece of Timber, they would
<PB N="271" REF="280"/>
throw them down with all their Might, on their Stone Wedges, which they so often repeated, till the Piece split, which would not be long, pro∣vided they made their Gutters deep enough; and they would be sure always to split as straight as they made their Gutters. After they had split their Piece of Timber, they would hew away the flat Sides as even as they could, which, for the most Part, was pretty tolerable; and then they would hew away the other Side, 'till it was of the Size which I ordered them, which was Two Inches; for they could not be expected to hew them so straight, or even, as a Saw would cut them; nor could I ever get them to hew by a Line; for though, they said, that might be a Guide to Whites, yet, they never being used to it, it rather hindered them, than any ways helped them to cut straight.</P>
<P>After we had got a good Quantity of Boards made, there fell out a lucky Hit to help our De∣sign, which was a large Piece of Wreck, drove down close along the Island, on the North-West Side, and by the Current setting round, brought it under the Lee of the Island, and, by good luck, the Sea Breeze setting in, brought it to the Shore near a Place called <HI>Scio,</HI> where some People were fishing, who made shift to secure it, while they sent others to get more Help, and call me, they thinking it had been a whole Vessel, and that I could contrive some Way to free her, and fit her up to go to my own Country in.</P>
<P>I saw it was only a Piece of a Ship's Quarter, but had no convenient Place to hale it ashore to secure it there, because of the Rocks; wherefore they proposed to float it down to <HI>Scio,</HI> unless they met with any convenient Beach to hale it ashore upon before; so they made fast Lines to it to tow it by, and launching it off clear of the Wash of
<PB N="272" REF="281"/>
the Sea, away they swam with it, to the Number of between 30 and 40, and, with great Difficulty, got it into a little Cove, between <HI>Scio</HI> and <HI>Pis∣carree Picuana,</HI> where they haled it to the Shore; from whence they sent to inform me of it.</P>
<P>I made all the Haste to them that I could, and finding we had not Help enough, I sent up to the Governor and Priest for more, which they procured, and came down themselves; and at the same Time, I sent for some Ropes that had been left where I had been Shipwreck'd, with which we haled it up as high as we could, and went to work to break it up as well as we could with Stones, instead of Malls; and saved all the Nails, Iron-Work, and all the Plank and Timber which we could; and after Two Days working upon it, we got it broke up so as to be able to hale all of it that we thought would be to our Purpose, clear of the Sea, which afforded us a good Quan∣tity of Boards, Timber, Nails, Spikes, Bolts, with all the Mizen Chain Plates, Bolts, with the Mizen Mast, and standing Rigging, the which I concluded should be my Keel, and resolved upon this Cove to be my Building-Place; so after we had secured all that we could, or thought worth securing, we went up to Town, and I would have gone about Building forthwith; but the Governor, and some others, told me, That I had better let them make me Boards enough before I took the People off from making them; for that they were now fixed at it in several Gangs, and if I took them off, it might be some Difficulty to get them to it again; and that besides, they could not be making Boards, if I began to build, because there were not Hatchets enough for us to work at both; besides, the Wood would be drier and lighter to work, as well as to carry down from the Moun∣tains where they cut them, to the Place where I
<PB N="273" REF="282"/>
designed to build; and therefore they rightly ad∣vised, it would be better to let them cut Boards and Timber enough, and rather more than less, before I began to build.</P>
<P>This Advice was not to be neglected, and in the mean Time, I got all the Ropes, Boards, and my Boom, which yet remained at the Place where I was wrecked, and every thing else that I thought might be of Use, to my Building-Place, which was a small League from the Cove where I designed to begin the Work.</P>
<P>I was not without many Doubts and Fears of my Ability to build this Boat, having never in my Life done any thing of that Kind, nor any thing else of Carpenters Work, and thought to myself, if I should not be able to go through with it, and especially now they had taken so much Pains about it, and were all confident of my Ability (though I all along told them, that I never had done any thing of that Kind, and was no Carpenter) yet I was afraid it might occasion them to lessen their Esteem of me, and, perhaps, slight me; but then I thought to myself on the other Hand, that no Man was born a Carpenter; that it was Necessity which put Mankind on many Inventions at first; and that I had a better Foundation to go upon, than any of those could have, that first set about it, having seen a Vessel begun, and built from the Keel: All these Consi∣derations, I say, encouraged me to proceed; and since I had gone thus far, I thought myself oblig'd to use my utmost Skill to compleat it.</P>
<P>After all was done ready for going to Work, I acquainted the Governor, &amp;c. with my Resolution to begin, who wished me Success; and he, and my Landlord, assured me, that I should be con∣stantly supplied with Provisions, &amp;c. which was faithfully performed; and so I went down with
<PB N="274" REF="283"/>
Six or Eight of the best Carpenters the Island afforded, accompanied with others, who employ'd their Time in bringing, carrying, and assisting in what they could, and going daily, some of them, to the adjacent Rocks to fish for us that were at Work; for they had all, both Carpenters and others, brought down their Fishing-Geer with them; and every Day we had some that came from Town with Pompion, &amp;c. who would stay, and let the others go up that had a Mind; so that we had always Hands enough down (besides the <HI>Singores Carpentaras)</HI> to do all the drudging Work, as carrying, lifting, and holding, as well as to catch us as much Fish as we could eat.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor came down the Day after me, and brought a Line with him, which was about Twenty Foot long, it being the Length of his Boat, and told me,</HI> That he understood by <HI>Sin∣gore Carolos,</HI> that I designed to make my Boat but little (if any thing) bigger than his; which, if I did not, he would forbid all the People to assist me any farther; for that he, and <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> too, were of Opinion, That I should only cast myself away, through my Earnestness to get off the Island.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I thanked him for his Care, but would have him believe, I knew what was fit to venture in, as well as <HI>Singore Carolos:</HI> And if <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> is such an understanding Man, <HI>said I, with a little Warmth,</HI> why does not he come down, that I might have his Assistance, to advise and con∣trive how it should be?</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> Singore <HI>Carolos</HI> was not well, and was very sorry that he was not able to come; but was in a great Fear that I would make the Boat so small, the sooner to get finished, and get off the Island, that I should drown myself.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="284"/>
<HI>I told him,</HI> I would engage to make her big enough to go almost any where in her.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> Then I must make her many Times big∣ger than his Boat; but let me make her as big as I would, he would engage me Boards, Timber, and Help enough.</P>
<P><HI>I thanked him, and asked him,</HI> How big he would have me make her?</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> At least Twice as big as his own Boat.</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>I did design to do that;</HI> and he de∣sired me to shew him how long I designed to make the Keel, I measured off Thirty Foot, though not designing her nigh that Length, only to satisfy him; and he measured with his Line, and finding it Ten Foot more than the Length of his Boat, he said, <HI>That would carry but Half as much more than that.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> The Way that I should build her, she would, at that Length, carry Four Times as much as his Boat; <HI>but he would not believe me: Whereupon, I said,</HI> That if, after the Boat was built, she did not carry above twice as much as his, I would give her to him, and tarry upon the Island till a Ship came.</P>
<P>Well, then, <HI>says he,</HI> I will take you at your Word; if she does not carry as much more as my Boat, without the Keel being any longer than the Length of this Line and Half, you are to stay with us till a Ship comes.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>said I,</HI> it's a Bargain.</P>
<P>So he borrowed a Line from one that was by, and measured the Length, and Half Length of it, and cut it off, and gave it to his Brother, who was one of my Carpenters, and bid him be sure <HI>not to let me make it a bit shorter; for he would not have me to take so much Pains, and the Vessel not to be fit to venture in at last.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="285"/>
He had brought a Goat down with him, with Pompion, and some Ears of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, Milk, and Cuscuse, which he gave us, and in the Evening went away.</P>
<P><HI>I measured the Keel out Twenty-five Foot, which, they insisted, was not the Length I had proposed to the Governor: I told them,</HI> They should see, when it was finished, that I was a better Judge of that, than any one on the Island, assuring them, That a Vessel of that Length, would carry Three or Four times as much as the Governor's Boat; and that if we made it any bigger, for want of Nails, and other Necessaries to fasten and secure her, the very Weight and Bulk of her, would make her liable to be staved to Pieces, the first Sea that she encounter'd with.</P>
<P><HI>They answered,</HI> They believed what I said to be true, and was sure I knew better than the Gover∣nor, or any-body else on the Island, even than <HI>Sin∣gore Carolos;</HI> and therefore, as it was I that was to venture in her, I ought to do her my own Way; and that Way which I thought was securest.</P>
<P><HI>I desired them</HI> not to take any Notice to the Go∣vernor, but that she was as big as he would have her, till she was finished: Which, <HI>they said,</HI> they would not.</P>
<P>I went on with my Work, but was at a sad Loss for a Saw, which some of them hearing me talk of, said, There was an old Saw on the Island, but they thought it would not cut; I desired them to get it for me, and it might be that I could sharpen it; they said, they would; so I bid them to borrow also, one of the Smith's Files, and bring it down with the Saw; which they accord∣ingly did the next Day.</P>
<P>The Saw was very old, but it was not alto∣gether so much eaten with Rust, as one might have expected it to be, having been kept dry: and
<PB N="277" REF="286"/>
in those hot Countries, if Iron be kept from the Dew and Dampness of the Sea, it will last a long Time before it decays with Rust.</P>
<P><HI>I sharpened it with the File, and set it as well as I could, so that I made it cut tolerably well, which they all much admired at, saying,</HI> That none of the People on the Island, could find the Way to make the Saw sharp; and that they believed, it exceeded the Ingenuity of <HI>Singore Carolos,</HI> though he was very ingenious, and, till I came among them, they thought no-body could go beyond him; but they saw, <HI>as they said,</HI> I could far out-strip him, as he out-stripped them.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That <HI>Singore Carolos</HI> was an inge∣nious Man, and, as I might do some Things better than he, so I did not doubt, but he could do a great many Things better than I.</P>
<P>No, <HI>they said,</HI> they would not believe but I could do every thing better than <HI>Singore Carolos,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>I believe I had nigh half finished, before Mr.</HI> Franklin <HI>came down to me, and he had been ailing all the Time. He told me,</HI> That if he had been well, to have been with me at the Beginning to have assisted me, it would, he believed, have been something more forward; but that the People were so unwilling that I should go from them, that they seem'd some of them to say, That he was partly the Adviser and Contriver of my making this Boat; And some of them, <HI>says he,</HI> owe me an Ill Will about it; but the less for my not being with you; for that other-some believe it to be wholly your own Contrivance.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> When I went up to Town, I would clear him of all that, and thought, if it was so, that he had better go up to Town again, to avoid their causeless Suspicion.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="287"/>
<HI>He said,</HI> Now he was come down, he would stay and assist me Two or Three Days.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I should be very glad of his Company, provided it would not be prejudicial to him.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> For a Day or Two, it could not, and his Time among them would not be long; for he had determined, <HI>he said,</HI> to go with me in the Boat.</P>
<P>And, indeed, he had given me this Assurance before, which was one great Reason of my build∣ing her; for to have a Boat without Hands, would have been the same, in effect, as to have no Boat at all.</P>
<P>The Person also, who had swum away from the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship when it put into this Island from St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> had promised to go with me; and likewise those that came with me from St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> as also <HI>Domingo;</HI> and so did several others, whom I had no great Dependance on, though I had on those I have now mentioned.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> lost much of his Credit by this Trip, which I was sorry for, but could not help it; for he, it seems, had oftentimes said, That he could build, &amp;c. And as for the <HI>Theorick</HI> Part, he might, I believe, understand it very well, being a Man of a good Genius, as well as a Man of Letters, having had, I believe, good and Gentleman-like Education; but for the Want of the <HI>Practical</HI> Part, he was more awkward than my black Carpenters by far, which they presently perceived, and were not a little proud of it, though I did my Endeavour to blind his Defect, as much as I could, by telling them, <HI>That he was feeble, and that his Hand shook, thro' Weak∣ness occasioned by his Illness,</HI> which passed off well enough.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="288"/>
By this Time, my black Carpenters were grown so dextrous, that by giving them a Mould with them, they would go up and hew me out Boards to answer the Winding and Rounding at the Bow, or abaft, and likewise Timber, and would cut or hew any thing to fit, I thought, better than I could, though they did not think so themselves; but the Witchcraft was, the Lines and Sweeps; for I had made me a Pair of wooden Compasses, which I sometimes used; and I never saw any thing so wondered at, as at my setting up the Stem and Stern-Post, because I used a Plummet to set them upright.</P>
<P>I made use of the Wreck Boards which we had saved, along the Body of the Boat, where it did not require much bending or winding; for they were so dry, stuborn, and stiff, that they would sooner break than bend much.</P>
<P>Our Nails began now to diminish apace, so that having nailed the Vessel indifferently secure at the Bottom, I was forced to fasten only the But-Ends, and here and there, where Necessity required, was obliged only to pin, or trunnel them with our large Spike Gimblet, which, as Cases then stood, was the best Shift we could make.</P>
<P>The Length at the Keel, was near Twenty-five Foot; the Length between Stem and Stern-Post, Thirty Foot; Breadth at the main Beam Ten Foot; Depth about Four Foot Ten Inches; I laid a Half Deck abaft, a little above Eight Foot in Length; a Fore-castle from the Stem-aft, something above Seven Foot; I laid in Four Beams that I double kneed, fastening the Knees with Spikes; the main Beam had Three Knees at each End, whereof one of them was a standing Knee; I bolted them with some of the smallest Bolts pointed, and boring the Length of our
<PB N="280" REF="289"/>
Spike Gimblet, we forced the rest by driving the Bolt red hot.</P>
<P>After we had skinn'd her, there were still Boards enough to deck her; but for want of Nails (which, at the latter End of our Work, grew so scarce, that we were forced to make Use of all the broken Points of Nails) I frequently took a Point of a Nail, which was but little more in Length, than the Thickness of the Plank, and after I had drove it up, I drove a broken Stump of a Nail upon that, till I had drove it half way in the Plank, to take the better Hold of the Timber.</P>
<P>What now concerned me most, was how to make her tight: I had some old spare Ropes, of which I made Oakum; but I found Cotton and Moss did better: My Method to try how the Caulking held, was in the Evening, after we had left off Work, to heave Water hard against the Seams within Side, and where I perceived the Water to go through, I caulked it over again.</P>
<P>I finished my Mast, and fixed the Rigging; and the Pieces of the Jibb of my former Sloop made me a Main-Sail, but too narrow by a Breadth and a half; but there was no Help.</P>
<P>My Fore-sail and Jibb, were patched out of the Pieces of the Main-Sail, and of Cotton Cloth, which was given me by the Natives, some contri∣buting one Piece, some another; some bigger, some smaller.</P>
<P>My Boom I made of my old Gaff, by scarfing a Hand-spike to it.</P>
<P>My Rudder Irons, I made thus; I got Three Eye-Bolts, and with heating, I sharpened their Points, and drove them into the Stern Post, up to the Eyes, which served in the Room of Braces, or Gudgeons, call them which you please.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="290"/>
My Pintles were made of broken Bolts that had lost their Heads, which I bended thus #, and having pointed one End I drove it into the Rudder, first making a Way for it with my Spike-Gimblet, for fear of splitting my Rudder.</P>
<P>Having got every thing in order, and fix'd, I was resolv'd to make a Trial of her, tho' I much feared my Caulking would come out at Sea, hav∣ing nothing to bind or secure it with; and ac∣cordingly sent Word up to Town that I was all ready, and desir'd they would come down, and lend their Assistance to launch the Vessel, which the more Help we had, would receive the less Damage.</P>
<P>Accordingly they all came down, with the Priest and Governor, and some Women.</P>
<P>Two or three Days before, four of the Blacks, with <HI>Nicholan Verd,</HI> went and made fast a Rope to my Anchor, which lay in the <HI>Salt Point Bay,</HI> and not only that, but haled the Palm out from under some Rocks that it was hook'd in, and swam it, I believe, a Stone's Cast, or better, and let it go again when they saw it clear of Rocks: I was forc'd to take their Words for their unhooking it from the Rock, but being on the Tops of the Rocks over-head when they did it, I was an Eye-Witness of their bringing it up to the Surface of the Water, and floating it away so far; which I was very much surpriz'd at, believing it impossible for four Times the Number to have sustain'd the Weight of the Anchor, which, besides the Stock, was two hundred three quarters, and the Stock then being so much Water-soaken, could not weigh much less than one hundred Weight.</P>
<P>The People, as I said, being all come down, we launch'd her very well; but she made a prodi∣gious Quantity of Water, as much as two Hands could keep free by constantly baling. I stopp'd

several Places where it weep'd in; but could see nothing of a constant Leak, except under three of the Floor Timber Heads, which I could not come at to stop, neither did it seem to me that half the Water that we baled out, could come in at all those Places where we discover'd it to leak; however, I chinch'd it as well as I could; and then I consulted with Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> which was the best Way to come round to <HI>Fuurno,</HI> that being the best Place on the Island to take in Provisions, and to hale her ashore at, there running, in fine Wea∣ther, but little Surf, or Suff as Seamen call it, in that Place; and I proposing to take up the Anchor in the <HI>Salt Point Bay</HI> in my Passage to <HI>Fuurno,</HI> which I could not do without the Vessel: But withal, it was something hazardous to attempt that Way, for fear the Vessel would not work, which one might reasonably doubt, considering the Builders and Tools, as also the Smallness of the Sails, which tho' so well cut as to stand tolera∣bly well, yet were little more than half enough for the Vessel; and if we should, by that Way of Proceeding, put off of the Island, it would be in a manner, impossible to fetch the Island of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and then we should be expos'd to the wide Ocean, and have a long Run before we could fetch any Land, in a leaky and open Boat, and with very little Provisions.</P>
<P>I had indeed made me a wooden <HI>Hillick,</HI> which I fasten'd to a Stone, as the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Fishing-Shallops use, by Means of my Shrouds, which I had sav'd, and now spliced together, to the Quan∣tity of about 25 Fathoms; but I did not think this sufficient to supply the Place of an Anchor, which made me very desirous to recover that in <HI>Salt Point Bay.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="292"/>
<HI>Mr.</HI> Franklin <HI>advis'd me</HI> not to run such a Ha∣zard on the Account of getting the Anchor; <HI>and said,</HI> He believ'd I might get one more suitable for my Vessel, and also with a new Hawser to it, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had left behind him at <HI>Ferrier,</HI> when he was blown off from the Island, and left his Water Cask behind him.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That would do better, if we could find the Anchor, tho' I suppos'd the Hawser would not be much worth, after it had lain so long in the Water.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> That he was on Board the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship when the Anchor was carry'd out, and that it was but a small Hatch Anchor, and the Hawser was new, and he was sure it could be found; and that several of the Blacks, as well as he, knew whereabouts in the Bay it lay: That it had a Buoy to it; but the Buoy Rope was so short, that it did not reach the Surface of the Water at low Water, but might be seen under Water in fine Weather.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon we ask'd some of the Blacks, who told me,</HI> They had seen the Buoy since I had been on the Island, and did not know but it might be there yet; but whether it was or not, they were sure they could find the Anchor.</P>
<P><HI>The Negro who had swam off from the</HI> Portu∣guese, <HI>told me,</HI> That he was on Board of the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> when he drove off: That his great Anchor came home, and the Hawser broke at the Windlace, or somewhere within Board; for, <HI>he said,</HI> he could not tell me so clearly, not knowing the proper Terms; but he was sure the Hawser broke within, and that there was a great deal of it left with the Anchor: That when they moor'd with the small Anchor, it was let go in shallow Water, and the Buoy bore; but when the Gale of Wind came on, that she brought home the great Anchor, the little Anchor came home, and dragg'd into deeper Water; so
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>
that the Buoy Rope being short, it did not bear; and when he found that the Ship was driving out to Sea, he jump'd over Board, and swam ashore: And that several times since, he had seen the Buoy, &amp;c. and was sure he could find the Anchor, unless it was bury'd in the Sand, tho' there was no Buoy to it.</P>
<P>Hereupon I concluded to go round by the <HI>Fer∣rier</HI> to the <HI>Fuurno;</HI> for that Way I run no Hazard of being blown off, by Reason I always had some of the Island to Leeward of me; but whether it was my laying open the Danger of being blown off by going the other Way, or how, I can't tell; but Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> found Means to excuse and put off his going with me in the Boat till I got to <HI>Fuurno,</HI> and then too, as you shall hear in the Se∣quel of the Story.</P>
<P>I prepar'd every Thing ready, and made four Oars, by scarfing two Pieces together in each Oar, for I could not get Pieces long enough without do∣ing so; and being a calm Day, we row'd along Shore, and got to <HI>Ferrier</HI> Bay very safe, and with very little Trouble, save the Labour of Rowing.</P>
<P>This good Success, which crown'd our first At∣tempt, so encourag'd the Blacks, that I believe forty, or more, proffer'd their Service to go with me.</P>
<P>When we had been there a Day or two, find∣ing her still continue leaky, I concluded to hale her up, and sent up to Town for Help; who accordingly came, and we got her up, and then we went to work to put in a good deal of Water, to see where it came out, thereby to discover all the Leaks.</P>
<P>I found one great Leak, which was a Knot Hole, just at the Scarff of the Stem to the Keel, which run as large as a Beer Barrel Tap: I was glad when I saw it, and stopp'd that, and the other Leaks; but all my Seams wanted caulking
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
again; for the Oakum and Cotton hanging out of the Seams, made a comical Sight at a Distance; and what to do I could not tell: However, I made it all in as well as I could; and intimating to some of the Blacks, that if I had Tallow to lay on the Seams, it would not only keep the Oakum from washing out, but would also make the Vessel a great deal more tight, they said, <HI>They were sure, if I ask'd the Governor, he would order a general Hunting Match, and kill a good Quantity of Goats, and save the Tallow for me.</HI></P>
<P>So I concluded to leave some Hands with the Boat, to keep her from shrinking by wetting her often in the Day, and as the Water leak'd out, or dry'd up with the Heat of the Sun, to reple∣nish it by putting Water from the Sea into her; which they promis'd they would, and I shew'd them how high I would have it kept, <HI>viz.</HI> to cover the Floor Timber Heads, and so I came up to Town; and as soon as I had acquainted the Governor, he not only promis'd me what I de∣sir'd, but seem'd angry because I was not so free as to ask it at first. I told him, <HI>That I had been so troublesome to him, and all the</HI> Singores <HI>of the Island, that I would not put them to this till I found the Necessity of it, and Impossibility to do without it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This was so far from being a sufficient Reason to him, that he was the more angry, and said,</HI> That he and all the <HI>Singores</HI> on the Island were at my Service, as well as every Thing that the Island produc'd, and I had so many repeated Proofs of it, since I had the Misfortune of being plac'd there, that he thought it a great Fault in me to conceal from them any thing that I stood in Need of that the Island afforded.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="295"/>
Having concluded a general Hunting, they kill'd about 40 Goats; but it being the Time of Year when they yielded but little Tallow, out of them all we did not get, I believe, more than four or five Pounds, and above half that was Skin.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor ask'd me,</HI> If that would do? <HI>I told him,</HI> It must, since we could not get any more; and that the Goats yielded so little, that it was not worth while to kill any more; but would make that do for the worst Places in the Bottom; and thank'd him for what he had done.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> I need not, he hop'd, doubt of my being welcome; <HI>but ask'd me,</HI> If Cows Tallow would not serve instead of Goats? <HI>I told him,</HI> Every bit as well. <HI>He ask'd me,</HI> Whether Hog's Fat would do? <HI>I told him,</HI> No, it was so soft, that with the Heat of the Sun warming the Water it would wash off.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He was sorry for that, because the Hogs now were fat, and he could get enough of their Fat; but was afraid the Cows would yield as little Fat as the Goats; but however, <HI>he said,</HI> he would look out one of the fattest of all his Cows, and kill it, and according as that prov'd, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I wanted, he would kill more.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, and told him, <HI>I would go down and use what I had, and in the mean time, desir'd him to send me the Fat that the Cow yielded;</HI> which he said he would: so down I went, taking the Negro who swam from the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> with ano∣ther call'd <HI>Fum-fo-roon,</HI> (who also had been on Board the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> but not when he drove to Sea, and had likewise seen the Buoy under Wa∣ter, since I came to the Island) and two or three more.</P>
<P>When I came down, I found that my Blacks, who I gave in Charge to keep the Boat wet, had been very diligent, and I believe had not let her
<PB N="287" REF="296"/>
dry in any Part of her all the Time I was absent, insomuch that she rather swell'd than shrunk; but however, now I was resolv'd to let her dry, and shrink her Seams, and so caulk her all over anew; for by caulking her so much as I had done, I had improv'd very much in this Art, so that I could now caulk better, and, as the Caulkers term it, make the Oakum not only stand fairer, but also firmer; and some of my Black Carpenters were not much behind me, tho' I always try'd their Work after them.</P>
<P>My Divers did not seek for the Anchor the first Day, as being weary of their Journey down; but the next Day, to the Number of twelve, they swam off, and I believe might be five or six Hours in the Water before they found it; and were going to give it over, when <HI>Fum-so-roon</HI> acci∣dentally playing with some of the others, at their usual Game of Plunging, and striking with their Feet, in Imitation of the <HI>Thresher</HI> and <HI>Grampus</HI>-Fish, and diving from him that struck at him, he happen'd to strike against the Buoy, which was about a Fathom under Water, there being so much more Water there than the Length of the Buoy Rope.</P>
<P>He immediately rose up, and hollow'd out as loud as he could, <HI>The Anchor! the Anchor!</HI> At which they all flock'd about him; and those who were with me on the Shore, hearing him, and see∣ing the rest flocking to him, they all jump'd into the Sea, leaving me alone, and went to help them.</P>
<P>The Anchor was bury'd in the Ground, which is thereabouts a tough clammy stiff Owse, or Clay, cover'd over with soft Owse and Sand mix'd, and they were a long Time getting it out of the Ground, but at last did; and then they attempted to get the Hawser, which lay bury'd in the Owse,
<PB N="288" REF="297"/>
and after abundance of striving, and lowering the Anchor down upon the Ground again, to rest, at last they brought it to the Shore, which, from the Place they first took it up at, wanted, I really be∣lieve, very little of a Mile.</P>
<P>I was very glad when I saw the Anchor and Hawser, which had been but very little wore, and was then fresh and good, being a four Inch and half Hawser, and about 45 Fathom long.</P>
<P>Both Anchor and Hawser were very fit for me, both for Size and Length; the Anchor, I believe, weighing about one hundred and a half.</P>
<P><HI>I gave them abundance of Thanks: They said,</HI> I was heartily welcome, and wished they could do more for me, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>The same Evening, the Governor sent me down about four or five Pounds of Tallow, and a Piece of Beef of about twenty Pounds, and acquainted me withal,</HI> That that was all the Tallow the Cow afforded, and was the fattest he had; but if I thought I should want any more, and would send him Word, he would send me down a Cow alive the next Day, and the Blacks should kill and salt it for me, to keep it in the Boat as a Store, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I accepted of his Offer, which I found was the best Way to ingratiate myself into his Favour, for you can't affront them worse than to refuse their Offers; and I made the less Scruple, because I really wanted the Tallow, and the Beef was far from being an unnecessary Present; and accord∣ingly I had one of the fattest Cows he had, sent down, which, in the Cool of the Evening, was kill'd; out of which I had five or six Pounds of Tallow, and the Beef, which was good spending Meat, we salted, first cutting out all the Bones, except the Ribs, the better to keep it from taint∣ing, and dry'd it in the Sun.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="298"/>
The Boat being now dry and shrunk enough, I went to work, and caulk'd her as well as I could, and had as many Blacks as I could trust to help; there being always enow of them down every Day, to catch as much Fish as we could tell what to do with, and every one that came down always brought something with him, as Pompion, Water-Melon, Banana's, Ears of Indian Corn, and Cuscuss, which is Indian Corn first pounded, and then boil'd over the Steam of fresh Water, till it becomes a Mass like boil'd Pudding, and then it's cut or broke in Pieces, and dry'd in the Sun, and if well dry'd will keep some Months; something resembling a Sort of Bread (but much coarser) made in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea for Seafaring Per∣sons, as our Sea Bisket is in <HI>England;</HI> so that lay∣ing by what we could not eat, I had a Stock, by the Time the Boat was fit to turn into the Water, that a Man might, if the Vessel would have per∣form'd its Part, make shift with for as great a Run as <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>After I had caulk'd all, I got some Ass's Dung; and burn'd it to black Ashes, and while it was yet a-fire, I put a Quantity into a wooden Thing like a Mortar, which they have there for pound∣ing their Maiz, &amp;c. and on that I put a sufficient Quantity of Tallow, and made one of the Blacks pound it with a wooden Pestle, till it was well in∣corporated, and then it would look as black and shining as Jet, till it stiffen'd by cooling and stand∣ing; which again might be made soft as Putty, by beating well in a Mortar.</P>
<P>The Service that this black Ashes of Ass's Dung did, was this, that after I had laid it on the Seams, and rubb'd it in well with my Fingers by drawing it along the Seam, it would, in a little Time, so harden, that the Sun, for all his Heat there, did not melt it, neither would it wash off
<PB N="290" REF="299"/>
again with the Water; besides another Service, as great as any, it did me, tho' I did not know any thing of it then, which was, that it kept the Fish from eating it off the Vessel; which I came to find out thus, After we had launch'd the Boat, the Tallow, some how or other, was rubb'd out of a Seam, a little below the Water's Edge, which, by heeling her, I brought out of the Wa∣ter, and put some clean Tallow in the Seam; but in less than half a Day, they eat all that unmin∣gled Tallow as clean off, as if there never had been any laid there, while they never touch'd that which I had mix'd with the Ashes.</P>
<P>After I had as well caulk'd my Frigate as I cou'd, and paid all the Seam's Rents, &amp;c. with Tallow and Ass's Dung Ashes, which reach'd no higher than the Ballast Mark, I got her launch'd; and after 24 Hours swelling in the Water, she was tolerable tight, insomuch, that Morning and Even∣ing was sufficient to bale her.</P>
<P>Having ballasted her, and fitted every Thing ready, I waited now only for a moderate light Gale to beat round; and at length I obtain'd my Wish, and getting every thing on Board, set sail with no less than sixteen Blacks, and more would fain have accompany'd me; but I was sadly puzzled with my raw Mariners, none of them knowing how to bear out the Foresail, to help her to stay, nor well how to row with a Lee Oar to cast her about; so that every Time I had a Mind to put about, I was forc'd to veer, which lost a great deal of Ground; besides, we were much too light, not having Ballast enough in; so that by the Time the Windward Current was done, we had not got above a League to Windward of <HI>Ferrier,</HI> and were half a League, or something less, to Leeward of a little Cove, where I had design'd to have stopp'd for the next Day's Flood,
<PB N="291" REF="300"/>
if I could have reach'd it; but perceiving it was in vain to attempt it after the Windward Current was done, I was a little concern'd at it; but yet was not a little proud that I had gain'd thus far, and could make sure of where I came from, with the Pleasure of running back again before the Wind.</P>
<P>They did not perceive our losing Ground so soon as I did, and would not be perswaded of it, nor of the Disadvantage of a Lee Tide; and were very certain, they said, that I could get to the Cove well enough.</P>
<P>I was willing to humour them, who had so often run the Risque of their Lives to serve me, knowing that we had Time enough to get into <HI>Ferrier,</HI> and moor before Night, and could run no Hazard of being driven to Leeward of it, before it would be evident to them that we lost Ground upon the Lee Tide; and therefore I made a Couple of Trips off and on, till they saw themselves that we lost considerable every Trip, and then they freely consented to bear away; which we did, and anchor'd and moor'd where we did before in the <HI>Ferrier.</HI></P>
<P>We were met there by several Blacks, who had kept on the Hills to see the Boat work, who said she went bravely, like a Fowl slying for Swift∣ness.</P>
<P>I took in some more Ballast the next Day, and staid two or three Days; and having a fit Oppor∣tunity to my Mind, both for Tide and moderate Weather, I beat up, and my Mariners being some∣thing more handy than at first, so that they could help to stay her with a Lee Oar, we got, by the Time that it was high Water, under the Leeward∣most of the little Islands, where I stopp'd till the next Morning; and taking the Advantage of a Windward Tide, I made two or three small
<PB N="292" REF="301"/>
Trips under the Islands, till we got a-breast of the Windward of most of them, which I did (the Weather being moderate) more to exercise and divert my Mariners, than any Necessity; for the Wind being far Northerly, as it mostly is there, when it's fine Weather, I could have weather'd the Point of <HI>Ghuylungo,</HI> which is the Weathermost Point of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, with one Trip.</P>
<P>Having got the Length of the Weathermost of the little Islands, I bore away afore the Wind for the <HI>Fu̇urno,</HI> and arriving there, was welcom'd, with abundance of Joy, by the Blacks, who had all the Day, with inexpressible Pleasure and Satis∣faction, been on the Rocks, seeing us under Sail from our weighing, till we got in.</P>
<P>I moor'd there; and being now secure, I went up to Town to take my final Leave, as I then thought, of the Inhabitants, and to thank them for all their Kindness to me; who all contributed to supply me with Provisions, &amp;c. for the Voyage, with the same Good-Nature and Chearfulness, which I had experienc'd so fully on many Occa∣sion, and stor'd me with Pompion, Feshoon, Maiz, and every Thing else that the Island afforded, in great Plenty.</P>
<P>Having pass'd four or five Days among them, I prepar'd for my Voyage to St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, where I was in Hopes to have found an Opportunity of getting a Passage off, sooner than from St. <HI>John</HI>'s Island; but when I was ready, to my great Sur∣prize, Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> would not go with me; and gave me such Reasons for his Refusal, as I was forc'd to acquiesce with.</P>
<P>I took my little Boy on Board with me, who, till then, had been up at Town; neither had he been down with me all the Time that I was build∣ing the Boat, being too young to do me much Service on that Occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="302"/>
When he came down, the Blacks ask'd him, <HI>How he lik'd the Boat?</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Boy cry'd, and said,</HI> He did not like her at all; but knew his Master would have a better when he came home.</P>
<P><HI>They ask'd him,</HI> If he would stay with them till his Master came back with a better Ship to fetch him?</P>
<P><HI>To which the Child said,</HI> If his Master would say that he would have him stay, and would pro∣mise to fetch him away soon, he would stay, but otherways would not.</P>
<P>The Blacks having told me this, I ask'd the Boy, to try him, <HI>If he had a Mind to live on the Island?</HI> He said, <HI>No, if I would please to carry him with me; if not, he must stay till some Ship came. Why then,</HI> says I, <HI>you won't live here all your Life. No,</HI> said the Boy, <HI>if I can any ways get away. Why,</HI> said I, <HI>you told the Blacks you was willing to stay if I would let you.</HI> He said, <HI>He only said so for fear of them.</HI> So I told him, <HI>He should not stay without he had a Mind:</HI> And having every Thing ready, and my Mariners, which were the two I brought from the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and he that came from St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and swam away from her here, with three more of the Islanders, I unmoor'd, and sail'd from the <HI>Fuurno</HI> about two Hours be∣fore Day, taking the first of the Northern Stream, and chose the Morning Tide, in order to get cross the Channel before the Day Gale set in strong, which sometimes, as I hinted before, blows in violent Flaws down the <HI>Ghors;</HI> and that I might get into St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s time enough in the Day to find a Harbour, or convenient Place to anchor at, being myself a perfect Stranger to that Island; and being able to make no Reliance on <HI>Nicholau Verd,</HI> who was with me, tho' he said that he was
<PB N="294" REF="303"/>
well acquainted with all the Anchoring-Places, as well as Landing-Places, which on that Island are not many, having been deceiv'd by him before in finding the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> of which he was very po∣sitive, which was the Occasion of my being ship∣wreck'd on that Island.</P>
<P>We got in to Windward of the <HI>Villa,</HI> and run down till we came to <HI>Fonte de Villa,</HI> which is a sandy Bay; but the Wind being pretty far Nor∣therly, which is an open Wind there, I would not anchor, altho' my Pilot <HI>Verd</HI> assur'd me that was the Road; but I was resolv'd to run till I could bring the Land to Windward, knowing that if the worst came, if I could not find a Place to secure the Boat, I could run her under the Lee of the Island to the Rocks, and save our Lives; which, had I anchor'd at <HI>Fonte de Villa,</HI> the Surff run so high, that it would be very ha∣zardous to effect, especially as neither the Boy nor I could swim.</P>
<P>I run down along Shore, and could see a great Concourse of People on the Tops of the Clifts; and after I doubled the Point of <HI>Nossa Singora,</HI> I came into smoother Water, and much less Wind, which then blew to Windward, and in the Offing very hard.</P>
<P>This was also a sandy Bay, and the Point broke off both Wind and Sea, yet there run a great Surff on the Shore; however, I haled in, and anchor'd in six Fathom Water, a little to the Northward of the Church of <HI>Nossa Singora,</HI> which appears something like a Barn; the Outside of the Walls were seemingly as white as if they had been but just white-wash'd, and the Roof was cover'd with red Pantiles, as are also some of the Houses of the <HI>Villa.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="304"/>
As soon as I came to an Anchor, one of my Black Mariners swam ashore, to give an Account who we were; and in about half an Hour after, two Blacks of the Islanders swam off, and brought me a Compliment from <HI>▪Singore Capiteen Thome Santee,</HI> of a Water-Melon. That <HI>Singore</HI> was right ashore with the Horse of the Island; for our coming had alarm'd them, and the Governor, who was a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and formerly had been Governor (or, as they call him, Captain <HI>More)</HI> of a Fort or Factory belonging to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> upon their dis∣covering us bearing towards the Island, order'd all the Inhabitants to arm themselves with such Weapons as they had, to oppose me if I had been an Enemy, or come to rob them; they having a strong Aversion to Pirates, ever since they were plunder'd by one, as they relate, about thirty Years ago. <HI>Thome Santee</HI> was Commandant of the Horse, and was order'd by the Governor to march along the Clifts as far as <HI>Nossa Singora</HI> to defend the Coast, in Case I should attempt to land, before they were satisfy'd what I was.</P>
<P><HI>The two Men who swam off, told me,</HI> That <HI>Singore Thome</HI> bid them tell me, that if I sail'd down a little lower, there was a little Bay call'd <HI>Laghate,</HI> where I might put the Boat to the Beach, and wade ashore, the Sea being very smooth, and little or no Surff running there on the Shore; and that <HI>Singore Thome</HI> had sent them to go with me, and shew me the Bay.</P>
<P>So we weigh'd, and away we went; and came down to the Bay, which was a little Sandy one, with a little Point of Rocks to Windward, which made it very smooth, the Trade very seldom reaching down so far; it being mostly calm, ex∣cept from about 4 P. M. tho' sometimes sooner, and sometimes later, which then would blow a
<PB N="296" REF="305"/>
faint Southerly or South-West Breese till six or seven at Night, and then fall calm till about one or two in the Morning, and then would blow a light Breese, or Air of Southerly Wind; tho' none of these Breeses made any thing the more Swell or Surff on the Shore, which, until I knew, I was afraid it would; for at the first coming of the Evening Breeses, the Surface of the Water appears as if there was a strong Gale of Wind coming; and at the first is pretty fresh, but comes but like a Puff; for by the Time the Vessel is winded to it, it's over; and then, as I said before, it continues a faint languid Gale, till it dies or dwindles away at last to a Calm.</P>
<P>By the Time I had got down and moor'd, which I did by laying my Anchor off, and a Rope fast to a great Stone ashore, the Southerly Breese began to come on, which you might discern by the Change of the Colour of the Surface of the Water, a pretty Space before it came; and then coming so smart at first, made me not a little fear∣ful of losing my Boat, which I was not willing to do, till I knew whether there was any more Hopes of getting off this Island sooner than St. <HI>John</HI>'s; and likewise how I should be receiv'd and entertain'd here; for my Design was, if I saw or heard of no more Likelihood of a Ship coming here, than to the Island of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, and especially if I did not find so good Reception and Entertainment, to have return'd back again to the Island of St. <HI>John</HI>'s; which was what I was desir'd to do, and accordingly promis'd to the Governor, and all the People of the Island of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>There were several of the Blacks came down to this little Bay: They call'd to me, and would fain have had me come ashore; but I told them I would not till the Morning. One or two of them
<PB N="297" REF="306"/>
came off to us, and told me, <HI>That</HI> Singore Cap∣tain Thome Santee <HI>expected me up to Town, and they believ'd,</HI> they said, <HI>he had sent the Governor Word so, and waited at</HI> Nossa Singora <HI>to conduct me to Town.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> What Sort of People the Islanders were? <HI>and,</HI> Whether the Road from where we lay to Town was good?</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> The People were very kind to Stran∣gers; that I should have the Coversation of <HI>Bran∣ca's,</HI> as I was, &amp;c. and that the Road to Town was indifferent to pass at low Water, but a little dange∣rous in one Place, because of the Stones tumbling down; but at high Water there was no passing, by Reason that the Rocks were so steep.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd,</HI> How it came that they were not afraid to come along?</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> That they took their Chance; and that it was but seldom the Stones tumbled down, except in the rainy Seasons. <HI>They would fain have persuaded me to go ashore, and lie there the Night, where they said they had a good Fire and Victuals; but I told them,</HI> I would stay on Board to see how it would be, and was afraid of the Wind which blew almost right on the Shore, and hoped it would not blow so hard to raise the Sea, or put the Boat ashore.</P>
<P>They said, <HI>I need not fear that now, for that these Winds never held long;</HI> and gave me a De∣scription of them, as I have above related, as nigh as they could.</P>
<P>Next Morning I went ashore, and while I wait∣ed for their roasting some Pompion, &amp;c. for my Breakfast, came Captain <HI>Thome Santee,</HI> accompa∣ny'd with some others of the <HI>Grand Singores</HI> of the Island, and among them the <HI>Scrivan</HI> of the <HI>Singore Capiteen More,</HI> in order to compliment me from his Master, with the Offer of his House, and
<PB N="298" REF="307"/>
all the good Offices which was in his Power to serve me in.</P>
<P><HI>I thank'd him, and waited on him first when I came to Town, who receiv'd me very civilly, and from thence Captain</HI> Thome <HI>took me to his House; and after that I visited some of the rest of the Grandees of the Town, and at Night lay at Cap∣tain</HI> Thome<HI>'s, who told me,</HI> That he was <HI>Pate∣roon,</HI> or, <HI>as they also call'd it, Procurador,</HI> of the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> but had not been there a long Time: That it was he that made <HI>Leuonei Gonsalvo</HI> Governor of St. <HI>John;</HI> and that if I wanted any thing to be done to my Boat, there were two Blacks, Natives of <HI>Senegal,</HI> who were sent by the <HI>French</HI> Factory there to <HI>France,</HI> to learn the Art of Ship∣building, and were put ashore here by the Pirates, who had taken them on Board of a <HI>French</HI> Ship that was carrying them from <HI>France</HI> to the Factory.</P>
<P><HI>I desir'd to see them, and they were immedi∣ately call'd; and, when come, I ask'd them,</HI> What Countrymen they were? <HI>They said,</HI> They were of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and that one was born at <HI>Senegal,</HI> the other near <HI>Gambio-River,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Barrah;</HI> and that from their Childhood they had been brought up at the <HI>French</HI> Factory at <HI>Senegal,</HI> and were sent by them to <HI>France</HI> to learn the Car∣penter's Art: That they had been something above five Years in <HI>France,</HI> at a City call'd <HI>Nants,</HI> and had learned so well in that Time, that they were capable to build a Boat, or small Sloop, without any body's instructing or directing them.</P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> If they were willing to go to their own Country? <HI>or,</HI> Whether they would rather stay where they now were? <HI>They smil'd, and said,</HI> They would give all the World, if they were Masters of it, to be in their own Country again.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="308"/>
<HI>I ask'd them,</HI> Whether they thought they could fit or improve my Boat so far, as to be capable to go to <HI>Guinea?</HI> and if they could, I would carry them to their own Country.</P>
<P><HI>They sigh'd, and said,</HI> They could not tell; they had seen my Boat, <HI>they said,</HI> when she pass'd by the Town the Day before, and she look'd very well; but they believ'd I was the best Judge whe∣ther she was capable or not.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I knew she was not capable of going there as she was now; but did not know but with their Assistance I might improve her so, as to be able to go there: That she was big enough, and was al∣most half-deck'd over; and that with their Assistance and Contrivance we might perhaps deck her all over; but the chief Thing she wanted, was the strengthening and binding her.</P>
<P><HI>I then told them the Dimensions of her in Length, Breadth, and Depth; who answer'd me, (for they had a perfect Idea of our Foot Measure)</HI> That the <HI>French</HI> Factory at <HI>Senegal</HI> had several Sloops that went a trading up the River, and also into <HI>Gambio River,</HI> less than my Boat, as I call'd her, tho', they <HI>said,</HI> they thought she merited the Name of a Sloop.</P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Thome <HI>ask'd them,</HI> If they would go over with me to St. <HI>John</HI>'s, where there was Wood enough, and every thing else, in more Plenty than there?</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They were Strangers here, and could chuse nothing themselves; but were at the Disposal of the Governor at present, and hoped, out of Re∣spect to the <HI>French</HI> Nation, to whom they belong'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would not only use them well, as he had done ever since their being on this Island, but would, as he had often promis'd, make use of the first Opportunity that with Safety offer'd, to send them to the <HI>French</HI> Factory of <HI>Senegal,</HI> whereto they properly belong'd;
<PB N="300" REF="309"/>
or if no such Opportunity offer'd, to send them to any other Part of <HI>Guinea,</HI> from which they could with Safety travel thither; such Parts were <HI>Gam∣bio, Rio Graude, Cacheu,</HI> or <HI>Sierra Leon,</HI> and they did not in the least doubt, but the <HI>French</HI> Factory would make him a suitable Satisfaction for so doing; and if at any Time, any belonging to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> should be under the Circumstances that they at present were, they did not doubt but the <HI>French</HI> would use them with the same Civility which they had hitherto found here, and use Means to have them sent to where they belong'd.</P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Thome <HI>said,</HI> He did not by any means propose their going with me to be by the Way of Constraint, or without the Governor's Leave, but as a Thing that might be to their Advantage; for if they could make the Captain's Boat fit to go to <HI>Guinea,</HI> it would be a sufficient Reward, he thought, for their Pains, to be put on their own Country again.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> So it would, and more; but that they thought was impossible.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> The only Way to be certain, was to go and see the Boat; or if they would go with me to the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> and if when they came there, they found that they could not have Conve∣niencies to do as we expected, or propos'd to our∣selves, that I would engage myself to bring them back to the Island of St. <HI>Philip</HI> again.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They were willing to do me all the Service they could, but they had not any Tools, ex∣cepting one Hatchet.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I had, or could get, all the Tools that were made Use of in the building her.</P>
<P>But, <HI>said they,</HI> where will you get Spikes and Nails?</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="310"/>
<HI>I told them,</HI> I had none; but I had some ol Iron left.</P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Thome <HI>said,</HI> There was a Smith, who could make Nails, he believed, and he could pre∣vail with him to go over to St. <HI>John</HI>'s, and would go himself also, if I would be sure to bring him back again; for that he had a great Mind to go to St. <HI>John</HI>'s, to take an Account of what Goat Skins <HI>Leuonel Gonsolvo,</HI> the Governor, had saved.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would; <HI>so asking the Blacks again, they said,</HI> That as Captain <HI>Thome</HI> desired it, and was also resolved to go himself, they only desired, that he, or I, would acquaint the Governor of it, which, if he approved of, they would accordingly.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Thome</HI> and I hereupon went to the Governor, and acquainted him with what the <HI>Guinea</HI> Blacks had said, as also with Captain <HI>Thome</HI>'s Design to get the Smith to go, as like∣wise of his own Resolution; which the Governor would fain have persuaded him from, for fear of any unforeseen Accident which might happen, so as not to be able to get back; but Captain <HI>Thome</HI> was fixed in his Resolution, and at last, the Governor consented.</P>
<P>The next Thing we had to do, was to per∣suade the Smith, which he effectually did; and then asked me, <HI>Whether I wanted any thing that the Island afforded?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> The chief Thing I wanted was Sails.</P>
<P>He said, <HI>He had nothing but Cotten Cloths, and if they would do me any Good, he would give me some;</HI> I told him, <HI>They would;</HI> so he gave me Three White Cotton Cloths; and he also gave me an old rusty Half-Inch Auger, and a small Gage, which, he said, had been given him by a <HI>French</HI> Captain of a Vessel, which had been a trading some Years since at this Island for Mules.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="311"/>
Next Thing we had to do, was to get Provi∣sions on Board for the Voyage, which was done in a plentiful Manner, such as the Island afforded; there were several of the Islanders came to me to ask Leave to go with me, after they heard Cap∣tain <HI>Thome</HI> was going; and, not caring to diso∣blige any of them, I turned them over to Cap∣tain <HI>Thome,</HI> saying, <HI>That I left all to him;</HI> and likewise told him, <HI>That it would not be convenient to carry many.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He would have me do as I pleased, be would not advise me to carry one, if I did not ap∣prove of it.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> If any of his, or the Governor's Friends had a Mind to go, not exceeding <HI>10</HI> or <HI>12,</HI> I could carry them without any great Inconvenience.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He had no Friend that he would ask that Favour for, but one, and did not design that it should be <HI>gratis</HI> neither, for he would make me what Retaliation he could, in any thing the Island of St. <HI>Philip</HI> afforded, and would also oblige them in St. <HI>John</HI>'s, to assist me in every thing which that Island afforded, that would be serviceable to me, he being, <HI>as he told me before, Pataroon</HI> or <HI>Procurador</HI> of that Island; and for any-body else that had a Mind to go, and I thought fit to carry, as I wanted Sails, and that Cotton Cloths would be useful to me, he would have me make every one that went, pay one or two Cloths for their Passage.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would leave all that to his Ma∣nagement</P>
<P>He said, <HI>He would take it upon him;</HI> which ac∣cordingly he did, and when we had got all rea∣dy, and on Board, I weighed from <HI>Laghate,</HI> about an Hour, or better, before the Northern Tide was made, and having the Advantage of the Southern Breeze, which lasted us up to the Point of <HI>Nossa Singore;</HI> which, what with our Sails,
<PB N="303" REF="312"/>
and what with our Oars, we arrived at, by the Time the Flood set up to the Northward; and then, after we had opened the Point of <HI>Nossa Singore,</HI> we met the Trade-Wind, and making Two or Three Boards, got the Length of <HI>Ballcavilier</HI> a good while before the Tide was done; but fearing, the Tide being well spent, and the Wind being far Northerly, that I should not fetch the <HI>Fuurno</HI> on a Lee Tide, I anchored there, and staid to take a whole Flood to cross the Channel; and the Tide serving before Day, I weighed from thence about Three or Four of the Clock in the Morning, and got into the <HI>Fuurno</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, a little after Noon that Day, to the great Satisfaction, as well of my Passengers, as of the Islanders of St. <HI>John;</HI> but especially my black Marriners who accompanied me the Voyage, and did not fail to brag of it, more than perhaps a raw Sailer would of his first Voyage to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I consulted my</HI> Guinea <HI>Carpenters, and shewed them what I would have done,</HI> viz. To lay a Piece of Timber along the Joyning of the upper Timber to the Floor Timber, fore and aft, spiked and trunnelled down through the Timber and Out∣side Plank, which, <HI>I told them,</HI> would be a mighty Strengthening to her; <HI>which they agreed to.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then I told them,</HI> I would have the Fore-Castle raised even with the Gunnel, and Two Planks Breadth run from that aft, to the Quarter Deck on both Sides, with a narrow thick Board set an Edge in the Nature of Coamings, that if any Water should come over our Gunnel on our narrow Deck, that these Coamings might prevent its going down in the Hold; and likewise to trunnel the Outside Plank to the Timber, as much as we thought convenient; <HI>All which they agreed to as very requisite.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="313"/>
The St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Smith promised to make Nails, and the old Ferrier, whom I often before men∣tioned, undertook to make as much Charcoal, as we should want, and likewise to assist the new Smith all he was able.</P>
<P>I told Captain <HI>Thome Santee, That if I haled my Boat up dry, as I must, if I did any thing to her, that she would want caulking all over, and consequently Cotton</HI> (though I had saved all the spare Pieces of Rope that I could, and had more than enough to make Oakum sufficient for once caulking; but I thought it best to keep a Store as long as I could, for fear I might want when I should not have such an Opportunity to get it) <HI>and likewise Tallow to lay on the Seams, or if I had enough, it would do much better to lay it all over her Bottom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He would take care and order <HI>Leuonel Gonsalvo</HI> to kill some wild Goats.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That the wild Goats would not yield any Tallow; and that if the Governor had not killed Two Cows for me, I should have been forced to go to Sea without Tallow.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> If I had told him any thing of that while he was at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, he would have ordered Three or Four Cows to be killed for me; but, how∣ever, <HI>said he,</HI> if there be any Cows in St. <HI>John</HI>'s, you shall not want Tallow.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> There were Cows enough; Well, <HI>said he,</HI> then you shall have Tallow enough.</P>
<P>So Word being sent up for all Hands to come down to hale the Boat up, accordingly they came, and we haled her about her Length above the flowing of a Spring Tide; and then Captain <HI>Thome,</HI> and the rest, went to Town to divert them∣selves till the Boat was got ready.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="314"/>
I got for Freight of my Passengers that I brought from St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, Ten Cotton Cloths, which made me a good Fore-Sail, and repaired my Jibb; of some that was left, I made a Pair of Trouzers for myself, and a Jacket and Trouzers for my little Boy. My old Carpenters came and proffered their Service to me to cut Boards, and bring them down, or what other Timber we wanted; which they did, the Country all the Time supplying us with Food daily: besides, Capt. <HI>Thome</HI> sent down in the <HI>Interim</HI> Two Cows, and promised a Third for the Voyage; and if that would not yield Tallow enough, he would order the Governor to kill some wild Goats.</P>
<P>We finished our Business in about Two Months, or a little more, having caulked her, and payed her Bottom with Tallow, and having got every thing in a Readiness for sailing; and proposing to go first to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> after I had put Captain <HI>Thome,</HI> and the St. <HI>Philippians</HI> there, ashore, and not being re∣solved to go to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and loth to take the Two black Carpenters from where they were so well used and entertained, to run the Chance of my uncertain Fortune, I thought it was just to leave them where I found them, till they should light of an Oppertunity to go to their own Country; but told them, <HI>That when I arrived at St.</HI> Jago, <HI>if I did not meet with an Opportunity of a Ship, and that I sound the Boat sufficient, I knew nothing to the contrary, but I might go in her to</HI> Guinea, <HI>if I met with any Prospect there, or at St.</HI> Philip<HI>'s, or at both; and if so, I should not fail to carry them; but if I did,</HI> I said, <HI>I should not go to</HI> Senegal, <HI>be∣cause the</HI> French <HI>allow no</HI> English <HI>to trade there; but if I went, it should be either to</HI> Gambio, Rio Grande, Cacheu, <HI>or some of the Rivers between that and</HI> Sierra Leon.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="315"/>
<HI>They said,</HI> They would as lieve be carried to <HI>Gambio,</HI> as to <HI>Senegal;</HI> And, <HI>said he that was borne there,</HI> if you carry me there, I will engage you a good lusty Slave; but if you go to any of the other Places, I cannot; but will do you all the Ser∣vice on the trading Account that I can, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Every thing being ready, and on Board, we sailed from the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> and arriving at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, I put all ashore that were to go ashore there, and staying Three Days in that Island, I stocked my∣self with Provisions and Water; after which I sailed, and in about Ten Days Time, I beat up to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and, had I not been acquainted with the Set of the Current, I might have beat till now, before I had got up to it in that Boat; I fetched a Bay at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> called, <HI>Rivero des Bharkas,</HI> where I anchored; but finding that there were no Ships there, and had not been for some Months, except one <HI>Ostend India</HI> Ship, called by the Inhabitants, <HI>Nau India des Imperio;</HI> and find∣ing there was a great Scarcity of Salt at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> I concluded to go to the Isle of <HI>May</HI> and take in Salt; for I was near half full with Pompion, Maiz, &amp;c. and the St. <HI>Jago</HI> Men told me, <HI>That they understood, that the Isle of</HI> May <HI>was almost famished for the Want of Sustenance, as they had had a Scarcity, more or less, for above Fifteen or Sixteen Years, depending wholly on the Ships that load Salt there, for Subsistance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I asked them,</HI> How they heard that there was such a Scarcity at the Isle of <HI>May?</HI></P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> That all the Salt Ships which had touched this Year there for Water, had given them an Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>I asked them,</HI> Whether there had many Salt Ships touched here this Year?</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> Not above Three or Four that they heard of.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="316"/>
I recruited my Water, and concluded to go about the North End of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> as being the best Way to gain the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> though I do not question, but 'tis the Opinion of many, that they can sooner beat up the other Way; but I assure them, when they have experienc'd it, they will be of my Opinion.</P>
<P>We had a good Parcel of Mandyokes given to us by the Country People at <HI>Rivero des Bharcos,</HI> where I lay Two Nights, and then weighed and anchored in the Bay of <HI>Rivero de Prata,</HI> and stopp'd during a Lee Tide there, and the next windward Tide, we got to <HI>Porto Terra-fall,</HI> where I lay Thir∣teen Days, the Wind blowing so strong, that I was afraid to venture my Sails; for I found my Boat was more able to encounter the Sea, than my Sails were the Wind.</P>
<P>Fine Weather presenting, I weighed from <HI>Terra-fall</HI> with a windward Tide, and beat that Tide to windward of <HI>Porto Facienda</HI> about Half a League; but finding when the Lee Tide was made, that I lost Ground, and not seeing, or knowing any secure Place to anchor at, that I could fetch, I bore away for <HI>Porto Facienda,</HI> where I anchored that Night.</P>
<P>Next Day Tide, I weighed, but could not get about the Island that Tide; neither could I find any Place to venture to anchor at, to stop the Tide; and being loth to bear down to <HI>Porto Faci∣enda,</HI> I resolved to keep the Sea all Night, which I did, my Mariners being become very expert.</P>
<P>Next Morning the Lee Tides had hurried me far to Leeward, and it blowing fresh all Night, made a chopping Sea set about the North Point of the Island, insomuch, that I could not fetch <HI>Porto Facienda,</HI> from whence I came the Day before, and it was as much as ever I could do
<PB N="308" REF="317"/>
to fetch <HI>Terra-fall</HI> Road, where I lay Two or Three Days, and fine Weather presenting, I weighed, and stopped again the Lee Tide at <HI>Porto Facienda,</HI> and the next Morning Tide, I beat the Tide an End; but was sadly puzzled then, to find a Place to stop the Lee Tide, with∣out which, I found it was impossible for me to get round the Island with my dull-swift Fri∣gat.</P>
<P>It was Day-light, and moderate Weather, and I saw a little Bay under my Lee-bow, which seemed to me to be a sandy or shingly Beach, into which I resolved to run, as long as I saw any Prospect of Safety, the Water being clear enough to discern any thing before it hurt me, and my Boat drawing about Four Foot Water, or a little more; and if the worst came to the worst, and it would not do, I could but run off again.</P>
<P>Right against the Bay, were a great many Rocks, some larger, some smaller, the largest of them not above a good Stone's Cast in Length, and most of them above Water, extending about Half a League off from the Shore: I run in, and keeping a good Look-out, luffing for one, and bearing away for another; till at last, I got safe in, though with taking a great deal of Care; for without that, it would have been very dangerous: However, after we were in, it made us Amends for our Trouble in finding it, for there was a safe and pleasant Cove run in behind the Point, about a good Cable's Length wide from which, you could see no Sea, but was Land-locked for all Winds, and from Five to Three Fathom Water, a Sort of a Sand and Ooze mix'd.</P>
<P>I had not been above an Hour, or thereabouts, at an Anchor, when Two Blacks came down to the Water-side, and called to us, and asked,
<PB N="309" REF="318"/>
<HI>Where we came from? and what Countrymen we were?</HI></P>
<P><HI>We told them,</HI> We came from <HI>Porto Faciendo</HI> last; and that she was an <HI>English</HI> Vessel.</P>
<P>O, <HI>they said,</HI> that was well enough, they had heard of us, how that we had been there, and at <HI>Porto Terra-fall: We told them,</HI> It was so; <HI>and they went away again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In a little Time came down an elderly Man, with Four Slaves armed with Lances, attending him; he very courteously asked me to come ashore: I told him,</HI> I was a little busy as yet, and had not well secured my Vessel; but would wait on him as soon as I could; <HI>and asked him,</HI> If he pleased to accept of a Water Melon to refresh him in the mean Time?</P>
<P>He thanked me, and bid me heave it into the Water, and he would send one of his Slaves to bring it ashore; which I did, and Two of the Lance-men swam off and carried it ashore to their Master, who sat under the Clift of a Rock in the Shade, for the Sun shone very hot; for though it was a fresh Gale in the Offing, yet in the Cove, we had not a Breath of Wind, save now and then a light Air would come down thro' the Valley.</P>
<P>The grave Gentleman spread his Cloak, and cut the Water Melon, laying it in as great Order, as if it had been a Person of Quality's Table set with the greatest Varieties; he called Two of his Attendants to him, and, I suppose, gave them Orders what they should do: I could not hear, but I saw the Two Slaves make their Master a very reverent Bow, and went away.</P>
<P>I did not care much for trusting myself ashore with him at first; for that Part of St. <HI>Jago</HI> consists mostly of Banditti, who frequently fly thither from Justice, and sometimes make Incursions among the more civiliz'd Parts of the Island,
<PB N="310" REF="319"/>
where, if they are catched, they suffer; but if they escape thither, they are secure; for no Officer of Justice dare follow them there, they assuming a Privilege to themselves to oppose Justice, even in case of Murder: But after he so kindly accepted my Present, which, with those People, is mostly esteemed as a Token, or Tye of Friendship, I ventured ashore.</P>
<P>As soon as he saw me coming, he got up and came to meet me, with his Two Attendants who remained with him, armed with their Lances, and one of them with a Cutlash, which I had not ob∣served before; he himself having no other Arms, that I saw, but a long sharp-pointed Knife, the Blade about Two Foot long, with a Brass cast Handle, which he wore like a Bayonet.</P>
<P><HI>He received me with Abundance of ceremonious, Formality, and welcomed me ashore, asking seve∣ral Questions, As,</HI> What Country? From whence I came? Whether I was going, &amp;c.? <HI>to all which, I gave him an Account; and he told me, without asking, as is usual with them (especially if they are in any Post of Credit)</HI> That he was the Justice of these Parts; that all that Land as far as I could see, was his Estate; that he had large Silver Mines on his Ground, but did not know how to extract the Silver out of the Oar, and was afraid to send to the City for a Silver-Smith, for fear it should, by that Means, be discovered to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who would not fail, as soon as he came to know it, to send an Army and seize it to his own Use, and, perhaps, might be a Means of making them lose their Privileges here, which had been preserved ever since the Island of St. <HI>Jago</HI> was inhabited: <HI>He said moreover,</HI> That he would send up one of his Slaves to fetch me some of the Silver Oar.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="320"/>
Why, <HI>said I,</HI> is it so nigh? <HI>He said,</HI> It was not far off; it was in Sight; <HI>and pointing to a Moun∣tain, said,</HI> It was on the Side of that.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would, if he pleased, take a Walk up to it.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> It was too late, and was an ugly Way, but one of his Slaves could soon go, and be back again, with some of it to shew me, and on the mor∣row, if I thought fit to go, he would go with me, and I should have a Horse to ride on, as far as the Horse could go.</P>
<P>By this Time the Two Slaves which he had sent away, came back, and brought a large Calabash of Milk, and a fine young full-grown Goat, and very fat, which he presented me with; I received it with Thanks, and told him, <HI>I was sorry I had nothing on Board worth presenting him with, in Re∣turn of his Kindness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> I had done that already sufficiently; for he took so much Satisfaction in the Honour I did him, by giving him my good Company, that he did not know what he could do to make me a suitable Retaliation: Besides, <HI>said he,</HI> the Water Melon which you gave me, I do not take it for such a slight Present as you imagine; for the Seeds I design to plant; and though it may not yield better Melons than what I already have, yet, being sprung from the Seed of a Melon which came from Abroad, it will always pass for a Rarity.</P>
<P><HI>I asked him,</HI> If he would be pleased to accept of a Pompion of the Growth of. St. <HI>John</HI>'s?</P>
<P><HI>He thanked me, and told me,</HI> He would, but would have but one, which would yield him Seed enough.</P>
<P>So I called on Board, and bid them bring one of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Island Pompions, and another that was brought from St. <HI>John</HI>'s, which they did, and I presented them to <HI>Singore Jhuiss,</HI> who told
<PB N="312" REF="321"/>
That was his Title, but his Name was <HI>Singore Jorge Vharela.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time, the Slave was returned with the supposed Silver Oar; It was a Rock of a yellowish gray Colour, and sleaked off in Flakes, about the Thickness of those Slates which are used to cover Houses, full of shining Spangles, which glistened in the Sun Beams like Crystal Glass.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I believed there was no Silver con∣tained in what I saw, neither did I believe, if all the Rock was the same, that it contained any.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> For his Part, he knew nothing of the Matter; but it was the constant Notion, of longer standing than the Memory of any living, that that was a Silver Mine.</P>
<P>I not being willing to argue, told him, <HI>It might be so for ought I knew.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> If I thought it was worth my ac∣cepting, he would give me as much of it as I pleased to carry, and his Slaves should bring it down to the Water Side for me on Asses.</P>
<P><HI>I thanked him, and told him,</HI> I could not make any Use of it at present; that I was going to the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and designed to take in Salt there for this Island; and when I came back again, I would consult with him about it.</P>
<P><HI>He asked me,</HI> If I would go with him on the Morrow, and he would send a Horse and Slave down for me.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I only stopped here for an Opportunity to get round the Point of the Island, and was in hopes, the next Day's Tide, to have such an Op∣portunity, and therefore would defer my going to see his Mine, till my Return from the Isle of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He asked me,</HI> If I was acquainted with any of the <HI>Singores</HI> of the City?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I knew some of them.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="322"/>
<HI>He ask'd me,</HI> Who? <HI>I told him,</HI> I knew the General, Singore <HI>Bispo,</HI> Singore <HI>Pedro Balldera∣vessa,</HI> Singore <HI>Antonia de Barra,</HI> Singore <HI>Ovidore,</HI> and a great many more.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> I knew the best <HI>Fidallgo</HI>'s on the Island; and that <HI>Singore Pedro Ballderavessa</HI> was his good Friend.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> So he was mine; <HI>and ask'd him,</HI> Whether he had seen him lately? and that I hoped he was in good Health.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He never had seen him in his Life; but that he had done his Father a great Kindness, in speaking in his Behalf to the <HI>Singore Ovidore:</HI> But, <HI>said he,</HI> I do not remember it; but have often heard my Father talk of it.</P>
<P>I smil'd to myself, and thought it must be a very slight Friendship, where there was not so much as an Acquaintance.</P>
<P>We had a great deal of Discourse more, in which he often repeated, how much he was bound to, and esteem'd his unknown (but by hearsay) as well as unseen Friend; and I could not but wish Gratitude were as much us'd among us, who generally forget a good Turn but a few Days ago; and yet these ignorant (I should say innocent) Creatures, are extremely sensible of Favours done, not only to themselves, but to their Ancestors, for Ages past.</P>
<P>It being Evening, he arose to go; and ask'd me, <HI>What Time I thought I should sail to Mor∣row?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> In the Morning, a little after Sun∣rise.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> That if I went so soon, he could not tell whether he could be down so early; but if not, he would send a Slave down with a Goat to me, and some Milk; and if he should not see me before
<PB N="314" REF="323"/>
I went, he wish'd me a good Voyage, and hoped when I came back again he should see me.</P>
<P>So taking our Leave one of another, away went <HI>Singore Jorge</HI> to his House, and I on Board, where I slept without Disturbance.</P>
<P>In the Morning betimes came down two Slaves with a Goat, and two Calabashes of Milk for me; and told me, <HI>That their Master would go up on a Hill, where he could see me under Sail.</HI></P>
<P>I would have sent a Water-Melon, and a <HI>Fogo∣fogo</HI> to old <HI>Singore Jorge</HI> the <HI>Jhuiss;</HI> but the Black Slaves said their Master order'd them not to take any thing.</P>
<P><HI>The Day being a fine Day, I weigh'd, and sail'd from this Bay, which, for want of another Name, I call'd</HI> Porto Jorge; <HI>for I had ask'd the old Gentleman,</HI> What they call'd this Road? And <HI>he said,</HI> That he never had seen, nor heard of any Vessels being in it before; and thought that the Rocks which lay off in the Sea, made it dangerous to come in, and no Vessel ever being in it afore, he believ'd was the Reason it never had a Name.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> With his Leave I would give it a Name.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> If I would, he would endeavour it should always go by that Name.</P>
<P>So I gave it the Name of <HI>Porto Singore Jorge;</HI> and I believe it goes by that Name still.</P>
<P>I got about the <HI>Bighude,</HI> which is the North-East Point of the Island of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> about Noon; the Wind was North-East, light Gales; and about two or three in the Evening I saw the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and <HI>Monte Pinosa</HI> bore South-East-by-East; but the Lee Tide set us away to the South∣ward apace: We fetch'd in, as nigh as I could guess, about the <HI>Calyete;</HI> but it being Night (or rather Morning, for it was between one and two when I got so close in, as to be oblig'd to tack off)
<PB N="315" REF="324"/>
and but a difficult Place to go in at, I dar'd not venture in in the Night; so I ply'd all Night; but, by the Time Day broke out, I was got about midway between the <HI>Calyete</HI> and the <HI>Porto Englese,</HI> which is the Road us'd by our Ships which go there to load Salt; for which Reason it is so call'd; tho' the Inhabitants have another Name among themselves, <HI>viz. Yingdoss,</HI> and only call it <HI>Porto Englese</HI> when they speak to <HI>Euro∣peans.</HI></P>
<P>Finding it would be very tedious to beat up again, because the Flood Tide runs nothing at all there; but the Ebb, which is the Lee Tide, sets strong, I bore away for <HI>Yingdoss,</HI> and anchor'd there in four Fathom, in the Middle of the Bay: But no Ships being there, and the Surff running so high on the Shore, that we could do nothing at that Place, I was forc'd to weigh, and beat up to <HI>Kalyete</HI> or <HI>Paaseco,</HI> which lies to Windward of <HI>Calyete;</HI> and this cost me two Days; and finding that also not convenient for landing my Things, and that it was a long Way from the Salt Pans; after I had been to pay my Compliment to Cap∣tain <HI>Vicente Alba vel Alva,</HI> who was come down to see me, I return'd on Board, weigh'd, and run down to the <HI>Calyete,</HI> and there anchor'd, and dis∣pos'd of my Things, and had Salt brought to me there by the Natives, for which I paid with some of my Cargo that I had brought from St. <HI>John</HI>'s and St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I cannot tell justly who was the Author, but a Notion my Mariners all had, that I took in this Salt, to carry it, and them, to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where they must be Slaves during their Lives, gave me a great deal of Perplexity at this Place: Neither was it in my Power to convince them of the con∣trary, and accordingly they all to a Man left me, and went ashore.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325"/>
And now I was in a scurvy Condition; I had barter'd away almost all my Provisions for Salt; there raged a severe Famine at this Island, inso∣much, that some of the Inhabitants were ready to be famish'd; and I could not expect, if it had been in their Power, that they would treat me as I was us'd at St. <HI>John</HI>'s, or St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s; and yet I had not Help enough to get my Anchor up, or venture to run for St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which then was very plentiful and fertile, tho' before, for three Years past, they had suffer'd a sore Famine also.</P>
<P><HI>At length two Blacks came and offer'd their Service to go with me; one was a Native of St.</HI> Nicholas, <HI>and told me,</HI> That he came from thence about ten Months before in an <HI>English</HI> Ship; but the Captain not proving so kind to him as he expected, he left him at this Island, where he had been about eight Months, and was almost starv'd since he came here; and if I would take him, <HI>he said,</HI> he would never leave me.</P>
<P>Upon which I took him, being as glad of him, as he was of my Provisions.</P>
<P>The other was a Native of St. <HI>Anthonio,</HI> who also engag'd to go with me.</P>
<P><HI>The St.</HI> Anthonio <HI>Man told me,</HI> That I should make a better Hand if I went to St. <HI>Anthonio</HI> with my Salt; and to go from thence to the Isle of <HI>Sal,</HI> and take a Gang from St. <HI>Anthonio,</HI> to kill Turtle there, and sell them at the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which still was very scarce of Provisions.</P>
<P>I ask'd him, <HI>How long he had been from St.</HI> An∣thonio? He told me, <HI>About eight Months;</HI> so I concluded to take his Advice, if the Wind fa∣vour'd, to fetch these Islands; if not, I could but go to St. <HI>Jago</HI> at last, which I should always have under my Lee.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="326"/>
So we sail'd from <HI>Calyete</HI> in the Evening, and stretch'd to the Northward all Night, the Wind holding pretty much to the Northward, as North-East-by-North, and North-North-East, with light Winds, and a head Sea; so that when the Day broke out, the Northermost Point of St. <HI>Jago</HI> bore about West-North-West, about the Distance of five or six Leagues.</P>
<P>The light Winds still continuing, in which my Boat would do nothing with her small Sails, I was afraid of being sagg'd down so to Leeward, that I could not fetch either St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> or St. <HI>Antho∣nio,</HI> wherefore I was resolv'd to bear away to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which I did, and run for the North-East Point; and finding a large fair Bay, about two Leagues or something more to the Southward of the <HI>Bickude,</HI> which, for want of another Name, (there being no Inhabitants thereabouts to know, nor could I find from any others by what Name they call'd it) I call'd <HI>Porto sine Noma,</HI> or <HI>the nameless Road:</HI> I run in there, and anchor'd on the Northern or Weather Side of the Bay; for tho' it was a fair, large, and seem'd to be a clean Bay, with a large Beach or Strand of small pebble Stones, which most commonly denotes clean Ground, yet the Land was so high, that it made an eddy Wind blow right into the Bay; and tho' I had not shot in half Way to the Bot∣tom of the Bay, yet I found the eddy Winds blew right in on the Shore, and the Sun being past the Meridian, the Gale freshen'd on the Coast, and the Eddy, or counter Winds blew in the Bay proportionable in Strength: And being got so far in, that I could not weather the Southermost Point that made the Bay, I resolv'd to anchor in the first convenient Place I could under the High Land, on the North Side of the Bay, and wait for the Land Breeze in the Night, which is com∣mon,
<PB N="318" REF="327"/>
or if Calm, to row out; and finding a lit∣tle sandy Cove, I run for it, with an easy Sail, having lower'd down my Mainsail and Foresail, that by running slowly along, I might the better view, and find a convenient Place; and sounding with a Stone slung to a fishing Line, I found it was pretty steep, and was within a Stone's-Cast of the Strand of the little Cove before I had Ground.</P>
<P>I let go my Anchor about the Middle of the Cove, and the Wind not blowing right in, but slanting along down to the Bottom of the great Bay, the Vessel tailed towards the Westermost Point of the Rock that made the Cove; and after I had given a sufficient Scope of Cable, and brought up so nigh, that our Stern was about the Boat's Length from the Rock, it was pretty smooth Water, but the Flaws sometimes blew in pretty strong, tho' not so as to fear our Ground-Tackle holding.</P>
<P><HI>The St.</HI> Anthonio-<HI>Man told me,</HI> He did not like the Place, for it was the wildest Part of that Quarter where the Banditti inhabited.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> They could not hurt us, we having no Business ashore, and that I was resolv'd in the Night to go; <HI>with which he seem'd to be sa∣tisfy'd.</HI></P>
<P>They got the Pot on, and went to work to boil some Pompion and <HI>Sherree,</HI> (which is the largest Part of the Maiz when it's pounded, and when boil'd, something resembles boil'd Barley) de∣signing to make Pap, and I lay down to take a Nap while they got it ready; and had but just got asleep, when I was awak'd by Stones hove into the Vessel, whereof some of them fell on the Quarter Deck, under which I lay. I ask'd, <HI>What was the Matter?</HI> My Folks answer'd, <HI>They did not know; but a Parcel of Blacks ashore hove</HI>
<PB N="319" REF="328"/>
<HI>down Stones, and call'd us all the ill Names they could think of.</HI> I put my Head up the Scuttle abaft to see, and as soon as they espy'd me, slap came several Stones at me: I dodg'd under the Deck; and as soon as they ceas'd heaving Stones, I look'd up again, and in the St. <HI>Jago Creole</HI> Tongue ask'd them the Reason of using us so roughly? But they fell more furiously than at first to heav∣ing Stones, and some so large, that I was afraid they would sink the Boat, calling me all the Rogues, Thieves, and Picaroons, &amp;c. that their Malice was capable of expressing; and asking me, <HI>Whether I had a Mind to carry them away? And if I had there were Slaves enough present for me; and bid me come ashore like a Man-thieving Devil, and they were ready for me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I had no other Remedy, but to shield myself under the Deck again, till the Gust of their Fury was over, and they ceas'd to heave Stones; my Companions advising me, in their Fright, to cut the Cable, or get up the Anchor, and hurry away out of that dangerous Place, not considering that we could not stand upon Deck to weigh the An∣chor, or to do any thing towards endeavouring to get the Vessel away, either by Sails or Oars; be∣sides, the Wind blew right in on the Point of the Rock, and we had so little Room, that the Vessel, if we could or would expose ourselves, would be ashore before she could gather any Way; and the Rocks over us were moreover so high, that the Vessel was, as it were, under them, so that those Barbarians could almost tumble any Stone on Board, that they were capable of lifting.</P>
<P>As soon as I dar'd, I look'd up again; I begg'd of them to cease heaving Stones, and let me but speak to them; but they seem'd to be the more exasperated at me, and one hove a Stone so un∣expectedly, as I stood with my Head and from
<PB N="320" REF="329"/>
my Breast upwards above the Deck, that it had like to have put an End to my Life, for it fell on the Edge of the Scuttle, and there broke to Pieces; Part tumbling down, the rest lying on the half Deck. I dodg'd down, having receiv'd no Hurt, but pretty much scar'd; but they tumbled the Stones down so thick, that the half Deck was al∣most cover'd with them.</P>
<P>The Folks and the Boy shelter'd themselves for∣ward behind the Mast, and under the Forecastle, the little Boy frighten'd almost out of his Wits; as indeed, so were we all.</P>
<P>Looking from behind the Mast, after they had ceas'd heaving Stones, to see whether they were gone or no, one of them hove a great Stone, which struck against the Mast, and there shatter'd to small Pieces; upon which the Boy drop'd down under the Beam, and I thought the poor Child was kill'd, which he would undoubtedly, had the Stone hit him; but he receiv'd no harm, only dropping down, either with the Fright, or to shun the Danger, or both; but he could not tell when I ask'd him afterwards, <HI>What made him sink down?</HI> but said, <HI>He thought he should be kill'd; and that they all thought I had been kill'd by the Stone that fell on the Scuttle.</HI></P>
<P>The Quarter-Deck being open, having no Bulk-head, only at the Head of my Cabbin, so that I could see fore and aft, when I was under the Half-Deck; as soon as that Storm was over, and they ceas'd heaving Stones, I look'd up again; for as soon as they were quiet, I began to fear they would swim off and attempt to board us, which I was resolv'd not to suffer them to do, as long as I had Life or Strength to oppose them. I no sooner rais'd my Head in Sight, but slam came three or four Stones at me; but I prevented their hurting me by dropping under Deck: Some
<PB N="321" REF="330"/>
of them came down the Scuttle, and one of them glanc'd against my Ankle, which, tho' I felt no∣thing of it then, yet it pain'd me some time after.</P>
<P>When I found their Fury something abated, for they ceas'd heaving Stones as soon as I dived out of Sight, I look'd up again, and begg'd of them <HI>but to let me speak to them.</HI> They call'd me all to naught, and said, <HI>I was the Devil that com∣manded the other Devils, and bid me come ashore.</HI></P>
<P>I told them, <HI>I would, if they would first let me speak to them.</HI> They told me, <HI>No; I must come ashore,</HI> and fell a heaving Stones again; at which I secur'd myself again under the Deck.</P>
<P><HI>Then they call'd to me; but I made no Answer: They call'd several Times; and at last, they said,</HI> If I did not come up, they would tumble down Rocks and Stones till they fill'd or sunk the Vessel.</P>
<P><HI>I look'd up, and said,</HI> They would neither give me Liberty to speak, or come upon Deck, without running the Hazard of having my Brains knock'd out.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> They would heave no more Stones if I would come ashore.</P>
<P><HI>I said,</HI> I would in a very little Time; but that there was a sunken Rock, whereon was not Water enough yet for the Boat to sleet over; but that, as the Water was rising, I could in a little Time put the Boat to the Rock, and then I would come ashore to them.</P>
<P>This I only said to amuse them, to have an Opportunity to appease them; for there was no sunken Rock▪ it being steep too, at the rocky Point of the Cove whereon they stood tumbling Stones upon us.</P>
<P><HI>They bid me</HI> swim ashore. <HI>I told them,</HI> I could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> swim; but if they would have a little Patience till the Water flow'd, I would put the Boat to the
<PB N="322" REF="331"/>
Rock and go ashore to them, or they come on Board, which they pleas'd.</P>
<P>They ask'd, <HI>How long it would be?</HI> I told them, <HI>A very little Time.</HI> At which they seem'd easy, and sat down on the Rock.</P>
<P>I did not see above four there, but I could hear them speak to others, who were behind in a Clift of the Rock. I look'd very narrowly to see if they had any Fire Arms, but perceiv'd none; yet dar'd not to come up, standing in the Scuttle, ready to drop my Head down, if there should be Occasion.</P>
<P><HI>They ask'd me,</HI> What Countryman I was? <HI>I told them,</HI> I was an Englishman.</P>
<P><HI>They ask'd,</HI> If I was sent there by the King of <HI>Portugal? I told them,</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>They demanded,</HI> What I came there for? <HI>I told them,</HI> I was leaky, and wanted to hale ashore to stop my Leak; but as there was no convenient Place, I design'd to go to <HI>Porto Formosa,</HI> where was a more convenient Place to hale ashore.</P>
<P>By this Time the others behind the Rock came and sat down in Sight with the rest: I told fifteen, and could not tell whether there were any more; but I saw no Fire Arms among them, and was the more confirm'd in it, because I thought if they had any, they would have made use of them against us. They had most of them Lances and long Knives, such as that which <HI>Singore Jorge Vharela</HI> had, and some had Swords.</P>
<P>They call'd to me again, and ask'd, <HI>Why I did not come ashore?</HI> I told them, <HI>I would presently.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They seem'd very impatient; and told me,</HI> If I deferr'd coming any longer, they would heave Stones till they sunk the Boat.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I had done them no harm as yet, except they reckon'd my anchoring there was an In∣jury to them: That they had done me a great deal
<PB N="323" REF="332"/>
of Damage already, with their heaving Stones in the Vessel: That I came there with no Design to injure them, nor any Body else, but as a Friend, and for that Reason, I did not do myself that Justice which was in my Power to do, for the Abuse which they, without any Provocation, had treated me with: That I had Fire Arms and Ammunition enough on Board, to have laid them all dead; but supposing they might be mistaken, and believe me to be some other, who perhaps had deserv'd this ill Treatment at their Hands; That Consideration, <HI>said I, (tho' I had neither Gun nor Powder on Board; but since fair Means would not do, I was resolv'd, if possible, to frighten them)</HI> and the Esteem which I always had for Persons in your Condition, has de∣terr'd me from hurting you hitherto; but if, notwith∣standing, what I have said to you, will not prevent your future Incivilities, I must be forc'd, tho' against my Will, to do myself Justice with the Death of as many of you, as will presume farther to affront me.</P>
<P>At this they set up a hideous Hollow, casting Stones as fast as they could, calling to one ano∣ther to go home, and bring their <HI>Spring Guarda's,</HI> and fight for their Lives; I dived down as soon as I perceiv'd them take up the Stones, and shunn'd the Danger; my Men calling from afore to me, and telling me, <HI>We could expect nothing from them now but Death:</HI> And indeed I cannot say that my Expectation was of any thing else; but I was re∣solv'd to make the best I could of it, and bid my Folks hold their Tongues, and let me alone to manage them, and did not fear but we should do well enough.</P>
<P>As soon as their Fury was over, and they ceas'd heaving Stones, which lasted about half a Quar∣ter of an Hour, their Hearts I believe fail'd them, and they got all behind the Rock. I look'd up,
<PB N="324" REF="333"/>
but could not see one of them. I began to think they were gone; and looking sharp about, I per∣ceiv'd one of them peeping over the Rock. I was just going to speak, when slam came a Stone: I dived; but not finding that any more was com∣ing, I look'd up again, and took a Piece of a fishing Cane, which I had cut short for a Walking-Stick, and held it out as though it had been a Gun, and call'd to them, and told them, <HI>I was very loth to do them any Damage; and if I did, it would be much against my Inclination, because I had such an Esteem for all their Country, and was very well known and respected by some of the best</HI> Singores <HI>on that Part of the Island.</HI></P>
<P>I still kept my Eyes about me, lest they should go to their old Work of heaving Stones again: At last one of them spoke from behind the Rock, and ask'd me, <HI>If I knew any Body that liv'd on the Quarter of</HI> Terra-Fall? (for all that End of St. <HI>Jago</HI> is call'd the <HI>Quarter of Terra-Fall).</HI> I said, <HI>Yes.</HI></P>
<P>They call'd to me again; but I could not per∣ceive any body, by reason of the fear of my sup∣pos'd Gun, which I kept so that they could not discover the Cheat, and ask'd me, <HI>Who I knew in the Quarter of</HI> Terra-Fall?</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I knew <HI>Singore Juan Vharela,</HI> the Padre, and several others, <HI>(whose Names I had learn'd when I was at</HI> Porto Terra-Fall) and like∣wise <HI>Singore Jorge Vharela</HI> the <HI>Jhuiss,</HI> who had been very kind to me, and with whom I had a very great Friendship; and that I was to go to see him, as soon as I had stopp'd the Leak of my Vessel. <HI>At which they all started up, and ask'd me,</HI> If mine was the Vessel that had been at <HI>Singore Jhuiss's Porto?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="334"/>
<HI>I told them,</HI> Yes, I was the same; and was sure if <HI>Singore Jhuiss</HI> knew that I was there, and so affronted, that he would soon be there to assist me; and that it was the Respect I had for him, and my other good Friends in these Parts, made me not to revenge myself on them, knowing that what they did, must certainly be occasion'd through Mistake.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> It was very true, and they were very sorry they had affronted me so; and took me to be of that Sort of People call'd Pirates, and were afraid that I was either come to take them away for Slaves, or their Cattle for Food; or else, that I was sent by the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to apprehend some of them that were fled thither from the Oppressi∣on of the <HI>Ovidore,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Branca</HI>'s of the <HI>Cidade,</HI> i. e. <HI>the</HI> Portuguese <HI>living in or about the City; the</HI> Ovidore <HI>being the King of</HI> Portu∣gal<HI>'s chief Justiciary of all the</HI> Cape de Verd <HI>Islands, as well as of all the Coast of the main Continent of</HI> Guinea <HI>under his Authority.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I did not look like one upon either of those Designs, having no more than two Men and a little Boy with me.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They did not know but I might have had a great many Men hid under the Covert, (i. e. <HI>the Deck).</HI></P>
<P><HI>I ask'd them,</HI> If they thought so, how dar'd they to have come so nigh, sor fear of being shot.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They were sworn to oppose all that came to break the Privilege of the Place; and if I had fir'd at them, they would have kept close be∣hind the Rock, to keep us from getting up in the Country, and in the mean time would have sent Word up to raise the Country. And, <HI>continu'd they,</HI> we have already sent up to Town for more Help, and likewise Fire Arms; but since we understand who you are, we will send up to stop their coming down, and likewise sor something for a Present for you.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="335"/>
I thank'd them, and continu'd talking about one Thing or another, till the Messenger came back that they had sent, who brought a Calabash of Milk, and a large Cock and a Hen: They held them up, and shewing them to me, desir'd me to put the Vessel to the Rock to take them in.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I could not put the Vessel to the Rock without Danger of staving her.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They would not have me come to any Damage for ever so much; but hoped I was not afraid that they would hurt me.</P>
<P>I told them, <HI>No not at all</HI> (tho' I did not much care for trusting them).</P>
<P>They bid me send one of my Mariners ashore for the Present.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> None of my Mariners could swim; that when I was at <HI>Singore Jhuiss's</HI> Port, his Slaves were forc'd to swim off with <HI>Singore Jhuiss</HI>'s Pre∣sents, and likewise carry what Presents I made him ashore, because none of my People could swim; and when I went ashore to him, I was forc'd to put the Vessel ashore; which I could do safe enough there, by reason it was a much better Port than this; but if one of them would bring their Present off, I would see for something to send with him ashore, in return of their Kindness.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They did not desire any thing; they were very sorry for the Abuse they had given me, and thought they were highly oblig'd to me for being so generously reconcil'd to them, and hop'd they had not done the Vessel any Damage.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> They had not; <HI>which if they had, I should not have told them; and said,</HI> That I hoped they were not afraid that I would be so base as to do them any Harm.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="336"/>
They said, <HI>No;</HI> but yet did not seem very will∣ing to venture to come on Board.</P>
<P><HI>At last a lusty grim-look'd Fellow said,</HI> If I would put the Boat in at the Beach, so that he could wade in, he would come; but, <HI>said he,</HI> I can't nor I won't swim.</P>
<P>It being now almost Sun-set, and the Wind much less in the Offing, so that the Eddy-Flaws were now but weak, insomuch, that I could easi∣ly, by veering Cable, back her Stern to the Beach, and likewise there they could not do me much Damage, as being farther from the Rock, than as I rid; I told him, <HI>I would:</HI> So getting out two Oars, and veering Cable, and backing her Stern too with our Oars, till I could get Ground with a short Oar, I set her in as nigh as I thought fit, and then bid him come; who was got down the Rock, and stood on the Beach, armed with his Lance, Sword, and long Knife.</P>
<P>I bid him leave his Lance on the Beach, as being troublesome as well as needless to wade off with. He, with a hesitating Unwillingness, at last did, and waded off with his Sword, Knife, Cala∣bash of Milk, and the two Fowls, holding them up that they should not be wet, and waded till the Water was as high as his Navel, and then stopp'd, and bid me put the Boat nigher in. I call'd to the Boy in <HI>English, not to veer any more Cable, and set her in till the Cable was taut,</HI> and bid my Guest wade on.</P>
<P>He came, and by that Time he was got to the Boat's Stern, was up to the Arms. I told him, <HI>The Boat would not fleet any further in;</HI> so he handed me the Milk and Fowls, and then would fain have got up with his Sword and Knife in his Hand. I told him, <HI>He need not fear to trust me with them.</HI> He saw he could not get up with them in his Hand, and yet was very loth to trust
<PB N="328" REF="337"/>
me with them; however, with abundance of Diffi∣dence, he handed his Sword up to me, and en∣deavour'd to get up with his Knife in his Hand, which they always trust to, as the surest Weapon; but finding he could not, at last he handed that to me also, and then I gave him an End of a Rope for a Man-Rope, by which he got up.</P>
<P>As soon as he got in on the Quarter-Deck, he saluted me with the usual Formalities, and pre∣tended they were very sorry for the Rudeness that they had offer'd to me. I told him, <HI>It was very well, I never bore any Malice, especially when I was injur'd by a Mistake, as I was satisfy'd this was.</HI></P>
<P>The Fellow ey'd his Sword and Knife in my Hand, but was afraid, I believe, to ask them of me: I observ'd it, but did not seem to take any Notice of it.</P>
<P><HI>I was puzzled what to give them; and ask'd,</HI> If they wanted any Salt? <HI>He said,</HI> No, they had Plenty of Salt; for they could get enough to serve them, made by the Sun on the Rocks; but he had heard, that there was a great Scarcity of Salt at the City; <HI>which I knew as well as he.</HI></P>
<P>The Fellow seem'd to be very uneasy, and offer'd to take his Sword; but I would not de∣liver it to him. He said, <HI>He wanted to go ashore.</HI> I told him, <HI>He should presently.</HI></P>
<P>I had a Felt Hat, which I had purchas'd at the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and having nothing else to give, I presented him with that, telling him, <HI>That was all that I had worth giving; but wish'd I had one for every one that was ashore.</HI> He said, <HI>It was very well.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, <HI>I had no particular Knowledge of any of them, and therefore gave it among them all, for them to do as they thought fit with:</HI> So he desir'd me to put the Boat in again, that he might go
<PB N="329" REF="338"/>
ashore. I ask'd him, <HI>Whether he could not swim?</HI> who said no; and so I put the Boat as nigh to the Beach as I thought fit, and then bid him get into the Water, and I would hand the Hat and his Arms to him, as soon as he was on the Ground.</P>
<P>I fix'd him a Man-Rope, and down he went by it; but by that Time his Feet touch'd the Bot∣tom, his Chin was in the Water, upon which he call'd out to put the Boat nigher in, or he could not get ashore. I bid him let go the Rope, and get ashore, and I would heave the Things to him ashore. He did so; but mutter'd as he went, and I believe he never expected to get his Arms again.</P>
<P>However, when he was got ashore, I hove the Things ashore, and they all return'd me Thanks, and said, they would bring me a fat Goat, and some more Milk down in the Morning. I thank'd them; and it being almost duskish, away they went, bidding me Adieu, telling me, that they would be down in the Morning betimes. I said it was very well.</P>
<P>I have been the more prolix in relating this, because I do not know that I met with any thing in the whole of this Voyage, that appear'd to me more dangerous than this Adventure at first did; and I can't deny but it gave as great a Shock to my Courage, as any thing that I can remember in the whole Course of my Life.</P>
<P>The Night proving almost calm, I expected an off-shore Land-breese; and waiting till the Morn∣ing-Star rose, and no Land-breese coming, I drew up my Anchor, and rowed out, not caring to be caught among the Banditti another Day.</P>
<P>So we rowed out till we got into the true Wind, which was about the Break of Day, and I run down directly for <HI>Porto Formosa,</HI> and into the Head of the Bay.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="339"/>
Here I went ashore, and was met by <HI>Sin∣gore Antonio Thavaar,</HI> the principal Gentleman thereabouts, who was coming to see what Vessel it was that had enter'd into the Road: He was attended by eight Slaves with Lances, two had each of them a Pistol, which they are oblig'd to carry, being so near Neighbours to the <HI>Vhilhaucas</HI> of <HI>Terra-fall:</HI> And when I told him how I had been serv'd at <HI>Porto sine Noma,</HI> he cross'd himself, and said, <HI>It was the greatest Miracle in the World that we had not been all kill'd; and for his Part, he would not have been in my Place for the Island of St.</HI> Jago.</P>
<P><HI>This Gentleman is a White, of the Race of</HI> Portugal; <HI>and when I told him what I had got on Board, he said,</HI> That there was no body at this Port, but very poor black People, and had nothing to give me in return for my Salt. As for himself, <HI>he said,</HI> he had a small Place on his Estate, where his Slaves made Salt enough to serve him; but if I wanted any thing that he could help me to, he would freely do it.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, and he invited me up to his House, which was not far off the Water-side, where I was entertain'd very courteously. He would fain have had me to stay all Night; but I told him, <HI>I never lay out of my Vessel at Night;</HI> so he sent two Slaves to wait on me down, and loaded them with Cocoa-Nuts, Mand'yokes, and a live Goat to kill on Board.</P>
<P>Next Morning he sent down two Slaves with an Ass loaden with Provisions and Fruit, with an In∣vitation to come and dine with him.</P>
<P>I, designing to get a little Wood and Water here, sent Word up that I would; as soon as they were got home, one of them with a Horse was sent down for me.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="340"/>
When I came up, I ask'd the Gentleman leave to cut a little Wood. He told me, <HI>His Slaves should cut it for me, and carry it down.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I thank'd him, and said,</HI> My Folks had nothing else to do but to Wood, Water, and dress their Victuals.</P>
<P>He said, <HI>He had Slaves enough idle:</HI> So he or∣der'd half a Dozen of them to go and cut Wood, and carry it down with Asses, till the People of the Sloop said they had enough.</P>
<P><HI>In the Afternoon I took my Leave of him, tho' he would fain have had me staid till Night; but I told him,</HI> I wanted to be on Board to see that the Water was fill'd, and every thing got ready for sailing before the Day-breese came; for if I staid till it set in, I could not get out of the Port.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> I knew what I had to do better than he; but if my Business would have permitted it, he should have been very glad of my Company: <HI>So, after Com∣pliments pass'd, I took my leave.</HI></P>
<P>He sent a Slave down with me, and a little after came down two Slaves with a Bag of Feshoons, some Sherree, a Calabash of <HI>Mel, (i. e.</HI> Molossus) and half a Dozen of Cheeses, the six weighing about one Pound and half. I return'd him Thanks, which was all the Retaliation I could make, and I believe all the Gentleman desir'd.</P>
<P>Next Day, as soon as the Morning-Star ap∣pear'd, I weigh'd, and sail'd out of the Bay with a fine Land Air, and by dawning was got in the true Wind; and coasting along Shore, I run down the Length of St. <HI>Jago</HI> Town into the Bay, but did not observe any convenient Place that I could land at, the Suff running so high. My St. <HI>Antonio</HI>-Man was my chief Pilot, and I found him tolerably well acquainted with all the little Coves and Bays.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="341"/>
He told me, That a little farther was the best Port in all the Island of St. <HI>Jago.</HI> According to his Advice, I run down, and enter'd into the Harbour, which was as he had told me, and call'd <HI>Porto Madera.</HI> I moor'd there, my Anchor off, and a Rope fast ashore to a Rock, which was like a Key, having twelve Foot at low Water close to the Rock.</P>
<P>There being no Inhabitants living near the Port, and the Way but indifferent from thence to the Village of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> I coasted along down to <HI>Praya Formosa,</HI> and touch'd there, and at St. <HI>Domingo;</HI> from thence I proceed to <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> where I tarry'd some time, and receiv'd a Letter from the General of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands about a certain Business, and had a Man and Horse sent for me.</P>
<P>I rid to him to the Town from <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> leaving my Boat there. It's accounted about 20 Miles by Land; but a Man had better ride 40 in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>After the General and I had talk'd the Matter about which I came; being in Company, and talking about my</HI> Balandra, (i. e. <HI>Sloop, as they call'd it)</HI> Singore Pedro Balderavessa <HI>ask'd me,</HI> if she was capable of going to <HI>Guinea? I told him,</HI> She was not deck'd all over, but a small Charge would do it; and then she might go to <HI>Guinea</HI> well enough.</P>
<P><HI>He ask'd me,</HI> How many Slaves she could carry? <HI>I told him,</HI> About thirty at least.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> If I would bring her down to <HI>Calyete St. Martin,</HI> that he might see her, he would buy her all; or if I was minded to continue in her, which he would rather, I might hold what Part I pleas'd; and whatever was wanting to the fitting her for a <HI>Guinea</HI> Voyage, he would procure; as also a Cargo.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="342"/>
<HI>I told him,</HI> She was at a good Port now; and that if he pleas'd to give himself the Trouble to go and see her, I would rather than to bring her down; because <HI>Porto Lobo</HI> was more secure, especially now that it drew nigh the Season of shifting Winds and <HI>Travadoes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> That <HI>Calyete</HI> was always reckon'd the safest Port in all St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and that oftentimes when <HI>Brasile</HI> Men came thither in the rainy Season, they haled in there, where they lay secure from all Winds.</P>
<P>So I had a Horse back, and weighed from <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> and run the Coast down, rounding and taking a View of the Bays of St. <HI>Francisco,</HI> and <HI>Portate,</HI> in my Way; and by the Time that run the Length of <HI>Villa de Praya,</HI> I found I should not have Day-light enough to get into <HI>Calyete St. Martin,</HI> so I anchored there till next Morning, and then run for the <HI>Calyete;</HI> and after I had made her fast, I sent Word to Town of my Arri∣val, and had an Answer the same Evening from Signor <HI>Pedro Balderavessa, that he was a little indisposed by a Fall that he had received since he saw me; but had spoke to a Friend of his, whose Judg∣ment was better, who would come in the Morning to view my</HI> Balandra.</P>
<P>Accordingly his Friend came with another Gen∣tleman, who was Secretary of War: He had used the Sea, and I understood, that if I sold her out∣right, he was to be <HI>Singore</HI> Capiteen; but he gave such an ill Report of her to <HI>Singore Pedro Balde∣ravessa,</HI> that I question whether he would have ac∣cepted of her, if I had offered her for nothing.</P>
<P>The sickly Time of the Year now approaching, and, indeed, at that Time, excepting <HI>Cacheu,</HI> there are not many Places on the main Continent of <HI>Guinea,</HI> more sickly than St. <HI>Jago;</HI> and besides, it being the Time of Year that rarely any Ships
<PB N="334" REF="343"/>
touch here, I was resolved, if I could, to get to some of the windward Islands, especially to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> as well to shun the sickly Season at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> as also having a Prospect of sooner meeting with an <HI>European</HI> Ship to get from the Islands, the Season of the Year also concurring; for we expected a Southern Wind now, in a little Time; and I trucked my Salt away as fast as I could to get on the East Side of the Island, because from thence, I could not only better sail with a South∣erly or Westerly Wind, but the Roads are the safest also; for there is not one Road on the Lee-Side of the Island, that a Man can ride safe with a Westerly or South-West Wind, except <HI>Calyete St. Martin;</HI> but then, though you may ride safe, yet with those Winds you cannot get out; which, however, are the only fair Winds you have to run up to the windward Islands.</P>
<P>I soon trucked off my Salt, which the Inhabi∣tants were in great Scarcity of, for <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, Feshoons, and Mand'yoaks, which last, I sliced thin, and dried in the Sun to preserve them, which would then beat, or pound as fine, and look as white, as the best Flower, and, mixed with Maiz, would make good Bread; or boiled, would make good Pap, or Hasty-Pudding.</P>
<P>As soon as I had bartered off all my Salt, and got a pretty good Cargo of Maiz, Feshoons, Man∣d'yoaks, some Cocoa Nuts, Plantanes, Bananas, &amp;c. I sailed from <HI>Calyete St. Martin,</HI> and stopped at <HI>Porto Praya.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day it was calm, and in the After∣noon a great Swell rowled into the Bay from the South-West, which made me fear a Southerly Wind; but it being calm, and having but few Hands to row out; besides, Night being so nigh, I was necessitated to run the Hazard, by lying in the Bay all Night; though, to make my∣self
<PB N="335" REF="344"/>
as secure as I could, I run behind the little Island, and anchored in Two Fathom Water.</P>
<P>It held calm all Night, the Sea continued to foam in from the South-West, and looked very black in the Western Board; which were all Signs of a South, or South-westerly Wind: In the Morning at dawning, I weighed, and rowed out of the Bay, my Men spelling one another at one Oar, and I rowing at the other, the little Boy steering.</P>
<P>By the Time that we got the Length of the Southermost Point that makes the Bay, the Breeze appearing to come on the Water, we hoisted our Sails ready: It came on very weak; however, with the Wind, and the Help of our Oars to∣gether, we got the Length of <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> where I designed to have waited an Opportunity of a Wind to run for the windward Islands, and, if possible, to touch first at <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> where I knew there was a good Market for Provisions; but the Northern Stream being just made, and the Wind beginning to freshen up at South-East, I changed my Resolution, and stood for <HI>Porto Madera,</HI> where I arrived, and moored before Night.</P>
<P>Here I waited Eight Days, and then having a Southerly Wind, which came pretty fresh, I sailed from <HI>Porto Madera,</HI> and stretched over for the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and about duskish, I was abreast of the <HI>Calyete,</HI> about Two Leagues offing.</P>
<P>The Islanders saw me, and, I suppose, being in Hopes I was bound to their Island, they made a Light for me at the <HI>Calyete;</HI> but perceiving me pass that Place, and keep still to the East∣ward, they put out the Light, and made a great Fire at <HI>Paa Seco.</HI></P>
<P>I kept on my Course to the Eastward, and when I came abreast of <HI>Navia Coveraada,</HI> I saw another great Fire made there also.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="345"/>
I still kept on to Eastward, till I thought I was past the <HI>Ghalloons,</HI> which is a Ledge of sunken Rocks stretching a long way off, from the North-East Side of the Island; and then I steered as di∣rect as I could, for <HI>Calyete St. Jorge,</HI> at <HI>Bona Vist.</HI></P>
<P>As Night came on, the Gale decreased, and by Two or Three of the Clock in the Morning, it was dwindled away to a flat Calm.</P>
<P>When Day broke out, <HI>Monta Pinose</HI> bore about West-South-West, and I computed myself to be about Four Leagues, or better, from the nighest Part of the Island; I could plainly see <HI>Bona Vista,</HI> but after the Sun-rise, it disappeared.</P>
<P>I lay driving in that Channel between the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> about Three Weeks, with variable light Airs of Wind, mostly calm; at last I got on the North-East Side of the Island, and thought to have gone round that Way, and so come to the <HI>Porto Englese;</HI> but the Wind and the Current so baffled me, together with the Dulness of my Frigot's Heels, that I was hooked in behind the North-East Point; and the Eastern Trade∣wind blowing, I was forced to bear away round the South-End of the Island, by which Means I had an Opportunity of observing the <HI>Reef,</HI> or, as the Pilots call it, a River which runs off a great Way from the Land, at least One League and a Half, and so far off, I believe, I saw the Sea break: It's a Ledge of sunken Rocks, and great Stones; and from a Mile distance off, to the Shore, are several Swatches and Channels to go through, having Water enough for any Ship: There was a great rowling Swell, and the Wind freshened up, veering to the South-East, which made the Sea break where, I believe, there might be Two▪ or Three Fathoms, or, perhaps, more, Water, where I went over.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="346"/>
I thought I was without the Ledge, but just before I was got the Length of it, I saw the Sea break very high, as though it beat against a Rock, which did not a little surprize me; for I was shot so far on, that I could not luff up enough to wea∣ther it, and when the great Seas came on, they broke, seemingly, to me, every where on it, be∣tween me and the Shore.</P>
<P>I run for the smoothest Place; the Sea foamed, and rowled as if it was going to break, but did not; I sounded going over, and the least Water I had on it, was better than Four Fathom.</P>
<P>I got into <HI>Calyete St. George</HI> that Evening; the Night proved rainy, with Thunder, and abun∣dance of Lightening, the Wind being from the South-South-East, to the South-West, and then flew about to the West-North-West, and North, and then cleared up.</P>
<P>We rid pretty smooth, the Sands and Rock keeping off the Sea, though it blew pretty hard, while the Wind was at South-South-East, and South-South-West.</P>
<P>I lay there Two Days; but there being no con∣venient Key or Rock to land at, I took the first Opportunity, and got up to the <HI>English</HI> Road, where was a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Lanch, which the Pirates had left there, and gave her to <HI>Domingo Gonsalvo,</HI> who lent her to me.</P>
<P>Having launched and brought her on Board, I employed People to get me a Cargo of Salt, and bring it down as fast as they could; which they could not do very fast, the late Rains having melted all the Salt in the Pans; however, they went to work, cleared the Pans of the Rain Wa∣ter, and filled them up with Pickle; and, in about Three Weeks Time, I got Salt enough made, and heaped up; but the Way was so wet and slippery with the frequent Rains, that the
<PB N="338" REF="347"/>
Asses could hardly go, for it was then the Middle of <HI>August,</HI> 1724; and about this Time we saw a Sail, which came into the Road where I was, which proved to be a Sloop belonging to <HI>Bristol,</HI> commanded by Captain—Who had the Bishop of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and the <HI>Visitador General,</HI> with their Attendance, on Board, and were going their Visitation round the Islands; and after that, the <HI>Visitador</HI> was to visit all the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> under the Authority of the King of <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>When they saw me, it daunted them, they thinking I was a Pirate; for seldom, and very rare, any Ships touch at these Islands at this Time of the Year.</P>
<P>The Captain, to be better informed, sent his Yawl on Board; and he told me afterwards, if I had detained his Boat, or that he saw me get under Sail, he would have stood off, and prepared for Defence.</P>
<P>She was a stout Sloop, had Eight Guns, and Sixteen Hands, and, if I be not deceived, the Captain was a Man of Courage.</P>
<P>As soon as the Boat came on Board, I was not a little rejoiced to hear Men speaking my Native Language; they asked me, <HI>Where I belonged to?</HI> I told them <HI>what I was,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> Their Captain gave his Service to me, and desired my Company on Board.</P>
<P><HI>I answered,</HI> That as soon as their Sloop came to an Anchor, I would go on Board.</P>
<P><HI>They told▪me</HI> what they were apprehensive I was, and that their Captain was afraid to anchor, till he was better informed.</P>
<P><HI>I seeing they had no Arms, did not much mistrust them; however, I did not care to ven∣ture, till I was sure; so I told them,</HI> They saw what I was, but I did not know what they were;
<PB N="339" REF="348"/>
but would have them go on Board, and give my Service to their Captain, and tell him, I would wait on him, as soon as he came to Anchor, if he pleased to send his Boat, for I had none; <HI>so away they went, and, I suppose, told him what I said.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He immediately sent the Boat for me again, to desire me</HI> to do him the Favour to come and anchor his Vessel in the best Birth of the Road, for he was not acquainted with it, neither had he any one on Board that was.</P>
<P>When I saw the Boat coming again the Second Time, I began to fear they were Rogues, for he had a Jack Ensign and Pendant flying, which made him look the more suspicious.</P>
<P>When the Boat came on Board, they told me their Errand; so I went with them, and anchored the Vessel in a good Birth; the Bishop, &amp;c. was put ashore directly; after which, the Captain and I had Leisure to talk.</P>
<P>I gave him an Account what I was, and the Occasion of my being in that Condition, &amp;c. He was very courteous to me, and offered to do any thing for me, that lay in his Power: I told him my Design of taking Salt in for St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> &amp;c. he told me, His People and Boat should put it on Board of me, and gave me some thin Canvas to mend my Sails with, and a Piece of an old Hawser about Fifteen Fathom long, and made me lie on Board with him all the Time he stayed.</P>
<P>He would fain have had me gone with him, which I was very willing to do, till I came to under∣stand the Design of the Voyage, which would no ways agree with what you may call humane or universal Justice, neither was it safe; however, I shall not, as not thinking it proper, say any more of it; and this is the only Reason why I have not mentioned the Gentleman's Name.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="349"/>
He had a good Stock of every thing usually carried to Sea, as Wine, Brandy, Sugar, &amp;c. and he was of a very free and generous Disposition, and I fared, you must think, after another Rate than I had done for a long Time past; however, at first I was very cautious and sparing, both as to my Eating and Drinking, for fear it might stir up too quick a Ferment in the fluid Parts of my Body, by the unusual Addition of such hot active Spirits, as good Eating and Drinking commonly produce; but notwithstanding my Caution, the new Diet, and spirituous Drink, caused an Agi∣tation, or Ferment, though insensible, till it came to the Heighth of a Fever, which increased daily.</P>
<P>He would not let me go from on Board of him, and used me as tender, as if I had been a near Relation, sending the Boat with his Second Mate, to put the Salt on Board my Boat; and likewise to see and put every thing in order; he also of∣fered me to send his Second Mate in my Boat, with some Hands, and I to stay on Board of him, where I could have any thing, and be better tend∣ed, than on Board my owh Vessel; but then I considered the Unhealthiness of St. <HI>Jago</HI> at that Time, which was as if a Man was to go to a Country where the Plague raged; likewise he was to sail in a Day or Two, and was resolved not to lie at St. <HI>Jago</HI> above Twenty-four Hours, as well to avoid the Contagion which then began to rage, as likewise the Danger of the Southerly and Westerly Winds blowing; though, as to the last, I could have secured myself, by running into the <HI>Calyete St. Martin,</HI> but then I should have been in the most sickly Part of the Island.</P>
<P>He would fain have persuaded me to have quitted the Boat, and offered me Encouragement sufficient to have induced me to do so; but that,
<PB N="341" REF="350"/>
as I observed to you before, I thought the Enter∣prize he designed to go upon, neither safe, nor agreeable to the Notion I had of common Justice, whatever it might be to another.</P>
<P>The Reader may, perhaps, think it was Pyracy the Gentleman was designed for; but I do assure him, it was not.</P>
<P>I staid on Board of him, till the Bishop, Visi∣tador, and all his Passengers, were on Board, and he unmoored, and short on his other Anchor; for, he said, I should stay to the last Minute that he stayed: He bid me take what Things I thought might be useful to me in my Illness, out of his Medicine Chest, which I did, <HI>viz.</HI> Some Sp. Sal Armoniack, Tinct. Antimonii, Ol. Sulph. Camp. and some Theriac. Andromachi, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>He bid me</HI> not spare any thing that I thought would be of Use to me.</P>
<P>I thanked him, and said, <HI>I hoped that would do;</HI> he bid me take a little <HI>Laudanum,</HI> I told him, <HI>Hardly any Preparation of</HI> Opium <HI>ever agreed with me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> He had some of <HI>Mathews</HI>'s Pill, which I had not seen; <HI>and I told him,</HI> If it was rightly prepared, I believed it was a good Medi∣cine.</P>
<P>He said, <HI>He believed the Preparation was good,</HI> and with that, gave me about Half an Ounce of it, and ordered some Bread to be put in the Boat for me, and a Dozen of Wine, Half a Dozen of Brandy, a Piece of a Loaf of Sugar, some Butter, Oatmeal, Flower, and what else he could then think would be necessary for me.</P>
<P><HI>The Bishop all the Time observing the Friend∣ship and Freedom between us, at last asked the Captain,</HI> Whether I was related to him? <HI>he an∣swered and said,</HI> Yes, I was a Christian, a Pro∣testant, a Man, a Countryman, and a better Man
<PB N="342" REF="351"/>
than he, though I had had the Misfortune of falling into the Hands of Pyrates; and that his Countrymen always used one another so.</P>
<P>After I had taken my Leave, I went into the Boat, and was put on Board my own Vessel; and as soon as they returned on Board, he weighed, and sailed.</P>
<P>The Evening following, I also sailed for St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which was the principal Island for Asses, and that was the first Commodity Ships came to trade for in those Parts, and most an end a Ship touched at St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> for Asses, in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> or <HI>December;</HI> and those that came in <HI>January,</HI> commonly loaded Salt.</P>
<P>I made St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in the Morning about Six of the Clock; the Wind was about South-West, and looked very dark and rainy, as well as windy∣like, which made me loth to venture in, all the Roads of that Island being open to those Winds; so I brought too, to consider what to do; we were then about Four Leagues off, I was very weak, but the Cold and Wet had abated the Heat of my Fever, together with the Care and Charge which I had upon me, as having no-body that I could trust.</P>
<P>After I brought too, it rained very hard, and blew, which held till about Four in the Afternoon, then the Wind veering about to the North-West, North-North-West, and at last to the North, and clearing up, promised a fine, moderate, pleasant Night; upon which I resolved to run in a Cove, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Porto Ghuy,</HI> which I judged better, as having less Sea tumbling in, than at <HI>Paraghesi.</HI></P>
<P>If it had continued untoward Weather, my Design was to run for the Island of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> where there is both a safe and secure Harbour for all Winds; but there being no Inhabitants, and I
<PB N="343" REF="352"/>
being very ill and weak, if I grew never so little worse, I should have been rendered un∣capable of getting my Boat back, I having no∣body that I could trust to: But the Weather breaking up, and promising well, I run for <HI>Porto Ghuy,</HI> and got in and anchored, about an Hour after Night.</P>
<P>There were some of the St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> People out there a fishing, and they had got a Fire in a small Cave a little Way up from the Sea. As soon as we anchored, Two of them came down to the Sea Side and haled us; I answered, and told them who I was; they knew me, and immediately swam off on Board, and were glad to see me, and said, <HI>They all thought the little Boy and I had been drowned; and so did my Boy that I had left on the Island, but were sorry to see me in that weak Condition;</HI> adding, <HI>That they wondered to see me come into that Road, especially in the Night, for they never saw any Stranger come in there before.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> That I had seen the <HI>Peek</HI> over the Port, plain before Night; and that I remembered it very well, ever since it was shewed to me when I was at the Island before.</P>
<P>One of them swam ashore, and brought me a Cag of sweet Water off, which I much longed and wished for; the Water at <HI>Bona Vist</HI> being brackish, unless a Man brought it down Six or Eight Miles.</P>
<P>After they had staid a little, and talked, they swam ashore to their Consorts.</P>
<P>It held moderate clear Weather till after Mid∣night, and then thickened, and about Three or Four a Clock, it rained so hard, that notwith∣standing the Sea that rowled in, and made a great Noise beating against the Rocks, yet we could for all that, hear the Rain Water running from the Mountains, and falling down the Rocks very
<PB N="344" REF="353"/>
plain: It also thundered and lightened very much, yet the Wind continued fresh Northerly, and to the North-North-East, which turned the South-West Sea, and made a pretty smooth Sea on the South Side of the Island.</P>
<P>After Eight Minutes it cleared up, and proved a fine clear Day, with a moderate Gale at North-North-East, and promised fair settled Weather.</P>
<P>About Four in the Evening, I weighed, and sailed from <HI>Porto Ghuy,</HI> with a light Off-shore Wind; and when we got a breast of <HI>Porto Lappa,</HI> it fell calm, and about Two after Midnight, sprung up a moderate Gale at North-East-and-by-North.</P>
<P>Fearing I might miss the Port of <HI>Paraghesi,</HI> it being very difficult to know it in the Night; I run down close to the Shore, and now and then made one of my Mariners sound; for there was a Sand-Bank lay about Half a League short of <HI>Paraghesi,</HI> having about Four or Five Fathom Water on it, and reached about Half a Mile off from the Rocks, and was about One fourth of a Mile long; my Design was to anchor there till Day-light, if I could find it, and as soon as Day broke out, to run to <HI>Paraghesi:</HI> By good Fortune, with Care, I found it, and anchored on it in Four Fathom; and in the Morning, the Weather still continuing as above, as well as likely to be, fair and settled, I took up my Anchor, and run into <HI>Paraghesi,</HI> and let go my Anchor off, and an End of a Rope fast ashore.</P>
<P>There were abundance of People down to re∣ceive and welcome me, who had been informed by some of those that had been at the <HI>Ghuy</HI> a fishing, that it was I, and that I had Salt in to truck away for Maiz; and several of them had brought Maiz down with them to exchange with me for my Salt; and they told me, <HI>That most</HI>
<PB N="345" REF="354"/>
<HI>of the Islanders would be down to exchange Maiz for Salt.</HI></P>
<P>You must know, that it being now the Turtle-Season, and the People of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> catching and salting that amphibious Creature, and using it more than any of those Islands do; and having besides, no Salt Pans, and very little made on the Rocks; and those Rocks where that little is made, being so difficult, as well as dangerous, to go down, that very few of the Inhabitants care for venturing, there being Two Men killed attempting to go seek for Salt, while I was on the Island; All these Reasons made it a very valuable Com∣modity on that Island at this Time: And they asked me, <HI>How I would dispose of my Salt?</HI> I told them, <HI>Measure for Measure,</HI> which they agreed to, and all that had Corn down, brought it on Board, and shot it on the Fore-Castle, I haling the Vessel close to the Rock, where it is Two Fathom and a Half at Low Water, and at high Water, at ordi∣nary Tides, the Rock is about Four or Five Foot above the Surface of the Water, and flat on the Top like a Key, which the Inhabitants call <HI>Kaay,</HI> and is a general Name they give to all convenient Rocks for landing at.</P>
<P>The Wind veering to the North-East, the Sky towards Noon became over-cast, as it often is with the Trade Wind, and looked fair Weather∣like; but my Fear and Care being over, now I was got into a Harbour, &amp;c. I found, that as my Dangers decreased, so the Sense of my Sick∣ness returned, and what with the Noise and Cabal of those People, &amp;c. I was forced to lie down: The Boy also was ill, though nothing nigh so bad as I; and the Natives said, <HI>That it was better to have me ashore, where I might have a Fire made me in a Cave, which was in Sight of the Boat, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve a Bed made me of dried Grass,</HI> &amp;c. So my
<PB N="346" REF="355"/>
St. <HI>Antonio</HI> Man, whom I always found to be a sensible, careful, as well as an honest, and affe∣ctionate Man to me, said, <HI>That if I pleased to entrust him, he would take Care to measure out all the Salt, and take the same Measure of Maiz for me, as well as if I was present; and that it would be more quiet for me to be ashore, where I might have a warm Cave to shelter me from the Wind and Cold; and have a Fire, and a good soft Bed of dry Grass.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> Whether I went ashore, or staid on Board, I was so weak, that I must trust him; but if I was never so well, I should not question his Justness, were it a Cargo of twice the Value of what I now had.</P>
<P><HI>The rest that were by, and heard my Answer, without asking me, or saying any thing to me, took me up, and carried me ashore to the Cave, and got me a Bed of dry Grass, made a Fire, and would fain have made me some Pap, but I would not let them; I had a violent hot Fever, and a little after I was laid there, the St.</HI> Antonio <HI>Man came and told me,</HI> The Forecastle was full of Corn, and a great deal on the Quarter Deck; and if I thought well of it, he was of Opinion, it would be better to put the rest of the Maiz in some clean Cleft, or Hollow of a Rock, till I thought fit to put it on Board. <HI>Adding,</HI> That there was Maiz enough down to purchase all the Salt, and that they might shoot the Remainder in the Hollow of a Rock, and then he could measure them out their Salt, and did not fear but to clear the Boat of all her Salt before Night, which, if we did not, he was afraid a great deal would be wasted with the Rain; for, he believed, we should have as much, or more Rain, than we had the former Night.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="356"/>
<HI>I said,</HI> If it turned to Rain again, I much feared we should have a Southerly Wind, and then we should lose our Boat.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> There was no Fear of that; for every∣body, and all the old People said, It would be a Northern Rain.</P>
<P>I desired him to help me down to the <HI>Kaay,</HI> and I would direct to make the Boat as securely fast as possibly we could.</P>
<P>He said, <HI>He would call some to help him,</HI> which he did, and one took me under one Arm, and another under the other, and helped me down.</P>
<P><HI>It beginning to rain small Rain already, I much feared a Southerly, or Westerly Wind, which was all the Wind that could hurt me; the Blacks said,</HI> I need not fear that, <HI>and shewing me a Sugar-Loaf-like Hill, called,</HI> Monte Fradre, <HI>told me,</HI> That misty Cap which the Top of it was covered with, was always a Sign of a Northerly Wind; and that all the Clouds and Rain came from the Northern Board; but be it how it would, it was not in my Power then, to avoid it.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> We must trust to God for the Wea∣ther, and all that could be done, was, to secure and make her as fast as we could.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> Any thing that I bid them, that they could, they would do with all their Hearts.</P>
<P>I told them to <HI>bring the End of the great Cable ashore</HI> (which was a Piece of a large Hawser, about Fifteen Fathom long, which the <HI>Bristol</HI> Cap∣tain gave me at <HI>Bona Vist) and I would shew them how, and where to make it fast;</HI> which accordingly they did, and made it fast to a strong Nob of a Rock, and the other End was made fast on Board forward, but slack, to be ready, if it should blow, to cast off the Stern-fast, and let her swing Head to the Wind, and so ride between the Anchor, and the Shore-hawser.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="357"/>
A young Man, who said he had been taken by Captain <HI>Loe</HI> coming from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and some Months past, had escaped from him at the Island of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> while <HI>Loe</HI> was there a cleaning and refitting the <HI>Merry Christmas,</HI> a Ship belonging to <HI>London,</HI> which he had taken coming from <HI>Virgi∣nia;</HI> this young Man, who told me his Name was <HI>George,</HI> and was born in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> said, He would lie in the Vessel all Night: I ordered them to save a Barrel of Salt, which I designed for Pre∣sents to the Priest, Governor, &amp;c. which they did, and bartered all the rest of the Salt for Maiz, and some Feshoons.</P>
<P>I was carried up to the Cave again after the Boat was secured; the Boy, being better than in the Morning, chose to be with <HI>George</HI> on Board; and they brought most of my Cloaths ashore to the Cave.</P>
<P>About (as nigh as I could guess) Eight of the Clock at Night, the Wind veered to the South-East, and blowing and raining very hard, I came down to the Rock Side, and made one of the Blacks call to him on Board, to veer more upon the Anchor Cable; but could not make him hear. The Sea run very high, and the Wind veered to the South-South-East and South, and I was un∣easy because she had so small a Scope of the An∣chor Cable out, and said, <HI>The Boat would be lost for want of veering Cable;</HI> for the Sea run so deep and hollow, that the Boat, with that short Scope, could not play, but fetched such Jirks, that either something must have given Way, or the Boat have sunk.</P>
<P><HI>The St.</HI> Antonio <HI>Man hearing me say so, told me,</HI> Rather than the Balandra which had carried us through so many Seas and Dangers, should be lost, for want of veering Cable, he would try to swim off on Board, come Life, come Death.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="358"/>
<HI>The Blacks that were present disswaded him all they could, telling him,</HI> That it was impossible for any Mortal to swim off in such a Sea; and besides, the Sea beat so powerfully against the Rocks, that it would be impossible but that he should be dash'd into a thousand Pieces against them, if he attempt∣ed it.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> Had the Captain been so kind to him to bring him here, and should he be afraid to hazard his Life to serve him? no, <HI>he said,</HI> it should never be said; <HI>and down he went to the Rocks Edge, and watch'd an Opportunity of the smoothest Sea, and darted himself into it, and got on Board.</HI></P>
<P>It was not from the <HI>Kaay</HI> that he leap'd, for that now was overwhelm'd every Sea; but the Rock that he jump'd off, was farther in the Bay, and where he jump'd from, was at least 50 Foot above the Surface of the Water.</P>
<P>Just afore he jump'd in the Sea, a Sea wash'd over the Bow, that frighten'd <HI>George</HI> and the Boy: I heard the Boy cry out, though <HI>George</HI> could not hear me. As soon as the Black got on Board, he told <HI>George</HI> what I had order'd to do; but <HI>George</HI> seeing the Sea all of a foaming Breach a-Stern of him, and in the Night such Sights seem to be nigher to one than they really are, was afraid to veer any Cable, lest the Boat should be in the Breach of the Shore.</P>
<P><HI>The Black told him,</HI> That he could be in no Danger; for that the Wind blew right in on the Beach, and that the Sea, if any thing gave Way, would heave the Boat in a Manner dry up.</P>
<P>He had promis'd me before he went off, when he heard me wishing my Boy was safe ashore, that he would engage to bring him off safe, whatever befel the Vessel, or else that he would not come himself; and told <HI>George, He would take Care of the Boy,</HI> &amp;c. but all that he could urge or say to
<PB N="350" REF="359"/>
<HI>George,</HI> could not prevail with him to veer one Inch.</P>
<P>The Blacks from ashore call'd to the Boat; who were answer'd by the Black that swam off, <HI>That all was very well;</HI> but <HI>George</HI> made Answer, <HI>No, it was not very well, for they expected every Sea to be fill'd.</HI></P>
<P>My greatest Fear was of the Boy; and what with one Thing and another, the Sense of my Fever was gone; but I had such a Weakness, that all my Frights or Cares could not affect me so as to overcome it; and I could not get up, nor walk one Step, without being supported.</P>
<P>The Blacks perceiving my Concern much more for the Boy than for the Boat, as indeed it was, not so much mattering her now; for we were got on an Island, from whence we might expect a Deliverance, in as short a Time, as from any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands; the Blacks told me, <HI>I need not fear the Boy; for they were sure, let the</HI> Balandra <HI>come off how she would, that the Boy would be safe.</HI></P>
<P>The Wind increas'd, and consequently the Sea, which rowled right into the Cove; and though there is an Island or Rock, which you would think might break off the Fury of the Waves, as be∣ing then right to windward of the Boat, and in smooth Water, and above the Surface of the Water twelve or fourteen Foot; yet now it did not seem in the least to shelter, but the Sea seem'd to be rather worse by being broke, rowl∣ing in over the Rock, which very seldom now appear'd.</P>
<P>At last the Sea with the Wind increas'd so, that one would think it impossible for such a Vessel, or even any one, to hold out, or resist the raging Force of the Wind and Sea; which none can con∣ceive, but those whose Lot (or I might say Mis∣fortune)
<PB N="351" REF="360"/>
it is to be expos'd to the raging Force of those two Elements together. Soon after the Snore-fast gave way, and then she swung off, and rid in the Stream of her Anchor, and seem'd to ride more easy, and play with the Sea bet∣ter; and rid so about half an Hour, when a Sea came foaming in, as tho' it scorn'd to be oppos'd, even by the high mountainous Rocks themselves, and threatned to bear down all, as it were, before it, and to us seem'd to swallow up the poor Ves∣sel; for we did not see her for about the Space of a Minute.</P>
<P>The Consequence of it was, the Cable broke, and that Sea carry'd her up on the Beach so high, that she lay undisturb'd more than a Quarter of an Hour. As soon as she came ashore, they all got out of her, and in the Fright run up the Valley as high as the Rocks would let them; but when they recover'd from their Fright, and saw themselves safe, they return'd down again to the Boat, which lay all this Time quiet, as being out of the Reach of the Sea; <HI>George</HI> went on Board, and might have sav'd several odd Things, which I had pick'd up in the Time of my Pere∣grination in her; but while he was in her, a great Sea rowl'd on, which was only the Forerunner of a greater; for it only shock'd her; but so fright∣en'd <HI>George,</HI> and perhaps it would have done the same to any other, that he made all the Haste out he could, and brought nothing with him but a Bottle of that Wine, which my Friend had given me at <HI>Bona Vist.</HI></P>
<P>As I said, that Sea that shock'd the Vessel, was a Forerunner of a greater; for presently after <HI>George</HI> got ashore out of the Boat, a Sea came that stav'd her all to Pieces; the Blacks that were with me went down to them, and gather'd all the Pieces of Boards, and what else they could, that
<PB N="352" REF="361"/>
the Sea hove on to the Shore; and one of them brought the Boy up to the Cave to me, where we remain'd till Morning.</P>
<P>I was as wet all Night, sitting on the Rock to behold the Boat, with the Rain and Spray of the Sea being blown up by the Violence of the Wind, as if I had been come out of the Sea; and it doubtless did me a great deal of Harm, and per∣haps was one great Cause of that long and tedi∣ous Sickness, which held me till after my Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> and was a principal Cause of my having Leisure to write this History.</P>
<P>As soon as Day broke out, by which Time the Weather began to clear up, and be more mode∣rate, tho' a great Sea still run, I could behold the Ruins of my Eight (I might say Ten or Twelve) Months Labour, lying piled up on the Shore. With the Help of some of them, I was carry'd down the Rocks, and view'd what was sav'd, which was most Part of the Wreck, some Pieces of the Sails, one of my Iron Pots, an Ax, Saw, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>They told me,</HI> It was not proper nor safe for one in my Condition, to be there expos'd to the Cold and Wet, and wish'd what I had already suffer'd, did not prove of ill Consequence to me; and that it would be better for me to go to Town, and take Care of myself, and see and sell the Remains of my Boat, &amp;c. which they believ'd some of the Country People would buy to make Doors, &amp;c. for their Houses, and bid me not fear that any body would be so barbarous, as to wrong me of the least Bit of Wood.</P>
<P><HI>I told them,</HI> I did not trouble myself about that, as not being worth my taking Notice of: All that I was concern'd at, at present, was, how the little Boy and I should subsist till a Ship came here, wherein
<PB N="353" REF="362"/>
I might get a Passage to my own Country, or to some other Part where Ships more frequently trade.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> As for that, I need not fear but what I should meet with as good Entertainment as I did at St. <HI>John</HI>'s, saving, that they had not such Plenty of Flesh: But the Governor, <HI>said they,</HI> never wants Goats Flesh, and if you please, we know you may be welcome to lodge there; but let me live with whom I would, <HI>they said,</HI> they were sure that he would always send me wild Goat, more than I could eat.</P>
<P>I omitted to acquaint the Reader, that the Priest who was on the Island when I was taken by the Pirates, was exchang'd, and another, who also was sent from <HI>Portugal,</HI> plac'd there by the Bishop, who had touch'd here before he touch'd at <HI>Bona vist,</HI> and he was with the Bishop there, and very glad to see me, and gave me some Cloaths, and two Dollars in Money, and a Rug, a Pillow, and a Gun, which he had of mine along with him, when he was ashore at <HI>Currisal,</HI> when the Pirates took me; and also a Letter from him to the Padre who succeeded him at St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> he also procur'd a Letter from the Bishop to the two <HI>Fradre's</HI> who were at St. <HI>Anthonia,</HI> and govern'd that Island for the Marquess <HI>des Minhas,</HI> in Case I touch'd there, to do me all the good Offices which they could; both which Letters they brought me with my other Things, when I was carry'd ashore out of the Boat.</P>
<P>There was one of them that was down, had an Ass, and offer'd it to me to carry me up, and told me, <HI>I had best get up before the Sun rose too high; otherwise, as I was so weak, it would make me very faintish to go up in the Heat of the Day.</HI> He added, <HI>That if no other Asses came down, they would make shift and carry the Boy up after me:</HI> So I was mounted on the Ass, and three or four ac∣company'd
<PB N="354" REF="363"/>
me up, and one or more ran up to Town before, to give the Padre and Governor an Account of my Condition, and also of my com∣ing up.</P>
<P>I was met on the Way by <HI>Singore Nicholau Gonsalvo,</HI> with whom I had been acquainted be∣fore, whose Father had been formerly Governor of the Island: He was sorry for my Loss, I be∣lieve, with all his Heart, and testify'd so much by his Tears, and oblig'd me to promise to live with him till I had an Opportunity of meeting with a Ship to carry me off the Island.</P>
<P><HI>When I came up to Town, I rid directly to the Governor's House, who had made Prepara∣tion to receive me; and as soon as the Priest heard I was come, he came directly to welcome me to Town, as well as to condole with me in my Mis∣fortune. I told them,</HI> I thought the greatest of my present Misfortune was, my want of Health; and as for the Loss of the Boat, or any thing in her, I accounted it as nothing, she having already answer'd my Design in Building her, which was only to bring me off of that lonesome Island, where seldom any Ships came, to some Part where I might expect to meet with one; and hoped I was as likely to light of one here, as any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands.</P>
<P><HI>The Priest said,</HI> He hoped I should: That as for his Part, he was a greater Stranger to the Na∣ture of those Islands than I was, being but lately come from <HI>Portugal;</HI> but bid me rest assur'd, that during my stay there, I should want for nothing that the Island afforded, or was in his Power to do for me; and that he had often heard his Predecessor Padre <HI>Duego</HI> talk very respectfully of me; and as I was in the Governor's House, he would not af∣front him so much, to ask me to go and live with him.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="364"/>
<HI>The Governor said,</HI> He expected me to live with him, while I remain'd on the Island.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I must beg him not to take it amiss; for not having any personal Acquaintance with him, nor the Reverend Padre, I had already promis'd Sin∣gore <HI>Nicholau Gonsalvo,</HI> my old Acquaintance, to live with him.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor said, Singore Nicholau</HI> was a good Man; and since I had given him my Word to live with him, which he was sorry for, yet knowing that <HI>Englishmen</HI> are so fixt to their Word, that they will not be induc'd for any Advantage to break it, he would not insist upon perswading me to what he by long Experience knew to be the natural Disposi∣tion of all my Countrymen in general, and of me in a more especial Manner; for he had, <HI>he said,</HI> often heard Singore Padre <HI>Duego</HI> praise me, and say he believ'd I was one of the best <HI>Englishmen</HI> that ever he was acquainted with, and wanted nothing to make me a Saint upon Earth, but to be a Christian <HI>(meaning a Roman).</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told the Padre,</HI> That I believ'd I had a Letter for him from Padre <HI>Duego,</HI> and likewise had one from the Bishop for the <HI>Fradre's</HI> of St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> but did not know how they could come by it.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> One of them was here at St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> now, and he would send him to me, and desir'd to see that Letter that was for him.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I had it not about me, but Singore <HI>Nicholau Gonsalvo</HI> was gone down to <HI>Paraghesi,</HI> to fetch up my Things, and as soon as he was come back, I would send it to him.</P>
<P>By this Time the Victuals were ready, and brought to the Table, which were Fish, Fowls, Goats Flesh, Indian Corn Bread, Plantanes, Ba∣nana's, boil'd Pompion, &amp;c. the Fowls were bak'd in a Pot, and look'd very well, and as brown as if they had been roasted, and the Venison and
<PB N="356" REF="365"/>
Fish were boil'd, there was also a Calamow, which is a Calabash cut in two, and serves them in the room of Basons and Porengers; and this was brought to me full of Fish Water, being reckon'd by them the daintiest Mess they can give to a sick or weak Person; however, I could not drink or sup it, tho' I put the Calamow to my Head three or four Times without tasting it, because I would not have them think I slighted the sick Mess.</P>
<P>I eat a bit or two of the Fowl, and after Din∣ner lay down on a Bed, which was on Purpose set up for me.</P>
<P>In the Evening <HI>Nicholau</HI> came up, and having carry'd all my Things that he brought up to his House, he came to the Governor's, and acquaint∣ed me with what he had done; and I took my Leave of the Governor, and went to my Lodging, from whence I sent the Priest his Letter.</P>
<P>The next Day the <HI>Fradre</HI> came, and I deliver'd him the Letter, which I had for him from the Bishop; who, after he had read it, came to me, and took me by the Hand, and kiss'd it, and said, <HI>That he believ'd the Singore</HI> Bispo <HI>never writ such a Letter for any Man before; and ask'd me if I was acquainted with his</HI> Illustrissimo <HI>in</HI> Por∣tugal?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> The Singore <HI>Bispo</HI> knew me very well.</P>
<P>He said, <HI>He knew that by the Letter;</HI> and told mé, <HI>If I had come to St.</HI> Antonio <HI>with my</HI> Balan∣dra, <HI>with nothing in her, I might have loaded her with Maiz, Feshoon, or anything the Island afforded, and that gratis, and as often as I would;</HI> which he reported almost to every body; and shew'd the Letter to the Priest and Governor, wherein was an Order, that they should supply me with every thing that I wanted, which the Island afforded,
<PB N="357" REF="366"/>
and charge it all to his Account, which made me be, in a very extraordinary Manner, respected.</P>
<P>My Fever return'd on me again, and burned and raged violently about eight Days; and after that, especially in the Night, I us'd to sweat cold clammy Sweats, to such a Degree, that my Land∣lady one Morning, to try how much Sweat she could wring out, wrung the Bed Cloaths, which were Cotton, and she wrung more than fill'd a quarter of a Canada, which, of our Measure, is about three Eighths of a Pint; and doubtless there was more than that Quantity soak'd into the Cotton besides, which, in my Opinion, was ex∣cessive; and it may be beyond the Belief of some, but I am sure it was Fact.</P>
<P>After those sweating Fits were over, I used to be so weak for an Hour or two, that I could not stir, neither did I care for speaking. I could hear and apprehend distinctly what any body said, which before I made them sensible of it, they thought I was in fainting Fits, and senseless; but when they found it was not so, they were better satisfy'd.</P>
<P>I had dry Cloaths every Morning, and some∣times, when I sweat in the fore Part of the Night, which was but seldom, they used to shift my Bed Cloaths in the Night: My Landlord Singore <HI>Ni∣cholau Gonsalvo</HI> had Cotton Cloths enough, hav∣ing the best, and, I may say, the only good Cot∣ton Plantation on the Island; and as soon as ever the wet Cloaths were taken off, a Slave was sent to the River to wash them, that they might be ready to use when I had occasion for them.</P>
<P>I was in this Condition about a Fortnight after the burning Fever left me, and then my Sweats abated; and as they abated, which were very gradually, my Strength a little increas'd; but
<PB N="358" REF="367"/>
I recover'd my Spirits much sooner than my Strength.</P>
<P>Either the Priest, the Governor, the Fradre, or one or other of the Inhabitants, used to visit me every Day; and when I was in my weak Fits, they would never speak to me, only come and look at me, and ask my Landlord, Landlady, on whoever of the Family was in the Way, how I was, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After I began to be a little hearty, my Land∣lord ask'd me, <HI>What I would do with the Wreck that was sav'd?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> He might do what he pleas'd with it, and suppos'd there could not be much of it left, if it lay down there all this Time.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He was sure there was not one Piece of all that was sav'd diminish'd; for the Priest had charg'd them all publickly at Church, upon Pain of Excommunication, not to touch or take away the least Bit of Wood, or any thing else, and pronounc'd Dam∣nation to any one that would wrong me of so much as a Nail.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> If any of it would be of any Use or Service to him, to take out as much as he had occa∣sion for, as having most Right to it, and the rest I would give to my Friends that I was most obligated to, as he would advise and direct me.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> I had no Occasion to give one Bit away to any body; he could have sold it all while I was sick, but was loth to trouble me then, and would not dispose of it without my Order: <HI>And withal told me,</HI> That the Priest was minded to enlarge the Choir, and would have Occasion for all the Wreck, and bid me try what he would give me for it; and if he would give any thing handsome, he believ'd it would be my better Way to▪ sell it to him altogether, than have the Trouble to sell it in Parcels to the People; and tho' I might make more, yet it would
<PB N="359" REF="368"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e too troublesome for me to go down to <HI>Paraghesi,</HI> every Time that a Man came to buy a Testoon's worth of Stuff; and if I pleas'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would first tell the Priest about it, and inform him that I was a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le to dispose of it, and that talking would not preju∣dice me now; and desir'd me, if I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old it to him, to except a Piece which he made me understand was the B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om, because he wanted it to make a Ridge-Pole for his House.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would, and if there was any thing more which he thought he should have Occasion for, it should be also at his Service.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> No, he wanted only that, and he would not take it till it was valu'd by a Couple of Men, and would pay me the full Value.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would not take any thing of him, and he was welcome to all, or as much as he pleas'd.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> If I would not let him pay me for it, as much as I could have for it of any body else, he would not have it; but bid me sell it with the rest to the Priest.</P>
<P><HI>To please him, I was forc'd to say he should pay for it; and he spoke to the Priest about it, who came to me, and after we had talk'd about it, the Priest said,</HI> He did not know the Value of it; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut he would send down two old Men, who should value it according to their Conscience, and what they valu'd it at, he would give me, if I thought it sufficient; if not, I might dispose of it as I thought fit, and he would give free Liberty for any one to buy who had Occasion: <HI>Without which Liberty, no body dared buy any thing that the Priest bid Money for.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as the Priest had bid two Men to go down, and <HI>Nicholau</HI> understood who they were, he sent to them to come and speak with him at his House before they went down; which they
<PB N="360" REF="369"/>
did; and my Landlord told them, <HI>To act accord∣ing to their Conscience, and value the Things to the full Worth; for that it was publick Money that was to pay for it, and therefore could fall heavy on no particular body;</HI> adding, <HI>that I had had abun∣dance of Misfortunes,</HI> and enumerated as many as he knew, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They said they would consider it, and would value every thing to the utmost.</P>
<P><HI>When they return'd, and gave the Priest an Account, he came to me, and told me,</HI> That the two Men told him that the utmost of what all the Things were worth was ten Dollars, which he thought would not have come to above five; but since they had valu'd it so, and the People were willing, it being their Money that must pay for it, he being only Steward; and considering my Case, he would not abate me any thing of that Price, tho', according to the Inventory they gave him of the Goods, he thought, as he said before, it was more than they were worth by one half.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> There was one Piece, which was my Boom, that I would reserve to myself for a particu∣lar Use.</P>
<P>He look'd in his Inventory, and shew'd to me where they had noted it by the Name of <HI>Ballan∣ceen,</HI> which in their Language signifies a <HI>Boom,</HI> and was rated a Dollar, and told me, <HI>If I kept that, I must abate a Dollar, and take nine Dollars for the Remainder.</HI></P>
<P>My Landlord, who was present all the Time, made Signs at me, for he durst not speak, not to agree to that.</P>
<P>I was not certain what he meant, but gave a right guess; and told the Priest, <HI>That I would con∣sider of it, and give him an Answer to Morrow:</HI> He said, <HI>It was very well;</HI> and ask'd me, <HI>If I</HI>
<PB N="361" REF="370"/>
<HI>should not be able to come to his House?</HI> which was not above two Stones-Cast Distance.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I did not know but I might; but if I did, it must be in the Evening; for in the Forenoons, after my clammy Sweats, I was so weak, that I could not walk across the House; and towards the Evening I recover'd, and was generally pretty bearty.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> He would wait for me in the Even∣ing.</P>
<P><HI>After he was gone, my Landlord told me,</HI> I had acted very well, and was glad I had not agreed with him; <HI>adding,</HI> That he would get some of his Friends to speak to the Priest, and represent the Case to him, that I could sell the Wreck for a great deal more; and that if he did not buy it, they could not get such Wood on the Island as that was; <HI>(which indeed was true)</HI> and that he should not be able to enlarge the Choir, unless he bought that, or waited till he could buy Stuff out of Ships when they came here; which would not only be uncertain as to the Time, but would also come much dearer; and that he would also speak to the two Men, who had been sent to appraise it, who also were his Friends, &amp;c. <HI>All which he effectually did; and told me,</HI> That the Men apprais'd the whole at twelve Dollars; and that I should not abate any thing of that, without allowing any thing for the Boom, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Next Evening, when it grew cool, I made shift to walk to the Priest's House: My Landlord would not go with me, because he would not give the Priest any Thought, that he advis'd any ways about it, tho' he had been perswading the Priest, as his Friend, to buy it.</P>
<P>When I came to the Priest's House, he seem'd to be indifferent about it: I being fore-advis'd, did not much mind it, and was inform'd that he was very eager of having the Choir inlarg'd. I
<PB N="362" REF="371"/>
told him, <HI>If he did not think well of it, I could sell it for a great deal more than he talk'd of.</HI></P>
<P>He sent for the two Men, whom, I suppose, he afore caution'd what to say: When they came, he ask'd them, <HI>Whether they thought in their Consciences the Things were worth more than ten Dollars?</HI></P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> They had given him an Account what they really thought they were worth, and every body was willing I should have it; as likewise that the <HI>Fradre</HI> had told them all, that it was a mortal Sin to wrong me: And, without doubt, <HI>continu'd they,</HI> your Reverence knows, how that the Singore <HI>Bispo</HI> writ to use him as himself. <HI>At which I saw the Priest wink at them, which made them hold their Tongues.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He ask'd me,</HI> How much I demanded for all the Wreck?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would not make any more than one Word, which was, that I would have <HI>9000</HI> Reas for all of it, and that Piece that I mention'd before should be excepted.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> That was too much. <HI>I told him,</HI> I un∣derstood it was not for his particular Use, neither was it at his particular Charge, that it was bought; which, was it either, he should have it for nothing, or what Price he pleas'd; or, if the Singores of the Island would accept of the Things, I would freely make a Present of them to the Church, not as a Re∣compence, but as a Testimony of Acknowledgment till I could present a better, for the many Favours and Kindnesses I had receiv'd from them.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He thank'd me; and, for his Part, he expected nothing, neither did he believe any body would receive any thing from me by Way of Reta∣liation, for any Kindness shew'd me.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="372"/>
<HI>Abundance more of such Discourse pass'd; and I told him,</HI> If they would not accept it as a Present, according to my Wish, but that I must be oblig'd to take Money for it, I would have to the Value of it, or not at all; and if he thought well of it, I should be glad he would have it; if not, <HI>I assur'd him,</HI> I could sell it to the People for a great deal more than I ask'd him for it.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> I should find a great deal of Trouble in that.</P>
<P><HI>I said,</HI> I believ'd not; for I had as many spoke to me already about it, as would take it all; and if he did not think fit to have it, I believ'd I could dispose of it all before to morrow at Noon.</P>
<P>He paus'd a while, and call'd some of them that were present aside; and after a little while re∣turn'd, and said, <HI>He would give me</HI> 9000 <HI>Reas, but I must not take the Boom; for he knew,</HI> he said, <HI>I could not want it for my own Use.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> It was true; but I had promis'd a Friend to save it for him; and if he thought it was not worth so much without that Piece, he should, if he pleas'd, have them for nothing; but if I sold them, I would have no less than I told him for them.</P>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> said he, <HI>then you shall have</HI> 9000: (which is twelve Dollars, a Dollar being reckon'd there at 750 Reas) So we agreed; and he told me, <HI>I might have my Money when I pleas'd.</HI> I said, <HI>It was very well.</HI></P>
<P>Some few Days after he pay'd me; which made me richer than I had been for some Years before; and I bought a large Hog for a Dollar and half, and had it kill'd. My Landlord would have had me sold the Maiz and Feshoon which lay on the Rock at <HI>Paraghesi;</HI> but I told him, <HI>I would not; but bid him take what he had Occasion for, and let the Poor, or any that wanted the rest, take it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="373"/>
He took, I believe, about the Quantity of five Bushels, the whole of what was laid on the Rock being about forty or fifty Bushels; and then I gave Liberty for every body that wanted, to take the rest; which mightily rais'd me in Esteem with the Inhabitants, especially the poorer Sort.</P>
<P>I recover'd my Strength a little; but presently after fell first into a quotidian, than a tertian Ague, which kept me very weak; for my cold Sweats, which I had the latter End of the cold or shaking Fit, came again; but nothing to the Excess that it was before.</P>
<P>I thus pass'd, or rather linger'd my Time away, till about the latter Part of <HI>October,</HI> when, to my great Satisfaction, I had News of an <HI>English</HI> Ship being arriv'd at this Island, and that she anchor'd in the Port of <HI>Terra-Fall.</HI> It was late in the Evening when I heard the News, and I immedi∣ately resolv'd to go down that Night. My Land∣lord perswaded me all he could to defer my Jour∣ney till the Morning, for fear of catching cold, &amp;c. but I was fix'd in my Resolution; and while he and his Son were gone to catch a Horse for me to ride down upon, to my yet greater Satis∣faction, I had a Letter from the Captain, brought me by one of the Blacks, who was down at <HI>Terra-Fall</HI> when the Ship came to an Anchor; for as soon as that was done, the Captain observing People ashore, sent his Boat to bring off some of them, or, if they were not willing, to give them an Account what he was, and what he came to trade for, as likewise to inform himself whether there had been any Pyrates about the Islands.</P>
<P><HI>Several of them went off in the Boat on Board, who inform'd the Captain of me, as far as they were capable of; and when they nam'd my Name he remember'd me, tho' we never had had any personal Acquaintance together; but the Year
<PB N="365" REF="374"/>
before, at</HI> Bona Vist, <HI>he fell into the same Pirates Hands that I had, from whom he heard of my being taken; and the Blacks relating to him, my being Shipwreck'd at St.</HI> John'<HI>s, of my building a</HI> Balandra <HI>there, and of my losing her here, &amp;c. he told them,</HI> He knew me; <HI>and asked them,</HI> If any of them would carry a Letter from him to me; <HI>they said,</HI> With all their Hearts; <HI>so he immedi∣ately writ to me, acquainting me</HI> of his Arrival, his designing to trade there for Cotton Cloths, Money, or what else I would inform him that the Country afforded, that would be worth his purchasing; and that he had, he believed, a very good Cargo for these Islands, and referred particularizing, 'till he saw me, and should expect me down at the Port To-morrow, if I was able; that he heard from the Blacks, that I was not very well; but hoped, not so ill as not to be able to come down; that he would have come up to me, but was afraid to leave his Vessel; but if I found myself unable, he would ven∣ture up; but would rather, I could, make any Shift to get down, for he thought I should sooner re∣cover both my Health and Strength with him, than where I was; and desired me to compliment the Priest, Governor, and who else I thought proper, in his Name; and either let him see, or hear from me To-morrow.</P>
<P><HI>At the perusing of this Letter, I deferred my Journey till the Morning; but in the mean Time acquainted the Priest and Governor,</HI> That the Captain gave his Service to them, and was come to trade for Cotton Cloths, and I could not tell what else he would trade for.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> If he brought any Cotton from <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> they would willingly exchange Cloths for Cot∣ton; but they need not tell me, <HI>they said,</HI> who knew so well the Nature and Productions of all these Islands, even better than they did themselves, that
<PB N="366" REF="375"/>
Cotton had been so scarce for several Years past, that they believed hardly any would sell their Cotton Cloths, unless for Cotton, for fear of wanting them∣selves.</P>
<P>I soon had all the Inhabitants about me, who all wished he had rather been a Trader for Asses, than Cotton Cloths.</P>
<P>Next Morning before Day, the Governor and I, and several others, went down; the Priest was to come after he had said his Mass, which is every Morning in St. <HI>Nicholas Church,</HI> unless Sick∣ness, &amp;c. hinders; my Landlord, poor Man, could not come, being so bad with a Pain in his Back, occasioned by a Wrench, and a Cold upon that, that he could not sit an Ass, which gave us both no small Concern.</P>
<P>We got down about Ten a Clock, having been on the Journey about Eight Hours; Capt. <HI>John Harfoot,</HI> whose Vessel was a Brigantine about Sixty or Seventy Tuns, saw us coming Time enough to get ashore with the Boat before we got to the Sea Side, and had got a Sail ashore, and a Tent fixed.</P>
<P>He received us very courteously, and was glad to see me, as I was more to see him there: After we had talked a while about Trade, and I had given him several Hints relating to it, he took us on Board.</P>
<P>The Priest came down about One a Clock, for whom Captain <HI>Harfoot</HI> sent his Boat. In the Evening they went ashore, and so to Town; but I staid; after which we had more Leisure to talk.</P>
<P>I told him the Nature and best Method of Trading, &amp;c. so far as related to the Disposal of his Cargo; and he very kindly offered me my Passage, and what Entertainment his Vessel af∣forded, for me and the Boy, and told me the De∣sign
<PB N="367" REF="376"/>
of his Voyage, which was to trade among the Islands about Two Months, and then run for the Island of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where he was to meet a Ship to take his Cargo of Cotton Cloths from him; and told me, as I knew it very well my∣self, <HI>That when I got to that Island, I might get an Employ there, or, if my Affairs required my going home, I need not fear something in my Way; but if not, I was welcome to go home with him, if I so thought fit.</HI></P>
<P>I thanked him, and assisted him with my Ad∣vice all I could, and served as Linguist for him; for neither he, nor any on Board, could speak either the <HI>Creole</HI> of the Islands, or <HI>Portuguese,</HI> either of which, would have been sufficient to trade with.</P>
<P>I could have put him in a Way to have pur∣chased One thousand Cloths, or more, at an in∣considerable Price; but as the Space of Two Months, which was all the Time he could tarry among the Islands, was not long enough for that Purpose, I omitted to acquaint him with it.</P>
<P>He was resolved to tarry there Two or Three Days more, if the Weather did not force him away; for though it be usual for the constant Trade Winds to set in before this Time, yet the Sky promised some more Rain, the which would probably cause a Shift of Wind; however, I went up to Town, choosing a promising Sky for fair Weather, he promising me faithfully, that if he was forced off before I could come down, that he would touch there again for me.</P>
<P>I went up to get my Cloaths, &amp;c. and to bring the Boy down, and take my final Leave of the Inhabitants; all which I chose to do personally, because I could be serviceable to his Affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="377"/>
I had spoke to him about <HI>George,</HI> and that I believed he would be glad to work for his Passage to get off these Islands, and gave him an Account, as far as <HI>George</HI> had given me: The Captain told me, That he had his full Complement of Hands, and had no Occasion for any more; but rather than the young Fellow should stay there, he would give him his Passage; so when I came up to Town, I told <HI>George,</HI> who seemed rejoiced at it.</P>
<P>I took my Leave of the Inhabitants, and the Boy and I went down the same Night, <HI>George</HI> following us the next Morning; as soon as Cap∣tain <HI>Harfoot</HI> saw the little Boy, he wondered how I came to take such a little Child to Sea, who, he said, was fitter for a Nurse, than to do me any Service.</P>
<P><HI>I told him my Reasons for taking him, as I have afore related; he commended me for it, but said,</HI> He wondered how I could take Care of the Boy, and bring him with me in so many Difficulties; and that a great many Men would have left him at St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That I thought it would be an un∣christian, as well as an inhuman Act, to have left a Child so, to be brought up in a manner like an Infidel.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> That was true; but there were Thou∣sands that would have left him; <HI>and said,</HI> That I should find it very chargeable to get him home.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> If I could, I would get him home, let it cost me what it would, at least to <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says he,</HI> it will cost you nothing for him to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> for you are as welcome to his Passage thither, as if it was your own Vessel. <HI>I returned him many Thanks for his Kindness.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>George</HI> came down, he haled the Bri∣gantine; Captain <HI>Harfoot</HI> asked me, <HI>If that was the Man?</HI> I answered, <HI>Yes;</HI> he sent the Boat for
<PB N="369" REF="378"/>
him; and as soon as he was brought on Board, I observ'd his Countenance to change, but I could not imagine the Reason; however, Captain <HI>Har∣foot</HI> soon made me sensible of the Reason of <HI>George</HI>'s Dejection of Countenance; which was this, The Year before, when <HI>Loe</HI> took Captain <HI>Harfoot</HI> at <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> this Fellow was on Board the Pirates, and, it seems, was as active as the rest in plundering and rifling; and <HI>George</HI> perceiving that Mr. <HI>Harfoot</HI> knew him again, it so daunted him, that he had no Courage to speak. The Captain, as soon as he had recover'd Memory enough, to convince him that he was certain it was he, said in a Passion, <HI>You impudent rascally Villain, I admire how you dare come to ask a Favour of me!</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Fellow look'd very dejected, and told him,</HI> That he was a Prisoner on Board with the Pirates, and was constrain'd to do what he did, as not daring to refuse whatever they thought proper to command him.</P>
<P><HI>The Captain bid him</HI> hold his Tongue, and tell them so that knew no better; and that if he had not the Impudence of the Devil, or his Master <HI>Loe,</HI> he would not come to ask him any Favour, &amp;c. <HI>Adding,</HI> That if he was sure to find a Man of War to put him on Board of, before he went from the Islands, he would give him his Passage to it; <HI>and turning to me, said,</HI> If a Body should take that Villain on Board to carry him to Justice, and should meet any of his Brother Villains, <HI>(meaning the Pirates)</HI> a Man could expect nothing but Death; <HI>and turning to</HI> George, <HI>who to all this reply'd not a Word, he said,</HI> I will send you ashore again; but if I meet with any of his Majesty's Ships before I leave these Islands, I will give them an Account of you, and perswade them, all I can, to come and give you a Passage to <HI>Tyburn;</HI> and hope e'er long to hear of
<PB N="370" REF="379"/>
Master <HI>Loe</HI>'s receiving his last Reward, according to his Deserts, at some such Place.</P>
<P>He then order'd the Boat to put him ashore; and when he had done what he had to do there, he weigh'd, and we run for <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> where he tarry'd four Days; from thence we went to the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and tarry'd two Days, and then pro∣ceeded to the Island of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and anchor'd in <HI>Porto Praya,</HI> where we met with an <HI>English</HI> Ship come from the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> with a Cargo of Slaves, Wax, Teeth, &amp;c. bound for <HI>Lisbon.</HI> She slaved at <HI>Cacheu,</HI> and was there all the Time of the Rains: She was freighted by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchants, and had been very leaky after her Arrival at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> insomuch, that they were forc'd to take out all her Cargo there, to come at her Leaks, some of the chief of which they stop'd, and nail'd lead over them. Their Car∣penter, and two Doctors, and above half their Company, dy'd at <HI>Guinea.</HI> The Captain was sick at St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but when we came in, he was reco∣ver'd, but yet weak, as was almost all the re∣maining Part of the Company.</P>
<P><HI>As soon as he understood what I was, he spoke first to Captain</HI> Harfoot, <HI>about my Proceeding with him to</HI> Lisbon, <HI>and desir'd him to speak to me; which Captain</HI> Harfoot <HI>did, saying,</HI> That the Captain of the <HI>Guinea</HI>-Man had desir'd him to speak to me, that he would be very glad to have my Company with him to <HI>Lisbon.</HI> Now, <HI>said Captain</HI> Harfoot, as I told you before, you are welcome to stay on Board with me the whole Term of the Voyage, with your Boy, and fare as you have done. <HI>Which, I must say, was as well, both for Eating, Drinking, and good free, hearty, and ingenious Conversation, as could be expected in a Wooden World, and in those Parts;</HI> and that he should be glad, if it suited with my Conveniency, I would proceed with
<PB N="371" REF="380"/>
him; as well for the Sake of my Company and Con∣versation, <HI>of which he was pleas'd to give an En∣comium, far above what it merited,</HI> as that, <HI>he said,</HI> he knew it would be a great Advantage to him in his trading, as I was so universally acquaint∣ed, both with the Inhabitants, and their Customs, Languages, Commodities, &amp;c. and the private Va∣lue of them among themselves, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I was so much oblig'd to him, that as long as I could be serviceable to him for the Voyage, I would not leave him, tho' it was certain that my Inclination, as well as I believ'd my Inte∣rest, would be to get Home as soon as I could.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> As for Obligation, he knew none; he thought it was his Duty, as a Man, and more espe∣cially as a Countryman, and a Christian, and should have expected the same from me, or any other Man, who had not put off Humanity. He would have me consider my own Interest, <HI>he said,</HI> and tho', as he observ'd to me before, my being with him would be a great Advantage in his trading, and consequently to the Voyage; yet, when he fitted out, and design'd the Undertaking of this Voyage, he had no View of that Assistance which by my Misfortune accidentally happen'd; and therefore, if my Desire or Interest was for a speedy Return Home, as be believ'd it needs must, he desir'd me that I would by no Means retard it, on the Account of serving his or his Owners Interest, because he doubted they would not make me a suitable Retaliation for my Time and Pains: But withal, he would have me consider, that I was in a weak Condition, and had an Ague every Day; that I had good fresh Eating and good Drink with him, which tho' I might have on Board the <HI>Guinea</HI>-Man, yet, <HI>said he,</HI> here you have a clean sweet healthy Ship, there you have a stinking noi∣some, sickly one, and weak-handed; which how lit∣tle soever a Man in Health might matter it, yet to
<PB N="372" REF="381"/>
a Man in your Condition, it might be otherwise. I am loth, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> to advise you to any thing; I would have you do what you think most suitable to your Interest, neither let any Obligation that you may conceive lies upon you to me, in the least biass or sway you in your Determination. <HI>I thank'd him for his Advice, and told him, I would consider of it.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain of the <HI>Guinea</HI>-Man's Name was, <HI>Moses Durel,</HI> of <HI>Pool</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> the Ship's Name was the <HI>Merry-Thought:</HI> Mr. <HI>Lewin,</HI> Mer∣chant, now in <HI>London,</HI> was one of the Owners, and Mr. <HI>Henry Gibbs</HI> in <HI>Lisbon,</HI> Merchant, was another, and the said Captain had also a Part of her himself.</P>
<P>That Gentleman came on Board soon after, and told me, <HI>He should be glad of my Company in his Ship to</HI> Lisbon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I told him, I would consider of it. So we had no more talk about it then; but went ashore together, and din'd; and that Evening I had a Letter came to me, from a Gentleman that was going to reside at <HI>Cacheu;</HI> and next Morning I went to the City, and lay there one Night, and return'd next Day to <HI>Praya,</HI> where I met Capt. <HI>Harfoot</HI> and Captain <HI>Durel:</HI> We din'd together at the Lieutenant's of the Fort; and, in the Evening, Captain <HI>Durel</HI> invited us on Board him to Supper, where we talk'd the Matter again. He ask'd, <HI>Whether I had consider'd of it as yet, and hoped he should have my Company.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I had not come to a Resolution yet.</P>
<P>Well, but, <HI>said Captain</HI> Harfoot, Captain <HI>Durel,</HI> you ought to consider this Gentleman has had a great Misfortune; he has been a long time from Home, neither has he had an Opportunity of hearing from thence in some Years: You must allow this Gentle∣man will be very serviceable to you, you being but
<PB N="373" REF="382"/>
weak-handed; but however, if he was not, still we ought to consider his present Circumstances, which are such as we ourselves are liable too daily; and therefore we should use him, as we would desire to be us'd in the same Case.</P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Durel <HI>said,</HI> As for offering Captain <HI>Ro∣berts</HI> Wages, I shall not, as thinking it would be unkind, because it would imply a bringing a Man under an Obligation of Duty, which I neither▪ re∣quire nor desire of him; I only desire to have his good Company, as well as Advice, and do not doubt but my Owners at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> will make him a better Present than I shall at present mention or offer; and I wish it would suit, and I hope it will, with his Conveniency, to go with me thither.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I would resolve him the next Morn∣ing; <HI>but withal,</HI> that where I went, my Boy must go also, for I would not leave him behind.</P>
<P>He said, <HI>If I had ten Boys they should be all welcome to go:</HI> So after the Conclusion of a Sneaker, &amp;c. we parted; and Mr. <HI>Harfoot</HI> and I went on Board his Brigg, where we talk'd the Matter again, and then I concluded to go with Captain <HI>Durel,</HI> as being much likelier to get home sooner, than by running down with Mr. <HI>Harfoot</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> and in Compliance to Mr. <HI>Harfoot</HI>'s Request, I gave him such necessary Di∣rections and Precautions, as I judg'd might be serviceable to him in his Trading among the Islands, as well in disposing of his own Commo∣dities, as buying theirs; with some Directions for finding and anchoring in the Ports, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Next Morning Captain <HI>Durel</HI> call'd on Board as he was going ashore, and we went ashore toge∣ther. I then acquainted him with my Resolution to go with him; at which he express'd Abundance of Satisfaction: We din'd ashore, and Captain <HI>Durel</HI> lay ashore that Night; Mr. <HI>Harfoot</HI> and I
<PB N="374" REF="383"/>
went on Board the Brigg, and spent the Evening together, and till after Midnight; and he being design'd to sail that Morning, with Thanks ren∣der'd for past Favours, and what else is usual at the parting of hearty Friends, we parted; and my Things being pack'd up, his Boat put them, with my Boy and I, on Board the <HI>Merry-Thought;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harfoot</HI> sail'd at Day-dawning the same Morning for the Leeward Islands.</P>
<P>We tarry'd four Days after at <HI>Porto Praya,</HI> and the Captain having engag'd himself to go down to the City, to take in some Water-Casks there, and the Remainder of our Provisions for the Voyage, we weigh'd from <HI>Porto Praya November</HI> the 15th, and anchor'd at the City the next Day, about ten in the Forenoon; and having fill'd the Remainder of our Water, and got the rest of the Negroes Provisions in, we sail'd from <HI>Porto Cidade</HI> about the 19th of <HI>November,</HI> and stretch'd away to the Northward.</P>
<P>As soon as we were shot clear of the Lee of the Island, we met with a Head Sea, which we head∣ed the more, by the Winds veering far to the East∣ward. The Ship hourly increas'd leaking, insomuch that we were forc'd to keep one Pump constantly going. We had about 180 Slaves on Board, a Portuguese <HI>Supercargo, Scrivan,</HI> and <HI>Tunnalheer,</HI> and Singore <HI>Antonio de Barra,</HI> late Governor of <HI>Cacheu,</HI> who, upon my Aequaintance with him, went on Board us as a Passenger to <HI>Lisbon;</HI> tho', before I went, he had resolv'd to wait another Opportunity, by Reason the Ship had been so leaky.</P>
<P><HI>The Ship still growing leakier and leakier, Cap∣tain</HI> Durel <HI>ask'd my Opinion,</HI> What I thought of it? <HI>I told him,</HI> He and those who had been the Voyage in the Ship, and had seen her Bottom, were the best Judges.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="384"/>
<HI>He said,</HI> He was sure her Bottom was sound and tight, and that her Leaks were none of them below the Waters Edge.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Portuguese <HI>were all for going back to St.</HI> Jago <HI>to stop the Leaks; but the Captain said,</HI> He was afraid, if he put back there again, they would land the Cargo there, and would not put it on Board him again; besides, there were no Carpenters to be had there, nor any thing else: That if the Islands <HI>(meaning St.</HI> Nicholas, <HI>St.</HI> Lucia, <HI>St.</HI> Vin∣cent, &amp;c.) had any convenient Road, he would ra∣ther try to find the Leaks at one of them; and as we could not be furnish'd, either with Carpenters or Stuff at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> so we could do as much at one of those Islands, as at St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> That was very true; and as for finding a Road, I would, with God's Leave, if he desir'd it, anchor him in a better Road by far, than any that he had been at in St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He ask'd,</HI> If there was Wood and Water to be got there.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> At St. <HI>Vincent</HI> there was both, and also at St. <HI>Lucia;</HI> but 'twas difficult to get them on Board.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He had heard a great Talk of St. <HI>Ni∣cholas</HI>'s being one of the best of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> The Island was well enough; but then the same Hazard that he fear'd at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> might as well befal him there, &amp;c. <HI>After which he resolv'd for St.</HI> Vincent.</P>
<P>We fetch'd in to Leeward of St. <HI>Lucia;</HI> it blew fresh, and we found the Channel between St. <HI>Antonio</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> a windy one, to beat up; for which Reason, we chose rather to run to St. <HI>Lucia,</HI> and let go our Anchor in a fair clean sandy Bay; but the Captain being a little fearful, would not run in far enough, but let go the An∣chor,
<PB N="376" REF="385"/>
which was rather too light, on the Edge of the Bank. Our Misfortune was, to be very weak∣handed, and, which was worse, some of them were the most grumbling, lazy, and unwilling Men that ever I saw on Board of a Ship: And about an Hour after the Anchor was gone, there being only the Foretopsail handed, and that too by a Couple of Negroes, a Flaw of Wind came off the high Land, and what with the Sails not being handed, together with the Lightness of the Anchor, the Ship drove off the Bank out of Soundings.</P>
<P><HI>They were for veering more Cable; but I told them,</HI> They had better heave the Anchor up; and if they had a Mind to ride the Ship, they must run in on the Bank into four or five Fathom Water.</P>
<P>I began to think I was got on Board a Pirate, for there was such swearing, cursing, &amp;c. that it would have made a sober Man's Hair stand an End; and I was too weak to be able then to do much, having daily a Fever and Ague, and the Captain, poor Gentleman! almost in as bad a Condition, having also an Ague, tho' not so fre∣quently. The Mate hove the Lead to sound, but we were out of Soundings: The Folks then swore, <HI>They would not heave up the Anchor; or if they did, they would not lay a Hand on any thing to work in her; they did not know what the Design was;</HI> and a thousand other such Speeches, attended with thundering Oaths and Curses, such as Igno∣rance, join'd with arrogant Sawciness, is wont to produce; tho', at the same Time, it was the Negroes that did in a Manner all the Labour.</P>
<P>The Captain could not, nor, I believe, any body else, forbear being in a Passion, tho', in∣deed, it avail'd him nothing; however, the Re∣sult was, to take our Chance, and put to Sea again, which accordingly was done; and about
<PB N="377" REF="386"/>
the Latitude of between 24 and 25 Degrees North, it blowing a stout fresh Gale, the Water increas'd so fast, that all Hands were call'd, both Pumps mann'd, and two Gangs set to baling with Tubs and Buckets out of the Hold; but for all that the Water still increas'd.</P>
<P>I had then an Ague-Fit, and Captain <HI>Durel</HI> ask'd my Opinion, and what I would advise him to do?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> There were but two Ways that I knew of, to have a Chance to save his Vessel, tho' he might save his Life by a shorter Run.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> He thought it would be best to run for St. <HI>Jago,</HI> or any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands that we could fetch; and ask'd me, If there were no Harbours at the Islands of <HI>Fogo</HI> or <HI>Brava,</HI> in Case we should not be able to fetch St. <HI>Jago?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> There was a better Harbour by far at the Isle of <HI>Brava,</HI> than any he had seen at St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P>Then, <HI>says he,</HI> I think our best Way will be, to run for the Islands at once.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I believ'd we should not be able to fetch any of them by several Leagues as the Wind was; for at our parting from the Islands we had the Wind the common Trade, but it was now got to East and East-by-South.</P>
<P><HI>He ask'd me then,</HI> What we must do? Why, <HI>said I, (for we had taken in our Topsails already to ease her)</HI> we do not gain upon the Water which leaks into the Ship, but that rather gains upon us; and if we do not find some Way or other, either to ease the Ship, or stop some of the Leaks, it is plain we must go to the Bottom; for that the Negroes, who were the chief, and indeed I might say, sole Dependance, as soon as they were tir'd, or this Fright over, or any sullen wilful Notion came in their Heads, would leave off both baling and pump∣ing;
<PB N="378" REF="387"/>
and, <HI>said I,</HI> if one Pump drawing would keep the Ship free, I doubt whether the Sailors would do that, without the Negroes Assistance.</P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Durel <HI>said,</HI> He knew it too-too well, but could not help it himself:—But what could he do?</P>
<P>Do, <HI>said I,</HI> you must put the Ship away lasking, or afore the Wind, which of them will in your Judg∣ment ease her most, and I will go down and try if I can find, and stop any of the Leaks.</P>
<P>He agreed, and we put the Ship afore it, under her Foresail; after which they gain'd upon her. I found out two large Leaks under the Timbers, and chinch'd them as well as I could, and stop'd the Current of the Waters coming in, in a great Measure; so that after we had got her to suck, we could keep her free with one Pump.</P>
<P>We had another great Misfortune, which was, the Sand Ballast being wash'd down through the Cieling, every now and then so choak'd the Pumps, that we were forc'd to draw the Boxes to clear them, and occasion'd them to want leathering, sometimes once, twice, and oftner, in twenty-four Hours.</P>
<P><HI>After I had stop'd those two Leaks as well as I could, and the Ship suck'd, the Governor telling me,</HI> That if it had not been for me, he would not have ventur'd in the Ship; <HI>I told him,</HI> He could not, with any Reason, blame me; for if I had foreseen any Hazard, I should not have ventur'd my∣self; but that I thought it more prudent now, to re∣solve upon something speedily, to secure ourselves, the Ship, and the Cargo.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> As for the Ship or Cargo, it did not in the least concern him, although, he believ'd, he had as good an Interest in the Cargo as any one Man; <HI>and so I▪ believe he had;</HI> But, <HI>said he,</HI> if there be any Course to be taken, why don't you and the
<PB N="379" REF="388"/>
Captain resolve upon that which you shall think the lest.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> The Captain was not willing to de∣termine any thing till he had consulted with, and had the Concurrence of him, the Supra-cargo, and the rest of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Gentlemen, who were in∣terested in the Charge of the Cargo, as much as he of the Ship.</P>
<P><HI>He ask'd,</HI> Why we had not call'd them together before?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> We had not Time till now; for till in some measure we had stopp'd as much of the Leaks as we could, and had suck'd the Ship, it was in vain to consult, or resolve to run any where; that now, Thanks to God, we had freed the Ship, and it was to be hoped, tho' not without Care and abundance of Labour, we should, with the Assistance of the Negroes, be able to keep her free, till we could recover some Port; and he being the Principal, Captain <HI>Durel</HI> thought proper he should be acquaint∣ed first, and, if he pleas'd, he might call the rest; <HI>who all this while, especially the Supra-cargo, were crying out for their Country and Wives, and commending themselves to all their Saints and Patrons, wringing their Hands, &amp;c. He imme∣diately had them all call'd aft, Captain</HI> Durel <HI>and I, in the mean time, having concluded to run for</HI> Barbadoes, <HI>where I satisfy'd him that we could refit the Ship, if capable; if not, he could there with Ease secure the Cargo for half Freight.</HI></P>
<P>We had some Talk how he should raise Credit, he being utterly a Stranger there, neither he nor his Mate having ever been in any Part of <HI>Ameri∣ca,</HI> except <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> and when they were all come aft, Captain <HI>Durel</HI> desir'd me to speak to them, for that he thought they would be easier perswaded by me than by him; which I did, and propos'd our running to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> because of the
<PB N="380" REF="389"/>
Certainty of a large Wind all the Way, which would much ease the Ship, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>The Supra-cargo was altogether for going to the</HI> Cape de Verd <HI>Islands. I shew'd him the almost Impossibility of fetching them, the Danger of straining the Ship with sailing upon a Wind,</HI> &amp;c. And supposing it were possible to fetch St. <HI>Jago, said I,</HI> you have no Anchor that would bring you up, and only a small Yawl, with which you could hardly save your Lives, much less your Slaves, your Wax, or any thing of the Cargo.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor said,</HI> But is there no Place that we could run with a large Wind but <HI>Barbadoes? I told him,</HI> We could run to <HI>Brasil,</HI> but then we should not be so certain of meeting Conveniencies there as at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>said he,</HI> they build Ships there, and <HI>Bar∣badoes</HI> is but an Island, I suppose, like St. <HI>Jago,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> It was true, it was an Island; but I doubted whether he could have any thing at <HI>Lisbon</HI> which was not at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> except a King, a Pa∣triarch, a Nobleman, and a Bishop.</P>
<P><HI>The Gentleman smil'd, notwithstanding his Dread and Apprehension of Danger, at my Ex∣pression; and speaking to the</HI> Portuguese, <HI>said,</HI> What signifies our talking, its better we let the Captain and <HI>Singore Robertus</HI> consult together with∣out disturbing them: We are not able to assist, but only confuse them; they know better than any of us; and as for any particular Interest, <HI>Singore Rober∣tus</HI> has the least of any one on Board, unless in the greatest Concern, common to us all, namely, the Pre∣servation of our Lives.</P>
<P><HI>They all agreed, and the Supra-cargo said,</HI> He would leave it entirely to <HI>Singore Robertus,</HI> to car∣ry the Ship where he thought properest.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="390"/>
<HI>I told them,</HI> I would not do any thing that Way; I only deliver'd my Opinion of what I thought was properest, and safest, but was to be govern'd more especially by Captain <HI>Durel</HI>'s Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>They said,</HI> If I thought to go to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> was best, they all consented to it.</P>
<P><HI>I said,</HI> If Captain <HI>Durel</HI> thought so, it was my Opinion.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> Yes, he concluded it to be the best Way.</P>
<P><HI>Then I said,</HI> I thought the Supra-cargo, Scrivan, &amp;c. ought to sign an Instrument to testify their free Consent.</P>
<P>They said, <HI>With all their Hearts;</HI> and accord∣ingly one was drawn, and sign'd by them all; upon which we made sail, to the great Satisfaction of all, the Negroes especially; for as soon as they came to understand that we were going to some Land, they hollow'd, and said, <HI>They would stand by the Pump Night and Day.</HI></P>
<P>We run about three or four Days, having sometimes light, sometimes taut Gales; another Leak breaking out, she made so much Water, that we fear'd we should not be able to keep her from sinking: We went down in the Hold, and at last heard the Leak, which was right against the Well, on the Starboard Side. We clear'd away, and cut the Ceiling, and it prov'd like the other Leaks under a Timber. I much fear'd it was a Butt; but there being no Way to stop it but cutting the Timber away, nor no keeping the Ship above Water without stopping it, we resolv'd upon the latter, by doing the former; however, I call'd Captain <HI>Durel</HI> to see it, and told him what I thought, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was a Butt; but withal, the Impossibility of keeping the Ship above Wa∣ter without stopping it: He gave his Consent, I cut, and with the Assistance of a <HI>French</HI> Man,
<PB N="382" REF="391"/>
which he got at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> we cut the Timber away. It prov'd a Butt, and was trunnell'd. I cut the Timber about the Trunnel, but let the Trunnel remain. The Butt was wholly open the whole Breadth of the Plank, which was fourteen Inches, and the Water came in with as great Force, as if it was an Engine playing. The Butt was seven Tenths of an Inch wide: I run my Hand through to keep the Water out, while I got some Oakum to stop it with: It look'd very frightful, you could see the Sea plain through it: I got some Oakum in, and then I went to work to secure the Butt, which I did thus:</P>
<P>I observ'd to you before, that I left the Trun∣nel standing in the Plank, in which it was very fast: I notch'd it, and took a Line, and also two Clove Hitches, with two Parts of the Line, having mous'd the Trunnel above the Clove Hitches, to secure them from sliding, and having fasten'd the Line so that I had four single Parts, and a Noose, I lash'd the Trunnel to a Bar, as a Port is usually lash'd; then having two Screws, such as are us'd in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to fix into the To∣bacco Hogsheads to rowl them with, from whence, by our Sailors, they are call'd Rowlers: These Screws I screw'd very fast at each Corner of the Plank End, and lash'd them well into the Bar, so that I believe the Butt End was as secure, as it was before I cut the Timber; after which I could venture to drive my Oakum tight; on that I laid Oakum and Tar, and on that a Chock of Wood, secur'd down with Battings nail'd over, so that it was so tight you could scarce perceive it to weep; after which our Ship held it bravely, considering, till we got to <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but a little while after the stopping of this Leak, we had another Mis∣fortune, which was almost as bad as our Leaks, which was, the want of Pump Nails; for the
<PB N="383" REF="392"/>
Sand working up in the Pumps, so tore the Lea∣ther, that before we had run half Way to <HI>Bar∣badoes,</HI> our Stock of Nails was expended, and they were at their Wits Ends; for it would have been almost impossible to have kept her free by baleing alone without the Pumps; I remember'd I had seen a Contrivance on Board of a <HI>Frenchman</HI> to make Canvas serve in the room of Leather; our Necessity oblig'd ▪us to improve that Contri∣vance, for they us'd Nails, we had none to use: I did at length contrive so, that we fix'd the Boxes to work without Leather or Nails, except∣ing the Clappers; and our Canvas Bags did ex∣traordinary well, and deliver'd as much more Wa∣ter, as when the Boxes were leather'd; but it de∣stroy'd a great deal of Canvas, which I believe was owing to the Sand which work'd up in the Pump, and cut and fretted the Canvas.</P>
<P>We got to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and anchor'd in <HI>Carlisle-Bay Christmas-Day,</HI> 1724: We were forc'd to land every thing, and hove her down, shifted be∣tween two and three hundred Foot of Plank, she was so eat with the Worms.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Durel</HI> had a sore Fit of Sickness, inso∣much that it was thought he would have dy'd; but he recover'd, and was able to go about his Business, by the Time the Ship was fit to take Ballast in again.</P>
<P>In less than three Months after our Arrival we sail'd; she held pretty tight, tho' we met with very hard Gales about the <HI>Azores.</HI></P>
<P>We put into <HI>Vigo,</HI> and lay there for a Wind for <HI>Lisbon</HI> about a Fortnight, and then a fair Wind presenting, we sail'd, and arriv'd at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where I took the first Opportunity of a Passage for <HI>London,</HI> which happen'd with Mr. <HI>Alexander Bax∣ter,</HI> Master of the <HI>Pricket,</HI> a Brigantine, who ge∣nerously
<PB N="384" REF="393"/>
gave both me and my Boy a Passage to <HI>London,</HI> where we arriv'd towards the latter Part of <HI>June,</HI> 1725.</P>
<P>My Ague had follow'd me as a constant, tho' unwelcome Attendant to the <HI>West Indies,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and about the Middle of the Passage between <HI>Lisbon</HI> and <HI>London</HI> it left me; but after my being about a Fortnight ashore, it return'd as bad as ever, and brought me so low, that I was uncapable of any thing but writing; which, by the Perswasion of some Friends, I un∣dertook, and, by the Blessing of God upon the Medicines administred, I recover'd my former Health; but having then gone through a great Part of this History, I resolv'd to compleat it, and found the doing of it much more tedious and painful, than at first I imagin'd it would be; the which Ignorance, with my Incapacity to go abroad when I began it, were the only Inducements to comply with the Perswasions of my Friends, as I mention'd before.</P>
<P>And now having kept pretty close to the Histo∣ry of my own Adventures, and the various Inci∣dents and Providences which befel me in the Course of my Voyage to these Islands of <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> I think myself oblig'd to present the Reader with a more particular Account of the Nature, Situations, Productions, Manners of the People, &amp;c. of those Islands, which I observ'd while I was among them as a Traveller, and as I may say, an Inhabitant; as also by what I had for∣merly observ'd when I had traded thither, toge∣ther with what I could collect from the Inhabi∣tants, which I thought I could depend upon for Truth, and was material to my Purpose; and which, for this very Reason, <HI>viz.</HI> to give this Account all at once at the Conclusion of my
<PB N="385" REF="394"/>
Book, I forbore to intersperse in the Course of it, because I would not break the Thread of my Narration: But as these People have many con∣fus'd Notions, consisting of a Mixture of the <HI>Guinea</HI> Traditions, brought from thence by their Forefathers, and the too-too common <HI>Romish</HI> Le∣gendary delusive Miracles, I shall omit most of such Fopperies, as being no less tedious to relate, than they would be impertinent to read.</P>

<PB N="386" REF="395"/>
<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE Islands were first discovered by the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> but I could not learn from the Natives the exact Time, nor by whom; but there were then no Inhabitants on any of them, nor Cattle of any Kind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> settled first on St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which is not only the largest of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, but the most fruitful: from whence, in process of Time, they Peopled most of the others; some of which, they were forced to quit again for want of Sustenance, occasioned by extreme Droughts, and want of Rain, which rendered them so barren, that of late a great many Souls were famished to Death: This Drought has con∣tinued for this Sixteen or Seventeen Years at <HI>Bona</HI>
<PB N="387" REF="396"/>
<HI>Vist,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and longer at the Isle of <HI>Sal;</HI> and none of them of late have had the rainy Seasons so kind as formerly; but the high Lands have always the most; and the Natives will tell you, That the Mountains draw, and gather the Clouds together, 'till they are so ponderous, that the Air being unable to bear their Weight any longer, they break and fall down in Rain; but the low Islands, such as <HI>Sal, Bona Vist, May,</HI> &amp;c. not having such high Mountains to detain and gather the Clouds together, they blow over, which, they say, occasioned the Drought there, more than at the other Islands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who first settled on these Islands, and particularly on that of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> had Slaves from <HI>Guinea;</HI> and, as it was an usual thing with them (and is continued to this present Time) when a Man or Woman died, to set one or more of their Slaves free, which they do as a meritorious Act of Atonement for their Sins; and the Climate being more agreeable to the Constitutions of those Blacks, than to the <HI>European Portuguese,</HI> they in∣creased much faster, and found Means to get themselves transported to the neighbouring Islands, where they could live more free from the Op∣pressions of the Whites, who used them after the <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>Portuguese</HI> proud and lording Manner, which did not so well agree with those but lately manumitted Blacks; and as they improved in those Islands, some of the Whites settled there also; but after the Trade to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> became common to other Nations, and the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Trade declined, and dwindled away, as at this Day, to a Trifle, to what it was at first; the Blacks all the Time increasing more than the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> they claimed an equal Degree of Liberty and Freedom with their Masters, who thereupon mostly returned either to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> or to <HI>Portugal;</HI>
<PB N="388" REF="397"/>
and those that remained, were both poor, and few, and were then necessitated to allow the Blacks, if not to be their Superiors, yet, at least, to be their Equals; and marrying with them, the suc∣ceeding Generations became by that Mixture, from Mallattoes, to Copper-coloured Negroes; so that now you shall see as great Variety of Negroes on those Islands, as is contained on the whole Coast of <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> claiming these Islands by Right of first Discovery, as soon as he found them thus inhabited, gave them to such of his Lords, as he thought fit, excepting St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and, of late, St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, which are governed by Men commissioned by him, who are commonly <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> born; especially the Governor of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> who is dignified with the Title of General Gover∣nor of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, and the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> from <HI>Rio Senegal,</HI> to <HI>Sierra Leon,</HI> &amp;c. Those Lords put a Stock of Cows and Goats on their respective Islands; and he who is constituted that Lord's Steward, is called Governor by the Natives, but hath no Power of punishing, either by Fine, Limb, or Death; the Governor of St. <HI>Jago</HI> only having that Power; but since the Establishment of the Office of an <HI>Ovidore,</HI> which is much the same with the Justices of Assize here in <HI>England,</HI> the civil Power is wholly lodged in him, as well as the Inspection and Management of the Crown Revenues, &amp;c. the Governor only ordering and managing the Martial Affairs.</P>
<P>As the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> has not much Profit from these Islands, although he hath made St. <HI>Jago</HI> the clearing Port for all Ships trading from any Part of his Dominions, to that Part of <HI>Guinea</HI> lying between <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> and <HI>Sierra Leon;</HI> so he is not at much Charge in keeping them, there being no Fortification on any of them, save St.
<PB N="389" REF="398"/>
<HI>Jago,</HI> and St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and on them, none of any Strength, except that at the City of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which was built by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when <HI>Portugal</HI> was subject to <HI>Spain;</HI> neither is the King of <HI>Por∣tugal</HI> at the Charge of keeping any Soldiers to de∣fend them, the Natives being obliged to serve in their respective Islands, but not out of them, which is all the Acknowledgement they pay to the Crown; neither are they able to pay any other Taxes. And this may serve for a general Account: I shall now proceed to a particular Account of each Island.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the Isle of <HI>SAL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS is the Windwardmost of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, and situated in Latitude 17°-00# North, and Longitude 5°-18# West, from the <HI>Cape de Verd.</HI> It is pretty clean all round, having no Shoals nor Rocks, and affords pretty good Roads to ride in, except in the rainy Season: The most noted whereof is <HI>Palmera,</HI> which is also the Town, and makes, as it were, Two Bays, there being a Rocky Point in the Middle.</P>
<P>This Bay lies on the West Side of the Island, and is easily known by Three Palm Trees which give Denomination to it, and are still standing there, and the only ones on the Island.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="399"/>
Bring them East-and-by-North of you, and run in 'till the little Island (which lies to the Southward of the Bay, about a Mile, or Half a League, and is always white with Fowls Dung, as if it had been covered with Snow) bears South-West, which is the best of the Road; you may, with a small Vessel, turn up into the Northern Bay, and Anchor any where in Three, or Three Fathom and a Half.</P>
<P>After you are about <HI>Raabadejhunk,</HI> it shews like a fine Bay, but it's all foul Ground; but af∣ter you are about the Point of <HI>Morderea,</HI> you may anchor any where in the Bay of that Name, in what Depth of Water you please, it being all clean Ground, where you may fill Water by setting an empty Cask into the Sand a little Way up from the Sea; there are several Bays where small Vessels may anchor at, but these are the Principal.</P>
<P>The Island is mostly low Land, having only Five Hills, that to the North being the highest, and that to the East, next; both which, appear in the Form of Sugar Loaves.</P>
<P>This Island formerly abounded with Goats, Cows, and Asses; But about the Year 1705, soon after which I went ashore upon it, it was intirely deserted, for want of Rain, by all the Inhabitants, except one old Man, who resolved to die on it, as he did the same Year; and the Drought was so extreme before this, for some Time, that most of the Cows and Goats died for want of Sustenance; but the Stock not being quite extinguished, and Rain coming, they again increased apace, 'till about Three Years after∣wards, a <HI>French</HI> Ship arriving there to catch Turtle, which come to this Island in great Num∣bers, and bringing with him about Thirty Hands from the Island of St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> in order to
<PB N="391" REF="400"/>
catch and cure the same; whether he was put from his Anchor by Stress of Weather, or by what other Means, they could never hear; but he left them there, and they having nothing else to eat, fed mostly on wild Goats, 'till they had destroyed them all but one, which is now on the Island, and is an old He-Goat, and mostly keeps upon the Northern Mountain: They killed also most of the Cows, and were at last forced to eat Asses; and so they impoverished the Island of its Cattle again.</P>
<P>After they had continued there about Six∣teen Months, an <HI>English</HI> Ship, bound for the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> to take in Salt, seeing the Smoak of several Fires which they made, sent his Boat ashore, thinking it might be some Ship's Company that was Ship-wreck'd on the Island; and under∣standing who they were, &amp;c. took them all in, and set them to their own Island of St. <HI>Antonio;</HI> and this I was informed of by one of the said Blacks.</P>
<P>When I brought the Blacks off, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1722, there was then, as the St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Blacks told me, Nine Cows and Bulls, and that old He-Goat above mentioned, which they had several Times seen, and a great many Asses; but not nigh the Number that was before the Drought.</P>
<P>At present the Isle of <HI>Sal</HI> yields nothing of Ve∣getables for Food, save a little Feshoon that was sown some few Years ago at <HI>Palmera</HI> in the Valley, which thrives there very well: They shed in <HI>October</HI> or <HI>November,</HI> and the Ground in the Val∣ley at that Time being soft, they lie till the springing Time, and then spring up again, and laying hold of the adjacent Silk Cotton Trees, they climb up like our Hops in <HI>England,</HI> and are fit to eat about <HI>August;</HI> the Silk Cotton Tree, you may find very exactly described by Captain
<PB N="392" REF="401"/>
<HI>Dampier;</HI> but I do not know of any Use it serves for, save, that in the Islands of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> St. <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI> St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and St. <HI>Anto∣nio;</HI> they fill Beds of it, as we do with Feathers in <HI>England;</HI> and it makes the best Tinder of any thing that I know of in the World; and the Wood makes a quick, but not a durable Fire, and when well dried, by Friction will suddenly take Fire.</P>
<P>The Dates that are produced here, are as good as any on the Coast of <HI>Africa;</HI> but there is but one of the Three Palm Trees that bears Fruit.</P>
<P>For about a Month after the Rains, there is a running Brook of fresh Water in the Valley of <HI>Palmera;</HI> but then it dries up: However, 'till after <HI>Christmas</HI> you may commonly get fresh Wa∣ter there, by digging a Well a little above the Palm or Date Trees.</P>
<P>There is abundance of Land Crabs thereabouts, like those in the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> I shall say nothing in this Place concerning the Turtle, and the Manner of catching and saving it, referring my Reader to what I have mentioned on that Head in my Account of taking the St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Men off this Island, 1722.</P>
<P>All about the Island, abounds with many Sorts of Fish; and one Sort, by the Blacks called <HI>Mear,</HI> being about the Bigness of a Cod, but thicker, and much flatter, and will take Salt, and cure as well as Cod; where, I am sure, a Ship might get a Cargo of Fish, much sooner than they could at <HI>New-found-Land;</HI> and, for ought I know, might do as well to sell, especially at <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> and be caught with less Charge, Salt being so nigh; and a Man might have Blacks from St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> or St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> who are very dextrous, both at catch∣ing, as also at splitting, salting, and curing, as well Fish, as Turtle.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="393" REF="402"/>
<HEAD>Of the Island of <HI>BONA VISTA;</HI> or, <HI>GOOD SIGHT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SO called by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> because it was the first of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands discovered by them. The Body of this Island lies in 16°-10# N. Latitude; and in 5°-14# West Longitude, from the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> on the main Continent of <HI>Guinea;</HI> its Length the longest Way, which lies South-East, and North-West, is Eight Leagues, and Breadth, North-East and South-West, where it's broadest, about Fifteen Miles.</P>
<P>This Island, about Thirty or Forty Years ago, was supposed to be the fertilest of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, for Cows, Goats, Hogs, Horses, Asses, Maiz, Pompion, Feshoon, Water Melon, and Potatoes; of which last Sort, I heard an old Man relate, that about Forty Years ago, the Go∣vernor of <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> among some other Presents, which he sent by an <HI>English</HI> Ship that loaded Salt there, and was to touch (as most Ships do that trade in that Commodity) at St. <HI>Jago</HI> for Water, sent a Potatoe of that Bigness, that I thought in∣credible; but the Simplicity of the Relator, as well as that he had no Inducement, that I know of, to move him to stretch it farther than the Truth, makes me apt to believe the Relation; which was, That the Potatoe was so big, that they were forced to sling it with a Rope, and two Men to carry it on a Hand-spike, as Brewers carry a Barrel of Beer.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="403"/>
But at this Time, there are no Potatoes grow there, and very little of any thing else; the Cows are likewise all destroyed, except about Forty, which belong to the Lord of the Soil, who was the old Marquess <HI>das Minhas;</HI> but since his Death, 'twas given by the King to some other <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> Nobleman: But since this, Captain <HI>Ma∣nuel Domingo</HI> got an <HI>English</HI> Ship to bring him a young Heifer, and a young Bull, which he bought of him; and when I was last there with Captain <HI>Harfoot,</HI> he told me his Stock was increased to Seven.</P>
<P>Most of the Inhabitants have Goats; the Milk of which, since the Famine, is a great Part of their Sustenance, as Fish and Turtle are another; their whole Dependance for the rest, is on <HI>English</HI> Ships that come there to lade Salt, who often times hire some of them to work in the Salt Pans, and likewise are forced to hire Asses, and Blacks to drive them, to bring the Salt down to the Sea Side to ship off; for which they pay them in Bisket, Flower, &amp;c. or old Cloaths, or what else they bring with them for that Purpose.</P>
<P>They used to have a pretty good Trade for their Asses and Horses, which are the best of all that are upon the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, which they sold for Cloaths, Provisions, and Money, when they could get it, or that their Necessities for Food were not so great.</P>
<P>Raw Silk is much coveted by them, for work∣ing the Bosoms of their Shirts, Shifts, Caps, Womens Waste-coats, and Coifs, which they do very dextrously, considering.</P>
<P>The Men generally use the <HI>European</HI> Dress, and few but what have Suits of Cloaths bought of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and have learned to make Cotton Cloths to imitate the <HI>European</HI> Fashion.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="404"/>
The Women, when dressed, have Cotton Cloths; and, according as they are industrious or nice in spinning, some finer, some coarser, some with One, some Two or Three of those Cloths wrapped about them like Petticoats, and tied with a Girdle above the Hips, or sometimes without a Girdle, the Corner of the Cloth only tucked in; their Shifts are made like a Man's Shirt, but cut off so short, that it don't reach low enough to tye under their Girdle; the Wrist-bands, Collar, and Neck, of the highest Sort, especially the younger, are wrought in Figures, with Silk of divers Colours, with the Needle; but the poorer, particularly the older Sort, content themselves with blew Cotton Thread to work their Bosoms, Collars, &amp;c. with; over their Shifts they wear a Waste-coat, with Sleeves to button at the Arms, not above Four Inches deep in the back Part, but long enough before, to tye with Strings under their Breasts; and over all, a Cotton Cloth, in manner of a Mantle; which the married Women generally have of a blue Colour, and the darker the Blue, the richer it's reckoned; but the Maidens and gay young Wives, or Widows, wear blue and white Cloths, some figured, as they call it, others spotted: Some are so nice as to have white Cotton; but rather, if they can get them, Linnen Handkerchiefs wrought along the Edges, and sometimes the Corners only, with Silk, mostly red, green, and blue, the first being the Colour most admired among them, as well as by all the Inhabitants of those Islands in general, the latter being the only Colour they can dye, which they vary to several Degrees, by making it darker or lighter.</P>
<P>The Women wear no Shoes nor Stockings, ex∣cept very few of them, and that only on Holidays; but some of the Men are so used to Shoes and
<PB N="396" REF="405"/>
Stockings, that they can as little bear to go bare∣foot, as we in <HI>England;</HI> but I think there is not above Two or Three of those upon this Island.</P>
<P>But though this be the Manner of their Dressing on Holidays, yet, on other Days, both Men and Women are mostly naked, the Women only wear∣ing a small Cotton Cloth wrapped round them as high as their Waste, and reaching down to their Knees, or a little lower, and the Men a Pair of old Breeches, which, if there be but the Waste∣band, and a Piece hanging to it before to hide their Privities, it's reckoned sufficient; or, for want of this, they wear the Remnants of an old Waste-coat, hanging all in Tatters about them; and were they the best Cloaths in the World, they will not so much as sew a Seam, if ripped.</P>
<P>They are very lazy, both Men and Women; and though this Island yields more Cotton than all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands beside, yet there is not one Island where there are fewer Cotton Cloths to be bought, or dearer sold, than this of <HI>Bona Vist;</HI> for they will neither gather the Cotton 'till they know of a Ship or Vessel to buy it, nor will their Women spin, but as they want; so that if a Man should go there when the Cotton Season is over, he will scarce be able to buy One hundred weight on the Island, though, I am certain, they might gather yearly more than a good Ship's Cargo, Cotton Shrubs growing there in common: And though at several of the Islands, Cotton, of late Years, hath failed, yet, at <HI>Bona Vist</HI> it never failed yet, and with little Charge, might be turned into <HI>Guinea</HI> trading Cloaths; so that it might be no difficult Matter for a Man to have One or Two thousand Barrafools (i. e. trading Cloths) in a very little Time, for Six-pence or Eight-pence <HI>per</HI> Barrafool, which, in our Measure, is about Five Foot and a Half long, and Four Foot broad;
<PB N="397" REF="406"/>
but each Island has its different Measure, and this Quantity, at any Time and Place where Cotton Cloths vend (which is on a considerable Part of the Coast of <HI>Guinea)</HI> would purchase at least, One hundred Slaves, or other Commodities proportionable; and sometimes half the Quantity more.</P>
<P>This Island likewise yields Plenty of Indigo, which grows as the Cotton does, naturally, they taking no other Pains with it, but to gather it when they have Occasion for it. They have not the Way of separating the Tincture, as is practised in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> &amp;c. which, if they had, and were industrious, there might be a great deal made there; and I do not know, but it might be worth while to bring it to <HI>England,</HI> even as they make it up, which is only by pounding the Leaves of the Shrub, while green, in a wooden Mortar, with a wooden Pestle, such as they use to pound their Maiz in (for they have no kind of Mills to grind with on any of the Islands) and so reduce it to a kind of Pap, which they form into thick round Cakes, some into Balls, and drying it, keep it 'till they have Occasion to use it for dying their Cloths.</P>
<P>I remember when I was at that Island some Years ago, I bought Six or Eight of these Cakes for a Tryal, and when I came home, I gave them to a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who car∣ried them home to his Wife, telling her, It was Indigo unrefined, which she endeavouring to use for the blueing of her Linnen and Starch, could not extract the Tincture in the usual Way, and so hove it away as good for nothing: I did expect he would have carried it to some one that knew how to extract the Tincture out of it, so as to have been able, with some Exactness, to know what Quantity of Tincture, or, as it's commonly
<PB N="398" REF="407"/>
called, Stone-blue, might be contained in such a Quantity of those Cakes, and from thence to compute whether it was worth while to trade for it there; I not knowing then myself how to make that Experiment, which I have since learned of the Natives of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who extract the Tin∣cture by a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> though, I doubt not, but that there may be better Ways than that.</P>
<P>There is a small Quantity of Ambergris found here, but the Inhabitants, for the most Part, adulterate it, by mixing with it a Sort of Jelly or Excrement cast on the Shore there; so that it's not worth buying, unless by one that could distinguish that which is adulterated, from that which is not.</P>
<P>This Island abounds with Fish, but not near so plenty as at the Island of <HI>Sal,</HI> though I have myself haled at one Draught with a Seyn, Fifty-six Mul∣lets, besides a vast Quantity of other Fish; and about the Rock which lies off from the Island called <HI>John Letton,</HI> Fish are as plenty, as at the Island afore-mentioned.</P>
<P>This Island is low Land for the most Part, with some rocky Mountains and sandy Hills; the Coast on the East Side sandy, and from the South-East Point, round to the Southward, and from thence to the <HI>English</HI> Road, the Coast is all sandy, mostly of a whitish Cast, except here and there some black rocky Cliffs.</P>
<P>There are but Two Roads used by Ships in this Island; the most noted is <HI>The English Road,</HI> which lies to the Southward of the <HI>little Island.</HI> It is a large clean Bay, with several little Shoals which spit out from the Northermost Side of the Bay; and you may anchor any where from Thir∣teen to Four Fathom, but not within that Depth, for fear of the aforesaid stony Shoals: There is a Rock which extends South-West from the South
<PB N="399" REF="408"/>
Point of the <HI>little Island</HI> about a Mile, which is steep close to the Side of the <HI>little Island;</HI> but else all round about it are gradual and sandy Shoalings. The Channel between this Rock, and the <HI>little Island,</HI> is clean, and near the Rock is Nine Fathom; but as you are nigher the Island, it shoals gradually till you come into Five Fathom, which is nigh enough to venture: The best Riding is to bring the South Point of the <HI>little Island</HI> North-West, and anchor in Five Fathom Water.</P>
<P>The other Road is called, <HI>The Portuguese Road,</HI> which, though it is nothing nigh so good as the <HI>English Road</HI> for landing, yet it lies nigher the Town, and is clean, having nothing to hurt you but the Shore, after you are to the Southward of the Shoals of <HI>Calyete St. George,</HI> till you come to the South-East Point, saving, that you must give the North-West Point of the Bay a small Birth, the Point running flat out a little way.</P>
<P>The Rock of <HI>John Letton,</HI> lies from <HI>Calyete St. George,</HI> South-West, about Five Leagues, from whence, in clear Weather, you may see <HI>Bona Vist;</HI> the ragged Mountain over the Town, which is the only one on that Island, bears from the Rock North-East-Easterly; the North-East End of the Rock is above the Water, and shews about the Bigness and Height of a light Ship of Two or Three hundred Tuns Burthen; and is steep too on the North-East End, stretching away West-South-West, and East-North-East, about half a League in Length.</P>
<P>I passed over the West-South-West End of it, in Ten Fathom Water; I could then see the Bottom very plain, which was rocky, and I could discern Swarms of Fish; I lay to, as soon as I was clear of it, it being a fine light Gale, and smooth Water; and in less than a Quarter of an Hour, we got as much Fish as we could tell what
<PB N="400" REF="409"/>
to do with, and then I made Sail; it broke then only about the Rock; but I have passed by it, when the Sea run high, and then I saw the Sea break on the Shoal, as nigh as I could compute it, above Half a Mile in Length.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> naturally love the <HI>English</HI> Nation, and most of them can speak a little of the <HI>English Tongue,</HI> and even some of the Women make shift to understand one in it.</P>
<P>The Governor, whose Name is <HI>Singore Pedro Letton,</HI> is an honest Man; but Captain <HI>Manuel Domingo,</HI> is not only the fairest Dealer, but the most sensible Man that I have conversed with of a Black, on all the Islands, and his Word may be depended on. He can read both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and hath a <HI>French</HI> Bible.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Isle of MAY,</HEAD>
<P>LIES in the Latitude of 15°-12# North, and Longitude 5°-29# West, from <HI>Cape de Verd.</HI> It bears from <HI>Bona Vist</HI> South-by-West-Westerly, about Fourteen Leagues, and is low Land, for the most Part like the former, having Three Mountains, the highest being the South-Easter∣most, called <HI>Pinosa,</HI> the Northermost St. <HI>Antonio.</HI></P>
<P>The North, and North-East Parts of this Island, are very rocky, and full of Shoals; some lying off the Land a good Way; the most dangerous, is a Ledge of Rocks which extends from the North-East Side the Length of a League, and at low Water is almost dry in some Places: Between that and the Shore, is a Channel, where is Water
<PB N="401" REF="410"/>
enough for a Ship to run through, but is dange∣rous, unless one is well acquainted with it.</P>
<P>There are Two Roads for Ships to ride in, and several little Coves, where a Boat might run in; but I shall not trouble myself, nor my Reader, with the Description of the latter.</P>
<P>The Northermost Road is called <HI>Paa Seco,</HI> where you may anchor in Six, Seven, or Eight Fathom Water, bringing the Eastermost Point of the Bay North-West of you; the Ground is stony, but doth not much damage a Cable, except you chance to fall among the Coral Rocks; but letting go your Anchor in Seven or Eight Fathom, and the Point North-West, or North-West-by-North, you will have the best of the Road. The Coast down along almost to the Point of <HI>Yingdost,</HI> is full of stony Shoals and Banks; some of them extend near Two Miles from the Shore.</P>
<P>About the Point of <HI>Yingdost,</HI> lies the <HI>English</HI> Road, where the Salt Ships ride; 'Tis mostly foul Ground, and rocky towards the <HI>Bluff Point,</HI> which makes the South Point of the Bay. The North∣ermost Part of the Bay is almost as bad for cutting a Cable, but not liable to hook an Anchor, as the South Side is, by reason of the Rocks. 'Tis generally said, That the <HI>West-of-England-Men</HI> fouled this Bay, by heaving their Stone Ballast over-board in it. The Middle of the Bay is the clearest Ground, and from Twelve to Eight Fathom, the best Depth to ride in, except in the latter End of <HI>June,</HI> or <HI>July,</HI> when you ex∣pect shifting Winds, and then it's better riding out in Fifteen or Eighteen Fathom.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are much the same with those of <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> but not altogether so well affected to the <HI>English.</HI> They have run the same Calamity for want of Rain, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s those of <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> but have more Cows, and these generally the best and fattest
<PB N="402" REF="411"/>
on all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands: They have also most of them Goats.</P>
<P>They are mostly <HI>Blacks,</HI> having few <HI>Molattoes,</HI> and no <HI>Whites</HI> among them; and are the hardest∣favoured of all the Islands.</P>
<P>They have Cotton on the Island sufficient for their Use, and to spare, but are so lazy, that they lose above half of it, for want of gathering; and formerly had more than they have now; but the want of Rain, hath dried up a great Part of their Cotton Shrubs, though they never had one Tenth of the Quantity that <HI>Rona Vist</HI> hath.</P>
<P>Their Habits are almost the same with those on <HI>Bona Vist;</HI> but few wear wrought Shirts, Waste∣coats, Shifts, &amp;c. as the Inhabitants of <HI>Bona Vist</HI> do.</P>
<P>This Island affords Fish, but not so Plenty as that of <HI>Bona Vist;</HI> and they catch Turtle there, but not in any great Quantity.</P>
<P>The most noted Man in this Island, is Captain <HI>Vincent Alva,</HI> commonly known to the <HI>English</HI> by the Name of <HI>Peter Vincent.</HI></P>
<P>There are sometimes found here, small Quan∣tities of Ambergrise.</P>
<P>The Number of Souls computed to be on this Island, is something above Two hundred.</P>
<P>There is some Indigo here, but not much; there is also here wild Fowl, the <HI>Gallina Pintato,</HI> or <HI>Guinea Hen.</HI></P>
<P>There is on this Island, as on most of the others, and particularly at <HI>Bona Vist,</HI> an Excres∣cence, or vegetable Stone which grows and shoots in Stems or Stalks, much like the Head of a Col∣liflower, or as Coral does, but is more porous, being of a greyish Colour, and much like those Stones generated or produced by Shells, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="412"/>
This Island owes its Name of <HI>May,</HI> to its being discovered on the First Day of the Month so called.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Island of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> or St. <HI>James.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WAS also discovered the First Day of <HI>May,</HI> the Festival of that Saint, which occasion∣ed it to be called by that Name. It lies in Lati∣tude 15°-00# North, and Longitude 6°-05# West from the <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> and was the first of these Islands that was inhabited by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and is the principal, as well as the largest, and fruit∣fullest of them all; and as it hath the most Rains, so it hath the most running Brooks, best Pasture, and greatest Variety of Fruits.</P>
<P>This Island always remained in the King's Hands, and enjoys the Privilege of obliging all Ships to clear there, that trade by the Northward of <HI>Sierra Leon</HI> to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and being a convenient Place to trade from to <HI>Guinea,</HI> occasioned several Merchants to settle, and a Manufactory of Barra∣fools, to be carried on there, 'till, as I hinted be∣fore, that their Trade declined; however, it gave Occasion to replenish this Island with Inhabitants, who held their Lands by the Gift of the Crown, which was given for the better Encouragement of People to settle there, without any Reservation of Acknowledgement, by Way of Tax to the Crown; to them and their Heirs for ever; and does mostly belong to the Whites, who are the fewest in Num∣ber, as not holding the Proportion of Three to Forty of the Blacks.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="413"/>
The Certainty of the Land being theirs, and their Heirs for ever, encouraged them to make a better Improvement, than the other Islanders, who shift their Landlords or Proprietors, as often as the King pleases; except the Island of St. <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI> which also being in the King's Hands, is upon the same Foot as that of St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P>This Island hath, as I observed, Plenty of Water, many Vallies, and, as it affords good Pa∣sture, so it abounds with Cows and Goats, and hath a Sufficiency of Sheep, Hogs, Horses, Asses, Fowls of all Sorts, as <HI>Guinea</HI> Hens, Peacocks, and other Hens; which last fly out in Flocks to feed on the Mountains, and return Home to roost eve∣ry Night, like Doves in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There are good Oranges here, both sweet and sour, Lemons, Tamarinds, Pine Apples, Guavas, Custard Apple, Bananoes, Plantans, Cocoa Nuts in abundance, Maiz, Feshoon, <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, Pompion, Water and Musk Melons, and Mandy∣okes in great Plenty; as also Sugar-cane, whereof they make some Sugar, but mostly Molosses; they have likewise some Grapes, and the Natives say, Vines would thrive very well among them, which I believe; but they are not allowed to make Wine, the King, for some Reasons, having abso∣lutely prohibited it.</P>
<P>There are Four Towns on this Island, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>Jago,</HI> St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> St. <HI>Domingo Abaceu,</HI> and <HI>Villa de Praya,</HI> besides the City called <HI>Cidada de Ribeira Grande,</HI> where the Governor, Ovidore, &amp;c. as also the Bishop, who is stiled Bishop of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, and of all the Coasts of <HI>Guinea,</HI> resides; and the latter hath his Country Seat about Three or Four Miles out of the City, called <HI>Trinidade (i. e.</HI> Trinity)</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="414"/>
Here also is a religious House of Cordelier Friers, who are the only Men on these Islands who constantly eat fresh-baked, as well as fer∣mented wheaten Bread; Flower, &amp;c. being sent them yearly from <HI>Portugal.</HI> They have very fine Gardens, stored with Salads, and the best Fruit on the Island; and have brought a Part of the run∣ning Brook of <HI>Ribeira Grande,</HI> not only to run through their Gardens, but also, in a manner, to every Part of their House, which, except the Cathedral, makes the best Prospect in or about the City.</P>
<P>The present Bishop is of the same Order with those Friars, but yet they cannot agree; insomuch that a while ago, he threatened to shut them up in their Convent, if they ever concerned them∣selves with any thing out of it, either Ecclesiasti∣cal or Civil; before which Time, they used to expose the Ignorance of the Negro Priests educated at St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but now are obliged to concern themselves with the Business of their Convent only.</P>
<P>Most of the Priests among these Islands, as also those sent to <HI>Guinea,</HI> are black, and the present Bishop more esteems them (as making better and soberer Clergymen) than those that are sent from <HI>Portugal,</HI> who, for the most Part, are, I do not say illiterate, for then I should include almost all the Clergy of <HI>Portugal,</HI> they being confessedly the most illiterate and ignorant of all the Clergy in <HI>Europe;</HI> but those sent hither, are generally Men of such loose, vicious, and scandalous Lives, that for the Credit of their Function, if they ex∣pose themselves to no Crime liable to the Inqui∣sition, they are sent Abroad to the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, <HI>Guinea, Brasil,</HI> &amp;c. but this Bishop be∣ing a mild-tempered Man, and these Banditti, as I may call them, partaking more of the Qua∣lities
<PB N="406" REF="415"/>
of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Saturn,</HI> than of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> it was impossible their Tempers should be very agreeable to each other. It is possible, indeed, that there may be here and there a Person of ano∣ther Character among these profligate Priests, be∣cause sometimes, the Want of Friends to get into a Benefice, may oblige a sober Man to desire a Mission Abroad, purely to keep him from Want.</P>
<P>They bring up abundance of young Blacks at St. <HI>Jago</HI> for the Priestly Function, and as soon as they have resolved to be such, they and their Friends, endeavour to make an Interest with some of the Canons, or Chaplains of the Bishop, who are <HI>Europeans</HI> (no Black being admitted to the Dignity of Bishop, Canon, or Chaplain to the Bishop) and when by Presents, Friends, &amp;c. they have procured one of those Dignitaries to be∣come their Patron or Tutor, who yet seldom en∣deavour or take any Pains to instruct them; they next apply themselves to the Bishop, to let him understand, that they have got a Patron, who generally goes with them, or some Clergyman of his Acquaintance, and acquaints him, that they are resolved to study and qualify themselves for the Priestly Function; the Bishop then asks them several Questions, and lays before them the Dig∣nity of the Office, and the Pains, Chastity, and Sobriety, required to qualify them for so high a Calling, &amp;c. to all which they promise to use their utmost Endeavour to conform; and then he gives them his Blessing; and having obtained a <HI>Latin Grammar,</HI> with some catachistical Books, explaining the common Parts of their Religion, they put themselves in a Student's Habit, which is a long close Garment, and a Cloak, both made of black Bays. Out of these Books, they endea∣vour to get as much by Heart as they can, and in the Evenings, they meet in some shady Street,
<PB N="407" REF="416"/>
there they argue, dispute, and ask one another Questions about what they have studied, or got by Heart out of those Books; the chiefest of their Grammatical Disputes being about the Declensions of Nouns, few of them attaining so far, as to vary a Verb through the Moods and Tenses, and consequently you must conceive, they cannot make one <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence as it ought.</P>
<P>As soon as they have learned as much as they can out of these Books, by this Method, they are again introduced before the Bishop, who examines as he thinks fit; and those who are ripest, he or∣ders them some other Books to study in, with Directions; all which Books they pay for.</P>
<P>As soon as they have a while practised them∣selves in these other Books, they make a Third Appearance before the Bishop, having first past their Examination before the <HI>Palustre,</HI> who is Vi∣car General under the Bishop, and first Judge of the Inquisition, and dignified with the Title of <HI>Doctor Theologia,</HI> though, perhaps, he knows lit∣tle of it; who certifies the Bishop, who is quali∣fied, and who is not; which Qualification depends pretty much upon the Greatness or Smallness of the Present, &amp;c. made him; and according to this Certification, the Bishop gives the Ordination of the lowest Order, and then they are sworn as well to Secrecy of those Mysteries which they have learned, as those they shall learn, which, as yet, are none of the highest; in which they con∣tinue 'till their Merit, or Interest, fits them to receive the Second Degree, or Order; namely, The <HI>Evangelii,</HI> and then they have Liberty to read and peruse the Liturgy, and may officiate in assisting the Mass-Priest, by reading the Epistles and Gospels.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="417"/>
The <HI>Graduate</HI> then makes all the Interest he can to obtain the Third, and highest Degree, which is the <HI>Missal</HI> Order; before the Receiving of which, he is again sworn in the most solemn Man∣ner, to continue constant and obedient to Holy Church, submitting to, and believing every thing commanded by her, as likewise to keep secret all the Mysteries of Religion, not allowed by Holy Church to be exposed to the Secularity; and, without Doubt, much more than can be expected any of them would declare to me: after which, their chief Business is to make Interest for a Bene∣fice as soon as they can.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese Blacks being, for the most Part, home∣br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and ignorant Men, after they have been brought up to that Function, take great Care not to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Crime, that would expose them to the Danger of the Inquisition, or the Bishop's Displeasure, either of wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, would be sufficient to ruin them; being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>possess'd with a Notion, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f they w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re to flee away, they could expect no Reception in a foreign Land, especially in <HI>Europe,</HI> among Christians <HI>(i. e.</HI> Roman-Catholicks) and that if they were to go to the Hereticks, they must eternally be damned in the future State, and certainly be Slaves during this Life.</P>
<P>These Notions having imbib'd themselves, they take all Opportunities to perswade their Auditors to the same Opinion, and to inculcate into the poor People's Minds, that all those that are out of the Communion of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> are certainly, as long as they so continue, in a repro∣bate State; and to make them the more odious, deny them the very Name of Christians, inso∣much, that many of their Priests, and most of their People, believe, that even Baptism, which is, as it were, the entering and registering a Man into that holy Community, is us'd by no People
<PB N="409" REF="418"/>
in the World, save the <HI>Romish</HI> Church only: And, indeed, 'tis usual, both with Clergy and Laity, not only in these Islands, where they know nothing but what they are taught, by those who make it a great Part of their Study, to render the Reform'd Religion as odious as the Mahome∣tan; but even in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> if they put the Question whether you are a Protestant or Roman, they ask, <HI>If you are a Christian?</HI> which, they think, you cannot be, if you are not a Roman.</P>
<P>This Island of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> on the South-East End, is flat Land, but all the rest, except <HI>Campo de Terra-fall,</HI> is mostly mountainous; the highest is <HI>Peek Antonio,</HI> which is near the Middle of the Island, and may be seen above the rest of the Mountains on either Side of the Island, at the Distance of three or four Leagues off; at a less Distance than which, the other Mountains inter∣cept your Sight. The high Hill of <HI>Terra-fall,</HI> if to the Eastward or Westward of the Island, at the first making, shews like an Island, till you run nigh enough to raise the Low Land.</P>
<P>The most noted Port for Shipping about this Island, is <HI>Porto Praya;</HI> which lies about the South-West Point of the Island, and is easy to be known by the Town and Fortification on a pretty high flat Land, in the Middle of the Bay, and a Valley <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n each Side, making a pleasant Prospect, diversify'd with Cocoa-Nut Trees, and Palm Trees.</P>
<P>There is an Island on the North-West Side of the Bay, behind which a small Vessel may ride safer, as well as smoother, than in the open Bay; which, however, is very large and clean, and you may ride in it from fifteen, to five or six Fathom, in clean Sandy Ground, and in some Places Clay; but within that Depth, till you come into three
<PB N="410" REF="419"/>
Fathom, it is tough Owse; and within that Depth Sand again.</P>
<P>About two Leagues from <HI>Praya,</HI> West-North-West, lies <HI>Cal-yete St. Martin,</HI> which, if you are design'd to go into, you must take a Black on Board at <HI>Porto Praya</HI> to shew you the Land, there being nothing to hurt you but what you may see.</P>
<P>It's a narrow Cove, not above half a Cable's Length broad, and runs in from the Westermost Point about a Quarter of a Mile; having within about 16 or 18 Foot Water. You moor with an Anchor off, and a Stern-fast ashore to a Tree in the Middle of the Beach, which is full of small Stones. You may lie secure here all the rainy Season, and here you may Water also. It is about four Miles to the City by Land from this Place; and there is not much ascending or de∣scending in the Journey; but the Way is very stony.</P>
<P>The City lies about a League to the North-Westward, in a very ordinary Road, being so very foul, that it's much but you cut your Cable, if you lie any Time; or, if you miss that, you may probably so hook your Anchor in the Rocks, that ten to one but you leave it behind you.</P>
<P>There have several Vessels been lost in this Road, which is the Reason that of late few Ships go there, unless by chance a <HI>Portuguese;</HI> though formerly some of the <HI>Dutch East India</HI> Ships have touch'd there for Refreshment and for Water, which runs into the Sea there; but for several Years past, <HI>Porto Praya</HI> hath been only us'd, where is good Watering also.</P>
<P><HI>Rivera de Plata</HI> is a very good Bay, all over clean Ground, where you may anchor in what Depth you please, from three and a half to twelve or fourteen Fathom Water, and is a better Place
<PB N="411" REF="420"/>
to water at than <HI>Porto Praya,</HI> the Water running down to the Sea-side, where you may rowl your Cask into the River, and fill your Water at the Bung, without using Bucket or Funnel. You may have all Sorts of Refreshment at this Bay, as Fruit, Roots, Fowls, Goats, and Cows, much cheaper than you can buy them either at <HI>Porto Praya,</HI> or the City; and I have known when a Cow has been sold at <HI>Porto Praya</HI> for eight Dol∣lars, which is 6000 Reas, that a much better has been sold at <HI>Rivera de Plata</HI> for 2500 Reas; and when Maiz has been sold at <HI>Porto Praya</HI> for 400, it has, at the same Time, been sold there for 200 Reas.</P>
<P><HI>Terra-fall</HI> is the next considerable Port, which, although it's a good Road when in, except in the shifting Winds Season, yet it's very troublesome to turn up into, and a Place that yields no Commo∣dities for Trade.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Porto Faciendo,</HI> which is a fair large Bay, being clean, thwart the Beach, from ten to four Fathom Water. You may also fill Water here; but this Part of the Island being mostly Pasture Land, you can have little other Refreshment, save Goats and Cows, which you may have as cheap as on any Part of the Island. I remember I bought a young Bull, about two Years and half old, for an old Shirt, which was not worth Sixpence in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>You may have Monkeys here, and on all Parts of this Island; which of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands alone produces that Creature.</P>
<P>There are several Coves and little Bays betwixt this Road and the <HI>Bickude,</HI> which is the Norther∣most Point of St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but the Place is not only barren and uninhabited, but dangerous to venture in, the Coast all along being rocky, some under,
<PB N="412" REF="421"/>
othersome above Water; but don't lie above a Mile off from the Shore.</P>
<P>After you are about the <HI>Bickude,</HI> the Coast runs to the Southward of <HI>Porto sine Nome,</HI> which I shall pass by any farther Description of, as hav∣ing had occasion to mention it before.</P>
<P>The next Bay is <HI>Porto Formosa,</HI> which is a fair Bay, being mud up at the Head of it round the Point, where a small Shallop might lie Landlock'd from all Winds; but not being convenient for Trade, I pass to the next Port; which is</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jago;</HI> which is remarkable enough to be known, there being a Church, the Outside of which is whited with Lime, and cover'd with red Pantiles, and stands upon a rising Ground, and therefore seen at a great Distance. It's thwart the Middle of the Bay, and has a Valley both on the South and North Side of the Church, well planted with Cocoa-Nut and Palm Trees. The Bay is clean sandy Ground, and a Ship may safe∣ly anchor in ten or twelve Fathom Water. A little to the Northward of the Church there com∣monly runs a great Sea along Shore, which is sandy.</P>
<P>This is one of the plentifullest Places on St. <HI>Jago,</HI> for whatsoever Things the Island produces; and the People are very free, somewhat like the Temper of those of the Isle of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>South-by-East, about two or three Miles, lies the <HI>Porto Madera:</HI> It's narrow going in, being not above a large Stone's-cast wide, between two rocky Points; but steep too on both Sides, having nine, eight, seven, six Fathom Water in; and after you are shot in about the Northermost Point, you have four, and further in, three Fathom and half. You are then Landlock'd for all Winds, and can see no Sea, and may secure a Ship of three hundred Tons with a three Inch Rope; for
<PB N="413" REF="422"/>
let the Wind blow which Way it will, you have very little when in. Its Bottom is Sand, mixt with Clay; but higher up it's soft Mud: It is a very good Harbour, when in, and neither dan∣gerous, nor difficult, there being nothing to hurt you going in, so you don't run ashore against the Rocks: It's difficult for a Stranger to find it, be∣cause one Point locks or shuts in the other so, that you can't perceive the Harbour till you are past it, nor any thing remarkable enough to know it by: The only way for a Stranger to run into it, would be, to take in one of the Natives on Board at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> to shew him the Port.</P>
<P>There are several Bays betwixt <HI>Porto Madera</HI> and <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> but a little dangerous, having many sunken Rocks lying along the Coast, but not any farther off the Shore than one Mile, nei∣ther are they fit for Ships to ride in.</P>
<P><HI>Porto Lobo</HI> is a very safe Harbour, when in, for all Winds: The Entrance is but narrow, not above half a Cable's Length broad, with several sunken Rocks lying on each Side of the Entrance, which makes it too dangerous to venture into it without a Pilot, or unless a Man had been in be∣fore: When you are in, it shews as if you were got into a Bason or Lake, being about three Quarters of a Mile every way; but you have not above twelve or fourteen Foot Water within, ex∣cept under the Northermost Point, where you have eighteen or twenty Foot. It's all muddy Ground till you run up to the Bottom of the Lake, and then it is Sand. A little to the North∣ward of <HI>Porto Lobo,</HI> the mountainous Land of the Island of St. <HI>Jago</HI> terminates, and, except some Hills, is flat; yet mostly high champion Land down to <HI>Porto Praya.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="423"/>
Betwixt <HI>Porto Lobo</HI> and <HI>Praya,</HI> is the Road of St. <HI>Francisco;</HI> which is a fair sandy Bay, with Cocoa Nut and Palm Trees in the Valley, but is foul Ground in most Places of the Bay; neither is there any fresh Water there nigh the Sea.</P>
<P>About a League to the South-Westward from St. <HI>Francisco,</HI> is a Cove call'd <HI>Portet,</HI> being a good Road for Shallops, or small Vessels, but not fit for great Ships: There lies a sunken Rock about two thirds on the Starboard Side going in.</P>
<P>The next Road is <HI>Porto Praya,</HI> which was de∣scrib'd before.</P>
<P>There is Abundance of that Marchasite which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Beur d'ore,</HI> some of which is a little transparent, and othersome more opake, being in the Shade of a dark blueish or purple Colour; but when the Sun-beams are reflected upon it, casts a golden glistering Colour; and I have heard some Gentlemen, who had resided some time in several Parts of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and were conversant with People concern'd in the Mines there, say, It was an infallible Sign of a Gold Mine, where-ever any great Quantity of that <HI>Beur d'ore</HI> was; and likewise told me, That the said purplish Marchasite, if ground fine, and mix'd with Oil, made any thing painted with it, look as if it had been gilded; which Experiment I never try'd.</P>
<P>The finest Red that ever I saw, was on this Island, in a Hill on the North Part of St. <HI>Jago:</HI> It was much after the Manner of the Chalk in <HI>England,</HI> but softer; and when I scrap'd some of it with a Knife, it felt as fine as the finest Flower: It run in Veins, and next to the deep, yet lively Red, run a Vein of a fainter Red, then a Vein yet fainter, next to that a Flesh Colour, then a Sort of Yellow, then a Yellow much of the Colour of common Brimstone, after, or above that, variously
<PB N="415" REF="424"/>
colour'd; and so grew harder, the farther from the Red, till it came to the Hardness of a common Rock. The red Stone was something heavier than Chalk. I had a Piece of that, and some of the <HI>Beur d'ore;</HI> but when I lost my Boat at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> I lost them, with several other Curiosities of the like Nature.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Island of St. <HI>PHILIP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Island of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> commonly call'd by the Name of the Island of <HI>Fogo,</HI> or <HI>Fire,</HI> lies about 16 Leagues from St. <HI>Jago, viz.</HI> from the Point of <HI>Terra-fall,</HI> to the North-East Point of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and they bear West-South-West and East-North-East, being in the Latitude of 15°-20# North, and Longitude 6°-54# West from the <HI>Cape de Verd.</HI></P>
<P>This Island was discover'd by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> the same Day that the Isle of <HI>May</HI> and St. <HI>Jago</HI> were, <HI>viz.</HI> the 1st Day of <HI>May;</HI> so that the Isle of <HI>May</HI> bore the Name of the Month, and the other two the Name of the two Saints, whose Commemoration is observ'd on that Day.</P>
<P>This Island was uninhabited a great many Years after it was discover'd, till the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> granted to his Subjects, who would people it, all the Land that they improv'd, to them and their Heirs for ever.</P>
<P>The Natives have a Tradition, which how true I shall not undertake to determine, but is by them believ'd as undoubted Fact, that the first Dwellers upon this Island were two Fryers, who chose to be
<PB N="416" REF="425"/>
put here to pass the Remainder of their Days in a hermitick Life.</P>
<P>Whether these two Fryers were Mineralists, Metalists, or Alchymists, or any, or all of them, I can't tell; but the Story goes they were Con∣jurers; (You must know when this Island was first discover'd, it had no Peek, nor was there any burning upon it, the Peek growing but since the Fire broke out; and, by Report of the ancient People, hath sensibly increas'd within their Times) but whatever the Fryers were, they found a Gold Mine, and there took up their hermitical Abode; and after they had got as much of that precious Metal as they thought sufficient, they concluded to put an End to a hermitick Life, and take the first Opportunity of a Ship to <HI>Europe:</HI> But one of them, who suppos'd himself the Master, requir'd more than half to his Share, which the other by no Means would grant; whereupon the Contest grew so high, that they fell to conjuring to do each other a Mischief; and conjur'd so long, that they set almost all the Island in a Flame, in which they both perish'd; after which the Fire went out, except where the Peek now stands, which ever since hath continu'd to burn and cast up Stones till this Day, and God knows how long it may continue.</P>
<P>Indeed it is almost incredible to believe the vast Rocks which are cast out, and to what a vast Height; the Fall of which again, and their break∣ing and rowling down, may very easily be heard eight or nine Leagues in a still Air, and this my own Ears confirm'd to me. When they are blown up, you may hear a Report like a great Gun, or rather Thunder. In the Night-time I have seen the Stones rowling down the Peek all of a Flame, and the Inhabitants say, that they have seen Brimstone run down the Peek like
<PB N="417" REF="426"/>
a Torrent of Water down a steep Mountain, and sometimes may gather what Quantity they please.</P>
<P>I have had several Pieces of it, which the In∣habitants gave me: It is like our vulgar Brimstone, but of a much brighter Colour, and, in the burn∣ing, gives a brighter Flame.</P>
<P>Sometimes this Vulcano heaves out such Quan∣tities of Ashes, mix'd with Cinders, that it covers the adjacent Parts, and hath smother'd some of their Goats.</P>
<P>The Island is much higher than any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, and is, as it were, one con∣tinu'd Mountain up to the Top; neither as you sail along it, can you perceive any Vallies, but, as it were, one single Mountain, the Vallies ap∣pearing only as Gutters made by the Waters run∣ing off the Mountain in the Rains; but when a Man is ashore, and in one of those Gutters, they then appear to be deep Vallies, and the Banks of those Gutters great high Mountains. This Island, considering that it hath no running Brooks, and that it is but in very few Places that fresh Water is to be had, insomuch, that the Inhabitants are forced, in some Parts, to go six or seven Miles for their Water; yet it's very fertile, for Pom∣pion, Water-Melon, Feshoon, and Maiz; but for want of Water, or low Vallies, produces no Banana's, Plantanes, or hardly any Tree-Fruit, save Wild Figs.</P>
<P>They have some few Guava Trees planted in some of their Gardens, also a Crab Orange and Lemon, likewise Lime, and a Sort of Crab Ap∣ple; but they have here and there some good Vineyards, whereof they make little Quantities of an indifferent good small Wine, something like the white <HI>Fyal</HI> Wine; but they generally
<PB N="418" REF="427"/>
drink it all before it clears, or has done ferment∣ing.</P>
<P>This Island was inhabited by <HI>European Portu∣guese,</HI> some time after the Fire had been extin∣guish'd, except that of the Peek, and had the Land, by the Crown Gift, settled to them and their Heirs, as has been said; which <HI>Portuguese</HI> brought Negro Slaves with them, and a Stock of Cows, Horses, Asses, and Hogs; the King pla∣cing Goats there, which run wild on the Moun∣tains; the Profit of their Skins being reserv'd to the Crown, and he that hath the Management of them, is call'd <HI>Captain of the Mountains,</HI> none daring to kill any of them but by his Licence.</P>
<P>The Land is all taken up at present, only about the Peek, and that great high Mountain which runs along South-East and North-West, and is little inferior in Heighth to the Peek, and where, at present, those wild Goats haunt, and is the Limits of the <HI>Capiteen de Mountainhu's</HI> Juris∣diction.</P>
<P>The Customs of St. <HI>Jago</HI> are in use here, <HI>viz.</HI> to free Blacks at their Death, and perhaps some manumitted Blacks might settle there from St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but however it was, they at present exceed the Whites a hundred to one.</P>
<P>It's probable, when Trade decay'd, some of them might leave the Island, as they had done at St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P>They planted Cotton in abundance; and this was the greatest Mart for Cotton Cloths of any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands; and here the <HI>Portu∣guese European</HI> Ships us'd to trade for Cargoes of Barafools for <HI>Guinea.</HI> The free Blacks, for the most Part, are Tenants to the Whites, who have taken up most of the Land, especially near the Sea; some Whites having thirty or forty Slaves, and some of the free Blacks have Slaves,
<PB N="419" REF="428"/>
which they purchase for Cotton Cloths, which pass there in the room of Money, a Cloth being valu'd, and passing current among them for 1000 Reas; but by the last Drought, all their Cotton Shrubs, in a Manner, were dry'd up, so that that Cotton, which was before the chief Product of their Island, is now a good Commodity to carry there: And this Scarcity of Cotton here, and at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and the <HI>European Portuguese</HI> under∣standing that the <HI>French</HI> Ships, which traded there formerly, used to buy those Cloths, as did like∣wise the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> they procur'd an Order, with a Penalty on any one on these Islands, who sold Cloth to any but Subjects of <HI>Portugal;</HI> which Order is strictly observ'd by the Officers of the Customs at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> tho' not much minded here, by Reason there are no Duties paid at this Island, and consequently no Custom∣house, or Office.</P>
<P>Since the Trade of Cotton Cloths fail'd, they have sold a great many Slaves to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships trading there; but they are endeavouring to revive this Branch again, by planting Cotton; tho', for want of a Sufficiency of Rain, it does not thrive so well as it us'd to do.</P>
<P>They us'd also to have a pretty good Trade with the <HI>French</HI> for Mules, which they bred in good Quantities, and sold cheap; but the dry Sea∣sons destroy'd them almost all, so that they told me, that six Years ago, there were but two Mules on the Island; but they have lately began to breed them again, and mightily wish some <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> Ships would come and trade with them for them; but whether it be that the <HI>French</HI> have found a better Place to trade, or that their Islands in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> do not require them now so much as formerly, or that they do not yet know that they can be supply'd as heretofore, I can't
<PB N="420" REF="429"/>
tell; but since they have fail'd of Mules, there has been no <HI>French</HI> Ship there to trade.</P>
<P>They have a great Desire to trade with the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> and would, they say, reserve their Commodities for them; and notwithstanding the Prohibition of not selling Cotton Cloths to Foreigners, yet they say if the <HI>English</HI> would trade there, they would sell their Cloths to them.</P>
<P>This Island is clean on the North-West, West, and South Parts; but on the South-East, East, and North-East Parts is rocky; tho' these Rocks do not lie above a Mile from the Shore, neither do they lie thick, but here and there one, some above, and some under Water, except one Rock, which lieth about four Miles off from the North End of the Island, having, as I have been in∣form'd, twelve or fourteen Foot Water on it. I have seen the Sea break over it, when it blew hard, else not. It's not large, and is clean all round it.</P>
<P>This Island hath not many Places to anchor at, and but two where you can trade; for at the rest, you cannot get up the Rocks; for it's all, except the <HI>Villa La-Ghate,</HI> and two or three other Places on the Sea-coast, such steep high rocky Clifts, that you cannot get up any where else.</P>
<P>The most noted Road is <HI>Fonte de Villa,</HI> which is right against the Town, and is sandy, except when a strong North Wind blows, which often sweeps or scours away the Sand, and leaves the Rocks at Bottom bare, which is about <HI>November, December,</HI> and <HI>January,</HI> and then 'tis not so safe riding as about the Point of <HI>Nossa Singora,</HI> which is a sandy Point, to the Southward of the Town; to the Southward of which, on the Clift, is the Church of <HI>Nossa Singora,</HI> from which the Bay and Point took their Name. Here is good riding for a Nor∣therly Wind, and better when the true North-East
<PB N="421" REF="430"/>
or North-East-by-North Trade Winds blow, being clean and sandy at Bottom, except when a southerly Wind blows strong, or sometimes by a southerly Sea, which now and then runs here in the Months of <HI>June, July, August,</HI> and <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI> when those Winds do not reach home to the Island, tho', I believe, they blow in the Offing, which sweep away the Sand, and leave the Rocks bare at Bottom, as the Northerly Wind and Sea do at <HI>Fonte de Villa.</HI></P>
<P>You may anchor in both those Roads, from 14 to 10 Fathom Water, in clean sandy Ground, except in the Cases before mention'd. More Southerly there is a little sandy Bay about a small Point of low broken Rocks, and right against a Gully made by the Water running down in the Time of the Rains: Here is smooth riding, as well as landing, the Surff running but little here; and you have Water pretty near, which you have not at the other two Places; and the Sea generally runs there with a great Swell on the Shore.</P>
<P>You must anchor right off the Gully, having it fair open; for if you shut it either to the North∣ward, or Southward, and anchor so, you will have foul Ground; neither is there Room for above two Ships to anchor there at once.</P>
<P>The chief and only Man for Trade there, is Captain <HI>Thome Santee;</HI> but there is not one on the Island, that can either speak or understand <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>They are on this Island all <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, yet have some Pagan Superstitions mingled with the Romish, by the Mountaineer Blacks. Most of the Whites, with the Governor, live in the Villa; tho' most of them have their Country Houses abroad in the Country, on that Part of their Estates which they keep in their own Hands, and manage by their Slaves, which supplies them
<PB N="422" REF="431"/>
with Food; and the Rents of those Plantations which they let to the Blacks, are commonly paid in Cotton Cloths, which, as was said before, are used there in the Stead of Money, as Tobacco was formerly wholly, and now partly, in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Maryland;</HI> and since their Cotton Shrubs were dried up, and for the most Part perished, the Owners were forced to fill those Plantations with Hogs, Fowls, or what other Animals the Blacks could raise.</P>

This Island hath not been inhabited above Two Ages, which might be the Reason of giving it the Name of the Island of <HI>Brava,</HI> or <HI>wild Island;</HI> for <HI>Brava,</HI> both in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Creole</HI> Tongue, signifies <HI>wild.</HI></P>
<P>It was, for several Years, only inhabited by Two black Families, who lived wholly in Heathen∣ism, 'till, about Sixty Years past, a Famine rage∣ing at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, some of the poorer Sort of Blacks procured themselves to be put on the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> by a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship, who were joyfully received, as well as relieved, by their Fellow Blacks the first Inhabitants, who having much increased the Stock of Goats, Cows, and especially Hogs, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had placed on all the Islands when they first discovered them, those first Inhabitants, understanding the <HI>Portuguese</HI> brought their Fellow Blacks from St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, purely out of Compassion to prevent their being starved, freely offered to load the Ship with Hogs, as a Reward for their Charity; which so thinned their Hogs, that by the Time the Ship was loaden, they had but few left, and so they catched and killed, or tamed the Remainder.</P>
<P>These Blacks which came from St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, soon begot in them the Notion of Property; so that he that could kill, catch, or tame most, had most; and soon reduced all the Cattle on the Island to <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> except the Goats, which, to this Day, remain wild; but are claimed as the Property of the Lord of the Soil, as are all the wild Goats on the Islands.</P>
<P>After these Blacks had been some Time settled on this Island, the St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Merchants having a large Boat, managed by a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Sailor, whom they had hired, and used to send to St. <HI>Jago</HI> with Cotton Cloths, when the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> Ships missed coming to trade there; one of
<PB N="424" REF="435"/>
the Priests of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, out of a Godly Romish Zeal, to try what he could pick up among the poor Shepherdless Blacks at St. <HI>John</HI>'s, got the Proprietors of the Boat to send her with him over thither, and he making known the pious Occasion of his coming, and his Power of par∣doning their Sins, and thereby sending them easily, and yet certainly, to Heaven, let their Actions be never so bad; and the Impossibility of their going thither, let their Actions be never so good, without a Sacerdotal or Priestly Admittance by Absolution; and a great Part of these Notions being also instilled into those first Inhabitants, by their Brother Blacks, who lately came from St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, the pious Padre had little more to do, than to baptize them as they were, without in∣structing them much further in the Principles of Religion, it being sufficient to believe that they were Christians by their Baptism, and, that they were sure to go to Heaven, and, at the Resur∣rection, to be changed white, &amp;c. and so he mumbled over a Mass, which neither they that heard it, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he that read it, understood; where∣by he got what he went for; for those Blacks which came from <HI>Fogo,</HI> or St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, having taught the others how to spin Cotton, which naturally grew there, and to wear it (they before going stark naked, as most of the Negroes on the Coast of <HI>Guinea</HI> do) the Reverend Padre got Cloths of those that had them, and single Breadths from others, Cotton Thread, or Yarn, from others, Cotton from those that neither had spun nor wove, and from others Indigo, which like∣ways then grew common, though it does not now; from others Hogs, Fowls, &amp;c. the good pious Padre refusing nothing that was brought him, which he thought worth receiving, and when he had got as much as he thought he could well ma∣nage
<PB N="425" REF="436"/>
to get back in the Boat, he took his Leave of them, and prepared for his Return; the poor deluded Souls waiting on him down to the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> where his Boat lay; and he, in Return of their Kindness, freely gave them a parting Mass in a Cave there, which, ever since, goes by the Name of <HI>Fuurno de Padre.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly he took his Leave of them, telling them, <HI>That what they had given was to God, and that he was God's Steward, or Receiver;</HI> and, in∣deed, not only there, but in all the rest of the Islands, the People are persuaded, that whatever is given to the Priest, is given to God, unless they particularly dedicate it to some Saint, in which Case, they think they lay an Obligation on the Saint to whom they make the Present, to stand their Friend; and for which Saints, the Priests are also the Receivers, as well as of God: He promised, however, to return again, to give them a further Absolution for what Sins they should commit in his Absence; and so he returned laden home, and visited them yearly, or as often as he could, or found it would answer; 'till after some Years, as he was giving his Benediction, and saying a Mass for them in the afore-mentioned Cave, having not above Thirty Auditors (for it seems they began to suspect, for all their Igno∣rance, that the principal Motive of his pretended Piety, was Avarice, and therefore did not now so universally attend him down to the Boat, as at first) the Cave fell in, where the pious Padre re∣mains with all his Auditors, without being able to finish his Mass, 'till this Day.</P>
<P>They were heard groaning for Three Days after; but the Rocks and great Stones which fell in, and stopped their coming forth, could not be moved to let them out; and it was happy for the rest of the Inhabitants, that their Zeal was
<PB N="426" REF="437"/>
not so vehement as at first; for had they been all there, the same Fate would have befallen them, and the whole Island must have been intirely de∣populated.</P>
<P>The Boat-Men perceiving their pious Master fixed, and no Possibility of his coming forth, made the best of their Way home, where they gave the doleful Account of <HI>Singore Padre's,</HI> and his most zealous Auditors Imprisonment; and so the black Flock of the Island of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, re∣mained without an absolving Pastor for several Years, which gave them such an Opportunity of mingling the <HI>Pagan</HI> and <HI>Romish</HI> Superstitions so radically (making good that old Chymical Axiom, <HI>That Like easily unites and incorporates with its Like)</HI> that to this Day they remain unsepa∣rated.</P>
<P>Some Years after, the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> sent a Ship at his own Charge, to carry the Bishop, &amp;c. round the Islands, as well as all the Coast of <HI>Gui∣nea,</HI> for a general Visitation, who, out of his most reverend Piety, placed a Fellow there to be Priest; and when I was there, the then Priest was the Fourth, and, I don't doubt, was a Pa∣tern of his Predecessors, or, it might be, exceeded them in Learning; for he could make shift to read in his old Missal Book, which, I suppose, the Reverend Bishop gave him when ordained to that Function, which he calls and believes to be the <HI>Scriptura sagrade (i. e.</HI> Holy Scriptures) and told me so himself; and when I told him, that it was not, but that that Appellation was alone given to the Bible; his Answer was (for I had told him before, that my Country was separated from the <HI>Romish</HI> Communion, on Account of the Tenets they held in Contradiction of the undoubted Word of God) <HI>That to us the Bible might be the best Book that we had, because it was certain,</HI>
<PB N="427" REF="438"/>
<HI>that when we apostatized from the Holy Catholick Church, that that holy Book of the Mass, which far exceeds the Bible, was not given us by the holy Pope, it not being lawful for any to look into it, but Priests lawfully ordained by a</HI> Roman <HI>Bishop.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I urged,</HI> His not knowing for the most Part what was contamed in it, it being in <HI>Latin,</HI> a Language which he did not understand, any more than I, that never read it.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> He did not think that was any Im∣perfection in him, unless he was of a higher Order; and that to be able to understand it, was so sublime a Mystery, that it was not, that he knew of, taught to any black Priest; <HI>and added,</HI> That he knew enough, <HI>viz.</HI> What he should read to baptize, and marry; as likewise for the principal Holidays, and for <HI>Sundays;</HI> and whether he understood or not, God would never fail blessing the Effects of those Sacraments: <HI>He also said,</HI> That he could say or read the Office for consecrating the Body and Blood of Christ, and transubstantiating the Wafer into that true Body and Blood, as often as he read the Words of the Consecration, with an Intent to make the Sacra∣ment; though he did not, he confessed, understand the Meaning of one Word that he read; <HI>He urged the same for the</HI> Absolution, <HI>and</HI> Redeeming out of Purgatory, <HI>by the</HI> Absolution Office, <HI>and the</HI> Masses for the Dead, <HI>and a great deal of such Stuff; But notwithstanding all his high Pretensions, and the Ignorance of his Flock, there are several of the thinking Sort of these poor Innocents, that reve∣rence him only from the Teeth outwards, as we use to say.</HI></P>
<P>He baptizes, marries, and buries; but the Na∣tives have intermixed with those Rites, some of their old heathenish Superstitions, such as washing before Baptism, decking the Bride with Flowers, and a Garland, on the Marriage Day giving her
<PB N="428" REF="439"/>
bodily Worship, stripping her of all at Night, and putting Earth on her Head, in Token of Sub∣jection, sprinkling the Graves of the Dead with Water, and sometimes with the Juice of Water-Melons, and abundance of other Fooleries.</P>
<P>This Island, as I told you before, is very high, yet being so near the Island of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> it seems, in Comparison of that, to be but low.</P>
<P>It abounds the most with Salt-peter, of any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands; and the Governor of∣fered to engage himself to procure me a Cargo suf∣ficient to load with it, that Sloop, or even bigger than I lost there: It grows in several hollow earthen Caves there, and hangs, or covers all the Inside like a thick hoar Frost, and, in some Places, in Strias like Isicles; and in some hollow Rocks, and rocky Caves in great Strias, as thick as a Man's Thumb.</P>
<P>I tried several of the Earths of that Island, and extracted out of some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/32, others from 1/20 to 1/32, and, indeed, most of the Rocks abound with Nitre, which I experimented by taking those which crum∣bled, or separated into small Particles like Dust, from which the moist Air dissolved the Salt, which, perhaps, is the Gluten that binds them together when compacted as Stones; but we will leave this for the natural Philosophers to discuss.</P>
<P>This Island, I believe, doth abound with Cop∣per, and, perhaps, with finer Metals; for which I will give you my Reasons.</P>
<P>There are several Acid Fountains, perhaps, not wanting much of the Acidness of undephlegmated Oil of Vitriol, which I tried, for want of a better Manner, thus.</P>
<P>I put a clean Knife into these Fountains, and in about Half a Minute, it would be all over covered with Copper, looking near a Gold Co∣lour, so thick, that I could not perceive any Iron
<PB N="429" REF="440"/>
as far as the Knife was immerged, and held in the Water; and this was not a bare Colouring of the Iron, but coppered over so by letting it stand something longer, that when I had exposed the Knife to the Sun 'till it was dry, I could, with another, scrape off the Copper, which would be like Scales, and some in Powder, and where any Scratch, or the like, was in the Knife, it would lie as if it had been enammell'd, &amp;c. There are some of those Waters will much sooner copper a Knife over, than others; and where they run at a Di∣stance, the Acidity diminishes proportionable to their Distance from the Fountain Head.</P>
<P>There are several very heavy Sands and Earth of divers Colours, and some of them exceeding Iron, and not much, if any thing, yielding to Lead, in Ponderosity; some are of a blueish Black, others of a purplish; some of a bright redish, others of a dark redish Colour.</P>
<P>I remember, one Time I was a fishing on the South-Side of the Island, and being extreme hot, I laid by my Fishing-Craft, and scrambled up the Rocks to find a shady Place to smoak a Pipe of Tobacco; I found a Place to my Mind, and fill∣ing a Pipe, I took a Piece of dry Silk Cotton Tree, and cutting it into Two Pieces, by Friction I soon kindled it, and lighted my Pipe with it: As I was seriously smoaking it, contemplating, and looking about me, at a pretty Distance I perceived a Rock, on which the Sun reflecting his Beams, it glistered like burnished Gold: My Curiosity led me thither to inform myself better of the Occasion of it, and whether it was only the Sun Beams; and when I had clambered up to it, it looked exactly as if it was all thick gilt: I rubbed my Hand against it, but nothing came off; whereupon I took my Knife, and found I could scrape it off, but it was so thin, that I could collect scarce any
<PB N="430" REF="441"/>
of it; and where I scraped it off, the Rock ap∣peared, which was of a blackish Colour: I ob∣served, that the Rock was gilt only where the Water run down, in the Time of the Rains, from the Mountains.</P>
<P>I looked about, and espied another, which gli∣stered with golden Spangles: I went to that also, and found it all full of Gold Fibres, some as fine as Hairs, some as thick as an ordinary Needle, whereupon I took my Knife, and endeavoured to pick out some of this Gold, and got, I believe, near a Dram Weight, which was solid Gold, as far at I could perceive by the Eye; I had got one little Bit, like a small flatted Wire, about Half an Inch long, by cutting and raising the End up, and not being able to get any more out of the Rock, the Vein running deeper in, I was forced to break it off, by bending it backwards and for∣wards Three or Four Times, 'till it broke; and breaking my Knife with the Experiment, I desist∣ed, and came down again to my black Mates, without taking Notice to them of what I had seen; and a little before I went from the Island, I told the Governor of it, who would fain have had me gone down with him to shew it him, which Journey I found means to avoid; neither was it ever observed by any of the Natives before, and as they were not told the Place, so it's a Question whether they have found it yet.</P>
<P>This Island abounds with Fish, especially about the little Islands; where also, some Tortoise re∣sort at the Season of laying their Eggs; but they are not much regarded for Food, either here, or at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, or at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and yet at all the other Islands, they are accounted their most de∣licious Food; and, indeed, so they are.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="442"/>
To these Islands, <HI>viz.</HI> The Isle of <HI>May,</HI> but more to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and most at St. <HI>John</HI>'s, come at the usual Times of their Cooting, or what other Term you please to give it, the <HI>Baaleas,</HI> which is a Sort of <HI>Whale</HI> or <HI>Grampus,</HI> very common also on the Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> where they catch them much after the Manner that Whales are caught at <HI>Greenland,</HI> of which they make Train-Oil: and some of those People do confidently affirm, That the Ambergris is the Sperm of that kind of Fish, shed in the Water at the Time of their Cooting, and will tell you, that at first it is like a Jelly, and whitish, but acquires that dark Colour by degrees, in floating upon the Surface of the Water, and hardens afterwards to that Consistence we see it in.</P>
<P>They say likewise, That the Virgin or First Sperm evacuated, is white and transparent, and congeals white.</P>
<P>I myself have seen of that white Ambergris; but whether that be the Cause of its Whiteness, or that it proceeds from the Sperm of those <HI>Baa∣leas,</HI> I leave to the Judgment of others, 'till I have an ocular Demonstration, or at least a Rela∣tion, which I may credit equal to such.</P>
<P>I have seen a Male and Female play Three Days successively in the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> and constantly every Night go out to Sea, and come in again about Eight or Nine of the Clock the next Morn∣ing, and would lie and sleep an Hour or Two together, lying in the Water like the Hull of a Ship turned Bottom up, and it would not require much Skill or Pains, to strike a Harpoon into either, or both of them; the Male is not above half the Bigness of the Female.</P>
<P>There hath been formerly a great deal of Am∣bergris found about this Island, but very little now; there was a <HI>Portuguese</HI> about Thirty Years
<PB N="432" REF="443"/>
past, that was banished from <HI>Portugal,</HI> for some Crime by him committed, for a Term of Years, who got him a little Sloop, or Shallop, and traded with her among these Islands, and lighted on a Piece of Ambergris of almost an incredible Big∣ness, with which he purchased his Freedom to return to <HI>Portugal</HI> again, before the Term for his Exile was compleated; and moreover, if my Relator spoke Truth, purchased himself a plen∣tiful Estate, and never after went to Sea; the Man's Name was <HI>John Carneira,</HI> and the Rock near to which he found it, which was between the Two little Islands, is, at present called by his Name by the Natives, as well as by the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>This Island of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, hath several Bays, or Roads, where a Ship may anchor; but the prin∣cipal, and, indeed, the best about all the Island, is the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> which, in their Tongue, signifies an <HI>Oven,</HI> or <HI>Cave;</HI> occasioned either by the seve∣ral Caves thereabouts, or else because the Harbour is a close Bay, or Cave; for, indeed, if you hale in near the Rock called the <HI>Kaay,</HI> which is a very good Key, having Water enough for a First-Rate Man of War to hale along Side of it, you will lie Land-lock'd for all Winds; neither is there any Wind that blows in there, except from the South-by-East to the South-by-West, which heaves a Sea into the Bay, and makes it very well deserve the Name of a Harbour.</P>
<P>It's a little difficult to find, for one that never was in it; but I will endeavour to give as good Directions for that Purpose as I can.—When you are about the North End of <HI>Fogo,</HI> or St. <HI>Phi∣lip</HI>'s, and bound for <HI>Brava,</HI> or St. <HI>John</HI>'s, if it be any thing clear, you will then see the Island of St. <HI>John</HI>'s; but if it should be hazy, as often∣times it is, steer away North-by-West, if you be
<PB N="433" REF="444"/>
within Two Leagues off St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, and accord∣ing as your Offing is more or less, order your Course; with that Offing, that Course will bring you fair for the little Islands, the Eastermost hav∣ing a Bluff Hommock on the South End, the Westermost of the little Islands having a peeked Hommock; Run directly for the Eastermost of the little Islands, giving the North End of it an in∣different good Birth, and so run down along it at about a Mile distant, 'till you are abreast of the Bluff Hommock, on the South End of it, then steer directly for the North-East Point of the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> which is a low flat Point, which give a Birth to, of about half a Mile, 'till you are shot to the Southward of it, then hale in along shore, and run down within a large Cable's Length of the Rocks, 'till you come abreast of a Cave, and then you will see a low Point of a Rock shooting out a little Way from the high Land, about a Quarter of a Mile, or less, a Head of you: About that Point is the <HI>Fuurno;</HI> give that Point a Birth of something better than half a Cable, but not much more, for fear of not fetching into the Bay, which turns up like an Elbow, and you may anchor where you please; but nearest on the East Side is best.</P>
<P>If you have a Mind to moor, 'tis best done with a Fast ashore, and not Swing, but have a small Hawser ashore from the Stern to the North∣ward, where you will lie sheltered like (as the Name denotes, <HI>viz.)</HI> an <HI>Oven. Note,</HI> To come from the Eastward, to run for the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> you must be sure not to run about the South End of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s; for then, with an ordi∣nary Trade Wind, you cannot fetch the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> nor hardly any Part of the Island.</P>
<P><PB N="434" REF="445"/>
<HI>Faciend de Agoa,</HI> is a Bay lying on the North-West Side of the Island, and is a shingly Beach; it is easily known by the Banana Trees in the Valley, which is the only Valley of that Fruit that is visible from the Sea: You may anchor near the Middle of the Beach, nigher the North Side, where you will have clean Ground in Eight, Nine, and Ten Fathom Water, and a fresh run∣ning Water almost down to the Beach.</P>
<P>Farther down to Leeward, on the South-West Side of the Island, about a smooth low Point, but rising high suddenly, is the <HI>Ferrier Bay,</HI> it makes, as it were, Two Bays, by a high Bluff Rock in the Middle, dividing the Beach in Two, which, at a Distance, looks like Shingle, but is large pebble Stones. This is a fair Bay, and smooth Landing-Place, with a large Pool, Lake, or Bason of fresh Water, behind the South-East∣ermost Beach, which is always fed by the Water running down from the Mountains, through the Valley to it; this Bay is all over clean Ground, in some Places Sand, but mostly a Sort of a tough, stiff Ooze, or Clay, and commonly the Sea runs smooth on the Beach; there is a Kaay, or Rock, on the North-West Side, to which you may put the Boat, and would be a good Riding-Place, were it not for the strong Flaws which come down the Valleys; which, when it blows any thing of a Gale, those Flaws are prodigious violent, inso∣much, that a Ship cannot turn into it, and often∣times, when at an Anchor, may be forced out, as I gave you an Instance before, in the <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI> who left his Anchor and Water Cask be∣hind him, and could not beat in again.</P>
<P>These Gales are mostly in the Months of <HI>No∣vember, December,</HI> and <HI>January,</HI> the rest of the Year, except in the rainy and shifting Wind Sea∣son, which then is not safe Riding in this Road,
<PB N="435" REF="446"/>
which lies open to the South-East, South, and South-West Winds, which bring in a great Sea, and would put any Ship ashore, that should be caught here in any of those Winds, when strong; but else, as I said, it's good riding here, and you have, in fine Weather, especially in the Months of <HI>March, April,</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> a Southerly Breeze from the Sea in the Evening, but never, in those Months, to raise any Sea; and all the Night, and 'till Ten or Eleven in the Forenoon, an Off-shore Wind.</P>
<P>This is the Road most used by Shipping, be∣cause very few are acquainted with the <HI>Fuurno.</HI></P>
<P>There are other Bays, as <HI>Scio,</HI> which is a fair sandy Bay, but 'tis difficult to come down the Rocks to it, neither is there any Water; likewise the <HI>Salt Point Bay,</HI> where I lost my Sloop; but the rest are so insignificant, that I shall omit giving any farther Description of them.</P>
<P>In the Leewardmost of the little Islands, about the South-West End, there is a little Cove, where a small Vessel might lie very well; there are, in∣deed, some great Stones or Rocks in it, but you may see the Bottom, as you may in most Places about these Islands, in 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12 Fathom Water; and you have Room enough in that Cove, to moor, and swing clear of those Stones; and thus much for a Description of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I shall next take the Island of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in my Way, as being the Windwardmost of those Islands yet undescribed.</P>

I came to know the Quantity, by the Tythe paid the Priest. It is oftentimes sold at 3<HI>l.</HI> or 3<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s. per</HI> Pipe; but there is hardly any to be got by <HI>Christmas;</HI> and the Time of their Vintage is <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>They had a great Plenty of Goats, Hogs, and Fowls, before the late Famine, which although it did not hold there so long as on some of the other Islands, being but three Years, yet, while it last∣ed, was severer than in any of the others; for being an Island of little Trade, affording no Com∣modity for Foreigners, but Asses, which are like∣wise common to the other Islands, they seldom had above one or two Ships in a Year; and those Animals not being in so much Request in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> as usual, they sometimes have not
<PB N="437" REF="448"/>
had a Ship once in two Years, which has necessi∣tated them to be more industrious than any of their Neighbours; for they can, and do make Cotton Cloths as fashionable as our common Coun∣try Tailors, and will make Buttons to imitate al∣most any Pattern you shew them: They knit Cotton Stockings, tan Goat and Cow Hides, and make tolerable Shoes; and their Women by far are the most housewifely and ingenious with their Needles, of any of the Islands; and she that does not appear with a wrought Coif, like those afore describ'd wore by the <HI>Bona vist</HI> Women, is look'd upon as an idle Person: They are also more modest, never appearing out of their Houses, nor within, before Strangers bare; which at St. <HI>John</HI>'s is common; and, except when they are out a planting, or weeding, or gathering in their Harvest, they are always at work with their Needles, or spinning, if they have any Cotton, which now is scarce; for that Drought destroy'd that Commodity here, as it did that of all their Neighbours of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, <HI>Bona vist</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>They make the best Cloths and Cotton Quilts of all the Islands; but they are too good for the <HI>Guinea</HI> Trade, but do well for that of <HI>Brasil,</HI> for which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> were wont to touch there.</P>
<P>It used to abound most with wild Goats, as well as Cows, which all belong'd to the Lord Pro∣prietor, who was the old Marquess <HI>Des Minhas;</HI> but since his Death, the King hath reassum'd it into his own Hands, as he has also St. <HI>Lucia</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> which, with St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> all belong'd to that Marquis, the latter only being his Here∣ditary Estate, and not held at the Pleasure of the King: And this Nobleman used every Year to send a Ship for the Goatskins and Hides, which
<PB N="438" REF="449"/>
was all the Profit he had out of those Islands, ex∣cept St. <HI>Antonio</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Islands of St. <HI>Lucia</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent</HI> being uninhabited, are reckon'd dependant upon that of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the Governor whereof has told me, That he had ordinarily shipp'd off for <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI> as a Year's Production, without diminishing the Stock, (for that is their Rule, only to kill the Number they think the Stock increases yearly) 2000 Goatskins from those Three Islands, and oftentimes upwards of 100 Hides from St. <HI>Nicho∣las</HI> only, the other two Islands having no Cows on them; and these 2000 were all the Skins of He-Goats, the She being the Perquisite of the Steward or Governor, (as they call him) as well as all the Flesh of the Cows and Goats, who has Power to give or sell it, as he pleases.</P>
<P>But this was before the Famine had diminish'd the Stock, for since that, the People first eat their own Hogs, and tame Goats, and after destroy'd the Proprietor's Stock of Cows, and wild Goats; so that when I was last upon this Island, there were but forty Head of great Cattle, and the Stock of wild Goats was so diminish'd, that the present Governor told me, it would not be worth while to send a Ship for the Skins for three Years to come.</P>
<P>This Island did once very much abound with Dragon Trees, the Gum or Juice of which run∣ning out, when cut at a proper Season, yields the Gum call'd <HI>Sanguis Draconis,</HI> which is very well known to Druggists, and used in the Medicinal Art: They have a Way of cutting off the Branches at a proper Season, when the Gum or Sap runs, and boiling them in Water, from which they have an Artifice to separate the Gum, but 'tis not nigh so clear, nor, I believe, so good as the other: But some time ago, when Captain
<PB N="439" REF="450"/>
<HI>Avery,</HI> the Pirate, touch'd here, the Inhabitants some way disgusted him so, that he burnt all their Town, which is the most populous, as well as compactest, of any on all the Islands, and al∣though not built so large, nor the Walls cemented with Lime-Mortar, as the Houses at the City of St. <HI>Jago</HI> are, nor cover'd, not even the Church, with any thing but Grass Thatch; yet for Num∣ber of Houses, as well as regular Streets, it ra∣ther exceeds that City; and they being, more∣over, the only People that build and use Boats in those Islands, which destroy'd most of their wild Fig-Trees, (the only Wood fit for that Use) they were forc'd to cut down the Dragon Tree, which is a loose grained Wood, and hollow in the Mid∣dle, going tapering upwards, something like the Bore of a Pump; and with these Trees they roofed their Houses again, and most of them hav∣ing Chambers, they floor'd them with the Boards made of this Wood; so that now it is so scarce, that I question whether there be 20 or 30 Pounds of that Gum made yearly on that Island, and a great deal of that is adulterated too.</P>
<P>They have Horses now, which were brought over to this Island from <HI>Bona Vist</HI> about fourteen Years since, by one Captain <HI>Rollo,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman;</HI> since which Time they have increas'd so, that now they can supply a Ship with a Cargo of them.</P>
<P>I carry'd over to it in my Boat a yearling Heifer, from <HI>Bona Vista,</HI> which Captain <HI>Manuel Domingo</HI> gave me to kill on Board for Food, and would have given it to my Landlord <HI>Nicholau Gonsalvo,</HI> but he being a Relation of the former Governor, between whom, and the present Go∣vernor, there is but an outside Friendship, I found he would not let him keep it, pretending there was no Liberty given for any body to keep Cows,
<PB N="440" REF="451"/>
the Lord of the Soil reserving that for himself; I therefore gave it to <HI>Manuel Swaar Gum,</HI> a Re∣lation of the present Governor, who, after some Shew of Unwillingness, gave him Liberty to keep it, under pretence it was for me against I came again; and this in Time may increase, and make a Stock of Cattle, besides that of the Lords of the Soil.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Island are much ad∣dicted to Fishing, and catching of Turtle, which they mostly do in their Boats at the Islands of <HI>Chaon, Branca,</HI> St. <HI>Lucia,</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> (those Islands being, as I told you before, in the Pre∣cincts of the Stewardship of St. <HI>Nicholas)</HI> which they sell for ready Money, or what else they stand in need of; and the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who us'd to trade there for Cloths, and Cotton Quilts, as well to carry to <HI>Brasil,</HI> as to <HI>Portugal,</HI> used oftentimes to buy them for Money, having no such Commo∣dities as the Inhabitants lik'd, which they gene∣rally were supply'd with by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> who traded there for Asses, or to sell their Goods for Money; but as the Famine exhausted their other Stocks, so it did, in a great Measure, their Stock of Money; for a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship hap∣pening to come in there, in the Heighth of the Famine, being the first Ship that came with Pro∣visions, sold his Corn, which he brought from the Western Islands, for Cotton Cloths first, till he had got as many as he thought fit, and then would sell for nothing but ready Money; which swept away the best Part of the Coin of this Island.</P>
<P>The Island is at present fertile, and they begin to increase their Stocks of Hogs and Fowls apace, insomuch, that few Families but have Store of those Animals; and it is strange to see, how quickly they have increas'd them: I question, in
<PB N="441" REF="452"/>
such a Condition, whether our Politicks in <HI>Europe</HI> could, or at least would, have found out such a Method of universally stocking one another, with∣out either giving or selling, and that out of not above ten Hogs, and not many more Fowls, and not half the Quantity of tame Goats; so that now, very few, if any, but what have Hogs, and a great many of them Fowls, and, I believe, could furnish a Vessel with a Cargo of live Hogs on reasonable Terms.</P>
<P>This Island is mostly high Land, the highest being a flat Sugar-Loaf-like Mountain, I mean a rounding, not a sharp pointed Peek: It lies a pretty way up in the Land towards the West End. There is no good nor safe Road on this Island in the shifting Wind Season; but when the true Trade Wind is settled, there are three or four indifferent ones: That which is nearest the Town is <HI>Paraghesi,</HI> where is a Bay where you may ride off single, or moor'd, the Wind being always offwards from the Shore; or you may hale into the Cove of <HI>Paraghesi,</HI> and moor be∣tween four.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Cod</HI> of the <HI>Bight</HI> is the Road of <HI>Porto Lappa;</HI> this you can't miss finding, because it is in the very <HI>Cod</HI> of the <HI>Great Bight,</HI> on the South Side of the Island: This Road is foul Ground, and several Anchors have been lost there by the Cables being cut with the Rocks.</P>
<P>To the Eastward of <HI>Porto Lappa,</HI> about half Way between that and the East Point of the Island, is the Road of <HI>Currisal,</HI> where is a River of fresh Water close to the Beach: The best An∣choring is to the Eastward of the Beach, almost shut in; then you are abreast of <HI>Petra de Looma,</HI> a sunk flat Rock, over which the Sea always breaks, which, I suppose, gave it the Name of the <HI>Firy Rock,</HI> which that Name imports; but
<PB N="442" REF="453"/>
as these mention'd Roads are not commonly known, especially <HI>Paraghesi</HI> and <HI>Currisal,</HI> and there being nothing so remarkable on the Land, for a Stranger to be able, by any Description, to find them, which is the Reason so few use them; yet the Coast is so clean, that a Man may run along from the East Point, till within half a League of the South-West Point, within Call of the Shore; and there are always People either on the Look-out, which they keep all round that Part of the Island where a Ship may anchor, or a Boat land, from about the Middle of <HI>October,</HI> till the latter Part of <HI>June,</HI> or beginning of <HI>July;</HI> the Turnado Time, they think, being a sufficient Se∣curity for them from Enemies without a Look-out; or you may see Fishermen on the Rocks, to whom you may call, or send your Boat ashore, and have a Pilot to any Road you desire; or you may run with an easy Sail, or lie too a little, to give the People Time to gather down, and then you may easily discover the Port, by the Con∣course of People gather'd at it.</P>
<P>But the most generally known Road is <HI>Terra∣fall,</HI> which lies on the West Side of the Island: The best Mark to know it by, is the Natives great Boats, of which there never fails some of them being haled up ashore there: This is a clean Bay, and you may anchor any where in or about it to the Southward, but especially to the Northward, without any Fear of foul Ground.</P>
<P>There is a high <HI>Bluff rocky Point,</HI> which does not reach down to the Sea-side by near a Quarter of a Mile; between which and the Sea, it's low, stony, gravelly, and, in some Places, shingly Ground, the Shore being a pebbly Beach: On each Side this <HI>Bluff-Point</HI> is a deep Gully, cut very deep by the violent falling of the Waters in the rainy Times; out of which Gullies or Vallies
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="454"/>
<HEAD>The Dragon Tree.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="443" REF="455"/>
come violent Flaws or Gusts of Wind, when any thing of a hard Gale blows, and it is then very difficult to turn up into this Bay; but to avoid the Flaws of Wind coming out of these Vallies, you must anchor right against the <HI>Bluff-Point,</HI> which you may do in what Depth of Water you please, from sixteen to three or four Fathom, and then you will lie between the Gusts of those Val∣lies, which will come, as I have seen 'em, with such Violence, that they raise the Water, as it were, all of a Smoke; and in the Middle, between them, under the Lee of the afore-mention'd <HI>Bluff-Point,</HI> you may lie and ride very easy, in Comparison of what you would do by riding open to either of those deep Vallies or Gullies.</P>
<P>There is a Bank of Sand lies cross the Mouth of this Bay, on which is about ten Fathom, with∣in it is twelve, thirteen, and fourteen Fathom Water, and soft Ground, and then it shoals gradually to the Shore, till you are in four or five Fathom, where you have again Sand to the pebbly Beach.</P>
<P>There is good Watering here, by digging a Well almost any where in the low Land, unless the rainy Season hath fail'd; but at all Times you may water there, in a Valley about half a Mile from the Sea, from which the Natives will bring it down on Asses for a Trifle.</P>
<P>From this Road you may see, when the Air is serene, all the Leeward Islands; but else you can see none but the <HI>Isle of Dogs,</HI> or <HI>Isle Chaon,</HI> and not them, if it be any thing hazy.</P>
<P>These People speak the best <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and are the exactest <HI>Romans</HI> of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, not excepting St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and yet they are all black, or Copper-colour'd, with frizzled Hair, except a few of the <HI>French</HI> Race, left there by
<PB N="444" REF="456"/>
the Pirate <HI>Marenghwin,</HI> and three old <HI>Portuguese</HI> and two or three old <HI>Portuguese</HI> Women.</P>
<P>As they are in their Language most like the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> so are they like the vulgar Sort of that Nation, very Thieves to Strangers: And, where they take an Antipathy, very Blood-thirsty, being very dextrous at their Knives.</P>
<P>Before the Famine, they were computed to be above 2000 Souls, but now they are not above 13 or 1400: They have mostly a <HI>European Portu∣guese</HI> Padre, and it is as much as he can do, some∣times, to manage them; for notwithstanding they profess the simple <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, unmingled with Paganism, or any other Superstition, as most of the rest are, not excepting St. <HI>Jago;</HI> yet are they so headstrong and resolute, as I never saw any where practis'd by those of that Pro∣fession.</P>
<P>There are the same Sorts of Sands and Stones here as at St. <HI>John</HI>'s; and here the Natives have a Tradition, that there is Silver or Gold in them, but can't tell how to extract it; however, it is in few here, but at St. <HI>John</HI>'s almost every where.</P>
<P>On this Island is also good Nitre, as also that <HI>Beur d'ore,</HI> mention'd in my Description of St. <HI>Jago:</HI> There is also of it at St. <HI>John</HI>'s, but not so much, though altogether as glittering, and of a golden Aspect; but at St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> less than either, and also less glittering.</P>

<HEAD>The Island of <HI>CHAON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Island, or rather Rock <HI>Chaon,</HI> lies from <HI>Terra-fall</HI> West-Northerly about three Leagues, to which the St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Men go to fish with their Boats; between which, and <HI>Isle Branca,</HI> is all foul Ground.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD><HI>Isle</HI> BRANCA</HEAD>
<P>IS a high steep Rock, lying in Length East-South-East and West-North-West, about two or three Miles. The St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>-Men come here also to fish, and under the South Side is a Place where they can ride with their Boats; but if it blows, there come strong Flaws down the Rock, that they care least for fishing there, of any of the Rocks or Islands, unless it be very moderate Weather; tho' there is extraordinary fishing about this Island. There is on the South Side, a Vein of white Rock runs under the high dark rocky Land, which appears, at a Distance, like white Sand Hills, from whence, I believe, it took the Name of <HI>Ilha Branca,</HI> or <HI>White Island.</HI> It is broken Ground between <HI>Isle Branca</HI> and St. <HI>Lucia,</HI> with several Rocks, some under, and some above Water; yet a Ship may pass through safe enough
<PB N="446" REF="458"/>
by keeping a good Look-out; tho' I would not advise any body to it, unless acquainted with the Islands, or oblig'd by Necessity.</P>
<P>This Island hath what none other of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands produces, <HI>viz.</HI> Guana's, a Creature very like in Shape to a Lizard: They are well known in the <HI>West Indies;</HI> and there are some on this Isle of <HI>Branca,</HI> above a Yard in Length.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD><HI>St.</HI> LUCIA</HEAD>
<P>IS about three or four Leagues West-North-West from the North-West Part of St. <HI>Ni∣cholas:</HI> There is a good clean sandy Bay on the South-West Side, and another on the South-East Side; but here are no Inhabitants, nor Water for a Ship, nor likewise at <HI>Isle Chaon</HI> and <HI>Branca,</HI> these having no Cattle; but St. <HI>Lucia</HI> hath Goats and Asses.</P>
<P>The Channel between St. <HI>Lucia</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent</HI> is very foul, and so full of Rocks, that it's scarce safe to venture through, and not adviseable to at∣tempt it, unless forc'd by Necessity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="447" REF="459"/>
<HEAD><HI>St.</HI> VINCENT,</HEAD>
<P>IS also uninhabited: On the North-East Side it's low and sandy, but the rest mostly high Land, with sandy Bays, and several Roads to anchor at: The chief are, first, <HI>Bahia des Ghatt,</HI> which lies on the North Side; it goes in between two low sandy Points, and the Water is so smooth within, that you may lay a Vessel ashore without any fear of Damage: It's very difficult to come out with a Trade Wind, which blows right in the Bay, or rather small Gulf, which lies in North-East, for which Reason no Ships go in there: But the St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>-Men, when they come here to catch Turtle, use it, it being secure for their Boats, and from thence they row out, taking the Oppor∣tunity of a Morning Calm.</P>
<P>On the North-West Side, right against St. <HI>An∣tonia,</HI> is <HI>Porto Grande,</HI> a fair large sandy clean Bay, up in the North-East <HI>Bight;</HI> wherein is the best Riding, for there you may ride all Winds in six or seven Fathom Water. You may anchor any where in the Bay, for it's all over clean sandy Ground; and it is easily known by a high Rock, like a Tower, off the Bay, and clean all round. You may go on either Side of it; but if you are design'd for the great Bay, you had best go to Windward of it, leaving it on the Starboard Side, that you may fetch the better up into the Bay: If it blows a Gale of Wind, passing in under the high Land, you will have very hard Flaws of Wind; but when shot into the Bay, clear of the high
<PB N="448" REF="460"/>
steep Land, you will then have steady Gales. Here you may have both Wood and Water, and wild Goats, if you will take the Pains to shoot them.</P>
<P>About the South-West Point is another Bay or Road, call'd <HI>Porto St. Pedro,</HI> which is a clean Bay, where you may anchor in what Depth you please in sandy Ground; but when it blows, there come hard Flaws down the Valley, which makes it hard Riding there, unless in moderate Weather.</P>
<P>On this Island is the most Turtle and Fish caught of any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, ex∣cept the Isle of <HI>Sal.</HI> Here is also good Store of Goats and Asses, and almost as great Plenty of Nitre as at the Island of St. <HI>John;</HI> but there is more of a fixt fossile or marine Salt in the Nitre of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> than in that of St. <HI>John:</HI> For I have try'd both; the Nitre of St. <HI>John</HI> burning clean away, except near the Sea-side, but that at St. <HI>Vincent</HI> always leaving some fixt Salt behind; tho' in some Part of the Island it left less fixt Salt than in other Parts. I shall next pass to give some Account of the Island of St. <HI>Antonio.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Island of St. <HI>ANTONIO</HI></HEAD>
<P>LIES in Latitude 17°-19# North, and in 8°-2# West Longitude from the <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> and is both the Westermost and Northermost of all the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands. It's a very high Island, being little, if any thing, inferior to St. <HI>Philip's</HI> in that respect; and, considering the high Moun∣tains, and low Valleys, it contains as much Ground
<PB N="449" REF="461"/>
or rather Rocks, as St. <HI>Jago;</HI> and hath abun∣dance of running Brooks of fresh Water, which make the Vallies, through which they run, as fertile as any of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, for Maiz, Feshoon, Banana's, Plantanes, Potatoes, Man-d'yokes, Pompions, Water and Musk-Me∣lon, Oranges, Lemons, Limes, Guava's, &amp;c. and the greatest Plenty of Wine, tho' the ordi∣nariest, and, to make amends for that too, the cheapest of all the Islands.</P>
<P>They have Asses and Hogs, which are very large, as well as Plenty of them, a large Stock of Cows, and the Mountains are well replenish'd with wild Goats, both which belong to the Mar∣quis <HI>das Minhas,</HI> lately made Marquis <HI>de Gho-ve.</HI></P>
<P>This Island is also in the Vallies very woody; and here the <HI>Beur d'ore</HI> is gather'd, and a Quan∣tity sent over, as often as a Ship comes there for the Skins and Hides from <HI>Portugal,</HI> and is put on Board upon the Marquis's Account; but what Use it's apply'd to in <HI>Portugal,</HI> I could not cer∣tainly learn.</P>
<P>Here is found on one of the Mountains a trans∣parent Stone, call'd, by the Natives, <HI>Topaz;</HI> but whether it be the true <HI>Topaz,</HI> or no, I can't tell, as being no Lapidary.</P>
<P>Here is also <HI>Sanguis Draconis,</HI> or the Gum <HI>Dragons Blood,</HI> produc'd in great Quantities, the which, as well as the Stones, &amp;c. above menti∣on'd, as also all the Ambergrise found about the Island, belongs to the Lord of the Soil; for whom it is gather'd, and a great Penalty laid up∣on those who conceal, and don't immediately de∣liver it to the Governor: Yet it's no hard Matter for any one, that knows how to manage Matters, provided he is Master of the Language, to pro∣cure any thing the Island produces at an easy Rate.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="462"/>
The Natives here are almost as innocent and good-temper'd, for the Generality, as the Natives of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>There is, as the Report goes, a Silver Mine on this Island; but the Marquis won't open it, for fear the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> should seize upon it: And, 'tis said, that a certain Man extracted so much Gold there on a certain Mountain, where he had liv'd some time as a Hermit, that one Ass was not sufficient to carry it down to the Port where the Ship lay.</P>
<P>There is Abundance of Indigo grows here, and several great Plantations are inclos'd, wall'd in, and cultivated, on the Account, and for the Use of the Marquis; and there is a <HI>European Portu∣guese,</HI> who is the Manager, who separates the Tincture, which is sent Home, when the Ship comes from <HI>Portugal</HI> by Order of the Marquis, to collect for him the Profits of the Islands be∣longing to him. The Indigo Shrub grows some∣thing like Broom, but not so large, having small pale green Leaves, something resembling Box Leaves in Form, which are very juicy. These Leaves they strip off in <HI>October</HI> or <HI>November,</HI> of which they make their Indigo, by pounding the Leaves to a Pap, and making it then into Cakes or Balls, and, as it dries, it changes from Green to a dark Blue.</P>
<P>There are also Cotton Plantations cultivated, and Cloths made for the Marquis; for, as I told you before, this Island is the Hereditary Estate of that Nobleman. The Cotton Shrub grows about the Bigness of a Rose-Bush, but spreads more: The Leaves are of a Grass-Green, some∣thing like the Leaves of Spinage, but broader, and smooth: The Flowers are of a pale Yellow; which, after they blow away, are succeeded by round Tods, wherein the Cotton is inclos'd, com∣monly
<PB N="451" REF="463"/>
in three Cells, wherein the Seeds also are contain'd, which are Black, being of an oval Form, about the Bigness of <HI>French</HI> Beans.</P>
<P>They make this Island a Store-house, as it were, for Slaves; and, I suppose, when the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had the <HI>Spanish</HI> Slaving Trade, the then Marquis caus'd a Cargo of Negroes to be brought from <HI>Guinea,</HI> and placed there; who were supply'd, at his Charge, till they had put themselves into a Condition to maintain themselves by Planting, &amp;c. which they soon learned from the free Blacks inhabiting there before; and these have increas'd very fast, notwithstanding there have been many of them transported, both to <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Brasil</HI> whenever the Marquisses have thought fit to or∣der it: These Slaves have Plantations, Houses, Wives, &amp;c. as the free Blacks have; and some of the best Places are cultivated by them for Cot∣ton, Indigo, &amp;c. which are all wrought by those Slaves, and manag'd by a Steward placed there by the Marquis, who is generally a <HI>European Portuguese,</HI> and has the Title of <HI>Capiteen More.</HI></P>
<P>There is computed to be Two thousand Five hundred Souls on this Island, four Fifths of which Number is made up by the Slaves: They are divided into two Parties, and very often Diffe∣rences happen between them, sometimes to the shedding of Blood; the free Blacks valuing them∣selves for their Freedom, and the Slaves telling them, they are only Tenants at Will, and that they are worse than they, as being liable to be turn'd off the Island whenever the Marquis pleases, without knowing where to go, and will therefore be necessitated to yield themselves Slaves whenever the Marquis pleases, &amp;c. And whenever it comes to Blows, the Slaves being the stronger, the free Blacks generally come off with the worst; and it would be still worse for them,
<PB N="452" REF="464"/>
if the Governor, as the Steward is commonly call'd, did not interpose; and sometimes the ut∣most of his Authority can hardly restrain them. This occasions the free Blacks to complain very much of the Insolence of the Slaves, who, as they imagine, are more favour'd than themselves, which I believe is true.</P>
<P>There are but two Ports or Roads where Ships anchor; the best is on the South-West End of the Island call'd <HI>Terra-fall,</HI> and is a sandy Bay, and affords good Riding; but is such a vast long, as well as difficult Way from the Town, and un∣inhabited Parts of the Island, that a Ship might lie there a long Time undiscover'd by the Inha∣bitants; and by the Report of the Natives, it is four or five good Days Journey from <HI>Terra-fall</HI> to the Town. The other Road is a sandy Coast, rather than Bay, call'd <HI>Praya Simune,</HI> and affords no Shelter from the Wind, which generally blows strong through the Channel between St. <HI>Antonia</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> so that a Ship is often forc'd from her Anchor before she can finish her Trading: But St. <HI>Vincent</HI> stands their Friend, by stretch∣ing over to <HI>Porto Grandc,</HI> where they can ride safe.</P>
<P>When it's fine Weather, and light Winds, a Man may ride well enough at <HI>Praya Simune;</HI> and tis indifferent smooth landing. You may know this Bay by a little Village, to the Northward of which stands a little Chapel, which is the only Chapel and Village obvious to the Sight on that Side of the Island; and running a League, or farther, down along Shore, you will see the said sandy Road, where you may anchor on the North-East Side, in seven, eight, ten, or twelve Fathom; according as your Vessel is, or as you see the Wea∣ther likely to be.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="465"/>
There is, about half a League to the North∣ward of the Chapel, a little Bay or Cove, call'd <HI>Rivera des Trapha,</HI> where a Boat may lie; and has a very good Key to land or take in any thing at, the Water being smooth, and it affording a good Shelter from the Wind by the North-East Point: There is also a Run of fresh Water, and Wood enough, in the Valley.</P>
<P>You may see a Prospect of that, and the rest of the Roads, as well as the Shape of the several Islands, in the Draughts here annex'd; which although they are not altogether so exact and cu∣rious as I could have wish'd them, by Reason of the want of Conveniencies, and necessary Uten∣sils, yet, so far I can affirm, as to the most mate∣rial Parts, they may be intirely depended upon. And I can farther assure the Reader, that I have deliver'd no Falsity, either in the History of my∣self, or in my Description of those People or Islands. What I relate of my own Observation, is certain Matter of Fact, and what I had from others, I endeavour'd to procure it in the exactest and fullest Manner that I could. I could say a great deal more of the Cotton Manufacture; and am certain, that it's possible to procure Quantities of <HI>Barrafools,</HI> or <HI>Guinea</HI>-trading Cloths for a Trifle, as well as all Sorts of Provisions for Slav∣ing; which, as it would be more agreeable, as being a more natural Food for those <HI>Africans,</HI> so I am certain it would come much cheaper than as it is usually purchased; but how far, or whether it would be any ways hurtful to the Trade of those Kind of Provisions bought here for the Slaves, I must leave those who are concern'd in it to deter∣mine, as being the best Judges.</P>
<P>I could also much inlarge on the Nitre produc'd in some of these Islands; but I have said▪ suffi∣cient to let the World know, what for the most
<PB N="454" REF="466"/>
Part, was unknown to <HI>Europe</HI> before; I say, for the most Part, because some Years past, it was known in <HI>Portugal,</HI> that there was Nitre in the Island of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> and they gathered a consi∣derable Quantity of the Salt of it, which was sent to <HI>Portugal:</HI> But the Gathering of it, was prosecuted no farther since, the Report going, That it was not good Nitre, the greatest Part of it being of the Nature of the Marine Salt: Which might very well be; for where they got this Salt, I tried it, and there was such a small Quantity of inflammable Nitre mixed with it, that it would but very faintly kindle, and not one eighth Part burn, or fly away, the rest being a fixed Salt, and in Taste, nothing differing from the common Marine, or Sea Salt; whereas, in other Places on the same Island, there would not remain above one half, some one third, some one quarter, and some less, of fixed inflammable Salt: But at St. <HI>John</HI>'s Island, it was mostly so volatile, that it would all fly away, except near the Sea; the Reasons of which, I must leave to the philosophical Searchers of Nature to discover, and pursue the Chain of my Relations; the last Link whereof, is to say something of the <HI>Currents,</HI> and <HI>Seasons,</HI> and then I shall conclude.</P>
<P>The Sea about these Islands, keeps a regular Influx and Reflux; ebbing Six Hours odd Minutes, and flowing the same Quantity of Time; flowing higher, and ebbing lower, the same as in <HI>Europe,</HI> or other Parts, which we commonly call Spring-Tides; and this about, or rather some Time after the Conjunction and Opposition of the Sun and Moon, unless this Regularity be altered by the Strength of shifting Winds, &amp;c. which is com∣mon in other Parts also, though more easily and frequently observable here: But let the Weather be never so calm, yet the Sea runs more high
<PB N="455" REF="467"/>
against the Rocks, and even in the Bays, about the Full and Change of the Moon, than when these Two Planets are in or near a square Aspect. I have seen at the Square, and in a strong Gale of Wind, which caused a great Sea to run in the Channel between St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s and St. <HI>John</HI>'s, yet in the <HI>Fuurno</HI> the Sea has been very smooth, so that you might have laid a Boat to the Beach without hurting her; and I have observed, near the Full and Change, when, perhaps, it had been calm Three or Four Days before, and the Sea as smooth in the Channel aforesaid, as in the <HI>Thames</HI> almost; yet the Sea hove up against the Shore, that even in the <HI>Fuurno,</HI> you could not put a Boat ashore to the Beach, or Strand, with∣out running a Hazard of filling her with the Sea rowling and breaking on the Beach; though then you might land safe enough at the Kaay, yet there the Waves rise and fall, as if there was a great Sea run without.</P>
<P>The Flood sets to the North-Eastward, and the Ebb to the South-Westward, and will set more Northerly, Easterly, Westerly, or Southerly, about these Islands, as the Points or Sides of the Islands, check or turn the Stream, which I have shewn by the Darts about the Island of St. <HI>John,</HI> which I observed there, and, as far as I could find, was the same at the other Islands.</P>
<P>There runs a pretty strong Tide up and down the Channel between St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s and St. <HI>John</HI>'s; and likewise between the little Islands and St. <HI>John</HI>'s: There also runs a good Tide, both Ebb and Flood, between St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s and St. <HI>Jago</HI>'s; but not so strong as between St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s and St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>But the strongest Tides are in the Channels between those Islands lying between St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> especially the narrow Channel
<PB N="456" REF="468"/>
between St. <HI>Lucia</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> which, on Spring Tides, run very strong: I never had proper Con∣veniencies to try or know the Swiftness of these Tides, in a determinate Part of Time, since I found, that the Tides generally keep a regular Course, which hath been observed but by very few, even of those that use those Parts; but, ac∣cording to my Judgment, the Tide seems to run as swift in the last mentioned Channels, as it does in any Part of the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>There are, besides these afore-mentioned Causes of altering the general and ordinary Course of the Tides, another not yet mentioned; namely, The <HI>Currents</HI> which commonly set at particular Seasons, and although their exact Quantity or Quality, is not certainly found; yet the Quality is known thus far, That a little before the Rains, which fall in <HI>June, July, August,</HI> and part of <HI>September,</HI> the Current generally, though not constantly, sets to the North-Eastward, and then, at a determi∣nate Distance from the Islands, the Floods gene∣rally set stronger through those Channels, or about the Islands, than the Ebbs; and contrary∣wise, when the Currents set to the South-West∣ward, which is generally, though not constantly, in the latter Part of the Rains, and some Time after, <HI>viz. November, December,</HI> and <HI>January;</HI> then the Lee, or South-West Currents, are gene∣rally swifter than the Windward, or North-East Currents.</P>
<P>These Currents, however, depend on the Sea∣sons, because they generally come before, in, and after, though not exactly in, or at the same Time, yet always about that Time.</P>
<P>The like may be said of the <HI>Seasons;</HI> for it does not rain, nor does the Wind shift exactly at the same Time every Year; but about the same Time, sometimes sooner, sometimes later, the
<PB N="457" REF="469"/>
Natives who have the yearly Experience of it, expect the Rains about the latter End of <HI>June,</HI> with faint Southerly Winds, which sometimes they have not till the Beginning, Middle, or latter End of <HI>July,</HI> or it may be, not 'till the Middle of <HI>August:</HI> In <HI>September</HI> they have gene∣rally, though not constantly, East-South-East, South-East, and South-South-East, strong Winds, with the Rain: In <HI>October,</HI> South-South-West, South-West, and, towards the latter End, West-North-West, and North-West Winds; with Thunder, Lightening, and heavy Rain, and sometimes strong Winds, but they seldom hold long. Between these Rains, and a little before, you shall have Calms, serene Air, variable light Breezes, and Airs of Wind; and at that Season, a small Southerly Gale will raise a greater Sea, than a strong Northerly one; but you are to note, Those light Airs blowing between the rainy Fits, seldom raise the Sea: In the Month of <HI>No∣vember,</HI> if it rains, it is generally with a fresh, and sometimes strong, Northerly Wind, and generally, when the Rain is thick and heavy the Wind is laid soon; and after that, the Rain beats the Sea down smooth.</P>
<P>After the rainy Season is over, it's commonly very hazy, especially by Day, and oftentimes from the Beginning of <HI>November</HI> (if it cease to rain so soon) 'till the latter End of <HI>January,</HI> and all that Time, it generally blows pretty strong, and far Northerly, mostly North-North-East, and North-East-by-North; but <HI>February, March,</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> mostly North-East-by-North, from thence to the Rains more Easterly; and as it veers to the Eastward, the Wind decreases, and blows weaker.</P>
<P><PB N="458" REF="470"/>
When it blows the usual Wind to bring the Rain according to the Season, and blows strong and sudden, it is then usually soon over, and called a <HI>Travado;</HI> but when it blows violently, with Thunder and Lightening (and generally the harder it blows, and suddener it comes, the sooner it's over) it's then called a <HI>Turnado.</HI></P>
<P>And now I have finished my History of as much as I thought would be necessary or useful. It is my Maiden Work of a publick Nature; and as I find this proves acceptable or serviceable, it may encourage me to a Discovery of what hath oc∣curred to me, in my past, or future Observations, so far as I conceive they may be useful or delight∣ful to my Countrymen in general, especially to the Merchant Adventurers, and the Gentlemen belonging to the Sea, in particular: And if the Reader finds as much Satisfaction in the Reading, as I have taken Pains truly to observe and collect, I shall think my Trouble well bestowed.</P>
