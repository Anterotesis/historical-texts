<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Cannot give a great∣er
Proof of my Zeal
for Antiquity, than
by the Ambition I have of
putting its chief Heroes un∣der
Your Lordship's Protecti∣on.
I am sensible I can plead
<PB REF="4"/>
no Right to it, but what is
founded upon their Merit;
and have nothing to palliate
my Presumption to Your
Lordship, but a Pretence of
doing Justice to them. So that
I dare insist upon Your Lord∣ship's
Patronage no otherwise,
than as it will be a Reward
paid to the Memory of their
Virtues, which can never re∣ceive
its due Lustre, but from
Men of the same generous
Principles. It was a noble Vi∣gour,
with which they were
animated against the first Di∣sturbers
of Mankind; and it
is That makes them naturally
have Recourse to those, who
have so gloriously exerted
themselves in securing the Li∣berties
<PB REF="5"/>
of <HI>Europe.</HI> How great
a Part Your Lordship bears in
that Work, is allow'd by all
but Your Self, who are equal∣ly
industrious to merit Ap∣plause,
and to avoid it.</P>
<P>To interest Your Self in Af∣fairs
of the last Importance
with so much Zeal, and Assi∣duity,
and yet to effect them
with so much Calmness, and
Serenity, to do Good without
any Prospect, but that of the
Pleasure arising from the Consequence,
and to promote the
Service of Your Country, even
by seeming to decline it, as they
are Qualities the best of Patri∣ots
have ever affected, so are
they in none more conspicu∣ous
than in Your Lordship.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
<HI>My Lord,</HI> It is not easie to
resist the Temptation of in∣dulging
my self upon this
Subject; especially where I
am secur'd as well from the
Imputation, as the Guilt of
Flattery. For none can be so
hardy as to dispute Your Lord∣ship's
Merit, without deny∣ing
those very Blessings they
enjoy, as the Result of it.
But in regard to the Uneasi∣ness
I should give Your Lord∣ship,
and indeed to the In∣justice
I should do You by pur∣suing
so unequal a Task, I am
forc'd to leave it as a Happi∣ness
reserv'd for those, who
shall hereafter be engag'd in

the <HI>English</HI> History.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
I would urge one Title more
to Your Lordship's Accep∣tance
of these Papers, by con∣sidering
<HI>Greece</HI> as the Mother
of Arts and Literature; that
whilst the Reader beholds Sci∣ence
display'd in its Infancy,
Your Lordship's Name may at
the same time give him a more
expressive Idea of it in its full
Maturity. There are so many
Instances of Your Lordship's
Improvements in that kind,
that the only Dispute is, whe∣ther
you have contributed
more to it by Your Encou∣ragement,
or Example. Such
Extent, and Variety of Learn∣ing,
such Strength of Reason∣ing,
and Delicacy of Taste,
and such an Universal Polite∣ness,
<PB REF="8"/>
with which Your Lord∣ship
has always temper'd Your

have compleated Your

You no less the Orna∣ment,

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Affairs of</HI> Greece <HI>have lain
under such a general Suspicion, that
I think I ought not to publish any
Account of them, without premising some∣thing
concerning the Truth in History. It
is this</HI> Plato <HI>calls the</HI> Property <HI>of it, and</HI>
Cicero <HI>its</HI> chief Law, <HI>and</HI> distinguishing
Character: <HI>And it was in regard to this,
that I was deterr'd at my first Entrance up∣on
the</HI> Grecian <HI>Story, especially when I
found the Ancients themselves so confoun∣ded,
that few of them dated it from the
same Period. Some affirm there was no
History of</HI> Greece <HI>before</HI> Phoroneus <HI>the Son
of</HI> Inachus: <HI>And others fix the</HI> Attick Aera
<HI>at the</HI> Flood <HI>of</HI> Ogyges, <HI>which happen'd a∣bout
the same time.</HI> Plutarch <HI>makes an
Excuse for beginning so high as</HI> Theseus:
Dionysius Halicarnassaeus <HI>says there was no∣thing
certain before the</HI> Trojan <HI>War; and</HI>
Ephorus <HI>the</HI> Cnmaean, Callisthenes, <HI>and</HI>
Theopompus <HI>dated their Histories eighty
Years lower, from the</HI> Return <HI>of the</HI> Hera∣clidae.
<PB REF="10"/>
Varro <HI>calls the Beginning of the</HI>
Olympiads <HI>the</HI> Historical Times: Pliny
<HI>gives little Credit to all that is writ of</HI>
Greece <HI>before the Reign of</HI> Cyrus, <HI>which
began in the fifty fifth</HI> Olympiad; <HI>and
others place the most ancient Historians but
a little before the</HI> Descent <HI>of the</HI> Persian.</P>
<P><HI>It is not to be imagin'd, that the</HI> Grecians
<HI>had for so long a Tract of Time receiv'd no
Footsteps of the former Ages; the Dispute
is, at what time they came to be so plain,
that they might trace them with Ease, and
tread in them with Safety. If we enquire
a little into the Origine of History, we shall
find the innate Desire of Glory put Men up∣on
finding out ways to Transmit their Names
to Posterity even before the Invention of
Letters. They left their Images as an In∣heritance
to their Sons; their most remark∣able
Atchievements were sign'd by</HI> Hierogly∣phicks,
<HI>or painted and engrav'd on their
Walls; and their Songs, tho' very rude and
ill-modell'd, preserv'd the Memory of their
great Captains, and were fresh Incentives to
their Posterity. When Writing was in Use,
they erected Stones with Inscriptions on
them: And</HI> Eusebius <HI>says, that</HI> Hermes
Trismegistus <HI>wrote his Doctrine on Pillars,
least upon the Inundation of the</HI> Nile <HI>it
should be lost. It must be own'd it was very
late before Letters were receiv'd in</HI> Greece;
<PB REF="11"/>
<HI>and even after that, there was not the same
Care taken, as in other Nations, to apply
the Use of them to History. The</HI> Aegypti∣ans,
<HI>who pretended to the greatest Improve∣ments,
as well in this, as in other Parts of
Learning, committed the Care of their pub∣lick</HI>
Memoirs <HI>to their Colleges of Priests:
Yet as an Instance of the general Defect in
the History of the first Ages, they could not
even in</HI> Herodotus'<HI>s time give any certain
Account of the building their</HI> Pyramids, <HI>nor
of their great Monarch Sesostris. The</HI> Per∣sian
<HI>Historians were the</HI> Magi, <HI>the most con∣siderable
among them both for Knowledge
and Station: And in</HI> Rome <HI>the</HI> Pontiffs <HI>had
the Charge of making their</HI> Annals. <HI>So that
the</HI> Grecians <HI>were the only People of Note,
who were careless in this respect, and for
many Ages follow'd only their first Guide,</HI>
Tradition. <HI>It was this made them attri∣bute
such immoderate things to Antiquity,
that where any Man excell'd in Virtue or
Power, he was in Process of Time elevated
into a Deity; the Distance of Time magni∣fying
things almost in the same Proportion,
as the Distance of Place lessens them. And
whatever these Traditional Stories were,
they were still aggravated by the Poets, who
were undoubtedly their first Historians.
Hence it was, that their History became so
vitiated by so many Different and Mon∣strous
<PB REF="12"/>
Relations of their Gods and Heroes;
and this is the chief Foundation of all the
Fables of Antiquity. <HI>Lactantius</HI> observes
that the Poets writ the Truth, tho' they
disguis'd it; but the Veil was so thick that
it could never be perfectly thrown off: And
therefore the dark and confused Accounts
we have of the first Ages, seem like Inscrip∣tions
upon ancient Medals half defaced,
where the defective Part is to be supply'd
by Guess from the remaining Characters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But notwithstanding the Spirit of</HI> Ro∣mance,
<HI>which runs through the</HI> Grecian <HI>Sto∣ry,
one may venture to say of the first</HI> Gre∣cians,
<HI>what</HI> Monsieur de St. Evremond <HI>does
of the</HI> Romans, <HI>that</HI> They had so many real
Excellencies to be admir'd for, that there
was no need of having Recourse to Fables.
<HI>I make no question, but there were such Men
as</HI> Hercules, Theseus, <HI>and many others,
whose Stories are handed down to us; that
they did many of the Acts, which are ascri∣bed
to them: And one Reason why Men
doubt of their Atchievements, may be, be∣cause
they would not imitate them. For it
is a Natural Observation of</HI> Salust, <HI>that
we are too apt to take our Dimensions of o∣thers
from our own Standard, and conceive
every thing feign'd, which exceeds our own
Power. But what I say of these first He∣roes,
I would have understood only of the
<PB REF="13"/>
modest Part of their Characters; for some
things ascrib'd to them, are too gross to
bear any Colour of Probability. What I
have endeavour'd in this short Survey, has
been to purge them, as much as possible, from
the fabulous Aspersions of the Poets, who
by advancing them so far above the Stan∣dard
of Humanity, have brought their real
Merit in question, and eclips'd those Virtues
they intended to adorn. If they still seem
to act too much above the Condition of Men,
I may be allow'd to appeal in their behalf
to a later Race of Heroes: And indeed it is
not the least part of their Vindication, that
we see the Wonders of past Ages so gloriously
attested by those of the present. I dare
not from hence take Occasion to enter into a
thorough Defence of Antiquity: I know it
would require a much abler Advocate; and
I am sensible how far it has already suffer'd
in my following Account of it. I can only
pretend to have been cautious in affirming
any thing, where I doubted my Authority:
And tho' among the several Opinions of
Authors I have mark'd out what seem'd to
me the most probable, yet there is still Room
left for the Reader to pass his own Judg∣ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Here it may not be improper to say some∣thing
of the chief Authors, from whom this
History is collected, in order to show how
<PB REF="14"/>
far we may depend upon its Credibility. The
first from whom we receive any tolerable
Light into the</HI> Grecian <HI>Affairs, is</HI> Herodo∣tus,
<HI>who is stiled the</HI> Father of History, <HI>ei∣ther
because he was the first who reduc'd it
into any thing of Form, or at least the first
whose Writings in that kind have been pre∣serv'd.
His Stile is so easie, smooth, and
elegant, and his Matter so entertaining,
that for this Reason his Books bear the
Names of the</HI> Nine Muses. <HI>His chief Care
was to please rather than instruct; and
therefore instead of the Wars between the</HI>
Grecians <HI>and</HI> Barbarians, <HI>which he promises
to treat of, he entertains you with a Colle∣ction
of Antiquities, which he delivers upon
the Credit of the</HI> Aegyptian <HI>Priests, and
gives you a Narrative of all he knows. So
that half his Book is Digression and</HI> Paren∣thesis:
<HI>And in this Liberty he has been too
faithfully imitated by his Successors, many
of whose Works are such perfect Grotesques,
that in perusing them you often lose the
principal Design. The heaviest Charge a∣gainst
him is his Fabulousness, and Credu∣lity.
But they seem not to be acquainted
with his Design, who blame him for want
of Truth: He was so far from being a severe
Historian, that he endeavour'd only, as
the former Poets, to confine himself within
the Rules of Probability. Poetry was then
<PB REF="15"/>
at the Heighth, the</HI> Drama <HI>was carry'd
high by</HI> Aeschylus, Sophocles, <HI>and</HI> Euripi∣des,
<HI>the</HI> Dithyrambic <HI>by</HI> Pindar, <HI>and the</HI>
Heroick <HI>by</HI> Homer: Herodotus <HI>sought out a
new Glory, and diverted the Grecians with
Prose, or rather, as</HI> Quintilian <HI>says, with
more secret Numbers.</HI></P>
<P>Thucydides <HI>soon gave another Turn to
History, and at once reform'd, and perfect∣ed
it. He declares he was apprehensive his
History would not please the present Age
for want of Fables: But yet he chose rather
to satisfie the Judgment of Posterity, and
by that means gain'd to his Work the Title
he desir'd of an</HI> Everlasting Possession. <HI>His
Stile is grave, masculine, and noble, his
Expression close and sententious, his Rea∣soning
strong and profound, always just and
to the Purpose. He has many other Beau∣ties
which are fully and handsomly describ'd
by</HI> Monsieur Rapin, <HI>and others, who have
consider'd him as the compleatest Model of
the</HI> Grecian <HI>History. But I must not dis∣miss
his Character, without taking Notice
of that which occasion'd my mentioning him,
his Virtue and Sincerity. He adher'd so
constantly and obstinately to the Truth, that
if he had not told you he was an</HI> Athenian,
<HI>you could never discover it by his writing;
much less would you imagine, that he was
engag'd in many of the Expeditions he de∣scribes,
<PB REF="16"/>
since he industriously omits all th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fairest Opportunities of extolling himself
and his Country, for fear it should look like
Passion and Disguise. If any thing gives
a turn of Romance to his History, it is his
set Speeches, which perhaps may appear too
regular to be deliver'd in the Heat of Acti∣on,
or upon any sudden Emergencies. But
they are so admirably suited to the Occasion,
and have such an agreeable it Mixture of O∣ratory,
and good Sense, that we may easily
pardon that as a Blemish in him, which in
others would have been look'd upon as their
greatest Beauty. There shines throughout
the other Parts of his Work such an Air of
Justice, Candor, and Disinterestedness, that
perhaps no Heathen Writer ever equall'd him:
And the only thing to be wish'd for more
than what he has perform'd, is, that he
had taken in a larger Compass of Time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>His Loss was in a great measure repair'd
by</HI> Xenophon, <HI>who continu'd his history in
so pure and easie, so sweet and unaffected a
Stile, that from thence he obtain'd the Name
of the</HI> Attick Bee. <HI>The Admirers of the</HI>
Sublime <HI>charge him with being too much
upon the Level: But it was his great Ar∣tifice
to speak properly, and yet not</HI> vulgar∣ly;
<HI>wherein he resembles a clear and gentle
Stream, which can hardly be perceiv'd to
flow, and yet never stagnates. He was a
<PB REF="17"/>
perfect Master of Nature, and understood
the secret Graces of Simplicity; which as
it stole insensibly upon his Readers, so it
made his Narrative appear more sincere and
impartial. In short, he was the only</HI> Gre∣cian,
<HI>who knew how to support the Digni∣ty
of History with the Plainness of Expres∣sion.</HI></P>
<P>Diodorus Siculus <HI>is to be valu'd for his
laborious Collections; and tho' he takes in
too many of the Fables of his Predecessors,
and adheres too much to the Traditions of
the Aegyptian Priests, he serves very well
to supply, and compare with others.</HI> Mon∣sieur
de la Mothe le Vayer <HI>had such an O∣pinion
of him, that he declares,</HI> He would
freely travel to the End of the World, if he
were sure of finding that Part of him which
is lost, and envies Posterity the bare Proba∣bility
of recovering so great a Treasure.
Plutarch <HI>has also presented us with many
rich and uncommon Gleanings from the An∣cients;
he has drawn his Heroes in their
full Proportion, and in their Lives com∣pris'd
the History of the most remarkable Oc∣currences.
He is generally cautious and im∣partial;
but as he was a great Collector, he
is not always consistent and of a Piece, ei∣ther
as to Matter, or Stile. Besides one may
too easily discover the old Man in him; he
loves a Story, tho' never so foreign to his
<PB REF="18"/>
Subject; he tells it with too many Circum∣stances,
and with too great an Air of Su∣perstition.
I have always thought he would
make an excellent Abridgment: For where
he speaks to the purpose, few speak better;
and he has scarce been equall'd in the just∣ness
of his Characters, and the Wisdom of
his Reflections. It is not the least part of
his Merit, that he has preserv'd so many</HI>
Sayings <HI>of the greatest Men; and I have
been cautious of omitting any that were ma∣terial,
because, as he says himself,</HI> A Jest,
or an Apothegm often shews a Man more
than a Battel. <HI>The</HI> Lives <HI>of</HI> Nepos <HI>deserve
Mention in this Catalogue: But they seem
to be only Characters drawn from his gene∣ral
History, and are too short to give us a∣ny
thorough Image of Antiquity. And in
this respect</HI> Justin's <HI>Abridgement of</HI> Trogus
Pompeius <HI>serves chiefly to make us regret
the Loss of the Original.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To these Authors I have added the Assist∣ance
of our Countrymen, Sir</HI> Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Raleigh,
<HI>Dr.</HI> Howel, <HI>and the learned Sir</HI> John Mar∣sham,
<HI>who in his</HI> Canon Chronicus <HI>has ta∣ken
a great deal of Pains to reconcile the
different Aera's of the first Ages. And a∣mong
the Moderns, I am particularly oblig'd to</HI>
Monsieur Tourreil, <HI>who in his Preface
before some of Demosthenes's Orations, has
laid out an admirable Plan of</HI> Greece;
<PB REF="19"/>
<HI>wherein, as far as the Compass of his De∣sign
would permit, he has distinguish'd the
most remarkable Periods, discover'd the</HI> Ge∣nius,
<HI>and unravell'd the Interests of the se∣veral
States, and trac'd out the Steps, by
which they arriv'd to their Turns of Supe∣riority.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Having mention'd the chief Materials, of
which this History is compos'd, it may be
necessary to shew in what manner I have
digested them. As to the Method I have
made use of, I could not meet with any more
clear and easie, than that laid down in the</HI>
English Collection <HI>of the</HI> Roman History;
<HI>which I have therefore follow'd in my Di∣vision
of</HI> Books, Chapters, Sections, <HI>and
whatever else the Subject would admit of.
But as the Affairs of</HI> Greece <HI>and</HI> Rome
<HI>were very different, so they could not be re∣lated
altogether after the same manner.</HI>
Rome <HI>you see at one View, as well in its
Progress, as its Rise. For tho' in Process
of Time she branch'd out into so many Colo∣nies,
they were all Subject to her as their
Head; thence they receiv'd their Laws as
they were conquer'd; and they were always
one intire united People. Which makes
their Affairs admit of a more clear and even
Thread of History, than those of the</HI> Greci∣ans;
<HI>who, besides that they had to do with
most Parts of the then known World, were
<PB REF="20"/>
among themselves so many distinct Repub∣licks,
almost wholly independent one of ano∣ther,
differing in their Laws, and Customs,
jealous of each others Superiority, and con∣sequently
always jarring in their Interests, un∣less
when meer Necessity oblig'd them to unite
against a common Enemy. So that in this
respect, one may say of them, as</HI> Florus <HI>did
of the</HI> Romans, <HI>that</HI> Theirs is not the Hi∣story
of one People, but of Mankind. '<HI>Tis
true the several States of</HI> Greece <HI>agreed in
the main as to the one thing they contended
for, which was Liberty; but they had most of
them different ways to obtain, and preserve
it: And hence proceeds such a Variety, and
Intricacy in their Affairs, that it is no ea∣sie
I ask to marshal so many Events in due
Order of Time, and Place, and out of them
to collect an intire unbroken Body of History.
This is what I thought my self oblig'd to
say in my own Vindication; tho' it is with∣out
the least thoughts of derogating from the
Merit of the</HI> Roman History, <HI>which is suf∣ficiently
establish'd both as to the Usefulness
of the Design, and the Exactness of the
Performance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to what further relates to this Un∣dertaking,
the Reader will find</HI> Greece <HI>con∣sider'd
under two States: It is first divided
into</HI> Kingdoms, <HI>the principal of which are
treated of separately in the first Book, and
<PB REF="21"/>
carry'd down to the Abolition of the</HI> Regal
Power. <HI>The second Book considers it as
form'd into settled</HI> Common-wealths, <HI>and
relates its Affairs in a more united Manner.
To do this with the less Confusion, I have
observ'd a Rule of referring the chief Trans∣actions
to</HI> Athens <HI>as the Head, and menti∣oning
the other States only as they had De∣pendance
on it. For this reason I must own
a Liberty I have taken in the first Book of
placing the</HI> Kingdom <HI>of</HI> Athens <HI>last, that
there might be no thorough Interruption in
the Story. Yet tho' I have been particularly
cautious of perplexing the Reader by too ma∣ny
different Views, I have not neglected the
use of</HI> Chronology: <HI>In which I have chiefly
follow'd the Authority of Arch-Bishop</HI> Usher.
<HI>Astronomical Niceties cannot be expected,
where a general Knowledge of the Time
is sufficient; and if I have sometimes made
use of a round Number, either as to Years,
Men, Ships, or the like, I hope it may be
allow'd in Cases of the most remote Anti∣quity,
especially where the Difference in Hi∣storians
is so great, that it is impossible to
arrive at any Exactness. I have all along
intermix'd as much of the Antiquities, as
I thought necessary to illustrate the Story.
And as I found my self oblig'd to say
something of Arts and Learning, in wri∣ting
of a Country wherein they were sup∣pos'd
<PB REF="22"/>
to have received their Birth, I have
assign'd the general Periods of</HI> Poetry, <HI>and</HI>
Philosophy, <HI>and mention'd the greatest Pro∣sicients
in them, with a short Account of
their Persons and Writings. As this was
intended only for an</HI> Abridgment <HI>of the</HI>
Grecian <HI>Story, I have endeavour'd to reduce
the whole into as narrow a Compass as pos∣sible;
and notwithstanding the great Variety
of Matter, I hope I have omitted nothing
material.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Original of GREECE, and
its Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>I. AS there has been a constant Dispute
carry'd on by all Nations in their
Pretensions to Antiquity, the <HI>Ae∣gyptians,
Scythians,</HI> and others, who were resol∣ved
not to be outdone by their Neighbours,
fancied themselves the first Race of Mankind,
and that they were of equal Duration with the
World. Nor can we exempt the <HI>Grecians</HI> from
their Share in this common Vanity; the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="26"/>
particularly gave out, That they were
produc'd at the same Time with the <HI>Sun,</HI>
and out of the same <HI>Soil</HI> that they inhabited.
However Pride and Emulation might contri∣bute
to this Opinion, it might probably take
its Rise from the want of Letters, and Civil
Government in the first Ages of the World;
and as from thence the Original of most Na∣tions
became obscure, so consequently must the
most plausible Accounts we have of them, be
very precarious. <HI>Greece</HI> we find in a more
particular manner labouring under these Diffi∣culties:
For she underwent a long Infancy,
and tho' she often exerted her self, and signa∣liz'd
it by some generous Exploits; yet the
Fame of them being deliver'd down to Posteri∣ty,
either by uncertain Tradition, or rude im∣perfect
Memoirs, gave occasion to their Histo∣rians,
as well as Poets in succeeding Ages, to
make up in Fiction, what they wanted in au∣thentick
Records. This is a short Account of
that which we call the <HI>Fabulous Age;</HI> and tho'
we find it sufficiently clouded with Error and
Superstition, yet there are still some scatter'd
Intervals of Light, which must serve to direct
us in our Inquiry into the Birth of a People,
who have made so glorious a Figure in the
World, as the <HI>Grecians.</HI> Upon the whole, we
may with safety allot them a Place in Antiqui∣ty,
but must not give them the Precedency,
since it is allow'd by their own Historians, that
they were Instructed, and Civiliz'd by Colonies
planted among them from <HI>Phaenicia,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt;</HI>
the first of which taught them Navigation,
Trade, and the Use of Letters, and the latter
polish'd them by her Laws, gave them a taste
<PB N="3" REF="27"/>
of the Arts and Sciences, initiated them in her
Mysteries, and in a Word gave them Kings
and Gods.</P>
<P>II. But before we treat of their Affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The several Name of</HI> Greece.</NOTE> it
will be necessary to take a View of that Part of
the World, which went under the general
Name of <HI>Greece.</HI> As to the Name it self, the
<HI>Grecians</HI> were so call'd either from a petty Bo∣rough,
or <HI>Graecus</HI> a very obscure King, whose
Subjects were thought to be originally Inha∣bitants
of <HI>Thessaly;</HI> and therefore some of the
ancient Authors confine <HI>Greece</HI> properly so cal∣led,
to that Country. This was an ancient
known Name among them; and the <HI>Romans</HI>
paid that just Respect to their Antiquity, as to
call them by no other; but they soon quitted
it themselves for that of <HI>Hellenes</HI> or <HI>Achaei,</HI> tho'
one would wonder that a People so fond of
Antiquity, should so easily part with the most
eminent Mark of it. But it seems it was a
Compliment several of their Kings expected
from them, so that they chang'd their Names
almost as often as their Masters.</P>
<P>But since, through a mixture of Pride and
Ignorance, they seem to have corrupted the
Names of their <HI>Founders,</HI> and by that means
to have disguis'd their true <HI>Origine,</HI> we must
have Recourse to the more ancient and un∣doubted
Records of <HI>Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Greece</HI> was first inhabited by the Sons
of <HI>Noah,</HI> as other Countries were, is a thing out
of dispute, but by whose immediate Posterity,
is not so generally allow'd. The Posterity of
<HI>Japheth</HI> took Possession of the <HI>Isles of the Gen∣tiles,</HI>
which, according to the <HI>Hebrew Idiom,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="28"/>
comprehended not only such as were properly
so call'd, but all those Countries which lay
towards the Sea at any distance from <HI>Paelestine,</HI>
especially between the <HI>Ocean</HI> and <HI>Mediterrane∣an
Sea;</HI> and so both <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> might
come under this Denomination.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Javan <HI>thought to be the same with the</HI> Grecian Ion.</NOTE> His Son <HI>Ja∣van</HI>
seems most probable to have peopled <HI>Greece,</HI>
from the exact Analogy he bears with the <HI>Gre∣cian
Ion. Javan</HI> is the Scripture Word for
<HI>Greece;</HI> and it is observable, that tho' among
the <HI>Grecians</HI> themselves the <HI>Ionians</HI> were but a
Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> yet other Nations comprehend∣ded
all under the Name of <HI>Ionians.</HI> The Me∣mory
also of his Son <HI>Elisha</HI> seems to have been
preserv'd under the Name of the <HI>Aeoles,</HI> or
rather <HI>Elis</HI> of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> one part of which
by <HI>Homer</HI> is call'd <HI>Alisium;</HI> and some from
hence derive the <HI>Hellenes.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever Colour these Opinions carry with
them, they are not so unexceptionable, but
that we may give the <HI>Grecians</HI> leave to tell
their own Story. And of them the most Ju∣dicious
and Inquisitive allow their Country
was first inhabited by a barbarous People, dif∣ferent
from them both in Language and Man∣ners.
<HI>Strabo</HI> has given us a large Catalogue of
the <HI>Dryopes, Caucones, Leleges, Aones,</HI> and ma∣ny
others: But these seem not to have been
that ancient People, but some later Outcasts
of the <HI>Carians,</HI> who made frequent Inroads
into <HI>Greece.</HI> So that the most noted, and of
the greatest Extent and Antiquity, were the
<HI>Pelasgi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Account of the</HI> Pelasgi.</NOTE> whose first or chief Place of Residence
was <HI>Arcadia;</HI> from whence the <HI>Arcadians</HI> chal∣leng'd
to themselves their Founder <HI>Pelasgus,</HI>
and from him deriv'd their Claim to an high∣er
<PB N="5" REF="29"/>
Antiquity than their Neighbours. He pass'd
with them for an <HI>Autochthon,</HI> or <HI>Son of the
Earth,</HI> as the <HI>Grecians</HI> generally call'd those of
whom they could give no better Account. But
as by this they betray'd their Ignorance of his
Original, so they leave room for an Opinion
insisted on by very learned Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pelasgus <HI>the same with</HI> Pha∣leg.</NOTE> that by <HI>Pe∣lasgus</HI>
was meant <HI>Peleg,</HI> or <HI>Phaleg:</HI> Which looks
like more than a probable Conjecture, if we
allow what is generally asserted, that <HI>Greece,</HI> and
indeed most other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> were peopled
out of <HI>Scythia;</HI> from whence the Posteri∣ty
of <HI>Phaleg</HI> making their Way through <HI>Thrace,</HI>
and <HI>Thessaly,</HI> which were already taken up by
the Sons of <HI>Elisha</HI> and others, might fix some
in <HI>Epirus,</HI> some in <HI>Hellas,</HI> and the greatest part
in <HI>Pesoponnelus,</HI> where they found the most
empty and convenient Habitation. For it is
but reasonable to suppose that the Places to∣wards
the Sea were the last peopled, first from
the want of the Conveniency of Navigation;
and afterwards, when that was establish'd, for
fear of Pirates, who continually infested their
Coasts. This Descent of the Posterity of <HI>Pha∣leg</HI>
receives further Confirmation from the near
Affinity between the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language and the
ancient <HI>Greek,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Affinity be∣tween the</HI> Grecian <HI>and</HI> Eastern <HI>Languages.</HI></NOTE>
which is almost universally al∣low'd
to be of <HI>Eastern Extraction.</HI> Nor can
we more plausibly account for the many <HI>Dia∣lects,</HI>
into which the <HI>Greek</HI> was distinguish'd,
than by its Mixture with other Languages:
And in the <HI>Dorick Dialect</HI> we have a plain In∣stance
of the broad Pronunciation so peculiar
to the <HI>Oriental</HI> Tongues. There are also the
same Footsteps of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Languages to be
met with in the Out-skirts of <HI>Greece,</HI> particu∣larly
<PB N="6" REF="30"/>
in <HI>Crete</HI> and other Islands, whither this
People naturally betook themselves, as they
were expell'd <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> and the <HI>Continent.</HI>
Whoever these People were, we have no Ac∣count
of them but under the Name of the <HI>Pelasgi;</HI>
from whom <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> had the Name
of <HI>Pelasgia.</HI> After they had dispersed themselves
throughout all <HI>Greece,</HI> they arriv'd in <HI>I∣taly;</HI>
where they pass'd for the same with the
<HI>Tyrrheni,</HI> and as such were conceiv'd to be the
Original <HI>Founders</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> As they were a
scatter'd, wand'ring People, never throughly
settled, or incorporated with the other <HI>Greci∣ans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hellen.</NOTE>
they were sorc'd to give way to <HI>Hellen,</HI>
who was generally reputed the Son of <HI>Deucalion,</HI>
tho' some say of <HI>Prometheus</HI> and <HI>Clymene,</HI> and o∣thers
of <HI>Ion.</HI> He reign'd in <HI>Thessaly</HI> some time
after the <HI>Deucalionean Deluge,</HI> and being seated
almost in the Heart of <HI>Greece,</HI> and he with his
Sons bearing a great Sway in those Parts, main∣tain'd
a Correspondence with the neighbouring
Cities, 'till by degrees they expell'd the last
Remains of the <HI>Pelasgi:</HI> And from thence it
was that he impos'd one Name, calling the
Country after himself <HI>Hellas,</HI> which was after∣wards
call'd <HI>Phthiotis,</HI> and the People <HI>Hellenes.</HI>
This Name, tho' in Process of time it was
transferr'd to signifie the whole Nation with
its Colonies, at first reach'd no farther than his
own Dominions. For there were other Kings
as zealous as <HI>Hellen</HI> in propagating their Names,
in hopes it might prove a considerable Step
towards the <HI>universal Monarchy</HI> of <HI>Greece.</HI>
And this may account for the Variety of
Names we find, especially among the Poets,
who us'd them promiscuously to express the
<PB REF="31"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="7" REF="32"/>
Nation in general. The most noted among
them were <HI>Achoai, Argivi, Danai, Dolopes, Hel∣lenes,
Iones, Myrmidones,</HI> and <HI>Pelasgi,</HI> which
were particular Parts of Greece, so call'd from
their respective Kings, or Founders. But as the
<HI>Grecians</HI> did nothing very considerable, either
at home or abroad, before the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, it
was that first began to unite them under one
common Name, and Interest: Neither did they
presume 'till after that to call the rest of the
World <HI>Barbarians;</HI> that is, 'till they had one
establish'd Name, and Nation to oppose to
them.</P>
<P>III. The Country which they anciently and
properly inhabited was <HI>Hellas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Descripti∣on of the Country.</NOTE> or <HI>Greece</HI> pro∣perly
so call'd, being the <HI>Eastern</HI> Part of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
bounded chiefly by two Seas, the <HI>Ionian</HI>
on the <HI>West</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> and the <HI>Aegean</HI> on the
<HI>East,</HI> which parts them from <HI>Asia.</HI> On the
<HI>North</HI> was <HI>Macedonia, Illyricum,</HI> and <HI>Epirus;</HI>
both which latter had a mixt Dependance on
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and <HI>Barbarians.</HI> It was divided
by the <HI>Isthmus</HI> a narrow Neck of Land be∣tween
the two Seas; the largest Part being with∣out
the <HI>Isthmus</HI> to the <HI>North,</HI> and the lesser
within it to the <HI>South;</HI> which being surroun∣ded
every where by the Sea, except the <HI>Isth∣mus,</HI>
made it a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> and from <HI>Pelops,</HI> who
reign'd there, was call'd <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI> To these
Parts we may add the Multitude of Islands,
which lye dispersed in these Seas: Of which
the most remarkable is <HI>Crete,</HI> both for Fame and
Extent. The next are <HI>Euboea, Corcyra, Ce∣phallenia,</HI>
and <HI>Zacynthus,</HI> with many others of
less Note. These Parts were also subdivided
<PB N="8" REF="33"/>
into less Countries, in the nature of Provinces:
The most noted of which in the flourishing
Times of <HI>Greece</HI> were <HI>Thessaly, Locri Epicnemi∣dii,
Opuntii,</HI> and <HI>Ozolae,</HI> the latter of which
lying more Westward, is also distinguish'd by
the Name of <HI>Locri Hesperii, Baeotia, Attica,
Megaris, Phocis, Aeolia, Acarnania,</HI> and <HI>Do∣ris;</HI>
all without the <HI>Isthmus.</HI> Within the Isth∣mus
were <HI>Achaia, Elis, Messenia, Laconia,
Argolis,</HI> and <HI>Arcadia,</HI> all comprehended under
the general Name of <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI></P>
<P>These were the native fix'd Seats of the <HI>Gre∣cians,</HI>
'till increasing in Power, and press'd with
Numbers, they threw themselves out in Co∣lonies,
and so inlarg'd their Territories. By
these means they got Possession as well of the
remoter Parts, as those which border'd upon
them, especially the Sea-Coasts of <HI>Macedonia,
Thrace, Illyricum</HI> and <HI>Epirus;</HI> as also of <HI>Sicily,</HI>
the largest Island in <HI>Europe</HI> next our own,
with the <HI>Southern</HI> Part of <HI>Italy;</HI> both which
from the many Colonies planted there went
under the Name of <HI>Magna Graecia.</HI> As for
<HI>Macedonia</HI> in general, we are not yet to consider
it as a Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> 'till by a large Accessi∣on
of Territory it grew formidable to the most
remote and powerful States of <HI>Greece;</HI> and from
thence laid the Foundation of that Sovereignty
it soon after assum'd under the Title of the
<HI>Third Monarchy.</HI> They had also in the <HI>Lesser
Asia, Pontus, Bithynia, Phrygia, Lydia, Caria,
Lycia, Pamphylia,</HI> and the Island <HI>Cyprus.</HI> To
these we may add several famous Islands be∣longing
to <HI>Asia, as Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Cos,
Carpathus</HI> and <HI>Rhodes,</HI> with <HI>Lemnos</HI> near <HI>Thrace</HI>
in the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea. But these and other less
<PB N="9" REF="34"/>
Colonies we shall have occasion to mention
more particularly, as they fall in with the
Body of the Story. It may suffice in general,
that they got footing in most parts of the old
known World; and where-ever they planted
their Colonies, they generally propagated by
them their Race, Religion, Laws, Customs,
and Language.</P>
<P>IV. We have no particular Account of the
State of <HI>Greece</HI> before the Foundation of her
<HI>Royalties;</HI> nor indeed can we expect any thing
worth our Notice from a People who were at
that time rude and unpolish'd even to Barbari∣ty.
For it is certain they were unacquainted
with Agriculture, Building, and all the earli∣est
and most natural Inventions of providing
for the common Necessaries of Life, having no
Law but Force, and grazing like Beasts in the
open Air. So that to give them the least
Tincture of Humanity, was sufficient to gain
from them the Title of King, or God; wit∣ness
the Divine Honours they paid to their
<HI>Pelasgus,</HI> who built them a sort of Cottages to
fence them from the Inclemency of the Air,
clothed them with the Skins of Beasts, and
taught them to feed on Acorns, as a more whole∣some
Nourishment than that of Herbs. This
new Diet, whatever other good Effects it
might have, wrought no great Change in their
Manners; so that <HI>Greece</HI> was not for several Ages
after inhabited in any constant settled way. They
were still the same lawless Rout, continually
roving and removing from one Place to ano∣ther;
and such as were not content with their
own Fortune, were easily tempted to invade
<PB N="10" REF="35"/>
their Neighbours. In this general Contest the
richest Countries fell to the strongest: But as
the Conquest was easie, so the Possession was
short, they being soon succeeded by others up∣on
the same Title. For this Reason <HI>Thessaly,</HI>
and <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and indeed all the fertile Re∣gions
of <HI>Greece,</HI> chang'd their Masters every
Year, with a great Part of their Inhabitants.
The Country which was least molested upon
these Accounts, was <HI>Attica;</HI> and it is imputed
chiefly to the Barrenness of its Soil. For there
being nothing worth contending for, the In∣habitants
were continued quietly in a long and
regular Descent: and this gave the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enians</HI>
the best Title to Antiquity, or at least the best
Proofs of it. But the greatest Advantage was,
that it made them exert themselves sooner than
their Neighbours; it quicken'd their Inventi∣ons,
dispos'd them to a more easie Reception
of Arts and Literature, when they got footing
among them, and in a manner laid the Foun∣dation
of all that Grandeur, to which they af∣terwards
arriv'd.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Greece</HI> in general, the other
Parts of it were over-run with Spoil and Ra∣pine.
The continual Fear of being displac'd
made them live as it were by Chance, with∣out
any further Prospect than their present Su∣stenance;
and so cramp'd their Industry in ge∣neral,
that we find nothing of the Arts and
Sciences at that time among them, no Trade
or Commerce, or any other happy Effects of
Peace and Security. They at last grew sensi∣ble
of the Necessity there was of Civil Socie∣ty,
as a Means to secure them from Violence
and Oppression. This put them upon impro∣ving
<PB N="11" REF="36"/>
their Notions of Building; so that their
Houses increasing in Number as well as Beau∣ty,
grew insensibly into <HI>Boroughs,</HI> and they
some time after into Cities. But neither could
this Advantage of Cohabitation throughly tame
and soften their Tempers; that being a peculi∣ar
Honour reserv'd (as was hinted before) for
<HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Phaenicia.</HI></P>

and some say in the World, not allowing even
the <HI>Assyrian</HI> or <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Kingdoms to have
preceded it, we must therefore content our selves
with a very slender Account of it; especially
since we have almost as much reason to dispute,
as to assert its real Existence. Here, they say,
<PB N="14" REF="38"/>
<HI>Aegialeus</HI> first reign'd about the 1915th Year
of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M</NOTE> and from himself nam'd not on∣ly

which Uncertainties every thing that is Re∣corded

that the most accurate Inquirers into
the first Ages, strike off the whole Succession of
these Kings for the Space of near a thousand Years,
leaving them no place in Antiquity. But mak∣ing
some Allowances for such a vast Distance of
Time, and the want of Records; and supposing
<HI>Sicyon</HI> to be peopl'd so early, as from the Fruit∣fulness
and Conveniency of its Situation we may
reasonably conclude it was, and we may yet
believe She had her Kings, that being the Go∣vernment
which obtain'd in most Countries, as
they came to be inhabited, after the Flood.</P>
<P>II. We can only observe of the first Kings
of <HI>Greece</HI> in general, that they are represented
as Persons of great Worth and Renown, who
for their Courage, Prudence and other Virtues,
<PB N="15" REF="39"/>
were chosen by the free and universal Consent
of the People. There seems by their long and
quiet Reigns to have been a persect good Un∣derstanding
between Prince and People; who
as they yielded an intire and voluntary Obe∣dience,
so the Kings chose to Command rather
by Love, and Esteem of their Merit, than by the
Force of their Arms, and a slavish Dread of
their Power. In all their Actions they pre∣ferr'd
the Good of their Subjects, for whose
Protection they knew and acknowledg'd them∣selves
to have been advanc'd, before any cove∣tous
or ambitious Designs of their own; and
the People plac'd such a Confidence in the E∣quity
of their Prince, that <HI>Greece</HI> had not for
several Ages, after it was a little Civiliz'd, any
standing Laws, but the indefinite Will and Sen∣tence
of its Kings. But this Harmony being
destroy'd in succeeding Ages by Policy, Inte∣rest
and Thirst of Empire, the People, as Op∣portunity
offer'd, resum'd the Power into their
own Hands; and this gave Rise to more different
Forms of Government in <HI>Greece,</HI> than in any other
Parts, or perhaps in the whole World besides.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Sicyon,</HI> it is certain that King∣dom
never made any mighty Figure in this long
tract of Time, and that may be the chief Rea∣son
of its Obscurity. Thus it lyes involv'd in
the Fate of several other petty Royalties, which

who therefore is thought by those who had no

better account of things, to be the first Man,
and is called the <HI>Father of Mankind.</HI> At least he
is the first who did any thing memorable in
<HI>Greece:</HI> For he is said to have built the first
Altar to <HI>Juno;</HI> and having begun with Religi∣on,
his next Care was to unite his Subjects in∣to
a sort of Community, by building the City
from him call'd <HI>Phoronicum,</HI> to prescribe them
Laws, and bring them from meer Savages to
somewhat of a more civiliz'd way of Living.

this of <HI>Argos,</HI> whom the <HI>Mythologists</HI> confound,
by attributing to all what was done by one,
which is usual among the <HI>Grecians</HI> in the Case
of their Gods and Heroes. This might give
grounds to the Story of his going into <HI>Aegypt,</HI>
where he built the City <HI>Memphis,</HI> taught the
People Tillage, and was after his Death wor∣ship'd
as a God in the Shape of an Ox, under
the Name of <HI>Serapis</HI> or <HI>Osiris.</HI> But allowing
there was such a King of <HI>Argos,</HI> which is not
generally assented to, the most probable Ac∣count
is, That he liv'd and dy'd in <HI>Greece,</HI>
commanded the <HI>Peninsula</HI> to be called after his
Name, and in the thirty fifth Year of his Reign
was kill'd for his Tyranny. <HI>Apis</HI> dying with∣out
Issue was succeeded by <HI>Argus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Argus.</NOTE> his Sister
<PB N="18" REF="42"/>
<HI>Niobe's</HI> Son, who is consounded with his Great
Grand-son of that Name, whom the Poets make
all Eyes. His Reign is more remarkable for
the Length of it, being seventy Years, than any
thing else, except that <HI>Greece</HI> in his time had
vast Plenty of Corn, for which he was honou∣red
after his Death with a Temple and Sacri∣fice;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Art of Tillage a∣scribed to</HI> Homogy∣rus.</NOTE>
tho' the Art of Tillage is more properly

Oxen in the Plough. He also called the City

<HI>Argi,</HI> and <HI>Argioi.</HI> Some fancy his Bro∣ther
was the <HI>Pelasgus</HI> already mention'd as
Founder of the <HI>Pelasgi,</HI> who chiefly inhabited
<HI>Arcadia,</HI> and being drspers'd into several Parts

<HI>Peranthus</HI> the building of the first Temple to
<HI>Juno</HI> at <HI>Argos.</HI> It is certain there was such a
Temple about this time consecrated to <HI>Juno,</HI>
and <HI>Callythia</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Peranthus</HI> made
Priestess of it; which might occasion the mi∣stake
of his being King. This Superstition was
continu'd for many Ages; and as all their Af∣fairs,

a Year of the <HI>Priesthood,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Argive, Aera.</NOTE> it became the stand∣ing

for his Skill in Astronomy, and Invention of
the Globe, was said to bear up the Heavens;
and upon the same accounts his Daughters pass'd
for Stars, under the Names of the <HI>Pleiades</HI> and
<HI>Hyades.</HI> Nor is less Honour due to his Bro∣ther
<HI>Prometheus,</HI> who was thought to have
form'd Men of Clay, and animated them with
Fire, which he stole from Heaven, because he
was a wise Man, who endeavour'd to reclaim
Men from their brutal Ignorance, and teach'em
the use of Reason. And this seems to consirm
another part of his Story; where, by the Eagle
continually preying upon his Entrails, may be
imply'd his deep and painful Enquiries after
Knowledge. He is from several concurring
Circumstances thought to have been the same
with <HI>Magog.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Phorbas,</HI> after thirty five Years, left the King∣dom
to his Son <HI>Triopas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Triopas.</NOTE> who enjoy'd it, forty
six Years, and was succeeded by his Son <HI>Jasus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jasus.</NOTE>
as <HI>Pausanias</HI> will have it, who probably might
reign, because the City was from him call'd,
<HI>Jasos,</HI> and the Citizens <HI>Jasii.</HI> His Daughter
was the famous <HI>Io,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Story of</HI> Io.</NOTE> whose Story is so bandy'd
about by the Poets; tho' she is not to be con∣founded
with another of that Name, the repu∣ted
Daughter of <HI>Inachus. Herodotus</HI> tells her
Story most plausibly, that the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> who
first applied themselves to Shipping, as they
traded with Goods from <HI>Assyria</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI>
came to <HI>Argos</HI> at that time the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of
<HI>Greece;</HI> where the Women flock'd down to
their Ships to buy of them. The <HI>Phoenicians</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="44"/>
seiz'd as many as they could of them, and a∣mong
the rest this <HI>Io</HI> the King's Daughter,
and fail'd away with them into <HI>Aegypt;</HI> which
was resented so heinously, that it was thought
the Foundation of all the Quarrels and Enmity,
which afterwards broke out between the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI>
and <HI>Asiaticks.</HI> To return to <HI>Jasus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crotopus.</NOTE> it is
more generally agreed that <HI>Crotopus,</HI> his Brother

who after twenty one Years left the King∣dom
to his Son <HI>Sthenelas;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sthenelas.</NOTE> and he, after eleven
more, to his Son <HI>Gelanor.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gelanor.</NOTE></P>
<P>II. In his time there happen'd a Contest be∣tween
the two Sons of <HI>Belus,</HI> <HI>Aegyptus</HI> and
<HI>Danaus;</HI> the former of which was King of
King of <HI>Aegypt;</HI> and gave his Name to the Country.
He would have match'd his fifty Sons to the
same number of Daughters of his Brother <HI>Da∣naus;</HI>
which being contrary to the Advice of
the Oracle, he refused, and set fail with them
first to <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and thence to <HI>Argos.</HI> The
Ship was call'd <HI>Pentecontoris,</HI> and is noted as the
first of any Bulk that came into <HI>Greece.</HI> At
<HI>Argos</HI> he contended with <HI>Gelanor</HI> for the King∣dom,
as descended from <HI>Epaphus</HI> Son of the
first <HI>Io.</HI> As he was making out his Preten∣sions
to the People, a Wolf happen'd to kill an
Ox grazing by the Walls. This Accident was
interpreted by the People in favour of <HI>Danaus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Danaus.</NOTE>
whom as a Stranger they took to signifie the
Wolf, and thereupon adjudg'd the Kingdom
to the <HI>Aegyptian.</HI> But <HI>Aegyptus,</HI> still jealous of
the Increase of his Brother's Power by con∣tracting
new Alliances upon his Daughters Mar∣riages,
sent his fifty Sons down to <HI>Argos</HI> with
<PB N="21" REF="45"/>
an Army to force him to comply with his for∣mer
Demand. The young Men gain'd their Un∣cle's
Consent: But he had secretly provided his
Daughters with Daggers, and Instructions to
murder their Husbands the first Night.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Attempt of the</HI> Da∣naides.</NOTE> This
Attempt of the <HI>Danaides</HI> was look'd upon as
one of the most barbarous Exploits of Antiqui∣ty:
For the only one who escap'd out of this
general Massacre, was <HI>Lynceus</HI> the Husband
of <HI>Hypermnestra,</HI> who was therefore accus'd by
her Father, and brought to Judgment, but ac∣quitted.
<HI>Danaus</HI> in his Reign built the Tower
which went by the Name of <HI>Larissa;</HI> and his
Daughters are said to have supplied, the City
with Water by the Invention of Wells, which
they probably brought out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where
Water was scarce; and this is the most natu∣ral
Foundation of the Fable, that for their Cru∣elty
to their Husbands they were condemn'd
to draw Water in leaky Vessels.</P>
<P><HI>Danaus,</HI> after fifty Years, was succeeded by
<HI>Lynceus,</HI> his Son-in-law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lynceus.</NOTE> And he, after forty
one more, by his Son <HI>Abas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abas.</NOTE> who reign'd twenty three.
<HI>Abas</HI> had two Sons, <HI>Acrisius</HI> and <HI>Praetus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus <HI>and</HI> Acrisius.</NOTE>
who being Twins contended for the Kingdom;
which <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus</HI> first enjoy'd for seventeen Years,
and then was expell'd by <HI>Acrisius</HI> into <HI>Lycia;</HI>
from whence he return'd with some considera∣ble
Force, seiz'd upon <HI>Tyrinthe,</HI> and gave his
Brother Battel, wherein they are the first re∣corded
to have us'd Targets.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Targets first us'd.</HI></NOTE> But it not be∣ing
a decisive Battel, they came to an Accom∣modation,
and divided the Kingdom, so far at least,
that <HI>Acrisius</HI> kept Possession of <HI>Argos,</HI>
and let his Brother enjoy <HI>Tyrinthe,</HI> and some
other Maritime Places. <HI>Acrisius</HI> had one only
<PB N="22" REF="46"/>
Daughter nam'd <HI>Danae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Danae.</NOTE> who the Oracle told
him should have a Son that would procure his
Death.</P>
<P>But before we proceed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Account of Oracles.</HI></NOTE> it may not be amiss
to give some Account of these <HI>Oracles,</HI> which
made up so considerable a part of the <HI>Grecian
Superstition.</HI> They were rank'd among the no∣blest
and most religious kinds of Divination,
the Design of them being to settle such an im∣mediate
way of Converse with their Gods, as
to be able by them not only to explain things
intricate and obscure, but also to anticipate the
Knowledge of future Events, and that with far
greater Certainty than they could hope for
from Men, who out of Ignorance and Preju∣dice
must sometimes either conceal, or betray
the Truth. So that this became the only safe
way of deliberating upon Affairs of any Con∣sequence,
either publick or private. Whether
to proclaim War, or conclude a Peace, to in∣stitute
a new Form of Government, or enact
new Laws, all was to be done with the Ad∣vice
and Approbation of the Oracle, whose De∣terminations
were always held sacred and invio∣lable.
As to the Causes of Oracles, <HI>Jupiter</HI>
was look'd upon as the first Cause of this and
all other sorts of Divination; he had the Book
of Fate before him, and out of that reveal'd
either more or less, as he pleas'd, to <HI>inferior
Demons.</HI> But to argue more rationally, this
way of Access to the Gods has been branded as
one of the earliest and grossest pieces of <HI>Priest∣craft,</HI>
that obtain'd in the World. For the
Priests, whose Dependance was on the Oracles,
when they found the Cheat had got sufficient
footing, allow'd no Man to consult the Gods
<PB REF="47"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="23" REF="48"/>
without costly Sacrifices and rich Presents to
themselves: And as few could bear this Ex∣pence,
it serv'd to raise their Credit among the
common People, by keeping them at an awful
distance. And to heighten rheir Esteem with
the better and wealthier Sort, even they were
only admitted upon a few stated Days. By
which the thing appear'd still more mysterious,
and for want of this good Management must
quickly have been seen through, and fell to
the ground. But whatever juggling there was
as to the Religious Part, Oracles had certainly
a good Effect as to the Publick, being admirably
suited to the Genius of a People, who would
join in the most desperate Expedition, and ad∣mit
of any Change of Government, when they
understood by the Oracle it was the irresisti∣ble
Will of the Gods. This was the Method
<HI>Minos, Lycurgus,</HI> and all the famous Law-gi∣vers
took; and indeed they found the People
so intirely devoted to this part of Religion,
that it was generally the easiest, and sometimes
the only way of winning them into a Compli∣ance.
And then they took care to have them
deliver'd in such ambiguous Terms, as to ad∣mit
of different Constructions according to the
Exigency of the times; so that they were ge∣nerally
interpreted to the Advantage of the
State, unless sometimes there happen'd to be
Bribery, or Flattery in the Case; as when <HI>De∣mosthenes</HI>
complain'd that the <HI>Pythia</HI> spoke as
<HI>Philip</HI> wou'd have her. The most numerous,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
and of greatest Repute, were the Oracles of <HI>A∣pollo,</HI>
who in Subordination to <HI>Jupiter</HI> was ap∣pointed
to preside over, and inspire all sorts of
<HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Diviners.</HI> And amongst these the
<PB N="24" REF="49"/>
<HI>Delphian</HI> challeng'd the first place, not so much
in respect of its Antiquity, as its Perspicuity
and Certainty; insomuch that the Answers of
the <HI>Tripos</HI> came to be us'd proverbially for <HI>clear
and infallible Truths,</HI> Here we must not omit
the first <HI>Pythia</HI> or Priestess of this famous O∣racle,
<HI>Phemonoe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phemonoe <HI>The first</HI> Pythia.</NOTE> who is plac'd under the Reign
of <HI>Acrisius,</HI> and by most recorded as the first
who clothed the Answers of the Oracle in <HI>He∣roick,</HI>
Verse. They found a secret Charm in
Numbers, which made every thing look pom∣pous
and weighty: And hence it became the
general Practice of Legislators, and Philosophers,
to deliver their Laws and Maxims in that
Dress; and scarce any thing in those Ages
was writ of Excellence or Moment, but in Verse.
This was the Dawn of <HI>Poetry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Dawn of Poetry.</HI></NOTE> which soon
grew into Repute; and so long as it serv'd to
such noble Purposes as <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI>
Poets were highly honour'd, and admitted into a
Share of the Administration. But by that time
it arriv'd to any Perfection, they pursu'd
more mean and servile Ends; and as they pro∣stituted
their Muse, and debased the Subject,
they sunk proportionably in their Esteem and
Dignity. As to the History of Oracles, we
find them mention'd in the very <HI>Infancy</HI> of
<HI>Greece;</HI> and it is as uncertain when they were
finally extinct, as when they begun. For they
often lost their Prophetick Faculty for some
time, and recover'd it again. I know 'tis a
common Opinion, that they were universally
silenc'd upon our <HI>Saviour's</HI> Appearance in the
World: And if the <HI>Devil</HI> had been permitted
for so many Ages to delude Mankind, it might
probably have been so. But we are assur'd
<PB N="25" REF="50"/>
from History, that several of them continu'd
'till the Reign of <HI>Julian th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Apostate,</HI> and were
consulted by him: And therefore I look upon
the whole Business as of Human Contrivance,
an egregious Imposture founded upon <HI>Super∣stition,</HI>
and carried on by <HI>Policy</HI> and <HI>Interest,</HI>
'till the <HI>Brighter Oracles</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI>
dispell'd these Mists of <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI></P>
<P>To return to <HI>Acrisius;</HI> upon this Advice of
the Oracle, he kept his Daughter <HI>Danae</HI> un∣der
very close Confinement: But <HI>Jupiter</HI> came
to her in a Shower of Gold, or rather her
Uncle <HI>Pratus</HI> brib'd her Keepers, and left her
with Child of <HI>Perseus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perseus.</NOTE> It is observ'd of most
of the famous Men of Antiquity, that they
were begotten by Adultery and Incest. If their
Mothers were of a noble Descent, the Theft
was father'd upon some of the Gods; and the
People in regard of their Virtue, and good
Offices to the publick, were easily satisfied in
the Belief of it. Thus <HI>Perseus</HI> was of the
number of those who cast the Reproach of their
Birth upon <HI>Jupiter.</HI> The Boy with his Mo∣ther
was said to be thrown into the Sea, but
was miraculously convey'd to the Island <HI>Seri∣phus,</HI>
and like the Heroes of those times signa∣liz'd
his Youth by destroying of Monsters,
particularly the <HI>Gorgon Medusa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Gor∣gon Medu∣sa,</NOTE> whose Head
he wore as a Trophy in the middle of his
Shield. It is thought this <HI>Medusa</HI> was a beau∣tiful
Queen in <HI>Africa,</HI> and that <HI>Per∣seus</HI> went
with an Army out of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and conque∣red
her. So that this Expedition may be more
properly plac'd after his Return home upon his
Grand-father's Death. He married <HI>Androme∣da</HI>
after he had deliver'd her from a Sea-mon∣ster,
<PB N="26" REF="51"/>
or rather rescu'd her from one Phoenix,
who was sailing away with her in a Ship call'd
<HI>The Whale,</HI> and after that return'd to <HI>Argos</HI> to
see his Grand-father. But <HI>Acrisius,</HI> in hopes to
defeat the Oracle, retie'd into <HI>Thessaly;</HI> where
<HI>Perfeus</HI> happening to meet him at some publick
Games there, kill'd him by an accidental Blow
with a Quoit, after a Reign of thirty one Years.
About this time came into <HI>Greece Pelops,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pelops.</NOTE> the
Son of <HI>Tantalus</HI> King of <HI>Sipylus</HI> in <HI>Phrygia.</HI> He

maintain'd their Ground; and the Family of
the <HI>Pelopidde</HI> became as remarkable both for their

took such an Aversion to <HI>Argos,</HI> that he tran∣slated
the Regal Seat to <HI>Mycenoe,</HI> where he
founded both a City and Kingdom. So that
the Fall of <HI>Argos</HI> is generally dated from the
Death of <HI>Acrisrus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> after it had continu'd, from
its suppos'd Founder <HI>Inachus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2692.</NOTE> about 544 Years.
Some indeed look upon this State of <HI>Mycenoe</HI> on∣ly
as a Continuation of the Kingdom of <HI>Argos,</HI>
and therefore assign but one Succession of
Kings to both Places. But others affirm, with
more colour of Reason, that <HI>Perseus</HI> made an
actual Exchange with his Cousin <HI>Megapenthes,</HI>
who was then reigning at <HI>Tyrinthe</HI> in Right of
his Father <HI>Pratus;</HI> that <HI>Megapenthes</HI> was suc∣ceeded
<PB N="27" REF="52"/>
at <HI>Argos</HI> by his Son <HI>Anaxagoras,</HI> who
contenting himself with a Third of the King∣dom,
divided the rest between two Brothers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argos <HI>di∣vided.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>Melampus</HI> and <HI>Bias;</HI> the former of which had
cured the <HI>Proetides</HI> his Aunts of their Madness,
by the use of <HI>Hellebore.</HI> However this dismem∣bring
of <HI>Argos</HI> so lessen'd the Figure her Princes
were wont to make, and withal wrought such
a Confusion in their Affairs, that it is hardly
possible to rank them in any Order of Time,
and Place. We can only conclude in general,
that <HI>Perseus</HI> alter'd the Succession, without put∣ting
a final Period to the Kingdom: For we find
several Kings mention'd even after <HI>Anaxagoras;</HI>
as <HI>Alector, Iphis, Eteocles,</HI> who was kill'd in the
<HI>Theban</HI> War, <HI>Talaos</HI> the Son of <HI>Bias, Adrastus,</HI>

<P>III. Amidst these Uncertainties let us return
to <HI>Mycenoe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Foundation of</HI> Mycenae <HI>by</HI> Perseus</NOTE> where we left Perseus settling his

it does not appear, that the <HI>Grecians</HI> had yet

by <HI>Mastor,</HI> and he by his Brother <HI>Ele∣ctryon</HI>
Father of <HI>Alcmena.</HI> But this Opinion
not being generally receiv'd, we must look up∣on
<PB N="28" REF="53"/>
on <HI>Sthenelus</HI> as his immediate Successor;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sthenelus</NOTE> and to
salve these Difficulties, have Recourse to the
common Method of <HI>Chronologers,</HI> who assign to
some of the succeeding Kings an Over-plus of
Years to account for the two former, whose
Reigns are uncertain. <HI>Sthenelus</HI> reign'd eight
Years, and by <HI>Astydamia</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Pe∣lops</HI>
left <HI>Eurystheus</HI> his Successor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Erysthe∣us.</NOTE> who is noted
for the difficult Tasks he impos'd on <HI>Alcoeus,</HI>
better known by his Sirname <HI>Hercules,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Account of</HI> Hercules.</NOTE> given
him upon the Fame of his Exploits; of whom
we must give some Account, since his Actions
are the most talk'd of, tho' with the least Cer∣tainty,
of all the Heroes of Antiquity. For
some reckon up three, others four,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many of that Name.</NOTE> <HI>Cicero</HI> six,
and <HI>Varro</HI> forty four of this Name. Almost
every Age and Country had its <HI>Hercules,</HI> it
being a common Custom to call the most an∣cient
Kings by the Name of <HI>Saturn,</HI> their Sons
by that of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the most Valiant and
Active of their Grand-sons by this of <HI>Hercules.</HI>
Hence it became difficult to distinguish among
so many; and therefore the Actions of all are
generally ascrib'd to this latter: So that it is ea∣sier
to say he was certainly very eminent in his
Time, than to tell you by what Means he be∣came
so. This <HI>Hercules</HI> was the Son of <HI>Am∣phitryon</HI>
and <HI>Alcmena,</HI> both descended immedi∣ately
from <HI>Perseus;</HI> tho' the Poets assign <HI>Jupiter</HI>
for his Father, which may be understood of
some neighbouring Prince. His early Valour,
and being so nearly related to the Crown, gave
<HI>Eurystheus</HI> sufficient Umbrage; who therefore,
to be honourably rid of him, put him upon all
the dangerous Enterprizes he could devise. The
chief of which are included in his <HI>Twelve La∣bours:</HI>
<PB REF="54"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="29" REF="55"/>
But they are describ'd in so Romantick
a manner, that it is hardly consistent with the
Gravity of History to relate them. For what
shall we say to his <HI>Nemean Lion,</HI> his <HI>Hydra,</HI>
his <HI>Erymanthian Boar,</HI> and the rest of his in∣credible
Acts, unless we understand by them
the most notorious Robbers, Murderers, and
Tyrants subdu'd by him, which, like so many
<HI>Pests,</HI> and <HI>Monrers of Mankind,</HI> at that time
infested the World? To these twelve Labours,
which he perform'd chiefly at the Instigation
of <HI>Eurystheus,</HI> whose Jealousie gave the chief
rise to his Glory, we may add several others
which he undertook of himself: And our E∣steem
of them is not so much the Effect of
a blind Zeal for Antiquity, as the Respect
Men naturally have for a generous Valour,
which protects the weak instead of insulting
them, and is so far from committing Violence,
that it is always best pleas'd, and employ'd in
repressing it. But withal it must be own'd
there was a great deal of the Spirit of <HI>Knight-Errantry</HI>
in these first Ages of the World,
when the Heroes were not content to signalize
themselves at home by freeing their Country,
but rov'd about in Search of foreign Adven∣tures.
And hither may be referr'd the famous
<HI>Expedition</HI> of the <HI>Argonauts;</HI> which falling in
with these Times, and being the first recorded
of that kind, must not be omitted.</P>
<P>The chief Captain of this Voyage was Ja∣son,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Expedition of the</HI> Ar∣gonauts.</NOTE>
a young Prince of <HI>Jolcus</HI> in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> the
Son of <HI>Aeon,</HI> and fourth in Descent from <HI>Ae∣lus;</HI>
who was put upon it by <HI>Pelias</HI> his Uncle,
who had usurp'd the Kingdom. <HI>Jason</HI> reflect∣ing
with himself what Renown <HI>Perseus</HI> and o∣thers
<PB N="30" REF="56"/>
had lately gain'd, clos'd with his Advice;
and declaring his Intention, was seconded by
many young Noblemen, insomuch that above
fifty of the Flower of <HI>Greece</HI> gave in their
Names to the Expedition. The chief of which,
besides <HI>Jason,</HI> and <HI>Hercules,</HI> were <HI>Orpheus,</HI> who
also writ an Account of it, <HI>Oileus</HI> Father of the
younger <HI>Ajax, Telamon</HI> Father of the other
<HI>Ajax,</HI> with his Brother <HI>Peleus</HI> Father of <HI>A∣chilles,</HI>
both the Sons of <HI>Aeacus, Castor</HI> and
<HI>Pollux</HI> Sons of <HI>Tyndareus</HI> King of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and
<HI>Argus</HI> who built the Ship, which from him
was call'd <HI>Argo,</HI> and his Companions <HI>Argo∣nautoe.</HI>
The Design of their Voyage was to fetch back the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> as the Fable calls
it, from Aeetes King of Colchos in <HI>Asia,</HI> or in
more plain terms to plunder him of some vast
Treasure, which they had heard was in his
Possession. Accordingly they fet fail from a
Bay in <HI>Thessaly</HI> near <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olcus,</HI> And having touch'd
at <HI>Lemnos,</HI> and other Places, met with several
fabulous Encounters in their Passage and Re∣turn,
too many, and too incredible to enume∣rate.
Such were the <HI>Symplegades, the Syrens,</HI>
the Harpies, Scylla and Charybdis, which were
disguis'd by <HI>Orpheus</HI> under Poetical Morals,
And seem to have been copied afterwards by
<HI>Homer</HI> in his Travels of <HI>Vlysses.</HI> But being
arriv'd at <HI>Colchos,</HI> by the Afliflance of <HI>Medea</HI> the
King's Daughter, who fell in Love with <HI>Ja∣son,</HI>
they got the Treasure, and return'd home,
taking <HI>Medea</HI> with them by way of Reprisal,
(as they gave out) for <HI>Io,</HI> who was formerly
stole from <HI>Argos. Medea</HI> was marry'd to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣son,</HI>
and afterwards, upon his abandoning her,
to <HI>Aegeus</HI> King of <HI>Athens;</HI> where her Skill in
<PB N="31" REF="57"/>
Magick and Witchcraft, and her many tragi∣cal
Adventures, have furnish'd sufficient mat∣ter
for the Stage.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>Hercules,</HI> his End is made to be
of a piece with the most extravagant Scenes of
his Life. His Applause in the World had gain∣ed
him a sufficient number both of Wives and
Mistresses; of whom the most noted were <HI>Me∣gara,
Iole, Deianeira,</HI> and <HI>Omphale:</HI> And whe∣ther
he fell a Sacrifice to their jealous Resent∣ment
by Poison, or burnt himself in a fit of
Phrenzy upon Mount <HI>Oeta,</HI> or what else became
of him, more than that he dy'd about the fifty
second Year of his Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Death of</HI> Hercules.</NOTE> is not easily determin'd.
<HI>Eurysteus</HI> continu'd his Resentment even after
his Death, and exprefs'd it to his Children, by
commanding <HI>Hyllus</HI> and the rest, about sixty in
number, as they grew up, to quit <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI>
They not being in a Capacity to resist him,
betook themselves to <HI>Athens,</HI> where they were
harbour'd and protected. <HI>Eurystheus</HI> finding
them thus settled in a Body, and carrying it
high upon their own Descent, and their Fa∣ther's
Merit, thought them still too near him;
and therefore invaded <HI>Attica,</HI> with a design to
extirpate them. But by the Assistance of the
<HI>Athenians</HI> they made head against him, and slew
both him and his Sons in the forty third Year
of his Reign; and then in their turn invaded
<HI>Peloponnesus.</HI> But the Plague raging there, and
the Oracle attributing it to their coming before
their time, they retir'd to <HI>Marathon.</HI> After
three Years they made another Attempt: For
so they interpreted the Oracle, which told 'em
they must stay <HI>three Crops,</HI> but by which was
meant <HI>three Generations.</HI> The Armies being
<PB N="32" REF="58"/>
about to engage, <HI>Hyllus</HI> would decide the Quar∣rel
in his own Person, and was slain by <HI>Eche∣mus</HI>
King of <HI>Tegea</HI> in <HI>Arcadia,</HI> who accepted
his Challenge. W hereupon the rest return'd, and
were most of them incorporated with the <HI>Dores</HI>
about <HI>Oeta,</HI> by the means of <HI>Aegimius</HI> their
King, who had adopted <HI>Hyllus,</HI> in return of the
Kindness he had receiv'd from <HI>Hercules,</HI> who
had restor'd him to his Kingdom. After se∣veral
fruitless Attempts made by them and their
Posterity, they at last recover'd their ancient
footing in these Parts. But this <HI>Descent</HI> of
the <HI>Heraclidae</HI> must be referr'd to its proper
Place.</P>
<P><HI>Eurystheus,</HI> upon his Expedition into <HI>Attica,</HI>
had committed the Government of <HI>Mycenae</HI> to
his Uncle <HI>Atreus</HI> the Son of <HI>Pelops;</HI> who upon
his Nephew's Death kept Posscssion of it for him∣self:
And hence the <HI>Pelopidae</HI> got the Ascendant
over the <HI>Perseides,</HI> and became in effect Ma∣sters
of <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Atrcus.</NOTE> <HI>Atreus</HI> is thought to have
reign'd jointly with his Brother <HI>Thyestes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thyestes.</NOTE> But
this latter being taken in Adultery with his
Wife <HI>Aerope,</HI> was banish'd; and when he was
afterwards recall'd, <HI>Atreus</HI> kill'd his Children,
and serv'd them up to him at Table; whence
arose the Proverb of <HI>Thyestes's Supper.</HI> At the
Horror of this Fact the Sun was said to go
back; by which some underhand <HI>Atreus's</HI> Skill
in Astrology, whereby he found out the E∣clipse
of the Sun, and the Difference of its
Motion from that of the Starry Heaven. There
is also another Brother mention'd by the Name
of <HI>Plisthenes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plisthenes.</NOTE> Father of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Mene∣laus,</HI>
who are therefore to be accounted only
the adpoted Sons of <HI>Atreus,</HI> to whose Care they
<PB N="33" REF="59"/>
were committed. But <HI>Plisthenes</HI> was rather
the Son of <HI>Atreus;</HI> and if he succeeded him,
(as it is probable he did) his Years may be
comprehended under <HI>Atreus</HI> and <HI>Thyestes,</HI> to
whom is assign'd a Reign of sixty five Years.
However, it is certain <HI>Agamemnon</HI> succeeded as
next Heir of the <HI>Pelopidae:</HI> Who being a Prince
of Prudence and Courage, obtain'd the Sove∣reignty
not only of <HI>Mycenae</HI> and <HI>Argos,</HI> but of
all as tar as <HI>Sicyon</HI> and <HI>Corinth,</HI> and the Coun∣try
which was afterwards call'd <HI>Achaia.</HI> It
was no small Addition to his Titles to be cho∣sen
General of the Expedition against <HI>Troy;</HI>
which happening at this time, must be more
than barely mention'd, since it was an Action
wherein all the Parts of <HI>Greece</HI> were almost e∣qually
concern'd.</P>
<P>IV. The Destrudion of <HI>Troy</HI> is one of the
most famous <HI>Epocha's</HI> of Antiquity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King∣dom, and War of</HI> Troy.</NOTE> being the
first Term to which the <HI>Grecian</HI> Historians re∣ferr'd
their most remarkable Transactions. It
was this Enterprize that properly put an end to
the <HI>Infancy</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> wherein she try'd her
united Forces, and forewarn'd <HI>Asia</HI> that she
should one day submit to her Yoke. But be∣fore
we proceed to Particulars, it will be ne∣cessary
to premise something of the Certainty
of this War, which is not so establish'd, but
that several have call'd in Quesion either the
Whole, or the greatest Part of what the An∣cients
have left us concerning it. For some will
not allow there ever were such Persons living as
<HI>Agamemnon, Achilles, Hector, Paris</HI> and <HI>Helena.</HI>
Others pretend to collect from ancient Aegyp∣tian
Monuments, that <HI>Helena</HI> was actually mar∣ry'd
<PB N="34" REF="60"/>
to <HI>Paris</HI> the Son of <HI>Priam;</HI> against whom
the <HI>Grecians</HI> out of a Motive of Jealousie en∣ter'd
into a general Confederacy, and were
worsted in several Conflicts, in one of which
<HI>Achilles</HI> was slain by <HI>Hector.</HI></P>
<P>It must be confess'd the <HI>Grecians</HI> were far
from being exact in their Annals; from which
Neglect, together with the additional Fictions
of the Poets, by which they were adulterated,
have proceeded so many different Accounts of
their most noted Occurrences. But as the Ruins
of <HI>Troy</HI> are undeniable Arguments of its former
Greatness, they who reject the Story as
fabulous, ascribe its Fall to Earthquakes and In∣undations,
and call the Elements to their Aid to
maintain the Testimony of a certain <HI>Aegyptian</HI>
Priest, in opposition to the common Consent
both of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Historians. As to the
<HI>Historians</HI> themselves, it must own'd most of
those who are transmitted to Posterity, liv'd
some Ages after the <HI>Trojan</HI> War: (For <HI>Dares
Phrygius,</HI> and <HI>Dictys Cretensis,</HI> as they appear
now in the World, can hardly be accounted
<HI>Genuine.</HI>) But it does not from thence follow,
that they had no Authority but that of <HI>Homer</HI>
for what they said. For neither was <HI>Homer</HI>
the first and only Author, (as some will have
it) who gave an Account of this Expedition,
There are several recorded before him, from
whom undoubtedly he copy'd, as others did
from him. And as some reject the whole Sto∣ry,
so others greedily catch at the leaft Re∣mains
of Antiquity. They fancy the <HI>Ilias</HI> a
faithful, intire Narrative, and will rather take
from the <HI>Author</HI> the Title of a <HI>Poet,</HI> than not
put him in the fame Rank with solid Histo∣rians.
<PB N="35" REF="61"/>
There is certainly a <HI>Medium</HI> to be ob∣serv'd
between there <HI>Extremes;</HI> of which <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
himself, as being the great Master from
whom we derive our Rules of Poetry, was sen∣sible.
He knew he might vary from the Truth
as to <HI>Particulars,</HI> tho' not as to the main <HI>Sub∣ject;</HI>
that he might adorn his Poem with <HI>Pro∣bable
Falsities,</HI> but that the <HI>Principal Action</HI>
ought always to have some real Foundation in
History. How far he has observ'd this Rule,
will better appear by taking a short Survey of
the History of <HI>Troy,</HI> from the first Accounts we
have of it.</P>
<P>What <HI>Troy</HI> was originally before <HI>Teucer's</HI>
time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Teucer.</NOTE> and how long he reign'd there, we are
not sufficiently inform'd. And therefore the
Foundation of it is generally ascrib'd to <HI>Darda∣nus</HI>
an <HI>Arcadian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dardanus.</NOTE> who with several of his Coun∣trymen
under his Conduct coasting along <HI>Europe</HI>
touch'd at <HI>Samothrace,</HI> and from thence seated
himself in <HI>Phrygia</HI> a Province of <HI>Asia Minor,</HI>
where <HI>Teucer</HI> was King; who gave him his
Daughter, and with her some Ground near the
Sea, where he built the City, which with the
Territory was from himself called <HI>Dardania.</HI>
Upon this account some fancy he reign'd jointly
with his Father-in-Law: But it is more certain
he succeeded him in his whole Dominions, and
the People before call'd <HI>Teucri</HI> were from him
nam'd <HI>Dardani.</HI> Whatever the <HI>Grecians</HI> fay
of their <HI>Trojan</HI> Expedition, which they would
have consider'd as a <HI>Prelude</HI> to their Conquests
over the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> from hence it appears that
the <HI>Trojans</HI> were properly a <HI>Grecian</HI> Colony.
Besides they had <HI>Grecian</HI> Names, worship'd
the fame Divinities; and <HI>Homer</HI> has left room
<PB N="36" REF="62"/>
to conjecture, that they spoke the same Lan∣guage:
Otherwise it is hard to conceive, how
a Poet used to be particular in the minutest
Circumstances almost to trisling, should de∣scribe
such frequent Conferences without ever
employing an Interpreter between them.
<HI>Dardanus,</HI> after a Reign of' sixty five Years, left the
Kingdom to his Son <HI>Ericthonius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ericthoni∣us.</NOTE> who was re∣ported
to have been extreamly rich and fortu∣nate.
He, after forty six Years, was succeeded
by his Son <HI>Tros,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tros.</NOTE> from whom the Country took
the Name of <HI>Troas,</HI> and the City, <HI>Troja.
Tros</HI> had three Sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His three Sons,</HI> Ilus, Assaracus, <HI>and</HI> Ga∣nymede.</NOTE> <HI>Ilus, Assaracus</HI> and <HI>Gany∣mede.</HI>
From <HI>Assaracus</HI> is deriv'd the Pedigree
of <HI>Aeneas. Ganymede</HI> was stole away by <HI>Tan∣talus</HI>
Father of <HI>Pelops,</HI> and by consequence
Great Grand-father to <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> which being
highly relented by his Brother <HI>Ilus,</HI> he drove
<HI>Tantalus</HI> out of his Territories, and made him
fly for Refuge into <HI>Greece,</HI> where with his Son
<HI>Pelops</HI> (as was before hinted) he laid the Foun∣dation
of the <HI>Pelopidae.</HI> This became the
Grounds of an hereditary Quarrel between the
Families of <HI>Priam</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> and was
probably the chief, tho' not the common re∣puted
Cause of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War. For it seems
to have been by way of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that <HI>Paris, Ilus's</HI>
Great Grand-son, stole away <HI>Helen</HI> from <HI>Mene∣laus,</HI>
who was Great Grand-son to <HI>Tantalus.
Ilus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ilus.</NOTE> after forty nine Years, succeeded his Fa∣ther
<HI>Tros.</HI> Some ascribe to him the Founda∣tion
of the City, which from him was call'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and was the constant <HI>Grecian</HI> Name, as
<HI>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was the <HI>Latin.</HI> Others refer this Ho∣nour
to <HI>Tros:</HI> But I rather close with those
who give it to <HI>Dardanus,</HI> and believe the o∣thers
<PB N="37" REF="63"/>
only enlarg'd and bcautify'd it, and
chang'd the Name. <HI>Ilus,</HI> after forty Years, left
the Kingdom to his Son <HI>Laomedon;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Laome∣don.</NOTE> who by
the Assistance of <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Apollo</HI> walled
in the City, or in other terms rifted their Tem∣ples
to defray the Expence: For which piece
of Sacrilege, and not making Restitution, the
Oracle told him there was no other way of
appeasing the Gods but by exposing a <HI>Trojan</HI>
Virgin to be devour'd by a Sea-monster: The
lot fell upon his own Daughter <HI>Hesione;</HI> who
was refcu'd by <HI>Hercules,</HI> and the Monster kill'd.
But <HI>Laomedon,</HI> who was noted for Perjury,
denying the Reward he had promis'd for this
Service, <HI>Hercules</HI> laid Siege to the City, took
and plunder'd it, kill'd <HI>Laomedon,</HI> and took his
Son <HI>Podarces</HI> Prisoncr, who was afterwards re∣deem'd
by the <HI>Trojans,</HI> and from thence had
the Name of <HI>Priamus.</HI> Some make <HI>Priam</HI> ra∣ther
assisting to <HI>Hercules</HI> than otherwise; and
that, for his Integrity and Justice, he was
plac'd by him in his Father's Throne, after a
Reign of forty four Years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priamu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Priam</HI> had a large
Extent of Dominion, reaching from <HI>Tenedos</HI>
to the Upper <HI>Phrygia,</HI> containing nine Provin∣ces,
with a proportionable number of Towns.
He rebuilt the City and the Wall, and made
it more defensible with Forts and Bastions,
which from thence took the Name of <HI>Pergama.</HI>
His Court was full of Pomp and Sp'endor;
and thus for many Years he enjoy'd an unin∣terrupted
Scene of Prosperity. To add to
which, he had a numerous Issue of fifty Sons,
great part of them legitimate by <HI>Hecuba</HI> his fe∣cond
Wife. She dream'd, when she was big
with <HI>Paris,</HI> that she should be deliver'd of a
<PB N="38" REF="64"/>
Fire-brand, which should reduce the City to
Ashes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Son Paris.</HI></NOTE> Whereupon <HI>Priam</HI> expos'd the Infant
upon Mount <HI>Ida:</HI> But by his Mother's Care
and Compassion, he was brought up among
the Shepherds; and from signalizing himself
in their behalf against the Robbers of those
Times, obtain'd the Name of <HI>Alexander.</HI> Be∣ing
grown up, whether his generous Qualities
betray'd his Birth, or whether it was by his
Mother's Contrivance, who had manag'd the
Secret, he was made known to his Father, and
receiv'd with a great deal of Satisfaction. Soon
after he fail'd into <HI>Greece,</HI> under a Pretence of
demanding his Aunt <HI>Hesione,</HI> carry'd away by
<HI>Hercules,</HI> and marry'd to <HI>Telamon</HI> the Father
of <HI>Ajax;</HI> but (as the Event shew'd) with a
Design upon <HI>Helena,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Menelaus</HI>
King of <HI>Sparta.</HI> Yet 'tis probable, he had no
further Intent than most of the young active
Heroes of these Times, when they went in
Search of foreign Adventures. Such seems to
be his Arrival at <HI>Sparta,</HI> where he was receiv'd
by <HI>Menelaus</HI> with all the Expressions of Kind∣ness
and Civility. He soon fell in League with
<HI>Helena</HI> his Wife, and carry'd her away with
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rape of</HI> Helen.</NOTE> but (as most of the Rapes of Antiquity
were) with her own Consent. I have men∣tion'd
several old Grudges between the <HI>Greci∣ans</HI>
and <HI>Asiaticks,</HI> with whom the <HI>Trojans</HI> ge∣nerally
sided, as being their Neighb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. So
that whatever <HI>Paris</HI>'s Intentions at first were
he was certainly glad of this Opportunity of
gratifying his Love, and revenging the Quar∣rels
of his Country and Family. For fear of
being purfu'd, he carry'd her first to <HI>Sidon</HI> in
<HI>Phenicia,</HI> where some say they were marry'd
<PB REF="65"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="39" REF="66"/>
and from thence to <HI>Troy;</HI> where they were no
sooner arriv'd, but <HI>Sparta</HI> was in an Uproar,
and <HI>Greece</HI> in general immediately took the A∣larm.
For <HI>Menelaus</HI> his Resentment was soon
seconded by his Brother <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> who bear∣ing
the chief Sway in <HI>Pelopomtesus,</HI> us'd his ut∣most
Efforts to engage all the Princes of <HI>Greece,</HI>
and make it a national Quarrel. And one Rea∣son
why he succeeded so easily in this Design
was, that <HI>Helen</HI> being the fam'd <HI>Beauty</HI> of those
Times, her Father <HI>Tyndareus</HI> had made it a
Condition to the young Princes who address'd
her, that where-ever she should fix her Choice,
they should all in general oblige themselves by
Oath, in case she were stole, to assist in her
Recovery.</P>
<P>Accordingly <HI>Agamemnon</HI> assembled most of
the noted Captains at <HI>Aegium</HI> a Town in <HI>A∣chaia,</HI>
to concert Measures for carrying on the
War, where they chose him their General;
and pursuant to this Agreement they met after∣wards,
with their respective Quota's of Men and
Ships, at <HI>Aulis</HI> a Sea-port of <HI>Baotia,</HI> where
they took an Oath not to return, 'till they had
either recover'd <HI>Helen,</HI> or taken <HI>Troy.</HI> Under
<HI>Agamemnon,</HI> who commanded in chief,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Comman∣ders of the</HI> Grecian <HI>Forces.</HI></NOTE> the
<HI>Spartans</HI> were headed by his Brother <HI>Mene∣laus;</HI>
the <HI>Argives</HI> by <HI>Diomedes, Sthenelus,</HI> and
<HI>Euryalus;</HI> the <HI>Messenians</HI> by <HI>Nestor,</HI> who by
his mature Counsel and Experience made suf∣ficient

Age; the <HI>Arcadians</HI> by <HI>Agapenor;</HI> the <HI>Eleans</HI>
by <HI>Polyxenus, Amphimachus, Thalpius,</HI> and <HI>Di∣ores,</HI>
who were Partners in the Kingdom. As
for the States without the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> the <HI>Atheni∣ans</HI>
were under the Conduct of <HI>Mencstheus</HI> their
<PB N="40" REF="67"/>
King; the Megarensians with the Island <HI>Sala∣mis</HI>
under <HI>Ajax</HI> the Son of <HI>Telamon;</HI> the <HI>Pho∣cians</HI>
under <HI>Schedius</HI> and <HI>Epistrophus,</HI> the Sons
of <HI>Iphitus</HI> the <HI>Argonaut;</HI> the <HI>Aetolians</HI> under
<HI>Thoas; Dulichium</HI> with the Isles of <HI>Echinades</HI>
under <HI>Meges;</HI> the <HI>Cephallenians, Zacynthians,</HI>
and the Inhabitants of <HI>Ithaca</HI> under <HI>Ulysses.</HI>
The <HI>Baetian</HI> Forces had also five Commanders, Le∣itus,
<HI>Arcesilaus, Prothoenar, Clonius,</HI> and <HI>Tersander</HI>
the Son of <HI>Polynices</HI> King of <HI>Thebes;</HI> which lat∣ter
being kill'd in <HI>Mysia</HI> had his Place supply'd
by <HI>Peneleus.</HI> The <HI>Orchomenians</HI> were comman∣ded
by two Brothers, <HI>Ascalaphus</HI> and <HI>Jalme∣nus;</HI>
the <HI>Locri Opuntii</HI> and <HI>Epicnemidii</HI> by the
younger <HI>Ajax</HI> the Son of <HI>Oileus;</HI> and the <HI>Eu∣boeans</HI>
under the Name of the <HI>Abantes</HI> by <HI>Ele∣phenor.</HI>
Out of the Country which was then
called <HI>Pthiotis,</HI> and afterwards Thessaly, <HI>Achilles</HI>
with his Friend <HI>Patroclus</HI> brought the <HI>Myrmi∣dones,
Achaei,</HI> and <HI>Hellenes;</HI> which latter Name,
I observ'd, had not yet universally obtain'd in
<HI>Greece. Protesilaus</HI> the Son of <HI>Iphiclus, Philo∣ctetes</HI>
of <HI>Paean, Podalirius,</HI> and <HI>Machaon</HI> of <HI>Ae∣sculapius,
Eumelus, Euripylus, Polypaetes,</HI> and
<HI>Leonteus</HI> brought in their several Parties out of
the Neighbourhood, with <HI>Guneus</HI> who com∣manded
the <HI>Aenianes</HI> and <HI>Perrhaebii,</HI> and <HI>Pro∣thous,</HI>
the <HI>Magnetes.</HI> There are also mention'd
<HI>Idemeneus</HI> and <HI>Meriones,</HI> as Commanders of the
<HI>Cretan</HI> Forces; and <HI>Tlepolemus</HI> the Son of <HI>Her∣cules</HI>
of the <HI>Rhodian,</HI> From <HI>Syma</HI> came <HI>Nire∣us;</HI>
from <HI>Cos, Carpathus,</HI> and other neighbou∣ring
Isles, <HI>Phidippus</HI> and <HI>Antiphus</HI> of the <HI>Poste∣rity</HI>
of <HI>Hercules.</HI> So that the <HI>Acarnanians</HI> were
the only People of Note, who did not appear
in this general Expedition. What Number these
<PB N="41" REF="68"/>
Forces amounted to,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Number of the
Men and Ships.</HI></NOTE> will best appear from the
Number of their Ships, which by some are
computed at a thousand, but more generally by
others at twelve hundred; whereof the largest
carry'd an hundred and twenty Men, and the
least fifty, who were both Soldiers and Mari∣ners.
And by a middle Computation between
these Extremes, the Number of Men transpor∣ted
in them will amount to about an hundred
thousand; which was not reckon'd such a vast
Number to be collected throughout the whole
Body of <HI>Greece:</HI> But they wanted Mony and
Provisions more than Men, having already more
than they could subsist. For their Ships being
small, and without Decks, such as the Pirates
us'd, they could carry very little Provision with
them.</P>
<P>In this Condition they embark'd at <HI>Aulis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They em∣bark at</HI> Au∣lis.</NOTE>
touch'd at <HI>Lemnos,</HI> and from thence were dri∣ven
by Mistake into <HI>Mysia;</HI> where making In∣cursions
into the Country, <HI>Telephes</HI> the Prince
made head against them, and repuls'd them with
the Loss of <HI>Thersander</HI> the <HI>Baeotian</HI> General.
There happen'd a Conflict immediately upon
their Arrival at <HI>Troy,</HI> wherein <HI>Protesilaus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first Conflict up∣on their Arrival.</HI></NOTE> and
several others were slain, with little Loss on the
<HI>Trojans</HI> Side. The <HI>Grecians</HI> found, by this
warm Reception, what they were to expect;
and having by their Numbers gain'd Ground
enough to encamp, sent <HI>Menelaus</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI>
by way of Embassie to demand <HI>Helen.</HI> The
Business was debated in Council; where <HI>An∣tenor</HI>
and most of the grave Members were for
delivering her up; but <HI>Priam,</HI> tho' otherwise
prudent enough, yet out of Indulgence to his
Son, rather closed with the other Part of the
<PB N="42" REF="69"/>
Council; and rejecting the Demand, dismiss'd
the Ambassadors.</P>
<P>This Aggravation confirm'd both Parties in
their Preparations for War;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A second Engage∣ment.</HI></NOTE> and in the next En∣gagement
the <HI>Trojans</HI> were worsted. After
which the <HI>Grecians</HI> were forc'd through Scarci∣ty
of Provisions to divide their Army; one
part being employ'd in tilling the <HI>Chersonese;</HI>
and another sent for the immediate Relief of the
Camp to scour the Seas; and indeed Piracy in
those Days was look'd upon as a lawful kind of
Merchandise: Others were left to live at Discre∣tion,
by spoiling and ravaging the Country.
These prov'd such favourable Diversions to the
<HI>Trojans,</HI> as gave them Time not only to streng∣then
their Alliances with their Neighbours in
<HI>Phrygia, Lycia, Mysia,</HI> and most Parts of the
<HI>Lesser Asia,</HI> but also to form new ones with fo∣reign
Princes, who sent them considerable Re∣inforcements.
The <HI>Grecians</HI> had no more Men
upon the Spot, than would serve to annoy the
Town, and secure themselves, <HI>Achilles</HI> being
sent with a great Detachment to harrass the
Country, and cut off Provisions from the
City. Wherein he succeeded so well, that he
took twenty three Towns, and in them a great
deal of Booty; upon the Division whereof he was
highly disgusted, because he had taken the great∣est
part of it himself. He had taken with him
<HI>Palamedes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Palamedes.</NOTE> who, as he was carrying on the
War in <HI>Lesbos,</HI> was traduc'd by the false Sug∣gestions
of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and ston'd in the Camp as
a Traitor. The Truth is, he had deserv'd ve∣ry
well of the Army for his Courage, Wis∣dom,
and Learning; and the Envy of <HI>Ulysses</HI>
was the chief Grounds of their Quarrel. To
<PB N="43" REF="70"/>
<HI>palamedes</HI> are ascrib'd sixteen Letters of the
<HI>Greek Alphabet,</HI> or rather four, which he ad∣ded
to the sixteen before invented by <HI>Cadmus;</HI>
as also the ordering and ranking of an Army,
(tho' this was in a great measure owing to <HI>Me∣nestheus</HI>)
with the Watch-word, and several
Sorts of Games to divert the Soldiers. His
Death was highly resented by the Elder <HI>A∣jax,</HI>
and more particularly by <HI>Achilles,</HI> who
for this, and his small Share in the Booty, would
not in a great while be persuaded to prosecute
the War; which seems a more probable Cause
for his Anger, than what the <HI>Poet</HI> assigns of
<HI>Agamemnon's</HI> taking his Mistress from him.</P>
<P>To relate all the Particulars of this War would
be tedious, and perhaps not warrantable. For
what the first nine Years produc'd, amounted
to no more than Sallies and Skirmishes, wherein
the Town could not suffer extreamly, being at
first well provided with Necessaries, having e∣qual
Numbers to pour out upon those who were
before it, and a safe Retreat upon any Miscar∣riage.
So that most agree there was no con∣siderable
Action from the first Year to the tenth;
and <HI>Herodotus's</HI> Opinion is very probable, that
the <HI>Grecians</HI> did not lye before the Town the
first nine Years; but that the <HI>Trojan</HI> Domini∣ons
consisting of nine large Principalities, they
found Employment enough to beat up and down
the Country, spoiling and plundering all before
them, 'till at last they came of course to block
up their Capital City; which has questionless
introduc'd the Mistake of converting this War,
which lasted in all tenYears, into <HI>Decennial Siege.</HI></P>
<P>It is certain, that in the Beginning of the
Summer in which <HI>Troy</HI> was taken, the <HI>Grecians</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="71"/>
presented themselves in a Body before the Town.
The Besieg'd were easily drawn out, as being
little inferior to them either in Numbers or
Commanders;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Account of the</HI> Trojan <HI>Forces.</HI></NOTE> the chief of which were <HI>Hector,
paris, Deiphobus, Helenus,</HI> and the other Sons
of <HI>Priam, Aeneas, Antenor,</HI> and his Sons; <HI>Po∣lydamus</HI>
and <HI>Euphorbus,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Panthus;
Sarpedon</HI> King of <HI>Lycia; Glaucus,</HI> and <HI>Asius;</HI>
besides Foreign Recruits under <HI>Rhesus, Mem∣non,</HI>
and others, who came towards the End
of the War. Upon Hector's appearing without
the Walls, things seem'd to tend to a decisive
Battel; but there were several fought with va∣rious
Suceess,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A great Battel at king Ilus's Tomb.</HI></NOTE> the greatest of which was that
Upon tne plain at king <HI>Ilus's</HI> Tomb; and ano∣ther
at the very Camp of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> where∣in
<HI>Hector</HI> broke through their Intrenchments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A other in the Grecian Camp.</HI></NOTE>
and began to fire their Ships. The <HI>Grecian</HI>
Captains were most of them wounded, except
<HI>Ajax</HI> and his Brother <HI>Teucer;</HI> and their Case
was almost desperate, when <HI>Patroclus</HI> with much
Difficulty obtained Leave of his Friend <HI>Achil∣les</HI>
to march with his <HI>Myrmidons</HI> to their Re∣lief.
By the Assistance of these Troops (which
<HI>Achilles</HI> had kept more out of a Pique than for
a Reserve) the <HI>Grecians</HI> rally'd, and after a sharp
Engagement repuls'd the <HI>Trojans. Patroclus</HI> had
kill'd <HI>Sarpedon</HI> and others, and was in Pursuit
of <HI>Hector,</HI> when <HI>Enphorbus</HI> came behind and
wounded him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Patroclus <HI>kill'd:</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Hector</HI> turn'd and accom∣plish'd
his Death. <HI>Euphorbus</HI> was also kill'd by
<HI>Menelaus;</HI> and this is he, whose Soul <HI>Pythago∣ras</HI>
affirm'd, according to his Notion of <HI>Trans∣migration,</HI>
to have pass'd into his own Body.
<HI>Achilles</HI> was rous'd at the Death of his Friend,
and laying aside all private Quarrels and Resent∣ment

<PB N="45" REF="73"/>
against the Generals, resolv'd to push on
for Conquest and Revenge. Accordingly he
renew'd the Fight, and took twelve young Men,
whom as a Victim to <HI>Patroclus</HI> he kill'd at his
Funeral: He then singled out Hector, slew him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Also</HI> Hector</NOTE>
and dragg'd his Body in Triumph at his Cha∣riot-Wheels,
'till it was ransom'd by <HI>Priam.</HI> His
Death was accompany'd with that of <HI>Memnon,
Troilus</HI> and others; but was soon after reven∣ged
by <HI>Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Achilles,</NOTE> who slew <HI>Achilles</HI> by some trea∣cherous
Stratagem. What way he effected it,
I had rather leave undetermin'd, than take up
with the Poet's Account of it; who, to work
up Love enough in his Hero's Character, gives
him a View of <HI>Polyxena, Priam</HI>'s Daughter, from
the Walls; upon which he falls violently in
Love, and proceeds to Marriage; at which So∣lemnity
he was shot with a Dart by <HI>Paris,</HI> who
lay conceal'd behind an Image in the Temple.
But the Incendiary himself was afterwards slain
by <HI>Philoctetes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and Paris.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Helen</HI> given to his Brother
<HI>Deiphobus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Trojans,</HI> tho' they had lost their chief
Supports, still plac'd a great Confidence in
their <HI>Palladium.</HI> They had been told the Ci∣ty
would never be taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Palla∣dium.</HI></NOTE> so long as that Image
of <HI>Minerva</HI> was in it; and had the same super∣stitious
Opinion of it, that the <HI>Romans</HI> after∣wards
had of their <HI>Ancile</HI> in the Time of <HI>Nu∣ma
Pompilius,</HI> which, like that, was pretended
to have dropt from the Gods as a Pledge of
their Favour. But the fatal Time approaching,
the <HI>Palladium</HI> was stole; and the City either
betray'd by <HI>Antenor</HI> and <HI>Aeneas,</HI> or taken (as
others will have it) by the Stratagem of the
<HI>Wooden Horse.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The wooden Horse.</HI></NOTE> But to consider this Horse in
<PB N="46" REF="74"/>
the manner it is describ'd, cramm'd with Men
in Ambush, and those the chief Officers in
the Army, must argue very odd Management
on both Sides, either that the <HI>Grecians</HI> should
expose themselves, or the <HI>Trojans</HI> admit them;
and seems even in Poetry rather an Extrava∣gance,
than an Ornament. Perhaps this was
the <HI>Battering Ram,</HI> which the <HI>Romans</HI> after∣wards
made use of, and deriv'd from <HI>Greece,
Pliny</HI> fixes the Time of its Invention to the
<HI>Trojan</HI> War, and says it gave Occasion to the
story of and <HI>Wooden Horse.</HI> Which looks the
more probable, because it was the constant Pra∣ctice
of those Times to wrap up the Original
of every Invention in Fables: The Reason of
which might be, that the <HI>Grecians</HI> generally
fetch'd their Knowledge out of the <HI>East,</HI> and
being thus disguis'd, it pass'd more easily for
their own. But whatever Image it bore, Pau∣sanias
says plainly it was a sort of Battering En∣gine
erected by one <HI>Epeus,</HI> and that a Pattern
of it stood in the Castle of <HI>Athens.</HI> This they
employ'd against the Walls, and made a consi∣derable
Breach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Troy <HI>ta∣ken.</HI></NOTE> by which the whole <HI>Grecian</HI>
Army enter'd in the Night, and dispersing
themselves into every Quarter of the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> it
was taken, plunder'd and burnt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2820.</NOTE> <HI>Priam</HI> with
great part of his Family, and the Inhabitants
in general were barbarously murder'd, without
Respect to Age, Quality, or the Places where
they had taken Sanctuary. <HI>Antenor</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI>
were excepted out of this general Massacre;
which seems to confirm their having correspon∣ded
with the Enemy to let the Town be sur∣pris'd.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="75"/>
Thus fell <HI>Troy,</HI> no less famous to Posterity
for having been the <HI>Grecians</HI> first great Scene of
Action, than that it withstood their united Power
so long; and so far happy in its Fall, in having
given Birth to the two best Poems that the
World ever yet produc'd, and in them to sur∣vive
its own latest Ruins. There is another
Honour paid to it by Posterity, in that most
Nations have express'd a particular Vanity in
bringing their Descent from the scatter'd Re∣mains
of the <HI>Trojans.</HI> But those who had most
Colour for their Pretensions were the <HI>Romans,</HI>
who were first the <HI>Albans,</HI> seated in <HI>Italy</HI> by
<HI>Aeneas;</HI> the <HI>venetians</HI> by <HI>Antenor,</HI> who came
with the <HI>Heneti</HI> into the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, and
built <HI>Padua;</HI> and the <HI>Chaonians</HI> planted in <HI>Epi∣rus</HI>
by <HI>Helenus Priam</HI>'s Son. With the City fell
the Kingdom, in the 2820th Year of the World,
and 408 before the <HI>Olympiads,</HI> after it had flou∣rish'd
from its Founder <HI>Dardanus</HI> to <HI>Priam,</HI> in
a regular Succession from Father to Son, the
Space of 296 Years.</P>
<P>Whatever <HI>Troy</HI> suffer'd, the <HI>Grecians</HI> had no
great Reason to boast of their Conquest. They
had lost a sufficient Share in the Field; the rest
were harrass'd and broke with the Fatigues of a
long War, and expos'd to all the Miseries of Storm
and Ship wrack in their Return; which is attribu∣ted
to the Impatience of <HI>Menelans,</HI> who having
recover'd <HI>Helen,</HI> was immediately for putting
to Sea; upon which the Fleet was dispers'd,
some drown'd, others driven upon foreign Coasts
and even those few who arriv'd safe, met with
such Disorders in their Family, such Factions
and Innovations in their Governments, that they
were either murder'd at Home, or forc'd to fly
<PB N="48" REF="76"/>
for Refuge. So that the Wives and Mistresses of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Captains dated their Miseries from this War;
and could not mention <HI>Troy</HI> without Detestation.</P>
<P><HI>Agamemnon</HI> immediately upon his Return
from Troy, in the fifteenth Year of his Reign,
was murder'd by <HI>Aegisthus</HI> Son of <HI>Thyestes,</HI> and
his own Wife <HI>Clytemnestra,</HI> who during his
Absence had liv'd together in Adultery. It is
natural to believe what is not generally assented
to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aegisthus.</NOTE> that <HI>Aegisthus</HI> afterwards usurp'd the King∣dom,
and enjoy'd it for seven Years, 'till <HI>Ore∣stes</HI>
the Son of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> return'd from <HI>Pho∣cis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orestes.</NOTE>
whither he had been convey'd for Fear of
him, and slew both <HI>Aegisthus</HI> and his Mother
<HI>Clytemnestra,</HI> with a Daughter by them call'd
<HI>Helena,</HI> by which means he recover'd his Fa∣ther's
Dominions, tho' not without some Op∣position
of the <HI>Argives.</HI> The Story of his being
tormented by the <HI>Furies</HI> relates to his Remorle
of Conscience for having kill'd his Mother; for
which Fact some say he was formally try'd and
acquitted in the Court of <HI>Areopagus</HI> at <HI>Athenes,</HI>
the Suffrages for and against him being equal;
in which Case Judgment always pass'd in Fa∣vour
of the Defendant. This and other expi∣atory
Acts of his put an End to that continu'd
Scene of Adultery, Incest and Murder, which
had hitherto reign'd in his Family; and he af∣terwards
enjoy'd a long Reign with a great Ex∣tent
of Dominion. It has been before insinu∣ated,
that <HI>Argos</HI> had its Kings after <HI>Acrisius</HI>
but they were no better than a sort of Vice∣roys,
who held immediately of the Kings of
<HI>Mycenae.</HI> But <HI>Orestes,</HI> by the Assistance of the
<HI>Phocians</HI> who were his constant Friends, made
himself more entirely Master of <HI>Argos</HI> than his
<PB N="49" REF="77"/>
Father, or any of his Predecessors: And hence
that Kingdom was thought to be re-united a∣bout
a hundred and forty Years after the three∣fold
Division made between <HI>Anaxagoras, Me∣lampus,</HI>
and <HI>Bias.</HI> Besides this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To Mycenae he adds</HI> Argos, Sparta, <HI>and Part of</HI> Arcadia.</NOTE> he had an
Accession of the Kingdom of <HI>Sparta,</HI> upon the
Death of his Uncle <HI>Menelaus,</HI> whose Daugh∣ter
<HI>Hermione</HI> he had marry'd, being receiv'd
by the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> for want of other law∣ful
Issue, as the Grand-son of <HI>Tyndareus</HI> by
<HI>Clytemnesint;tra.</HI> He had also got Possession of
the greatest Part of <HI>Arcadia</HI> next to <HI>Argos,</HI> up∣on
a Vacancy in the Throne, and dy'd there
after a Reign of seventy Years.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The aeoli∣ans planted in</HI> Asia.</NOTE> Some ascribe
to him the planting a Colony of the <HI>Aeolians</HI>
in <HI>Asia.</HI> But his Son <HI>Penthilus</HI> was rather
Author of this Expedition; and yet he only
attempted it by carrying them into <HI>Thrace,</HI> and
from thence to <HI>Lesbos,</HI> upon the Descent of the
<HI>Heraclidae;</HI> and by his Grand-children it was,
that they were actually seated in Asia. <HI>Orestes</HI>
left two Sons, <HI>Tisamenus</HI> by <HI>Hermione,</HI> and
<HI>Penthilus</HI> by <HI>Erigone</HI> Daughter of <HI>Aegisthus.</HI>
There is a Contest which of them succeeded,
or whether both reign'd together: But we
have most Reason to believe the Kingdom fell
to <HI>Tisamenus,</HI> as being legitimate: He had not
enjoy'd it three Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tisame∣nus.</NOTE> before the <HI>Heraclida</HI> dis∣plac'd
him.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Aristodemus</HI> Great Grand-son of <HI>Her∣cules</HI>
left three Sons, <HI>Temenus, Cresphontes</HI> and
<HI>Aristomachus;</HI> who being now throughly en∣courag'd
and instructed by the Oracle, both
as to the Time and Place of their Descent,
give out they would march through the <HI>Isth∣mus,</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="78"/>
as their Ancestors had done; by which
Feint having drawn down the <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> to
guard that Pass, they cross'd the Sea under the
Conduct of one <HI>Oxylus</HI> an <HI>Aetolian</HI> descended
of <HI>Thoas,</HI> who went to the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Descent of the</HI> Hera∣clidae.</NOTE> and
landed at <HI>Molyerium</HI> with little Opposition.
This Return of the <HI>Heraclidae</HI> happen'd eighty
Years after the Destruction of <HI>Troy,</HI> being the
next Action to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> that affected <HI>Greece</HI> in ge∣neral,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2900.</NOTE>
and more particularly chang'd the Face
of Affairs in <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI> For they challeng'd
<HI>Argos</HI> as their Birth-right, being the next
Heirs of the <HI>Perseides;</HI> which falling to <HI>Teme∣nus</HI>
by Lot (for that was the way of dividing
their Conquests) he took it with some difficul∣ty,
and with it a Village in the Confines,
which he fortify'd as a Place of Retreat for
carrying on the War. Their Pretensions to
<HI>Lacedaemon</HI> were grounded upon <HI>Hercules's</HI> ha∣ving
restor'd <HI>Tyndareus</HI> to the Kingdom, upon
Condition that he sould reserve the Succes∣sion
for his Children. Accordingly <HI>Sparta</HI> was
betray'd into their Hands by one <HI>Philonomus,</HI>
and fell to <HI>Aristodemus,</HI> or rather to his two
Sons <HI>Eurysthenes</HI> and <HI>Procles,</HI> upon their Fa∣ther's
Death. They had as good a Claim to
<HI>Messenia, Hercules</HI> having destroy'd the City
<HI>Pylus,</HI> and conquer'd the Country, and afterwards
given the Kingdom to <HI>Nestor,</HI> upon the same
Terms that he gave <HI>Sparta</HI> to <HI>Tyndareus.</HI> This
fell to <HI>Cresphontes</HI> by a Trick in the Lot; who
ingratiating himself too much with the People,
incurr'd the Hatred of the Nobility, and was
murder'd with two of his Sons. His youngest
Son <HI>Aepytus</HI> escap'd, and reveng'd his Father
by the Death of <HI>Polyphontes</HI> the Usurper: By

which means recovering the Crown, he left a
Succession of seven Kings by the Name of the
<HI>Aepytidae,</HI> who continu'd 'till near the Over∣throw

according to their Promise, they put their

Parts, sent to the <HI>Ionians</HI> their Neighbours and
Kinsmen to admit them; and upon their De∣nial,
were headed by <HI>Tisamenus,</HI> whom they
lost in the Conflict, but however drove them
into <HI>Attica,</HI> and seated themselves in their
Room. <HI>Polybius</HI> makes <HI>Tisamenus</HI> to have reign∣ed
in <HI>Greece</HI> after this, and to have been suc∣ceeded
by several of his Posterity. However,
it is certain the <HI>Heraclidae</HI> put an End to the
flourishing State of the <HI>Pelopidae,</HI> after they had
sway'd the Affairs of <HI>Argos,</HI> and <HI>Mycenae,</HI> about
a hundred and sixty Years.</P>
<P><HI>Temenus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Temenus.</NOTE> whom we left in Possession of <HI>Ar∣gos,</HI>
had marry'd his Daughter to <HI>Deiphontes</HI>
his Kinsman, who became a mighty Favou∣rite
both of King and People; insomuch that
<PB N="52" REF="80"/>
the Sons of <HI>Temenus</HI> grew jealous, left the
Kingdom should be transferr'd to him, and
therefore made away with their Father. Not∣withstanding
this Murder, and the strong Party
for <HI>Deiphontes, Pausanias</HI> says he was succeed∣ed
by his eldest Son <HI>Cisus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cisus the last King in Effect.</HI></NOTE> whose Reign, with
that of his Father, made up forty Years. The
<HI>Argives,</HI> who had always express'd a strong In∣clination
to Liberty, took Occsion upon his
Death to deprive his Successors of all Marks
of Regal Authority, leaving them nothing but
the Title: So that from hence we may proper∣ly
date the Fall of the Kingdom of <HI>Argos,</HI> af∣ter
it had continu'd together with that of <HI>My∣cenae,</HI>
about eight hundred Years, from the be∣ginning
of <HI>Inachus.</HI></P>
<P>To avoid the Inconveniences of a sudden
Change, there was still a Succession of Tit∣ular
Kings: But they were so cramp'd in their
Power, that they could act nothing of them∣selves;
and therefore we find little Mention
made of them. The last who bore that Name
was <HI>Meltas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meltas <HI>the last Titu∣lar King.</HI></NOTE> the Son of <HI>Lacidaus;</HI> who being
some what imperious, and exerting himself be∣yond
his Predecessors, they first depriv'd him
of all the Power he had resum'd, and then con∣demn'd
him to Death; by which means they
pluck'd up all Supremacy by the Roots, and
suffer'd none afterwards to reign amongst them.
For by what <HI>Herodotus</HI> mentions after this of
a King of <HI>Argos,</HI> is meant no more than in the
Common-wealths of <HI>Athens, Carthage and Rome,</HI>
where this Name was apply'd to some particu∣lar
Officers in the State.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argos <HI>a Democra∣cy.</HI></NOTE> So that we must
from this time look upon <HI>Argos</HI> as a settled
Common-wealth; tho' as to its Constitution we
<PB N="53" REF="81"/>
have little more left of the ancient Accounts of
it, than to assure us it was in the nature of a
<HI>Democracy,</HI> the People being divided into four
<HI>Tribes,</HI> in Subordination to whom they had a
Senate chosen annually, to which belong'd the
Executive Power, but of no further Use, un∣less
to prepare Matters for the whole Body,
with Authority to enact Things of lesser Con∣sequence.
They had also a Council of State
consisting of eighty Persons, besides judges for
determining of Causes, with other inferior
Magistrates in the City. In this State the <HI>Argives</HI>
flourish'd for many Ages, and became famous
for their Contests with the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> a∣bout
the Territories of <HI>Tbyrae.</HI> But that
which rais'd, or at least fomented these Diffe∣rences,
was a secret Emulation and Distaste of
each others Government. For the <HI>Lacedaemo∣nians,</HI>
who valu'd themselves upon their Oli∣garchy,
as the best Constitution of any in <HI>Greece,</HI>
were constantly endeavouring to reduce their
Neighbours to the same Model.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Kingdom and Common-wealth of

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing the Space of about 800 years.</HEAD>
<P>1. OF all the Traditions concerning the
Foundation of this Kingdom, none has
been more generally receiv'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lelex <HI>the first King of</HI> Lacedae∣mon.</NOTE> than that <HI>Lelex</HI>
first reign'd in <HI>Lacoria,</HI> near the 2500th Year of
the World, calling his Subjects from himself,
<HI>Leleges,</HI> and the Country, <HI>Lelegia.</HI> He left
two Sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Myles.</NOTE> <HI>Myles,</HI> and <HI>Polycaon;</HI> the former of
which succeeded him in his Kingdom; and
the latter marrying <HI>Messene,</HI> the Daughter of
<HI>Triopas</HI> King of <HI>Argos,</HI> possess'd himself of that
Country, which from her he nam'd <HI>Messenia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eurotas.</NOTE>
<HI>Myles</HI> was succeeded by his Son <HI>Eurotas,</HI> who
passes with some only for a River, because he
cut a large Channel to drain the Country,
which being swell'd with Springs, and conti∣nuing
its Course to the Sea, came to be a Ri∣ver
bearing his Name. After him, for want
of Malc-Issue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lacedae∣mon.</NOTE> the Crown devolv'd upon <HI>La∣cedaemon,</HI>
who had marry'd his Daughter <HI>Spar∣te.</HI>
He built the City, which in Compliment
to his Wife he call'd <HI>Sparta,</HI> as the Country
about it went by his own Name. But tho' in
strict Propriety of Speech, this Difference was
made between <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> and <HI>Sparta</HI> in Pro∣cess
of Time the Distinction sell, and both
<PB N="55" REF="83"/>
Appellations were us'd promiscuously to ex∣press
the City and Country. <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> was
succeeded by his Son <HI>Amyclas;</HI> who had three
Sons, <HI>Argalus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amyclas.</NOTE> <HI>Cynortas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cynortas.</NOTE> and <HI>Hyacinthus,</HI> which
last the Poets turn'd into a <HI>Violet,</HI> being kill'd
accidentally by <HI>Apollo.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Argalus.</NOTE> <HI>Argalus</HI> succeeded his
Father, and left the Kingdom to his Brother
<HI>Cynortas;</HI> and he to his Son <HI>Oebalus,</HI> from
whom the Country went some time by the
Name of <HI>Oebalia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oebalus.</NOTE> <HI>Oebalus</HI> by his first Wife
had <HI>Hippocoon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hippocoon</NOTE> and by <HI>Gorgophone</HI> the Daugh∣ter
of <HI>Perseus</HI> his second, <HI>Tyndareus,</HI> These
two upon their Father's Birth disputed the Suc∣cession;
but <HI>Tyndareus</HI> was forc'd to quit his
Pretensions, 'till <HI>Hercules</HI> made way for him
with the Slaughter of <HI>Hippocoon,</HI> and his ten
Sons, as has been shewn in the History of <HI>Ar∣sgos.</HI>
The Wife of <HI>Tyndareus</HI> was the famous
<HI>Leda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyndareus</NOTE> on whom <HI>Jupiter</HI> was said to have be∣got
Castor and Pollux, from thence call'd Dio∣scuri;
unless they rather acquir'd that Name
from the Fame of their Exploits, being men∣tion'd
as Sharers in most of the generous En∣terprises
of those Times, insomuch that they
were deisy'd after their Death, giving Name
to the <HI>Constellation</HI> of <HI>Gemini;</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> well
as <HI>Greece</HI> express'd a particular Veneration for
them, ascribing some of its most signal Victo∣ries
to their immediate Assistance. <HI>Tyndareus</HI>
had also two Daughters, who made no less
Noise in the World, <HI>Clytemnestra</HI> marry'd to
<HI>Agamemnon,</HI> and <HI>Helena</HI> to his Brother <HI>Mene∣laus,</HI>
after she had been first stole by <HI>Theseus:</HI>
But for the Particulars of Her, and her Hus∣band's
Story, I must refer you to the Ac∣count
of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War. Her two Brothers
<PB N="56" REF="84"/>
dying before their Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Menelaus.</NOTE> <HI>Menelaus</HI> succeeded
<HI>Tyndareus</HI> in Right of his Wife. In his Re∣turn
from <HI>Trey,</HI> he escap'd as well as most of
the <HI>Grecian</HI> Captains; but lost great part of his
Ships in a Storm, and was himself driven with
his Wife into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where some say he
wander'd above seven Years before he return'd
to <HI>Sparta.</HI> As to his <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Voyage, <HI>He∣rodotus</HI>
is positive, that he went thither to
fetch his Wife, whom he makes to have been
detain'd there during the whole War; and in∣sinuates,
that if she had been at <HI>Troy, Priam</HI>
would rather have given her up, than expos'd
his Family and Kingdom to such a train of
Miseries, by supporting his Son <HI>Paris</HI> in the
Possession of another Man's Right, especially
since he was not immediate Heir to the Crown,
nor of equal Merit with several of his Bro∣thers.
He had by <HI>Helen</HI> only a Daughter
nam'd <HI>Hermione,</HI> whom he marry'd to <HI>Orestes</HI>
the Son of <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> and taking her from
him, gave her again to <HI>Pyrrbus</HI> the Son of <HI>A∣chilles.</HI>
But <HI>Pyrrbus</HI> was kill'd, and,' tis thought
by <HI>Orestes</HI> his Means because immediately
upon his Death he resum'd his Wife. And
upon the Death of <HI>Menelaus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orestes.</NOTE> the Lacedaemo∣nians
chose rather to accept of him as the
Grand-son of <HI>Tyndareus</HI> by Clytemnestra, tho'
he was before possess'd of Mycenae and <HI>Argos,</HI>
than of <HI>Nicostratus</HI> and <HI>Megapenthes,</HI> the two
Bastard-Sons of <HI>Menelaus.</HI> Orestes enjoy'd a
long Reign, and was succeeded in ail his King∣doms
by his Son Tisamenus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tisamenus.</NOTE> who was soon
expell'd by the <HI>Heraclidae;</HI> whose Descent is
more fully describ'd, where we had first Oc∣casion
to mention it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="85"/>
This Change put an End to the first State
of <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> wherein nothing happen'd
very remarkable; neither have we sufficient
Authority to assign the Duration, with the o∣ther
Particulars of each King's Reign: Inso∣much
that some <HI>Cbronologers</HI> pass by this whole
Succession, beginning their Accounts from the
<HI>Descent</HI> of the <HI>Heraclidae.</HI> But it fares with
States as it does with Men; the Actions of
their Infancy are generally too trifling to be
recorded; and the Memory of the first Kings
is so easily eclips'd by the Fame of their Suc∣cessors,
that we can expect little more than
their Names, and for the same Reasons even
they are not always handed down faithfully
to Posterity. But upon the whole we may
allow of this Race of thirteen Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first State of</HI> Lacedae∣mon <HI>under thirteen Kings.</HI></NOTE> of which
the three last were of the <HI>Pelopidae.</HI> They
compleated among them a Term of about four
hundred Years: And tho' there were no fixt
Laws to limit the Prerogative, it does not ap∣pear
that there were any considerable En∣croachments
made either on the Kings, or the Peoples side.</P>
<P>II. The Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The second State un∣der the</HI> Heraclidae.</NOTE> which had hitherto
been Monarchical, must now pass under the
Name of a <HI>Dyarchy:</HI> Which Change seems to
have been accidental,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> or rather out of an Ac∣cident
improv'd into a Design of settling two
Kings at the same time upon the Throne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2900.</NOTE> For
<HI>Aristodemus</HI> one of the Brothers of ths <HI>Hera∣clidae,</HI>
dying as they were preparing for the
Expedition, <HI>Lacadaemon</HI> was however allotted
to his Family. He left two Sons, <HI>Eurysthenes</HI>
and Procles, Twins, and so alike, that it was
<PB N="58" REF="86"/>
hardly posslible to distinguish 'em enough to
know upon which to fix the Crown. From
hence 'tis probable, their Mother took the Hint
of turning it to the Advantage of both her
Sons; so that when the <HI>Spartans</HI> came to her
to decide the Controvertsie, she pretended not
to know which was the Elder; and the Oracle
at the same time favouring the Project,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eurysthe∣nes <HI>and</HI> Procles.</NOTE> they
were both declar'd Kings of <HI>Sparta</HI> with equal
Power, but with some Degree of Preference
in Point of Honour to the Family of <HI>Eurysthe∣nes.</HI>
Their Uncle <HI>Theras</HI> was appointed <HI>Pro∣dicus,</HI>
or Protector during their Minority:
And his Regency being expir'd, he planted a
Colony in <HI>Calliste,</HI> an Island in the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea,
better known afterwards from him by the
Name of <HI>Thera.</HI> The Brothers being of Age
began to look upon one another as Rivals in
Empire: And it is not so much a Won∣der,
that this should breed a secret Distaste
and Enmiry between 'cm, as that it should
be propagated down to their latest Pos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arity,
and yet never break out for above eight hun∣dred
Years, so as to dissolve the Constitution.
The Brothers were succeeded by their two
Sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agis, <HI>and</HI> Sous</NOTE> <HI>Eurysthenes</HI> by <HI>Agis,</HI> and <HI>Procles</HI> by <HI>Sous.</HI>
To their Time we may refer the Original of
Slavery in <HI>Sparta.</HI> For <HI>Eurysthenes</HI> and <HI>Pro∣cles,</HI>
having upon a general Survey and Divi∣sion
of the Country granted to it the same
Privileges and Immunities which belong'd
to the City, <HI>Agis</HI> revers'd what his 'Predeces∣sors
had done in Favour of the Country, and
impos'd a Tribute. To which all Parts having
submitted, except the Inhabitants of <HI>Hclos,</HI>
he made 'em Prisoners of War, took away all the
<PB N="59" REF="87"/>
the Privileges they enjoy'd as Members of the
State, and condemn'd both them and their Po∣sterity
to perpetual Slavery.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Origi∣nal of the</HI> Helotae, <HI>or</HI> Spartan <HI>Slaves.</HI></NOTE> To make them
yet a more standing Mark of Infamy, all other
Slaves to the State went by the common Name
of <HI>Helota;</HI> as the word <HI>Slave</HI> is us'd in most
Countries, and deriv'd from the <HI>Sclavi</HI> or <HI>Scla∣vonians</HI>
upon a like Occasion. <HI>Sous</HI> endea∣vouring
to make himself as formidable a∣broad,
as <HI>Agis</HI> was at home, reduc'd great
Part of <HI>Arcadia. Plutarch</HI> has a remark∣able
Passage of him, that being besieg'd
by the <HI>Clitorians,</HI> and mightily press'd for
want of Water, he agreed to deliver up all his
Conquests to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Division of their Con∣quests.</HI></NOTE> upon Condition that he
and all his Men should drink of a Spring near
his Camp. To evade the Force of this Con∣tract,
he offer'd the Kingdom to any one of
his Soldiers who would forbear drinking: But
they having all rejected the Proposal, he came
last himself to the Water, and having only sprink∣led
his Face without swallowing a Drop, march'd
off in the Face of the Enemy, and refus'd to
restore his Conquests. <HI>Echesratus</HI> succeeded
next in the Line of the <HI>Eurysthenida,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Echestra∣tus <HI>and</HI> Eurytion</NOTE> and <HI>Eury∣tion</HI>
or <HI>Euryphon,</HI> some Years after, in that of
the <HI>Proclida.</HI> It does not appear, that there
had yet been any Abatement of that absolute
Power which the former Kings enjoy'd, 'till
this <HI>Eurytion</HI> affecting Popularity, flatter'd and
cajol'd his Subjects, and so slacken'd the Reins,
that the People made daily Incroachments up∣on
him, and took such Advantage of the Easi∣ness
or Necessities of his Succesors, that it
brought the Government into Contempt, and
the whole Kingdom into Confusion. After
<PB N="60" REF="88"/>
these came <HI>Labotas</HI> and <HI>Prytanis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Labota∣and</HI> Pryta∣nis</NOTE> in whose Reigns
happen'd the first Dispute between the <HI>Lace∣damonians</HI>
and <HI>Argives;</HI> but it was not carry'd
far enough to produce any memorable Action.
<HI>Doryssus</HI> and <HI>Eunomus</HI> were the next,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doryssus <HI>and</HI> Euno∣mus.</NOTE> who con∣tinu'd
the Succession of their Families. <HI>Agesi∣laus</HI>
succeeded <HI>Doryssus, Eunomus</HI> still reign∣ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agesilaus <HI>and</HI> Poly∣dectes.</NOTE>
'till at last he was barbarously butcher'd in
a popular Tumult. He left two Sons, <HI>Poly∣dectes</HI>
and <HI>Lycurgus</HI> by two Wives: The for∣mer
of which succeeded him, accompany'd by
<HI>Archelaus</HI> of the <HI>Eurysthenida;</HI> and dying with∣out
Issue, the Right of Succession rested in
his Brother <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> who accordingly took
the Administration upon him. But the Queen
his Sister-in-Law proving with Child, and ha∣ving
made an Overture to him, that she would
destroy the Birth upon Condition he would
marry her, he wisely smother'd his Resentment
of so unnatural a Proposal, express'd abundance
of Joy and Thanks, but withal begg'd of her
not to practise upon her self to the endangering
her Health; for that as soon as die Child was
born, he would take Care to remove it out of
the Way. Accordingly she was deliver'd of
a Boy, which was brought to him as he was at
Supper with the Magistrates, to whom he pre∣sented
him as their King, and to testifie his own
and the Peoples Joy, gave him the Name of
<HI>Charilaus or Charillus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Archelaus <HI>and</HI> Chari∣laus</NOTE> <HI>Lycurgus</HI> still continu'd
the Regency, but it was as Guardian to the
young King; 'till in about eight Months, find∣ing
that his Justice and Generosity were not
sufficient to screen him against the Malice of
the Queen, who would never forgive a Re∣pulse
of that Nature, that her Creatures insi∣nuated,

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="61" REF="90"/>
and her Brother reproach'd him to his
Face, that he was satisfy'd he should soon see
him King, he chose to divert the Storm by Tra∣vel,
and thought his Nephew might in the
mean time have a Son to secure the Succes∣sion.</P>
<P>With this Resolution he first set Sail to <HI>Crete,</HI>
where he took a strict Survey of that Constitu∣tion,
and made an Extract of its best Laws,
with a design, when occasion should serve, to
introduce them to <HI>Sparta.</HI> To this end he
contracted an Intimacy there with <HI>Thales,</HI> not
the Philosopher, but a famous Poet and Law∣giver,
and prevail'd with him to go to <HI>Sparta,</HI>
in order to prepare the People for that great
Change, which he afterwards effected.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Creat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Common∣wealth.</HI></NOTE> As to
<HI>Crete,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lycurgus <HI>his Travels.</HI></NOTE> the Establishment of its Laws is gene∣rally
ascrib'd to <HI>Minos,</HI> who rather improv'd
the Rough-draught laid down by <HI>Rhadaman∣thus,</HI>
who for his Wisdom and Justice is by the
Poets call'd one of the <HI>Infernal Judges.</HI> There
are two recorded by the Name of <HI>Rhadaman-thus,</HI>
and two by that of <HI>Minos:</HI> And whether
the two first of these Names were Natives or
no, is not easie to determine. But the Island
lying so in the Way of those who came out of
the <HI>East,</HI> it seems probable that Civility got
the first Footing there, and that from thence
this Common-wealth made a more early, if
not so remarkable a Figure as some of the other
States of <HI>Greece.</HI> As for the Particulars of its
Constitution, they were in so great a measure
copy'd in that of <HI>Sparta,</HI> that there is no Need
of repeating the same Thing under different
Names. It is sufficient to observe in general,
that <HI>Minos</HI> directed the whole Tenor of his
<PB N="62" REF="91"/>
Laws to the Freedom and Liberty of his Sub∣jects.
From <HI>Crete Lycurgus</HI> pass'd over into
<HI>Asia;,</HI> where tho' he could not but observe a
vast Difference betwixt the Severity of the
<HI>Cretan</HI> Discipline, and the Looseness and Effe∣minacy
of the <HI>Ionians,</HI> yet he every where
found something to add to his own Scheme.
It was here he met with <HI>Homer's</HI> Works, of
which some Fragments before lay scatter'd in
a few private Hands: But it was through his
means, that they were publish'd intire, and ge∣nerally
admir'd, tho' they still wanted that
Order and Beauty, with which they after∣wards
appear'd in the World, and which was
owing chiefly to the Care of <HI>Solon,</HI> and Pisi∣stratus.
From hence 'tis thought he went in∣to
<HI>Aegypt:</HI> But as for his Travels into the
more remote Parts of the World, and his Con∣ferences
with the <HI>Gymnosophists</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
they are not sufficiently attested. But whilst
he was making these Improvements abroad, he
was mightily wanted at home; and all Parties,
with the Consent of the Kings themselves, sent
several formal Embassies to sollicit his Re∣turn.
For after the Murder of <HI>Eunomus,</HI> with
other Tragical Effects of the Peoples late Info∣lence,
every thing tended to Sedition and A∣narchy;
and such unavoidable Destruction
threaten'd the State, that they plac'd their
sole Confidence in <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> who had be∣fore
given 'em such large Demonstrations of
his Justice and Integrity.</P>
<P>III. This was the Posture of Affairs when
<HI>Lycurgus</HI> return'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lycurgus <HI>settles the State</HI></NOTE>. who finding the People ge∣nerally
dispos'd to receive any new Impressi∣ons,
<PB N="63" REF="92"/>
would lose no Time: And the Corruption
being Universal, he found it necessary to change
the whole Face of the Common-wealth. But
considering how requisite a Shew of Religion
is in such Cases to gain Credit and Authority,
he went first to consult <HI>Apollo at Delphi,</HI> where
the <HI>Pythia</HI> call'd him, <HI>Beloved of the Gods, and
rather God than Man.</HI> To this famous Ora∣cle
he gave the Name of <HI>Rhetra,</HI> pretending
to receive in it the Form of a Common-wealth,
with an Assurance, that it should be the most
flourishing of any in the World. Encourag'd
by such happy Omens, he broke his Designs
first to his particular Friends, and then by de∣grees
gain'd others to his Party, 'till Things
being ripe for Action, he order'd thirty of the
principal Men to appear arm'd in the Market∣place,
to strike a Terror into those who op∣pos'd
him. King <HI>Charilaus</HI> was alarm'd, and
took Sanctuary in the Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI>
'till being let into their Designs, and withal of
a flexible Temper, he came out, and join'd in
the Confederacy.</P>
<P>Having made this first necessary Step, he
began at the Head of the State: And tho' he
continu'd the two Kings with the same Right
of Succession, he made sufficient Abatements
in their Power by instituting a <HI>Senate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He Insti∣tutes a se∣nate</HI></NOTE> as a
Counter-poise between the Prerogative and the
People, their Business being to adhere to the
weaker Side, 'till they reduc'd Things to an
Equal Ballance. It consisted of twenty eight
Persons besides the Kings, the first Choice be∣ing
made out of those who had been assisting
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Lycurgus</HI> in the Settlement; and after them
were admitted the most Eminent for their pri∣vate
<PB N="64" REF="93"/>
Virtue, or their Services to the Publick, but
none under sixty Years of Age. They were
continu'd for Life, except upon any notorious
Misdemeanor: Which as it prevented the Incon∣veniences
of too frequent a Change in that
Body, so it was a lasting Reward to the Old
Men, and an Encouragement to the Young.
They were the <HI>Supreme Court of Judicature;</HI>
and tho' there lay an Appeal from them to
the People, we find but few Instances of it
because they proceeded with such Deliberati∣on
and Caution, that they often staid several
Days to see what further Evidence could be
brought on either Side before they pass'd Sen∣tence.
And after all, they were not accounta∣ble
for their Determinations; which <HI>Arislotle</HI>
takes Notice of, as a larger Immunity, than
is consistent with the just Form of a Common∣wealth.
When we consider further, that they
had in Effect the whole <HI>Executive Power</HI> in
their Hands, it will easily appear what Figure
their Kings made, who are to be look'd upon
but as the chief Members of the Senate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By which the power of the kings is limited</HI></NOTE> since
they had not Authority to decree, or under∣take
any thing of Consequence, without a Ma∣jority
on their Side. They had indeed some
particular Respect and Deference paid to their
Persons, having the chief Seats in the Assem∣bly,
giving their Opinion and Vote first; and
<HI>Herodotus</HI> insinuates, that they had double
Votes. But as to their particular Offices, they
amounted to little more than the Reception
of Ambassadors, and other Strangers, with the
Care of Sacrifices, Oracles, Adoptions, Heires∣ses,
and the High-ways. They were also liable
to be call'd to Account for Male-administrati∣on,
<PB N="65" REF="94"/>
being formally try'd, and condemn'd ac∣cording
to the Nature of the Crime, only
with a Reserve, which every private Citizen
had, of appealing to the People. So that upon
the whole, they had a more extensive Jurisdi∣ction
as Senators, than as Kings: For however
they were sooth'd with the Title, and Shew of
Majesty, they were in Effect much inferior
to the <HI>Roman Consuls,</HI> and scarce so much as
the present <HI>Doges of Venice.</HI> This was their
Condition at Home: But in the Field they
appear'd to a greater Advantage, where, as Ge∣nerals
of the Armies, they had a more abso∣lute
Command. They had to attend them a
<HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Horse,</HI> with <HI>Judges</HI> in the na∣ture
of <HI>Field-Deputies,</HI> besides <HI>Colonels,</HI> and o∣ther
inferior Officers, whom they advis'd with
as their Council, but were free to act as they
thought convenient. Not but they receiv'd
their Orders from the State; which tho' they
were for the most part discretionary, yet were
they sometimes forc'd to march against an Ene∣my,
or to return Home, when they least thought of it.</P>
<P>As to the Peoples Share in this new Settle∣ment,
they had their <HI>Assemblies,</HI> the <HI>Lesser</HI> con∣sisting
of the Citizens only, and the <HI>Great one</HI>
of the whole Body of the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> who
were free of the State. But they were little
more than meer Matter of Form: For the Se∣nate
assembled, and dismiss'd them when they pleas'd, and propos'd what they thought con∣venient;
which the People had nothing to do
but to ratisie, or reject, having not the Liberty
to propose, debate, determine, or so much as
to deliver their Opinion. To add to which,
<PB N="66" REF="95"/>
they were left out of all the Offices in the
State. So that they were very little Gainers
by what the Kings lost, 'till <HI>Lycurgus</HI> made it up
to'em by his next Task, which seems the most
difficult and hazardous of any he undertook;
tho' it was indeed the chief Hinge upon which
his whole Fabrick turn'd. This was his Divi∣sion
of the Lands, which had been engross'd
chiefly by those who made their Advantage
of the late troublesome Times. To these he
represented the Convenience, and Necessity of
having no Inequality or Distinction amongst
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Di∣vision of Lands</HI></NOTE>. but what Vice and Virtue made; and
having the poor, and indigent, which were the
Gross of the People, on his Side, prevail'd with
'em to renounce their Properties. Then taking
an exact Survey of all <HI>Laconia,</HI> he divided it
into thirty thousand equal Shares, allotting nine
thousand to the City in Proportion to the In∣habitants,
and the rest to the Country. Each
Portion was sufficient to maintain a Family in
that srugal manner he propos'd: And tho' the
Kings had a larger Share assign'd 'em to sup∣port
their Dignity, yet their Tables had ra∣ther
an air of Decency and Competency, than
of Superfluity and Luxury.</P>
<P>But the Mony still lying unequally dispers'd,
and the Law-giver considering, that must of
Course bring the Lands again into few Hands,
forbid the Use of Gold and Silver,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gold and Silver pro∣hibited</HI></NOTE> instituting
Iron Mony in the room of it. Which being
current only at Home, and a great Quantity re∣quir'd
to make up a little Sum, this brought
Mony into such Disuse, that few troubled them∣selves
with more than to supply their common
Necessities: And so by Consequence he ba∣nish'd
<PB N="67" REF="96"/>
Avarice, Rapine and Luxury, with their
long Train of Attendants: And the Reason
why we meet with so few Courts of Judica∣ture
in <HI>Sparta,</HI> is, that by this Means he took
away all Occasion of Law-Suits. This Project
was laugh'd at by the other <HI>Grecians,</HI> as ha∣ving
cut off all Trade, and Merchandise: But
<HI>Lycurgus</HI> had his Aim in it, since it serv'd not
only to suppress all Trades and Arts at Home,
which tended to Effeminacy and Excess, but
also prevented the Importation of <HI>Foreign Va∣nities;</HI>
and kept another Law in Force, which
he made expresly against the Continuance of
Strangers in the City, for fear of their corrupt∣ing
the People, and breaking in upon his Con∣stitution.
And it was for the same Reasons,
that he would not permit his own People to
Travel.</P>
<P>His next Ordinance was levelld against pri∣vate
Luxury, that the Men should not eat at
Home with their Families, but in one Com∣mon
Hall without Distinction of Dignity, or
Fortune. These Meetings were at first call'd
<HI>Andria,</HI> (the Name the <HI>Cretans</HI> us'd, from whom
the Custom was deriv'd) afterwards <HI>Phiditia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ditia.</NOTE>
and <HI>Syssitia.</HI> Every one sent his Provisions
in monthly, with a little Mony for other Con∣tingencies:
But all such Things were forbid,
which tended rather to pamper than nourish,
one of their chief Dishes being the famous
<HI>Spartan</HI> Broth, which was black, and not very
palatable to those who were not us'd to it.
This Way of Supping in Common was at first
so strongly oppos'd, that <HI>Lycurgus</HI> was insulted
about it, but when establish'd by Custom, it was
strictly observ'd, and the Children were sent
<PB N="68" REF="97"/>
to these Tables, as to Schools of Temperance,
and Conversation.</P>
<P><HI>Lycurgus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spar∣tan Edu∣cation.</NOTE> by this Regulation of the State, in∣tended
that of Manners, as the only Means to
support it, not thinking any one could make a
good Citizen, who was not first a good Man,
And as their Morals depended chiefly on E∣ducation,
he took Care to instill such early
Principles, that they should in a manner be
born with a Sense of Order and Discipline.
To this End he began from the very Time of
their Conception, making it the Mother's In∣terest
to use such Diet and Exercise, that she
might produce Children of a robust, vigorous,
and hardy Constitution. For if the Infant, up∣on
a publick View at its Birth, was judged to
be so deform'd, or weak, that it would prove
rather a Burden, than a Benefit to it's Coun∣try,
it was barbarously expos'd to perish in a
Cavern near Mount <HI>Taygetus.</HI> Those who
were free from these Defects, were deliver'd
back to their Parents, and nurs'd with Hard∣ship,
and Severity in Diet, Cloaths, and every
thing else, beyond what one would imagine
Boys of that Age were capable of Bearing.</P>
<P>At seven Years old their Parents had in a
manner done with them: For they were then
reckon'd Children of the Publick, and accord∣ingly
assign'd over into <HI>Classes,</HI> or Companies,
in which one more forward and experienc'd
than the rest presided as Captain, to govern and
chastise them, as he thought they deserv'd.
For their very Sports and Exercises were re∣gulated
according to the exactest Discipline,
and made up of Labour and Fatigue. They
went bare-foot, with their Heads shav'd, and
<PB N="69" REF="98"/>
fought with one another naked: And there
was a yearly Custom of whipping them at the
Altar of <HI>Diana Taurica,</HI> which they would
bear patiently 'till the Blood ran, and sometimes
with a strange sort of Emulation, 'till they
dy'd upon the spot. <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells a Story of
a Boy, who having stole a Fox, and hid it
under his Coat, chose rather to let it tear out
his very Bowels, than discover the Thest. For
Stealing with them was lawful, and encourag'd
as a piece of Military Exercise, but punishable
if found out.</P>
<P>At twelve Years old they were remov'd in∣to
other <HI>Companies</HI> of the same Nature: Where,
in order to crush the Seeds of Vice, which
began at that Time to display themselves, their
Labour and Discipline were encreas'd with
their Age.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pae∣donomus.</NOTE> Here they had their <HI>Padonomus,</HI>
who was the general Inspetor into their Be∣haviour
and under him the <HI>Irens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Irens.</NOTE> young Men
selected out of their own Body, one allotred
to each Company, to exercise a more constant
and immediate Command over them. Being
now arriv'd to a more Manly and Martial sort
of Exercise,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The peo∣ples Share in the Go∣vernment</HI></NOTE> they had their Skirmishes between
Parties, and their Mock-fights, or rather real
Engagements of greater Bodies: Of which
the most eminent were the <HI>Platanista,</HI> (so call'd
from the Place being set with Plane-Trees)
where they fought with Hands, Feet, Teeth
and Nails and with such Courage and Obsti∣nacy,
that it was common with 'em to lose
their Eyes, Limbs, and sometimes their Lives,
Before the Business was decided. Then as to
the politick Part, they had their Watches,
Guards, Ambuscades, with other Wiles and
<PB N="70" REF="99"/>
Stratagems of War, to give them a Notion
of what they were afterwards to do in the
Field.</P>
<P>There was also due Care taken for the Im∣provement
of their Minds: But as their chief
Business was Action and Obedience, a mode∣rate
degree of Learning was thought sufficient;
and they receiv'd their Instructions rather from
Men than Books. To this End the gravest
Citizens took a Pleasure in examining them, to
try the Pregnancy of their Parts: And the
<HI>Irens</HI> at Supper made 'em propose to one ano∣ther
variety of Questions, to which they were
to give ready, clear, and short Answers. Which
being improv'd into an Habit, it taught'em
a natural and graceful way of speaking, and
furnish'd 'em with such a Presence of Mind,
and Quickness of Thought, that they gave
very surprising Turns to things, either by way
of Repartee, or Apothegm, as the Subject
would bear.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Origi∣nal of the</HI> Laconick <HI>Stile,</HI></NOTE> This was the Foundation of
that pithy Stile, which they afterwards re∣tain'd,
and was distinguish'd by the Name of
the <HI>Laconick,</HI> being recommended by <HI>Lycurgus</HI>
upon this Principle, <HI>That few Laws would
serve those, who us'd but few Words.</HI> And tho'
the <HI>Spartans</HI> were no Friends to Oratory, they
were observ'd to deliver themselves as hand∣somely,
and generally more to the purpose, than
those who had gone through a formal course
of Study, and us'd a long train of Arguments.
For this concise manner of expressing them∣selves,
detracted nothing from the Strength of
their Thoughts, but rather gave them a greater
Energy. It was an instructive Brevity; and
its Beauty was, that there was more imply'd
<PB N="71" REF="100"/>
than express'd. Such was the constant strict
Discipline they under-went during their Mi∣nority,
which we may conclude lasted 'till
they were thirty Years of Age, since they
could not before that time marry, go into the
Army, or bear any Office in the State: And
if they did not marry soon after that Form,
they were publickly disgrac'd.</P>
<P>The Rules for the Education of Virgins
were much of the same Stamp with that of
the Boys, with very little Regard to the natural
Softness of the Sex. They were inur'd to a
constant course of Labour and Industry 'till
they were twenty Years old, before which time
they were not allow'd to be marriageable.
They had also their Exercises of Running,
Wrestling, Darting, and Throwing the Bar;
most of which they perform'd naked and in
publick: And yet this was thought so far from
contributing to Vice, or Immodesty, that it
was design'd as a Guard to Virtue, by appear∣ing
with such native Innocence and Simplicity.
Their excelling in these Feats of Activity
seems to have been the Foundation of that
Sense of Honour, and Greatness of
Spirit, of which the <HI>Spartan</HI> Women were Mistresses;
and of which there is a notable Instance in
<HI>Gorgo,</HI> the Wife of King <HI>Leonidas,</HI> who was
told in Discourse with some Foreign Ladies,
<HI>That the Women of</HI> Lacedaemon <HI>were they only
of the World, who had an Empire over the Men;</HI>
to which she briskly reply'd, <HI>There was good
Reason for it; for they were the only Women who
brought forth Men.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Adultery allowe'd of.</NOTE> In speaking of the Wo∣men,
it is observable, that among other Provi∣sions
for Marriage, there was no Law against
<PB N="72" REF="101"/>
Adultery; and the Reason assign'd for it, is,
that there was no such thing ever heard of in
<HI>Sparta.</HI> But this looks like an Equivocation:
For whatever Name they gave it, the Thing
was certainly practis'd, and in a manner au∣thoriz'd.
It was by way of Borrowing and
Exchanging with their Neighbours for a Time
by Consent: So that if a Woman lik'd another
Man better than her Husband, the Pretence
was always at hand, to mend the Breed, with∣out
the Inconveniences of a Divorce. The
Case was much the same on the Man's side:
And one Reason of allowing this mutual Li∣berty,
was not so much to gratifie Lust, as to
remove so fruitless and racking a Pain, as that
of Jealousie. These were the Methods <HI>Lycur∣gus</HI>
took for the training up of Youth, and making early and
deep Impressions of Virtue.
He knew how near Custom and Education ap∣proach'd
to Nature; and therefore it was from
thence only, that he promis'd to himself a last∣ing
Settlement of the State. Which seems to
have been the chief Reason, why he would
never reduce his Laws to Writing.</P>
<P>He laid down other general Maxims,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Mi∣scellany Laws.</NOTE> in the
Nature of Laws: As that they should not of∣ten
make War upon the same Enemies, for fear
of learning them their Discipline, 'till in Time
they came to be the Aggressors. Another
was, that the City should not be wall'd, say∣ing,
<HI>He would have a Wall of Men instead of
Brick:</HI> And indeed their Way of Discipline
kept them so constantly on their Guard, and so
in a Body, that it was hardly possibly for
them to be surpris'd; the Tilling of the
Grounds, and all other servile Drudgery, being
<PB N="73" REF="102"/>
left to the <HI>Helots.</HI> It was not lawful to sell
any of these Slaves into Foreign Countries, or
to make 'em Free: So that their continual En∣crease
gave Umbrage to the State, and occa∣sion'd
the <HI>Cryptia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Cryp∣tia.</NOTE> or <HI>Secret Act;</HI> by which it
was order'd, that several Companies of young
Men should now and then be dispatch'd into
the Country, who lying conceal'd all Day in
the Thickets, were to rush out upon 'em in
the Night, and kill all they could lay their
Hands on. This is generally ascrib'd to <HI>Ly∣curgus;</HI>
tho' <HI>Plutarch</HI> says, he was of too mild
a Disposition to authorize such a Barbarity.
And indeed it seems more probable, that this
Ordinance was of a later Date in the Time of
the <HI>Ephori,</HI> who proclaim'd War against 'em.
But 'tis certain, that at this Time they were
us'd more like Beasts than Men of the same
Society, being often made drunk, and carry'd
into their publick Halls to expose Vice. This
severe Treatment of 'em occasion'd a Saying,
that, <HI>He who was Free in</HI> Sparta, <HI>was most so
and a Slave there, was the greatest Slave in the
World.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the Form of the Common-wealth
instituted by <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> wherein his Success an∣swer'd,
or rather exceeded his very Wishes.
For it cannot easily be imagin'd, how so sud∣den
and universal a Change could be wrought
by one who had nothing but his single Virtue
to oppose against two Kings in Possession of the
Throne. Nor is it less surprising, that a <HI>Pa∣gan,</HI>
who was indeed too indulgent to Adul∣tery,
Theft, and, in some Cases, to Murder it
self, should in the rest approach so near to
<HI>Christian</HI> Morality, as sometimns to overtake it.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="103"/>
The Effects of this Change being too mate∣rial
to omit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ef∣fects of this Change:</NOTE> and too many to enumerate, will
best appear by taking a short Survey of the
Whole, with the general Advantages that ac∣cru'd
by it. Things being put upon so equal
a Foot, there was no Matter left for private
Debates and Ammosities: Every Member of
the State had nothing to do but to attend the
Publick; and as they conspir'd to the general
Good, they found their own in it. In lieu of
their Mony, which they had parted with, they
were possess'd of more inexhaustible Treasures:
And of all their Wealth, nothing was esteem'd
more precious than their Time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">With a short Sur∣vey of the New Set∣tlement.</NOTE> They had
their constant Employments suited to all Ages,
and Capacities; and were so far from consider∣ing
Labour as base and servile, that they em∣brac'd
it as the Occupation of a Man sincerely
free. This Love of it interdicted all Plays even
to Children; and the Soldier was not suffer'd
to walk at his leisure Hours. In short, every
Moment was devoted to Virtue; and it was a
sort of Sacrilege to let the least Particle of it
slip by unemploy'd. They were good Hus∣bands
even of their Words; so that a single
Syllable often serv'd for an Answer to the most
important Dispatches. Some of their Neigh∣bours
having sent 'em a threatning Message,
<HI>That if they got into their Country, they would
put all to Fire and Sword,</HI> they return'd An∣swer,
<HI>If.</HI> Their very Silence was expressive
and emphatical. They observ'd the strictest
Rules of Temperance; so that Wine was seldom
us'd among them, and a Wheaten Loaf was
reckon'd among their Dainties. There was no
such thing as Splendor or Magnificence in
<PB N="75" REF="104"/>
<HI>Sparta.</HI> To go differently cloath'd, according
to the Seasons of the Year, was there look'd
on as a criminal Effeminacy: Even the Sex
that is most curious in the ornamental Part,
studied only that of the Mind. They sacrific'd
all sorts of Luxury to the Liberty of the Mind;
and conceiv'd as great an Aversion to Sloth
and Voluptuousness, as we naturally have to
Pain and Grief. For this and other prevailing
Reasons, the Diversions of the Theatre were
not privileg'd, lest they should accustom their
Eyes to behold the Representation of what
was condemn'd by their Law, or their Ears
to be polluted with the Apology of guilty
Passions. The Law rul'd with an equal Au∣thority
over the Rich and the Poor: Their
Kings valu'd themselves upon their Subjection
to it, and distinguish'd themselves only by a
stricter Obedience. Merit appear'd in every
Age and Sex. Youth had no need to wait for
the Lessons of Experience, which were sup∣ply'd
by Institution and Example; whereby
Women became capable of the most elevated
Virtues. The Love of their Country silenc'd
all maternal Softness, and made the Mother,
when she heard her Son was slain in the Ser∣vice
of the Publick, regulate her Grief, accord∣ing
as the Wounds he receiv'd, were shameful,
or honourable. After the strict Discipline they
had undergone at Home, they met with no∣thing
terrible in the Field; and were <HI>The only
People in the World, to whom War gave Repose.</HI>
From hence it was, that they proceeded with
a well-grounded deliberate Valour to an En∣gagement,
and propos'd no End of it, but
Death, or Victory. The Reputation of so
<PB N="76" REF="105"/>
extraordinary a Merit prevail'd with the Kings
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and <HI>Phaenicia</HI> to pay a sort of Homage
to them, and testifie their Submission in most
solemn Embassies. Nor were the <HI>Grecians</HI> them∣selves
less struck with Esteem and Reverence
for them, being persuaded that to attend them,
was to follow Justice and Reason, and to pursue
their own Honour and Interest. For Tyranny met in <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> with most terrible and impla∣cable
Enemies; Liberty, faithful and indefati∣gable
Protectors. By this means <HI>Sparta</HI> exer∣cis'd
that Empire over the other States of
<HI>Greece,</HI> which her Virtue had given her: And
so long as the govern'd by that Title, was re∣verenced
as the <HI>Mother of Nations, Protectress
of the Common Cause,</HI> and <HI>Supream Judge of all
Differences.</HI> For all which she neither receiv'd,
nor exacted any other Tribute, than that of
Esteem, Love, Trust and Admiration.</P>
<P>Her Constitution however was not without
its Faults.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defects in the <HI>Spartan</HI> Constituti∣on.</NOTE> I have mention'd some notorious
ones as to the Moral Part: And the Govern∣ment
in general carry'd such an Air of Hror
with it, that it was rather admir'd, than imita∣ted.
Their strict Discipline was harden'd into
a Moroseness of Tempe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; so that they knew not
how to abate of their Rigour upon Occasion,
but extended the same harsh Severity to their
Allies, which they us'd towards one another.
Besides, there was no Peace, nor Truce ob∣serv'd
in a Common-wealth devoted to Arms,
and whose very Constitution was War. This
by degrees made their Government distasteful;
and favour'd the Ambition of the <HI>Athenians</HI>
their Rivals, and indeed their Reverse: Who
had liv'd a great while without any Thoughts
<PB N="77" REF="106"/>
of Command; but at last exerted themselves,
(as will appear by the Sequel of the Story) and
drew both their own, and their Neighbours
Necks out of the Collar.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Lycurgus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of <HI>Lycur∣gus.</HI></NOTE> when he had fi∣nish'd
his Scheme, and found the Common-wealth
able to support it self, he drew an Oath
from the whole Body of the Senate and Peo∣ple
to observe his Laws 'till his Return; and
going to <HI>Delphi,</HI> as some say, to enquire whe∣ther
he had omitted any thing necessary to the
Preservation of the State, there starv'd him∣self.
Others say he dy'd in <HI>Crete,</HI> ordering his
Body to be burnt, and his Ashes thrown into
the Sea. We can only conclude he dy'd in
a voluntary Exile; and perhaps it was not
known where, lest being transported back to
<HI>Sparta</HI> either alive or dead, the People should
make it a Pretence of freeing themselves from
their Oath, and cancel his Laws. But they
bore no less Respect to his Memory, than to
his Person: They built a Temple, and paid
Divine Honours to him; and yet <HI>Aristotle</HI> thinks
it was less than he deserved.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> He was certainly
a Person of exquisite Justice and Moderation, as
well as Prudence. No body had a better Right
to prescribe Laws to a Kingdom, than he, who
could refuse one, when it was in a manner
forc'd upon him; and who run a greater Risque
by declining the Offer, than he would have
done by accepting it. He was not more re∣markable
in the Invention of his Laws, than in
recommending them by his Example; since he
ordain'd nothing to oblige others, which he did
not punctually observe himself. And that he
was equally as desirous to perpetuate the Hap∣piness
<PB N="78" REF="107"/>
of the State, as to advance it for the pre∣sent,
appears from his voluntary Retirement,
and the Manner of his Death.</P>
<P>With this Settlement by <HI>Lycurgus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The End of second state of</HI> Lacedae∣mon.</NOTE> we may
conclude the second State of <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> after
it had continu'd between two and three hundred
Years in a regular Succession of the two Fami∣lies
of <HI>Eurysthenes,</HI> and <HI>Procles.</HI> Whatever fur∣ther
Alterations it underwent, by which it in∣clin'd
more towards a <HI>Democracy;</HI> yet the Regal
Power was already so limited, that we are to
look upon the present Establishment rather as a
Common-wealth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third state was properly a Common-wealth.</NOTE> than a Kingdom: And there∣fore
we shall not mention the succeeding Kings
in any Order, as Kings, but only with Relati∣on
to some principal Actions which they were
concern'd in, either as chief Officers of the
State, or Generals of the Army. But tho' we
have brought the <HI>Spartan</HI> Story down to this Pe∣riod,
it seems necessary to prosecute it a little
further, so as to take into our Account the
<HI>Messenian</HI> War; which being the chief Action
of Note between the <HI>Trojan</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> Wars,
requires somewhat of a distinct Relation; but
had too little Dependance upon the other Af∣fairs
of <HI>Greece</HI> to be interwoven with them, and
falls more properly under our present Conside∣ration
of <HI>Sparta,</HI> as a separate State.</P>
<P>IV. The <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> soon after the Death
of their Law-giver, grew impatient for Action;
and renewing the War formerly begun with the
<HI>Argives</HI> about their Confines, King <HI>Charilaus</HI>
enter'd their Country with Fire and Sword.
Some few Years after, they fell upon the <HI>Te∣geata</HI>
of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> who also border'd upon 'em,
<PB N="79" REF="108"/>
grounding their Confidence of Success upon
the Oracle, which had told 'em they should
measure the <HI>Arcadian</HI> Ground with a <HI>Rope.</HI> Ac∣cordingly
they took their Ropes with 'em,
with which they fancy'd they were to bind
their Enemies as they took them. But they
were shamefully deluded in their Interpretati∣on:
For the <HI>Tegeatae,</HI> both Men and Women, op∣pos'd
and routed them, took many of them Pri∣soners,
and bound 'em with their own Ropes.
<HI>Charilaus</HI> was also taken, but soon releas'd upon
his Oath never to fight more against 'em. Yet
he had after this an Hand in the Destruction of
Aegys, and other neighbouring Cities belonging
to the <HI>Achaeans,</HI> which were thought to side

was <HI>Teleclus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> whose
Death happen'd thus. There was a Temple of
<HI>Diana</HI> frequented by the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> and
<HI>Messenians,</HI> as standing upon their Borders, and
in common to Both. The <HI>Messenians</HI> attempted
the Chastity of some <HI>Spartan</HI> Virgins who were
there attending the Solemnity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of</HI> Teleclus.</NOTE> and kill'd <HI>Tele∣clus,</HI>
who interpos'd in their Defence. The
<HI>Messenians</HI> give it a quite different Turn, and
say it was a Plot of <HI>Teleclus</HI> to surprise them;
that they discover'd these Virgins to be young
Men thus disguis'd with Daggers under their
Cloaths, and therefore dispatch'd both them and
their Incendiary. 'Tis certain <HI>Tele∣clus</HI>
was kill'd in the Tumult; and what makes it look
like Treachery on the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> side, is,
that the Thing was presently hush'd up with∣out
endeavouring to revenge his Death: How∣ever
this was afterwards consider'd as one remote
<PB N="80" REF="109"/>
Cause of the <HI>Messenian</HI> War. <HI>Alcamenes</HI> was the
Successor <HI>Teleclus,</HI> and <HI>Nicander</HI> of <HI>Charilaus;</HI>
which latter kept on Foot his Father's Quarrel
with the <HI>Argives,</HI> and made successful Inroads
into their Country. It was also in the four
and thirtieth Year of his Reign, and the thirty
seventh of his Collegue, that the first <HI>Olympiad</HI>
was celebrated: Of which Institution we shall
speak more at large in the Story of <HI>Athens,</HI> and
only apply it here as a Date to the principal
Events.</P>
<P>To <HI>Nicander</HI> succeeded <HI>Theopompus;</HI> to whose
Reign may be referr'd another great Change
in the <HI>Spartan</HI> Government, by the Creation of the
<HI>Ephori;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Crea∣tion of the</HI> Ephori.</NOTE> which some assign to <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> as a
Part of his Settlement. But his Scheme had
too much of the <HI>Aristocracy</HI> in it to admit of
these Popular Magistrates:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. Olymp. 7. 4. 3255.</NOTE> And that he was
no Friend to <HI>Democracy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 7. 4.</NOTE> appears by the Answer
he made to one who was highly commending
that sort of Government, <HI>Go,</HI> says he, <HI>and set
it up first in your own House.</HI> So that it does
not appear by whom the <HI>Ephori</HI> were created,
or with what Design. But <HI>Theopompus</HI> him∣self
seems to have been consenting, or rather in∣strumental
in the Institution of this Office;
and 'tis said <HI>Elatus</HI> first exercis'd it by his Ap∣pointment.
However, he propos'd them as a
Curb to the Citizens: And being reproach'd by
by his Queen, that <HI>He would leave the Royal
Authority weaker than he found it,</HI> he told her,
<HI>He should leave it more lasting, and by Conse∣quence
more solid.</HI> Some will have 'em design'd
as Assistants, and others as a Bridle to the
Kings: But <HI>Lycurgus</HI> had left them so small a
Share of the Administration, that the <HI>Ephori</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="110"/>
could not be of much Use in either of these
Capacities. 'Tis most probable that the Se∣nate
had in the Course of an hundred Years ex∣tended
its Power, and bore too hard upon
the People; who not being satisfy'd with the
Change of obeying thirty Masters instead of
two, procur'd the Establishment of these
Officers, who were to represent things on their
Behalf, so as to cultivate and maintain a good
Understanding between them, and the Regen∣cy.
The Reason of assigning them so many
different Offices, is, because they were im∣ploy'd
as <HI>Inspectors,</HI> to inquire into the Conduct
both of the Magistracy, and the People. But
they were chiefly to protect the Liberties of
the People; who therefore chose them out of
their own Body, without Distinction of Birth,
or Fortune, it being a sufficient Qualification,
that they were bold, and popular, and averse to
arbitrary Proceedings. However moderate
their Power at first was, in Process of Time it
was so enlarg'd, that Affairs of the last Conse∣quence
pass'd through their Hands, all the Ma∣gistrates
in general, and the Kings themselves
being accountable to them. By which Means
they seem'd to have erected a sort of Tyranny,
which threaten'd greater Disorders, than those
they were design'd to remedy. But they had
also their Curbs: The Kings and they took a
mutual Oath every Month; the first in their
own Names, to rule according to the Laws, and
the latter in the Name of the People, to pre∣serve
their Authority to 'em safe and intire.
For which Reason the <HI>Ephori</HI> thought them∣selves
oblig'd in all pressing Conjunctures to
make the People agree to what had been before
<PB N="82" REF="111"/>
judg'd requisite for the common Interest. And
as there were five of them, (the first of which
was call'd <HI>Eponymns,</HI> upon the same Account as
the <HI>Archon</HI> at <HI>Athens</HI>) one was an Awe upon
another; and nothing could be done without
the Consent of the Whole, or at least of a Ma∣jority.
But the greatest Security to the State
was, that they were chosen annually. With
these Restrictions, they serv'd as a <HI>Cement</HI> to
join the several Orders of the State, and were
therefore call'd, <HI>The Nerves of the Common∣wealth.</HI>
The Balance was held for the most
part so equal, that the supream Authority did
not degenerate into Fierceness and Tyranny,
nor popular Liberty start out into Licencious∣ness
and Rebellion: And it is imputed to this
<HI>Medium</HI> betwixt an excessive Subjection, and
an excessive Freedom, that <HI>Sparta</HI> was so long
preserv'd from those domestick Dissentions,
which harass'd her Neighbours.</P>
<P>Whatever Concessions <HI>Theopompus</HI> had made
in Favour of the People, they were again re∣strain'd
by an Artifice of him, and his Col∣legue
<HI>Polydorus:</HI> Who perceiving they had got
Ground since the Death of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> and be∣gan
to make Giosses, and Interpretations of the
Laws, contrary to the true Sense and Intent of
them, inserted a Clause into the <HI>Rhetra,</HI> and
made it pass for Authentick, <HI>That if the People
should go about to make any Alterations in the
Decrees of the Senate, by perverting the Sense of
them, or otherwise, it should be lawful for the
Kings to make void their Proceedings, and dissolve
the Assembly.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="112"/>
V. It was also in <HI>Theopompus</HI> his Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Grounds of the first</HI> Messenian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE>
that the first <HI>Messenian</HI> War broke out; to
which the Death of <HI>Teleclus,</HI> and several other
Things contributed: But it was chiefly groun∣ded
on an old hereditary Pique between the
two Nations, ever since the Division of their
Territories made by the <HI>Heraclidae.</HI> For the
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> had often complain'd, that <HI>Cres∣phontes,</HI>
Uncle to <HI>Eurysthenes,</HI> got <HI>Messenia</HI> by a
Stratagem; which being the best Country,
they thought they had too much Merit on their
Side, to leave them in a quiet Possession.
There being so much Rancour and Ambition
at the bottom, every trivial Accident serv'd to
widen the Breach, 'till it came to an open Rup∣ture.
Such was that which is recorded as the
more immediate Cause of this War. <HI>Poly∣chares</HI>
a <HI>Messenian</HI> who had won the Prize in
the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games, let out some Cows to Pa∣sture
to <HI>Euaephnus</HI> a <HI>Lacedaemonian,</HI> who was
to pay himself for their keeping with a Share
of the Encrease. <HI>Euaephnus</HI> sold the Cows, pre∣tending
they were stole from him: And being
afterwards found out, kill'd <HI>Polychares</HI>'s Son,
who was sent to demand the Mony for 'em.
<HI>Polychares</HI> had often made his Complaint at
<HI>Sparta,</HI> and demanded Justice; 'till finding he
was still put off without any Hopes of Redress, he
grew so incens'd, that he kill'd all the <HI>Lacedaemo∣nians</HI>
he could lay his Hands on. Then the <HI>Lace∣daemonians</HI>
their Turn remonstrated at, <HI>Messenein</HI>
and demanded <HI>Polychares;</HI> who not being given
up, it became a national Quarrel: Tho' it still
look'd fairest on the <HI>Messenians</HI> Side, who of∣fer'd
to refer it either to the <HI>Argives</HI> as their
common Kinsmen, or to the <HI>Amphictyones,</HI> or
<PB N="84" REF="113"/>
else to the Senate of <HI>Areopagus.</HI> To have it
made up, was not what the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> pro∣pos'd;
however they kept the Business in Su∣spence,
by returning no Answer; and in the mean
time made secret Provisions for the War, ob∣liging
themselves by Oath not to return 'till
they had subdu'd <HI>Messenia.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly in the second Year of the ninth
<HI>Olympiad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It broke out.</NOTE> they set out by Night under the
Conduct of <HI>Alcamenes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3361</NOTE> and without any Decla∣ration
of War surpriz'd <HI>Amphea,</HI> a Frontier
Town of great Importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 9. 2.</NOTE> wherein they put
all to the Sword; and having left a Guard in
it as a Place of Retreat, made further Incurs∣ions,
plundering and ravaging the Country to
subsist their Men. The <HI>Messenians,</HI> finding
themselves not in a Condition to oppose them,
contented themselves with some small Reprisals
upon the Coasts of <HI>Laconia.</HI> But after four
Years they were sufficiently rous'd, and prepar'd
for them; and <HI>Euphaes</HI> their King drew his
Army down to the Borders to offer 'em Battel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Battel fought with equal Suc∣cess.</NOTE>
which the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> accepted, and fought
upon equal Terms 'till they were parted by the
Night: And the next Day finding the greatest
Part of the <HI>Messenian</HI> Army strongly intrench'd,
and themselves not in a Condition to force their
Camp, return'd home.</P>
<P>But being upbraided by their Countrymen
with the Violation of their Oath, they went
again the next Year to make their utmost Efforts
under the Conduct of both the Kings, <HI>Theo∣pompus,</HI>
and <HI>Polydorus</HI> the Son of <HI>Alcamenes,</HI>
now dead. They found their Enemy ready
to receive 'em; and a Battel ensu'd, wherein
the Advantage which the <HI>Spartans</HI> had as well
<PB N="85" REF="114"/>
in Numbers as Discipline, was so well supply'd
by the desperate Valour of the <HI>Messenians,</HI>
that things were again upon a pretty equal Foot. In
the Right Wing <HI>Euphaes</HI> put <HI>Theopompus</HI> to
Flight, and in the Left <HI>Polydorus</HI> had the bet∣ter;
But the Main Body maintain'd the Con∣flict
so long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A second with the same Suc∣cess</NOTE> and so doubtfully, that both Par∣ties
at last gave off as it were by Consent, and
neither claim'd the Victory. The next Day
they bury'd their Dead, and did not care to
put it to a second Trial: So that if the <HI>Lace∣daemonians</HI>
had any Advantage, they were too
much disorder'd themselves to pursue it, espe∣cially
in an Enemies Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Messenians</HI> now began to labour under
the usual Inconveniences of having their Coun∣try
the Seat of the War. This occasion'd great
Scarcity of Mony and Provisions, and Deser∣tion
to the Enemy; to add to which, there
was a Mortality among them. So that being
oblig'd to evacuate most of their straggling
Towns, they retir'd into <HI>Ithome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mes∣senians re∣tire into Ithome.</NOTE> a Town strong∣ly
situated upon an high Mountain, and forti∣fy'd
it so as to secure 'em against any sudden
Attempt. This Retreat gave 'em Respite for
some Years: And in that Time they sent to
<HI>Delphi,</HI> to know the further Event of the War.
The Oracle demanded a Virgin for a Sacrifice
of the Family of <HI>Aepytus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Cres∣phontes;</HI>
and the Lot fell upon the Daughter
of <HI>Lyciscus;</HI> who being thought to be suppositi∣tious,
<HI>Aristodemus</HI> offer'd his Daughter. A
young Man in Love with her, endeavour'd to
save her, by alledging she was with Child by
him: But her Father was so enrag'd, that he
ripp'd up her Belly with his own Hand, and
<PB N="86" REF="115"/>
publickly vindicated her Innocence. The
Priest would not allow of this as a just Sacri∣fice,
'till <HI>Euphaes</HI> oppos'd him, saying, <HI>It was
no Matter how, or by whom she was kill'd, and
that the Oracle requir'd no more Blood.</HI> Some
Years after <HI>Lyciscus</HI> who had fled to <HI>Sparta</HI>
with his Daughter, where she dy'd, was ta∣ken,
and try'd at <HI>Ithome</HI> as a Deserter; but
was acquitted by the voluntary Confession of
the Priestess of <HI>Juno</HI>'s Temple, who own'd the
Child to be hers, and that she had secretly con∣vey'd
it to <HI>Lyciscus</HI>'s Wife: Wherein she was
easily credited, because by this Confession she
could propose nothing less than the immediate
Forfeiture of her Priesthood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> being now inur'd to A∣ction,
took this Opportunity of a Cessation
with the Messnians, to renew their old Con∣test
with the <HI>Argives,</HI> about <HI>Thyrea</HI> situate in
the Confines, and claim'd by both. But the
Matter being referr'd to the <HI>Amphictyones,</HI> they
order'd 'em to dismiss their Armies, and de∣cide
it with three hundred Men of a Side.
Of the <HI>Argives,</HI> there were but two who sur∣viv'd
the Conflict; and of the <HI>Lacedaemonian,</HI> only <HI>Othryades;</HI>
who yet liv'd no longer, than
to erect a Trophy of the Enemies Shields, and
make an Inscription on it with his own Blood:
for whose Sake the Town was adjug'd to the
<HI>Lacedaemonian.</HI> The <HI>Argives,</HI> thinking they
had not Justice done 'em, kept their Pretensi∣ons
on Foot, and (as <HI>Herodotus</HI> says) engag'd
afresh, and were worsted: But he seems to
have mistaken this for another Battel, which
happen'd fome considerable Time after.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="116"/>
But the Quarrel being adjusted for the pre∣sent, the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> turn'd their Arms a∣gain
upon the <HI>Messenians:</HI> And eight Years af∣ter
the Removal to <HI>Ithome</HI> there happen'd a∣nother
sharp Engagement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A third Engage∣ment.</NOTE> which continu'd 'till
Night, with the same doubtful Success as be∣fore,
except that <HI>Euphaes</HI> venturing too far a∣gainst
<HI>Theopompus,</HI> was almost taken by his
Party, but rescu'd, and carry'd into his Tent,
where in a few Days he dy'd of his Wounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euphaes <HI>the</HI> Messe∣nian <HI>King mortally wounded.</HI></NOTE>
He, leaving no Children, was succeeded by <HI>A∣rilstodemas,</HI>
as the most popular Pretender. He
immediately form'd a Confederacy with the
<HI>Argives, Arcadians,</HI> and <HI>Sicyonians;</HI> and the
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> had some Assistance from <HI>Co∣rinth.</HI>
Yet nothing happen'd for five Years, but Incursions into one another's Territories;
which at last ended in a fourth general Engage∣ment
of both Parties with their Allies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fourth general En∣gagement.</NOTE> where∣in
the <HI>Messenians,</HI> being inferior in Number,
had posted themselves with their Backs to <HI>I∣thome,</HI>
to secure a Retreat: And a Party which
lay in Ambush, pouring in upon the <HI>Lacedae∣monians</HI>
in the heat of the Action, gall'd them
so in their Flank, that after a very warm Dif∣pute,
many of them were kill'd, and the rest
put to flight.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> having in this Battel lost
the Flower of their Army, despair'd of doing
any thing by dint of fighting, and therefore
had Recourse to Wiles and Stratagems; and the
rather, because the Oracle told 'em, that as
<HI>Messenia</HI> was at first obtain'd by an Artifice, so
it was to be recover'd. But the Cunning and
Vigilance of <HI>Aristodemus</HI> defeated all their De∣signs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ithome <HI>besieg'd.</HI></NOTE>
'till at last the Siege of <HI>Ithome</HI> gave a
<PB N="88" REF="117"/>
sudden Turn to their Affairs. Whilst the <HI>Messe∣nians</HI>
were by this Means closely block'd up, and
cut off from all manner of Provisions, <HI>Aristode∣mus</HI>
was so stung with Remorse, for that he
had sacrific'd his Child for his Country's Good,
and yet could not obtain it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristode∣mus <HI>kills himself.</HI></NOTE> that he kill'd him∣self
at her Grave. He had done all that was
possible to preserve his sinking Country; and
it was no Objection to his Merit, that he had
not Fortune in his Power. With him fell the
<HI>Messenian</HI> Kingdom: And the Loss of him so
heighten'd the Despair of his Subjects, that
they thought of nothing but throwing them∣selves
at their Enemies Mercy. And tho' up∣on
second Thoughts they propos'd to make a
Sally, and fight it out to the last Man, yet
their Hearts fail'd them, and they chose rather
to submit to Hunger, and many other pressing
Necessities, for five Months. After which, be∣ing
able to subsist no longer, they yielded up∣on
such Terms, as the Conquerors pleas'd to
impose on them; one chief Article being, that
they should till their Ground, and send half
the Encrease to <HI>Sparta. Ithome</HI> was demolish∣ed,
and the rest of the Towns submitted; tho'
some of the Inhabitants fled to their Neigh∣bours,
who had been assisting to them in the
War, rather than they would live at Home in
a Condition little better than that of Slaves to
<HI>Sparta.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the first Messenian War.</NOTE> Thus ended the first <HI>Messenian</HI> War,

not to return 'till their Designs were ac∣complish'd,
the Women in the mean while re∣monstrated
to them, that their Posterity would
fail, whilst they spent thus upon the quick
Stock, and took no care for a Recruit. To
remedy which Inconvenience, they detach'd
fifty of the likeliest young Fellows in the Ar∣my,
to go to <HI>Sparta,</HI> and lye promiscuously with
all the young Women they fancy'd. The
Off-spring of these Virgins were from them

Village, where the <HI>Messe∣nians</HI>
thought it sufficient, that they lost no

Valour of <HI>Aristomenes;</HI> who being of the
Line of Aepytus, they would have chose him
King, which Title he declin'd for that of Ge∣neral;
and as such he commanded with full
Power. In the mean while the Oracle at <HI>Del∣phi</HI>
being consulted by the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> they
were advis'd to apply themselves to <HI>Athens,</HI>
for one to preside over their Affairs in the
Nature of a Counsellor. The <HI>Athenians</HI> were
very jealous of their getting too great a foot∣ing
in <HI>Peloponnesus:</HI> But to shew some kind of
Obedience to the Oracle, and some Sense of
the Honour done to their City, they sent <HI>Tyr∣taeus,</HI>
a lame, crack-brain'd Poet and School-Master,
whose chief Business was to Harangue,
and repeat Verses. How great soever this Man
might be in other Respects, he made a very
ridiculous Figure in the Army, and seems ra∣ther
to have been sent in Contempt of the <HI>Spar∣tans,</HI>
who nevertheless were glad to receive
him; for looking upon him as the <HI>Messenger
of the Fates,</HI> they desir'd no other Qualifica∣tion,
than his being lent them by the <HI>Atheni∣ans.</HI>
The next Year, at a Place call'd the <HI>Boar</HI>'s-<HI>Monument,</HI>
happen'd another long and obstinate
Fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The second at the</HI> Boar'<HI>s</HI>-Monu∣ment. Olymp. 24. 2.</NOTE> wherein both Parties had their old Al∣lies.
<HI>Aristomenes</HI> at last routed the <HI>Lacedaemo∣nians;</HI>
but losing his Shield in the Pursuit,
gave them an Opportunity of escaping. Upon
this Success he began to Act offensively; and
making Incursions into <HI>Laconia,</HI> took a Town
<PB N="91" REF="120"/>
call'd <HI>Pharae,</HI> and plunder'd it; then routed <HI>A∣naxander,</HI>

from that Attempt by a fancy'd Apparition of

<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> however were so dispi∣rited,
that they had Thoughts of clapping up
a Peace. To prevent which, <HI>Tyrtaetus</HI> now ex∣erted
all his Power of Insinuation; and by his
continual Lectures of Honour and Courage,
deliver'd in moving Verse to the Army, ani∣mated
them to such a degree, that they resol∣ved
upon another Attack. With this Design
they recruited their Army with the <HI>Helots,</HI>
promising them the Widows of those that

Hand upon his Mouth to secure himself, and
with the other caught him fast hold by the
Tail; upon which the Beast made directly to
his Hole, and conducted him, 'till the Way
being too narrow for 'em both, he let the Fox
go, and following the Tract with his Eye, per∣ceiv'd
a little Glimmering from above, and
work'd himself out.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His mirae∣culous E∣scaepe.</NOTE> After this miraculous,
and almost incredible Escape, he repair'd im∣mediately
to <HI>Eira,</HI> where in a Sally by Night
he fell upon the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Forces, kill'd the
Captains, and plunder'd their Tents. He was
after this taken by force <HI>Cretans,</HI> who also assisted
in the Siege: But his Keepers being
made drunk, he stabb'd 'em with their own
Daggers, and return'd to his Company.</P>
<P>The Siege in the mean while was very little
advanc'd: But it happen'd the eleventh Year
after the taking of <HI>Aristomenes,</HI> in a very dark
rainy Night, that the Centinels thinking all
safe, deserted their Posts; which the Enemy
having Notice of by a <HI>Spartan,</HI> who had an
Intrigue with a <HI>Messenian</HI> Woman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eira <HI>tak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI></NOTE> rush'd in im∣mediately
upon them, and surpriz'd the Castle.
The Besieg'd took the Alarm, and maintain'd
an obstinate Fight all the next Day: But be∣ing
at last press'd with Numbers, <HI>Aristomenes</HI>
chose rather to quit the Place upon such ho∣nourable
<PB N="93" REF="122"/>
Terms, than sacrifice the last Re∣mains
of his Army. The <HI>Arcadians</HI> were so
far from abandoning their old Friends in this
Extremity, that they went out to meet them
with Provisions, and make them an Offer of
settling among 'em. But <HI>Aristomenes,</HI> who
could not yet resolve with himself to give up all
for lost, pick'd out a Body of five hundred,
whom he thought least desirous to survive their
Country's Ruin, and ask'd 'em, <HI>If they would
once more venture their Lives with him.</HI> Upon
their Answer, <HI>That they would,</HI> he broke his
Designs to 'em of going to surprize <HI>Sparta,</HI>
whilst its chief Strength was employ'd in the
Plunder of <HI>Messenia,</HI> telling 'em, <HI>That Success
would put Things again upon an equal Foot; and
that the worst that could happen, was an honou∣rable
Death.</HI> Three hundred <HI>Arcadians</HI> join'd

<HI>Anaxander;</HI> for which a Letter of Thanks was
return'd both for his timely Notice in this Af∣fair,
and for his past Service in the Battel of
the <HI>Ditch.</HI> This Letter being intercepted, his
whole Treachery was laid open; upon which
his own Subjects stoned him to Death, and
erected a Pillar to perpetuate his Infamy. How∣ever
this Disappointment after the taking of
<HI>Eira,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The End of the second</HI> Messenian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> put an End to the second <HI>Messenian</HI>
War, which had continu'd almost eighteen

with doubtful Success most part of the Time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE>
Whatever Service <HI>Tyrtaeus</HI> had done in this War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3336</NOTE>
the <HI>Lacedaemonians:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 28. 1.</NOTE> were not ungrateful; and as
<PB N="94" REF="123"/>
one part of his Reward they made him Free
of their City: Upon which occasion, <HI>Pausani∣as,</HI>
the Son of <HI>Cleombrotus,</HI> being afterwards
ask'd, <HI>How the</HI> Spartans <HI>came to do him this
Honour,</HI> he answer'd, <HI>Because they would not be
thought ever to have made use of a Foreign Gene∣ral.</HI>
But it may be more to his Advantage to
consider him as a Man of Letters, than of Arms;
for 'tis certain his Poetry bears the first Place
in his Character. His Works were the Polity
of the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> Moral Precepts in Ele∣giack
Verse, and five Books of War Verses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Messenians</HI> were very desirous to settle
themselves in other Parts, under the Conduct of
<HI>Aristomenes:</HI> But he committed them to the
Care of his Sons; and throwing himself among
a Body of <HI>Spartans</HI> near <HI>Eira,</HI> was kill'd; tho'
others say, that being a sworn Enemy to <HI>Spar∣ta,</HI>
he continu'd several Years in those Parts, in
hopes of an Opportunity to revenge himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of</HI> Aristo∣menes.</NOTE>
and at last dy'd in <HI>Rhodes,</HI> where he had mar-ry'd
a Daughter. However, it is certain he liv'd and dy'd with the Reputation of as
much personal Bravery, and Love of his Coun∣try,
as any Man at that time in <HI>Greece.</HI> He
had thrice in this War perform'd the <HI>Hecatom∣phonia,</HI>
a Sacrifice due to those who in the
Battel had kill'd an hundred of the Enemy with
their own Hands. The <HI>Spartans</HI> conceiv'd such
a Dread of him, that even after <HI>Eira</HI> was taken,
they were glad to open a Passage for him, and
he march'd out rather as a Conqueror, than like
one who was making his Escape. Whilst the
<HI>Messenians</HI> were considering how to dispose
of themselves, they were invited by <HI>Anaxilas,</HI>
Prince of <HI>Rhegium,</HI> whose Ancestors were
<PB N="95" REF="124"/>
<HI>Messenians,</HI> and had seated themselves in <HI>Italy</HI>
upon their Defeat in the first <HI>Messenian</HI> War.
He told them, he was at War with the <HI>Zanclae∣ans,</HI>
a People of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and that if they would
assist him in subduing them, he would deliver
the Town into their Hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Messe∣nians <HI>seated in</HI> Sicily.</NOTE> Accordingly he
transported 'em into <HI>Sicily,</HI> where being possess'd
of <HI>Zancle,</HI> they incorporated themselves with
the Inhabitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> because they were also originally
<HI>Grecians;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3340.</NOTE> but destroying the old Town,
built a new one about a Mile distant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 29. 1.</NOTE> and gave
it the Name of <HI>Messene,</HI> which it still retains,
<HI>Greece</HI> was at this time so well peopled, that it
was common upon any little Pique, or ill Suc∣cess
in a Battel, to throw themselves out in Co∣lonies;
which by this means were planted not
only in <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> but several other Parts
of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> But to avoid Tedious∣ness
and Repetition, we than mention the chief
of 'em in their proper Places, and return to the
<HI>Messenians;</HI> many of whom, through Age or
Poverty, were still left at home, and inroll'd
among the <HI>Spartan Helots;</HI> and it seems chiefly
upon their Account, that these Slaves met with
such severe Treatment. For they were apt to
rebel, and struggle with their Chains; but were
forc'd to bear 'em above two hundred Years.
And it is strange, that all that time, an ensla∣ved,
banished, and dispersed Nation should re∣tain
their Name, Customs, and Language, with
their Hatred to <HI>Sparta,</HI> and Love of their Coun∣try,
and at last meet with an Opportunity of
returning to it, and being throughly re-insta∣ted.</P>

<P>During which time <HI>Corinth</HI> began to exert its

of <HI>Syracuse</HI> and <HI>Corcyra;</HI> the first under the

soon grew to be not only the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Si∣cily,</HI>
but the largest and most beautiful City
of all <HI>Greece.</HI> And <HI>Corcyra</HI> a having the same Ad∣vantages
by Sea, grew so considerable, as to
found two other Cities in <HI>Illyricum, Epidamnus</HI>
and <HI>Apollonia.</HI> These Colonies were at first subject
to <HI>Corinth</HI> their <HI>Metropolis,</HI> and were govern'd
much after the same Manner; but as they increas'd
in Power, they renounc'd their Obedience, and
thereby gave Occasion to such Commotions, as
will furnish out a considerable Part of the <HI>Gre∣cian</HI>
Story.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hidae,</HI> to secure the Government to

being lame and deform'd, was rejected by 'em,
and marry'd to <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion;</HI> who (as <HI>Herodotus</HI> tells
the Story) for want of Children went to con∣sult
the Oracle at <HI>Delphi,</HI> and was answer'd, <HI>He
should have a Son by her, that would fall like a
Stone upon the</HI> Oligarchy, <HI>and by that means dissolving
it, should reform the State.</HI> This alarm'd
the <HI>Bacchidae,</HI> especially as it served to confirm
an Oracle they had receiv'd before to the same
Purpose, tho' in more ambiguous Terms. And
therefore when the Woman was delivered, they
sent ten of their Members to destroy the In∣fant;
which smiling in their Faces affected 'em
so, that they agreed to deliver it back to the
Mother. They were no sooner gone, but they
repented of their Companssion, and returned to
the Mother; who in the mean while, being
better inform'd of their Errand, had hid the
Child under a <HI>Bushel,</HI> or some such sort of
Corn Measure, from which he afterwards had
the Name of <HI>Cypselus.</HI> Thus were they again
defeated; and that which secur'd the Boy af∣terwards,
was their giving out, that they had
executed their Commission.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Cypselus</HI> being of Age, thought it time
to fulfil the Oracle; and was encourag'd by
another, which told him positively he should
Reign in <HI>Corinth,</HI> but restrain'd the Succession
to him, and his Children, thereby excluding
the third Generation. To compass his De∣signs
he first made use of soft insinuating Me∣thods
to cajole the People out of their Liberty,
and having by this means lull'd them asleep,
he practis'd upon them with the greater Secu∣rity.
<PB N="101" REF="130"/>
His first necessary Step was to remove
the <HI>Bacchidae</HI> at some distance from him: In
order to which he prevail'd with them to go
in a Body, to consult the Oracle about the
Publick Safety. They were no sooner gone,
but he took upon him to forbid their Return
by an express Edict;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cypselus <HI>usurps the Govern∣ment.</HI></NOTE> and in the mean while
usurp'd the Government; tho' it is thought he
could not have effected so sudden a Change
with so little Opposition, if the Luxury and
Supineness of the <HI>Bacchidae</HI> themselves had not
in a great measure contributed to it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> In the
Beginning of his Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3349.</NOTE> which is plac'd under
the thirty first <HI>Olympiad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 31. 2.</NOTE> he cut off all Obstru∣ctions
to his Power, sparing neither the Estates
nor Lives of those, whom he thought any
ways obnoxious. It was in these Troubles, that
<HI>Demaratus,</HI> an eminent Man amongst the <HI>Bac∣chidae,</HI>
and a rich Merchant, fled into <HI>Italy,</HI> and
settled in <HI>Hetruria;</HI> where of a Woman of that
Country he had two Sons, <HI>Aruns</HI> and <HI>Lucumon;</HI>
the latter of which was afterwards King of
<HI>Rome,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Tarquinius Priscus.</HI> As,
to <HI>Cypselus,</HI> whatever Acts of Injustice his Am∣bition
prompted him to, they seem to have
proceeded rather from Necessity than Nature,
because when he was throughly establish'd in
the Throne, he grew very mild and indulgent,
and plac'd such an intire Confidence in the Love
of his Subjects, that he would not in all his
Reign have any Guard about him; which was
look'd upon as an extraordinary Instance, in
one who had the Name of a Tyrant and U∣surper.
By these Methods he enjoy'd the
Crown thirty Years, and when he dy'd, left it
to his Son <HI>Periander.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="131"/>
He was quite the Reverse of his Father;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Periander. Olym. 38. 4</NOTE>
which some attribute to his Temper, and o∣thers
to his Acquaintance with <HI>Thrasybulus</HI> the
Tyrant of <HI>Miletus:</HI> To whom sending for his
Advice about the Management of the State,
he took the Messenger out into a Corn-field,
and having struck off all the Ears, that were shot
up above the rest, sent him back without any
Answer. <HI>Periander</HI> soon took the Hint, by ta∣king
off the most eminent of the Citizens;
which secured him in the Kingdom, but with
the Character of a savage and inflexible Ty∣rant.
There are other gross Enormities recor∣ded
of him, as his committing Incest with his
Mother; his killing his Wife big with Child at
the Instigation of his Whores, and lying with
her when dead. By which Acts he knew he
had forfeited the good Will of his Subjects,
and therefore would not trust himself without
a constant Guard of three hundred Men. He
had two Sons, whereof <HI>Cypselus</HI> the eldest was
a meer Natural; and the youngest called <HI>Lyco∣phron</HI>
he sent into <HI>Corcyra,</HI> for resenting his Mo∣ther's
ill Treatment. However being grown old
and infirm, he sent for him again, to settle him
in the Tyranny, and offer'd to change Govern∣ments
with him: But the <HI>Corcyraeans,</HI> to pre∣vent
his coming among them, killed the young
Prince; which, 'tis thought, occasion'd also the
Father's Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 48. 4</NOTE> after he had liv'd eighty Years,
and reign'd forty. The greatest Honour paid to
his Memory, is the ranking him among the <HI>Se∣ven
Sages</HI> of <HI>Greece.</HI> But he obtain'd this Ti∣tle
chiefly by insinuating himself into the
Company of all the wise and virtuous Men of
his Time; so that it seems to have been more
<PB N="103" REF="132"/>
the Effect of his Ambition, than his Merit:
For he has given so few Instances of his Wis∣dom,
to support his Pretensions, that some have
excluded him out of the Number, and plac'd
<HI>Myson</HI> in his Room. The State suffer'd such
Convulsions under his Tyranny, that tho' up∣on
his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psammeti∣chus <HI>the last King.</HI></NOTE> the Crown devolv'd to <HI>Psamme∣tichus</HI>
the Son of <HI>Gordias,</HI> his Brother or Kins∣man,

into a settled Common-wealth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3422.</NOTE> with a
greater Share of Liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 49. 3</NOTE> than they enjoy'd un∣der

<P>It is certain the <HI>Corinthians</HI> express'd a parti∣cular

several Wars, rather as the common Asserters
of Liberty, than out of any ambitious Designs;
tho' they might with the same Ease have en∣larg'd
their own Territories, as defended others.
They had such Temptations to give Law to
their Neighbours, as no State in <HI>Greece</HI> had be∣side
themselves, from the Convenience of their
Shipping, and their Situation in the <HI>Isthmus,</HI>

sufficiently attested, we are to consider <HI>Cad∣mus,</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="134"/>
without any Relation to the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cadmus <HI>the first King of</HI> Thebes.</NOTE> as the
first King of <HI>Baeotia,</HI> and conclude, that he foun∣ded,
or at least re-built the City, calling it <HI>Thebes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE>
from the City of that Name in <HI>Ae∣gypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2555.</NOTE>
and the Castle, <HI>Cadmea.</HI> He is generally
reputed the Son of <HI>Agenor</HI> Brother of <HI>Belus,
Danaus</HI>'s Father: So that from his Family, and
several other Circumstances, it might be interr'd
he was originally an <HI>Aegyptian,</HI> tho' he is trac'd
more immediately from <HI>Phanicia,</HI> where he was
settled for some time, and which took its Name
from his Brother <HI>Phaenix.</HI> There is another
probable Conjecture, that he was of the Fami∣ly
of the <HI>Cadmonites</HI> mention'd by <HI>Moses,</HI> who
were the same with the <HI>Hivites:</HI> And his Time
falling in with that of <HI>Joshua,</HI> seems to con∣firm
his leading into <HI>Greece</HI> a Colony of those
<HI>Canaanites,</HI> or <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> who were expell'd
by the <HI>Israelites.</HI> At least this looks more plau∣sible,
than the Account the Poets give of his
Travels, in Search of his Sister <HI>Europa,</HI> who
probably was stole by <HI>Taurus</HI> King of <HI>Crete;</HI>
which occasion'd the Fable of her being carry'd
away by a <HI>Bull.</HI> The Opinion which seems
to come nearest to the Truth in this case, is,
that he went with a Design to erect a Kingdom,
and plant a Colony of <HI>Phaenicians</HI> in <HI>Europe;</HI>
making the Recovery of his Sister only a Pre∣tence
for his Wandering, 'till he could fix up∣on
a Place for his Purpose. To <HI>Cadmus</HI> are
ascrib'd sixteen Letters of the <HI>Greek.</HI> Alphabet;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Letters brought in∣to</HI> Greece.</NOTE>
which that he brought with him, appears from
their Order, Names, and Character, all which
bear a near Resemblance to the old <HI>Phoenician,</HI>
or <HI>Hebrew</HI> Letters. So that he was not pro∣perly
the Inventor, as he is call'd; but only
<PB N="106" REF="135"/>
form'd them from his own Language, as 'tis
probable the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> had before form'd
theirs from the <HI>Aegyptian.</HI> For to <HI>Aegypt</HI> is
chiefly owing the Original of most Kinds of
Arts, and Religious Rites, which were propa∣gated
in <HI>Europe:</HI> But as the Convenience of
Ports and Shipping, gave the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> the
most early Opportunities of dispersing them,
for this Reason they often ran away with the
Honour of Invention. <HI>Cadmus</HI> being thus set∣tled,
whether he afterwards subdu'd the <HI>Illy∣rians,</HI>
and reign'd there, or whether he died at
<HI>Thebes,</HI> 'tis certain he left the Kingdom to his
Son <HI>Polydorus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Polydorus.</NOTE></P>
<P>He had by the Daughter of <HI>Nycteus</HI> a Son
call'd <HI>Labdacus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Labdacus.</NOTE> whom being under Age at his
Death, he left to the Care of his Father-in-Law.
<HI>Nycteus</HI>'s other Daughter <HI>Antiope</HI> was
stole; upon which he engag'd in a Quarrel
with the <HI>Sicyonians,</HI> and was kill'd. At his
Death he assign'd over his Charge of the young
King to his Brother <HI>Lycus,</HI> who executed it
so faithfully, that <HI>Labdacus</HI> also dying soon af∣ter
he was of Age, committed his Infant-Son
<HI>Laius</HI> to his Protection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laius.</NOTE> <HI>Lycus</HI> prosecuting
his Brother's Quarrel with the <HI>Sicyonians,</HI> got
his Niece <HI>Antiope</HI> into his Hands: Upon
which her two Sons, <HI>Amphion</HI> and <HI>Zethus,</HI>
march'd against <HI>Thebes,</HI> in order to revenge
their Mother's ill Treatment. <HI>Lycus</HI> was kill'd
in the Battel, the City taken, and the young
King being privately convey'd away, the Bro∣thers
possess'd the Kingdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amphion <HI>and</HI> Ze∣thus.</NOTE> This <HI>Amphion</HI> is he,
who is said to have built the Walls of
<HI>Thebes</HI> by his Harmony. 'Tis probable he
might fortifie it, to defend his Title: But
<PB N="107" REF="136"/>
the proper Meaning is, that by the Force of
Oratory, he work'd upon a rude illiterate Peo∣ple
to confirm him in his Usurpation: And
this Interpretation is in a great measure appli∣cable
to most of the famous Musicians of the
first Ages. But the Families of <HI>Amphion</HI> and
<HI>Zethus,</HI> by Pestilence, and other Casualties, in
a few Years became extinct; and the <HI>Thebans</HI>
restor'd the Kingdom to <HI>Laius.</HI> He marry'd
<HI>Jocasta,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Menaeceus,</HI> and had
by her a Son, by whom, the Oracle told him,
he should be kill'd. To prevent which, he
expos'd the Child in the Woods, having first
bor'd Holes in his Feet to fetter him, which
occasion'd such a Swelling, that from thence
he afterwards had the Name of <HI>Oedipus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oedipus.</NOTE> be∣ing
preserv'd by the Shepherds, and brought
up at <HI>Corinth.</HI> When he was grown up, he
had a mind to inform himself concerning his
Parentage; and it happen'd, that <HI>Laius</HI> was no
less inquisitive to know what was become of
his Son. Accordingly they set out at the
same time to consult the Oracle, and met in
<HI>Phocis;</HI> where upon disputing the Way, or
some such trivial Quarrel, <HI>Laius</HI> was kill'd
by his Son <HI>Oedipus,</HI> neither of 'em having the
least Knowledge of the other.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of <HI>Laius,</HI> the Throne was
usurp'd by <HI>Creon, Jocasta</HI>'s Brother, 'till ano∣ther
Accident made way for <HI>Oedipus,</HI> which
was his explaining the Riddle of the Monster
<HI>Sphinx.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mon∣ster</HI> Sphinx.</NOTE> What this Creature was, is of more
Difficulty, than Importance to determine, be∣ing
by some thought a notorious Robber, by
<HI>Pausanias,</HI> a Bastard-Daughter of <HI>Laius,</HI> and
by others preferr'd for her Wisdom, to examine
<PB N="108" REF="137"/>
Pretenders to the Crown, and to punish
those with Death, who could not make out their
Claim. The Parts, and Qualities of several
Creatures are employ'd by the Poets in her Description;
and by the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> she is made
an <HI>Hieroglyphick</HI> of Wisdom, and Strength. The
<HI>Aenigma,</HI> propos'd, was to tell, <HI>What it was,
that went in the Morning upon four Legs, at
at Noon upon two, and at Night upon three.
Oedipus</HI> interpreted it, <HI>Of a Man, who in his
Infancy crawls upon his Hands and Feet; in his
Maturity goes upright upon his Legs; and in his
old Age uses a Staff.</HI> Upon which Solution,
according to Agreement he marry'd <HI>Jocasta,</HI>
and obtain'd the Kingdom, being still in a profound
Ignorance of what he had done. But at
last the whole Mystery was disclos'd, that he
had kill'd his Father, and marry'd his Mother:
Whereupon she immediately hang'd her self,
and he tore out his Eyes with Distraction, or
rather spent the sad Remainder of his Life in
Exile, or a very close Retirement.</P>
<P>But the Death of <HI>Oedipus</HI> was far from put∣ting
an End to the Miseries of his Family. He
left two Son, <HI>Eteocles,</HI> and <HI>Polynices,</HI> and as
many Daughters, all by <HI>Jocasta,</HI> as <HI>Diodorus</HI>
affirms against the Opinion of others, who as∣sign
the Daughters another Mother.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Et<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocles <HI>and</HI> Polyni∣ces.</NOTE> The two
Brothers disputed the Succession, and agreed to
govern by Turns. The first Year was allotted
to <HI>Eteocles</HI> as Eldest; which being expir'd, he
would not resign: Whereupon <HI>Polynices</HI> ap∣ply'd
himself to <HI>Adrastus</HI> King of <HI>Argos,</HI> whose
Daughter he had marry'd. <HI>Adrastus</HI> espous'd
the Quarrel; and there being with him <HI>Tydeus,</HI>
the Father of <HI>Diomedes,</HI> who had also marry'd
<PB N="109" REF="138"/>
another of his Daughters, and fled to him for
Refuge, he promis'd to re-instate them both;
and first dispatch'd <HI>Tydeus</HI> to <HI>Thebes</HI> to remon∣strate
in behalf of <HI>Polynices. Eteocles</HI> intercepted
his Journey by an Ambush of fifty Men,
whom he defeated, and return'd to <HI>Argos.</HI></P>
<P>II.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> The∣ban <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> Hereupon War was immediately declar'd;
and seven famous Captains undertook an Expe∣dition
against <HI>Thebes; Adrastus, Polynices,</HI> and
<HI>Tydeus,</HI> who were more immediately concern'd,
being join'd by <HI>Amphiaraus, Capaneus Hippo∣medon,</HI>
and <HI>Parthenopaeus.</HI> This War is the first
of any Moment, that happen'd in <HI>Greece,</HI> being
about thirty Years before that of <HI>Troy;</HI> and is
look'd upon but as a Prelude to it. Tho' as it
has employ'd the Wits of many ancient Poets,
and <HI>Antimachus</HI> particularly in <HI>Plato</HI>'s Time
publish'd twenty four Books only of the Prepa∣rations
of this Siege, it seems to have made a
greater Noise in the World, than through such
a vast Distance of Time we are sensible of.
The Army was chiefly rais'd by <HI>Adrastus;</HI>
but the other Confederates brought in their Quota's,
and the chief Command was assign'd
to <HI>Amphiaraus,</HI> who had marry'd <HI>Adrastus</HI>'s
Sister.</P>
<P>In this Infancy of War, we have no warran∣table
Accounts of any thing like a regular Siege.
But the Captains being arriv'd at <HI>Thebes,</HI> di∣spos'd
themselves with the Companies under
their Command to attack the seven Gates of the
City: Which being guarded by as many Offi∣cers
within, the <HI>Thebans</HI> made a Sally, and were
beat back to the Walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capaneus <HI>kill'd.</HI></NOTE> which <HI>Capaneus</HI> moun∣ted
by a sort of Scaling-ladder, but was beat
<PB N="110" REF="139"/>
down with Stones by the besieg'd, and kill'd;
and this undoubtedly gave rise to the Story of
his being struck dead with Thunderbolts.
Upon this ill Success of <HI>Capaneus,</HI> the rest re∣treated,
and many of 'em were slain in the Pur∣suit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eteocles <HI>and</HI> Polyni∣ces <HI>kill each other.</HI></NOTE>
After this, the two Brothers agreed to
decide the Quarrel in their own Persons; and
fought so obstinately, that they were both
mortally wounded; whereupon a general En∣gagement
was renew'd, wherein the <HI>Argives</HI>
were intirely defeated, with the Loss of all their
Captains, but <HI>Adrastus,</HI> who sav'd himself by
Flight. Not but the <HI>Thebans</HI> had suffer'd very
much in the Battel, and paid so dear for their
Conquest, that a <HI>Cadmean Victory</HI> became a
Proverb.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of the two Brothers, <HI>Creon</HI>
again usurp'd the Throne, tho' it was under a
Pretence of Guardianship to <HI>Leodamas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leodamas</NOTE> the Son
of <HI>Eteocles.</HI> He would not suffer the Bodies of
the slain to be bury'd,'till the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who
were chiefly noted for their Humanity, came
at the Request of <HI>Adrastus</HI> with an Army, and
did it by Force. It favour'd so much of Bar∣barity,
to suffer any ill Treatment to the dead
Bodies of their Enemies, that it became a stan∣ding
Law of Arms to inter them. Which na∣tural
Custom, tho' it was at first. taken up out
of Decency, was afterwards improv'd into Su∣perstition;
for it became an Establish'd Opi∣nion,
that the Souls of those who were unbu∣ry'd
wander'd about, and could not gain Ad∣mittance
into <HI>Elysium.</HI></P>
<P>As to what further concerns the War,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The War renew'd.</HI></NOTE> the
Quarrel which seem'd to be at an End, was in
ten Years reviv'd by the <HI>Epigoni,</HI> or Sons of the
<PB N="111" REF="140"/>
seven Captains; who being grown up, resolv'd
to revenge their Fathers Deaths, and join'd in
another Expedition against <HI>Thebes.</HI> By the
Advice of the Oracle they chose <HI>Alemaeon,</HI> the
Son of <HI>Amphiaraus,</HI> their General; and under
his Conduct spoil'd and harass'd the Country,
'till the <HI>Thebans</HI> gave them Battel: Wherein
their King <HI>Leodamas</HI> kill'd <HI>Aegialeus,</HI> the Son
of <HI>Adrastus,</HI> but was himself soon after slain,
or put to flight. Upon which the Citizens of∣fer'd
to Capitulate, and took occasion to con∣vey
themselves by Night out of the Town;
which when the <HI>Epigoni</HI> found they had quit∣ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thebes <HI>taken.</HI> Thersan∣der.</NOTE>
they enter'd, plunder'd, and demolish'd
it: Tho' some say it was preserv'd by <HI>Thersan∣der</HI>
the Son of <HI>Polynices;</HI> which looks most
probable, because he succeeded and reign'd
there, carrying a Body of <HI>Thebans</HI> to the <HI>Tro∣jan</HI>
War, wherein he was kill'd; and his Son
<HI>Tisamenus</HI> being young,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peneleus.</NOTE> <HI>Peneleus</HI> was substitu∣ted
in his Room, but rather as Captain of the
<HI>Baeotian</HI> Forces, than King of <HI>Thebes.</HI> How∣ever,
he also fell in that Expedition, and by
that means put <HI>Tisamenus</HI>'s Title out of Dis∣pute:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tisame∣nus.</NOTE>
So that he enjoy'd the Crown, and left
it to his Son <HI>Autesion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Autesion.</NOTE> who quitted <HI>Thebes,</HI>
and made way for <HI>Damasicthon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Damasict∣hon</NOTE> the Son of

succeeded <HI>Ptolomaeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ptolomae∣us.</NOTE> and last of all <HI>Xanthus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xanthus <HI>the last King.</HI></NOTE>
who being kill'd by <HI>Melanthus,</HI> (as will appear

<P>This Kingdom as it was the last erected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> so

much above three hundred Years from <HI>Cadmus</HI>
to <HI>Xanthus:</HI> Upon whose Death it became a

we are assur'd, it was in the Nature of a <HI>De∣mocracy</HI>

the Time of King <HI>Ogyges,</HI> we have no
Account of any thing that pass'd there. <HI>Plato</HI>
indeed says the <HI>Athenian</HI> Power and Glory was
very great in those Days; that those early In∣habitants
were excellently skill'd both in civil
and military Affairs, were gover'd by just and
wholesome Laws, and liv'd in far greater Splen∣dor,
than they had arriv'd to in his Time.
But he mentions this only as a general Tradi∣tion;
and there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot being the least Footsteps of
any thing to prove it, we may look upon it
as a Story devis'd by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> to support
the Credit of their Antiquity.</P>
<P><PB REF="142"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="143"/>
There are also several Kings mention'd as
reigning in <HI>Attica,</HI> between the Time of <HI>Ogyges</HI>
and <HI>Cecrops,</HI> with some Particulars recorded of
them; as that from <HI>Actaeus,</HI> one of them,
some will have <HI>Attica</HI> to have been formerly
call'd <HI>Acte.</HI> But they are rejected by very an∣cient
Historians; and the most warrantable way
of accounting for that Interval, is, that <HI>Attica</HI>
was so much wasted by the <HI>Ogygian Deluge,</HI>
and its Inhabitants reduc'd to so small a Num∣ber,
that they liv'd an hundred and ninety
Years, from <HI>Ogyges</HI> to <HI>Cecrops</HI> without any
King at all.</P>
<P>To <HI>Cecrops</HI> therefore we must ascribe the
Foundation of <HI>Athens;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cecrops the Founder of</HI> Athens.</NOTE> which is plac'd in the
Reign of <HI>Triopas</HI> King of <HI>Argos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> about three
hundred and seventy two Years before the De∣struction
of <HI>Troy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2448.</NOTE> and the Year of the World
2448. Some make him a Native, but he is
generally thought an <HI>Aegyptian,</HI> and the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
were from him reckon'd an <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Co∣lony,
planted by the <HI>Saitae,</HI> who came with him
from one of the Mouths of <HI>Nile.</HI> He is the
first recorded to have cross'd the Sea, and set∣tled
in <HI>Greece:</HI> But as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> had at
that time little or no Knowledge of Sea-Affairs,
it seems most probable, that he came immedi∣ately
from <HI>Phaenicia,</HI> which was more commo∣diously
seated for the Improvement of Naviga∣tion.
But as yet the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> themselves
us'd only a larger sort of Boats, which were
found out by King <HI>Erythras</HI> among the Islands
in the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>There are several fabulous Reasons given for
his Name of <HI>Diphyes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Name of</HI> Diphyes.</NOTE> as consisting of two Forms,
Serpentine and Human: But the most probable
<PB N="114" REF="144"/>
is, that he was born in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and reign'd in
<HI>Greece,</HI> and was acquainted with the Langu∣age,
and Customs of both Countries. The
People of <HI>Attica,</HI> who lay dispers'd according
to the most ancient Way of living in <HI>Greece,</HI>
he collected into twelve Towns, (tho' some
ascribe this to the second <HI>Cecrops</HI>) constituted
among them one Form of Government, and
took upon himself the Title of King. He then
laid the Model of a City, which he design'd
as a Seat of Residence to his new- rais'd King∣dom;
and as the most commodious Place for
it, he pitch'd upon a Rock situate in a large
Plain near the middle of <HI>Attica,</HI> calling both
the City and Territory round it after his own
Name, <HI>Cecropia.</HI> When afterwards the adja∣cent
Plains were fill'd with Buildings, this was
the <HI>Acropolis,</HI> or Cittadel that commanded
them.</P>
<P>He first introduc'd a Form of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Religion of</HI> Greece.</NOTE> and
prescrib'd to the People both the Objects, and
Modes of Worship, erecting Altars, and Sta∣tues
in Honour of the Gods, particularly of
<HI>Jupiter,</HI> and <HI>Minerva;</HI> from the latter of which,
call'd <HI>Athene</HI> the City took its Name; and
who was always thought to preside more im∣mediately
over <HI>Athens,</HI> than any other Past of
<HI>Greece.</HI> As he seems to have paid more pecu∣liar
Honour to <HI>Minerva,</HI> this may confirm the
Opinion of his coming out of <HI>Aeypt,</HI> since
she was the noted Favourite Deity of the <HI>Saitae,</HI>
who came with him. And indeed there seems
to be such an exact Conformity between the
<HI>Grecian,</HI> and <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Rites, and Ceremonies
of Worship, that <HI>Aegypt</HI> has been look'd upon
as the chief Fountain of all the <HI>Grecian</HI> Super∣stition.
<PB N="115" REF="145"/>
Some there are, who fetch a great Part
of it out of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and ascribe it to <HI>Orpheus</HI>
as the Author. This too may be true in some
Measure: But that the whole <HI>System</HI> of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Religion should be borrow'd either
from <HI>Thrace,</HI> or <HI>Aegypt,</HI> or any one Country,
will appear very improbable to those, who con∣sider
the great Variety of Religions in <HI>Greece,</HI>
where almost every City had different Gods,
and different Modes of Worship. 'Tis more
probable, that <HI>Greece</HI> being inhabited by Colo∣nies
from divers Nations, might borrow from
every one of these some Part of their Religious
Ceremonies; which from a People so excessive∣ly
Superstitious, must needs receive daily Im∣provements,
'till at last they were not content
to worship their ancient Deities, but frequent∣ly
consecrated new ones of their own making;
and besides these, assum'd into their Number
the Gods of all the Nations, with whom they
had any Commerce; insomuch that even in
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Time they amounted to thirty thou∣sand.
To this we may odd their <HI>Feast of all
the strange Gods,</HI> which they religiously ob∣serv'd:
And it was from the <HI>Athenians</HI> Fear of
omitting any, that we meet with Altars erected
by them to the <HI>Vnknown Gods.</HI> In short the
<HI>Athenians</HI> were the People, who carry'd their
Superstition highest, and were always refining
upon Religion, 'till they brought it at last to
nothing but Shew, and Ceremony.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Cecrops,</HI> his next Care was
of the Civil Government; where for the better
Administration of Justice, and the Promotion
of mutual Intercourse among his Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Athens <HI>di∣vided into four Tribes.</HI></NOTE>
he divided them into four <HI>Tribes;</HI> the Names of
<PB N="116" REF="146"/>
which were, <HI>Cecropis, Autocthon, Actaea,</HI> and
<HI>Paralia.</HI> Thus finding them more united into
a Body, and encreas'd by Foreigners, he in∣stituted
a Poll, causing every Man to cast a
Stone into a Place appointed for that Purpose,
and found the Number amount to twenty
thousand. But the Soil being naturally un∣fruitful,
and the People not yet skill'd in Hus∣bandry,
such Multitudes must in a short time
have been reduc'd to the greatest Extremities,
had not <HI>Cecrops</HI> taught 'em something of Navi∣gation,
and thereby supply'd them with Corn
from <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Africk.</HI> He is also reputed the
Author of several good Laws and Constitutions,
particularly concerning Marriage, whereas be∣fore
promiscuous Love was allow'd.</P>
<P>The Foundation of the <HI>Areopagus</HI> is plac'd
under the Reign of <HI>Cecrops,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Coun∣cil of</HI> Areo∣pagus.</NOTE> or his immediate
Successors; tho' some bring it as low as <HI>Solon.</HI>
But this Opinion cannot hold, because <HI>Solon</HI>
in one of his own Laws mentions Judgments
pass'd in this Court, before he had reform'd
the Common-wealth. The Reason of the Mi∣stake
might be, that <HI>Solon</HI> new-modell'd it, ex∣tending
its Power and Privileges, in Opposition
to the <HI>Ephetae,</HI> another more rigorous Court,
improv'd, if not instituted by <HI>Draco.</HI> This
Senate took its Name from the Place in which
it was wont to be assembled, being an Hill
near the Cittadel, sacred to <HI>Mars.</HI> It was
one of their most famous Courts of Judica∣ture;
and was constituted of Men of the high∣est
Stations in the Common-wealth, as remark∣able
for their Virtue and Integrity, as their
Riches and Quality. For this Reason it was
stil'd, <HI>The most sacred and venerable Tribunal;</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="147"/>
and their Justice was so eminently known
throughout all <HI>Greece,</HI> that Foreign States, when
any Difference happene'd among them, would
often appeal to the <HI>Areopagites,</HI> and stand to
their Determination. And <HI>Demosthenes</HI> tells
us, that to his time neither <HI>Plaintiff,</HI> nor <HI>Defen∣dant,</HI>
had any just Reason to be dissatisfy'd with
their Proceedings. This Court is recorded as
the first, that sate upon Life and Death; and
the Trial of wilful Murder seems to have been
the original Design of its Institution: Tho' in
latter Ages, all Incendiaries, Assassines, Con∣spirators,
and Deserters of their Country, and
most capital Causes in general came under its
Cognizance. The Opinion the State had of
the Gravity and Sanctity of its Members,
gain'd them an unlimited Power, insomuch
that, according to <HI>Solon</HI>'s Regulation of this
Assembly, the Inspection and Custody of the
Laws, the Management of the publick Funds,
and Education of the Youth was committed to
them. Their Power extended to Persons of
all Ages and Sexes, to punish the Idle and Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligate,
and reward the Sober and Industrious,
as they thought fit. Besides this, Matters of
Religion, Blasphemy against the Gods, Con∣tempt
of the holy Mysteries, and all sorts of Im∣piety,
as also the Consecration of new Gods,
Erection of Temples and Altars, and Intro∣duction
of new Ceremonies into divine Wor∣ship
were referr'd to the Judgment of this
Court. This was the chief Business of this
Senate: For they seldom intermeddled with the
Management of other publick Affairs, but in
Cases of great and imminent Danger; and then
the Common-wealth had Recourse to them,
<PB N="118" REF="148"/>
as the last and surest Refuge. Thus was their
Authority preserv'd to them intire 'till the time
of <HI>Pericles,</HI> who not having born the Office of
<HI>Archon,</HI> could not be admitted among them;
and therefore imploy'd all his Interest and
Cunning to undermine them: Which he did so
effectually, that his Contempt of them serv'd
to lessen their Dignity; and from that time the
same Excesses and Vices, which were practis'd
in the City, crept in among the <HI>Areopagites</HI>
themselves, 'till by degrees they quite lost their
former Power and Esteem.</P>
<P>Under <HI>Cecrops</HI> happen'd the great <HI>Deluge</HI> in
Part of <HI>Greece,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Deu∣calionean <HI>Deluge.</HI></NOTE> which is known by the Name
of <HI>Deucalion</HI>'s <HI>Flood,</HI> who reign'd at that time
in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> and whose Country was chiefly af∣fected
with it. It is thought he sav'd many in
Boats upon Mount <HI>Parnassus;</HI> and that this gave
Occasion to the Fable of his re-peopling the
Earth. But this Flood agrees in so many Par∣ticulars
with that of <HI>Noah,</HI> that even the <HI>Gre∣cian</HI>
Account of it requires only the Change of
Names, to render it in the <HI>Language</HI> of the
<HI>Scriptures.</HI> And so, notwithstanding the Pains
some have taken to place the <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Ogyges</HI> a∣bove
two hundred Years higher than this, yet
all the sober Inquirers into Antiquity have not
consider'd them as distinct and partial Deluges,
but only as the Remainder of the <HI>Vniversal
one</HI> under <HI>Noah;</HI> the Memory of which was
preserv'd under <HI>Ogyges</HI> in <HI>Attica,</HI> and <HI>Deucalion</HI>
in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> as Men of the most remote Anti∣quity
in each Country. The Parallel holds
yet farther between <HI>Noah,</HI> and <HI>Deucalion:</HI> For
as the first re-peopled the World by his Poste∣rity,
so the Family of the latter was of pro∣portionable
<PB N="119" REF="149"/>
Fame, and Extent in <HI>Greece.</HI> He
had two Sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fami∣ly of</HI> Deu∣calion.</NOTE> <HI>Hellen</HI> and <HI>Amphictyon;</HI> the first
(whom we have already had occasion to men∣tion)
left three, <HI>Xuthus, Aeolus,</HI> and <HI>Dorus.
Aeolus</HI> succeeded his Father, and is to be con∣sider'd
as Founder of the <HI>Aeolians; Dorus</HI>
seated himself in <HI>Histiaeotis,</HI> about the Moun∣tains
<HI>Ossa</HI> and <HI>Olympus;</HI> his Posterity after∣wards
got large footing in <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and pass'd
under the Name of the <HI>Dorians;</HI> and <HI>Xuthus</HI>
will be consider'd with Relation to the extent
of his Family in <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cecrops</HI> dy'd after a Reign of fifty Years;
and his Son <HI>Eresicthon</HI> dying before him, he
was succeeded by <HI>Cranaus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cranaus.</HI></NOTE> a Man of the
greatest Sway, and Figure at that time in
<HI>Athens.</HI> The Country which from <HI>Cecrops,</HI>
was call'd <HI>Cecropia,</HI> was from him call'd <HI>Cranae,</HI>
and afterwards from his Daughter <HI>Atthis, At∣tica:</HI>
And the Names of the four Tribes he
chang'd into <HI>Cranais, Atthis, M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sogaea,</HI> and <HI>Dia∣cris.</HI>
After he had reign'd nine Years, he was
expell'd the Kingdom by <HI>Amphictyon</HI> the o∣ther
Son of <HI>Deucalion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amphi∣ctyon.</NOTE> who had marry'd one of
his Daughters.</P>
<P>To this <HI>Amphictyon</HI> is generally ascrib'd the
Name,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Coun∣cil of the</HI> Amphi∣ctyones.</NOTE> and Institution of the <HI>Amphictyones,</HI> the
famous <HI>National Council,</HI> or <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Greece.</HI> He
first assembled it in <HI>Thessaly</HI> near the Streights
of <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> which from the Place was cal∣led
<HI>Pylaea,</HI> and the Members, <HI>Pylagorae.</HI> But
<HI>Acrisius,</HI> King of <HI>Argos,</HI> afterwards either re∣mov'd
this, or constituted a new one at <HI>Delphi</HI>
in <HI>Phocis;</HI> which lying in the middle of <HI>Greece,</HI>
the Delegates of the twelve Cities, which
compos'd this Assembly, were more easily con∣ven'd
<PB N="120" REF="150"/>
upon any emergent Occasion. Their usu∣al
Times of Meeting were every Spring and
Autumn, or oftner, if Necessity requir'd; and
their Business was to decide the Quarrels and
Differences, that happen'd between any of their
Cities, or Common-wealths. Their Authority
was very great, and their Determinations held
so inviolable, that those, who rejected them,
were proceeded against, as the common Ene∣mies
of <HI>Greece.</HI> This was look'd upon as a
very necessary Institution among a People made
up of so many different States, and jarring In∣terests,
and the best, if not the only Expedient,
to cultivate a good Understanding among them∣selves,
and to proceed with Vigour and Reso∣lution
against their Enemies.</P>
<P>In this King's Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Account of</HI> Bacchus.</NOTE> <HI>Dionysus,</HI> or <HI>Bacchus,</HI>
is said to have come into <HI>Attica.</HI> Some have
taken him for the <HI>Aegyptian Osiris;</HI> and others
for a Prince of <HI>Arabia Foelix,</HI> about the Moun∣tain
<HI>Nysa.</HI> All that can be affirm'd with any
colour of Certainty from the <HI>Grecian</HI> Accounts
of him, is, that he came with his Retinue out
of the <HI>East,</HI> and was Worshipp'd in <HI>Greece,</HI> as
the Inventor of many useful Arts, particularly
of preserving Bees, and dressing the Vine. His
Story is made up of Patches of the <HI>Eastern
Tradition;</HI> which was probably convey'd to
<HI>Greece</HI> by the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> who accompany'd
<HI>Cadmus</HI> thither; and for that Reason he pass'd
for the Grandson of <HI>Cadmus</HI> by his Daughter
<HI>Semele.</HI> From the Analogy he bears with <HI>Noah,
Moses,</HI> and <HI>Nimrod,</HI> some have concluded that
one, or all of them were shadow'd out to the
<HI>Grecians,</HI> under the Name and Person of <HI>Bac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus.</HI>
And that most of the Passages which are
<PB N="121" REF="151"/>
ascrib'd to him, are a plain Corruption of the
<HI>Eastern Story</HI> in general, if not of the <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI>
it self, appears from one remarkable In∣stance
of his Birth, where he is said to have
been <HI>taken out of Jupiter's Thigh;</HI> which is
only an <HI>Hebrew</HI> Phrase for the ordinary way
of Procreation.</P>
<P><HI>Amphictyon</HI> after ten Years Reign was also
expell'd by <HI>Ericthonius;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ericthoni∣us.</NOTE> who besides the fabu∣lous
Account of his Birth, is said to have had
<HI>Snakes</HI> Feet; which gave occasion of ascribing
to him the Invention of Chariots to hide
them. But this is more properly owing to the
<HI>Panathenaea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Pana∣thenaea.</NOTE> which was also instituted by <HI>E∣ricthonius,</HI>
where the running with Chariots
was one of the Performances. This was a
Festival in Honour of <HI>Minerva,</HI> and was at
first call'd <HI>Athenaea;</HI> and when afterwards re∣viv'd,
and amplify'd by <HI>Theseus,</HI> who had col∣lected
the People of <HI>Attica</HI> into one City, it
was call'd <HI>Panathenaea,</HI> or the <HI>Sacrifice of all the
united</HI> Athenians. There were two Solemni∣ties
of this Name; the Great One celebrated
once in five Years, and the Lesser every Year,
and were much the same with the <HI>Roman
Quinquatria.</HI></P>
<P>Here it may not be amiss to observe of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Festivals in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Fe∣stivals of</HI> Greece.</NOTE> that they were a
great Part of their Religion, being instituted
chiefly in Honour of their Gods, and Heroes,
who had rescu'd their Country from Slavery, and
Oppression, or dy'd in its Defence. And
without doubt this great Encouragement of
transmitting Mens Names to Posterity, gave
Birth to the many generous Enterprises of Anti∣quity;
tho' they were in Time unhappily im∣prov'd
<PB N="122" REF="152"/>
into <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Fable,</HI> 'till they pass'd
at last for downright <HI>Knight-Errantry.</HI> As
their Religion was at first more pure, and less
pompous, so their Festivals were few: But in
latter Ages, and particularly in <HI>Athens,</HI> where
their Gods were increas'd almost to the Num∣ber
of Men, the Number and Magnificence of
their Festivals rose in Proportion. For as they
formerly consisted of little more than a Sacri∣fice,
they had afterwards Games, Processions,
and a thousand superstitious Observances in I∣mitation
of the fabulous Actions of their Gods,
which were introduc'd and practis'd to the vast
Charge of the Publick. But to return to <HI>E∣ricthonius,</HI>
he is said to have brought Silver first
into <HI>Attica;</HI> or at least to have stamp'd in the
Nature of Coin: And after a Reign of fifty
Years, he left the Kingdom to his Son <HI>Pan∣dion.</HI></P>
<P>The Crown had hitherto been possess'd by
Craft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pandion I.</NOTE> or Violence. This <HI>Pandion</HI> was the first,
who held it in Right of Succession: And tho'
there afterwards happen'd some Disturbances in
the Government, yet from him it became proper∣ly
an hereditary Kingdom. In his Reign <HI>Tripto∣lcmus</HI>
is said to have taught the <HI>Athenians</HI> to
sow and manure the Ground; which he learnt
from <HI>Ceres,</HI> the same with the <HI>Aegyptian Isis,</HI>
who is thought at this time to have come into
<HI>Attica;</HI> and in Honour of whom were institu∣ted
the <HI>Eleusinia,</HI> so call'd from <HI>Eleusis</HI> a Bo∣rough-Town
of <HI>Attica.</HI> This Festival was cele∣brated
with the greatest Secrecy, and Solemnity
of any in <HI>Greece.</HI> It was call'd the <HI>Mysteries,</HI>
by way of Eminence, without any other note
of Distinction; and it was Death to divulge
<PB N="123" REF="153"/>
the least Part of the Ceremonies. But the
Goddess, and her Worship is by some plac'd
under <HI>Erectheus</HI> the Successor of <HI>Pandion:</HI> And
the Institution being wholly <HI>Aegyptian,</HI> seems
to make for those, who fancy him also an <HI>Ae∣gyptian.</HI>
But I had rather agree with the com∣mon
Opinion, that <HI>Pandion,</HI> after a Reign of
forty Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Erectheus.</NOTE> left the Kingdom to <HI>Erectheus</HI> his
Son, and a Native of <HI>Attica.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Erectheus</HI> had War with the <HI>Chalcidians</HI> of
<HI>Eubaea;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xuthus.</NOTE> and by the Assistance of <HI>Xuthus,</HI> the
Son of <HI>Hellen,</HI> who had fled out of <HI>Thessaly</HI>
with a great Part of his Father's Treasure, de∣feated
them. To reward which Service, <HI>E∣rectheus</HI>
gave him his Daughter <HI>Creusa,</HI> by
whom he had <HI>Ion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ion.</NOTE> who was equally useful to
him in a second War he had with the <HI>Eleusini∣ans,</HI>
who were assisted by <HI>Eumolpus</HI> King of
<HI>Thrace. Ion</HI> gain'd so much Power and Cre∣dit
in the Common-wealth, that some fancy he
succeeded his Grandfather in the Kingdom:
At least he had all the Marks of Sovereignty,
but the Title, changing the Name of the Coun∣try,
and the four Tribes, as several of the for∣mer
Kings had done. He had a numerous Pro∣geny,
which, when <HI>Attica</HI> was over-stock'd
with Inhabitants, was sent out as a Colony in∣to
<HI>Peloponnesus;</HI> from whence they were ex∣pell'd
by the <HI>Achaeans,</HI> descended from <HI>Achaeus</HI>
the Brother of <HI>Ion,</HI> and return'd to <HI>Athens;</HI>
and were afterwards led out into the <HI>Lesser
Asia</HI> by the Sons of <HI>Codrus,</HI> where they form'd
several distinct Colonies, but pass'd under the
common Name of the <HI>Ionians.</HI> This is the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Account of <HI>Ion;</HI> but it is built upon
such Uncertainties, that it still leaves room for
<PB N="124" REF="154"/>
the Opinion above-mention'd, that he might be
the same with <HI>Javan,</HI> the fourth Son of <HI>Ja∣pheth,</HI>
who is said to have come into <HI>Greece</HI>
after the <HI>Confusion</HI> of <HI>Babel,</HI> and seated himfelf
in <HI>Attica.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Erectheus,</HI> some say he fell
in the Battel with the <HI>Eleusinians.</HI> It is cer∣tain
he dy'd in the fiftieth Year of his Reign;
and being a Prince of great Justice and Valour,
was rank'd among the Heroes of those early
Times, and had Divine Honours paid him af∣ter
his Death. The People of <HI>Athens,</HI> who had
hitherto pass'd under the Name of <HI>Cecropidae,</HI>
were from him call'd <HI>Erecthidae.</HI> His Daughter
<HI>Orithya</HI> was taken away by <HI>Boreas</HI> a <HI>Thracian;</HI>
which Rape the Poets ascribe to the North∣wind,
because <HI>Thrace</HI> is situate North from <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Death of <HI>Erectheus,</HI> there arose a
Contest among his three Sons, <HI>Cecrops, Metion</HI>
and <HI>Pandorus,</HI> about the Succession. They re∣ferr'd
the Matter to <HI>Xuthus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cecrops II.</NOTE> who adjudg'd it
to <HI>Cecrops,</HI> as eldest: But the rest were not sa∣tisfy'd
with this Determination; upon which
<HI>Xuthus</HI> quitted <HI>Athens,</HI> and went into <HI>Aegialia,</HI>
where he dy'd. This <HI>Cecrops</HI> led a Colony in∣to
<HI>Eubaea;</HI> he is also said to have built <HI>Rhodes;</HI>
and after a Reign of forty Years left the King∣dom
to his Son <HI>Pandion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pandion</HI> the Second was expell'd the King∣dom
by the Sons of <HI>Metion</HI> his Uncle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pandion II.</NOTE> and
fled for Refuge to <HI>Pylas,</HI> King of <HI>Megara,</HI>
whose Daughter he had marry'd. There he
succeeded his Father-in-law, and left four Sons,
<HI>Aegeus, Lycus, Pallas,</HI> and <HI>Nisus;</HI> who, after
their father's Death, recover'd his Dominions
<PB N="125" REF="155"/>
by driving the <HI>Metionide</HI> out of <HI>Athens.</HI> Some
say they restor'd him before he dy'd, and that
at his Death he divided his Kingdom among
them in four equal Proportions. But this not
being generally agreed on, nor which Part fell
to each Man's Lot, we may look upon it as a
Division of their own; and that <HI>Aegeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aegeus.</NOTE> in
effect, succeeded his Father <HI>Pandion,</HI> after a
Reign of twenty five Years. His Brothers had
their Shares allotted them for assisting him in
his War with the <HI>Metionidae;</HI> but he had un∣doubtedly
the supreme Power with the Sove∣reignty
of <HI>Athens</HI> assign'd to him as the Eldest.
Yet it was not without secret Murmurings a∣mong
the rest; and the rather, because <HI>Aegeus</HI>
was generally thought to be only an adopted Son
of <HI>Pandion.</HI> But those who gave him the greatest
Umbrage, were the <HI>Pallantidae,</HI> the fifty Sons
of his Brother <HI>Pallas:</HI> And his want of Chil∣dren,
the Cause for which they despis'd him,
was that which with-held them from breaking
out into open Rebellion, in hopes the Crown
would of Course devolve upon them after his
Death. <HI>Aegeus,</HI> who had marry'd two Wives,
and had Issue by neither, went to <HI>Delphi</HI>
to consult the Oracle about Posterity. The
Answer being somewhat obscure, in his Return
he went to <HI>Pittheus</HI> the Son of <HI>Pelops</HI> at <HI>Trae∣zene,</HI>
a Man of the greatest Knowledge and
Wisdom in his time, to have it explain'd. <HI>Pit∣theus</HI>
entertain'd him; and however he inter∣preted
the Oracle, it was with his Consent,
that <HI>Aegeus</HI> lay with his Daughter <HI>Aetbra,</HI> and
left her with Child of <HI>Theseus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Theseus</HI> prov'd a Youth of great Expectati∣on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theseus.</NOTE>
and when he was about sixteen Years old,
<PB N="126" REF="156"/>
his Mother acquainted him with his Original,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Acts of his Youth.</HI></NOTE>
and sent him to <HI>Athens.</HI> The Country was so
infested with Thieves and Murderers, that it
was a very dangerous Journey; yet he chose
rather to go by Land, than Sea. He was se∣cretly
fir'd with the Fame of <HI>Hercules,</HI> to
whom he was also ally'd by his Mother: And
as he had clear'd the Ways of a great part of
these Robbers, so <HI>Theseus</HI> would endeavour to
suppress the rest. Accordingly he destroy'd
several in his Way; and observ'd a Method in
Imitation of <HI>Hercules,</HI> whom he propos'd as his
constant Pattern, to punish them after the same
manner they had treated others. At last he
arriv'd at <HI>Athens;</HI> where he was entertain'd as
a Stranger, but had like to have been poison'd
by his Father, through the Persuasion of <HI>Me∣dea,</HI>
who was fled to him from <HI>Corinth.</HI>
But upon his shewing <HI>Aegeus</HI> the Sword,
which he had left with his Mother as a
Pledge, he threw down the Poison, embrac'd
him, and own'd him publickly for his Son
and Successor. This serv'd to inflame the
seditious Murmurs of the <HI>Pallantidae,</HI> who
highly resented it, that first <HI>Aegeus,</HI> the a∣dopted
Son of <HI>Pandion,</HI> and not related to the
Family of <HI>Erectheus,</HI> and then <HI>Theseus,</HI>
a perfect Stranger, and a Bastard too, should obtain
the Crown of their Ancestors. Upon which
finding their Hopes utterly defeated, they
broke out into open Acts of Hostility; but
were soon vanquish'd, and dispers'd by the
Courage and Conduct of <HI>Theseus.</HI> Who to
keep himself in Action, and gain the Favour
of the People, encounter'd several monstrous
Creatures, which infested the Country; and
<PB N="127" REF="157"/>
particularly the <HI>Marathonian Bull,</HI> which he
overcame, and bringing it alive in Triumph
through the City, sacrific'd it to <HI>Apollo.</HI> His
next Exploit was the killing of the <HI>Minotaur,</HI>
a Monster kept by <HI>Minos</HI> King of <HI>Crete.</HI> The
Story is told, that <HI>Androgeos</HI> the Son of <HI>Mi∣nos</HI>
coming to the Feast of <HI>Athenaa,</HI> at <HI>Athens,</HI>
excell'd all his Antagonists in the Exercises
perform'd there, and contracted an Intimacy
with the <HI>Pallantidae. Aegeus</HI> fearing least he
should join with them to deprive him of his
Kingdom, made away with him: Which so
incens'd <HI>Minos,</HI> that he declar'd War against
the <HI>Athenians.</HI> And being at that time Master
of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Seas, gave them so much Distur∣bance,
that they were glad at last to comply
with the Advice of the Oracle, and send him
by way of Composition an annual Tribute, for
the space of seven or nine Years, of seven
young Men, and as many Virgins, to be de∣vour'd
(as the Fable runs) by this <HI>Minotaur;</HI>
but rather to be kill'd, or kept in Slavery by
<HI>Taurus,</HI> appointed by <HI>Minos</HI> for that Office.
At the third time of sending this Tribute, <HI>The∣seus</HI>
offer'd himself to go among the rest, in
hopes to free his Country from this Slavery,
by destroying the Monster. Accordingly he
arriv'd at <HI>Crete,</HI> where he receiv'd of <HI>Ariadne,</HI>
the Daughter of <HI>Minos,</HI> who fell in Love with
him, a Clue of Thread to conduct him through
the Windings of the <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> where the
<HI>Minotaur</HI> was kept: And having slain him, re∣turn'd
with his Fellow-Captives in Triumph to
<HI>Athens,</HI> and got the Tribute remitted. But in
his Return, through an Excess of Joy, he for∣got
to hang out the White Sail, which should
<PB N="128" REF="158"/>
have been the Token of their Safety to <HI>Aege∣us,</HI>
who sate expecting them upon the Top of
a Rock: And as soon as their Ship came in
View with the Black one, which they us'd to
carry in Token of their unavoidable Destructi∣on,
he knowing nothing of their Success,
threw himself headlong into the Sea, which
probably took its Name from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> and made
way to <HI>Theseus</HI>'s Succession to the Grown after
forty eight Years Reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2770.</NOTE></P>
<P>II. From <HI>Cecrops</HI> the First to this time, the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Government suffer'd little Alteration.
But <HI>Theseus,</HI> as he had freed his Country from
foreign Slavery, and intestine Sedition, so now
he resolv'd to regulate, and new model the
State.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Altera∣tions in the State.</HI></NOTE> Yet being a wife, as well as powerful
Prince, he knew that to attempt any considerable
Change, he must proceed warily, and use
all the gentle insinuating Methods, especially to
a People, who had so strong a Sense of their
Liberty.</P>
<P>In the first Place therefore, to remedy the In∣convenience
of having them dispers'd in Villa∣ges,
and canton'd up and down the Country,
always quarrelling among themselves, and never
assembled to consult for the publick Good, he
collected all the Inhabitants of <HI>Attica</HI> into one
City, which together with <HI>Cecropia,</HI> the Regal
Seat, he nam'd <HI>Athens.</HI> His Method to effect
this, was to go from one Tribe to another, to
appease their Differences, and propose his de∣sign
of a common Agreement between them.
The poorer Sort, who could be no Losers by
it, readily closed with his Advice: To those
of Power and Interest he promis'd a Common-wealth;
<PB N="129" REF="159"/>
wherein reserving to himself only the
Command of their Arms, and Custody of the
Laws, there should be an equal Distribution of
all things else among them, and the Power be
lodg'd wholly in the People. The rest fearing
his Power, which was already grown very for∣midable,
and knowing his Courage and Reso∣lution,
chose rather to be persuaded, than forc'd
into a Compliance.</P>
<P>His next Business, when he had brought
them over thus far to his Proposal, was to dis∣solve
all the distinct Courts of Justice, and
Corporations belonging to the twelve Towns,
and build one common <HI>Prytaneum,</HI> or Council∣hall
in the City. And with a Design to en∣large
his City, he invited all Strangers to come
and settle there, and enjoy equal Privileges with
the Natives. Yet to prevent Confusion and
Anarchy, upon such promiscuous Multitudes
flowing in, he first divided the People into
three distinct Ranks, of Nobles, Husbandmen,
and Artificers. The Nobility he appointed as
the Fountain of Magistracy; but the Choice be∣long'd
in a great Measure, if not wholly to the
People. To this first Rank he committed the
Teaching and Interpretation of the Laws, and
the Care of Religion; the whole City as to all
other Matters being reduc'd to a Sort of an
Equality, the Nobles excelling in Honour, the
Husbandmen in Profit, and the Artificers in
Number.</P>
<P><HI>Theseus</HI> having proceeded thus far with Suc∣cess,
in a manner divested himself, according
to his Promise, of the Regal Power: Which a
Man of so much Spirit and Bravery, and who
had deserv'd so well of the State, might as

easily have extended, as diminish'd. Where∣fore,
tho' the <HI>Genius</HI> of the <HI>Athenians</HI> always
ran high for Liberty; yet he seems rather to
have comply'd with his own Inclination for
popular Government, as best suited to the
Scheme he had laid down. However, it was
look'd upon as a generous Act of Resignation:
And this with his Enlarging the City, and his
many other signal Services, gain'd him the Ti∣tle
of <HI>The Second Founder of</HI> Athens. Not that
it was yet a settled Common-wealth; but this
was so fair an Advance towards it, that the
People from that time continually got Ground
against the vain Attempts of some of the suc∣ceeding
Kings, to recover the Power with the
Title of <HI>Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>Having laid this Foundation, he left it for
others to build upon; and spent the rest of his
Life in Search of new Adventures with <HI>Hercu∣les,</HI>
and the other Heroes of his time. As <HI>Her∣cules</HI>
had instituted the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games in Ho∣nour
of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> so did he the <HI>Isthmian</HI> in Ho∣nour
of <HI>Neptune,</HI> whose Son he pass'd for among
those, who could not otherwife account for his
Birth, and the rather, because he was a great
Encourager of Trade and Navigation. To
his roving Temper, and Impatience of Ease, we
must refer his <HI>Romantick</HI> Voyage into the
<HI>Euxine</HI> Sea against the <HI>Amazons,</HI> from amongst
whom he got his Wife <HI>Antiope,</HI> or, as some
call'd her, <HI>Hippolyte.</HI> This gave rise to the
<HI>Amazonian</HI> War; wherein those warlike Wo∣men
besieg'd <HI>Athens,</HI> encamp'd, and gave the
Citizens Battel within their very Walls; 'till at
last a Peace was concluded by <HI>Antiope</HI>'s Means.
But this War is so differently related, that some
<PB N="131" REF="161"/>
have fancy'd there were two Expeditions of
that Kind, and that <HI>Antiope,</HI> and <HI>Hippolyte</HI> were
two distinct Women. Neither must we omit
his celebrated Friendship which <HI>Pirithous</HI> the
Son of <HI>Ixion,</HI> begun upon an hostile Interview,
which struck them both with a secret Admira∣tion
of each others Person and Bravery. <HI>The∣seus,</HI>
when he was fifty Years old, join'd with
him in stealing <HI>Helena</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Tyn∣dareus,</HI>
from <HI>Sparta,</HI> who falling to him by
Lot, he carry her to his Mother at <HI>Aphidnae,</HI>
to be kept there 'till she were marriagable.
Then having agreed to procure another Wife
for his Friend, they travell'd into <HI>Epirus,</HI> to
steal the Daughter of <HI>Aidoneus,</HI> King of the
<HI>Molossi,</HI> whom the Fable calls <HI>Pluto:</HI> But he
being inform'd of their Design, kill'd <HI>Pirithous,</HI>
and imprison'd <HI>Theseus,</HI> 'till at the Request of <HI>Her∣cules</HI>
he was set at Liberty. But whilst he was
engag'd in those foreign Adventures, <HI>Mene∣stheus</HI>
the Son of <HI>Peteus,</HI> and great Grandson
of <HI>Erectheus,</HI> took Occasion from his Absence
to ingratiate himself with the leading Men of
<HI>Athens,</HI> and insinuated, that his late Change in
the State was only a Project to enslave 'em un∣der
a Pretence of Liberty. And to favour his
Design, it happen'd that <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI> the
Sons of <HI>Tyndareus,</HI> came at this time against
<HI>Athens,</HI> in search of their Sister <HI>Helena:</HI> Who
not finding her there, went to <HI>Aphidnae,</HI> took
the Town, and recover'd their Sister. Then by
<HI>Menestheus</HI>'s Means the Brothers were honou∣rably
receiv'd into <HI>Athens:</HI> And when <HI>Theseus</HI>
return'd, he found the Peoples Minds gene∣rally
alienated, even to a Contempt of his Per∣son
and Authority. Upon which he sent his
Children privately into <HI>Euboea,</HI> and having so∣lemnly
<PB N="132" REF="162"/>
curs'd the People of <HI>Athens,</HI> banish'd
himself into the Island <HI>Scyrus;</HI> where the com∣mon
Report is, that <HI>Lycomedes</HI> the King, ei∣ther
jealous of his Fame, or to gratifie <HI>Mene∣stheus,</HI>
led him up to the Top of a Rock, as
though to shew him the Country, and threw
him down headlong.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theseus'<HI>s Death.</HI></NOTE> Thus dy'd <HI>Theseus,</HI> when
he had reign'd thirty Years. He was by far
the greatest King of <HI>Athens:</HI> And tho' he was
so ungratefully abandon'd by his Subjects, yet
succeeding Ages paid a just Reverence to his
Relicks; and his Tomb was plac'd as a Refuge
for Slaves, in Memory, that whilst he liv'd,
his whole Care and Study was to redress Grie∣vances,
and relieve the distress'd.</P>
<P><HI>Menestheus</HI> by this Means got Possession of
the Crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Menesthe∣us.</NOTE> He went with his Quota of fifty
Ships to the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, where he grew fa∣mous
for his Skill in military Affairs, being
mention'd as the first who marshalled an Army
in the Order of Rank and File. In his Re∣turn
from <HI>Troy</HI> he dy'd in the Isle of <HI>Melos,</HI> in
the twenty third Year of his Reign: And was
succeeded by <HI>Demophon</HI> the Son of <HI>Theseus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Demophon</NOTE> who
with his Brother <HI>Acamas</HI> went to the Siege of
<HI>Troy.</HI> In his Return he was driven upon the
Coasts of <HI>Thrace,</HI> where <HI>Phyllis</HI> the Queen fell
in Love with him; to whom he promis'd Mar∣riage
after he had been to settle his Affairs at
<HI>Athens:</HI> But not coming at the time appointed,
she hang'd herself. The Court of Judicature,
call'd <HI>In Palladio,</HI> was instituted in his Reign,
and upon his Account. The Story runs, that
some of the <HI>Argives</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Dio∣medes,</HI>
being driven by Night upon the Coasts
of <HI>Attica,</HI> and supposing it an Enemies Coun∣try,
went out to spoil and plunder it. The
<PB N="133" REF="163"/>
<HI>Athenians</HI> took the Alarm, and being united un∣der
the Conduct of <HI>Demophon,</HI> repuls'd the In∣vaders
with great Loss. But upon the Ap∣proach
of Day, <HI>Acamas</HI> finding among the
dead Bodies, the <HI>Palladium,</HI> or Statue of <HI>Mi∣nerva,</HI>
which was brought from <HI>Tory,</HI> discover'd
the Mistake in having kill'd their Friends and
Allies. Whereupon they referr'd the Quarrel
to fifty <HI>Athenians,</HI> and as many <HI>Argives,</HI> whom
they call'd <HI>Ephetae.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Origi∣nal of the</HI> Ephetae.</NOTE> And this seems to be the
The Original of the <HI>Ephetae,</HI> a Court re-instituted
by <HI>Draco</HI> in Opposition to the <HI>Areopagus;</HI>
tho' their Business at first was only to inquire
into involuntary Murders. <HI>Demophon,</HI> after
thirty three Years Reign, left the Kingdom to
his Son <HI>Oxyntes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxyntes. Aphidas. Thymaetes.</NOTE> And he, after twelve more, to
his Son <HI>Aphidas;</HI> who reign'd but one Year,
being murder'd by his Bastard Brother <HI>Thymae∣tes;</HI>
who thereupon usurp'd the Kingdom, and
was the last of the <HI>Erecthidae,</HI> who reign'd in
<HI>Athens.</HI> There was at this time a Dispute be∣tween
the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and <HI>Boeotians,</HI> about their
Confines, and it was propos'd by the latter that
their two Kings should decide it. But <HI>Thy∣maetes</HI>
declining the Challenge, <HI>Melanthus</HI> a
<HI>Messenian</HI> accepted it. Just as they were go∣ing
to engage, <HI>Melanthus</HI> cry'd our, <HI>This is not
according to our Agreement,</HI> Xanthus, <HI>to come
provided with a Second, against me a single Man.</HI>
At which <HI>Xanthus</HI> the <HI>Boeotian</HI> King looking
back to see who follow'd him, <HI>Melanthus</HI> run
him through with his Lance. By this Strata∣gem
he got the Victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melanthus.</NOTE> and with it the King∣dom
of <HI>Athens, Thymaetes</HI> either yielding it
voluntarily, or being depos'd for his Cowar∣dise,
after he had reign'd eight Years. <HI>Me∣lanthus</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="164"/>
reign'd thirty seven; and left the Crown
to his Son <HI>Codrus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Codrus, <HI>the last King.</HI></NOTE> who enjoy'd it twenty one;
and then generously sacrifis'd himself for the
good of his Country. For the <HI>Heraclidae</HI> ha∣ving
made an Irruption into <HI>Attica,</HI> the Oracle
was consulted about it, and the Answer was, that
the Invaders should Conquer, upon Condition
they did not kill the <HI>Athenian</HI> King. Which
<HI>Codrus</HI> having notice of, disguis'd himself in
the Habit of a Peasant, and picking a Quarrel
with some of the Enemy, provok'd them to
kill him. Whereupon the <HI>Athenians</HI> sent an
Herald to them to demand the Body of their
King: Which Message struck such a Damp in∣to
them, that they immediately broke up their
Camp, and return'd home.</P>
<P>III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> Thus fell <HI>Codrus,</HI> and with him the
Title of King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2935.</NOTE> which had continu'd without
any Interruption four hundred and eighty seven
Years from <HI>Cecrops</HI> to <HI>Codrus.</HI> The <HI>Athenians</HI>
out of Reverence to his Memory would suffer no
more to govern by that Name: This at least
was their Pretence, which they seldom wanted
upon all Occasions to enlarge their Power,
'till at last they got it intirely into their own
Hands. The Title of King was chang'd into
that of <HI>Perpetual Archon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Perpe∣tual</HI> Ar∣chons.</NOTE> or Prince during Life;
and the Succession preserv'd from Father to
son. Which was so gradual a Fall, that most
Writers have rank'd these <HI>Archons</HI> among their
Kings; tho' I think not so properly, because
their Power was more precarious, they being
oblig'd to give the People an Account of their
Management, whenever they should demand it.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="165"/>
The first of these <HI>Perpetual Archons</HI> was <HI>Me∣don</HI>
the eldest Son of <HI>Codrus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Medon <HI>the First▪</HI></NOTE> His Brother <HI>Ni∣leus</HI>
despis'd him because he was lame, and
from thence took occasion to dispute the Go∣vernment
with him. The People would have
made this a Pretence of putting them both by;
and declar'd they would have no King but
<HI>Jupiter:</HI> So that during the time of this Con∣test,
there was a sort of <HI>Theocracy</HI> in <HI>Athens.</HI>
But at last the Oracle giving it against <HI>Nileus,</HI>
he, with the rest of his Brothers, led out the
Colonies before-mention'd into <HI>Asia,</HI> and there
founded the twelve famous Cities of the <HI>Ioni∣ans;</HI>
which were <HI>Ephesus, Miletus, Priene, Co∣lophon,
Myus, Teos, Lebedos, Clazomenae, Ery∣thrae,
Phocaea,</HI> with <HI>Chios,</HI> and <HI>Samos,</HI> belonging
to the two lslands of these Names.</P>
<P><HI>Medon</HI> govern'd twenty Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>From whom the rest were call'd</HI> Medontidae</NOTE> and after him
succeeded twelve more of a regular Descent
from him, and therefore fir-nam'd <HI>Medontidae.</HI>
Their Names were <HI>Acastus</HI> who govern'd thir∣ty
six Years, <HI>Archippus</HI> nineteen, <HI>Thersippus</HI>
forty one, <HI>Phorbas</HI> thirty, <HI>Megacles</HI> twenty
eight, <HI>Diognetus</HI> twenty five, <HI>Pherecles</HI> nine∣teen,
<HI>Ariphron</HI> twenty, <HI>Thespieus</HI> twenty seven,
<HI>Agamestor</HI> seventeen, <HI>Aeschylus</HI> twenty three,
and <HI>Alcmaeon</HI> two Years. There is scarce a
memorable Action mention'd of any one of them;
but by them the Government was carry'd on
with Ease, and without Alteration, for the
Space of above three hundred Years.</P>
<P>This unactive Period of time gives us an Op∣portunity
of inquiring into the State of Science,
and Literature, which began now to display
themselves in the more civiliz'd Parts of <HI>Greece.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first Age of Po∣etry.</HI></NOTE>
Poetry is in the first Place to be consider'd, as
<PB N="136" REF="166"/>
it was the most ancient way of writing, and
the chief Vehicle, by which many other Parts
of Knowledge were convey'd to Mankind. As
for <HI>LinUs, Orpheus, Musaeus,</HI> and the other
Founders of the <HI>Fabulous Theology,</HI> their Names
have been deliver'd down to us with some ge∣neral
Marks of Esteem and Reverence; But
their History is too suspicious and confus'd,
to admit of a serious Relation, since we cannot
fix their Age, or Country, and since the few
Remains we have of them, have been ascrib'd
to others of a much later Date. Upon the
whole, there are few so hardy to deny, that
there was any such thing as Poetry in <HI>Greece</HI>
before <HI>Homer;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Homer.</NOTE> but we have no sufficient Au∣thority
to begin our Account of it, but from
him. And even here, the Criticks have been
more industrious in settling the Time, and
Country of this great Man, than in examining
his Writings: And tho' they cannot decide the
Controversie, their Attempts have not been al∣together
fruitless, inasmuch as they serve suffi∣ciently
to advance the Credit of his Works,
which were the only Grounds of their Enquiry.
Of all the Places which have contended for
him, <HI>Smyrna</HI> carries the fairest Title: And he
seems to have flourish'd between two and three
hundred Years after the Destruction of <HI>Troy.</HI>
As for those, who place him below the Begin∣ning
of the <HI>Olympiads,</HI> it is not easily to be pre∣sum'd,
that he, who took all imaginable Care
to embellish his Poems with Description,
should omit so Ornamental a Part as the <HI>Olym∣pick
Games,</HI> if he had been alive at the Celebra∣tion
of them. To consider him in his Person
and Fortune, he is represented as a blind, in∣digent

<PB N="137" REF="168"/>
<HI>Bard,</HI> strowling up and down the Coun∣try
like a <HI>Ballad-singer</HI> But the Image of his
Mind gives us a noble Prospect of him: 'Tis
there we view him in his full Proportion, with
all the Advantages of Art and Nature, and re∣verence
him as <HI>The Prince, and Father of the</HI>
Grecian <HI>Poets.</HI> Some have so far refin'd upon
his Writings, as to pretend to draw from them
the Original not only of all kinds of Poetry,
but also of all Arts, and Sciences, and Religion,
and Government. But we may easily allow
him to have been the most <HI>Vniversal Genius</HI> of
his Time, without making him the Founder of
States, and Kingdoms, and the Author of all
Civility: And it is sufficient to secure his Fame
to all Ages, that the Brightness and Loftiness
of his Thoughts, the Strength and Beauty of
his Images, the Dress of his Fictions, the Har∣mony
of his Numbers, the Justness of his Cha∣racters,
and the artificial Contexture of the
whole, have carry'd the <HI>Epick</HI> Poem in its In∣fancy,
if not at its Birth, to an almost inimita∣ble
Perfection.</P>
<P><HI>Hesiod,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hesiod.</NOTE> who was originally of <HI>Cuma</HI> in
<HI>Aeolia,</HI> but remov'd young to <HI>Ascra</HI> a little
Village of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> is generally reckon'd the next
Poet to <HI>Homer,</HI> as well in the Value of his
Works, as in the Period of his Age. Some
make him the Elder of the two; others affirm
they were Contemporary, and that <HI>Hesiod</HI> car∣ry'd
the Prize from him in a Poetical Contenti∣on.
Upon which <HI>Lucian</HI> makes a pleasant Re∣mark,
<HI>That</HI> Homer <HI>had much the better on't, but
yet</HI> Hesiod <HI>was the Victor.</HI> Perhaps the Epi∣gram
upon which this Contest between them is
grounded, may be supposititious; and <HI>Hesiod</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="169"/>
might flourish some Years after the other. But
it is certainly a great Disadvantage to him to
be plac'd so near to <HI>Homer,</HI> as if they were de∣sign'd
for Rivals; whereas the Merit of <HI>Hesiod</HI>
is of a quite different Stamp. He contented
himself with the <HI>Middle Stile,</HI> without aspiring
to the <HI>Sublime;</HI> he chose rather to be delight∣ful,
than pompous, and rather to speak proper∣ly,
than finely. As he affected nothing more
than the Ease and Retirement of a Country
Life, his <HI>Genius</HI> put him upon such Subjects,
as required the same easie Plainess, and Gravity:
And his Success in this kind of Writing, is
sufficient to justifie his Pretensions to a second
Place in Poetry. <HI>Maximum of Tyre</HI> tells a Sto∣ry
of him, which argues him to have been
very jealous of his Fame, or else a great Hu∣mourist.
For observing a Potter, as he was at
Work, singing some of his Verses with an ill
Accent, and Cadence, he throws himself down
upon his Pots, and breaks 'em; at which the
poor Fellow cries out, <HI>Why do you spoil my
Work? Because,</HI> says <HI>Hesiod, you spoil mine.</HI></P>
<P>To this Growth of Poetry,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Ac∣count of the</HI> Olympick <HI>Games.</HI></NOTE> we may add
another Effect of the general Tranquility <HI>Greece</HI>
enjoy'd at this Time, which was the Celebrati∣on
of the <HI>Olympick Games,</HI> so call'd from <HI>Olympia</HI>
a City, near which they were perform'd in the
Plains of <HI>Elis.</HI> Some ascribe the first Instituti∣on
of them to <HI>Hercules</HI> one of the <HI>Idaei Dacty∣li;</HI>
and others to <HI>Pisus,</HI> of whom we have no∣thing
left but the Name. But <HI>Pelops</HI> being
more famous in History, is rather thought to
have instituted them in Honour of <HI>Jupiter▪</HI>
And after him <HI>Atreus, Hercules</HI> the Son of
<HI>Alcmena, Oxylus,</HI> and others renew'd them.
<PB N="139" REF="170"/>
But as yet they were of no settled Date, being
celebrated only upon some extraordinary Occa∣sions,
and without any remarkable Pomp and So∣lemnity.
The first, from whom they became
famous, was <HI>Iphitus</HI> King of <HI>Elis,</HI> of the Poste∣rity
of <HI>Hercules,</HI> who restor'd them by the Ad∣vice
of the Oracle. They were repeated eve∣ry
fifth Year; and hence the Revolution of
four compleat Years, which was the Interval
between each Solemnity, was call'd an <HI>Olympiad.</HI>
But even after <HI>Iphitus,</HI> they seem not to have
been continu'd regularly at first, because that
which generally passes for the first <HI>Olympiad,</HI>
in which <HI>Coroebus</HI> of <HI>Elis</HI> won the Prize, was
properly the twenty eighth.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first</HI> Olympiad.</NOTE> However, it is
from hence the <HI>Vulgar Aera</HI> of the <HI>Olympiads</HI>
takes Date;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> and falls in with the second Year
of <HI>Aeschylus</HI> the twelfth <HI>Perpetual Archon</HI> of
<HI>Athens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3228.</NOTE> four hundred and eight Years after the
Destruction of <HI>Troy,</HI> and in the 3228th Year
of the World. This <HI>Epocha</HI> is plac'd by <HI>Var∣ro,</HI>
as the Boundary between the <HI>Fabulous,</HI> and
<HI>Historical</HI> Times, and is so much celebrated for
its Certainty, that some account the Number of
<HI>Olympiads</HI> among the <HI>Chronological Characters.</HI>
They serv'd as so many Annals, by which the
<HI>Grecians</HI> computed not only their own, but also
the Histories of other Nations. But they were
not presently acquainted with this Way of Com∣putation;
and as the Use of it in <HI>Chronology</HI>
was only accidental, we must inquire into the
more immediate Design of these Solemnities.
As to the Original of these, and the other prin∣cipal
Games of <HI>Greece,</HI> they were instituted in
Honour of the Gods and Heroes; they were
therefore term'd <HI>Sacred,</HI> and are to be consi∣der'd
<PB N="140" REF="171"/>
as a Part of Religion. But besides
the Spirit of Religion, and the Curiosity
for publick Shews, there were other Politick
Motives, which engaged the Exercise of them.
It was thought convenient to re-assemble from
time to time, and by these common Sacrifices,
to re-unite, if possible, so many different States,
independent of each other, and less separated
by the Distance of their Habitations, than the
Diversity of their Interests: So that one main
End of these Meetings, was to debate, and set∣tle
every thing relating to the publick Peace,
and Reputation. As to the Sports themselves,
they were agreeable to the lively <HI>Genius</HI> of the
People, who thought with good reason, they
could not in times of Peace addict themselves
to Exercises more honourable, or useful. For
besides that by this means they made their
Limbs strong, active and supple, they also ac∣custom'd
their Thoughts to the Desire of Con∣quest.
It was a kind of <HI>School,</HI> or <HI>Military
Apprenticeship,</HI> in which their Courage found a
constant Employment: And the Reason why
the Victory in these Games was attended with
such extraordinary Applause, was that their
Minds might be quicken'd with great and no∣ble
Prospects, when in this Image of War, they
arriv'd to a Pitch of Glory, approaching in
fome Respects, to that of the most famous Con∣queror.
They thought this sort of Triumph
one of the greatest Parts of Happiness, of
which human Nature was capable: Upon
which Occasion, when <HI>Diagoras</HI> had seen his
Sons crown'd in the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games, one of
his Friends made him this Compliment, <HI>Now,</HI>
Diagoras, <HI>you may die satisfy'd; for you can't
<PB N="141" REF="172"/>
be a God.</HI> Not to describe all the Exercises
perform'd there, we may form a general No∣tion
of them from the Remembrance of our
own <HI>Justs</HI> and <HI>Tournaments</HI> which held a mid∣dle
place between a Diversion, and a Combat:
But the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games were attended with a
much greater Pomp and Variety; and not only
all <HI>Greece,</HI> but other neighbouring Nations were
in a manner drain'd, to furnish out the Appea∣rance.
When they were thus throughly esta∣blish'd,
they were continu'd without Inter∣mission,
so long as <HI>Greece</HI> enjoy'd any degree of
Liberty; and even after that was lost, some
bring them down to the three hundred and
twelfth Year of <HI>Christ,</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Con∣stantine the Great;</HI> and <HI>Cedrenus</HI> carries them
about eighty Years lower, making the 293d
the last <HI>Olympiad.</HI></P>
<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> But to return to <HI>Athens,</HI> upon <HI>Alcmaeon</HI>'s
Death the People took another Occasion to
change the Government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3252.</NOTE> They had already
made such considerable Abatements both in
Title and Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 7. 1.</NOTE> that they were a sufficient
Awe upon their Prince's Conduct: But the
Name of <HI>Perpetual</HI> now began to sound harsh;
and therefore they confin'd their <HI>Archons</HI> to
the Space of ten Years.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The De∣cennial</HI> Archons. Charops the first.</NOTE> The first of this <HI>De∣cennial</HI>
Creation, was <HI>Charops,</HI> Brother of <HI>Alc∣maeon,</HI>

<HI>Aesimedes, Clidicus, Hippomenes, Leocrates, Ap∣sander,
and Eryxias;</HI> of whom there is nothing
particular, but that <HI>Hippomenes</HI> was depos'd for

or depos'd before his time was expir'd, some
have substituted <HI>Tlesias</HI> to compleat his Term

on, and it seeming not improbable that
this <HI>Tlesias</HI> has been mistaken for <HI>Lysias,</HI> men∣tion'd

Affairs of Moment were transacted in his Name.
He had the Care of a great Part of their Su∣perstition,
and kept a sort of <HI>Ecclesiastical Court,</HI>
wherein all Causes were determin'd betwixt
Men and their Wives, Parents and Children,
Kindred and Neighbours; as also concerning
Wills, Legacies, Dowries and Inheritances. He
had particularly the Care of Orphans, to ma∣nage
their Estates, and assign them Guardians;
and took the first Cognizance of several pub∣lick
Actions. The Second <HI>Archon</HI> had the
Name of <HI>King:</HI> He manag'd another Part of
their Superstition; his Office being to assist in
the Celebration of several Festivals, to decide
all Disputes between the <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Sacred Fa∣milies,</HI>
and punish all Impiety and Prophana∣tion
<PB N="143" REF="174"/>
of the Holy Mysteries in general. Be∣sides
which, he determined several Causes both
Civil and Criminal, or sometimes referr'd them
to other Courts. The Third was call'd <HI>Pole∣marchus;</HI>
who besides the Charge of some Re∣ligious
Customs, had that of War committed
to him, from whence he had his Name. He
had a great Command in the Armies abroad,
and at home exercis'd the same Jurisdiction
over Strangers, that the <HI>Archon</HI> did over the
Citizens. The other Six had the common
Name of <HI>Thesmothetae.</HI> They were in the Na∣ture
of a Court of <HI>Appeal,</HI> upon Complaints of
false Accusation, Calumniating, or Bribery:
And before them were brought all Causes be∣tween
the Citizens and Strangers, and Contro∣versies
about Trade and Merchandize. They
had properly the Custody of the Laws, and
were plac'd as a <HI>Barrier</HI> between the other Ma∣gistrates,
and the People; having Power to op∣pose the enacting of any Law, which were ap∣parently
against the Interest of the Common-wealth.
These were their distinct Offices;
and as to what equally concern'd them in gene∣ral,
they had all the Power of punishing Male∣factors
with Death: They had a joint Com∣mission
for constituting some sort of Magi∣strates,
and deposing others, when upon an En∣quiry
into their Behaviour, and by the Suf∣frages
of the People, they were declar'd un∣worthy
of their Office. All together they had
Authority to assemble the People, as the Kings,
and other <HI>Archons</HI> had done upon any emer∣gent
Occasion. And as a Recompence for
their Services, they were free from all Taxes
exacted of other Citizens for the building of
<PB N="144" REF="175"/>
<HI>Men of War;</HI> which was an Immunity never
granted to any besides themselves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Creons <HI>the first Annual</HI> Archon.</NOTE> The first of these <HI>Annual Archons</HI> was <HI>Creon,</HI> who en∣ter'd
upon his Charge in the second Year of
the twenty third <HI>Olympiad.</HI> From him they
were continu'd regularly: So that whatever In∣terruptions
the State suffer'd through Faction
and Usurpation; yet was this the constant set∣tled
Form of Government, so long as <HI>Athens</HI>
had the least Remains of Life and Liberty.</P>
<P>But this Liberty, of which <HI>Theseus</HI> laid the
Foundation, wanted several Improvements, be∣fore
it could receive its finishing Stroke. The
People had gain'd something by every Altera∣tion:
And the Power of the Magistrates thus
limited, was too weak to bridle such captious
unsettled Tempers, especially without the help
of Laws, both to guide and protect them in
the Execution of their Offices. For it does
not appear, that <HI>Greece</HI> had yet any written
Laws, but was govern'd altogether by the Sentence
of the Magistrate. This occasion'd dai∣ly
Disputes and <HI>Quarrels;</HI> so that they could
come to no Agreement either as to the Reli∣gious,
or Civil Administration, every Trifle
affording Matter to alarm the Ignorant, and in∣cense
the Factious. Of which we have an Instance in the Attempt of <HI>Cylon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The At∣tempt of</HI> Cylon.</NOTE> who had won
the Prize in the <HI>Course</HI> at the Celebration of
the thirty fifth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> and bore a considera∣ble
Sway in the City. He took Advantage
from these Disturbances to affect the Sove∣reignty,
and in Order to it bad seiz'd the Ca∣stle,
where he stood a Siege 'till he was almose
starv'd, and then with his Brother made hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Escape. His Companions in the mean while
<PB N="145" REF="176"/>
fled for Refuge to the Image of <HI>Minerva;</HI> but
the Magistrates having entic'd them with
hopes of Pardon, to quit their Sanctuary, put
most of them to Death. This was afterwards
reckon'd so heinous an Affront to Religion,
that the City was look'd upon as polluted, and
obnoxious to the Wrath of the <HI>Goddess,</HI> 'till the
Authors were banish'd: And even after that,
the Memory of this Murder was several times
reviv'd, and made use of to keep up a Faction
in the City. This Story is generally plac'd a∣bout
the forty fifth <HI>Olympiad:</HI> But that time
may relate more properly to the Expiation of the
Murder, than to the Attempt of <HI>Cylon,</HI> which
seems to have happen'd a considerable while
sooner.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Athens</HI> continu'd several Years at a
Stand, 'till at last her Calamities made her wise.
She found by degrees, that true Liberty con∣sists
in the due Exercise of Justice and Reason,
and that an intire Subjection to them was not
to be establish'd, but by the Authority of a
Legislator.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Draco pre∣scribes Laws.</NOTE> To this purpose she pitch'd upon
<HI>Draco,</HI> who was <HI>Archon</HI> in the thirty ninth <HI>Olym∣piad;</HI>
a Man of Wisdom and Virtue, but rigid
even beyond a Sense of Humanity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> Of this
severe Stamp were his Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3380.</NOTE> of which he pub∣lish'd
many,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ol. 39. 1.</NOTE> leaving the Execution of them
chiefly to the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>Ephetae,</HI> which he
new-modell'd for that Purpose. He punish'd
almost every trivial Offence with Death, ma∣king
no Distinction between the stealing of a
Cabbage, or an Apple, and Sacrilege, or Mur∣der:
Wherefore it was laid of his Laws, <HI>That
they were writ not with Ink, but with Blood:</HI>
And he himself being ask'd, <HI>Why he made Death
<PB N="146" REF="177"/>
the Punishment of most Offences?</HI> reply'd, <HI>Small
Crimes deserve that, and I have no higher for
the greatest.</HI> This rigid Notion of his seems
to have been the Original of the Doctrine of the
<HI>Stoicks,</HI> which prevail'd so much in after Ages.
But these Laws met with the Fate of all vio∣lent
things; for their Severity soon brought
'cm into Disuse. Yet still this gave the Poor
no Relief against the Oppression and Usury of
the Rich, with which they were almost ex∣hausted.
So that the Commons hated the No∣bility,
the Nobility fear'd the Commons; and
nothing but Desolation seem'd to attend the
State.</P>
<P>At this time happen'd some Commotions be∣tween
<HI>Athens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Lesbos.</NOTE> and <HI>Mitylene</HI> of <HI>Lesbos,</HI> about
<HI>Sig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um</HI> a Town of <HI>Troas,</HI> to which both Sides
laid equal Claim. The <HI>Athenians</HI> under the
Conduct of <HI>Phrynon,</HI> and the <HI>Lesbians</HI> under
<HI>Pittacus</HI> maintain'd the Contest for some time
with various Success; 'till the two Generals ha∣ving
agreed to decide it in their own Persons,
<HI>Pittacus</HI> entangled his Adversary in a N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phrynon <HI>kill'd.</HI></NOTE>
which he had hid under his Shield,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 43 3</NOTE> and kill'd
him: Which Stratagem seems to have been the
Foundation of the <HI>Retiarii</HI> among the <HI>Romans.</HI>
The <HI>Athenians</HI> afterwards renew'd their Pre∣tensions
under the Conduct of <HI>Pisistratus,</HI> who
took <HI>Sig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um,</HI> and plac'd his Natural Son <HI>He∣gesistratus</HI>
over it. But he being molested in
his Government, the Business was referr'd to
<HI>Periander</HI> of <HI>Corinth;</HI> and adjusted by his De∣termination,
that both Sides should keep what
they were then actually possess'd of. This lat∣ter
War seem to have been confounded with
the former, because <HI>Herodotus</HI> speaks of the
<PB REF="178"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="147" REF="179"/>
War in general, as of one single Action under
the Conduct of <HI>Alcaeus</HI> the <HI>Lyrick</HI> Poet, with∣out
mention either of <HI>Phrynon,</HI> or <HI>Pittacus.</HI>
As for <HI>Pittacus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pittacus.</NOTE> he generally passes for a Ty∣rant
of <HI>Mitylene;</HI> but his Conduct has suffici∣ently
vindicated that Part of his Character.
For he took the Government rather in Oppo∣sition
to others, than out of any private Am∣bition;
and held it no longer, than the Neces∣sities
of the State requir'd. He made several
good Laws; and gave so many other Proofs of
his Moderation and Prudence, that he is rank'd
among the <HI>Seven Wise Men.</HI> His chief Adversary
was <HI>Alcaeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcaeus.</NOTE> who bore a great Sway in the Af∣fairs
of <HI>Mitylene,</HI> and valu'd himself more up∣on
the Character of a Soldier, and Patriot, than
that of a Poet; tho' his Pretensions to either
are not so well grounded. For in the Action
between the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Mitylenians</HI> he ran
away, and left his Shield to the Enemy: And
<HI>Strabo</HI> assure us, that, notwithstanding his Cry
against Tyranny, he lay himself under a Suspi∣cion
of the same Designs, which he oppos'd
in others. His Writings were all in the <HI>Ly∣rick</HI>
Strain; his Stile close, magnificent, and
correct; and tho' he sometimes descends to
Sports, and Love, yet he always shews himself
capable of greater Subjects. <HI>Horace,</HI> (with
whom he is usually compar'd) ascribes to him
the Invention of the <HI>Barbiton;</HI> tho' some at∣tribute
the same Honour to <HI>Terpander,</HI> and o∣thers
to <HI>Anacreon.</HI> He has also been compli∣mented
with the <HI>Golden Lyre,</HI> in Relation to
those Pieces, which he writ against Tyranny.
Since we have mention'd him, we musl not
omit his great Contemporary <HI>Sappho▪</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sapp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o.</NOTE> who
<PB N="148" REF="180"/>
was also a Native of <HI>Mitylene,</HI> and flourish'd
about the forty fourth <HI>Olympiad.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Archilo∣chus.</NOTE> Tho' she
was by no means a Beauty, yet <HI>Alcaeus</HI> was a
great Admirer of her: But she was so far from
receiving his Addresses, that one Day, when
he told her, <HI>He had something to say to her,
but that he was asham'd to bring it out,</HI> she gave
him an handsom Repulse, telling him, <HI>That if
it were fit for her to hear, he would not have
kept it in so long.</HI> Her Cruelty to him is the
more remarkable, because she was so excessively
amorous, that her Character suffers very much
from the Charge of her unnatural Intrigues with
some of her own Sex. Her famous Gallant was
<HI>Phaon;</HI> whose Unkindness in abandoning her,
as it gave occasion to some of her finest Pieces,
so it afterwards was the Cause of her Death.
She had Wit enough to supply a great many
other Defects: And 'tis easie to judge from
the few Remains we have of her, with what
unaffected Force, and Sweetness she touch'd
the Passions, and how deservedly she has gain'd
the Title of the <HI>Tenth Muse.</HI> Near this time
flourish'd <HI>Archilochus</HI> born in the Island <HI>Paros</HI>
about the twenty ninth <HI>Olympiad.</HI> He general∣ly
passes for the Author of the <HI>Iambick</HI> Verse:
But Poems of this Nature were of a more anci∣ent
Date; and <HI>Homer</HI> himself is mention'd as
Author of a Piece in that Strain, call'd <HI>Margites.</HI>
So that <HI>Archilochus</HI>'s Title to this Invention
seems to be grounded chiefly upon the remark∣able
Virulency, and Success of his Invectives
against <HI>Lycambes;</HI> who having promis'd him
his Daughter, and after the Match was agreed
on, refus'd to give her, the Poet handled him
so severely, that he and his Daughter both
<PB N="149" REF="181"/>
hang'd themselves. His way of Writing was
strong and nervous, yet short, and glittering,
and enliven'd with abundance of Wit; but it
had such a Tincture of Gall and Malice, that
he professes, <HI>He could spare neither Friend, nor
Foe.</HI> But of those, who conspir'd at this time
to advance the <HI>Lyrick Muse,</HI> none have been
mention'd with more Honour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stesicho∣rus.</NOTE> than <HI>Stesichorus.</HI>
He was born in the thirty seventh <HI>Olympiad,</HI> at
<HI>Himera</HI> a City of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and receiv'd his Name
from the Memory of his being the first, who
taught the <HI>Chorus</HI> to dance to the <HI>Lyre.</HI> We
have no particular Catalogue of his Writings:
But the distinguishing Character of them is a
Majestick Gravity; by which he sustain'd with
his <HI>Lyre</HI> all the Weight and Grandeur of an <HI>E∣pick</HI>
Poem; insomuch that some have put him in
Competition with <HI>Homer.</HI> But withal it is
own'd he was not so great a Master of his <HI>Ge∣nius,</HI>
as he; and it was chiefly upon account
of the Looseness, and Luxuriancy of his Stile,
that he would not bear the Comparison. He
was also a Man of the first Rank for Wisdom
and Authority among his Fellow-Citizens, and
seems to have had a great hand in the Trans∣actions
between that State, and the Tyrant <HI>Pha∣laris.</HI>
As he had all along vigorously oppos'd
him, so when he had carry'd his Design, <HI>Ste∣sichorus</HI>
was the principal Man in encouraging a
Revolt. Soon after which the Tyrant seiz'd
him, and kept him, 'till he could invent a
Death answerable to his Crime. This gave him
an Opportunity of acquainting himself with
his Person and Excellencies, which turn'd his
Fury into the greatest Love and Esteem: And
he was ever after so far from entertaining any
<PB N="150" REF="182"/>
Suspicion of him himself, that he was remark∣ably
zealous in vindicating him to others. He
dy'd about the eightieth Year of his Age at
<HI>Catana;</HI> whose Inhabitants were so sensible of
the Honour his Relicks did their City, that
they resolv'd to keep them in Defiance of the
<HI>Himerians,</HI> who were no less obstinately bent
upon the Recovery of 'em, tho' at the Ex∣pence
of a War. The Contest seems to have
been adjusted by <HI>Phalaris,</HI> who told his Sub∣jects,
that where-ever the Poet was bury'd,
yet upon account of his Birth, and Life, he
would still be reckon'd an <HI>Himerian.</HI>
'Tis true this Account of him depends upon the
single Authority of <HI>Phalaris</HI> himself; and tho'
the <HI>Epistles,</HI> which pass under his Name,
should not be genuine, they serve however to
confirm the Esteem, and Character this Poet
bore with Antiquity.</P>
<P>VI. We left the <HI>Athenians</HI> under a dismal
Prospect of relapsing into their first Disorders;
which made them have Recourse to fresh Pre∣cautions.
For the Remedy prescrib'd by <HI>Dra∣co,</HI>
was it self in the Nature of a Disease: In∣somuch
that they, who had the Execution of
his Laws, found it necessary to slacken the
Reins, tho' it was not safe to quit them. In
Order therefore to find out such <HI>Mediums,</HI>
as were able to recompence the Law for what∣ever
they took from it, they cast their Eyes on
<HI>Solon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solon.</NOTE> a Man not biass'd by any Party, and
whose great Wisdom and Integrity, together
with his extraordinary Meekness, had gain'd
him an universal Love and Esteem. But that
which first brought him into Repute, was the
<PB N="151" REF="183"/>
Recovery of the Island <HI>Salamis</HI> his Native
Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Recovers</HI> Salamis.</NOTE> lately revolted from the <HI>Athenians</HI> to
the <HI>Megareans;</HI> which had several times been
attempted, but with such ill Success, that it
was made Death to stir any more in it. <HI>Solon</HI>
under a Pretence of Madness, took the Liberty
of making another Motion; and acted his Part
so well, that by the Oddness of his Gesture, as
well as the Warmth and Strength of his Reason∣ing,
he brought the People to consent to another
Expedition: And under his Conduct they sur∣priz'd
the Island, by a Stratagem of Dressing their
young Men in Womens Clothes. <HI>Solon,</HI> upon
the Success of this and other Enterprizes, was
chosen <HI>Archon</HI> in the third Year of the forty
sixth <HI>Olympiad;</HI> and besides the Power of his
Office, was authoriz'd by a general Voice to
regulate their Magistrates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reforms the State.</HI></NOTE> Assemblies, Courts,
and Senates; to appoint their Number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> Times
of Meeting, and what Estates should capacitate
them for such and such Offices;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3410.</NOTE> in short,
to dissolve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 40. 3</NOTE> or continue any of the present Consti∣tutions,
and give them such a new Set of Laws,
as should appear to him most proper for the
better modelling of the State.</P>
<P>There was so much <HI>Pride, Avarice,</HI> and <HI>Fa∣ction</HI>
at this time in the City, that <HI>Solon</HI> seem'd
unwilling to undertake so difficult a Task. They
were chiefly divided into three Parties; one of
which inclin'd to an <HI>Oligarchy,</HI> another to a
<HI>Democracy,</HI> and a third, to ballance the other
two, was for a <HI>mixt Government</HI> between
both. But the common People now ripe for
Sedition, claim'd an equal Division of the pub∣lick
Lands in the Hands of the Rich; and were
making themselves a Head to do it by Force,
<PB N="152" REF="184"/>
when <HI>Solon</HI> appear'd with full Power to redress
their Grievances, and quell these Commotions.
To strengthen his Authority, the chief Men
offer'd him the <HI>Tyranny;</HI> and his Friends told
him, <HI>He might easily by his Conduct and Mo∣deration
change so odious a Name into that of a
Kingdom.</HI> In answer to them. <HI>A Tyran∣ny,</HI>
says he, <HI>is a very fair Spot, but it has no
Way to go out at:</HI> And therefore he absolutely
refus'd it, as not so consistent with his Scheme
of Reformation.</P>
<P>The first Step he made, was in Favour of the
<HI>Commons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Releases Debtors.</HI></NOTE> to release all Debtors by an express Law, call'd <HI>Seisacthia,</HI> or the taking off a Bur∣den:
And to do it with the least Injury he
could to their rich Creditors, he rais'd the Va∣lue
of Mony in some moderate Proportion.
But his Management in this Affair had like to
have prov'd of very ill Consequence: For having
communicated his Design to some of his
Friends, they made their Advantage of it, by
taking up vast Sums of Mony, and purchasing
Land with it; and when the Act was publish'd,
they refus'd Payment of the Mony, and yet
kept their Estates. The People could not but
fancy <HI>Solon</HI> at the Bottom of this Contri∣vance,
'till he clear'd himself by remitting his
Debtors five, or as others say, fifteen Ta∣lents.
To make the Rich some further A∣mends,
he assign'd to them, exclusive of the
People, all Honours, Offices and Employments;
tho' at the same time he took Care to allay
their Power, by giving every private Citizen a
Privilege of voting in the <HI>Great Assembly</HI>
of the whole Body of the State. Which how∣ever
<PB N="153" REF="185"/>
inconsiderable it might appear, was soon
found to be of vast Consequence. For it being
permitted any Man, after the Determination of
the Magistrates, to appeal to the People, hence
it came to pass, that Causes of the greatest
Weight and Moment were brought before
them. And as they were not always on the
right Side, for this Reason, <HI>Anacharsis,</HI> whom
the Fame of the <HI>Grecian Sages</HI> had drawn from
the extreme Parts of <HI>Scythia,</HI> told <HI>Solon,</HI> He
<HI>wonder'd to see Wise Men propose Causes, and
Fools determine them.</HI> This Philosopher at a∣nother
time was saying to him, <HI>That written
Laws were like Cobwebs; they held fast the Poor
and Weak, but the Rich aud Powerful easily
broke through them.</HI> To which <HI>Solon</HI> reply'd,
<HI>Both Parties will obey the Laws so long as it is
the Interest of neither to break them.</HI> To say
the Truth, his chief Care was of the <HI>Commons:</HI>
But yet knowing the danger of committing
things of the highest Importance to the giddy
unthinking Multitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Regulates the Courts of Justice.</HI></NOTE> he instituted the <HI>Great
Council of Four Hundred,</HI> an hundred out of
each Tribe; whose Business it was, carefully to
inspect all Matters before they were brought
into the <HI>General Assembly</HI> of the People. And
as for the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Areopagus,</HI> he was so far
from suppressing it, that he gave the Members
a more extensive Jurisdiction; making these
two <HI>Councils</HI> the <HI>Anchors</HI> of the Common-wealth,
whereby it would be less liable to be
toss'd by Tumults, and become a Prey to such
as had Knavery enough to design, and Cun∣ning
and Eloquence to entice the People to
their own Destruction. We must not omit a∣nother
famous Court call'd the <HI>Heliastick Coun∣cil,</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="186"/>
from their sitting open and expos'd to the
<HI>Sun.</HI> It consisted of Judges chosen out of the
Body of the People, from fifty to two thou∣sand,
according as the Exigency of the Causes
requir'd, of which they determin'd many, and
those generally of the highest Consequence.</P>
<P>This was his Regulation of the Principal
Courts of Justice, with his Provisions in gene∣ral
for the State.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His other Miscellany Laws.</HI></NOTE> And as for particular Insti∣tutions, he first repeal'd all <HI>Draco</HI>'s Laws, ex∣cept
those concerning Murder, and prescrib'd others better suited to the Nature of Offences.
He provided particularly against Idleness; in∣somuch
that a Son was not oblig'd to maintain
his Father, if he had not brought him up to
some Trade. He first gave leave to make Wills,
whereas before the nearest of Kin inherited of
Course: But by this he insinuated, that Friend∣ship
and Affection were stronger Ties than
Blood. He ordain'd, that Women should have
no Portions, which he thought serv'd only to
make them a Prey, and destroy'd the Ends of
Marriage. In the Case of an Heiress, he ob∣lig'd
him who had marry'd her, to use her as his
Wife, at least three times a Month; and if
he prov'd insufficient, she might lye with his
nearest Kinsman: In other Cases, any one
might kill an Adulterer if he was taken in the
Act. Common mercenary Prostitutes were
in a great measure allow'd of, for the satisfying
of Lust; but they were not to keep Company
with modest Women, and, as a Badge of Di∣stinction,
wore flower'd Garments; neither
were the Men, who were notorious for fre∣quenting
their Company, allow'd to speak in
publick. He who forc'd a Free-Woman,
<PB N="155" REF="187"/>
was fin'd a hundred Drachms: But this Law∣giver
was so indulgent in the Use of Boys,
that he debarr'd only the Slaves from it, as too
great a Privilege. He admitted none into any
part of the Magistracy under thirty Years of
Age; and when they were enter'd, was more
particularly severe in punishing their Failings;
insomuch that it was Death to an <HI>Archon</HI> to be
taken Drunk. 'Tis observable he made no Law
against Parricide, as not imagining any would
be guilty of it. These were the chief of his Or∣dinances,
and many more might be mention'd;
of which one is very remarkable, that he
branded those with Infamy, who stood Neuter
in a Sedition; as not thinking they could ever
make good Citizens, who express'd no Fellow-feeling
for their Country. He also reform'd
the <HI>Calendar,</HI> reducing the Year into such a
Form, as was most agreeable to the Motion of
the Sun. Having compleated the Body of the
Laws themselves, he took due Care for the
Execution of them, that the Citizens might
not pretend Ignorance in what they were to do,
or to avoid. To this End, Transcripts of them
were publickly expos'd in the City for every
one to peruse; at least, so that any one might
have Recourse to them upon Occasion: And
it was the Business of the <HI>Thesmothetae</HI> to Re∣vise
them carefully, and repeat them distinctly
once a Year. For the further Information of
the People, when they were summon'd to the
<HI>General Assembly,</HI> they had Notice given 'em
of the subject Matter of the Debate, and time
to prepare themselves accordingly. <HI>Solon</HI>'s last
Care was to perpetuate his Laws: And least through the Connivance of the Magistrates
<PB N="156" REF="188"/>
they should in time be neglected, like those of
his Pedecessor, he caus'd the Senate to take a
solemn Oath to observe them; and every one
of the <HI>Thesmothetae,</HI> vow'd that if he violated
any of them, he would dedicate a Golden Sta∣tue
of equal weight with himself to the <HI>Del∣phian
Apollo:</HI> The People he also oblig'd to
observe 'em a hundred Years.</P>
<P>Thus he finish'd his new Settlement; where∣in
his chief Aim was to poise one Part of the
State with the other: So that what the Com∣mons
wanted in Wealth and Honour, was suf∣ficiently
made up to them in their Share of the
Government. This was reducing things, as
near as he could, to an exact Equality: And
indeed it was no easie Task to find out a Cure
for such a Complication of Distempers, where
the Weakness of those he had to do with,
would hardly permit him to make Use of suit∣able
Remedies. And therefore when one ask'd
him, if he had prescrib'd good Laws to the
<HI>Athenians, Yes,</HI> said he, <HI>as good as they are ca∣pable
of receiving.</HI> Since therefore they would
admit of no Government, but a <HI>Democracy,</HI> he
form'd his Laws according to that Model. It
did not indeed come up to that of <HI>Sparta</HI> laid
down by <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> and the Difference is easily
accounted for, from the Temper of the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI>
which was too delicate, and capricious,
to be brought to those grave and regular Au∣sterities;
and without considering the great
Sway the People bore in the Execution of the
Laws, the Laws themselves were more nume∣rous
and confus'd, and could not therefore be
so religiously observ'd, as they were at <HI>Sparta.</HI>
Yet such this Establishment was, as restor'd
<PB N="157" REF="189"/>
the Love of Labour and Husbandry, made
way for Commerce, put the <HI>Athenians</HI> into a
Condition of being rich at home, and powerful
abroad, and with the Rules of Justice, Order,
and Discipline, serv'd to tame and polish a Peo∣ple
bred up in Liberty, and persuaded that
Force and Violence were the only Preservatives
against Oppression.</P>
<P>VII. This new Constitution, tho' generally
well receiv'd, yet was not free from Censure:
And therefore <HI>Solon,</HI> to prevent all cavilling and
tampering with him about his Laws, got leave
to travel for ten Years, in hopes they would in
that time be establish'd by Custom. But whilst
he was abroad taking a Survey of <HI>Aegypt, Cyprus,</HI>
and <HI>Lydia, Athens</HI> was again imbroil'd by the
old Faction of the three contending Parties a∣bout
the Form of the Common-wealth.
The poorer Sort inclining most to a <HI>Democracy,</HI> were
headed by <HI>Pisistratus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pisistra∣tus</NOTE>. descended from King <HI>Co∣drus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pisistra∣tus.</NOTE>
and by the Mother's Side related to <HI>Solon;</HI>
a Man made up of Design and Artifice,
yet seemingly open, tractable, and without Pas∣sion.
He profess'd nothing so much as a Desire
of Equality, and Aversion to Change; and
manag'd the Disguise with something so mo∣dest
and affable in his Behaviour, and such a
soft and voluble Tongue, that it was not easie
to resist the Appearance of so much Merit.
Nor indeed did any Body suspect him, but
<HI>Solon,</HI> who being return'd, soon perceiv'd he
was setting up for himself; and endeavour'd to
take him off first by fair Means, often decla∣ring
both to himself and others, <HI>That if it were
not for his Desire of Rule, he knew no Body better
<PB N="158" REF="190"/>
form'd for a good Man, and a good Citizen,</HI>
But <HI>Pisistratus</HI> resolv'd to make use of the good
Opinion of those, who had thrown themselves
upon his Protection; and having wounded
himself, went in his Chariot into the Market-place,
where he complain'd of having been bar∣barously
assaulted for his good Intentions to
the Publick; and demanded a Guard might be
assign'd him for the Defence of his Person,
<HI>Solon,</HI> upon this Exploit, compar'd him to <HI>Ʋ∣lysses</HI>
in <HI>Homer,</HI> but told him, <HI>He did not act
the Part right; for his Design,</HI> says he, in cut∣ting
himself, was to deceive his Enemies, but
Yours is against your Fellow-Citizens. He also
upbraided the People with their Stupidity, tel∣ling
them, <HI>That for his own Part, he had Wit
enough to see through this Design, and Courage
enough to oppose it.</HI> But <HI>Pisistratus</HI> his Party
prevail'd; and having obtain'd a Guard of fifty
Men, he insensibly increas'd the Number, 'till
by their Assistance he possess'd himself of the
Castle, and with that of the Sovereignty.</P>
<P>This gave a general Alarm,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Usurps the Govern∣ment.</HI> A. M.</NOTE> and <HI>Solon</HI> was not
wanting in his repeated Efforts to the People, telling 'em, <HI>They might with more Ease indeed
have crush'd the Tyranny in the Bud;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3443.</NOTE> but that
<HI>it would be more glorious now to pluck it up by
the Roots.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 54. 4</NOTE> But the Surprize struck such a
Damp into their Spirits, that no Body offer'd
to back his Remonstrances. On the contrary,
they ask'd him, <HI>To what he himself trusted, that
he ventur'd to speak so boldly?</HI> To whom he
reply'd, <HI>My Age.</HI> Finding all ways ineffe∣ctual
to move them, he retir'd, saying, <HI>He
had at least the Satisfaction of having dischar∣ged
his Duty to his Country, and the Laws.</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="191"/>
Soon after, that he might not seem to counte∣nance
this Change, he quitted <HI>Athens;</HI> and
tho' <HI>Pisistratus</HI> importun'd him to return, he
chose rather to spend the Remainder of his Life
in <HI>Lydia, Cilicia</HI> and <HI>Cyprus.</HI> In the former of
these Places he had the famous Conference with
<HI>Craoesus</HI> about Happiness; the Result of which was,
<HI>That no Man could be accounted happy before he
dy'd. Croesus,</HI> who had invited him to admire
the Pomp and Grandeur of his Court, dismss'd
him with a Contempt of his Ignorance, or ill
Manners: But being afterwards taken Prisoner
by <HI>Gyrus,</HI> and order'd to be burnt alive, he
cry'd out thrice upon <HI>Solon;</HI> of which <HI>Cyrus</HI>
demanding the Reason, <HI>Croesus</HI> told him all
that had formerly pass'd between 'em, and that
now he found his Words verify'd. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was
so affected with the Relation, that he not only
set him at Liberty, but contracted a Friend∣ship
with him much to the Honour of <HI>Solon,</HI>
who by this means had preserv'd one King,
and at the same time instructed another. In
<HI>Cilicia</HI> he founded a City call'd from himself
<HI>Soleis,</HI> and planted in it some <HI>Athenians,</HI> whose
Language being corrupted by that of the Coun∣try,
they were said to <HI>Soloecise.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solon's <HI>Death:</HI></NOTE> Soon after he
dy'd in <HI>Cyprus</HI> about the fifty fifth <HI>Olympiad,</HI>
the eightieth Year of his Age, and the se∣cond
of <HI>Pisistratus's</HI> Government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Cha∣racter.</NOTE> Besides the
Wisdom, and Integrity of this great Man, which
have appear'd through the whole Course of his
Laws, and Administration, he was Master of
many other distinguishing Qualities. He had
so good a <HI>Genius</HI> for Rhetorick, that from him
<HI>Cicero</HI> dates the Rise of Eloquence in <HI>Athens.</HI>
He also made several successful Attempts in Po∣etry;
<PB N="160" REF="192"/>
and <HI>Plato</HI> says, it was only for want of du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Application, that he did not come to dispute
the Prize with <HI>Homer</HI> himself. But his most
shining Talent was the Study of Politicks, and
Morality; wherein he succeeded so well, as to
obtain one of the first Places among the <HI>Sages</HI> of
Antiquity.</P>
<P>We must not dismiss his Character, without
mentioning several of his Contemporaries, who
by displaying a Fund of Reason, and good
Sense, laid the Foundation of those Improve∣ments,
which afterwards made <HI>Greece</HI> the <HI>Me∣tropolis</HI>
of Science and Philosophy. These were
the <HI>Seven Wise Men</HI> properly so call'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Seven Wise Men.</HI></NOTE> which
Attribute was given to them in the third Year
of the forty ninth <HI>Olympiad.</HI> Their Names
were <HI>Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Solon, Cleobulus,
Myson,</HI> and <HI>Chilon.</HI> As most of them had a
Share in the Government of Cities, and Com∣mon-wealths,
they directed the Tenour of
their Precepts to the good Establishment of the
several Societies they liv'd in. These they en∣deavour'd
to inculcate by short and compre∣hensive
Sentences, which were only general
Maxims of Civil Prudence, and Morality, with∣out
Order or Connexion, concerning natural
Justice and Honesty, Piety to Friends and Re∣lations,
Zeal for the Publick, and other common
Offices of Life. Out of this loose Collection,
each of them assum'd to himself some one Sen∣tence
more remarkably expressive, in the Nature
of a <HI>Motto.</HI> But the first of the Seven had
more refin'd Notions than the rest, carrying
his Thoughts from Matters of immediate Use,
and Practice, to Speculation.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="193"/>
And here it may be requisite to make a more
strict Enquiry into the Birth of <HI>Philoso∣phy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Birth of Philosophy.</HI></NOTE>
which is certainly to be dated from this Period of
Time, and is almost universally assign'd to
<HI>Greece.</HI> Not but that some Parts of it were of a
more early and foreign Extraction, being chiefly
such, as ow'd their Original to Chance, or Ne∣cessity.
Thus the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm'd the Prin∣ciples
of <HI>Geometry</HI> from the Division of their
Harvests, when their Land-marks had been swept
away by the Inundation of the <HI>Nile.</HI> The
<HI>Assyrians</HI> from the Advantage of an open
Champaign Country, a clear Sky, and abun∣dance
of Leisure, naturally betook themselves
to the Contemplation of the Stars, and from
thence laid the Foundation of <HI>Astronomy:</HI> A∣mong
them the <HI>Chaldaeans</HI> refin'd upon these
Speculations, and improv'd them into Notions of
<HI>Astrology.</HI> And the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> drew a fur∣ther
more certain and beneficial Use from them
respect of their Navigation; wherein they
succeeded so well, that they were the first who
found out, that there was a fixt Point towards
the Pole, by which Pilots might steer with
Safety. The most gene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al and extensive Parts
of Learning the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> laid claim to: Tho'
we have nothing certain of the first Planters of
Civility among them, especially before their fa∣mous
<HI>Hermes Trismegistus;</HI> and even of him
those Remains, which are still extant, are look'd
upon as a Supposititious Mixture of <HI>Aegyptiab,
Platonick</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Doctrine. It
seems probable, that they deriv'd a considerable
Share of their Knowledge from their long and
free Intercourse with the first People, the <HI>Jews.</HI>
For besides the time of their Captivity among
<PB N="162" REF="194"/>
them, <HI>Aegypt</HI> was excepted from that general
Abhorrence, they were commanded to express
for most of the other <HI>Gentiles.</HI> But whatever
Foundation they had laid of the Arts and Sci∣ences,
it is certain they did not make a suitable
Progress in them. For as they were a People
grosly Superstitious, the Priests taking Advan∣tage
of their Weakness, work'd up their Ob∣servations
on Nature into a sort of <HI>Theology;</HI>
and by veiling them under <HI>Symbols,</HI> and <HI>Hiero∣glyphicks</HI>
from the Apprehensions of the Vulgar,
turn'd every thing into Mystery and Religion,
They had their Design, which was to beget a
Reverence in the Peoples Hearts towards them∣selves:
But this secret Management was far
from making any real Advancement in Philoso∣phy.
It serv'd however to give them a mighty
Reputation in the World; which put the <HI>Gre∣cians,</HI>
who were of a very active and inquisi∣tive
Temper, upon diving into their Mysteries.
With this Design they made several Voyages to
them; and notwithstanding this <HI>aegyptian
Darkness,</HI> made some Discoveries, which they
carry'd home with them, and which serv'd as
the Ground-work for an ample Superstructure.
Government being the principal Care of all
Nations, <HI>Solon, Lycurgus,</HI> and others bent their
Studies this way, and made no further Use of
their Travels, than to enrich their Schemes with
Laws and State-Policies. Others, who were
less engaged in State-Affairs, turn'd their
Thoughts upon more subtle, and refin'd Spe∣culations
concerning Nature, and the Works of
Providence. The first, who made any success∣ful
Attempts this way, at least the first we have
any certain Account of, was <HI>Thales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thales</NOTE>. who was
<PB N="163" REF="195"/>
born in the thirty fifth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> and was thought
to be originally a <HI>Phaenician,</HI> but living at <HI>Miletus</HI>
of <HI>lonia,</HI> was call'd the <HI>Milesian.</HI> He introduc'd
into <HI>Greece</HI> the Elements of <HI>Geometry</HI> and <HI>Astro∣nomy;</HI>
and form'd several plausible Notions of the Theory of
the <HI>Ʋniverse,</HI> which he con∣ceiv'd
to be animated by a <HI>Supreme Being,</HI> as
the <HI>Soul</HI> of it, and the Author of all natural
Motion. He had also some saint Idea of the
Immortality of the Soul. To him is ascrib'd
the Invention of taking the Heighth of the <HI>Pyra∣mids</HI>
by their Shadows. He divided the Ce∣lestial
Sphere into five Circles: He first ob∣serv'd
the Solstices, and Aequinoxes; and disco∣ver'd
the Reason of Eclipses, which before
were look'd upon as supernatural Presages of
some publick Calamity. His particular Tenet was,
that Water is the first Principle of all Natural
Bodies. Having enrich'd his Country with
Treasures of this kind, he pass'd for the <HI>Origi∣nal
Founder of Philosophy;</HI> and dy'd about nine∣ty
Years old, as he was sitting a Spectator at
the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games. His Dactrine was soon
propagated by <HI>Anaximander,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anaxi∣mander.</NOTE> and <HI>Anaximence,</HI>
both <HI>Milesians,</HI> and his Scholars; the former of
which made such considerable Improvements,
that he is reckon'd the more immediate <HI>Founder
of the</HI> Ionick <HI>Sect.</HI> In opposition to his Master's
Opinion concerning Water, he made Infinity
the <HI>Ʋniversal Principle.</HI> He distinguish'd the
four Elements, discover'd the Obliquity of
the <HI>Zodiack</HI> and form'd the first Draught of
a general System, by placing the Earth in the
Centre of the <HI>Ʋniverse.</HI> These were the Steps
these first Heroes made in Philosophy: And
tho' they did not arrive to any distinct Know∣ledge,
<PB N="164" REF="196"/>
so as to take off that Veil, which was
drawn over most of the Works of Providence
yet it redounds very much to their Glory, that
they trac'd out the Way so far, as to make them
the Subject of a more severe and accurate En∣quiry.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Ionick</HI> Philosophy was soon Eclips'd
by another Sect of a much greater Extent and
Duration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pythago∣ras.</NOTE> which was call'd the <HI>Italick,</HI> and
establish'd in the Person of <HI>Pythagoras:</HI> Of
whom we may give some general Account,
without entering upon the many Contradicti∣ons
and Absurdities, which have sully'd both
the Life and Doctrine of this great Man. He
was born at <HI>Samos</HI> towards the forty seventh <HI>O∣lympiad.</HI>
He study'd first under <HI>Hermodamas</HI>
a Grammarian, and then improv'd himself un∣der
<HI>Pherecydes</HI> of <HI>Syrus</HI> one of the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> a
Man of great Repute for his Wisdom, and
the first, as <HI>Cicero</HI> says, who asserted the Im∣mortality
of the Soul. He travell'd young in∣to
<HI>Aegypt;</HI> where being well recommended by
<HI>Polycrates,</HI> he found an easie Access to the
Priests: Tho' as they were naturally Jealous
and Uncommunicative, they enjoin'd him all
the Austerities of their Order, in hopes to de∣ter
him from penetrating too far into their
Mysteries. But his Curiosity carry'd him
through the strictest Course of Probation; and
having in five and twenty Years enrich'd him∣self
with great Variety of Learning, he return'd
home. Where being under some Apprehen∣sions
from the Tyranny establish'd at <HI>Samos,</HI> he
remov'd first to <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Crotona</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> where he spent
the Residue of his Life; and was at last either
<PB N="165" REF="197"/>
kill'd, or starv'd to Death by means of a Tu∣mult
rais'd by one <HI>Cylon,</HI> because <HI>Pythagoras</HI>
finding him to be a profligate young Man,
wou'd not admit him into his School. The
Inhabitants of <HI>Crotona</HI> had formerly by their
Industry and Courage gain'd such a Reputati∣on,
that it was said proverbially of them, <HI>The
last of the</HI> Crotoniates <HI>is the first of the</HI> Greci∣ans.
But having suffer'd a great Loss in a Bat∣tel
with the <HI>Locrians,</HI> they were sunk into a
State of Sloth and Effeminacy at the time
when <HI>Pythagoras</HI> settled among them. Who
thinking it a Task worthy his Care to restore
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to a sense of their former Merit, exerted
himself in the Nature of a Lawgiver, and pre∣scrib'd
to them such convincing Rules of Re∣ligion,
Justice, Temperance, and other Virtues,
that they easily assented to every thing he said,
and the Magistrates themselves courted him to
accept a Share in the Administration. After
this Reformation of their Manners, he began
to make open Profession of his Wisdom, in or∣der
to establish his Sect. But thinking the
Title of <HI>Wise,</HI> which his Predecessors had as∣sum'd
to themselves, too arrogant, he modestly
declin'd it, and was the first that call'd himself
a <HI>Philosopher,</HI> or <HI>Lover of wisdom,</HI> He enjoin'd
his Scholars Silence for five Years, to make
himself heard with more Attention and Re∣spect.
He had learn'd in <HI>Aegypt</HI> to give to all
his Instructions an Air of Gravity and Mystery:
Yet to avoid being too Enigmatical, he chose to
deliver most of them in <HI>Symbols;</HI> which un∣der
a Sense that was plain and simple, inclu∣ding
another that was wholly figurative, he
endeavour'd by them neither to <HI>divulge</HI> his Doctrine,
<PB N="166" REF="198"/>
nor to <HI>conceal</HI> it; for these short Expres∣sions
held a middle place between the <HI>Hierogly∣phick</HI>
and the common way of Discourse, and
were therefore thought most proper for his
Design, which was to <HI>disclos</HI> the Truth with∣out
<HI>prophaning</HI> it. His common Method of
teaching was by <HI>Geometry, Numbers,</HI> and <HI>Mu∣sick;</HI>
by the first of which he explain'd mate∣rial
and sensible things, and by the two latter,
intellectual, Not that he fancy'd there was
any intrinsick Virtue in Numbers, but that
these just Proportions, as they serv'd to divide
and explain things, so they made his Do∣ctrine
appear more profound, than really it was,
As to his <HI>Theology,</HI> he was the first who brought
into <HI>Greece</HI> the true Name of <HI>God,</HI> which he
communicated to his Disciples under the Name
of <HI>Quaternion,</HI> or <HI>Number of Four;</HI> For the
<HI>Quaternion</HI> of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> is allow'd to be the
<HI>inutterable</HI> Name, or the <HI>Jehovah</HI> of the <HI>He∣brews.</HI>
He had also been brought up in a
Belief of the Soul's Immortality: But because
he could not conceive how it should exist after
its Separation from the Body, this put him up∣on
establishing his Opinion of the <HI>Metempsy∣chosis,</HI>
or Transmigration of Souls; and for this
Reason he forbad the eating of Flesh, or using
it in Sacrifices. He was the first who taught
the Principles of <HI>Physicks:</HI> And tho' we cannot
expect from him any compleat System, yet
there was in the whole Course of his Enquiries
something more solid and regular, than what
had hitherto been deliver'd. From hence it
was, that his Sect soon arriv'd to be the only
one of a fix'd Reputation; and out of it came
all the Philosophers, who flourish'd for the
<PB N="167" REF="199"/>
Space of near four hundred Years, and who
were divided into so many different Sects.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Athens, Pisistratus</HI> did not
enjoy his Usurpation much above three Years,
before he was displac'd by <HI>Megacles,</HI> and <HI>Ly∣turgus,</HI>
the Heads of the two other Factions;
who also in five Years more were a Means of
his Restitution. For not agreeing among them∣selves,
<HI>Megacles</HI> promis'd to restore him upon
Condition he would marry his Daughter.
With this Design, they dress'd up <HI>Phya</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all
Woman in Armour to counterfeit <HI>Minerva,</HI>
and putting her in a Chariot, sent to prepare
the Citizens for her Reception, telling 'em, the
<HI>Goddess</HI> was come in Person in behalf of <HI>Pisi∣stratus:</HI>
Which being acted with wonderful
Assurance, succeeded so well, that they imme∣diately
ador'd the Deity, and re-instated her
<HI>Favourite.</HI> In about ten Years <HI>Megacles</HI> re∣viv'd
the Quarrel upon a Pretence that <HI>Pisi∣stratus</HI>
slighted his Daughter, and having mar∣ry'd
her only to regain the Sovereignty, did
not use her as his Wife. He being inform'd
of their Designs against him, retir'd voluntari∣ly
into <HI>Eretria,</HI> a City of <HI>Euboea:</HI> And after
ten Years more having form'd an Alliance with
the <HI>Argives,</HI> and <HI>Thebans,</HI> got <HI>Marathon</HI> a
Town of <HI>Attica,</HI> into his Hands. From thence
he march'd against <HI>Athens,</HI> routed those who
came out against him, and that they should
not rally, sent 'em word, <HI>They had nothing to
fear from him, if they would go Home, and be
quiet.</HI> By this Means he got Possessoion the
third Time, and establish'd himself by his
Mony and Allies, and by keeping his Enemies
Sons as Hostages 'till his Death, which hap∣pen'd
<PB N="168" REF="200"/>
not long after.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pisistratus <HI>his Death,</HI></NOTE> During the whole course
of his Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> which was thirty three Years,
including the sixteen of his Exile, he demean'd
himself with such Moderation and Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3476.</NOTE> as
might have put lawful Sovereigns to the Blush.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 63. 1</NOTE>
Of which we have an Instance in <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
that being accus'd of a Murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And Cha∣racter.</HI></NOTE> tho' it was in
the time of his Tyranny, he went to plead his
Cause before the <HI>Areopagites;</HI> but his Accuser
did not appear. He not only carry'd it fair
with <HI>Solon,</HI> but paid a sort of Reverence to his
Person, and his Laws; to which he made some
few Additions, by providing for the Mainte∣nance
of maim'd Soldiers, to oblige the Army,
and ordering the Country to be kept in good
Tillage. The Pretence of this last, was to
prevent Idleness, and promote Husbandry; but
the real Design was to disperse the People, as
the surest Method to take away all Occasion of
plotting and caballing, and to support a precari∣ous
Government. Besides his natural Talent
for Oratory, he had more acquir'd Learning,
than was generally to be met with in those
Times; and express'd a particular Esteem of
it, by erecting the first publick Library. He
was certainly Master of many excellent Quali∣ties;
and perverted them no further, than as
they stood in Competition with Empire. So that
the People had nothing to object against him,
but his having a Power greater than the Laws;
and by his not exerting that Power, when it
was in his Hands, he almost conquer'd the A∣version
the <HI>Athenians</HI> had conceiv'd for the
<HI>Royalty.</HI> Upon these Accounts he was deser∣vedly
oppos'd to other Tyrants, and Usupers:
And <HI>Cic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro</HI> thought it no Reflection upon <HI>Ju∣lius
<PB N="169" REF="201"/>
Cesar,</HI> to call him <HI>The</HI> Pisistratus <HI>of</HI> Rome.
In another Place, doubting with himself how
that Emperor would use his good Fortune af∣ter
the Battel of <HI>Pharsalia, We are uncertain yet,</HI>
says he to his Friend <HI>Atticus, whether the Fate
of</HI> Rome <HI>will have it, that we groan under a</HI>
Phalaris, <HI>or enjoy our selves under a</HI> Pisistratus.</P>
<P>He left his three Sons, <HI>Hippias, Hipparchus,</HI>
and <HI>Thessalus,</HI> in joint Possession of the Go∣vernment,
the supreme Authority being lodg'd
in <HI>Hippias,</HI> as the eldest. <HI>Thessalus</HI> is represent∣ed
as bold and headstrong: Tho' <HI>Diodorus</HI> makes
him the most deserving of the three; and says
he ingratiated himself with the People by
quitting his Share in the Tyranny. But the
Accounts of the two former being more clear,
and full, we must confine our selves to their
Stay. They continu'd the Laws, and Magi∣strates
as they found them; adorn'd the City;
and exacted only the twentieth Part of the
publick Revenue: They agreed so well a∣mong
themselves, and pursu'd their Father's
Methods so succesfully, that <HI>Athens</HI> had still

of.</P>
<P>Here we must leave them in the quiet Pos∣session
of <HI>Athens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of <HI>Samos</HI> un∣der Poly∣crates.</NOTE> to take a View of another Ty∣ranny
erected about the same time in <HI>Samos.</HI>
The Government of this Island had hitherto
been in the Hands of the People: <HI>Herodotus</HI>
indeed mentions a former King under the Name
of <HI>Amphicrates,</HI> but without the time or other
Circumstances of his Reign; and therefore we
may look upon <HI>Polycrates</HI> as the first, of whom
we have any certain Account. He having u∣surp'd
the Government, at first divided it with
<PB N="170" REF="202"/>
his two Brothers; 'till having murder'd one,
and banish'd the other, he became absolute,
and establish'd himself by an Alliance with <HI>Aegypt.</HI>
It was a Maxim with him, <HI>That he gra∣tify'd
his Friend more by restoring what he had taken,
than if he had never taken any thing from
him.</HI> Wherefore having made himself Master
of a Fleet of a hundred Sail, he harass'd all the
Country about him; made his Name formida∣ble
both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia;</HI> and had such an
incredible Glut of good Fortune to encourage
his Attempts, that from oppressing his Subjects
and Neighbours, he aspir'd to the Sovereignty
of <HI>Greece.</HI> In the mean while an exil'd Party
of the <HI>Samians,</HI> tho' they were an <HI>Athenian</HI> Co∣lony,
address'd themselves to the <HI>Lacedaemoni∣ans</HI>
for their Assistance. For <HI>Sparta</HI> by her
strict Discipline, and the late successful Effects
of it in the <HI>Messenian</HI> Wars, had so far got the
start of her Neighbours in Military Glory,
that the first Application of any State in Di∣stress,
was generally made to her. The <HI>Lace∣daemonians</HI>
gave them a satisfactory Answer, as
thinking it necessary to stop the Tyrant's Pro∣gress:
So that whatever specious Pretences they
form'd to palliate the Business, they resolv'd to
pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed against him as a common Enemy.
Accordingly they arriv'd at <HI>Samos</HI> with a great
Fleer, and invested the City: But attempting
to storm it, were repuls'd with Loss; and ha∣ving
lain sorty Days before it, were forc'd to
raise the Siege, and return home. Those <HI>Sa∣mians,</HI>
who were in the Conspiracy, when they found they
had miscarry'd in this Enterprise,
retir'd into <HI>Crete,</HI> and built <HI>Cydonia:</HI> But <HI>Poly∣crates</HI>
was soon after betray'd into the Hands

of the <HI>Persians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of</HI> Poly∣crates.</NOTE> and nail'd to a Cross. The <HI>Sa∣mians</HI>
were so remiss in asserting their Freedom

with a Body of <HI>Persians,</HI> possess'd himself of
the Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Syloson.</NOTE> and treated the Inhabitants with
great Severity. Yet still they admitted his Son
<HI>Aeaces;</HI> and tho' they recover'd their Liberty
by the Expulsion of this latter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aeaces.</NOTE> it was not
owing so much to their own Endeavours, as to
the Juncture of Affairs at that time, which
wrought a general Change of Government
throughout all the Cities of <HI>Ionia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Platae∣ans <HI>Alliance with</HI> Athens.</NOTE> Notwithstand∣ing
the ill Success of the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> against
<HI>Samos,</HI> they were still importun'd and courted:
And the <HI>Plateans</HI> were the next,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> who implor'd
their Protection against the continual Insults of
their Neighbours the <HI>Thebans.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3484.</NOTE> But they ex∣cus'd
themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 65. 1</NOTE> as lying at too great a di∣stance
to relieve 'em, and referr'd them to the
<HI>Athenians:</HI> Who accordingly enter'd into a strict
Alliance with them; which for many Years
after prov'd a great Eye-fore to the <HI>Thebans,</HI>
and their Confederates.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Athens,</HI> this Harmony in
the State, after it had lasted about fourteen
Years from the Death of <HI>Pisistratus,</HI> was de∣stroy'd
by an Accident, which befell <HI>Hip∣parchus.</HI>
He was a Man of Wisdom and Learn∣ing,
but being naturally amorous, fell in Love
with a young Man call'd <HI>Harmodius;</HI> and find∣ing
after many Sollicitations he would not com∣ply,
to be reveng'd of him, offer'd Violence
to his Sister. <HI>Harmodius</HI> acquainted his Friend
<PB N="172" REF="204"/>
<HI>Aristogiton</HI> with the whole Affair; who being
also a passionate Admirer of him, they form'd
a Conspiracy against <HI>Hipparchus,</HI> and the Ty∣ranny.
They fix'd the Execution of their Des∣igns
upon the Feast of <HI>Panathenaea,</HI> because at
that time they might go arm'd without Suspi∣cion;
and taking their Opportunity, rush'd in
upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hipparchus <HI>kill'd</HI></NOTE> and stabb'd him, but were them∣selves
also slain in the Tumult. <HI>Hippias</HI> to pre∣vent
further Disorders, got all those disarm'd,
whom he could any way suspect as Accompli∣ces
in the Enterprise; and tho' he was suffici∣ently
exasperated at his Brother's Death, he
did not think this a proper time to resent it.
But not knowing how far this Accident might
contribute to the Subversion of the Tyranny,
he thought it necessary to strike a Terror into
his Subjects, before they had gain'd too far
upon him. So that from that time he became
cruel and imperious, and endeavour'd to esta∣blish
himself by Measures quite contrary to
those he had hitherto pursu'd.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Athenians</HI> being more thoroughly
rous'd by this violent Proceeding, thought it
time to throw off the Yoke, when they felt
the Weight of it. The chief who stirr'd in it,
were the <HI>Alcmaeonidae,</HI> a part of <HI>Megacles's</HI> Fa∣ction,
descended from <HI>Nestor</HI> by <HI>Alcmaeon,</HI> and
driven out of <HI>Messenia</HI> by the <HI>Heraclidae.</HI> They
distrusting their own Strength, corrupted the
<HI>Pythia</HI> to engage the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> in their
Quarrel; so that whatever Business the <HI>Spar∣tans</HI>
consulted about at <HI>Delphi,</HI> the Oracle con∣stantly
propos'd to them the setting <HI>Athens</HI> at
Liberty. By which repeated Advice, they
were forc'd to undertake it as a Point of Reli∣gion;
and accordingly sent an Army under the
<PB N="173" REF="205"/>
Command of <HI>Anchimolius.</HI> The <HI>Pisistratidae</HI> ha∣ving
Notice of it, procur'd a thousand Horse
out of <HI>Thessaly;</HI> who falling in upon the <HI>Spar∣tan</HI>
Camp, flew the General with many others,
and beat the rest to their Ships. The <HI>Lacedae∣monians</HI>
afterwards sent another Army by Land
under <HI>Cleomenes</HI> the Son of <HI>Anaxandrides,</HI> who
engaging with the <HI>Thessalian</HI> Horse, kill'd about
forty, and put the rest to Flight. After which
the <HI>Pisistratidae</HI> retir'd into the City, and order'd
their Children to be convey'd away privately
But the <HI>Spartans</HI> happening to intercept them,
would accept of no other Ransom, than that
their Parents should within five Days leave <HI>At∣tica:</HI>
Which accordingly they did; and <HI>Hip∣pias</HI>
went immediately to <HI>Lampsacus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hippias <HI>expelled.</HI></NOTE> (whole
Prince had marry'd his Daughter) having not
possess'd the Tyranny above four Years after

of which <HI>Pisistratrus</HI> and his Sons were actually

was immediately owing to the Alcmaeonidae but
<HI>Harmodius,</HI> and <HI>Aristogiton</HI> were so far in∣srumental
in it, that, because they began the
Attempt, and fell a Sacrifice to the Cause, the
<HI>Athenians</HI> erected Statues to their Memory,
with a Decree that their Names should never be
given to any Slaves. They also consecrated a
Lioness without a Tongue, in Honour of <HI>Leae∣na
Aristogiton's</HI> Mistress; who being put to
the Torture by <HI>Hippias,</HI> to force her to a Di∣scovery
of the Plot, she bit off her Tongue, and
spit it in the Executioner's Face, that she might
not have it in her Power to confess.</P>

<P>I. <HI>GREECE</HI> was no sooner settled un∣der
her several new Forms of Go∣vernment,
but the whole Power of
<HI>Asia</HI> threatned her with unavoidable Destructi∣on.
This was the famous <HI>Persian</HI> War; where∣in
<PB N="176" REF="207"/>
tho' <HI>Athens</HI> was principally concern'd, the
other States were oblig'd for their common In∣terest
and Safety to unite, as they did in the
<HI>Trojan</HI> War: And as that first general Expedi∣tion
put an end to the <HI>Infancy</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> so
did this to its <HI>Minority.</HI> But before we pass
into <HI>Asia,</HI> we must take a View of <HI>Athens</HI> and
<HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> with the most remarkable Trans∣actions
that happen'd before the coming down
of the <HI>Persian,</HI> being chiefly such as contribu∣ted
towards it.</P>
<P>The Regal Power was no sooner abolish'd in
<HI>Athens,</HI> but the People wrested too great a
Share of the Government into their Hands: So
that things were carry'd by Tumult and Facti∣on;
and they were seldom free from as great,
or worse Disorders, than. those they complain'd
of under their Kings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clisthenes <HI>and</HI> Isagras.</NOTE> The first Contest after
the Expulsion of the <HI>Pisistratidae,</HI> was between
<HI>Clisthenes</HI> and <HI>Isagoras,</HI> two principal Men
of the City, who were both grasping at the fame
Power, which they had so lately been very in∣strumental
in suppressing. <HI>Clisthenes</HI> finding his
Party too weak to carry it with a high Hand,
fell in with the People, and from an Invader
of their Liberties, set up for a Patriot. To
this end he chang'd the Names of the Tribes,
encreasing the Number from four to ten; and
added an hundred to the <HI>Council of four hun∣dred,</HI>
ordering fifty to be chosen annually out
of each Tribe. But his most popular Act was
the Ostracism;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Ostracism.</HI></NOTE> which by fome is carry'd as
high <HI>Theseus;</HI> but more generally granted to
have been introduc'd about this time, and
ascrib'd to <HI>Clisthenes</HI> as the Author, who is also
recorded as the first Example of his own Law.
<PB N="177" REF="208"/>
The manner of performing it was, that every
Citizen not under sixty Years old should give
in a Name written upon a <HI>Tile</HI> or <HI>Oyster-shell,</HI>
(from whence it had its Name) and he, upon
whom the Majority fell, was pronounc'd ba∣nish'd
for ten Years. The Pretence of this
Institution was not to punish those as Offenders,
who had deserv'd well of the State, but only to
blunt the Edge of Envy by removing the Ob∣ject;
and for this reason their Estates were pre∣serv'd
intire for them 'till their Return. But
the real Design was to take off all such as for
Reputation., Quality, Riches, or Eloquence
were esteem'd above the common Level: Which
was a barbarous Discouragement to all sorts of
Merit and Ambition, and yet judg'd necessary
in a State, where all were to be of equal Credit
and Authority. And therefore it obtain'd not
only in <HI>Athens,</HI> but also in <HI>Argos, Megara,
Miletus,</HI> and <HI>Syracuse,</HI> tho' under different
Names, and with several Restrictions. The
last who suffer'd this way, was <HI>Hyperbolus</HI>
an idle rascally Fellow, who made it his Busi∣ness
to furnish Scandal for the Stage, and was
made use of by the People, as a necessary Tool
to asperse Men of Interest and Reputation. It
happen'd that <HI>Alcibiades, Nicias,</HI> and <HI>Phaeax</HI>
being of different Factions, and bearing a great
Sway in the State, lay open to the Envy of
the inferior Citizens; who therefore would
have one of them banish'd. Which they ha∣ving
notice of, united their Parties, and turn'd
the Ostracism upon <HI>Hyperbolus,</HI> who had set the
People against 'em. But this was thought such
a Contempt put upon the Thing, that upon his
Account it was laid aside. Isagoras being by
<PB N="178" REF="209"/>
these Methods over-power'd at home, betook
himself to <HI>Cleomenes</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> King, with
whom he had contracted an Intimacy during the
War with <HI>Hippias.</HI> He espous'd his Quarrel,
and having got <HI>Clisthenes,</HI> and the Heads of his
Party banish'd the City, march'd thither with
an Army, and expell'd seven hundred Families
more of those, who were most likely to make
head against him, but did it under a Pretence
of their not having expiated the Death of <HI>Cy∣lon.</HI>
His next Attempt was to dissolve the
Senate, and commit the Administration to three
hundred of <HI>Isagoras</HI>'s Faction: But this being
strongly oppos'd both by Senate, and People,
he seiz'd the Castle, where he suffer'd himself
for two days to be besieg'd. On the third <HI>Isa∣goras,</HI>
and <HI>Cleomenes</HI> with his <HI>Spartans</HI> had
leave to depart; but the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who had
been assisting in this Enterprize, were imprison'd,
and put to Death. After which <HI>Cli∣sthenes</HI>
with the seven hundred Families was re∣call'd;
who finding it not safe to make any fur∣ther
Attempts upon the Liberty of <HI>Athens,</HI> re∣stor'd
the <HI>Democracy,</HI> as settled by <HI>Solon.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Athenians</HI> knowing how they had
incens'd the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Athe∣nians <HI>seek Alliance with</HI> Per∣sia.</NOTE> thought it necessa∣ry
to be upon their Guard, and therefore sent
to enter into Alliance with the <HI>Persian,</HI> who
made that a Pretence to demand of 'em <HI>Earth</HI>
and <HI>Water,</HI> the usual Tokens of Homage and
Subjection, by which was yielded up the So∣vereignty
and Propriety of all included in those
Elements. The Ambassadors finding they
would not treat with them upon any other
Terms, consented to it, but were mightily
blam'd at their Return, as having acted so much
<PB N="179" REF="210"/>
below the Dignity of the State: And indeed
this servile Compliance may be consider'd as
one remote Cause of the <HI>Persian Descent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cleomenes</HI> in the mean while was levying
Forces to make another Attempt in behalf of
<HI>Isagoras;</HI> with which he march'd into <HI>Attica,</HI>
having contracted with the <HI>Boeotians</HI> and <HI>Chal∣cidians</HI>
of <HI>Euboea</HI> to second his Attack in other
Places at the same time. The <HI>Athenians</HI> thus
distress'd on all Sides, chose first to meet the
<HI>Peloponnesians</HI> lying in <HI>Eleusis;</HI> and just as they
were making up to them, the <HI>Corinthians</HI> mov'd
with the Injustice of their Cause drew off,
and were seconded by <HI>Demaratus</HI> the other <HI>Spar∣tan</HI>
King. The rest following their Example,
the whole Army was dispers'd without any
Action. But the <HI>Athenians</HI> reek'd their Re∣venge
upon the <HI>Boeotians,</HI> killing and taking
many of 'em Prisoners; and passing over the
same Day into <HI>Euboea,</HI> did the like by the <HI>Chal∣cidians.</HI>
The <HI>Thebans</HI> in this Extremity contracted
a League with <HI>Aegina,</HI> a small Island, but ve∣ry
rich, powerful at Sea, and a profess'd Ene∣my
to <HI>Athens.</HI> While the <HI>Aeginetans</HI> were in∣festing
the Coasts of <HI>Attica,</HI> the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>
took this Opportunity to renew their Quarrel
with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> whom, since the Recove∣ry
of their Liberty had put'em into a flourish∣ing
Condition, they began to look upon as Ri∣vals.
The best way of reducing 'em, they
thought would be to place a Tyrant over them;
and finding they could do no good with <HI>Isago∣ras,</HI>
they sent for <HI>Hippias,</HI> with a Design to re∣instate
him: But debating the Matter among
their Consederates, it was violently oppos'd,
particularly by <HI>Sosicles</HI> a <HI>Corinthian,</HI> who in∣veighing
<PB N="180" REF="211"/>
against this, and all other Sorts of Ty∣ranny,
nothing more was done in it. So that
<HI>Hippias</HI> return'd into <HI>Asia;</HI> and having got an
Interest in the <HI>Persian</HI> Court, made it his Busi∣ness
to incense them against <HI>Athens,</HI> in hopes by
their Assistance to be restor'd: And he so far
prevail'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Grounds of the</HI> Persian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> that when the <HI>Athenians</HI> sent to vin∣dicate
their Proceedings, telling 'em, <HI>That</HI> Hip∣pias,
<HI>as being an Exile, ought not to have any
Credit, or Countenance among them,</HI> the Answer
they receiv'd, was, <HI>That if they would be safe,
they must admit</HI> Hippias. <HI>Athens</HI> having so
lately thrown off the Yoke, had too lively a
Sense of her past Calamities, to accept the Con∣dition,
and resolv'd rather to suffer the last Ex∣tremity,
than open her Gates again to a Ty∣rant.
Which Resusal is to be consider'd as a
principal Circumstance in the Quarrel between
<HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>II. But to set these Affairs in a clear Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of the Les∣ser Asia</HI></NOTE>. we must begin our Account of 'em in <HI>Ionia,</HI>
where the War was kindled, and from whence
it spread in its Progress, and was never through∣ly
extinguish'd, but in the intire Subversion of
the <HI>Persian Monarchy.</HI> The <HI>Ionians</HI> with the
<HI>Aeolians, Carians,</HI> and others stretching along
the Sea-Coast of the <HI>Lower Asia,</HI> came to form
a very Considerable Body of M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d went un∣der
the general Name of the <HI>Asiatick Grecians,</HI>
being govern'd chiefly by their own Laws, with
a full Enjoyment of their Liberty for about
five hundred Years from their first settling in
those Parts. After which they were over∣topp'd
by the Growth of <HI>Lydia,</HI> and made Tri∣butary
to <HI>Croesus▪</HI> who subdu'd 'em; 'till <HI>Ly∣dia</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="212"/>
it self soon after falling into the Hands of
the <HI>Persian,</HI> they were also assign'd over with it,
as a Part of the <HI>Lydian</HI> Territory, having Go∣vernors
plac'd over their several Cities, whom
they call'd their Tyrants. But as an half-con∣quer'd
People, they were ready upon all Oc∣casions
to rebel, and made several unsuccessful
Struggles both in <HI>Cyrus</HI>'s time, and after him:
The <HI>Ionians</HI> particularly, who bore the great∣est
Sway among 'em, and made as remarkable a
Figure as any of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Colonies, could
not brook this being sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fted about from one to
another, and therefore let no Advantage slip,
which they could hope to improve into the
Recovery of their Liberty.</P>
<P>That which favour'd their Designs at this
time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Darius <HI>hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Scythian <HI>Expedi∣tion</HI></NOTE>. was an Expedition of <HI>Darius Hystaspes</HI>
the <HI>Persian</HI> King, against the <HI>Scythians:</HI> In or∣der
to which he had laid a Bridge over the
<HI>Ister,</HI> and transported a numerous Army, lea∣ving
the <HI>Ionians,</HI> and their Neighbours at the
Bridge, to secure his Retreat, and assist him
with their Shipping. Whilst, <HI>Darius</HI> was ad∣vanc'd
into the Country, the <HI>Ionians</HI> fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding
him, and his whole Army at their Disposal,
fell into a Debate, whether they should exe∣cute
their Charge, or by breaking down the
Bridge, leave them to the Fury of the Enemy.
Besides their own Inclinations for the latter,
the <HI>Scythians</HI> persuaded 'em to return home;
assuring 'em, that <HI>Darius</HI> would never more be
in a Capacity of doing 'em Good or Harm.
But the chief Encourager of this Motion, was
the famous <HI>Miltiades</HI> an <HI>Athenian,</HI> descended
from <HI>Codrus,</HI> whose Ancestors had retir'd du∣ring
the Tyranny of <HI>Pisistratus,</HI> and left him
<PB N="182" REF="213"/>
at this time in the Government of the <HI>Thracian
Chersonesus.</HI> He represented the Easiness, and
Consequence of such an Action, telling 'em,
<HI>This was their time to free themselves from the</HI>
Persian <HI>Yoke.</HI> And they had certainly follow'd
his Advice, if <HI>Histiaeus,</HI> Tyrant of <HI>Miletus</HI> a
principal City of <HI>Ionia,</HI> had not strongly oppo∣sed
it, urging to the other Tyrants, <HI>That their
Power was too precarious to subsist of it self, un∣less
supported by the King their Master; and that
therefore their Safety depended intirely upon his.</HI>
Which Argument sway'd so much with 'em,
that the Project fell; and <HI>Darius</HI> being oblig'd
to retire out of <HI>Scythia,</HI> they conducted him
safe into <HI>Asia.</HI> Who, that he might make up
in one Country, the Losses he sustain'd in ano∣ther,
left <HI>Megabyzus</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> with eighty
thousand Men to reduce <HI>Thrace,</HI> and other Ma∣ritime
Places; after which he thought <HI>Mace∣don</HI>
would fall of Course. This General soon
executed the King's Order; and then dispatch'd
seven principal Men of the Army to <HI>Amyntas.</HI>
King of <HI>Macedon,</HI> to demand Earth and Wa∣ter.
Who doubting his own Strength, not on∣ly comply'd
with their Demands, but gave 'em
a splendid Entertainment, in the heighth of
which, when they were heated with Wine,
they desir'd <HI>Amyntas</HI> to crown so magnificent
a Feast with the usual Freedoms of Gallantry,
and that as an Earnest of their being Welcome,
the Wives and Daughters of the <HI>Macedonians</HI>
might be admitted into the Company. No
sooner were the Ladies come into the Room,
but the <HI>Persians</HI> behav'd themselves with great
Immodesty towards them: Upon which <HI>A∣lexander,
Amyntas</HI>'s Son, desir'd his Father in
<PB N="183" REF="214"/>
regard of his Age and Gravity to retire, and
leave him to keep 'em within Bounds, or else
to chastise their Insolence. Accordingly he
takes the Women out of the Room, under Pre∣tence
of dressing 'em up to appear more agree∣able,
and in their stead brings in the same Num∣ber
of young Men in Female Apparel with
Daggers under their Cloaths; who watching
their Opportunity, when the Strangers began
to be free with 'em, stabb'd every Man of 'em
with their Retinue. <HI>Megabyzus</HI> hearing no∣thing
of his Messengers, sent <HI>Bubares</HI> with part
of the Army to make a strict Enquiry into the
Business: But he was taken off by Marriage
with <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Sister, and so the Matter fell.
The next Year <HI>Otanes</HI> being sent as Successor
to <HI>Megabyzus,</HI> reduc'd the Cities <HI>Chalcedon</HI>
and <HI>Byzantium,</HI> with the Island <HI>Lemnos,</HI> and
other places of less Note. <HI>Darius</HI> himself was
now retir'd to <HI>Susa,</HI> and with him <HI>Histiaeus;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Histiaeus,</NOTE>

the King did not think it safe to leave him be∣hind;
and therefore took him by fair Means,
under a Pretence of using him as his Coun∣sellor
and Companion. But <HI>Histiaeus</HI> saw too
far into his Designs, to be easie under this
Change, which he look'd upon but as a more
specious sort of Imprisonment; and therefore
made it his Business to excite the <HI>Ionians</HI> to re∣bel,
in hopes that for his Interest in that
Country, he should be sent to reduce them,
and from thence pick out some Opportunity of
setting up for himself.</P>
<P>To this end he sent secret Instruction
to <HI>Aristagoras</HI> his Deputy at <HI>Miletus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and</HI> Ari∣stagoras, <HI>excite a Rebellion.</HI></NOTE> who was
<PB N="184" REF="215"/>
easily tempted to that which he was going to
undertake of himself.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> For having propos'd to
<HI>Darius</HI> the Conquest of the <HI>Cyclades</HI> Islands in
the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3502.</NOTE> and miscarry'd in his first At∣tempt
upon <HI>Naxos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 69. 3</NOTE> he thought of encouraging
the <HI>Ionians</HI> to revolt, as a means to secure his
Interest in those Parts, and prevent his being
call'd to Account for Mismanagement. His first
Step was to abandon his own Tyranny; where∣by
having sufficiently oblig'd the <HI>Milesians,</HI>
they assisted him in procuring the same Liber∣ty
for the other Cities: By which plausible
Methods he soon had the whole Country at
his Command. And to strengthen himself by
Sea, he surpriz'd the <HI>Persian</HI> Fleet, of which
he was lately Admiral in the Enterprise of
<HI>Naxos.</HI> But not having any sufficient Force
to oppose to the whole <HI>Persian</HI> Army, which
he knew would soon be upon him, he went to
<HI>Sparta;</HI> where he set forth the Riches of <HI>Asia,</HI>
with the Weakness of the Inhabitants, in hopes
to engage <HI>Cleomenes</HI> to join with him in the
Conquest of <HI>Persia.</HI> But not prevailing, he
went from thence to <HI>Athens,</HI> where he us'd
the same Arguments, adding, that the <HI>Milesians</HI>
as an <HI>Athenian</HI> Colony, might very reasonably
expect their Assistance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> had at this time met with
such very rough Treatment from the <HI>Persian</HI>
in the Business of <HI>Hippias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And engage the</HI> Athe∣nians <HI>in the Quar∣rel.</HI></NOTE> that they readily
embrac'd this Opportunity of shewing their
Resentment; and accordingly mann'd out
twenty Ships, to which the <HI>Eretrians</HI> of <HI>Eu∣boea</HI>
added five more. <HI>Aristagoras</HI> with these
joint Forces fell upon the <HI>Persian</HI> Frontiers, and
surpriz'd <HI>Sardis,</HI> the Capital City of Lydia. <HI>Ar∣taphernes,</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="216"/>
Brother to <HI>Darius,</HI> who resided here
as Vice-Roy of <HI>Lydia</HI> and <HI>Ionia,</HI> was glad to
secure himself in the Castle, from whence he
beheld the Citizens slaughter'd, and the Town
in Flames. The <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Lydians</HI> at last
getting into a Body, charg'd the Enemy, and
drove 'em to the Sea-side, killing many in the
Pursuit, and forcing the rest to shelter them∣selves
in <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and other neighbouring Ci∣ties.
The <HI>Athenians</HI> could by no means be
persuaded to rally after this Defeat; so that
what they had done, serv'd only to incense the
<HI>Persian,</HI> without any Honour, or Advantage to
themselves. But the <HI>Ionians</HI> knowing they
were gone too far to retreat, resolv'd to push
on their Fortunes without them: And having
taken <HI>Byzantium</HI> with other Towns upon the
<HI>Hellespont,</HI> drew over <HI>Cyprus</HI> with a great part
of <HI>Caria</HI> into their Alliance. But a sudden
Stop was put to their Progress by a sharp Con∣flict
at <HI>Cyprus,</HI> wherein the two Generals <HI>Ar∣tybius</HI>
the <HI>Persian,</HI> and <HI>Onesilas</HI> the <HI>Cyprian,</HI> who
encourag'd the Revolt of that Island, were
kill'd. By Sea the <HI>Ionians</HI> had some Advan∣tage;
but the <HI>Cyprians</HI> were so intirely routed
by Land, that they were forc'd again to sub∣mit
to the <HI>Persian</HI> Yoke in a Year after they
had thrown it off. The <HI>Ionians</HI> upon the ill
Success of this Battel made to their Ships,
leaving the <HI>Persians</HI> in a Condition to act offen∣sively:
So that they easily reduc'd <HI>Caria,</HI> and
most of the Towns upon the <HI>Hellespont</HI> and
<HI>Propontis,</HI> with <HI>Clazomenae</HI> in <HI>Ionia,</HI> and <HI>Cumae</HI>
in <HI>Aeolia.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Aristagoras</HI> fled to
<HI>Thrace,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristago∣ras <HI>kill'd.</HI></NOTE> and being oppos'd by the Inhabitants,
was cut off with all his Forces.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="217"/>
<HI>Histiaeus</HI> finding things grown to a head,
thought it time to stir: And tho' <HI>Darius</HI> su∣spected
him, he still carry'd it fair with him,
and trusted him with a Commission to go and
pacific the Troubles in <HI>Ionia.</HI> But when he
came to <HI>Sardis, Artaphernes</HI> could not forbear
taxing him as the Incendiary, telling him plain∣ly,
<HI>That the Shoe, which</HI> Aristagoras <HI>had put on,
was of his making.</HI> So that finding himself
detected, he knew not where to fix, but kept in
continual Motion from one Place to another,
in hopes to pick up Strength enough to carry
on his Designs by open Force. But he who
had acted on both Sides, was not easily trusted
by either; neither would his old Friends the
<HI>Milesians</HI> admit him into their City, tho' they
had at this time need enough of his Assistance.
For the War being pretty well over in other
Parts, was carry'd on with the greater Vigour
in <HI>Ionia;</HI> and the chief of the <HI>Persian</HI> Forces
were employ'd against <HI>Miletus.</HI> The <HI>Mile∣sians</HI>
had no Land Army to oppose 'em: But
by the Assistance of their Neighbours, parti∣cularly
the <HI>Chians, Lesbians,</HI> and <HI>Samians,</HI> they
furnish'd out a Fleet of between three and four
hundred Sail. The <HI>Persian</HI> Navy consisted
chi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fly of <HI>Phaenicians, Cyprians, Aegyptians</HI> and
<HI>Cilicians;</HI> and tho' they had the Superiority by
almost double the Number of Vessels, they
thought it more adviseable to treat with the se∣veral
Tyrants, whom <HI>Aristagoras</HI> had depos'd,
to draw off their Citizens, than to hazard an
Engagement. While they were managing this
Affair, the <HI>Samians</HI> concluded it would be to
no purpose to incur the Anger of the <HI>Persian,</HI>
who if he were defeated now, could soon send
<PB N="187" REF="218"/>
a Fleet five times as big; and therefore were
the first, who went off. The Confederacy be∣ing
once broke, the <HI>Lesbians</HI> with a great part
of the <HI>Ionians</HI> follow'd: So that the <HI>Chians</HI> a∣lone
flood to it, and were worsted. The <HI>Persians</HI>
having carry'd their Point at Sea, left the
<HI>Milesians</HI> nothing but their Walls to
trust to; and it was not long before the City was close∣ly
block'd up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miletus <HI>taken.</HI></NOTE> taken, and plunder'd, part of
the Citizens being slain, and the rest carry'd
Prisoners with their Wives and Children to
<HI>Susa.</HI> The Fate of this City did in a manner
put an end to the War. But <HI>Histiaeus,</HI> who only
waited to form his measures according to the
Event of this Siege, by the help of some <HI>Les∣bians</HI>
easily subdu'd <HI>Chios,</HI> which was just be∣fore
drain'd and weaken'd: And having pick'd
up more scatter'd Remains of the <HI>Ionians</HI> and
<HI>Aeolians,</HI> pass'd from thence into <HI>Mysia</HI> upon
some greater Expedition. But falling in with
<HI>Harpagus,</HI> who lay there with a considerable
Body of <HI>Persians,</HI> lost most of his Men, was
himself taken Prisoner, and carry'd to <HI>Arta∣phernes,</HI>
who immediately nail'd him to a Cross,
and sent his Head to <HI>Darius;</HI> who was so far
from being pleas'd with the Present, that he
gave it honourable Interment, and lamented
him, as one who had deserv'd well of him, and
his Country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ioni∣an</HI> Rebel∣lion sup∣press'd.</NOTE> Thus the <HI>Ionian</HI> Rebellion, which

<PB N="188" REF="219"/>
the Yoke, first under the <HI>Lydians,</HI> and twice
under the <HI>Persians.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Darius,</HI> whilst he was settling the Tri∣bute,
and securing his Conquests, cast his
thoughts upon <HI>Europe,</HI> and made several At∣tempts
on that Side with various Success: So
that the End of this War was in effect but the
Beginning of that long Train of Evils, which
he brought upon himself, and his Successors.
Two Years after the taking of <HI>Miletus,</HI> he
withdrew the Commissions of his late Captains,
and sent in their room <HI>Mardonius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mardoni∣us.</NOTE> who had mar∣ry'd
his Daughter, with a good sufficient Fleet
and Army. He went first into <HI>Ionia;</HI> where
to keep the Inhabitants firm to the <HI>Persian</HI> In∣terest,
he dissolv'd all the Tyrannies, and restor'd
the <HI>Democracy.</HI> His next Expedition was
with his Fleet against <HI>Thasos,</HI> a rich Island o∣ver
against <HI>Thrace,</HI> the Land Forces being em∣ploy'd
at the same time in reducing the other
Parts of <HI>Macedon,</HI> which had not yet declar'd
for his Master. Having been thus far successful,
he coasted along by Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> where
he met with such a violent Storm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His fruit∣less Expe∣dition.</NOTE> that he lost
three h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndred of his Vessels, and in 'em above
twenty thousand Men. It happen'd just after
that the Foot being quarter'd in <HI>Macedon,</HI> the
<HI>Brygi,</HI> a People of <HI>Thrace,</HI> sell upon 'em by
Night, kill'd many, and wounded <HI>Mardonius.</HI>
And tho' he soon rally'd, and subdu'd 'em, he
durst not pursue his Conquests, but return'd
home with his shatter'd Fleet, and the Remains
of his Army.</P>
<P>These Successes did so little answer the Loss
of so many Ships and Men, that they serv'd
<PB N="189" REF="220"/>
rather to incense, than satisfie <HI>Darius,</HI> and
made him resolve to send Force enough the
next Year to do the Business effectually. He
began now to declare himself obstinately bent
upon the Conquest of <HI>Greece;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The more immediate Grounds of the</HI> Persian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> to which Reso∣lution
many Circumstances concurr'd. Ever
since the burning of <HI>Sardis</HI> he had vow'd Re∣venge
upon the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and order'd one every
time he sate down to Table, to cry out, <HI>Sir, Re∣member
the</HI> Athenians. He could much easier
have pardon'd the <HI>Ionians,</HI> tho' they were the
principal Aggressors, as not thinking they would
have dar'd to attempt any thing against him,
but at the Instigation of those, whose Igno∣rance,
or Contempt of his Power might encou∣rage
'em to provoke him. As for the Islanders,
they had furnish'd out a great Number of
Ships against him: And the Pretence of
ma∣king it a national Quarrel, was, that they had
all in general given his Rebels free Harbour.
To add to which, <HI>Hippias</HI> was always at hand
to aggravate these Matters, that being the on∣ly
means left him to recover his Tyranny. Not
but the Business was likely enough to have
proceeded without him. For the Noise the
principal States of <HI>Greece</HI> began now to make in
the World, could not but alarm the <HI>Persian</HI>
Greatness: And <HI>Darius</HI> in the beginning of his
Reign seem'd resolv'd to crush 'em, by send∣ing
several as Spies under the Conduct of <HI>De∣mocedes,</HI>
to take an exact Survey of the Coun∣try.</P>
<P>In order therefore to this intended Invasion,
he first try'd how the several Cities stood af∣fected,
sending to 'em all to demand Earth and
Water; but at the same time gave Orders to
<PB N="190" REF="221"/>
the Cities upon the Sea-coasts to build long
Ships, and flat-bottom'd Boats, for the Tran∣sportation
of Horse. The <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> and
<HI>Athenians,</HI> threw the Messengers into deep Pits,
telling 'em, <HI>There was Earth and Water to car∣ry
to their Master.</HI> He who advis'd this, was
said to be <HI>Miltiades;</HI> who besides his being an
<HI>Athenian,</HI> had a personal Pique against the
<HI>Persians,</HI> for forcing him from his Government
of the <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> when they had invaded the
<HI>Thracian</HI> Territories. The <HI>aeginetans</HI> with
some other Islands comply'd; and were there∣upon
accus'd by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> as having be∣tray'd
the Liberty of their Country, only for
an Opportunity of fighting them to Advan∣tage.
The Matter was heard, and resented at
<HI>Sparta;</HI> and <HI>Cleomenes</HI> went immediately to
<HI>Aegina</HI> to punish the Heads of the Revolt:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some Com∣motions at</HI> Sparta.</NOTE>
But he had at that time a Difference with his
Collegue <HI>Demaratus,</HI> who under-hand defeated
his Designs. <HI>Cleomenes</HI> to be reveng'd of him, at
his Return us'd his utmost Efforts to get him
depos'd; and the Pretence was his being ille∣gitimate.
It seems <HI>Ariston,</HI> the Father of <HI>Demaratus,</HI>
having no Children by two Wives,
took a third, who was already marry'd to one
of his Friends, which was allowable according
to <HI>Lycurgus's</HI> Laws: And having this Son by
her in seven Months after Marriage, he swore
it was none of his. But for fear the Line of
<HI>procles</HI> should fail, the State took no notice of
it, and he own'd the Child, leaving him Suc∣cessor
to his Crown and Virtues, he being no∣ted
as the first <HI>Spartan</HI> King, who conquer'd
in the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games. But upon this Con∣test
between the two Kings, the old Business
<PB N="191" REF="222"/>
of Bastardy was trump'd up, and the Oracle
was to decide it. The <HI>Pythia</HI> being corrupted
by <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> gave it against <HI>Demaratus:</HI> So
that this, and his former Retreat out of <HI>Attica,</HI>
which was the Grounds of the Quarrel, being
objected against him, he was dethron'd, and
succeeded by his Kinsman <HI>Leutychides. Demaratus,</HI>
tho' he express'd a Love for his Country,
went over to the <HI>Persian;</HI> by whom he was
easily receiv'd at this Juncture, and entertain'd
with all the Honour due to his Character. As
for <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;oon after detected; and
being struck with Remorse for the Injustice he
had done his Collegue, in a fit of a Phrenzy
rip'd up his own Belly. Nor did it fare much
better with <HI>Leutychides,</HI> who afterwards prov'd
a Traitor to his Country, and being convicted
of Bribery, dy'd in Exile.</P>
<P>But he with <HI>Cleomenes</HI> had first taken ten of
the principal Men of <HI>Aegina,</HI> and left 'em as
Hostages at <HI>Athens.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The War with Aegi∣na.</HI></NOTE> Which the <HI>Aeginetans</HI>
having often complain'd of, and receiv'd no Redress,
intercepted a Ship going to <HI>Delos,</HI> (ac∣cording
to a yearly Custom observ'd ever since
<HI>Theseus's</HI> time) and in it the principal Men of
<HI>Athens,</HI> whom, by way of Reprisal, they made
Prisoners. Which so incens'd the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
that they mann'd out seventy Gallies, and a∣greed
at the same time to have the City of
<HI>Aegina</HI> betray'd to 'em: But the Fleet coming
up too late to second the Attempt by Land,
that Design miscarry'd. However the Flects
engag'd, and the <HI>Aeginetans</HI> were worsted: But
being reinforc'd, they ventur'd another Battel,
and got the better. This War seems to have
been of a longer Continuance, tho' we have very
<PB N="192" REF="223"/>
little Light into the Particulars: But we may
observe in general, that these civil Discords,
which seem'd to favour the Designs of the
common Enemy, did in a great measure procure
the Safety of <HI>Greece,</HI> by putting the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
upon the Study of Sea-Affairs, and by
that means preparing them for the <HI>Persian.</HI> So
that they easily wrested the Sovereignty of the
Seas from the Islanders, and particularly the
<HI>Aeginetans,</HI> who had held it twenty Years;
and that at a time when the Eyes and Hopes
of all <HI>Greece</HI> were upon them, and when they
could have done very little without it.</P>
<P>IV. Whilst the <HI>Athenians</HI> were engag'd in
this War, <HI>Darius</HI> prosecuted his Designs upon
<HI>Greece:</HI> And having levy'd an Army of an
hundred thousand Foot according to the low∣est
Computation, (for <HI>Justin</HI> reckons six times
as many) and ten thousand Horse, gave the
chief Command to <HI>Datis</HI> a <HI>Mede,</HI> in the room
of <HI>Mardonius,</HI> under whom the Fleet had mis∣carry'd,
appointing <HI>Artaphernes</HI> his Brother's
Son, and <HI>Hippias</HI> as his Assistants, and giving
them an express Command to bring the <HI>Athenians</HI>
and <HI>Eretrians</HI> Prisoners to him, and to
lay waste their Country. Accordingly they
embark'd in six hundred Gallies, besides Tran∣sports
for the Horse: And directly crossing the
<HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, possess'd themselves of <HI>Samos,
Naxos, Delos,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Cyclades</HI> to
secure their Passage. From thence they <HI>sail'd</HI>
to <HI>Euboea;</HI> where the <HI>Eretrians,</HI> tho' the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
had lent 'em four thousand Men, thought
it more adviseable to send 'em home, and keep
within their Walls, than to offer Battel to such
<PB REF="224"/>
<FIGURE>

<PB N="193" REF="225"/>
unequal Numbers.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eretri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣taken.</HI></NOTE> For six Days the <HI>Persians</HI>
attempted to storm the City, and were repulsed
with Loss; but on the seventh it being betray'd
into their Hands, they enter'd, plunder'd and
burnt it. From thence <HI>Hippias</HI> conducted them
into <HI>Attica;</HI> and they encamp'd in the Plains of
<HI>Marathon</HI> ten Miles distant from <HI>Athens.</HI> The
<HI>Athenians</HI> having notice of their March, and be∣ing
sensible of the Disproportion, dispatch'd Mes∣sengers
to <HI>Sparta</HI> for their speedy Assistance;
and in the mean time chose tell of their Citizens
to command their Forces. The <HI>Lacaedemonians</HI>
seem'd very willing to assist, 'em; but being to
be detain'd four Days upon a religious Ac∣count,
it was debated among the <HI>Athenians,
Whether they should wait for a Summons from
the Enemy, as the</HI> Eretrians <HI>did, within their
Walls, or go out to meet 'em. Miltiades</HI> earnest∣ly
press'd the latter, and with much Difficulty
prevail'd. Accordingly they took the Field
with only nine thousand of their own Men,
and one thousand <HI>Plataeans.</HI> Each Captain as∣signd
his Day of Command to <HI>Miltiades,</HI> who
had by this means the whole Management of
the Battel.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battel of</HI> Mara∣thon.</NOTE> He chose to put the Issue of it up∣on
his own Day; and having dispos'd the Ar∣my
into two Wings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> and a main Body, led 'em
on with such Fury and Precipitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3514.</NOTE> that the
<HI>Persians</HI> thought they were rather to be laugh'd
at as Madmen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 72. 3</NOTE> than dreaded as Enemies. But
being ingaged, and considering their <HI>All</HI> was at
Stake, that therefore they must either die, or
conquer, Despair added to their natural Cou∣rage,
and they held the Victory long in Sus∣pence.
And tho' the main Bettel was forc'd
to give way to the <HI>Persian</HI> Numbers, both the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Wings prevail'd, which gave 'em an
<PB N="194" REF="226"/>
Opportunity of relieving the rest. Which they
did so effectually, that tho' there was ten to
one against 'em, they soon disorder'd and routed
the Enemy, and gain'd a Victory, which had
more of Truth in it, than Probability. for
they pursu'd 'em to their very Ships, several
of which they took: And as an Instance of the
Obstinacy, with which the <HI>Grecians</HI> fought,
<HI>Cynagirus</HI> held a Gally full of <HI>Persians</HI> with his
Right Hand, to keep it from putting off from
Shore; which was no sooner lopp'd off, but he
seiz'd it with his left, and losing that too, he
fix'd his Teeth in it, and expir'd. As to the
Number of the Slain, <HI>Herodotus</HI> reckons six
thousand four hundred <HI>Persians,</HI> and but one
hundred ninety two of the <HI>Grecians;</HI> among
whom were few Officers of Note, but <HI>Calli∣machus,</HI>
who commanded the Right Wing.
<HI>Hippias</HI> is thought to have fell in this Battel;
tho' <HI>Suidas</HI> says he escap'd, and dy'd misera∣bly
in <HI>Lemnos.</HI></P>
<P>The Persians immediately retir'ed into <HI>Asia,</HI>
having nothing to cover their Disgrace but
their Prisoners, whom they took in <HI>Eretria.</HI>
These were presented to <HI>Darius</HI> at <HI>Susa,</HI> and
settled near the <HI>Tigris</HI> upon much better Terms
than they could expect: So that they, and their
Posterity flourish'd in a Body for several Ages,
and retain'd their Language. Two thousand of
the <HI>Spartans,</HI> (whose Laws would not permit
'em to stir 'till the full of the Moon) came at
last into the Field: But the Action being over,
they serv'd only to testifie, and extol the Bra∣very
of their Countrymen. Among whom
<HI>Themistocles,</HI> tho' very young, did enough to
signalize himself, and gave an early Promise of
what might one Day be expected from him.
<PB N="195" REF="227"/>
But the chief Honour of the Day was justly
aserib'd to the Valour and Conduct of <HI>Mlilti∣ades;</HI>
whole Reward, when he return'd to <HI>A∣thens,</HI>
was only to have the Battel of <HI>Marathon</HI>
painted the publick Buildings, with himself
at the Head of the ten Captains, giving his
Directions.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the general Consternation
occasion'd by this War, Philosophy receiv'd
daily Improvement from the Successors of
<HI>Thales</HI> and <HI>Pythagoras.</HI> And Poetry had still
her Votaries:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theognis. Phocylides.</NOTE> Among whom were <HI>Theognis,</HI>
and <HI>Phocylides;</HI> whose Writings were chiefly
Precepts and Sentences of Morality, which the
latter of them is said to have stole; from the
Writings of the <HI>Sibyls.</HI> About the same Period
dy'd <HI>Anacreon</HI> of <HI>Teos</HI> in <HI>Ionia;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anacreon.</NOTE> a Man of Ease
and Pleasure, dividing all his Hours betwixt
Wine, Love and Poetry. He was so profess'd
an Enemy to the common Business, and Cares
of Life, that when <HI>Polycrates</HI> of <HI>Samos,</HI> with
whom he was highly in favour, had made him
a Present of five Talents, he could not sleep in
two Nights after: Upon which he carry'd back
the Treasure, and told his Patron, <HI>That how∣ever
considerable the Sum might be, it was not an
equal Price for the Trouble of keeping it.</HI> He
writ with the same unconcern'd Freedom and
Gaiety, that he liv'd; so that the best Image of
his Manners is to be drawn from his Poems;
where we meet with all the flowing Eas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess,
and Simplicity both of Thought and Expression,

<P>I. WHilst <HI>Miltiades</HI> was in full Credit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miltiades <HI>sent to cha∣stise the Islands.</HI></NOTE>
and Esteem for his late Victory, the
State decreed him seventy Gallies well mann'd
to chastise the Islands, which had sided with
the <HI>Persian.</HI> Several of 'em submitted; others
he reduc'd with Ease; but coming to <HI>Paros</HI> to
demand an hundred Talents, the Inhabitants
chose rather to prepare for a vigorous Defence,
than to hearken to any such Proposals: Where∣upon
he landed his Men, harass'd the Country,
and block'd up the City. But when the Siege
was well advanc'd, it happen'd, as <HI>Nepos</HI> tells
the Story, that a Grove upon the Continent
by some Accident took fire; which being seen
from the Island in the Night, and both Sides
taking it for a Signal, that the <HI>Persian</HI> Fleet was
coming to the Relief of the <HI>Parians, Miltiades</HI>
set fire to his Works, and return'd home. This
was interpreted by his Enemies, particularly
<HI>Xanthippus</HI> the Father of <HI>Pericles,</HI> as a valunta∣ry
<PB N="197" REF="229"/>
Miscarriage; and he was accus'd of being
in League with the <HI>Persian.</HI> He was not in a
Condition to answer this Charge, being con∣fin'd
to his Bed by a Fall he receiv'd at <HI>Paros,</HI>
which <HI>Herodotus</HI> makes the Cause of his Re∣treat.
But his Friends, who appear'd for him,
urg'd his many Services to the State, and bid
'em particularly <HI>Remember Marathon;</HI> yet
could they prevail no further, than to get the
Sentence of Death chang'd into a Fine of fifty
Talents, (which was the Charge the State had
been at in fitting out of the Gallies) and Impri∣sonment,
'till it were paid. But whatever Pre∣tence
the <HI>Athenians</HI> made use of in his Condem∣nation,
'tis certain their Fear sway'd more with
them, than his Guilt. They thought him too
well practis'd in Government, to lead a private
Life, especially after his Merit had gain'd him
such a Power and Interest, as might be improv'd
into the Destruction of that Liberty, he pre∣tended
to support.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Cha∣racter,</HI></NOTE> But this was not easily to
be presum'd of one, who had always carry'd
himself with Humility, Justice, and Modera∣tion:
Nor could any thing less than an actual
Attempt upon their Liberty, justifie the Perse∣cution
of a Man, to whom they ow'd their
Lives and Fortunes, and in a great Measure all
their future Glory. For he first encourag'd
'em to look the <HI>Persian</HI> in the Face; and con∣vinc'd
them by his Example, that Numbers
are not proof against Courage and Discipline.
He lay some time under this Sentence, 'till the
Bruise of his Thigh growing worse, turn'd to
a Gangrene,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and Death.</HI></NOTE> and kill'd him. After which the
<HI>Athenians</HI> carry'd their Resentment so far, that
they would not suffer him to be bury'd, 'till
<PB N="198" REF="230"/>
his Son <HI>Cimon</HI> took the Debt upon himself.
Thus sell <HI>Miltiades</HI> a Sacrifice to the groundless
Jealousie of the People; a notorious Instance
of the Capriciousness of Fortune, and his Coun∣try's
Ingratitude.</P>
<P>The Success at <HI>Marathon</HI> gave some Years
Respite to <HI>Greece;</HI> but so animated <HI>Darius</HI> to
redeem his Honour by a second Attempt, that
he order'd new Levies to be made, and spent
three Years in his Preparations. After which
<HI>Aegypt</HI> happening to Revolt, and there being
the next Year a Contest among his Sons at home
about the nominating his Successor, his Thoughts
were diverted from proceeding against <HI>Greece</HI>
with that Vigour he intended.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of</HI> Darius.</NOTE> When at last
he came to a Resolution, and was provided for
both Expeditions against <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> he

his Son <HI>Xerxes.</HI></P>
<P>II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> <HI>Mardonius</HI> upon his first Accession to
the Throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3519.</NOTE> press'd him earnestly to the <HI>Euro∣pean</HI>
War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 73. 4▪</NOTE> backing his Arguments with the cer∣tainty
of Success. However this might fix his
Ambition, he thought it of more immediate
Consequence to reduce <HI>Aegypt;</HI> which with
the Forces his Father left him, he easily com∣pass'd:
And having committed it to the Go∣vernment
of his Brother <HI>Achaemenes,</HI> turn'd his
Thoughts upon <HI>Greece.</HI> In a Council held for
the Management of this War, he open'd his
Intentions with a Speech full of Arrogance and
Contempt, But his Uncle <HI>Artabanus</HI> presu∣ming
upon his Age and Experience, was so far
from soothing his Vanity, that he us'd his ut∣most
Endeavours to dissuade him from so ha∣zardous
<PB N="199" REF="231"/>
an Enterprise. From general Reflecti∣ons
on the Instability of Fortune, and the Un∣certainty
of all human Events, he descended
the Particulars of his Father's Reign, alledging
that <HI>To whatever Cause his ill Success in</HI> Scy∣thia
<HI>might be imputed; yet the Business of</HI> Mara∣thon
<HI>had given them too fresh, and fatal an In∣stance
of the</HI> Grecian <HI>Bravery, to look upon them
as a despicable People: That he ought therefore
to be well advis'd in an Affair of such Moment,
that so he might at least justifie his Conduct, tho'
he could not warrant the Success. Xerxes</HI> told
him, <HI>His Advice was nothing but the Result of
Sloth and Cowardise; and that his Punishment
should be to stay at home, and not share in the
Glory of that Expedition.</HI> But upon cooler
Thoughts, he seem'd better reconcil'd to his Un∣cle's
Opinion; and his Ambition being temper'd
with more Pride than Courage, kept him wa∣vering,
'till at last being terrify'd with Dreams,
and Apparitions, or rather egg'd on by the Sons
of <HI>Hippias▪.</HI> and others, who had their several
Interests to promote by this Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he resum'd
his first Resolution.</P>
<P>Accordingly he sent to all the Sea-Coasts to
provide him Shipping;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Xerxes <HI>his Prepa∣rations.</HI></NOTE> and in the mean time
drain'd his whole Dominions, with all other
Countries, that had the least Dependence on
him, to raise an Army suitable to the Vastness
of his Design; which in four Years he at last
compleated. The Horse were commanded by
the Sons of <HI>Datis;</HI> and a select Body of ten
thousand Foot by <HI>Hydarnes.</HI> This was call'd
the <HI>Immortal Regiment,</HI> because it was kept con∣stantly
supply'd out of the rest. But the gross
of the Army was committed to <HI>Mardonius,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="232"/>
who having the Princes of the Blood join'd
with him as Assistants,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His March.</HI></NOTE> commanded in chief.
The first general Rendezvous of the Land-forces
was at <HI>Critalae;</HI> from whence passing the
River <HI>Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> they march'd to <HI>Celaenae</HI> à City of
<HI>Phrygia,</HI> and winter'd at <HI>Sardis. Xerxes</HI> during
his Stay here sent into <HI>Greece,</HI> to demand <HI>Earth</HI>
and <HI>Water;</HI> and the Fleet being come up to the
<HI>Chersonesus,</HI> he order'd a Passage of a Mile
and an half long to be cut for it behind Mount
<HI>Athos,</HI> to avoid the Danger of Shipwrack, which
<HI>Mardonius</HI> before had suffer'd by sailing about.
In the beginning of the Spring he quitted <HI>Sar∣dis;</HI>
and from an Eminence rais'd for that pur∣pose
in the Plains of <HI>Abydus,</HI> took a View of his
whole Force by Sea and Land: Where he could
not forbear testifying his Pride and Joy to see
himself Lord of so many united Nations; but
soon after fell into the other Extremes of Passion,
and could not without Tears reflect, <HI>That
not one of so many Thousands would be alive an
hundred Years after.</HI> This engag'd him in a
melancholy Discourse with <HI>Artabanus</HI> about the
Shortness and Miseries of Life; who from thence
took Occasion to insinuate his Doubts, as he
did before, about the Success of this Enter∣prise▪
He urg'd the many Inconveniences he
had to suffer, if not from the Enemy, at least
from the Elements themselves; that his having
no Port there sufficient to shelter such a Fleet
upon any Accident, might prove very destru∣ctive
to his Shipping; and that Plague, Fa∣mine,
and Confusion were the necessary Atten∣dants
of such ungovernable Multitudes by Land.
<HI>Xerxes</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him in Answer, <HI>That great Actions
were necessarily attended with some proportionable
<PB N="201" REF="233"/>
Danger; and that it was impossible to provide for
Accidents.</HI> So that whatever Opinion he had
of his Uncle's Wisdom in other Matters, he
thought it too deliberate for the Camp, and
sent him back as his Vice-Roy to <HI>Susa.</HI></P>
<P>In order to his Passage into <HI>Europe,</HI> he had
laid a Bridge cross the <HI>Helespont,</HI> where it was
near a Mile over; which being broke down by
tempestuous Weather, he cut off the Heads of
the Workmen, order'd the Sea it self to be
whipp'd, as tho' it had rebell'd against its So∣vereign,
and cast a pair of Fetters into it, in
token of its future Subjection.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His passage into</HI> Eu∣rope.</NOTE> After which
he made two Bridges of Gallies ty'd together,
and so well anchor'd, that they resisted the
Winds; by which means the whole Army
pass'd over in seven Days and Nights. This
seems to have been the first Instance of that
which afterwards became the common Method
of <HI>Caesar</HI> and others, to transport their Armies.
<HI>Xerxes</HI> being got into <HI>Europe,</HI> order'd the Fleet
to sail on Westward, and march'd himself with
the Land Forces through the <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> ga∣thering
still more as he went; and encamp'd in
a vast Plain near <HI>Doriscus,</HI> and well water'd
with the Rive <HI>Hebrus,</HI> where he muster'd, and
number'd the whole Army. But as Historians
differ in nothing more than the Accounts of
Armies, so here we may with more Ease col∣lect
from several Circumstances of their Pre∣parations,
and March, that they were the great∣est
Army that ever appear'd in the Field, than
assign any just Number.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Ac∣count of his Forces.</HI></NOTE> According to the
most modest Computation, they amounted to
at least seven hundred thousand Men. <HI>Hero∣dotus</HI>
reckons up seventeen hundred thousand
<PB N="202" REF="234"/>
Foot, and eighty thousand Horse; and makes
an Accession of about three hundred thousand
in their March. To these he adds above five
hundred thousand belonging to the Fleet, which
consisted of somewhat above twelve hundred
long Gallies, besides three thousand Transports,
and Ships of Burden. So that the whole of
the <HI>Asian</HI> and <HI>European</HI> Forces by Sea and
Land, he reckons at above two Millions and a
half; and allows at least an equal Number of
Women, Eunuchs, Slaves and other Atten∣dants.
This will easily account for <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
and <HI>Isocrates,</HI> when they say five Millions fol∣low'd
<HI>Xerxes</HI> into <HI>Greece;</HI> and thus it might be
affirm'd without an <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> that they drank
up several little Rivers in their March.</P>
<P>III. <HI>Greece</HI> in the mean while was suffici∣ently
alarm'd at these Approaches,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Gre∣cian <HI>Prepa∣rations.</HI></NOTE> but not so
as to abandon all hopes of diverting the Storm.
<HI>Demaratus</HI> the late <HI>Spartan</HI> King, who seems
to have acted on both Sides, had from time to
time given his Countrymen notice of <HI>Xerxes</HI>'s
Designs and Motions: And upon his Passage <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to
<HI>Europe,</HI> they summon'd a general Council in
the <HI>Isthmus;</HI> where they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esalv'd to
wave all private Quarrels, and join in the De∣fence
of their common Liberty, at the same
time publishing their Intentions, of putting to
Death every tenth Man of those, who went o∣ver
to the Enemy. But this did not hinder
the greatest part of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> and <HI>Thessaly,</HI> with
other petty States, which lay most expos'd, from
declaring for the <HI>Persian;</HI> especially after the
ten thousand Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who were sent into <HI>Thessaly</HI>
under the Conduct of <HI>Euaenetus</HI> the <HI>Spartan,</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="235"/>
and <HI>Themistocles</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> were return'd,
as not thinking themselves able to protect them.
The <HI>Argives</HI> also being sent to in this Extre∣mity,
evaded their Assistance, by insisting on
Terms, which could not be accepted: So that
partly out of Fear, and partly out of their in∣veterate
Hatred to the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> they
held secret Intelligence with the Enemy. Thus
the Burden of the War lay chiefly upon the <HI>A∣thenians,</HI>
and <HI>Lacedaemonians;</HI> who, when they
found the <HI>Persian</HI> advanc'd through <HI>Thrace</HI> and
<HI>Macedon,</HI> resolv'd in another Council to op∣pose
his Progress; and accordingly dispatch'd
six thousand Men under the Command of <HI>Leo∣nidas</HI>
the famous <HI>Spartan</HI> King, to possess the
Streights of <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> a narrow Pass between
the Mountains, which divided <HI>Thessaly</HI> from
the rest of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>As to Sea Affairs, there was the same Dis∣proportion
as by Land: Whereupon they had
Recourse to the Islanders, most of which were
their Allies, and Colonies. <HI>Sicily</HI> was at that
time able to furnish out as many Ships as all
<HI>Greece:</HI> But her Tyrant <HI>Gelon</HI> insisted upon
being declar'd Commander in chief. As for
<HI>Crete,</HI> she had her Oracles first to consult: And
the <HI>Corcyraeans,</HI> tho' they express'd a Sense of
their common Danger, and hover'd about with
sixty Sail, it was only with a Design to fall in
with the Conqueror. So that the chief De∣pendance
at Sea was upon <HI>Athens;,</HI> whose late
War with <HI>Aegina</HI> had put those two States in
a Condition of de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending the rest. This Ge∣nius
for Sea Affairs was very opportunely im∣prov'd
by <HI>Themistocles,</HI> who from a mean Ex∣traction
became so active and aspiring, as to
<PB N="204" REF="236"/>
complain at his first Appearance in the World,
<HI>That the Trophies of</HI> Miltiades <HI>would not let him
sleep.</HI> He had Boldness enough to propose, and
Courage enough to execute any thing, that
might tend to his own, and his Country's Ho∣nour.
For an Instance of which, he got the
Mony, which was rais'd from the Mines, and
ought to have been divided among the People,
to be employ'd in Shipping: And so, by the
<HI>Wooden Walls,</HI> which the Oracle advis'd the <HI>A∣thenians</HI>
to trust to, he would have nothing un∣derstood,
but their Ships. By these means,
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Fleet was encreas'd to near two
hundred Sail; and putting to Sea with the rest
of the Confederates, making in all two hundred
and eighty, stood over-against <HI>Artemisium</HI> to∣wards
the North part of <HI>Euboea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> in the mean while drew down his nu∣merous
Forces towards the Streights of <HI>Ther∣mopylae,</HI>
but rather for Terror, and Ostentation,
than with thoughts of fighting. For finding
<HI>Leonidas</HI> ready to receive him, and his Men
unusually gay, arid unconcern'd, he sent to let
them know, that <HI>If they would lay down their
Arms, he would receive them as Friends, and
Confederates, and bestow upon them much richer,
and larger Countries, than what they now pos∣sess'd.</HI>
They rejected his Offers with a be∣coming
Scorn, telling him, <HI>They should have
Occasion for their Arms, whether as his Friends,
or Enemies; that they desir'd no Country, but
what they won by their Virtue and Valour, and
could maintain by the same Methods they got it.</HI>
Upon this the <HI>Persian</HI> address'd himself to <HI>De∣maratus,</HI>
asking him with an Air of Pity, and
Contempt. <HI>What it was his Countrymen pre∣pos'd?
<PB N="205" REF="237"/>
Or, whether they could run faster than
his Horses?</HI> He told him, <HI>He would find them
resolv'd to fight it out to the last; and that not
a Man of them would survive his Country's Li∣berty.</HI>
Agreeable to this was the Answer of
<HI>Dieneces a Spartan;</HI> who being told, <HI>That the</HI>
Persian <HI>Darts would darken the very Sun: So
much the better,</HI> says he, <HI>for then we shall fight
in the Shade.</HI> From all which one might con∣clude,
that Virtue was then going to give
Laws to Effeminacy, Reason to Instinct, and
the Soul to the Body.</P>
<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> at last advanc▪'d with a Body of
<HI>Medes,</HI> ordering those, who had lost any of their
Relations at the Battel of <HI>Marathon,</HI> to beat the
Enemy from this Post, and revenge their dead
Friends.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Action at</HI> Ther∣mopylae.</NOTE> Accordingly they began the Onset,
but were repuls'd with great Loss. Then
mighty Numbers of raw undisciplin'd Fellows
march<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d against them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> of whom a prodigious
Slaughter was made:<NOTE PLACE="marg">3524.</NOTE> Nor did the <HI>Immortal
Regiment,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 75. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> which was sent to relieve them, come
off at a cheaper rate. The next day <HI>Xerxes</HI>
made a Detachment of the choicest of his
Troops, with a Promise of large Rewards, if
they would break in upon them, and force the
Pass. Upon which they made a violent Charge,
but with no better Success than before: For
the <HI>Grecians</HI> collected into a close Body stood
the Shock, and fill'd the way with <HI>Persian</HI> Car∣casses:
So that being driven one upon another,
the Confusion, and consequently the Slaughter
was the greater. Thus did they keep their
Ground for two Days; on the first of which,
<HI>Xerxes</HI> was observ'd to leap three times from
his Throne, whereon he was plac'd to see the
<PB N="206" REF="238"/>
Battel: And being the next Day under the
same Consternation, it happen'd that <HI>Ephialtes</HI>
a <HI>Trachinian,</HI> deserted from the <HI>Grecians,</HI> to
shew him a secret way over a Ledge of Moun∣tains,
by which he might fall upon their Rear,
<HI>Leonidas</HI> being inform'd that twenty thousand
of the Enemy had logd'd themselves on the Top
of the Hills, advis'd his Companions to <HI>retire,
and reserve themselves for better Times, and the
future Safety of</HI> Greece; <HI>that for his own part,
he ow'd more to his Country, than to himself,
and that it was his Business to fall in the present
Defence of it.</HI> Thus having dismiss'd all but
three hundred <HI>Spartans</HI> with some <HI>Thespians,</HI>
and <HI>Thebans,</HI> in all not a thousand Men, <HI>Come,
Fellow-Soldiers,</HI> says he to them, <HI>Let us Dine
chearfully, as if we were to Sup together in the
other World.</HI> And indeed they could propose no∣thing
more than to fulfil the Oracle, which had
declar'd the City, or King of <HI>Sparta</HI> must fall;
at the same time to let the <HI>Persian</HI> see, what
Value they set upon their Liberty, and, as it
were, to revenge their own Deaths, before
they fell. Being thus animated, they study'd
only haw to sell their Lives as dear as they
could; and thinking Death to be no where
more honourably met with, than in the Ene∣mies
Camp, they took the Advantage of the
Night, and made directly to the Royal Pavi∣lion,
where endeavouring to surprise the King,
they broke through the whole Camp, and kill'd,
or overthrew whatever oppos'd them. The
darkness of the Night added very much to the
Confusion of the Enemy, insomuch that they
fell one upon another without Distinction of
Friend, or Foe, and rather assisted the <HI>Grecians,</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="239"/>
than defended themselves. Thus did they
carry all before them, 'till Day-light discover∣ing
the Smalness of their Numbers, they were
surrounded by the <HI>Persians,</HI> who gall'd them
both in Flank and Rear; and even then not so
much conquer'd, as tir'd with conquering, they
fell among vast Heaps of the slaughter'd Ene∣my,
leaving behind them the Example of an
Intrepidity never known before. The Body
of <HI>Leonidas</HI> was found, and nail'd to a Cross;
but his Memory was sufficiently eterniz'd by
the Poets, and Historians of those Times, who
thought this might easily pass for a Victory
on the <HI>Grecians</HI> Side, as well in respect of the
Action it self, wherein the <HI>Persians</HI> lost twenty
thousand Men, as of the Influence it after∣wards
had on the Affairs of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>Xerxes,</HI> tho' he had clear'd this Passage,
was more inclin'd to try his Fortune at Sea,
than to proceed immediately into the Coun∣try;
especially when <HI>Demaratus</HI> told him, that
<HI>Sparta</HI> alone was able to send out near eight
thousand more such Men, as those whose Va∣lour
he had so lately experienc'd. The <HI>Per∣sian</HI>
Fleet was come up to <HI>Sepias,</HI> a Promon∣tory
of <HI>Magnesia,</HI> to act in Concert with
the Land Forces; where by a Storm, which
lasted three Days, they had lost four hun∣dred
Men of War, besides Transports, and
Ships of Burden, with a proportionable Num∣ber
of Men, and Provisions. To repair which
Loss, they order'd two hundred more to take
a Compass, and surprise the <HI>Grecians</HI> lying in
the Streights of <HI>Euboea;</HI> which was the same
Stratagem the Army made use of at <HI>Thermo∣pylae,</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="240"/>
and much about the same time, but with
far different Success. For the <HI>Grecians</HI> by the
Advice of <HI>Themistocles</HI> set fail by Night; and
so by a Counter-surprise fell in with them,
took, and sunk thirty, and forc'd the rest to
Sea, where by stress of Weather they were all
sunk,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sea-fight at</HI> Artemisi∣um.</NOTE> and stranded. Enrag'd at these Disap∣pointments
they bore down the next Day with
their whole Fleet, and drawing up in the Form
of an Half-Moon, made an offer of Battel,
which the <HI>Grecians</HI> readily accepted; and by
the singular Valour of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who were
just re-inforc'd with three and fifty Sail, main∣tain'd
the Conflict with equal Loss on both
Sides, 'till Night forc'd them into Harbour.
But they were so shatter'd in the Engagement,
that they were forc'd to quit this Station in
order to refit; and especially hearing that <HI>Leo∣nidas</HI>
was cut off at <HI>Thermopylae</HI> they thought
it necessary to retire further into <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the <HI>Persians</HI> coming up with
their Fleet to <HI>Artemisium,</HI> invaded <HI>Euboea,</HI> and
the Neighbouring Coasts. <HI>Xerxes</HI> at the same
time march'd through <HI>Doris,</HI> and <HI>Phocis,</HI> ha∣rassing
the Country, and laying all waste before
him; and leaving a Detachment to rifle the
Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> at <HI>Delphi,</HI> he incamp'd with
the rest in <HI>Boeotia.</HI> When the <HI>Athenians</HI> found
him advancing towards <HI>Attica,</HI> they would
have engag'd their Confederates to make head
against him: But they declin'd it, as giving all
for lost without the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> and placing their
only Confidence in the Defence of <HI>Peloponne∣sus.</HI>
The <HI>Athenians</HI> thus abandon'd, put on
board their Wives, and Children, with their most
valuable Goods, and transported them to <HI>Troe∣zene,
<PB N="209" REF="241"/>
Aegina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xerxes <HI>en∣ters</HI> Athens.</NOTE> and <HI>Salamis.</HI> After which <HI>Xer∣xes</HI>
invaded <HI>Attica</HI> with Fire and Sword, and
enter'd <HI>Athens</HI> three Months after his Passage
into <HI>Europe.</HI> Those few Inhabitants who were
left, retir'd into the Cittadel, where literally
interpreting the Oracle of the <HI>Wooden Walls,</HI>
they fortify'd it as well as they could, with
Boards, and Palisadoes; and having stood the
first Assault, were so confident of Success, that
rather than yield to any Terms, they suffer'd
themselves to be put to the Sword, the Castle
taken, and the Temple of <HI>Minerva</HI> in it to be
burnt.</P>
<P>In this Exigency a Council was summon'd,
wherein after every one had propos'd what his
Fear, and Interest suggested, it was resolv'd
to defend the <HI>Isthmus</HI> by Sea and Land. The
Design of which was chiefly to secure <HI>Laconia,</HI>
and therefore easily assented to by <HI>Eurybiades</HI>
the <HI>Spartan,</HI> who notwithstanding the signal
Services of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> was appointed Ad∣miral
of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Navy. For as <HI>Athens</HI> was
forc'd to yield to <HI>Sparta</HI> upon other Accounts,
so neither did she think this a time to dispute
the Command at Sea. But when <HI>Themistocles</HI>
found the <HI>Grecian</HI> Fleet withdrawing from <HI>Sa∣lamis</HI>
he oppos'd it with so much Heat, that
<HI>Eurybiades</HI> made an Offer of striking him. <HI>Strike
if you will,</HI> says he, <HI>but hear what I say.</HI> He
then told 'em, <HI>Their chief Dependance must be
upon their Shipping; that they were now in Pos∣session
of the narrow Seas, which would sufficiently
perplex the Enemy; and that the improving that
Advantage, was of the last Consequence to their
Affairs.</HI> Against this it was objected, <HI>That the</HI>
Athenians <HI>were not upon an equal Foot with
<PB N="210" REF="242"/>
the</HI> Peloponnesians, <HI>whose Cities and Possessions
were yet untouch'd:</HI> But <HI>Themistocles</HI> told 'em,
<HI>They had still a City left, and that the best in all</HI>
Greece, <HI>consisting of two hundred Ships, which
would serve either to re-instate them at home, or
transport 'em to some flourishing Colony abroad,
leaving those, who abandon' d 'em first, to the
Fury of the Enemy.</HI> The fear of losing their
chief Support, brought them over to his Opi∣nion;
and the Result of all was, that they
should prepare to receive the <HI>Persian</HI> in the
<HI>Isthumus</HI> by Land, and in the Streights of <HI>Sala∣mis</HI>
by Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> in the mean while marched down to∣wards
the Sea to act in Conjunction with his
Fleet, which was come to <HI>Phal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rus</HI> the <HI>Athe∣nian</HI>
Port: And whilst he was concerting Mea∣sires
with his Officers, the <HI>Grecians</HI> Hearts a∣gain
fail'd them; and thinking it downright
Madness to throw up one Country, in hopes of
recovering another, that was intirely lost, they
weigh'd Anchor, in order to make directly to
the <HI>Isthumus. Themistocles</HI> finding no Arguments
would prevail, had recourse to Stratagem; and
dispatch'd <HI>Sicinus</HI> a <HI>Persian</HI> Captive, and there∣fore
the less suspected, to <HI>Xerxes,</HI> to tell him
from the <HI>Athenian</HI> Admiral, who secretly e∣spous'd
his Interest, <HI>That the</HI> Grecians <HI>were
preparing for Flight; and that if he set upon them
in this Confusion, before they were dispers'd, or
join'd by their Land-Army, he might at once de∣stroy
their whole Fleet.</HI> This Bait was ea∣sily
swallow'd; and two hundred Ships were
immediately sent out to block up the Streights,
and Passages, 'till the rest of the Fleet could
come up. It happen'd at this Juncture, that
<PB N="211" REF="243"/>
<HI>Aristides</HI> the Son of <HI>Lysimachus</HI> an <HI>Athenian,</HI>
with great difficulty arriv'd at <HI>Salamis</HI> from
<HI>Aegina,</HI> and gave them a full Account of the
<HI>Persians</HI> Designs, <HI>That they were at that time
actually hemming them in on all Sides, and that
there was no way left, but to fight it out.</HI> This
<HI>Aristides</HI> had beha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d very well in the Battel of
<HI>Marathon;</HI> which with the other good Quali∣ties
he was possess'd of, cast too great a Shade
upon the rising Glory of <HI>Themistocles.</HI> From
hence sprung an Emulation betwixt them,
which was daily encreas'd by the Difference
of their Tempers. For <HI>Artistides</HI> was grave,
constant, sedate, mild, open, sincere, and gene∣rous,
and was particularly distinguish'd by the
Name of <HI>Just;</HI> whereas the other was bold,
impetuous, cunning, unsettled, enterprising,
and popular. So that being naturally cut out
for transplanting his Rival, he form'd a Party,
which banish'd him by the <HI>Ostracism.</HI> And
so great was the Power of Faction, and the Fear
of Tyranny at his Condemnation, that as they
were giving in their Suffrages, an illiterate Fel∣low
comes to <HI>Aristides</HI> with his Shell, and de∣sires
him to write <HI>Aristides</HI> upon it. He ask'd
him, <HI>If</HI> Aristides <HI>had ever done him any In∣jury?
Not in the least,</HI> says he; <HI>neither do I
know the Man; but I am concerned to hear,
that he goes every where by the Name of</HI> Just.
<HI>Aristides</HI> made him no Answer, but return'd
his Shell with the Inscription of his own
Name. And at his Departure from the City,
he only pray'd, <HI>That the Time might never come,
when</HI> Athens <HI>should have Cause to remember
him.</HI> After three Years Exile he was recall'd,
for fear of his joining with the <HI>Persian</HI> upon
<PB N="212" REF="244"/>
the Invasion of <HI>Attica.</HI> But he was so far
from it, that before the Decree was pass'd for
his Return, he us'd all possible Means to en∣courage
his Countrymen in the Defence of their
Liberty; and afterwards gave an undoubted
Proof of his Zeal, by contributing towards the
Advancement of his greatest Enemy, <HI>Themisto∣cles,</HI>
at least so far as it conduc'd to the com∣mon
Security. This generous Conduct of his
gain'd too much upon <HI>Themistocles,</HI> to let any
thing of Passion, or Reserve interfere with the
Publick: So that he let him into all his De∣signs
and Projects, particularly this last of suf∣fering
himself to be surrounded. After which
they us'd their Joint-Authority with the o∣ther
Commanders to engage them to stay:
Yet did they not perfectly assent, 'till a Gally
of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> which had deserted from the <HI>Per∣sians,</HI>
came, and confirm'd all that <HI>Aristides</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
told them. When finding no way to escape,
but what they must make through the Enemy,
they prepar'd for the Fight.</P>
<P>They had increas'd their Fleet to three hun∣dred
and eighty Sail, besides Tenders, and o∣ther
Vessels, tho' it yet bore no Proportion to
that of the <HI>Persians;</HI> who having repair'd the
Damages, they sustain'd by Shipwrack, and o∣ther
ways, were in as good a Condition, as at
the first. <HI>Xerxes</HI> from an Eminence on Shore,
where he was plac'd with his Secretaries about
him, to write down the Particulars of the Acti∣on,
gave the Signal to <HI>Ariamenes</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI>
Admiral: And <HI>Themistocles</HI> having animated
the <HI>Grecians</HI> for the Defence of all that was dear
to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fight at</HI> Salamis.</NOTE> loosed from <HI>Salamis</HI> with great Reso∣lution
to meet him. The <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> in whom
<PB N="213" REF="245"/>
the Enemy confided most, were oppos'd to the
<HI>Athenians:</HI> And their whole Fleet being drawn
up distinctly according to their several Nations,
kept their Stations very well in the open Seas;
but when they began to enter the Streights,
they gave the <HI>Grecians</HI> an Opportunity of exer∣ting
their Skill, and Discipline, without being
able to use the only Advantage they had in their
Numbers. The Admiral, who led the Van,
fell in with great Fury, but was sunk at the
first Charge; which created such a Terror,
and Confusion, that they immediately tack'd
about, and made to Sea; but were fiercely pur∣su'd
by the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who took some, and disa∣bled
others, by brushing off their Oars, and
striking them through with the Beaks of their
Vessels. To add to which, the <HI>Ionians,</HI> with
whom <HI>Themistocles</HI> had been tampering before
the Engagement, took this Occasion to draw off
from the Line of Battel. In the other Wing
the Contest was vigorous on both Sides, and
for sometime doubtful, 'till the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> and
<HI>Cyprians</HI> being driven on Shore, the <HI>Athenians</HI>
made head upon the rest, who being not able
to bear the Shock, retir'd in so great Disorder,
that they fell foul one of another. Those
who kept the Sea, were pursu'd, and worsted
by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> whilst the <HI>Aeginetans,</HI> who
had possess'd the Streights of <HI>Attica,</HI> intercept∣ed
others, as they were making to the Port.
By this means the <HI>Grecians</HI> obtain'd a great and
glorious Victory, having sunk above two'hundred
of the <HI>Persian</HI> Gallies, besides what they
took, and dispers'd their whole Fleet, with the
Loss of only forty of their own Ships.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="246"/>
<HI>Xerxes</HI> astonish'd at this Overthrow, and not
knowing what Measures to take, <HI>Mardonius</HI> ac∣costed
him in this Juncture, extenuated the
Loss, and laid the whole blame upon the Cowar∣dise
of the <HI>Auxiliaries:</HI> But withal advis'd him
to return speedily to his Kingdom, least the
the Fame of his ill Success, which generally re∣presents
things worse than they are, should oc∣casion
any Commotions in his Absence. He
engaged, <HI>If he would leave him three hundred
thousand choice Men, to subdue all</HI> Greece
<HI>to his Glory; or if the Event prov'd otherwise, that
he would take it to himself, without any Reflection
upon his Master's Honour.</HI> This Advice was
very well receiv'd by <HI>Xerxes,</HI> who thinking he
had done enough to vindicate his Honour in
the taking of <HI>Athens,</HI> which was the chief Pre∣tence
of the War, prepar'd to march home at
the Head of his Army, leaving Part of it with
<HI>Mardonius,</HI> not so much out of hopes of reduc∣ing
<HI>Greece,</HI> as for fear of being pursu'd. These
were the Resolutions in a Council held just after
the Fight: And the Night following the
Fleet set Sail in great Confusion from <HI>Phaleru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
towards the <HI>Hellespont;</HI> but was pursu'd by
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who losing Sight of them, put
in at <HI>Andros</HI> one of the <HI>Cyclades;</HI> where it was
propos'd to break down the Bridge of Ships, and
hinder the Passage of the Land Forces, in hopes
of cutting them off, or forcing them to an ad∣vantageous
Peace, But <HI>Eurybiades,</HI> or, accor∣ding
to <HI>Plutarch, Aristides</HI> justly fearing, least
the Enemy, if a Retreat were deny'd him,
might out of pare Necessity turn Valiant, and
open a Way with Sword in Hand into their
Country, since he could not have it upon easier
<PB N="215" REF="247"/>
Terms into his own, represented to them, <HI>That
they were like to have Enemies enough without
giving themselves the Trouble of increasing them;
and that rather than take away that Bridge, they
ought, if possible, to lay another for them. The∣mistocles</HI>
gave in to this Advice, and sent to <HI>Xerxes</HI>
by the same Messenger he made use of at <HI>Sa∣lamis,</HI>
and under the same Colour of Friend∣ship,
to let him know the <HI>Grecians</HI> Design of in∣tercepting
his Passage, if he did not secure it
by a speedy Retreat. He no sooner heard of
it, but leaving his Captains to take care of the
Army, he hasten'd with a small Retinue to the
Sea, which he reach'd forty five Days after
the Fight;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Xerxes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Flight.</HI></NOTE> and finding the Bridge shatter'd by
the Winter Storms, he secur'd himself in a pri∣vate
Boat, So strange, and sudden was the Re∣verse
of Fortune, that this haughty Monarch,
whose Army was a Burden to the Earth,
skulk'd about without the Attendance even of
his Domesticks; and he who cover'd the Ocean
with his Fleet, and pretended to shackle the
Winds and Waves, was toss'd about in a poor
Fishing-boat, 'till at last he arriv'd in <HI>Asia!</HI>
The Army, which was order'd to follow him,
being harass'd, and fatigu'd with a continual
March, Famine came to compleat their Misery.
This brought a Pestilence along with it, as
<HI>Artabanus</HI> had foretold; which made such a
Ravage among them, that they were attended
by another Army of Beasts, and Birds of Prey,
which seiz'd them as they dropt; and those
who surviv'd this Mortality, came to their King
at <HI>Sardis.</HI></P>

<P>I. THIS being the Fate of these numerous
Forces, <HI>Greece</HI> had some little Respite
to provide for her further Security, which had
hitherto been almost wholly owing to <HI>Themi∣stocles.</HI>
And this was testify'd in the most so∣lemn
manner at the Altar, where it being de∣manded
of the Officers, <HI>Who had deserv'd best
of his Country?</HI> Every one gave the first Vote
for himself, and the second for <HI>Themistocles.</HI>
It was further confirm'd by the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI>
carrying him with them to <HI>Sparta;</HI> where gi∣ving
the Rewards of Valour to <HI>Enrybiades,</HI> and
of Wisdom, and Conduct to <HI>Themistocles,</HI> they
crown'd him with Olive, gave him the Prece∣dency,
presented him with a rich Chariot, and
conducted him with three hundred Horse to
the Confines of their Territories: Which ex∣traordinary
Marks of Esteem, and coming from
so severe, and jealous a State, made all <HI>Greece</HI>
look upon him as the <HI>common Deliverer.</HI> When
afterwards he appear'd at the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games,
the Spectators were wholly taken up in extol∣ling,
gazing, and pointing at him: Which
touch'd him so sensibly, that he could not for∣bear
<PB N="217" REF="249"/>
discovering his Transport to his Friends,
telling 'em, <HI>That he that Day reaped the Fruit
of all his Labours.</HI> Not that this general Ap∣plause
was without an Allay of Envy; particu∣larly
a <HI>Seriphian</HI> infinuated to him, <HI>That he de∣riv'd
his Honour more from the Greatness, and
Splendor of his Country, than from his personal
Merit: You are in the right on't,</HI> says Themi∣stocles;
<HI>for I should never have been esteem'd,
if I had been of</HI> Seriphus, <HI>nor you, tho' you had
been of</HI> Athens. <HI>Themistocles</HI> after the Flight
of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> spent some time in levying Contri∣butions
of the Islands, which had sided with
the Enemy. He told the <HI>Andrians, He came
attended with two powerful Divinities,</HI> Persua∣sion,
<HI>and</HI> Necessity; to which they answer'd,
<HI>They had two as powerful to oppose to them,</HI> Po∣verty
<HI>and</HI> Impossibility: Whereupon he block'd
'em up for some time, but finding them too
well fortify'd, was forc'd to retire.</P>
<P><HI>Mardonius</HI> in the mean while took up his
Winter-Quarters in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> and the Confines of
<HI>Macedon;</HI> where having pick'd up fifty thou∣sand
Men, besides the three hundred thousand
left him by <HI>Xerxes,</HI> he began to prosecute the
War. But he had conceiv'd such a dread of
the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that he first endeavour'd to take
them off with Promises not only of an honour∣able
Peace, but of the Friendship of the King
his Master; engaging further <HI>to rebuild their
Temples, to give 'em a vast Sum of Mony, and
constitute them Lords of all</HI> Greece. The <HI>La∣cedaemonians</HI>
alarm'd at these Offers, immedi∣ately
dispatch'd their Ambassadors to <HI>Athens,</HI>
to tell 'em, <HI>They hop'd they had more Justice,
and Gratitude, than to desert those, who were
<PB N="218" REF="250"/>
engaged with the</HI> Persian <HI>purely upon their Ac∣count;
at least that they had more Respect to the
Memory of their Ancestors, than to prove instru∣mental
in the enslaving those, whom they had so
gloriously rescu'd:</HI> And least they should urge
the Necessity they were reduc'd to, as forcing
them to a mean Compliance, <HI>That they should
send their Wives, and Children to be maintain'd
at</HI> Sparta. The Answer the <HI>Athenians</HI> return'd,
was, <HI>That they forgave their Enemies attempting
to buy them off, since they had no Notion of any
thing more valuable than Wealth; but could not
so easily pardon the</HI> Lacedaemonians <HI>mercenary
Thoughts of them, who seem'd to lay very little
Stress upon what they had done and suffer'd in De∣fence
of the common Liberty, when they propos'd
to 'em to fight for Bread.</HI> After which <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sti∣des</HI>
bringing back the Ambassadors into the
Assembly, charg'd 'em to tell the <HI>Lacedaemoni∣ans</HI>
in short, <HI>That all the Treasure in the World
was not of that Value with the People of</HI> Athens,
<HI>As the Liberty of</HI> Greece. Then the <HI>Athenians</HI>
directed their Discourse to <HI>Alexander</HI> King of
<HI>Macedon,</HI> who came from <HI>Mardonius;</HI> and
pointing to the Sun, <HI>As long as that continues
his Course, so long, said they, shall the Citizens
of</HI> Athens <HI>wage War with the</HI> Persians <HI>for that
Country, which hath been wasted, and those Tem∣ples,
which have been prophan'd and burnt by
them.</HI> And when <HI>Alexander</HI> press'd them fur∣ther,
and would have interpos'd as a Mediator,
they thank'd him for his good Intentions, but
caution'd him as a Friend, not to attempt any
thing more of that kind, for fear of being insul∣ted
by the People.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="251"/>
<HI>Mardonius</HI> upon this peremptory Answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mardonious <HI>enters</HI> A∣thens.</NOTE>
invaded <HI>Attica,</HI> and entered the City ten Months
after <HI>Xerxes</HI> had taken it, the Inhabitants ha∣ving
again convey'd themselves to <HI>Salamis,</HI> and
other neighbouring Places, 'till they could be
join'd by their Confederates. Thither he sent
to them a second Offer of the same Conditi∣ons;
which they were so far from accepting,
that they ston'd <HI>Lycidas</HI> a Senator, the same
whom <HI>Demosthenes</HI> calls <HI>Cyrsilus,</HI> for only mo∣ving,
that it might be taken into Considerati∣on;
and his Wife and Children met with the
same Treatment from the Women. Then they
sent pressing Instances to <HI>Sparta</HI> to hasten their
Supplies: But the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> being intent
upon their old Method of sortifying the <HI>Isth∣mus,</HI>
put them off with dilatory Excuses, 'till
at last the <HI>Athenians</HI> told 'em plainly, <HI>The little
Regard they express'd for the common Interest,
would oblige them to follow their Example, and
provide for themselves; and that their Defence of
the</HI> Isthmus, <HI>would be very little Security to</HI> Pe∣loponnesus
<HI>in general, if they, who were Ma∣sters
of the Seas about it, should join with the
Enemy.</HI> These Menaces had so good an Ef∣fect,
that when they sent next to the <HI>Ephori,</HI>
to know their final Rcsolution, they told the
Messengers, that five thousand Men, attended
with seven thousand of the <HI>Helots</HI> were actually
on their March towards <HI>Attica;</HI> and gave 'em
leave to levy five thousand more in the <HI>Spartan</HI>
Territories and follow them. These Forces
were join'd at the <HI>Isthmus</HI> by the other <HI>Pelo∣ponnesians;</HI>
which <HI>Mardorius</HI> having notice of,
thought fit to retire into <HI>Boeotia,</HI> as being a more
Champaign Country. But before his Depar∣ture,
<PB N="220" REF="252"/>
finding the <HI>Athenians</HI> would hearken to
no Terms, he set Fire to their City, and burnt
and demolished every thing, that had escap'd
his Master's Fury. At <HI>Eleusis</HI> the <HI>Athenians</HI>
from <HI>Salamis</HI> with the other <HI>Grecians</HI> came in:
And the whole Army being an hundred thou∣sand
(to which Number <HI>Herodotus</HI> adds ten
thousand) under the Conduct of <HI>Pausanias</HI> the
<HI>Spartan,</HI> the Son of <HI>Clcombrotus,</HI> and Protector
during the Minority of <HI>Plistarchus</HI> the Son of
<HI>Leonidas,</HI> follow'd <HI>Mardonius</HI> into <HI>Boeatia;</HI>
whose Forces lying extended along the Banks
of the River <HI>Asopus,</HI> the <HI>Grecians</HI> encamp'd over-against 'em
at the Foot of Mount <HI>Cithaeron▪</HI>
They were advantageously posted in strong
and rocky Places, all but three thousand <HI>Mega∣reans,</HI>
who lying more expos'd in the Plains,
<HI>Mardonius</HI> sent a great Detachment of Horse
against them; which broke in, and gall'd them
so on all Sides, that they were forc'd to send to
<HI>Pausanias</HI> to relieve 'em. Which not being rea∣dily
undertaken, <HI>Aristides,</HI> who commanded
the <HI>Atenian</HI> Troops, sent three hundred of his
Men to their Assistance. They stood the
Charge with great Bravery, and closing with
the Enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Gene∣ral of the</HI> Persian <HI>Horse kill'd.</HI></NOTE> kill'd <HI>Masistius</HI> General of the
<HI>Persian</HI> Horse: Upon which greater Numbers
engag'd on both Sides, 'till the <HI>Grecians</HI> with∣out
any considerable Loss carry'd off the Body
in Triumph.</P>
<P>After this <HI>Pausanias</HI> remov'd his Camp, and
advanc'd to <HI>Plataea;</HI> where the two Armies
fac'd each other with only a slight Skirmish now
and then with the <HI>Persian</HI> Horse for eleven Days
together. The reason of which was, that it
had been foretold to both Parties, <HI>That they
<PB N="221" REF="253"/>
should be Victorious, if they stood only upon the
Defensive Part.</HI> But <HI>Mardonius</HI> finding his Pro∣visions
fail, resolv'd to attack 'em the next
Morning: Which <HI>Pausanias</HI> being inform'd of,
drew up his Army, placing the <HI>Athenians</HI> in
the Right Wing opposite to the <HI>Persians,</HI> as be∣ing
better acquainted with their way of fight∣ing,
and flush;'d with their late Victories, and
his <HI>Spartans</HI> in the left, where the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who
sided with the Enemy, were to make the As∣sault.
Which <HI>Mardonius</HI> perceiving, immedi∣ately
march'd over his <HI>Persians</HI> to the Right;
and when <HI>Pausanias</HI> wheeling about again, rang'd
himself as at the first, the other still to prevent
him, did the like: So that by changing the
Order of the Battel, the Day pass'd without
Action. The <HI>Grecians</HI> supposing things would
not presently be brought to an Issue, thought
it necessary to remove their Camp for the Con∣venience
of Water; but breaking up in the
Night,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battle of</HI> Platae<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> were pretty much dispers'd. In the
Morning <HI>Mardonius</HI> imputing their Disorder to

who had been detain'd too long through
the Obstinacy of one of their own Regiments,
which insisted upon it, as not agreeable to the
<HI>Spartan</HI> Discipline, to desert their Post. How∣ever
they collecting themselves into the Order

The other <HI>Grecian</HI> Troops, as soon as they took

the Alarm, came up in scatter'd Companies to
their Relief, and made an intire Rout of it;
insomuch that <HI>Anabazus,</HI> who commanded a

themselves in their Camp with Wooden Ram∣pires.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians,</HI> who were making all the

were intercepted by five thousand of the
<HI>Thebans,</HI> and <HI>Thessalians</HI> who sided with the
<HI>Persians.</HI> However after an hot Dispute they
defeated them, and made their Way to the <HI>La∣cedaemonians,</HI>
who were now assaulting the <HI>Per∣sian</HI>
Camp. But being not so well skill'd in
that part of the War, the <HI>Athenians</HI> undertook
to storm it; and having made a considerable
Breach, the whole Army enter'd, and bearing
down all before 'em, made such an incredible
Havock, that above a hundred thousand <HI>Per∣sians</HI>
were put to the Sword. For <HI>Pausanias</HI>
in regard of their Numbers, not thinking it
safe to take any Prisoners, would give no
Quarter. It is said, that of the three hundred
thousand <HI>Persians</HI> who came into the Field,
there escap'd scarce three thousand besides the
forty thousand who fled: And this Victory
was obtain'd with so little Loss on the <HI>Greci∣ans</HI>
Side, that we may very well take up with
the highest Account of it, since it mentions
but ten thousand Men, and serves rather to fix
the Probability of the Action in general, than
to derogate from the Honour of it. The Bat∣tel
being over, the <HI>Grecians</HI> bury'd their dead▪
to which time <HI>Diodorus</HI> refers the Original of
Funeral Games, and Orations. But of the first
<PB N="223" REF="255"/>
of these Institutions we have several Instances
in the Heroes before, and at the time of the
<HI>Trojan</HI> War, it being this, to which they ow'd
a great part of their Divinity: And the latter
is by some ascrib'd to <HI>Solon</HI> as a part of his
Constitution; which from thence obtain'd all
over <HI>Greece;</HI> it being thought not only an
Encouragement to the Living, but also a great
Accession to the Happiness of the Dead, to have
their Exploits enumerated by a publick Ora∣tor:
And therefore to perpetuate the Memo∣ry
of such, as had done very eminent Service
for their Country, the <HI>Panegyrick</HI> was con∣stantly
repeated upon an Anniversary Day. In
the Camp they found a prodigious Quantity
of Treasure; the Division of which, <HI>Justin</HI>
says, first infected <HI>Greece</HI> with the Luxury of
Riches. From hence they march'd to <HI>Thebes;</HI>
where after some little Opposition, the Heads
of the Revolt to the <HI>Persian,</HI> were deliver'd
up to them, and put to Death.</P>
<P>II. To crown this Success in <HI>Boeotia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Affairs at Sea.</HI></NOTE> we
must take a View of the Affairs at Sea. The
greatest part of the <HI>Persian</HI> Fleet after the De∣feat
at <HI>Salamis,</HI> winter'd at <HI>Cumae;</HI> and in the
Spring mov'd to <HI>Samos,</HI> both to guard, and to
awe the Coasts of <HI>Asia.</HI> The <HI>Grecians</HI> in the
mean while were refitting their Ships at <HI>Aegi∣na;</HI>
whither the <HI>Chians</HI> sent to them to free
them from the <HI>Persian</HI> Tyranny, and got
them as far as <HI>Delos.</HI> While they staid here
to learn what Posture the Enemy was in, they
were again sollicited by the <HI>Samians,</HI> to take
this Opportunity of putting out to Sea, whilst
<PB N="224" REF="256"/>
the <HI>Ionians</HI> in general were well affected to
them, and would certainly come in, when they
saw a Power likely to protect them. They
immediately fet Sail under the Conduct of
<HI>Leutychides</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> Admiral, and <HI>Xanthip∣pus</HI>
the <HI>Athenian:</HI> At whose Approach the <HI>Per∣sians</HI>
made to Land; and at <HI>Mycale</HI> a Promon∣tory
of <HI>Ionia</HI> hal'd their Gallies on Shore, shut∣ting 'em
up with a Wall, and a deep Trench;
and on the other side they were cover'd by
sixty thousand Foot, who were left under the
Command of <HI>Tigranes</HI> to secure the Continent.
<HI>Leutychides</HI> made to Shore after them, and by
a publick Crier animated the <HI>Ionians</HI> to revolt:
After which he landed his Forces, and prepa∣red
the next Day to sight them. The <HI>Per∣sians</HI>
finding the <HI>Ionians</HI> wavering, disarm'd the
<HI>Samians,</HI> sent the <HI>Milesians</HI> to defend the Pas∣sages
about <HI>Mycale,</HI> and so dispers'd the rest,
that they should be in a manner oblig'd to
fight in Conjunction with the other Troops.
The <HI>Grecians</HI> drew up their Army in two Bo∣dies;
the one consisting chiefly of <HI>Athenians,</HI>
and <HI>Corinthians,</HI> kept the Plain, whilst the other
of <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> march'd over Hills and Pre∣cipices,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fight at</HI> Mycale.</NOTE>
to gain the highest Ground. The Bat∣tel
being join'd, great Courage and Resoluti∣on
shew'd on both Sides; and the Fortune of
the Day continu'd a great while doubtful, 'till
the <HI>Samians,</HI> and <HI>Milesians,</HI> took their Oppor∣tunity
of deserting from the <HI>Persians,</HI> and were
follow'd by most of the <HI>Asiatick Grecians.</HI> The
<HI>Persians</HI> still endeavour'd to keep the Field, but
were soon routed, and pursu'd with great
Slaughter to their very Tents. The <HI>Athenian</HI>
Body had made themselves Matters of the
<PB N="225" REF="257"/>
Field, before the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> could come
up to their Assistance: So that all the Share
these latter had in the Action, was to kill, and
disperse some of the <HI>Persian</HI> Troops, which
were making a pretty regular Retreat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tigranes <HI>the</HI> Persian <HI>General kill'd.</HI></NOTE> There
fell forty thousand of the <HI>Persians</HI> with <HI>Tigra∣nes</HI>
their General: And as they fought with
a Desire to retrieve the Honour of their Arms,
the <HI>Grecians</HI> lost a greater Proportion in this,
than in any other of the Engagements. This
Battel was fought on the Evening of the same
Day with that at <HI>Plataea;</HI> the News of which
Victory arriving in the Camp at <HI>Mycale</HI> before
the Engagement, contributed in a great mea∣sure
towards the Success of it: So that it is
not material to inquire, whether <HI>Leutychides</HI>
had actually Intelligence from <HI>Plataea,</HI> or,
(which is most probable from the vast Di∣stance)
that he invented it as a Stratagem, to
make his Soldiers charge with the greater Vi∣gour,
and Alacrity; since the bare Rumour had
this good Effect, and since the thing it self
happen'd accordingly.</P>
<P>To compleat this Victory, the <HI>Grecians</HI>
burnt the <HI>Persian</HI> Ships in the Haven, and re∣turn'd
with great Spoil to <HI>Samos;</HI> where they
receiv'd the <HI>Ionians,</HI> and <HI>Aeolians</HI> as their Con∣federates.
And as they had once more freed
them from the <HI>Persian</HI> Yoke, they fell into a
Debate about transplanting them into <HI>Europe,</HI>
since otherwise they would be continually a∣larm'd,
and they could not be ready upon all
Occasions to relieve them. But the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
who pretended the greatest Right to dispose of
them, as being their Founders, oppos'd it;
and promising to protect them in the Defence
<PB N="226" REF="258"/>
of their Liberty, they were continu'd in <HI>Asia▪</HI>
After which the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> return'd home,
leaving the <HI>Athenians</HI> to recover the <HI>Chersone∣sus</HI>
of <HI>Thrace.</HI> Accordingly they lay before
<HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stus,</HI> whither some of the <HI>Persians</HI> had retir'd,
'till having starv'd them, they took the Town,
and hang'd the Governor. It being late in
the Year, they wintered here; and in the Spring
return'd with their Navy to <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>Thus were the <HI>Grecians</HI> at last freed from
the Invasion of an Army no less ridiculous in
Success, than terrible in Appearance, having,
like Locusts, overwhelm'd their Country for
two Years together. It was a Deliverance ra∣ther
to be wish'd than hop'd for; since it could
not have been effected, but by so many signal
Overthrows both by Sea and Land, in any one
of which a Miscarriage must have prov'd fatal
to all <HI>Greece.</HI> To account for this prodigious
Success, we are to consider how the Dissolu∣tion
of the Regal Power had at this time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir'd
the <HI>Grecians</HI> with the Thoughts of Liberty;
so that it produc'd even in the private Sol∣diers
such uncommon Notions of Honour, and
Resolution, that they were harden'd beyond a
Sense of their Danger. And this personal Bra∣very
was so well directed by the Conduct, and
Vigilance of their Officers, that they generally
fought to Advantage, by drawing the <HI>Persians</HI>
into Streights, and Passes, so that they could
not enlarge their Front, nor consequently make
use of their Numbers. To add to which,
there was a profess'd Emulation among the se∣veral
States of <HI>Greece;</HI> which, tho' it created
some little Difficulties in adjusting the business
of Precedency and Command, had certainly a
<PB N="227" REF="259"/>
good Effect as to the Publick, when it came
to Action, and had no Object to vent it self
upon, but the common Enemy. Yet would
not all these concurring Circumstances have
prevail'd in so eminent a Degree, if they had
not had to do with an Enemy, who was just
their Reverse, a slavish confus'd Multitude,
and wrap'd up in a slothful Security. The
<HI>Persians</HI> had before this Expedition lost all the
Captains of their Founder <HI>Cyrus;</HI> and with
them that Spirit and Discipline, which had given
them the Promise of a glorious, as well as an ex∣tensive
Empire. So that they had nothing to
trust to but their Numbers; and even this
was so far from proving an Advantage, that
they were a dead Weight, and a Burden to
themselves, and serv'd rather to encrease the
Fury of the Enemy, than to defeat it.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Xerxes,</HI> he lay at <HI>Sardis</HI> expecting the
Event of these Battels, 'till finding it impos∣sible
to retrieve such a long Train of Miscar∣riages,
he retir'd farther into his Country▪
Where we will leave him abandon'd to a Course
of Riot and Luxury, without expatiating up∣on
those black Scenes of Incest, Sacrilege, and
Murder, which made the latter Part of his Reign
as notoriously scandalous at home, as the first
Part of it had been trifling abroad; and which
at last occasion'd his being murder'd by his
own Subjects. It is sufficient here to observe,
that whatever successful Attempts were made
by the <HI>Persians</HI> in other Parts, neither <HI>Xerxes,</HI>
nor his Successors did ever after this Defeat at
<HI>Mycale,</HI> act offensively against <HI>Greece.</HI> And
tho' the <HI>Persian</HI> Kingdom continu'd for seve∣ral
Ages, and with the Character of the great∣est
<PB N="228" REF="260"/>
Empire of the known World, her Great∣ness
consisted rather in Riches, and Extent of
Territory, than any memorable Atchievements▪
And the Continuance of it was owing to no∣thing
more, than those intestine Broils among
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> which we shall find, by the Pro∣secution
of their Story, diverted them from
pushing their Conquests in <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con∣duct of <HI>Themisto∣cles</HI> in re∣building the Walls of <HI>Athens.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Athenians</HI> with their Families be∣ing
return'd, employ'd their Share of the
Booty in rebuilding their City. But as their
Walls took in a much la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger Compass than be∣fore,
this gave some Umbrage to the <HI>Lacedae∣monians,</HI>
who truly enough concluded, <HI>That
if this City, when it lay in Ruins, could do such
Wonders, what would it not aspire to, when it
was so fortify'd?</HI> Wherefore they dispatch'd
Ambassadors to dissuade them from carrying
on there Works, because they would only
serve as Garrisons for the Enemy, and be the
Seat of a future War. This put a Stop to
their Proceedings for the presents,'till <HI>Themi∣stocles</HI>
encourag'd them to go on, whilst he un∣dertook
to answer it at <HI>Sparta.</HI> Where having
gain'd what time he could, before he had Au∣dience,
the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> began to suspect his
Design, and renew'd their Remonstrances. He
advis'd them not to take up with every idl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Report, but to send again, and see how little
the Works were advanc'd. Thus having
a∣mus'd them, 'till the Walls were finish'd, he ad∣dress'd
himself to the <HI>Ephori,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elling 'em plainly.
<HI>That</HI> Athens <HI>was now in a Condition to keep
out any Enemy, whether Foreign, or Domestick▪
that in what the</HI> Athenians <HI>had done, both the
<PB N="229" REF="261"/>
Law of Nations, and the publick Interest of
<HI>Greece</HI> would sufficiently bear them out; in short
that they were best <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to judge of their own
Affairs, without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Direction, or Controul of
any other State; <HI>adding farther,</HI> That it was
done by his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and that whatever injury
they offer'd to him, they must expect it would be
return'd upon their own Ambassadors who were
detain'd at</HI> Athens. These Declarations car∣ry'd
too much Weight, and Truth with 'em,
to be easily refuted: So that the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>
finding they could not help themsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, stifled
their Resentment, and dismiss'd <HI>Themistocles.</HI>
He was receiv'd at <HI>Athens</HI> with as much Joy,
as if he had actually triumph'd over <HI>Sparta:</HI>
And indeed this was the first considerable Step
towards throwing off that Superiority, which
she had hitherto exacted. After this he set
himself to enlarging, and strengthning the
Port <HI>Piraeus,</HI> omitting nothing either by Sea, or
Land, that might serve not only to secure the
<HI>Athenians</HI> from abroad, but also to fix their
Dominion at home. As an Expedient for
this latter, he propos'd burning the <HI>Lacedaemo∣nian</HI>
Fleet, as it lay in Harbour; but this was
such a manifest piece of Injustice, that he
could not make <HI>Aristides</HI> consent to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> having still some footing in
<HI>Europe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M</NOTE> and the <HI>Lesser Asia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3527.</NOTE> thirty <HI>Athenian</HI>
Gallies were mann'd out under the Conduct of
Aristides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 75. 4▪</NOTE> and twenty <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> under <HI>Pausa∣nias.</HI>
They set Sail to <HI>Cyprus;</HI> where they freed
several Towns, which the <HI>Persians</HI> had ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rison∣ed;
from whence they re-imbark'd, and took <HI>By∣zantium.
Pausanias,</HI> who was naturally haugh∣ty,
and imperious, and sufficiently elevated
<PB N="230" REF="262"/>
with the Business or <HI>Plataea,</HI> presum'd yet fur∣ther
upon the Success of this Expedition, and
carry'd it with so much Insolence, and Seve∣rity
to the Confederates, that they were glad
of any Occasion to get rid of him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pausanias <HI>try'd, and acquitted.</HI></NOTE> So that
being complain'd of at <HI>Sparta,</HI> he was recall'd,
and try'd, being particularly charg'd with a∣spiring
to the Sovereignty of <HI>Greece,</HI> and that
in order to it, he held Intelligence with the
Enemy: But the Evidence not being full e∣nough
against him, he was acquitted, with the
Loss only of his Command.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Com∣mand at Sea trans∣ferr'd to the</HI> Athen∣nians.</NOTE> However this
was a Means of transferring the Command at
Sea to the <HI>Athenians.</HI> For the <HI>Ionians,</HI> who
were always best affected to them, imme∣diately
put themselves under <HI>Aristides</HI>'s Prote∣ction;
and all the other Cities without the
<HI>Isthmus</HI> were so taken with the Candor and
Sweetness of his Temper, that they soon fol∣low'd
their Example: So that when another
was sent from <HI>Sparta</HI> in <HI>Pausanias</HI>'s room, the
Confederates would not admit him. The <HI>La∣cedaemonians</HI>
could not but fancy themselves o∣ver-reach'd,
and trick'd out of their Command
at Sea; and tho' they made no publick Noise
about it, yet it came to be debated among
themselves, whether they should declare War
against <HI>Athens.</HI> This reviv'd an old Prophecy
of the Oracl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which had bid them <HI>Beware of
having but half an Empire,</HI> and which they
could not interpret otherwise, than in Relation
to their present Circumstances. So that the
general Opinion was for War; but <HI>Hetaemari∣das</HI>
a Senator dissuaded it, urging among other
Reas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, <HI>That it did not so properly belong to the</HI>
Spartans, <HI>to trouble themselves about Sea-Affairs.</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="263"/>
The truth is, they were not in a Condition at
present to contest it; and therefore they wav'd
the Thoughts of this War, to join in the Pro∣secution
of that in <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>The Charge of the War being thus devolv'd
upon the <HI>Athenians,</HI> they had a Liberty given
them to rate all the Cities in such a Proportion
of Ships, and Mony, as they thought necessary
for the Support of it. Whatever Contributions
had hitherto been paid in the Confederate Wars,
this was the first regular Tax we find mention'd
in <HI>Greece.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first Tax in</HI> Greece.</NOTE> It being appointed by <HI>Aristides,</HI>
a∣mounted to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">About 86250 l. Sterl.</NOTE> four hundred and sixty Talents,
and was deposited at <HI>Delos</HI> as the publick Trea∣sury.
It was collected at first with so much
Ease, and Chearfulness, and managed with such
Integrity, that upon this Account it was call'd,
<HI>The happy Time of</HI> Greece, and compar'd to the
<HI>Age</HI> of <HI>Saturn.</HI> This mighty Privilege, with
which the <HI>Athenians</HI> were invested chiefly up∣on
the Opinion of <HI>Aristides</HI>'s Justice, was a
Confirmation of that Power, they had so late∣ly
wrested from the <HI>Lacedaemonians.</HI> But as it
was the Beginning of their Greatness in this
Age, so it was of their Ruin in the next, when
the Tribute came to be rais'd first to six hun∣dred
Talents, and soon after to one thousand
three hundred, and the Mony misapply'd.</P>
<P>The General Commander in this War,
was <HI>Cimon</HI> the Son of <HI>Miltiades.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Rise of</HI> Cimon.</NOTE> I mention'd
the Piety of this young Man in taking his Fa∣ther's
Fine upon him: And as he was insolvent,
it happen'd, that <HI>Callias</HI> a rich Citizen offer'd to
marry his half-Sister <HI>Elpinice,</HI> and discharge it.
Whether he did not think it a Match suitable
to her Quality, or that he was marry'd to her
<PB N="232" REF="264"/>
himself, (which was allowable by <HI>Solon</HI>'s Laws)
he did not comply with the Proposal; but she
declaring, <HI>She would not suffer any of</HI> Miltia∣des's
<HI>Children to die in Prison,</HI> accepted it. Be∣ing
thus see at Liberty, he did good Service in
the Army; and was soon taken Notice of, as
one who acted with the Courage of his Father,
and the Judgment of <HI>Themistocles,</HI> and with
more Openness, and Sincerity than either.
<HI>Aristides,</HI> who easily discover'd this honest
<HI>Genius</HI> in him, took care to cultivate it, and set
him up as a Counter-poise to the Craft, and
Ambition of <HI>Themistocles:</HI> By which means he
was advanc'd to the highest Employments both
at home and abroad.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Expe∣dition to</HI> Thrace, <HI>and the Islands.</HI></NOTE> And being now strengthen'd
by an Accession of the Allies, he went into
<HI>Thrace,</HI> where he took <HI>Eion,</HI> a Town situate
upon the River <HI>Strymon,</HI> and chastis'd the bor∣dering
<HI>Thracians,</HI> who had supply'd it with Pro∣visions.
But the Behaviour of <HI>Butes</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI>
Governor of this Town, is beyond any thing
that is recorded of his Countrymen during this
War. For finding it impossible to hold out any
longer, he threw all his Treasure into the Ri∣ver,
and then erected a Funeral Pile, whereon
he burnt himself, and his whole Family. From
thence <HI>Cimon</HI> made to the Island <HI>Scyrus,</HI> inhabi∣ted
by some of the <HI>Pelasgi,</HI> and <HI>Dolopes</HI> a Nest
of Pirates; and by expelling them, open'd the
Trad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea: And all these Places
were planted with <HI>Athenian</HI> Colonies. His next
Attemp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was upon the <HI>Carystians of Euboea,</HI> whom
he brought over upon Terms; he afterwards
reduc'd <HI>Naxos,</HI> which had revolted, and de∣priv'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nhabitants of their Liberty. Which
was the first Instance of the <HI>Athenians</HI> exerting
<PB N="233" REF="265"/>
their Power in that Kind▪ beyond the Laws of
the Confederacy; tho' it was afterwards fre∣quently
practis'd, as the other Cities revolted,
to which they were very inclinable upon ac∣count
of the Tribute, which the <HI>Athenians</HI> be∣gan
to exact with so much Rigour, as made the
Thing burdensome, and their Government o∣dious.
To remedy which, <HI>Cimon</HI> took a very
plausible Method, and no less advantageous to
<HI>Athens,</HI> than easie to her Allies. For perceiving
most of them grown weary of the War, especi∣ally
since the Seat of it was so far remov'd, that
they were under no present Apprehensions of
Danger, and that they were willing enough to
continue the Tax, provided their actual Atten∣dance
might be dispenc'd with, he accepted
their several Proportions in Mony, and Ships
unmann'd. So that while they were enjoying
this Interval of Repose, <HI>Athens</HI> was the only
State kept under constant Discipline, and well
provided; and then they were soon forc'd to
Court, and flatter those, whom they had con∣tributed
to make no less formidable in <HI>Greece,</HI>
than <HI>Persia;</HI> 'till they fell to that Degree of
Subjection, as of Allies they almost became Tri∣butaries,
and Slaves.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Pausanias</HI> during these Transactions kept
towards the-Sea, to concert Measures with the
<HI>Persian;</HI> but his Designs were still travers'd by
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Generals; upon which he under∣went
a second Trial: And whether his Pra∣ctises
were not yet fully detected, or that they
were tender in the Prosecution of one of
the Royal Blood, and who had once deserv'd so
well, he was again discharg'd. But persisting in
<PB N="234" REF="266"/>
his first Intentions, and finding his Affairs ad∣vance
slowly abroad, he thought to make
quicker Dispatch of it at home; and in Order
to it about this time excited the <HI>Helots</HI> to rebel.
The Discovery of this serv'd to confirm all the
rest; and Letters were produc'd, by which it
appear'd, that he not only corresponded with
<HI>Xerxes,</HI> but that he had actually contracted to
betray <HI>Greece</HI> to him, and as a Reward was to
receive his Daughter in Marriage.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The End of</HI> Pausanias.</NOTE> Being thus
convicted, he had some Intimation of his Sen∣tence,
and took Sanctuary in the Temple of
<HI>Minerva;</HI> where the Door being made up, (to
which End his Mother is said to have brought
the first Stone) he was starv'd to Death; and
by this Treason to his Country forfeited the
Glory of having rescu'd it by the most signal
Victory, that ever was obtain'd in <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>His Fate drew along with it that of <HI>Themisto∣cles;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Themisto∣cles <HI>his Death,</HI></NOTE>
who had some time before been banish'd
by the <HI>Ostracism,</HI> and liv'd in great Esteem at
<HI>Argos.</HI> There were found among <HI>Pausanias</HI>'s
Papers some Hints of a Correspondence carry'd
on between these two for promoting the Affairs
of the <HI>Persian:</HI> And if he were engaged in that
Interest, his Country's Ingratitude might very
well prompt him to it. But whatever the
Matter of Fact was, it was sufficiently aggrava∣ted
by the Envy and Malice of the <HI>Lacedaemo∣nians,</HI>
who having receiv'd from him the seve∣rest
Checks to their Ambition, never left off,
'till they got him accus'd and condemn'd, with∣out
being heard. Which he having Notice of,
fled first to <HI>Corcyra,</HI> then to <HI>Epirus:</HI> where be∣ing
pursu'd, he got with much difficulty into
<HI>Asia,</HI> and apply'd himself to <HI>Xerxes. Thucydi∣des</HI>
<PB N="235" REF="267"/>
says, contrary to the general Opinion, that
his Son <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> was then upon the Throne:
But perhaps he was only declar'd Heir to the
Crown, it being Customary among the <HI>Persian</HI>
Kings to name their Successor some time before
they dy'd, as we find <HI>Darius</HI> did before his Ex∣pedition;
at least this is the most plausible
Way of reconciling the Difference. <HI>Xerxes</HI> re∣ceiv'd
him with uncommon Marks of Friend∣ship,
and Esteem, hoping by his means to
make another more successful Attempt upon
<HI>Greece.</HI> He gave him three Cities to maintain
him; so that having liv'd some time in great
Splendor, he dy'd, as some say, a natural
Death at <HI>Magnesia.</HI> But that which is recor∣ded
most to his Glory, is, that having en∣gag'd
the <HI>Persian</HI> not to undertake the War a∣gainst
<HI>Greece</HI> without him, he poison'd himself,
as being the most honourable Means of acquit∣ting
himself both to <HI>Xerxes,</HI> and his Country.
Whatever his Intentions were, his Actions were
free from Guilt to the last: So that his resi∣ding
in an Enemies Country, seems to have
been rather of Necessity, than Choice, being
first abandon'd, and then persecuted by the In∣solence,
and Jealousie of an ungrateful Mob;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and Cha∣racter</HI></NOTE>
who could not at the same time but acknow∣ledge
him for the greatest Man in <HI>Greece,</HI> and
one born for its Preservation. 'Tis certain,
that he first gave the <HI>Athenians</HI> a right Notion
of Sea Affairs; and not only laid the Founda∣tion
of their Naval Glory, but brought it to
a Degree of Perfection, establishing it as a
Maxim, <HI>That their present, and future Safety de∣pended
intirely upon their Shipping,</HI> Tho' they
were not presently convinc'd of this Truth;
<PB N="236" REF="268"/>
and therefore reproach'd him with <HI>Taking them
from the Spear, and the Shield, and binding them
to the Bank, and the Oar.</HI> He was no less to
be admir'd in Peace, than War, providing
equally for the Glory, as well as the Safety of
the State: Upon which Account, he profess'd,
<HI>He could not play upon the Lute; but that in lieu
of it, he could raise a great City out of a small
one.</HI> He had such a discerning <HI>Genius,</HI> that
no body foresaw Things at a greater Distance,
or pass'd a quicker, and truer Judgment of
them in Cases of present Difficulty. These
natural Advantages he set off with a great deal
of Artifice. For Instance, when he had a
mind to be popular, he made use of his Memo∣ry,
to call every Citizen by his Name. When
he was Admiral, he would put off all Business
publick, and private to the Day he was to set
Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, only to raise Peoples Opinion of his Capa∣city,
and Dispatch: And so through the whole
Course of his Politicks, there was something
more fine and intricate, than <HI>Greece</HI> had hitherto
been acquainted with.</P>
<P>It was also about this time that <HI>Aristides</HI>
dy'd: Of whose Integrity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristides <HI>his Death, and Cha∣racter.</HI></NOTE> and Contempt of
Riches there cannot be a clearer Evidence, than
that he, who had been Treasurer of <HI>Greece,</HI> did
not leave enough to bury him. He had Virtue
enough to intitle him to the first Place in the
Common-wealth; but he wav'd that Pre-emi∣nence,
which others aspir'd to by a more popu∣lar
Sort of Merit, being content to act, as it
were, under <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istocles.</HI> But we must not
omit one considerable Change he effected of
himself whilst he was <HI>Archon,</HI> in repealing a
<HI>Law of Solon</HI>'s, by which the lowest Order of
<PB N="237" REF="269"/>
the People were made incapable of bearing any
Office in the Government. He naturally fa∣vour'd
the Nobility; but when he found the
People carry it high upon their Service against
the <HI>Persian,</HI> he thought it of less dangerous Con∣sequence,
that they mould be let into the Admi∣nistration
by Law, than that they should let
themselves in by Force. He study'd to make
the State as quiet at home, as it was terrible
abroad: And as an Instance of the constant, un∣biass'd
Zeal he express'd for his Country, he
would often put up his Proposals in other Peo∣ples
Names, that nothing of private Enmity
might interpose to the Prejudice of the Publick.
Thus he had at least the second Hand in raising
<HI>Athens</HI> to her present pitch of Grandeur; and as
<HI>Themistocles</HI> was the greatest, so was <HI>Aristides</HI>
the best Man of his time.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Athens</HI> being depriv'd of these Supports,
the chief Burden lay upon <HI>Cimon;</HI> who having
been successful hitherto, and being furnish'd with
more Ships, and Provisions, scour'd the <HI>As-tatick</HI>
Seas, and made to <HI>Caria;</HI> where all the <HI>Grecian</HI>
Cities upon the Sea-Coast immediately came
in; and the rest, which were garrison'd by the
<HI>Persians,</HI> he took partly by Storm, and partly
by managing Intelligence within their Walls.
After which he met with the like Success in
<HI>Lycia.</HI> So closely did he pursue them, that
he would not let them take breath, or put their
Affairs in any Posture: So that from <HI>Ionia</HI> to
<HI>Pamphylia</HI> there was not a Man appea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d for the
<HI>Persian.</HI> Having Notice that they had some
Land Forces making head against him upon the
Coasts of <HI>Pamphylia,</HI> and that they were sup∣ported
<PB N="238" REF="270"/>
by a Fleet of at least three hundred and
fifty Sail, he immediately directed his Cours<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
towards <HI>Cyprus,</HI> about which the Fleet lay
The first Opposition he met with, was at <HI>Pha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣selis</HI>

with him.</P>
<P>The whole <HI>Persian</HI> Fleet anchor'd at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

expected a Reinforcement of <HI>Phaenician</HI> Sai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and therefore declin'd fighting, 'till they could
come up: But <HI>Cimon</HI> rang'd his Gallies in such
a Posture, as to prevent their joining, and ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
force them to fight. Upon which they re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tir'd
further within the Mouth of the River<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
'till finding the <HI>Athenians</HI> making up to them
they met them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fight at</HI> Eury∣medon. A. M.</NOTE> and gave them Battel. Ha∣ving
the Superiority of an hundred Sail, they
maintain'd the Conflict for some time, but a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Upon this their Land Army drawing to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Men resolute, and flush'd with Victory, he lan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded
them before they had wiped off the Swea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and Blood of the first Engagement. <HI>Diodor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
says, they were landed by a Stratagem of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mon</HI>'s,
who dress'd the best of his Men in <HI>Plr∣sian</HI>
Habits, and put 'em on board the Vesse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he had taken. However it was, they no soone
<PB N="239" REF="271"/>
touch'd Ground, but they set up a Shout, and
ran furiously upon the Enemy, who sustain'd
the first Shock with great Obstinacy; so that
the Fight began to be very doubtful, several
principal Men of the <HI>Athenians</HI> being slain. At
length the <HI>Persians</HI> were totally routed, some
taken Prisoners, and all their Tents plunder'd;
wherein was a great deal of rich Booty, most
of which was employ'd by <HI>Cimon</HI> in publick
Buildings about the City. Thus did <HI>Cimon</HI>
obtain two intire Victories, which in some sense
may be said to surpass those of <HI>Salamis,</HI> and
<HI>Plataea,</HI> being both gain'd the same Day, and
by the same Men. And to make them yet more
compleat, he intercepted eighty Sail of <HI>Phaeni∣cians,</HI>
who knowing nothing of the Defeat, were
coming up to the Assistance of their Allies: The
Ships were all taken, and the Men either slain,
or drown'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persian</HI> after this was glad to treat upon
any Terms;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Peace concluded betwixt</HI> Greece, <HI>and</HI> Persia.</NOTE> and a Peace was concluded ex∣tremely
honourable on the <HI>Grecians</HI> Side, the
chief Articles being, <HI>That the</HI> Grecian <HI>Cities in</HI> Asia <HI>should be left in the quiet Enjoyment of their
Liberty; and that both the Land and Sea Forces
of the</HI> Persians <HI>should be kept at such a Distance
from the</HI> Grecian <HI>Seas, as not to give any Ʋm∣brage.</HI>
'Tis true, the Account of this Peace
depends chiefly upon the Authority of <HI>Plutarch;</HI>
for others place it lower, upon <HI>Cimon</HI>'s Expe∣dition
against <HI>Cyprus.</HI> To confirm which latter
Opinion, it is certain the same Inveteracy con∣tinu'd
between the two Nations, and therefore
this first Treaty was not inviolably observ'd:
But as the War was prosecuted only by the
<HI>Athenians,</HI> and that very faintly, and not so
<PB N="240" REF="272"/>
directly against the <HI>Persian,</HI> it never after this
Defeat at <HI>Eurymedon</HI> came to a decisive Battel,
nor indeed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general Actio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 'till the time
that <HI>Alexander</HI> over-run <HI>Asia.</HI> For which Rea∣sons

<P>About the time of <HI>Xerxes</HI>'s Expedition, the
Study of Philosophy was translated from
<HI>Ionia</HI> to <HI>Athens</HI> by <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> of <HI>Clazomenae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anaxago∣ras.</NOTE> who became so eminent, that he was call'd,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>The

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing the Space of 38 Years.</HEAD>
<P>1. THE <HI>Athenian</HI> Forces being withdrawn
from <HI>Asia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Cher∣sonesus <HI>subdu'd.</HI></NOTE> were employ'd in reducing
the <HI>Thracian Chersonesus.</HI> After which they
fell upon the <HI>Thasians</HI> upon the Account of
some rich Mines they were possess'd of. <HI>Ci∣mon</HI>
having defeated them at Sea, they stood
a Siege; and in the mean while desir'd the
<HI>Spartans</HI> to invade <HI>Attica.</HI> But they had at
that time their Hands full in repairing the Da∣mages
of a violent Earthquake, which had de∣stroy'd
a great many Men, with most part of
their Buildings: And <HI>Pausanias</HI> by tampering
with the <HI>Helots,</HI> had left such Impressions up∣on
them, that they took this Opportunity to
rebel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And The∣s0s.</NOTE> So that the <HI>Thasans</HI> not being able
to procure a Diversion, submitted upon Terms
in the third Year of the Siege. But Ciman in∣stead
of being rewarded for this Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cimon ac∣cus'd.</NOTE> was
accus'd of holding Intelligence with the King
of <HI>Macedon,</HI> because when the Passage was
open'd, he did not make a further Irruption
into his Territories. He urg'd several things
in his Defence, and was seconded by his Sister
<HI>Elpinice;</HI> who addressing her self to <HI>Pericles</HI> in
<PB N="242" REF="274"/>
his behalf, he answer'd her with a Smile, <HI>You
are too old,</HI> Madam, <HI>to manage Affairs of this
Nature.</HI> However he became afterwards more
mild in his Prosecution; he rose up but once
to plead against him, and then did it so faintly,
that he was easily acquitted.</P>
<P>But since we have mentioned <HI>Pericles,</HI> as
one who appear'd now with an establish'd
Character, and began to take upon him the chief
Management of Affairs in <HI>Athens,</HI> it may be
necessary to take a more distinct View of him,
that we may see both by what Steps he ar∣riv'd
to that Eminence in the State, and what
Alterations the State it self suffer'd under him,
He was descended of one of the best Families
in <HI>Athens,</HI> his Father being <HI>Xanthippus,</HI> who
had been very active against the <HI>Persian,</HI> and
bore a considerable Sway in the City, and his
Mother <HI>Agariste,</HI> the Grand-daughter of <HI>Clisfthenes.</HI>
His Education was suitable to his Birth;
and having a strange Vivacity of Parts, he ea∣sily
retain'd, and improv'd the Instructions of
the best Masters: Among whom <HI>Anaxagoras</HI>
was the chief; for as others had only furnish'd
him with some loose Notions of Philosophy,
he establish'd in him Maxims of sound Sense,
and put him upon an Enquiry into the secret
Springs, and Arts of Government. It was ob∣serv'd,
that he bore a near Resemblance to <HI>Pi∣sistratus</HI>
both in Person, and Parts: But he was
so far from thinking this an Advantage, that
it made him shy of meddling with State-As∣fairs,
least it sould be thought he was carry∣ing
on the same Designs. For this Reason his
first Service was in the Wars, where he ac∣quitted
himself with Honour: But he tool
<PB REF="275"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="243" REF="276"/>
his Opportunity, as <HI>Themistocles, Aristide,</HI> and
the other great Men went off, to apply him∣self
to the State, as his more proper Province;
where he appear'd with an extraordinary Ad∣vantage
in the <HI>Art of Speaking.</HI> He had ac∣custom'd
himsels by a Flow of Words to consute
any Opinion right or wrong; and the Use
he made of this Faculty, was to work every
thing to his own Designs. His way of haranguing
was in an <HI>Imperial Strain;</HI> from
whence most probably he had the Sirname of
<HI>Olympius,</HI> intimating, that like <HI>Jupiter, he thun∣derd
when he spoke.</HI> And then the Tunable∣ness
of his Voice, the Air of his Face, his ve∣ry
Dress, and Gesture had something of a com∣manding
Gravity, which charm'd and astonish'd
all that heard, or saw him. The chief Obstacle
to his Rise he found was <HI>Cimon,</HI> whose
Candor, Liberality, and good Service had pro∣cur'd
him a general Love, and Esteem, and who
besides had fix'd a particular Interest with the
Nobility: So that <HI>Pericles</HI> in Opposition to
him fell in with the People; and as he saw no
other way of pushing his Ambition, this made
him guilty of some mean popular Compliances,
which otherwise the Greatness of his Spirit,
and the Reservedness of his Temper would not
have consented to. As he was not yet upon
an equal Foot with <HI>Cimon,</HI> who had Mony e∣nough
to display his generous Qualities to Ad∣vantage,
and by that means to thwart his De∣signs,
this put him upon making use of the
publick Mony: So that by Bribes, Largesses,
and other Distributions, he easily gain'd the
People. Having laid this promising Foundation,
he struck next at the Council of <HI>Areopa∣gus;</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="277"/>
and by the Assistance of <HI>Ephialtes</HI> another
mighty Champion for the People, he with∣drew
most Causes from the Cognizance of that
Court, and brought the whole Order into Con∣tempt.
By these Methods he soon got the
Ascendant over all his Competitors; and if <HI>Ci∣mon</HI>
was not persecuted with any great Heat,
and Rancour, it was because he was wanted,
and through the Easiness of his Temper he
comply'd, and gave way, contenting himself ra∣ther
with the Merit, than the Reward of ser∣ving his Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> in their Distress sent for
some <HI>Athenian</HI> Succours to suppress their
Slaves: But <HI>Ephialtes</HI> oppos'd it, as a very
wrong Step to raise up, or assist a City that
was Rival to <HI>Athens;</HI> he insisted, <HI>That it was
necessary to break the Pride, and Arrogance of</HI>
Sparta; <HI>and that the best means of doing it, was
while She was down, to keep her so. Cimon</HI> ur∣ging
on the contrary, <HI>That they should not suffer</HI>
Greece <HI>to be mainad by the Loss of so consi∣derable
a Member, nor their own City to be de∣priv'd
of her Companion,</HI> obtain'd leave to march
out with a good Body to their Relief. But
however the <HI>Helots</HI> were dispers'd for the pre∣sent,
they soon got to an head again; and ha∣ving
drawn several of their Neighbours into
a Consederacy, possess'd themselves of <HI>Ithome,</HI>
the old Receptacle in the <HI>Messenian</HI> Wars.
Upon which the <HI>Spartans</HI> dispatch'd Messngers
a second time to <HI>Athens</HI> for Supplies: Which
were no sooner arriv'd, but their Minds chang'd;
so that either distrusting, or disdaining their
Service, they sent them home again. What∣ever
Cause of Resentment the <HI>Spartans</HI> had hi∣therto
<PB N="245" REF="278"/>
met with, they had still carry'd it fair,
or at least cautiously: But this was such an
open Affront, that it became the Grounds of
a long profess'd Enmity between the two
States. The <HI>Athenians</HI> vented their Anger first
upon <HI>Cimon,</HI> as a Favourer of the <HI>Lacedaemoni∣ans.</HI>
He was indeed an Admirer of their Con∣stitution,
and had Personal Obligations to them,
being at his first Rise chiefly countenanc'd by
them in Opposition to <HI>Themistocles.</HI> Besides he
had created himself Enemies by espousing the
Interest of the Nobility against <HI>Pericles,</HI> and
<HI>Ephialtes.</HI> So that upon these, and other slight
Pretences,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Rise of</HI> Pericles.</NOTE> he was forc'd to submit to the <HI>ten
Years Banisoment.</HI> But whatever was alledg'd
against him, his Case was much the same with
that of his Predecessors: He had done too
much to live easie, or safe with a People, who
fear'd none so much, as the Authors of their
Deliverance; so that they had recourse to the
<HI>Ostracism,</HI> as an Expedient always at hand; and
it was now grown so Customary, that it was
in a manner become the <HI>Test</HI> of a Man's
Merit.</P>
<P>The next Step the <HI>Athenians</HI> made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cimon ba∣nis'd.</NOTE> was to
quit their Alliance with the <HI>Spartans,</HI> and enter
into one with the <HI>Argives</HI> their prosess'd Enemies,
in which they also comprehended the
<HI>Thessalians.</HI> The jarring of these two States
gave occasion to several others to follow their
Example. Particularly about this time the In∣habitants
of <HI>Mycenae</HI> carrying it high upon their
Service in the <HI>Persian</HI> Wars, endeavour'd to recover
their ancient Splendor, by throwing off
their Dependance upon the Common-wealth
of <HI>Argos.</HI> The <HI>Argives</HI> had long look'd upon
<PB N="246" REF="279"/>
them with a jealous Eye; and took this Oppor∣tunity
of humbling them, whilst the <HI>Spartans</HI>
were too deeply engag'd in their Domestick
War, to relieve them. Accordingly they first
defeated them in the Field, and then block'd
up their City; which made a very good Defence
for some time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mycenae <HI>taken and demolish'd.</HI></NOTE> 'till being almost exhausted,
it was taken, and utterly demolish'd. This
was the End of <HI>Mycenoe</HI> which had made an
early Figure in <HI>Greece,</HI> and been the Nursery of
many of her first Heroes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Helots <HI>suppress'd.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Helots</HI> all this
while gave the <HI>Spartans</HI> a great deal of Trouble
before <HI>Ithome:</HI> But in the tenth Year of the
Siege they were forc'd to submit; and being
banish'd <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> the <HI>Athenians</HI> receiv'd
them, and settled them with their Families in
<HI>Naupactus,</HI> which they had lately taken from
the <HI>Locri Ozolae.</HI> There was also about this
time a Quarrel between <HI>Corinth,</HI> and <HI>Megara;</HI>
the latter of which Cities revolting from its
Alliance with <HI>Sparta,</HI> was protected, and garrison'd
by the <HI>Athenians:</HI> Which as it was a
new Accession to <HI>Athens,</HI> so it was the Grounds
of an inveterate Hatred betwixt that State, and
<HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P>II. But before we proceed to the Effects of
these Divisions, it will be necessary to touch
upon a new Expedition of the <HI>Athenians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Affairs in Aegypt.</HI></NOTE> in
<HI>aegypt,</HI> which had revolted from the <HI>Persian,</HI>
at the Instigation of <HI>Inarus</HI> King of <HI>Lybia.</HI>
The <HI>Athenians,</HI> notwithstanding the late Trea∣ty,
had rigg'd out a good Fleet, the Design being
laid against <HI>Cyprus;</HI> which lying in the
Streights between <HI>Cilicia, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI>
would give them a great Command in those
<PB N="247" REF="280"/>
Parts, and be upon all Occasions a Curb to the
<HI>Persian. Inarus</HI> knowing of what Use they
would be to him, diverted them from this Enterprise,
by proposing to them a Share in his
Conquests, as of far greater Consequence to
them, than the Addition of a small Island.
Accordingly they went with two hundred Sail
to his Assistance; and were no sooner landed,
but they join'd Battel, routed the <HI>Persians,</HI> and
pursu'd them to <HI>Memphis,</HI> took two Parts of
the City, and block'd up the third, which
went by the Name of the <HI>White Wall. Artax∣erxes,</HI>
tho' he sent above three hundred thou∣sand
Men into the Field, was so hard press'd, that
he practis'd with the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> to invade
<HI>Attica,</HI> in hopes the <HI>Athenians</HI> would be re∣call'd
to its Defence. This was the first In∣stance of the <HI>Persians</HI> attempting to bribe one
Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> to act against the other: How∣ever
their Generosity, or their Fear sway'd so
much with them, as to reject his Proposals.
But the <HI>Persians</HI> coming next Year with a great
Reinforcement of Men, and Shipping, gave a
mighty Turn to their Affairs. The <HI>Athenians</HI>
had made several Attempts to storm the
<HI>White Wall:</HI> But upon the Approach of these
Forces they were oblig'd to raise the Siege,
and retire into <HI>Byblus</HI> a Town of <HI>Prosopis</HI> an
Island of the <HI>Nile,</HI> with their Fleet lying in
the River before the Town. Here they held
out a Siege of eighteen Months: After which
the <HI>Persians</HI> turning the Course of the River,
drain'd the Channel; and having by that means
taken their Gallies, put all the Men to the
Sword, except some few, who escap'd into <HI>Ly∣bia:</HI>
Tho' <HI>Diodorus says,</HI> that finding their
<PB N="248" REF="281"/>
Ships made useless by this Stratagem, they set
fire to 'em themselves, resolving to fight it out
to the last Man; and that the <HI>Persians</HI> seeing
their Obstinacy, let them go upon Terms,
'Tis certain, that being abandon'd by the <HI>Ae∣gyptians,</HI>
they were so weaken'd, that they
could not make head again. And to compleat
their Misfortunes, it happen'd that fifty Sail
being sent to their Relief, and knowing no∣thing
of their Defeat, fell in with the <HI>Phoeni∣cians</HI>
at <HI>Mendesium</HI> one of the Mouths of <HI>Nile,</HI>
and were most of them destroy'd.</P>
<P>Six Years the <HI>Athenians</HI> spent in this fruit∣less
Expedition; during which time their Fel∣low-Citizens
found Employment enough among
their Neighbours. Their Quarrel with
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> about <HI>Megara</HI> came to two
pitch'd Battels; wherein the <HI>Epidaurians</HI> assist∣ed
<HI>Corinth,</HI> and both Sides were Victorious in
their Turns. Soon after the War was renew'd
with the <HI>aeginetans,</HI> whose Reputation for Sea-Affairs
having been confirmed by their Service
against the <HI>Persian,</HI> they could ill bear the exces∣sive Growth of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Power. But they
were shamefully defeated with the Loss of seventy
Sail: After which <HI>Leocrates</HI> landed in
the Island, and block'd up the City. The <HI>Pe∣loponnesians</HI>
sent three hundred Men to its Relief:
And the <HI>Corinthians</HI> took this Opportunity,
Whilst the <HI>Athenian</HI> Forces were dividee
betwixt <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and <HI>aeina,</HI> to make Incur∣sions
into <HI>Megaris.</HI> But the <HI>Athenians</HI> march'd
out of the City to a Man against them unde
the Conduct of <HI>Myronides.</HI> In the first Batte
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> without reason pretended to
have the better: But upon their coming
<PB N="249" REF="282"/>
erect a Trophy, a second ensu'd, wherein they
were intirely defeated.</P>
<P>The next Quarrel of importance was between
the <HI>Phocians</HI> and <HI>Dorians;</HI> to the Assi∣stance
of which latter the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> as
being originally descended from them, sent an
Army of eleven thousand five hundred Men.
These Forces soon brought the <HI>Phocians</HI> to
Terms; but gave Occasion to a much sharper
Contest with the <HI>Athenians:</HI> Who perceiving
that they loiter'd about <HI>Boeotia</HI> for fear of be∣ing
intercepted in their Return, drain'd their
City again, and with their own, and their Con∣federate
Forces making up fourteen thousand
Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battel at</HI> Tanagra.</NOTE> met them about <HI>Tanagra</HI> a City not far
distant from <HI>Thebes.</HI> Here <HI>Cimon</HI> came in to
them; and tho' he was still under the Sentence of <HI>Ostracism,</HI> rang'd himself with those of his
own Tribe. But the <HI>Council of five hundred</HI>
not knowing what Designs he might have,
commanded the Officers not to receive him:
Whereupon he left the Army, conjuring <HI>Eu∣thippus,</HI>
and the rest of his Companions, who
lay under the same Suspicion of favouring the
Enemy, to behave themselves so, as to vindi∣cate
their good Intentions to their Country.
They follow'd his Advice; and being an hun∣dred
in Number made a separate Body; and,
the Battel being join'd, charg'd so desperately,
that they were all cut off, leaving to the <HI>A∣thenians</HI>
a double Regret, both for the Loss of
such brave Men, and for their having so unjust∣ly
suspected them. After a great Slaughter on
both Sides, the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> obtain'd the
Victory; which was occasion'd chiefly by the
Revolt of the <HI>Thessalian</HI> Horse to them in the
<PB N="250" REF="283"/>
heat of the Action. After which they harass'd
<HI>Megaris,</HI> and return'd home through the <HI>Isth∣mus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> in about two Months after
this Defeat,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Another at</HI> Oenophy∣ta.</NOTE> resolving to revenge themselves,
march'd again into <HI>Boeotia,</HI> and intirely routed
the Inhabitants, with those <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> For∣ces,
which were left about <HI>Tanagra.</HI> This Bat∣tel
was fought at a Place call'd <HI>Oenophyta.</HI> or
the <HI>Vineyards:</HI> And tho' the Manner and Or∣der
of it is no where describ'd, <HI>Diodorus</HI> makes
it as famous as any of Antiquity, in regard it
was fought against as stout and hardy of Peo∣ple
as any in <HI>Greece,</HI> and the Success of it was
owing purely to the <HI>Athenian</HI> Valour, without
the Assistance of their Confederates. After the
Fight they took <HI>Tanagra</HI> by Storm, and demo∣lish'd
it; over-run the greatest part of <HI>Boeotia,</HI>
as also of <HI>Phocis,</HI> and the <HI>Locri Opuntii;</HI> of
which latter they took an hundred Hostages,
and return'd to <HI>Athens;</HI> where <HI>Myronides</HI> their
General was receiv'd with great Acclamations,
for having accomplish'd so much in so short a
Compass of Time. And it was upon the good
Management, and Success of this Expedition,
that he has been rank'd with the greatest of
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Captains; tho' his Name and A∣ctions
being not so generally recorded, have
consequently made less Noise in the World.
The <HI>Athenians</HI> at this time finish'd their <HI>long
Walls,</HI> Which join'd the City to the Port, and
which they had begun after the last Defeat of
the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> And notwithstanding their
many Divis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, the Siege of <HI>aegina</HI> had been
carry'd on with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruption; and the Inha∣bitants
now yielding it up, had no other Terms
<PB N="251" REF="284"/>
given them, than to rase the Walls, deliver up
their Shipping, and pay their Tribute for the
future. The next who signaliz'd himself in
<HI>Athens,</HI> was <HI>Tolmides,</HI> who out of Emulation
to the Exploits of <HI>myronides,</HI> coasted <HI>Peloponne∣sus</HI>
with fifty Gallies, and four thousand Men
on board them, took <HI>Gytheum</HI> a Port-Town of
<HI>Laconia;</HI> where he burnt and destroy'd their
Naval Forces, and harass'd the Country. From
thence he made successful Inroads into the
<HI>Corinthian</HI> Territories, and defeated the <HI>Sicyoni∣ans</HI>
in a Land Fight.</P>
<P>These were the Transactions of the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
during the War in <HI>Aegypt:</HI> But about
the time of the Defeat there, a Stop was also
put to their Career in <HI>Greece.</HI> Particularly they
were foil'd in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> attempting to reinstate
<HI>Orestes,</HI> who being banish'd thence, had begg'd
their Assistance. After which <HI>Pericles</HI> put to
Sea, and took much the same Compass <HI>Tolmi∣des</HI>
did, but not altogether with the same Suc∣cess.
He harass'd the Cities upon the Sea∣Coasts,
gave the <HI>Sicyonians</HI> another Overthrow,
and taking in fresh Supplies at <HI>Achaia,</HI> which
was then in League with <HI>Athens,</HI> put over to
<HI>Acarnania;</HI> but was forc'd to return without
performing any thing of Importance. The
<HI>Athenians</HI> ever since the business of <HI>Tanagra,</HI>
suspected a Storm from <HI>Sparta:</HI> And as the E∣vent
of that Action had given them cause to
repent their ill Usage of <HI>Cimon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cimon <HI>re∣call'd.</HI></NOTE> they thought
it necessary to their Affairs at this Juncture, to
have him recall'd. Accordingly, when he had
been five Years in Exile, <HI>Pericles,</HI> who was
the chief Instrument in his Banishment, writ
the Edict for his Return. And being return'd,
<PB N="252" REF="285"/>
he made use of his Interest in <HI>Sparta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Procures a Peace be∣twixt</HI> A∣thens <HI>and</HI> Sparta.</NOTE> to recon∣cile
that State to <HI>Athens;</HI> which he so far ef∣fected,
that a Peace was concluded betwixt 'em
for five Years.</P>
<P>Peace being establish'd, he found the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
impatient of Ease: And least so many Ships
cruising about <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and the Isles, should
give fresh Occasion to intestine Wars, he pro∣pos'd
to make another Attempt upon <HI>Cyprus.</HI>
Tho' some say,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Expe∣dition to</HI> Cyprus.</NOTE> <HI>Pericles</HI> this a private Con∣dition
of his Return, that he should Command
the Forces abroad upon some Expedition against
the <HI>Persians,</HI> and leave him to govern in the
City. And it seems very probable, that some∣thing
of this Nature pass'd betwixt 'em,
because <HI>Pericles</HI> had constantly taken oc∣casion,
Whilst the other was abroad, to
reverse all that had been done by him in favour
of the Nobility. Whatever the Motive was,
he mann'd out two hundred Gallies, and being
arriv'd at <HI>Cyprus,</HI> detach'd sixty of them for
the Service in <HI>AElig;gypt.</HI> For tho' upon the last
Defeat there, <HI>Inarus</HI> was taken, and most of the
Country reduced, he fenny Parts of it still held
out under <HI>Apiyrtaus. Cimon</HI> in the mean while
over-run great Part of the Island <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and
laid Siege to <HI>Citium:</HI> But lying before the
Town, (Whether sick or wounded, is not de∣termind'd)
and perceiving he should die, he
charg'd those about him to conceal the News of
his Death;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Deat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI></NOTE> which thy manag'd with such Se∣crecy,
that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army was conducted, as
it were, by him thirty Days after he was dead.
And having obtained a great Victory, wherein
they took an hundred of the <HI>Phoenician, Cyprian,</HI>
and <HI>Clisian</HI> Vessels, and being join'd by the
<PB N="253" REF="286"/>
Ships, which return'd from <HI>aegypt,</HI> they sail'd
home. <HI>Diodorus</HI> insinuates, that it was upon
this Defeat that memorable Peace was concluded,
which is mention'd after the Fight at <HI>Eurymedon:</HI>
But as all Writers agree as to the main Articles,
tho' not as to the time, this might probably be
the same Treaty renew'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and Cha∣racter.</HI></NOTE> With <HI>Cimon</HI> in a
great Measure fell that true Spirit of Gallantry,
which had hitherto animated a Race of Heroes
against the common Enemy. And as he was the
last, so in one respect he was the greatest of
them; inasmuch as he struck a greater Ter∣ror
into the <HI>Persian,</HI> by carrying the War almost
into the Heart of his Country; and aw'd him
so in the <HI>Lesser Asia,</HI> that no Officer of what
Quality, or Character soever could command
there, nor durst any Soldier appear in Arms,
within four hundred Furlongs of the Sea. As
to his Behaviour at home, he was open, and ob∣liging,
and came very little short of <HI>Aristides</HI>'s
Integrity. For an Instance of this latter, he
gave an handsome turn to <HI>Raesaces</HI> a <HI>Persian;</HI>
who having fled from the King his Master, came
to him for Protection against the Insults of some
of the Mob in <HI>Athens,</HI> and offer'd him two
Cups full of <HI>Darius's: Cimon</HI> ask'd him smi∣lingly,
<HI>Whether he would have him to he his
Mercenary, or his Friend?</HI> He reply'd, <HI>His
Friend. Why then,</HI> says he, <HI>take away your
Mony: For as such, I presume it is at my Ser∣vice,
whenever I shall have occasion for it; and
when I have, I'll send to you.</HI> What Riches
he had got by the Wars, he employ'd to so
good Uses, that he was rather to be accounted
Charitable than Profuse, keeping an open House,
and laving down the Inclosures about it for the
<PB N="254" REF="287"/>
Benefit of the Poor; and that without any po∣pular
Design, further than by such good Offi∣ces
to restrain a Spirit of Faction, which he saw
was breaking in upon the Constitution.</P>
<P>Soon after these Transactions abroad, hap∣pen'd
a Quarrel about the Temple at <HI>Delphi,</HI>
from whence it was call'd the <HI>Holy War.</HI> The
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> taking it from the <HI>Phocians,</HI> who
had got Possession of it, gave it up to the Inha∣bitants:
But immediately upon their Depar∣ture,
<HI>Pericles</HI> came with a Body of <HI>Athenians,</HI>
and put the <HI>Phocians</HI> in again. And now the
<HI>Boeotians</HI> beginning to revolt, the <HI>Athenians</HI>
seiz'd several of their Towns, and garrison'd
them: But the <HI>Boeotians</HI> being join'd by their
Neighbours, surpris'd them in their Return, and
at <HI>Coronea</HI> cut off the greatest part of their
Forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battel at</HI> Coro∣nea.</NOTE> with <HI>Tolmides</HI> their General, and took
the rest Prisoners; to redeem whom, the <HI>Atheni∣ans</HI>
were forc'd to restore them to their Coun∣try,
and Liberty. As the Event of this Acti∣on
serv'd mightily to raise the Peoples Esteem
of <HI>Pericles,</HI> who had us'd his utmost Efforts to
dissuade <HI>Tolmides</HI> from it, as a rash Enterprise,
and ill-tim'd; so it encourag'd the <HI>Euboeans</HI> to
make head: And <HI>Pericles</HI> was no sooner landed
in the Island to chastise them, but News came,
that <HI>Megara</HI> had also revolted; and that the
<HI>Lacedoemonians</HI> were harassing the Borders of
<HI>Attica.</HI> Upon which he quitted this War,
to attend that which threaten'd home: Where
instead of putting it to the Issue of a Battel, he
practis'd with <HI>Plistoanax</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> King, and
by the means of <HI>Cleandrides</HI> (whom the <HI>Ephor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
had sent with him by reason of his Youth, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his Assistant) bought him off. <HI>Pericles</HI> in gi∣ving
<PB N="255" REF="288"/>
up his Accounts of this Expedition, had
set down a Disbursement of ten Talents, as
laid out upon a necessary Occasion; and the
People without troubling themselves to canvass
the Mystery, freely allow'd of it. It is added
further, that he had his yearly Penssioners in
<HI>Sparta;</HI> and constantly sent the same Sum for
the same secret Service: By which means the
War was kept off, 'till the <HI>Athenians</HI> were pro∣vided.
Tis said the <HI>Spartans</HI> fin'd their King
in such a Sum, that not being able to pay it,
he quitted his Country; and his Counsellor,
who had fled for it, was sentenc'd to Death.
However <HI>Attica</HI> being freed, <HI>Pericles</HI> repairs
again to <HI>Euboea;</HI> and having reduc'd the whole
Island, banish'd the Inhabitants of <HI>Hestioea,</HI> for
having kill'd the Men on board an <HI>Attick</HI> Ship
they had taken, and in their room brought in a
Colony of his own Citizens. All Parties being
rather tir'd than satisfy'd with this Variety of
Fortune, began to hearken to a Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A general Peace.</HI></NOTE> which
was at last concluded between <HI>Athens,</HI> and <HI>La∣cedoemon</HI>
for thirty Years, the Allies of both
Sides being included.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> So that the <HI>Athenians</HI>
were forc'd to evacuate most of the Towns they
had garrison'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3557.</NOTE> and it was further provided,
that whatever City had not yet declar'd, should
be at liberty to join with either Side, as Oc∣casion
should serve. At the same time <HI>Dio∣dorus</HI>
observes, there was a general Peace in all
Parts.</P>
<P>III. During this Interval,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 83. 2</NOTE> it may not be
improper to take a Survey of <HI>Athens;</HI> where
<HI>Pericles</HI> was still improving his Interest with the
People. But as they found <HI>Cimon</HI>'s Death had
<PB N="256" REF="289"/>
put him in a Capacity of carrying his Designs
further than they could allow of, they set up
<HI>Thucydides</HI> against him, a Man sober and discreet,
and related to <HI>Cimon.</HI> And tho' he was not so
profess'd a Soldier as he, he was better vers'd
in the Courts of Law, and Business of State,
and in that respect a more suitable Match for his
Competitor. He having sever'd out the best
sort of Men, who before pass'd undistinguish'd
among the Multitude, form'd them into a Bo∣dy,
which pass'd under the Name of <HI>The Few,</HI>
or the <HI>Great Ones,</HI> in Opposition to the <HI>Com∣mons.</HI>
And tho' this Distinction could not but
create some Disturbances, it serv'd how∣ever
as a Counter-poise to the State in ge∣neral,
which apprehended lets from the Contention
of two establish'd Parties, than from the
uncontroul'd Power of one Man. <HI>Pericles in</HI>
the mean while manag'd his Affairs with such
Nicety, that he temper'd all his Actions with
an Air of greater Advantage to the State, than
himself. Such was his sending sixty Gallies
yearly, with a proportionable Number of the
Citizens on board them, as a <HI>Nursery</HI> for Sea∣men.
Such was his planting another Part of
them in the late Conquests, and dividing the
Lands among them by Lot. As by these Me∣thods
he aw'd both the Enemies and Allies of
<HI>Athens,</HI> so he provided for the Necessitous,
and had a further End in discharging the City
of the Idle, and consequently the most busie
and inquisitive part of the People. Then to
cajole, and amuse those who were left, he en∣tertain'd
them with publick Shews, Feasts, and
other Solemnities. And to keep them general∣ly
employ'd, and make some shew of the vast
<PB N="257" REF="290"/>
Sums he expended in these Projects, he set to
beautifying the City far beyond what his Pre∣decessors
had attempted. He gave such En∣couragement,
as produc'd strange sort of E∣mulation
in all kinds of Artists: So that <HI>Athens</HI>
on a sudden became <HI>one continu'd Ornament.</HI>
As a Specimen of the rest, he restor'd and en∣larg'd
the <HI>Parthenion,</HI> or Temple of <HI>Minerva</HI>
burnt by the <HI>Persians;</HI> which is said to be even
at this Day both for Matter and Art, the most
beautiful Piece of Antiquity remaining in the
World. It was from this time, that <HI>Athens</HI>
came to be so much admir'd by Strangers, and
envy'd by her Neighbours: And this Politeness,
Pomp, and Luxury in Building, seems to have
laid the Foundation of the same Excess, to
which she soon after arriv'd in other things.
But <HI>Pericles</HI> by this gave occasion to his Ene∣mies,
to reproach him with squandering away
the Mony, which was given for the Mainte∣nance
of the War. They complain'd in the po∣pular
Assemblies, <HI>That it was what they could
not answer either to themselves, or their Allies;
that they had no Pretence for moving the Bank of
Greece from Delos, but to secure it from the
Barbarians; and that he had broke the Neck of
that Excuse, by diverting it to other Uses. Pe∣ricles</HI>
urg'd in Defence of himself, and the
State, <HI>That they were no way accountable to their
Confederates, who did not so much as set out Ship,
Man, or Horse for the Service, whilst they were
continually exposing themselves in their Defence:
That as for the Mony, it was not theirs who
gave, but theirs who receiv'd it, so long as they
perform'd the Conditions, upon which they receiv'd.</HI>
He added surther, <HI>That it was sit the Handi∣craftsmen
<PB N="258" REF="291"/>
should have their Share in the pub∣lick,
Mony, and yet that they should do some∣thing
for it; and that since they were sufficienty
stor'd with Provisions for the War, they might
very fairly convert the Overplus to the Ʋse, and
Ornament of the City.</HI> This salved the Business
for the present: And when at another time
<HI>Thucydides</HI>'s Party was railing at him upon the
same Account, he put the Question to the Peo∣ple,
<HI>Whether they thought he had laid out too
much?</HI> They told him, <HI>Yes. Well then,</HI> says
he, <HI>let it all go upon my Account, and accord∣ingly
I'll make the Inscriptions upon the Temples,
and other publick Buildings, in my own Name.</HI>
Whether they were struck with the Greatness of
his Spirit in this Reply, or that they envy'd him
the Glory of the Works, they unanimously
bid him go on, and finish 'em at the publick
Charge.</P>
<P>The first new Disturbance happen'd six Years
after the Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Sami∣an <HI>Expedi∣tion.</HI></NOTE> between the <HI>Samians,</HI> and <HI>Mi∣lsians,</HI>
about <HI>Priene</HI> a City of <HI>Ionia:</HI> Wherein
the latter being worsted, apply'd themselves to
the <HI>Athenians;</HI> who accordingly interested
themselves in the Quarrel, being also encourag'd
to it by a disgusted Party of the <HI>Samians</HI> them∣selves.
<HI>Pericles</HI> appear'd so particularly warm in
it, that the State took notice of it; and the ra∣ther
because what he did, was thought to be
at the Instigation of <HI>Aspasia</HI> a <HI>Milesian</HI>
Mistress of his. He mann'd out forty Gallies, and made
a Descent upon <HI>Samos;</HI> where breaking up the
<HI>Oligarehy,</HI> he establish'd a <HI>Democracy</HI> after the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Model; then taking Hostages, tran∣sported
them to <HI>Lemnos,</HI> and leaving a Garrison
in <HI>Samos,</HI> return'd home. In the Mean while se∣veral
<PB N="259" REF="292"/>
of the Citizens, who had fled to the Contin∣ent
upon the Change of their Government,
betook themselves to <HI>Pissthnes</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> Go∣vernor
of <HI>Sardis,</HI> and at the same time holding
Correspondence with some of the leading Men
in <HI>Samos,</HI> enter'd it by Night with seven hun∣dred
Auxiliaries: Where they put all to the
Sword, who oppos'd them; and having got
their Hostages privately convey'd from <HI>Lemnos,</HI>
deliver'd up the <HI>Athenian</HI> Garrison to <HI>Pissuthnes;</HI>
then drew <HI>Byzantium</HI> into their Alliance, and
renew'd the War with the <HI>Milesians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pericles</HI> having Notice of this Surprise, put
to Sea again with sixty Sail: With forty four
of them he fell in with the Enemy, and ob∣tain'd
a signal Victory, having taken, sunk, and
routed the whole <HI>Samian</HI> Elect consisting of seventy
Sail, twenty of which were Men of War.
Having by this Means made himself Master of
the Port, he pursu'd his Victory by Land,
and block'd, up the City. But instead of pres∣sing
the Siege, he went with a fresh Supply of
Ships in quest of the <HI>Phaenician</HI> Fleet, which
he heard was coming to the Relief of the be∣sieg'd;
who in the mean time finding great De∣tachments
drawn off; made a successful Saily,
and recover'd the Harbour; so that having an
open Sea, they imported all their necessary Pro∣visions.
But <HI>Pericles</HI> being return'd with still
greater Supplies from home, which were also
augmented by a Fleet of <HI>Chians and Lesbi∣ans,</HI>
he hemm'd them in with a Wall, and
made use of battering Engines: So that with
small Loss he carry'd the Town in the ninth
Month of the Siege,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Samos re∣duc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI></NOTE> obliging them <HI>To demolish
<PB N="260" REF="293"/>
their Walls, deliver up their Shipping, pay a good
Fine towards the Charge of the War, and give
Hostages for Security.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> This happen'd about the
beginning of the.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3564.</NOTE> eighty fifth <HI>Olympiad;</HI> from
which time 'till the twentieth Year of the <HI>Pelo∣ponnesian</HI>
War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 85. 1</NOTE> <HI>Samos</HI> continu'd in Alliance with
<HI>Athens,</HI> and under the popular Government.
The War being over, <HI>Byzantium</HI> also return'd
to its sormer Obedience. This was the chief
of <HI>Pericles's</HI> military Exploits; and he could
not help valuing himself upon it so far, as to
say, <HI>He had in nine Months done as much a∣gainst
the chief City of</HI> Ionia, <HI>as</HI> Agamemnon
<HI>did in ten Years against</HI> Troy. The truth is,
he met with more Hazard and Difficulty, than
he was aware of, the <HI>Samians</HI> being arriv'd to
that Power by Sea, that they were within ve∣ry
little of wresting the Dominion of it out of
the <HI>Athenians</HI> Hands.</P>
<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Stirs at</HI> E∣pidamnus.</NOTE> The next Commotions were about two
Years after at <HI>Epidamnus,</HI> and require a distinct
Relation, as they give light to the Sequel of
the Story, and are the common reputed Grounds
of that Flame, which was kindled in all <HI>Greece.
Epidamnus,</HI> afterwards known by the Name of
<HI>Dyrrachium,</HI> was a Colony of the <HI>Corcyaeans;</HI>
which growing first Rich, and then Factious,
banish'd the chief of her Citizens. The Exiles
joining with the <HI>Illyrians</HI> their Neighbours,
brought the <HI>Epidamnians</HI> so low, that they
were forc'd to send to <HI>Corcyra</HI> their Mother
City for Assistance; which rejecting their Re∣quest,
the Oracle directed them to the <HI>Corin∣thians,
as their Original Founders.</HI> For as <HI>Cor∣cyra</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="294"/>
was their Founder, so <HI>Corinth</HI> was the <HI>Cor∣cyraeans;</HI>
and <HI>Phalius</HI> the Posterity of <HI>Her∣cules,</HI>
who led the Colony into <HI>Epidamnus,</HI>
was himself a <HI>Corinthian,</HI> and carry'd several of
his Countrymen with him. Accordingly up∣on
their giving up themselves, and their City
to them, they took them under their Protecti∣on,
but not more out of Pity to them, than
out of a Pique to <HI>Corcyra;</HI> whole Wealth, and
Naval Power, wherein she was little inferior
to any State in <HI>Greece,</HI> had made her insolent,
so as to throw off all manner of Dependance on
them, even to the common Marks of Acknow∣ledgement,
exacted as due from a Colony to its
<HI>Metropolis.</HI> The <HI>Corinthians</HI> having sent some
new Inhabitants to <HI>Epidamnus</HI> with a Garrison
to secure them, the <HI>Corcyroeans</HI> resented it as
interposing in their Affairs; and going with a
Fleet to <HI>Epidamnus,</HI> commanded the Citizens
to receive their Exiles, and expel the <HI>Corin∣thians;</HI>
and upon their positive Refusal block'd
them up. In the mean time, when they sound
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> preparing to relieve them, they
offer'd to refer it to any indifferent City of <HI>Pe∣loponnesus,</HI>
as to the Right of the Colony. But
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> resolving to humble them,
sent a Fleet of seventy five Gallies with two
thousand Soldiers on board them. The <HI>Cor∣cyroeans</HI>
had an hundred and twenty Sail; forty
of which being left to carry on the Siege,
they made up to them with the rest near the
Promontory of <HI>Actium,</HI> and defeated them:
And to make it a compleat Victory, <HI>Epi∣damnus</HI>
was surrender'd up to 'em the same Day.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="295"/>
Being now Masters of those Seas, they infe∣sted
the other Colonies, and Confederates of
<HI>Corinth.</HI> But the Summer following, the <HI>Co∣rinthians</HI>
made very great Preparations in order
to revenge this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Which the others
having Notice of, laid their Case before the
<HI>Athenians,</HI> insisting upon the Article of their
late Treaty with the <HI>Peloponnesians,</HI> which gave
them leave to take any State, that had not been
engag'd, into their Alliance. The <HI>Corinthians</HI>
at the same time put in their Remonstrances:
And after a full hearing on both, Sides, and
two Assemblies of the People, they concluded
<HI>Coreyra</HI> was a Place of too great Importance, in
regard both of its own Strength, and as it was
a convenient Pass into <HI>Italy,</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> to let it
be an Accession to <HI>Corinth.</HI> Yet as on the o∣ther
Hand they were tender of violating the
Peace, they made only a Defensive League
with it, giving their Officers in Charge to de∣cline
the Fight, unless the <HI>Corcyoeans</HI> or they
were first attack'd. Accordingly they voted
an Aid of ten Gal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies: But the sending so small
a Sq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adron was look'd upon rather as an Hard∣ship
upon <HI>Lacedaemonius</HI> the Son of <HI>Cimon,</HI>
who commanded them, than a Relief to <HI>Corcyra;</HI>
and as it stuck chiefly upon <HI>Pericles,</HI> who did
all he could to hinder the Rise of <HI>Cimon's</HI> Fa∣mily,
he was forc'd to procure a new Supply;
but it came too late to do much Service.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Eight between the Corcy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae∣ans, and Corinthi∣ans.</HI></NOTE> The
<HI>Corinthians</HI> putting to Sea with ninety Ships of
their own, and sixty of their Allies, the <HI>Cor∣cyroeans</HI>
met 'em betwixt their Island and the
Continent of <HI>Epirus</HI> with a hundred and twen∣ty
of their own, and the <HI>Athenians.</HI> As this
was their greaten Number, that had hitherto
<PB N="263" REF="296"/>
been engag'd of the <HI>Grecians</HI> among themselves,
so the Fight was long and obstinate, but artless,
and confus'd, and rather desperate, than deci∣sive.
For tho' the <HI>Corcyraeans</HI> lost seventy Sail
for thirty of the Enemy, and a hundred Priso∣ners;
yet as upon the Arrival of twenty Sail
more from <HI>Athens,</HI> they kept the Sea, recover'd
a great part of their Wreck, and dead Bodies,
and made another Offer of Battel, which was
not accepted, this made the Claim of Victory
so equal, that both Sides erected Trophies.
Whatever Advantage the <HI>Corinthians</HI> had, they
did not care to parsue it; so that being content
to leave <HI>Corcyra,</HI> rather sase than victorious,
they return'd home, having in their Passage
taken <HI>Anactorium</HI> a Town in the Bay of <HI>Am∣bracia.</HI>
But they complain'd loudly of the <HI>A∣thenians,</HI>
as having violated the Treaty, in
which taey were compris'd with <HI>Lacedoemon:</HI>
And this was the first Pretence of the general
War which follow'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first Grounds of the</HI> Pelo∣ponnesian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> What they call'd the
breaking of the Peace, the <HI>Athenians</HI> term'd
only assistng their Confederates: But they did
not depend much upon the Nicety of this Di∣stinction;
and finding it must come to an open
Rupture, thought it the wifest it Course to be
before-hand with them.</P>
<P>Accordingly they sent to the Inhabitants of
<HI>Potidaea,</HI> a Town in the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Pallene</HI> a
<HI>Corinthian</HI> Colony, but tributary to <HI>Athens,</HI> to
demolish their Walls towards <HI>Pallene,</HI> to give
Hostages, to expel their Magistrates sent year∣ly
to them from <HI>Corinth,</HI> and to receive no
more of them for the future. They had first
Recourse to Entreaties, that nothing of Extre∣mity
might be put upon them; but when they
<PB N="264" REF="297"/>
could get no Abatement of these Terms, they
went with the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Ambassadors to <HI>Spar∣ta,</HI>
and obtain'd an Assurance that in Case the
<HI>Athenians</HI> made War upon them, the <HI>Lacedae∣monians</HI>
would enter <HI>Attica</HI> with an Army.
They had further Encouragement from <HI>Per∣diccas</HI>
the <HI>Macedonian</HI> King, who having at
that time a Quarrel with the <HI>Athenians</HI> for Assisting
his Brothers against him, procur'd seve∣ral
neighbouring Places of <HI>Thrace</HI> and <HI>Macedon,</HI>
to join with them in a general Revolt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Potidaea, <HI>and other Places re∣volt.</HI></NOTE> Be∣sides
these home Alliances, they had two thou∣sand
Men sent 'em from <HI>Corinth</HI> under <HI>Ari∣staeus.</HI>
However the <HI>Athenians</HI> went on with
their Designs, having before sent Orders to the
Captains of the thirty Gallies they had in those
Parts, to see their Commands executed upon
<HI>Potidaea,</HI> and to have a watchful Eye upon its
Neighbours. But being too weak to deal with
<HI>Perdiccas,</HI> and the revolted Cities at the same
time, they receiv'd a Supply of forty Gallies
with two thousand Men under the Conduct of
<HI>Callias.</HI> The Forces on both Sides being join'd,
a Batted ensu'd, wherein one of the <HI>Athenian</HI>
Wings was worsted by the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> but in
other Parts they rout<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Perdiccas;</HI> which <HI>Ari∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI>
the <HI>Corinthian</HI> General perceiving, gave
over the Pursoit, and braking through the
Ranks, threw himself into <HI>Potidaea.</HI> The <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
in this Action lost but a hundred and
fifty Men, amongst whom was <HI>Callias,</HI> and the
Enemy searce double that Number. However
it was a Victory on the <HI>Athenians</HI> Side; who
having soon after receiv'd a fresh Supply of
sixteen hundred Men under the Command of
<HI>Phormio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Polidaea <HI>besieg'd.</HI></NOTE> block'd up <HI>Potidaea</HI> by Sea and Land.
<PB N="265" REF="298"/>
As the Business of <HI>Corcyra</HI> was urg'd against
the <HI>Athenians,</HI> so was this of <HI>Potidaea</HI> against
the <HI>Peloponnesians;</HI> and may be look'd upon as
the second Pretence for the War, inasmuch as
they had incited that and other Towns to re∣nounce
their Allegiance to <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>The Noise of this Siege brought the <HI>Corin∣thian</HI>
Ambassadors to <HI>Sparta;</HI> where they and
all other States, which had any Injustice to
charge the <HI>Athenians</HI> with, had free Liberty of
declaring their Grievances. <HI>Aegina</HI> complain'd
of being oppress'd contrary to the Liberty allow'd
by her last Agreement with <HI>Athens; Megara</HI>
of being prohibited the Freedom of the <HI>Athe∣nian</HI>
Ports, and Markets. And when enough
had been said to prepare the <HI>Lacedoemonians,</HI>
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> made a long Speech to them;
wherein taking the Justice of their Resentment
for granted, they endeavour'd chiefly to rouze
them into a Sense of the common Danger of
<HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> so far as to charge them with be∣ing
selfish, and supine, and not acting up to
the Reputation, they had formerly acquir'd;
and that in short, <HI>If they would not take this
Opportunity of uindicating themselves, and their
Allies, they msst be forc'd to have recourse to
those that would.</HI> Some <HI>Athenian</HI> Ambassadors,
who were then at <HI>Sparta</HI> upon other Business,
desir'd they might have leave to exceed their
Commission so far, as to refute what Envy and
Prejudice had suggested against their Fellow¦Citizens.
They began with a Recapitulation
of the <HI>Persian</HI> Wars; wherein the whole Bur∣den
in a manner lying upon them, both as to
defeating the Enemy, and protecting their Al∣lies,
they shew'd by what necessary and al∣most
<PB N="266" REF="299"/>
unavoidable Steps the chief Power was
devolv'd upon them; <HI>That having receivd that
Power as the Reward of their Virtue, they thought
themselves oblig'd to maintain it; that this was
not to he done without some proportionable Force,
and yet that they had employ'd no more, than was
absolutely necessary in suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cases.</HI> They desir'd
the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> not to entertain any unjust
Suspicions of them; and to be very well ad∣vis'd
before they enter'd upon a War of the last
Importance; for that <HI>Whoever should begin with
the</HI> Athenians, <HI>would certainly find them ready to
retaliate.</HI> The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> after a full and
open Hearing came to a close Debate among
themselves; wherein it was generally agreed,
that the Peace was broke, and that the <HI>Athe∣nian</HI>
were the Agressors; The Dispute was,
whether they should immediately declare War.
<HI>Archidamus</HI> one of their Kings, and a Man of
Prudence, and Temper, told 'em, <HI>They were
not at this time a Match for</HI> Athens; and en∣deavour'd
to dissuade them not to much from
the War in general, as from rushing into it
thoughtless, and unprovided. But <HI>Sthenelaidas</HI>
one of the <HI>Ephori</HI> urg'd the contrary, <HI>That
when once they had receiv'd an Injury, they
ought not to deliberate, but forthwith to proceed to
Action,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>War de∣creed at</HI> Sparta</NOTE> <HI>and revenge it.</HI> And accordingly War
was decreed, and the Consederates made ac∣quainted
with their Resolution.</P>
<P>Whilst they were making Preparations,
wherein they spent almost a Year, the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI>
to make the War appear more speci∣ous
on their Side, sent several Embassies to
expostulate with the <HI>Athenians.</HI> They began
with the old Business of <HI>Cylon;</HI> which was le∣vell'd
<PB N="267" REF="300"/>
against <HI>Pericles</HI> their Mortal Enemy,
whose Relations by his Mother's Side were
said to be tainted with that Pollution. But
he charg'd them with the same Guilt in the
Death of <HI>Pausanias,</HI> and some of their <HI>Helots,</HI>
who had taken Sanctuary in the Temple. Then
they requir'd them to raise the Siege of <HI>Poti∣daea;</HI>
to permit <HI>Aegina</HI> to be govern'd by its
own Laws; and to revoke the Decree against
the <HI>Megareans;</HI> and insisted so much upon
this latter, that they seem'd to lay the whole
Stress of the War upon it. Receiving no sa∣tisfactory
Answer to these Proposals, they
made another more general Demand, <HI>That they
should set free all the</HI> Grecian <HI>Cities, which
had any Dependence on them.</HI> Which as it
was in effect confining their Jurisdiction with∣in
their own Walls, they could not expect they
would consent to it: However it answer'd
their Design, which was only to amuse them,
and gain time. The <HI>Athenians</HI> upon this last
Message assembled the People, in order to send
a peremptory Answer once for all. The Mat∣ter
was canvass'd long, and with great variety
of Opinions; 'till at last it was fix'd by <HI>Peri∣cles,</HI>
who oppos'd their Demands with a great
deal of Warmth, and Artifice, shewing, <HI>That
tho' same of them were not in themselves suffici∣ent
Grounds for a War, yet that the Consequence
of their Concession even in Trifles, when it was
extorted from them with an Air of Command,
would be, to have still more impos'd upon them:
That as to the Success. they might promise them∣selves
a considerable share from the many diffe∣rent
Interests of the Consederates, whereby their
Counsels being divided, they would never come
<PB N="298" REF="301"/>
to any sudden Resolve; and that if they could, yet
their want of Mony would keep 'em from putting
it in Execution. That as to themselves, their
Shipping would enable them to give powerful Di∣versions,
by making frequent Descents: And be∣cause
their Strength consisted chiefly in Islands,
having only</HI> Attica, <HI>that lay open to the Depreda∣tions
of the Enemy, they could not sustain so
great Losses by Land.</HI> He concluded with <HI>The
absolute Necessity there was of a War; and that
the more chearfully they undertook it, the easier
it would be dispatch'd: That as the greatest Ho∣nours
had generally accru'd to their State out of
the greatest Extremities, this might serve to
animate them in its Defence, so as not to trans∣mit
it less glorious to their Posterity, than they
receiv'd it from their Ancestors.</HI> These Rea∣sons
were readily assented to by the People;
who to give some Colour to their Proceedings,
sent a very plausible Answer drawn up by <HI>Pericles</HI>
to this Effect, <HI>That they would open their Ports
and Markets to the</HI> Megareans, <HI>if the</HI> Lacedae∣monians
<HI>would allow the</HI> Athenians, <HI>and their
Allies residing in</HI> Sparta, the <HI>Privileges of their
own Subjects: That they would restore the Cities
to the same degrees of Liberty, they enjoy'd when
the League was made, provided also, that they
would do the like to the Cities under their Ju∣risdiction,
and not oblige them to conform to the
Model of their Government;</HI> and lastly, <HI>That
they desir'd to adjust these Differences by Treaty,
as being unwilling to begin a War,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The more immediate Causes of the</HI> Polo∣ponneasan <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> <HI>but resolv'd
to defend themselves against those that did.</HI></P>
<P>Having mention'd the pretended Grounds of
the Quarrel, with the formal Proceedings on
both Sides, it miy not be amiss to observe, that
<PB N="269" REF="302"/>
<HI>Pericles</HI> was personally interested in promoting
this War, insomuch that some have charg'd him as
the sole Author of it. 'Tis certain, he was
vastly indebted to the State, which had often
threaten'd calling him to Account: So that not∣withstanding
his great Power in the City, he
thought it too precarious, to screen him a∣gainst
the continual Clamours about the publick
Mony. This private Storm he thought was not
to be diverted, but by a publick one; and there∣fore
to take the People off from their Enquiries,
and to make his Assistance necessary, he invol∣ved
them in this War. It is said further, that
he took the first Hint of it from his Nephew
<HI>Alcibiades;</HI> who seeing him one Day very pen∣sive
and melancholy, ask'd him the reason of it.
He told him, <HI>He was considering how to make
up his Accounts to the State. You were better
consider,</HI> replies the Youth, <HI>how to avoid being
accountable.</HI> This was undoubtedly a strong
Motive with <HI>Pericles</HI> in inflaming the Quarrel,
when once it was on foot: But for the War it
self, it was what must have broke out of Course
about this time, without any particular Incendi∣ary.
For the true Cause of it was the Power
of <HI>Athens;</HI> and the Seeds of it were laid from
the time of the Battel at <HI>Plataea.</HI> That Day so
glorious to <HI>Greece,</HI> became fatal to her in the
Consequence, by dissolving that Subordination
<HI>Athens</HI> bore to <HI>Sparta,</HI> and raising eternal Jea∣lousies
betwixt the two States. <HI>Athens</HI> fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d
with the Success of the Battels against the <HI>Per∣sian,</HI>
the chief Honour of which she took to
her self, first stood upon Equality with <HI>Lace∣daemon,</HI>
and then carry'd her Pretensions a
great deal higher. She soon affected a Pre∣cedency;
<PB N="270" REF="303"/>
drew over to her Side the greatest
part of the Allies; debated, and decided what∣ever
concern'd the general Welfare; assum'd to
her self the Prerogative of Rewards and Pu∣nishments;
and in a word, set up for the <HI>Sove∣reign
Ʋmpire of</HI> Greece. The <HI>Athenians</HI> had
indeed a very fair Title to the Command at
Sea; and <HI>Sparta</HI> was not very unwilling to re∣sign
it to them: But they would be absolute
in all. They thought, since they had deliver'd
<HI>Greece</HI> from the Insults of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> they
had a Right to oppress her in their Turn. They
roughly treated the <HI>Grecian Cities,</HI> of which
they call'd themselves the <HI>Protectors.</HI> If a
Neighbour offended them never so little, he
soon felt the Weight of all their Anger; whence
grew that Proverb recited by <HI>Aristotle, An</HI>
Athenian <HI>Neighbourhood.</HI> They render'd them∣selves
odious not only to their Neighbours, but
also to part of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and the Isles of the
<HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, which were subject to their Laws,
but impatiently bore that Yoke, which grew
every Day more insupportable. Thus did
<HI>Athens</HI> manage her self for above forty Years:
All which time the <HI>Spartans</HI> made but faint At∣tempts
to humble, or repress their Rivals.
Their Method, when any injur'd State appeal'd
to them, was to referem to <HI>Athens,</HI> that by
engaging her in the Quarrel, they might weak∣en,
and dissolve her Power, and yet not at their
own Expence. But the Effect was so far from
answering what they propos'd, that it serv'd
rather to fix and heighten her Esteem. <HI>Pericles</HI>
made the City still more formidable to the other
Common-wealths, by the several Embassies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
caus'd it to depute, either upon its real <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣tended
<PB N="271" REF="304"/>
Interests; and improv'd these Negotia∣tions
into a great Design of summoning all
<HI>Greece</HI> to <HI>Athens,</HI> in order to enter into a more
strict Consederacy against the <HI>Persian.</HI> Which
was such a distinguishing Mark of Pre-eminence,
as the <HI>Athenians</HI> had never before assum'd to
themselves: And the <HI>Lacedam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nians</HI> could not
but resent it, when they found they were to
be conven'd before them, like the rest of their
Tributaries. Whatever they had hitherto con∣niv'd
at, they did not care to testifie their
Submission, and Dependance in so solemn a Man∣ner:
And tho' the thing did not take Effect,
it serv'd however to awaken them into a Sense
of the Necessity there was, of putting a Stop to
their Career. So that upon this, and the re∣peated
Complaints of several Cities, they found
there was no way left, but to make a formal De∣claration
of War. In a word the two States
were throughly exasperated by a long Emulation;
and as they were both arriv'd to their most flou∣rishing
Period, this was a Dispute betwixt 'em
for the <HI>Empire of Greece,</HI> the Pretence for
for which was, <HI>preserving the Ballance, and pro∣tecting
their Confederates.</HI></P>
<P>About the time of these Commotions, flou∣rish'd
<HI>Meton</HI> the <HI>Astronomer</HI> of <HI>Athens;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meton.</NOTE> who
found out that notable Period of nineteen Years,
in which Space all the different Mutations of
the Sun and Moon are compleated, and they
begin again to move from the same Point of
the <HI>Zodiack.</HI> This became a Standard among
the Ancients in calculating the Full and New
Moons; and the Discovery was receiv'd with
such Applause by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that they
would have it writ in <HI>Golden Letters</HI> in the most
<PB N="272" REF="305"/>
publick Place of the City. From hence came
the Title of the <HI>Golden Number;</HI> which was
handed down from the <HI>Grecians</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI>
and from them to us <HI>Christians.</HI> But some
will not allow <HI>Meton</HI> to have been the Author
of this <HI>Cycle: Livy</HI> particularly attributes the
Invention of it to <HI>Numa Pompilius.</HI> It was al∣so
about this time that <HI>Pindar</HI> dy'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pindar.</NOTE> who was
born at <HI>Thebes</HI> about the sixty fourth <HI>Olympiad.</HI>
The manner of his Death is related, that ha∣ving
pray'd to the Gods to give him the most
desirable thing in Life, he dy'd suddenly, l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an∣ing
his Head upon a Boy that he lov'd. His
Writings have given us a Standard of the great∣est
Elevation and Transport, to which it is
possible for Poetry to be advanc'd. There is
something so vast in his Designs, so strong,
and lively in his Thoughts, and so pompous
and daring in his Expressions, and Measures,
that it requires scarce less Attention to read
him, than to imitate others. For which Rea∣sons
his Muse has been censur'd as too unbrid∣led
and irregular. But the Design of an <HI>Ode</HI>
being not so much to inform our Judgment, as
to raise our Fancy, this <HI>Irregularity</HI> is not the
least of his <HI>Beauties.</HI> It is agreeable to the Rap∣ture
the Poet feels; his Spirits are too much in
a Ferment, and his Fancy too much upon the
Wing, to stay for Words to express himself
Methodically. It is the boldest sort of Paint∣ing;
he gives a masterly Touch here and there,
and takes the Likeness of his <HI>Hero</HI> in general,
tho' he does not finish the Features. Thus
it is, that he has triumph'd over Art so success∣fully,
as to gain the Title of a perfect <HI>Master
of the Sublime,</HI> and <HI>Prince of the</HI> Lyrick <HI>Poets.</HI>

Sword. The <HI>Athenians</HI> sent a Party to the Re∣lief
of the Town; which being recover'd be∣fore
<PB N="274" REF="308"/>
they came, they were left in it as a Garri∣son.
This Action happen'd in the fifteenth
Year of the Peace, being the first of the eighty
seventh <HI>Olympiad,</HI> and the 3572 Year of the World.</P>
<P>Thus the League being manifestly dissolv'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Alli∣ances on both Sides.</HI></NOTE>
both Sides employ'd their utmost Diligence in
strengthning their Alliances. The <HI>Lacedaemo∣nians</HI>
secur'd all <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> except the <HI>Argives</HI>
and <HI>Achaeans</HI> who stood Neuter; tho' amongst
these latter, <HI>Pellene</HI> declar'd for them in the Be∣ginning,
and the rest came in afterwards. They
had also without the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> the <HI>Megareans,
Phocians, Locrians, Boeotians, Ambraciots, Leu∣cadians,</HI>
and <HI>Anactorians:</HI> All which were al∣lottedtheir several Proportion, some of Horse,
others of Foot, and the rest of Shipping, of
which they propos'd to have five hundred Sail,
besides what they could procure out of <HI>Italy,</HI>
and <HI>Sicily.</HI> On the <HI>Athenians</HI> side were the
<HI>Chians, Lesbians, Plataeans, Messenians</HI> inhabi∣ting
<HI>Naupactus,</HI> most of the <HI>Acarnanians,</HI> with
the <HI>Corcyraeans,</HI> and <HI>Zacynthians,</HI> besides great
Part of the <HI>Asiatick Grecians,</HI> particularly those
on the Sea-Coast, several Towns of <HI>Thrace,</HI> with
most of the lesser Islands, and tributary Cities
in general. Of these <HI>Chios, Lesbos,</HI> and <HI>Corcyra</HI>
furnish'd Shipping, the rest Men, and Mony.
So e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger were both Sides in the Prosecution of
the War, that they had Recourse to the <HI>Bar∣barians</HI>
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Assistance against each other, and
sent severally as Suppliants to the King of <HI>Persia,</HI>
against whom they were so lately united. Thus
was all <HI>Greece</HI> in a manner drawn into the Quar∣rel,
and divided as the States were differently
affected: Of which the greatest Part embrac'd
<PB N="275" REF="309"/>
the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> Interest, as the Cause of Ju∣stice,
and Liberty; the rest being detain'd by
the <HI>Athenians</HI> more out of Fear, than Affecti∣on.
But whatever the latter wanted in Num∣bers,
was sufficiently made up to them in Mo∣ny,
Shipping, and all necessary Provisions, and
in the absolute Power, they had over their Con∣federates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> after the Business of <HI>Pla∣taea.</HI>
publish'd their Intentions of invading At∣tica;
in order to which two Thirds of the
Confederate Cities, making up sixty thousand
Men, met at the <HI>Isthmus:</HI> Where <HI>Archida∣mus,</HI>
as General of the Expedition, told them,
<HI>The Eyes and Hearts of all</HI> Greece <HI>were upon
them; that whatever they might reasonably pro∣mise
themselves from their Numbers, they ought
not only to allow Room for Accidents, but to
consider further how powerful, and desperate an
Enemy they had to deal with; That tho' it was
generally a Maxim to push on boldly in an Ene∣mies
Country; yet they should proceed here
with more than ordinary Caution, and guard e∣very
one his respective Post.</HI> Thus having pre∣par'd
his Men, he sent once more to the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI>
to see if they would abate any thing of
their former Obstinacy. But they resov'd not
to treat with the Enemy in this threatning
Posture: So that the Messenger was dismiss'd
without hearing, and said at his Departure,
<HI>From this Day may</HI> Greece <HI>date her Miseries▪
Pericles</HI> had a Notion, that <HI>Archidamus</HI> out of
Respect to him (as indeed there was something
of a Friendship founded upon the Right of
Hospitality betwixt them) would spare his
Lands, in the general Havock he would make
<PB N="276" REF="310"/>
of every thing else in the Country; and think∣ing
it would rather do him an Injury, in lay∣ing
him open to the Suspicion and Ill-will of
his Fellow-Citizens, he declar'd to them, <HI>That
if the Enemy forbore his Estate, he would give
it to the Publick.</HI> He also order'd those who who
were dispers'd in the Villages, to retire
with their Effects into the City, as the only
Place of Security; and encourag'd them by a
long Detail of their Provisions; as <HI>That they
had six hundred Talents yearly Tribute, besides
other Revenues; that they had yet left in the Ca∣stle
six thousand Talents, besides great Quanti∣ties
of Mony and Plate belonging to the Temples,
which they might use in Cases of Extremity,
provided they made Restitution when the War was
over: That they had between thirty and forty
Thousand Men, three hundred Gallies, and other
Necessaries, which if rightly apply'd, would casily
make them Superior.</HI> The People were so well
satisfy'd with this Account of their Affairs
that they immediately set to rigging out their
Fleet, and summoning the Confederates.</P>
<P>But whilst they were making these necessary
Preparations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 87. 2 <HI>The</HI> Pelo∣ponnesians <HI>invade</HI> At∣tica</NOTE> the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> Army enter'd
<HI>Attica</HI> by <HI>Oenoe</HI> the first Frontier Garrison to∣wards
<HI>Boeotia;</HI> from whence <HI>Archidamus,</HI> after
a fruitless Attempt to Storm the Place, was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orc'd to march further into the Country. For
he was charg'd with having been too remiss
from the Beginning; and particularly that by
this last Delay, he had given the People of
<HI>Attica</HI> Time to gather themselves into a Body,
who otherwise must have sell into their Hands.
So that whether he was a Favourer of the <HI>A∣thenians</HI>
or no, it was not doubted, but he pro∣tracted
<PB N="277" REF="311"/>
his March, in Hopes they would y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
come to some sort of Terms. But hearing
nothing from them, he came and posted him∣self
at <HI>Acharnae</HI> the greatest Borough-Town in
<HI>Attica,</HI> and but seven Miles from <HI>Athens.</HI> The
Alarm was no sooner got into the City, but
the People were ready to mutiny against <HI>Peri∣cles,</HI>
for not leading them into the Field. He
thought it by no Means adviseable; and there∣fore
would not so much as convene them, least
the Surprise should make them resolve upon
any thing that was rash, or extravagant: In∣somuch
that <HI>Cleon,</HI> who was endeavouring to
supplant him in his Interest with the People,
reproach'd him with downright Cowardise.
He chose rather to put up every thing, than
to venture a Sally: But to shew, that he did not
neglect his Charge, he shut up the City Gates;
plac'd sufficient Guards at all the Posts about
it; sent out Parties of Horse to keep the Ene∣my
at a Distance, one of which in a Skirmish
with the <HI>Boeotians</HI> was repuls'd with Loss; and
at the same time order'd out a hundred Ga∣lies,
to intest the Coasts of <HI>Peloponnesus. Ar∣chidamus</HI>
finding his Provisions fail, and that
he could not bring the <HI>Athenians</HI> to a Battel,
broke up his Camp at <HI>Acharna,</HI> and having ra∣vag'd
the Country about it, return'd home;
and the rather because the <HI>Athenian</HI> Fleet in
Conjunction with the Allies, was likely to make
successful Descents. They landed in <HI>Laconia,</HI>
and had taken <HI>Methone,</HI> if <HI>Brasidas</HI> a <HI>Spar∣tan</HI>
had not thrown himself into the Town
with a Supply, and beat them back to their
Ships: For which Service he was the first in
this War, who receiv'd publick Applause at
<PB N="278" REF="312"/>
<HI>Sparta.</HI> From thence coasting along, they put
in an <HI>Elis,</HI> where they hara<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d the Country,
plunder'd <HI>Pheia,</HI> and defeated those who op∣pos'd
them. About the same Time another
Squadron of Thirty Gallies, which was sent as
a Guard to <HI>Euboea,</HI> had the like Success against
the <HI>Loc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i Opuntii.</HI> Upon the Enemies quit∣ting
<HI>Attica,</HI> the <HI>Athenians</HI> decreed, that an hun∣dred
of the best Gallies, and a thousand Ta∣lents
should be set apart in Cafe of an Inva∣sion
by Sea; and made it Capital for any Man
to motion the diverting either the Ships, or
Mony to any other Use. They also took Oc∣casion
to displace the <HI>aeginetans,</HI> upon Pre∣tence
that they principally occasion'd the War:
But the Truth is, the found this Island lay
very convenient for their Afffirs, and wanted
it to case their own City, which was prodigi∣ously
over-tock'd with Inhabitants. Then
they drew over to their Alliance <HI>Sitacles</HI> King
of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and <HI>Perdiccas</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> in Order
to proceed with more Vigour in those Parts,
especially against <HI>Potidoea.</HI> The Fleet still cru∣sing
about, the Forces on board it took several
Towns, with the whole Island of <HI>Cephallenia</HI>
without Opposition, and return'd home. Thus
the <HI>Athenians</HI> being left at Liberty to act ofsen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sively
by Land as well as Sea, invaded <HI>Me∣garis</HI>
with their whole Force, which made up
the greatest Army they ever had together in
one Place before. Having laid waste great Part
of the Country, they return'd: But constant∣ly
every Year made the same Incursions, 'till
at last they got into their Hands <HI>Nisaea,</HI> a strong
Haven with Walls reaching up to the City of
<PB N="279" REF="313"/>
<HI>Megara.</HI> These were the principal Transactions
of the first Campaign.</P>
<P>In the Winter were solemniz'd the Funeral,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fune∣ral Solem/nities/s.</HI></NOTE>
of the first slain in the War. The Manner of
performing it, was to place the Bodies in Tents
three Days before the Funeral, that their Friends
might come, and pay their last Respects to
them. Upon the fourth Day a Coffin of Cy∣press
was sent, one from every Tribe, to convey
the Bones of their own Relations: After which
went an empty cover'd Herse in Memory of
those, whose Bodies could not he found. All
these accompany'd with the whole Body of the
People, were carry'd to the Publick Burying-Place, call'd <HI>Ceramicus,</HI> and there interr'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The
Ceremony was concluded with one Harangue in
Praise of them all; which Task was at this Time
assign'd to <HI>Pericles.</HI> The main Scope of his Speech,
was to infuse Courage into the Living, by cele∣brating
the Memory of the Dead, and setting
before their Eyes the Glory of dying for their
Country with their Swords in their Hands,
especially for a Country sso glorious in all Re∣spects,
as was then the Common-wealth of <HI>A∣thens.</HI>
And however preposterous it might
seem, for him who advis'd the War, to com∣memorate
those who had lost their Lives in it;
yet probably never Man succeeded better in it;
insomuch that his Discourse upon this Occa∣sion
is a Standard in its kind, being look<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d up∣on
as one of the most artificial, and sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rid
Pieces of Antiquity. Thus ended the first
Year of the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the next Summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 87. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Ar∣chidamus</HI>
again invaded <HI>Attica,</HI> with the same
Number of Men as before: At which Time a
<PB N="280" REF="314"/>
terrible Plague having travell'd over most Parts
of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A great plague in</HI> Athens.</NOTE> arriv'd at <HI>Athens,</HI> and took off all
the Flower of its Armies both at Home and
Abroad. It s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz'd them with such Violence,
that they tumbled down one upon another, as
they pass'd along the Streets. It was also at∣tended
with such uncommon Exhalations of
Venom, and Putrefaction, that the very Beasts
and Birds of Prey would not touch those who
dy'd of it: And in many of those who reco∣ver'd,
it left such a Tincture of its Malignancy,
that it struck upon their Senses; it effac'd the
Notices and Memory of all the Passages of their
Lives, and they knew neither themselves, nor
their nearest Relations. The Circumstances of this
Disease are describ'd at large by <HI>Thucydides,</HI> who
was sick of it himself: And he observes among
other Effects of it, that it introduc'd into the
City a more licentious Way of Living. For
the People at first had Recourse to their Gods,
to avert that Judgment: But finding they
were all alike infected, whether they worshipp'd
them or not, and that it was generally Mortal,
they abandon'd themselves at once to Despair,
and Riot. For since they held their Lives but,
as it were, by the Day, they were resolv'd to
make the most of their Time, and Mony. The
Cause of it was generally imputed to <HI>Pericles,</HI>
who by drawing such Numbers into the City,
was thought to have corrupted the very Air.
Yet tho' this was raging within, and the Ene∣my
wasting the Country without, he was still
of the same Mind as before, that they ought
not to put all their Hopes upon the Issue of a
Battel. In the mean while he put to Sea with
an hundred Gallies, and four thousand Foot,
<PB N="281" REF="315"/>
and three hundred Horse on board them; and
being join'd by fifty Sail from <HI>Chios,</HI> and <HI>Les∣bos,</HI>
made an Attempt upon <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> but
miscarry'd: And having committed what Spoil
he could upon the Coasts of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> re∣turn'd
home. However this prov'd a Diversion
to the <HI>Peloponnesians,</HI> who partly to defend their
Territories, and partly for Fear of the Infecti∣on,
quitted <HI>Attica</HI> after almost forty Days In∣cursion.
The Forces employ'd by <HI>Pericles</HI>
were now sent into <HI>Thrace:</HI> But the Plague
swept off so many of them before <HI>Potidaea,</HI> that
they did nothing considerable.</P>
<P>These fruitless Expeditions serv'd to incense,
and terrifies the People; who being almost
crush'd with the Sword, Pestilence, and De∣predations
all at a Time, began to clamour
violently against <HI>Pericles,</HI> as the sole Author of
all their Calamities; and in the mean while
sent to make Overtures at <HI>Sparta,</HI> but they
were not accepted. <HI>Pericles</HI> finding them thus
dispirited, assembled them, in order to encou∣rage
them to the War, by justifying his own
Management. But his Harangue to them, how∣soever
forcible by those masterly, and engaging
Strokes he gave it, had little Effect upon their
Minds, who were sensible of nothing but their
Misfortunes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pericles <HI>in Disgrace.</HI></NOTE> So that they Fin'd him in a great
Sum, and took away his Command: But find∣ing
no Body fit to succeed him in so weighty
a Charge, they soon restor'd him.</P>
<P>The same Summer <HI>Cnemus</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> Ad∣miral
put to Sea with an hundred Gallies, and
made a Descent upon <HI>Zacynthus:</HI> But the In∣habitants
continuing firm to the <HI>Athenian</HI> Inte∣rest,
he only ravag'd the Island, and return'd.
<PB N="282" REF="316"/>
After which <HI>Aristaeus</HI> the <HI>Corinthian,</HI> and some
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> intending a Voyage to <HI>Persia,</HI>
to procure Mony of the King towards carrying
on the War, went by the way to <HI>Sitalces</HI> King
of <HI>Thrace,</HI> solliciting him to break with the <HI>A∣thenians,</HI>
and march with his Army to the Re∣lief
of <HI>Potidaea.</HI> But the <HI>Athenian</HI> Ambassa∣dors
prevailing with the King to deliver them
up, they were sent from thence to <HI>Athens,</HI> and
thrown into deep Pits without any Form of
Justice. This was said to be done in Return
to the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> who had given the like
Treatment to some <HI>Athenian</HI> Merchants taken
off of <HI>Peloponnesus:</HI> But the Design was laid
more particularly against <HI>Aristaeus,</HI> who was
charg'd as the Author of all the Commotions in
<HI>Thrace.</HI> This Winter <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idaea</HI> was surrendered;
and tho' the Garrison was reduc'd to that Ex∣tremity
for want of Provisions, that they eat
one another, yet they obtain'd such tolerable
Terms, that the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who commanded
there, were question'd for not making them
Prisoners at Discretion. The <HI>Athenians</HI> planted
a Colony of their own in that City, after the
Siege of it had stood them in two thousand
Talents. This Action concluded the second
Year of the War.</P>
<P>II. The <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> open'd the third Cam∣paign
with an Attempt upon <HI>Plataea;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olym. 87. 4</HI></NOTE> whose In∣habitants
sent to Expostulate with them, urging
the Privileges granted to them by <HI>Pausanias,</HI>
when he defeated the <HI>Persians</HI> in their Territo∣ry.
But they could obtain nothing more than
a Suspension of Arms, 'till they could send an
Account of their Affairs to <HI>Athens;</HI> from
<PB N="283" REF="317"/>
whence they receiv'd such firm Assurances of
being reliev'd, that they sent Word to <HI>Archi∣damus,
They were ready to undergo the last Ex∣tremity
of War, since to renounce their Confede∣racy
with</HI> Athens, <HI>was what they never could
consent to.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plataea <HI>be∣sieg'd.</HI></NOTE> Upon which <HI>Archidamus</HI> invested
the City, and rais'd an <HI>Agger</HI> or Mount, to
command the Walls. The <HI>Plataeans</HI> rais'd their
Wall in Proportion; and at the same Time by
an Hole at the Bottom, drew great Quantities
of Earth from the Mount: Which being disco∣ver'd,
they improv'd the Stratagem by carrying
a Mine to it from the Town; so that still as
the Wall was heighten'd, the Mount sunk;
and for their further Security, they run up ano∣ther
Wall within. The <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> apply'd
their Engines of Battery to the Walls: But the
Defendants had several Contrivances by Beams
let down with Ropes, to evade the Force of
them. So that this Method also proving in∣effectual,
they had Recourse to Fire; and by
throwing in vast Quantities of Fagots, with
Brimstone, Pitch, and such like combustible
Matter, they burnt great Part of the Town.
But the Flame being at last extinguish'd, they
were forc'd to make a formal Siege of it: In
order to which they inclos'de the City with a
Wall, which was fenced with a Ditch on each
Side. But it being late in the Year, they drew
off the Main of their Army, leaving only the
<HI>Boeotians</HI> with some others, to maintain their
Works, and keep the City block'd up. This
is the first Description we meet with of any
Thing like a regular Siege among the <HI>Grecians;</HI>
those which had hitherto been carry'd on, be∣ing
very artless, and consequently tedious,
<PB N="284" REF="318"/>
and expensive. Their common Method, when they
endeavour'd to possess themselves of a
Town, was to attempt it by Storm, surround∣ing
it with their whole Army, and attack∣ing
it in all Quarters at once; and if this prov'd
ineffectual, they either desisted from the En∣terprise,
or only renew'd the Assault after the
same rude Manner. Not but they had a Noti∣on
in the <HI>Trojan,</HI> and <HI>Theban</HI> Wars of some∣thing
like the <HI>Battering-Ram, Scaling-Ladders,</HI>
and other Engines; the Invention whereof they
very probably deriv'd with the rest of their
Knowledge from the <HI>Eastern</HI> Countries, where
they seem to have been understood even in
<HI>Moses</HI>'s Time, and made Use of by several of
the <HI>JewisH</HI> Kings. And if they did not receive
the same Improvement in <HI>Greece,</HI> proportion∣ably
to their other Military Discipline, it may
be attributed chiefly to the Aversion the <HI>Lace∣dAemonians</HI>
express'd to this Way of Conquer∣ing,
as not agreeable to their Notions of a gene∣rous
Valour, which they made to consist only
in pitch'd Battels. But when they found the
other <HI>Grecian</HI> Cities would not follow their
Example, of leaving themselves open to all In∣vaders
without the Defence of Walls, they
were better convinc'd of the Inconveniences,
into which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Ignorance in Sieges was likely
to betray them, and apply'd themselves to this
necessary part of the Service, in order to put
them upon a more equal Foot with their Neigh∣bours.
So that from the time of this War we
may date the Art of Fortifying, and Attack∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="319"/>
During this Siege, the <HI>Athenians</HI> were en∣gag'd
with the <HI>Chalcideans</HI> of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and the
<HI>Bottiaeans</HI> of <HI>Macedon:</HI> But they being reliev'd
from <HI>Olynthus,</HI> and other Places, fought them,
and overcame them, compelling them to retire
with their broken Forces to <HI>Potidaea,</HI> and from
thence home to <HI>Athens.</HI> However this Dis∣grace
was soon reveng'd at Sea by <HI>Phormio</HI> the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Admiral;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Phormio</HI> Vvictorious at Sea.</NOTE> who lying before <HI>Naupactus,</HI>
tell in with forty seven <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> Sail, with
Land Forces on board them bound upon an Ex∣pedition
against the <HI>Acarnanians,</HI> took twelve,
and dispers'd the rest. The <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> ha∣ving
made great Preparations, ventur'd upon a∣nother
Engagement; but by Confusion, and
Mismanagement, the Advantage was again on
the <HI>Athenians</HI> Side. Before the Fleets were
laid up, <HI>Cnemus, Brasidas,</HI> and the other <HI>Pelo∣ponnesian</HI>
Admirals resolv'd to make an Attempt
upon the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> which was very slightly guar∣ded,
because the <HI>Athenians</HI> being Lords of the
Sea, were under no Apprehensions on that Side.
In order to their Design, they went over Land
to <HI>Megara,</HI> and at <HI>Nisaea</HI> the Port-Town
launch'd forty Ships: But their Hearts failing
them as to the Enterprise of the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> and
the Wind withal being contrary, they conten∣ted
themselves with falling upon three Guard-Ships,
that lay at <HI>Budorus</HI> a Promontory of <HI>Sa∣lamis:</HI>
Having taken them, they enter'd <HI>Sala∣mis,</HI>
and plunder'd great Part of the Island.
The <HI>Athenians</HI> discover'd the Beacons on Fire;
and this put them into a greater Consternation,
than any thing that had happen'd during the War:
But when the <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> found they had ta∣ken
the Alarm, they retreated.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="320"/>
In the Beginning of this Winter, <HI>Sitalces</HI>
King of <HI>Thrace</HI> made War against <HI>Perdiccas</HI>
King of <HI>Macedon.</HI> and wasted his Country
with an Army of an hundred and fifty thou∣sand
Men. The <HI>Macedonians</HI> were forc'd to
shelter themselves within their Towns; and
this numerous Army struck such a Terror into
the other Neighbouring Nations, that the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI>
themselves were afraid, they had call'd in
such a Confederate, as was likely to become
their Master. <HI>Phormio</HI> the <HI>Athenian</HI> Admiral
having settled Affairs in <HI>Acarnania,</HI> return'd
Victorious with his Spoils to <HI>Athens;</HI> and thus

him not sensible, were engag'd in a Discourse
about his Virtue, and Authority, and the
Number of his Victories, he having erected no
less than nine Trophies as Commander in Chief.
He gave great Attention to what pass'd, and
made a sudden Reply, <HI>That he wonder'd, they

which Fortune had made common to him with
others, and pass by that which was of far greater
Moment, that none of his Fellow-Citizens had

to his Glory, that when he had foil'd

Hands, he stopt just there, where oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs would
have been most likely to proceed. But he was
certainly of a great and generous Spirit; he
acted upon a Principle of Honour, and Equity,
and seem'd to value himself more upon leading
the People of <HI>Athens</HI> by the Force of his Merit,
and Eloquence, than by any thing of Arbitrary
Sway: So that that Power, which would other∣wise
have been branded with the Name of Ty∣ranny,
prov'd, as he manag'd it, the mildest,
and yet the strongest Support of the Govern∣ment.
In his Military Conduct, however
warm he appear'd in advising a War, yet when
it came to Action, he was very cautious, and
deliberate, not caring to engage, but where he
could almost warrant the Success. And this
turn'd very much to his Reputation, being in∣terpreted
as his Tenderness of exposing his Fel∣low-Citizens;
to whom he would often say,
<HI>That he for his Part would do what he could, to
make them Immortal.</HI> At another time, when
he had much ado to restrain them from
Action, he told them, <HI>They must not expect,
that Men, like Trees, when they were cut off,
would shoot up again.</HI> In short, his Experi∣ence
had taught him to depend more upon Con∣duct,
and Stratagem, than an hardy Valour.
And tho' he had often been engag'd in War,
he made it chiefly subservient to his other De∣signs,
<PB N="288" REF="322"/>
chusing it, not so much to make the
<HI>Athenians</HI> terrible abroad, as great at home.
His principal Care, and Study, was to sit and
direct at the Helm; wherein he succeeded so
well, that he held the Administration for forty
Years; and that in the most flourishing time
of the Common-wealth. This long uncontrou∣lable
Sway of his, is to be attributed to nothing
more, than to his <HI>Art of Speaking;</HI> by which,
like a rapid Stream, he bore down every thing
that oppos'd him, and triumph'd over the Peo∣ples
Passions, and Affections, which <HI>Plutarch</HI>
calls the <HI>Stops,</HI> and <HI>Keys</HI> of the Soul, and which
at that time in <HI>Athens,</HI> requir'd an extraordinary
skilful Hand to touch them. Not but the
Force of his Language was also supported by
the Opinion the People had of his Integrity.
That he was above all Considerations of Mony,
appears in nothing more, than that he made no
Addition to his private Estate: And tho' he
took upon him to dispose of prodigious Sums of
the publick Mony, he laid it out chiefly to the
Advantage, and Ornament of the State; and
whilst he kept it circulating, did not drain the
Channel, tho' he diverted the Course. We
may form a great <HI>Idea</HI> of him even from the
Censure of those, who seem to bear hardest
upon him; <HI>That the main of his Character a∣greed
with that of</HI> Pisistratus, <HI>only with this Dif∣ference,
that he maintain'd his Tyranny with Arms,
but</HI> Pericles <HI>without them.</HI> The Loss of this great
Man appear'd every Day more considerable,
when his Successors, who were for the most part
equal in Merit, and Rivals in Dignity, wanting
sufficient Power to rein up the People, with
an absolute Hand, were oblig'd to manage them
<PB N="289" REF="323"/>
more remissly, to sooth, and flatter them into
Obedience: And thus whilst every one was
promoting his own Interest, the Care of the
Publick was suspended.</P>
<P>About Harvest time the <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> inva∣ded
<HI>Attica</HI> a third Time;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 88. 1</NOTE> but having done lit∣tle
more than destroy'd the Corn, return'd
home.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lesbos <HI>re∣volts.</HI></NOTE> At the time of their Incursion, all <HI>Les∣bos,</HI>
except <HI>Methymna,</HI> revolted from the <HI>A∣thenians;</HI>
who thinking what a considerable Ac∣cession
this would be to the Enemy, pretended
at first not to believe it, in hopes by that
means to keep the Inhabitants from declaring
themselves. But when they found the greatest
Part of the Island had thrown themselves into
<HI>Mitylene</HI> their Capital, in order to make further
Preparations, they mann'd out forty Gallies to
surprise them at a Feast in Honour of <HI>Apollo,</HI>
where they were to be assembled without the
City; which the <HI>Lesbians</HI> having Notice of,
prepar'd to receive them; and whilst they were
parlying with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> sent to <HI>Lacedaemon</HI>
for speedy Relief. The <HI>Spartans</HI> referr'd the
Ambassadors to the general Meeting of the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI>
of the Celebration at this <HI>Olympiad;</HI>
where, after the Solemnity was over, they de∣clar'd
their good Intentions to the common
Cause; intimating, <HI>That they had all along been
ill-affected to</HI> Athens, <HI>and sided with her no
otherwise, than in Opposition to the</HI> Persian, <HI>and in
Defence of the common Liberty of</HI> Greece:
Which they insinuated with so much Artifice,
that they were now easily admitted into the
Confederacy, tho' they had been deny'd it in
the Beginning of the War. Their Ports being
at this time block'd up by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> they
<PB N="290" REF="324"/>
had immediate Supplies decreed them: And a∣nother
Expedition into <HI>Attica</HI> was resolv'd on;
in order to which, the <HI>Spartans</HI> were ready at
the <HI>Isthmus.</HI> But their Allies not coming up,
and thirty <HI>Athenian</HI> Ships at the same time ha∣rassing
the Coast of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> they were
forc'd to return. The <HI>Mitylenians</HI> in the mean
while attempted <HI>Methymna,</HI> but miscarry'd;
and the <HI>Athenians</HI> to prevent these Excursions,
sent fresh Supplies, which block'd them by
Land as well as Sea. This Year the <HI>Atheni∣ans</HI>
set out the greatest Fleet they ever had at
Sea; which with the Soldiers Pay, so exhausted
the publick Treasure, that besides the usual
Tribute exacted from the Confederates, they
were forc'd to Assess themselves. In the Win∣ter
scarce any thing of Moment happen'd, ex∣cept
that the <HI>Plataeans</HI> having been besieg'd all
this while, and extreamly press'd for want of
Provisions, above two hundred of them pre∣par'd
Ladders, proportioning their Length by
the Number, and Breadth of the Bricks in the
Enemy's Wall, and passing their Works by fa∣vour
of a stormy Night, escap'd to <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>Early in the Spring the <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> fell a∣gain
into <HI>Attica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 88. 2</NOTE> under the Conduct of <HI>Cleome∣nes</HI>
Uncle and Guardian to <HI>Pausanias</HI> the young
<HI>Spartan</HI> King, and destroy'd every thing that
had escap'd them in their former IncuRsions.
<HI>Alcidas</HI> at the same time went with forty Gal∣lies
to the Relief of <HI>Mitylene:</HI> But before he
Could arrive, the <HI>Lesbians</HI> despairing of Suc∣cours,
and distress'd for Want of Provisions,
<HI>Salaethus</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> Governor, who had hi∣therto
kept them disarm'd, now gave them
Arms with an Intent to make a Sally. But
<PB N="291" REF="325"/>
instead of that, they threaten'd, that unless
they who had Corn, would bring it out and
divide it, they would make their Composition,
and deliver up the Place to the Enemy. The
Magistrates finding that they would not be
controul'd, and fearing least they themselves
should be excluded, did by a general Con∣sent
treat with <HI>Paches</HI> the <HI>Athenian</HI> General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Les∣bians sur nender at Discretion.</NOTE>
and surrender'd at Discretion. The Au∣thors
of the Revolt expecting no Mercy from
the Conquerors, fled to the Altars; from
whence they were taken, and convey'd to <HI>Te∣nedos</HI>
'till further Orders. <HI>Paches</HI> in the mean
while took in several other little Places; and
then sent the Prisoners to <HI>Athens,</HI> where they
were put to Death, and with them <HI>Salaethus,</HI>
tho' among other Offers for his Pardon, he
promis'd to procure the raising the Siege of
<HI>Plataea.</HI> Besides the Execution of above a
Thousand <HI>Lesbians</HI> at <HI>Athens,</HI> a Decree was
made, and sent to <HI>Mitylene</HI> to do Justice on
the rest of the Inhabitants, and to make Slaves
of the Women, and Children. But the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
immediately after repenting of their Cru∣elty,
the Matter came again the next Day in∣to
Debate: Where <HI>Cleon,</HI> who was grown ex∣treamly
popular upon the Death of <HI>Pericles,</HI>
and was the chief Author of this Decree, still
persisted in his Opinion, <HI>That it was necessary
to make an Example of them.</HI> He urg'd, <HI>That
if they, who were left to the quiet Enjoyment of
their own Laws, and Liberty, and being Islan∣ders
well provided with Shipping, and therefore
safe from any Attempts of the Eneny, were suf∣fer'd
to revolt without Punishment, what would
not the rest of their Confederates attempt, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho
<PB N="292" REF="326"/>
obey'd them purely by Compulsion, and had Reason
to look upon <HI>Athens,</HI> as no better than a Tyranny
erected over them?</HI> He told them, <HI>That upon
whatever Grounds they valu'd their Constitution,
they ought not to trifle with their Laws; for that
ill ones well observ'd were better than good ones,
that were despis'd, or neglected: That a well-meaning,
and regular Ignorance was preferable to
a disorderly, and inconstant Knowledge: And in
short, That nothing was of more dangerous Con∣sequence
to a State, than Pity.</HI> But <HI>Diodotus,</HI>
who had before oppos'd him in this Affair,
prevail'd with the People to countermand their
Orders, by sending another Gally to <HI>Mitylene,</HI>
which arriv'd just as they were going to be
put in Execution. However their Shipping
was seiz'd, their Walls raz'd, and a tenth Part
of their Lands being dedicated to their Gods,
the rest was divided among the <HI>Athenians;</HI> who
instead of their yearly Contribution, rented it
out to them again.</P>
<P>The same Summer <HI>Nicias</HI> the <HI>Athenian</HI> took,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plataea <HI>sur∣render'd.</HI></NOTE>
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortify'd <HI>Minoa</HI> an Island over-against <HI>Me∣garis</HI>
for rhe better Security of those Coasts.
The <HI>Plataeans</HI> at last worn out with a long and
vigorous Defence, surrender'd at Discretion;
and were kept 'till five Men were deputed
from <HI>Sparta</HI> in the Nature of Judges, to pro∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
against them. But they instead of exhi∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting
a formal Accusation, only put this single
Question to them, <HI>Whether they had done any
Service to the</HI> Lacedaemonians, <HI>and their Confe∣derates
during this War?</HI> They avoided an∣swering
directly, but urg'd their Services at
large, not only as to the Common Cause, but
also to the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> in particular, when
<PB N="293" REF="327"/>
they were almost destroy'd by the Earthquake,
and the Rebellion of their <HI>Helots. That if they
did not continue in the Alliance, it was their own
Fault, since they first referr'd them to the</HI> Athe∣nians,
<HI>to whom they had ever since been oblig'd
in Honour, and Justice to adhere.</HI> They press'd
their Case with a becoming Gravity, without
being arrogant, or dejected: But the <HI>Thebans</HI>
turn'd their Arguments so forcibly upon that,
them the Judges only repeated the same Que∣stion
to them severally. <HI>What Service they had
done 'em during the War?</HI> And upon their an∣swering,
<HI>None,</HI> order'd them to be executed to
the Number of two hundred <HI>Plataeans,</HI> and
twentyfive <HI>Athenians.</HI> What the <HI>Lacedaemo∣nians</HI>
alledg'd to justifie their Proceedings, was,
that they had propos'd to the <HI>Plataeans</HI> in the
Beginning of the War to stand Neuter; and
that this Offer not being accepted, left them
at Liberty to treat them with the utmost Se∣verity.
But they seem rather to have grati∣fy'd
the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who had a more particular
Pique to them: And upon this Account
the <HI>Plataeans</HI> in their Defence, reproach'd the
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> with sacrificing their Justice, to
keep up the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ederacy. <HI>If you measure Ju∣stice
by your Interests,</HI> said they, <HI>you will give
us Reason to believe your Interests are dearer to
you, than your Glory.</HI> And indeed it does not
appear, that the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> still kept up to
that rigorous Principle of Honour, and Equity,
upon which so great a Share of their Merit was
founded; but that during the whole Course of
this War, they gave way to Passion, and Inte∣rest,
as much as any of their Neighbours. Be∣sides
this severe Sentence, the Women were
<PB N="294" REF="328"/>
also adjudg'd to Slavery, the Lands set to Farm
for ten Years to the <HI>Thebans;</HI> and the next
Year the City was utterly demolish'd, and lay
in Ruins for many Year. This was the Fate
of <HI>Platae</HI> after it had been about ninety Years in
Alliance with <HI>Athens;</HI> tho' it deserv'd a much
milder Treatment, in Regard of that extraor∣dinary
Zeal it had express'd against the <HI>Persian,</HI>
even to the alienating its Lands to the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI>
because the Oracle had advis'd, <HI>That the
memorable Battel of</HI> Plataea <HI>should be fought on</HI>
Athenian <HI>Ground.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> who went to the Relief
of <HI>Lesbos,</HI> finding the Island lost beyond Re∣covery,
had Thoughts of securing some Town
upon the Coasts of <HI>Asia,</HI> in order to draw
<HI>Ionia</HI> over to the Confederacy; or if that Pro∣ject
fail'd, to remove the Seat of the War thi∣ther:
But it being oppos'd by <HI>Alcidas,</HI> as too
hazardous an Undertaking, and <HI>Paches</HI> at the
same time being in Pursuit of them, they made
the best of their Way home.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A great Sedition at</HI> Corcyra.</NOTE> Blaceut before they
put into Harbour, hearing of a great Sedition
at <HI>Corcyra,</HI> they made thither, in hopes by
the Division of the Island, to become Ma∣sters
of it. They found the Contest got to a
great heighth between the Chief Men, and the
Commons; the latter of which having call'd
in the <HI>Athenians</HI> to their Assistance, the <HI>Lace∣daemonians</HI>
took part with the Magistracy; and
beat the <HI>Corcyraean,</HI> and <HI>Athenian</HI> Navy, but
durst not attempt the City, where the People
had the better; who being still strengthen'd by
the Arrival of sixty Sail more from <HI>Athens,</HI>
committed the most horrible Outrages, butch∣ering
one another at the Altars, without Di∣stinction
<PB N="293" REF="329"/>
of Age, or Quality, Sex, or Blood.
The City was one continu'd Scene of Mur∣der;
Death was to be seen in all its Shapes;
and those who would have stood Neuter, were
made a Sacrifice to both Parties. Of all the
Factions, and Innovations, which had happen'd
in <HI>Greece,</HI> this is the first Instance of things be∣ing
carry'd to the last Extremity; insomuch
that a <HI>Corcynean Sedition</HI> came to be us'd pro∣verbialraly.
This Example had also a fatal In∣fluence
on several other Cities, which upon the
slightest Differences between the Nobility and
People, were immediately for calling in their
respective Patriots, the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and <HI>Lacedaemonians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sicily</HI> also at this Time began to be in
Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commoti∣ons in</HI> Si∣cily</NOTE> upon a Quarrel between <HI>Syracuse,</HI> and
<HI>Leontium.</HI> These two Cities form'd their Con∣federacies
in Order to carry on a vigorous
War: And the <HI>Leontines</HI> upon a Pretence of
Consanguinity, (they being originally <HI>Ionians</HI>)
drew over the <HI>Athenians</HI> to their Party. They
were glad to have Footing in the Island upon
any Terms, both to hinder the transporting of
Corn from thence to <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and to see
if there were any Possibility of subduing it for
themselves. This was what they had an Eye
upon in <HI>Pericles</HI>'s Time, and what he seems
particularly to have caution'd them against,
when in advising the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War, he
grounded their Certainty of Success upon their
not endeavouring to extend their Conquests,
or grasp at more than they were able to ma∣nage.
However they sent thither but twenty
Gallies, which in Conjunction with ten more
from <HI>Rhegium</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> harass'd the <HI>Aeolian</HI>
<PB N="296" REF="330"/>

with Preparations for another Irruption
into <HI>Attica;</HI> but were deterr'd from it by the
frequent Earthquakes, which happen'd in those
Parts. The <HI>Athenians</HI> at the same time set out
two Fleets, one of thirty Sail under <HI>Demosthe∣nes,</HI>
to cruise about <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> the other of
sixty, to make a Descent upon the Island <HI>Me∣los.
Nicias,</HI> who commanded this latter, did
nothing very considerable in <HI>Melos;</HI> from
whence he made to the opposite Continent,

in <HI>Boeotia,</HI> and return'd, <HI>Demosthenes</HI> invaded
the <HI>Aetolians,</HI> at first with good Success; but
they having Intelligence of his March, and
being got into a Body to receive him, he
was routed, and lost the Flower of his Army.

which was in great Danger of being
taken; and then joining with the <HI>Acarnanians,</HI>
defeated the <HI>Ambraciots,</HI> who were abandon'd
by their <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> Confederates. This Vi∣ctory
brought him again into Favour, and
procur'd a Peace between the <HI>Ambraciots,</HI> and
<HI>Acarnanians.</HI></P>
<P>The next Year began,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 88. 4</NOTE> according to Custom,

on foot, the <HI>Athenians,</HI> to bring it to an Issue,
sent forty Gallies more under <HI>Eurymedon,</HI> and
<HI>Sophocles,</HI> with Orders to touch at <HI>Corcyra,</HI>
and see if there were yet any Remains of the Sedi∣tion.
To these was join'd <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> whose
Business was to infest the Coasts of <HI>Peloponne∣sus.</HI>
In his Way he open'd his Design of sur∣prising
<HI>Pylus,</HI> a ragged Promontory of <HI>Messcnia,</HI>
with a small barren Island lying before it, and
within that a Creek, which was capable of ma∣king
a very good Harbour. His Collegues not
consenting to the Project, it happen'd, that
they were forc'd in thither by Stress of Wea∣ther:
And the Soldiers of their own Accord,
when they saw how advantageously the Place
was situated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pyius ta∣ken,</NOTE> set to fortifying it with utmost
Diligence, and finish'd their Works in six Days;
after which the other Captains proceeding on
their Voyage, left <HI>Demosthenes</HI> with five Gal∣lies
to secure it. The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> know∣ing
it to be a Place of too great Importance
to be neglected, immediately quitted <HI>Attica,</HI>
and drew down their whole Force to recover
it; Part of which they threw into <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acteria</HI>

who having maintain'd his Ground for two
Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and de∣fended.</NOTE> on the third was reliev'd by the Fleet,
which put back again upon Notice of his Dan∣ger.
These Gallies made an Offer of Fight
in the open Sea; which not being accepted by
the <HI>Peloponnesians,</HI> they rush'd into the Harbour,
broke, and sunk many of the Enemy, took five,
and forc'd the rest on Shore.</P>

<HI>Pylus</HI> being by this Means secur'd, and the
<HI>Spartans</HI> in the Island as the same time closely
besieg'd, there came in great Numbers of the
<HI>Peloponnesians,</HI> and among them some of the
<HI>Spartan</HI> Magistrates; who seeing no Possibility
of rescuing their Countrymen in the Island,
but upon Terms, demanded a Truce in Order
to treat of a general Peace at <HI>Athens;</HI> which
accordingly was granted upon the Delivery of
their Ships to them as a Security, 'till such
time as their Ambasadors should return.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Lacae∣demoni∣ons <HI>one for Peace.</HI></NOTE> They

This was such a Concession, as the <HI>Lacedaenm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nians</HI>
had never before consented to, and ar∣gu'd
their Affairs to be at a very low Ebb,
when they were content to forfeit their Title
of the <HI>Deliverers</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> only to share in
the Tyranny, or rather to assist their Rivals in
the Oppression of it. However, <HI>Cle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> finding
them so complying, insisted on it as a Preli∣minary
of the Treaty, That those in the I∣sland
<HI>Sphacteria</HI> should be deliver'd up as Pri∣soners,
for whose sake the Treaty it self was
set on Foot; and made other such exorbitant

that the Truce was broke, and it being

<P>The War being renew'd on both Sides, was

which holding out longer than was expected,
the <HI>Athenians</HI> began to repent of their Obsti∣nacy
about a Peace. Which as it stuck chief∣ly
upon <HI>Cleon,</HI> he, to pacifie them, undertook
to force the Island, which with great Hazard,

and their Men: But the City had yet too flou∣rishing
a Prospect, to hearken to any Terms.
For besides this Success, the <HI>Athenians</HI> had justdefeated
a good Body of <HI>Corinthians</HI> in the <HI>Isthmus.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Pylus</HI> the Fleet went forward again to <HI>Corcyra;</HI>
and joining with them in the City,
forc'd the Exiles, who had retird to the Hills,
and from thence infested the Country, to sur∣render,
and remain Prisoners, 'till Orders came
from <HI>Athens</HI> how to dispose of them. But in
Case any one of them offer'd to make his
Escape, they were all to lose the Benefit of the
Treaty. The other <HI>Corcyraeans</HI> fearing the <HI>A∣thenians</HI>
would not do Justice on them, secret∣ly
encourag'd some to fly; and thus the Condi∣tions
being broken, they were all deliver'd up
to the <HI>Corcyraeans;</HI> by whom some of them
were cruelly put to Death by running a sort of
<HI>Gantlet</HI> between their Spears; to prevent which,
the rest became their own Executioners with
Arrows, Ropes, and such other Instruments,
as they had at hand.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sediti∣on at</HI> Cor∣cyra <HI>sup<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>press<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI></NOTE> This put a final Period

themselves from that Expedition.</P>
<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym 89. 1</NOTE> The next Summer the <HI>Athenians</HI> acting
offensively, <HI>Nicias</HI> with a good Fleet surpris'd
<PB N="301" REF="335"/>
several garrison'd Places; among which was
<HI>Cythera</HI> an Island of great Importance, and <HI>Thy∣rea,</HI>
the Inhabitants of which latter being the
<HI>Aeginetans,</HI> whom the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> had taken
under their Protection, were upon account of
their long Enmity with <HI>Athens,</HI> most of them
put to Death. The <HI>Grecian</HI> Cities in <HI>Sicily</HI>
were at this time inclinable to a Peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Peace in</HI> Sicily.</NOTE> which
was accordingly concluded at the Persuasion of
<HI>Hermocrates</HI> a <HI>Syracusian,</HI> who convinc'd them
of the <HI>Athenians</HI> Designs, <HI>That they lay hove∣ring.
about them, rather as Spies than Confede∣rates,
and only waited an Opportunity, when
their Power should be sufficiently broken by their
Divisions, to seize the whole Island.</HI> And this
Opinion the <HI>Athenians</HI> themselves confirm'd,
when finding they had no Pretence to keep their
footing in those Parts, they banish'd two of
their Admirals, and fin'd a third for not oppo∣sing
the Treaty. It was indeed alledg'd, that
they were bought off: But as nothing was
more frequent among the Rivals in the Peo∣ples
Favour, than when things went amiss, to
accuse one another of Bribery, their Punish∣ment
proceeded rather from the Peevishness of
the State, which being blown up by a con∣stant
Glut of Prosperity, thought no Enter∣prise
too difficult to accomplish, but rather
that they lost every thing they did not at∣tempt.</P>
<P>There having been a great Faction in <HI>Me∣gara,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Stirs <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>words<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Megara.</NOTE>
by which several of the Nobility were
expell'd, the Citizens to unite against their com∣mon
Danger from the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who made
continual Inroads into their Territory, thought
of recalling their Exi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. But some resolv'd
<PB N="302" REF="336"/>
rather than they would consent to that, to de∣liver
up the City to the <HI>Athenians;</HI> who ac∣cordingly
came, but were frustrated in their
Design: However they invested <HI>Nisaea</HI> the
Port-Town, and took it; and hop'd by that
Means to make another more successful At∣tempt
upon the City. <HI>Brasidas</HI> in the mean
while, who was levying Forces for an Expedi∣tion
into <HI>Thrace,</HI> march'd to the Relief of <HI>Me∣gara,</HI>
which kept it self Neuter, 'till either the
<HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> or <HI>Athenians</HI> got the better;
and when the latter declin'd fighting, open'd its
Gates to the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> as Conquerors▪
Upon this the Outlaws were restor'd, having
first taken an Oath not to revive any thing of
past Injuries: But when they had got the Power
into their Hands, they apprehended an hundred
of the Adverse Party, obliging the People to
condemn, and put them to Death: And then
taking the Government upon them, continu'd it
a long time after in the Nature of an <HI>Oligar∣chy.</HI></P>
<P>Things being thus settled in <HI>Megara, Bra∣sidas</HI>
proceeded on his March into <HI>Thrace,</HI> be∣ing
invited to it by the great Assurances he re∣ceiv'd
from <HI>Perdiccas</HI> King of <HI>Macedon,</HI> who
also on his Part began to be very apprehensive
of the Confederacies, the <HI>Athenians</HI> had form'd
in those Quarters. As he took his Way through
<HI>Thessaly,</HI> he was in great Danger of disputing
his Passage, for marching through the Territo∣ries
of those Princes without Leave first ob∣tain'd.
However these Difficulties being pass'd,
several Towns of <HI>Thrace</HI> came over to him up∣on
Promise of their Liberty, and being govern'd
by their own Laws; the chief of which were
<PB N="303" REF="337"/>
<HI>Acanthus, Stagirus,</HI> and <HI>Amphipolis. Thucydi∣des</HI>
the <HI>Historian</HI> march'd to the Relief of the
latter; but coming too late for this, threw him∣self
into <HI>Eion,</HI> which otherwise must have been
taken the next Day. The taking of <HI>Amphipolis</HI>
was of very ill Consequence to the <HI>Athenians;</HI>
for by it they were depriv'd not only of their
Contribution, but also of great Store of Timber
for their Shipping; and thereby a Passage was
open'd to the Invasion of their Consederates.
<HI>Brasidas</HI> finding the Season too far advanc'd,
to push his Conquests in these Parts, spent the
rest of the Winter in fortifying the Places he
had taken, and in Preparations for the taking of
others. He was the chief Man, who put new
Life into the Affairs of the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI>
which before this Expedition were in such
a declining Posture, that they were afraid their
<HI>Helots</HI> would take advantage from the Losses
they had sustain'd abroad, to make some Innolvations
at home: To prevent which they made
Use of a barbarous Stratagem. Proclamation
was made, that as many of them, as could give
a good Account of their Services done to the
State during the War, should be made free:
Upon which two thousand of the most for∣ward
and active,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Two thou∣sand of the</HI> Helots <HI>murder'd.</HI></NOTE> and consequently the most like∣ly
to rebel, put in their Pretensio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and went
with Crowns on their Heads in Procession about
the Temples, in Order to receive their Free∣dom;
but were soon after made away, tho'
after what manner is not recorded. And the
State took this Opportunity of sending seven
hundred more of them with <HI>Brasidas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="338"/>
Whilst these Things were transacting in
<HI>Thrace,</HI> the <HI>Athenians</HI> went with their whole
Strength both of Citizens, and Strangers into
<HI>Boeotia,</HI> being invited thither by a Party of the
<HI>Boeotians</HI> themselves, who were endeavouring to
change their Government into a <HI>Democracy</HI>
after the <HI>Athenian</HI> Model. The <HI>Athenians</HI> for∣tify'd
<HI>Delium</HI> in the Territory of <HI>Tanagra;</HI>
which being a thing contrary to the Custom of
<HI>Greece,</HI> because that Place was sacred to <HI>Apollo,</HI>
the Confederates of the <HI>Boeotians</HI> resented it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fight at</HI> Delium.</NOTE>
and gave them Battel. Whilst both Sides were
engag'd with great Obstinacy, <HI>Pacondas</HI> the
<HI>Theban</HI> General secretly detach'd a Party of
Horse round the Hills▪ which falling unexpect∣edly
upon the Enemies Rear, put the whole <HI>A∣thenian</HI>
Army to Flight, about a thousand of
them being kill'd, with <HI>Hippocrates</HI> their Ge∣neral.
<HI>Delium</HI> being still garrison'd, the <HI>Boeo∣tians</HI>
sate down before it; and after several
fruitless Attempts to recover it, they devis'd an
Engine made of a great Yard of a Ship, bor'd
through, and plated over with Iron at one End;
to which was fix'd a Pot fill'd with Sulphur,
and other combustible Matter. This being ap∣ply'd
to a Part of the Wall, which was cover'd
with dry Vines, the Besiegers blew with a huge
Pair of Bellows through the Bore of the Yard,
and made such a Fire, that it forc'd the Defen∣dants
from the Walls, and made a Breach, by
which the Enemy enter'd the Town, wherein
some were kill'd, and two hundred taken Pri∣soners.</P>
<P>The Extraordinary Success of the <HI>Athenians</HI>
being in some Measure ballanc'd by the Defeats
at <HI>Delium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olym. 89. 2</HI></NOTE> and other Places in the last Cam∣paign,
<PB N="305" REF="339"/>
inclin'd both Parties to an Accommoda∣tion,
at least 'till such Time as they could re∣cruit:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Truce for a Year.</NOTE>
And accordingly they made a Truce
for a Year, in Order to manage a Treaty for a
longer Term. But there being a Contest about
two Towns, <HI>Scione,</HI> and <HI>Menda,</HI> which revol∣ted
to <HI>Brasidas</HI> after the Truce, the <HI>Athenians</HI>
neglecting the War in all other Parts, apply'd
themselves wholly to the reducing of these
Places; the latter of which they took, and
block'd up <HI>Scione.</HI> At which time <HI>Brasidas</HI>
being with <HI>Perdiccas,</HI> who made use of
him to chastise his Neighbours, deserted him
to march to the Relief of these Towns; which
so disgusted <HI>Perdiccas,</HI> that he immediately re∣new'd
his League with <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>The Truce being expir'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 89. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> <HI>Cleon</HI> sail'd with
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Fleet to <HI>Thrace;</HI> where he took
<HI>Torone,</HI> and sent seven hundred Prisoners to
<HI>Athens.</HI> From thence he appear'd before <HI>Am∣phipolis;</HI>
which was so well secur'd by <HI>Brasidas,</HI>
that he was forc'd to decamp. But as he was
ordering his Retreat, the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> sally'd
out, and cut him off,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cleon <HI>and</HI> Brasidas <HI>kill'd.</HI></NOTE> with six hundred of his
Men, with the Loss of only seven of theirhown,
but among them <HI>Brasidas</HI> himself; who liv'd no
longer, than 'till he had News of the Victory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> having receiv'd so many mor∣tifying
Blows one upon the Neck of another,
began to think of Peace in good Earnest To
which the Death of these two Generals did not
a little contribute. For they had hitherto both
oppos'd it, tho' they acted upon quite different
Motives;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cha∣racters.</NOTE> <HI>Cleon</HI> being rash, arrogant, obstinate,
and popular, and rather an Incendiary, than a
Patriot, making Use of the War only as a Cloke
<PB N="306" REF="340"/>
for his ill Practices; whereas <HI>Brasidas</HI> had Cou∣rage,
and Conduct, Moderation, and Integri∣ty;
for which he was complimented by seve∣ral
Cities, which came in to him as the <HI>Delive∣rer
of</HI> Greece. He kept up the sinking Repu∣tation
of his Country, being the only <HI>Spartan</HI>
since <HI>Pausanias,</HI> who appear'd with any esta∣blish'd
Character among the Confederates; and
therefore as one, who seem'd resolv'd to bring
the War to an happy Issue, he was honourably
interr'd, and had Anniversary Games perform'd
in Memory of him. The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> were
glad to treat at this time, while they could do
it with Honour. Besides they had nothing
more at Heart, than the Imprisonment of their
Men taken at <HI>Pylus,</HI> they being the chief of their
City: And among other Considerations, it
was not the least, that the Truce, which they
had made with <HI>Argos</HI> for thirty Years, was just
upon expiring. This was a strong, and flou∣rishing
City; and tho' it was not of it self a
Match for <HI>Sparta,</HI> yet they knew it was far
from being contemptible; and that it held too
good a Correspondence with its Neighbours,
not to make it self capable of giving them a great
deal of Uneasiness. The Matter having been
canvass'd, and debated most part of the Winter,
the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> to bring the Treaty to a
Conclusion, gave out, that they were resolv'd,
as soon as the Season would permit, to fortifie
in <HI>Attica.</HI> Upon which the <HI>Athenians</HI> grew
more moderate in their Demands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Peace concluded for fifty Years.</NOTE> and a Peace
was concluded in the tenth Year of the War
between the two States, and their Confederates
for fifty Years: The chief Articles being, <HI>That
the Garrisons should be evacuated, and the Towns,
<PB N="307" REF="341"/>
and Prisoners restor'd on both Sides.</HI> This was
call'd the <HI>Nician Peace,</HI> because <HI>Nicias,</HI> who
was just the Reverse of his Rival <HI>Cleon,</HI> was
the chief Instrument in it. Besides the tender
Concern he always express'd for his Country,
he had more particular Ends in it, in scuring
his Reputation. For no General had been up∣on
more Expeditions than he, or succeeded
better; but yet he was sensible, he ow'd more
to his good <HI>Genius,</HI> and cautious Management,
than to his Personal Merit. For he was natu∣rally
diffident, and timorous even to a Degree
of Cowardise: But as his good Fortune had hi∣therto
supply'd his want of Courage, and kept
it from being detected, he did not care to
risque what he had already got, for the hopes of
more.</P>
<P>About the beginning of this War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aeschylus, <HI>the Foun∣der of Tra∣gedy.</HI></NOTE> or some

<P>1.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> THERE was one Clause in the late
Treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3584.</NOTE> whereby it was provided,
<HI>That the</HI> Athenians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 89. 4</NOTE> <HI>and</HI> Lacedaemonians <HI>might
alter, or add to it, as they saw Occasion:</HI> Which
look'd so Arbitrary, and Designing, that the
<HI>Boeotians,</HI> and several of the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> Allies
would not sign it. Whereupon <HI>Nicias,</HI> to unite
Athens,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A League offensive, and defen∣sive be∣twixt</HI> A∣thens, <HI>and Sparta.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Sparta</HI> by a closer Tye, and strike
a Terror into those who stood out, prevail'd
with the two States, besides the Peace, to en∣ter
into a League Offensive, and Defensive for
the same Term of fifty Years: Which how∣ever
lasted but between seven and eight of them;
and during that time the War was not intirely
interrupted, because the Treaty was never fairly
put in Execution.</P>
<P>This stuck chiefly upon the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI>
to whom it falling by Lot to make the first Re∣stitution,
<PB N="309" REF="343"/>
they immediately began with that of
Persons, and in Return, receiv'd their Prison∣ers
taken at <HI>Pylus:</HI> And for Places, they en∣deavour'd
it; but the Truth is, they had pro∣mis'd
more than they were able to perform.
They had won more Towns than the <HI>Athe∣nians;</HI>
but then they were not such absolute
Masters of them. For some they had restor'd
to such of their Allies, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom whom the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
had taken them; some, and those the great∣est
Part, they had set at Liberty upon open∣ing
their Gates to them, as their Friends, and
Deliverers: And tho' they found Means of
making Satisfaction for these, by permitting the
<HI>Athenians</HI> to retain others, which they had ta∣ken
during the War; yet there were others,
which they had taken into their Protection,
and which having exasperated the <HI>Athenians</HI> by
revolting, would not endure to hear of being
abandon'd to their old Masters. Of this latter
sort was <HI>Amphipolis,</HI> which would not be as∣sign'd
over, tho' the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> had drawn
out their Garrison, and us'd all the Methods
in order to it, but downright Force; and this
they had promis'd to employ in case of a posi∣tive
Refusal; and by joining with the <HI>Athenians</HI>
to oblige all the Confederates in general to ac∣cept
of the Peace.</P>
<P>But this cold Performance of Articles made
the <HI>Athenians</HI> suspect the Sincerity of their In∣tentions,
and keep what they had in their
Hands: And tho' they maintain'd a sort of
Correspondence, they were so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar from proceed∣ing
with Vigour against the discontented Con∣federates,
that they gave them an Opportunity
of Uniting against them. The first who pub∣lish'd
<PB N="310" REF="344"/>
their Grievances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rest of the Confe∣derates dis∣gusted.</NOTE> were the <HI>Corinthians;</HI>
who turning all their Anger upon the <HI>Lacedae∣monians,</HI>
as being deserted by them, apply'd
themselves to <HI>Argos</HI> their profess'd Enemy,
insinuating, <HI>That their League with</HI> Athens,
<HI>was only a Combination betwixt 'em to enslave
the rest of</HI> Greece. There needed not many
Arguments with the <HI>Argives,</HI> whose Truce be∣ing
expir'd, they expected when the <HI>Lacedae∣monians</HI>
should fall upon them. Besides they
were grown rich, and powerful through a long
Course of Tranquility, and had conceiv'd such
a contemptible Notion of the <HI>Lacedoemonians</HI>
since their Defeat at <HI>Pylus,</HI> and their suing for
Peace, that they thought this a good Oppor∣tunity
of wresting the Sovereignty of <HI>Pelopon∣nesus</HI>
out of their Hands. Accordingly they
deputed twelve of their Citizens with a Com∣mission
at large, to make an Alliance with any
free Cities of <HI>Greece,</HI> but <HI>Athens,</HI> and <HI>Sparta.</HI>
The Gates of <HI>Argos</HI> being open to all the rest,
the first that led the Way, was <HI>Mantinea</HI> of
<HI>Arcadia,</HI> which had lately thrown off its
Dependance upon <HI>Sparta;</HI> and this City was
followed by several others of <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI> The
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> perceiving the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to be
at the bottom of all these Proceedings, sent
their Ambassadors to put a Stop to them. Who
after many Remonstrances, charg'd them with
Perjury, in case they forsook the Alliance, or
did not accept the Treaty upon the Foot it
was settled, since it was agreed between 'em,
<HI>That what was concluded by a Majority, should
be binding to all.</HI> The <HI>Corinthians</HI> turn'd their
own Arguments of Reason and Religion upon
them, alledging, <HI>That they had not perform'd
<PB N="311" REF="345"/>
the Conditions of the Treaty, in not providing bet∣ter
for the Restitution of the Places, they had
lost: That they could not desort their Confede∣rates
in</HI> Thrace, <HI>without manifest Breach of a
former Oath, which they had taken to protect
them; and that as for their League with</HI> Argos,
<HI>they should follow Justice, and the Advice of
their Friends.</HI> Thus having dismiss'd the Am∣bassadors,
they not only enter'd themselves in∣to
Alliance with <HI>Argos,</HI> but endeavour'd to
bring in several other States, and practis'd more
particularly with the <HI>Thebans,</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <HI>Megareans;</HI>
But the different Forms of Government us'd
in <HI>Thebes,</HI> and <HI>Argos,</HI> made them incline rather
to <HI>Sparta.</HI> Thus was most part of this Year
spent in Conferences, and Negotiations on all
Sides, in breaking and renewing Treaties
and Alliances, without concluding any thing
effectually. In the mean while <HI>Athens</HI> and
<HI>Sparta</HI> were in a manner left to themselves, be∣ing
equally jealous of their Neighbours, and
dissatisfy'd with each other. The <HI>Athenians</HI>
finding the <HI>Lacedoemonians</HI> more particularly
unea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about <HI>Pylus,</HI> which was still in their
Hands, intimated to them, that they should
be repossess'd of it, provided the <HI>Boeotians</HI> would
restore <HI>Panactum</HI> to them. Yet the <HI>Boeotians</HI>
refus'd to part with it, unless the <HI>Lacedaemo∣nians</HI>
would make a private League with them:
Which they did, tho' they knew it was ex∣presly
contrary to that, which they had rati∣fy'd
with the <HI>Athenians;</HI> wherein it was provi∣ded,
<HI>That no Treaty should be made without
the joint Consent of them both.</HI> But the <HI>Boeo∣tians,</HI>
notwithstanding their Agreement, demo∣lish'd
<HI>Panactum,</HI> alledging for their Excuse,
that as it stood upon the Confines of <HI>Attica</HI>
<PB N="312" REF="346"/>
and <HI>Boeotia,</HI> it was formerly agreed, that it
should not be held by either in particular, but
in common to both.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> having broke one Arti∣cle
of their Treaty with the <HI>Athenians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 90. 1</NOTE> to en∣able
them to perform another, were shame∣fully
disappointed of their hopes in the <HI>The∣bans</HI>
about the business of <HI>Panactum:</HI> And all
they had to salve the Matter at <HI>Athens,</HI> was,
<HI>That the Place was not now in a Condition of har∣bouring
any Enemies to the State.</HI> But the <HI>A∣thenians</HI>
resented it extreamly, as not imagining
but what was done, was at least with their
Consent, if not at their Instigation. They
told 'em plainly, <HI>They had broke the three most
material Articles of the Peace, in entering into a
separate League with the</HI> Boeotians; <HI>in demolish∣ing
a, Town they ought to have restor'd; and
lastly, in not forcing their Dependants to make
good the rest of the Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>When things were thus far advanc'd to∣wards
Alcibiades, a Rupture, they were easily aggravated
both by the present <HI>Ephori</HI> at <HI>Sparta,</HI> who were
more inclinable to the War, as also by several
of the leading Men at <HI>Athens. Nicias</HI> indeed
was employ'd as a Mediator on both Sides;
but was violently oppos'd by <HI>Alcibiades,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Rise and Cha∣recter of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> who

arriv'd. He was naturally subject: to
great Excesscs of Passion in all kinds; but the
<PB N="313" REF="347"/>
most prevailing was his Ambition: In the Pur∣suit
of which he appear'd bold and generous,
and yet somewhat turbulent, and perverse. Of
which we may form an Idea, from an Instance
of his Childhood: For as he was playing in
the Street, a Cart happen'd to come by; and
being very intent upon his Sport, he bid the
Driver stop: When he sound he could not have
his Will of the Fellow, but that he still came
on, he throws himself along just in the Road,
<HI>Now,</HI> says he, <HI>drive on.</HI> His way of living
was not only loose and effeminate, but riotous
even to Debauchery, and a Contempt of Re∣ligion,
and the Laws. Not but he could put
a Restraint upon himself when his Interest re∣quir'd
it; and was such a Master of Disguise,
that he could conform himself to any Fashion,
or Country. In <HI>Ionia,</HI> he was luxurious, fro∣lick,
and lazy; in <HI>Thrace,</HI> he was always drink∣ing,
or on Horse-back; and when he was with
<HI>Persias,</HI> he exceeded them in Pomp, and Mag∣nificence.
He could comply with the feverest
Discipline, and the strictest Virtue; insomuch
that even at <HI>Sparta</HI> he was admir'd, as one la∣borious,
frugal, and reserv'd; and it is remark∣able,
that of all his Friends, none was more inti∣mate
with him than <HI>Socrates.</HI> So that it is not so
much from the Inequality of his Manners, as
from the different Appearances of them, that
Men have form'd so many different Judgments
of him. But whatever his Vices were, he was
a Man of prodigious Parts, Subtilty, and Ad∣dress,
and had so many Ways of recommend∣ing
himself, that he appear'd to a greater Ad∣vantage,
than several others, who acted upon
more solid and steady Principles. His Noble
<PB N="314" REF="348"/>
Birth, and the Glory of his Ancestors; his
Riches, which he employ'd in Donatives, pub∣lick
Shews, and all sorts of Munificence; the
Force of his Eloquence, wherein he was easily
second to <HI>Pericles;</HI> the Beauty of his Person
even to Loveliness, join'd with his extraordi∣nary
Courage, and Application to Military Af∣fairs,
as they procur'd him a numerous Train
of Friends, and Dependants, so they prevail'd
with the People in general, to indulge, and give
the softest Names to his Excesses: So that
what would have been criminal in others, pass'd
in him only for the Starts, and Sallies of Youth,
and the Effects of good Nature. In short, he
had a Charm for every one he convers'd with;
and those who abhorr'd his <HI>Practices,</HI> at the
same time doted on the <HI>Man.</HI> His first Expe∣dition
was against <HI>Potidaea;</HI> where being woun∣ded,
and hard press'd by the Enemy, <HI>Socrates</HI>
threw himself before him, and rescu'd him:
And he afterwards did athe same for <HI>Socrates</HI> at
the Battel of <HI>Delium.</HI> Having got some Re∣putation
in the Army, he was immediately fur∣rounded
with a Croud of Flatterers; and as
his Vanity all along kept Pace with his Am∣bition,
he was easily persuaded, that as soon as
he concern'd himself in publick Affairs, he
should not only eclipse the rest of the Gene∣rals,
and Statesmen, but exceed the Authority,
and Reputation of <HI>Pericles</HI> himself. And in∣deed
he soon order'd it so, that he had none
but <HI>Nicias,</HI> and <HI>Phoeax</HI> to grapple with; the
former of which being the older Man, and of
a more settled Interesr, and Character, especi∣ally
with those who were weary of the War,
<PB N="315" REF="349"/>
he thought, if he could any ways undermine
him, he should have little more to do.</P>
<P>With this Design he had all along oppos'd
the Peace: And observing now, that the <HI>Ar∣gives</HI>
sought for Protection against the <HI>Lacedae∣monians,</HI>
he gave them a secret Assurance of a
League Offensive and Defensive with <HI>Athens:</HI>
And transacting as well in Person, as by Let∣ters
with those, who had most Authority a∣mongst
the People, he encourag'd them <HI>to be
under no manner of Apprehensions from</HI> Spar∣ta,
<HI>but to apply themselves wholly to the</HI> A∣thenians,
<HI>who, if they would expect but a lit∣tle
while, would repent of the Peace, and soon
put an End to it.</HI> Accordingly he laid hold
of this Juncture, and improv'd the Handle the
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> had given, to exasperate the Peo∣ple
both against them, and <HI>Nicias.</HI> Which
had so good an Effect:, that every thing seemed
dispos'd for a Treaty with <HI>Argos:</HI> Of which
the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> being very apprehensive, im∣mediately
dispatch'd their Ambassadors to <HI>A∣thens;</HI>
who at first said what seem'd very satis∣factory,
<HI>That they came with full Power to con∣cert
all Matters in Difference upon equal Terms.</HI>
The Council receiv'd their Proposrtions, and
the People was to assemble the next Day, to
give them Audience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Stra∣tagem to oppose the Peace.</NOTE> <HI>Alcibiades</HI> in the mean
while fearing, lest this Negotiation would ruin
his Designs, has a secret Conference with the
Ambassadors, and persuades them under a Co∣lour
of Friendship, not to let the People know
at first, what full Powers their Commission
gave them; but to intimate, <HI>That they came
only to treat and make Proposals;</HI> for that o∣therwise,
they would grow insolent in their
<PB N="316" REF="350"/>
Demands, and extort from them such unreaso∣nable
Terms, as they could not with Honour
consent to. They were so well satisfy'd of
the Prudence, and Sincerity of this Advice,
that he drew them from <HI>Nicias,</HI> to rely intire∣ly
upon himself: And the next Day, when the
People were assembled, and the Ambassadors
introduc'd, <HI>Alcibiades</HI> with a very obliging Air
demanded of them, <HI>With what Powers they
were come?</HI> They made Answer, <HI>That they were
not come as Plenipotentiaries.</HI> Upon which he
instantly chang'd his Voice, and Countenance,
and exclaiming against them as notorious Liars,
bid the People <HI>take Care, how they transacted
any thing with Men, on whom they could have
so little Dependence.</HI> The People dismiss'd the
Ambassadors in a Rage; and <HI>Nicias</HI> knowing
nothing of the Deceit, was confounded, and in
Disgrace. To redeem his Credit, he propos'd
being sent once more to <HI>Sparta:</HI> But not being
able to gain such Terms there, as the <HI>Atheni∣ans</HI>
demanded, they immediately upon his Re∣turn,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A League between</HI> A∣thens <HI>and</HI> Argos.</NOTE>
struck up a League with the <HI>Argives</HI> for
an Hundred Years, including the <HI>Eleaus,</HI> and
<HI>Mantineans;</HI> which yet did not in Terms can∣cel
that with the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> tho' it is plain,
that the whole Intent of it was levell'd against
them.</P>
<P>II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 90. 2 Alcibiades <HI>declar'd General.</HI></NOTE> Upon this new Alliance, <HI>Alcibiades</HI> was
declar'd General; and tho' his best Friends
could not commend the Method, by which he
effected all this; yet it was look'd upon as a
great Reach in the Politicks, thus to divide,
and shake almost all <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and to remove
the War so far from the <HI>Athenian</HI> Frontier, that
<PB N="317" REF="351"/>
even Success would profit the Enemy but lit∣tle,
should they be Conquerors, whereas if
they were defeated, <HI>Sparta</HI> it self was hardly
safe. The chief Business of this Year, was a
War between the <HI>Argives</HI> and <HI>Epidaurians,</HI> be∣gun
upon a slight Pretence, that the Latter had
refus'd to send a Victim to <HI>Apollo Pythius,</HI>
whose Temple belong'd chiefly to the Care of
the <HI>Argives:</HI> But the true Design was to se∣cure
themselves on that Side from the <HI>Corin∣thians.</HI>
Accordingly they made several Incur∣sions
into their Territories, but without any
considerable Action: And <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> who
march'd to their Assistance, having done little
more than shewn himself in <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> re∣turn'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> had of late made very
saint Efforts to recover their Authority:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 90. 3</NOTE> But
finding many of their Confederates already
gone off, and the rest wavering, resolv'd to re∣medy
the Evil, before it spread too far; and
drawing out their whole Force both of Citi∣zens
and Slaves, were join'd by their Allies,
and encamp'd almost under the Walls of <HI>Ar∣gos.</HI>
The <HI>Argives</HI> having Notice of their
March, made all possible Preparations, and came
out with a full Resolution to fight them. But
just as they were going to engage, two of
their Officers went over to <HI>Agis</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI>
King and General, and propos'd to him to have
the Business made up by a Reference. He im∣mediately
closing with the Offer, in Order to
it granted them a Truce for four Months, and
drew off his Army, the whole Affair being in
a manner transacted by these three, without
any general Consent, or Knowledge on either
<PB N="318" REF="352"/>
Side. The <HI>Peloponnesians,</HI> tho' they durst not
disobey their Orders, inveigh'd grievously a∣gainst
<HI>Agis,</HI> for letting such an Advantage slip,
as they could never promise to themselves a∣gain:
For they had actually hemm'd in the Enemy,
and that with the best, if not the great∣est
Army, that ever was brought into the Field. And the
<HI>Argives</HI> were so little appre∣hensive
of Danger on their Side, that they were
no less incens'd against their Mediators;
one of whom they forc'd to the Altars to save
his Life, and confiscated his Goods.</P>
<P>Afterwards the <HI>Athenians</HI> came with con∣siderable
Recruits, and persuaded the <HI>Argives</HI>
to break the Truce, telling them, <HI>It was not
good, because made without the Privity of their
Confederates.</HI> Upon that they besieg'd <HI>Orcho∣mentts</HI>
in <HI>Arcadia,</HI> and took it: At which the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>
were so enrag'd, that imputing
it all to <HI>Agis,</HI> they resolv'd to pull down his
House, and Fine him; but upon his Promise to
do something, that should sufficiently clear his
Conduct, they forbore; yet would not suf∣fer
him to take the Field again, without assigning
him ten of their Citizens, as Council. An
Occasion was soon offer'd to wipe off this Stain,
by marching to the Relief of <HI>Tegea.</HI> In the
Territory of <HI>Mantinea</HI> he gave the <HI>Argives</HI>
Battel:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Battel at</HI> Manti∣nea, <HI>be∣tween the</HI> Lacedae∣monians, <HI>and</HI> Ar∣gives.</NOTE> And tho' his right Wing was press'd,
the main Battel, where he himself commanded
forc'd the Enemy to give Ground; and having
by that means got an Opportunity of relieving
the rest, he obtain'd a memorable Victory;
which yet might have been more compleat,
if he would have made the most of it: But it
being against the <HI>Spartan</HI> Discipline to continue
<PB N="319" REF="353"/>
the Pursuit long, he contented himself with
being Master of the Field. However there
fell eleven hundred of the Enemy, and
only three hundred <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> with
some few of their Confederates. <HI>Agis</HI> by this
Battel redeem'd both his own, and his Coun∣try's
Honour, so far at least, that those Mis∣carriages,
which had pass'd for Cowardise, or
Mismanagement, were now generally ascrib'd
to Fortune. Upon this, the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>
took the Field again this Year; but rather than
venture another Battel, chose to treat with <HI>Ar∣gos;</HI>
which presently concluded with them
first a Peace, and then a League, thereby ex∣cluding
all its Allies but <HI>Mantinea,</HI> which by
reason of its Situation between them both, was
oblig'd to declare for <HI>Sparta.</HI> That which fa∣cilitated
the Treaty, was a Design of some of
the <HI>Argives,</HI> to introduce an <HI>Oligarchy;</HI> which
by the Assistance of the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> they
establish'd after their Model; and the same
Change was effected at <HI>Sicyon.</HI></P>
<P>But in a few Months after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 90. 4</NOTE> the Commons
at <HI>Argos</HI> took up Arms, and having gain'd some
Advantage, <HI>Alcibiades</HI> came in to their Aid,
and not only restor'd the <HI>Democracy,</HI> but made
them renew their League with <HI>Athens.</HI> He per∣suaded
them further to join their City to the
Sea by long Walls, that so he might upon all
Occasions relieve them; which were no sooner
perfected, but the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> came with an
Army, and demolish'd them.</P>
<P>This Summer <HI>Alcibiades</HI> to keep <HI>Argos</HI> firm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym 91. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>
went thither with twenty Gallics; and appre∣hending
about three hundred of those, who
were most suspected to be in the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI>
<PB N="320" REF="354"/>
Interest, dispers'd them in the neighbouring
Islands.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Affairs at</HI> Melos.</NOTE> Aster which the <HI>Athenians</HI> resolving,
that <HI>Melos</HI> should acknowledge their Sove∣reignty,
as the rest of the Islands did, went
with a Fleet against it; and at their Arrival
sent their Deputies to expostulate. The <HI>Me∣lians</HI>
told them in a long Conference, <HI>That
whilst they had any Hopes left, it could not be
expected, they should throw up that Liberty,
which' they had maintain'd so successfully for se∣ven
hundred Years: That the two disputable
Points in War, were Fortune, and Power; for
the first of which, they could depend upon the
Justice of their Cause, to keep the Gods on their
Side; and as for human Assistance, that as they
were a Colony and Confederate of the</HI> Lacedae∣monians,
<HI>they had good Reason to expect it of
them from a double Tye of Honour, and Consan∣guinity:
That however, if not to molest the</HI> A∣thenians,
<HI>would answer their Purpose, they were
content to stand Neuter.</HI> This they insinuated
in so artful, and submissive a Manner; and yet
with something so noble and ingenuous, that
they kept up to the Character of Men, who
were willing to preserve their Lives, provided
it were not at the Expence of their Honour,
and Liberty, and who knew how to employ
their Reason well, when their Sword had fail'd
them. The Answer of the <HI>Athenians</HI> was full
of Insolence, and Contempt, <HI>That they did not
come to enter into a long Detail, or to Debate, so
as to put themselves upon an equal Foot with
them: That they could lose no Honour by sub∣mitting
to such a Power as theirs: That they
saw the Danger was at Hand; and the only
Question was, Whether, they would be preserv'd
<PB N="321" REF="355"/>
or not.</HI> However to give some Colour to their
Proceedings, they intimated a Right of Sove∣reignty
over them, which they deriv'd from the
time of the <HI>Persian</HI> Wars. Then they ridicul'd
the Vanity of their Hopes in depending upon
the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> telling them, <HI>That what∣ever
Generosity their Coustitution oblig'd them to
express, it was generally confin'd to themselves;
for that in respect of others, Honour and Justice
were but other Names for Will, and Interetst;
and that this was no where more a Maxim,
than at</HI> Sparta: <HI>That supposing them never so
well inclin'd to relieve them, yet it was not in
their Power, whilst the</HI> Athenians <HI>were Masters
at Sea: And that in short, since they would not
embrace this only Opportunity of preventing their
Ruin, they must expect the Consequence.</HI> After
this fruitless Intercourse, the <HI>Athenians</HI> began
their Works, and were interrupted by two suc∣cessful
Sallies of the <HI>Melians.</HI> But in the Win∣ter,
upon the Arrival of Recruits from <HI>Athens,</HI>
they surrender'd at Discretion; the Men were
put to the Sword, the Women and Children
made Slaves, and the Place repcopled by a Co∣lony
of five hundred <HI>Athenians. Peloponnesus</HI>
was generally quiet this Year: But the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI>
who lay in <HI>Pylus,</HI> infested <HI>Laconia,</HI> and
carry'd in a great deal of Booty; with the <HI>I a∣cedaemonians</HI>
did not care to resent as a manifest
Breach of the Peace, but only gave Leave in
general to any of their People, to make Repri∣sals
in <HI>Attica.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this little Respite from open War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 91. 2 <HI>Affairs <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Sicily.</NOTE> the <HI>Athenians</HI>
turn'd their Thoughts again upon <HI>Si∣cily,</HI>
having the last Year entertain'd Ambassa∣dors
from <HI>Egesta,</HI> who demanded their Assist∣ance
<PB N="322" REF="356"/>
against the <HI>Selinuntians,</HI> and <HI>Syracusians.</HI>
They promis'd large Supplies of Mony for car∣rying
on the War; and represented, that <HI>A∣thens</HI>
was particularly interested in the Quarrel,
least <HI>Syracuse</HI> growing absolute at home, should
join with the <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> against it. The <HI>A∣thenians</HI>
readily embrac'd so plausible an handle,
as the aiding their Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ederates: But <HI>Alcibi∣ades</HI>
was the Man, who inflam'd this Desire of
theirs to the heighth, and prevail'd with them no
longer to proceed secretly in their Design, and
by Degrees, but to set out a great Fleet, and
undertake at once to make themselves Masters
of the Island. To this purpose he possess'd the
People with great hopes, whilst he himself en∣tertain'd
much greater; so that the Conquest of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> which was the utmost Bound of their
Ambition, was but the Beginning of his. For
he dreamt of nothing less than the Conquest of
<HI>Carthage,</HI> and <HI>Lybia;</HI> and by the Accession of
these, fancy'd himself already Matter of <HI>Italy,</HI>
and <HI>Peloponnesus;</HI> and seem'd to look upon
<HI>Sicily,</HI> as little more than a Magazine for the
War. The wifer Sort made a Jest of this Ex∣pedition,
but durst not declare their Opinion
freely, because they sound the bulk of the Peo∣ple
so taken up with the Thoughts of it, that
you might see them, Old and Young, forming
themselves into Companies, some drawing the
Figure of <HI>Sicily,</HI> others making Charts and de∣scribing
the Seas, Harbours, and Places which
this Isle shews opposite to the <HI>African</HI> Shore.</P>
<P>Accordingly they decreed a War under the
Conduct of <HI>Alcibiades, Nicias,</HI> and <HI>Lamachus,</HI>
thinking to temper rhe Heat of the first, with
the Caution, and Experience of the others.
<PB N="323" REF="357"/>
But <HI>Nicias</HI> would have declin'd the Command,
by opposing the thing in general, as no less
difficult in it self, than ill-tim'd in respect of
the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> who only wanted such an
Opportunity, to repair their Losses and Dis∣grace.
He also inveigh'd against <HI>Alcibiades,</HI>
as too young and rash for such an Enterprise,
and insinuated, <HI>That his chief Aim in promo∣ting
it, was to support his own Grandeur and
Luxury, at the Expence and Danger of the Pub∣lick.
Alcibiades</HI> urg'd on the contrary, <HI>That
they had nothing to fear from the</HI> Lacedaemoni∣ans,
<HI>who were brought so low, that he had lately
oblig'd them to stake their</HI> All <HI>upon the Fortune
of one Day at</HI> Mantinea. <HI>Then for active, and
turbulent Spirits, such as were the</HI> Athenians,
<HI>that it was always thought necessary to keep them
up to their Discipline, and that they could be no
where more profitably employ'd, than against such
States, as they had reason to suspect would be
their Enemies, and whom in common Policy they
ought to begin with first. That therefore the Ob∣stinacy
of</HI> Nicias <HI>in opposing it, tended only to
Sloth, and Sedition. Nicias</HI> had no Way left to
deter the People from this Enterprise, but by
laying before them the great Preparations it
would require: But to obviate all Objections
of this kind, they declar'd the three Generals
absolute, to regulate every thing both at
home and abroad, in the manner they should
judge most conducive to the Advantage of the
State.</P>
<P>There being no further room for a Debate,
a great Fleet was rigg'd out of above an hun∣dred
and thirty Sail, with five thousand
and one hundred Soldiers, and other necessary Pro∣visions
<PB N="324" REF="358"/>
visions of all kinds, and every way compleat.
But just as they were putting to Sea, it hap∣pen'd
that most of the Images of <HI>Mercury</HI>
throughout the whole City were defac'd and
broken: Which being look'd upon as ominous
to the Expedition, and suppos'd to be done by
some who were ill-affected to the <HI>Democracy,</HI>
great Rewards were propos'd to any that would
discover the Authors; and after a strict Enqui∣ry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcibiades <HI>accus'd of breaking the Images of</HI> Mer∣cury.</NOTE>
<HI>Alcibiades</HI> was accus'd. The People were
violently incens'd against him▪ But they
thought fit to let him go on with the <HI>Sicilian</HI>
Voyage, and if there appear'd any Matters a∣gainst
him, to call him to an Account after∣wards;
tho' he proffer'd to take his Trial im∣mediately
upon it, and urg'd it as a very pre∣posterous
thing, <HI>To send a Man, who was
thought obnoxious to the State, with such a Force
under his Command, and not to give him an Op∣portunity
of purging himself.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Fleet met at <HI>Corcyra,</HI> and from
thence parted for <HI>Sicily;</HI> but the Generals were
divided in their Opinions, as to the Place where
they should make a Descent; <HI>Lamachus</HI> was
for making directly to <HI>Syracuse</HI> the Capital:
He urg'd, <HI>That it was as yet unprovided, and
under the greatest Consternation; that an Army
was always most terrible at the first, before the
Enemy had time to recollect their Spirits, and
make the Danger familiar to them.</HI> But the
others Reasons taking Place, it was agreed to
reduce the lesser Cities first; and having de∣rach'd
ten Gallics only to take a View of the Si∣tuation
and Harbour of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> they landed
with the rest of their Forces, and surpris'd
<HI>Catana.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="359"/>
After which <HI>Alcibiades</HI> was sent for home
in order to abide his Trial.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is sent for home to take his Trial.</HI></NOTE> For his Enemies
had taken Occasion from his Absence to attack
him more fiercely, and openly; they had drawn
up, and aggravated the Information against him,
and inferr'd his Guilt as to the Business of the
<HI>Mercury</HI>'s, from his riotous way of Living, and
his having prophan'd the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of <HI>Ceres</HI>
and <HI>Proserpine,</HI> at a drunken Meeting, in which
piece of Mockery he acted the <HI>Chief Priest.</HI>
The Charge fell very heavy upon his Friends
and Acquaintance at <HI>Athens;</HI> and being appre∣hensive
that he should meet with the same
Treatment, he Fled to <HI>Sparta,</HI> having first de∣sir'd
Letters of safe Conduct, and assur'd
them, <HI>That he would make them amends by his
future Services, for all the Mischief he had done
them, whilst he was their Enemy.</HI> As he was
making his Escape, one, who knew him, ask'd
him, <HI>If he durst not trust his native Country?
Yes,</HI> says he, <HI>I dare trust her for all other
things; but when the Matter concerns my Life,
I will not trust my Mother, least she should by
Mistake throw in a black Bean instead of a white
one.</HI> When afterwards he was told, that the
Assembly had pronounc'd Judgment of Death
against him, all he said was, <HI>I will make them
sensible, that I am yet alive.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sicily</HI> in the mean while began to take the
Alarm; and towards the Winter there hap∣pen'd
an Action, wherein the <HI>Athenians</HI> having
drawn the <HI>Syracusians</HI> out of the Town, kill'd
about two hundred and sixty of them and their
ConFederates with the Loss of but fifty of
their own Men. After which they took up
their Winter Quarters at <HI>Catana,</HI> and <HI>Naxus;</HI>
<PB N="326" REF="360"/>
and <HI>Syracuse</HI> sent to sollicit the Assistance of
<HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Sparta;</HI> the former of which easily
consented to it, and the <HI>Spartans</HI> were work'd
up to it by <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> who also encourag'd
them to renew the War at home, and fortifie
in <HI>Attica.</HI></P>
<P>The next Year the <HI>Athenians</HI> with their

wherein the latter being assisted by
thirty <HI>Athenian</HI> Gallies, gave Occasion to a
manifest Breach of the Treaty between <HI>Athens</HI>
and <HI>Sparta.</HI> The same Rancour and Jealousie
had continu'd betwixt the two States ever since
the first Conclusion of it; and as the Matters
in Difference had never been fairly adjusted,
it was not properly an Intermission of the War,
tho' it was carry'd on more secretly, and indi∣retly.
The <HI>Athenians</HI> had given the most
Handles for having the War openly renew'd,
which the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> did not think fit to
accept, as such; and the reason why they laid
hold of this, seems not to have been so much
in regard to the Advice of <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> who they
knew had a personal Pique to his Countrymen,
as to the present Juncture of Affairs, when
<PB N="327" REF="361"/>
they found them so deeply embroil'd in the
War of <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 91. 4 <HI>The</HI> Lace∣daemonians <HI>fortisie in</HI> Attica.</NOTE> The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> in pursuance to their
Resolutions taken last Year, enter'd <HI>Attica,</HI> and
fortify'd <HI>Decelea</HI> a Town of great Importance
about a hundred and twenty Furlongs from <HI>A∣thens.</HI>
At the same time the Affairs of the
<HI>Athenians</HI> had a very indifferent Aspect before
<HI>Syracuse:</HI> Where after an Engagement with the
Enemy in their great Haven with various Suc∣cess,
<HI>Gylippus</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> surpriz'd <HI>Plemmyri∣um,</HI>
which commanded rhe Port. Herein the
<HI>Athenians</HI> lost a great Sum of Mony, and their
Naval Stores, and could not be supply'd with
more, but by forcing their Way through the
Enemy, who at Anchor under the Fort.
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Eurymedon</HI> at last arriv'd with se∣venty
three Sail, and five thousand Soldiers, who
with the glittering of their Armour, the Flags
and Streamers waving in the Air from the Gal∣lies,
and variety of Musick, appear'd with all
the Pomp and Terror of a victorious Navy.
They resolv'd immediately upon their Arrival
to atrack <HI>Syracuse;</HI> and in the Night set upon
a part of the City, call'd <HI>Epipolae,</HI> but after a
confus'd and dubious Skirmish, were repuls'd.
<HI>Demosthenes,</HI> who had advis'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Fight, was
now for quitting the Island; and <HI>Nicias,</HI> who
had been most averse to it, was for carrying
on the Sieg, for fear of being call'd to ac∣count,
as his Predecessors were for consenting
to a Peace in the former Invasion of <HI>Sicily.</HI>
Besides he thought his Army in a better Con∣dition
than the <HI>Syracusian,</HI> which was almost
exhausted by the War, and depended chiefly
<PB N="328" REF="362"/>
on Mercenaries, who would desert when Pay
sail'd. Another Motive was, that he had hopes
from a Party within the Town, of having it be∣tray'd
to him. But upon the News of <HI>Gylip∣pus</HI>'s
coming with Recruits from most Parts of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> he was prevail'd upon to decamp; And
just as he was ordering his Retreat with all
Expedition and Secrecy, there happen'd an E∣clipse
of the Moon; which was look'd upon
as very ominous, and so s;uperstitiously observ'd
by him, and the other Generals, that they re∣s;olv'd
to stay twenty seven Days longer, which
was the time appointed by the Soothsayers. In
the mean while <HI>Nicias</HI> being intent upon his
Sacrifices, the <HI>Syracusians</HI> advanc'd with their
Infantry, and Gallies, and the very Boys row'd
about in Cock-boats, insulting them, and pro∣voking
them to fight.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Fight be∣fore</HI> Syra∣cuse.</NOTE> Whereupon a very
sharp Engagement ensu'd in the great Haven,
wherein <HI>Eurymedon,</HI> and many others were slain.
After which the <HI>Syracnsians,</HI> to make it a com∣pleat
Victory, drew up a Line of Gallies, and
with them block'd up the Mouth of the Port,
which was eight Furlongs over. The <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
finding no way left, but to break through
the <HI>Syracusian</HI> Fleet, resolv'd to try their For∣tune
once more;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Another.</HI></NOTE> and another Fight <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsu'd with
the greatest Number of Ships, and the most
Skill and Discipline on both Sides, but with
the greatest. Heat and Obstinacy, of any that had
yet happened. The Victory at last inclin'd to
the <HI>Syracusians;</HI> and tho' in this Action they
had lost almost an equal number of Vessels,
yet the <HI>Athenians</HI> were so disabled, and their
Seamen so dejected, that they could not be
persuaded to go on board again, tho' they
<PB N="329" REF="363"/>
had still more Ships fit for Service, than the
Enemy.</P>
<P>In this Extremity they could propose nothing
but to march away by Land, and accordingly
prepar'd to dislodge the same Night. <HI>Hermo∣crates</HI>
the <HI>Sicilian</HI> General suspecting their De∣sign,
propos'd the sending of Forces to pos∣sess
all the difficult Passes, and cut off their
Retreat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Athenians <HI>de camp, and are pursu'd with great Slaughter;</HI></NOTE> But the Soldiers were so transported
with their Success, and at the same time celebrating
a Feast in honour of <HI>Hercules,</HI> were so
taken up with drinking, and other Diversions,
that they could by no means be prevail'd with
to pursue the Victory. Upon which he sent
some to the <HI>Athenian</HI> Camp, to inform them as
from a Party of their Friends in <HI>Syracuse, That
the Enemy had lin'd all the Ways, in order to
cut them off in their March.</HI> This Stratagem ob∣tain'd
Credit with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and they staid
three Days longer, in which time <HI>Gylippus</HI> had
actually prepar'd to hinder their Retreat. They
lest their Ships to the Enemy, and broke up
in the Night with all the Horror and Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣sion
imaginable; and being divided into two
Bodies, <HI>Demosthenes</HI> was press'd in the Rear,
and after a short Dispute surrender'd with his
part of the Army, upon promise of their Lives.
<HI>Nicias</HI> insisted upon better Terms, and refus'd
to submit; 'till being at last over-power'd, he
yielded himself up to the Mercy of <HI>Gylippus,</HI>
who had a great desire to have sav'd him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nicia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>kill'd.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>Hermocrates</HI> also seem'd to be of his Opinion,
by saying, <HI>That it was better to use a Victory
well, than to gain one.</HI> But being overcome by
the Importunity of the Army, he was forc'd
to kill him. <HI>Thucydides</HI> says in general of him,
<PB N="330" REF="364"/>
<HI>That he least deserv'd this severe Treatment of
any Man in his time:</HI> Tho' by the Accounts
we have of him, his Piety, Caution and Ex∣perience
make up the best part of his Chara∣cter.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> De∣mosthenes.</NOTE>
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> underwent the same Fate;
tho' some say, that both the Generals unwil∣ling
to survive this Disgrace, kill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d themselves.
The whole Number of those, who decamp'd
from <HI>stracutse,</HI> amounted to no less than forty
thousand, of whom the greatest part were
kill'd, and dispers'd, and seven thousand were
taken Prisoners, and condemn'd to the Quarries;
where they were us'd with great hardship for
seventy Days, and were afterwards most of
them sold as Slaves.</P>
<P>Such was the Event of the Siege of <HI>Syracuse;</HI>
which the <HI>Athenians</HI> had prosecuted with so
much Vigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The End of the</HI> Sicilian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> that they had drain'd their City of
Men and Money; and were therefore reproach'd
<HI>with having pour'd all</HI> Athens <HI>into</HI> Sicily. But
the Rashness of the Enterprise was severely punish'd
in the Loss of their best Generals, Fleets,
and Armies; all of them being destroy'd, or
left at the Mercy of those, whom they had so
unseasonably undertaken to subdue. And the
Loss was still much greater in regard to the In∣fluence
it afterwards had on their Affairs at
home. This put an End to he <HI>Sicilian</HI> War,
which is to be consider'd chiefly with refe∣rence
to the <HI>Peloponnesian:</HI> And as it was car∣ry'd
on by most of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Confederates, it
was properly a Continuation of it, tho' the
<HI>Athenians</HI> by their restless Ambition had re∣mov'd
the Seat of it, and drew into the Quarrel
new Enemies, who were of themselves almost
a Match for them at Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="365"/>
The News of this Defeat was not easily cre∣dited
at <HI>Athens;</HI> but being at last convinc'd of
the Truth, they were under the greatest Con∣sternation,
and exclaim'd against their Prophets,
and Priests, who by a Religious Pretext had
footh'd them with hopes of conquering <HI>Sicily,</HI>
and betray'd them into all these Miserics. How∣ever
they resolv'd not to sink under them, but
to equip a Fleet, in order to support their Al∣lies,
who began now to think of throwing off
their Yoke: And even those who had stood
Neuter, took this occasion to declare against
them. But the <HI>Lacedoemonians</HI> being more par∣ticularly
elevated, resolv'd to prosecute the
War with Vigour; and the Winter was spent in
Preparations on both Sides.</P>
<P>This Year by the Management of <HI>Alcibiades</HI> a
League was concluded between the King of <HI>Per∣ssia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 92. 1 <HI>A League between the</HI> Lacedae∣monians, <HI>and the</HI> Persian.</NOTE> and the <HI>Lacedaemonians;</HI> and the principal Ci∣ties
of <HI>Ionia</HI> revolted from <HI>Athens.</HI> It was at
this time, that the thousand Talents, which the
<HI>Athenians</HI> had set apart for Cases of Extremi∣ty,
was employ'd in Shipping, and other Pro∣visions.
The <HI>Athenians</HI> chas'd twenty <HI>Pelopon∣nesian</HI>
Ships into the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> and block'd them
up; but the latter watching their Opportunity
forc'd their Passage, and took sour of the <HI>Athe∣nians.</HI>
Upon a Descent of the <HI>Athenians</HI> near
<HI>Panormus</HI> in the <HI>Milesian</HI> Territories, a Fight
ensu'd, in which <HI>Chalcideus</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> Com∣mander
was kill'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcbiades <HI>suspected at</HI> Sparta.</NOTE> This Action render'd <HI>Al∣cibiades</HI>
suspected to the <HI>Lacedamonians;</HI> inso∣much
that they sent private Orders to <HI>Astyo∣chus</HI>
their Admiral, to dispatch him. Besides
he had incens'd <HI>Agis</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> King against
him, by carrying on an Affair with his Wife.
<PB N="332" REF="366"/>
But the truth is, he began to be envy'd at
<HI>Sparta,</HI> because all Affairs of Consequence
which succeeded well, were universally ascrib'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Flies to</HI> Tissapher∣nes.</NOTE> Having secret Intelligence of their
Designs against him, he retir'd to <HI>Tissaphernes</HI>
the <HI>Persian</HI> King's Lieutenant, and by his Ad∣dress
soon work'd himself into great Repute
with him. Thus having quitted the interests
of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> he endeavour'd to do them all
ill Offices, and render them odious to <HI>Tissa∣phernes.</HI>
He advis'd him <HI>To furnish them but
sparingly with Mony; and to keep the Ballance so
even betwixt</HI> Athens <HI>and</HI> Sparta, that he might
<HI>wear them out, and consume them insensibly and
when they had wasted their Strength upon one ano∣ther,
they would both become an easie Prey to his
King.</HI> By which means he was hinder'd from
assisting them vigorously, and from finally
ruining the <HI>Athenians.</HI> At the same time he
practis'd with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> whose chief
Strength then lay at <HI>Samos,</HI> about his being recall'd;
and as a Condition of it, gave them
hopes, <HI>That he would make</HI> Tissaphernes <HI>their
Friend; Provided also, that they would re∣form
the Government, which was administer'd
by ill Men, and put it into fewer Hands.</HI> The
chief Man who oppos'd his Return, was <HI>Phry∣nicus</HI>
one of the Generals, who to compass his
Designs, sent word to <HI>Astyochus</HI> the <HI>LacedAemo∣nian</HI>
General, that <HI>Alcibiades</HI> was treating with
<HI>Tissapherncs,</HI> to bring him over to the <HI>Athenian</HI>
Interest. He offer'd further, to betray to him
the whole Army and Navy of the <HI>Athenians:</HI>
But his treasonable Practices being all detected
the good Understanding betwixt <HI>Alcibiades,</HI>
<PB N="333" REF="367"/>
and <HI>Astyochus,</HI> he was laid aside, and afterwards
stabb'd in the Market-place.</P>
<P>This Year began with the Revolt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 92. 2</NOTE> and Re∣covery
of several Places towards the <HI>Hellespont.</HI>
The Treaty was still on foot with <HI>Alcibiades;</HI>
and to bring it to an Issue, the <HI>Democracy</HI> was
abolish'd in several Cities subject to <HI>Athens,</HI> any
soon after in <HI>Athens</HI> it self, way being mad
for it by the Murder of <HI>Androcles,</HI> and others
who appear'd most violent for the People: So
that the Government was now restrain'd to
four hundred Men in the Nature of an <HI>Oli∣garchy.</HI>
The manner of effecting this Change
was by ten Men, who for fear of being insul∣ted
by the People, obtain'd leave; <HI>That what∣ever
they should propost, might be without dan∣ger
of incurring any Penalty by the Laws.</HI> He
who appear'd chiefly in the Transaction of this
Affair, was <HI>Pisander:</HI> But the whole Scheme
of it was laid down by <HI>Antiphon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aniphon <HI>his Chara∣cter.</HI></NOTE> a Man for
his Virtue, and Abilities not inferior to any of
his time: For no Man thought juster than he,
or express'd his Thoughts better. But find∣ing
the People jealous of his Merit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>punc; and the
Force of his Eloquence, he avoided all Occa∣sions
of distinguishing himself in the Assem∣blies;
yet did not desert the Service of his
Country, tho' he did not appear in it. For
his Advice was generally ask'd, and follow'd,
as well in the most important Exigencies of
State, as in private Suits in the Courts of Ju∣stice.
When upon the next Change of the
Government he was impeach'd, and try'd for
his Life, as being instrumental in it, he made
the best Defence of any Man to that Day in
<HI>Athens.</HI> The four hundred Men thus aurho∣ris'd,
<PB N="334" REF="368"/>
were conducted to the Senate-House with
Guards,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Go∣vernment of the four hundred in</HI> Athens.</NOTE> and Daggers under their Coats, where the
<HI>Council of five hundred</HI> were paid their Arrears
of Salary, and dismiss'd But they soon began
to exert their Power very imperiously, imprisoning,
banishing, and killing such as they
thought obnoxious; and in the mean while
sent to treat with <HI>Agis</HI> about a Peace. But he
was so far from hearkening to their Proposals,
that he took this Occasion to advance to∣wards
<HI>Athens,</HI> in hopes the City would sur∣render
under its present Consternation; 'till
finding the People obstinate in their Defence,
he was forc'd to retire to <HI>Decelea.</HI></P>
<P>The Army in the mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcibiades <HI>recal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d and created General.</HI></NOTE> which was
at <HI>Samos,</HI> protested against these Proceedings
in the City; and at the Persuasion of <HI>Thrasy∣bulus</HI>
recall'd <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> and created him Ge∣neral,
with full Power to sail directly to the
<HI>Piraeus,</HI> and crush this new Tyranny. He
would not give way to this rash Opinion; but
went first to shew himself to <HI>Tissaphernes,</HI> and
let him know, <HI>That it was now in his Power
to treat him as a Friend, or an Enemy:</HI> By
which means he aw'd the <HI>Athenians</HI> with <HI>Tissaphernes,</HI>
and <HI>Tissaphernes</HI> with the <HI>Athenians.</HI>
When afterwards <HI>the four hundred</HI> sent to <HI>Sa∣mos</HI>
to vindicate their Proceedings, the Army
was for putting the Messengers to Death, and
persis in the sign upon the <HI>Piroeus;</HI> but
<HI>Alcibiades</HI> by opposing it, manifestly sav'd the
Common-'wealth. For if they had return'd to
<HI>Athens,</HI> all <HI>Ionia,</HI> and the <HI>Hellespont</HI> must have

the <HI>Athenians,</HI> engag'd in Civil Wars, destroy'd

Confederates mut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y'd for Pay, and
had kill'd <HI>Astyochus</HI> their Admiral, if he had
not taken Sanctuary: But he was soon after
discharg'd from his Command of the Fleet, and
succeeded by <HI>Mindarus.</HI> The <HI>Laccdoemonians</HI>
had for some time been dissatisfyd with <HI>Tissaphernes,</HI>
who now gave them a fresh Occa∣sion,
by detaining a great <HI>Phoenician</HI> Fleet,
which should have come to their Assistance;
the Access of which to either Party would
have enabled them to ravish intirely the Do∣minion
of the Sea from the other Side, and to
have put an End to the War. Whatever his
Designs were, it was a great piece of Service
done to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and is generally ascrib'd
to the Management of <HI>Alcibiades.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while the Innovation in <HI>Athens</HI>
had occasion'd such Factions, and Tumults,
that the <HI>four hundred</HI> were more intent upon
providing for their Safety, than prosecuting
the War: In order to which, they fortify'd that
Part of the <HI>Piroe;us,</HI> which commands the Mouth
of the Haven, and resolv'd in case of Extre∣mity,
rather to let in the <HI>Lacedoemonian,</HI> than
se their Persons to the Fury of their Fel∣low-Citizens.
The <HI>Spartans</HI> took Occasion
from these. Disturbances to hover about with
forty two Gallies under the Conduct of <HI>Hege∣sandridas;</HI>
and the <HI>Athenians</HI> with thirty fix
under <HI>Tymochares</HI> were forc'd to engage them,
but lost part of their Fleet,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Athe∣nians wor∣sted at Sea.</HI></NOTE> and the rest were
dispers'd. To add to which, all <HI>Euboe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
except Oreus, revolted to the <HI>Pcloponnesians.</HI>
This Island had supply'd <HI>Athens</HI> with more
Provisions, than <HI>Attica</HI> it self; and lay so con∣venient
<PB N="336" REF="370"/>
for the Enemy's forcing the <HI>Piroens,</HI>
that the <HI>Athenians</HI> were now under a greater
Consternation, than after the Defeat in <HI>Sicily,</HI>
having no competent Number of Ships, or
Men, and those few Forces, which they had
left, being so miserably torn in Factions, that
they could se nothing less than a final
Destruction. And this is what must ne∣cessarily
have ensu'd, if the <HI>Lacedoemonians</HI> had
not by their Remissness, and Diffidence, espe∣cially
in Sea-Affairs, given Occasion for spin∣ning
out the War.</P>
<P>The first Step the <HI>Athenians</HI> made to reco∣ver
this Blow,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Go∣vernment of the four hundred abolish'd.</HI></NOTE> was to depose <HI>the four hundred,</HI>
and commit the Government to five thousand;
which <HI>Thucydides</HI> takes Notice of, as the most
equal Poise between the Tyranny of the <HI>Few,</HI>
and the Insolence of the <HI>Multitude. Pisander,</HI>
and all the rest of the <HI>Oligarchy</HI> fled to the E∣nemy
at <HI>Decelea,</HI> except <HI>Aristarchus,</HI> who
went with some of the Soldiers to <HI>Oenoe,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
betray'd it to the <HI>Boetians.</HI> In the next place
they furnish'd out as good a Fleet as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

towards the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> and defeated him:
And tho' they gain'd this Victory with a pro∣portionable
ss on their Side, yet it was of
great Importance, as it serv'd to raise the de∣jeted
Spirits of the People, and put new Life
into their Affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Another at</HI> Abydus.</NOTE> Not long after another En∣gagement

accus'd to his Maister by the <HI>Peloponnesians,</HI>

himself from all former Imputations. <HI>Alcibia∣des</HI>

chas'd, and took four with the Men in them,
whom he sent to <HI>Athens.</HI> Being join'd by
the rest of the Fleet at <HI>Sestos,</HI> he transported
the whole Army to <HI>Lampsacus,</HI> which they
fortify'd, and made an Attempt upon <HI>Abydus.</HI>
This occasion'd an hot Skirmish betwixt <HI>Alci∣biades</HI>
and <HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> wherein the latter was
worsted. In the Winter these <HI>Athenian</HI> Forces
made several Incursions into the Continent,
and wasted the <HI>Persian</HI> Territory,</P>
<P><HI>Alcibiades</HI> open'd this Campaign with the
Siege of <HI>Chalcedon;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 93. 1</NOTE> whose Inhabitants having
sent their Corn and Cattle to the <HI>Bithynians</HI>
their Neighbours, he drew down his Army to
<PB N="339" REF="373"/>
the Frontier of the <HI>Bithynians,</HI> and sent Herald
to accuse 'em of this Procedure. They
being terrify'd at his Approach, deliver'd to
him the whole Booty, and enter'd into an Al∣liance
with him. After which he went on
with his Works at <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> encompass'd it
with a Wall from Sea to Sea, and made a
Boom cross the River. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> the <HI>Lacedoemonian</HI>
Governor of the Town, made a Sally;
but was kill'd, and his Men repuls'd. <HI>Pharnabazus</HI>
also, who advanc'd with his Forces to
raise the Siege, could not approach the Town
by reason of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Works. The <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
soon after by Force and Stratagem, took
in <HI>Selymbria, Byzantium,</HI> and other Places.</P>
<P>The ss of these Expeditions inflam'd
<HI>Alcibiades's</HI> Desire of seeing his Native Coun∣try
again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 93. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> at a time when he could appear with
so much Honour. Accordingly being recall'd
he set Sail to, <HI>Athens,</HI> his Ships being adorn'd
on every Side with great Numbers of Shields
and other Spoils, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owing after them many
Gallies taken from the Enemy, with the En∣signs
and Ornaments of many others, which
he had' sunk and destroy'd; all of them toge∣ther
amounting to two hundred.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcibia∣des's <HI>Re∣caption at</HI> Athens.</NOTE> As soon as
he was landed, the Multitude, who came out
to meet him, fix'd their Eyes on him, throng'd
about him, saluted him with loud Acclamati∣ons,
and crown'd him with Garlands. They
pronounc'd him <HI>The bravest Man of their Coun∣try;</HI>
declaring, <HI>That in his Sentence of Banish∣ment,
he had been barbarously circumvented and
traduc'd by Men of less Abilities, and Eloquence
than himself, and such as serv'd themselves of
the Government: That he had always promoted
<PB N="340" REF="374"/>
the Good of the Common-wealth, not only with
the publick Stock, but his private Fortune: That
being in continual Danger of his Life, he was
forc'd to caress his greatest Enemies; and tho' he
saw the Miscarriages of State, yet was render'd
incapable by his Exile, of serving his dearest
Friends and Countrymen.</HI> These Reflections re∣viv'd
the Memory of their past Miseries, which
they imputed wholly to his Absence, as on the
other hard, they ascrib'd their present flou∣rishing
Condition to his immediate Conduct
and Influence. Soon after in an Assembly of
the Senate and People, he lamented his own
Sufferings and their Usage of him, but touch'd
the latter so gently and modestly, that he im∣puted
all to his hard Fortune, and some ill
<HI>Genius,</HI> that attended him. Upon which they
created him <HI>Generalissimo</HI> both at Land and
Sea, as the only Man capable of restoring his
Country to its ancient Grandeur. They gave
him back his Estate, and order'd the <HI>Eumol∣piles,</HI>
and <HI>Holy Heralds</HI> to absolve him from
the Curses, which they had solemnly pro∣nounc'd
against him by Sentence of the People.
Which was obev'd by all, but <HI>Theodorus</HI> the
High-Priest, who excus'd himself, saying, <HI>I
never denounc'd any Execration against him, if
he have done nothing against the Common-wealth.</HI>
He so won upon the meaner sort of People,
that they passionately desir'd he would take
the Sovereignty upon him: Some of 'em made
no Difficulty to tell him so, and advise him <HI>to
put himself out of the Reach of Envy, and above
the Fear of being call'd to account by those, who
were endeavouring to overturn the State.</HI> It
does not appear that he made Attempts that
<PB N="341" REF="375"/>
way; but the chief Men in the City were so ap∣prehensive
of it, that they immediately equipp'd
out an hundred Gallies with Soldiers on board
them, gave him liberty to chuse his own Offi∣cers,
and did all they could, to hasten him on
Ship-board. Accordingly three Months after
his Return, he set Sail to <HI>Andros,</HI> and having
defeated the Inhabitants, went from thence to
<HI>Samos,</HI> intending to make that the Seat of the
War.</P>
<P>In the mean while the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> were
resolv'd to exert themselves more vigorously;
and finding their Affairs requir'd greater Preparations,
and a Commander fit to oppose to
<HI>Alcibiades,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lysander <HI>his Character.</HI></NOTE> they pitch'd upon <HI>Lysander;</HI> who
tho' he was related to the Family of the <HI>Hera∣clidaelig;,</HI>
had been bred up under much Hardship,
and paid an intire Respect to the Discipline
and Manners of his Country. He was brave,
and aspiring, and like his Countrymen, sacrific'd
all sorts of Pleasure to his Ambition. He
had an Evenness and Sedateness of Temper,
which made all Conditions of Life fit easie
upon him; but withal was extremely insinuating,
crafty, and designing, and made his In∣terest
the only Measure of Truth and Falshood.
This deceitful Temper was observ'd to run
through the whole Course of his Life; upon
which Occasion it was said, <HI>That he cheated
Children with foul Play, and Men with Perjury:</HI>
And it was a Maxim of his own, <HI>That when
the Lion fails, we must make Use of the Fox.</HI></P>
<P>In discharge of this new Office he put to
Sea, and leaving the Fleet at <HI>Epheus,</HI> went
from thence to <HI>Cyrus</HI> the young <HI>Perian</HI> Prince
at <HI>Sardis:</HI> To whom he exclaim'd againt the
<PB N="342" REF="376"/>
Treachery of <HI>Tissaphernes,</HI> prevail'd with him
to encrease the Seamens Pay, and having fix'd
him intirely in the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> Interest, re∣turn'd
to <HI>Ephesus. Alcibiades</HI> having Occasion
to go from <HI>Samos</HI> to <HI>Phocaea,</HI> left the Care of
the Fleet to <HI>Antiochus</HI> his Vice-Admiral, with
express Command not to engage, tho' the E-nemy
should provoke him. But he was so far
from observing his Orders, that with two
Gallies he presently slood for <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and at
the very Mouth of the Harbour, us'd the high∣est
Provocations possible to draw out the Ene∣my.
<HI>Lysander</HI> at first mann'd out a few Ships to
give him Chafe; upon which the whole <HI>Athe∣nian</HI>
Fleet coming to his Relief,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He defeats the</HI> Atheninans <HI>as Sea.</HI></NOTE> he also drew
up his in good Order, and gain'd an intire
Victory, <HI>Antiochus</HI> being slam, and fifteen
<HI>Athenian</HI> Gallies taken. <HI>Alcibiades</HI> at this
News, order'd a Rendezvous of the Ships that
remain'd, to be made at <HI>Samos,</HI> and offer'd to
renew the Fight; but <HI>Lysander</HI> content with
the Victory he had gain'd, would not stir.
However this Defeat brought Alcibiades into,
Disgrace. at <HI>Athens;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcibiades <HI>in Disgrace</HI></NOTE> and he, who was jusl before
respected even to Adoration, was now discard∣ed
upon a groundless Suspicion, that he had
not done his Duty. Certainly if ever Man
was ruin'd by his own Glory, it was <HI>Alcibia∣des.</HI>
For his continual Success had begot in
the People such an Opinion of him, that they
thought it impossible for him to fail in any
thing he undertook; and from thence his Enemies
took Occasion to question his Integri∣ty,
and to impute to him both his own, and
others Miscarriages. He being retied to a
Fort he had built in the <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> ten others
<PB N="343" REF="377"/>
were appointed in his room to manage the
War: <HI>Canon</HI> one of them finding the Fleet at
<HI>Samos</HI> in a very ill Condition, made it up seventy
Sail, and putting to Sea, made several
Descents, and harass'd the Enemies Country.</P>
<P><HI>Callicratidas</HI> being sent to succeed <HI>Lysander,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 93. 3</NOTE>
whose Year was expir'd, <HI>I deliver up the Fleet
to you,</HI> says the latter, <HI>which by my Victory
rides Sovereign of the Seas. I'll allow it you,</HI>
says Callicratidas, <HI>if you will cost along from</HI>
Ephesus <HI>to the left of</HI> Samos, <HI>where the</HI> Athenian
<HI>Fleet lyes, and resign it at</HI> Miletus. <HI>Lysander's</HI>
Answer was, <HI>That he would not meddle whilst
another commanded.</HI> The first Attempt of the
new Admiral was against <HI>Methymna</HI> in <HI>Lesbos,</HI>
which he took by Storm. He then threaten'd
<HI>Canon, That he would make him leave</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>whoring
the Sea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Atheninans <HI>defeated again at sea.</HI></NOTE> and accordingly seeing him stand out
to Sea. he pursu'd him into the' Port of <HI>Mity∣lens</HI>
with an hundred and seventy Sail, took
thirty off his Ships, and besieg'd him in the
Town, from which he cut off all Provisions.
He soon after took ten more out of twelve,
which were coming to Ms Relief. Then hear∣ing
that the <HI>Athenians</HI> had fitted out their
whole Strength, consisting of an hundred and
fifty Sail, he left fifty of his Ships under <HI>Eteozicus,</HI>
to carry on the Siege of <HI>Mitylene,</HI> and with an hundred and
twenty more met the <HI>Athenians</HI> at <HI>Arginusae</HI>
over-against <HI>Lesbos.</HI> His
Pilot advis'd him to retreat; for that the Enemy
was superior in Number. He told him,
<HI>That Sparta would be never the worse inhabited,
the' he. were stain.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fight at</HI> Arginus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aelig;.</NOTE> The Fight was long and
obstinate, 'till at last <HI>Callicratidas</HI> charging

<PB N="344" REF="378"/>
fled. The <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> lost about seventy
Sail, and the <HI>Athenians</HI> twenty five with most
of the Men in them. The <HI>Athenian</HI> Admirals,
who had the joint Command of the Fleet, in∣stead
of being rewarded for so signal a Victo∣ry,
were made a barbarous Instance of their
Fellow-Citizens Power, and Ingratitude. Up∣on
a Relation of the Fight before the Senate,
it was alledg'd, they had suffer'd their Men,
who were Shipwreck'd, to be lost, when they
might have sav'd them: Upon which they
were clapp'd in Irons, in order to answer it to
the People. They urg'd in their Defence,
<HI>That they were pursuing the Enemy, and at the
same time gave Orders about taking up the Men,
to those whose Business it was, particularly to</HI>
Theramenes, <HI>who was now their Accuser; but
yet that their Orders could not be executed, by
reason of a violent Storm, which happen'd at that
time.</HI> This seem'd so reasonable, and satisfactory,
that several stood up, and offer'd to
bail them. But in another Assembly the Po∣pular
Incendiaries demanded Justice, and so
aw'd the Judges, that <HI>Socrates</HI> was the only
Man, who had Courage enough to declare,
<HI>He would do nothing contrary to Law,</HI> and ac∣cordingly
refus'd to act.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Six of the</HI> Athenina <HI>Admirals put to Death.</HI> Olym. 934</NOTE> After a long Debate,

<P>The <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> Consederates after their
last Deseat, plac'd their chief Confidence in
<HI>Lysander,</HI> and sent to sollicit his Return to
the Command of the Fleet. The <HI>Lacedamo∣nians</HI>
to gratisie their Allies, and yet observe
their Laws, which forbad that Honour being
<PB N="345" REF="379"/>
conferr'd twice on the same Person, sent him
with the Power of Admiral, but with the Ti∣tle
only of Vice-Admiral to <HI>Aracus.</HI> Having
obtain'd what Supplies of Mony he could from
<HI>Cyrus,</HI> he refitted the Navy; with which he
surpris'd several Islands towards <HI>Attica,</HI> and
failing from thence to the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> besieg'd
<HI>Lampsacus,</HI> and took it. In the mean while
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Fleet consisting of an hundred
and eighty Sail put in at <HI>Sestos,</HI> and from thence
fail'd to <HI>aegos-potamos,</HI> where they were just
opposite to the Enemy, who was still crui∣sing
about <HI>Lampsacus.</HI> The two Navies be∣ing
in fight of one another, <HI>Lysander</HI> command∣ed
all his Men on board, giving them a strict
Charge to watch the Signal. The next Morn∣ing
the <HI>Athenians</HI> drew up in a Line direcly
before him, and gave the Challenge, but he
would not accept it: Upon which they bore
up to him again the next Day; and thus he
suffer'd himself to be insulted for four Days
together. Upon the fifth he dispatch'd some
light Vessels after them, to give him Notice
when the Enemy was landed: They according∣ly
hung out a Shield on the Fore-Deck, which
being the appointed Signal, he took the Land∣Army
on board, and set Sail with all Expedi∣tion.
<HI>Canon</HI> being the first of the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
who descry'd the Enemy, made what haste
he could to get his Men on board; but they
were so dispers'd, that he was forc'd to make
his Escape to <HI>Cyprus</HI> with only eight Vessels.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Athenians <HI>lose their whole Fleet at aegos-potamos.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>Lysander</HI> run in briskly upon the rest, and having
easily made himself Master of the whole
Fleet return'd in Triumph to <HI>Lampsacus</HI> with
<PB N="346" REF="380"/>
three thousand Prisoners, who were all put to
Death, except <HI>Adimantus</HI> one of the Admirals,
who was thought to have betray'd the Fleet
to him.</P>
<P><HI>Lysander</HI> after this spent some time in settling
his Conquests by Land; and sinding that a
good Body of <HI>Athenians</HI> on Shore had thrown
themselves into the Garrisons, he commanded
them all on pain of Death, to repair to <HI>Athens:</HI>
Which he did with a Design to throng the
City, so as to reduce it by Famine, if it did
not surrender upon his opening the Siege. This
was so sudden and fatal a Turn to the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI>
that finding themselves at once depriv'd
of all their Shipping, and Provisions, block'd
up by Sea and Land, and abandon'd by all
their Allies, but <HI>Samos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Athens <HI>besieg'd.</HI></NOTE> they could expect no∣thing
less than what follow'd. But notwith∣standing
these Difficulties, they resolv'd to
stand a Siege, and kept within their Walls,
'till Provisions failing, they were forc'd to send
to <HI>Agis</HI> to make Overtures of Peace. He told
'em, <HI>He had no Power to treat with them,</HI> and
referr'd 'em. to the <HI>Ephori at Sparta;</HI> to whom
they made Proposals of Parting with all Places,
but their City, the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> and <HI>Long Walls.</HI>
The <HI>Ephori</HI> immediately dismiss'd the Ambassadors,
telling 'em, <HI>That if they seriously desir'd a.
Peace, they, must come with fairer Proposals.</HI>
They. had before hinted to 'em, that they ex∣pected
their <HI>Long Walls</HI> should be demolish'd:
But <HI>sArhesratres</HI> was, committed for only mo∣ving,
<HI>That they should conclude a Peace with the</HI>
Lacedaemonians <HI>upon their own Terms.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="381"/>
<HI>Theramenes</HI> at last undertook to manage the
Treaty with <HI>Lysander;</HI> and after three Months
Stay with him, went again to <HI>Sparta;</HI> where
several of the Confederates oppos'd a Peace up∣on
any Terms, insisting upon the total Extir∣pation
of the <HI>Athenians.</HI> But the <HI>Lacedoemo∣nians</HI>
told 'em, <HI>They would not destroy a City,
which had so eminently rescu'd</HI> Greece <HI>in the
most critical Juncture;</HI> and consented to a
Peace upon these Conditions: <HI>That the</HI> Long
Walls, <HI>and Fortifications of the</HI> Piraeus <HI>should
be demolisb'd: That they should deliver up all
their Ships, but twelve: That they should restore
their Exiles: That they should make a League
Offensive and Defensive with the Lacedaemoni∣ans,
and serve them in all their Expeditions both
by Sea and Land. Theramenes</HI> being return'd
with the Articles to <HI>Athens</HI> was ask'd, <HI>Why he
acted so contrary to the Intention of</HI> Themistodes,
<HI>and gave those Walls into the, Hands of the</HI> La∣cedaemonians,
<HI>which he built in Defiance of em?
I have my Eye, fays he, upon</HI> Themistocles <HI>his
Design. He raised these Walls for the Preserva∣tion
of the City; and I for the very same Reason
would have them destroy'd: For if Walls only se∣cure
a City, Sparta, which has none, is in a very
ill Candition.</HI> The <HI>Athenians</HI> at another time
would not have thought this a satisfacto∣ry
Answer; but being reduc'd to the last Ex∣tremity,
it did not admit of a long Debate,
whether they should accept of the Treaty.
Yet as to the business of the Walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Surren∣ders upon Terms.</HI></NOTE> they wav'd

which was, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> being always

Honour of this Poet, that after the last great
Defeat of the <HI>Athenians</HI> before <HI>Syracuse,</HI> many
of the Prisoners were releas'd, only for repeat∣ing
some of his Verses. <HI>Comedy</HI> at the same
time was advanc'd by <HI>Phrynicus, Aristarchus,
Cratinus,</HI> and others; but the greatest and
boldest <HI>Genius</HI> of this kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristopha∣nes.</NOTE> was <HI>Aristophanes:</HI>
Who at the same time that he diverted the
<HI>Athenians</HI> with his Pleasantry, aw'd them with
his Satyr, and attack'd them in their tenderst

perfect in his kind, as he writ in the time of
the <HI>Old Comedy,</HI> which allow'd a Liberty of re∣presenting
things on the Stage without any Dis∣guise
of Persons, or Names. Whatever Im∣provements
<HI>Comedy</HI> receiv'd after this Licence
was restrain'd by the Laws; yet it is certainly
from this Period,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The full Age of Po∣etry.</HI></NOTE> that we are to date <HI>The full
Age of Poetry in</HI> Greece. It is observable, that
no Art made quicker, or f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer Advances than
this. It had indeed for some Ages been made
subservient chiefly to the Propagation of Reli∣gion,
Government, and Philosophy: But Su∣perstition,
and Knowledge of all kinds having by
degrees gather'd Strength enough, to convey
and enforce their Doctrines without the Assist∣ance
of Verse, the <HI>Muse</HI> by this means was di∣vested
of those severer Ornaments, and ap∣pear'd
in her more natural Colours, with an
Air of Wit, and Gaiety, and Politeness. The
<HI>Grecian</HI> Muse was particularly happy in being
supported by a Language, that was smooth
and musical, and yet full and expressive; and
that Variety of <HI>Dialects,</HI> which is generally a
Corruption in other Languages, was not the
least of its Beauties. This prov'd such a migh∣ty
Encouragement, that every one strove to
excel; and some by varying their Numbers,
and others their Subjects, succeeded so well,
as to reduce Poetry to an Art, and by their
Writings to fix a Standard in their several kinds
to succeeding Ages.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Hero</HI> in Philosophy at this time
was <HI>Socrates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrates.</NOTE> of whom we shall have occasion

And here we must not omit the Names of <HI>He∣rodotus,</HI>
and <HI>Thucydides,</HI> to whom the Memory
of <HI>Greece</HI> it self is in a great Measure owing:
The first is consider'd as the <HI>Father,</HI> and
