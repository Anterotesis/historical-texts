<HEAD>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE Pacifick Campaign IN <HI>FLANDERS,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Shall use very little Apolo∣gy in beginning this brief History; my design is to make it useful to the Pub∣blick: As the Secret and Unaccountable <HI>Steps</HI> of it, are the first Motives of leading the Parliament into
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
an Enquiry after all our <HI>Misfortunes</HI> by striking at the very <HI>Root</HI> of them, <HI>The fatal Cessation of Arms.</HI> Hence sprung up the general Calamity of <HI>Europe;</HI> and that more particular and dangerous One to <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> And that every honest <HI>Briton</HI> may be ne∣cessarily apprized of these Things, when the Examination of them in Parliament shall be a chief and gene∣ral subject of Discourse, I will here set them in the most clear and impartial Light possible.</P>
<P>I will not mention our great Succes∣ses of former Campaigns, nor the pitch of Glory we then stood in, because I think it would raise in the Reader a too Melancholly Idea at beginning; but will pass briefly to the Evolutions of that fatal and inglorious Campaign.</P>
<P>Give me leave however to remem∣ber that the Commons had Voted all the necessary <HI>Supplies</HI> for a vigorous and offensive Campaign; and that the Queen had assured the Parliament, <HI>She designed to carry on the War with Vigour, in Conjunction with her Allies;</HI> as well as what she had Wrote to the
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
States General before; and all con∣firmed by the <HI>Declaration</HI> of Her Am∣bassador the Earl of <HI>Strassord,</HI> to their High Mightinesses at the <HI>Hague,</HI> who on the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> preceding this Campaign, told them, <HI>That Her Maje∣sty designed their Troops should act with the same vigour against</HI> France, <HI>as if no Negotiation had been on Foot.</HI> I might add the same promise made to Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> here in <HI>England</HI> at that time, both by the Queen, the General, and the Ministers; but I need not use other Arguments or Quotations to prove what will of it self appear, the high∣est breach of Faith and Insincerity, that was ever charged upon Christian People, and which none but Men abandon'd to the distruction of their Country could have given into, tho' even the best Reasons they are capable of giving for it, were to be depended on.</P>
<P>First then, At the very time that we were making all these warm <HI>Promi∣ses,</HI> and deceitfully shaking Hands with our Allies, we were with the other Hand dealing a favourable Game to the common Enemy: This was by using
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
all the Secret Endeavours in our Power to prevent the States of <HI>Brabant</HI> from supplying that great Body of Imperial Troops then Marching to the <HI>Nether∣lands;</HI> thereby to hinder, or at least, retard their coming into the Country, without whom the <HI>French</HI> knew the Allies wou'd be able to make but a slender Figure that Campaign; and wou'd the more naturally fall into the distructive Arcana's of Peace. The particular hand we had in this, the Transactions of those Times will plain∣ly shew; and I shall now pass over, and come to the Campaign.</P>
<P>The Confederates Troops, accord∣ing to their Orders, begun about the middle of <HI>April</HI> to March into the Field; and the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> not long be∣fore arriv'd from <HI>England,</HI> set out to Command them, and wait the arrival of the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> who being accompanied by Sir <HI>Thomas Hanmer,</HI> a Man of Figure in his Country, and in Parliament, was looked upon as an ill presage; because it was not only un∣usual for an <HI>English</HI> General to bring with him a <HI>Deputy,</HI> or <HI>Comptroller,</HI> but that People, being before inclinable to
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
too many Fears, were apt to catch at every little incident that seemed to make against them, and perhaps more sometimes than was real; but I think they were hardly deceived as to their Doubts and Fears from <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But let me now say, that from the beginning of the War, we never stood on a greater Emminence of Power, nor had so fair a Prospect of Success. The Imperial Troops had broke through all Difficulties, and were ar∣rived in the Army, and the first scene of a Glorious Campaign had been opened very early, by burning and de∣stroying the general Magazines of the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Arras,</HI> and striking sufficient Terror to the Enemy.</P>
<P>The two chief Generals, the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> ha∣ving held the necessary Conferences concerning the Campaign, and all the mutual Favours and Civilities passed on both sides, they set out together for the Army, then encamp'd between <HI>Doway</HI> and <HI>Marchiennes,</HI> and four Days after broke up, as if to enter on offen∣sive Measures; the Army, to the num∣ber
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
122250 Men, divided into two Com∣mands. The Prince encamped with his Right at <HI>Noyelles,</HI> and his left at <HI>Montrecourt,</HI> and the Duke with his Right at some distance from the Prince's Left; and his Left at <HI>Briase</HI> on the River <HI>Selle.</HI> The Troops under General <HI>Fagel</HI> at the same time join'd the Grand Army; thirteen Battalions, and thirty Squadrons were left for the Security of our Bridges, and to secure a Communication with <HI>Marchiennes</HI> where our chief Magazines lay.</P>
<P>By all which Dispositions it seem'd plain that the Design was to attack the Enemy, who, with an inferior Army, ventur'd to encamp as if they had in∣vited us to attempt a Battle; but alas! they knew their Security lay in quite other Means, and too well understood our insincerity.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the States Deputies soon perceiv'd an Advantage if all was right; but were doubtful of some underhand Dealing, more espe∣cially when they saw the <HI>French</HI> so hardily inclined to stand them. But to lose no time, and to sound the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
General, they proposed first sending out a Detachment to view the situation of the Enemy, to which the Duke very readily consented. This was the 27th of <HI>May,</HI> and the Imperial General <HI>Felz,</HI> who was sent on this occasion, brought Word, <HI>That the Spring-head of the</HI> Schelde <HI>and the</HI> Somme, <HI>was large enough for Twenty Squadrons to March a breast.</HI></P>
<P>This fired the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> as it did all the other Generals to whom it was related: His Highness inwardly resolved to fight them without loss of time; the <HI>Dutch</HI> concurr'd, and Dispo∣sitions were made to that purpose: But now came the Tryal, for the Prince came to the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> the next Morning, and told him in a very pleasing manner, <HI>That such an Opportunity now presented to Fight the Ene∣my, as he knew his Grace could not but ap∣prove, since it promis'd so fair an Issue of Success and so much Honour to him.</HI> But the Duke, like a Man unresolved, did not answer it with any readiness of Ex∣pression, always conspicuous in Men of Glory; but with something of Con∣cern, told the Prince, <HI>He could not im∣mediately
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
resolve on this, till he had had the Opininon of his Officers, but would do it in the Afternoon;</HI> and for this pur∣pose invited the Prince, Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Field Deputies to Dine with him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Duke, to make a shew of doing something, de∣tach'd all the Grenadiers of his Army, under the Command of a Trusty Ge∣neral, with a Design, as it was given out, to drive the Enemy from some advanced Posts, but they returned, as 'tis remarkable, without the least Act of Hostility, not being able, as they pretended, to come at the Enemy for some Defiles; and added, That the <HI>French</HI> had raised some Works to hin∣der the Confederates from passing the <HI>Schelde;</HI> when indeed the most probable Cause was, That they had thereby an opportunity of gaining some Advice from Marshal <HI>Villars.</HI></P>
<P>This Report, which was then thought to be nothing but meer Con∣trivance, however, furnished the Duke of <HI>O—d</HI> with a plausible Ex∣cuse to object against the Prince's Mea∣sures,
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
who was perfectly out of Pati∣ence, as perceiving the slight, urged the Matter so far, as well as the States Deputies, that they left this poor Great Man no shelter, or farther Eva∣sion, but forced him openly to declare, <HI>That he had receiv'd positive Orders from the Queen not to agree to a Battle;</HI> where∣upon the Prince, without any great surprize, made Answer, <HI>That indeed, after what had been said to him, he could not have expected such an Answer; but however, if his Grace was under such Orders, they did not wholly disappoint the Success of the Campaign, for they might still, in Obedience to those Orders, under∣take the Sieges of</HI> Landrecy <HI>and</HI> Quesnoy, <HI>and after penetrate to</HI> Paris <HI>through the Country of</HI> Champaign. But alas the Duke had an Answer ready for this too, viz. <HI>That his Orders sorbad him to enter into any Action against the Enemy, either by Battle or by Siege.</HI></P>
<P>At which the Prince is said to have answer'd, and very probably, <HI>My Lord, What d' ye here then?</HI> But waving all farther Reflection, his Highness and the Deputies expostulated further with the Duke, adding that the Confederate
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Army having now passed the <HI>Schelde</HI> and <HI>Selle,</HI> and being advanced into the middle of the Enemies Garrisons, they could not retreat without the hazard of receiving a Blow, and that it would have been better since it was so, that he had discovered his Orders before they had drawn themselves into that hazard.</P>
<P>With what Contempt this Answer of the <HI>English</HI> General must be receiv'd let any one imagine; however, it was kept as secret as possible, both to pre∣vent such Disorders as might have hap∣pen'd in the Army, as to take such o∣ther Measures and Precautions as might be necessary to prevent the fatal Consequences. In order to which, the States Deputies immediately di∣spatch'd an Express to the <HI>Hague,</HI> of what had happen'd; and 'tis easy to suppose what a Consternation it raised there: They first sent a Complaint of this to the Bishop of <HI>Bristol</HI> at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> who answer'd, <HI>That he knew nothing of the Matter, and would represent it to the Queen;</HI> but took an occasion at the same time, to upbraid them with their Conduct in not complying with the
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Peace, and in the end, to let them know, <HI>That her Majesty thought herself disengaged from all Alliances and Engage∣ments with the States.</HI></P>
<P>There needed no Wings to speed this Message to the <HI>Hague;</HI> all <HI>Holland,</HI> and even the whole Confederacy was under the greatest Alarm; they began to suspect, that either the <HI>English</HI> had made a separate Peace, or at least intend∣ed to do it; nor was they wholly free from sear, that they should join the Ar∣my of the Enemy. At the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Ministers of all the Allies, were call'd together, and several Conferences were held, and private Measures concerted, especially, between the States, the Elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> our present Sove∣reign, the <HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>Hesse Cassel,</HI> and some other <HI>German</HI> Princes, for subsisting the Foreign Troops in <HI>British</HI> Pay; so that the Army might suffer no other Diminution than by the Na∣tive Troops of <HI>Britain,</HI> amounting to about Twelve Thousand Men.</P>
<P>The States General, in the mean time, wrote a long and moving Letter to the Queen, which does very justly
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
expose the wavering and faithless Con∣duct of a base and treacherous Ministry; to which the Queen answer'd:</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The QUEEN's Answer.</HEAD>
<HEAD>High and Mighty Lords, Friends, Allies, and Confederates.</HEAD>
<P><Q>“THere is nothing dearer to us than the Preservation of a good Understanding and a Perfect U∣nion with your State. This has been the Principal Object of our Care; and we have so little Ground to ac∣cuse our selves of having in the least contributed to the lessening of the same, that we reflect with Pleasure on the Pains we have taken, and on all the Instances we have made, that the Disputes which have happen'd, with relation to the Interests of the two Nations, should be amicably de∣termin'd, so as we might communicate our Thoughts to one another, with∣out Reserve upon those of the Pub∣lick; for in the present Conjuncture of Affairs, there ought to be an e∣qual Frankness on both Sides, and a” mutual Confidence.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
<Q>“We suppose the Alarms which you took on Account of the Declarations made by the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Bristol,</HI> are now over; and we repeat to you what we have so often declared, That it will be your own Fault, as it has been in the time past, if all our Measures about War or Peace be not taken in Concert” with your State.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The E. of <HI>Strafford</HI> will be with you in a few Days, with full Instructi∣ons concerning our Intentions. Our Ministers will be dispos'd and autho∣ris'd to do all that is incumbent on us, to renew an entire Confidence with you, and to prevent for the fu∣ture, such Misunderstandings as have been fomented with so much Artifice” and so little Foundation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I am unwilling to reflect on this An∣swer of the Queen's, because there is such a clutter made about her Memory; but I cannot help saying there is somewhat in it very poor and artificial. After be∣traying a Confederacy, and losing the most Glorious Opportunity that ever offer'd, we come to say, <HI>We suppose the</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
<HI>Alarms which you took on account of the Declarations of the Duke of</HI> Ormond, <HI>and the Bishop of</HI> Bristol, <HI>are now over;</HI> What wretched Foible and Prevarica∣tion is this? And what mean Spirits must they be, what shuffling vile Poli∣ticians, that could Dictate to a victo∣rious Monarch any thing so poor, so cajoling, and insincere? But to return to the Army.</P>
<P>The <HI>British</HI> General having made the aforesaid Declaration, That he could not Engage in any Action, ei∣ther by Battle or Siege, against the Enemy, the Confederate Army was obliged to lye inactive and waste many Days in the prime of the Summer, in tedious Expectations of a final Answer from the Court of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and giving the Enemy an opportunity to improve their Army, provide their Towns, and to secure themselves a∣gainst the worst: But there was no re∣medy but a little Patience. Had we been so ingenuous with them at first, to have resolved them, that we did not intend to make the Campaign against <HI>France,</HI> it would have been an Advan∣tage to the Allies to have known it,
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
and they might have taken the Field with an Army sufficient to have made an offensive Campaign without the <HI>English</HI> Troops; but the making the Enemy Master of the Secret, and not the Allies, was of the highest Service to <HI>France;</HI> and the <HI>British</HI> Forces only a Check or Comptroll upon the Con∣federates; a Burden and Inconvenien∣cy that ruined the Campaign, the Alli∣ance, and the Peace, and set the Enemy in a condition to Brave us, and from whom ever after, even Those who had been the Means of their attaining this Power, were not able to obtain the least Point toward accomplishing that Peace, which they had pretendedly set up for Dictators of. Now was the time that <HI>France</HI> held a winning Game; they had the Confederates at Mercy, and nothing to fear from the Pusilani∣mous <HI>English;</HI> the Necks of whose Mi∣nistry their King had under his Girdle. He knew that they were out of all manner of Credit of restoring them∣selves with the Allies, without carry∣ing on the War, and breaking off the Negotiations, and that this could not be done with any security to them∣selves, for it must necessarily be attend∣ed
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
with a Change of the Ministry, these having publickly, as well as pri∣vately, gone such lengths in the Peace, that there was no turning back; and to secure themselves, wou'd not stick to grant any Concessions that could be demanded of them. To which miser∣able Reasons we owe all our Misfor∣tunes; for it was certainly as much the Interest of these Wretches to make a good Peace as a bad one, had they gone honestly and fairly about it. For the same Reasons, had they been pushed a little farther by the Whigs, who led them but an uneasy kind of Life, they would at length have gone roundly to work to have brought in the Pretender, under whom they might plausibly have dated their Security; many of them having regretted since that they drove it off so long.</P>
<P>Whilst the Army lay gaping for News from <HI>England,</HI> and exclaiming with open Mouths against the Proceed∣ings of the <HI>British</HI> General; the News of what had been done in <HI>Flanders</HI> struck a general surprize through the whole Nation; the Guilt of which the Ministers were so Conscious of, that it
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
was made a Crime, that one of the News Papers, <HI>The Flying Post,</HI> had ventur'd to assert it in Print, as if they were ashamed to own, what they had not been ashamed to act.</P>
<P>However, it could not escape the cognizance of Parliament, The House of Lords had a particular meeting upon it; and the Ministry had no other way to allay the heat it was like to raise, but by a cajoling Promise, which we shall see they were as little inclined to keep as any of the Engage∣ments they had made before. The Lord Trea—er therefore, to stop the Mouths of the House, told them, <HI>That Orders had been sent away to the Duke of</HI> Ormond <HI>to join with the Allies in a Siege; and that in a few days Her Majesty, according to Her Promise will lay before them, the Conditions on which a General Peace might be had; which he doubted not would give entire satisfaction to every Member of that Assembly, and to all true Englishmen.</HI> By which dis∣simulated Declaration the Ministers pre∣vailed to have the Debate adjourned: But the honest Party in the House sent such a Sting after it in the following
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
Protest, as made them very restless and uneasie; and 'tis certain no Men were ever under a greater perplexity than the Ministry were at this time, which as I have observ'd, they were driven on by the indefatigable Conduct of the Whigs, whom they were unable to deal withal, even when they were in the highest Power.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD><HI>The Protest of the Lords of the 27th of</HI> May, 1712.</HEAD>
<P><Q>“WE conceive such an Order as is propos'd in the Question, to be absolutely necessary, because we are fully convinc'd, that the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> do's lye under some Order of Restraint, from acting Offensive∣ly, not only from the Accounts which are publick both here and in <HI>Holland,</HI> of his declaring it to Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and to the Deputies of the States at their late Consultation, when both Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and those Deputies, earnestly press'd him to joyn in attacking the <HI>French</HI> Army, <HI>which was then known to be much Inferior to that of the Allies, both in the Number and Condition of the Troops;</HI> but also,
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
for that nothing of this whole Mat∣ter was deny'd by those Lords who have the Means of knowing these Facts, as undoubtedly wou'd have been without Scruple, had not the said Facts been true; since no Scruple was made of Acquainting the House with a subsequent Order very lately sent to the Duke of <HI>Ormond, allowing him to join in a Siege,</HI> which is a fur∣ther Evidence that he had before some Order of Restraint, for other∣wise this last Order would be unne∣cessary and absurd; it being a gene∣ral, constant, and standing Instructi∣on to every Commander in Chief, by Land or Sea, to do his utmost Endea∣vour to annoy the Enemy. And it is manifest by this last Order, that even in the Opinion of the Ministers, it was expedient to take off this Restraint to some degree; and the leaving the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> still under a Re∣straint from giving Battle to the <HI>French,</HI> seems most unaccountable, and inconsistent with the Liberty in∣dulg'd to him of joyning in a Siege, and renders it altogether useless: For no Place, when taken, will be of such Advantage to the Allies, as <HI>Cam∣bray,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
which opens a free Passage for Our Army into the Heart of <HI>France;</HI> and 'tis impossible to besiege that Place without Dislodging the <HI>French</HI> from their Incampment; and this is also impossible, if the <HI>French</HI> will keep their Ground. Other Attempts seem to be of little Use, <HI>but may serve to give the</HI> French <HI>Time, which they do” not want Skill to improve.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>“We conceive it to be Derogatory to Her Majesty's Honour, to <HI>publick Faith,</HI> and that Justice which is due to Her Majesty's Allies; and that 'tis a sort of Imposing upon our Allies a Cessation of Arms without their Con∣sent, and in the most prejudicial manner, because they were not so much as acquainted with it, and so might have been led into great Dif∣ficulties; besides that, it frustrates all Essential Advantages against the Common Enemy, <HI>which may be of Fa∣tal Consequence to this Nation, and all”</HI> Europe.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>“Because it was acknowledg'd that a <HI>General Peace</HI> was not conclu∣ded, as indeed it is very unlikely it
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
should be; there having been no An∣swers in Writing given by the <HI>French</HI> to the Specifick Demands of the Al∣lies, tho' the same were deliver'd to the <HI>French</HI> Three Months ago; and it was further declar'd, that there was no <HI>Separate Peace,</HI> nay, that such a <HI>Peace</HI> would be <HI>Foolish, Knavish,</HI> and <HI>Villainous:</HI> And therefore while We are in <HI>War,</HI> and having no Se∣curity of a <HI>Peace,</HI> We conceive that such an Order of Restraint is a plain Neglect of all those happy Opportu∣nities, <HI>which</HI> Providence <HI>might, and lately did, put into Our Hands of Sub∣duing Our Enemy, and Forcing him to a Just and Honourable Peace.</HI> And surely it is imprudent and dangerous to rely on the Promises of <HI>France,</HI> which are so far from being any Se∣curity, that even a <HI>Peace</HI> would not be safe, in Our Opinion, unless it be such as gives so full Satisfaction to the Allies, that they shall be willing to joyn with Us in a mutual Guaran∣ty” of it.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>“Her Majesty having with great Wisdom declared to this Parliament, <HI>That the best means of obtaining a Good</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
<HI>Peace, is to make early Preparations for War, and a vigorous Prosecution of it;</HI> and since the Parliament has with great Duty and Deference to Her Majesty, and a Zeal for the Inte∣rest of their Country, and of <HI>Eu∣rope, given very great Supplies for that Purpose,</HI> We conceive that such an Order of Restraint being very different from that Declaration of Her Majesty, <HI>must be the Effect of very ill Advice;</HI> by which the Parliament's good Intentions will be defeated, and all those heavy Loads of Taxes, which they have for so good Purposes chear∣fully given, render'd fruitless and un∣necessary, and may, in Conclusion, after having thus trifled away our Wealth and Time, bring Us into the Necessity of <HI>accepting such a Peace, as shall please an insolent and domineering” Enemy to give Us.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If the Lords saw reason to use this last Expression, what shall be said when we come to the end of this fatal Campaign: But I shall now follow these new repeated Orders to <HI>Flanders,</HI> by which the Lords were with such Confidence made to believe, the Duke
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
of <HI>Ormond</HI> had full Power to assist the Allies in a Siege; which, if sincere, was a very conclusive and clandestine way of Dealing with Confederates; But even this we shall see was not du∣ly performed.</P>
<P>That such Orders were sent, there is no doubt; but the Prevarication and Restraint they carried with them, is justly becoming so tricking and shuffling a Ministry. Upon the re∣peated Instances of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Minister here, as well as of the Baron <HI>de Hohen∣dorf,</HI> Adjutant General to Prince <HI>Eu∣gene,</HI> sent over on purpose to represent that Matter here; they at length, as a very great Boon, obtained Satisfaction of the Treasurer to know that Orders had been sent to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> to concur with the Allies in a Siege; and this too had another Reason, for the Lords being to meet the same Day, such a Declaration might be readily affirm'd to appease the Storm that was like to gather in the House.</P>
<P>Accordingly we shall find these Or∣ders dispatch'd away the 27th of <HI>May</HI> 1712. and that they arrived in the Ar∣my
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
the 3d or 4th of <HI>June.</HI> This be∣ing known to the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the necessary Conferrences held, it was resolved that the Siege of <HI>Qnesnoy,</HI> should be formed, and that the <HI>British</HI> General should cover the Siege.</P>
<P>But let me here first take notice, that the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> and the States General wisely conjecturing, that by the former Declaration of the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the <HI>British</HI> Ministers had privately agreed upon a Suspension of Arms with <HI>France,</HI> but had reason to conceal it as long as they could, and would impose it on the Allies, if they could draw away from them the Auxilliaries in <HI>English</HI> Pay; they had taken such Measures as had secured those Troops in the Inte∣rest of the Common Cause; an incident so well known, that I need not say more of it.</P>
<P>To proceed: <HI>Quesnoy</HI> was invested the 19th of <HI>June,</HI> and vigorous Prepa∣rations made for carrying on the Siege: But scarce were the Trenches begun to be open'd, but the <HI>British</HI> General re∣lapsed again. The <HI>French</HI> having no∣tice
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
of the Orders sent to the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> to assist in a Siege, could not away with it; it was, tho' a small Place, a Post of Consequence, and laid the Heart of their Country open. Our new Friends therefore must be grati∣fied; and for fear it should come too late, Orders it seems were not long arriving, for on the 21st of <HI>June,</HI> bare∣ly two Days after the Investiture of the Place, the <HI>British</HI> General being invi∣ted to a Conference between the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> and the States Deputies, excused himself by reason of a small Indisposition; but indeed, that he might avoid concerting any farther Measures with them.</P>
<P>This added much to their former Su∣spitions, however, they resolved to push on the Siege, and order'd Matters so, that if the Duke should draw off, the Siege might not want to be duly co∣ver'd, which, in the mean time, they pushed on zealously, and render'd it high time, for the Duke to make his private Orders known; for those which just before they had fooled the Nation with, and made the Pretence to stop the Mouths of the Lords, were
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
already countermanded, or wholly for∣got.</P>
<P>The Duke therefore to put himself and the Confederates out of Pain, on the 24th of <HI>June,</HI> having acted full five days against the common Enemy, with that Zeal and Conduct becoming a Paci∣fick General, sent to desire a Conference with the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the States Field Deputies, wherein, good Man he declared, that he had receiv'd Or∣ders from the Queen his Mistress, to publish within three days a Suspension of Arms for two Months, between his Army and the <HI>French,</HI> and to make a Detachment to take Possession of <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may see we were arrived to such a pitch of Insincerity and Trick∣ing, that to keep our Faith a Month together was impracticable, nay, even a Week, for 'twas no more, between our undertaking to cover the Siege, and our telling the Allies that we were fair∣ly going to abandon them, at a time so short, that 'tis evident such Contradicti∣on of Orders had a nearer Source than what came from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
that very often the breath of a <HI>French</HI> Trumpeter turn'd the Scale of all our Resolutions, and cool'd all our Va∣lour into nothing.</P>
<P>But the most extraordinary piece of Conduct and Policy was, that the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> General proposed the like Suspensi∣on of Arms should be publish'd through∣out the whole Confederate Army; for which the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> and the De∣puties had an Answer ready: <HI>That they desired time to write to their respective So∣vereigns,</HI> in which they would to be sure, have included time enough to have taken the Town; but the Duke replied, that what they demanded was not in his Power to grant; and if they persisted to carry on the Siege, he could cover the same no longer, but would March off with his Troops in three Days.</P>
<P>But the principal Card was yet to Play, which was the carrying off the Foreign Troops in <HI>British</HI> Pay; who, being acquainted by the Duke, that they must obey his Orders, otherwise they were not to expect to have Bread, Pay, or their Arrears; their Generals,
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
Honestly and Couragiously answer'd, that by Orders from their <HI>Principals,</HI> they were commanded to act against <HI>France,</HI> and that they could not dero∣gate from those Orders without first ac∣quainting their Masters; declaring at the same time, that till they receiv'd any new Commands, they were ob∣liged and resolved to continue with the Prince of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>This Answer was a very great rub in the Measures concerted with <HI>France;</HI> and the March of Ten <HI>English</HI> Batta∣lions to take Possession of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> was stopt by a Trumpeter from Marshal <HI>Villars:</HI> The Reason alledged was, to give time to the rest of the Allies to a∣gree to the Cessation of Arms; but really on other Conditions. It was indeed agreed, that we should be put into possession of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> on the Pro∣viso of withdrawing our Troops from the Confederates, by which the <HI>French</HI> knew they would be unable to carry on the Siege, which the Marshal <HI>Villars</HI> would have been in a Condition to have razed, and had already laid Bridges over the <HI>Sanset</HI> to that End, in case (and which the <HI>French</HI> pretended to
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
understand by withdrawing our Troops) that the Auxilliaries had separated with us: But this not being fulfilled, the Scheme concerted between <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> or the Generals of the two Nations, was overthrown.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Siege of <HI>Ques∣noy</HI> was carried on with extraordinary Vigour and Success: And the <HI>British</HI> General irresolute what to do, his Mea∣sures with the Marshal <HI>de Villars</HI> being disconcerted, and not having time to send to <HI>Britain,</HI> and receive an Answer before the Town of <HI>Quesnoy</HI> was like to be in the Confederates Hands, which he foresaw would swell their Hopes and leave them at Liberty to make a handsome Campaign without him, he e'en resolv'd to try what cajoling wou'd do, a Property he had sometimes seen practised with Success by the Mini∣stry at Home; and therefore sent the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> word, <HI>That he would continue with his Troops in the Army, provided he would give over the Siege of Quesnoy.</HI> Which Message the Prince re∣ceived with the Disdain it deserv'd; and answer'd, <HI>That instead of putting a stop to that Siege, he would let his Grace see</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
<HI>he would soon be Master of it, and would after undertake another Expedition, that should be of greater Moment;</HI> the former of which he soon after fulfilled.</P>
<P>From this time all Correspondence ceased between the Prince and the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> General, and time it was; for the frequent Expresses that went and came between the Duke and the <HI>French</HI> Ar∣my, did not promise any good to the Confederate Cause; and the Prince ex∣press'd himself very willing to be rid of them, whom he look'd on only as a Burthen to the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> since they had declared they would not act against <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Auxilliaries refusing to March off with the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> gave great uneasiness to the <HI>French,</HI> because it render'd the loss of <HI>Quesnoy</HI> inevita∣ble; and the Sollicitations and Impor∣tunities from thence, made the <HI>British</HI> Ministers sharers in their Concern. The Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> then in <HI>England,</HI> was dispatched over with smart Orders toward accomplishing their Measures; who being come to the <HI>Hague,</HI> had se∣veral Conferences with the States on
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
the Subject in hand, <HI>viz.</HI> the Suspen∣sion of Arms; and tho' he talk'd in a Language somewhat natural to him, and sometimes condescended to soften his Voice, yet neither had any effect on the resolute <HI>Dutch,</HI> who being Masters of <HI>Quesnoy,</HI> and assured of the Foreign Troops, thought themselves in a Con∣dition to tell him in plain Terms, <HI>That they could not agree to a Cessation of Arms, without the Ʋnanimous Consent of all their Allies.</HI> Which made the <HI>British</HI> Ambassador reply with some heat, <HI>That he would go to the Army and execute his Orders.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> still continued in his former Camp, expecting the Issue of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>'s Negotia∣tions at the <HI>Hague,</HI> or his Company in the Army, to help him out of the Labyrinth he seemed to be got into; where he found it high time to sepa∣rate the <HI>British</HI> Forces from the <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI> between whom there was a great Animosity, and frequent Duels were fought among the Officers and Soldiers, and many were killed on both sides; for the Name of an <HI>English</HI> Man, once held in the highest esteem
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
among Foreigners, began now to be a Name of Reproach. But the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> finding he was not like to succeed better here than at the <HI>Hague,</HI> attempted nothing, but what private Orders he gave to the the <HI>British</HI> Gene∣ral, or what he transacted with Mar∣shal <HI>Villars,</HI> to whose Camp, our Ac∣counts at that time made out that he went <HI>Incognito.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> having resolved in a general Council to undertake the Siege of <HI>Landrecy,</HI> gave the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> notice, <HI>That he designed to March the next Day, both for want of Forage, and to prosecute the Operations of the Campaign; and if his Grace intended to do the like, his Highness was ready to con∣ser with him in what Place soever the Duke should appoint.</HI> The Duke answer'd in Writing, <HI>That he thought it strange such a Message should be sent to him by an ordi∣nary Aid de Camp, and that only Twelve Hours before, the Prince was to March, because no Measures had been concerted be∣tween them, relating either to their Motions, or to any further Ʋndertaking; for which Reasons his Highness ought not to expect that he should accompany him, or be assisting in</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
<HI>any Opperations wherein he had not been previously consulted.</HI></P>
<P>This was only looked on as a matter of Form, and a specious Pretence for marching away. Accordingly on the 16th of <HI>July,</HI> a Day which will ever be famous in History for the Separation of the Confederate Army, and decla∣ring <HI>The Fatal Cessation of Arms.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> broke up first from his Camp at <HI>Haspre,</HI> and March∣ed off with the Troops under his Com∣mand, being followed by all the <HI>Danes, Prussians, Saxons, Hanoverians,</HI> and other Auxilliaries in <HI>British</HI> Pay, ex∣cept Four Squadrons of <HI>Vandarnath,</HI> and a Battalion of <HI>Berner,</HI> and <HI>Walef</HI>'s Regiment of Dragoons: He Encamp∣ed the fame Night at <HI>Atre</HI> near <HI>Lan∣drecy,</HI> which Place he immediately In∣vested.</P>
<P>The <HI>British</HI> General Decamped the same Morning, and in his March caused a <HI>Cessation of Arms</HI> to be Proclaimed for Two Months, between the Queen's Forces and those of <HI>France;</HI> at which the Troops were so far from Rejoycing,
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
that they cou'd not forbear shewing the utmost concern at Parting; and it is agreed, that it was not without Tears among several of the Officers and Soldiers, who had been longest to∣gether. The same Evening Marshal <HI>de Villars</HI> sent an <HI>Aid de Camp</HI> to ac∣quaint the Duke that he had that Day likewise declared a Suspension of Arms, with Her <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesties Troops, pursuant to <HI>the Agreement settled with his Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>British</HI> Ministry had not compleated the Drudgery they were doing for <HI>France,</HI> and performed all they had Covenanted for; yet as they had acted like good Boys, and shewn a willingness to go through stitch, it was resolved to keep them in Counte∣nance, and a shew was made of put∣ting them in Possession of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and some Troops were sent from <HI>England</HI> to be put in Possession; but on such precarious Security, as that if we had failed in the Performances expected, the Bargain was yet to be disputed; for the Sloops, Gallies, and Marines were allowed to stay in the Town, a
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
Number more than equal to the Forces we had sent thither.</P>
<P>There were Views by which we might make sufficient amends to <HI>France,</HI> for leaving the Auxilliaries in the Ser∣vice of the Confederates, a well as for the Loss of <HI>Quesnoy;</HI> their Army being March'd to a good distance, and the Duke having all the Country open to him, might in his March secure <HI>Douay,</HI> or <HI>Tournay,</HI> which would make up the Equivalent for the sole Possession of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> but this the wise Precautions of the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Generals, had prevented, by refusing the <HI>English</HI> Passage through them; For it is to be observed that the Duke could not now spare Ten Battalions to March to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> as they were once design'd; tho' unless, upon such Occasion as Securing these, or some other Towns, it can't be imagined what use he could have for 12 or 14000 Men, who had declared a Suspension of Arms with the <HI>French,</HI> and was at perfect Tranquility with the whole Country.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37"/>
It is easy to deny that they had such a Design as Seizing <HI>Douay</HI> or <HI>Tournay,</HI> because the Occasion cuts of all manner of Proof; but it is certainly plain, that if this miscarried, <HI>Bruges</HI> and <HI>Ghent</HI> were to serve the turn. And that this was concerted with the Marshal <HI>de Villars</HI> in his Camp, before the <HI>Cessation of Arms</HI> was proclaimed, is no less True than surprizingly Treacherous; by which means the <HI>English</HI> Troops making themselves Masters of the Na∣vigation of the <HI>Lys</HI> and the <HI>Schelde,</HI> would be able to put an effectual stop to any farther Progress of the Confede∣rate Army, in case the <HI>French</HI> General should find it impracticable to relieve <HI>Landrecy.</HI> This was called one of the most glorious and best concerted Pro∣jects that ever was laid; and I have heard, that to rob the Earl of <HI>Str—d</HI> of the Honour of having concerted it with Marshal <HI>Villars,</HI> some of the Mi∣nistry were so fond of it, as to claim the sole Invention of it; and indeed it seems very natural to be ascribed to them, it is so much of a piece with the rest of their tricking and perfiddious Conduct. By this good Office we were
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
admitted to the sole Possession of <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI> and six Battalions were now sent from the Army to be put into the Place; who had before March'd so many Leagues a quite contrary way.</P>
<P>This Transaction gave a little Ease to the <HI>British</HI> Court, and they look'd upon themselves now as perfectly Ma∣sters of the Negotiations of Peace; which was their chief aim. Her Ma∣jesty, as they termed it, being fully resolved not to depart from the Scheme she had laid down, whatever was the Consequence, and indeed the Conse∣quence was fatal enough; the ruin of the Confederacy, and of the Trade and Welfare of <HI>Britain</HI> having been the Issue of it; and from which no human Re∣lief could be expected, but the season∣able, and almost unexpected Blessing of his Majesty's happy Accession to the Throne.</P>
<P>What follow'd of the Campaign our Enemies will tell with Pleasure.—I shall only observe farther, that it af∣forded the <HI>British</HI> Ministers a great deal of Pleasure, to see <HI>France</HI> triumph o∣ver
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
the Allies; and that they acted a more domineering part in the Negocia∣tion of Peace than ever; insisted on the admission of King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Pleni∣potentiary, or threaten'd to remove the Congress from <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> to some Town where they might come with∣out opposition; with several other marks of their great Authority. But as I am not of the subject of Peace, I shall mention it no farther.</P>
<P>I am now come to the last Treasona∣ble step of <HI>The fatal Cessation of Arms:</HI> What was before called the <HI>Suspension of Arms,</HI> Proclaimed in the Army, ha∣ving had an Effect so welcome to the Contrivers, being near expiring, it was judged necessary to prolong it; for which end <HI>B—ke,</HI> who had had the greatest Hand in all the Vil∣lainous Management, was pitched on to go to the Court of <HI>France</HI> incog∣nito, both to prolong the <HI>Cessation of Arms,</HI> and to settle some important Points yet depending to put the finish∣ing Hand to the Ruin of his Country. Accordingly, with his Under Secretary <HI>Hare,</HI> Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> and the Abbot <HI>Gaul∣tier,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
he set out for <HI>France</HI> the begin∣ning of <HI>August.</HI> I need not tell you of the Grand Reception he met with there, it has been too much talked of already; and the Obligations the <HI>French</HI> lay un∣der to him, were of much greater va∣lue to them, than the <HI>Briliant</HI> which was the Price of his Journey thither; his Services being repaid in a more Li∣beral and Private way.</P>
<P>Let me give him the just Infamy of Agreeing the <HI>fatal Cessation;</HI> of his Conferring with the Queen Dowager of <HI>England;</HI> and his Interview with the Pretender; with other Points and Overtacts of Treason that fall to his single share in the general Ruin and Prejudice acquired to his Country: Which the Parliament has generously promised to bring him and others to <HI>Condign Punishment</HI> for, from the Guilt of which he is now fled.</P>
<P>I believe, that whoever Reads the History of this Campaign, and of the steps to <HI>The Fatal Cessation of Arms,</HI> the Source and Origin of all our Mis∣fortunes, will very little doubt the
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
Proof which a certain Great Person in Parliament has affirmed to be in his Hands, <HI>viz. That the</HI> British General, <HI>for several Months before the Terms of Peace were known or concluded, had pri∣vate Orders to regulate his Conduct accor∣ding to the Instructions he should receive from the General of</HI> France; which is the only Evidence wanting to make good a Charge of High Treason against Those who either advised their Sove∣raign (or durst of themselves) to send Orders of such a heinous Nature. No∣thing being wanting but to see whe∣ther any of the rest concerned in this Traiterous Management have Courage enough to stand the Test.</P>
