<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A Great part of the poetical works of Mr.
SHENSTONE, particularly his Elegies and
Pastorals, are (as he himself expresses it) “ The
exact transcripts of the situation of his own
mind;” and abound in frequent allusions to his
own place, the beautiful scene of his retirement
from the world. Exclusively therefore of our
natural curiosity to be acquainted with the
history of an author, whose works we peruse with
pleasure, some short account of Mr. SHENSTONE'S
personal character, and situation in life, may not
only be agreeable, but absolutely necessary, to
the reader; as it is impossible he should enter
into the true spirit of his writings, if he is en∣tirely
ignorant of those circumstances of his life,
which sometimes so greatly influenced his re∣flections.</P>
<P>I could wish however that this task had been
allotted to some person capable of performing it
in that masterly manner which the subject so
<PB N="ii" REF="5"/>
well deserves. To confess the truth, it was
chiefly to prevent his remains from falling into
the hands of any one still less qualified to do
him justice, that I have unwillingly ventured to
undertake the publication of them myself.</P>
<P>Mr. SHENSTONE was the eldest son of a
plain uneducated country gentleman in SHROP∣SHIRE,
who farmed his own estate. The father,
sensible of his son's extraordinary capacity, re∣solved
to give him a learned education, and
sent him a commoner to PEMBROKE College
in OXFORD, designing him for the church: but
tho' he had the most aweful notions of the
wisdom, power, and goodness of God, he never
could be persuaded to enter into orders. In
his private opinions he adhered to no particular
sect, and hated all religious disputes. But
whatever were his own sentiments, he always
shewed great tenderness to those, who differed
from him, Tenderness, indeed, in every sense
of the word, was his peculiar characteristic;
his friends, his domestics, his poor neighbours,
all daily experienced his benevolent turn of mind.
Indeed, this virtue in him was often carried to
such excess, that it sometimes bordered upon
<PB N="iii" REF="6"/>
weakness: yet if he was convinced that any of
those ranked amongst the number of his friends,
had treated him ungenerously, he was not easily
reconciled. He used a maxim, however, on such
occasions, which is worthy of being observed
and imitated; “I never (said he) will be a
revengeful enemy; but I cannot, it is not in my
nature, to be half a friend.” He was in his
temper quite unsuspicious; but if suspicion was
once awakened in him, it was not laid asleep
again without difficulty.</P>
<P>He was no oeconomist; the generosity of his
temper prevented him from paying a proper
regard to the use of money: he exceeded there∣fore
the bounds of his paternal fortune, which
before he died was considerably encumbered. But
when one recollects the perfect paradise he had
raised around him, the hospitality, with which
he lived, his great indulgence to his servants,
his charities to the indigent, and all done with
an estate not more than three hundred pounds
a year, one should rather be led to wonder that
he lest any thing behind him, than to blame
his want of oeconomy. He left however more,
than sufficient to pay all his debts; and by his
<PB N="iv" REF="7"/>
will appropriated his whole estate for that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>It was perhaps from some considerations on
the narrowness of his fortune, that he forbore
to marry; for he was no enemy to wedlock,
had a high opinion of many among the fair sex,
was fond of their society, and no stranger to the
tenderest impressions. One, which he received
in his youth, was with difficulty surmounted.
The lady was the subject of that sweet pastoral,
in four parts, which has been so universally
admired; and which, one would have thought,
must have subdued the loftiest heart, and sof∣tened
the most obdurate.</P>
<P>His person, as to height, was above the
middle stature, but largely and rather inelegant∣ly
formed: his face seemed plain till you con∣versed
with him, and then it grew very pleasing.
In his dress he was negligent, even to a fault;
though when young, at the university, he was
accounted a BEAU. He wore his own hair,
which was quite grey very early, in a par∣ticular
manner; not from any affectation of sin∣gularity,
but from a maxim he had laid down, that
<PB N="v" REF="8"/>
without too slavish a regard to fashion, every
one should dress in a manner most suitable to his
own person and figure. In short, his faults
were only little blemishes, thrown in by nature,
as it were on purpose to prevent him from rising
too much above that level of imperfection al∣lotted
to humanity.</P>
<P>His character as a writer will be distinguished
by simplicity with elegance, and genius with
correctness. He had a sublimity equal to the
highest attempts; yet from the indolence of his
temper, he chose rather to amuse himself in
culling flowers at the foot of the mount, than to
take the trouble of climbing the more arduous
steeps of PARNASSUS. But whenever he was dis∣posed
to rise, his steps, tho' natural, were noble,
and always well supported. In the tenderness
of elegiac poetry he hath not been excelled; in
the simplicity of pastoral, one may venture to say
he had very few equals. Of great sensibility
himself, he never failed to engage the hearts
of his readers: and amidst the nicest attention
to the harmony of his numbers, he always took
care to express with propriety the sentiments
of an elegant mind. In all his writings, his
<PB N="vi" REF="9"/>
greatest difficulty was to please himself. I re∣member
a passage in one of his letters, where,
speaking of his love longs, he says—“Some
were written on occasions a good deal ima∣ginary,
others not so; and the reason there
are so many is, that I wanted to write ONE
good song, and could never please myself.”
It was this diffidence which occasioned him to
throw aside many of his pieces before he had
bestowed upon them his last touches. I have
suppressed several on this account; and if among
those which I have selected, there should be
discovered some little want of his finishing
polish, I hope it will be attributed to this cause,
and of course be excused: yet I flatter myself
there will always appear something well worthy
of having been preserved. And though I was
afraid of inserting what might injure the cha∣racter
of my friend, yet as the sketches of a
great master are always valuable, I was un∣willing
the public should lose any thing material
of so accomplished a writer. In this dilemma
it will easily be conceived that the task I had to
perform would become somewhat difficult. How
I have acquitted myself, the public must judge.
Nothing, however, except what he had al∣ready
<PB N="vii" REF="10"/>
published, has been admitted without the
advice of his most judicious friends, nothing
altered, without their particular concurrence.
It is impossible to please every one; but 'tis
hoped that no reader will be so unreasonable, as
to imagine that the author wrote solely for his
amusement: his talents were various; and
though it may perhaps be allowed that his ex∣cellence
chiefly appeared in subjects of tenderness
and simplicity, yet he frequently condescended
to trifle with those of humour and drollery:
these, indeed, he himself in some measure de∣graded
by the title which he gave them of LE∣VITIES:
but had they been entirely rejected,
the public would have been deprived of some
JEUX D'ESPRITS, excellent in their kind, and
Mr. SHENSTONE'S character as a writer would
have been but imperfectly exhibited.</P>
<P>But the talents of Mr. SHENSTONE were not
confined merely to poetry; his character, as a
man of clear judgment, and deep penetration,
will best appear from his prose works. It is
there we must search for the acuteness of his
understanding, and his profound knowledge of
the human heart. It is to be lamented indeed,
<PB N="viii" REF="11"/>
that some things here are unfinished, and can
be regarded only as fragments: many are left as
single thoughts, but which, like the sparks. of
diamonds, shew the richness of the mine to
which they belong; or like the foot of a HER∣CULES,
discover the uncommon strength, and
extraordinary dimenshions of that hero. I have
no apprehension of incurring blame from any
one, for preserving these valuable remains: they
will discover to every reader, the author's sen∣timents
on several important subjects. And
there can be very few, to whom they will not
impart many thoughts, which they would never
perhaps have been able to draw from the
source of their own reflections.</P>
<P>But I believe little need be said to recommend
the writings of this gentleman to public atten∣tion.
His character is already surfficiently esta∣blished.
And if he be not injured by the in∣ability
of his editor, there is no doubt but he
will ever maintain an eminent station among
the best of our English writers.</P>

<HEAD>A
PREFATORY ESSAY
ON
ELEGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is observable, that discourses <HI>prefixed</HI> to
poetry are contrived very frequently to inculcate
such tenets as may exhibit the performance to the
greatest advantage. The fabric is very commonly
raised in the <HI>first place,</HI> and the measures, by which we
are to judge of its merits are afterwards adjusted.</P>
<P>There have been few rules given us by the critics
concerning the structure of <HI>elegiac</HI> poetry; and far
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
be it from the author of the following trifles, to dig∣nisy
his own <HI>opinions</HI> with that <HI>denomination.</HI> He
would only intimate the great variety of <HI>subjects,</HI> and
the different<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This essay was written near twenty years ago.</NOTE> <HI>styles</HI> in which the writers of elegy
<HI>have</HI> hitherto indulged themselves, and endeavour to
shield the following ones by the latitude of <HI>their</HI> ex∣ample.</P>
<P>If we considcr the etymology of the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>particulam dolendi.</NOTE> <HI>word,</HI> the
epithet which<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Miserabiles elegos. HOR.</NOTE> <HI>HORACE</HI> gives it, or the confession
which<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heu nimis ex <HI>vero</HI> nunc tibi nomen erit.</NOTE> <HI>OVID</HI> makes concerning it, I think we may
<HI>conclude</HI> thus much however; that <HI>elegy,</HI> in its true
and genuine acceptation, <HI>includes</HI> a tender and que∣rulous
idea: that it looks upon <HI>this</HI> as its peculiar
characteristic, and so long as <HI>this</HI> is thoroughly sus∣tained,
admits of a variety of subjects; which by its
manner of treating them, it renders its own. It
throws its melancholy <HI>stole</HI> over pretty different ob∣jects,
which, like the dresses at a funeral procession,
gives them all a kind of solemn and uniform appear∣ance.</P>
<P>It is probable that elegies were written at <HI>first</HI> up∣on
the death of <HI>intimate friends</HI> and <HI>near relations;
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
celebrated beauties,</HI> or <HI>favourite mistresses; bene∣ficent
governors</HI> and <HI>illustrious men:</HI> one may add
perhaps, of all those, who are placed by <HI>VIRGIL</HI> in
the laurel-grove of his Elysium, (Vide <HI>HURD</HI>'s
Dissertation on <HI>HORACE</HI>'s Epistle)
<Q>Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo.</Q>
After these subjects were sufficiently exhausted, and
the severity of fate displayed in the most affecting in∣stances,
the poets sought occasion to vary their com∣plaints;
and the next tender species of sorrow that
presented itself, was the grief of <HI>absent</HI> or <HI>neglected</HI>
lovers. And this indulgence might be indeed allowed
them; but with <HI>this</HI> they were not contented. They
had obtained a small corner in the province of love,
and they took advantage, from thence, to over-run
the whole territory. They sung its spoils, triumphs,
evations, and rejoicings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dicite Io Paean, &amp; Io bis dicite Paean. OVID.</NOTE>, as well as the captivity and
exequies that attended it. They gave the name of <HI>elegy</HI>
to their pleasantries as well as lamentations; 'till at
last, through their abundant fondness for the <HI>myrtle,</HI>
they forgot that the <HI>cypress</HI> was <HI>their</HI> peculiar garland.</P>
<P>In this it is probable they deviated from the original
design of elegy; and it should seem, that any kind of
subjects, treated in such a manner as to diffuse a pleasing
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
melancholy, might far better deserve <HI>the name,</HI> than
the facetious mirth and libertine festivity of the suc∣cessful
votaries of love.</P>
<P>But not to dwell too long upon art opinion which may
<HI>seem</HI> perhaps introduced to favour the following per∣formance,
it may not be improper to examine into the
<HI>use</HI> and <HI>end</HI> of elegy. The most important end of <HI>all</HI>
poetry is to encourage virtue. <HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>tragedy</HI>
chiefly recommend the <HI>public</HI> virtues; <HI>elegy</HI> is of a
species which illustrates and endears the <HI>private.</HI>
There is a truly virtuous pleasure connected with many
pensive contemplations, which it is the province and
excellency of elegy to enforce. This, by presenting
suitable ideas, has discovered sweets in <HI>melancholy</HI>
which we could not find in <HI>mirth;</HI> and has led us
with success to the dusty <HI>urn,</HI> when we could draw
no pleasure from the sparkling bowl; as pastoral
conveys an idea of simplicity and innocence, it
is in particular the task and merit of elegy to shew
the innocence and simplicity of rural life to ad∣vantage;
and that, in a way distinct from <HI>pastoral,</HI>
as much as the plain but judicious landlord may be
imagined to surpass his tenant both in <HI>dignity</HI> and
<HI>understanding.</HI> It should also tend to elevate the
more tranquil virtues of <HI>humility, disinterestedness,
simplicity,</HI> and <HI>innocence:</HI> but then there is a <HI>de∣gree</HI>
of elegance and refinement, no way inconsistent
with these <HI>rural</HI> virtues; and that raises <HI>elegy</HI> above
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>
that <HI>merum rus,</HI> that <HI>unpolished</HI> rusticity, which
has given our <HI>pastoral</HI> writers their highest reputation.</P>
<P>Wealth and splendor will never want their proper
weight: the danger is, left they should too much pre∣ponderate.
A kind of poetry therefore which throws
its chief influence into the other scale, that magnifies
the sweets of liberty and independence, that <HI>endears</HI>
the honest <HI>delights</HI> of love and friendship, that <HI>cele∣brates</HI>
the <HI>glory</HI> of a good name after death, that ridi∣cules
the futile arrogance of birth, that recommends
the innocent amusement of letters, and insensibly pre∣pares
the mind for that humanity it <HI>inculcates, such</HI>
a kind of poetry may chance to please; and if it
please, should seem to be of service.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>style</HI> of elegy, it may be it well enough de∣termined
from what has gone before. It should imi∣tate
the voice and language of grief; or if a meta∣phor
of dress? be more agreeable, it should be simple
and diffuse, and flowing as a mourner's veil. A ver∣sification
therefore is desireable, which, by indulging
a free and unconstrained expression, may admit of that
simplicity which elegy requires.</P>
<P>Heroic metre, with alternate rhime, seems well
enough adapted to this species of poetry; and, how∣ever
exceptionable upon other occasions, its inconve∣niences
appear to lose their weight <HI>in shorter</HI> elegies;
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>
and its advantages seem to <HI>acquire</HI> an <HI>additional</HI> im∣portance.
The world has an admirable example of its
beauty in a collection of elegies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N. E. This preface was written near twenty years ago.</NOTE> <HI>not long</HI> since <HI>pub∣lished;</HI>
the product of a gentleman of the most exact
taste, and whose untimely death merits all the tears
that elegy can shed.</P>
<P>It is not impossible that some may think this metre
too lax and prosaic: others, that even a more dissolute
variety of numbers may have superior advantages.
And, in favour of these last, might be produced the
example of <HI>MILTON</HI> in his <HI>LYCIDAS,</HI> together with
one or two recent and beautiful imitations of his ver∣sification
in that monody. But this kind of argument,
I am apt to think, must prove <HI>too much;</HI> since the
writers I have in view seem capable enough of recom∣mending
any metre they shall chuse; though it must be
awned also, that the choice <HI>they</HI> make of any, is at
the same time the strongest presumption in its favour.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be no great difficulty to <HI>compromise</HI>
the dispute. There is no one kind of metre that is
distinguished by rhimes, but is liable to some objection or
other, Heroic verse, where every second line is ter∣minated
by a rhime, (with which the judgment re∣quires
that the <HI>sense</HI> should in some measure also termi∣nate)
is apt to render the expression either scanty or
<PB N="9" REF="19"/>
constrained. And this is sometimes observable in the
writings of a poet lately deceased; though I believe no
one ever threw so much sense together with so much
<HI>ease</HI> into a couplet as Mr. <HI>POPE.</HI> But as an air of
<HI>constraint</HI> too often accompanies this metre, it seems
by no means proper for a writer of <HI>elegy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>previous</HI> rhime in <HI>MILTON'S LYCIDAS</HI> is very
frequently placed at such a distance from the follow∣ing,
that it is often dropt by the memory (much better
employed in attending to the sentiment) before it be
brought to join its partner: and this seems to be the
greatest objection to <HI>that</HI> kind of versification. But
then the peculiar <HI>ease</HI> and <HI>variety</HI> it admits of, are no
doubt sufficient to overbalance the objection, and to
give it the preference to any other, in an elegy of
<HI>length.</HI></P>
<P>The chief exception to which <HI>stanza</HI> of all kinds is
liable, is, that it breaks the sense too <HI>regularly,</HI>
when it is continued through a long poem. And this
may be perhaps the fault of Mr. <HI>WALLER's</HI> excellent
panegyric. But if this fault be less discernible in
smaller compositions, as I suppose it <HI>is,</HI> I flatter my∣self,
that the advantages I have before mentioned re∣sulting
from alternate rhime (with which stanza is,
I think, connected) may; at least in <HI>shorter</HI> elegies,
be allowed to out-weigh its imperfections.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="20"/>
I shall say but little of the different <HI>kinds</HI> of elegy.
The melancholy of a lover is different, no doubt, from
what we feel on other mixed occasions. The mind in
which love and grief at once predominate, is softened
to an <HI>excess.</HI> Love-elegy therefore is more negligent
of order and design, and, being addressed chiefly to the
ladies, requires little more than tenderness and perspi∣cuity.
Elegies, that are formed upon promiscuous in∣cidents,
and addressed to the world in general, incul∣cate
some sort of moral, and admit a different degree
of reasoning, thought, and order.</P>
<P>The author of the following elegies entered on his
subjects <HI>occasionally,</HI> as particular incidents in life
<HI>suggested,</HI> or dispositions of mind <HI>recommended</HI>
them to his choice. If he describes a rural landskip,
or unfolds the train of sentiments it inspired, he fairly
drew his picture from the spot; and felt very sensibly
the affection he communicates. If he speaks of his
humble shed, his flocks and his fleeces, he does not coun∣terfeit
the scene; who having (whether through choice
or necessity, is not material) retired betimes to country∣solitudes,
and sought his happiness in rural employments,
has a right to consider himself as a real shepherd.
The flocks, the meadows, and the grottos, are <HI>his own,</HI>
and the embellishment of his <HI>farm</HI> his sole amusement.
As the sentiments therefore were inspired by nature,
and that in the earlier part of his life, he hopes they
will retain a natural appearance; diffusing at least
<PB N="11" REF="21"/>
some <HI>part</HI> of that amusement, which he freely acknow∣ledges
he received from the composition of them.</P>
<P>There will appear perhaps a real inconsistency in
the moral tenour of the several elegies; and the sub∣sequent
ones may sometimes seem a recantation of the
preceding. The reader will scarcely impute this to
oversight; but will allow, that men's opinions as well
as tempers vary; that neither public nor private,
active nor speculative life, are unexceptionably happy,
and consequently that any change of opinion concern∣ing
them may afford an additional beauty to poetry,
as it gives us a more striking representation of life.</P>
<P>If the author has hazarded, throughout, the use of
English or modern allusions, he hopes it will not be
imputed to an <HI>entire</HI> ignorance, or to the <HI>least</HI> disesteem
of the ancient learning. He has kept the ancient
<HI>plan</HI> and <HI>method</HI> in his eye, though he builds
his edifice with the materials of his own nation.
In other words, through a fondness for his native
country, he has made use of the flowers it produced,
though, in order to exhibit them to the greater ad∣vantage,
he has endeavoured to weave his garland by
the best model he could find: with what success, be∣yond
his own amusement, must be left to judges less
partial to him than either his acquaintance or his
friends.—If any of those should be so candid, as to
approve the variety of subjects he has chosen, and the
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>
tenderness of sentiment he has endeavoured to impress,
he begs the <HI>metre</HI> also may not be too suddenly con∣demned.
The public ear, habituated of late to a
quicker measure, may perhaps consider <HI>this</HI> as heavy
and languid; but an objection of that kind may gra∣dually
lose its force, if this measure should be allowed
to suit the nature of elegy.</P>
<P>If it should happen to be considered as an objection
with <HI>others,</HI> that there is too much of a moral cast
diffused through the whole; it is replied, that, he <HI>en∣deavoured</HI>
to animate the poetry so far as not to ren∣der
this objection too obvious; or to <HI>risque excluding</HI>
the fashionable reader: at the same time never de∣viating
from a fixed principle, that poetry without
morality is but the <HI>blossom</HI> of a <HI>fruit-tree.</HI> Poetry
is indeed like that species of plants, which may bear
at once both fruits and blossoms, and the tree is by no
means in perfection without the <HI>former,</HI> however it
may be embellished by the flowers which surround it.</P>

<L>Ye tender hearts and lovers dear;</L>
<L>Nor will you scorn to heave a sigh,</L>

<L>Young DAWSON was a gallant boy,</L>

<L>And dearly was he lov'd again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One tender maid, she lov'd him dear,</L>
<L>Of gentle blood the damsel came;</L>
<L>And faultess was her beauteous form,</L>
<L>And spotless was her virgin fame.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their colours, and their sash he wore,</L>
<L>And in the fatal dress was found;</L>
<L>And now he must that death endure,</L>
<L>Which gives the brave the keenest wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How pale was then his true-love's cheek,</L>
<L>When JEMMY'S sentence reach'd her ear!</L>
<L>For never yet did Alpine snows</L>
<L>So pale, or yet to chill appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With faultering voice, she weeping said,</L>
<L>Oh DAWSON, monarch of my heart;</L>
<L>Think not thy death shall end our loves,</L>
<L>For thou and I will never part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet might sweet mercy find a place,</L>

<L>O GEORGE, without a pray'r for thee,</L>
<L>My orisons should never close.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>And ravish'd was that constant heart,</L>

<L>Amid those unrelenting flames,</L>
<L>She bore this constant heart to see;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>My death, my death alone can shew</L>
<L>The pure, the lasting love I bore;</L>
<L>Accept, O heav'n! of woes like ours,</L>
<L>And let us, let us weep no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dismal scene was o'er and past,</L>
<L>The lover's mournful hearse retir'd;</L>
<L>The maid drew back her languid head,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' justice ever must prevail,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE to the Tragedy of CLEONE.</HEAD>
<L>WELL, ladies—so much for the tragic stile—</L>
<L>And now the custom is to make you smile.</L>
<L>To make us smile!—methinks I hear you say—</L>
<L>Why, who can help it, at so strange a play?</L>
<L>The captain gone three years!—and then to blame</L>
<L>The faultless conduct of his virtuous dame!</L>
<L>My stars!—what gentle belle would think it treason,</L>
<L>When thus provok'd, to give the brute some reason?</L>
<L>Out of my house!—this night, forsooth depart!</L>
<L>A modern wife had said—“With all my heart—</L>
<L>But think not, haughty Sir, I'll go alone!</L>
<L>Order your coach,—conduct me safe to town—</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="247"/>
Give me my jewels, wardrobe, and my maid—</L>
<L>And pray take care my pin-money be paid.”</L>
<L>Such is the language of each modish fair!</L>
<L>Yet memoirs, not of modern growth, declare</L>
<L>The time has been when modesty and truth</L>
<L>Were deem'd additions to the charms of youth;</L>
<L>When women hid their necks, and veil'd their faces,</L>
<L>Nor romp'd, nor rak'd, nor star'd at public places,</L>
<L>Nor took the airs of amazons for graces:</L>
<L>Then plain domestic virtues were the mode,</L>
<L>And wives ne'er dreamt of happiness abroad;</L>
<L>They lov'd their children, learnt no flaunting airs,</L>
<L>But with the joys of wedlock mixt the cares.</L>
<L>Those times are past—yet sure they merit praise,</L>
<L>For marriage triumph'd in those golden days:</L>
<L>By chaste decorum they affection gain'd;</L>
<L>By faith and fondness what they won, maintain'd.</L>
<L>'Tis yours, ye fair, to bring those days agen,</L>
<L>And form anew the hearts of thoughtless men;</L>
<L>Make beauty's lustre amiable as bright,</L>
<L>And give the soul, as well as sense, delight;</L>
<L>Reclaim from folly a fantastic age,</L>
<L>That scorns the press, the pulpit, and the stage.</L>
<L>Let truth and tenderness your breasts adorn,</L>
<L>The marriage chain with transport shall be worn;</L>

Soon, if none check th' invasive foe's designs,</L>

<L>'Tis thus, the spring of youth, the morn of life,</L>

<L>Then passion riots, reason then contends;</L>

At once, before his wond'ring eyes were seen</L>
<L>Two female forms, of more than mortal mien.</L>
<L>Various their charms; and, in their dress and face,</L>
<L>Each seem'd to vie with some peculiar grace.</L>
<L>This, whose attire less clogg'd. with art appear'd,</L>
<L>The simple sweets of innocence endear'd.</L>
<L>Her sprightly bloom, her quick sagacious eye,</L>
<L>Shew'd native merit mix'd with modesty.</L>
<L>Her air diffus'd a mild yet aweful ray,</L>
<L>Severely sweet, and innocently gay.</L>
<L>Such the chaste image of the martial maid,</L>
<L>In artless folds of virgin white array'd!</L>
<L>She let no borrow'd rose her cheeks adorn,</L>
<L>Her blushing cheeks, that sham'd the purple morn.</L>
<L>Her charms nor had, nor wanted artful foils,</L>
<L>Or study'd gestures, or well-practis'd smiles.</L>
<L>She scorn'd the toys which render beauty less;</L>
<L>She prov'd th' engaging chastity of dress;</L>
<L>And while she chose in native charms to shine,</L>
<L>Ev'n thus she seem'd, nay more than seem'd, divine.</L>
<L>One modest em'rald clasp'd the robe she wore,</L>

<L>Sublime her height, majestic was her pace,</L>
<L>And match'd the aweful honours of her face.</L>
<L>The shrubs, the flow'rs, that deck'd the verdant ground,</L>

So strikes the gazer's eye, the silver gleam</L>
<L>That glitt'ring quivers o'er a distant stream:</L>
<L>But from its banks we see new beauties rise,</L>
<L>And, in its crystal bosom, trace the skies.</L>
<L>With other charms the rival vision glow'd;</L>
<L>And from her dress her tinsel beauties flow'd.</L>
<L>A flutt'ring robe her pamper'd shape conceal'd,</L>

<L>Its form, contriv'd her faulty size to grace;</L>
<L>Its hue, to give fresh lustre to her face.</L>

<L>Her cheeks the ruby's neighb'ring lustre shar'd;</L>
<L>The gawdy topaz lent its gay supplies,</L>

<L>Center'd in that, and were to that confin'd;</L>
<L>And if on other's eyes a glance were thrown,</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What particulars in Spenser, were imagined most proper for
the author's imitation on this occasion, are his language,
his simplicity, his manner of description, and a peculiar
tenderness of sentiment remarkable throughout his works.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AH me! full sorely is my heart forlorn,</L>
<L>To think how modest worth neglected lies;</L>
<L>While partial fame doth with her blasts adorn;</L>
<L>Such deeds alone, as pride and pomp disguise;</L>
<L>Deeds of ill sort, and mischievous emprize!</L>
<L>Lend me thy clarion, goddess! let me try</L>
<L>To sound the praise of merit, ere it dies;</L>
<L>Such as I oft have chaunced to espy,</L>
<L>Lost in the dreary shades of dull obscurity.</L>

<PB N="334" REF="340"/>
<L>In ev'ry village mark'd with little spire,</L>
<L>Embow'r'd in trees, and hardly known to fame,</L>
<L>There dwells, in lowly shed, and mean attire,</L>
<L>A matron old, whom we school-mistress name;</L>
<L>Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame;</L>
<L>They grieven sore, in piteous durance pent,</L>
<L>Aw'd by the pow'r of this relentless dame;</L>
<L>And oft-times, on vagaries idly bent,</L>
<L>For unkempt hair, or talk unconn'd, are sorely shent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And all in sight doth rise a birchen tree,</L>
<L>Which learning near her little dome did stowe;</L>
<L>Whilom a twig of small regard to see,</L>
<L>Tho' now so wide its waving branches flow;</L>
<L>And work the simple vassals mickle woe;</L>
<L>For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew,</L>
<L>But their limbs shudder'd, and their pulse beat low;</L>
<L>And, as they look'd, they found their horror grew,</L>
<L>And shap'd it into rods, and tingled at the view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So have I seen (who has not, may conceive,)</L>
<L>A liseless phantom near a garden plac'd;</L>
<L>So doth it wanton birds of peace bereave,</L>
<L>Of sport, of song, of pleasure, of repait;</L>
<L>They start, they stare, they wheel, they look aghast:</L>
<L>Sad servitude! such comfortless annoy</L>
<L>May no bold Briton's riper age e'er taste!</L>
<L>Ne superstition clog his dance of joy,</L>
<L>Ne vision empty, vain, his native bliss destroy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="335" REF="341"/>
<L>Near to this dome is found a patch so green,</L>
<L>On which the tribe their gambols do display;</L>
<L>And at the door impris'ning board is seen,</L>
<L>Lest weakly wights of smaller size should stray;</L>
<L>Eager, perdie, to bask in sunny day!</L>
<L>The noises intermix'd, which thence resound,</L>
<L>Do learning's little tenement betray:</L>
<L>Where sits the dame, disguis'd in look profound,</L>
<L>And eyes her fairy throng, and turns her wheel around.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her cap, far whiter than the driven snow,</L>
<L>Emblem right meet of decency does yield:</L>
<L>Her apron dy'd in grain, as blue, I trowe,</L>
<L>As is the hare-bell that adorns the field:</L>
<L>And in her hand, for scepter, she does wield</L>
<L>Tway birchen sprays; with anxious fear entwin'd,</L>
<L>With dark distrust, and sad repentance fill'd;</L>
<L>And stedfast hate, and sharp affliction join'd,</L>
<L>And fury uncontroul'd, and chastisement unkind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Few hut have ken'd, in semblance meet pourtray'd,</L>
<L>The childish faces of old Eol's train;</L>
<L>LIBS, NOTUS, AUSTER: these in frowns array'd,</L>
<L>How then would fare or earth, or sky, or main,</L>
<L>Were the stern god to give his slaves the rein?</L>
<L>And were not she rebellious breasts to quell,</L>
<L>And were not she her statutes to maintain,</L>
<L>The cott no more, I ween, were deem'd the cell,</L>
<L>Where comely peace of mind, and decent order dwell.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
<L>A russet stole was o'er her shoulders thrown;</L>
<L>A russet kirtle fenc'd the nipping air;</L>
<L>'Twas simple russet, but it was her own;</L>
<L>'Twas her own country bred the flock so fair;</L>
<L>'Twas her own labour did the fleece prepare;</L>
<L>And, sooth to say, her pupils, rang'd around,</L>
<L>Thro' pious awe, did term it passing rare;</L>
<L>For they in gaping wonderment abound,</L>
<L>And think, no doubt, shebeenthegreatestwightonground</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Albeit ne flatt'ry did corrupt her truth,</L>
<L>Ne pompous title did debauch her ear;</L>
<L>Goody, good-woman, gossip, n'aunt, forsooth,</L>
<L>Or dame, the sole additions she did hear;</L>
<L>Yet these she challeng'd, these she held right dear:</L>
<L>Ne would esteem him act as mought behove,</L>
<L>Who should not honour'd eld with these revere:</L>
<L>For never title yet so mean could prove,</L>
<L>But there was eke a mind which did that title love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One ancient hen she took delight to feed,</L>
<L>The plodding pattern of the busy dame;</L>
<L>Which, ever and anon, impell'd by need,</L>
<L>Into her school, begirt with chickens, came;</L>
<L>Such favour did her past deportment claim:</L>
<L>And, if neglect had lavish'd on the ground▪</L>
<L>Fragment of bread, she would collect the same;</L>
<L>For well she knew, and quaintly could expound,</L>
<L>What sin it were to waste the smallest crumb she found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="337" REF="343"/>
<L>Herbs too she knew, and well of each could speak</L>
<L>That in her garden sip'd the silv'ry dew;</L>
<L>Where no vain flow'r disclos'd a gawdy streak;</L>
<L>But herbs for use, and physick, not a few,</L>
<L>Of grey renown, within those borders grew:</L>
<L>The tufted basil, pun-provoking thyme,</L>
<L>Fresh baum, and mary-gold of chearful hue;</L>
<L>The lowly gill, that never dares to climb;</L>
<L>And more I fain would sing, disdaining here to rhyme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet euphrasy may not be left unsung,</L>
<L>That gives dim eyes to wander leagues around;</L>
<L>And pungent radish, biting infant's tongue;</L>
<L>And plantain ribb'd, that heals the reaper's wound;</L>
<L>And marj'ram sweet, in shepherd's posie found;</L>
<L>And lavender, whose spikes of azure bloom</L>
<L>Shall be, ere-while, in arid bundles bound,</L>
<L>To lurk amidst the labours of her loom,</L>
<L>Andcrownherkerchiefs clean, with micklerare perfume.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And here trim rosmarine, that whilom crown'd</L>
<L>The daintiest garden of the proudest peer;</L>
<L>Ere, driven from its envy'd site, it found</L>
<L>A sacred shelter for its branches here;</L>
<L>Where edg'd with gold its glitt'ring skirts appear.</L>
<L>Oh wassel days; O customs meet and well!</L>
<L>Ere this was banish'd from its lofty sphere:</L>
<L>Simplicity then sought this humble cell,</L>
<L>Nor ever would she more with thane and lordling dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="338" REF="344"/>
<L>Here oft the dame, on sabbath's decent eve,</L>
<L>Hymned such psalms as STERNHOLD forth did mete,</L>
<L>If winter 'twere, she to her hearth did cleave;</L>
<L>But in her garden found a sumrner seat:</L>
<L>Sweet melody! to hear her then repeat</L>
<L>How ISRAEL'S sons, beneath a foreign king,</L>
<L>While taunting foe-men did a song intreat,</L>
<L>All, for the nonce, untuning ev'ry string,</L>
<L>Up hung their useless lyres—small heart had they to sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For she was just, and friend to virtuous lore,</L>
<L>And pass'd much time in truly virtuous deed;</L>
<L>And, in those elfins' ears, would oft deplore</L>
<L>The times, when truth by popish rage did bleed;</L>
<L>And tortious death was true devotion's meed;</L>
<L>And simple faith in iron chains did mourn,</L>
<L>That nould on wooden image place her creed;</L>
<L>And lawny saints in smould'ring flames did burn:</L>
<L>Ah! dearestLord, forefend, thilk days mould e'er return.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In elbow chair, like that of Scottish stem</L>
<L>By the sharp tooth of cank'ring eld defac'd,</L>
<L>In which, when he receives his diadem,</L>
<L>Our sovereign prince and liefest liege is plac'd,</L>
<L>The matron sate; and some with rank she grac'd,</L>
<L>(The source of children's and of courtier's pride!)</L>
<L>Redress'd affronts, for vile affronts there pass'd;</L>
<L>And warn'd them not the fretful to deride,</L>

<L>Right well she knew each temper to descry;</L>
<L>To thwart the proud, and the submiss to raise;</L>
<L>Some with vile copper prize exalt on high,</L>
<L>And some entice with pittance small of praise;</L>
<L>And other some with baleful sprig she 'frays:</L>
<L>Ev'n absent, she the reins of pow'r doth hold,</L>

<L>O ruthful scene! when from a nook obscure,</L>
<L>His little sister doth his peril see:</L>
<L>All playful as she sate, she grows demure;</L>
<L>She finds full soon her wonted spirits flee;</L>
<L>She meditates a pray'r to set him free:</L>
<L>Nor gentle pardon could this dame deny,</L>
<L>(If gentle pardon could with dames agree)</L>

<L>On thee she calls, on thee her parent dear!</L>
<L>(Ah! too remote to ward the shameful blow!)</L>
<L>She sees no kind domestic visage near,</L>

<L>But ah! what pen his piteous plight may trace?</L>
<L>Or what device his loud laments explain?</L>
