<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What whim is this, Maria? Why do you fly from me at such a rate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous Question!—So sanguine, so successful a Lover as Captain Bellafont is might have concluded, that no Woman can have any other Motive for flying from him, but the Pleasure of being pursued.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! your most humble Servant.—But really I am no match for you at these Weapons: The Dance you have led me over Hedge and Ditch, across that Walk, down the next, over this Field, round the other, might be good Sport to a slender, well-breath'd Stripling of a Lover; but to your Adorer, who is somewhat corpu∣lent, it is actually intolerable; and I do protest to you, that if you offer to stir a Step further, I will ab∣solutely give over the Chace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Insufferable! Will no Submission satisfy you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was your Flight a Proof of your Submission, I might be satisfied; but I doubt that little rebellious Heart of yours will not be subdued upon such easy Terms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon easy Terms, depend on it I never shall sub∣mit: I have observ'd so little Complaisance after Mar∣riage, that I shall look to receive all my Portion of it before.</P>

<LG>
<L>Happy, trif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, careless Lover!</L>
<L>Think not you can touch my Heart,</L>
<L>'Till your Sighs your Tears discover</L>
<L>That you feel Love's keenest Dart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<L>When I see thee humbly lying</L>
<L>Captive of my conquering Eyes,</L>
<L>Weeping, sighing, fainting, dying,</L>
<L>Such Submission may suffice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So severe the Lover's Duty,</L>
<L>Such the Trophies due to Beauty.</L>
</LG>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>In short, Mr. Bellafont, as you are so much de∣voted to your Ease, and I am so great a Lover of my Freedom, I fear we can never conveniently meet. I will venture, therefore, to take my Leave of you.—If you think fit to repose yourself after your Fatigues, I wou'd recommend a Seat in that Arbour to you; or, if you rather chuse to take a solitary turn down that Walk, I promise you I will not interrupt your Medi∣tations.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, I beseech thee, Maria, if it is only 'till I can tell thee, that in Spite of all this cruel Indifference I am destined to adore thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is extremely well; but to be serious for a Moment.—Allow me to ask you what reasonable hope you can have that my Father will ever approve of your Pretensions? and without his Consent, I am apt to believe I shall never be desperate enough to listen to your Addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Maria, seriously I have no one Reason for hoping, but that I never in my Life cou'd de∣spond; nor have I any Excuse for the Folly of per∣severing in my Addresses, except that I love you,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
and have naturally a Passion for all extravagant At∣tempts. A Soldier of Fortune, the needy Son of a younger Brother, however noble his Extraction, can as ill expect to succeed with a Father of Sir Antony Withers's sort, as think of aspiring to a Lady of Maria's Merit and Beauty.—To delineate myself to you in one Word; my Family is noble; my Profes∣sion more so; if I was not a Man of Honour I shou'd not be the Descendent of my Father, and if I was a Coward I cou'd not be a Briton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me, Bellafont, this may be Recommendation sufficient; but my Father would ask, <Q>“What are your Possessions? where lies your Estate?”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have none: after having assisted our Conquests in every Quarter of the World, I must confess that there is not one Foot of it which I can call my own: my Patrimony is my Sword.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very honourable Inheritance for a single Gentle∣man, but a mighty indifferent Jointure for a Wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLAFONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had I the Possessions of my Uncle Lord Loving∣ton, I should with Pleasure cast them at your Feet; but a Booby Cousin excludes my Hopes there; and I reap no other Fruit from his Alliance, than the Con∣solation to see that Avarice can make the richest Man as indigent, as Fortune has made me.—But what avails all this?—I forget it is to Maria I am speaking, who has the Art to destroy the Peace of my Bosom, without endangering her own.</P>

<P>What do I hear? Was Frederick, was young Withers thus ingrateful, thus insensible? Let me hope, Amelia, there is some Misapprehension in this Matter: I know his Intimacy with your Brother, and that he made him a Visit this Summer of some Continuance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was then, Madam, that my poor Bosom lost that peaceful Indifference it had ever before enjoyed. My Family were then in Treaty with the Person I men∣tioned to you before: intoxicated with his extravagant offers, they omitted no Measures to engage me to ac∣cept his Addresses; nay they were desperate enough to employ Frederick to solicit me: but alas! their Advocate ruined their Cause; my Heart first con∣ceived a Distaste to Lord Wealthy, and the Interposi∣tion of Young Withers confirm'd me in my Aver∣sion.</P>

<P>But did Frederick betray his Commission by turning it to his own Advantage?</P>

<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot charge him with that Dishonour; therein I must condemn myself: it was my own fond un∣guarded Heart that told him too plainly what it felt; till one fatal moment my Father surpriz'd him kneel∣ing at my Feet, and the next transported him from my Sight for ever.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, how kindly you console me! I own to you I have some Hopes that Frederick still remembers me, and still loves me: those Hopes conducted me hither; I find he is this Day expected home; this Event and Sir Antony's ridiculous Assiduities make it no longer possible for me to conceal myself at his Tenant's. I must therefore retire till by some means I can discover the real State of Frederick's Heart. What I have to entreat of you, Madam, is, for a short Time to afford me the Protection of your House.</P>

If you are the Man of Honour I esteem you to be, you will approve yourself such on this delicate Occasion, and restore her to her Family without delay. On these Conditions I am bid to tell you, that you will be received with open Arms; your Affections will be no longer combated, but Amelia may be honourably yours.—The Alternative I forbear to mention, because I will not suppose my∣self otherwise than your faithful and affectionate Friend</Q></P>

That Captain Bellafont was Heir to his Title and Fortune, and that an Express had been sent after him to Salisbury, where he had lately been upon the breaking of his Regiment.”</Q></P>
