<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Traits of Eccentricity.</HEAD>
<P>THUS passed the first eight days of the Tunbridge
excursion, and another week succeeded without any va∣rying
event.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now, impelled with concern for Ca∣milla,
and resentment against Edgar, renewed the sub∣ject
of her opinion and advice upon his character and
conduct. “My dear young friend,” cried she, “I
cannot bear to see your days, your views, your feelings,
thus fruitlessly consumed: I have observed this young
man narrowly, and I am convinced he is not worth your
consideration.”</P>
<P>Camilla, deeply colouring, was beginning to assure her
she had no need of this counsel; but Mrs. Arlbery, not
listening, continued.</P>
<P>“I know what you must say; yet, once more, I
cannot refrain venturing at the liberty of lending you my
experience. Turn your mind from him with all the
expedition in your power, or its peace may be touched
for the better half of your life. You do not see, he
does not, perhaps, himself know how exactly he
is calculated to make you wretched. He is a watcher;
and a watcher, restless and perturbed himself, infests
all he pursues with uneasiness. He is without trust,
and therefore without either courage or consistency.
To-day he may be persuaded you will make all his hap∣piness
<PB N="202" REF="3"/>
to-morrow, he may fear you will give him no∣thing
but misery. Yet it is not that he is jealous of
any other; 'tis of the object of his choice he is jealous,
lest she should not prove good enough to merit it. Such
a man, after long wavering, and losing probable happi∣ness
in the terror of possible disappointment, will either
die an old batchelor, with endless repinings at his own
lingering fastidiousness, or else marry just at the eve of
confinement for life, from a fit of the gout. He then
makes, on a sudden, the first prudent choice in his way;
a choice no longer difficult, but from the embarrassment
of its ease; for she must have no beauty, lest she should
be sought by others, no wit, lest others should be sought
by herself; and no fortune, lest she should bring with
it a taste of independence, that might curb his own will,
when the strength and spirit are gone with which he
might have curbed her's.”</P>
<P>Camilla attempted to laugh at this portrait; but Mrs.
Arlbery intreated her to consider it as faithful and ex∣act.
“You have thought of him too much,” cried she,
“to do justice to any other, or you would not, with
such perfect unconcern, pass by your daily increasing in∣fluence
with Sir Sedley Clarendel.”</P>
<P>Excessively, and very seriously offended, Camilla
earnestly besought to be spared any hints of such a na∣ture.</P>
<P>“I know well,” cried she, “how repugnant to se∣venteen
is every idea of life that is rational. Let us,
therefore, set aside, in our discussions, any thing so
really beneficial, as a solid connection formed with a
view to the worldly comforts of existence and speak of
Sir Sedley's devoirs merely as the instrument of teaching
Mandlebert, that he is not the only rich, young, and hand∣some
man in this lower sphere, who has viewed Miss
Camilla Tyrold with complacency. Clarendel, it is
true, would lose every charm in my estimation by lofing
his heart; for the earth holds nothing comparable for
deadness of weight, with a poor soul really in love—
except when it happens to be with oneself!—yet, to
alarm the selfish irresolution of that impenetrable Man∣dlebert,
<PB N="203" REF="4"/>
I should really delight to behold him complete∣ly
caught.”</P>
<P>Camilla, distressed and confused, sought to parry the
whole as raillery: but Mrs. Arlbery would not be
turned aside from her subject and purpose, “I languish,
I own,” cried she, “to see that frozen youth worked
up into a little sensibility. I have an instinctive aver∣sion
to those cold, haughty, drawing-back characters,
who are made up of the egotism of looking out for some∣thing
that is wholly devoted to them, and that has not
a breath to breathe that is not a sigh for their perfec∣tions.”</P>
<P>“O! this is far—” Camilla began meaning to say,
far from the character of Mandlebert; but ashamed of
undertaking his defence, she stopt short, and only men∣tally
added, even excellence such as his cannot, then,
withstand prejudice!</P>
<P>“If there is any way,” continued Mrs. Arlbery,
“of animating him for a moment out of himself, it can
only be by giving him a dread of some other. The
poor Major does his best; but he is not rich enough
to be feared, unless he were more attractive. Sir
Sedley will seem more formidable. Countenance,
therefore, his present propensity to wear your chains,
till Mandlebert perceives that he is putting them on;
and then—mount to the rising ground you ought to
tread, and shew, at once your power and your disin∣terestedness,
by turning from the handsome Baronet
and all his immense wealth, to mark—since you are de∣termined
to indulge it—your unbiassed preference for
Mandlebert.”</P>
<P>Camilla, irresistibly appeased by a picture so flatter∣ing
to all her best feelings, and dearest wishes, looked
down; angry with herself to find she felt no longer
angry with Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, perceiving a point gained, deter∣mined
to enforce the blow, and then leave her to her
reflections.</P>
<P>“Mandlebert is a creature whose whole composi∣tion
is a pile of accumulated punctillos. He will spend
his life in refining away his own happiness: but do not
<PB N="204" REF="5"/>
let him refine away yours He is just a man to be∣witch
an innocent and unguarded young woman from
forming any other connexion, and yet, when her youth
and expectations have been sacrificed to his hesitation,—
to conceive he does not use her ill in thinking of her
no more, because he has entered into no verbal engage∣ment.
If his honour cannot be arraigned of break∣ing
any bond,—What matters merely breaking her
heart?</P>
<P>She then left the room; but Camilla dwelt upon no∣thing
she had uttered except the one dear and inviting
project of proving her disinterestedness to Edgar. “O!
if once,” she cried, “I could annihilate every merce∣nary
suspicion! If once I could shew Edgar that his
situation has no charms for me—and it has none!
none! then, indeed, I am his equal, though I am no∣thing,
—equal in what is highest, in mind, in spirit, in
sentiment!</P>
<P>From this time the whole of her behaviour became
coloured by this fascinating idea; and a scheme which,
if proposed to her under it's real name of coquetry, she
would have fled and condemned with antipathy, when
presented to her as a means to mark her freedom from
sordid motives, she adopted with inconsiderate fond∣ness.
The sight, therefore, of Edgar, wherever she
met him, became now the signal for adding spirit to
the pleasure with which, already, and without any de∣sign,
she had attended to the young Baronet. Exer∣tion
gave to her the gaiety of which solicitude had de∣prived
her, and she appeared, in the eyes of Sir Sed∣ley,
every day more charming. She indulged him with
the history of her adventure at the house of Mr. Dub∣ster,
and his prevalent taste for the ridiculous made the
account enchant him. He cast off, in return, all airs
of affectation, when he conversed with her separately;
and though still, in all mixt companies, they were re∣sumed,
the real integrity, as well as indifference of
her heart, made that a circumstance but to stimulate
<PB N="205" REF="6"/>
this new species of intercourse, by representing it to
be equally void of future danger to them both.</P>
<P>All this, however, failed of its desired end. Edgar
never saw her engaged by Sir Sedley, but he thought her
youthfully grateful, and esteemed her the more, or
beheld her as a mere coquette, and ceased to esteem her
at all. But never for a moment was any personal un∣easiness
excited by their mutually increasing intimacy.
The conversations he had held, both with the Baronet
and herself, had satisfied him that neither entertained
one serious thought of the other; and he took, there∣fore,
no interest in their acquaintance, beyond that which
was always alive,—a vigilant concern for the manner in
which it might operate upon her disposition.</P>
<P>With respect to the Major, he was by no means so
entirely at his ease He saw him still the declared and
undisguised pursuer of her favour; and though he per∣ceived,
at the same time, she rather avoided than sought
him, he still imagined, in general his acceptance was
arranged, from the many preceding circumstances
which had first given him that belief. The whole of
her behaviour, nevertheless, perplexed as much as it
grieved him, and frequently, in the same half hour,
she seemed to him all that was most amiable for in∣spiring
admiration, and all that was least to be depend∣ed
upon, for retaining attachment.</P>
<P>Yet however, from time to time, he felt alarmed or
offended, he never ceased to experience the fondest in∣terest
in her happiness, nor the most tender compassion
for the dangers with which he saw her environed. He
knew, that though her understanding was excellent, her
temper was so inconsiderate, that she rarely consulted
it; and that, though her mind was of the purest inno∣cence,
it was unguarded by caution, and unprotected by
reflexion. He thought her placed where far higher dis∣cretion,
far superior experience might risk being shaken:
and he did not more fervently wish, than internally
tremble for her safety. Wherever she appeared, she was
sure of distinction: “'Tis Miss Tyrold, the friend of
Mrs. Berlinton,” was buzzed round the moment she was
seen; and the particular favour in which she stood with
<PB N="206" REF="7"/>
some votaries of the <HI>ton,</HI> made even her artlessness, her
retired education, and her ignorance of all that pertain∣ed
to the <HI>certain circles,</HI> past over and forgiven, in con∣sideration
of her personal attractions, her youth, and
newness.</P>
<P>Still, however, even this celebrity was not what most
he dreaded: so sudden and unexpected an elevation
upon the heights of fashionable fame might make her
head, indeed, giddy, but her heart he thought formed
of materials too pure and too good to be endangered
so lightly; and though frequently, when he saw her
so circumstanced; he feared she was undone for private
life, he could not reflect upon her principles and dispo∣sition,
without soon recovering the belief that a short
time might restore her mind to its native simplicity and
worth. But another rock was in the way, against
which he apprehended she might be dashed, whilst least
suspicious of any peril.</P>
<P>This rock, indeed, exhibited nothing to the view
that could have affrighted any spectator less anxious∣ly
watchful, or less personally interested in regarding
it. But youth itself, in the fervour of a strong attach∣ment,
is as open-eyed, as observant, and as prophetic as
age, with all its concomitants of practice, time, and
suspicion. This rock, indeed, far from giving notice
of danger by any sharp points or rough prominences,
displayed only the smoothest and most inviting surface:
for it was Mrs. Berlinton, the beautiful, the accom∣plished,
the attractive Mrs. Berlinton, whom he be∣held
as the object of the greatest risk she had to en∣counter.</P>
<P>As he still preserved the character with which she
had consented to invest him of her monitor, he seized
every opportunity of communicating to her his doubts
and apprehensions. But in proportion as her connex∣ion
with that lady increased, use to her manners and
sentiments abated the wonderment they inspired, and
they soon began to communicate an unmixt charm, that
made all other society, that of Edgar alone excepted,
heartless and uninteresting. Yet, in the conversations
she held with him from time to time, she frankly related
<PB N="207" REF="8"/>
the extraordinary attachment of her new friend to some
unknown correspondent, and confessed her own surprise
when it first came to her knowledge.</P>
<P>Edgar listened to the account with the most unaf∣fected
dismay, and represented the probable danger, and
actual impropriety of such an intercourse, in the strong∣est
and most eloquent terms; but he could neither ap∣pal
her confidence, nor subdue her esteem. The open∣ness
with which all had originally and voluntarily been
avowed, convinced her of the innocence with which
it was felt, and all that his exhortations could obtain,
was a remonstrance on her own part to Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>She found that lady, however, persuaded she in∣dulged
but on innocent friendship, which she assured
her was bestowed upon a person of as much honour as
merit, and which only with life she should relinquish,
since it was the sole consolation of her fettered exis∣tence.</P>
<P>Edgar, to whom this was communicated, saw with
terror the ascendance thus acquired over her judgment
as well as her affections, and became more watchful
and more uneasy in observing the progress of this
friendship, than all the flattering devoirs of the gay Ba∣ronet,
or the more serious assiduities of the Major.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, indeed, was no common object,
either for fear or for hope, for admiration, or for cen∣sure.
She possessed all that was most softly attractive,
most bewitchingly beautiful, and most irresistibly cap∣tivating,
in mind, person, and manners. But to all
that was thus most fascinating to others, she joined un∣happily
all that was most dangerous for herself; an
heart the most susceptible, sentiments the most romantic,
and an imagination the most exalted. She had been
an orphan from earliest years, and left, with an only
brother, to the care of a fanatical maiden aunt, who
had taught her nothing but her faith and her prayers,
without one single lesson upon good works, or the small∣est
instruction upon the practical use of her theoretical
piety. All that ever varied these studies were some
common and ill selected novels and romances, which a
young lady in the neighbourhood privately lent her to
<PB N="208" REF="9"/>
read; till her brother, upon his first vacation from the
University, brought her the works of the Poets. These,
also, it was only in secret she could enjoy; but, to her
juvenile fancy, and irregularly principled mind, that did
not render them more tasteless. Whatever was most
beautifully picturesque in poetry, she saw verified in the
charming landscapes presented to her view in the part
of Wales she inhabited; whatever was most noble or
tender in romance, she felt promptly in her heart, and
conceived to be general; and whatever was enthusias∣tic
in theology, formed the whole of her idea and her
belief with respect to religion.</P>
<P>Brought up thus, to think all things the most unusu∣al
and extraordinary, were merely common and of
course; she was romantic without consciousness, and
eccentric without intention. Nothing steady or ration∣al
had been instilled into her mind by others: and she
was too young▪ and too fanciful to have formed her
own principles with any depth of reflection, or study
of propriety. She had entered the world, by a sudden
and most unequal marriage, in which her choice had
no part, with only two self-formed maxims for the law
of her conduct. The first of these was, that, from
her early notions of religion, no vestal should be more
personally chaste; the second, that, from her more re∣cently
imbibed ones of tenderness, her heart, since she
was married without its concurrence, was still wholly
at liberty to be disposed of by its own propensities,
without reproach and without scruple.</P>
<P>With such a character, where virtue had so little
guide even while innocence presided; where the person
was so alluring, and the situation so open to temptation,
Edgar saw with almost every species of concern the
daily increasing friendship of Camilla. Yet while he
feared for her firmness, he knew not how to blame her
fondness; nor where so much was amiable in its ob∣ject,
could he cease to wish that more were right.</P>
<P>Thus again lived and died another week; and the
fourth succeeded with no actual occurrence, but a new
<PB N="209" REF="10"/>
change of opinion in Mrs. Arlbery, that forcibly and
cruelly affected the feelings of Camilla.</P>
<P>Uninformed of the motive that occasioned the indif∣ference
with which Edgar beheld the newly awakened
gallantry of Sir Sedley, and the pleasure with which
Camilla received it, Mrs. Arlbery observed his total
unconcern, first with surprise, next with perplexity, and
finally with a belief he was seriously resolved against
forming any connection with her himself. This she
took an early opportunity to intimate to Camilla, warm∣ly
exhorting her to drive him fast from her mind.</P>
<P>Camilla assured her that no task could be more easy;
but the disappointment of the project with respect to
Sir Sedley, which she blushed to have adopted, hurt her
in every possible direction. Coquetry was as foreign to
the ingenuousness of her nature, as to the dignity of all
her early maternal precepts. She had hastily encou∣raged
the devoirs of the Baronet, upon the recommen∣dation
of a woman she loved and admired; but now that,
the failure of her aim brought her to reflection, she felt
penitent and ashamed to have heeded any advice so
contrary to the singleness of the doctrines of her father,
and so inferior to the elevation of every sentiment she
had ever heard from her mother. If Edgar had seen her
design, he had surely seen it with contempt: and though
his manner was still the most gentle, and his advice
ever ready and friendly, the opinion of Mrs. Arlbery
was corroborated by all her own observations, that he
was decidedly estranged from her.</P>
<P>What repentance ensued! what severity of regret!
how did she canvass her conduct, how lament she had
ever formed that fatal acquaintance with Mrs Arlbery,
which he had so early opposed, and which seemed eter∣nally
destined to lead her into measures and conduct
most foreign to his approbation!</P>
<P>The melancholy that now again took possession of
her spirits made her decline going abroad, from a re∣newed
determination to avoid all meetings with Edgar.
Mrs. Arlbery felt provoked to find his power thus un∣abated,
and Sir Sedley was astonished. He still saw
her perpetually, from his visits at Mount Pleasant; but
<PB N="210" REF="11"/>
his vanity, that weakest yet most predominant feature
of his character, received a shock for which no mo∣desty
of apprehension or forethought had prepared him,
in finding that, when he saw her no more in the pre∣sence
of Mandlebert, he saw her no more the same.
She was ready still to converse with him; but no pe∣culiar
attention was flattering, no desire to oblige was
pointed. He found he had been merely a passive in∣strument,
in her estimation, to excite jealousy; and
even as such had been powerless to produce that effect.
The raillery which Mrs. Arlbery spared not upon the
occasion added greatly to his pique, and his mortifica∣tion
was so visible, that Camilla perceived it, and per∣ceived
it with pain, with shame, and with surprise.
She thought now, for the first time, that the public
homage he had paid her had private and serious mo∣tives,
and that what she imagined mere sportive gallan∣try,
arose from a growing attachment.</P>
<P>This idea had no gratifying power; believing Edgar
without care for her, she could not hope it would stimu∣late
his regard; and conceiving she had herself excited
the partiality by wilful civilities, she could feel only re∣proach
from a conquest, unduly, unfairly, uningenuously
obtained.</P>
<P>In proportion as these self-upbraidings made her less
deserving in her own eyes, the merits of the young
Baronet seemed to augment; and in considering her∣self
as culpable for having raised his regard, she appear∣ed
before him with a humility that gave a softness to
her look and manners, which soon proved as interesting
to Sir Sedley as her marked gaiety had been flatter∣ing.</P>
<P>When she perceived this, she felt distressed anew.
To shun him was impossible, as Mrs. Arlbery not only
gave him completely the freedom of her house, but
assiduously promoted their belonging always to the same
group, and being seated next to each other. There
was nothing she would not have done to extenuate her
error, and to obviate its ill effect upon Sir Sedley; but
as she always thought herself in the wrong, and regard∣ed
him as injured, every effort was accompanied with
<PB N="211" REF="12"/>
a timidity that gave to every change a new charm, ra∣ther
than any repulsive quality.</P>
<P>In this state of total self-disapprobation, to return to
Etherington was her only wish, and to pass the interme∣diate
time with Mrs. Berlinton became her sole pleasure.
But she was forced again into public to avoid an almost
single intercourse with Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>In meeting again with Edgar she saw him openly
delighted at her sight, but without the least apparent
solicitude, or notice, that the young Baronet had
passed almost the whole of the interval upon Mount
Pleasant.</P>
<P>This was instantly noticed, and instantly commented
upon by Mrs. Arlbery, who again, and strongly pointed
out to Camilla, that to save her youth from being wasted
by fruitless expectation, she must forget young Mandle∣bert,
and study only her own amusement.</P>
<P>Camilla dissented not from the opinion; but the doc∣trine
to which it was easy to agree, it was difficult to
put in practice; and her ardent mind believed itself fet∣tered
for ever, and for ever unhappy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="23" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Traits of Instruction.</HEAD>
<P>THE sixth and last we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> destined for the Tunbridge
sojourn was begun, when Mrs. Arlbery once more took
her fair young guest apart, and intreated her attention
for one final half hour. The time, she said, was fast
advancing in which they must return to their respective
homes; but she wished to make a full and clear repre∣sentation
of the advantages that might be reaped from this
<PB N="212" REF="13"/>
excursion, before the period for gathering them should
be past.</P>
<P>She would forbear, she said, entering again upon
the irksome subject of the insensibility of Mandlebert,
which was, at least, sufficiently glaring to prevent any
delusion. But she begged leave to speak of what she
believed had less obviously struck her, the apparent pro∣mise
of a serious attachment from Sir Sedley Claren∣del.</P>
<P>Camilla would here instantly have broken up the
conversation, but Mrs. Arlbery insisted upon being
heard.</P>
<P>“Why, she asked, should she wilfully destine her
youth to a hopeless waste of affection, and dearth of
all permanent comfort? To sacrifice every considera∣tion
to the honours of constancy, might be soothing,
and even glorious in this first season of romance; but a
very short time would render it vapid; and the epoch
of repentance was always at hand to succeed. With
the least address, or the least genuine encouragement, it
was now palpable she might see Sir Sedley, and his title
and fortune at her feet.</P>
<P>Camilla resentfully interrupted her, disclaiming with
Sir Sedley, as with every one else, all possibility of
alliance from motives so degrading; and persisted, in
declaring, that the most moderate subsistence with free∣dom,
would be preferable to the most affluent obtained
by any mercenary engagement</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery desired her to recollect that Sir Sedley,
though rich even to splendour, was so young, so gay,
so handsome, and so pleasant, that she might safely
honour him with her hand, yet run no risk of being
supposed to have made a mere interested alliance. “I
throw out this,” she cried, in conclusion, for your deep∣est
consideration, but I must press it no further. Sir
Sedley is evidently charmed with you at present; and
his vanity is so potent, and, like all vanity, so easily
assailable, that the smallest food to it, adroitly admi∣nistered,
would secure him your slave for life, and re∣scue
you from the antidiluvian courtship of a man, who,
if he marries at all, is so deliberate in his progress,
<PB N="213" REF="14"/>
that he must reach his grand climacteric before he can
reach the altar.”</P>
<P>Far from meditating upon this discourse with any
view to following its precepts, Camilla found it necessary
to call all her original fondness for Mrs. Arlbery to her
aid, to forgive the plainness of her attack, or the
worldliness of her notions: and all that rested upon
her mind for consideration was, her belief in the se∣rious
regard of Sir Sedley, which, as she apprehended
it to be the work of her own designed exertions, she
could only think of with contrition.</P>
<P>These ruminations were interrupted by a call down
stairs to see a learned bullfinch. The Dennels and Sir
Sedley were present, she met the eyes of the latter with
a sensation of shame that quickly deepened her whole
face with crimson. He did not behold it without emo∣tion,
and exprienced a strong curiosity to define its ex∣act
cause.</P>
<P>He addressed himself to her with the most marked
distinction; she could scarcely answer him; but her
manner was even touchingly gentle. Sir Sedley could
not restrain himself from following her in every motion
by his eyes; he felt an interest concerning her that sur∣prised
him; he began to doubt if it had been indiffer∣ence
which caused her late change; her softness helped
his vanity to recover its tone, and her confusion almost
confirmed him that Mrs. Arlbery had been mistaken in
rallying his failure of rivalry with Mandlebert.</P>
<P>The bird sung various little airs, upon certain words
of command, and mounted his highest, and descended
to his lowest perch; and made whatever evolutions were
within the circumference of his limited habitation, with
wonderful precision.</P>
<P>Camilla, however, was not more pleased by his adroit∣ness,
than pained to observe the severe aspect with which
his keeper issued his orders. She inquired by what
means he had obtained such authority.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="15"/>
The man, with a significant wag of the head, bru∣tally
answered, “By the true old way, Miss; I licks
him.”</P>
<P>“Lick him!” repeated she, with disgust; how is
it possible you can beat such a poor delicate little crea∣ture?”</P>
<P>“O, easy enough, Miss,” replied the man, grin∣ning;
“every thing's the better for a little beating, as
I tells my wife. There's nothing so fine set, Miss, but
what will bear it, more or less.”</P>
<P>Sir Sedley asked with what he could strike it, that
would not endanger its life.</P>
<P>“That's telling, sir!” cried the man, with a sneer;
“howbeit, we've plenty of ill luck in the trade. No
want of that. For one that I rears, I loses six or se∣ven.
And sometimes they be so plaguy sulky, they
tempt me to give 'em a knock a little matter too hard,
and then they'll fall you into a fit, like, and go off in a
twinkle.”</P>
<P>“And how can you have the cruelty,” cried Ca∣milla,
indignantly, “to treat in such a manner a poor
little in offensive animal who does not understand what
you require?”</P>
<P>“O, yes, a does, miss, they knows what I wants as
well as I do myself; only they're so dead tiresome at
being shy. Why now this one here, as does all his
learning to satisfaction just now, mayhap wont' do no∣thing
at all by an hour or two. Why sometimes you
may pinch 'em to a mummy before you can make 'em
budge.”</P>
<P>“Pinch them!” exclaimed she; “do you ever
pinch them?”</P>
<P>“Do I? Ay, miss. Why how do you think one
larns them dumb creturs? It don't come to 'em na∣tural.
They are main dull of themselves. This one
as you see here would do nothing at all, if he was not
afraid of a tweak.”</P>
<P>“Poor unhappy little thing!” cried she! “I hope,
at least, now it has learnt so much, its sufferings are
over!”</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="16"/>
“Yes, yes, he's pretty well off. I always gives
him his fill when he's done his day's work. But a little
squeak now and then in the intrum does 'em no harm.
They're mortal cunning. One's forced to be pretty
tough with 'em.”</P>
<P>“How should I rejoice,” cried Camilla, “to res∣cue
this one poor unoffending and oppressed little ani∣mal
from such tyranny!” Then, taking out her purse,
she desired to know what he would have for it.</P>
<P>The man, as a very great favour, said he would take
ten guineas; though it would be his ruin to part with it,
as it was all his livelihood; but he was willing to oblige
the young lady.</P>
<P>Camilla, with a constrained laugh, but a very natural
blush, put up her purse, and said: “Thou must linger
on, then, in captivity, thou poor little undeserving suf∣ferer,
for I cannot help thee!”</P>
<P>Every body protested that ten guineas was an imposi∣tion;
and the man offered to part with it for five.</P>
<P>Camilla, who had imagined it would have cost half
a guinea, was now more ashamed, because equally in∣capable
to answer such a demand; she declined, there∣fore,
the composition, and the man was dismissed.</P>
<P>At night, when she returned to her own room from
the play, she saw the little bulfinch, reposing in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>perb,
cage, upon her table.</P>
<P>Delighted first, and next perplexed, she flew to Mrs.
Arlbery, and inquired whence it came.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was as much amazed as her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Questions were then asked of the servan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> but none
knew, or none would own, how the bir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>came thus
situated.</P>
<P>Camilla could not now doubt but Sir S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dley had given
this commission to his servant, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> easily place
the cage in her room, from his consant access to the
house. She was enchanted to see the little animal re∣lieved
from so painful a life, but he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itated not a moment
in resolving to refuse its acceptance.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="17"/>
When Sir Sedley came the next day, she carried it
down, and, with a smile of open pleasure, thanked him
for giving her so much share in his generous liberality;
and asked if he could take it home with him in his car∣riage,
or, if she should send it to his hotel.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley was disappointed, yet felt the propriety of
her delicacy and her spirit. He did not deny the step
he had taken; but told her that having hastily, from the
truth of reflection her compassion had awakened, order∣ed
his servant to follow the man, and buy the bird, he
had forgotten, till it arrived, his incapability of taking
care of it. His valet was as little at home as himself,
and there was small chance, at an inn, that any maid
would so carefully watch, as to prevent its falling a prey
to the many cats with which it was swarming. He
hoped, therefore, till their return to Hampshire, she
would take charge of a little animal that owed its deli∣verance
from slavery to her pitying comments.</P>
<P>Camilla, instinctively, would with unfeigned joy,
have accepted such a trust: but she thought she saw
something archly significant in the eye of Mrs. Arlbery,
and therefore stammered out, she was afraid she should
herself be too little at home to secure its safety.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, looking extremely blank, said, it would
be better to re-deliver it to the man, brute as he was,
than to let it be unprotected; but, where generosity
touched Camilla, reflection ever flew her; and off all
guard at such an idea, she exclaimed she would rather
relinquish going out again while at Tunbridge, than ren∣der
his humanity abortive; and ran off precipitately
with the bird to her chamber.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, soon following, praised her behavi∣our;
and said, she had sent the Baronet away perfectly
happy.</P>
<P>Camilla, much provoked, would now have had the
bird conveyed after him; but Mrs. Arlbery assured her,
inconsistency in a woman was as flattering, as in a man
it was tedious and alarming; and persuaded her to let
the matter rest.</P>
<P>Her mind, however, did not rest at the same time:
in the evening, when the Baronet met them at the
<PB N="217" REF="18"/>
Rooms, he was not only unusually gay, but looked at
her with an air and manner that seemed palpably to
mark her as the cause of his satisfaction.</P>
<P>In the deepest disturbance, she considered herself
now to be in a difficulty the most delicate; she could
not come forward to clear it up, without announcing
expectations from his partiality which he had never au∣thorised
by any declaration; nor yet suffer such symp∣toms
of his believing it welcome to pass unnoticed,
without risking the reproach of using him ill, when she
made known, at a later period, her indifference.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery would not aid her, for she thought the
embarrassment might lead to a termination the most for∣tunate.
To consult with Edgar was her first wish; but
how open such a subject? The very thought, however,
gave her an air of solicitude when he spoke to her, that
struck him, and he watched for an opportunity to say,
“You have not, I hope, forgotten my province?—
May I, in my permitted office, ask a few questions?”</P>
<P>“O, yes!” cried she, with alacrity; “And, when
they are asked, and when I have answered them, if you
should not be too much tired, may I ask some in my
turn?”</P>
<P>“Of me!” cried he, with the most gratified sur∣prise.</P>
<P>“Not concerning yourself!” answered she, blush∣ing;
“but upon something which a little distresses
me.”</P>
<P>“When, and where may it be?” cried he, while a
thousand conjectures rapidly succeeded to each other;
“may I call upon Mrs. Arlbery to-morrow morning?”</P>
<P>“O, no! we shall be, I suppose, here again at
night,” she answered; dreading arranging a visit Mrs.
Arlbery would treat, she knew, with raillery the most
unmerciful.</P>
<P>There was time for no more, as that lady, suddenly
tired, led the way to the carriage. Edgar followed her
to the door, hoping and fearing, at once, every thing
that was most interesting from a confidence so voluntary
and so unexpected.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="19"/>
Camilla was still more agitated; for though uncer∣tain
if she were right or wrong in the appeal she meant
to make, to converse with him openly, to be guided by
his counsel, and to convince him of her superiority to
all mercenary allurements were pleasures to make her
look forward to the approaching conference with almost
trembling delight.</P>

<P>THE next night, as the carriage was at the door,
and the party preparing for the Rooms, the name of
Mr. Tyrold was announced, and Lionel entered the
parlour.</P>
<P>His manner was hurried, though he appeared gay and
frisky as usual; Camilla felt a little alarmed; but Mrs.
Arlbery asked if he would accompany them.</P>
<P>With all his heart, he answered, only be must first
have a moment's chat with his sister. Then, saying
they should have a letter to write together, he called for
a pen and ink, and was taking her into another apart∣ment,
when Mr. Dennel objected to letting his horses
wait.</P>
<P>“Send them back for us, then,” cried Lionel, with
his customary ease, “and we will follow you.”</P>
<P>Mr Dennel again objected to making his horses so
often mount the hill; but Lionel assured him nothing
was so good for them, ran on with so many farrier
words and phrases of the benefit they would reap from
such light evening exercise, that, persuaded he was mas∣ter
of the subject, Mr. Dennel submitted, and the bro∣ther
and sister were left <HI>tête-à-tête.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="20"/>
At any other time, Camilla would have proposed
giving up the Rooms entirely: but her desire to see
Edgar, and the species of engagement she had made
with him, counterbalanced every inconvenience.</P>
<P>“My dear girl,” said Lionel, “I am come to beg
a favour. You see this pen and ink. Give me a sheet
of paper.”</P>
<P>She fetched him one.</P>
<P>“That's a good child,” cried he, patting her cheek;
“so now sit down, and write a short letter for me. Come
begin. Dear Sir'</P>
<P>She wrote Dear Sir.</P>
<P>“An unforeseen accident,—write on,—an unfore∣seen
accident has reduced me to immediate distress for
two hundred pounds—”</P>
<P>Camilla let her pen drop, and rising said, “Lionel!
is this possible?”</P>
<P>“Very possible, my dear. You know I told you
I wanted another hundred before you left Cleves. So
you must account it only as one hundred, in fact, at
present.”</P>
<P>“O Lionel, Lionel!” cried Camilla, clasping her
hands, with a look of more remonstrance than any words
she durst utter.</P>
<P>“Won't you write the letter?” said he, pretending
not to observe her emotion.</P>
<P>“To <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hom is it to be addressed?”</P>
<P>“My uncle, to be sure, my dear! What can you be
thinking of? Are you in love, Camilla?”</P>
<P>“My uncle again? no Lionel, no!—I have solemn∣ly
engaged myself to apply to him no more”</P>
<P>“That was, for me, my dear; but where can your
thoughts be wandering? Why you must ask for this, as
if it were for yourself.”</P>
<P>“For myself!”</P>
<P>“Yes, certainly. You know he won't give it
else.”</P>
<P>“Impossible! what should I want two hundred
pounds for?”</P>
<P>“O, a thousand things; say you must have some
new gowns and caps, and hats and petticoats, and all
<PB N="220" REF="21"/>
those kind of gear. There is not the least difficulty; you
can easily persuade him they are all worn out at such
a place as this. Besides, I'll tell you what is still bet∣ter;
say you've been robbed; he'll soon believe it, for
he thinks all public places filled with sharpers.”</P>
<P>“Now you relieve me, said she, with a sort of fear∣ful
smile, “for I am sure you cannot be serious. You
must be very certain I would not deceive or delude my
uncle for a million of worlds.”</P>
<P>“You know nothing of life, child, nothing at all.
However, if you won't say that, tell him it's for a se∣cret
purpose. At least you can do that. And then,
you can make him understand he must ask no questions
about the matter. The money is all we want from
him.”</P>
<P>“This is so idle, Lionel, that I hope you speak it
for mere nonsense. Who could demand such a sum, and
refuse to account for its purpose?”</P>
<P>“Account, my dear! Does being an uncle give a
man a right to be impertinent? If it does, marry out
of hand yourself, there's a good girl, and have a family
at once, that I may share the same privilege. I shall like
it of all things; who will you have?”</P>
<P>“Pho, pho!”</P>
<P>“Major Cerwood?”</P>
<P>“No, never!”</P>
<P>“I once thought Edgar Mandlebert had a sneaking
kindness for you. But I believe it is gone off. Or
else I was out.”</P>
<P>This was not an observation to exhilarate her spirits.
She sighed: but Lionel, concluding himself the cause,
begged her not to be low-spirited, but to write the letter
at once.</P>
<P>She assured him she could never again consent to in∣terfere
in his unreasonable requests.</P>
<P>He was undone, then, he said; for he could not live
without the money.</P>
<P>“Rather say, not with it,” cried she; “for you keep
nothing!”</P>
<P>“Nobody does, my dear; we all go on the same
way now-a-days.”</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="22"/>
“And what do you mean to be the end of it all,
Lionel? How do you propose living when all these re∣sources
are completely exhausted?”</P>
<P>“When I am ruined, you mean? why how do other
people live when they're ruined? I can but do the
same; though I have not much considered the mat∣ter.”</P>
<P>“Do consider it, then, dear Lionel! for all our sakes,
do consider it!”</P>
<P>“Well,—let us see.—”</P>
<P>“O, I don't mean so; I don't mean just now; in this
mere idle manner.—”</P>
<P>“O, yes, I'll do it at once, and then it will be over.
Faith I don't well know. I have no great <HI>gusta</HI> for
blowing out my brains. I like the little dears mighty
well where they are. And I can't say▪ I shall much
relish to consume my life and prime and vigour in the
king's bench prison. 'Tis horribly tiresome to reside
always on the same spot. Nor I have no great dispo∣tion
to whisk off to another country. Old England's a
pretty place enough. I like it very well;—with a lit∣tle
rhino understood! But it's the very deuce, with an
empty purse. So write the letter, my dear girl.”</P>
<P>“And is this your consideration, Lionel? And is
this its conclusion?”</P>
<P>“Why what signifies dwelling upon such dismalties?
If I think upon my ruin beforehand, I am no nearer to
enjoyment now than then. Live while we live, my
dear girl! I hate prophesying horrors. Write, I say,
write!”</P>
<P>Again she absolutely refused, pleading her promise
to her uncle, and declaring she would keep her
word.</P>
<P>“Keep a fiddlestick!” cried he, impatiently; “you
don't know what mischief you may have to answer for!
you may bring misery upon all our heads! you may make
my father banish me his sight, you may make my mo∣ther
execrate me!</P>
<P>“Good Heaven!” cried Camilla interrupting him,
“what is it you talk of? what is it you mean?”</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="23"/>
“Just what I say; and to make you understand me
better, I'll give you a hint of the truth; but you must
lose your life twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes before you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—There's
—there's—do you hear me?—there's a pretty girl in
the case I”</P>
<P>“A pretty girl!—And what has that to do with
this rapacity for money?”</P>
<P>“What an innocent question! why <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hat a baby thou
art, my dear Camilla?”</P>
<P>“I hope you are not forming any connexion un∣known
to my father?”</P>
<P>“Ha, ha, ha!” cried Lionel laughing loud:
“Why thou hast lived in that old parsonage-house
till thou art almost too young to be rocked in a
cradle.”</P>
<P>“If you are entering into an engagement,” said she,
still more gravely, “that my father must not know, and
that my mother would so bitterly condemn,—why am I
to be trusted with it?”</P>
<P>“You understand nothing of these things, child.
'Tis the very nature of a father to be an hunks, and of
a mother to be a bore.”</P>
<P>“O Lionel! such a father!—such a mother!—”</P>
<P>“As to their being perfectly good, and all that, I
know it very well. And I am very sorry for it A good
father is a very serious misfortune to a poor lad like
me, as the world runs; it causes one such confounded
gripes of the conscience for every little awkard thing
one does! A bad father would be the joy of my life;
'twould be all fair play there; the more he was choused
the better.”</P>
<P>“But this pretty girl, Lionel!—Are you serious?
Are you really engaging yourself? And is she so poor?
Is she so much distressed, that you require these immense
and frequent sums for her?”</P>
<P>Lionel laughed again, and rubbed his hands; but
after a short silence assumed a more steady countenance,
and said, “Don't ask me any thing about her. It is
not fit you should be so curious. And don't give a hint
of the matter to a soul. Mind that! But as to the mo∣ney,
<PB N="223" REF="24"/>
I must have it. And directly: I shall be blown
to the deuce else.”</P>
<P>“Lionel!” cried Camilla, shrinking. “you make
me tremble! you cannot surely be so wicked—so un∣principled
—No! your connexions are never worse than
imprudent!—you would not else be so unkind, so in∣jurious
as to place in me such a confidence!'</P>
<P>The whole face of Lionel now fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed with shame,
and he walked about the room, muttering: “'Tis true.
I ought not to have done it.” And soon after, with
still greater concern he exclaimed: “If this appears
to you in such a heinous light▪ what will my father think
of it? And how can I bear to let it be known to my
mother?”</P>
<P>“O never, never!” cried she emphatically; “never
let it reach the knowledge of either! If indeed you
have been so inconsiderate, and so wrong—break
up, at least, any such intercourse before it offends their
ears”</P>
<P>“But how, my dear, can I do that, if it gets blazed
abroad?”</P>
<P>“Blazed abroad!”</P>
<P>“Yes; and for want, only, of a few pitiful
guineas.”</P>
<P>“What can you mean? how can it depend upon a
few guineas?”</P>
<P>“Get me the guineas:—and leave the how to
me.”</P>
<P>“My dear Lionel,” cried she, affectionately, “I
would do any thing that is not absolute improper to
serve you; but my uncle has now nothing more to
spare; he has told me so himself; and with what
courage, then, in this dark, mysterious, and, I fear,
worse than mysterious business, can I apply to him?”</P>
<P>“My dear child, he only wants to hoard up his mo∣ney
to shew off poor Eugenia at her marriage; and you
know as well as I do what a ninny he is for his pains;
for what a poor little dowdy thing will she look, dizened
out in jewels and laces?”</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="25"/>
“Can you speak so of Eugenia? the most amiable,
the most deserving, the most excellent creature breath∣ing!”</P>
<P>“I speak it in pure friendship. I would not have
her exposed. I love dear little Greek and Latin as
well as you do. Only the difference is I don't talk so
like an old woman; and really when you do it yourself,
you can't think the ridiculous effect it has, when one
looks at your young face. However, only write the
request as if from yourself, and tell him you'll acquaint
him with the reason next letter; but that the post is
just going out now, and you have time for no more.
And then, just coax him over a little, with, how you
long to be back, and how you hate Tunbridge, and how
you adore Cleves, and how tired you are for want of
his bright conversation,—and you may command half
his fortune.—My dear Camilla, you don't know from
what destruction you will rescue me! Think too of my
father, and what a shock you will save him: And
think of my mother, whom I can never see again if
you won't help me?”</P>
<P>Camilla sighed, but let him put the pen into her hand,
whence, however, the very next moment's reflection
was urging her to cast it down, when he caught her in
his arms in a transport of joy, called her his protectress
from dishonour and despair, and said he would run
to the Rooms while she wrote, just to take the oppor∣tunity
of seeing them, and to un-order the carriage,
that she might have no interruption to her composition,
which he would come back to claim before the party
returned, as he must set off for Cleves, and gallop all
night, to procure the money, which the loss of a single
day would render useless.</P>
<P>All this he uttered with a rapidity that mocked every
attempt at expostulation or answer: and then ran out
of the roum and out of the house.</P>
<P>Horrour at such perpetual and increasing ill conduct,
grief at the compulsive failure of meeting Edgar, and
perplexity how to extricate herself from her half given,
<PB N="225" REF="26"/>
but wholly seized upon engagement to write, took for a
while nearly equally shares in tormenting Camilla.
But all presently concentred in one domineering senti∣ment
of sharp repentance for what she had apparently
undertaken.</P>
<P>To claim two hundred pounds of her uncle, in her
own name, was out of all question. She could not,
even a moment, dwell upon such a project; but how
represent what she herself so little understood as the
necessity of Lionel? or how as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for so large a sum, and
postpone, as he desired, all explanation? She was inca∣pable
of any species of fraud▪ she detested even the
most distant disguise, Simple supplication seemed there∣fore,
her only method; but so difficult was even this,
in an affair so dark and unconscionable, that she began
twenty letters without proceeding in any one of them
beyond two lines.</P>
<P>Thus far, however, her task was light to what it ap∣peared
to her upon a little further deliberation. That
her brother had formed some unworthy engagement or
attachment, he had not, indeed, avowed clearly, but
he had by no means denied, and she had even omitted,
in her surprise and consternation, exacting his promise
that it should immediately be concluded. What, then,
might she be doing by endeavouring to procure this
money? Aiding perhaps vice and immorality, and as∣sisting
her misguided, if not guilty brother, to persevere
in the most dangerous errors, if not crimes?</P>
<P>She shuddered, she pushed away her paper, she rose
from the table, she determined not to write another
word.</P>
<P>Yet, to permit parents she justly revered to suffer
any evil she had the smallest chance to spare them, was
dreadful to her; and what evil could be inflicted upon
them, so deeply, so lastingly severe, as the conviction
of any serious vices in-any of their children?</P>
<P>This, for one minute, brought her again to the table;
but the next, her better judgment pointed out the shal∣lowness
and fallacy of such reasoning. To save them
present pain at the risk of future anguish, to consult the
feelings of her brother, in preference to his morality.
<PB N="226" REF="27"/>
would be forgetting every lesson of her life, which from
its earliest dawn, had imbibed a love of virtue, that
made her consider whatever was offensive to it as
equally disgusting and unhappy.</P>
<P>To disappoint Lionel was, however, terrible. She
knew well he would be deaf to remonstrance, ridicule
all argument, and laugh off whatever she could urge by
persuasion. She feared he would be quite outrageous to
find his expectations thus thwarted: and the lateness
of the hour when he would hear it, and the weight he
annexed to obtaining the money expeditiously, re∣doubled
at once her regret for her momentary compli∣ance▪
and her pity for what he would undergo through
its failure.</P>
<P>After considering in a thousand ways how to soften
to him her recantation, she found herself so entirely
without courage to encounter his opposition, that she
resolved to write him a short letter, and then retire to
her room, to avoid an intrview.</P>
<P>In this, she besought him to forgive her error in
not sooner being sensible of her duty, which had taught
her, upon her first reflexion, the impossibility of de∣manding
two hundred pounds for herself, who wanted
nothing, and the impracticability of demanding it for
him▪ in so unintelligible a manner.</P>
<P>Thus far only she had proceeded, from the length
of time consumed in regret and rumination, when a vio∣lent
ringing at the door, without the sound of any car∣riage,
made her start up, and fly to her chamber;
leaving her unfinished letter, with the beginnings of
her several essays to address Sir Hugh, upon the table,
to shew her various efforts, and to explain that they
were relinquished.</P>

<P>THUS, self-confined and almost in an agony, Ca∣milla
remained for a quarter of an hour, without any
species of interruption, and in the greatest amazement
that Lionel forbore pursuing her, either with letter or
message.</P>
<P>Another violent ringing at the bell, but still without
any carriage, then excited her attention, and presently
the voice and steps of Lionel resounded upon the stairs,
whence her name was with violence vociferated.</P>
<P>She did not move; and in another minute he was
rapping at her chamber door, demanding admittance,
or that she would instantly descend.</P>
<P>Alarmed for her open letter and papers, she enquired
who was in the parlour.</P>
<P>“Not a soul,” he answered; “I have left them all
at the Rooms”</P>
<P>“Have you returned, then, twice?”</P>
<P>“No. I should have been here sooner, but I met
two or three old cronies, that would not part with me.
Come, where's your letter?”</P>
<P>“Have you not seen what I have written?”</P>
<P>Down upon this intimation he flew, without any re∣ply;
but was presently back, saying he found nothing
in the parlour, except a letter to herself.</P>
<P>Affrighted, she followed him; but not one of her
papers remained. The table was cleared, and nothing
was to be seen but a large packet, addressed to her in a
hand she did not know.</P>
<P>She rang to enquire who had been in the house be∣fore
her brother.</P>
<P>The servant answered, only Sir Sedley Clarendel,
who be thought had been there still, as he had said he
should wait till Mrs. Arlbery came home.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="29"/>
“Is it possible,” cried she, “that a gentleman such
as Sir Sedley Clarendel, can have permitted himself to
touch my papers?”</P>
<P>Lionel agreed that it was socking; but said the loss
of time to himself was still worse; without suffering
her, therefore, to open her packet, he insisted that she
should write another letter directly; adding, he had
met the Baronet in his way from the Rooms, but
had little suspected whence he came, or how he had
been amusing himself.</P>
<P>Camilla now hung about her brother in the greatest
tribulation, but refused to take the pen he would have
put into her hands, and, at last, not without tears,
said: “Forgive me, Lionel! but the papers you ought
to have found would have explained—that I cannot
write for you to my uncle.”</P>
<P>Lionel heard this with the indignation of an injured
man. He was utterly, he said, lost; and his family
would be utterly disgraced, for ruin must be the lot of
his father, or exile or imprisonment must be his own,
if she persisted in such unkind and unnatural conduct.</P>
<P>Terrour now bereft her of all speech or motion, till
the letter, which Lionel had been beating about in his
agitation, without knowing or caring what he was doing,
burst open, and some written papers fell to the floor,
which she recognised for her own.</P>
<P>Much amazed, she seized the cover, which had
only been fastened by a wafer that was still wet, and
saw a letter within it to herself, which she hastily
read, while a paper that was enclosed dropt down, and
was caught by Lionel.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Miss Camilla Tyrold.</HEAD>
<P>FORGIVE, fairest Camilla, the work of the Destinies.
I came hither to see if illness detained you; the papers
which I enclose from other curious eyes caught mine
by accident. The pathetic sisterly address has touched
me. I have not the honour to know Mr. Lionel Ty∣rold;
let our acquaintance begin with an act of con∣fidence
<PB N="229" REF="30"/>
on his part, that must bind to him for ever his
lovely sister's</P>
<CLOSER>Most obedient and devoted
<SIGNED>SEDLEY CLARENDEL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The loose paper, picked up by Lionel, was a draft,
upon a banker, for two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>While this, with speechless emotion, was perused by
Camilla, Lionel, with unbounded joy, began jumping,
skipping, leaping over every chair, and capering round
and round the room in an ecstasy.</P>
<P>“My dearest Lionel,” cried she, when a little re∣covered,
“why such joy? you cannot suppose it pos∣sible
this can be accepted.”</P>
<P>“Not accepted, child? do you think me out of my
senses? Don't you see me freed from all my misfor∣tunes
at once? and neither my father grieved, nor my
mother offended, nor poor numps fleeced?”</P>
<P>“And when can you pay it? And what do you
mean to do? And to whom will be the obligation?
Weigh, weigh a little all this.”</P>
<P>Lionel heard her not; his rapture was too buoyant
for attention, and he whisked every thing out of its
place, from frantic merriment, till he put the apartment
into so much disorder, that it was scarce practicable to
stir a stept in it; now and then interrupting himself to
make her low bows, scraping his feet all over the room,
and obsequiously saying: “My sister Clarendel! How
does your La'ship do? my dear Lady Clarendel, pray
afford me your La'ship's countenance.”</P>
<P>Nothing could be less pleasant to Camilla than rail∣lery
which pointed out, that, even by the unreflecting
Lionel, this action could be ascribed but to one motive.
The draft, however, had fallen into his hands, and
neither remonstrance nor petition, neither representati∣on
of impropriety nor persuasion, could induce him to
relinquish it; he would only dance, sing, and pay her
grotesque homage, till the coach stopt at the door;
and then, ludicrously hoping her Ladyship would ex∣cuse
his leaving her, for once, to play the part of the
<PB N="230" REF="31"/>
house-maid in setting the room to rights, he sprang past
them all, and bounded down the hill.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was much diverted by the confusion
in the parlour, and Miss Dennel asked a thousand ques∣tions
why the chairs and tables were all thrown down,
the china jars removed from the chimney-piece into the
middle of the room, and the fide board apparatus put
on the chimney-piece in their stead.</P>
<P>Camilla was too much confounded either to laugh or
explain, and hastily wishing them good-night, retired
to her chamber.</P>
<P>Here, in the extremest perturbation, she saw the
full extent of her difficulties, without perceiving any
means of extrication. She had no hope of recovering
the draft from Lionel, whom she had every reason to
conclude already journeying from Tunbridge. What
could she say the next day to Sir Sedley? How account
for so sudden, so gross an acceptance of pecuniary obli∣gation?
What inference might he not draw? And
how could she undeceive him, while retaining so im∣proper
a mark of his dependence upon her favour? The
displeasure she felt that he should venture to suppose she
would owe to him such a debt, rendered but still more
palpable the species of expectation it might authorise.</P>
<P>To destroy this illusion occupied all her attention,
except what was imperiously seized upon by regret of
missing Edgar, with whom to consult was more than her
wish.</P>
<P>In this disturbed state, when she saw Mrs. Arlbery
the next morning, her whole care was to avoid being
questioned: and that lady, who quickly perceived her
fears by her avoidance, took the first opportunity to say
to her, with a laugh, “I see I must make no enqui∣ries
into the gambols of your brother last night: but I
may put together, perhaps, certain circumstances that
may give me a little light to the business: and if, as I
conjecture, Clarendel spoke out to him, his wildest
rioting is more rational than his sister's gravity.'</P>
<P>Camilla protested they had not conversed together at
all.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="32"/>
“Nay▪ then I own myself still in the dark. But I
observed that Clarendel left the Rooms at a very early
hour, and that your brother almost immediately follow∣ed.”</P>
<P>Camilla ventured not any reply; and soon after re∣treated.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, in a few minutes, pursuing her, laugh∣ingly,
and with sportive reproach, accused her of in∣tending
to steal a march to the altar of Hymen; as she
had just been informed, by her maid, that Sir Sedley
had actually been at the house last night, during her ab∣sence.</P>
<P>Camilla seriously assured her, that she was in her
chamber when he arrived, and had not seen him.</P>
<P>“For what in the world, then, could he come? He
was sure I was not at home, for he had left me at the
Rooms?”</P>
<P>Camilla again was silent: but her tingling cheeks
proclaimed it was not for want of something to say.
Mrs. Arlbery forbore to press the matter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urther; but
forbore with a nod that implied <HI>I see how it is!</HI> and a
smile that published the pleasure and approbation which
accompanied her self-conviction</P>
<P>The vexation of Camilla would have prompted an im∣mediate
confession of the whole mortifying transaction,
had she not been endued with a sense of honour where
the interests of others was concerned, that repressed
her natural precipitance, and was more powerful even
than her imprudence.</P>
<P>She waited the greatest part of the morning in some
little faint hope of seeing Lionel: but he came not, and
she spent the rest of it with Mrs. Berlinton. She anx∣iously
wished to meet Edgar in the way, to a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ologise for
her non-appearance the preceding evening; but this did
not happen; and her concern was not lessened by reflect∣ing
upon the superior interest in her health and welfare,
marked by Sir Sedley, who had taken the trouble to
walk from the Rooms to Mount Pleasant to see what was
become of her.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="33"/>
She returned home but barely in time to dress for din∣ner,
and was not yet ready, when she saw the carriage
of the Baronet drive up to the door.</P>
<P>In the most terrible confusion how to meet him, what
to say about the draft, how to mention her brother,
whether to seem resentful of the liberty he had so unce∣remoniously
taken, or thankful for its kindness, she had
scarce the force to attire herself, nor, when summoned
down stairs, to descend.</P>
<P>This distress was but increased upon her entrance, by
the sight and the behaviour of the Baronet; whose ad∣dress
to her was so marked, that it covered her with
blushes, and whose air had an assurance that spoke a
species of secret triumph. Offended as well as fright∣ened,
she looked every way to avoid him, or assumed a
look of haughtiness, when forced by any direct speech
to answer him. She soon, however, saw, by his con∣tinued
self complacency, and even an increase of gaiety,
that he only regarded this as coquetry, or bashful em∣barrassment,
since every time she attempted thus to re∣buff
him, an arch smile stole over his features, that dis∣played
his different conception of her meaning.</P>
<P>She now wished nothing so much as a prompt and
positive declaration, that she might convince him of his
mistake and her rejection. For this purpose, she sub∣dued
her desire of retreat, and spent the whole after∣noon
with Mrs. Arlbery and the Dennels in his com∣pany.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, when Mrs. Arlbery, who had the same
object in view, though with a different conclusion, con∣trived
to draw her other guests out of the apartment and
to leave her alone with Sir Sedley, modesty and shame
both interfered with her desire of an explanation, and she
was hastily retiring; but the Baronet, in a gentle voice,
called after her, “Are you going?”</P>
<P>“Yes; I have forgotten something.—”</P>
<P>“He rose to follow her, with a motion that seemed
purporting to take her hand; but, gliding quickly on,
she prevented him, and was almost at the same moment
in her own chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="34"/>
With augmented severity, she now felt the impropri∣ety
of an apparent acceptance of so singular and unplea∣sant
an obligation, which obviously misled Sir Sedley to
believe her at his command.</P>
<P>Shocked in her delicacy, and stung in her best noti∣ons
of laudable pride, she could not rest without des∣troying
this humiliating idea; and resolved to apply to
Edgar for the money, and to pay the Baronet the next
day. Her objections to betraying the extravagance of
Lionel, though great and sincere, yielded to the still
more dangerous evil of letting Sir Sedley continue in an
errour, that might terminate in branding her in his opi∣nion,
with a character of inconsistency or duplicity.</P>
<P>Edgar, too, so nearly a brother to them both, would
guard the secret of Lionel better, in all probability, than
he would guard it himself; and could draw no personal
inferences from the trust and obligation, when he found
its sole incitement was sooner to owe an obligation to a
ward of her father, than to a new acquaintance of her
own.</P>
<P>Pleased at the seeming necessity of an application that
would lead so naturally to a demand of the counsel she
languished to claim, she determined not to suffer Sir Sed∣ley
to wait even another minute under his mistake; but,
since she now could speak of returning the money, to
take courage for meeting what might either precede or
ensue in a conference.</P>
<P>Down, therefore, she went; but as she opened the
parlour door, she heard Sir Sedley say to Mrs. Arlbery,
who had just entered before her: “O, fie! fie! you
know she will be cruel to excruciation! you know me
destined to despair to the last degree.”</P>
<P>Camilla, whose so speedy re-appearance was the last
sight he expected, was too far advanced to retreat; and
the resentment that tinged her whole complexiom shew∣ed
she had heard what he said, and had heard it with
an application the most offensive.</P>
<P>An immediate sensibility to his own impertinence now
succeeded in its vain display; he looked not merely
concerned, but contrite; and, in a voice softened near∣ly
to timidity, attempted a general conversation, but
<PB N="234" REF="35"/>
kept his eyes, with an anxious expression, almost conti∣nually
sixed upon her's.</P>
<P>Anger with Camilla was a quick, but short-lived sen∣sation;
and this sudden change in the Baronet from
conceit to respect, produced a change equally sudden in
herself from disdain to inquitetude. Though mortified
in the first moment by his vanity, it was less seriously
painful to her than any belief that under it was couched
a disposition towards a really steady regard. With Mrs.
Arlbery she was but slightly offended, though certain
she had been assuring him of all the success he could de∣mand▪
her way of thinking upon the subject had been
openly avowed, and she did justice to the kindness of
her motives.</P>
<P>No opportunity, however, arose to mention the re∣turn
of the draft; Mrs. Arlbery saw displeasure in her
air, and not doubting she had heard what had dropt from
Sir Sedley, thought the moment unfavourable for a
<HI>tète-â-tète,</HI> and resolutely kept her place, till Camilla
herself, weary of useless waiting, left the room.</P>
<P>Following her then to her chamber, “My dear Miss
Tyrold,” she cried, “do not let your extreme youth
stand in the way of all your future life. A Baronet,
rich, young, and amiable, is upon the very point of
becoming your slave for ever; yet, because you disco∣ver
him to be a little restive in the last agonies of his li∣berty,
you are eager, in the high-flown disdain of juve∣nile
susceptibility, to cast him and his fortune away; as
if both were such every-day baubles, that you might
command or reject them without thought of future con∣sequence.”</P>
<P>“Indeed no, dear madam; I am not actuated by
pride or anger; I owe too much to Sir Sedley to feel
either above a moment, even where I think them—par∣don
me!—justly excited. But I should ill pay my
debt, by accepting a lasting attachment, where certain
I can return nothing but lasting, eternal, unchangeable
indifference,”</P>
<P>“You sacrifice, then, both him and yourself, to the
fanciful delicacy of a first love?”</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="36"/>
“No, indeed!” cried she blushing. “I have no
thought at all but of the single life. And I sincerely
hope Sir Sedley has no serious intentions towards me;
for my obligations to him are so infinite, I should be
cruelly hurt to appear to him ungrateful.”</P>
<P>“You would appear to him, I confess, a little sur∣prising,”
said Mrs. Arlbery, laughing; “for diffidence
certainly is not his weak part. However, with all his
foibles, he is a charming creature, and prepossession only
can blind you to his merit.”</P>
<P>Camilla again denied the charge, and strove to pre∣vail
with her to undeceive the Baronet from any false
expectations. But she protested she would not be acces∣sary
to so much after-repentance; and left her.</P>
<P>The business now wore a very serious aspect to Ca∣milla.
Mrs. Arlbery avowed she thought Sir Sedley
in earnest, and he knew she had herself heard him speak
with security of his success. The bullfinch had gone
far, but the draft seemed to have riveted the persuasion.
The bird it was now impossible to return till her depar∣ture
from Tunbridge; but she resolved not to defer ano∣ther
moment putting upon her brother alone the obliga∣tion
of the draft, to stop the further progress of such
dangerous inference.</P>
<P>Hastily, therefore, she wrote to him the following
note:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir Sedley Clarendel, Bart.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME particular business compelled my brother so
abruptly to quit Tunbridge, that he could not have the
honour to first wait upon you with his thanks for the
loan you so unexpectedly put into his hands; by mine,
however, all will be restored to-morrow morning, ex∣cept
his gratitude for your kindness.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, sir, in both our names,
your obliged humble servant,
<SIGNED>CAMILLA TYROLD.</SIGNED>
MOUNT PLEASANT,
Thursday Evening.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="236" REF="37"/>
She now waited till she was summoned down stairs
to the carriage, and then gave her little letter to a ser∣vant,
whom she desired to deliver it to Sir Sedley's
man.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley did not accompany them to the Rooms,
but promised to follow.</P>
<P>Camilla, on her arrival, with palpitating pleasure,
looked round for Edgar. She did not, however, see
him. She was accosted directly by the Major; who,
as usual, never left her, and whose assiduity to seek her
favour seemed increased.</P>
<P>She next joined Mrs. Berlinton; but still she saw no∣thing
of Edgar. Her eyes incessantly looked towards
the door, but the object they sought never met them.</P>
<P>When Sir Sedley entered, he joined the group of
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>Camilla tried to look at him and to speak to him
with her customary civility and chearfulness, and nearly
succeeded; while in him she observed only an expressive
attention, without any marks of presumption.</P>
<P>Thus began and thus ended the evening. Edgar ne∣ver
appeared.</P>
<P>Camilla was in the utmost amaze and deepest vexa∣tion.
Why did he stay away? was his wrath so great
at her own failure the preceding night, that he purposely
avoided her? what, also, could she do with Sir Sed∣ley?
how meet him the next morning without the draft
she had now promised?”</P>
<P>In this state of extreme chagrin, when she retired to
her chamber, she found the following letter upon her
table:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Miss Camilla Tyrold.</HEAD>
<P>CAN you think of such a trifle? or deem wealth so
truly contemptible, as to deny it all honourable employ∣ment?
Ah, rather, enchanting Camilla! deign further
to aid me in dispensing it worthily!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>SEDLEY CLARENDEL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Camilla now was touched, penetrated, and distressed
beyond what she had been in any former time. She
<PB N="237" REF="38"/>
looked upon this letter as a positive intimation of the
most serious designs; and all his good qualities, as
painted by Mrs. Arlbery, with the very singular obliga∣tion
she owed to him, rose up formidably to support the
arguments and remonstrances of that lady; though every
feeling of her heart, every sentiment of her mind, and
every wish of her soul, opposed their smallest weight.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Helper.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, as Camilla had accompanied
Mrs. Berlinton, in earnest discourse, from her cham∣ber
to the hall, she heard the postman say Miss Tyrold
as he gave in a letter. She seized it, saw the hand∣writing
of Lionel, and ran eagerly into the parlour,
which was empty, to read it, in some hopes it would at
least contain an acknowledgment of the draft, that might
be shewn to Sir Sedley, and relieve her from the pain
of continuing the principal in such an affair.</P>
<P>The letter, however, was merely a sportive rhapsody,
beginning; <HI>My dear Lady Clarendel;</HI> desiring her fa∣vour
and protection, and telling her he had done what
he could for her honour, by adding two trophies to
the victorious car of Hymen, driven by the happy
Baronet.</P>
<P>Wholly at a loss how to act, she sat ruminating over
this letter, till Mrs. Arlbery opened the door. Hav∣ing
no time to fold it, and dreading her seeing the first
words, she threw her handkerchief, which was then in
her hand, over it, upon the table, hoping presently to
draw it away unperceived.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="39"/>
“My dear friend,” said Mrs. Arlbery, “I am glad
to see you a moment alone. Do you know any thing
of Mandlebert?”</P>
<P>“No!” answered she affrighted, lest any evil had hap∣pened.</P>
<P>“Did he not take leave of you at the rooms the other
night!”</P>
<P>“Leave of me? is he gone any where!”</P>
<P>“He has left Tunbridge.”</P>
<P>Camilla remained stupified.</P>
<P>“Left it,” she continued, “without the poor civi∣lity
to call, to ask if you had any letters or messages for
Hampshire”</P>
<P>Camilla coloured high; she felt to her heart this evi∣dent
coldness, and she knew it to be still more marked
than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs Arlbery could divine; for he was aware she
wished particularly to speak with him; and though
she had failed in her appointment, he had not inquired
why.</P>
<P>“And this is the man for whom you would relinquish
all mankind? this is the grateful character who is to
render you insensible to ever body?”</P>
<P>The disturbed mind of Camilla needed not this speech;
her debt to Sir Sedley, cast wholly upon herself by the
thoughtless Lionel; her inability to pay it, the impres∣sive
lines the Baronet had addressed to her▪ an the
cruel and pointed indifference of Edgar, all forcibly unit∣ed
to make her wish, at this moment, her heart at her
own disposal.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, the voice of Sir Sedley, gaily sing∣ing,
caught her ear. He was entering the hall, the
street door being open. She started up; Mrs Arlbery
would have detained her, but she could not endure to
encounter him, and without returning his salutation, or
listening to his address, crossed him in the hall, and flew
up stairs.</P>
<P>There, however, she had scarcely taken breath, when
she recollected the letter which she had left upon the
table▪ and which the afflicting intelligence that Edgar
had quitted Tunbridge, had made her forget she had
received. In a terror immeasurable, lest her handker∣chief
<PB N="239" REF="40"/>
should be drawn aside, and betray the first line,
she re-descended the stairs, and hastily entered the
room. Her shock was then inexpressible. The hand∣kerchief,
which her own quick motion in retiring had
displaced, was upon the floor, the letter was in full
view; the eyes of Sir Sedley were fixed upon his own
name, with a look indefinable between pleasure and im∣pertinence,
and Mrs. Arlbery was laughing with all her
might.</P>
<P>She seized the letter, and was running away with it,
when Mrs. Arlbery slipt out of the room▪ and Sir Sed∣ley,
shutting the door, half archly half tenderly re∣peated,
from the letter, “My dear Lady Claren∣del!”</P>
<P>In a perfect agony, she hid her face, exclaiming: “O
Lionel! my foolish—cruel brother!”—</P>
<P>“Not foolish not cruel, I think him,” cried Sir Sed∣ley,
taking her hand, “but amiable—he has done ho∣nour
to my name, and he will use it, I hope, henceforth,
as his own.”</P>
<P>“Forget, forget his flippancy,” cried she, withdraw∣ing
impatiently her hand: “and pardon his sister's breach
of engagement for this morning. I hope soon, very
soon, to repair it, and I hope—”</P>
<P>She did not know what to add; she stopt, stammered,
and then endeavoured to make her retreat.</P>
<P>“Do not go▪” cried he, gently detaining her; “in∣comparable
Camilla! I have a thousand things to say to
you. Will you not hear them?”</P>
<P>“No!” cried she, disengaging herself; “no, no,
no! I can hear nothing!—”</P>
<P>“Do you fascinate then, said he, half reproachfully,
“like the rattlesnake, only to destroy?”</P>
<P>Camilla conceived this as alluding to her recent en∣couragement,
and stood trembling with expectation it
would be followed by a claim upon her justice.</P>
<P>But Sir Sedley, who was far from any meaning so
pointed, lightly added, “What thus agitates the fairest
of creatures? can she fear a poor captive entangled in
the witchery of her loveliness, and only the more en∣slaved
the more he struggles to get free I”</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="41"/>
“Let me go,” cried she, eager to stop him; “I be∣seech
you, Sir Sedley!”</P>
<P>“All beauteous Camilla!” said he, retreating yet
still so as to intercept her passage; “I am bound to sub∣mit;
but when may I see you again?”</P>
<P>“At any time,” replied she hastily; “only let me
pass now!”</P>
<P>“At any time! adorable Camilla! be it then to∣night!
be it this evening!—be it at noon—be it—”</P>
<P>“No, no, no, no!” cried she, panting with shame and
alarm; “I donot mean at any time! I spoke without
thought—I mean—”</P>
<P>“Speak so ever and anon,” cried he, “if thought is
my enemy! This evening then—”</P>
<P>He stopt, as if irresolute how to finish his phrase, but
soon added: “Adieu, till this evening, adieu!” and
opened the door for her to pass.</P>
<P>Triumph sat in his eye; exultation spoke in every
feature; yet his voice betrayed constraint, and seemed
checked, as if from fear of entrusting it with his sen∣timents.
The fear, however, was palpably not of diffi∣dence
with respect to Camilla, but of indecision with
regard to himself.</P>
<P>Camilla, almost sinking with shame now hung back,
from a dread of leaving him in this dangerous delusion.
She sat down, and in a faultering voice, said: “Sir
Sedley! hear me, I beg!—”</P>
<P>“Hear you,” cried he, gallantly casting himself at her
feet; “yes! from the fervid rays of the sun, to the
mild lustre of the moon!—from—”</P>
<P>A loud knock at the street door, and a ringing at
the same time at the bell, made him rise, meaning to
shut again the door of the parlour; but he was pre∣vented,
by the entrance of a man into the hall, calling
out, in a voice that reached to every part of the house,
“An express for Miss Camilla Tyrold.”</P>
<P>Camilla started up, concluding it some strange intelli∣gence
concerning Edgar. But a letter was put into her
hand, and she saw it was the writing of Lavinia.</P>
<P>It was short, but most affectionate. It told her that
news was just arrived from the Continent, which gave
<PB N="241" REF="42"/>
reason for hourly expectation of their cousin Lyn∣mere
at Cleves, in consequence of which Sir Hugh
was assembling all the family to receive him. She was
then, with her father, going thither from Etherington,
where the restored health of her uncle had, for a week
past, enabled them to reside, and she was ordered to
send off an express to Tunbridge, to beg Camilla would
prepare immediately for the post-chaise of Sir Hugh,
which would be sent for her, with the Cleves house∣keeper,
and reach Mount Pleasant within a few hours
after this notice.</P>
<P>A hundred questions assailed Camilla when she had
run over this letter, the noise of the express having
brought Mrs. Arlbery and the Dennels into the par∣lour.</P>
<P>She produced the letter, and putting it in the hands
of Mrs. Arlbery, relieved her painful confusion, by
quitting the room without again meeting the eyes of Sir
Sedley.</P>
<P>She could make no preparation, however, for her
journey, from mingled desire and fear of an explanation
with the Baronet before her departure.</P>
<P>Again▪ therefore, in a few minutes she went down;
gathering courage from the horror of a mistake that might
lead to so much mischief.</P>
<P>She found only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. Arlbery in the parlour.</P>
<P>Involuntarily starting, “Where,” she cried, “is Sir
Sedley?”</P>
<P>“He is gone,” answered Mrs. Arlbery, laughing at
her earnestness; “but no doubt you will soon see him
at Cleves.”</P>
<P>“Then I am undone!” cried she, bursting into tears
and running back to her chamber.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery instantly followed, and kindly inquired
what disturbed her.</P>
<P>“O, Mrs. Arlbery” she cried, “lend me, I beseech
you, some aid, and spare me, in pity, your raillery!
Sir Sedley, I fear, greatly mistakes me; set him right, I
conjure you—”</P>
<P>“Me▪ my dear? and do you think if some happy fata∣lity
is at work at this moment to force you to your good,
<PB N="242" REF="43"/>
I will come forth, like your evil genius, to counteract its
operations?”</P>
<P>“I must write then,—yet, in this haste, this confusion,
I fear to involve rather than extricate myself!”</P>
<P>“Ay, write by all means; there is nothing so
prettily forwards these affairs, as a correspondence
between the parties undertaken to put an end to
them.”</P>
<P>She went, laughing, out of the chamber, and Ca∣milla,
who had seized a pen, distressfully flung it from
her.</P>
<P>What indeed could she say? he had made no direct
declaration; she could give, therefore, no direct re∣pulse;
and though, through her brother's cruel want
of all consideration, she was so deeply in his debt, she
durst no longer promise its discharge; for the strange
departure of Edgar robbed her of all courage to make
to him her meditated application.</P>
<P>Yet to leave Sir Sedley in this error was every way
terrible. If, which still seemed very possible, from his
manner and behaviour, he should check his partiality,
and make the whole of what had passed end in mere
public-place gallantry, she must always have the mor∣tification
to know he had considered her as ready to
accept him: If, on the contrary, encouraging what he
felt for her, from the belief she returned his best opi∣nion,
he should seriously demand her hand—how could
she justify the apparent attention she once paid him?
and how assert, while so hopelessly his debtor, the inde∣pendence
to reject one who so many ways seemed to
hold himself secure!</P>
<P>She was broken in upon by Mrs. Mittin, who en∣tered
full of lamentation at the intelligence she had just
heard from Miss Dennel of her sudden departure;
which she ended with, “But as you are going in such
haste, my dear, you must have fifty things to do, so
pray now, let me help you. Come, what shall I pack
up for you? Where's all your things?”</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="44"/>
Camilla, incapable of doing any business for herself,
accepted the offer.</P>
<P>“Well then, now where's your gowns? Bless me!
what a one is here? why it's been in the dew, and then
in the dust, and then in the dew again, till all the bot∣tom
must be cut off; why you can never shew it amongst
your friends; it will quite bring a disgrace upon poor
Tunbridge; come, I think you must give it to me;
I've got a piece of mussin just like it, and I can piece
it so that it won't appear; but it will never do for you
again.”</P>
<P>Camilla was surprised; but her mind was filled with
other matters, and the gown was put apart.</P>
<P>“What! are those all your neck handkerchiefs?
why, my dear Miss Tyrold, that's a thing you want
very bad indeed; why here's one you can never wear
again; it wants more darning than it's worth.”</P>
<P>Camilla said she should have very good time to mend
it at home.</P>
<P>“But then, my dear, you don't consider what a bad
look that will have amongst your friends; what will
they think of poor Tunbridge, that you should have let
it go so far? why, may be they'll never let you
come again; the best way will be not to let them see it;
suppose I take it off your hands? I dare say they don't
know your count.”</P>
<P>At any other time, Camilla would either have resist∣ed
these seizures, or have been diverted by the pretence
that they were made only for her own benefit; but she
was now glad at any rate to get rid of the care of the
package.</P>
<P>When this was over, and Mrs. Mittin had pretty
well paid herself for her trouble: “Well, my dear,”
she cried, “and what can I do for you next? Have
you paid Mrs. Tilldin, and Mr. Doust, and Mr.
Tent?”</P>
<P>These were questions that indeed roused Camilla
from her reverie? she had not once thought of what she
owed to the milliner, to her shoemaker, nor to her ha∣berdasher;
from all of whom she had now, through the
hands of Mrs. Mittin, had various articles. She thank∣ed
<PB N="244" REF="45"/>
her for reminding her of so necessary an attention, and
said she would immediately send for the bills.</P>
<P>“I'll run and pay 'em for you myself,” said Mrs.
Mittin: “for they always take that kind; and as I re∣commended
them all to you, I have a right they should
know how I stand their friend; for there's many an
odd service they may do me in return; so I'll go for
you with all my heart; only give me the money.”</P>
<P>Camilla took out her purse, in which, from her debt
to Sir Sedley, and perpetually current expences, there
now remained but fifteen shillings of her borrowed five
guineas; though latterly, she had wholly denied her∣self
whatever did not seem an expence unavoidable.
What to do she now knew not; for though all she had
ordered had been trifling, she was sure it must amount
to four or five guineas. She had repeatedly refused
to borrow any thing more of Mrs. Arlbery, always
hoping every call for money would be the last; but she
was too inexperienced to know, that in gay circles, and
public places, the demands for wealth are endless and
countless; and that oeconomy itself, which is always lo∣cal,
is there lavish and extravagant, compared with its
character, in private scenes and retired life.</P>
<P>Yet was this the last moment to apply to Mrs. Arl∣bury
upon such a subject, since it would be endowing
her with fresh arms to fight the cause of Sir Sedley. She
sat still, and ruminating, till Mrs. Mittin, who with∣out
scruple had taken a full inventory of the contents
of the purse, exclaimed: “La! my dear, why sure I
hope that i'n't all you've got left?”</P>
<P>Camilla was fain to confess she had nothing more at
Tunbridge.</P>
<P>“Well, don't be uneasy, my dear,” cried she, “and
I'll go to 'em all, and be caution for you, till you get the
money.”</P>
<P>Camilla thanked her very sincerely, and again resum∣ed
her first opinion of her real good nature, and kind∣ness
of heart. She took her direction in London,
whither she was soon to return, and promised, in a
short time, to transmit the money for her to distribute,
<PB N="245" REF="46"/>
as every one of the shop-keepers went to the metropo∣lis
in the winter.</P>
<P>Delighted both with the praise and the commission,
Mrs. Mirtin took leave; and Camilla determined to
employ her next quarter's allowance in paying these
debts, and frankly to beg from her uncle the five guineas
that were due to Mrs Arlbery.</P>
<P>She then wrote an affectionate adieu to Mrs. Ber∣linton,
intreating to hear from her at Etherington;
and, while she was sealing it. Mrs Arlbery came to
embrace her, as the carriage was at the door.</P>
<P>Camilla, in making her acknowledgments for the
kindness she had received, intermingled a petition, that
at least, she would not augment, if she refused to clear
the mistake of Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>“I believe be may safely,” she answered, “be left
to himself; though it is plain that, at this moment, he
is in a difficulty as great as your own; for marriage he
still resists, though he finds you resistless. I wish you
mutually to be parted till—pardon me, my fair friend—
your understandings are mutually cleared, and he is
divested of what is too factitious, and you of what is too
artless. Your situation is, indeed rather whimsical;
for the two mortals with whom you have to deal require
treatment diametrically opposite; yet humour them a
little adroitly, and you presently gain them both. He
that is proud, must be distanced; he that is vain, must
be flattered. This is paying them with their own coin;
but they hold no other to be current. Pride, if not
humbled, degenerates into contempt; vanity, if not in∣dulged,
dissolves into indifference.”</P>
<P>Camilla disclaimed taking any measures with respect
to either; but Mrs. Arlbery insisted the field would be
won by Sir Sedley, “who is already,” she cried,
“persuaded you have for some time encouraged him,
and that now you are fully propitious—”</P>
<P>Camilla hastily interrupted her: “O, Mrs. Arl∣bery!”
she cried, “I cannot endure this! add
not to my disturbance by making it my own
work!”</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="47"/>
She then embraced her; took leave of the Dennels,
and with the house keeper of Sir Hugh set out from
Tunbridge for Cleves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="27" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The right Style of Arguing.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA was received with the most tender joy by
all her family, again re-assembled at Cleves to welcome
the return of young Lynmere, who was expected every
hour. Sir Hugh, perfectly recovered from his late ill∣ness,
and busy, notwithstanding all remonstrance, in
preparation for the approaching nuptials, was in spirits
that exhilarated whoever saw him. Eugenia awaited
that event with gentleness, though with varying sensa∣tions;
from fears, lest her personal misfortunes should
prove repulsive to Clermont, and from wishes to find
him resembling Melmond in talents, and Bellamy in
passion and constancy.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne gave now his lessons with redoubled
assiduity, from an ambition to produce to the scholastic
traveller, a phenomenon of his own workmanship in a
learned young female: nor were his toils less ready,
nor less pleasant, for a secret surmise they would shortly
end; though not till honour should be united with in∣dependence,
for his recompence. But Miss Margland
fretted, that this wedding would advance no London
journey; and Indiana could not for a moment recover
from her indignation, that the deformed and ugly Eu∣genia,
though two years younger than herself, should
be married before her. Lavinia had no thought but for
the happiness of her sister; and Mr. Tyrold lamented
the absence of his wife, who, alike from understanding
<PB N="247" REF="48"/>
and affection, was the only person to properly superin∣tend
this affair, but from whom Dr. Marchmont, just
arrived, brought very faint hopes of a speedy return.</P>
<P>Eugenia, however, was not the sole care of her fa∣ther,
at this period. The countenance of Camilla soon
betrayed, to his inquiring eyes, the inefficacy of the
Tunbridge journey. But he forbore all question; and
left to time or her choice to unravel, if new incidents
kept alive her inquietude, or, if no incident at all had
been equally prejudicial to her repose.</P>
<P>Two days after, while Camilla, still astonished by no
news, nor sight of Edgar, was sitting with her sisters,
and recounting to them her late adventures, and present
difficulties, with Sir Sedley Clarendel, Jacob brought
her, in its own superb bird-cage, the learned little bull∣finch;
telling her, it had been delivered to him without
any message, by a man who said she had left it, by mis∣take,
at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unbridge, whence he had had orders to fol∣low
her with it to Cleves park.</P>
<P>She was much provoked thus to receive it. Mrs.
Arlbery had pressed her to take it in her uncle's chaise,
which she had firmly refused; and she now concluded
this method was adopted, that Sir Sedley might ima∣gine
she detained it as his gift.</P>
<P>In drawing out, soon after, the receptacle for the
bird's nourishment, she perceived, written with a pencil
upon the wood, these words: “Thou art gone then,
fair fugitive! Ah! at least, fly only where thou mayst
be pursued!”</P>
<P>This writing had not been visible till the machine was
taken out to be replenished. She recollected the hand
of Sir Sedley, and was now sure it was sent by him∣self,
and could no longer, therefore, doubt his intenti∣ons
being serious.</P>
<P>With infinite perplexity she consulted with her sis∣ters;
but, when candidly she had related, that once, to
her never-ending regret, she had apparently welcomed
his civilities, Eugenia pronounced her rectitude to be
engaged by that error, as strongly as her gratitude by
<PB N="248" REF="49"/>
the preservation of her life, and the extraordinary ser∣vice
done to Lionel, not to reject the young baronet,
should he make his proposals.</P>
<P>She heard this opinion with horror. Timid shame,
and the counsel of her father, united to impede her
naming the internal obstacles which she felt to be insur∣mountable:
and, while casting up, in silence, her ap∣pealing
eyes to Heaven, for relief, from the intricacy
in which she found herself involved, she saw Lionel gal∣loping
into the park.</P>
<P>She flew to meet him, and he dismounted, and led
his h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse, to walk with her</P>
<P>She flattered herself, she might now represent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the
mischief he was doing, and obtain from him some re∣dress.
But he was more wild and impracticable than
ever. “Well▪ my dear girl,' he cried, “when are
all these betterings and worsings to take place? Numps
has sent for me to see poor little Greek and Latin hob∣ble
to the altar; but 'tis a million to one, if our noble
baronet does not wisk you there before her. He's a
charming fellow, faith. I had a good long confab with
him this morning.”</P>
<P>“This morning? I hope, then, you were so good,
so just, as to tell him when you mean to pay the money
you have borrowed?</P>
<P>“My dear child, I often think you were born but
yesterday, only, by some accident, you came into the
world, like Minerva, grown up and ready dressed.
What makes you think I mean to pay him? Have I
given him any bond?”</P>
<P>“A bond? Is that necessary to justice and ho∣nour?”</P>
<P>“If I had asked the money, you are right, my dear;
I ought, then, certainly, to refund. But, as it now
stands, 'tis his own affair. I have nothing to do with
it: except, indeed, receiving the dear little golden
boys, and making merry with them.”</P>
<P>“O fie, Lionel, fie!”</P>
<P>“Why, what had I to do with it? Do you think he
would care one sig if he saw me sunk to the bottom of
the Red Sea? No, my dear, no; you are the little deb∣tor;
<PB N="249" REF="50"/>
so balance your accounts for yourself, and don't
cast them upon your poor neighbours, who have full
enough to settle of their own.”</P>
<P>Camilla was thunderstruck; “And have you been
so cruel,” she cried, “seeing the matter in such a light,
to place me in such a predicament?”</P>
<P>“Cruel, my dear girl? why, what will it cost you,
except a dimple or two the more? And don't you know
you always look best when you smile? I assure you, it's
a mercy he don't see you when you are giving me one
of my lectures. It disfigures you so horribly, that he'd
take fright and never speak to you again.”</P>
<P>“What can I ever say, to make you hear me, or
feel for me? Tell me, at least, what has passed this
morning; and assure me that nothing new, nothing yet
worse, has occurred.”</P>
<P>“O no, nothing at all. All is in the fairest train
possible. I dare say, he'll come hither, upon the grand
question, before sun-set.”</P>
<P>Camilla gasped for breath, and was some time before
she could ask whence he drew such a conclusion.</P>
<P>“O, because I see he's in for it. I have a pretty
good eye, my dear! He said, too▪ he had such a pro∣digious—
friendship, I think he called it, for you, that
he was immeasurably happy, and all that, to be of the
least service to your brother. A fine fellow, upon my
word! a fine generous spark as ever I saw. He charg∣ed
me to call upon him freely when I had any little em∣barrassment,
or difficulty, or was hard run, or things
of that sort. He's a fine buck, I tell you, and knows
the world perfectly, that I promise you. He's none of
your drivellers, none of your ignoramuses. He has
the true notion of things. He's just a right friend for
me. You could not have made a better match.”</P>
<P>Camilla, in the most solemn manner, protested her∣self
disengaged in thought, word, and deed; and de∣clared
her fixed intention so to continue. But he only
laughed at her declarations, calling them maidenly fibs;
and, assuring her, the young baronet was so much in
earnest, she might as well be sincere as not. “Be∣sides,”
he added, “'tis not fair to trifle where a man
<PB N="250" REF="51"/>
behaves so handsomely and honourably. Consider the
£. 200!”</P>
<P>“I shall quite lose my senses, Lionel!” cried she,
in an agony; “I shall quite lose my senses if you speak
in this manner.”</P>
<P>Lionel shouted aloud; “Why, my dear girl, what
is £. 200 to Sir Sedley Clarendel? You talk as if he
had twenty pounds a-year for pin-money, like you and
Lavinia, that might go with half a gown a-year, if
good old Numps did not help you. Why, he's as rich
as Croosus, child. Besides, he would have been quite
affronted if I had talked of paying him such a trifle, for
he offered me any thing I pleased. O, he knows the
world, I promise you! He's none of your starched
prigs. He knows life, my dear! He said, he could
perfectly conceive how hard it must be to a lad of spi∣rit,
like me, to be always exact. I don't know that I
ever made a more agreeable acquaintance in my life.”</P>
<P>Camilla was in an agitation that made him regard
her, for a moment, with a serious surprise; but his na∣tural
levity soon resumed its post, and, laughing at him∣self
for being nearly, he said, taken in, by her childish
freaks, he protested he would bite no more: “For,
after all, you must not think to make a fool of me, my
dear. It won't do. I'm too knowing. Do you sup∣pose,
if he had not already made up his mind to the
noose, and was not sure you had made up yours to let∣ting
it be tied, he would have cared for poor me, and
my scrapes? No, no; whatever he does for me, before
you are married, you may set down in your own me∣morandum
book: whatever he may please to do after∣wards,
I am content should be charged to poor Pill∣garlic.”</P>
<P>He then bid her good-morrow, by the name of Lady
Clarendel; and said, he would go and see if little Greek
and Latin were as prepoiterous a prude about young
Lynmere.</P>
<P>Camilla remained almost petrified with amazement at
her own situation; and only was deterred from imme∣diately
opening her whole heart and affairs to her father,
with the confidence to which his indulgence entitled
<PB N="251" REF="52"/>
him, by the impossibility of explaining her full distress
without betraying her brother.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="28" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Council.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, Camilla, eager to try once more
her influence with her brother, accompanied him into
the park, and renewed her remonstrances, but with no
better success; and while they were passing by a private
gate, that opened to the high road, they saw Sir Sedley
Clarendel driving by in his phaeton.</P>
<P>Lionel, bursting from his sister, opened the gate,
called to Sir Sedley to give his reins to one of his ser∣vants,
and brought him, not unwilling, though much
surprised, into the park.</P>
<P>Camilla, in dismay unspeakable at this conduct, and
the idea of such a meeting, had run forward instantly to
hide herself in the summer house, to avoid re-passing the
gate in her way to the mansion; but her scheme was
more precipitate than wise; Lionel caught a glimpse
of her gown as she went into the little building, and
shouted aloud: “Look! look! Sir Sedley! there's
Camilla making believe to run away from you!”</P>
<P>“Ah, fair fugitive!” cried the Baronet springing
forward and entering the summer-house almost as soon
as herself, “fly only thus, where you may be pursued!”</P>
<P>Camilla utterly confounded, knew not where to cast
her eyes, where to hide her face; and her quick-chang∣ing
colour, and short-heaved breath, manifested an ex∣cess
of confusion, that touched, flattered, and pene∣trated
the baronet so deeply and so suddenly, as to put
him off from all guard of consequences, and all recol∣lection
<PB N="252" REF="53"/>
of matrimonial distaste: “Beautiful, resistless
Camilla!” he cried; “how vain is it tostruggle against
your witchery! Assure me but of your clemency, and
I will adore the chains that shackle me!”</P>
<P>Camilla, wholly overcome, by sorrow, gratitude, re∣pentance,
and shame, sunk upon a chair, and shed a tor∣rent
of tears that she even sought not to restrain. The
shock of refusing one to whose error in believing himself
acceptable she had largely contributed, or the horror of
yielding to him her hand, while her heart was in the
possession of another, made her almost wish, at this mo∣ment,
he should divine her distress, that his own pride
might conclude it.</P>
<P>But far different from what would produce such an
effect, were the feelings of pride now working in his
bosom. He imagined her emotion had its fource in
causes the softest and most flattering Every personal
obstacle sunk before this idea, and with a seriousness
in his manner he had not yet used: “This evening,
lovely Camilla,” he cried, “let me beg for this even∣ing,
the audience accorded me upon that which I lost at
Tunbridge.”</P>
<P>He was then going; but Camilla, hastily rising,
cried, “Sir Sedley, I beseech—” when Lionel caper∣ing
into the little apartment, danced round it in mad
ecstasy, chanting, “Lady Clarendel, Lady Clarendel,
my dear Lady Clarendel!”</P>
<P>Camilla now was not confused alone. Sir Sedley
himself could gladly have pushed him out of the build∣ing;
but neither the looks of surprise and provocation
of the Baronet, nor the prayers nor reprimands of Ca∣milla,
could tame his wild transport. He shook hands,
whether he would or not, with the one; he bowed most
obsequiously, whether she would regard him or not, to
the other; and still chanting the same burden, made
a clamour that shook the little edifice to its foundation.</P>
<P>The strong taste for ridicule, that was a prominent
part of the character of Sir Sedley, was soon conquered
by this ludicrous behaviour, and both his amazement
and displeasure ended in a hearty sit of laughter. But
Camilla suffered too severely to join in the mirth; she
<PB N="253" REF="54"/>
blushed for her brother, she blushed for herself, she hung
her head in speechless shame, and covered her eyes
with her hand.</P>
<P>The noisy merriment of Lionel preventing any ex∣planation,
though rendering it every moment more ne∣cessary,
Sir Sedley, repeating his request for the even∣ing,
took leave.</P>
<P>Camilla looked upon his departing in this manner
as her sentence to misery, and was pursuing him, to
decline the visit; but Lionel, seizing her two hands,
swung her round the room, in defiance of her even an∣gry
expostulations and sufferings, which he neither
credited nor conceived, and then skipt after the baronet
himself, who was already out of the park.</P>
<P>She became now nearly frantic. She thought her∣self
irretrievably in the power of Sir Sedley, and by
means so forced and indelicate, that she was scarcely
more afflicted at the event, than shocked by its circum∣stances;
and though incapable to really harbour ran∣cour
against a brother she sincerely loved, she yet be∣lieved
at this moment she never should forgive, nor will∣ingly
see him more.</P>
<P>In this state she was found by Lavinia. The his∣tory
was inarticulately told, but Lavinia could give only
her pity; she saw not any avenue to an honourable re∣treat,
and thought, like Eugenia, she could now only
free herself by the breach of what should be dearer
to her even than happiness, her probity and honour.</P>
<P>Utterly inconsolable she remained, till again she
heard the voice of Lionel, loudly singing in the park.</P>
<P>“Go to him! go to him! my dearest Lavinia,” she
cried, “and, if my peace is dear to you, prevail with
him to clear up the mistakes of Sir Sedley, and to pre∣vent
his dreaded, killing visit this evening!”</P>
<P>Lavinia only answered by compliance; but, after
an half hour's useless contest with her riotous brother,
returned to her weeping sister, not merely successless
with regard to her petition, but loaded with fresh ill
tidings that she knew not how to impart. Lionel had
only laughed at the repugnance of Camilla, which he
regarded as something between childishness and af∣fectation,
<PB N="254" REF="55"/>
and begged Lavinia to be wiser than to heed to
it: “Brother Sedley has desired me, however,” he
added, “not to speak of the matter to Numps nor my
father, till he has had a little more conversation with
his charmer; and he intends to call to-night as if only
upon a visit to me.”</P>
<P>When Camilla learnt, at length, this painful end
of her embassy, she gave herself up so completely to
despair, that Lavinia affrighted, ran to the house for
Eugenia, whose extreme youth was no impediment in
the minds of her liberal sisters, to their belief nor re∣verence
of her superior wisdom. Her species of edu∣cation
had early prepossessed them with respect for her
knowledge, and her unaffected fondness for study,
had fixed their opinion of her extraordinary under∣standing.
The goodness of her heart, the evenness of
her temper, and her natural turn to contemplation, had
established her character alike for sanctity and for phi∣losophy
throughout the family.</P>
<P>She listened with the sincerest commiseration to the
present state of the case: “Certainly,” she cried, “you
cannot in honour, now refuse him; but deal with him
sincerely, and he may generously himself relinquish his
claims. Write to him, my dear Camilla; tell him you
grieve to afflict, yet disdain to deceive him; assure
him of your perfect esteem and eternal gratitude; but
confess, at once, your heart refuses to return his ten∣derness.
Entreat him to forgive whatever he may
have mistaken, and nobly to restore to you the liberty of
which your obligations, without his consent must rob
you.”</P>
<P>To Lavinia this advice appeared infallible; but Ca∣milla,
though she felt an entanglement which fettered
herself, thought it by no means sufficiently direct or
clear to authorise a rejection of Sir Sedley; since,
strangely as she seemed in his power, circumstances
had placed her there, and not his own solicitation.</P>
<P>Yet to prevent a visit of which her knowledge seemed
consent, and which her consent must be most seriously
to authorise, she deemed as indispensable to her charac∣ter,
as to her fears. She hesitated therefore not a mo∣ment
<PB N="255" REF="56"/>
in preferring writing to a meeting; and after va∣rious
conversations, and various essays, the following
billet was dispatched to Clarendel Place, through
the means of Molly Mill, and by her friend Tommy
Hodd.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir Sedley Clarendel.</HEAD>
<P>I SHOULD ill return what I owe to Sir Sedley Cla∣rendel
by causing him any useless trouble I can spare
him. He spoke of a visit hither this evening, when I
was too much hurried to represent that it could not be
received, as my brother's residence is at Ethrington, and
my father and my uncle have not the honour to be

ever be unalterable; and where accident occasions a

<P>Ill as this letter satisfied her, she could devise nothing
better; but though her sisters had both thought it too
rigorous, she would not risk any thing gentler.</P>
<P>During the dinner, they all appeared absent and de∣jected;
but Sir Hugh attributed it to the non-arrival
of Clermont in watching for whom his own time was
completely occupied, by examining two weather-cocks,
and walking from one to the other, to see if they
agreed, or how they changed; Indiana was wholly en∣grossed
in consultations with Miss Margland, upon the
most becoming dress for a bride's maid; and Mr.
Tyrold having observed that his three girls had spent
the morning together, concluded Camilla had divulged
to them her unhappy perplexity, and felt soothed him∣self
in considering she had soothers so affectionate and
faithful.</P>
<P>Early in the evening Tommy Hodd arrived, and
Molly Mill brought Camilla the following answer of
Sir Sedley.</P>

<HEAD>Miss Camilla Tyrold.</HEAD>
<P>AH! what in this lower sphere can be unchequered,
when even a correspondence with the most lovely of her
sex, brings alarm with its felicity? Must I come, then,
to Cleves, fair Insensible, but as a visitor to Mr. Lionel?
Have you taken a captive only to see him in fetters?
Allured a victim merely to behold him bleed? Ah!
to-morrow, at least, permit the audience that to-day
is denied, and at your feet, let your slave receive his
doom.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Camilla turned cold. She shrunk from a remon∣strance
she conceived she had merited, and regarded
herself to be henceforth either culpable or unhappy.
Unacquainted with the feminine indulgence which the
world by long prescription, grants to coquetry, its
name was scarcely known to her; and she saw in its
own native egotism the ungenerous desire to please,
where she herself was indifferent, and anticipated from
Sir Sedley reproach, if not contempt. No sophistica∣tions
of custom had warped the first innocence of her
innate sense of right, and to trifle with the feelings of
another for any gratification of her own, made success
bring a blush to her integrity, not exultation to her va∣nity.</P>
<P>The words <HI>victim</HI> and <HI>bleeding,</HI> much affected the ten∣der
Lavinia, while those of <HI>fetters, captive,</HI> and <HI>insensible,</HI>
satisfied the herioc Eugenia that Sir Sedley deserved
the hand of her sister; but neither of them spoke.</P>
<P>“You say nothing?” cried Camilla turning paler and
paler, and sitting down lest she should fall.</P>
<P>They both wept and embraced her, and Eugenia
said, if, indeed, she could not conquer her aversion,
she saw no way to elude the baronet, but by openly
confessing her repugnance, in the conversation he de∣manded.</P>
<P>Camilla saw not less strongly the necessity of being
both prompt and explicit; but how receive Sir Sedley
<PB N="257" REF="58"/>
at Cleves? and upon what pretence converse with him
privately? Even Lionel the next day was to return to
the university, though his presence if he staid, would,
in all probability but add to every difficulty.</P>
<P>At length, they decided, that the conference should
take place at the Grove; and to prevent the threatened
visit of the next day, Camilla wrote the following an∣swer:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir Sedley Clarendel.</HEAD>
<P>I SHOULD be grieved, indeed, to return my obliga∣tions
to Sir Sedley Clarendel by meriting his serious
reproach; yet I cannot have the honour of seeing him
at Cleves, since my brother is immediately quitting it
for Oxford. As soon as I hear Mrs. Arlbery is again
at the Grove, I shall wait upon her, and always be
most happy to assure Sir Sedley of my gratitude,
which will be as lasting as it is sincere.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>CAMILLA TYROLD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Though wretched in this strange state of things, she
knew not how to word her letter more positively, since
his own, notwithstanding its inferences, had so much
more the style of florid gallantry than plain truth.
Molly Mill undertook that Tommy Hodd should carry
it early the next morning.</P>
<P>Lionel was so enraged at the non-appearance of the
young baronet at night, that Camilla was compelled to
confess she had promised to see him, and to give him
his answer at Mrs. Arlbery's. He was out of humour,
neverthaless, lest Sir Sedley should be affronted by the
delay, and feared that the best match in the whole
county would prove abortive, from his sister's foolish
trimmings, and silly ignorance of life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Proposal of Marriage.</HEAD>
<P>THE increasing depression of Camilla, and the me∣lancholy
of her sympathising sisters, though still attri∣buted
to the adverse wind by the compass-watching ba∣ronet,
escaped not the notice of Mr. Tyrold; who,
alarmed for the peace of his daughter, determined to
watch for the first quiet opportunity of investigating her
actual situation.</P>
<P>Lionel, after breakfast, the next morning, was obli∣ged
to relinquish waiting for Clermont, and to set off
for Oxford. He contrived to whisper to Camilla, that
he hoped she would be a good girl at last, and not play
the fool; but, finding she only sighed, he laughed at
her calamitous state, in becoming mistress of fifteen
thousand per annum, only by the small trouble of run∣ning
over a short ceremony; and, assuring her he
would assist her off with part of the charge, if it were
too heavy for her, bid her inform him in time of the
propitious day.</P>
<P>Camilla, shortly after, saw from her window, gal∣lopping
full speed across the park to the house, Major
Cerwood. She suspected her tormenting brother to
have been again at work; nor was she mistaken. He
had met with the Major at the hotel at Tunbridge,
while his spirits, always violent, were in a state of al∣most
intoxication of delight, at the first idea of such
an accession to his powers of amusement, as a new bro∣ther
rolling in immense wealth, which he already con∣sidered
as nearly at his own disposal. High wrought,
therefore, for what he deemed good sport, he confirm∣ed
what he had asserted at the ball at Northwick, of
the expectations of Camilla from Sir Hugh, by relat∣ing
the public fact, of her having been announced, to
<PB N="259" REF="60"/>
the family and neighbourhood, for his uncle's heiress,
at ten years of age; and only sinking, in his account,
the revocation made so soon after in favour of Eu∣genia.
To this, he added his advice, that no time was
to be lost, as numberless new suitors were likely to
pursue her from Tunbridge.</P>
<P>The Major, upon alighting, inquired for Sir Hugh,
deeming Mr. Tyrold of little consequence, since it
was not from him Camilla was to inherit her fortune.</P>
<P>The baronet, as usual, was watching the winds and
the clouds; but, concluding whoever came would bring
some news from Clermont, received the Major with
the utmost cordiality, saying: “I see, sir, you are a
stranger; by which I suppose you to be just come from
abroad; where, I hope you left all well?”</P>
<P>“I am just come, sir,” answered the Major, “from
Tunbridge, where I had the honour, through my ac∣quaintance
with Mrs. Arlbery, of meeting daily
with your charming niece; an honour, fir, which
must cause all the future happiness or misery of my
life.”</P>
<P>He then made a declaration, in form, of the most
ardent passion for Camilla; mentioned his family, which
was an honourable one; talked of his expectations with
confidence, though vaguely; and desired to leave the
disposition of the settlement wholly to the Baronet;
who he hoped, would not refuse to see his elder bro∣ther,
a gentleman of fortune in Lincolnshire, who
would have the honour to wait upon him at any time he
would be so good as to appoint, upon this momentous
affair.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh heard this harangue with consternation.
The Major was in the prime of life, his person was
good, his speech was florid, his air was assured, and
his regimentals were gay. Not a doubt of his success
occurred to the Baronet; who saw, in one blow, the
darling scheme of his old age demolished in the depriva∣tion
of Camilla.</P>
<P>The Major impatiently waited for an answer; but
Sir Hugh was too much disordered to frame one; he
walked up and down the room, muttering, in a de∣sponding
<PB N="260" REF="61"/>
manner, to himself, “Lord, help us! what
a set of poor weak mortals we are, we poor men! The
best schemes and plans in the world always coming to
nothing before we can bring them about! I'll never
form another while I live, for the sake of this one
warning. Nobody knows, next, but what Clermont
will be carrying off Eugenia to see foreign parts! and
then comes some other of these red-coats to take away
Indiana; and, after doing all for the best so long, I
may be left all alone, except just for Mrs. Margland and
the Doctor! that I don't take much pleasure in, Lord
help me! except as a Christian, which I hope is no
sin.”</P>
<P>At length endeavouring to compose himself, he sat
down, and said, “So you are come, sir, to take away
from me my own particular little niece? which is a
hard thing upon an uncle, intending her to live with
him. However, I don't mean to find fault; but I can
tell you this one thing, sir, which I beg you to re∣member;
which is, if you don't make her happy, you'll
break my heart! For she's what I love the best in the
world, little as I've made it appear, by not leaving her
a shilling. For which sake, however, I can't but re∣spect
you the more for coming after her, instead of Eu∣genia.”</P>
<P>“Sir?” cried the Major, amazed.</P>
<P>“The other two chaps,” continued he, “that came
about us not long ago, wanted to make their court to
Eugenia and Indiana; as well as another that came
to the house when I was ill, in the same coat as your∣self,
by what I can gather from the description; but
never a one has come to Camilla yet, except yourself,
because my brother can spare her but a trifle, having
another young girl to provide for▪ besides Lionel;
which is the most expensive of them all, poor boy! ne∣ver
having enough, by the reason Oxford is so dear, as
suppose.”</P>
<P>The Major now wore an air of surprise and uneasi∣ness
that Sir Hugh began to observe, but attributed to
his unpleasant reception of his proposals. He begged his
pardon, therefore, and again assured him of his respect for
<PB N="261" REF="62"/>
a choice so little mercenary, which he looked upon as a
mark of a good heart.</P>
<P>The Major, completely staggered, and suspect∣ing
the information of Lionel to be ill grounded, if
not purposely deluding, entreated his permission to
wait upon him again; and offered for the present to
take leave.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, in a melancholy voice, said, he would
first summon his niece, as he could not answer it to
his conscience preventing the meeting, unless she gave
him leave.</P>
<P>He then rang the bell, and told Jacob to call Ca∣milla.</P>
<P>Major Cerwood was excessively distressed. To re∣treat
seemed impossible; yet to connect himself without
fortune, when he thought he was addressing a rich
heiress, was a turn of fate he scarcely know how either
to support or to parry. All that, in this haste, he
could resolve, was, to let the matter pass for the mo∣ment,
and then insist upon satisfaction from Lionel,
either in clearing up the mistake, or taking upon himself
its blame.</P>
<P>When Camilla appeared, the disturbance of Sir Hugh
still augmented; and he could hardly articulate, “My
dear, in the case you are willing to leave your family,
here's a gentleman come to make his addresses to you;
which I think it right you should know, though how I
shall struggle through it, if I lose you, is more than my
poor weak head can tell; for what shall I do without
my dear little girl, that I thought to make the best
comfort of my old age? which, however, I beg you
not to think of in case this young captain's more
agreeable.”</P>
<P>“Ah! my dear uncle!” cried she, “your Camilla
can never return half the comfort she receives from you!
keep me with you still, and ever! I am much obliged
to Major Cerwood. I beg him to accept my sincerest
thanks; but to pardon me when I assure him, they are
all I have to offer him.”</P>
<P>Repulse was not new to the Major; who, in vari∣ous
country towns had sought to retrieve his affairs by
<PB N="262" REF="63"/>
some prudent connection; his pride, however, had
never so little suffered as on the present occasion, for
his apprehension of error or imposition had removed
from him all thought of even the possibility of a refusal;
which, now, therefore, unexpectedly and joyfully ob∣viated
his embarrassment, and enabled him to quit the
field by an honourable retreat. He bowed profoundly,
called himself, without knowing what he said, the most
unhappy of men; and, without risking one solicitation,
or a moment for repentance, hastily took leave, with
intention, immediately, to demand an explanation of
Lionel.</P>
<P>But he had not escaped a mile from the house, ere he
gave up that design, from anticipating the ridicule that
might follow it. To require satisfaction for a young
lady's want of fortune, however reasonable, would al∣ways
be derided as ludicrous. He resolved therefore,
quietly to put up with the rejection; and to gather his
next documents concerning the portion of a fair damsel,
from authority better to be relied upon than that of a
brother.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh for some time, discovered not that he had
retired. Enchanted by so unexpected a dimission, his
favourite scheme of life seemed accorded to him, and
he pressed Camilla to his bosom, in a transport of
joy. “We shall live together, now, I hope,” he
cried, “without any of these young chaps coming in
again to part us. Not that I would object to your mar∣rying,
my dear girl, if it was with a relation, like
Eugenia, or, with a neighbour, like Indiana, if it
had not been for its going off; but to see you taken
away from me by a m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re stranger, coming from distant
parts, and knowing nothing of any of us, is a thing
that makes my heart ache but to think of; so I hope it
will happen no more; for these trials do not good to my
recovery.”</P>
<P>Turning round, then, with a view to say something
consolatory to the Major, he was seriously concerned to
find him departed. “I can't say,” he cried, “I had any
intention to send him off so short, his meaning not be∣ing
bad, considering him in the light of a person in love;
<PB N="263" REF="64"/>
which is a time when a man has not much thought,
except for himself, by what I can gather.”</P>
<P>He then proposed a walk, to watch if Clermont were
coming. The wind, he acknowledged, was indeed
contrary; but, he did not doubt, upon such a particular
occasion, his good lad would not mind such difficul∣ties.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="30" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Bull-Dog.</HEAD>
<P>SIR HUGH called upon his other nieces to join him;
purposing to stroll to the end of a lane which led to
the London road.</P>
<P>Camilla accompanied the party in the most mournful
silence. The assuming letter she had received; the inter∣view
she should have to sustain; and her apparent de∣pendance
upon Sir Sedley, sinking her into complete de∣spondence.</P>
<P>When they came to the high road, Sir Hugh made
a stop, and bid every body look sharp.</P>
<P>A horseman was seen advancing full gallop. By his
figure he appeared to be young; by his pace, in uncom∣mon
speed.</P>
<P>“That's him,” cried Sir Hugh, striking his stick
upon the ground, and smiling most complacently; “I
said he would not mind the wind, my dear Eugenia!
what's the wind, or the waves either, to a lover?
which is a thing, however, that I won't talk about;
so don't be ashamed, my dear girl, nobody knowing
what we mean.”</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="65"/>
Eugenia looked down; deeply colouring, and much
regretting the lameness that prevented her running
back, to avoid so public and discountenancing a meet∣ing.</P>
<P>The horseman now came up to them, and was pre∣paring
to turn down the lane; when all at once, they
perceived him to be Edgar Mandlebert.</P>
<P>He had left Tunbridge in a manner not more abrupt
than comfortless. His disappointment in the failure of
Camilla at the rooms had been as bitter, as his ex∣pectations
from the promised conference had been
animated. When Lionel appeared, he inquired if his
sister were absent from illness—No; she was only writ∣ing
a letter. To take this moment for such a purpose,
be the letter what it might, seemed sporting with his
curiosity and warm interest in her affairs: and he went
back, mortified and dejected, to his lodgings; where,
just arrived by the stage, he found a letter from Dr.
Marchmont, acquainting him with his return to his
rectory. In this suspensive state of mind, to cast him∣self
upon his sagacious friend seemed a relief the most
desirable: but, while considering whether first to claim
from Camilla her promised communication the voice
of Lionel issuing from the room of Major Cerwood,
struck his ears. He darted forth, and accompanied the
youth to his horse, who was setting out upon some ex∣pedition,
in the dark; and then received information,
under the pretence of great secrecy, that Major er∣wood
was going immediately to ask leave of absence,
and proceed straight to Hampshire, with his final pro∣posals
of marriage with Camilla. He now concluded
this was the subject upon which she had meant to con∣sult
with him; but delicacy, pride, and hope all com∣bated
his interference. He determined even to avoid
her, till the answer should be given. “I must owe her
hand,” cried he, “to her heart, not to a contest such
as this: and, if impartially and unbiassed, the Major
is refused, no farther cruel doubt, no torturing hesita∣tion,
shall keep me another minute from her feet!”
With the dawn, therefore, he sat out for Hampshire;
but, fixed to avoid Cleves, till he could learn that the
<PB N="265" REF="66"/>
Major's visit were over, he devoted his mornings to
rides, and his evenings to Dr. Marchmont, till now, a
mile or two from the Park, he had met the Major him∣self,
and concluded the acceptance or the rejection de∣cided.
They merely touched their hats as they passed
each other; and he instantly took the route which the
Major was quitting.</P>
<P>In the excess of his tribulation, he was gallopping
past the whole group, without discerning one of its fi∣gures;
when Sir Hugh called out, “Why it's young
Mr. Edgar! So now we've walked all this way for no∣thing!
and Clermont may be still at Jericho, or at
Rome, for any thing we know to the contray!”</P>
<P>Edgar stopt short. He felt himself shiver at sight of
Camilla, but dismounted, gave his horse to his groom,
and joined the party.</P>
<P>Eugenia recovering, now fearlessly looked up; but
Camilla, struck and affected, shook in every limb, and
was forced to hold by Lavinia.</P>
<P>Edgar called upon his utmost presence of mind to
carry him through what he conceived to be a final trial.
He spoke to Sir Hugh, and compelled himself to speak
separately to every one else: but, when he addressed
Camilla, to whom he said something not very distinct∣ly,
about Tunbridge, she curtsied to him slightly, and
turned away, without making any answer. Her mind,
taking suddenly a quick retrospection of all that had
passed between them, presented him to her view as un∣certain
and delusive; and, casting upon him, internal∣ly,
the whole odium of her present distress, and her
feelings were so indignant, that, in her present desperate
state, she deemed it beneath her to disguise them, either
from himself or the world.</P>
<P>Edgar, to whose troubled imagination every thing
painted his rival, concluded the Major had been heard
with favour; and his own adverse counsel was now re∣collected
with resentment.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, far more fatigued by his disappointment
than by his walk, said he should go no further, as he
found it in vain to expect Clermont; and accepted the
arm of Edgar to aid his stick in helping him home.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="67"/>
Camilla, still leaning upon Lavinia, mounted a little
bank, which she knew Sir Hugh could not ascend, that
she might walk on where Edgar could not join her; in∣voluntarily
ejaculating, “Lavinia! if you would avoid
deceit and treachery, look at a man as at a picture,
which tells you only the present moment! Rely upon
nothing of time to come! They are not like us, Lavinia.
They think themselves free, if they have made no ver∣bal
profession; though they may have pledged them∣selves
by looks, by actions, by attentions, and by man∣ners,
a thousand, and a thousand times!”</P>
<P>Edgar observed her avoidance with the keenest ap∣prehension;
and, connecting it with her failure at the
rooms, imagined the Major had now influenced her to
an utter aversion of him.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh meanwhile, though wholly unheard, re∣lated,
in a low voice, to Edgar, the history of his pre∣parations
for Clermont; begging him, however, to take
no notice of them to Eugenia: and, then, adding,
“Very likely, Mr. Edgar, you are just come from
Tunbridge! and, if so, you may have met with that
young Captain that has been with us this morning;
who, I understand to be a Major?”</P>
<P>Edgar was thrown into the utmost trepidation; the
artless openness of Sir Hugh gave him every reason to
suppose he should immediately gather full intelligence,
and all his peace and all his hopes might hang upon
another word. He could only bow to the question;
but before Sir Hugh could go on, a butcher's boy, who
was riding by, from a wanton love of mischief, gave a
signal to his attending bull-dog, to attack the old spa∣niel
that accompanied Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>Sustained by his master many a year, the proud old
favourite, though unequal to the combat, disdained to
fly; and the fierce bull-dog would presently have demo∣lished
him, had not Edgar, recovering all his vigour
from his earnest desire to rescue an animal so dear to Sir
Hugh, armed himself with the baronet's stick, and
thrust it dexterously across the jaws of his intended an∣tagonist.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="68"/>
Nothing, however, could withstand the fangs of the
bull-dog; they soon severed it, and, again, he made at
the spaniel; but Edgar rushed between them, with no
other weapons than the broken fragments of the stick:
and, while the baronet and Eugenia screamed out to old
Rover to return to them, and Lavinia, with more rea∣diness
of common sense, exerted the fullest powers of
which her gentle voice was capable, to conjure the
wicked boy to call off his dog, Camilla, who was the
last to look round at this scene, only turned about as
the incensed and disappointed bull-dog, missing his ob∣ject,
aimed at Edgar himself. Roused at once from her
sullen calm to the most agonising sensibility, every thing
and every body, herself most of all, were forgotten in
the sight of his danger; and, with a piercing shriek,
she darted down the bank, and arrived at the tremen∣dous
spot, at the same instant that the more useful ex∣hortations
of Lavinia, had induced the boy to withdraw
the fierce animal; who, with all his might, and all his
fury, obeyed the weak whistle of a little urchin he had
been bred to love and respect, for bringing him his daily
food.</P>
<P>Camilla perceived not if the danger were impending,
or over; gasping, pale, and agitated, she caught Man∣dlebert
by the arm, and, in broken accents, half pro∣nounced,
“O Edgar!—are you hurt?”</P>
<P>The revulsion that had operated in her mind took
now its ample turn in that of Mandlebert; he could
hardly trust his senses, hardly believe he existed; yet
he felt the pressure of her hand upon his arm, and saw
in her countenance terror the most undisguised, and ten∣derness
that went straight to his soul. “Is it Camil∣la,”
he cried, “who thus speaks to me?—Is not my
safety or my destruction alike indifferent to Camilla?”</P>
<P>“O no! O no!” cried she, scarce conscious she an∣swered
at all, till called to recollection by his own
changed looks; changed from incredulity and amaze∣ment
to animation that lightened up every feature, to
eyes that shot fire. Abashed, astonished, ashamed, she
precipitately drew away her hand, and sought quietly
to retire.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="69"/>
But Edgar was no longer master of himself; he con∣ceived
he was on a pinnacle, whence he could only,
and without any gradation, turn to happiness or despair.
He followed her, trembling and uncertain, his joy fad∣ing
into alarm at her retreat, his hope transforming into
apprehension at her resumed coldness of demeanor.
“Do you repent,” he cried, “that you have shewn
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> humanity?—will the Major—the happy
Major▪—be offended you do less than detest me?”</P>
<P>“The Major!” repeated she, looking back, sur∣prised,
“can you think the Major has any influence
with me?”</P>
<P>“Ah, Heaven!” he cried, “what do you say!”—</P>
<P>Enchanted, affrighted, bewildered, yet silent, she
hurried on; Edgar could not forget himself more than
a moment; he forbore, therefore, to follow, and, though
with a self-denial next to torture, returned to Sir Hugh,
to whom his arm was doubly necessary, from the scene
he had just witnessed, and the loss of his stick.</P>
<P>The butcher's boy and his bull-doy were decamped;
and the baronet and Eugenia were rivalling each other
in fondling the rescued spaniel, and in pouring thanks
and praises unlimited upon Edgar.</P>
<P>They then walked back as before; and, as soon as
they re-entered the mansion, the female party went up
stairs, and Sir Hugh, warmly shaking Edgar by the
hand, said: “My dear Mr. Edgar, this is one of the
happiest days of my life, except just that of my ne∣phew's
coming over, which it is but right to put before
it. But here, first, my dear Camilla's refused that
young Captain, who would have carried her the Lord
knows where, immediately, as I make no doubt: and
next, I've saved the life of my poor old Rover, by the
means of your good-nature.”</P>
<P>“Refused?” cried Edgar; “my dear Sir Hugh!—
did you say refused?”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh innocently gratified him with the repetition
of the word, but begged him not to mention it, “For
fear,” he said, “it should hurt the young man when
he falls in love somewhere else; which I heartily hope
<PB N="269" REF="70"/>
he will do soon, poor gentleman! for the sake of its
not fretting him.”</P>
<P>“Miss Camilla, then, has refused him?” again re∣peated
Edgar, with a countenance that, to any man
but the baronet, must have betrayed his whole soul.</P>
<P>“Yes, poor gentleman! this very morning; for
which I am thankful enough: for what do we know of
those young officers, who may all be sent to the East
Indies, or Jamaica, every day of their lives? Not but
what I have the proper pity for him, which, I hope, is
all that can be expected.”</P>
<P>Edgar walked about the room, in a perturbation of
hope, fear, and joy, that disabled him from all further
appearance of attention. He wished to relate this trans∣action
to Dr. Marchmont, yet dreaded any retarding
advice; he languished to make Camilla herself the sole
mistress of his destiny: the interest she had shewn for
his safety seemed to admit but one interpretation; and,
finally, he resolved to stay at Cleves till he could meet
with her alone.</P>
<P>Camilla had not uttered a word after the adventure of
the bull-dog. The smallest idea that she could excite
the least emotion in Edgar, brought a secret rapture to
her heart, that, at any former period, would alone have
sufficed to render her happy: but, at this instant of en∣tanglement
with another, she revolted from the indul∣gence
of such pleasure; and instead of dwelling, as she
would have done before, on the look, the accent, the
manner, that were susceptible, by any construction, of
partiality, she checked every idea that did not represent
Edgar as unstable and inconsistent; and sought, with
all her power, to regard him as Mrs. Arlbery had paint∣ed
him, and to believe him, except in a few casual mo∣ments
of caprice, insensible and hard of heart.</P>
<P>Yet this entanglement, in which, scarce knowing
how, she now seemed to be entwined with Sir Sedley,
grew more and more terrific; and when she considered
that her sisters themselves thought her independence
gone, and her honour engaged, she was seized with so
much wonderment, how it had all been brought about,
<PB N="270" REF="71"/>
that her understanding seemed to play her false, and
she believed the whole a dream.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Oak Tree.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the sisters were summoned down stairs to
dinner, planted at the door, ready to receive them at
their entrance, stood Edgar. Lavinia and Eugenia ad∣dressed
him as usual; but Camilla could not speak, could
not return his salutation, could not look at him. She
sat hastily down in her accustomed place by her uncle,
and even the presence of her father scarcely restrained
her tears, as she contrasted the hopeless uncertainties of
Edgar, with the perilous pursuit of Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>Edgar, for the first time, saw her avoidance without
suspecting that it flowed from repugnance. The interest
she had shewn for his safety was still bounding in his
breast, and as, from time to time, he stole a glance at
her, and observed her emotion, his heart whispered
him the softest hopes, that soon the most perfect confi∣dence
would make every feeling reciprocal.</P>
<P>But these hopes were not long without alloy; he
soon discerned something that far exceeded what could
give him pleasure in her perturbation; he read in it not
merely hurry and alarm, but suffering and distress.</P>
<P>He now ventured to look at her no more; his con∣fidence
gave place to pity; he saw she was unhappy,
and breathed no present wish but to relieve and console
her.</P>
<P>When the dessert was served, she was preparing to
retire; but she caught the eye of her father, and saw
<PB N="271" REF="72"/>
she should not long be alone; she re-seated herself, there∣fore,
in haste, to postpone, at least, his scrutiny.</P>
<P>Every body, at length, arose, and Sir Hugh pro∣posed
that they should all walk in the park, during his
nap, but keep close to the pales, that they might listen
for all passengers, in case of Clermont's coming.</P>
<P>To this, also, Camilla could make no objection, and
they set out. She took an arm of each sister, and in∣dulged
the heaviness of her heart in not uttering a
word.</P>
<P>They had not gone far when a servant ran after Mr.
Tyrold with a pacquet, just arrived, by a private hand,
from Lisbon. He returned to read it in his own room;
Lavinia and Eugenia accompanied him to hear its con∣tents,
and Camilla, for the first time, seemed the least
affectionate of his daughters; she durst not encounter
him but in the mixt company of all the house; she told
Lavinia to make haste back with the news, and took
the arm of Indiana.</P>
<P>The compulsion of uninteresting discourse soon be∣came
intolerable; and no longer chained to the party
by the awe of her father, she presently left Indiana to
Miss Margland, and perceiving that Edgar was conver∣sing
with Dr. Orkborne, said the would wait for her
sisters; and, turning a little aside, sat down upon a
bench under a large oak.</P>
<P>Here her painful struggle and unwilling forbearance
ended; she gave free vent to her tears, and thought
herself the most wretched of human beings; she found
her heart, her aching heart, more than ever devoted to
Mandlebert, filled with his image, revering his virtues,
honouring even his coldness, from a persuasion she de∣served
not his affection, and sighing solely▪ for the pri∣vilege
to consign herself to his remembrance for life,
though unknown to himself, and unsuspected by the
world. The very idea of Sir Sedley was horror to
her; she felt guilty to have involved herself in an in∣tercourse
so fertile of danger; she thought over, with
severest repentance, her short, but unjustisiable deviati∣on
from that transparent openness, and undesigning
plainness of conduct, which her disposition as much
<PB N="272" REF="73"/>
as her education ought to have rendered unchangeable.
To that, alone, was owing all her actual difficulty, for
to that alone was owing her own opinion of any claim
upon her justice. How dearly, she cried, do I now pay
for the unthinking plan with which I risked the peace
of another, for the re-establishment of my own! She
languished to throw herself into the arms of her father,
to unbosom to him all her errors and distresses, and owe
their extrication to his wisdom and kindness. She was
sure he would be unmoved by the glare of a brilliant
establishment, and that far from desiring her to sacri∣fice
her feelings to wealth and shew, he would himself
plead against the alliance when he knew the state of
her mind and recommend to her, so circumstanced,
the single life, in the true spirit of christian philosophy
and moderation: but all was so closely interwoven in
the affairs and ill conduct of her brother, that she be∣lieved
herself engaged in honour to guard the fatal se∣cret,
though hazarding by its concealment impropriety
and misery.</P>
<P>These afflicting ruminations were at length interrupt∣ed
by the sound of feet; she took her handkerchief
from her eyes, expecting to see her sisters; she was
mistaken, and beheld Mandlebert.</P>
<P>She started and rose: she strove to chace the tears
from her eyes without wiping them, and asked what
he had done with Dr. Orkborne?</P>
<P>“You are in grief!” cried he in a tone of sympa∣thy;
“some evil has befallen you!—let me ask—”</P>
<P>“No; I am only waiting for my sisters. They
have just received letters from Lisbon.”</P>
<P>“You have been weeping! you are weeping now!
why do you turn away from me? I will not obtrusively
demand your confidence—yet, could I give you the
most distant idea what a weight it might remove from
my mind,—you would find it difficult to deny yourself
the pleasure of doing so much good!”</P>
<P>The tears of Camilla now streamed afresh. Words
so kind from Edgar, the cold, the hard-hearted Ed∣gar,
surprised and overset her; yet she endeavoured to
hide her face, and made an effort to pass him.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="74"/>
“Is not this a little unkind?” cried he, gravely;
“however, I have no claim to oppose you.”</P>
<P>“Unkind” she repeated, and involuntarily turning
to him, shewed a countenance so disconsolate, that he
lost his self-control, and taking her reluctant hand,
said: “O Camilla! torture me no longer!”</P>
<P>Almost transfixed with astonishment, she looked at
him for a moment in a speechless wonder; but the in∣terval
of doubt was short; the character of Edgar, for
unalienable steadiness, unalterable honour, was fixed
in her mind, like “truths from holy writ,” and she
knew, with certainty incontrovertible, that his fate was
at her disposal, from the instant he acknowledged
openly her power over his feelings.</P>
<P>Every opposite sensation, that with violence the most
ungovernable could encounter but to combat, now met
in her bosom, elevating her to rapture, harrowing her
with terror, menacing even her understanding. The
most exquisite wish of her heart seemed accorded at a
period so nearly too late for its acceptance, that her
faculties, bewildered, confused, deranged, lost the capa∣city
of clearly conceiving if still she were a free agent
or not.</P>
<P>He saw her excess of disorder with alarm; he sought
to draw her again to her seat; but she put her hand
upon her forehead, and leant it against the bark of
the tree.</P>
<P>“You will not speak to me!” cried he; you will
not trust me! shall I call you cruel? No! for you are
not aware of the pain you inflict, the anguish you make
me suffer! the generosity of your Nature would else,
unbidden, impulsively interfere.”</P>
<P>“<HI>You</HI> suffer! <HI>you!</HI>” cried she, again distressfully,
almost incredulously, looking at him, while her hands
were uplifted with amazement: “I thought you above
any suffering! superior to all calamity!—almost to all
feeling!—”</P>
<P>“Ah, Camilla! what thus estranges you from can∣dor?
from justice? what is it can prompt you to goad
thus a heart which almost from its first beating—”</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="75"/>
He stopt, desirous to check himself; while pene∣trated
by his softness, and ashamed of what, in the
bitterness of her spirit, she had pronounced, she again
melted into tears, and sunk down upon the bench; yet
holding out to him one hand, while with the other she
covered her face: “Forgive me,” she cried, “I en∣treat—for
I scarce know what I say.”</P>
<P>Such a speech, and so accompanied, might have de∣molished
the stoicism of an older philosopher than Ed∣gar;
he fervently kissed her proferred hand, exclaim∣ing:
“Forgive you! can Camilla use such a word?
has she the slightest care for my opinion? the most re∣mote
concern for me, or for my happiness?”</P>
<P>“Farewell! farewell!” cried she, hastily drawing
away her hand, “go now, I beseech you!”</P>
<P>“What a moment to expect me to depart! O Ca∣milla!
my soul sickens of this suspence! End it gene∣rous
Camilla! beloved as lovely! my heart is all your
own! use it gently, and accept it nobly!”</P>
<P>Every other emotion, now, in the vanquished Ca∣milla,
every retrospective fear, every actual regret,
yielded to the conquering charm of grateful tenderness;
and restoring the hand she had withdrawn: “O Ed∣gar,”
she cried, “how little can I merit such a gift!
yet I prize it—far, far, beyond all worlds!”</P>
<P>The agitation of Edgar was, at first, too mighty
and too delicious for speech; but his eyes, now cast
up to heaven, now fixed upon her own, spoke the most
ardent, yet purest felicity; while her hand, now held
to his heart, now pressed to his lips, strove vainly to
recover its liberty. “Blest moment” he at length
uttered, “that finishes for ever such misery of uncer∣tainty!
that gives my life to happiness—my existence
to Camilla!”</P>
<P>Again speech seemed too poor for him. Perfect sa∣tisfaction
is seldom loquacious; its character is rather
tender than gay; and where happiness succeeds abrupt∣ly
to long solicitude and sorrow, its enjoyment is fear∣ful;
it softens rather than exhilarates. Sudden joy is
sportive, but sudden happiness is awful.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="76"/>
The pause, however, that on his side was ecstatic
thankfulness, soon became mixt, on that of Camilla,
with confusion and remorse: Sir Sedley returned to
her memory, and with him every reflection, and every
apprehension, that most cruelly could fully each trem∣bling,
though nearly gratified hope.</P>
<P>The cloud that so soon dimmed the transient radi∣ance
of her countenance, was instantly perceived by
Edgar; but as he was beginning the most anxious in∣quiries,
the two sisters approached, and Camilla, whose
hand he then relinquished, rushed forward, and throw∣ing
her arms around their necks, wept upon their bo∣soms.</P>
<P>“Sweet sisters!” cried Edgar, embracing them all
three in one; “long may ye thus endearingly entwine
each other, in the sacred links of affectionate affinity!
Where shall I find our common father?—where is Mr.
Tyrold?”</P>
<P>The amazed sisters could with difficulty answer that
he was with their uncle, to whom he was communica∣ting
news from their mother.</P>
<P>Edgar looked tenderly at Camilla, but, perceiving
her emotion, forbore to speak to her, though he could
not deny himself the pleasure of snatching one kiss of
the hand which hung down upon the shoulder of Eu∣genia;
he then whispered to both the sisters: “You
will not, I trust, be my enemies?' and hurried to the
house.</P>
<P>“What can this mean?” cried Eugenia and Lavi∣nia
in a breath.</P>
<P>“It means, said Camilla, “that I am the most dis∣tressed
—yet the happiest of human beings!”</P>
<P>This little speech, began with the deepest sigh, but
finished with the most refulgent smile, only added to
their wonder.</P>
<P>“I hope you have been consulting with Edgar,”
said the innocent Eugenia; “nobody can more ably
advise you, since, in geuerosity to Lionel, you are
prohibited from counselling with my father.”</P>
<P>Again the most expressive smiles played in every fea∣ture
through the tears of Camilla, as she turned, with
<PB N="276" REF="77"/>
involuntary archness, to Eugenia, and answered:
“And shall I follow his counsel, my dear sister, if he
gives me any?”</P>
<P>“Why not? he is wise, prudent, and much at∣tached
to us all. How he can have supposed it possible
we could be his enemies, is past all divination!”</P>
<P>Gaiety was so truly the native growth of the mind
of Camilla, that neither care nor affliction could chace
it long from its home. The speeches of the unsuspi∣cious
Eugenia, that a moment before would have past
unheeded, now regaled her renovated fancy with a thou∣sand
amusing images, which so vigorously struggled
against her sadness and her terrors, that they were soon
nearly driven from the field by their sportive assailants;
and, by the time she reached her chamber, whither,
lost in amaze, her sisters followed her, the surprise she
had in store for them, the pleasure with which she knew
they would sympathise in her happiness, and the security
of Edgar's decided regard, had liberated her mind
from the shackles of reminiscence, and restored her vi∣vacity
to its original spirit.</P>
<P>Fastening, then, her door, she turned to them with
a countenance of the brightest animation; alternately
and almost wildly embraced them, and related the ex∣plicit
declaration of Edgar; now hiding in their bosoms
the blushes of her modest joy, now offering up to
Heaven the thanksgiving of her artless rapture, now dis∣solving
in the soft tears of the tenderest sensibility, ac∣cording
to the quick changing impulses of her natural
and lively, yet feeling and susceptible character. Nor
once did she look at the reverse of this darling portrait
of chosen felicity, till Eugenia, with a gentle sigh, ut∣tered:
“Unhappy Sir Sedley Clarendel! how may
this stroke be softened to him?”</P>
<P>“Ah Eugenia!” she cried; “that alone is my im∣pediment
to the most perfect, the most unmixt content!
why have you made me think of him?”</P>
<P>“My dear Camilla,” said Eugenia, with a look of
curious earnestness, and taking both her hands, while
she seemed examining her face, “you are then, it seems,
in love? and with Edgar Mandlebert?”</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="78"/>
Camilla, blushing, yet laughing, broke away from her,
denying the charge</P>
<P>A consultation succeeded upon the method of pro∣ceeding
with the young Baronet. Tommy Hodd was
not yet returned with the answer; it was five miles to
Clarendel Place, which made going and returning his
day's work. She resolved to wait but this one reply,
and then to acknowledge to Edgar the whole of her
situation. The delicacy of Lavinia, and the high ho∣nour
of Eugenia, concurred in the propriety of this con∣fession;
and they all saw the urgent necessity of an imme∣diate
explanation with Sir Sedley, whose disappointment
might every hour receive added weight from delay.
Painful, therefore, confusing and distasteful, as was the
task, Camilla determined upon the avowal, and as com∣pletely
to be guided by Edgar in this difficult conjunc∣ture,
as if his advice were already sanctioned by conju∣gal
authority.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="32" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Call of the House.</HEAD>
<P>EDGAR returned to the parlour with a countenance
so much brightened, a joy so open, a confidence so
manly, and an air so strongly announcing some interest∣ing
intelligence, that his history required no prelude.
“Edgar,” said Mr Tyrold, “you have a look to dis∣arm
care of its corrosion. You could not take a better
time to wear so cheering an aspect; I have just learnt
that my wife can fix no sort of date for her return; I
must borrow, therefore, some reflected happiness; and
none, after my children, can bring its sunshine so home
to my bosom as yourself.”</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="79"/>
“What a fortunate moment have you chosen,” cried
Edgar, affectionately taking him by the hand, to express
this generous pleasure in seeing me happy! will you
repent, will you retract, when you hear in what it may
involve you?—Dearest sir! my honoured, my parental
friend! to what a test shall I put your kindness!—Will
you give me in charge one of the dearest ties of
your existence? will you repose in my care so large a
portion of your peace? will you trust to me your Ca∣milla?”—</P>
<P>With all the ardour of her character, all the keen and
quick feelings of her sensitive mind, scarce had Camilla
herself been more struck, more penetrated with sudden
joy, sudden wonder, sudden gratification of every kind,
than Mr. Tyrold felt at this moment. He more than
returned the pressure with which Edgar held his hand,
and instantly answered, “Yes, my excellent young
friend, without hesitation, without a shadow of appre∣hension
for her happiness! though she is all the fondest
father can wish;—and though she only who gave her
to me is dearer!”</P>
<P>Felicity and tenderness were now the sole guests in
the breast of Edgar. He kissed with reverence the hand
of Mr. Tyrold, called him by the honoured and endear∣ing
title of father; acknowledged that, from the earli∣est
period of observation, Camilla had seemed to him
the most amiable of human creatures; spoke with the
warm devotion he sincerely felt for her of Mrs. Tyrold;
and was breatning sorth his very soul in tender rapture
upon his happy prospects, when something between a
sigh and a groan from the baronet, made him hastily
turn round, apologise for not sooner addressing him, and
respectfully solicit his cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was in an agitation of delight and surprise
almost too potent for his strength. “The Lord be
good unto me,” he cried; “have I lived to see such
a day as this!” Then, throwing his arms about Ed∣gar's
neck, while his eyes were fast filling with tears,
which soon ran plentifully down his cheeks, “Good
young Mr. Edgar!” he cried; “good- young man!
and do you really love my poor Camilla, for all her not
<PB N="279" REF="80"/>
being worth a penny? And will my dear little darling
come to so good an end at last, after being disinherited
for doing nothing? And will you never vex her, nor
speak an unkind word to her? Indeed, young Mr. Ed∣gar,
you are a noble boy! you are indeed; and I love
you to the bottom of my old heart for this true good
naturedness!”</P>
<P>Then, again and again embracing him, “This is all
of a piece,” he continued, “with your saving my
poor old Rover, which is a thing I shall never forget to
my longest day, being a remarkable sign of a good heart;
the poor dog having done nothing to offend, as we can
all testify. So that it's a surprising thing what that
mastiff owed him such a grudge for.”</P>
<P>Then quitting him abruptly to embrace Mr. Tyrold,
“My dear brother,” he cried, “I hope your judg∣ment
approves this thing, as well as my sister's, when
she comes to hear it, which I shall send off express, be∣fore
I sleep another wink, for fear of accidents.”</P>
<P>“Approved,” answered Mr. Tyrold, with a look
of the most expressive kindness at Edgar, “is too cold
a word; I rejoice, even thankfully rejoice, to place my
dear child in such worthy and beloved hands.”</P>
<P>“Well, then,” cried the enchanted baronet, “if
that's the case, that we are all of one mind, we had
better settle the business at once, all of us being subject
to die by delay.”</P>
<P>He then rang the bell, and ordered Jacob to summon
Camilla to the parlour, adding, “And all the rest too,
Jacob, for I have something to tell them every one,
which, I make no doubt, they will be very glad to
hear, yourself included, as well as your fellow-servants,
who have no right to be left out; only let my niece
come first, being her own affair.”</P>
<P>Camilla obeyed not the call without many secret sen∣sations
of distress and difficulty, but which, mingled
with the more obvious ones of modesty and embarrass∣ment,
all passed for a flutter of spirits that appeared na∣tural
to the occasion.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold could only silently embrace her: know∣ing
what she had suffered, and judging thence the excess
<PB N="280" REF="81"/>
of her present satisfaction, he would not add to her con∣fusion
by any information of his consciousness; but the
softness with which he held her to his bosom spoke,
beyond all words, his heartfelt sympathy in her happi∣ness.</P>
<P>Camilla had no power to draw herself from his arms;
but Edgar hovered round her, and Sir Hugh repeatedly
and impatiently demanded to have his turn. Mr. Ty∣rold,
gently disengaging himself from her embraces,
gave one of her hands to Edgar, who, with grateful
joy, pressed it to his lips. “My children!” he then
said, laying a hand upon the shoulder of each, “what
a sight is this to me! how precious a union! what will
it be to your excellent mother! So long and so deci∣dedly
it has been our favourite earthly wish, that, were
she but restored to me—to her country and to her fa∣mily—I
might, perhaps, require some new evil to pre∣vent
my forgetting where—and what I am!”</P>
<P>“My dear brother, I say! my dear niece! My
dear Mr. young Edgar!” cried Sir Hugh, in the high∣est
good humour, though with nearly exhausted pati∣ence,
“won't you let me put in a word? nor so much
as give you my blessing? though I can hardly hold life
and soul together for the sake of my joy!”</P>
<P>Camilla cast herself into his arms, he kissed her most
fondly, saying: “Don't forget your poor old uncle,
my dear little girl, for the account of this young Mr.
Edgar, because, good as he is, he has taken to you but
a short time in comparison with me.”</P>
<P>“No,” said Edgar, still tenaciously retaining the
hand parentally bestowed upon him; “no, dear Sir
Hugh, I wish not to rob you of your darling. I wish
but to be admitted myself into this dear and respected
family, and to have Etherington, Cleves, and Beech
Park, considered as our alternate and common habita∣tions.”</P>
<P>“You are the very best young man in the whole wide
world!” cried Sir Hugh, almost sobbing with ecstasy;
“for you have hit upon just the very thing I was think∣ing
of in my own private mind! What a mercy it is
our not accepting that young Captain, who would have
<PB N="281" REF="82"/>
run away with her to I don't know where, instead of
being married to the very nearest estate in the county,
that will always be living with us!”</P>
<P>The rest of the family now, obedient to the directi∣on
of Jacob, who had intimated that something extra∣ordinary
was going forward, entered the room.</P>
<P>“Come in, come in,” cried Sir Hugh, “and hear
the good news; for we have just been upon the very
point of losing the best opportunity that ever we had in
our lives of all living together: which, I hope, we shall
now do, without any more strangers coming upon us
with their company, being a thing we don't desire.”</P>
<P>“But what's the good news, uncle?” said Indiana;
“is it only about our living together?”</P>
<P>“Why, yes, my dear, that's the first principal,
and the other is, that young Mr. Edgar's going to marry
Camilla; which I hope you won't take ill, liking being
all fancy.”</P>
<P>“Me?” cried she, with a disdainful toss of the head,
though severely mortified; “it's nothing to me, I'm
sure!”</P>
<P>Camilla ashamed, and Edgar embarrassed, strove now
mutually to shew Sir Hugh they wished no more might
be said: but he only embraced them again, and declar∣ed
he had never been so full of joy before in his whole
life, and would not be cut short.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, extremely piqued, vently her spleen
in oblique sarcasms, and sought to heal her offended
pride by appeals for justice to her sagacity and foresight
in the whole business.</P>
<P>Jacob, now, opening the door, said all the servants
were come.</P>
<P>Camilla tried to escape; but Sir Hugh would not per∣mit
her, and the house-heeper and butler led the way,
followed by every other domestic of the house.</P>
<P>“Well, my friends,” he cried, wish her joy, which
I am sure you will do of your own accord, for she's
going to be mistress of Beech-Park; which I thought
would have been the case with my other niece, till I
found out my mistake; which is of no consequence
<PB N="282" REF="83"/>
now, all having ended for the best; though unknown
to us poor mortals.”</P>
<P>The servants obeyed with alacrity, and offered their
hearty congratulations to the blushing Camilla and hap∣py
Edgar, Molly Mill excepted; who, having conclud∣ed
Sir Sedley Clarendel the man, doubted her own sen∣ses,
and, instead of open felicitations, whispered Ca∣milla,
“Dear Miss, I've got another letter for you!
It's here in my bosom.”</P>
<P>Camilla, frightened, said: “Hush! hush!” while
Edgar, imagining the girl, whose simplicity and talka∣tiveness
were familiar to him, had said something ridi∣culous,
intreated to be indulged with hearing her re∣mark:
but seeing Camilla look grave, forbore to press
his request.</P>
<P>The baronet now began an harangue upon the happi∣ness
that would accrue from these double unions, for
which he assured them they should have double remem∣brances,
though the same preparations would do for
both, as he meant they should take place at the same
time, provided Mr. Edgar would have the obligingness
to wait for a fair wind, which he was expecting every
hour.</P>
<P>Camilla could now stay no longer: nor could Edgar,
though adoring the hearty joy of Sir Hugh, refuse to
aid her in absconding.</P>
<P>He begged her permission to follow, as soon as it
might be possible, which she tacitly accorded. She was
impatient herself for the important conference she was
planning, and felt, with increasing solicitude, that all
her life's happiness hung upon her power to extricate
herself honourably from the terrible embarrassment in
which she was involved.</P>
<P>She sauntered about the hall till the servants came
out, anxious to receive the letter which Molly Mill had
announced. They all sought to surround her with fresh
good wishes; but she singled out Molly, and begged the
rest to leave her for the present. The letter, however,
was not unpinned from the inside of Molly's neck
handkerchief, before Edgar, eager and gay, joined
her.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="84"/>
Trembling then, she intreated her to make haste.</P>
<P>“La, Miss,” answered the girl, “if you hurry me
so, I shall tear it as sure as can be; and what will you
say then, Miss?”</P>
<P>“Well—then—another time will do—take it to
my room.”</P>
<P>“No, no, Miss; the gentleman told Tommy Hodd
he wanted an answer as quick as can be; he said, if
Tommy'd come a-horseback, he'd pay for the horse, to
make him quicker; and Tommy says he always behaves
very handsome.”</P>
<P>She then gave her the squeezed billet. Camilla, in
great confusion, put it into her pocket. Edgar, who
even unavoidably heard what passed, held back till Molly
retired; and then, with an air of undisguised surprise
and curiosity, though in a laughing tone, said, “Must
not the letter be read till I make my bow?”</P>
<P>“O yes,”—cried she, stammering, “it may be
read—at any time.” And she put her hand in her
pocket to re-produce it. But the idea of making known
the strange aad unexpected history she had to relate, by
shewing so strange a correspondence, without one lead∣ing
and softening previous circumstance, required a force
and confidence of which she was not mistress. She
twisted it, therefore, hastily round, to hide the hand∣writing
of the direction, and, then, with the same care,
rolled it up, and encircled it with her fingers.</P>
<P>“Shall I be jealous?” said he, gently, though disap∣pointed.</P>
<P>“You have much reason!” she answered, with a
smile so soft, it dispersed every fear, yet with an atten∣tion
so careful to conceal the address, that it kept alive
every wonder. He took her other hand, and, kissing
it cried: “No, sweetest Camilla, such unworthy dis∣trust
shall make no part of our compact. Yet I own
myself a little interested to know what gentleman has
obtained a privilege I should myself prize above almost
any other. I will leave you, however, to read the
letter, and, perhaps, before you answer it—but no—
I will ask nothing; I shall lose all pleasure in your con∣fidence,
<PB N="284" REF="85"/>
if it is not spontaneous. I will go and find
your sisters.”</P>
<P>The first impulse of Camilla was, to commit to him
immediately the unopened letter: but the fear of its
contents, its stile, its requisitions, made her terror over∣power
her generosity; and, though she looked after him
with regret, she stood still to break the seal of her letter.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>Is it thus, O far too fair tormenter! thou delightest
to torture? Dost thou give wings but to clip them?
raise expectation but to bid it linger? fan bright the

Another delay!—Ah! tell me how I may exist till
it terminates! Name to me, O fair tyrant! some pe∣riod,

see you. To-morrow, then▪—you will not, I trust,
kill me again to-morrow? With the sun, the renovat∣ing

</LETTER>
<P>The immediate presence of Edgar himself could not
have made this letter die the cheeks of Camilla of a
deeper red. She saw that Sir Sedley thought her only
coquetishly trifling, and she looked forward with nearly
equal horror to clearing up a mistake that might
embitter his future life, and to acknowledging to
Edgar—the scrupulous, the scrutinising, the de∣licate
Edgar—that such a mistake could have been
formed.</P>
<P>She was ruminating upon this formidable, this ter∣rible
task, when Edgar again appeared, accompanied
by her sisters. She hurried the letter into her pocket.
Edgar saw the action with a concern that dampt his
<PB N="285" REF="86"/>
spirits: he wished to obtain from her immediately the
unlimited trust, which immediately, and for ever, he
meant to repose in her They all strolled together for
a short time in the park; but she was anxious to retreat
to her room, and her sisters were dying with impatience
to read Sir Sedley's letter Edgar, disturbed to see
how little any of their countenances accorded with the
happy feelings he had so recently experienced, proposed
not to lengthen the walk, but flattered himself, upon
re-entering the house, Camilla would afford him a few
minutes of explanation. But she only, with a faint
smile, said she should soon return to the parlour; and
he saw Molly Mill eagerly waiting for her upon the
stairs, and heard her, in reply to some question con∣cerning
Tommy Hodd, desire the girl to be quiet till she
got to her room.</P>
<P>Edgar could form no idea of what all this meant,
yet, that some secret disturbance preyed upon Camilla,
that some gentleman wrote to her, and expected im∣patiently
an answer; and that the correspondence pas∣sed
neither through her friends, nor by the post, but by
the medium of Molly Mill, were circumstances not less
unaccountable than unpleasant.</P>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, produced the letter to her
sisters, beseeching their ablest counsel. “See but,”
she cried, “how dreadfully unprepared is Sir Sedley
for the event of the day! And oh!—how yet more
unprepared must be Edgar for seeing that such a letter
could ever be addressed to me! How shall I shew it
him, my dear sisters? how help his believing I must
have given every possible encouragement, ere Sir Sed∣ley
could have written to me in so assured a style.</P>
<P>Much deliberation ensued; but they were all so per∣plexed,
that they were summoned to tea before they had
come to any resolution.</P>
<P>The counsel of Eugenia, then, prevailed; and it
was settled, that Camilla should avoid, for the present,
any communication to Edgar, lest it should lead to mis∣chief
between him and the young Barotet, who could
not but be mutually displeased with each other; and
<PB N="286" REF="87"/>
that the next morning, before she saw Edgar again, she
should set out for the Grove, and there cast herself
wholly upon the generosity of Sir Sedley; and, when
freed from all engagement, return, and relate, without
reserve, the whole history to Edgar; who would so
soon be brother of her brother, that he would pardon
the faults of Lionel, and who would then be in no
danger himself from personal contest or discussion with
Sir Sedley. She wrote, therefore, one line, to say she
would see Mrs. Arlbery early the next day, and de∣livered
it to Molly Mill; who promised to borrow a
horse of the under-groom, that Tommy Hodd might
be back before bed-time, without any obligation to Sir
Sedley.</P>
<P>She, then, went down stairs; when Edgar disap∣pointed
by her long absence, sought vainly to recom∣pense
it by conversing with her. She was gentle, but
seated herself aloof, and avoided his eyes.</P>
<P>His desire to unravel so much mystery he thought now
so legitimated by his peculiar situation, that he was fre∣quently
upon the point of soliciting for information:
but, to know himself privileged, upon further reflection,
was sufficient to insure his forbearance. Even when
that knot was tied which would give to him all power,
he sincerely meant to owe all her trust to willing commu∣nication.
Should he now, then, make her deem him
exacting, and tenacious of prerogative? no; it might
shackle the freedom of her mind in their future inter∣course.
He would quietly, therefore, wait her own
time, and submit to her own inclination. She could not
doubt his impatience; he would not compel her gene∣rosity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Triumph of Pride.</HEAD>
<P>THE three sisters were retired, at night, to ano∣ther
council in the room of Camilla, when Molly Mill,
with a look of dismay, burst in upon them, bringing,
with the answer of Sir Sedley, news that Tommy
Hodd, by an accident he could not help, had rode the
horse she had borowed for him of the under-groom to
death.</P>
<P>The dismay, now, spread equally to them all.
What a tale would this misfortune unfold to Sir Hugh,
to Edgar, to the whole house! the debt of Lionel,
the correspondence with Sir Sedley, the expectations
of the young Baronet—Camilla could not support it,
she sent for Jacob to own to him the affair, and beg his
assistance.</P>
<P>Jacob, though getting into bed, obeyed the call.
He was, however, so much irritated at the loss of the
horse, and the boldness of the under-groom, in lending
him without leave, that, at first, he would listen to no
intreaties, and protested that both the boy and Molly
Mill should be complained of to his master. The elo∣quence,
however, of his three young mistresses, for so
all the nieces of Sir Hugh were called by the ser∣vants
at Cleves, soon softened his ire; he almost
adored his master, and was affectionately attached to
the young family. They begged him, therefore, to
buy another horse as like it as possible, and to con∣trive
not to employ it when Sir Hugh was in sight,
till they were able to clear up the history to their uncle
themselves: this would not be difficult, as the Baronet
rarely visited his stables, since his fall, from the me∣lancholy
<PB N="288" REF="89"/>
with which he was filled by the sight of his
horses.</P>
<P>There was to be a fair of cattle in the neighbourhood
the next day, and Jacob promised to ride over to see
what bargain he could make for them.</P>
<P>They then inquired about what money would be ne∣cessary
for the purchase.</P>
<P>The cost▪ he said, of poor Tom Jones was 40l.</P>
<P>Camilla held up her hands, almost screaming. Eu∣genia,
with more presence of mind, said they would
see him again in the morning before he went, and
then told Molly Mill to wait for her in her own
room.</P>
<P>“What can I now do?” cried Camilla; “I would
not add the history of this dreadful expence to the sad
tale I have already to relate to Edgar for the universe!
To begin my career by such a string of humiliations
would be insupportable. Already I owe five guineas to
Mrs. Arlbery, which the tumult of my mind since my
return has prevented me from naming to my uncle; and
I have left debts at Tunbridge that will probably take up
all my next quarter's allowance!”</P>
<P>“As far as these three guineas will go,” said Lavi∣nia,
taking out her purse, “here, my dearest Camilla,
they are;—but how little that is? I never before
thought my pittance too small! yet how well we all
know my dear father cannot augment it.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, who, in haste, had stept to her own room,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow came back and putting twenty guineas into the
hand of Camilla, said: “This, my beloved sister, is
all I now have by me; but Jacob is rich and good, and
will rejoice to pay the rest for us at present; and I shall
very soon reimburse him, for my uncle has insisted upon
making me a very considerable present, which I shall
now, no longer refuse.”</P>
<P>Camilla burst into tears, and, hanging about their
necks: “O my sisters,” she cried, “what goodness
is yours! but how can I avail myself of it with any justice?
Your three guineas, my Lavinia, your little all—how can
I bear to take?”</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="90"/>
“Do not teach me to repine, my dear Camilla, that
I have no more! I am sure of being remembered by
my uncle on the approaching occasions, and I can never,
therefore, better spare my little store.”</P>
<P>“You are all kindness! and you, my dear Eugenia,
though you have more, have claims upon that more, and
are both expected and used to answer them—”</P>
<P>“Yes, I have indeed more!” interrupted Eugenia,
“which only sisters good as mine could pardon; but
because my uncle has made me his heiress, has he made
me a brute? No! whatever I have, must be amongst
us all in common, not only now, but—” She stopt,
affrighted at the idea she was presenting to herself, and
servently clasping her hands, exclaimed: “O long—
long may it be ere I can shew my sisters all I feel for
them! they will believe it, I am sure—and that is far
happier!”</P>
<P>The idea this raised struck them all, at the same
moment, to the heart. Not one of them had dry eyes,
and with a sadness overpowering every other consider∣ation,
they sighed as heavily, and with looks as dis∣consolate,
as if the uncle so dear to them were already
no more.</P>
<P>The influence of parts, the predominance of know∣ledge,
the honour of learning, the captivation of ta∣lents,
and even the charm of fame itself, all shrink in
their effects before the superior force of goodness, even
where most simple and uncultivated, for power over
the social affections.</P>
<P>At an early hour, the next morning, the commis∣sion,
with the twenty guineas in hand, and the promise
of the rest in a short time, were given to Jacob; and
Camilla, then, begged permission of her father, and the
carriage of her uncle, to visit Mrs. Arlbery, who, she
had heard, was just returned to the Grove.</P>
<P>Concluding she wished to be the messenger of her
own affairs to that lady, they made no opposition, and
she set off before eight o'clock, without entering the
<PB N="290" REF="91"/>
parlour, where Edgar, she was informed, was already
arrived for breakfast.</P>
<P>The little journey was terrible to her; scenes of dis∣appointment
and despair on the part of Sir Sedley, were
anticipated by her alarmed imagination, and she re∣proached
herself for every word she had ever spoken,
every look she had ever given, that could have raised
any presumption of her regard.</P>
<P>The last note was written in the style of all the
others, and not one ever expressed the smallest doubt of
success; how dreadful then to break to him such news,
at the very moment he might imagine she came to meet
him with partial pleasure!</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was not yet risen. Camilla inquired,
stammering, if any company were at the house. None,
was the answer. She then begged leave to walk in the
garden till Mrs. Arlbery came down stairs.</P>
<P>She was not sorry to miss her; she dreaded her yet
more than Sir Sedley himself, and hoped to see him
a one.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, she remained a full hour in waiting,
ruminating upon the wonder her disappearance would
give to Edgar, and nearly persuaded some chance had
anticipated her account to Sir Sedley, whose rage and
grief were too violent to suffer him to keep his appoint∣ment.</P>
<P>This idea served but to add to her perturbation,
when, at last, she saw him enter the garden.</P>
<P>All presence of mind then forsook her; she looked
around to see if she could escape, but his approach was
too quick for avoidance. Her eyes, unable to encoun∣ter
his, were bent upon the ground, and she stood still,
and even trembling, till he reached her.</P>
<P>To the prepossessed notions and vain character of Sir
Sedley, these were symptoms by no means discouraging;
with a confidence almost amounting to arrogance he
advanced, pitying her distress, yet pitying himself still
more for the snare in which it was involving him. He
permitted his eyes for a moment to fasten upon her, to
admire her, and to enjoy triumphantly her confusion
in silence: “Ah, beauteous tyrant!” he then cried;
<PB N="291" REF="92"/>
“if this instant were less inappreciable, in what lan∣guage
could I upbraid thy unexampled abuse of power?
thy lacerating barbarity?”</P>
<P>He then, almost by force, took her hand; she strug∣gled
eagerly to recover it, but “No,” he cried,
“fair torturer! it is now my prisoner, and must
be punished for its inhuman sins, in the congeal∣ing
and unmerciful lines it has portrayed for me.”</P>
<P>And then, regardless of her resistance, which he
attributed to mere bashfulness, he obstinately and in∣cessantly
devoured it with kisses, in defiance of op∣position,
supplication, or anger, till, suddenly and pier∣cingly,
she startled him with a scream, and snatched it
away with a force irresistible.</P>
<P>Amazed, he stared at her. Her face was almost
convulsed with emotion; but her eyes, which appeared
to be fixed, directed him to the cause. At the bottom
of the walk, which was only a few yards distant, stood
Mandlebert.</P>
<P>Pale and motionless, he looked as if bereft of strength
and faculties. Camilla had seen him the moment she
raised her eyes, and her horror was uncontrollable.
Sir Sedley, astonished at what he beheld, astonished
what to think, drew back, with a supercilious kind of
bow. Edgar, recalled by what he thought insolence
to his recollection, advanced a few steps, and address∣ing
himself to Camilla, said: “I had the commands
of Sir Hugh to pursue you, Miss Tyrold, to give you
immediate notice that Mr. Lynmere is arrived.” He
added no more, deigned not a look at Sir Sedley, but
rapidly retreated, remounted his horse and gallopped
off.</P>
<P>Camilla looked after him till he was out of sight,
with uplifted hands and eyes, deploring his departure,
his mistake, and his resentment, without courage to
attempt stopping him.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley stood suspended, how to act, what to
judge. If Edgar's was the displeasure of a discarded
lover, why should it so affect Camilla? if of a success∣ful
one, why came she to meet him? why had she re∣ceived
and answered his notes?</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="93"/>
Finding she attempted neither to speak nor move,
be again approached her, and saying, “Fair Incom∣prehensible!—”
would again have taken her hand;
but rousing to a sense of her situation, she drew back,
and with some dignity, but more agitation, cried:
“Sir Sedley, I blush if I am culpable of any part of
your mistake: but suffer me now to be explicit, and
let me be fully, finally, and not too late understood.
You must write to me no more; I cannot answer nor
read your letters. You must speak to me no more,
except in public society; you must go further, Sir
Sedley—you must think of me no more.”</P>
<P>“Horrible!” cried he, starting back; “you dis∣tress
me past measure!”</P>
<P>“No, no, you will soon—easily—readily for∣get
me.”</P>
<P>“Inhuman! you make me unhappy past thought!”</P>
<P>“Indeed I am inexpressibly concerned; but the
whole affair—”</P>
<P>“You shock, you annihilate me, you injure me in
the tenderest point!”</P>
<P>Camilla now, amazed, cried, “what is it you
mean, sir?”</P>
<P>“By investing me, fair barbarian, with the teme∣rity
of forming any claim that can call for repulse!”</P>
<P>Utterly confounded by so unexpected a disclaiming
of all design, she again, though from far different fen∣sations,
cast up her eyes and hands. And is it, she
thought, for a trifler such as this, so unmeaning, so
unfeeling, I have risked my whole of hope and hap∣piness?</P>
<P>She said, however, no more; for what more could
be said? She coloured, past him, and hastily quitting
the garden, told the footman to apologise to Mrs. Arl∣bery
for her sudden departure, by informing her that
a near relation was just arrived from abroad; and
then got into the carriage and drove back to Cleves.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley followed carelessly, yet without aiming
at overtaking her, and intreated, negligently, to be
heard, yet said nothing which required the smallest
answer.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="94"/>
Piqued completely, and mortified to the quick,
by the conviction which now broke in upon him of
the superior ascendance of Mandlebert, he could not
brook to have been thought in earnest when he saw he
should not have been accepted, nor pardon his own va∣nity
the affront it had brought upon his pride. He
sung aloud an opera air till the carriage of Sir Hugh
was out of sight, and then drove his phaeton to Claren∣del-place,
where he instantly ordered his post-chaise,
and in less than an hour, set off on a tour to the He∣brides.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Summons to Happiness.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA had but just set out from Cleves, when
Sir Hugh, consulting his weather-cocks, which a new
chain of ideas had made him forget to examine, saw
that the wind was fair for the voyage of his nephew;
and heard, upon inquiry, that the favourable change
had taken place the preceding day, though the general
confusion of the house had prevented it from being
heeded by any of the family.</P>
<P>With eagerness the most excessive, he went to the
room of Eugenia, and bid her put on a smart hat to
walk out with him, as there was no knowing how soon
a certain person might arrive.</P>
<P>Eugenia, colouring, said she would rather stay
within.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="95"/>
“Well,” cried he, “you'll be neater, to be sure,
for not blowing about in the wind; so I'll go take
t'other girls.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, left alone, became exceedingly fluttered.
She could not bear to remain in the house under the
notion of so degrading a consideration as owing any
advantage to outward appearance; and fearing her
uncle, in his extreme openness, should give that reason
for her not walking, she determined to take a stroll by
herself in the park.</P>
<P>She bent her steps towards a small wood at some dis∣tance
from the house, where she meant to rest herself
and read; for she had learnt of Dr. Orkborne never to
be unprovided with a book: But she had not yet reach∣ed
her place of intended repose, when the sound of feet
made her turn round, and, to her utter consternation,
she saw a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign
air, announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere.</P>
<P>She doubted not but he was sent in pursuit of her;
and though youthful timidity prompted her to shun him,
she retained sufficient command over herself to check
it, and to stop till he came up to her; while he, nei∣ther
quickening nor slackening his pace as he approach∣ed,
passed her with so little attention, that she was pre∣sently
convinced he had scarce even perceived her.</P>
<P>Disconcerted by a meeting so strange, and so ill
timed, she involuntarily stood still, without any other
power than that of looking after him.</P>
<P>In a few minutes Molly Mill, running up to her,
cried: “Dear Miss, have not you seen young Mr.
Lynmere? He come by t'other way just as master, and
Miss Margland, and Miss Lynmere, and Miss Ty∣rold,
was gone to meet him by the great gate; and
so he said he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d come and look who he could find him∣self.”</P>
<P>Eugenia had merely voice to order her back. The
notion of having a figure so insignificant as to be passed,
without even exciting a doubt whom she might be, was
cruelly mortifying. She knew not how to return to
the house, and relate such an incident. She sat down
under a tree to recollect herself.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="96"/>
Presently, however, she saw the stranger turn quick
about, and before she could rise, slightly touching his
hat, without looking at her: “Pray, ma'am,” he said,
“do you belong to that house?” pointing to the man∣sion
of Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>Faintly she answered, “Yes, sir;” and he then ad∣ded:
“I am just arrived, and in search of Sir Hugh
and the young ladies; one of them they told me, was
this way; but I can trace nobody. Have you seen any
of them?”</P>
<P>More and more confounded, she could make no re∣ply.
Inattentive to her embarrassment, and still look∣ing
every way around, he repeated his question. She
then pointed towards the great gate, stammering she
believed they went that way. “Thank you;” he an∣swered,
with a nod, and then hurried off.</P>
<P>She now thought no more of moving nor of rising;
she felt a kind of stupor, in which, fixed, and without
reflection, she remained, till, startled by the sound of
her uncle's voice, she got up, made what haste she was
able to the house by a private path, and ascended to
her own room by a back stair-case.</P>
<P>That an interview to which she had so long looked
forward, for which, with unwearied assiduity, she had
so many years laboured to prepare herself, and which
was the declared precursor of the most important aera of
her life, should pass over so abruptly, and be circum∣stanced
so aukwardly, equally dispirited and confused
her.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, Molly Mill, entering, said:
“They're all come back, and Sir Hugh's fit to eat the
young squire up; and no wonder, for he's a sweet
proper gentleman, as ever I see. Come, miss, I hope
you'll put on something else, for that hat makes you
look worse than any thing. I would not have the young
squire see you such a figure for never so much.”</P>
<P>The artlessness of unadorned truth, however sure in
theory of extorting admiration, rarely, in practice,
fails inflicting pain or mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ification. The simple ho∣nesty
of Molly redoubled the chagrin of her young
mistress, who, sending her away, went anxiously to
<PB N="296" REF="97"/>
the looking-glass, whence, in a few moments, she
perceived her uncle, from the window, laughing, and
making significant signs to some one out of her sight.
Extremely ashamed to be so surprised, she retreated to
the other end of the room, though not till she had
heard Sir Hugh say: “Ay, ay, she's getting ready
for you; I told you why she would not walk out
with us, so don't let's hurry her, though I can't but
commend your being a little impatient, which I dare
say so is she, only young girls can't so well talk about
it.”</P>
<P>Eugenia now found that Clermont had no suspicion
he had seen her. Sir Hugh concluded she had left not
her room, and asked no questions that could lead to the
discovery.</P>
<P>Presently the baronet came up staris himself, and
tapping at the door, said. “Come, my dear, don't
be too curious, the breakfast having been spoilt this
hour already; besides your cousin's having nothing on
himself but his riding dress.”</P>
<P>Happy she could at least clear herself from so dero∣gatory
a design, she opened her door. Sir Hugh, sur∣veying
her with a look of surprise and vexation, ex∣claimed:
“What my dear! an't you dizen'd yet?
why I thought to have seen you in all your best
things!”</P>
<P>“No, sir,” answered she calmly; “I shall not drefs
till dinner-time.”</P>
<P>“My dear girl,” cried he, kindly, though a little
distressed how to explain himself; there's no need you
should look worse than you can help; though you can
do better things, I know, than looking well at any
time; only what I mean is, you should let him see
you to the best advantage at the first, for fear of his
taking any dislike before he knows about Dr. Ork∣borne,
and that.”</P>
<P>“Dislike, sir!” repeated she, extremely hurt; “if
you think he will take any dislike—I had better not see
him at all!”</P>
<P>“My dear girl, you quite mistake me, owing to my
poor head's always using the wrong word; which is a
<PB N="297" REF="98"/>
remarkable thing that I can't help. But I don't mean
in the least to doubt his being pleased with you, ex∣cept
only at the beginning, from not being used to
you; for as to all your studies, there's no more
Greek and Latin in one body's face, than in ano∣ther's;
but, however, if you won't dress, there's
no need to keep the poor boy in hot water for
nothing.”</P>
<P>He then took her hand, and rather dragged than
drew her down stairs, saying as they went: I must wish
you joy, though, for I assure you he's a very fine lad,
and hardly a bit of a coxcomb.”</P>
<P>The family was all assembled in the parlour, except
Camilla, for whom the baronet had instantly dispatch∣ed
Edgar, and Mr. Tyrold, who was not yet returned
from a morning ride, but form whom Sir Hugh had
ordered the great dinner bell to be rung, as a signal of
something extraordinary.</P>
<P>Young Lynmere was waiting the arrival of Euge∣nia
with avowed and unbridled impatience. Far from
surmising it was her he had met in the park, he had
concluded it was one of the maids, and thought of
her no more. He asked a thousand questions in
a breath when his uncle was gone. Was she tall?
was she short? was she plump? was she lean?
was she fair? was she brown? was she florid? was she
pale? But as she asked them of every body, nobody
answered; yet all were in some dismay at a curiosity
implying such entire ignorance, except Indiana, who
could not, without simpering, foresee the amaze∣ment
of her brother at her cousin's person and ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>“Here's a noble girl for you!” cried Sir Hugh,
opening the door with a flourish; “for all she's got so
many best thing's, she's come down in her worst, for
the sake of looking ill at the beginning, to the end
that there may be no fault to be found afterwards;
which is a wiseness that does honour to her educa∣tion.”</P>
<P>This was, perhaps, the first time an harangue from
the baronet had been thought too short; but the sur∣prise
<PB N="298" REF="99"/>
of young Lynmere, at the view of his destined
bride, made him wish he would speak on, merely to
annul any necessity for speaking himself. Eugenia
aimed in vain to recover the calmness of her na∣ture,
or to borrow what might resemble it from her
notions of female dignity. The injudicious speech of
Sir Hugh, by publicly forcing upon the whole party
the settled purpose of the interview, covered her with
blushes, and gave a tremor to her frame that obliged
her precipitately to seat herself, while her joined hands
supplicated his silence.</P>
<P>“Well, my dear, well!” said he, kissing her,
“don't let me vex you; what I said having no mean∣ing,
except for the best; though your cousin might as
well have saluted you before you sat down, I think;
which, however, I suppose may be out of fashion
now, every thing changing since my time; which,
Lord help me! it will take me long enough to
learn.”</P>
<P>Lynmere noticed not this hint, and they all seat∣ed
themselves round the breakfast table; Sir Hugh
scarce able to refrain from crying for joy, and con∣tinually
exclaiming: “This is the happiest day of all
my life, for all I've lived so long! To see us all to∣gether,
at last, and my dear boy come home to his na∣tive
old England!”</P>
<P>Miss Margland made the tea, and young Lynmere
instantly and almost voraciously began eating of every
thing that was upon the table. Indiana, when she
saw her brother as handsome as her cousin was de∣formed,
thought the contrast so droll, she could look
at neither without tittering; Lavina observed, with
extreme concern, the visible distress of her sister;
Dr. Orkborne forbore to ruminate upon his work,
in expectation, every moment, of being called upon
to converse with the learned young traveller; but Sir
Hugh alone spoke, though his delight and his loqua∣city
joined to his pleasure in remarking the good old
English appetite which his nephew had brought with
<PB N="299" REF="100"/>
him from foreign parts, prevented his being struck with
the general taciturnity.</P>
<P>The entrance of Mr. Tyrold proved a relief to all
the party, though a pain to himself. He suffered in see∣ing
the distressed confusion of Eugenia, and felt some∣thing
little short of indignation at the supercilious air
with which Clermont seemed to examine her; hold∣ing
his head high and back, as if measuring his superior
height, while every line round his mouth marked that
ridicule was but suppressed by contempt.</P>
<P>When Sir Hugh, at length, observed, that the young
traveller uttered not a syllable, he exclaimed: “Lord
help us! what fools it makes of us, being overjoyed!
here am I talking all the talk to myself, while my young
scholar says nothing! which I take to be owing to my
speaking only English; which, however, I should not
do, if it was not for the misfortune of knowing no
other, which I can't properly call a fault, being out of
no idleness, as that gentleman can witness for me; for
I'll warrant nobody's taken more pains; but our heads
won't always do what we want.”</P>
<P>He then gave a long and melancholy detail of his stu∣dies
and their failure.</P>
<P>When the carriage arrived with Camilla, young Lyn∣mere
loitered to a window, to look at it; Eugenia arose
meaning to seize the opportunity to escape to her room;
but seeing him turn round upon her moving, she again
sat down, experiencing, for the first time, a sensation
of shame for her lameness, which, hitherto, she had
regularly borne with fortiude, when she had not forgot∣ten
from indifference; neither did she feel spirits to ex∣hibit
again, before his tall and strikingly elegant figure,
her diminutive little person.</P>
<P>Camilla entered with traces of a disordered mind too
strongly marked in her countenance to have escaped obser∣vation,
had she been looked at with any attention. But
Eugenia and Lynmere ingrossed all eyes and all thoughts.
Even herself, at first sight of the husband elect of her
sister, lost, for a moment, all personal consideration,
and looked at him only with the interesting idea of the
future fate of Eugenia. But it was only for a moment;
when she turned round, and saw nothing of Edgar,
<PB N="300" REF="101"/>
when her uncle's inquiry what had become of him con∣vinced
her he was gone elsewhere, her heart sunk, she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt sick, and would have glided out of the room, had
not Sir Hugh, thinking her faint for want of her breakfast,
begged Miss Margland to make her some fresh tea;
adding, “As this is a day in which I intend us all to
be happy alike, I beg nobody will go out of the room,
for the sake of our enjoying it all together.”</P>
<P>This summons to happiness produced the usual effect
of such calls; a general silence, succeeded by a gene∣ral
yawning, and a universal secret wish of separation,
to the single exception of Sir Hugh, who, after a pause,
said, “Why nobody speaks but me! which I really
think odd enough. However, my dear nephew, if
you don't care for our plain English conversation, which,
indeed, after all your studies, one can't much wonder
at, nobody can be against you and the Doctor jabbering
together a little of your Greek and Latin.”</P>
<P>“Lynmere, letting fall his bread upon the table,
leaned back in his chair, and, sticking his hands in his
side, looked at his uncle with an air of astonish∣ment.</P>
<P>“Nay” continued the baronet, “I don't pretend I
should be much the wiser for it; however, it's what I've
no objection to hear; so come, Doctor! you're the old∣est;
break the ice!”</P>
<P>A verse of Horace with which Dr. Orkborne was
opening his answer, was stopt short, by the eager manner
in which Lynmere re-seized his bread with one hand,
while with the other, to the great discomposure of the
exact Miss Margland, he stretched forth for the tea-pot,
to pour out a bason of tea; not ceasing the libation till the
saucer itself, overcharged, sent his beverage in trickling
rills from the table-cloth to the floor.</P>
<P>The ladies all moved some paces from the table, to
save their clothes; and Miss Margland reproachfully
inquired if she had not made his tea to his liking.</P>
<P>“Don't mind it, I beg, my dear boy,” cried Sir
Hugh; “a little slop's soon wiped up; and we're all
friends: so don't let that stop your Latin.”</P>
<P>Lynmere, noticing neither the Latin, the mischief,
<PB N="301" REF="102"/>
nor the consolation, finished his tea in one draught, and
then said: “Pray, sir, where do you keep all your
newspapers?”</P>
<P>“Newspapers, my dear nephew? I've got no news∣papers:
what would you have us do with a mere set
of politics, that not one of us understand, in point of what
may be their true drift; now we're all met together
o'purpose to be comfortable?”</P>
<P>“No newspapers, sir?” cried Lynmere, rising, and
vehemently ringing the bell; and, with a scornful
laugh, adding, half between his teeth, “Ha! ha!
live in the country without newspapers! a good joke,
faith?”</P>
<P>A servant appearing, he gave orders for all the morn∣ing
papers that could be procured.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh looked much amazed; but presently start∣ing
up, said, “My dear nephew, I believe I've caught
your meaning, at last; for if you mean, as I take for
granted, that we're all rather dull company, why I'll
take your hint, and leave you and a certain person to∣gether,
to make a better acquaintance; which you can't
do so well while we're all by, on account of mo∣desty.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, frightened almost to sickness, caught by
her two sisters; and Mr. Tyrold, tenderly compassio∣nating
her apprehensions, whispered to Sir Hugh to dis∣pense
with a <HI>tête-à-tête</HI> so early: and, taking her hand,
accompanied her himself to her room, composing, and
re-assuring her by the way.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, though vexed, then followed, to issue some
particular orders, the rest of the party dispersed, and
young Lynmere remained with his sister.</P>
<P>Walking on tiptoe to the door, he shut it, and put
his ear to the key-hole, till he no longer heard any foot∣step.
Turning then hastily round, he flung himself,
full length, upon a sofa, and burst into so violent a fit of
laughter, he was forced to hold his sides.</P>
<P>Indiana, tittering, said, “Well, brother, how do
you like her?”</P>
<P>“Like her!” he repeated, when able to speak;
<PB N="302" REF="103"/>
“why the old gentleman doats! He can never, else,
seriously suppose I'll marry her.”</P>
<P>“He! he! he! yes, but he does, indeed, brother.
He's got every thing ready.”</P>
<P>“Has he, faith?” cried Lynmere, again rolling on
the sofa, almost suffocated with violent laughter: from
which suddenly recovering, he started up to stroam to a
large looking-glass, and, standing before it, in an easy
and most assured attitude, “Much obliged to him, 'pon
honour!' he exclaimed: “Don't you think,” turning
carelessly, yet in an elegant position, round to his sister,
“don't you think I am, Indiana?”</P>
<P>“Me, brother? la! I'm sure I think she's the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gliest
little fright, poor thing! I ever saw in the world, poor
thing! such a little, short, dumpty, hump backed,
crooked, limping figure of a fright—poor thing!”</P>
<P>“Yes, yes,” cried he, changing his posture, but
still undauntedly examining himself before the glass,
“he has taken amazing care of me, I confess; matched
me most exactly!”</P>
<P>Then sitting down, as if to consider the matter more
seriously, he took Indiana by the arm, and, with some
displeasure, said, “Why, what does the old quoz
mean? Does he want me to toss him in a blanket?”</P>
<P>Indiana tittered more than ever at this idea, till her
brother angrily demanded of her, why she had not writ∣ten
herself some description of this young Hecate, to
prepare him for her sight? Sir Hugh having merely
given him to understand that she was not quite beauti∣ful.</P>
<P>Indiana had no excuse to plead, but that she did not
think of it. She had, indeed, grown up with an aver∣sion
to writing, in common with whatever else gave
trouble, or required attention; and her correspondence
with her brother rarely produced more than two letters
in a year, which were briefly upon general topics, and
read by the whole family.</P>
<P>She now related to him the history of the will, and
the vow, which only in an imperfect, and but half-cre∣dited
manner had reached him.</P>
<P>His laughter then gave place to a storm of rage. He
<PB N="303" REF="104"/>
called himself ruined, blasted, undone; and abused Sir
Hugh as a good-for-nothing dotard, defrauding him of
his just rights and expectations.</P>
<P>“Why, that's the reason,” said Indiana, “he wants
to marry you to cousin Eugenia; because, he says, it's
to make you amends.”</P>
<P>This led him to a rather more serious consideration
of the affair; for, he protested the money was what
he could not do without. Yet, again parading to the
glass, “What a shame, Indiana,” he cried, “what a
shame would it be to make such a sacrifice? If he'll
only pay a trifle of money for me, and give me a few
odd hundreds to begin with, I'll hold him quit of all
else, so he'll but quit me of that wizen little stump.”</P>
<P>A newspaper, procured from the nearest public house,
being now brought, he pinched Indiana by the chin,
said she was the finest girl he had seen in England, and
whistled off to his appointed chamber.</P>
<P>Clermont Lynmere so entirely resembled his sister in
person, that now in his first youth, he might almost
have been taken for her, even without change of dress;
but the effect produced upon the beholders bore not the
same parallel: what in her was beauty in its highest
delicacy, in him seemed effeminacy in its lowest de∣gradation.
The brilliant fairness of his fore-head, the
transparent pink of his cheeks, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pouting vermillion
of his lips, the liquid lustre of his languishing blue
eyes, the minute form of his almost infantine mouth,
and the snowy whiteness of his small hands and taper
fingers, far from bearing the attraction which, in his
sister, rendered them so lovely, made him considered by
his own sex as an unmanly fop, and by the women, as
too conceited to admire any thing but himself.</P>
<P>With respect to his understanding, his superiority
over his sister was rather in education than in parts,
and in practical intercourse with the world, than in any
higher reasoning faculties. His character, like his
person, wanted maturing, the one being as distinct from
intellectual decision, as the other from masculine digni∣ty.
He had youth without diffidence, sprightliness with∣out
wit, opinion without judgment, and learning without
<PB N="304" REF="105"/>
knowledge. Yet, as he contemplated his fine person
in the glass, he thought himself without one external
fault; and, early cast upon his own responsibility, was
not conscious of one mental deficiency.</P>

<P>MR. TYROLD left Eugenia to her sisters, un∣willing
to speak of Lynmere till he had seen some∣thing
more of him. Sir Hugh, also, was going, for
he had no time, he said, to lose in his preparations;
but Eugenia, taking his arm, besought that nothing of
that kind might, at present, be mentioned.</P>
<P>“Don't trouble yourself about that, my dear,”
he answered; “for it's what I take all into my own
hands; your cousin being a person that don't talk much;
by which, how ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any thing be brought forward, if
nobody interferes? A girl, you know, my dear, can't
speak for herself, let her wish it never so much.”</P>
<P>“Alas!” said Eugenia, when he was gone, “how
painfully am I situated! Clermont will surely suppose
this precipitance all mine; and already, possibly, con∣cludes
it is upon my suggestion he has thus prematurely
been called from his travels, and impeded in his praise-worthy
ambition of studying the laws, manners, and
customs of the different nations of Europe!”</P>
<P>The wan countenance of Camilla, soon, however,
drew all observation upon herself, and obliged her to
narrate the cruel adventure of the morning.</P>
<P>The sisters were both petrified by the account of Sir
Sedley; and their compassion for his expected despair
was changed into disgust at his insulting impertinence.
<PB N="305" REF="106"/>
They were of opinion that his bird and his letters
should immediately be returned; and their horror of
any debt with a character mingling such presumption
with such levity, made Eugenia promise that, as soon
as she was mistress of so much money, she would send
him, in the name of Lionel, his two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The bird, therefore, by Tom Hodd, was instantly
conveyed to Clarendel-Place; but the letters Camilla
retained, till she could first shew them to Edgar,—if
this event had not lost him to her for ever, and if he
manifested any desire of an explanation.</P>
<P>Edgar himself, meanwhile, in a paroxysm of sudden
misery, and torturing jealousy, had gallopped furiously
to the rectory of Cleves.</P>
<P>“O, Doctor Marchmont!” he cried “what a tale
have I now to unfold! Within these last twenty-four
hours I have been the most wretched—the happiest—
and again the most agonized of human beings! I have
thought Camilla bestowed upon another,—I have be∣lieved
her,—oh, Doctor!—my own!—I have con∣ceived
myself at the summit of all earthly felicity!—
I find myself, at this moment deluded and undone!”</P>
<P>He then detailed the account, calling upon the Doc∣tor
to unravel to him the insupportable aenigma of his
destiny; to tell him for what purpose Camilla had
shewn him a tenderness so bewitching▪ at the very time
she was carrying on a clandestine intercourse with ano∣ther?
with a man, who, though destitute neither of
wit nor good qualities, it was impossible she should
love, since she was as incapable of admiring as of par∣ticipating
in his defects? To what incomprehensible
motives attribute such incongruities? Why accept and
suffer her friends to accept him, if engaged to Sir
Sedley? why, if seriously meaning to be his, this se∣cret
correspondence? Why so early, so private, so
strange a meeting? “Whence, Doctor Marchmont, the
daring boldness of his seizing her hand? whence the
never-to-be-forgotten licence with which he presumed
to lift it to his lips,—and there hardily to detain it, so
<PB N="306" REF="107"/>
as never man durst do, whose hopes were not all alive,
from his own belief in their encouragement! explain,
expound to me this work of darkness and amazement;
tell me why, with every appearance of the most artless
oppenness, I find her thus eternally disingenuous and un∣intelligible?
why, though I have cast myself wholly in∣to
her power, she retains all her mystery—she heightens
it into deceit next perjury?”</P>
<P>“Ask me, my dear young friend, why the sun does
not give night, and the moon day; then why women
practise conquetry. Alas! my season for surprise has
long been passed! They will rather trifle, even with
those they despise, than be candid even with those they
respect. The young baronet, probably has been mak∣ing
his court to her, or she has believed such was his
design; but as you first came to the point, she would
not hazard rejecting you, while uncertain if he were
serious. She was, possibly, putting him to the test, by
the account of your declaration, at the moment of your
unseasonable intrusion.”</P>
<P>“If this, Doctor, is your statement, and if your
statement is just, in how despi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ery have I risk∣ed
the peace of my life! You suppose then—that, if
sure of Sir Sedley—I am discarded?”</P>
<P>“You know what I think of your situation: can I,
when to yet more riches I add a title, suppose that of
Sir Sedley less secure?”</P>
<P>The shuddering start, the distracted look of Edgar,
with his hand clapped to his burning forehead, now
alarmed the Doctor; who endeavoured to somewhat
soften his sentence, dissuading him against any immedi∣ate
measures, and advising him to pass over these first
moments of emotion, and then coolly to suffer inquiry
to take place of decision. But Edgar could not hear
him; he shook hands with him, faintly smiled, as an
apology for not speaking; and hurrying off, without
waiting for his servant, gallopped toward the New
Forest: leaving his absence from Cleves to declare
his defection, and bent only to fly from Camilla, and
all that belonged to her.</P>
<P>All, however, that belonged to Camilla was precise∣ly
<PB N="307" REF="108"/>
what followed him; pursued him in every possible form,
clung to his heart-strings, almost maddened his senses.
He could not bear to reflect; retrospection was torture,
anticipation was horror. To lose thus, without neces∣sity,
without calamity, the object of his dearest wishes,
—to lose her from mere declension of esteem—</P>
<P>“Any inevitable evil,” he cried, “I could have
sustained; any blow of fortune, however severe; any
stroke of adversity, however terrible;—but this—this
error of all my senses—this deception of all my hopes
—this extinction of every feeling I have cherished”—</P>
<P>He rode on yet harder, leaping over every thing,
thoughtless rather than fearless of every danger he could
encounter, and galloping with the speed and violence
of some pursuit, though wholly without view, and al∣most
without consciousness; as if, hoping by flight, to
escape from the degenerate portrait of Camilla: but
its painter was his own imagination, and mocked the
attempt.</P>
<P>From the other side of a five-barred gate, which,
with almost frantic speed, he was approaching with a
view to clear, a voice halloo'd to stop him; and, at
the same time, a man who was leading one horse, and
riding another, dismounted, and called out, “Why,
as sure as I'm alive, it's Squire Mandlebert!”</P>
<P>Edgar now, perceiving Jacob, was going to turn
back to avoid him; but, restraining this first movement,
saintly desired him to stand by, as he had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot a mo∣ment
to lose.</P>
<P>“Good lack!” cried Jacob, with the freedom of
an old servant, who had known him from a boy;
“why, I would not but have happened to come this
way for never so much! why you might have broke
your neck, else! Leap such a gate as this here? why I
can't let you do no such a thing! Miss Camilla's like
a child of my own, as one may say; and she'll never
hold up her head again, I'll be bound for it, if you
should come to any harm; and, as to poor old master!
'twould go nigh to break his heart.”</P>
<P>Struck with words which, from so faithful an old ser∣vant,
<PB N="308" REF="109"/>
could not but be touching, Edgar, was brought
suddenly to himself, and felt the claim of the Tyrold
family for a conduct more guarded. He endeavoured
to put his own feelings apart, and consider how best
he might spare those of the friends of Camilla; those
of Camilla herself he concluded to be out of his reach,
except as they might simply relate to the female pride
and vanity of refusing rather than being given up.</P>
<P>He paused, now, to weigh how he might obviate any
offence; and, after first resolving to write a fort of ge∣neral
leave-taking, and next, seeing the almost insupe∣rable
objections to whatever he could state, determined
upon gaining time for deliberation, by merely com∣missioning
Jacob to carry a message to Cleves, that
some sudden affairs called him, for the present, to a
distant part of the country. This, at such a period,
would create a surprise that might lead the way to what
would follow: and Camilla, who could not, he thought
be much astonished, might then take her own measures
for the defection she would see reason to expect.</P>
<P>But Jacob resisted bearing the intelligence: “Good
lack, sir,” he cried, what have you got in your head!
something that will do you no good, I'll be bound, by
the look of your eyes, which look as big as if they was
both going to drop out; you'd better come yourself and
tell'em what's the matter, and speak a word to poor
Miss Camilla, or she'll never believe but what some
ill has <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tided you. Why we all knew about it,
fast enough, before our master told us; servants have
eyes as well as their masters; only Mary will have it
she found it out at the first, which an't true, for I saw
it by the time you'd been a week in the house; and if
you'll take my word, squire, I don't think there's such
another heart in the world as Miss Camilla's except just
my own old master's.”</P>
<P>Edgar leant against his horse, neither speaking no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
moving, yet involuntarily listening, while deeply
sighing.</P>
<P>“What a power of good she'll do,” continued Jacob,
“when she's mistress of Beech Park! I warrant she'll
go about, visiting the poor, and making them clothes,
<PB N="309" REF="110"/>
and broths, and wine possets, and baby-linen, all day long.
She has done it at Etherington quite from a child; and
when she had nothing to give 'em, she used to take her
thread papers and needle books, and sit down and work
for them, and carry them bits and scraps of things to
help 'em to patch their gowns. Why when she's got
your fine fortunes, she'll bring a blessing upon the whole
country.”</P>
<P>Edgar felt touched; his wrath was softened into ten∣derness,
and he ejaculated to himself: “Such, indeed,
I thought Camilla! active in charity, gentle in good
works—I thought that in putting my fortune into her
hands, I was serving the unhappy,—feeding the indi∣gent,
—reviving the sick!”</P>
<P>“Master,” continued Jacob, “took a fancy to her
from the very first, as well as I; and when master said
she was coming to live with us, I asked to make it a ho∣liday
for all our folks, and master was as pleased as I.
But nobody'd think what a tender heart she's got of her
own, without knowing her, because of her singing, and
laughing, and dancing so, except when old Miss Marg∣land's
in the way, who's what Mr. Lionel calls a kill∣joy
at any time. Howbeit, I'll take special care she
shan't be by when I tell her of my stopping you from
breaking your neck here; but I wish you could be in a
corner yourself, to peep at her, without her knowing it;
I'll warrant you she'll give me such a smile, you'd be fit
to eat her!”</P>
<P>Shaken once more in every resolution, because un∣certain
in every opinion, Edgar found the indignant
desperation which had seized him begin to subside, and
his mind again become assailable by something resemb∣ling
hope. Almost instinctively he remounted his horse▪
and almost involuntarily—drawn on by hearkening to
the praise of Camilla, and fascinated by the det<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
made by Jacob of her regard, accompanied him back to
Cleves.</P>
<P>As they rode into the park, and while he was ear∣nestly
endeavouring to form some palliation, by which
he might exculpate what seemed to him so guilty in the
strange meeting and its strange circumstances, he per∣ceived
<PB N="310" REF="111"/>
Camilla herself, walking upon the lawn. He
saw she had observed him, and saw, from her air, she
seemed irresolute if to re-enter the house, or await
him.</P>
<P>Jacob, significantly pointing her out, offered to shew
the effect he could produce by what he could relate;
but Edgar, giving him the charge of his house, earnestly
besought him to retire in quiet, and to keep his opinions
and experiments to himself.</P>
<P>Each now, separately, and with nearly equal difficul∣ty,
strove to attain fortitude to seek an explanation.
They approached each other; Camilla with her eyes
fixed upon the ground, her air embarrassed, and her
cheeks covered with blushes; Edgar with quick, but
almost tottering steps, his eyes wildly avoiding hers, and
his complexion pale even to indisposition.</P>
<P>When they were met within a few yards, they stopt;
Camilla still without courage to look up, and Edgar
striving to speak, but finding no passage for his voice.
Camilla, then, ashamed of her situation, raised her eyes,
and forced herself to say, “Have you been into the
house? Have you seen my cousin Lynmere?”</P>
<P>“No—madam.”</P>
<P>Struck with a cold formality that never before, from
Edgar, had reached her ears, and shocked by the sight
of his estranged and altered countenance, with the cruel
consciousness that appearances authorised the most de∣preciating
suspicions, she advanced, and holding out her
hand, “Edgar,” she gently cried, “are you ill? or
only angry?”</P>
<P>“O Camilla!” he answered, “can you deign to use
to me such a word? can you distort my dearest affections,
convulse my fairest hopes, eradicate every power of hap∣piness
—yet speak with so such sweetness—yet look at
me with such mildness? such softness—I had almost
said—such kindness?”</P>
<P>Deeply affected, she could hardly stand. He had
taken her offered hand, but in a manner so changed from
the same action the preceding day, that she scarce knew
if he touched while he held it, scarce felt that he relin∣quished,
as almost immediately she withdrew it.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="112"/>
But her condescension at this moment was rather a
new torment than any solace to him. The hand which
she proferred, and which the day before he had received
as the token of permanent felicity, he had now seen in
the possession <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nother, with every licence, every ap∣parent
mark of permitted rapture in which he had been
indulged himself. He knew not to whom it of right
belonged; and the doubt not merely banished happiness,
but mingled resentment with misery.</P>
<P>“I see,” cried she, after a morti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied pause; “you
have lost your good opinion of me—I can only, there∣fore—”
She stopt, but his melancholy silence was a
confirmation of her suggestion that offended her into
more exertion, and, with sensibility raised into dignity,
she added, “only hope your intended tour to the Con∣tinent
may take place without delay!”</P>
<P>She would then have walked on to the house; but
following her, “Is all over?” he cried, “and is it
thus, Camilla, we part?”</P>
<P>“Why not?” said she, suppressing a sigh, yet turning
back.</P>
<P>“What a question! cruel Camilla! Is this all the
explanation you allow me?”</P>
<P>“What other do you wish?”</P>
<P>“All!—every other!—that meeting—those let∣ters—”</P>
<P>“If you have any curiosity yet remaining—only
name what you desire.”</P>
<P>“Are you indeed so good?” cried he, in a voice that
shewed his soul again melting; “those letters, then—”</P>
<P>“You shall have them—every one!” she cried, with
alacrity; and instantly taking out her pocket-book,
presented him with the prepared packet.</P>
<P>“Penetrated by this unexpected openness and com∣pliance,
he snatched her hand, with intent to press it to
his lips; but again the recollection he had seen that li∣berty
accorded to Sir Sedley, joined to the sight of his
writing, checked him; he let it go; bowed his thanks
with a look of grateful respect, and attempting no more
to stop her, walked towards the summer-house, to pe∣ruse
the letters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Resolutions.</HEAD>
<P>THE sound of the dinner-bell, which rang in the
ears of Edgar before he reached his intended retreat,
would have been unnoticed, if not seconded by a mes∣sage
from Sir Hugh, who had seen him from his win∣dow.</P>
<P>Compelled to obey, though in a state of suspense
almost intolerable, he put up the important little
packet, and repaired to the dining parlour; where,
though none were equally disturbed with himself, no
one was at ease. Young Lynmere, under an appear∣ance
of mingled assurance and apathy, the effect of
acquired conceit, playing upon natural insipidity, was
secretly tormented with the rue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul necessity of sacrifi∣cing
either a noble <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortune, or his own fine person;
Sir Hugh felt a strange disappointment from the whole
behaviour of his nephew, though it was what he would
not acknowledge, and could not define; Mr. Tyrold
saw with much uneasiness the glaringly apparent un∣suitableness
of the intended alliance; Eugenia had
never yet thought herself so plain and insignificant,
and felt as if, even since the morning, the small-pox
had renewed its ravages, and she had sunk into being
shorter; Indiana and Miss Margland were both acute∣ly
incensed with Mandlebert; Dr. Orkborne saw
but small reason to expect gratitude for his labours
from the supercilious negligence of the boasted young
student; Lavinia was disturbed for both her sisters;
and Camilla <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt that all she valued in li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e depended
upon the next critical hour or two.</P>
<P>In this state of general discomfort, Sir Hugh, who
<PB N="313" REF="114"/>
could never be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilent, alone talked. Having long pre∣pared
himself to look upon this meeting as a day of
happiness, he strove to believe, for a while, the whole
family were peculiarly enjoying themselves; but, upon
a dead silence, which enlued upon his taking a copious
draught of Mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ira and water, “Why, my dear
nephew,” he cried, putting down his goblet, “you
don't tell us any thing? which I've no doubt but you
know why yourself. However, as we're all met o'
purpose to see you, I can't say I should be sorry
to hear the sound of your voice, provided it won't be
disagreeable.”</P>
<P>“We are no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much—conver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant, sir, in each
other's connexions, I believe,” answered Lynmere,
without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asing a moment <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eat, and to help himself,
and ordering a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h plate at every second mouthful;
“I have seen nothing, yet, of your folks hereabouts;
and, I fancy, sir, you don't know a great deal of the
people I have been used to.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, having good humouredly acknowledged
this to be t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th, was at a loss what further to pur∣pose;
and, imagining the taciturnity of the rest of
the party to proceed from an awe of the knowledge
and abilities of his nephew, soon became himself so
infected with fear and reverence, that, though he
could not be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>t, he spoke only to those who were
next him, and in a whisper.</P>
<P>When the dessert was served, something like a ge∣neral
relief was effected by the unexpected entrance
of Dr. Marchmont▪ Alarmed by the ungoverned, and,
in him, unpre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edented, emotions of Edgar, he had
been to Beech Park; and, finding he had not returned
there, had ridden on, in the most uneasy uncertainty,
to inquire for him at Cleves.</P>
<P>Happy to see him safe, though almost smiling to
see with whom, he was beginning some excuse for his
intrusion, when the baronet saved his proceeding, by
calling our, “Well, this is as good a piece of good
luck as any we've met with yet! Here's Dr. March∣mont
come to with us joy; and he's as good a scholar
as yourself, nephew, for any thing I know to the
<PB N="314" REF="115"/>
contrary, why you need not be so afraid of speaking,
for the sake of our not understanding you; which
here's five of us can do now, as well as yourself.”</P>
<P>Lynmere, readily concluding Mr. Tyrold and
Edgar, with the two Doctors, made four, glanced
round the table to see who might be the fifth; when,
supposing it Miss Margland, he withdrew his eyes
with a look of derision, and, turning to the butler,
asked what wines he might call for.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then proposed that they should all pair
off; the ignorant ones going one way, and the learned
ones staying another.</P>
<P>It would be difficult to say which looked most
averse to this proposition, Eugenia, or the young
traveller; who hastily said, “I always ride after
dinner, sir. Is your groom at hand? Can he shew
me your horses?”</P>
<P>“My nephew little suspects,” cried Sir Hugh,
winking, “Eugenia belongs to the scholars! Ten
to one but he thinks he's got Homer and Horace
to himself! But here, my dear boy, as you're so
fond of the classics”—</P>
<P>Clermont, nimbly rising, and knocking down a
decanter of water in his haste, but not turning back
to look at it, nor staying to offer any apology, af∣fected
not to hear his uncle, and flung hastily out
of the room, calling upon Indiana to follow him.</P>
<P>“In the name of all the <HI>Diavoli,</HI>” cried he,
pulling her into the park with him, “what does
all this mean? Is the old gentleman <HI>non compos?</HI>
what's all this stuff he descants upon so freely, of
scholars, and classics, and Homer, and Horace?”</P>
<P>“O you must ask Eugenia, not me!” answered In∣diana,
scornfully.</P>
<P>“Why, what does Eugenia know of the mat∣ter?”</P>
<P>“Know? why every thing. She's a great scho∣lar,
and has been brought up by Dr. Orborne; and
she talks Greek and Latin.”</P>
<P>“Does she so? then, by the Lord! she's no
wife of mine! I'd as soon marry the old Doctor him∣self!
<PB N="315" REF="116"/>
and I'm sure he'd make me as pretty a wife▪
Greek and Latin! why, I'd as soon tie myself to a
rod. Pretty sort of dinners she'll give!”</P>
<P>“O dear, yes, brother; she don't care what she
eats; she cares for nothing but books, and such kind
of things.”</P>
<P>“Books! ha! ha! Books, and Latin and Greek!
upon my faith, a pretty wife the old gentleman has
been so good as to find me! why he must b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a down∣right
driveller!”</P>
<P>“Ah, brother, if we had all that fortune, what a
different figure we should cut with it!”</P>
<P>“Why, yes, I rather flatter myself we should. No
great need of five thousand a year to pore over books!
Ha! ha! faith, this is a good hum enough! So he
thinks to take me in, does he?”</P>
<P>“Why, you know, she is so rich, brother.”—</P>
<P>“Rich? well, and what am I? do you see such a
figure as this,” (suddenly skipping before her,) “every
day? Am I reduced to my last legs, think you? Do
you suppose I can't meet with some kind old dowa∣ger
any time these twenty years?”</P>
<P>“La, brother, won't you have her then?”</P>
<P>“No, faith, won't I! It's not come to that, nei∣ther.
This learning is worse than her ugliness;
'twould make me look like a dunce in my own
house.”</P>
<P>He then protested he had rather lose forty estates,
than so be sacrificed, and vowed, without venturing
a direct refusal he would soon sicken the old gentle∣man
of his scheme.</P>
<P>Eugenia, in retreating to her room, was again
accompanied by her father and her uncle, whom she
conjured now, to name her to Clermont no more.</P>
<P>“I can't say I admire these puttings off, my dear,”
said the baronet, “in this our mortal state, which is
always liable to end in our dying. Not that I pretend
to tell you I think him over much alert; but there's
<PB N="316" REF="117"/>
no knowing but what he may have some meaning in
it that we can't understand; a person having studied
all his life, has a right to a little particularity.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold himself now seriously interfered, and
desired that, henceforth, Clermont might be treated
as if his visit to Cleves was merely to congratulate his
uncle upon his recovery; and that all schemes, pre∣parations,
and allusions, might be put aside, unless
the youth himself, and with a good grace, brought
them forward; mean while, he and Lavinia would
return without delay to Etherington, to obviate all
appearance of waiting the decision of any plan.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was much discomfited by the exaction
of such forbearance, yet could the less oppose it, from
his own internal discontent with his nephew, which
he inadvertently betrayed, by murmuring, in his way
to his chamber, “There's no denying but what
they've got some odd-fangled new ways of their
own, in those foreign parts; meeting a set of old
relations for the first time, and saying nothing to
them, but asking for the newspapers! Lord help us!
caring about the wide world, so, when we know no∣thing
of it, instead of one's own uncles and nephews,
and kinspeople!”</P>
<P>During this time, Edgar, almost agonised by sus∣pence
and doubt, had escaped to the summer-house,
whither he was followed by Dr. Marchmont, greatly
to the wonder, almost with the contempt of Dr.
Orkborne; whom he quitted, in anxiety for his
young friend, just as he had intimated a design to
consult him upon a difficult passage in an ancient au∣thor,
which had a place in his work, that was now
nearly ready for the press.</P>
<P>“I know well, Doctor,” said Edgar, “that to
find me here, after all that has passed, will make
you conclude me the weakest of men—but I cannot
now explain how it has been brought about—these
letters must first tell me if Camilla and I m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et more
than once again.”</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="118"/>
He then hastily ran over the letters; but by no
means hastily could he digest, nor even comprehend
their contents. He thought them florid, affected, and
presuming; yet vague, studied, with little appear∣ance
of sincerity, and less of explicit decision. What
related to Lionel, and to aiding him in the disposal of
his wealth, seemed least intelligible, yet most like se∣rious
meaning; but when he found that the inter∣view
at the Grove was by positive appointment, and
granted to a request made with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orwardness and as∣surance
so wide from all delicacy and propriety, the
blood mounted high into his cheeks, and precipitately
putting up the packer, he exclaimed: “Here, then,
it ends! the last little ray of hesitation is extinct—ex∣tinct
to be kindled never more!”</P>
<P>The sound of these last words caused him an emo∣tion
of sorrow he was unable to resist, though unwil∣ling
to betray, and he hurried out of the summer∣house
to the wood, where he strove to compose his
mind to the last leave-taking upon which he was now
determined; but so dreadful was the resolution which
exacted from his own mouth the resignation of all
that, till now, had been dearest to his views and
hopes, that the afternoon was far advanced, before he
could assume sufficient courage to direct his steps to
the spot where the sacrifice was to be made.</P>
<P>Accusing, himself, then, of weakness unpardona∣ble,
he returned to the summer-house, to apologise
to Dr. Marchmont for his abrupt retreat; but the
Doctor had already re-entered the mansion. Thither,
therefore, he proceeded, purposing to seek Camilla, to
return her the letters of Sir Sedley, and to desire her
commands in what manner to conduct himself with
her father and her uncle, in acknowledging his fears
that the projected union would fail of affording, to
either party, the happiness which, at first, it seemed
to promise.</P>
<P>The carriage of Sir Hugh was in waiting at the
door, and Mr. Tyrold and Lavinia were in the hall.
Edgar, in no condition for such an encounter, would
have avoided them; but Mr. Tyrold, little suspect∣ing
<PB N="318" REF="119"/>
his desire, rejoiced at the meeting, saying he had
had the house searched for him in vain, that he might
shake hands with him before his return to Ethe∣rington.</P>
<P>Then, taking him apart, “My dear Edgar,” he
cried, “I have long loved you as tenderly, and I
may now confide in you as completely, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s if you were
my son. I go hen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in some inquietude; I fear my
brother has been too hasty in making known his view
with regard to Clermont; who does not seem equal to
appreciating the worth of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, though it is evi∣dent
he has not been slack in nothing h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r misfortunes.
I entreat you, during my absence, to examine him as
if you were already the brother of that dear child,
who merits, you well know, the best and tenderest of
husbands.”</P>
<P>He then followed Lavinia into the carriage, pre∣vented
by his own occupied mind from observing
the fallen countenance of Edgar, who, more wretch∣ed
than ever, bemoaned now the kindness of which
he had hitherto been proud, and lamented the pater∣nal
trust which he would have purchased the day be∣fore
almost with life.</P>
<P>Camilla, during this period, had gone through con∣flicts
no lese severe.</P>
<P>Jacob, who had bought a horse, for which he
had cheerfully advanced <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. had informed her of the
gate adventure of Edgar, and told her that, but for
his stopping him, he was riding like mad from Cleres,
and only sending them all a message that he could not
come back.</P>
<P>Grieved, surprised, and offended, she instantly de∣termined
she would not risk such another mark of his
cold superiority, but restore to him his liberty, and
leave him master of himself. “If the severity of his
judgment,” cried she, “is so much more potent than
the warmth of his affection, it shall not be his delicacy,
nor his compassion, that shall make me his. I will
neither be the wife of his repentance nor of his pity.
<PB N="319" REF="120"/>
I must be convinced of his unaltered love, his esteem,
his trust—or I shall descend to humiliation not rise
to happiness, in becoming his. Softness h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e would
be meanness; submission degrading—if he hesitates—
let him go!”</P>
<P>She then, without weighing, or even seeing one ob∣jection,
precipitately resolved to beg permission of
her friends, to accept an invitation she had received,
without as yet answering, to meet Mrs. Berlinton at
Southampton, where that lady was going to pass some
weeks. She could there, she thought, give the re∣jection
which here its inviolable circumstances made
her, for Lionel's sake, afraid to risk; or she could
there, if a full explanation should appease him, find
opportunity to make it with equal safety; his dis∣like
to that acquaintance rather urged than impeded
her plan, for her wounded spirit panted to prove
its independence and dignity.</P>
<P>Eugenia approved this elevation of sentiment, and
doubted not it would shew her again in her true
light to Edgar, and bring him, with added esteem,
to her feet.</P>
<P>Camilla wept with joy at the idea: “Ah!” she
cried, “if such should be my happy fate; if, after
hearing all my imprudence, my precipitance, and
want of judgment, he should voluntarily, when
wholly set free, return to me—I will confess to him
every feeling—and every failing of my heart! I will
open to him my whole soul, and cast myself ever af∣ter
upon his generosity and his goodness—O, my
Eugenia! almost on my knees could I receive—a se∣cond
time—the vows of Edgar Mandlebert!”</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Ease and Freedom.</HEAD>
<P>LYNMERE, at tea-time, returned from his ride,
with a fixed plan of frightening or disgusting the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aronet from the alliance; with Eugenia, herself, he
imagined the attempt would be vain, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or he did not
conoeive it possible any woman who had eyes could
be induced to reject him.</P>
<P>Determined, therefore, to indulge, in full, both
the natural presumption and acquired luxuriance of
his character, he conducted himself in a manner that,
to any thing short of the partiality of Sir Hugh,
would have rendered him insupportably offensive:
but Sir Hugh had so long cherished a reverence for
what he had himself ordered with regard to his stu∣dies,
and what he implicitly credited of his attain∣ments,
that it was more easy to him to doubt his
senses, than to suppose so accomplished a scholar
could do any thing but what was right.</P>
<P>“Your horses are worth nothing, sir,” cried he,
in entering; “I never rode so unpleasant a beast.
“I don't know who has the care of your stud; but
whoever it is, he deserves to be hanged.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh could not refuse, either to his justice or
his kindness, to vindicate his faithful Jacob; and for his
horses he made as many excuses, as if every one had
been a human creature, whom he was recommending
to his mercy, with a fear they were unworthy of
his favour.</P>
<P>Not a word was said more, except what Miss
Margland, from time to time, extorted, by begging
questions, in praise of her tea, till Lynmere, violently
ringing the bell, called out to order a fire.</P>
<P>Every body was surprised at this liberty, without
any previous demand of permission from the baronet,
<PB N="321" REF="122"/>
or any inquiry into the feelings of the rest of the
company; and Sir Hugh, in a low voice, said to
Eugenia, “I am a little afraid poor Mary will be
rather out of humour to have the grate to po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh
again to-morrow morning, in the case my nephew
should not like to have another fire then; which, I sup∣pose,
if the weather continues so hot, may very like∣ly
not be agreeable to him.”</P>
<P>Another pause now ensued; Dr. Marchmont, who,
of the whole party, was alone, at this time, capable of
leading to a general conversation, was separately oc∣cupied
by watching Camilla; while himself, as usual,
was curiously and unremittingly examined by Dr.
Orkborne, in whom so much attention to a young
lady raised many private doubts of the justice of his
scholastic fame; which soon, by what he observed
of his civility even to Miss Margland, were confirmed
nearly to scepticism.</P>
<P>Mary, now, entering with a coal s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uttle and a can∣dle,
Lynmere, with much displeasure, called out,
“Bring wood; I hate coals.”</P>
<P>Mary, as much displeased, and nearly as much hu∣moured
as himself, answered that nothing but coals
were ever burnt in that grate.</P>
<P>“Take it all away, then, and bid my man send me
my pelisse. That I made to cross the Alps in.”</P>
<P>“I am very sorry, indeed, nephew,” said Sir
Hugh, “that we were not better prepared for your
being so chilly, owing to the weather being set in so
sultry, that we none of us much thought of having a
fire; and, indeed, in my young time, we were ne∣ver
allowed thinking of such things before Michael-mas-day;
which I suppose is quite behind-hand now.
Pray, nephew, if it is not too much trouble to you,
what's the day for lighting fires in foreign parts?”</P>
<P>“There's no rule of that sort, now, fir, in modern
philosophy; that kind of thing's completely out; en∣tirely
exploded, I give you my word.”</P>
<P>“Well, every thing's new, Lord help me, since
I was born! But pray, nephew, if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may ask,
without tiring you too much, on account of my ig∣norance,
<PB N="322" REF="123"/>
have they fires in summer as well as win∣ter
there?”</P>
<P>“Do you imagine there are grates and fires on
the Continent, sir, the same as in England? ha!
ha!”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was discountenanced from any further in∣quiry.</P>
<P>Another silence ensued, broken again by a vehe∣ment
ringing of the bell.</P>
<P>When the servant appeared, “What have you
got,” cried Lynmere, “that you can bring me to
eat?”</P>
<P>“Eat, nephew! why you would not eat before
supper, when here's nobody dore tea? not that I'd
have you baulk your appetite, which, to be sure, ought
to be the best judge”</P>
<P>The youth ordered some oysters.</P>
<P>There were none in the house.</P>
<P>He desired a barrel might immediately be procu∣red;
he could eat nothing else.</P>
<P>Still Edgar, though frequent opportunities occur∣red,
had no fortitude to address Camilla, and no spi∣rits
to speak. To her, however, his dejection was a
revival; she read in it her power, and hoped her pre∣sent
plan would finally confirm it.</P>
<P>A servant now came in, announcing a person who
had brought two letters, one for Sir Hugh, the other
for Miss Camilla, but who said he would deliver
them himself. The baronet desired he might be ad∣mitted.</P>
<P>Several minutes passed, and he did not appear.
The wonder of Sir Hugh was awakened for his letter;
but Camilla, dreading a billet from Sir Sedley, was in
no haste.</P>
<P>Lynmere, however, glad of an opportunity to issue
orders, or make disturbance, furiously rang the bell,
saying: “Where are these letters?”</P>
<P>“Jacob,” <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid the baronet, “my nephew don't
mean the slowness to be any fault of yours, it being
what you can't help; only tell the person than brought
us our letters, we should be glad to look at them, not
knowing who they may be from.”</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="124"/>
“Why he seems but an odd sort of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, sir; I can't
much make him out; he's been begging some flour to
put in his hair; he'll make himself so spruce, he says,
we sha'n't know him again; I can't much think he's a
gentleman.”</P>
<P>He then, however, added he had made a mistake,
as there was no letter for his master, but one for Miss
Camilla, and the other for Miss Margland.</P>
<P>“For me?” exclaimed Miss Margland, breaking
from a scornful silence, during which her under lip
had been busy to express her contempt of the curiosity
excited upon this subject “Why how dare they not
tell me it was for me? it may be from somebody of
consequence, about something of importance, and
here's half a day lost before I can see it!”</P>
<P>She then rose to go in search of it herself, but
opened the door upon Mr. Dubster.</P>
<P>A ghost, could she have persuaded herself she had
seen one, could not more have astonished, though it
would more have dismayed her. She drew haugh∣tily
back, saying: “Is there nobody else to come?”</P>
<P>The servant answered in the negative, and she re∣treated
to her chair.</P>
<P>Camilla alone was not perplext by this sight; she
had already, from the description, suggested whom she
might expect, according to the intimation given by
the ever mischievous Lionel.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, concluding he would turn out to
be some broken tradesman, prepared herself-to expect
that the letter was a petition, and watched for an op∣portunity
to steal out of the room.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster made two or three low bows, while
he had his hand upon the door, and two or three more
when he had shut it. He then cast his eyes round
the room, and espying Camilla, with a leering sor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of smile, said: “O, you're there, ma'am! I should
find you our in a hundred. I've got a letter for you,
ma'am, and another for the gentlewoman I took for
your mamma; and I was not much out in my guess,
for there's no great difference, as one may say, be∣tween
a mamma and a governess; only the mother's the
more natural, like.”</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="125"/>
He then presented her a letter, which she hastily
put up, not daring to venture at a public perusal,
lest it might contain not merely something ludi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rous
concerning Mr. Dubster, to which she was wholly in∣different,
but allusions to Sir Sedley Clarendel, which,
in the actual situation of things, might be fatally un∣seasonable.</P>
<P>“And now,” said Mr. Dubster, “I must give up
my t'other letter, asking the gentlewoman's pardon
for not giving it before; only I was willing to give
the young lady her's first, young ladies being apt to
be more in a hurry than people a little in years.”</P>
<P>This address did not much add to the benevolent
eagerness of Miss Margland to read the epistle, and
endeavouring to decline accepting it: “Really,” she
said, “unless I know what it's about, I'm not much
used to receiving letters in that manner.”</P>
<P>“As to what it's about,” cried he, with a half sup∣pressed
simper, and nodding his head on one side;
“that's a bit of a secret, as you'll see when you've
read it.”</P>
<P>“Indeed, good man, I wish you very well; but
as to reading all the letters that every body brings one,
it requires more time than I can pretend to have to
spare, upon every trifling occasion.”</P>
<P>She would then have retired; but Mr. Dubster,
stopping her, said: “Why, if you don't read it, ma'
am, nobody'll be never the wiser for what I come
about, for it's ungain-like to speak for one's self; and
the young gentleman said he'd write to you, because,
he said, you'd like it the best.”</P>
<P>“The young gentleman? what young gentle∣man?”</P>
<P>“Young squire Tyrold; he said you'd be as plea∣sed
as any thing to tell it to the old gentleman your∣self;
for you was vast fond, he said, of matrimo∣ny.”</P>
<P>“Matrimony? what have I to do with matrimo∣ny?”
cried Miss Margland, reddening and bridling;
“if it's any vulgar trick of that kind, that Mr. Lio∣nel
is amusing himself with, I'm not quite the right
<PB N="325" REF="126"/>
sort of person to be so played upon; and I desire,
mister, you'll take care how you come to me any more
upon such errands, lest you meet with your proper de∣serts.”</P>
<P>“Dear heart! I'm not going to offer any thing un∣civil.
As to matrimony, it's no great joke to a man,
when once he's made his way in the world; it's more
an affair of you ladies by half.”</P>
<P>“Of us? upon my word! this is a compliment ra∣ther
higher than I expected. Mr. Lionel may find,
however, I have friends who will resent such im∣pertinence,
if he imagines he may send who he will
to me with proposals of this sort.”</P>
<P>“Lauk, ma'am, you need not be in such a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>right
for nothing! however, there's your lett<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> ma'am,”
putting it upon the table; “and when you are in bet∣ter
cue, I suppose you'll read it.”</P>
<P>Then, advancing to Camilla: “Now, ma'am, let's
you and I have a little talk together; but first, by
good rights, I ought to speak to your uncle only I
dont know which he is; 'twill be mortal kind if you'll
help a body out.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was going to answer for himself, when
Lynmere, sat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gued with so long a scene in which
he had no share, had recourse to his friend the bell,
calling out, at the same time, in a voice of impatience,
“No oysters yet!”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now began to grow unhappy for his ser∣vants;
for himself he no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only could bear any thing,
but still con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luded he had nothing to bear; but his
domestics began all to wear long fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and, accustom∣ed
to see them happy, he was hurt to observe the
change. No partiality to his nephew could disguise
to him, that, long used to every possible indulgence,
it was vain to hope they would submit, without mur∣muring,
to so new a bondage of continual and pe∣remptory
commands. Instead of attending, therefore,
to Mr Dubster, he considered what apology to offer to
Jacob; who suspecting by whom he was summoned,
did not make his appearance till Lynmere had rung
again.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="127"/>
“Where are these oysters?” he then demanded▪
“have you been eating them?”</P>
<P>“No, sir,” answered he surlily; “we're not so
sharp set; we live in Old England; we don't come
from outlandish countries.”</P>
<P>This true John Bullism, Lynmere had neither sense
to despise, nor humour to laugh at; and, seriously in
a rage, called out, “Sirrah, I'll break your bones!”
and li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted up his riding switch, with which, as well
as his boots, he had re-entered the parlour.</P>
<P>“The Lord be good unto me!” cried Sir Hugh,
“what new ways are got into the world! but don't
take it to heart, Jacob, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or as to breaking your bones,
after all your long services, it's a thing I sha'n't con∣sent
to; which I hope my nephew won't take ill.”</P>
<P>Affronted with the master, and enraged with the
man, Lynmere stroamed petulantly up and dwon the
room, with loud and marked steps, that called, or at
least disturbed the attention of every one, exclaiming,
at every turning, “A confounded country this! a
villainous country! nothing to be had in it! I don't
know what in the world to think of that there's any
chance I can get!”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, recovering, said he was sorry he was so
badly off; and desired Jacob not to fail procuring
oysters if they were to be had within a mile.</P>
<P>“A mile?—ten miles! say ten miles round,”
cried Lynmere, “or you do nothing; what's ten
miles for a thing of that sort?”</P>
<P>“Ten miles, nephew? what? at this time of night!
why you don't think, with all your travelling, that
when they've got ten miles there, they'll have ten
miles to come back, and that makes count twenty.”</P>
<P>“Well, Sir, and suppose it was forty; what have
such fellows to do better?”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh blessed himself, and Mr. Dubster said to
Camilla: “So, ma'am, why you don't read your let∣ter,
neither, no more than the gentlewoman; how∣ever,
I think you may as well see a little what's in it;
though I suppose no great matters, being from a
lady.”</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="128"/>
“A lady<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what lady?” cried she, and eagerly ta∣king
it from her pocket, saw the hand-writing of
Mrs Berlinton, and inquired how it came into his
possession.</P>
<P>He answered, that happening to meet the lady's
foo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man, whom he had known something of while in
business, as he was going to put it to the post, he
told him he was coming to the very house, and so took
it to bring himself, the man being rather in a hurry
to go another way; “so I thought 'twas as well,
ma'am,” he added, “to save you the postage; for as
to a day or so sooner or later, I suppose it can break
no great squares, in you ladies letter-writing.”</P>
<P>Camilla, hastily running it over; found it contain∣ed
a most pressing repetition of invitation from Mrs.
Berlinton for the Southampton plan, and informa∣tion
that she should make a little circuit, to call and
take her up at Cleves, if not immediately forbidden;
the time she named for her arrival, though four days
distant from the date of her letter, would be now
the following morning.</P>
<P>This seemed, to the agitated spirits of Camilla,
an inviting opening to her scheme. She gave the
letter to her uncle, saying, in a fluttered manner, she
should be happy to accompany Mrs. Berlinton, for
a few days, if her father should not disapprove the
excursion, and if he could himself have the goodness
to spare one of the carriages to fetch her home, as
Southampton was but sixteen miles off.</P>
<P>While Sir Hugh, amazed at this request, yet al∣ways
unable to pronounce a negative to what she de∣sired,
stammered, Edgar abruptly took leave.</P>
<P>Thunderstruck by his departure, she looked af∣frighted,
after him, with a sigh impossible to repress;
she now first weighed the hazard of what she was do∣ing,
the deep game she was inconsiderately playing.
Would it sunder—would it unite them?—Tears
started into her eyes at the doubt; she did not hear
her uncle's answer; she rose to hurry out of the room;
but before she could escape, the big drops rolled fast
down her cheeks; and, when arrived at her chamber,
<PB N="328" REF="129"/>
“I have lost him!” she cried, by my own unreflect∣ing
precipitance; “I have lost him, perhaps, for
ever!”</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont now also took leave; Mr. Dub∣ster
desired he might speak with the baronet the next
morning; and the family remained alone.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Dilemmas.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the baronet was pondering, in the most
melancholy manner, upon this sudden and unexpect∣ed
demand of absence in Camilla, the grim goddess
of Envy took possession of the fine features of Indi∣ana;
who declared she was immured alive, while her
cousin went every where. The curiosity of Lynmere
being excited, to inquire what was to be had or done
at Southampton, he heard it abounded in good com∣pany,
and good fish, and protested he must undoubt∣edly
set out for it the next morning.</P>
<P>Indiana then wept with vexation and anger, and
Miss Margland affirmed, she was the only young
lady in Hampshire, who had never been at South∣ampton
Sir Hugh, concluding Edgar would attend
Camilla, feared it might hurt the other match to
part Eugenia from Clermont; and, after a little pause,
though deeply <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighing at such a dispersion from Cleves,
consented that they should all go together. Camilla,
therefore, was commissioned to ask leave of Mr. Ty∣rold
for Eugenia, as well as for herself, and to add a
petition from Sir Hugh, that he and Lavinia would
spend the time of their absence at Cleves. The ba∣ronet
then, of his own accord, asked Dr. Orkborne
<PB N="329" REF="130"/>
to be of the party, that Eugenia, he said, might
run over her lessons with him in a morning, for
fear of forgetting them.</P>
<P>A breach, however, such as this, of plans so long
formed, and a desertion so voluntary of his house, at
the very epoch he had settled for rendering its resi∣dence
the most desirable, sent him in complete dis∣comfiture
to his bed. But there, in a few hours,
his sanguine temper, and the kindness of his heart
new modelled and new coloured the circumstances
of his chagrin. He considered he should have
full time to prepare for the double marriages; and
that, with the aid of Lavinia, he might delight and
amaze them all, with new dresses and new trinkets,
which he could now choose without the torment of
continual opposition from the documentising Miss
Margland. Thus he restored his plastic mind to its
usual satisfaction, and arose the next morning with∣out
a cloud upon his brow. The pure design of be∣nevolence
is to bestow happiness upon others, but its
intrinsic reward is bringing happiness home!</P>
<P>But this sweetness of nature, so aptly supplying
the first calls, and the first virtues of philosophy, was
yet more severely again tried the next morning:
for when, forgetting the caution he had solemnly
promised, but vainly endeavoured to observe, he in∣timated
to Lynmere these purposes, the youth, blush∣ing
at the idea of being taken for the destined hus∣band
of Eugenia in public, preferred all risks to be∣ing
followed by such a rumour to Southampton;
and, when he found she was to be of the party, po∣sitively
declared the match to be out of all question.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now stood aghast. Many had been his
disappointments; his rage for forming schemes, and
his credulity in persuading himse they would be suc∣cessful,
were sources not more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertile of amusement
in their projection, than of mortification in their
event: but here, the length of time since his plan had
been arranged, joined to the very superficial view he
had taken of any chance of its failure, had made him,
by degrees, regard it as so fixed and settled, that it
<PB N="330" REF="131"/>
rather demanded congratulation than concurrence,
rather waited to be enjoyed than executed.</P>
<P>Lynmere took not the smallest interest in the dis∣may
of his uncle, but, turning upon his heel, said
he would go to the stables, to see if he could find
something that would carry him any better than the
miserable jade he had mounted the preceding even∣ing.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh remained in a kind of stupefaction. He
seemed to himself to be bereft of every purpose of
life; and robbed at once, of all view for his actions,
all subject for his thoughts. The wide world, he be∣lieved,
had never, hitherto, given birth to a plan so
saga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iously conceived, so rationally combined, so in∣sallibly
secure: yet it was fallen, crushed, rejected!</P>
<P>A gleam of sunshine, however, ere long, emitted
upon his despondence; it occurred to him, that the
learned education of Eugenia was still a secret to her
cousin; his whole scheme, therefore, might perhaps
yet be retrieved, when Lynmere should be informed
of the peculiar preparations made for his conjugal
happiness.</P>
<P>Fetching now a long breath, to aid the revival of
his faculties and his spirits, he considered how to open
his discourse so as to render it most impressive, and
then sent for Clermont to attend him in his chamber.</P>
<P>“Nephew,” cried he, upon his entrance, “I am
now going to talk to you a little in your own way,
having something to tell you of, that, I believe, you
won't know how to hold cheap, being a thing that
belongs to your studies; that is to say, to your cou∣sin's;
which, I hope, is pretty much the same thing,
at least as to the end. Now the case of what I have to
say is this; you must know, nephew, I had always
fet my heart upon having a rich heir; but it's what
did not turn out, which I am sorry enough for;
but where's the man that's so wise as to know his
own doom? that is, the doom of his fortune. How∣ever,
that's what I should not talk of to you, ha∣ving
so little; which, I hope, you won't take to
heart. And, indeed, it in't much worth a wise
<PB N="331" REF="132"/>
man's thinking of, when he han't got it, for what's a
fortune, at bottom, but mere metal? And so having,
as I said before, no heir, I'm forced, in default of it,
to take up with an heiress. But, to the end of ma∣king
all parties happy, I've had her brought up in the
style of a boy, for the sake of your marrying her.
For which reason, I believe, in point of the classics”—</P>
<P>“Me, sir!” cried Lynmere, recovering from a long
yawning fit, “and what have I to do with marrying
a girl like a boy? That's not my taste, my dear sir,
I assure you. Besides, what has a wife to do with the
classics? will they show her how to order her table?
I suppose when I want to eat, I may go to a cook's
shop!”</P>
<P>Here subsided, at once, every particle of that re∣verence
Sir Hugh had so long nourished for Clermont
Lynmere. To hear the classics spoken of with disre∣spect,
after all the pains he had taken, all the orders
he had given for their exclusive study and veneration,
and to find the common calls of life, which he had be∣lieved
every scholar regarded but as means of existence,
not auxiliaries of happiness, named with preference,
distanced, at a stroke, all high opinion of his nephew,
and made way, in its stead, for a displeasure not
wholly free from disdain.</P>
<P>“Well, Clermont,” said he, after a pause, “I
won't keep you any longer, now I know your mind,
which I wish I had known before, for the account of
your cousin, who has had plague enough about it in
her bringing up; which, however, I shall put an end
to now, not seeing that any good has come from it.”</P>
<P>Lynmere joyfully accepted the permission to retire,
enchanted that the rejection was thus completely off
his mind, and had incurred only so slight a reproof,
unaccompanied with one menace, or even remon∣strance.</P>
<P>The first consternation of Sir Hugh, at the fall of
this favourite project, was, indeed, somewhat lessened,
at this moment, by the fall of his respectful opinion
of its principal object. He sent therefore, hastily,
for Eugenia, to whom he abruptly exclaimed, “My
<PB N="332" REF="133"/>
dear girl, who'd have thought it? here's your cousin
Clermont, with all his Greek and Latin, which I be∣gin
to bless God I don't know a word of, turning out
a mere common nothing, thinking about his dinners
and suppers! for which reason I beg you'll think of
him no more, it not being worth your while; in par∣ticular,
as he don't desire it.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, at this intimation, felt nearly as much re∣lieved
as disturbed. To be refused was, indeed,
shocking; not to her pride, she was a stranger to
that passion; but to her delicacy, which pointed out
to her, in strong colours, the impropriety of having
been exposed to such a decision: nevertheless, to find
herself unshackled from an alliance to which she look∣ed
forward with dread, without offending her uncle,
to whom so many reasons made it dear, or militating
against her own heroic sentiments of generosity, which
revolted against wilfully depriving her cousin of an in∣heritance
already offered to him, removed a weight
from her mind, which his every word, look, and ges∣ture,
had contributed to increase since their first meet∣ing.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont had ridden to Beech Park, where
he had spent the night, though univited by its agita∣ted
owner, whom the very name of Mrs Berlinton,
annexed to an accepted party of pleasure, had driven,
in speechless agony, from Cleves.</P>
<P>“I wonder not,” cried he▪ “at your disturbance;
I feel for it, on the contrary, more than ever, from
my observations of this evening; for I now see the
charm, the potent charm, as well as the difficulties of
your situation. This strange affair with Sir Sedley
Clarendel cannot, in common foresight of what may
ensue from it, be passed over without the most rigid
scrutiny, and severest deliberation; yet, I sincerely
hope, inquiry may produce some palliation: this young
lady, I see, will not easily, for sweetness, for counte∣nance,
for every apparent attraction, be replaced:
and, the first of all requisites is certainly in your fa∣vour;
<PB N="333" REF="134"/>
it is evident she loves you.”</P>
<P>“Loves me?” cried Edgar, his arms involuntarily
encircling him as he repeated the magnetising words:
“Ah! Dr. Marchmont, could she then thus grieve
and defy me?—And yet, so too said Jacob,—that
good, faithful, excellent old servant”—</P>
<P>“Yes; I watched her unremittingly; and saw
her so much hurt by your abrupt retreat, that her
eyes filled with rears the moment you left the room.”</P>
<P>“O, Dr. Marchmont!—and for me were they
shed?—my dear—dear friend!—withhold from me
such a picture—or reconcile me completely to viewing
no other!”</P>
<P>“Once more, let me warn you to circumspection.
The stake for which you are playing is life in its best
part, 'tis peace of mind. That her manners are en∣gaging,
that her looks are captivating, and even that
her heart is yours, admit no doubt: but the solidity or
the lightness of that heart are yet to be proved.”</P>
<P>“Still, Doctor, though nearly in defiance of all
my senses, still I can doubt any thing rather than
the heart of Camilla! Precipitate, I know, she has
always been reckoned; but her precipitance is of
kin to her noblest virtues; it springs but from the
unsuspicious srankness of an unguarded, because in∣nocent
nature. And this, in a short time, her un∣derstanding
will correct.”</P>
<P>“Are you sure it is adequate to the task? There
is often, in early youth, a quickness of parts which
raises expectations that are never realised. Their
origin is but in the animal spirits, which, instead of
ripening into judgment and sense by added years,
dwindle into nothingness, or harden into flippancy.
The character, at this period, is often so unstable,
as to be completely new moulded by every new ac∣cident,
or new associate. How innumerable are the
lurking ill qualities that may lie dormant beneath
the smiles of youth and beauty, in the season of their
untried serenity! The contemporaries of half our
fiercest viragos of fifty, may assure you that, at fif∣teen,
they were all softness and sweetness. The
<PB N="334" REF="135"/>
present aera, however, my dear young friend, is high∣ly
favourable to all you can judiciously wish; namely,
the entire re-establishment, or total destruction of all
confidence.—To a man of your nice feelings, there is
no medium. Your love demands respect, or your
tranquillity exacts flight from its object. Set apart
your offence at the cultivation of an acquaintance
you disapprove; be yourself of the party to South∣ampton,
and there, a very little observation will ena∣ble
you to dive into the most secret recesses of her
character”</P>
<P>“Steadiness, Doctor, I do not want, nor yet, how∣ever
I suffer from its exertion, fortitude: but a plan
such as this, requires something more; it calls for an
equivocal conduct, which, to me, would be impracti∣cable,
and to her, might prove delusive. No!—the
openness I so much pine to meet with, I must, at least,
not forfeit myself.”</P>
<P>“The fervour of your integrity, my dear Mandle∣bert,
mistakes caution for deceit. If, indeed, this
plan had any other view than your union, it would
not merely be cruel, but infamous: the truth, how∣ever,
is, you must either pursue her upon proof, or
abandon her at once, with every chance of repenting
such a measure.”</P>
<P>“Alas! how torturing is hefitation! to believe
myself the object of her regard—to think that first
of all human felicities mine, yet to find it so pli∣ant—
so precarious—to see her, with such thought∣less
readiness, upon the point of falling into the hands
of another!—receiving—answering—his letters!—
letters too so confident, so daring! made up of inso∣lent
demands and imperious reproaches—to meet him
by his own appointment—O, Dr. Marchmont! all
delicious as is the idea of her preference—all en∣twined
as she is around my soul, how, now, how
ever again, can I be happy, either to quit—or to
claim her?—”</P>
<P>“This division of sentiment is what gives rise to my
plan. At Southampton, you will see if Sir Sedley
pursues her; and, as she will be uncertain of your
<PB N="335" REF="136"/>
intentions, you will be enabled to judge the singleness
of her mind, and the stability of her affection by the
reception she gives him.”</P>
<P>“But if—as I think I can gather from her deliver∣ing
me his letters, the affair, whatever it has been,
with Sir Sedley, is over▪—What then?”</P>
<P>“You will have leisure to discuss it; and oppor∣tunity,
also, to see her with other Sir Sedleys. Pub∣lic
places abound with those flutterers after youth and
beauty; unmeaning admirers, who sigh at every new
face; or black traitors to society, who seek but to
try, and try but to publish their own power of con∣quest”</P>
<P>“Will you, then, my dear Doctor, be also of the
party? for my sake, will you, once more, quit your
studies and repose, to give me, upon the spot, your
counsel, according to the va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying exigence of vary∣ing
circumstances? to aid me to prepare and compose
my mind for whatever may be the event, and to guide
even, if possible, my wavering and distracted thoughts.”</P>
<P>To the importance of the period, and to a plea so
serious, every obstacle yielded, and Dr. Marchmont
agreed to accompany him to Southampton.</P>

he'd put it all down, clear as a pike staff, to save
time.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh had not heard of it.”</P>
<P>“Why, then, if you please, sir, we'll go and ask
that elderly gentlewoman, what she's done with it.
She might as well have shewed it, after the young
gentleman's taking the trouble to write it to her. But
she is none of the good naturedest I take it.”</P>
<P>Repairing, then, to Miss Margland, after his usual
bows to all the company, “I ask pardon, ma'am,” he
cried; “but pray, what's the reason of your keeping
the young gentleman's letter to yourself, which was
writ o'purpose to let the old gentleman know what I
come for?”</P>
<P>“Because I never trouble myself with any thing
that's impertinent;” she haughtily answered: though,
in fact, when the family had retired, she had stolen
down stairs, and read the letter; which contained a
warm recommendation of Mr. Dubster to her favour,
with abundant flippant offers to promote her own in∣terest
for so desirable a match, should Camilla prove
blind to its advantages. This she had then burnt,
with a determination never to acknowledge her con∣descension
in opening it.</P>
<P>The repeated calls of Mr. Dubster procuring no
further satisfaction; “Why, then, I don't see.” he
said, “but what I'm as bad off, as if the young gen∣tleman
had not writ the letter, for I've got to speak
for myself at last.”</P>
<P>Taking Sir Hugh, then, by a button of his coat,
he desired he would go back with him to the other
parlour: and there, with much circumlocution, and
unqualified declarations of his having given over all
thoughts of further marrying, till the young gentle∣man
over persuaded him of his being particular agree∣able
to the young lady, he solemnly proposed himself
for Miss Camilla Tyrold.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who perceived in this address nothing
that was ridiculous, was somewhat drawn from re∣flecting
on his own disappointment, by the pity he con∣ceived
<PB N="337" REF="138"/>
for this hopeless suitor, to whom, with equal
circumlocution of concern, he communicated, that his
niece was on the point of marriage with a neighbour.</P>
<P>“I know that,” replied Mr. Dubster, nodding sa∣gaciously,
“the young gentleman having told me of
the young baronight; but he said, it was all against
her will, being only your over teasing, and the like.”</P>
<P>“The Lord be good unto me!” exclaimed the ba∣ronet,
holding up his hands; “if I don't think all
the young boys have a mind to drive me out of my
wits, one after t'other.”</P>
<P>Hurrying, then, back to the breakfast parlour,
and to Camilla, “Come hither, my dear,” he cried,
“for here's a gentleman come to make his addresses
to you, that won't take an answer.”</P>
<P>Every serious thought, and every melancholy ap∣prehension
in Camilla gave place, at this speech, to
the ludicrous machinations of Lionel. She took Sir
Hugh by the hand, and, drawing him away to the
most distant window, said, in a low voice “My dear
uncle, this is a mere trick of Lionel; the person you
see here is, I believe, a tinker.”</P>
<P>“A tinker!” repeated Sir Hugh, quite loud, in
defiance of the signs and hists! hists! of Camilla,
“good lack! that's a person I should never have
thought of!” Then walking up to Mr. Dubster, who
was taking into his hands all the ornaments from the
chimney-piece, one by one, to examine, “Sir,” he
said, “you may be a very good sort of man, and I
don't doubt but you are, for I've a proper respect for
every trade in its way; but in point of marrying my
niece, it's a thing I must beg you to put out of your
head; it not being a proper subject to talk of to a
young lady, from a person in that line.”</P>
<P>“Very well, sir,” answered Mr. Dubster, stiffly,
and pouting, “it's not of much consequence; don't
make yourself uneasy. There's nothing in what I
was going to propose but what was quite genteel. I'd
scorn to address a lady else. She'd have a good five
hundred a-year, in case of outliving me.”</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="139"/>
“Good lack! five hundred a year! who'd have
thought of such a thing by the tinkering business?”</P>
<P>“The what business, did you say, sir?” cried
Mr. Dubster, strutting up to the baronet, with a so∣lemn
frown.</P>
<P>“The tinkering business, my good friend. An't
you a tinker?”</P>
<P>“Sir!” cried Mr. Dubster, swelling, “I did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot
think, when I was coming to make such a handsome
offer, of being affronted at such a rate as this. Not
that I mind it. It's not worth fretting about. How∣ever,
as to a tinker, I'm no more a tinker than your∣self,
whatever put it in your head.”</P>
<P>“Good lack, my dear,” cried the baronet, to Ca∣milla,
“the gentleman quite denies it.”</P>
<P>Camilla, though unable to refrain from laughing,
confessed she had received the information from Mrs.
Arlbery at the Northwick breakfast, who, she now
supposed, had said it in random sport.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh cordially begged his pardon, and asked
him to take a seat at the breakfast table, to soften the
undesigned offence.</P>
<P>A note now arrived from Mr. Tyrold to the ba∣ronet.
It contained his consent to return, with La∣vinia,
to Cleves, and his ready acquiescence in the
little excursion to Southampton, since Miss Margland
would be superintendant of the party; “and since,”
he added, “they will have another guardian, to whom
already I consign my Camilla, and, upon her account,
my dear Eugenia also, with the same fearless confidence
I should feel in seeing them again under the mater∣nal
wing.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who always read his letters aloud, said,
when he had done: “See what it is to be a good boy!
my brother looks upon young Mr. Edgar as these young
girls' husband already; that is, of one of them; by
which means the other becomes his sister; which, I'm
sure, is a trouble he won't mind, except as a pleasure.”</P>
<P>Camilla's distress at this speech passed unnoticed,
from the abrupt entrance of Lynmere, giving orders
aloud to his servant to get ready for Southampton.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="140"/>
Inflamed with triumph in his recent success in baf∣fling
his uncle, that youth was in the most turbulent
spirits, and fixed a resolution either to lord it over the
whole house, or regain at once his liberty for return∣ing
to the Continent.</P>
<P>Forcing a chair between Sir Hugh and Camilla, he
seized rapidly whatever looked most inviting from
every plate on the table, to place upon his own, mur∣muring
the whole time against the horses, declaring
the stud the most wretched he had ever seen, and pro∣testing
the old groom must be turned away without
loss of time.</P>
<P>“What, Jacob?” cried the baronet; “why, ne∣phew,
he has lived with me from a boy: and now he's
grown old, I'd▪ sooner rub down every horse with my
own hand, than part with him.”</P>
<P>“He must certainly go, sir. There's no keeping
him. I may be tempted else to knock his brains out
some day. Besides, I have a very good fellow I can
recommend to you of my own.”</P>
<P>“Clermont, I've no doubt of his being a
good fellow, which I'm very glad of; but as to
your always knocking out the brains of my servants,
it's a thing I must beg you not to talk of any more,
being against the law. Besides which, it don't
sound very kind of you, considering their having done
you no harm; never having seen your face, as one
may say, except just to wait upon you; which can
hardly be reckoned a bad office; besides a servant's
being a man, as well as you; whether Homer and
Horace tell you so or no.”</P>
<P>To see Sir Hugh displeased, was a sight new to the
whole house. Camilla and Eugenia, mutually pained
for him, endeavoured, by various little kind offices,
to divert his attention; but Indiana thought his dis∣pleasure
proved her brother to be a wit; and Clermont
rose in spirits and in insolence upon the same idea: too
shallow to know, that of all the qualities with which
the perversity of human nature is gifted, the power
which is the most common to attain, and the most
easy to practise, is the art of provoking.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="141"/>
Jacob now appearing, Lynmere ordered some
shrimps.</P>
<P>There were none.</P>
<P>“No shrimps? There's nothing to be had! 'Tis
a wretched county this.!”</P>
<P>“You'll get nice shrimps at Southampton, sir, by
what I can hear,” said Mr. Dubster. “Tom Hicks says
he has been sick with 'em many a day, he's eat such
a heap. They gets 'em by hundreds, and hundreds,
and hundreds at a time.”</P>
<P>“Pray, nephew how long shall you stay? because
of my nieces coming back at the same time.”</P>
<P>“A fortnight's enough to tire me any where, sir.
Pray what do you all do with yourselves here after
breakfast? What's your mode?”</P>
<P>“Mode, nephew? we've got no particular mode
that ever I heard of. However, among so many of us,
I think it's a little hard, if you can find nothing to
say to us; all in a manner, your relations too.”</P>
<P>“We take no notice of relations now, sir; that's
out.”</P>
<P>“I'm sorry for it, nephew, for a relation's a relation,
whether you take notice of him or not. And there's
ne'er an ode in Virgil will tell you to the contrary,
as I believe.”</P>
<P>A short silence now ensued, which was broken by
a sigh from Sir Hugh, who ejaculated to himself,
though aloud, “I can't but think what my poor friend
Westwyn will do, if his son's came home in this man∣ner!
caring for nobody, but an oyster, or a shrimp;
—unless it's a newspaper!”</P>
<P>“And what should a man care for else, my good
old friend, in a desart place such as this?”</P>
<P>“Good old friend!” repeated the baronet; “to
be sure, I'm not very young▪—However, as to that—
but you mean no harm, I know, for which reason I
can't be so ill-natured as to take it ill. However, if
poor Westwyn is served in this—way—He's my dear∣est
friend that I've got, out of us all here, of my own
kin, and he's got only one son, and he sent him to
foreign parts only for cheapness; and if he should
<PB N="341" REF="142"/>
happen to like nothing he can get at home, it won't
answer much in saving, to send out for things all day
long.”</P>
<P>“O don't be troubled, sir; Westwyn's but a poor
creature, He'll take up with any thing. He live
within his allowance the whole time. A mighty poor
creature.”</P>
<P>“I'm glad of it! glad of it indeed!” cried Sir
Hugh, with involuntary eagerness; “I should have
been sorry if my poor good old friend had had such
disappointment.”</P>
<P>“Upon my honour,” cried Lynmere, piqued, “the
quoz of the present season are beyond what a man
could have hoped to see!”</P>
<P>“Quoz! what's quoz, nephew?”</P>
<P>“Why, it's a thing there's no explaining to you sort
of gentlemen; and sometimes we say quiz; my good
old sir.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, now, f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r almost the first time in his life,
felt seriously affronted. His utmost lenity could not
palliate the wilful disrespect of this language; and,
with a look of grave displeasure, he answered, “Re∣ally,
nephew, I can't but say, I think you've got rather
a particular odd way of speaking to persons. As to
talking so much about people's being old, you'd do
well to consider that's no fault in any body; except
one's years, which is what we can't be said to help.”</P>
<P>“You descant too much upon words, sir; we have
left off, now, using them with such prodigious precision.
It's quite over, fir.”</P>
<P>“O, my dear Clermont!” cried Sir Hugh, losing
his short movement of anger in a more tender sen∣sation
of concern, “how it goes to my heart to see
you turn out such a jackanapes!”</P>
<P>Lynmere, resentfully hanging back, said no more:
and Mr. Dubster, having drunk seven dishes of tea,
with a long apology between each for the trouble,
gladly seized the moment of pause, to ask Camilia
when she had heard from <HI>their friend Mrs. Mittin,</HI>
adding, “I should have brought you a letter from
her, ma'am, myself, but that I was rather out of sorts
<PB N="342" REF="143"/>
with her; for happening to meet her, the day as you
went, walking on them Pantiles, with some of her
quality binding, when I was not dressed out quite in
my best becomes, she made as if she did not know me.
Not as it signifies. It's pretty much of a muchness
to me. I remember her another sort of person to what
she looks now, before I was a gentleman myself.”</P>
<P>“Why, pray, what was you then, sir?” cried Sir
Hugh, with great simplicity.</P>
<P>“As to that, sir, there's no need to say whether I
was one thing or another, as I know of; I'm not in
the least ashamed of what I was.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh seeing him offended, was beginning an
apology; but, interrupting him, “No, sir, “he said,
“there's no need to say nothing about it. It's not a
thing to take much to heart. I've been defamed often
enough, I hope, to be above minding it. Only just
this one thing, sir; I beg I may have the savour to
be introduced to that lady as had the obligingness to
call me a tinker, when I never was no such thing.”</P>
<P>Breakfast now being done, the ladies retired to pre∣pare
for their journey.</P>
<P>“Well,” cried Mr. Dubster, looking after Euge∣niat
“that little lady will make no great figure at
such a place as Southton. I would not have her look
out for a husband there.”</P>
<P>“She'd have been just the thing for me!” cried
Lynmere, haughtily rising, and conceitedly parading
his fine form up and down the room; hi seyes catching
it from looking-glass, to looking glass; by every possible
contrivance; “just the thing matched to perfection!”</P>
<P>“Lord help me! if I don't find myself in the dark
about every thing'” cried Sir Hugh; “who'd have
thought of you scholars thinking so much of beauty; I
should be glad to know what your classics say to that
point?”</P>
<P>“Faith, my good sir, I never trouble myself to
ask. From the time we begin our tours, we wipe
away all that stuff as fast as possible from our thoughts.”</P>
<P>“Why, pray, nephew, what harm could it do to
your tours?”</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="144"/>
“We want room, sir, room in the pericranium!
As soon as we being to travel, we give up every thing
to taste. And then we want clear heads. Clear
heads, sir, for pictures, statues, busts, alto relievos,
basso relievos, tablets, monuments, mausoleums”—</P>
<P>“If you go on at that rate, nephew,” interrupted
Sir Hugh, holding his ears, “you'll put my poor head
quite into a whirligig. And it's none of the deepest
already, Lord help me!”</P>
<P>Lynmere now, without ceremony, made off; and
Mr. Dubster, left alone with the baronet, said they
might as well proceed to business. “So pray, sir, if I
may make bold, in the case we come to a right un∣derstanding
about the young lady, what do you pro∣pose
to give her down?”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, staring, inquired what he meant:</P>
<P>“Why, I mean, sir, what shall you give her at the
first? I know she's to have it all at your demise;
but that i'n't the bird in the hand▪ Now, when once
I know that, I can make my offers, which shall be
handsome or not, according. And that's but fair.
So how much can you part with, sir?”</P>
<P>“Not a Guinea!” cried Sir Hugh, with some
emotion; “I can't give her any thing! Mr. Edgar
knows that.”</P>
<P>“That's hard, indeed, sir. What nothing for
a setting out? And, pray, sir, what may the sum
total be upon your demise?”</P>
<P>“Not a penny!” cried Sir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hugh, with still more
agitation: “Don't you know I've disinherited her?”.</P>
<P>“Disinherited her? why this is bad news enough!
And pray, sir, what for?”</P>
<P>“Nothing! She never offended me in thought, word,
nor deed,!</P>
<P>“Well, that's odd enough. And when did you do
it, sir?”</P>
<P>“The very week she was nine years old, poor
thing! which I shall never forget as long as I live,
being my worst action.”</P>
<P>“Well, this is particular enough! And young
'squire Tyrold's never heard a word of it: which is
somewhat of a wonder too.”</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="145"/>
“Not heard of it? why the whole family know it!
I've settled every thing I was worth in the world
upon her younger sister, that you saw sitting by her.”</P>
<P>“Well, if Tom Hicks did not as good as tell me
so ever so long ago, though the young 'squire said it
was all to the contrary: what for, I don't know;
unless to take me in. But he won't find that quite so
easy, asking his pardon. Matrimony's a good thing
enough, when it's to help a man forward: but a per∣son
must be a fool indeed, to put himself out of his
way for nothing.”</P>
<P>He then formally wished the baronet a good day,
and hastened from the house, puffed up with vain
glory, at his own sagacious precautions, which had
thus happily saved him from being tricked into un∣profitable
wedlock.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton now arrived, and as Camilla was
ready, though trembling, doubtful, apprehensive of the
step she was taking, declined alighting. A general
meeting was to take place at the inn: and the baroner,
putting a twenty pound note into her hand, with the
most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender blessings parted with his darling niece.
And then, surprised at not seeing Edgar to breakfast,
sent his butler to tell him the history of the excursion.</P>
<P>Lynmere was already set off on horseback: and
the party, consisting of Dr. Orkborne, Miss Margland,
Indiana, and Eugenia, followed two hours after, in
the coach of the baronet, which drove from the park as
the chaise entered it with Mr. Tyrold and Lavinia,
to supply their places.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Way to make friends.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Camilla appeared at the halldoor, a gen∣tleman
descended from the carriage of Mrs. Berlin∣ton,
with an air the most melancholy, and eyes bent
to the earth, in the mournful bow with which he
offered her his hand: though, when he had assisted
her into the coach, he raised them, and, turning round,
cast upon the mansion a look of desponding fondness,
that immediately brought to her recollection young
Melmond, the Oxford student, and the brother of her
new friend.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton received her with tenderness, folding
her to her breast, and declaring life to be now insuppor∣table
without her.</P>
<P>The affection of Camilla was nearly reciprocal, but
her pleasure had no chance of equal participation;
nor was the suspensive state of her mind the only im∣pediment;
opposite to her in the carriage, and imme∣diately
claiming her attention, was Mrs. Mittin.</P>
<P>The agitative events which had filled up the short
interval of her residence at Cleves, had so completely
occupied every faculty, that, till the affair of the horse
involved her in new difficulties, her debts had entire∣ly
flown her remembrance; and the distressing scenes
which immediately succeeded to that forced recollec∣tion,
made its duration as short as it was irksome; but
the sight of Mrs. Mirtin brought it back with violence
to her memory; and flashed it, with shame, upon her
conscience.</P>
<P>The twenty pounds, however, just given her by Sir
Hugh, occurred at the same moment to her thoughts;
and she determined to repair her negligence, by appro∣priating
it into parcels for the payment of all she
owed, before she suffered sleep again to dose her eyes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton informed her, that both herself and
<PB N="346" REF="147"/>
her brother had been summoned to Southampton to
meet Mrs Ecton, the aunt by whom she had been
educated, who had just arrived there from Wales,
upon some secret business, necessary for her to hear,
but which could not be revealed by letters.</P>
<P>The journey, though in itself short and pleasant,
proved to Camilla long and wearisome; the beauties
of the prospect were acknowledged by her eye, but her
mind, dead to pleasure, refused to give them their
merited effect. To the charms of nature she could
not be blind; her fervent imagination, and the lessons
of her youth, combined to do them justice; but she
thought not of them at this moment; hill, vale, or
plain, were uninteresting, however beautiful; it was
Edgar she looked for; Edgar, who thus coldly had
suffered her to depart, but who still, it was possible,
might pursue; and hope, ever active, painted him,
as she proceeded, in every distant object that caught
her eye, whether living or inanimate, brightening,
from time to time, the roses of her cheeks with the
felicity of a speedy reconciliation; but upon every
near approach, the flattering error was detected, and
neither hill, vale, nor plain, could dispel the disap∣pointment.
A fine country, and diversified views, may
soften even the keenest affliction of decided misfortune,
and tranquilise the most gloomy sadness into resignation
and composure; but suspense rejects the gentle
palliative; 'tis an absorbent of the faculties that suffers
them to see, hear, and feel only its own perplexity;
and the finer the fibres of the sensibility on which it
seizes, the more exclusive is its depotism; doubt, in
a fervent mind, from the rapidity of its evolutions be∣tween
fear in its utmost despondence, and hope in its
fullest rapture, is little short of torture.</P>
<P>They drove immediately to an elegant house, situ∣ated
upon a small eminence, half a mile without the
town of Southampton, which had already been secu∣red;
and Mrs. Berlinton, as soon as she had choser,
the pleasantest apartment it afforded for Camilla, and
suffered Mrs. Mittin to choose the next pleasant for
herself, went, accompanied by her brother, to the lod∣ging
of Mrs. Ecton.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="148"/>
Left alone, Camilla stationed herself down, at a win-believing
she meant to look at the prospect; but her
eye, faithful to her heart, roved up and down the high
road, and took in only chaises or horsemen, till Mrs.
Mittin, with her customary familiarity, came into the
room. “Well my dear miss,” she cried, “you're
welcome to Southampton, and welcome to Mrs. Ber∣linton,
she's a nice lady as ever I knew; I suppose
you're surprised to see us so great together? but I'll
tell you how it came about. You must know, just
as you was gone, I happened to be in the book shop
when she came in, and asked for a book; the Peruvan
Letters she called it; and it was not at home, and
she looked quite vexed, for she said she had looked
the catalogue up and down and saw nothing
else she'd a mind to; so I thought it would be a
good opportunity to oblige her, and be a way to make
a prodigious genteel acquaintance besides; so I took
down the name, and I found out the lady that had got
the book, and I made her a visit, and I told her it
was particular wanted by a lady that had a reason;
so she let me have it, and I took it to my pretty lady,
who was so pleased, she did not know how to thank
me: So this got me footing in the house; and there
I heard, amongst her people, she was coming to South∣ampton,
and was to call for you, my dear miss; so
when I found she had not her coach full, I ask'd her
to give me a cast; for I told her you'd be particular
glad to see me, as we'd some business to settle toge∣ther,
that was a secret between only us two; so she
said she would do any thing to give you pleasure; so
then I made free to ask-her to give me a night's lod∣ging▪
till I could find out some friend to be at; for I'd
a vast mind to come to Southampton, as I could do
it so reasonable, for I like to go every where. And I
dare say, my dear miss, if you'll tell her 'twill oblige
you, she'll make me the compliment to let me stay all
the time, for I know nobody here; though I don't fear
making friends, go where I will. And you know,
my dear miss, you can do no less by me, considering
what I've done for you; for I've kept all the good
people quiet about your debts; and they say you may
<PB N="348" REF="149"/>
pay them when you will, as I told them you was such
a rich heiress; which Mr Dubster let me into the
secret of, for he had had it from your brother.”</P>
<P>Camilla now experienced the extremest repentance
and shame, to find herself involved in any obligation
with a character so forward, vulgar, and encroaching,
and to impose such a person, through the abuse of her
name and influence, upon the time and patience of
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>The report spread by Lionel she immediately disa∣vowed,
and, producing her twenty pound bank note
begged Mrs. Mittin would have the goodness to get
it changed for her, and to discharge her accounts
without delay.</P>
<P>Surprised by this readiness; and struck by the view,
of the note, Mrs. Mittin imputed to mere reserve the
denial of her expected wealth, but readily promised to
get in the bills, and see her clear.</P>
<P>Camilla would now have been left alone; but Mrs
Mittin thought of nothing less than quitting her, and
she knew not how to bid her depart. It was uncertain
when Mrs. Berlinton could return; to obviate, there∣fore,
in some measure, the fatigue of such conversation,
Camilla proposed walking</P>
<P>It was still but two o'clock, and the weather was
delicious; every place that opened to any view, pre∣sented
some prospect that was alluring; Camilla, not∣withstanding
her anxiety, was caught, and at intervals,
at least, forgot all within, from admiration of all
without.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin led immediately to the town, and Ca∣milla
was struck with its neatness, and surprised by
its populousness. Mrs. Mittin assured her it was no∣thing
to London, and only wished she could walk her
from Charing-cross to Temple bar, just to shew her
what it was to see a little of the world.</P>
<P>“But now, my dear,” she cried, “the thing is to
find out what we've got to look at; so don't let's go
on without knowing what we're about; however,
these shops are all so monstrous smart, 'twill be a
pleasure to go into them, and ask the good people
what there's to see in the town.”</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="150"/>
This pretext proved so fertile to her of entertain∣ment,
in the opportunity it afforded of taking a near
view of the various commodities exposed to sale, that
while she entered almost every shop, with enquiries
of what was worth seeing, she attended to no answer
nor information, but having examined and admired
all the goods within fight or reach, walked off, to ob∣tain,
by similar means, a similar privilege further on;
boasting to Camilla that, by this clever device they
might see all that was smartest, without the expence
of buying any thing.</P>
<P>It is possible that this might safely have been re∣peated,
from one end of the town to the other, had
Mrs. Mittin been alone; and she seemed well dispo∣sed
to make the experiment; but Camilla, who absent
and absorbed, accompanied without heeding her, was
of a figure and appearance not quite so well adapted
for indulging with impunity such unbridled curiosity.
The shopkeepers, who according to their several tastes
or opinions, gave their directions to the churches, the
quays, the market-place, the antique gates, the
townhall, &amp;c. involuntarily looked at her as they an∣swered
the questioner, and not satisfied with the short
view, followed to the door, to look again; this pre∣sently
produced an effect; that, for the whole length
of the High-street, was amply ridiculous; every one
perceiving that, whatsoever had been his recommen∣dation,
whether to the right, to the left, or straight
forward, the two inquirers went no further than into
the next shop, whence they regularly drew forth either
the master or the man to make another starer at their
singular proceeding.</P>
<P>Some supposed they were only seeking to attract
notice; others thought they were deranged in mind;
and others, again, imagined they were shoplifters, and
hastened back to their counters, to examine what was
mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng of their goods.</P>
<P>Two men of the two last persuasions communicated
to one another their opinions, each sustaining his own
with a positiveness that would have ended in a quar∣rel,
had it not been accommodated by a wager. To
<PB N="350" REF="151"/>
settle this became now so important, that business gave
way to speculation, and the contending parties, accom∣panied
by a young perfumer as arbitrator, leaving their
affairs in the hands of their wives, or their domestics,
issued forth from their repositories, to pursue and watch
the curious travellers; laying bets by the way at al∣most
every shop as they proceeded, till they reached
the quay, where the ladies made a full stand, and their
followers opened a consulatation how best to decide
the contest.</P>
<P>Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who con∣cluded
them to be shoplifters, declared he would keep
aloof, for he should detect them best when they least
suspected they were observed.</P>
<P>Mr. Drim, a genteel and simple haberdasher, who be∣freved
their senses disordered, made a circuit to face and
examine them, frequently however, looking back to see
that no absconding trick was played him by his friends.
When he came up to them, the pensive and absorbed
look of Camilla struck him as too particular to be
natural; and in Mrs. Mittin he immediately fancied
he perceived something wild, if not insane. In truth,
an opinion preconceived of her derangement might
easily authorise strong suspicions of confirmation, from
the contented volubility with which she incessantly
ran on, without waiting for answerers, or even listeners;
and his observation had not taught him, that the
loquacious desire only to speak. They exact time,
not attention.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, soon observing the curiosity with which
he examined them, looked at him so hard in return,
talking the whole time, in a quick low voice, to Camilla
upon his oddity, that, struck with a direful panic, in the
persuasion she was marking him for some mischief, he
he turned short about to get back to his companions;
leaving Mrs. Mittin with precisely the same opinion
of himself which he had imbibed of her.</P>
<P>“Well, my dear,” cried she, “this is one of the
most miraculous-adventures I've met with yet; as sure
as you're alive that man that stares so is not right in the
head! for else what should he run away for, all in such
<PB N="351" REF="152"/>
a hurry, after looking at us so particular for nothing?
I'll assure you, I think the best thing we can do, is to
get off as fast as we can, for fear of the worst.”</P>
<P>They then spread their way from the quay; but, in
turning down the first passage to get out of sight, they
were led into one of the little rooms prepared for the
accommodation of bathers.</P>
<P>This seemed so secure, as well as pleasant, that Ca∣milla,
soothed by the tranquillity with which she could
contemplate the noble Southampton water and its fine
bank<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sat down at the window, and desired not to
walk any further.</P>
<P>The fright with which Mr. Drim had retreated,
gained no proselyte to his opinion; Mr. Girt, the
perfumer, asserted, significantly, they were only idle
travellers, of light character; and Mr. Firl, when in
dodging them, he saw they went into a bathing toom,
offered to double his wager that it was to make some
assortment of their spoil.</P>
<P>This was accepted, and it was agreed that one
should saunter in the adjoining passages to see which
way they turned upon coming out, while the two
others should patrole the beach, to watch their dis∣appearance
from the windows.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, meanwhile, was as much amused,
though with different objects, as Camilla. A large
mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered
a vessel for sailing down the water, which was not
yet ready, now made their appearance; and their
dress, their air of enjoyment, their outcries of im∣patience,
the frisky gaiety of some, the noisy merriment
of others, seemed to Mrs. Mittin marks of so much
grandeur and happiness, that all her thoughts were at
work to devise some contrivance for becoming of their
acquaintance.</P>
<P>Camilla also surveyed, but almost without seeing
them; for the only image of her mind now unex∣pectedly
met her view; Dr. Marchmont and Edgar,
just arrived, had patrolled to the beach, where Edgar,
whose eye, from his eagerness, appeared to be every
where in a moment, immediately perceived her; they
<PB N="352" REF="153"/>
both bowed, and Dr. Marchmont, amazed by the
air and figure of her companion, inquired if Mrs.
Berlinton had any particularly vulgar relation to whom
she was likely to commit her fair guest.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had seen only herself, could not now
forbear another glance; but the aspect of Mrs. Mittin,
without Mrs. Berlinton, or any other more dignified
or fitting protectress, was both unaccountable and
unpleasant to him; he recollected having seen her at
Tunbridge, where the careless temper, and negligent
manners of Mrs. Arlbery, made all approaches easy,
that answered any purpose of amusement or ridicule;
but he could not conceive how Mrs. Berlinton, or
Camilla herself, could be joined by such a companion.</P>
<P>Mr. Firl, having remarked these two gentlemen's
bows, began to fear for his wager; yet thinking it
authorised him to seek some information, approached
them, and taking off his hat, said: “You seem to be
noticing those two ladies up▪ there; pay, gentlemen,
if you've no objection, who may they be?”</P>
<P>“Why do you ask, Sir?” cried Edgar, sternly.</P>
<P>“Why, we've a wager depending upon them, sir,
and I believe there's no gentleman will refuse to help
another about a wager.”</P>
<P>“A wager?” repeated Edgar, wishing, but vainly,
to manifest no curiosity; “what inducement could
you have to lay a wager about them?”</P>
<P>“Why, I believe, sir, there's nobody's a better judge
than me what I've laid about; though I may be out,
to be sure, if you know the ladies; but I've seen
so much of their tricks, in my time, that they must be
pretty sharp before they'll over-reach me”</P>
<P>“What tricks? who must be sharp?
who are you taking of?</P>
<P>“Shoplifters, sir.”</P>
<P>“Shoplifters! what do you mean?”</P>
<P>“No harm, sir; I may be out, to be sure, as I say;
and if so, I ask pardon; only, as we've laid the wager,
I think I may speak before I pay.”</P>
<P>The curiosity of Edgar would have been con∣verted
into ridicule, had he been less uneasy
<PB N="353" REF="154"/>
at seeing with whom Camilla was thus associ∣ated;
Mrs. Mittin might certainly be a worthy wo∣man,
and, if so, must merit every kindness that could
be shewn her; but her air and manner so strongly dis∣played
the low bred society to which she had been
accustomed, that he foresaw nothing but improper
acquaintance, or demeaning adventures, that could
ensue from such a connection at a public pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont demanded what had given rise to
this suspicion.</P>
<P>Mr. Firl answered, that they had been into every
shop in the town, routing over every body's b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st good<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
yet not laying out a penny.</P>
<P>Nothing of this could Edgar comprehend, except
that Camilla had suffered herself to be led about by
Mrs. Mittin, entirely at her pleasure; but all further
inquiry was stopt, by the voluntary and pert junction
of Girt, the young perfumer, who, during this period,
had by no means been idle; for perceiving, in the
group wai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing for a vessel, a certain customer b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom
he knew such a subject would be well received, he
contrived to excite his curiosity to ask some questions,
which could only be satisfied by the history of the
wager, and his own opinion that both parties were out.</P>
<P>This drew all eyes to the bathing room; and new
bets soon were circulated, consisting of every descrip∣tion
of conjecture, or even possibility, except that the
two objects in question were innocent: and for that,
in a set of fourteen, one only was found who defend∣ed
Camilla, though her face seemed the very index
of purity, which still more strongly was painted upon
it than beauty, or even than youth. Such is the pre∣valent
disposition to believe in general depravity, that
while those who are debased themselves find a conso∣lation
in thinking others-equally worthless, those even
who are of a better sort, nourish a secret vanity in sup∣posing
few as good as themselves; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully, without
reflection, the fair candour of their minds, by aiding
that infiduous degeneracy, which robs the community
of all confidence in virtue.</P>
<P>The approach of the perfumer to Edgar had all the
hardiness of vulgar elation, bestowed, at this moment.
<PB N="354" REF="155"/>
by the recent encouragement of having been permitted
to propagate his facetious opinions in a society of gen∣tlefolks;
for though to one only amongst them, a
young man of large fortune, by whom he was parti∣cularly
patronifed, he had presumed verbally to ad∣dress
himself, he had yet the pleasure to hear his ac∣count
repeated from one to another, till not a person
of the company escaped hearing it.</P>
<P>“My friend Firl's been telling you, I suppose, sir,”
said he, to Edgar, “of his foolish wager? but, take
my word for it—”</P>
<P>Here Edgar, who again had irresistibly looked up
at the room, saw that three gentlemen had entered it;
alarmed lest these surmises should be productive of im∣pertinence
to Camilla, he darted quick from the beach
to her immediate protection.</P>
<P>But the rapidity of his wishes were ill seconded by
the uncertainty of his footsteps; and while, with eyes
eagerly wandering all around, he hastily pushed for∣ward,
he was stopt by Mr. Drim, who told him to take
care how he went on, for, in one of those bathing hou∣ses,
to the best of his belief, there were two crazy
women, one melancholy, and one stark wild, that had
just, as he supposed, escaped from their keepers.</P>
<P>“How shall I find my way, then, to another of the
bathing houses?” cried Edgar.</P>
<P>Mr. Drim undertook to shew him where he might
turn, but said he must not lose sight of the door, be∣cause
he had a bottle of port depending upon it; his
neighbour, Mr. Firl, insisting they were only shop∣lifters.</P>
<P>Edgar here stopt short and stared.</P>
<P>Drim then assured him it was what he could not be∣lieve,
as nothing was missing; though Mr. Firl would
have it that it was days and days, sometimes, before
people fou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out what was gone; but he was sure,
himself, they were touched in the head, by their going
about so wild, asking every body the same questions,
and minding nobody's answers.</P>
<P>Edgar, convinced now Camilla was here again
implicated, broke with disgust from the man, and
rushed to the door he charged him to avoid.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Rage of Obliging.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA, from the instant she had perceived Ed∣gar,
had been in the utmost emotion, from doubt if his
journey were to seek a reconciliation, or only to return
her letters, and take a lasting farewel. Her first feeling
at his sight urged her to retire: but something of a
softer nature speedily interfered, representing, if now
he should join her, what suffering might mutually be
saved by an immediate conference. She kept, there∣fore
her seat, looking steadily straight down the wa∣ter,
and denying herself one moment's glance at any
thing, or person, upon the beach: little imagining she
ingrossed, herself, the attention of all who paraded
it. But, when the insinuations of the flippant perfu∣mer
had once made her looked at, her beauty, her ap∣parently
unprotected situation, and the account of the
wager, seemed to render her an object to be stared at
without scruple.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin saw how much they were observed, but
Camilla, unheeding her remarks, listened only to hear
if any footsteps approached; but when, at last, some
struck her ears, they were accompanied by an unknown
voice, so loud and clamorously jovial, that, disturbed,
she looked round—and saw the door violently flung
open, and three persons, dressed like gentlemen, force
their way into the small dwelling place.</P>
<P>Mr. Halder, the leader of this trium virate, was the
particular patron of Girt, the young perfumer; and,
though his superior in birth and riches, was scarcely
upon a par with him, from wilful neglect in educati∣on;
and undoubtedly beneath him in decency and con∣duct,
notwithstanding young Girt piqued himself far
less upon such sentimental qualifications, than upon
<PB N="356" REF="157"/>
his skill in cos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etics, and had less respect for unadui∣terated
morals, than unaduiterated powder.</P>
<P>The second who entered, was, in every particular,
still less defensible▪ he was a peer of the rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; he
had a daughter married, and his age entitled him to be
the grandfather of young Halder. In point of fortune,
speculatists deemed them equal; for though the estate
of Halder was as yet unincumbered with the mortga∣ges
that hung upon that of Lord Valhurst, they com∣puted,
with great exactness, the term of its superiori∣ty,
since already he had inlisted in the jockey<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>meetings,
and belonged to the gaming clubs.</P>
<P>The third, a young man of a serious, but pleasing
demeanour, was rather an attendant than a partner in
this intrusion. He was the only one of the whole party
to whom the countenance of Camilla had announced i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nocence;
and when Halder, instigated by the asserti∣ons
of the facetious Girt, proposed the present mea∣sure,
and Lord Valhurst, caught by the youthful beau∣ty
of the fair subject of discussion▪ acceded, this single
champion stood forth, and modestly, yet firmly, de∣claring
his opinion they were mistaken, accompanied
them with a view to protect her if he himself were
right.</P>
<P>Boisterously entering, Halder addressed at once to
Camilla, such unceremonious praise of her beauty,
that, affrighted and offended, she hast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly seized the arm
of Mrs. Mittin, and, in a voice of alarm, though with
an air of command that admitted no doubt of her se∣riousness,
and no appeal from her resolution, said,
“Let us go home, Mrs. Mittin, immediately.”</P>
<P>Simple as were these words, their manner had an
effect upon Halder to awe and distance him. Beauty,
in the garb of virtue, is rather formidable than attrac∣tive
to those who are natively unenlightened, as well
as habitually degenerate: though, over such as have
ever known better sentiments, it frequently retains its
primeval power, even in their darkest decle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion of de∣pravity.</P>
<P>But while Halder, repulsed, stood back, and the
young champion, with an air the most respectful, made
<PB N="357" REF="158"/>
way for her to pass;▪ Lord Valhurst, shutting the door,
planted himself against it.</P>
<P>Seeing terror now take possession of every feature of
her face, her determined protector called out: “Make
way, my Lord, I beg!” and offered her his hand. But
Camilla, equally frightened at them all, shrunk appal∣led
from his assistance, and turned towards the win∣dow,
with an intention of demanding help from Edgar,
whom she supposed still on the beach; but the peer▪
slowly moving from the door, said he was the last to
mean to disconcert the young lady, and only wished
to stop her till he could call for his carriage, that he
might see her safe wherever she wished to go.</P>
<P>Camilla had no doubt of the sincerity of this propo∣sal,
but would accept no aid from a stranger, even
though an old man, while she hoped to obtain that
of Edgar. Edgar, however she saw not, and fear is,
generally precipitate: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he concluded him gone; conclu∣ded
herself deserted, and, from knowing neither, equally
fearing both the young men, inclined towards Lord Val∣hurst;
who, with delighted surprise, was going to take
her under his care when Edgar rushed forward.</P>
<P>The pleasure that darted into her eyes announced
his welcome. Halder, from his reception, thought
the enigma of his own ill success solved; the other
youth, supposing him her brother, no longer sought to
interfere; but Lord Valhurst exhibited signs of such
irrepressible mortification, that inexperience itself could
not mistake the dishonourable views of his offered ser∣vices,
since, to see her in safety, was so evidently not
their purpose. Camilla, looking at him with the hor∣ror
he so justly excited, gave her hand to Edgar, who
had instantly claimed it, and, without one word being
uttered by either, hastily walked away with him, nimbly
accompanied by Mrs. Mittin.</P>
<P>The young man, whose own mind was sufficiently
pure to make him give easy credit to the purity of a∣nother,
was shocked at his undeserved implication in
so gross an attack, and at his failure of manifesting
the laudable motive which had made him one of the
triumvirate; and, looking after her with mingled ad∣miration
<PB N="358" REF="159"/>
and concern, “Indeed, gentlemen,” he cri∣ed,
“You have been much to blame. You have
affronted a young lady who carries in the whole
of her appearance the marks of meriting respect.”</P>
<P>The sensibility of Lord Valhurst was not of suffici∣ent
magnitude to separate into two courses: the
little he possessed was alreadey occupied by his disap∣pointment,
in losing the beautiful prey he believed just
falling into his hands, and he had no emotion, there∣fore,
to bestow upon his young reprover. But Hal∣der,
who, to want of feeling, added want of sense,
roared out, with rude raillery, a gross, which he
thought witty, attack both of the defender and
the defended.</P>
<P>The young man, with the proud probity of un∣hackneyed
sentiment, made a vindication of his un∣corrupt
intentions; which produced but louder mirth,
and coarser incredulity. The contest, however, was
wholly unequal; one had nerves of the most irritable
delicacy; the other had never yet, by any sensation,
nor any accident, been admonished that nerves made
any part of the human composition: in proportion,
therefore, as one became more offended, the other
grew more callous, till the chivalry of indignant
honour, casting prudence, safety, and forbearance
away, dictated a hasty challenge, which was accept∣ed
with a horse laugh of brutal senselessness of dan∣ger.
Courage is of another description. It risks life
with heroism; but it is only to preserve or pursue
something, without which the charm of life were dis∣solved:
it meets death with steadiness; but it prepares
for immortality with reverence and emotion.</P>
<P>Edgar and Camilla continued their walk in a silence
painful to both, but which neither knew how first to
break; each wished with earnestness an opening to
communication and confidence but, mutually shock∣ed
by the recent adventure, Edgar waited the ab∣sence
of Mrs. Mittin, to point out the impropriety
<PB N="359" REF="160"/>
and insufficiency of such a guard; and Camilla, still
aghast with terror, had no power of any sort to begin
a discourse.</P>
<P>Their taciturnity, if not well supplied, was, at
least, well contrasted by the volubility of Mrs. Mittin,
which, as in the bathing house it had been incessant,
in declaring, to the three intruders, that both she and
the other young lady were persons of honour, was now
no less unremitting in boasting how well she had
checked and kept them in order.</P>
<P>The horror of the attack she had just escaped be∣came
soon but a secondary suffering to Camilla, though,
at the moment, it had impressed her more terribly than
any actual event of her life, or any scene her creative
imagination had ever painted; yet, however dreadful, it
was now past; but who could tell the end of what re∣mained?
the mute distance of Edgar, her uncertainty
of his intentions, her suspicions of his wished seces∣sion,
the severe task she thought necessary to perform
of giving him his liberty, with the anguish of a total
inability to judge whether such a step would recall his
tenderness, or precipitate his retreat, were suggestions
which quick succeeded, and, in a very short time,
wholly domineered over every other.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the house, Edgar demanded
if he might hope for the honour of being presented, as
a friend of the family, to Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>Reviving, though embarrassed, she looked assent,
and went forward to inquire if Mrs. Berlinton were
come home.</P>
<P>The servant answered no; but delivered her a let∣ter
from that lady; she took it with a look of distress
whether or not to invite Edgar to enter, which the▪
at this period, welcome officiousness of Mrs. Mittin
relieved, by saying, “Come, let us all come in, and
make the parlour a little comfortable against Mrs.
Berlington comes home; for, I dare say, there's no∣thing
as it should be. These lodging-houses always
want a heap of things one never thinks of before,
hand.”</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="161"/>
They then all three entered, and Mrs. Mittin, who saw
she said, a thousand ways by which she might serve
and oblige Mrs. Berlinton, by various suggestions, and
even directions, which she hazarded against her re∣turn,
busied herself to arrange the two parlours to her
satisfaction; and then, went up stairs, to settle, also,
all there; making abundant apologies for leaving
them, and assuring them she would be back again as
soon as she possibly could get all in order.</P>
<P>Her departure was a moment of extreme confusion
to Camilla, who considered it as an invitation to her
great scheme of rejection, but who stammered some∣thing
upon every other subject, to keep that off.
She-looked at her letter, wondered what it could con∣tain,
could not imagine why Mrs. Berlinton should
write when they must so soon▪ meet; and spent in
conjectures upon its contents the time which
Edgar besought her to bestow upon their peru∣sal.</P>
<P>Nothing gives so much strength to an adversa∣ry
as the view of timidity in his opponent. Edgar
grew presently composed, and felt equal to his pur∣posed
expostulation.</P>
<P>“You decline reading your letter till I am gone?
“I must therefore, hasten away. Yet, before I go,
I earnestly wish once more to take upon me the
office formerly allowed me, and to represent, with
simple sincerity, my apprehensions upon what I have
observed this morning.”</P>
<P>The beginning of this speech had made Camilla
break the seal of her letter; but its conclusion agita∣ted
her too much for reading it.</P>
<P>“Is this silence,” said he, trying to smile, “to re∣press
me as arrogant,—or to disregard me as imperti∣nent?”</P>
<P>“Neither!” she answered, forcing herself to
look towards him with cheerfulness, it is merely—
“attention.”</P>
<P>“You are very good, and I will try to be brief,
that I may put your patience to no longer proof than
I can avoid. You know, already, all I can urge con∣cerning
<PB N="361" REF="162"/>
Mrs. Berlinton; how little I wonder at the
promptness of your admiration; yet how greatly I
fear for the permanence of your esteem. In putting
yourself under her immediate and sole protection, you
have shewn me the complete dissonance of our judg∣ments
upon this subject; but I do not forget that,
though you had the goodness to hear me, you had
the right to decide for yourself. Trust, indeed, even
against warning, is so far more amiable than suspici∣on,
that it must always, even though it prove unfor∣tunate,
call for praise rather than censure.”</P>
<P>The confusion of Camilla was now converted into
self-reproach. What she-thought coldness, she had
resented, what appeared to be haughtiness, she had
resisted; but truth in the form of gentleness, brought
her instantly to reason, and reason could only resume
its empire, to represent as rash and imprudent an ex∣pedition
so repugnant, in its circumstances, to the wish∣es
and opinions of the person whose approbation was
most essential to her happiness. Edgar had paused,
and her every impulse led to a candid recognition of
what she felt to be wrong; but her precarious situa∣tion
with him, the report of his intended flight by
Jacob, the letters still detained of Sir Sedley Clarendel,
and no explanation demanded, by which she could
gather if his plighted honour were not now his only
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie with her, curbed her design, depressed her courage,
and, silently, she let him proceed.</P>
<P>“Upon this subject, therefore, I must say no more,
except to hint a wish, that the apprehensions which
first induced me to name it may, unbidden, occur as
timely heralds to exertion, should any untoward cir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cumstances
point to danger, alarm, or impropriety.”</P>
<P>The new, but strong friendship of Camilla was
alarmed for its delicacy by these words. The diffidence
she felt, from conscious error, for herself, extended
not to Mrs. Berlinton, whom, since she found guiltless,
she believed to be blameless. She broke forth, there∣fore,
into a warm eulogy, which her agitation rendered
eloquent, while her own mind and spirits were re∣lieved
<PB N="362" REF="163"/>
and revived, by this flight from her mortified
self, to the friend she thought deserving her most fer∣vent
justification.</P>
<P>Edgar listened attentively, and his eyes, though
they expressed much of serious concern, shewed also
an irrepressible admiration of an enthusiasm so ardent
for a female friend of so much beauty.</P>
<P>“May she always merit this generous warmth!”
cried he; “which must have excited my best wishes
for her welfare, even if I had been insensible to her
own claims upon every man of feeling. But I had
meant, at this time, to confine my ungrateful annota∣tions
to another—to the person who had just quitted
the room.”</P>
<P>“You do not mean to name her with Mrs. Berlin∣ton?
to imagine it possible I can have for her any si∣milar
regard? or any, indeed, at all, but such com∣mon
goodwill as all sorts and classes of people are en∣titled
to, who are well meaning?”</P>
<P>“Here, at least, then,” said Edgar, with a sigh
half suppressed, “our opinions may be consonant.
No; I designed no such disgraceful parallel for your
elegant favourite. My whole intention is to remon∣strate—
can you pardon so plain a word?—against your
appearing in public with a person so ill adapted to in∣sure
you the respect that is so every way your due.”</P>
<P>“I had not the smallest idea, believe me of ap∣pearing
in public. I merely walked out to see the
town, and to beguile, in a stroll, time, which in this
person's society, hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g heavy upon me at home, in the
absence of Mrs. Berlinton.”</P>
<P>The concise simplicity of this innocent account,
banished, in a moment, all severity of judgment; and
Edgar, expressively thanking her, rose, and was ap∣proaching,
her, though scarcely knowing with what
purpose, when Mrs. Mittin burst into the room, ex∣claiming:
“Well, my dear, you'll never guess how
many things I have done since I left you. In the
first place, there was never a wash-ball; in the next
place, not a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>napkin nor a towel was in its proper
place; then the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> things were forgot; and as to
<PB N="363" REF="164"/>
spoons, not one could I find. And now I've a mind
to go myself to a shop I took good notice of, and
get her a little almond powder for her nice white
hands; which, I dare say, will please her. I've
thought of a hundred things at least. I dare say I
shall quite win her heart. And I'm sure of my money
again, if I lay out never so much. And I don't know
what I would not do for such a good lady.”</P>
<P>During this harangue, Camilla, ashamed of her
want of resolution, secretly vowed, that, if again left
alone with him, she would not lose a moment in re∣storing
him his liberty, that with dignity she might
once more receive, or with fortitude for ever resign it.
She thought herself, at this moment, capable of either;
but she had only thought it, since his softened look
and an had made her believe she had nothing to fear
from the alternative.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin soon went, though her continued and
unmeaning chattery made the short term of her stay
appear long.</P>
<P>Each eager upon their own plan, both then in∣voluntarily
arose.</P>
<P>Camilla spoke first. “I have something,” she cri∣ed,
“to say,” but her voice became so husky, the
inarticulate sounds died away unheard, and blushing
at so feeble an opening, she strove, under the auspices
of a cough, to disguise that she had spoken at all, for
the purpose of beginning, in a more striking manner,
again.</P>
<P>This succeeded with Edgar at this moment, for
he had heard her voice, not her words: he began,
therefore, himself. “This good lady,” he said,
“seems bit with the rage of obliging, though not, I
think, so heroically, as much to injure her interest.
But surely she flatters herself with somewhat too high
a recompence? The heart of Mrs. Berlinton is not,
I fancy, framed for such a conqueror. But how, at
the same time, is it possible conversation such as this
should be heard under her roof? And how can it
have come to pass that such a person—”</P>
<P>“Talk of her,” interrupted Camilla, recovering
<PB N="364" REF="165"/>
her breath, “some other time. Let me now inquire
—have you burnt—I hope so!—those foolish letters
—I put into your hands?—”</P>
<P>The countenance of Edgar was instantly overcloud∣ed.
The mention of those letters brought fresh to his
heart the bitterest, the most excruciating and intol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rable
pang it had ever experien<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed; it brought Camil∣la
to his view no longer artless, pure, and single-mind∣ed,
but engaged to, or trifling with, one man, while
seriously accepting another. “No, madam,” he so∣lemnly
said, “I have not presumed so far. Their
answers are not likely to meet with so violent a death,
and it seemed to me that one part of the correspond∣ence
should be preserved for the elucidation of the
other.”</P>
<P>Camilla felt stung by this reply, and tremulously an∣swered,
“Give me them back, then, if you please,
and I will take care to see them all demolished toge∣ther,
in the same flames. Meanwhile—”</P>
<P>“Are you sure,” interrupted Edgar, “such a con∣flagration
will be permitted? Does the man live who
would have the philosophy—the insensibility I must
rather style it—ever to resign, after once possessing,
marks so distinguishing of esteem? O, Camilla! I,
at least, could not be that man!”</P>
<P>Cut to the soul by this question, which, though
softened by the last phras<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, she deemed severely cru∣el,
she hastily exclaimed: “Philosophy I have no
right to speak of—but as to insensibility—who is the
man that ever more can surprise me by its display?
Let me take, however, this opportunity—”</P>
<P>A footman opening the door, said, his lady had
sent to beg an answer to her letter.</P>
<P>Camilla, in whom anger was momentary, but the
love of justice permanent, rejoiced at an interruption
which prevented her from speaking, with pique and
displeasure, a sentence that must lose all its purpose
if not uttered with mildness. She would write,
she said immediately; and, bidding the man get her
pen and ink, went to the window to read her letter;
with a formal bow of apology to Edgar as she passed
him.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="166"/>
“I have made you angry?” cried he, when the
man was gone; “and I hate myself to have caused
you a moment's pain: But you must feel for me, Ca∣milla,
in the wound you have inflicted! you know not
the disorder of mind produced by a sudden, unlooked
for transition from felicity to perplexity,—from sereni∣ty
to misery!—”</P>
<P>Camilla felt touched, yet continued reading, or
rather rapidly repeating to herself the words of her
letter, without comprehending, or even seeking to
comprehend, the meaning of one sentence.</P>
<P>He found himself quite unequal to enduring her
displeasure; his own, all his cautions, all Dr. March∣mont's
advice, were forgotten; and tenderly following
her, “Have I offended,” he cried, “past forgiveness?
Is Camilla immoveable? and is the journey from which
I fondly hoped to date the renewal of every hope, the
termination of every doubt, the period of all suffering
and sorrow—”</P>
<P>He stopt abruptly, from the entrance of the servant
with pen and ink, and the interruption was critical:
it called him to his self-command: he stammered out
that he would not impede her writing; and, though
in palpable confusion, took his leave: yet, at the
street-door, he gave a ticket with his name, to the
servant who attended him, for Mrs. Berlington: and,
with his best respects, desired she might be told he
should do himself the honour to endeavour to see her
in the evening.</P>
<P>The recollection of Edgar came too late to his aid
to answer its intended purpose. The tender avowal
which had escaped him to Camilla, of the view
of his journey, had first with astonishment struck her
ear, and next with quick enchantment vibrated to her
heart, which again it speedily taught to beat with its
pristine vivacity; and joy, spirit, and confidence ex∣pelled
in a breath all guests but themselves.</P>
