<HEAD>THE
Person of Quality's
ANSWER
TO
Mr. COLLIER'S LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Doctor,
<DATELINE>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,
<DATE>Jan. <HI>the 27th.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Afternoon, I received your Edifying, Evan∣gelical
Disswasive; for which, What thanks can I
return you? What recompence can be sufficient?
May he, for whose sake you did it, amply Reward you.</P>
<P>I had conceived indeed a Zealous concern at the Disorders
of the Play-House, I lamented its having so much the ascen∣dant
of the Town, and the Countenance of Figure and For∣tune.
And I too justly presaged that these Nurseries of Li∣cense
and Atheism, especially that in our Neighbourhood, wou'd
if unrestrain'd, prove fatal to the Nation; make us Ripe for
Destruction, and pull down some terrible Vengeance on our
Heads; <HI>no less than Popery, or Arbitrary Power at the
least, and dear Doctor, What a Day, and what a sight
wou'd that be to you and me?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
For this Reason I resolved that in my Family, Reforma∣tion
and the Year should begin together, and for that Rea∣son
I called them together as soon as they had dined to Day;
determining to Read a long and a solemn Lecture out
of your short view to them; but a strange fatality had
happened, for some audacious Rats had so prophanely
gnawn it, that it was no longer legible, a detachment in my
Conscience of Play-House Vermin, whom the Devil had
enter'd into for that purpose, at his Congregation in the
Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Thus bilk'd of my Homily, I thought I must to my
great Grief, have been forced to dismiss my Flock. For
I perceived they were grown <HI>frightfully Nice and Impa∣tient,
and were resolved to be cur'd extempore or not at
all.</HI></P>
<P>But then it was that in an auspicious Moment, arriv'd
your short, but Divine Disswasive. I read it over as it
were in a Breath, while they all the while stood gaping
to entertain it. But the last incomparable Paragraph but
one, I pronounc'd with a more Emphatical Voice; Laid
before them with all the Energy of my Lungs, <HI>the sad
instance of God's Judgment in the Terrible Tempest, when we
were almost swept into Chaos,</HI> when Nature <HI>seem'd to be in
her last Agony, and the World seem'd ready to expire.</HI>
And what occasion said I to my gaping Audience, to have
recourse to Tragedies, when those Rants, that Fustian,
and that Bombast, with which deluded Mortals, are
now a days so tickled, are engagingly inserted into our
very Disswasives?</P>
<P>And here Doctor I made two Remarks to them, upon
the Judgment of the late Dreadful Tempest. For first
said I, the outcries of the Play-House practices are so Ag∣gravating,
so Horrible, that the Divine Vengeance which
they brought down upon us, has involv'd the very Inno∣cent.
Not only the Poor Inhabitants of <HI>Cologn,</HI> but the
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
very <HI>Hamburghers</HI> and <HI>Dantzichers,</HI> and all the People of
the <HI>Baltick,</HI> have suffer'd for the Enormities of our <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Theatres; tho' I believe in my Conscience they never
so much as heard of a Play, and know no more the dif∣ference
between a Tragedy and Comedy, than they do
the distance between the Earth and Saturn; so that, said
I, you may observe from hence, 'tis not enough to keep
away from these lewd Entertainments; but you must en∣deavour
with all your might to suppress the Conventicles
of Satan.</P>
<P>The second Observation that I made was this, that we
have reason to be thankful to Heaven, for forbearing us so
long. For if the late Dreadful Judgment had happen'd in
the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when the Play-Houses
were Licentious in all their Impunity, when Reformation
was so far from being thought of, that the very name
was despised and laugh'd at. What must the dismal Con∣sequence
not have been? Then we should certainly have
been swallow'd up; since the <HI>Judgment</HI> was so terrible even
the other Day, after a five Years Reformation?</P>
<P>What reason have we to be thankful, that we live in an
Age in which Light is come into the World. For in what
<HI>Aegyptian</HI> darkness have we liv'd hitherto? And what a
poor Reformation was that which was carried on in Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, in Comparison of that which you are
gloriously projecting? For with that former Reformation
the Play-House began; grew up and spread and flourish'd.
What a shadow of a Reformation was that? 'Tis true
Popery was driven out, and wholsome Laws were Enacted
to secure the Rights of the Pople. But what signified all
that when the Play-House was encourag'd? For tho' as
you learnedly observe, Play-Houses, in the Reign of that
Great Queen, were not permitted to be erected in the Li∣berties
of the City, yet in the Subburbs they were not only
permitted but encourag'd with a Vengeance; and by whom
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
encourag'd? Why not only by the People, but by the
Court, nay, by the Council, yes by those poor deluded
Wretches, <HI>Cecil</HI> and <HI>Walsingham,</HI> who believ'd it to be the
business of forsooth Wise States-Men, to provide Honest
and Reasonable Diversions for the People; and at the same
time were so infatuated, so intoxicated, as to believe the
Entertainments of the Theatre, not only to be Honest and
Reasonable, but the only Honest and Reasonable Diver∣sions.</P>
<P>Nay the poor mistaken Queen her self, encouraged Play-Houses
to that degree, that she not only commanded
<HI>Shakespear,</HI> to write the Comedy of the <HI>Merry Wives,</HI> and
to write it in Ten Days time; so eager was she for the wicked
Diversion; but ev'n with that Hand that weilded the Scep∣ter
descended poorly to Translate a Play that was writ by
a <HI>Grecian</HI> Poet. She had read it seems of some Great Men
among the <HI>Romans,</HI> who had shewn the way; As <HI>Julius
Coesar</HI> had writ <HI>Adrastus, Augustus Ajax, Gracchus Thyestes,</HI>
and <HI>Mecenas Octavia,</HI> and she wanted Judgment, alas poor
Woman, to distinguish between the obligations of a Hea∣then
and a Christian. 'Tis true she was Wise enough in
some things, she kept out Popery and Arbitrary Power,
she defended us from <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> by the meer Force
of her Prudence. But what signified that, you know
Doctor, when she encourag'd the Play-Houses, and wanted
fore-sight in that particular, to presage that these Nurseries
of Vice and Atheism would prove fatal to the Nation?</P>
<P>It seems some Fools about her had told her, that at a
time when Taxes were frequent and grievous, some honest
Diversions would comfort the People, but that it would be
unreasonable to deprive them at once of their Money, and
of their Pleasure too; this she had been told, and she like
an easie Woman believ'd it. But what amazes me most is
this Doctor, that not only that Queen and her Council en∣couraged
Plays, but not so much as one of the Famous Pre∣lates
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
in her time said so much as a word against them. 'Tis
true, the State-Men defended us against <HI>Spain</HI> very vigor∣ously,
and very effectually, and so did the Church-Men
against the <HI>Roman</HI> See; but alas their poor and narrow
Spirits contented themselves with that. But not so much as
one word was said against the Abominations of the Play-Houses.
There were Reformers indeed! Were they so
sensless that they wanted discernment to see the <HI>flaming and
outragious wickedness</HI> of them? Or so very wicked that
they wanted Zeal to discharge their Duty in the suppressing
it? Ah my dear Doctor, Had you but liv'd in those Times,
you would have taught that Queen her Lesson, in Loyal
Libels have told her her Duty, affronted her Authority, de∣fam'd
her Servants, and boldly have told her that she Coun∣tenanc'd
them only to Debauch her People. You would
have open'd the Eyes of those Fools, who believ'd <HI>Shake∣spear</HI>
to be Instructive as well as Innocent. You would
have extracted more <HI>Smutt</HI> from his Comedies, than a
Chimney does from Seacoal. And what Prophaneness and
Blasphemy had you not found in his Tragedies? You
would have satisfied both Queen and Council, and Clergy
too, that their business was to suppress the Play-Houses,
and to let <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> alone. That the Danger that they
were in was not from <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, and <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth;
but from Tyrants who had been many a Year defunct from
<HI>Julius Caesar</HI> and <HI>Macbeth;</HI> you would have <HI>presaged</HI> the
Storm that the latter would have pull'd down upon the
Nation, a Hundred Years after 'twas writ. You had then
been <HI>Histrio Mastix</HI> the first, whereas you are now but
the second of that glorious Name; and then had old
Bungling <HI>Pryn</HI> been cropt for presuming to Copy you.
Thus, my dear Doctor, we have reason to believe what you
would have done, from what we behold you do. For tho'
Popery and Slavery are at our Doors, and each moment
are rushing in upon us; and nothing but the Wisdom of one
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Woman stands between us and them, yet you still retain
your commendable Passive Principle, appear as unconcern'd
as if you had Sworn to be a Foe to neither, are found to
be as little alarm'd for the Church, as if you had thrown
off its Cause as you have cast off its Habit; and instead of
crying out Slavery, Popery, do nothing but cry out the
Play-House, the Play-House, with as much Fury as if you
were afraid it should contribute to the keeping them
out.</P>
<P>But my dear Doctor, By the leave of your Modesty, I
must exalt your Glory to a higher pitch. When Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> died King <HI>James</HI> succeeded him; and among the
Eminent Reformers of his Reign there was no talk of the
Stage. Nay, on the contrary, to their shame be it spoken,
that King and his Court appear'd to be infinitely delighted
with Plays. And in his Visits to the two Universities,
Plays were the chief of his Entertainment. But what would
we have Doctor; as the Education is, so is the Youth.
And he had been tutour'd by old <HI>George,</HI> a Notorious Re∣former,
but a Notorious Playwright. For the Sot believ'd
if seems that the <HI>Drama</HI> could contribute to the Reforma∣tion
of Mankind.</P>
<P>To King <HI>James</HI> succeeded King <HI>Charles</HI> the First; and
then arose another Famous Reformer, <HI>John Milton</HI> by name,
who not only left a Tragedy behind him, the Story of
which he impiously borrow'd from the Bible, written to
leave him without excuse in his mature, nay declining
Years, but has left a fine Encomium on <HI>Shakespear;</HI> has
shewn an extraordinary esteem for <HI>Johnson;</HI> and among all
the things that he thought fit to Reform, so far had pre∣judice
laid hold of his Understanding, it never so much as
came into his Head that the Stage was one of them.</P>
<P>But then about that time, Doctor, there arose a Reformer
indeed, Brother <HI>Pryn</HI> of Illustrious Memory; a Person in∣deed
of an <HI>amazing</HI> boldness. For to the fervency of his
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Furious Spirit, Ruine and Reformation were all one. With
these Zealot's Thoughts he set about Reforming the Church
as well as the Stage; and by preparing the downfal of one
made way for the Ruine of the other. 'Tis true, he lost
some part of himself in the Cause. But happy the Ears
that were so lost! How much happier than those that
stand pricking up daily at the Ribaldry of our Modern
Comedies? I know, dear Doctor, under the Rose, that
you have the same Design, and that you will never leave
off writing as long as there is left either a Prelate or Poet in
<HI>England;</HI> or if you do condescend to admit of Bishops,
you will at least suffer no such Bishops as have a Tang of
the Stage, I mean no Swearing Prophane Bishops, but such
whose Meek and Christian Communication is only Yea and
Nay.</P>
<P>As you have the same noble Design, may you find
better Fortune, as you well deserve. For he, my dear
Doctor, was but a Type, of your more Excellent self,
tho' indeed an Illustrious Type. And he but anticipated
in a cold and gloomy way, the very things that Fate had
designed to be said with Fire and Flame by you. He indeed
overthrew but for a time the Church and Stage together.
But may you with a more propitious Fate—. But hold!—
No Man, you know is able to tell into whose hands a Letter
may fall.</P>
<P>Thus, Doctor the blessed Work of Reformation went on;
and down went the Bishops and the Stage together; but
after they had lain for some time in the dust were restor'd
together, and with them the banish'd King.</P>
<P>And there are not People wanting, who believe, that the
Restoring the Stage, was one of the Motives to the Re∣storing
the banish'd King, for say they, the People of
<HI>England</HI> were at last grown weary of a Nasty, Gloomy,
Sullen, Fanatical Government, and began to long for their
Pleasures. How my dear Doctor? The restoring the
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Stage was one of the Motives to restoring the banish'd King.
Ah my dear Doctor, if you had but flourish'd in that Au∣spicious
Juncture; How happy would you have esteem'd
your self to have been the Instrument of suppressing the
Stage, only on purpose to see it restor'd with such a Glo∣rious
Attendant.</P>
<P>Well! The King, the Bishops and the Stage were re∣stored
together, and a long time flourish'd together, with∣out
any talk of reforming the Play-Houses, much less of
suppressing them. For the Merry Ministers of that Happy
Prince laugh'd at a Reformation. And even the former
Ministers of the Church at that time, among whom were
certainly some of the greatest Men that the Christian World
has produc'd; appear'd by no means to be so terribly
alarm'd at the Entertainments of the Stage.</P>
<P>You your self, I remember Doctor, were then at Years
of Discretion; and yet with Passive Ears and Tongue, en∣dur'd
the Filth of <HI>Epsom</HI>-Wells, the Bawdy of the Soldier's
Fortune, and the Beastliness of <HI>Limber-Ham.</HI> But the time
of your Prophetick Mission it seems was not yet come, or
perhaps you thought it improper to fall out with the Play-Houses,
before you had fallen out with the Government.
But you have at last, to the wonder of the World, declar'd
your self, and we may say of you, what <HI>Lucretius</HI> said of
his ador'd <HI>Epicurus,</HI> Pardon the Comparison, I beseech you
Doctor,
<Q><LG>
<L>That you in Wit surpass Mankind as far,</L>
<L>As does the Midday Sun, the Midnight Star.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>For what in the Beginning of the Reformation was never
seen, neither by <HI>Jewell,</HI> nor <HI>Ridley,</HI> nor <HI>Cranmer,</HI> nor <HI>La∣timer;</HI>
nor was afterwards hardly so much as thought of,
by the Judicious, the Penetrating, the Sagacious <HI>Hooker;</HI>
nor what in this latter end of it, (as under the Rose we
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
sweetly hope Doctor) has not been found out nei∣ther
by <HI>Wilkins</HI> nor <HI>Tillotson,</HI> who have shown so
much Understanding and so much Judgment; as well
by the force of their Invincible Arguments, as of
their Clear, Chaste, Noble and Masculine Styles;
What none of these have been able to find, you
have plainly convinc'd the World of; that the Play-House
would bring all to ruine; O Miracle of
boundless Sagacity! O Prodigy of Penetration!
The late Arch-Bishop was certainly a Man of as un∣doubted
Probity, of as much Integrity, as ever liv'd
of cutting a Man's Throat out of Zeal to Con∣sute
his Doctrine; the late Archbishop, I say, Doctor,
who had so much Boldness, as well as Zeal and In∣tegrity,
and who in the late Reign had so much
Pow'r; never saw this dreadful Danger from Plays,
which you have so plainly discover'd.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">There is something in the E∣leventh V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lume of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sermons <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst <HI>Play</HI> which I h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not seen when this was Writ but Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prevarica<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted vilel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tation.</NOTE> For if he had
seen it, he would have prevail'd upon the late Queen
to suppress them. He either foresaw none of this
Danger, or if he did, the good mistaken Man, thought
there would be more in going about to prevent it.
An infallible sign that he wanted your fore-sight and
your Sagacity. He look'd upon himself to be indi∣spensably
bound in a double respect to Reform the
Corruptions of the times. For he was both Head
of the Church, and first Cousellour of State. And
no Man knew better then that Judicious Prelate,
that Corruptions of Manners are most pernicious both
to Church and State. And no Man ever discover'd
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
more Zeal for the present Establishment, both in
Church and State. And yet poor Man with all his
Understanding, and all his Zeal, he was so far deluded
in this particular, that he never medled with these
Nurseries of License and Atheism. As many
admirable Sermons as he left behind him, against the
Vices and the Errors of the Times; I believe you
will hardly find that he has mentioned the Play-Houses
with bitterness in them all. He left that part
of Reformation for your sublimer Prudence, and more
Heroick Charity. Indeed the Concern that he had
himself both in Church and State was so apparent,
that perhaps he might fear that a violent endeavour to
Reform our Theatres in him might look like Interest;
and might perhaps imagine that the Work would be
kindlier received, if it were carried on by one who
cared not a Farthing either for Church or State.</P>
<P>And here Doctor give me leave to admire the Glory,
or to speak in your own Diviner Language, the
<HI>Meridian blaze of your mysterious Charity. 'Tis of an
amazing size and brightness,</HI> and our weak Eyes are
dazled at it. For that you dear Doctor, who ap∣pear
so extreamly Nice and Scrupulous, that you dare
not so much as take an Oath to defend our Sove∣reign
Lady and us, against our Mortal Enemies; you
who are so over cautious that you dare not so much
as hold any Communion with us, that you should
take up this extream concern for our Souls, that you
should be so violent for our Salvation, is beyond ex∣pression
wonderful. When I consider that all who are
engaged by Duty, are either Dumb or very cold in
the Matter, while you are declaiming with so much
servour, with so much zeal, against the Disorders of
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
our Theatres, you who have nothing to do with the
matter; I can never sufficiently admire the excess of
your Zeal, which is too high and too Heavenly to
be comprehended by a Mortal.</P>
<P>I can only say, that 'tis a thousand pities 'tis con∣fin'd
to so narrow a Sphere. But, alas! good Man,
it is none of your fault that it is not more universal.
For we have reason to be sensible, that if you were
not restrain'd, by the apprehension of Brutal and Beast∣ly
Force, you would not fail to declaim with the same
heat and the same bitterness against both Church and
State.</P>
<P>This amazing brightness of your Charity, has drawn
upon you the Envy of some good Men; has made
you become the Hatred of Libertines, and the Jest and
Scorn of Buffoons. I Doctor am your Champion a∣gainst
them all; and I have many a Bickering in your
behalf, even with my moderate Friends; who are in∣deed
for Reforming the Licentiousness of the Stage,
but are by no means for a suppression of the Play-Houses.
Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> says one of them is too severe.
He does not consider the times that we live in.
These are not the Primitive Apostolical Times, but
the last and Corrupt Ages of the World. The Ca∣pital
of a great Kingdom must have Meetings for pub∣lick
Pleasure. If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is for pulling down Plays;
let him name a more Harmless and Reasonable diver∣sion
to be Established in the room of them. What
would he have us always at our Devotion? Or does
he expect that we should be all Devout? Would he
have Devotion a Mode and Fashion, as it is in <HI>France.</HI>
Where the Rake is as Devout as the Arch-Bishop, the
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Whore-master as the Monk, and the most inconsider∣rable
Punk at <HI>Versaills,</HI> as the most Glorious Madam
<HI>de Maintenon.</HI> 'Tis true, said he, there are things in
some of our Plays, that I could heartily wish were
out, but Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is too rigid, too harsh, and out of
all measure severe. He does not bear with the least
faults, and seems to have no Indulgence for Human
frailty. Thus Doctor you were attack'd the other
Day by a Friend of mine, and you shall see how I de∣fended
you.</P>
<P>Lord Sir, says I, you are the most mistaken Man in
the World. Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is no such Person as you ima∣gine.
He is a good natur'd, sweet temper'd Man as
lives. And will bear as far as any Man whatever.
And as for your saying that he has no Indulgence
for Human frailty, why 'tis a sign that you don't
know him. 'Tis true, he has taken a fatal aversion to
the Play-House; and he will down with it. We have
all of us an aversion for some thing or other. And
why should you be so much concern'd for that <HI>Ren∣devouz
of Rakes and Strumpets?</HI> But yet Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>
has Indulgence enough for them too, any where but in
the Play-House. And where's the mighty hardship
then upon them? Are there no places for them to as∣semble
but there? Are there not Taverns, Brandy-Shops,
Coffee-Houses, Chocolate-Houses, Gaming-Houses
for the Rakes, and Indian-Houses, Musick-Houses,
Bawdy-Houses, either for Strumpets Solitary, or Strum∣pets
and Rakes in Conjunction according as they please.
Has Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> writ one Word for five Years together
against any of these places? For Godsake what do
you call want of Indulgence then? Is not every Coffee-House
in Town grown a Gaming-House? May not
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
we go every Hour of the Day into several of them,
and see and hear twenty Fellows Swearing and Blasphe∣ming,
and one surrounded by that horrid Crew.</P>
<Q><L>Shaking with Bloody Oaths the Box,</L>
<L>And calling upon Plague and Pox</L>
<L>T' assist him.</L></Q>
<P>Why, there they may Swear and be damn'd for all
Mr. <HI>Collier.</HI> He troubles himself with Swearing no
where but in the Play-House? But what do you
mean by Human Frailty? When People are wicked
in earnest that's something. He has nothing to say
against such. But to be Vicious in Jest, to play the
Fool with the Devil, to counterfeit Sin forsooth on
pretence of decrying it, why these are <HI>dreadful pro∣vocations,
this is flaming, and outragious wickedness.</HI>
And wickedness, which he is positively and absolutely
resolv'd that he will not endure.</P>
<P>Come, Come says he, I begin to be sensible of the
matter. Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is now declining in Years; and
the Affairs of the World go not according to his
Wishes. And Age and Disappointments have sowr'd
his Blood, and made him loose the relish of Sports and
gay Diversions. Once more said I, you are the most
mistaken Man in the World; Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is far from
being a Foe to the gayest Sports and Pastimes; But
then he is for having those who frequent them take the
consent and approbation of the <HI>Nonjuring</HI> Clergy along
with them, who you know are <HI>Persons of Sobriety and
Conduct.</HI> He'll tell you, that the Sports that good Bishop
<HI>Laud</HI> appointed for the Sabbath, were not only safe
but commendable. That for example, Cricket when
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
it came to be so recommended, immediately became
Canonical, Foot-Ball Orthodox, and Jugle-Cat, <HI>Jure
Divino.</HI> But for the Layety to be so impertinent as
to chuse diversions for themselves; and particularly
for the Ladies to believe that they have Capacities
enough to Judge between right and wrong, and to di∣stinguish
Decency from what is not <HI>Decorum,</HI> he takes
to be an Enormity that is never to be allow'd of in
any Christian Country.</P>
<P>The Play-House said I, is one of those which
Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> believes to be too Luscious a Pastime
for the Layity. To see and to read Plays,
he thinks is enough, for one of his Establish'd
Virtue. And it must be own'd, that he has read or
seen more than any Person in <HI>Christendom.</HI> As for the
Layity less vigorous Diversions may serve them. The
Men may take a Game at Bowls in the Summer, and a

may visit their grave Relations, and in Summer Evenings
may take a Boat to cool themselves.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The same Company for the most part that frequents the <HI>Park</HI> frequents the <HI>Play-House.</HI></NOTE> For as for the <HI>Park,</HI>
he says, that is a place that <HI>is too much frequented by Rakes
and Strumpets. He does not mean, he says, that all the
Company there are so; but this he may affirm he says,
that scarce any Quarter is sometimes so plentifully
stock'd. Now who says Mr.</HI> Collier, <HI>would trust his
Health in a place of Mortality, or go to the Pest-House
for Recreation.</HI> Thus Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> like a Per∣son
of Conduct and Sobriety, treats the Layity with
the same Circumspection, that a <HI>Romish</HI> Priest does
his Congregation at high Mass, who only delivers the
Wafer to the People, and reserves the Wine for him∣self.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
But Doctor I had almost forgot one thing, that I
urg'd among the rest in your Defence, and that was
the Reason why you stick so close to the Play-House,
and let some other <HI>flaming</HI> Vices alone, which he
was pleased to enumerate. And that was that you
took this way of proceeding, to be laying the Ax to
the Devilish Root of the accursed Branches, that the
Play-House was the undoubted Cause of all the Iniquity
in the Nation; and that if we could but down with
that, a suddain Reformation would follow among all
sorts of People. That Porters would no longer be
Drunk with Belch. That Vigorous Captains would be
Tilting no more at Handsome Drawers in Taverns,
that losing Gamesters would no more Blaspheme, and
my Lady <HI>Dabcheeks</HI> Basset-Bank would be immediately
broke.</P>
<P>These are the things that I have said in your behalf
to several of the Enemies of your Short View and De∣fence.
I now come to tell you what has happen'd
upon the receiving your Disswassive; tho' 'tis scarce
three Hours since its arrival. Immediately upon the
reading it, my Eldest Son <HI>Jack</HI> told me that he was
perfectly satisfied that Plays were abominable; and
taking his Hat, his Sword and his Cloak, went away
for St. <HI>James</HI>'s. My Eldest Daughter <HI>Susan,</HI> is gone
to take a walk in the Garden, to Meditate there in the
Dark; that she may have the Arguments in Readiness,
by which she says she designs to Convert her Sister.
But my Younger Son <HI>Charles</HI> made some Objections,
and so did my Daughter <HI>Harriet,</HI> which I here send
you as well as I can recollect them, because I know
Doctor that you are able to answer them better than I
can.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
Sir, says <HI>Charles,</HI> I have promis'd my Lady <HI>Freelove</HI>
to Day, to wait upon her to the Play, and so has my
Sister <HI>Harriet;</HI> but for the future I promise you to
keep away, and so I dare say will my Sister, if you
will but answer some Objections that we have to make
against Mr. <HI>Colliers</HI> Discourses.</P>
<P>I know no Reason, why Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> should pretend
to meddle with our Diversions. If he is really offend∣ed
at Plays himself, in the name of God let him keep
away, I know no body who is fond of his Company
there. But since we don't pretend to oblige him to
come, Why should he presume to oblige us to keep away?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is really offended at Play-Houses, I
would fain know how long he has been so, or what is
the Reason that he did not write against them when he
was Young. For the Stage was really then more Li∣centious
than it is now. Since he forbore writing a∣gainst
them till he was Old, we humbly desire that we
may not leave them till we are Old. And then perhaps,
we may have some natural or some politick Considera∣tions
that may oblige us to rail as much as he does.</P>
<P>How comes this Man to take up so much concern
for us? Is it Christian Charity, and a tender care for
our Souls? I would fain ask him one Question, Is
not true Religion that which is chiefly necessary for
the Salvation of Souls? If he says it is, Why then
let me ask him another Question. Is the Religion
which we of the present Establish'd Church of <HI>England</HI> pro∣fess
the true one, or is it not? If it is, Why does
not he hold Communion with us? If it is not, Why
does not he set us right? Has he a concern for our
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Souls or not? If he has, Why does he not mind the
main thing? If he has not, Why does he pretend to
make us uneasie, and set us together by the Ears about
trifles?</P>
<P>Is it a concern for the State that makes him take
up his Pen; because perhaps he believes that the Cor∣ruptions
of the Stage may prove of Dangerous Con∣sequence
to the Government. But if he has that ex∣tream
concern for it, Why does he not take an Oath
to be true to it? Why does he not Abjure the Gen∣tleman
who dwells at St. <HI>Germains?</HI> He believes us
Schismaticks, and he believes us Rebels, and takes no
notice of the matter. But if we talk of going to a Play,
the Man's Zeal grows flaming and outragious upon it.
Certainly his is a very nice, and very extraordinary
Charity!</P>
<P>But if he is offended at Plays, so much as he pre∣tends,
Why does he see them, why does he read them
so much? Why should he be so ridiculously conceited,
and so spiritually proud, as to think that he can stand
under Temptations, under which we must fall?</P>
<P>If he has so much aversion for Plays as he pretends,
if they are so very horrible, Why has he read so many?
Why has he done evil that good may come of it? If
he really loves them, and they are not so abominable,
Why has he writ against them? If he has writ against
Plays that he loves, How comes it that he says no∣thing
against the Church and State which he
hates?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
What Reason can be given for that, unless that he
waits for his opportunity, which by setting us at
variance about trifles; he hopes in some measure to
hasten, or unless, while in the Face of the World he
is Bombarding the Stage, he is diligently in private
undermining the Church and the State?</P>
<P>In this Age of universal Tolleration, when Non∣sense
of every Sort and Size is tollerated, not only
that Gloomy, Sullen, Lifeless Nonsense, which is
to be heard at <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Anabaptist</HI> Meetings, but
that sparkling spirited, fiery Fustian which is to be
found in our Disswasives; in an Age in which Schism
it self is tolerated, Heresie is tolerated; nay, when
Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Jacobite Congregation is tollerated; in
this Age of universal tolleration for Hypocrisie and
Nonsense, Shall we suffer an Inquisition to be set up,
for Wit, and Sense and Pleasure?</P>
<P>We are willing to have all the Indulgence in the
World, for the Errors and Frailties of our fellow
Creatures; and tho' we may believe some of them
Schismaticks, believe some of them Hereticks, yet we
are not for Reforming them against their Wills, nor
saving them out of Malice. And we thought we
might have hop'd, at least that the Government might
have hop'd that at the same time that it Indulges
some of them, not only in different ways of Wor∣ship,
but ways which are disagreeable, and some of
them prejudicial to it, and ways which neither are,
nor were, nor never will be tollerated in any other
Kingdom of <HI>Europe;</HI> we thought, I say, that the Go∣vernment
might have hop'd that these very Persons
would have born with a Diversion, which is Establish'd
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
by that, and which is not only protected by each of
the Governments of the most considerable Kingdoms
in <HI>Europe,</HI> but which has had always the allowance
of publick Authority in the most flourishing Nations;
and has been believed by them all to be the fittest
Entertainment that can be allow'd by publick Autho∣rity.
At a time when the Government has shewn so
much Indulgence for them; might it not be expected
that they should shew some Regard for that, and not
demand with furious Clamours, the suppression of an
Entertainment, Establish'd by its Authority? For are
not these Clamours against the Queen whose Servants
it like that, and bring all things into Confusion.</P>
<P>Pray Sir Consider, Have we spent so much Blood
and Treasure in the Defence of our Liberties, And
shall we suffer an Inquisition to be set up for that
which is the very Life and Soul of Liberty, and that
is harmless Pleasure; for 'tis for harmless Pleasure we
only contend. Let the Corruptions of the Stage be
banish'd, but let the rest remain. Yet at the same
time it must be allowed that it is not Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> who is
a proper Judge of their Innocence or their Guilt. One
wou'd Judge my Lord <HI>Chamberlain</HI> and the Master of
the Revels have common Sense to distinguish right
from wrong. Is Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> a Person fit to be ap∣peal'd
to from them? And shall we not dare to go
to a Play, till his License-Office is open? Shall we
suffer our selves to be led by the Nose by a Decla∣mator,
till we are brought into such a condition that
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
we shall long for Slavery? How long shall we suffer
Hypocrisie to pass upon us for exact and scrupulous
Virtue, Tropes for Reason, and Foppish Affectation for
fine Language?</P>
<P>Shall we not only suffer an Inquisition to be set
up for Pleasure, but as it were by universal implicit
consent permit his Disciples to set up themselves for
Inquisitors? When the Government of <HI>England</HI> pre∣tends
to give no Laws to the People, but by virtue
of their own Election, and their own Consent; Shall
the Rabble erect themselves into Legislators, and pre∣sume
to give Laws to the Queen her self, and all the
Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> whether they will
or no?</P>
<P>What has Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> to do with our Diversions?
Let him prove the Authority of his Mission to Preach
up th' abolishing of that Heathen Invention a Play-House.
Cannot we meet together in a Play-House,
where we have no manner of Design upon Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI>
without alarming him; and raising his Passions as he
calls it to Combustion; when at the same time we
have suffer'd him so long to meet in his separate
Congregations, where we reasonably believe that
he has a Design upon us. Certainly his is a plea∣sant
Charity, who in the very Hour of Death can
Absolve an Impenitent Traytor, and Damn a poor
Fellow with Absolute Power only for going to the
Play-House. What can he mean at this time of
Day, when our Religion and Laws and Liberties are
in the utmost Danger, from the Designs of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Rome</HI> abroad, and a base Perfidious Party at
Home, thus to divert Men from looking after their
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
all, by scaring them with ridiculous Presages from the
Corruptions of the Stage? If Corruptions contrary
to the Queens knowledge have crept into our Thea∣tres,
and Corruptions too Enormous to be born by
his scrupolous Virtue; Why did he not as his
Loyalty oblig'd him to do, humbly Petition her
Majesty to Redress them, instead of making use of
the Licentiousness of the Press, to raise Seditious Cla∣mours
against her Conduct to the People?</P>
<P>It must be acknowledg'd there are Corruptions
which are crept into our Theatres, for into what
Human Inventions will not Corruptions creep, since
it is plain that they insensibly creep into Religion
which is of Divine Establishment. But 'twould be
a Monstrous Conclusion, that because of the Cor∣ruptions
of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> Reveal'd Religion
ought to be suppressed, and Men to turn Deists or
Atheists.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there are passages in several of our
Plays, which I could heartily wish were out. But
neither do I see a quarter so many as Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>
does, nor do I look upon those which I do see, thro'
his magnifying opticks. The long view that he has
taken of Smutt, as he very quaintly calls it, in his
short view of the Stage, puts me in mind of a
<HI>Dutch</HI> Grotesy that is at my Lady <HI>Freeloves;</HI> where
there is an Antick Frier who has cast off his Frock,
Squinting thro' a Microscope at a Wanton Nun; who
has thrown off her Petticoat. But Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is
mistaken, if he thinks that to discern some certain
matters, he has need of a Magnifying Glass. He has
a Hawks, nay an Eagles Eye of his own at them;
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
and I dare say, can see as clearly and as distinctly
through two Petticoats and a Smock, as <HI>Eustace
Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ins,</HI> of Immortal Memory, could Swear through
a two Inch Board.</P>
<P>'Tis very true Sir, as I observed before, that there
are several things in our Comedies, which I could
wish had been left out; and there are particularly
some Bawdy passages in them, which I wish the
Authors had had more respect for the Audience in
general, and for the fair Sex in particular, than
to have inserted in them. But does he think
our Virtue so very weak, either the Ladies or
the Gentlemen's, that we cannot give them a tran∣sitory
hearing without being Debauch'd by them,
while his it seems is so very strong, that he can
dwell for Months upon them, and make a full Col∣lection
of them, a Collection which has taught se∣veral
of our Ladies more Bawdy in two Hours,
than they would have learn'd in so many Years at
the Play-House? Does he believe that no body
ought to entertain them obscenely but himself? Or
does he pretend to Erect a Monopoly for Bawdy;
to retail it to his Stationers as oft as his occasions
require? 'Tis true, there are Corruptions which
have crept into our Theatres, and these Corrupti∣ons
ought to be Reformed, but therefore ought the
Stage to be ruin'd? Is not the Corruption of the
Stage an evident proof of its Original Goodness,
since what is Originally Wicked never can be Cor∣rupted?
But in what Human Conversation is there
not Corruption?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Does Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> really believe that there is no
Swearing in Gaming-Houses? No Intriegues at <HI>India</HI>
or Chocolate-Houses? No Lying, and no Sharping in
Coffee-Houses, no Beastly Leudness at Musick-Houses,
and Bawdy-Houses? If he believes that these Places
are Guilty of the Crimes imputed to them, Why
does he not Preach to them, which have a great
deal more occasion for Reformation than the Play-House?
For in most of them you have Venom
without Preservative, but the Play-House carries or
should carry the Antidote with the Poison. If Mr.
<HI>Collier</HI> has seen any of these places, as 'tis hard to
believe that one of his Experience should not have
been at some of them; methinks he should be con∣vinc'd
that by correcting of them, he would begin
with the Head, whereas now he but pleases and tickles
Corruption, by catching Reformation by the Tail.
A little common Sense may serve to convince a
Man, that the Reforming the Stage would never
Reform the Town, but the Reforming the Town
would certainly Reform the Stage.</P>
<P>What is the Reason then that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> neglect∣ing
the Vices of the Town, keeps such a Bustle at
those of the Stage. Why because it is not his design
or business to Correct or Reform any thing? His
only business is to set up himself. To erect an ob∣scure
Schismatical Parson into a Saint of the first
Magnitude. To pass for a Man of more Sanctity
than all the Bishops, and of more Discernment than
all the Ministers of State. His business is not to Cor∣rect
and Reform, but to amuse, to puzzle, to make a
Noise and a Party; to make the Stage the Apple of
Dissention, to set us at untimely Variance at this
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
dangerous Juncture. He has Experience enough of
the World, to know that a Noise and a Party is
not to be made, by barely attacking of Vice. For
by doing that he would oblige only the Vertuous.
And alas they are but few; and a Silent, a Modest
and an Humble Party. But by attacking the Stage, he
obliges the Vitious too, and they are Numerous, and Pert,
and Arrogant, and Noisie and Tumultuous. 'Tis
true, the Virtuous are Enemies to the Vices and
Corruptions of the Stage. But only the Guilty and
the Hypocrites are Enemies to a Stage Reform'd,
because a Stage Reform'd would be Enemies only to
them. When Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> began to Write his short
View, he designed to oblige only the first, for in the
beginning of that Book, his intent is plainly only to
Reform the Stage. But then afterwards he Wisely
considered that the obliging the Virtuous would not
do his business. They are not enough to cry up their
Champion, and bring him into Reputation. But if
he appear'd an Enemy to the Stage it self, and at∣tempted
to Destroy it instead of Reforming it, Why
then he would oblige all the Doubty Hectors in Vir∣tue,
a numerous multitude of false Branes, who would
infallibly stand Buff for him, and be his Bully Backs
on occasion. He knew of old the Catalogue of
those who were Enemies to Satyr, and he knew
that all the Enemies to Satyr, were so to the <HI>English</HI>
Stage.</P>

I will not pretend to Interpret <HI>Horace</HI> to you litterally, but I
desire your leave to make some Observations upon him by way of
Paraphrase, which will set his Sense in a clearer light, and convince
you of this Important Truth, that all who would appear what they
are not, are mortal Enemies to Comedy, because the Comick Poet
is perpetually upon the hunt for Originals; and every one would
be glad to play the Fool or the Knave in quiet, without being sing∣led
from the Herd.</P>
<P>Sir, I shall at present trouble you, but with two of these Cha∣racters
of <HI>Horace,</HI> not only because I am sensible that I begin to tire
you, but for Reasons which I shall hint to you anon, but those two
Characters I desire that I may set before you with the same additi∣ons,
with which time has transmitted them to us, and by altering
them made them Modern.</P>
<P>The First is he, <HI>Qui ob avaritiam laborat.</HI> A Gogling, Snarling,
Groaning, Praying Rogue; though at the same time an Usurer and
an Extortioner, a Fellow so notoriously given to cheating, that he
defrauds even himsef of Necessaries, who can Dine on a Prayer as
Sir <HI>John Denham</HI> says, and Sup on an Exhortation, one who makes
a Stalking-Horse of Religion, and lyes sculking behind it with no
other purpose than to draw Wild-Greese within his Reach.</P>
<P>The other Sir, is he; <HI>Qui mutat merces, &amp;c.</HI> A Biggotted Stock-Jobber,
or a Fanatick Monopolizer, a Fellow that devoutly calls
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
up his Family to Repetition on Sundays; and as devoutly makes
them his Tools to Smuggle and Cheat the Queen on the Week-Days.
A Person who will stick at no manner of Villany, but is kind∣lycontented
to be damn'd, only that his great Boobily Boy, may
get half a dozen Claps, half a score Surfeits, lose half his Estate at
the Groom-Porters, be cheated of the other half by Sharpers who
are under Spur-Leathers; and Jog on to the Devil a little more gay∣ly
than his Father. In the mean time this good natur'd Father a leads
most Exemplary Life. In the Morning while his Servants are
busie at the Water side, he walks about the City, to pull down
Play Bills, Cheat those who deal with him, to cause all the Beggars
that he finds in his way to be Whipt; though at that very time he is
going to augment the Number of them, to visit Watch-Men, Head-Boroughs,
and Petty Constables, and charge them that if they find
any Handsome Whore upon their Watch, they should bring her to
him the next Morning; and least the Constable or the Watch should
have a wambling to her themselves, for such things he remembers
have been formerly done, he reads a long Lecture to them against
Concupisence, and then goes Home, and gravely Dines with his
Family. The Afternoon he passes in walking from Tavern to Ta∣vern,
in which he Drinks above Twenty Nipperkins, in as many
several Kitchens, to see that there is no Swearing, and no Prophane∣ness
there, but that People as he thinks it behoves good Christians,
get Devoutly and Religiously Drunk; till growing more and more
inflam'd with Canary and Zeal, and being full of them both, he is
obliged at the last to Disembogue himself, which he does of each,
by Spewing and Preaching in turns. And after he has thus performed
his Duty to the Publick; and Fortified himself for the better per∣formance
of private Duties, he goes home like a Good Man, to Fast and
Pray with his Family; I say to Fast Sir, not out of Covetous∣ness
or Superstition, but that he may secure the Chastity of his
Daughters by mortifying the Old Man in them, and the Youths of
his Family.</P>
<P>But Sir, by your shaking your Head; and your biting your Lip,
I am to believe you mistake me. I am not here for making a Satyr
upon the City. I know very well that this City is the only true and
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
solid Foundation of the <HI>English</HI> Strength. Nor am I such a Fool as
to believe that Sense or Honour are confined to place. I am my self
acquainted with a great many Citizens, who are very Estimable
Members of the Commonwealth; I know several among them who
are not only Men of Sense and Honour, but of Wit and Pleasantry.
I know several of them, whose true Zeal for Religion, is shewn by
all that engaging Charity, that atractive Humility, and lovely Meek
ness, which are the only signs of a good Christian. And for such true
Christians whether they may belong to the Church or Meeting-House,
no Man has a greater respect than I have; who Judge of Mens
Devotion, not by the Errors of their Understandings, but by the
Sincerity of their Hearts. But every Hypocrite, to talk in Mr. <HI>Colliers</HI>
extraordinary Dialect, is the Displeasure and the Disease of my
Eyes. I Hunt him, as <HI>Boileau</HI> says, as a Dog does his Game, and
as soon as ever I smell him, I bark immediately. And with submissi∣on
to you Sir, I believe I am in the Right of it, and that the Hypo∣crites
in Christian Warfare, ought to be more severely handled, than
a Strumpet or a Libertine, as we treat an open declar'd Enemy less
rigorously than a Spy. That the number of Hypocrites in the City
is very great, the Men of true Devotion there will be the first to ac∣knowledge.
'Tis to the Level of them that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has particu∣larly
Writ: Every thing in his short View, his Defence and his
Disswasive appears to be adapted to them; the Sophistry of his De∣ductions,
the Equivocating and Prevaricating of his Citations, the
Finialness of his Language, and the Pharisaical Arrogance of his
Zeal. By gaining of these he knew he should compass both the ends,
for the which he Writ. The first of which was that he should engage
a numerous Party to make a Noise and to Bully for him; of which
he did not fail.</P>
<P>For is it notoriously known that in the late Reign, several Per∣sons
of the foremention'd Stamp, who pretended to meet together
for the support of the Laws and the Government, discharg'd their
Malice in a publick manner against several Gentlemen, of known
Loyalty and <HI>English</HI> Principles; only that they might do an accept∣able
thing to a Man whom they knew to be a Mortal Enemy to
the present Establishment.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/>
The other end that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> probably propos'd to himself, by
exasperating the Noisie and Clamorous part of the City against the
Theatres, might be to Animate them against the People of Quality,
whose presence supports them, and the Court whose Authority pro∣tects
them. That that this is no Chimerical Conjecture, may be
thought by any one who takes a short view of Mr. <HI>Colliers</HI> Prin∣ciples.
For from this proceeding he might easily forsee one of these
two Consequences. For upon these Clamours and Outcries, either
the Play-Houses would be suppress'd, or they would be protected.
If they were suppress'd, he easily saw the Gentry would be diso∣flig'd,
and that would be a pretty handsome steptowards some far∣ther
Reformations, and Alterations. But if upon these Clamours
they were not suppress'd, why then he had a great deal of Reason
to hope that the City would grow sullen and sower. And if their be∣ing
out of Humour was of such dangerous Consequence in the Days
of Brother <HI>Pryn</HI> of blessed Memory; when the Court appeared to
have so little occasion for them, he believ'd that it might be of greater
Moment now, when he knew that by the Necessity of the Times,
the Court was oblig'd to Demand their assistance frequently.</P>
<P>Sir, you have often told me with extream goodness, that you re∣quir'd
no Obedience to any Commands that you laid upon us, if
they did not appear to be Reasonable; Because, God himself, you
have been pleased to tell us, required only our Reasonable Service.
But Sir, Can you believe it Reasonable, that I should be of another
Man's Opinion against my own Sentiments, when it appears so
plainly that he is not of his own? For Sir, Can any thing be more
evident than that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is moved to Write against the Stage
by another Motive than that which he pretends. His Motive per∣haps
may be Human Policy, but it can never be Charity, or perhaps
'tis Spleen or Covetousness, or Pride, or Arrogance, or Fear. I say,
Fear Sir. For has not Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> Reason to apprehend the Stage as
well as Hypocrites of the foremention'd Characters? For is it not
evident, that at the same time that he is setting up for a First Rate
Reformer, he has shewn to the World, that he is but a Fifth-Rate
Comedian? And while he pretends to condemn Acting upon the
Stage, is Acting a Part upon the Stage of the World, so awkardly
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
and so ridicuously, that all who are furnish'd with Common Sense, have
found it to be Comedy? For whom he does he pretend to Reform? Is
it not the People, as I observ'd before, whose Religion he abhors, and
and whose Government he hates? And does not he know very well that
by Reforming our Manners, he would run Counter to his own Designs
and Wishes; because Reformation of Manners would confirm the present
Establishment, both in Church and State? and can he then really design
to Reform us? But how does he propose to himself, to bring this about?
Why not by suppressing Vice, but the Stage that Scourges and exposes it.
For he meddles not with that Vice that is the World, let it be never so
<HI>flaming and outragious.</HI> For example, the crying Sin of <HI>England</HI> next to Hy∣pocrisie,
at this time is Gaming; a Sin that is attended with several others,
both among Men and Women, as Lying, Swearing, Perjury, Fraud, Quar∣rels,
Murders Fornication, Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltery. Has not Gaming done more mis∣chief
in <HI>England</HI> within these last Five Years than the Stage has done in
Fifty? For when Women have lost vast Summs at Play, which they have
been afraid to own to their Fathers or Husbands, Have they not often
been known to pay them after a shameful way? How can the most In∣veterate
Biggot pretend that Gaming is fomented or encouraged by the
Stage? Must he not on the contrary he oblig'd to own, that it is Censur'd
and Corrected by it? What is the Reason then that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> neglect∣ing
so Important and so Dangerous a Vice, against which no body has
said one Word; reserves all his Rage for the Play-House? And takes an
occasion from the late Tempest to threaten us with some Terrible Ven∣geance
from Heaven, if it is not immediately supprest. Can any thing be
more ridiculous than this from him? For does not he wish for the great∣est
Vengeance that Heaven can send down upon us? Can any Vengeance
be inflicted on a Protestant and free People more terrible than Slavery and
Idolatry? Is not the late Tempest, though dreadful in it self, yet a very
trifle compared to those? Tho' the late Storm should return, <HI>and nature
should once more appear to be in her last Agony, and the World be Ready to ex∣pire;</HI>
would not every one, who has Noble <HI>English</HI> Principles, chuse rather
to see it Perish, than to lose his Religion and his Liberty? Besides, Has
the late Tempestany thing to do with the business of the Play-House? What
can Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> mean then by threatning us with terrible Vengeance, at
the same time that he wishes it; and by engaging us in frivilous and
groundless Dissentions, endeavours all that he can to bring it on us at the
very time that he pretends to avert it?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Collier's</HI> Zeal were sincere; he would neither go about to frighten
us with things, which it is plain that he is not afraid of; nor neglecting
more dangerous Crimes would he attack the less. Besides it is plain that
he himself has not that Opinion of the Stage, into which he would Fool
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
and Delude us. For if the cause of the Stage were so bad as he would
make us believe; or if it were out of Charity that he attack'd it, What
need he make use of notorious falshood to decry it? 'Tis a pleasant Cha∣rity
that engages a Man to be damn'd himself to Reform others. Besides,
What occasion has Truth to have recourse to Falshood, which may some∣times
indeed support Falshood, but must always to discerning Eyes ren∣der
Truth suspected.</P>
<P>You know Sir, that it is easie for me to prove, that in this short Let∣ter
addrest to you Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> has recourse to Falshood. For can any
thing be more plain, even from the Artifice of his Address to you? Does
not he here, to make the World believe, thot he has the <HI>Countenance of
Figure and Fortune,</HI> Palm you upon the Town for a Person of Quality,
who are only a p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivate Gentleman?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is mov'd by Charity to exclaim thus loudly against the
Stage, let me ask him one Question, Who are the Persons whom he de∣signs
to Reform? They who never come to a Play-House, methinks should
have no occasion for his Corrections. If his Design is on those who come
thither; Why does he not insinuate himself into their Affections, by the
Meekness and Humility of his Expressions, and the Atractive Language
of Charity? Why has he recourse to such Presumptuous Arrogance, as
justly renders him the Aversion of some, and the Scorn of others? with
him an Audience which you very well knew Sir, is often one of the most
Venerable and Awful Assemblies that can be any where found, is an As∣sembly
of Rakes and Strumpets; Buffoons are the Poets, and the Players
Libertines; Does he believe that such Language is proper to work upon
these People; or to provoke them and exasperate them, and render
them deaf to Argument or Perswasion.</P>
<P>Besides there is something in Mr. <HI>Collicers</HI> Style with which Truth is al∣most
incompatible, and that is Affectation, which is always false. Truth
is plain and simple, and natural, and as she can have no defect in her is
but hid by Ornament. 'Tis true when we convey her to the Understand∣ing
by the Passions, we sometimes give her Ornament. But then that Or∣nament
must be in nature and consequently true. But Affectations always
false and can no more consist with truth than darkness can with light.
What I have observed of Man in general, my be said of Writers; That
Affectation is a certain sign in them of want of Sincerity, or of Under∣standing,
and very often of both.</P>
<P>But Mr <HI>Collier</HI>'s is the most affected, most Foppish Style that ever I met
with in Ancient or Modern Authors; of which I will undertake to con∣vince
any Impartial Man, if he is but a tolerable judge of writing.</P>
<P>But to return from Words to Things, I have not time enough to dis∣play
the perpetual Sophistry of his Inferences, or rather his no Inferences,
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
for a Metaphor or an Allegory is with him an Argument, and so is often
an Hyperbole. But I shall say a word of the more than Jesuitical preva∣ricating
in his Authorities. I shall only insist upon too, the one of which
he brings from Old, and the other from Modern <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Pray Sir, Let me see Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Letter; Ay, here the Authorities are.</P>
<P>The Republick of <HI>Rome,</HI> before <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> stopt the building of a Theatre,
being fully convinc'd, that this diversion would bring in Foreign Vice, that the
old <HI>Roman</HI> Virtue would be lost, and the Spirits of the People Emasculated.</P>
<P>To prove this he refers his Reader to his Defence of the Short View.
That is, he endeavours to support the Sham which he puts upon the World
now, by that which he put upon it five Years ago. 'Tis true after all, Mr.
<HI>Collier</HI> speaks the Truth here, but 'tis dash'd and brew'd with a Vengeance.
'Tis true, the <HI>Romans</HI> did stop the building of a Theatre, before the Time
of <HI>Caesar.</HI> But would he pass this upon us for one Act of the <HI>Roman</HI> Peo∣ple,
or for their constant Sense? If for their constant Sense, their constant
practise proves that it was quite contrary. If for one Act, of what validity
can that possibly be against their constant Sense?</P>
<P>Is not Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> now a most shameful Hyocrite? For does not he know
that the <HI>Romans</HI> had the highest veneration for Plays imaginable? Is not
every School-Boy, who has read <HI>Terence</HI> convinc'd of it? Do not his Co∣medies
tell us by their Titles that they were part of the Religion of that
People? That they were all acted at their Funeral Ceremonies, or at the
Festivals of their Gods?</P>
<P>That which he has said of Q <HI>Elizabeth</HI> is another Pious F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aud, a meer
Religious Banter. But I know that you who are so well acquainted with
the History of our Nation must be already satisfied of it.</P>
<P>But the Pope has lately shut up the Theatres in <HI>Italy?</HI> Can any thing
be more absurd than this? Has the Pope lately shut up the Bawdy-Houses?
Or does he continue to lay a Tax upon Sin, and to give them Spiritual
Licenses? 'Tis very certain he does. What then would Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> conclude
from this; that the Government here ought to License Bawdy-Houses,
and to Suppress Play-Houses, because the Pope takes the fame Method?</P>
<P>I think Sir, I have made it plainly appear, that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is one who
has Reason to be afraid of Theatres, and therefore to hate them. For he
is one of those with a Vengance who endeavour to appear what they are
not. And tho' now a Days a Priest is not suffer'd to be brought upon the
Stage, yet I question whether he is to be regarded as a Priest, who wears
a Sword of five Foot long, and a Perruke of three, and goes about Re∣forming
in the same Habit, in which the <HI>French</HI> Dragoons are at this very
Juncture Piously Reforming the <HI>Cevennois.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Sir, I desire that I may have leave to continue to be a Friend to
our Theatres, since I have clearly shewn that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is not from his
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
Heart their Enemy; especially since I am convinc'd that the Play-Houses
with all their Immorality and with all their faults, may be instrumental
to the Reforming so Profligate an Age as this.</P>
<P>Thus Doctor, I have sent the summ of the Objections which were
made by <HI>Charles,</HI> to which I desire your Answer, that the Boy who is
Hot, and Opinionated, may not run on in his Error.</P>
<P>As soon as he had done, I took <HI>Harriet</HI> to task, Daughter said I, You
see the Case is very hard upon you and the rest of your Sex, for thus the
Doctor puts it, <HI>Either the Ladies are pleas'd with the Indecencies of the Stage
or they are not. If they are pleas'd, 'tis a hard Imputation on their Virtue. If they
are not pleased, 'twill be enquired why they come there.</HI> For his part, <HI>He con∣fesses
that he has not Logick enough to disengage you.</HI></P>
<P>While I spoke this, I perceived some great alteration in her; you would
have sworm, <HI>her Imagination had been shock'd, her Aversion put into a fit, and
that she underwent much Fatigue of Fancy and Mortification.</HI> To speak more
vulgarly, the Blood began to spring up into her Face, her little Breasts be∣gan
to heave, and she darted a frown that made her awful ev'n to me her
Father. He wants Logick to disengage us, (said she, with a disdainful
Air, after I had just repeated those very Words,) why, then he shall find
that I have more than he has, and that I who have not yet reach'd my
Seventeenth Year, am able to make a very just Apology in behalf of my
self, and all the Women of Condition in <HI>England,</HI> whom he has so basely
affronted. Tho' we are not pleas'd with the Indecencies or Immoralities
of Plays, yet notwithstanding that we frequent them, because some Di∣version
is absolutely necessary for us, and because perhaps ev'n Modern
Plays with all the faults imputed to them, are the most Innocent of the
Diversions which this Town affords.</P>
<P>The Diversions that the Town affords, are chiefly reduc'd to four, 1.
Gaming. 2. Musick-Meetings. 3. Balls and Meetings for Dancing. 4. Go∣ing
to Plays. Now of all these, I am apt to believe that Plays are the most
Innocent, for the following Reasons. They raise the Passions only to cor∣rect
them, whereas the others raise'em merely for the sake of inflaming 'em.
The Plays, and more especially Tragedies instruct us in Virtue, which the
other Diversions do not. They improve us in Lawful Innocent Knowledge,
which in some measure supplies the want of Education in our Sex. They
form our Language, and polish our Minds, and so Capacitate us, when we
come to Marry to engage and endear our Husbands to us. For we every
Day see that only Fools are constant long to Fools. Sir, in short the
Case is thus. Diversions the Ladies of a great Metropolis must have. I
have particulariz'd the several Diversions which this Town affords. All
the Danger, and all the Temptation which this Judicious Persons supposes
to be at the Play-House, are really in all the other Diversions, which have
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
none of the advantages that may be reap'd from Tragedies, for the Im∣provement
either of our Virtue or Knowledge. Why then would this
mighty Reformer have us leave Plays for them? Would he have us have
no Diversion, or would he have us make choice of those which have the
most Temptation?</P>
<P>True Sir, there are passages in some of our Plays which I could heartily
wish were out. But does he think the Virtue of the Ladies who frequent
Play-Houses, is so very weak, as to be o'erthrown by the Lusciousness, as
he calls it, of a Scriblers <HI>Double Entendres.</HI> What have so many great Ex∣amples
as we find on the Stage, so many Noble and Generous Sentiments,
so many accomplish'd patterns of Virtue; Have all these no manner of
pow'r to rouze, to strengthen and inflame our Virtue; and shall two or
three wretched Equivocalls, three or four miserable <HI>Double Entendres</HI>
have the force to corrupt us?</P>
<P>If any of my Sex happen to find themselves so infirm, as this worthy
Reformer appears to own that he is; if two or three ridiculous double
meanings have strength enough to undo them, in spight of those exalted
Heroick Characters, which in my Opinion should be enough to fix our
Affections on Virtue to that degree, that nothing that we meet with abroad
in the World should have the pow'r to move us; if any of my Sex are so
infirm, let them in God's name keep away from our Theatres. But I find
no such scandalous weakness about me. I can despise a Fool who thinks
to entertain me with his sordid playing on Words, but at the same time
can be entertain'd with Wit and good Sense, and more with the Innocence
of true writ Humour, and I can be both pleas'd and mov'd, with the ex∣cellent
Scenes of an Instructive Tragedy: Does this Judicious Person
really believe that the Conversations which we find in the World are
Virtue and Purity all. The Food of the Mind like that of the Body is not all
of it fit for Nourishment. But strong Virtue like strong Nature knows how to
discern and separate, toreject the bad, to assimulate the good by which it is
fed and supported. If any of my Sex have the scandalous weakness to have
their Virtue and their Honour endanger'd by the Folly of <HI>Double Enten∣dres,</HI>
I would advise them to take their leaves of the Play-House. But at
the same time I would advise Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> to perswade his Noble Patrons
of the Reforming Club, to erect a Protestant Nunnery for them, for no∣thing
less can secure them. For they who are found so strangely weak as
to be warm'd by a meer Painted Fire, How can they ever stand against
the real Flames of Love?</P>
<P>How many extraordinary Women may <HI>England</HI> boast of, since Plays
were introduc'd among us? Among whom are three of the greatest Queens
that ever the World produc'd; and all of them took Delight in Plays: How
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
many Ladies of Inferiour Rank have frequented, and still frequent 'em,
who yet in proportion are fam'd for every Virtue. What does this Cha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>table
Person believe of our Mothers, our Aunts and Grandmothers?
Does he believe them Adultresses all because they frequented the Play-House?
But you Sir have Justice to believe better. You knew my Mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
true to your Bed, as she was dear to your Arms. And I beseech you
to have the goodness to believe, that tho' like her I frequent our Theatres,
I will be always Heir to her Virtue, as I am to her likeness.</P>
<P>This Doctor was the sum of what <HI>Harriet</HI> said before she went to the
Play. News is just now brought me that she is come back from that hor∣rid
place, and is gone with <HI>Charles</HI> to my Lady <HI>Freeloves,</HI> and that her
ladyship has sent for me—</P>
<P>Ah dear Doctor, Let me see you to morrow, to receive some Conso∣lation
from you. For here have happen'd two of the most unfortunate
things in the World. For News is brought me from <HI>Piccadilly</HI> that <HI>Jack</HI>
has lost a Thousand Pound at Picket, and <HI>Susan</HI> who went into the Gar∣den
forsooth to Meditate, tho' she went out as black as a Raven, being in
Mourning for her Great Aunt, yet as I hope for Mercy the Jade is return'd
as white and as powder'd, as if she had been hard at work in a Bolting-House.
So that I could wish that for this one Night, they had both been
with <HI>Harriet</HI> and with <HI>Charles</HI> at the Tabernacle of the Wicked.</P>
