<HEAD>A Fourth ESSAY
At Removing
National Prejudices.</HEAD>
<P>I Had not proceeded to discourse any further on the Sub∣ject
of the Union, tho' I have had the Honour to have
my last Essay received with an Approbation I could not
expect, had I not found the Objections so many, so ill ground∣ed,
and some of them so injurious to Truth, that I thought
it was absolutely necessary to say something to them.</P>
<P>I am sorry to see <HI>Scotland</HI> imposed upon, and well-mean∣ing
People possest with Prejudices by things, which really are
put upon them by the Enemies of their general Peace; and
in which not <HI>England</HI> only but themselves are daily ill
treated.</P>
<P>For this reason I am once more in Print on this Subject,
and beg to be heard with patience, in order to remove Pre∣judices;
and as I shall endeavour to merit a favourable
Censure, while I pursue Truth, so I shall ask no favour if I
forsake it.</P>
<P>In the last Essay I laid down four Heads, in which the se∣veral
substantial Parts of the Union between the two King∣doms
consist; and <HI>as I study Brevity,</HI> I only repeat here the
Heads, and how far I have proceeded to consider them apart.
<LIST>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<HEAD>The Heads are,</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Civil Government: In which I reckon is
contain'd Succession, which I call the 4th.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I have touch'd at the first, finish'd what I have to say on
the second, and by the necessity of the Scheme come now to
say something to the last.</P>
<P>The end of that Essay is to remove the radicated Prejudices
of both Nations against the Union of the Kingdoms on all
these Heads.</P>
<P>My whole Design is, to handle it like a Subject of U∣NION;
to treat of Peace with Passion, is one of the most
ridiculous things in my apprehension in the World, inconsi∣stent
with its Nature, and perfectly contrary to the Design:
And I am very sorry to see any Author of a contrary Opi∣nion.</P>
<P>I would have <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> agree like Nations that
may differ, and differ like Nations that may agree: Calm
Reasoning is the best Step to right Discerning, and nothing
but want of Temper can make our Disagreement fatal.</P>
<P>Not that I can suggest such weak things of either Nation,
as to think this Treaty can fall; and I own to see such Pru∣dence
of Method, Fairness of Debate, Leasure and Caution
in Proceeding here, as I cannot think any thing can miscar∣ry
in such hands, which shall conduce to the Nations Bene∣fit
in particular, and the whole Island's Satisfaction.</P>
<P>As for the Imprudence of the Street, 'tis none of my Busi∣ness;
I pity the poor ignorant People, whose eyes are not
always open to their own Happiness: I hope they will not pro∣voke
the Government to any Severities; and if they have
but patience, I doubt not, but like some of their Brethren in
<HI>England,</HI> they will be made happy against their wills.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
I find, as I come to remove Prejudices, I shall meet with
some of the Popular Objections, which in Print have sallyed
out from <HI>England</HI> hither; and if I attempt to overturn them, I
hope I shall meet with no worse Treatment, than I give; and I
freely remit my Method, as well as my Opinion, to the Pub∣lick
Censure.</P>
<P>The first Head I am now upon, is, That of Civil Govern∣ment;
in which I am to Examine a little the Terms of the Uni∣on,
the Reasonableness of it, the Advantages to both Nations,
and the Objections against it.</P>
<P>By the Union, the Civil Affairs as to Government in
<HI>Britain,</HI> are to be Devolved upon one and the same Re∣presentative,
for the true end of all Government, the <HI>Public
Good,</HI>—And as the Nation is to be United into One, their
Public Good must have an Equal and Impartial Respect to
all the parts, or it ceases to be Consonant to its Name, the
<HI>Public Good.</HI></P>
<P>And here I meet with a great deal of Cavil, from se∣veral
Authors, and particularly from a Book said to be
wrote by one Mr. <HI>H</HI>—s, against the Notion of the two
Kingdoms becoming One; I shall not enter the List with a
Man of Mr. <HI>H—ges</HI> Voluminous Character, nor Direct this
Tract as a Dispute against any Body; but it seems needful to
me to Examine here, whether both are not a little mistaken
in their Notions, of the two Kingdoms being brought to be
one Nation, having one Interest, one Heart, and one Inclina∣tion,
<HI>Enquiry Pag:</HI> 25.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H</HI>—s, in his Reflection on this, says the Author of
the <HI>Enquiry,</HI> Insinuates by it, “That a Total Coalition of
the two Kingdoms, shall certainly Annihilate and put an
end to their different National Interests, and Consolidate
them into one Common Interest of both, <HI>p: 3. par:</HI> 5. to go
one with this, he states the Controversie thus; that the <HI>Enquiry</HI>
Affirms, <HI>That by a Coalition their different Interests are to
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
become one, without Distinction.</HI>” And on the contrary, Mr.
<HI>H—s,</HI> “That no Coalition, nor any other possible means,
can ever Unite all their distinct National Interests INTO
ONE Common Interest, without Distinction.”</P>
<P>I must Confess, this seems to me, to be the most trifling
Dispute that ever I have met with, between any Men of
Consideration in this Nation; and its evident to me, that
both their Assertions are equally true, both Erroneous,
and yet both Reconcilable to one another, and particularly
both Motives to, and Explications of the Union; and a small
attempt to enter into the nature of the thing, will bring both
these Gentlemen to be of the same mind; and both their Ar∣guments
may, if the Gentlemen themselves please, be Recon∣ciled
in that one main thing THE UNION.</P>
<P>The Union of the Kingdoms, its true, does not resolve all
their National Interests into <HI>One and the same,</HI> either Mathe∣matically
and Numerically one, or Nationally one, and so if
the Enquiry be made to speak Literally <HI>he is wrong,</HI> for Ex∣ample,
there is not an Oneness in their Ecclesiastical Interests,
as the two Churches, whose Rights are several, and their In∣terests
several and reserv'd: There is not an Oneness in their
respective Administrations of Justice, which in respect to the
several Nations, are different in Manner, in Place, and in all
the Methods of Administration, and so of the several other in∣stances,
of which Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> is very bountiful in the particu∣lars,
I must own, <HI>I</HI> think to very little purpose, because real∣ly
'tis a Nicety of no manner of signification.</P>
<P>But if, Gentlemen, there be an Union, and a Sameness in
the General Interests of the Nations, with respect to these ve∣ry
heads, <HI>I</HI> think 'tis plain, there is <HI>an Oneness of Interests.</HI></P>
<P>For Example, there is not an Oneness of Ecclesiastical Inter∣ests,
as to the respective Principles of the Churches, as <HI>Epis∣copel</HI>
and <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> but there is an Oneness of their General
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Interests <HI>as Protestant;</HI> and it will for ever Unite their Inter∣ests,
so as to make them one Body, with one general Inter∣est,
against all sorts of Superstition, Atheism, Idolatry, Popery,
Heathenism, and the like Common Enemies of the Protestant
Religion; and their different Interests, as Episcopal and Pres∣byterian
being reserv'd, will have no influence, <HI>I am sure need
not, nor ought not,</HI> to interrupt their General Interest, Mutual
Defence and Protection against those Common Enemies.</P>
<P>Thus for a further Example, their different Administrations
of Justice, are reserv'd out of this Oneness, and it is the Inte∣rest
of both Nations, that they be administred in their own
separate manner, in their respective Kingdoms, by their pro∣per
Judges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And what Obstruction is this to the <HI>Oneness
of the General, viz.</HI> That Justice be equally and effectually
administred? <HI>This is the general Interest of the Whole,</HI> and
becomes so by the Union, and is no more interrupted by the
Coalition, than the respective Privileges of several Burroughs
and Corporations in <HI>England,</HI> who Hang and Draw within
themselves, and who reserve to themselves to be exempt from
coming to <HI>London</HI> to the Sovereign Courts, or have Judges of
their Own, as in <HI>Wales, Chester, Durham,</HI> and the like, hin∣der,
that <HI>England</HI> has all their National Interests <HI>Ʋnited into
One.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The End of all is,</HI> That Justice be impartially administred,
and the Reserve of Places or Persons makes no manner of
Breach in the <HI>Ʋnity of Interests,</HI> and this I think, will bring
Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> and the Enquirer together, to mean the same
thing, or be both mistaken: <HI>Let them make the Choice.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> to make good his Point like other Dispu∣tants,
when they have weak Arguments, runs into one of
the worst sort of Unhappinesses that a Man who claims fair
Arguing can fall into, and that is, want of Truth—and to
make good a weak Assertion, assumes a false one. I am sorry
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
to say a thing so severe of a Gentleman, I am a Stranger
to, and who once deserv'd well of this Kingdom; but 'twill
be my Station in this Essay, to oppose nothing but direct Pre∣sumptions
and Assertions without Truth.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He affirms, That whatever Agreement is now concluded
between the two Kingdoms, will never be binding to the
New Parliament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the two Kingdoms effectually subject themselves to
the New Parliament, all the Conditions stipulated on ei∣ther
side to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These are hard things to alledge against a whole Nation,
and can have no Ground but a radicated Prejudice. The
Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> are strangely represented here, and I
think I need say no more, than what I have said already.</P>
<P>The Foundation of that Parliament, is, this Treaty; to say,
They will not be bound by it, is to say, they will pull them∣selves
up by the Roots: they dye when the Union receives a∣ny
mortal Wound, and this Constitution Doctrine, over∣throws
all the Notions of what the Parliament may do against
you.</P>
<P>They can not infringe one Article of the Union; they can
not put a Question in the House upon any one Article.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen have insinuated here, That they may think
fit to bring <HI>Episcopacy</HI> into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I take upon me to affirm, They cannot put that Question in
the House.—If any Man should move it, they can not enter
on the Debate; they shake their own Foundation in the very
Thought; every Motion is an Earthquake under the Pillars
of the House, and the moment they should do it, they like
<HI>Samson</HI> pull the House down upon their own Heads.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> cannot enter into an Enquiry
whether they are a Parliament or no; for their being a Par∣liament,
only gives them power to be there. Now, how
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
will they come to be a Parliament?—and enquiring into this,
will bring me to another Absurdity of Mr. <HI>H—s, viz.</HI> That
this Union is an entire dissolving the Constitution of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and surrendring it bound Hand and Foot into the absolute
Dispose of the <HI>English.</HI> This is such a Contradiction, and so
plainly clear'd by the Treaty, that no Man can think so
roughly, but he that on purpose shuts his eyes against his Rea∣son
I'll state it by way of Question and Answer; the Cate∣chism
is short, let no man be loth to learn it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is it constitutes the Parliament of <HI>Britain?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Ʋnion. <HI>Let any Man give another Answer to it if he can.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is it constituted?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By Treaty <HI>between two Nations by their Heads and Repre∣sentatives,</HI>
viz. <HI>the Queen and Parliament of each Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How do they bring it to pass?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By mutually dissolving their respective Constitutions, and
forming one general Constitution upon a Treaty of Equalities
and Equivalents; the Stipulations of which Treaty are agreed
to be the Constituent Part of the subsequent Body.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Ʋpon what Right doth the present respective Parliaments depend?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Natural Right of the Free-holders of both King∣doms,
which entitules them by the Possession of their Lands
to have the free Exercise and Power of making the Laws by
which they are to be governed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Does this new Constitution destroy that Right?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not at all, but reserving that Right, which indeed it
cannot destroy, agrees to limit the Exercise of it by such and
such Forms, and on such and such Conditions, which Con∣ditions
are the Limitations of the Power of the new Parlia∣ment,
as being the Act and Deed of the old Parliaments,
whose Constitution was founded on Original Right.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
I think this Connexion is plain and very just; and as it
will admit no Objection, so it however brings me to the next
Thing of Course, which the other Gentlemen are driven to
by the necessity of the Argument.</P>
<P>And that is, That the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
by consequence of <HI>England</HI> too, have not a Power to go into
this Union—And <HI>H—s</HI> says p. 62. “That 'tis not in the
Power of the <HI>Scots</HI> Government to conclude such an Union
without a manifest Violation of Trust, and without doing
a manifest Act of Injustice, Oppression and Usurpation a∣gainst
the Fundamental Rights and Liberties of this free
Nation.”</P>
<P>This is Pleading to the Jurisdiction of a Court, which in
all Ages all Courts of Justice, tho Inferiour far to Parliament,
do not allow; and the Parliament or Government of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
needs not at all, that I should defend or explain what
they have or have not power to do.</P>
<P>But I shall speak two things here—<HI>First,</HI> How absurdly
do these Men argue! They will not allow the Parliament of
<HI>Scotland</HI> can break into the Constitution, or meddle with
Fundamentals; and yet they will have it be, that the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Britain</HI> shall have Power to undo its own Foundation,
and break the Articles of Union, by which it is to have its
Being. This is not fair Dealing at all.</P>
<P>But a little help will reconcile all this: It is most true, and
I grant it readily, That the Government of no Nation can
take away the Original Right of the People; and I am per∣swaded
the Parliament will not take it ill, if I say, they can∣not
make a Law, that the Free-holders of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall not
have a Right to be governed by their own Laws, that is a
Voice in the making them, by Representatives, and enjoy the
Liberty of their Persons, Property of their Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
But shall it therefore follow, they shall not have Power to
determine the Circumstances of these things, which are the
Consequences of a Representative; as how many they shall be
represented by, who has a Right to be represented, and who
not, and the like?</P>
<P>To bring this home, 'tis not in the Power of Parliament to
dispossess any Free-holder, without Conviction of a Crime
committed of his Right of being represented; and yet
'tis in the Power of Parliament to dispossess all the
Burghs, Towns, Cities and Corporations in <HI>Britain,</HI> of their
Right of being represented at all.</P>
<P>The Reason is plain; the Right of a Free-holder is an Ori∣ginal,
'tis claim'd by his Possession, which is to be trac'd
back to God Almighty's first Donation, when he gave Man
Possession of the Earth to him and his Heirs, and bid him pos∣sess
and subdue it <HI>Gen.</HI> 1▪ that is, Govern it; from whence
'tis easy to deduce the Right of all Government in the World,
to depend upon the Legal Possession of the solid, <HI>Anglico,</HI> the
Free-hold—If any single Man was able to purchase, and
had purchased all the Land in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he would be King by
Divine Right; he would be himself the whole Parliament by
Natural Consequence, and the whole Power of Legislature
would be in himself.</P>
<P>But the Right of the Towns and Corporations is a conce∣ded
Right granted to them either by the Custom of the Nati∣on,
permitting the Monarch, or by Gift of the Free-holders,
which Gift may be resum'd by the same Parliamentary Au∣thority.</P>
<P>And there are Instances of this in memory, when the Par∣liament
of <HI>England</HI> have suspended a Town from sending
Representatives for a whole Session; as the Town of <HI>Maid∣stone,
Anno</HI> 1704, the Town of—in the same Year;
and a Debate long in the House, and I think a Bill brought
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the House once about the Year 1697, to deprive the
Burrough of <HI>Stockbridge</HI> of their Claim of being represented in
Parliament.</P>
<P>As then the Parliament have Power to take away the Right
of Towns, they have a Right also to prescribe the Number
of Persons by whom the Free-holders are to be represented;
and if this be not so, I desire to know, how the Number
came at first to be settled.</P>
<P>But to go further, I would ask, If the Parliament have
not power to divide one County into two or more, when too
large, or join them when too small? If this be doubted, I
could give several Instances of it in <HI>England,</HI> as of <HI>Richmond∣shire,</HI>
which is now join'd to <HI>York-shire,</HI> and only represented
by the two <HI>York-shire</HI> Members.</P>
<P>If any Man shall doubt, whether the Free-holders are
fairly represented when their Number is reduc'd. I shall
answer, 'Tis not the fewness of Persons chosen, which deno∣minate
a Representative—but the freedom of Choice: If
every Free-holder has his Voice in the Election, he is as du∣ly
represented in two, as two hundred; And <HI>York-shire,</HI>
which is twenty times as large as <HI>Rutland-shire</HI> in <HI>England,</HI>
chooses but two Knights of the Shire, and is as compleatly re∣presented
as the other.</P>
<P>Thus 'tis plain, the Parliament must be allowed to judge
of the Circumstances of that Right, which they cannot dis∣solve.</P>
<P>And this brings me to that Great Question, on which this
whole Affair turns; and for want of examining which right∣ly,
much of this Clamour among us is unhappily raised, <HI>viz.</HI>
Whether this Union is a Limiting the Circumstances of
Native Right, or a compleat Dissolution overturning and re∣signing
the Native Right it self?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Mr. <HI>Hodge</HI> affirms in a multitude of Places, and with
unusual Assurance, That to Incorporate with <HI>England,</HI> is a
compleat resigning up the National Freedom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Pag.
63, 58, 62, 16. and in divers other Places; and to Illustrate
it when he would fain bring it to interfere with the National
Covenant he brings this admirable Simily sutable to his usual
way of Arguing.</P>
<P>He alleges, That taking a National Oath, obliges the
“<HI>Scots</HI> to keep themselves a distinct Nation, and after quib∣ling
with the Word, <HI>National,</HI> he puts a Case, Whether a
Man bound by Oath to the well Managing his Affairs, or
about something relating to the Management of his own
Affairs, can without falsifying his Oath, quite the Manage∣ment
of his own Affairs, and commit them wholly to the
disposal of another?”</P>
<P>Now, I'll appeal to all the World, whether he had not
more exactly suted the Purpose, if he had thought fit, to have
stated it thus, Whether a Man bound by Oath to the best
Management of his Affairs, may not without falsifying that
Oath, join with another for his Help and Assistance, in order
to the better Management of those Affairs?</P>
<P>To say, 'tis resigning his Interest to the absolute Disposal
of the other, because Govern'd by a Majority, is first, False in
Fact; secondly, Lame in Argument.—'Tis false in Fact,
in the Case before us; for where there is a Treaty and stipu∣lated
Conditions, there can be no absolute Disposal, 'tis a
Contradiction, and nothing can bring that Article to bear,
but saying, <HI>The Major Part may Tyrannize.</HI> 'Tis therefore
Lame in Argument, for if we are arguing the Legal Founda∣tion,
'tis no Argument at all to say, That Foundation may
be illegally broken, but it can not be legally broken: The
Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> is to be said, not to be able to do
what they cannot legally do.—If Mr. <HI>Hodge</HI> resolves to have
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
it so, that they shall be all Thieves, Robbers, and meer Moss
Troopers, <HI>I cannot help that;</HI> he shall have it so if he will,
and then indeed they are not fit to be United with at all, and
his <HI>Foederal Ʋnion</HI> will be as Lame as t'other; But I appeal
to all judicious Men, whether in Point of Argument, 'tis not
to be allow'd to say, They cannot do, what they cannot
legally do, what they cannot do without Invasion, Oppres∣sion,
and Tyranny?</P>
<P>Three Men go in Partnership in Trade, they draw up Ar∣ticles,
Incorporate their Stocks and proceed to Business.</P>
<P>'Tis conditioned between them, that Majority of
their Voices, shall in all things decide any Dispute, and
Govern in the disposing their Stock, and carrying on their
Trade.</P>
<P>Now, does this give any Two of the Partners a Power to
Vote, that the Third shall leave his Stock to them, and have
no share of the Trade? this would be Robbery and Cheat,
and the Man would Plead his Articles.—The meaning of
the Partnership is overthrown, which was for mutual Profit,
not to Cheat one another, the Articles are broke, and the
Man has a Right to set up by himself as he was before.</P>
<P>All the Error therefore of these People, arises from this
Notion, that the Original Right of the Free-holder, to be
represented, is given up, which is manifestly False, it being
retain'd in all its Exercise, only the Circumstance of the Re∣presentative
altered, which by Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> Rule, must be
committed to the Parliament by their Constituents, since (as
he says) <HI>The Constituent cannot Limit or Restrain his Represen∣tative,
but hands him all the Power he himself enjoys.</HI> P. 62.</P>
<P>The Treaty of Union between the Nations, is of mutual
Incorporation, Coalition and Conjunction, which is a Com∣munication
of Privileges, Advantages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The true mean∣ing
is, not that one should be Slaves to the other; should
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<HI>England,</HI> under the Shelter of a Majority of Voices, attempt the
Enslaving <HI>Scotland,</HI> and assault the Articles of Stipulation, In∣vade
the Treaty, and break in upon the Conditions by Vio∣lence.—The
Consequence is plain, the Partnerships is
broke, the Union is dissolv'd of Course, and the Invaders be∣come
Tyrants and Oppressors.</P>
<P>To Argue then, that it is possible, is not to the pur∣pose,
I have spoken to it already in the last Essay, and it needs
not to be repeated; The Question is, Whether it can be le∣gally
done?</P>
<P>As to the Arguments brought to prove it probable, that
<HI>England</HI> should impose upon <HI>Scotland;</HI> what I have hitherto
seen, are very strange Ones, and such as I am loth to repeat,
they are so unsutable to two Sister Nations Treating of Union,
that I really wonder at the Gentlemen that publish them.</P>
<P>Such as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That <HI>England</HI> will be bound by no Conditions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> will subject you with∣out
any regard to the Treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That two establish'd Churches are Inconsistent:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That <HI>England</HI> is a Nation too Wicked to join with, and
that you will take upon you the Guilt of their Natio∣nal
Crimes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That if you agree to Equivalents, they will Cheat you,
for they will never pay you the Money—and the
like.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To support these most abominable Practices, they advance
horrid Forgeries, plain and easie to be Contradicted.</P>
<P>For Example, Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> p. 60. affirms, “That the Sa∣cramental
Test, is that whereby all People are to qualify
themselves for making them capable to be Members of Par∣liament,”
according to the Law of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And to Exaggerate this, he goes on; “This Law so re∣maining
unaltered, the first thing the <HI>Scots</HI> Members are
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
presented with at their coming up to their New Parliament
is the Sacramental Test.”</P>
<P>“If they take it, <HI>says he,</HI> What becomes of the Kirk of <HI>Scot∣land?</HI>”
If they refuse it, who must supply their Places?</P>
<P>Had the Gentleman wrote this in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he might
have wanted Information, either from Men or Books, he
might have made some tolerable Excuse for thus imposing
upon the World; and a Man would have been apt to have
past it over lightly: but to write this at <HI>London,</HI> and pre∣tend
to be acquainted there, to pretend to give Characters of
the Place, the People, and their Sins, and yet fall into a Sin,
few there but himself would be Guilty of.—What shall I say,
for such a Man?—'Tis an ungrateful Office to be always
raking in the <HI>Lay-stalls</HI> of Mens Extravagancies; and I do
not love the Employment; But who can help detecting a
thing, when he tells a Tale, a Man may feel with his foot, and
brings such open Falsities upon the Stage of the World, that
the Children in the very Street can contradict?</P>
<P>To say, the Members of Parliament take the Test, 'tis all
one as to say, the Tide flows into <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Castle, or a Fleet
of Sheep sail'd over <HI>Coldingham</HI> Muir, 'tis what was never
heard of in <HI>England;</HI> and if I should tell in <HI>England,</HI> that such
a thing had been Printed and Published in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they
would be very hard to believe me.</P>
<P>On the other hand, 'tis horribly treating <HI>Scotland</HI> her self,
and imposing upon the Gentlemen there in a manner they
ought to take very ill.</P>
<P>In short, I take it upon me to say, 'Tis utterly False, and
God knows the Author's design in asserting it; there is no
such Law in <HI>England,</HI> as requires the Members of Parliament
to take the Sacramental Test, nor ever was; and I dare under∣take
to Name to this Author, several Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI>
in every Session, that have been Members of Parliament that
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
never took the Sacrament in the Church of <HI>England</HI> in their
Lives: And <HI>Alderman Love,</HI> who serv'd about 20 years for
the City of <HI>London;</HI> and also was in the House when that
Act was made, is one of them.</P>
<P>Assure your selves Gentlemen, there neither is, nor ever
was any such thing in the House, and I trust never will.—And
'tis plain, when in but two Parliaments ago, one <HI>Ares∣dale</HI>
a Quaker, was chosen a Member for the Burgh of <HI>High∣wickham,</HI>
he came to the House, but refused to take the Oath,
as a thing against his Principle; and it was Debated in the
House, whether his Affirmation could be taken in stead
of his Oath, but past in the Negative. Now Gentle∣men,
had it been a refusal of the Sacramental Test, it would
never have admitted a Debate in the House, whether he
should have been receiv'd without it, for they could not
have done it.</P>
<P>This is one of the Forgeries imposed upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the
Enemies of her Tranquillity, and a certain Demonstration,
that they suffer a Famine of Argument, and are forc'd to
have recourse to a Refuge, that no Man of Honour can bear
the Thought of.</P>
<P>Then Gentlemen, you must not Unite with us, for we are
a Wicked Notorious People, <HI>Sodom</HI> was a Fool to us, and
GOD will plague you for our National Sins.</P>
<P>This is a horrid Blasphemous Suggestion upon the Divine
and Immutable Justice, as well as an unaccountable Reflecti∣on
upon <HI>England;</HI> and this, as it is Extravagant in it self, I
beg the Reader to take notice, how Unhappily, I mean, as to
his own Reputation, the Author has founded his Argument
here.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He believes it, because he heard a Godly Man there
Confess it in his Prayer.</ITEM>

Sermon.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>As to what a Minister in his Warmth of Confession, about
National Crimes, might say, 'tis but a sorry Foundation, as
to Argument: But I'll lay it more fairly down, and I'll con∣fess
for <HI>England,</HI> that 'tis a Sinful Nation, and perhaps there
are Greater Sins there, than here. I'll grant it, whether so or
no; I believe both have yet cause enough to lay by the Pha∣risaical
Method of <HI>stand off, I am more Holy than thou,</HI> and ap∣ply
our selves to General, National, and Personal Reforma∣tion.</P>
<P>But give me leave to Detect the Author of this Libel, for
I can call it no other, in One thing as to Reformation.</P>
<P><HI>England,</HI> Bad as she is, is yet a Reforming Nation, and I
prove it by the very thing this Author accuses her of—The
Work of Reformation has made more Progress in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
from the Court, even to the Street, than I believe any
Nation in the World can parallel in such a time, and in such
Circumstances: Let any Man look back to the days of K. <HI>Ch.</HI>
the 2d. when Rampant Vice ouer-run that Court; when all
sort of Lewdness spread the Face of Authority; let them view
the Royal Example of the late Glorious Pair K. <HI>William</HI> and
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> how Vice learnt to Blush, and being Banish'd
from Court by the Royal Example, Virtue and Good Man∣ners
became the Mode there: Let them look into the Ex∣amples
now Reigning, and tell me what Crime is Encourag∣ed
by Her Majesty: Is it nothing to Dethrone the Devil, and
Depose his reigning Agents? disarm the Factors of Hell, and
Banish rampant Vice?—Let them look at what Strength,
Crime was arriv'd to in <HI>England,</HI> by the help of some Mo∣narchs;
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
<HI>Scotland ought not to blame</HI> England <HI>for,</HI> and com∣pare
what she is, to what she was.</P>
<P>Let this Gentleman please <HI>Next</HI> to look back to the late
General Bent of the Land, to Universal Drunkness, when a Per∣son
of Quality would like no Servant, nor a Servant like a
Master, that would not be Drunk; when a Man would not
think himself Welcome at my House, if I did not make him
Drunk, nor believe I thought my self Welcome at his, if he
did not make me Drunk.</P>
<P>If these Vices are in their extremes Dethron'd, then <HI>England</HI>
is in the right Way; and 'tis hoped by an Union, you will
help us forward to Reformation.</P>
<P>The Societies for Reformation, which this Gentleman
Scandalizes, are another Proof of his Ignorance of <HI>England,</HI>
and his Injustice to that Nation; the Advances they have
made, <HI>Are not sensible,</HI> says he. I assure you, they are very
Sensible to every one that pleases to Examine what Havock
they have made with Street-lewdness; how they have rooted
out the Stews and Fountains of Publick Vice; How they
have erected Charity Schools, and caused Numbers of Va∣grant
and Poor Children, who would have been left to the
Street, and to all manner of Vice, and perhaps some to the
Gallows, to be taught better Manners and Religion, instruct∣ed,
and <HI>in Contradiction to Mr.</HI> Hodges <HI>Assertion, CATE∣CHISED;</HI>
in short, well brought up, carefully put out to
Trades, and Great Sums of Money applyed to do it, and so
at last introduc'd into the World in a Religious and sober
manner, and saved from Ruine, Soul and Body. And I do
assure him, there are above 1500 of these Children now un∣der
their Care in <HI>London</HI> only, Cloth'd, Taught, Catechised,
and Instructed at their Charge.</P>
<P>I could fill a large History of the Progress of this Society,
and of the perpetual Methods they take, both with Poor and
Rich, to Discountenance all kinds of Vice; and how really it
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
does Discountenance it, to the Honour of the Protestant Re∣ligion,
and the Glory of the <HI>English</HI> Nation in particular;
but this is enough <HI>to detect a Slanderer.</HI></P>
<P>I might search History a little, and re-mind you, how that
when K. <HI>Charles</HI> proposed this very Union, in the year 1669,
The Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> in his Speech, told the Parliament, That
the King had now offered them a Treaty; and in describing
what kind of Treaty it was, he tells them, “That the many
Meetings on former Treaties, produc'd no Effect, unless it were
a Conviction of the Difficulty, if not impossibility of setting
it in any other way,” than by a nearer and compleat Ʋnion
of the two Kingdoms, History of <HI>England,</HI> Vol. 3. Fol. 275, 276.</P>
<P>I am sorry to see such a general Rumage made for Reasons,
why the Union should not be made: But I confess, I am
glade to see the Objectors driven to <HI>such Shifts for Argument,</HI>
that they must make use of Forgery, Falsity, Slander, and
Reproach.—I am sure, these things will go but a little
way with Wise Men: The Nature of a Falsity is to expose
it self, and at last its Author, and always leaves the Cause
<HI>'tis brought to Defend,</HI> worse than it found it.</P>
<P>It remains to enquire,—What are the several
Interests that Press this Union? And where had the
first Thoughts its Birth, who are they seek it, and for
what Design? Because 'tis alledged, that 'tis proposed by
no Body that are Friends to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But I shall go no further back for it, than King <HI>William;</HI> and
here I shall observe, <HI>England</HI> never proposed it to you, but
when she her self was under the Best, the Wisest, and the
most Christian Conduct that ever she was in, as in the days
of King <HI>Edward</HI> 6. and King <HI>William;</HI> when ever we have
been under the Eruption of Popery and Tyranny we never
inclined to Unite with you; but when ever Love, Charity▪
and Moderation prevail'd, we have always inclin'd to Peace
and Coalitions.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
I doubt, those Gentlemen, who charge this as a Plot in
<HI>England,</HI> to devour <HI>Scotland,</HI> forget, that in the Revolution
the Estates of <HI>Scotland</HI> were the first and earnest Movers of
the very manner of the Union, as now treated of. Those
very Gentlemen that under the Influence of that Glorious
Head King <HI>William</HI> had their eyes open to the Nations true
Interest, that restor'd the Liberty and Religion of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
that saw clearly the Interest both of the Church and State;
those very Men in their Letter to King <HI>William,</HI> were the first
that (His Majesty having in his first Letter mentioned it
in general) descended to describe, what sort of an Union
was best for this Nation, and tell the King they should be
glad of an Union, provided it were so and so.</P>
<P>And I cannot but look back to this Circumstance, to open
the eyes of some Gentlemen who are too forward to say, It
was never propos'd by those that wish'd well to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI> was the first Proposer of it in our time, and
that in his very first Letter to the Convention of Estates of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and the first Letter of the Estates to His Majesty,
<HI>then not received King of</HI> Scotland, declares an Union to be
one of the best Means <HI>for securing the Happiness of these Nati∣ons,
and settling a lasting Peace.</HI> Act of Parl: of <HI>Scotland</HI> Fo. 7.
in their second Letter, when the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> was offer∣ed
to King <HI>William,</HI> the Estates have this Expression:</P>
<P>“We are most sensible of Your Majesty's Kindness and
Fatherly Care in promoving the Union, which we hope
hath been reserv'd to be accomplish'd by you; that as both
Kingdoms are united in one Head and Sovereign, so they
may become One Body Politick, One Nation to be Repre∣sented
in One Parliament: And to testify Our Readiness
to comply with Your Majesty in this Matter, we have no∣minated
Commissioners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if any Difficulty shall a∣rise
in the Treaty, we do upon our part refer the Determi∣nation
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
thereof to Your Majesty.—<HI>Ibid.</HI> Fo. 30.” With
what Face now can these Men call this a Contrivance of the
Enemies of <HI>Scotland?</HI> I am perswaded the Author is a great∣er
Enemy to <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> in this Particular, than any
of those Noble Patriots of their Country were, who at the
Revolution made that Offer.</P>
<P>It is plain, no other Ʋnion than this is practicable between
the Nations: They talk of their Federal Ʋnion; and this Au∣thor
says, He can offer one, but reserves it <HI>in petto</HI>—The
Wisdom of both Nations have determin'd this to be not the
best, but the only foot to make a safe Treaty upon: And I
must own upon the strictest Examination I can make, I see
neither Safety, Advantage or Satisfaction in any of their o∣ther
Proposals to either Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. H.</HI> ... gives us a List, as he calls it, of one and twen∣ty
interfeiring Interests, in opposition of the Enquirer's, saying,
We should have but one Interest.</P>
<P>To me this is most strange Cavilling: I'll allow him dif∣ferent
Interests; and yet I may affirm for the other side,
there may be but one National Interest: And I can give him
innumerable interfereing Interests in one Part of <HI>England,</HI> with
another, and yet <HI>England</HI> may be said to have but one Nati∣onal
Interest, which the whole is subservient to.—</P>
<P>Now 'tis a Question I have often put in private Conversa∣tion,
and could never yet get an Answer to.—Is there any
One National Interest in <HI>England</HI> or in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that is incon∣sistent
with another National Interest in the other Kingdom;
and that <HI>being so,</HI> makes the Union necessarily impracticable
without one Side or other being opprest?</P>
<P>Let me pursue this Enquiry, for much will depend upon
it to dissolve the Probabilities assum'd by these Authors a∣gainst
the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> preserving the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Pray, Gentlemen, let me enquire into this Head, Why the
Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> should oppress <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in what?
Which are the National Interests that will clash and prompt
the Parliament to be partial, and oppress you?</P>
<P>The Church Interests cannot be the thing, for they are res∣pectively
secur'd, or will be so in the Body of the Treaty,
which Treaty <HI>as before</HI> the Parliament cannot touch, nor
put a Question about.</P>
<P>As to the Laws, they are reserv'd in each Country, and,
the Courts of Justice already settled, are to remain so.</P>
<P>To say, The <HI>English</HI> Lawyers will be for bringing up all
your Suits at Law to <HI>London,</HI> to bring them Business, is an
Absurdity in the Nature of it, and not worth notice. 'Tis
plain, the Law in <HI>England</HI> is not brought to the Lawyers, but
the Lawyers are fain to turn itenerat, and ride a Cause job∣bing
over the whole Nation; the Judges go Circuites, and
Justice is carried home to every Man's door: no Man is
bound to sue or be sued, plead or be impleaded, but in the
County where he lives; no Man shall be tried for Murther,
but in the County where the Fact was committed. And a
famous Robber not now 3 Months since, obtaining to be tried
at the Old Bayly for a Robbery, was found guilty of the
Robbery, but as committed in the County of <HI>Essex,</HI> and ef∣cap'd
the Gallows by it, because a Jury in <HI>Middlesex</HI> could
not condemn him for a Crime committed out of the County;
and they could not carry him down into <HI>Essex,</HI> because the
Law says, <HI>No Man shall be tried twice for the same Fact.</HI></P>
<P>Shall then the <HI>English</HI> in meer spleen to the <HI>Scots</HI> alter the
whole Scheme of Justice? and when the Judges come down
quite to <HI>Newcastle</HI> to do Justice, fetch the <HI>Scots</HI> up to <HI>London,</HI>
on purpose to be vexatious—What sort of Suggestions are
these? At best, were you entirely subjected, we should send
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
our Judges to your several Towns, as in <HI>England;</HI> or make
Judges on purpose for you, as in <HI>Wales.</HI> But <HI>England</HI> is fully
satisfied and pleased to reserve to you all your own Courts
and Methods of Justice; and it can never be her National
Interest to alter it.</P>
<P>Where then are these interfeiring Interests? they must
lie in Trade sure, or I know not where we shall find them?
And I would be glad to know of the wisest Objector, in
what part of Trade <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> can have <HI>as Nations</HI>
any interfeiring Interests? I know, in <HI>England</HI> 'tis objected,
you will run into their Woollen Manufactures, and so I be∣lieve
you will, to buy them: But I appeal to common know∣ledge,
Gentlemen, whether there is in <HI>Scotland</HI> the least pro∣pensity
that way, I mean as to a General Trade.</P>
<P>And the Reason is plain, You have no occasion for it, if
you can fall in to make your own Cloths well and good, and
you will never trouble your selves so much as to do that, for
you have better things before you.</P>
<P>The Linnen Manufacture on Shoar, your Fishing at Sea,
and your Plantation Trade beyond Sea, are Oceans of Wealth
you will swim in, and cannot launch out too far, and in none
of these will you interfere with <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>England</HI> with you.—</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> will help you in them all, and your Wealth will
circulate thro' their hands—They immediately lose 17000 <HI>per
Annum</HI> by you in one Article, the Duty upon your Linnen, you
carry all your Linnen into their Ports <HI>free,</HI> when all other Lin∣nen
pays 12, 10, 16 <HI>per Cent</HI> Duty; and' tis your own faults,
if your Linnen Trade does not employ your whole Kingdom,
as the Woollen Trade does <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Not a Nation in the World imports so much Linnen of all
sorts as <HI>England;</HI> and if <HI>Scotland</HI> fall heartily to work upon
it, and by Directions learn to imitate the several kinds now
in use. The <HI>Dutch</HI> may have other Reasons to be against the
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Union, than the Damage of their Fishery: <HI>Scotland</HI> may with
ease Vent a Million <HI>per Annum</HI> in <HI>England</HI> in their Linnen
Manufacture.</P>
<P>But the <HI>English</HI> Parliament may renew the Duty, say the
same Gentlemen Objectors.</P>
<P>That cannot be without breach of the Union, for all Cu∣stoms
are to be taken off between the Nations, and a free
Communication of Trade: If therefore a Tax be laid on Lin∣nen,
it must be upon all Linnen made in <HI>England;</HI> for it was
never known, that any Manufacture was tax'd in one Place,
and let free in another.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine therefore one Article, in which the Ge∣neral
Interest of the two Kingdoms can clash with one ano∣ther.
Let's view the several Channels of their Trade.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> abounds in Woollen Manufactures, and the <HI>Scots</HI>
want them: <HI>Scotland</HI> abounds in Linnen, and <HI>England</HI> wants
that: <HI>Scotland</HI> has the Fund of the Fishery, the Fish, the Men,
the Harbours, the Nets; and <HI>England</HI> has thirsted to fall into
that Trade for several Ages; they cannot clash there.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> has Wool, <HI>England</HI> buys all the Wool in the World,
if they'll bring it thither: <HI>Scotland</HI> has Corn, <HI>England</HI> buys
a prodigious Quantity, and sends it Abroad again.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> has Coal, <HI>Newcastle</HI> will be sorry, but the <HI>Scots</HI>
Coal will never want a Market at <HI>London,</HI> while the Ladies
keep Fires in their Nurseries and Chambers.</P>
<P>In all this I cannot see the least probability of a Clash be∣tween
the two Nations. And I would be glad to have any
of the Gentlemen on the other side tell us one Head of Trade,
in which it is morally probable, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> should
disagree, interfere, or be jealous of one another. If then their
Interest agree, how can they differ? Interest reconciles all
the Enmities in the World; and no Nation but ours act
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
against their Interest. If it be our mutual Interest to agree, I
cannot see why we should differ.</P>
<P>But then these Gentlemen come with a weighty Objection
against the number of the Representatives; and the Author
of the State of the Controversy, the Observations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> are all exceeding turbulent on that Head.</P>
<P>One says, 'Tis subjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> Nation;
Others say, 'Tis subjecting the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to Episco∣pacy;
Others, That 'tis no sufficient security to you. And
Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> is very learned upon the Inequality of the Propor∣tion,
and says, <HI>Scotland</HI> is not fairly represented. My An∣swer
shall be brief on this head, because I think 'tis answered
in it self.</P>
<P>As to subjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> in Church and State to the <HI>English</HI>
Nation, I think I have answer'd it in entring before on the
nature of the Treaty, and the nature of the subsequent Par∣liament,
in which every thing for the Safety and Liberty of
<HI>Scotland</HI> that can be demanded, is reserv'd out of the Power
of Parliament; and this I undertake to join Issue upon when
they please, and to defend: For where there are Conditions,
there can be no subjecting a Nation, or any Surrender of Right,
as is vainly alleg'd, they are Contradictions in their nature:
<HI>England</HI> subjects themselves to the Crown, and yet <HI>England</HI>
is called a free Nation, and is so: 'Tis on Condition to be go∣verned
so and so, and the Crown is bound by it: Does <HI>En∣gland</HI>
surrender their Liberties, is she not tenacious of them to
the last degree? How absurd is this way of Arguing?</P>
<P>That a Treaty is no sufficient Security, I have fully an∣swer'd,
in that it cannot be broken by the Parliament, with∣out
dissolving themselves, and destroying all manner of Right
and regard to Justice in their own Nation as well as in this.</P>
<P>As to the Proportion of Members, about which Mr. <HI>H—s</HI>
is so very particular, it may be necessary to examine a little in∣to
it.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
I shall not enter into the Enquiry, Whether Payment of
Taxes, and the measure of Wealth in a Nation be the best
way of determining this Matter, or no? Let Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> and
him alone to fight out that Affair, tho' as the Power of a Na∣tion
is now more consistent in its Wealth than People. Much
more might be said on that Head.</P>
<P>Nor will I deny, but even in <HI>England,</HI> that Part of our Re∣presentative,
which relates to Burrows, is not so well poized
as to <HI>England</HI> it self, as I wish it were, the Fate of Towns
Trade, and differing Providences having alter'd the Face of
that Nation very much since the last Settlement of their Re∣presentative.</P>
<P>But I'll go back beyond this; Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> and I agree, That
the Inheritance carries with it the Right of being represented,
that is of being governed by Laws of our own making; and
that this is a Right, the Heretors, or as I call them, Free-hol∣ders,
cannot be divested of, no, nor can divest themselves of;
and that they are not at all divested of it in this Parliament,
I have already prov'd.</P>
<P>I shall now prove, That on this Foundation neither Lords
nor Commons in <HI>Scotland</HI> receive any real Injury in the pro∣portioned
Number now speaking of, and that there is no bet∣ter
or more rational way of Judging.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> has to my hand own'd, That a Free-holder is
not to be reckon'd by the Value or by the Rent of his Free-hold
at all, but by the Poll; and a Free-holder of 40 <HI>l. per
Annum</HI> by that Law must have as much Right to a Voice in
choosing a Representative, as he that has 40000 <HI>l. per Ann▪</HI> and
in <HI>England</HI> it is so.</P>
<P>Now I'll take it either way, and let any Gentleman make
an Estimate, either of the Value of the Free-holds, or of their
number of Free-holders in <HI>England</HI> or in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and I un∣dertake
to prove, that the Representative allotted in the
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> is a full Proportion, and rather over
than under.</P>
<P>Now because in both Kingdoms the Nobility and Knights
of the Shire are the only Representative of the Free-hold; and
the Members of Corporations are not concern'd in it; yet as
the several Burghs or Corporations are by Grant from the
Free-hold, they may be consider'd together, as representing
Persons qualified to be Free-holders by their Wealth, and
serviceable to it by their Commerce.</P>
<P>Take then the Knights of Shires in <HI>Scotland</HI> against the
Knights of Shires in <HI>England,</HI> or take the whole 45, as if
chosen by the Heretors in <HI>Scotland,</HI> againct the 513, as if
chosen by the Free-holders in <HI>England,</HI> and it will appear the
Proportion is every way to the Advantage of <HI>Scotland</HI>—And
if these Gentlemen will tell us, which Handle they will take
it by, they are welcome to make the Calculate as soon as they
please.</P>
<P>The Annual rents in <HI>England</HI> are supposed to make 12 Mil∣lions,
of which I account 5 Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> to be free-hold:
The number of Free-holders in <HI>England</HI> may be guest at by
examining the Poll, where we have found the Counties of
<HI>Suffolk, Kent, Essex,</HI> and several others, have often poll'd near
6000 Free-holders each, and <HI>York-shire,</HI> as I have heard, 19000.
As to the Value of Free-holds or Numbers of Free-holders
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I leave that to the Calculation of others.</P>
<P>And if then by either the Value of Free hold, or the number
of Free-holders in <HI>Britain,</HI> the Proportion for <HI>Scotland</HI> is just, I
can see no room for all the Objections now made against the
Representative, as proportioned by the Union. Indeed Mr.
<HI>Hodges</HI> his Proposition of stating the Free-hold of Understand∣ing,
and Choosing by the Stock of Brains, is a thing I dare not
enter into the Calculation of; I leave it to him: Nor shall I
debate the Influence the Ladies have in the Union, with him;
these Matters are fit to be merry about when the Union is
over.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
But setting his Jests aside, I presume to affirm, he shall not
find a more sutable way to Determine the Proportion, than
what I have now stated.</P>
<P>As to the Nobility—they are in this Sence only Capital
Free-holders, and their Original Honour began in their Ex∣traordinary
Possessions; and 'tis an Honour to their Lord∣ships,
with their Blood to have continued those Possessions.
I need therefore add nothing but this, the Proportion is the
same way to be tryed, their Lordships represent themselves,
and being by this Calculate, only restrain'd in Number, the
Method of determining it being left to their Lordships, their
Hereditary Honour of sitting in the Parliament is presum'd,
and their Lordships are compleatly represented, when they
are not there; And withal, in lieu of the small Interruption,
the Necessity of the Treaty gives them: They are as an E∣quivalent
in Honour regal'd with being Universally admit∣ted
Peers of <HI>England,</HI> as well as <HI>Scotland,</HI> or in the Words of
the Treaty, Peers of <HI>Britain</HI>—the whole Nobility of the
Island forming the Greatest, and most Illustrious Body in the
World,</P>
<P>And I am perswaded, their Lordships are not so Sensible
of any Dishonour put upon them in this Treaty, as these Gen∣tlemen
Authors would perswade them to be.</P>
<P>The next Head respects Equalities and Equivalents, and
this puts me back to speak a little more of Taxes and Trade.</P>
<P>I cannot but wonder at the Weakness of the Objections
raised against this Union upon these Accounts, in which to
me they seem to have so ill a Foundation, that either the
People who raise them, do not understand them; or if they
do, they are very forward Men, to think, that others can be
imposed upon by Arguments, so easily over-thrown.</P>
<P>I shall name a few of these Scruples, for Objections I cannot
call them, and speak shortly to them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
1. They tell us, The Lands will sink in Value, a Mystery
form'd in the Heads of some, that certainly have no Concern
in the Lands, or do not understand them: And I'll only
Answer it by one Note. Supposing the Lands were not to
be Improv'd in their Value at all—the very Security of the
Title of Land in <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Thing sorely wanted in <HI>England,</HI>
will immediately upon an Union, raise the Values of Land, at
least two years Purchase; and I prove it by the West-riding of
<HI>York-shire,</HI> the only County in <HI>England,</HI> that has obtain'd a Re∣gister,
since which, and in about Eight or Nine Years,
the Lands in that Division, are advanc'd near Five Years Pur∣chase
in the Value, only for the Security of a Title.</P>
<P>This is just like Telling the Soldiers, They shall be the
worse for the Ʋnion, and shall be all sent to the West-<HI>Indies;</HI>
whereas, first, they have an immediate Advantage of <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Pay; and they that suppose them to be sent to our West-<HI>Indies,</HI>
must allow the <HI>English</HI> to have a Great Confidence
in the <HI>Scots,</HI> immediately to give them Possession of their
Rich Colonies.</P>
<P>And yet, if I were to talk to the honest Soldiery of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I
could tell them, The Ʋnion will help them to such a thing in
<HI>Britain,</HI> as they are unacquainted with in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I mean
Liberty; and this Liberty is such, as even a Soldier can∣not
be listed but by his own Consent, and even when he is
listed, shall not be forced out of his Native Country, without
the same free Consent,—from whence I could enlarge upon
the Blessing of Liberty, and what Advantages <HI>Scotland</HI> should
reap by it, but I wave that here.</P>
<P>These things I take to be meer Suggestions raised for other
and secret Ends: I shall leave them therefore, and proceed
to others of more Moment.</P>
<P>2. That in the Salt Tax, the Draw-back allowed, is not E∣quivalent
to the Duty paid, and therefore the Remainder
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
will be a Tax upon, and consequently a Discouragement to
the Fishing Trade, by hindering the Exportation.</P>
<Q>To this I Answer, <HI>First,</HI> The Intent and Meaning of the
Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> before this Ʋnion was
brought upon the Stage, was, and still is, That the full
Duty of Forreign Salt, should be drawn back—<HI>That
I am positive in. Secondly,</HI> The Method taken
for the doing it, so well Answers the Meaning, that
there have been Complaints in <HI>England,</HI> that the Mer∣chants
got Money by the Draw-back, and thereby im∣posed
upon the Government: And I am very sure,
that in the West of <HI>England,</HI> where our chief Her∣ring
Fishing lies, the Merchants own themselves to be
no Losers by it.</Q>
<P>But to come to the Method, the Forreign Salt pays to
the Crown 6. 8 <HI>d. per</HI> Bushel, 84 <HI>l.</HI> weight to the Bushel, now
it being impossible to come to a Certainty, how much Salt
was again exported in every respective quantity and kind of
Fish, so as to make the Draw-back exact upon the Measure:
It was agreed, to allow the Merchant such a Draw-back
upon the quantity of Fish of several sorts, as by Computa∣tion
amounted to the full Value of the Tax laid on the Salt
used in curing the said Fish.</P>
<P>Now, if this be an Equivalent in <HI>England,</HI> as 'tis evident,
and the Merchants no where complain, the Objectors would
do well,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To shew that it is not an Equivalent in <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To state the particular Quantities of Salt used
in the respective kinds, and placing the Draw-back
against the Duty, show us the exact Difference
and let the Nation see the Deficiency.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But while none of this is seen, and only a presumptive Ob∣jection
offered, That it is not a sufficient Draw-back; I think,
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
'tis worth no further Notice: However, to speak more par∣ticularly
to the Case, than I think it requires, I only hint a
Question for the Gentlemen to Answer, if they think Con∣venient.</P>
<P>The Draw-back, as I remember, is 8 6 <HI>d.</HI> on every Barrel
of White Herring and 6. 8 <HI>d.</HI> on every Barrel of Red
Herring, containing 1000 Fish.—Now, as here is no
occasion to make Calculations on Proportion of Measures;
let any Man but make publick, whether the 1000 Herring in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> shall take up more Salt than 1000 Herring in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
and if so, I'll grant it may be as they object, and on
proof, they may at any time claim a larger Allowance, tho'
the Ʋnion be past: For as by the Union, they are to have
<HI>EQƲAL ENCOURAGEMENTS;</HI> and the meaning of the
Act is, That the whole Duty shall be drawn back, they can
never be denyed so fair a Claim, when it is made out: But
I dare say, no Man will ever enter upon that Calculation, or
can hope to make out such a thing.</P>
<P>But then they say, The great Stocks to be employ'd in the
Salt, <HI>will ruin the Trade;</HI> and yet they know, that on Impor∣tation
of Salt, they that want Stocks may give Bond for the
Duty, they that pay it down have 5 <HI>per Cent</HI> for prompt Pay∣ment,
which is a Consideration for the Disburse, or will pay
Interest to borrow it.</P>
<P>With the same Success they object the <HI>English</HI> Cure their
Fish with their own Salt.</P>
<P>By this they must mean the Rock-Salt, or else it is not true
in Fact; and if they mean the Rock, then 'tis against them,
for <HI>Scotland</HI> will have the same Salt cheaper than any Town
in <HI>England,</HI> where they Cure Fish, can have it.</P>
<P>The Rock-Salt is shipped at <HI>Leverpool</HI> and <HI>Chester,</HI> the first
and nearest Town to it in <HI>England,</HI> where they Cure any
Fish, is <HI>Biddiford;</HI> here they must fetch their Coals from
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
<HI>Wales</HI> by Sea, and pay 5 <HI>sh. per</HI> Chalder, Duty on them to
boil this Salt with; at <HI>Fowy</HI> 'tis still worse; at <HI>Falmouth, Pen∣sance,</HI>
and all the Towns about the Lands-End of <HI>England</HI>
still worse; whereas <HI>Scotland</HI> shall bring the Rock-Salt in 3
days Sail from <HI>Leverpool</HI> to the <HI>Clyd,</HI> then boil it with their
own Coal, which pays no Tax: And thus if the Rock-Salt
will Cure the Fish, <HI>Scotland</HI> may have it 20 <HI>per Cent</HI> cheaper
than <HI>England;</HI> and all the Quarrel at Foreign Salt dyes to
their own Advantage.</P>
<P>The next Article is the Excise, wherein Men alarm them∣selves
with Notions, That the small Ale sold here at 1 <HI>d.</HI> the
Choppin by Retail, shall be Taxt after the Union, equally
with the <HI>English</HI> Beer or Ale, sold for 3 <HI>d:</HI> and 4 <HI>d.</HI> the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Quart.</P>
<P>By my Calculation, the State of this Dispute lyes thus, and
I doubt not will admit of a fair Explanation before the Union
be concluded.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Beer and Ale is sold to the Retailer in <HI>England</HI>
from 20 to 25 <HI>sh. per</HI> Barrel of 36 Gallons, tho' Gauged in the
Tax at 34, which is so much Loss to the Brewer.</P>
<P>The small Beer is sold at 10 to 12 <HI>sh.</HI> the same Barrel, and
<HI>England</HI> knows no sorts between these two; nor is there any
Rate of Excise between them; one paying 4 <HI>sh. 9 d.</HI> the other
1 <HI>sh. 3 d. per</HI> Barrel, rebating for leakage 2 ½ Barrels in 23.</P>
<P>To bring this to a Proportion, I make it out, that the 2 <HI>d.</HI>
Ale in <HI>Scotland</HI> is Sold for very little, if any thing more, than
the <HI>English</HI> small Beer, and can be rated at but very little
more than the Excise of small Beer.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Barrel of 36 Gallons in small Beer is Sold for
10 or 12 <HI>sh. English</HI> Money—The <HI>Scots 2 d.</HI> Ale is Sold to
the Retailer in <HI>Scotland</HI> at a Mark <HI>Scots per</HI> Gallon, which is
13 <HI>d. ⅓ English;</HI> so that the <HI>Scots</HI> Ale is Sold for 13. 4 ⅓ <HI>Sterl.
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
per</HI> Barrel <HI>English</HI> Measure at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and in some Places
cheaper.</P>
<P>Now all the Question turns upon this Nicety, Whether 3. 5.
6 <HI>d.</HI> Duty shall be demanded of the <HI>Scots</HI> for the difference of
1 <HI>sh. 4 ⅓ per</HI> Barrel in the Price or Value of the Drink?</P>
<P>It is plain, in <HI>England</HI> the strong Beer payes no more than
4 <HI>sh. 9 d.</HI> tho' it be made of double strength, and should sell
for double Price.</P>
<P>By the same Proportion all Beer or Ale, tho' something a∣bove
the Rate of small Beer, ought not to pay as strong Beer,
unless it bears some Proportion to the Price, and Goodness of
Strong.—This is so evident, that one Clause in an Act of
Parliament here to explain it and state the Proportion, will
make it effectually easy; nor will <HI>England</HI> scruple a thing of
so much Justice.</P>
<P>Either you will have the Beer pay as small Beer in <HI>England</HI>
pays, which is nearest the due Proportion; or you will have
a Middle rate stated, proportioned to its advance in Value
above the small Beer.</P>
<P>The Act of Parliament in <HI>England</HI> confines the Word small
Beer to be 6 <HI>sh.</HI> Beer, and yet 'tis sold for 12, and the Excise
not raised; and it cannot be feared that it should be called
strong Beer in <HI>Scotland</HI> for so small a difference.</P>
<P>Again, take it another way, it sells for less than the <HI>English</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall Beer, as follows.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> small Beer at 12 sh. <HI>per</HI> Barrel, take the Excise
off, fells to the Brewer for 10 <HI>sh. 9 d.</HI>—The <HI>Scots</HI> Ale
pays 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Gallon <HI>Scots</HI> Measure, which is 2 <HI>sh. per</HI> Barrel;
and is therefore neat to the Brewer 11. 4 <HI>d.</HI> Out of which they
pay to the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> another Duty of 1. 4 <HI>d. per</HI> Bar∣rel;
which reduces it to 10 <HI>sh. per</HI> Barrel; if in the Country,
the City-Tax is not paid, then the Ale is sold cheaper: So
that every way the Brewer in <HI>Scotland</HI> has very little, if any
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
thing more for his Ale, than the Brewer in <HI>England</HI> has for
the small Beer.</P>
<P>It cannot therefore pay as strong Beer; that would be ex∣presly
against the Treaty of Equality.—It must either then
be brought to an exact Calculation, or a Clause may be form'd
to allow the Brewer in <HI>Scotland</HI> to brew his Ale into strong
and small, as in <HI>England,</HI> and then reduce them into one Head
of middling Ale by a mixture, the said mixture to be restrain'd
by Act of Parliament, and to be done in the presence of the
Officer, he being obliged on notice to attend.</P>
<P>This I humbly conceive to be the middle way, and the
only method to do Justice on both sides, and make both Par∣ties
easy, which is the true End of the Union.</P>
<P>There is indeed a certain Gentleman, who has printed,
<HI>Considerations, &amp;c: upon Trade in Case of the Ʋnion;</HI> and he
makes large Demands: <HI>As</HI> First, “That the Draw-back upon
Fish should be considerably more than the Value of the Salt.”</P>
<P>This is an admirable Equality, I must confess, and is all
one with a good bounty on the Export of Fish, and deserves
no other Reply.</P>
<P>On Excises he demands, That you should have Draw-backs,
as he calls them, <HI>tho' that is Non-sence, no Duty being
first paid,</HI> “on Bear, Pease and Oats, as well as on Barley, Rye
and Wheat.”</P>
<P>As to their Bear, 'tis plain it is the same kind as Barley;
and they have a Bounty of 2 <HI>sh. 6 d. per</HI> Quarter for it upon Ex∣portation;
for Pease and Oats they need no Bounty to export
them: For <HI>England</HI> wants them, and will take off the great∣test
Quantity they can spare; and it would be Non-sence to
give a Bounty to export that Abroad, which we always want
at Home.</P>
<P>Then he demands Liberty “to export the Woollen Manufa∣ctures,
Linen, &amp; other Branches of Improvement of <HI>Scotland.</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35"/>
This is a very weak Demand. Since you enjoy it by the
very Nature of the thing, and by the Terms of the Union,
no Tax can be laid on the Woollen Manufactures in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
of any sort, unless at the same time the same Tax be laid on
the Woollen Manufactures in <HI>England;</HI> otherwise how have
the Subjects equal Privileges and equal Taxes?</P>
<P>All these things are trifling, and of no Consequence.</P>
<P>Then he objects against the Article of Shipping, but for∣gets
that it is not denied for <HI>English</HI> Ships to bring from <HI>Holland</HI>
or <HI>Germany</HI> any Goods to you whatsoever; and there are e∣nough
of them, without letting the <HI>Dutch</HI> into our Trade, and
make them Carriers to <HI>Britain,</HI> when our own Ships and
Sailers want Encouragement.</P>
<P>Then he wants <HI>a Port in</HI> Scotland <HI>to import</HI> Irish <HI>Wool.</HI>
There is no need to condition in the Treaty for it; you may on
Demand have as many as you please, and <HI>England</HI> might
have more if they wanted it, the Restraint being design'd for
the <HI>Irish,</HI> not the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>So all these mighty Demands are over; I come next to
their Calculations on the Equivalent, and its being repaid in
11 years: Suppose I should allow it to be so—I see no Ar∣gument
to be drawn from it: they are Equivalents to one
another; <HI>England</HI> gives the Money as an Equivalent to the
Customs, and <HI>Scotland</HI> pays the Customs as an Equivalent to
the Money. The necessity of one is the Reason of the other;
and if the Customs did not pay it again, I would ask, <HI>Why is
it advanc'd at all?</HI> But still the Calculation is Suppositious as
to time also; and it may be 100 Years or more, for any thing
appears in this Calculation; and if it may be a long time,
then the Consideration for a Risque of its Certainty is worth
more than Common Interest, since if the Customs of <HI>Scotland</HI>
do not encrease, and if as some suggest, Trade should decline
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they may perhaps be never repaid at all.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36"/>
If the Customs do increase, the Trade increases, and then the
Union helps you to that Increase; and so the sooner 'tis paid
<HI>the more you get by the Ʋnion;</HI> and the longer 'tis a paying, the
greater the hazard to <HI>England</HI> is in advancing their ready Mo∣ney;
and this I think is all can be made of their nice Calcu∣lations;
of which I shall speak more largely by and by.</P>
<P>But then says this wise Gentleman, All Endeavours should
be used to free us of the Excise upon Beer and Ale. A very
good Project indeed; and yet you would in the <HI>First place,</HI> re∣ceive
above 304066 lib. as an Equivalent for that Excise. And
<HI>Secondly,</HI> You agree to come to an Equality of Taxes; so
I think there's an End of that Demand.</P>
<P>Another Objection this Author raises, is about <HI>England</HI>'s be∣ing
tied up in Trades by Incorporated Companies—which is
brought to argue against dissolving the <HI>African</HI> Company here.</P>
<P>Now, as the <HI>African</HI> Company here, neither is, nor in my
Opinion ever was in prospect of Success, or worth any Man's
notice as to <HI>Scotland</HI> in Trade, abstracted from the Assistance
and Correspondence from <HI>England for the Vent of their Returns;</HI>
and that it signifies not two Farthings whether dissolv'd or no,
farther than to prevent a new Set of Interlopers with <HI>English</HI>
Stocks under the <HI>Scots</HI> Title. So as to other Companies in
<HI>England,</HI> the Suggestion is falsly stated: For <HI>First,</HI> there is
no Exclusive Company in <HI>England</HI> but that of the <HI>East India,</HI>
and that the <HI>Scots</HI> have equal Right to be concerned in, by
purchasing the Stock as any <HI>English</HI> Men have.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Guinea Trade,</HI> upon paying 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the
Company, any Body may Trade; and their Factories, Co∣lonies
and Forts, being their Settlement under cover of which
you must carry on that Trade, 'tis worth the payment to
obtain the Privilege.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turky, Hamburgh,</HI> and <HI>Russia</HI> Companies, require only
certain small Mulcts to maintain their Consuls, Residents, and
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
Ambassadors; and a small Fine at taking up the Freedoms
and the Advantages in these Cases, as to the safety of Effects
and security of the Commerce abroad, are the Interest of all
the Traders; so that any Man, <HI>Scots</HI> Man or others, on these
small Payments, may be admitted to a Freedom in the Com∣pany,
and consequently into the Trade equally with <HI>English</HI>
Men.</P>
<P>I think I have left none of the Objections unanswered <HI>that
bear any weight in them;</HI> the Duties on Dales and Iron are of no
value to merit an Alteration, you may have great Quantities
of Iron from <HI>England.</HI> As to the Duty on Flax, if it
were to pay 3 lib. <HI>per</HI> 100, instead of 3 sh. it would be the
better for <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they have Land enough and Hands
enough, and ought to plant it themselves; especially since 'tis
apparent, that when they do plant it, their Land produces
better and finer than any they bring from Abroad.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Fishing, I have this to say, that he
does not state the Fact right, which I am willing to call <HI>IG∣NORANCE</HI>
rather than any thing else. <HI>First, England</HI> has
no Colony now on <HI>Newfoundland</HI> at all; the place is hardly ha∣bitable,
the small Colony they had, never consisted of 200 Fami∣lies,
the Export thither are Trifles, and never were of any
Consideration, the Trade of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> is carried on
by another Method, the Mercat lies between the <HI>Curers</HI>
and the <HI>Sackers,</HI> Terms I find this Gentleman does not under∣stand;
the Mercat is the Exchange of <HI>London,</HI> the Bargains
are transacted there, and all the rest is done <HI>super altum mare</HI>
without any Concern on Shore; the rest is needless to enlarge
upon. The <HI>Sackers</HI> go on to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> the <HI>Curers</HI> come
home to <HI>England;</HI> and as to the Colony, it is of very little
Consideration in this Case.</P>
<P>But not to enlarge, I offer my self before any indifferent
Judger to prove, <HI>First,</HI> That the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Trade does
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
not interfier with the <HI>Scots</HI> Fishery. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That it cannot
be the Interest of <HI>England</HI> to prefer it to the <HI>Scots.</HI> And <HI>Third∣ly.</HI>
If it was wholly Ingrost by the <HI>English,</HI> it would still in∣crease
the <HI>Scots</HI> Trade for the Cod Fishing—but those things
are too long to enter upon here.</P>
<P>I return to the Calculations of the Equivalent, and the Pre∣sumption
of its being quickly repaid: And here I humbly re∣commend
to these <HI>Sons of Numbers and Fractions,</HI> to answer
these few Queries to the World, and tell us how they came
to be so forgetful as to leave them out.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. How much of the Customs (which by the Equality
they say they are to come into, and which must be the
Sum to refound these Equivalents, and help to shorten
the time)—is to expire at the end of 3 years after
the Union?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether if the Sum that expires makes up 733 l. in eve∣ry
Thousand, or near Three-Fourths of the Sum: How
they came to want their Spectacles, and put that in for
11 years which is to continue but for three; and which
by consequence may make that Equivalent 30 years in
repaying?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What Equivalent <HI>Scotland</HI> pays to <HI>England</HI> for the imme∣diate
Loss of at least 30000 <HI>per annnm,</HI> which <HI>England</HI>
now receives in Customs from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and throws up
at one Cast by the Union?</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If they please to add that 30000 to the Equivalent, How
many Years it will be then in paying to <HI>England?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. What the Proportion of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be towards the
Support of the Civil Government all that while? And if
all the Revenues be appropriated to Equivalents, as by
these Calculaters, it seems to be; whether the Treasure
of <HI>Britain</HI> must not desray that Charge, while these E∣quivalents
are a paying?</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="40" REF="39"/>
6. Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> pays all this while any Share to
1300000 lib. <HI>per annum</HI> or thereabouts, the ordinary
expense of the Royal Navy of <HI>Britain,</HI> and its Appendi∣ces
for the Defence of our Trade, maintaining our Coasts,
Colonies, and Sovereignty of the Seas; in the Advan∣tages
of which she will have her share?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>When these Gentlemen have added these things to their
long Rolls of Figures, and brought the Repayment of Equi∣valents
to a head, I should be glad to see whether that Fund
shall be made good in this Century or the next.</P>
<P>I had not purposed to have entred into this Debate, and had
finished this Tract before these Objections appeared, but I
could not pass them over. And tho' I had made a Calculati∣on
of the Ballances of Trade between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI>
after the Union, I thought it better to lay by that Calculation,
than omit removing such Objections as these; which, however
weak in their Nature, have a mischievous Tendency to the
keeping alive the unreasonable Prejudices of some People, a∣gainst
what I believe they will at last see to be their own
Happiness.</P>
<P>I shall abridge the Heads I had form'd my Calculations in
Trade upon, to as short a Form as the room I have for it will
allow, and only bring what I had designed to be large in, un∣der

<P>And in this very thing is the Doctrine of a Subjection to <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
entirely Overthrown. 'Tis not a subjecting, but a Com∣municating
of Privileges and Interests; and to confirm my
Opinion, I desire no better an Authority, than the example
of the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Sabines</HI> Recorded by <HI>Titus Liv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> and
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
Quoted again by a famous Author on this very Subject of
Nations Uniting.</P>
<P>—<HI>quando uniantur duo populi non amittentur jura, sed
communicabuntur, ficut Sabinorum primo, deinde Albanorum jus
in Romanos transfusum est, &amp; una facta Respublica. Idemque
censendum de regnis quae non foedere, aut eo duntaxat quod Regem
communem habeant, sed vera unitate junguntur.</HI> When two
Common-wealths are to be United, the particular Rights of
either are not lost, but only communicated; thus first the <HI>Sabins,</HI>
afterwards the <HI>Albani,</HI> transmitted their Rights to the <HI>Romans,</HI>
and they became one Common-wealth. This is true also of
Kingdoms, when they are join'd together, not meerly by a
Confederation, or in their having the same King, but by a
Coalition or real Union. <HI>Grotius de jure Bel: &amp; Pac: Lib. Cap.</HI> 9.
I think I shall need to add nothing to this Quotation about
the Nations being subjected, nor need I enter upon the ab∣surd
Suggestion, that <HI>England</HI> will or can, after the Union,
subvert and destroy the Liberty and Privileges of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
but I shall crave leave to tell a short Story, and therewith
conclude this Discourse.</P>
<P>About the Year in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> IV. of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and just about the time of his Marriage with <HI>Margaret</HI>
of <HI>England,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> VII. a Woman brought forth
a strange Monster at or near the City of <HI>Glasgow;</HI> it was from
the Navel downward <HI>a Man-Child,</HI> one and entire in shape.</P>
<P>It stood upon the same Feet, had the same Vessels of Ex∣pulsion;
and every part of the Foundation was regular.</P>
<P>But from the Belly upwards it was two distinct Creatures,
divided in Parts, had two Head, two perfect and separated
Bodies, and receiv'd its Nourishment two ways, tho' it void∣ed
but by the same; and which was yet more wonderful, it
had a Division of Souls, two Hearts, separate and sometimes
opposite Wills, Passions and Affections; and this so appa∣rent,
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
that sometimes one side would quarrel with its Neigh∣bour,
and almost fight.</P>
<P>The Historical Part of this Monster is attested to my hand
by <HI>Buchanan,</HI> and in particular in <HI>Drummond</HI>'s History of the
Five <HI>James</HI>'s, P. 203. The Creature was brought up at the
King's Charge, and lived 28 Years.</P>
<P>From this strange Story I presume to argue a little about
this Union, to which it seems to me a very natural Allegory.</P>
<P>Here are two Nations; they are already tyed together in
all the Foundation-Parts; they stand upon the same Legs, go
with the same Feet, and are inseparably join'd in those Parts
which are the Support and Strength of the Body; but they
are divided in their upper Parts, have two Constitutions,
two Digestures, two Wills, and <HI>too much</HI> opposite Inclina∣tions.</P>
<P>Now
suppose when this Monster was pleased to be angry
with it self, or one Part, according to Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> Interfer'd
with the other, a Man had come and whispering to one of
the Heads, should tell it, He would direct it how it should ef∣fectually
subdue the other, and destroy it; and the thing
should be so foolish as to hearken to its own Passion, and the
malicious Proposal; What would be the Consequence? would
it not be, that being unable to separate it self from that Part
which it had ruin'd, the Mortality of the other would descend
to the Parts that were essential to both, and communicating
Corruption to them; the Contagion would ascend, the
whole must die, and the Wretch become <HI>Felo de se?</HI></P>
<P>The Application of this is too plain to need the least Illu∣stration
from me; I leave it to the Consideration of all <HI>Britain,</HI>
but especially I recommend it to those that think <HI>England</HI>
when united, can strive to crush <HI>Scotland,</HI> when she is a Part of
her self, without feeling the mortal Effects of it, to her own
Prosperity.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>The Sum of this Matter is in short, to the People of both Na∣tions,
to excite them to Union in General. I have nothing to do
with the Terms of it, neither do I enter on the Particulars: If
there be any thing in them to be Objected against, to be explain'd
or amended, Why do not these Gentlemen Authors, (for to
them I speak) propose their Amendments? To Cavil in General,
is ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gning the Sense of both Kingdoms, that an Incorporate
Union is not necessary at all.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> will desire nothing Unreasonable, <HI>England</HI> will deny no∣thing
Reasonable, and small Explanations on the Articles, will
make all the just Objections reconcilable.</P>
<P>If I might entreat the Writers against it, to do one thing, I
should take it as a Favour. I am perswaded, <HI>Scotland</HI> needs no
Representation but Truth, nor desires any: I would beg the Gentle∣men,
to make no Assertions, but what may be justified; No
Calculations, but what will bear to be examined, to make no
Suggestions but what are Probable, nor Estimates, but what are
Rational. In all which Articles, the Authors I have spoken to, are
pleased to be Extravagant.</P>
<P>Here is now another Paper abroad, Entitled, <HI>A short View of
Trade and Taxes.</HI> I wish that Gentleman would Examin, whether
he is not fallen into the same Fault: Whether it be true that
<HI>England</HI> has erected any Companies that will restrict the Branches
of the Trade of <HI>Scotland:</HI> Whether his Calculations on Trade,
Customs, Taxes and <HI>English</HI> Debts, are not intollerably Erroneous,
and Suppositions; And whether his Considerations on the Mer∣chants,
Barons, Burgesses, and Mechanicks, are not against all manner
of probability.</P>
<P>The Treaters have form'd an Union, lyable I believe, to as few Exceptions,
and wanting as few Explanations, as any Set of Men in the World could have
done in that time.—And I cannot but observe, That even these Gentlemen
that enjoy Places and Salaries here, which must cease by the Union, appear as
forward for it as others. Those that have always appeared for the Liberty of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and suffer'd under <HI>English</HI> Invasions are for it; and I think 'tis for their
Honour, and they need nothing to recommend them and their Families to Po∣sterity,
when the Fruit of this Union shall be more visible, than to have it Wrote
on their Grave Stones and Monuments, <HI>That they zealously promoted the Ʋnion of</HI>
Britain.</P>
