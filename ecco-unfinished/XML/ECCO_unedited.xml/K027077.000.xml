<P>IT may be necessary to acquaint the
Reader, that this Play is printed ex∣actly
as it is acted; for, tho' the Players
in Compliance with the Taste of the
Town, broke it into five Parts in the Re∣presentation;
yet, as the Action pauses,
and the Stage is left vacant but three
times, so it properly consists but of three
Acts, like the <HI>Spanish</HI> Comedies.</P>
<P>I must farther own the Assistance I have
receiv'd in this Piece from two of my
Friends; who, tho' they will not allow
me the Honour of having their Names
join'd with mine, cannot deprive me of
the Pleasure of making this Acknow∣ledgment.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>AUTHORS are judg'd by strange capricious Rules,</L>
<L>The Great Ones are thought mad, the Small Ones Fools;</L>
<L>Yet sure the Best are most severely fated,</L>
<L>For Fools are only laugh'd at, Wits are hated.</L>
<L>Blockheads with Reason Men of Sense abhor;</L>
<L>But Fool 'gainst Fool, is barb'rous civil War.</L>
<L>Why on all Authors then should Criticks fall?</L>
<L>Since some have writ, and shewn no Wit at all.</L>
<L>Condemn a Play of theirs, and they evade it,</L>
<L>Cry, damn not us, but damn the <HI>French</HI> that made it;</L>
<L>By running Goods, these graceless Owlers gain;</L>
<L>Theirs are the Rules of <HI>France,</HI> the Plots of <HI>Spain:</HI></L>
<L>But Wit, like Wine, from happier Climates brought,</L>
<L>Dash'd by these Rogues, turns <HI>English</HI> common Draught▪</L>
<L>They pall <HI>Moliere</HI>'s and <HI>Lopez</HI> sprightly strain,</L>
<L>And teach dull <HI>Harlequins</HI> to grin in vain.</L>
<L>How shall our Author hope a gentle Fate,</L>
<L>Who dares most impudently—not translate.</L>
<L>It had been civil in these ticklish Times,</L>
<L>To fetch his Fools and Knaves from foreign Climes;</L>
<L><HI>Spaniard</HI> and <HI>French</HI> abuse to the World's End;</L>
<L>But spare old <HI>England,</HI> lest you hurt a Friend.</L>
<L>If any Fool is by our Satyr bit,</L>
<L>Let him hiss loud, to show you all—he's hit.</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
Poets make Characters as <HI>Salesmen</HI> Cloaths,</L>
<L>We take no Measure of your Fops and Beaus;</L>
<L>But here all Sizes and all Shapes ye meet,</L>
<L>And fit your selves—like Chaps in <HI>Monmouth-street.</HI></L>
<L>Gallants look here, this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shews a Cap with Ears.</NOTE> Fool's-Cap has an Air—</L>
<L>Goodly and smart,—with Ears of <HI>Issachar.</HI></L>
<L>Let no One Manengross it, or confine:</L>
<L>A common Blessing! now 'tis yours, now mine.</L>
<L>But Poets in all Ages, had the Care</L>
<L>To keep this Cap, for such as will, to wear;</L>
<L>Our Author has it now, for ev'ry Wit</L>
<L>Of Course resign'd it to the next that writ:</L>
<L>And thus upon the Stage 'tis fairly<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Flings down the Cap, and <HI>Exit.</HI></NOTE> thrown,</L>
<L>Let him that takes it, wear it as his own.</L>

<P>These Blank Licences are wonderful
commodious.—The Clergy have a noble Com∣mand,
in being Rangers of the Park of Matrimony;
produce but a Warrant, and they deliver a Lady
into your Possession: but I have no Quarrel with
them, since they have put me into so good Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Foss.</SPEAKER>
<P>I now proclaim a solemn Suspension of
Arms between M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and Diseases. Let Di∣stempers
suspend their malignant Influence, and

this Day sacred to my Love. I had rather hold

<P>Ah! heedless Creature that I was, to quit

<P>Do with me as you please: Yet sure
you cannot so soon forget the Office of the
Church. Marriage is not to be undertaken wan∣tonly,
like Brute Beasts. If you will transgress,
the Sin be upon your own Head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Foss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great indeed is thy Virtue, and laudable

<P>What Business have I in the Bed-chamber,
when the Symptoms of Age are upon me? Yet

in this Vial are included Sons and Daughters.
Oh, for a Draught of the <HI>Aqua Magnanimitatis</HI>
for a Vehicle! fifty Drops of <HI>Liquid Laudanum</HI>

my Niece <HI>Phoebe Clinket</HI> to your Acquaintance:
But alas, the poor Girl has a Procidence of the Pi∣neal
Gland, which has occasioned a Rupture in
her Understanding. I took her into my House

to regulate my Oeconomy; but instead of Pud∣dings,
she makes Pastorals; or when she should
be raising Paste, is raising some Ghost in a new

the underling Players, broken Booksellers, half-voic'd
Singing-Masters, and disabled Dancing-Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters

<P>Your Decree is unjust, Sir, and I'll seek
my Remedy at Law. As I never was espoused,
I never had Carnal Knowledge of any Woman;

Virgin at this Hour for me.</P>

you have for these three Hours entertain'd ano∣ther

this very Instant; and the Knowledge of Truth
is desirable, and makes thy Case the better. What
signifies whether a Man beget his Child or not?
How ridiculous is the Act it self, said the great

<L>THE ancient <HI>Epilogue,</HI> as Criticks write,</L>
<L>Was, clap your Hands, excuse us, and good-night.</L>
<L>The modern always was a kind Essay</L>
<L>To reconcile the Audience to the Play:</L>
<L>More polish'd we; of late have learnt to fly</L>
<L>At Parties, Treaties, Nations, Ministry.</L>
<L>Our Author more genteelly leaves these Brawls</L>

<L>None but the <HI>Crocodile</HI>'s a Politician;</L>
<L>He reaps the Blessings of his double Nature,</L>
<L>And, <HI>Trimmer</HI> like, can live on Land or Water:</L>
<L>Yet this same Monster should be kindly treated,</L>
<L>He lik'd a Lady's Flesh—but not to eat it.</L>
<L>As for my other Spark, my fav'rite <HI>Mummy,</HI></L>
<L>His Feats were such, smart Youths! as might become ye;</L>
<L>Dead as he seem'd, he had sure Signs of Life;</L>
<L>His Hieroglyphicks pleas'd the Doctor's Wife.</L>
<L>Whom can our well-bred Poetess displease?</L>
<L>She writ like Quality—with wondrous ease:</L>
<L>All her Offence was harmless want of Wit;</L>
<L>Is that a Crime?—ye Powers, preserve the Pit!</L>
<L>My Doctor too, to give the Devil his due,</L>
<L>When ev'ry Creature did his Spouse pursue,</L>
<L><PB REF="88"/>

<L>What, put young Maids to that unnat'ral Trial!</L>
<L>So hard a Test! why, if you needs will make it,</L>
<L>Faith, let us marry first—and then we'll take it.</L>
<L>Who could be angry, though like <HI>Fossile</HI> teaz'd?</L>
<L>Consider, in three Hours, the Man was eas'd.</L>
<L>How many of you are for Life beguil'd,</L>
<L>And keep as well the Mother, as the Child!</L>
<L>None but a <HI>Tar</HI> could be so tender-hearted,</L>
<L>To claim a Wife that had been three Years parted;</L>
<L>Would you do this, my Friends?—believe me, never:</L>
