<P>THERE is no animal, so generally known
at least as the bear, concerning which the
writers of natural history have differed so much.
Their uncertainties, and even contradictions, with
regard to the nature and manners of this animal,
seem to have proceeded from their not distin∣guishing
properly the different species; and, of
course, they sometimes ascribe to one the pro∣perties
of another. In the first place, the land-bear
must be distinguished from the sea-bear, the
latter being commonly called the <HI>white bear,</HI> or
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<HI>bear of the frozen sea.</HI> These two animals are
very different, both in the form of their bodies,
and in their natural dispositions. The land-bears
must again be distinguished into the <HI>brown</HI> and
the <HI>black</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the denomination of the Brown Bears, I compre∣hend those which are brown, yellow, red, or reddish; and un∣der <HI>black,</HI> all the snades of that colour.</NOTE>; because, having neither the same in∣clinations,
nor the same natural appetites, they
cannot be regarded as varieties only of one and
the same species. Besides, some land-bears are
white, and, though resembling in colour the sea-bear,
they differ from it, in every other particular,
as much as the other bears. These white land-bears
are found in Great Tartary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See relation de la Grande Tartarie, p. 8.</NOTE>, in Muscovy,
in Lithuania, and in other northern regions.
They are not rendered white during winter by
the rigour of the climate, like the ermines, or the
hares; but are brought forth white, and remain
white in all seasons. They ought, therefore, to
be considered as a fourth species, if we found not
also bears with their hair consisting of a mixture
of brown and white, which indicates an inter∣mediate
race between the white land-bear and
the brown or black bear; consequently the white
land-bear is only a variety of one or other of these
species.</P>
<P>The brown bear is very common in the Alps;
but the black bear is extremely rare. The latter,
on the contrary, abounds in the forests of the
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
northern regions of Europe and America. The
brown bear is ferocious and carnivorous; but
the black bear is only wild, and uniformly refuses
to eat flesh. Of this we cannot give a more di∣stinct
and recent testimony than that of M. du
Pratz, in his history of Louisiana<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 2. p, 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“The black bear,” says he, “appears in Luisia∣na
during the winter; because the snows which
cover the northern countries prevent him from
finding sufficient nourishment. He lives upon
fruits, acorns, and roots; but he is peculiarly fond
of honey and milk; and, when he meets with
any of these articles, he will rather die than quit
them. Notwithstanding the common prejudice,
I affirm, and in this assertion I am supported by
all the inhabitants of this province, and of the
neighbouring countries, that he is not a carnivo∣rous
animal. Though numerous, and often pres∣sed
by extreme hunger, they never devour men,
nor eat even butcher-meat, when they fall in
with it. During the time I lived among the
Natches, a severe winter in the northern regions
made the bears descend in vast quantities. They
were so numerous, that they starved each other,
and were very meagre. Famine made them come
out of the woods which border on the river. We
saw them, during the night, run into houses and
court-yards, which were not properly shut, where
they found meat exposed; but they never touch∣ed
it, and eat only what grains they could pick
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
up. On an occasion so pressing, they must in∣fallibly
have discovered their carnivorous dispo∣sition,
if they had an appetite of this nature.
They never kill animals to devour them; and, if
they were carnivorous, they would not abandon
countries covered with snow, where they could
find men and animals at will, in order to search
for fruits and roots, a species of food rejected by
the carnivorous tribes.” M. du Pratz adds, in a
note, that, since writing the above article, he had
learned with certainty, that, in the mountains of
Savoy, there are two kinds of bears, the one
black, like those of Louisiana, and not carnivo∣rous;
the other red, and equally carnivorous as
the wolves. The Baron de Hontan remarks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom, 1. p. 86.</NOTE>,
that the bears of Canada are very black, but by
no means dangerous; and that they never attack
men, unless when shot at and wounded. He far∣ther
observes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tom▪ 2. p. 40.</NOTE>, that the reddish bears are ex∣tremely
mischievous, and boldly attack the hun∣ters;
but that the black bears uniformly fly from
men.</P>
<P>Wormius<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mus. Worm. p. 318.</NOTE> informs us, that there are three
kinds of bears in Norway: The first (<HI>bressdiur</HI>)
is very large, not altogether black, but brownish,
and not so destructive as the other kinds, living
only on herbs and the leaves of trees: The se∣cond
(<HI>ildgiersduir</HI>) is smaller, blacker, and carni∣vorous,
often attacking horses and other animals,
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
especially in autumn: The third (<HI>myrebiorn</HI>) is
still smaller, but fails not to be noxious. He is
said to feed upon ants, and delights in overturn∣ing
their hillocks. It has been remarked, (he
adds, without proof), that these three kinds mix,
and produce intermediate species; that the car∣nivorous
kind attacks the flocks, kills every crea∣ture,
like the wolf, and devours only one or two;
that, though carnivorous, they eat wild fruits;
and, when the fruit of the service-tree abounds,
they become more dangerous, because this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our
fruit sets their teeth so much on edge, that no∣thing
but blood or grease can remove this malady,
which prevents them from eating with ease. But
most of these facts related by Wormius appear to
be extremely equivocal; for we have no ex∣amples
of animals, with appetites so uniformly
different as those of the two first species, the one
living only on herbs and the leaves of trees, and
the other on flesh and blood, intermixing and
producing intermediate species. Besides, he makes
the black bears carnivorous, and the brown frugi∣vorous,
which is absolutely repugnant to truth. Add
to this, that P. Rzaczynski<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Auctuar. hist. nat. p. 32.</NOTE>, a Polish writer, and
M. Klein of Dantzick<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De Quadrup. p. 82.</NOTE>, in describing the bears of
their country, mention only two species, the
black, and the brown or red; and, of the latter,
they speak of a larger and lesser kind. They re∣mark,
that the black bears are more rare; that the
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
brown, on the contrary, are very common; that
the black bears are the largest, and feed upon ants;
and, lastly, that the red or brown kind are the
most carnivorous and destructive. These proofs,
added to those of M. du Pratz and of the Baron
de la Hontan, are perfectly opposite to what
Wormius advances. In a word, it appears to be
certain, that the red or brown bears, who are
found not only in Savoy, but in the high moun∣tains,
in the vast forests, and in almost every de∣sert
of the earth, devour live animals, and even
the most putrid carcasses. The black bears in∣habit
not very cold countries; but we find the
brown or red bears in the frozen, the temperate,
and even in the southern regions. They were
common in Greece; and the Romans brought
them from Lybia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herodot. Solin. Crinit. et alii. Quod freno Lybici doman∣tur ursi, says <HI>Martial.</HI></NOTE>, to be exhibited at their pu∣blic
spectacles. They are found in China<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. generale des voyages, par M▪ l'Abbé Prevost, tom. 3. p. 492. Hist. nat. du Japan, par Koempfer, tom. 1. p. 109.</NOTE>, in
Japan<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strabo, lib. 16. Prosp. Alpin. p. 233.</NOTE>, in Arabia, in Egypt, and as far as the
island of Java<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Voyage autour du monde de le Gentil, tom. 3. p. 85.</NOTE>. Aristotle<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Aristot. de admir. cap. 140. Idem de gen, animal. lib. 5. cap. 6.</NOTE> likewise mentions
white land-bears, and considers this difference of
colour as accidental, and proceeding from a de∣fect
in generation. Thus bears are found in all
desert, rude, and woody countries. But they
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
never appear in populous nations, nor in open
and cultivated regions. There are none in
France or in Britain, except, perhaps, a few in
the most unfrequented mountains.</P>
<P>The bear is not only a savage, but a solitary
animal. He flies from all society, avoiding every
place to which man can have access, and is only
easy where Nature appears in her rudest and most
antient form. An old cavern among inaccessible
rocks, or a grotto, formed by time in the trunk
of a decayed tree, in the midst of a thick forest,
serve him for an habitation. Thither he retires
alone, and passes part of the winter without pro∣visions,
and goes not out of it for several weeks.
However, he is neither torpid, nor deprived of
feeling, like the dormouse and marmot; but, as
he is excessively fat about the end of autumn,
which is the time he retires, this abundance of
grease enables him to endure abstinence; and he
departs not from his den till he is almost famish∣ed.
It is alledged, that the males leave not their
retreats for forty days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristot▪ hist. anim. lib. 8. cap. 17.</NOTE>; but that the females
continue four months, because it is there that they
bring forth their young. It is difficult to believe
that they should not only subsist, but nourish
their young, without taking food for so long a
period. I allow, that, when pregnant, they are
prodigiously fat, and that, being clothed with
very thick hair, sleeping the greatest part of the
time, and remaining without motion, they must
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
lose little by perspiration. But, if it be true, that
the males, pressed with hunger, go out in forty
days, it is not natural to think, that the females,
after bringing forth and suckling their young,
should feel less the want of food, unless we sup∣pose
them to devour some of their offspring, to∣gether
with the membranes, &amp;c. which is not
probable, notwithstanding the example of the
cats, who sometimes eat their young. Besides,
I am here talking of the brown species only, the
males of which devour the new-born cubs,
when they discover them in their dens. The fe∣males,
on the contrary, seem to love their offspring
with an astonishing ardour: After they bring
forth, they are more ferocious and more dange∣rous
than the males. They fight, and expose
themselves to every peril, in order to save their
young, who are not unformed for some time af∣ter
birth, as the antients alledged, but grow near∣ly
as quick as other animals. They are perfectly
formed in the womb of the mother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eo illust. senatus Bononiensis ursulum a caeso ma∣tris <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tero ext<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctum, et omnibus suis partibus formatum, in va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adhuc servamus; <HI>Aldrov. de quadrup. p.</HI> 120.</NOTE>; and, if the
foetus, or young cub, seems, at the first glance, to
be ill formed, it is only because the old bear her∣self,
upon the whole, is an animal gross and dis∣proportioned;
and we know, that, in every spe∣cies,
the foetus, or new-born animal, is more dis∣proportioned
than the adult.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16"/>
Autumn, with the bears, is the season of love:
The female is said to be more ardent than the
male. It is alledged, that she lies on her back to re∣ceive
him, that she embraces him closely, and keeps
him fast for a long time, &amp;c. But it is certain that
they copulate like other quadrupeds. Captive
bears have been seen coupling, and have been im∣pregnated.
But, how long the females go with
young, has not been so accurately marked as could
be wished. Aristotle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arist. hist. animal. lib. 6. cap. 30.</NOTE> has said, that they go with
young 30 days only. As no body has contradicted
this fact, and as we are not in a condition to verify
it, we, of course, can neither affirm nor deny with
regard to this matter. We shall only remark,
that it appears to be doubtful: 1. Because the
bear is a large animal; and, in proportion to the
size of animals, they require the longer time to
be formed in the womb: 2. Because the young
bears grow very slowly; they follow their mo∣ther,
and require her assistance, for a year or two:
3. Because the female produces but one, two,
three, or four, and never more than five; a pro∣perty
common to all large animals, who produce
but few young, and carry them long: 4. Because
the bear lives 20 or 25 years, and the time of
gestation and that of growth are generally propor∣tioned
to the duration of life. From these analo∣gies,
I am inclined to believe that the bear goes
with young at least several months. Whatever be
in this, the mother takes the greatest care of her
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
young. She prepares for them a bed of moss
and herbs in the bottom of her cavern, and
suckles them till they are able to go abroad with
her. She brings forth in winter, and the cubs
begin to follow her in the spring. The male and
female live not together; but each has a separate
and a distant retreat. When they cannot find a
cavern for a den, to make a lodging, they break
and collect branches of trees, which they so cover
with herbs and leaves as to render them impene∣trable
by water.</P>
<P>The voice of the bear is a deep murmuring,
often accompanied with a grinding of the teeth,
especially when irritated. He is very suscepti∣ble
of anger, which is always furious, and oft∣en
capricious. Though, when tamed, he ap∣pears
mild and even obedient to his master, he
should always be treated with diffidence and cir∣cumspection;
and we should be particularly care∣ful
not to strike him on the nose, or on the parts
of generation. He may be taught to walk on
end, to dance, and to perform various gesticula∣tions.
He seems even to listen to music, and to
observe some kind of measure. But, to give him
this species of education, he must be taken young,
and constrained during life. An old bear cannot
be tamed, nor will he suffer restraint. He is na∣turally
intrepid, or, at least, indifferent to danger.
The wild bear never turns out of his road, nor
flies from the aspect of man. It is alledged, how∣ever,
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
that the sound of a whistle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 37.</NOTE> surprises and
confounds him to such a degree, that he rises on
his hind-feet. This is the time for shooting, and
endeavouring to kill him; for, if he be only
wounded, he attacks the huntsman with fury,
embraces him with his fore-feet, and suffocates
him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. Hist. de la Louisiane par M. du Pratz, tom. 2. p. 81.</NOTE>, if not timely assisted.</P>
<P>Bears are hunted in different manners. In
Sweden, Norway, Poland, &amp;c. the least dange∣rous
mode, it is said<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 53.</NOTE>, is to intoxicate them by
throwing ardent spirits on honey, of which they
are fond, and search for it in the trunks of trees.
In Louisiana and Canada, where the black bears
are common, and where they live not in caverns,
but in decayed trees, they are taken by setting
their habitations on fire<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mem. sur la Louisiane par M. Dumont, p. 75. Hist. de la Louisiane, par M. du Pratz, tom, 2. p. 87.</NOTE>. As they climb trees
with ease, they seldom reside on a level with the
ground, and their habitations are often 30 or 40
feet high. If it be a mother with her young, she
descends first, and is slain before she reaches the
ground. The cubs follow, are seized by throw∣ing
a rope round their necks, and carried off ei∣ther
for the purposes of training or eating them;
for the flesh of the cubs is delicate and good:
That of the adult is eatable; but, as it is mixed
with an oily fat, the paws alone, which are more
compact, are reckoned a delicate dish.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="19"/>
The hunting of the bear, without being very
dangerous, is extremely lucrative, when perform∣ed
with success. The skin is a valuable fur, and
the quantity of oil drawn from a single bear is
considerable. The flesh and fat are boiled to∣gether
in a caldron, and the oil is easily sepa∣rated.
“Afterwards,” says M. du Pratz, “the
oil is purified, by throwing it, when very warm,
into a quantity of salt and water. A detonation
ensues, and a thick smoke rises, which carries off
the disagreeable odour of the grease. When the
smoke ceases, and while the grease is still warm,
it is put into a pot, where it is allowed to remain
for eight or ten days. At the end of this period,
a clear oil is seen swimming on the top, which is
taken off with a laddle. This oil is equally good,
and answers the same purposes, as the best olive
oil. Beneath, we find a lard as white, but a little
softer than hog's-lard. It serves for culinary pur∣poses,
and has no bad taste or smell.” M. Du∣mont,
in his Memoirs of Louisiana, agrees with
M. du Pratz, and adds, that, from a single bear,
they obtain more than 120 pots of this oil; that
the savages traffick in this article with the French;
that it is very wholesome and good; that it ne∣ver
congeals but during great colds, and, when
this happens, it is all clotted and of a dazzling
whiteness; and that then it is eaten upon bread,
like butter. Our druggists keep no bear's grease,
but import, from Savoy, Switzerland, or Canada,
axungium, which is by no means pure. The au∣thor
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
of the Dictionary of Commerce affirms, that
good bear's grease should be grayish, viscid, and
of a disagreeable odour; and that, when too
white, it is sophisticated and mixed with suet. It
is applied topically in hernias, rheumatism, &amp;c.
and many people assure us, that they have felt
the good effects of it.</P>
<P>The amazing fatness of the bear makes him
light for swimming; and, accordingly, he tra∣verses,
with ease, rivers and lakes. “The bears
of Louisiana,” says Dumont<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. sur la Louisiane, p. 76.</NOTE>, “which are of a
fine black colour, cross the river, notwithstanding
its great breadth. They are remarkably fond of
the fruit of the <HI>plaqueminier, guiacana</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For an account of this tree, see Dict. raisonné d'Hist. nat. par Bomare.</NOTE>, or

upon a branch, keep themselves firm with
one hand, and collect the fruit with the o∣ther.
They frequently come from the woods
into the cultivated fields to eat potatoes and
yams.” In autumn, they are so fat, that they
can hardly walk<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyage du Baron de la Hontan, p. 86.</NOTE>, or at least, they cannot run so
quick as a man<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hist. de la Louisiane par M. du Pratz, p. 83.</NOTE>. Upon the sides and thighs
they have sometimes ten inches thick of fat<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Extrait d'un ouvrage Danois cité par Mrs Arnauld de Nobleville et Salerne; <HI>Hist. nat. des animaux, tom.</HI> 6. p. 374.</NOTE>.
The soles of their feet are gross and inflated.
When wounded, there issues out a white lacteous
juice. This part appears to be composed of
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
small glands, like <HI>papillae;</HI> and it is for this rea∣son,
that these animals, during their winter re∣treat,
continually suck their paws.</P>
<P>The bear enjoys, in an excellent degree, the
senses of seeing, hearing, and touching, though
his eye is proportionally small, his ears short,
and his skin thick and covered with bushy hair.
His sense of smelling is, perhaps, more exquisite
than that of any other animal; for the internal
surface of this organ is very much extended, ha∣ving
four rows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Etienne Lorentinus, Ephem. d'Allem. decur. 1. an. 9. et 10. p. 403. cité par Mrs Arnauld de Nobleville et Salerne; <HI>Hist. nat. des animaux, tom.</HI> 6. p. 366.</NOTE> of bony plates, separated from
each other by three perpendicular planes, which
increase prodigiously the surfaces proper for the
reception of impressions from odoriferous bodies.
He has fleshy legs and arms, like those of a man,
a short heel-bone, which forms a part of the sole
of the foot, five metatarsal bones opposed to the
heel in the hind-feet, and an equal number of
metacarpal bones in the fore-feet. But the thumb
is not separated, and the largest finger is on the
outside of this species of hand; whereas, in man,
it is on the inside. His toes are thick, short, and
locked to each other, both in the hands and feet.
His nails are black, and of a hard homogeneous
substance. But these gross resemblances to man
render the bear only more deformed, and give
him no superiority over the other animals.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>M. de Musly, major of artillery in the service
of the States General, has communicated some
notices concerning domestic bears, of which the
following is an extract.</P>
<P>“At Berne, where these animals are nourish∣ed,”
says M. de Musly, “they are kept in large
square ditches,” where they have room to walk
about. These ditches are covered above, and
lined with stone, both at the bottom and on the
sides. Their lodges or cabbins are likewise pa∣ved,
on a level with the bottom of the ditch, di∣vided
into two by walls, and may be shut both
internally and externally by iron grates. In the
middle of these ditches, there are large holes in
the pavement, where considerable trees may be
set up on end. There is likewise, in each ditch,
a trough full of fresh water.</P>
<P>“Two young brown bears were transported
here from Savoy,” thirty-one years ago, of which
the female is still alive; the male was killed a∣bout
two months ago, by a fall from one of the
high trees planted in the ditch. They began to
generate at the age of five years: Since that time,
they have every year come in season during the
month of June; and the female has always
brought forth in the beginning of January. The
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
first time she produced only one cub, and after∣wards,
sometimes one, sometimes two, and some∣times
three, but never more; and the three last
years, she has brought forth only one at each
time. The man who takes care of her, thinks
her still pregnant (October 17. 1771.) When
the young come into the world, their figure is
pretty; their colour is yellow, but white round
the neck; and they have not the least appear∣ance
of bears. The mother is extremely fond
of them. Their eyes are shut during four weeks.
At first they exceed not eight inches in length;
and, three months after, they measure 14 or 15
inches from the end of the muzzle to the root of
the tail; and their hair is nearly an inch long.
Their figure is then almost round, and the muzzle
is very sharp pointed; so that a person would
hardly know them. They afterwards become
weak and tender till they acquire their full
growth; the white colour is gradually effaced,
and the yellow changes into brown.</P>
<P>During the act of copulation, the male com∣mences
with short, but brisk movements, which
last about a quarter of a minute; he then reposes
double that time upon the female, without disen∣gaging
himself: In this manner he proceeds for
three or four times; and, when the operation is
finished, the male bathes himself in the trough
up to the neck. They sometimes fight cruelly,
making a horrible grumbling noise. But, in the
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
season of love, the female has generally the ad∣vantage,
because the male, at that time, spares
her. The ditches, which formerly were in the
town, are now filled up, and others are made
between the ramparts and the old walls. These
two bears, having been separated some hours
when removing into the new ditches, raised them∣selves
on end when they again met, and em∣braced
each other with transport. After the
death of the male, the female appeared to be
much afflicted, and refused every kind of nourish∣ment
for several days. But, unless these animals
be brought up and fed together from their earliest
youth, they cannot endure one another; and, af∣ter
being accustomed to this kind of society, the
survivor will not admit another mate.</P>
<P>“The trees put yearly into the ditches in the
month of May,” are green larches, upon which
the bears take vast delight in climbing. They
are fed with rye-bread, which is cut into large
morsels, and steeped in warm water. They
likewise eat all sorts of fruits; and, when any
unripe fruits are brought to the market, they are
thrown in to the bears by order of the magi∣strate.
It has been remarked, however, that some
bears prefer pulse to the fruits of trees. When
the female is about to bring forth, they give her
plenty of straw, of which she makes a rampart.
After this, the male is removed, lest he should
eat the cubs; and, when she has littered, she is fed
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
with a more nourishing diet than usual. We never
could perceive any part of the membranes or af∣ter-birth,
which makes it probable that she eat
them. The cubs are allowed to remain with her
for ten weeks; and are afterwards separated, and
fed, for some time, with milk and biscuit.</P>
<P>“The bear which we believed to be in a state
of pregnancy,” was furnished, about the com∣mon
time, with straw, of which she made a bed,
and rested on it during three weeks, without pro∣ducing
any thing. She brought forth, for the last
time, at the age of 31, in the month of January
1771; but, though she received the male in the
following June, it was ineffectual in January
1772. It were to be wished that she was al∣lowed
to live, in order to discover the term fix∣ed
by Nature for the duration of these animals.</P>
<P>“There are brown bears on Mount Jura, up∣on
the frontiers of our canton, in Franche∣comté,
and in the country of Gex. When they
descend into the plains in autumn, they repair to
the chesnut woods, where they make great ha∣vock.
In this country, the bears are said to have
weak eyes, but acute senses of hearing, touching,
and smelling.”</P>
<P>The bears of Norway are more common in the
provinces of Bergen and Drontheim, than in the
other districts of that country. Two races of
them are remarked, of which the one is conside∣rably
smaller than the other. In the colours of
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
both, there are great varieties. Some of them
are of a deep brown, others of a shining brown;
and some are gray, and of every shade of white.
At the beginning of October, they retire into the
dens they prepare for themselves, and where they
make a kind of bed composed of moss and leaves
of trees. As these animals are very formidable,
especially when wounded, there are seldom less
than three or four hunters in company; and, as
the bear easily kills large dogs, they employ on∣ly
small dogs, who pass under his belly, and
seize him by the genitals. When he finds him∣self
overpowered, he leans his back against a
rock or a tree, collects turf and stones, which he
throws at his enemies; and it is generally in
this situation that he receives the finishing
blow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan's natural history of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have seen at the menagery of Chantilly an
American bear, of a fine black colour, and ha∣ving
soft, straight, long hair. We remarked o∣ther
differences in the figure of this American
bear, compared with that of Europe, as in the
head, which is somewhat longer, because the
muzzle is not so flat as that of our European
bears.</P>
<P>In the relation of M. de Bertram's expedition,
we have a notice of an American bear, killed
near St John's river, in East Florida, in the fol∣lowing
terms:</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="27"/>
“This bear,” according to the relation,”
weighed only 400 pounds, though the length
of its body was seven feet, from the extremity
of the nose to the tail. The fore-feet were only
five inches broad, and the thickness of the fat
was four inches. We drew from this animal

<P>IN proportion as man rises above a state of
nature, the other animals sink below that
standard: Reduced to slavery, or treated as re∣bels,
and dispersed by force, their societies have
vanished, their industry has become barren, their
arts have disappeared, each species has lost its
general qualities, and the whole have preserved
only their individual properties, matured, in some,
by example, by imitation, and by instruction;
and, in others, by fear, and by the necessity of
perpetually watching over their own safety.
What views, what designs can be possessed by
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
slaves without spirit, or exiles without power?
Compelled to fly, and to exist in a solitary man∣ner,
they can arrive at no improvement; they
can neither acquire nor transmit knowledge; but
must continually languish in calamity, and de∣cay;
they must perpetuate without multiplying;
and, in a word, they must lose by their duration
more than they acquire by experience.</P>
<P>It is for this reason that there are now no re∣mains
of that astonishing industry of animals, ex∣cepting
in those distant and desert regions where,
for a long succession of ages, they have received
no disturbance from man, where each species
can display with freedom its natural talents, and
mature them in quiet, by uniting into permanent
societies. The beavers afford, perhaps, the only
subsisting monument of the antient intelligence
of brutes, which, though infinitely inferior in
principle to the human intellect, supposes com∣mon
projects and relative views; projects which,
having society for their basis, and, for their ob∣ject,
a dike to construct, a town to build, or a
republic to found, imply some mode of making
themselves understood, and the capacity of acting
in concert.</P>
<P>The beavers are said to be, among quadru∣peds,
what the bees are among the insect tribes.
There are in Nature, as she now appears, three
species of societies, which must be examined be∣fore
we can compare them: The free society of
man, from which, next to God, he derives all his
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
power; the constrained society of the larger ani∣mals,
which always flies before that of man; and
the necessary society of certain small creatures,
which, being all produced at the same time, and in
the same place, are obliged to live together. An
individual, solitary as he comes from the hand
of Nature, is a sterile being, whose industry is li∣mited
to the simple use of his senses. Even man
himself, in a state of pure nature, deprived of the
light and assistance of society, neither produces
nor constructs. Fertility, on the contrary, is the
necessary result of every society, however blind
or fortuitous, provided it be composed of creatures
of the same nature. From the necessity alone of
desiring to approach or to avoid each other, com∣mon
movements arise, from which there often
results a work, that has the air of being concerted,
managed, and executed with intelligence. Thus
the works of bees, each of whom, in a given
place, such as a hive, or the hollow of an old tree,
builds a cell; the works of the Cayenne bee, or
fly, who not only makes the cells, but the hive
that is to contain them, are operations purely
mechanical, and imply no intelligence, no con∣certed
project, no general views; they are la∣bours
which, being the produce of a physical ne∣cessity,
a result of common movements<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. III. Dissertation on the nature of animals.</NOTE>, are at
all times, and in all places, uniformly executed in
the same manner, by a multitude, not assembled
from choice, but united by the force of nature.
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
Hence, it is not society, but numbers alone,
which operate here. It is a blind power, never
to be compared to that light by which all society
is directed. I speak not of that pure light, that
ray of divinity, which has been imparted to man
alone. Of this the beavers, as well as all the other
animals, are most assuredly deprived. But their
society, not being a union of constraint, but pro∣ceeding
from a species of choice, and supposing,
at least, a general concert and common views in
its members, implies likewise a certain degree of
intelligence, which, though different in principle
from that of man, produces effects so similar as
to admit of comparison, not, indeed, to the lumi∣nous
society of polished nations, but to the rudi∣ments
of it, as they appear among savages, whose
union and operations can alone, with propriety,
be compared to those of certain animals.</P>
<P>Let us, then, examine the product of each of
these associations; let us see how far the art of
the beaver extends, and to what the talents of
the savage is limited. To break a branch, and
to make a staff of it, to build a hut, and to cover
it with leaves, for shelter, and to collect hay or
moss, and to make a bed of these materials, are
operations common to the animal and to the sa∣vage.
The beavers build huts, the monkeys carry
staves, and several other animals make commo∣dious
and neat houses, which are impenetrable by
water. To sharpen a stone by friction, and
make a hatchet of it, to use this hatchet for cut∣ting
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
or peeling the bark off trees, for pointing ar∣rows,
for hollowing a vessel, or for slaying an a∣nimal
in order to clothe themselves with its skin,
to make bow-strings of its sinews, to fix the si∣news
to a hard thorn or bone, and to use these
for needles and thread, are actions purely indivi∣dual,
which man in solitude may perform with∣out
the aid of others; actions which solely de∣pend
on conformation, because they suppose no∣thing
but the use of the hand. But, to cut and
transport a large tree, to build a village, or to
construct a large canoe, are operations, on the
contrary, which necessarily suppose common la∣bour
and concerted views. These works are the
results of infant society in savage nations; but
the operations of the beavers are the fruits of so∣ciety
already matured among those animals; for
it must be remarked, that they never think of
building, but in countries where they are per∣fectly
free and undisturbed. There are beavers
in Languedoc, and in the islands of the Rhone;
and they abound in many of the northern pro∣vinces
of Europe. But, as all these countries
are inhabited, or, at least, frequented by men,
the beavers there, like all the other animals, are
dispersed, solitary, fugitive, and timid creatures.
They have never been known to unite, or to con∣struct
any common work. But, in desert regions,
where men in society were long of arriving, and
where some vestiges only of savages could be tra∣ced,
the beavers have every where united, formed
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
associations, and constructed works which continue
to excite admiration. Of this I shall endeavour
to quote the most judicious and irreproachable
authorities, and shall hold as certain only those
facts concerning which authors agree. Less in∣clined,
perhaps, than some of them, to indulge
admiration, I shall venture to doubt, and even to
criticise, every article that appears too hard to be
credited.</P>
<P>It is universally allowed, that the beaver, in
his purely individual qualities, instead of possessing
any marked superiority over the other animals,
appears, on the contrary, to sink considerably
below some of them: And we are enabled to con∣firm
this fact, being possessed of a young beaver,
sent us from Canada<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This beaver was taken when very young, and transmit∣ted to me, in the beginning of the year 1758, by M. de Mont∣belliard, a captain of the Royal Artillery.</NOTE>, which we have kept alive
near twelve months. This animal is very gentle,
peaceable, and familiar. It is somewhat melan∣choly,
and even plaintive; but has no violence
or vehemence in its passions. Its movements are
slow, and its efforts feeble; yet it is seriously oc∣cupied
with a desire of liberty, gnawing, from
time to time, the gates of its prison, but without
fury or precipitation, and with the sole view of
making an opening for its escape. In other mat∣ters,
it seems to be extremely indifferent, forming
no attachments<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We are told, however, by M. Klein, that he fed a beaver during several years, and that it followed, and went in quest of him, as dogs search for their masters.</NOTE>, and neither wishes to hurt nor
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
to please. In these relative qualities, which would
make him approach to man, he seems to be in∣ferior
to the dog. He appears to be formed
neither for serving, commanding, nor even hold∣ing
commerce with any other species than his
own. His sense, locked up in his own person,
never entirely manifests itself but among his own
tribe. When alone, he has little personal indu∣stry,
less artifice, and hardly prudence enough to
avoid the grossest snares. Instead of attacking
other animals, he is even very aukward in defend∣ing
himself. He prefers flight to combat, though
he bites cruelly when he finds himself seized by
the hand of the hunter.</P>
<P>If, then, we consider this animal in a state of
nature, or rather in a state of solitude and dis∣persion,
he appears not, by his internal qualities,
to rise above the other animals. He has not the
genius of a dog, the sense of an elephant, the
craftiness of the fox, &amp;c. but is more remark∣able
for some singularities of external conforma∣tion,
than for any apparent superiority of mental
faculties. He is the only quadruped furnished
with a flat, oval tail, covered with scales, which
he uses as a rudder to direct his course in the wa∣ter;
the only animal that has his hind-feet web∣bed,
and the toes of his fore-feet, which he em∣ploys
for carrying victuals to his mouth, sepa∣rate
from each other; the only quadruped that
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
resembles the land-animals in the anterior parts
of his body, and the aquatic animals in the po∣sterior.
He forms the link between quadrupeds
and fishes, as the bat does between quadrupeds
and birds. But these peculiarities would be ra∣ther
defects than perfections, if the beaver knew
not how to derive, from this singular conforma∣tion,
advantages which render him superior to
every other quadruped.</P>
<P>The beavers begin to assemble, in the month
of June or July, for the purpose of uniting into
society. They arrive in numbers, from all cor∣ners,
and soon form a troop of two or three hun∣dred.
The place of rendezvous is generally the
situation fixed for their establishment, and is al∣ways
on the banks of waters. If the waters be
flat, and never rise above their ordinary level, as
in lakes, the beavers make no bank or dam. But,
in rivers or brooks, where the waters are subject
to risings and fallings, they build a bank, and, by
this artifice, they form a pond or piece of water
which remains always at the fame height. The
bank traverses the river, from one side to the o∣ther,
like a sluice, and it is often from 80 to 100
feet long, by 10 or 12 broad at the base. This
pile, for animals of a size so small, appears to be
enormous, and supposes an incredible labour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The largest beavers weigh 50 or 60 pounds, and exceed not three feet in length, from the end of the muzzle to the origin of the tail,</NOTE>.
But the solidity with which the work is construc∣ted,
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
is still more astonishing than its magnitude.
The part of the river where they erect this bank
is generally shallow. If they find on the margin
a large tree, which can be made to fall into the
water, they begin with cutting it down, to form
the principal part of their work. This tree is of∣ten
thicker than the body of a man. By gnaw∣ing
the foot of the tree with their four cutting
teeth, they accomplish their purpose in a very
short time, and always make the tree fall across
the river. They next cut the branches from the
trunk, to make it lie level. These operations are
performed by the whole community. Several
beavers are employed in gnawing the foot of the
tree, and others in lopping off the branches after
it has fallen. Others, at the same time, traverse
the banks of the river, and cut down smaller trees,
from the size of a man's leg to that of his thigh.
These they dress, and cut to a certain length, to
make stakes of them, and first drag them by land
to the margin of the river, and then by water to
the place where the building is carrying on.
These piles they sink down, and interweave the
branches with the larger stakes. This operation
implies the vanquishing of many difficulties; for,
to dress these stakes, and to put them in a situa∣tion
nearly perpendicular, some of the beavers
must elevate, with their teeth, the thick ends a∣gainst
the margin of the river, or against the
cross-tree, while others plunge to the bottom, and
dig holes with their fore-feet, to receive the points,
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
that they may stand on end. When some are
labouring in this manner, others bring earth,
which they plash with their feet, and beat firm
with their tails. They carry the earth in their
mouths, and with their fore-feet, and transport it
in such quantities, that they fill with it all the
intervals between the piles. These piles consist
of several rows of stakes, of equal height, all pla∣ced
opposite to each other, and extend from one
bank of the river to the other. The stakes facing
the under part of the river, are placed perpendi∣cularly;
but the rest of the work slopes upwards
to sustain the pressure of the fluid; so that the
bank, which is 10 or 12 feet wide at the base, is
reduced to two or three at the top. It has, there∣fore,
not only all the necessary thickness and so∣lidity,
but the most advantageous form for sup∣porting
the weight of the water, for preventing
its issue, and to repel its efforts. Near the top,
or thinnest part of the bank, they make two or
three sloping holes, to allow the surface-water to
escape, and these they enlarge or contract, accor∣ding
as the river rises or falls; and, when any
breaches are made in the bank by sudden or vio∣lent
inundations, they know how to repair them
as soon as the water subsides.</P>
<P>It would be superfluous, after this account of
their public work, to give a detail of their parti∣cular
operations, were it not necessary, in a hi∣story
of these animals, to mention every fact, and
were not the first great structure made with a
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
view to render their smaller habitations more
commodious. These cabins or houses are built
upon piles near the margin of the pond, and have
two openings, the one for going to the land, and
the other for throwing themselves into the wa∣ter.
The form of the edifices is either oval or
round, some of them larger and some less, vary∣ing
from four or five, to eight or ten feet diameter.
Some of them consist of three or four stories;
and their walls are about two feet thick, raised
perpendicularly upon planks, or plain stakes,
which serve both for foundations and floors to
their houses. When they consist but of one story,
the walls rise perpendicularly only a few feet, af∣terwards
assume a curved form, and terminate in
a dome or vault, which serves them for a roof.
They are built with amazing solidity, and neatly
plastered both without and within. They are
impenetrable to rain, and resist the most impetu∣ous
winds. The partitions are covered with a
kind of stu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>co, as nicely plastered as if it had been
executed by the hand of man. In the application
of this mortar, their tails serve for trowels, and their
feet for plashing. They employ different mate∣rials,
as wood, stone, and a kind of sandy earth,
which is not subject to dissolution in water. The
wood they use is almost all of the light and tender
kinds, as alders, poplars, and willows, which ge∣nerally
grow on the banks of rivers, and are more
easily barked, cut, and transported, than the hea∣vier
and more solid species of timber. When
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
they once attack a tree, they never abandon it till
they cut it down, and carry it off. They always
begin the operation of cutting at a foot, or a
foot and a half above the ground: They labour
in a sitting posture; and, beside the convenience
of this situation, they enjoy the pleasure of gnaw∣ing
perpetually the bark and wood, which are
most palatable to their taste; for they prefer fresh
bark and tender wood to most of their ordinary
aliment. Of these provisions they lay up ample
stores, to support them during the winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The provision for eight or ten beavers, is twenty-five or thirty feet in length, by eight or ten feet in thickness. They transport not into their cabins wood or bark, till cut into thin slices, and just prepared for eating. They love fresh wood better than what has been floated, and go out, from time to time, during the winter, to eat fresh provisions in the forests; <HI>Mem. de l'Acad▪ ann.</HI> 1704.</NOTE>; but
they are not fond of dry wood. It is in the wa∣ter,
and near their habitations, that they establish
their magazines. Each cabin has its own maga∣zine,
proportioned to the number of its inhabi∣tants,
who have all a common right to the store,
and never pillage their neighbours. Some vil∣lages
are composed of twenty or twenty-five ca∣bins.
But these large establishments are rare;
and the common republic seldom exceeds ten or
twelve families, of which each has his own quar∣ter
of the village, his own magazine, and his se∣parate
habitation. They allow not strangers to
set down in their neighbourhood. The smallest
cabins contain two, four, or six; and the largest
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
eighteen, twenty, and, it is alledged, sometimes
thirty beavers. They are almost always equally
paired, being the same number of females as of males.
Thus, upon a moderate computation, the society is
often composed of 150 or 200, who all, at first,
laboured jointly, in raising the great public build∣ing,
and afterwards in select tribes or companies,
in making particular habitations. In this society,
however numerous, an universal peace is main∣tained.
Their union is cemented by common
labours; and it is rendered perpetual by mutual
convenience, and the abundance of provisions
which they amass and consume together. Mode∣rate
appetites, a simple taste, an aversion against
blood and carnage, deprive them of the idea of
rapine and war. They enjoy every possible good,
while man only knows how to pant after it.
Friends to each other, if they have some foreign
enemies, they know how to avoid them. When
danger approaches, they advertise one another,
by striking their tail on the surface of the water,
the noise of which is heard at a great distance,
and resounds through all the vaults of their ha∣bitations.
Each takes his part; some plunge in∣to
the lake, others conceal themselves within their
walls, which can only be penetrated by the fire
of heaven, or the steel of man, and which no a∣nimal
will attempt either to open or to overturn.
These retreats are not only very safe, but neat
and commodious. The floors are spread over
with verdure: The branches of the box and the
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir serve them for carpets, upon which they per∣mit
not the least dirtiness. The window that
faces the water answers for a balcony to receive
the fresh air, and to bathe. During the greatest
part of the day, they sit on end, with their head
and anterior parts of the body elevated, and their
posterior parts sunk in the water. This win∣dow
is made with caution, the aperture of which
is sufficiently raised to prevent its being stopped
up with the ice, which, in the beaver climates, is
often two or three feet thick. When this hap∣pens,
they slope the sole of the window, cut ob∣liquely
the stakes which support it, and thus open a
communication with the unfrozen water. This
element is so necessary, or rather so agreeable to
them, that they can seldom dispense with it.
They often swim a long way under the ice: It is
then that they are most easily taken, by attacking
the cabin on one hand, and, at the same time,
watching at a hole made at some distance, where
they are obliged to repair for the purposes of
respiration. The continual habit of keeping their
tail and posterior parts in the water, appears to
have changed the nature of their flesh. That of
their anterior parts, as far as the reins, has the
taste and consistence of the flesh of land or air
animals; but that of the tail and posteriors has
the odour and all the other qualities of fish. The
tail, which is a foot long, an inch thick, and five
or six inches broad, is even an extremity or ge∣nuine
portion of a fish, attached to the body of a
quadruped: It is entirely covered with scales,
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
and with a skin perfectly similar to those of large
fishes. They may be scraped off with a knife,
and, after falling, they leave an impression on the
skin, as is the case with all fishes.</P>
<P>It is in the beginning of summer that the bea∣vers
assemble. They employ the months of July
and August in the construction of their bank and
cabins. They collect, in September, their pro∣visions
of bark and wood: Afterwards they en∣joy
the fruits of their labours, and taste the sweets
of domestic happiness. This is the time of re∣pose,
and the season of love. Knowing and lo∣ving
one another from habit, from the pleasures
and fatigues of a common labour, each couple
join not by chance, nor by the pressing necessities
of nature, but unite from choice and from taste.
They pass together the autumn and the winter:
Perfectly satisfied with each other, they never se∣parate.
At ease in their cabins, they go not out
but upon agreeable or useful excursions, to bring
in supplies of fresh bark, which they prefer to
what is too dry or too much moistened with wa∣ter.
The females are said to go pregnant for four
months; they bring forth in the end of winter,
and generally produce two or three young ones.
About this time, they are left by the males, who
retire to the country to enjoy the pleasures and
the fruits of the spring. They return, occasion∣ally,
to their cabins; but dwell there no more.
The mothers continue in the cabins, and are oc∣cupied
in nursing, protecting, and rearing their
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
young, who, at the end of a few weeks, are in a
condition to follow their dams. The females,
in their turn, make little excursions to recruit
themselves by the air, by eating fishes, crabs, and
fresh bark, and, in this manner, pass the summer
upon the waters, and in the woods. They as∣semble
not again till autumn, unless their banks
or cabins be overturned by inundations; for,
when accidents of this kind happen, they sudden∣ly
collect their forces, in order to repair the
breaches which have been made.</P>
<P>Some places they prefer to others for their ha∣bitation,
and they have been observed, after ha∣ving
their labours frequently destroyed, to return
every summer to repair them, till, being-fatigued
with this persecution, and weakened by the loss of
several of their numbers, they took the resolu∣tion
of changing their abode, and of retiring to
solitudes still more profound. It is in winter
that they are chiefly sought by the hunters;
because their fur is not perfectly sound in any
other season: And, after their village is ruined,
and numbers of them are taken, the society is
sometimes too much reduced to admit of a fresh
establishment; but those which escape death or
captivity, disperse and become vagabond. Their
genius, withered by fear, never again expands.
They hide themselves, and their talents, in holes;
or, sunk to the condition of other animals, they
lead a timid and a solitary life. Occupied only by
pressing wants, and exerting solely their indivi∣dual
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
powers, they lose forever those social qua∣lities
which we have been so justly admiring.</P>
<P>However marvellous the society and the opera∣tions
I have now described may appear, it is im∣possible
to doubt of their reality. All the facts
mentioned by numbers of eye-witnesses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See concerning the history of the beavers, <HI>Olaüs Magnus</HI> dans sa description des pays septentrionaux; les voyages du Baron de la Hontan, <HI>tom.

with those I have related: And, if my nar∣ration
differ from some which have been given, it
is only in a few points that I judged too mar∣vellous
and improbable to be credited. Authors
have not limited themselves to the social man∣ners
of the beavers, and to their evident talents
for architecture, but have ascribed to them gene∣ral
ideas of police and of government. They
have affirmed, that, after the beavers have esta∣blished
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
a society, they reduce strangers and travel∣lers
of their own species into slavery; that these
they employ to carry their earth and to drag
their trees; that they treat in the same manner
the lazy and the old of their own society; that
they turn them on their backs, and make them
serve as vehicles for the carriage of their mate∣rials;
that these republicans never associate but
in an odd number, in order to have always a
casting voice in their deliberations; that each tribe
has its chief: that they have established sentinels
for the public safety; that, when pursued, they
tear off their testicles, to satisfy the a varice of their
hunters; that, in this mutilated state, they exhi∣bit
themselves to procure the compassion of their
persecutors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Aelian, and all the antients, except Pliny, who, like a philosopher, denies the fact. For the other articles, see most of the authors quoted in the preceding note.</NOTE>, &amp;c. In proportion as we reject
with contempt those exaggerated fables, we must
admit the facts which are established and confirmed
by moral certainties. The works of this animal
have been a thousand times viewed, measured,
overturned, designed, and engraven. What is
still more convincing, some of these singular
works still subsist, though less common than when
North America was first discovered, and have
been seen by all the missionaries, and all the la∣test
travellers who have penetrated into the nor∣thern
regions of that continent.</P>
<P>It is universally agreed, that, beside the beavers
who live in society, there are, in the same climate,
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
others who are solitary, and rejected, it is said,
from the social state for their crimes, reap∣ing
none of its advantages, having neither house
nor magazine, and living, like the badger, in holes
under the ground. These solitary beavers are
called <HI>terriers.</HI> They are easily distinguished by
their dirty and tattered robe; for the hair of their
back is rubbed off by the friction of the earth.
They live, like the other kind, upon banks of
waters, where some of them make a ditch of se∣veral
feet deep, in order to form a pond that may
reach to the mouth of their hole, which frequent∣ly
exceeds 100 feet in length, and all along slopes
upward, to facilitate their retreat, in proportion
as the water rises during inundations. But there
are other solitary beavers, which live at a conside∣rable
distance from water. All our European bea∣vers
are terriers and solitary, and their fur is not
near so valuable as that of those which live in so∣ciety.
They differ in colour, according to the
climate they inhabit. In the northern deserts,
they are perfectly black, and their furs are finest;
but, even there, some are found entirely white, o∣thers
white spotted with gray, and others with a
mixture of red upon the nap of the neck and
haunches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Castor albus, cauda horizontaliter plana; <HI>Brisson. Regn. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nim.</HI> p. 94.</NOTE>. In proportion as they recede from
the north, their colour turns clearer and more mix∣ed.

coloured; farther south, they are bay, and of a

pale straw colour among the Ilionois.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de la Nouvelle France, par le P. Charlevoix. tom. 2. p. 94.</NOTE>. In A∣merica,
beavers are found from the 30th degree of
north latitude to beyond the 60th. They are ve∣ry
frequent in the north, and gradually decrease
as we advance southward. The same thing holds in
the Old Continent: They never appear in num∣bers
but in the northern regions; and they
are very rare in France, Spain, Italy, Greece,
and Egypt. They were known to the antients.
The religion of the Magi prohibited the killing
of beavers. They were common on the margins
of the Pontus Euxinus, and were distinguished by
the name of <HI>Canes Pontici:</HI> But they probably were
not quiet enough in this situation, (for the coasts of
this country have been frequented by men from
the earliest periods of history), since their socie∣ty
and labours are mentioned by none of the
antients. Aelian, in particular, who betrays so
strong an affection for the marvellous, and who,
I believe, first advanced that the beaver cut off
his testicles to allow them to be collected by the
hunters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist anim. lib. 6. cap. 34.</NOTE>, would never have failed to mention
the wonders of their republic, and their talents
for architecture. Even Pliny himself, whose
bold, sublime, and melancholy genius, made him
uniformly despise men to exalt Nature, could not
have abstained from comparing the labours of
Romulus to those of the beavers. It is, there∣fore,
apparent, that their industry in building
<PB N="41" REF="54"/>
was altogether unknown to the antients; and,
although cabined beavers have lately been found
in Norway, and in other northern regions of
Europe, and though it is probable that the an∣tient
beavers built as well as the modern; yet,
as the Romans never penetrated so far north, it
is not surprising that their writers are silent on
this subject.</P>
<P>Several authors have affirmed, that the beaver,
being an aquatic animal, could not live upon land,
without water. But this notion is false; for the
young beaver sent me from Canada was always
kept in the house; and, when first presented to
water, it was afraid, and refused to enter into
that element. But, after being forced and re∣tained
in a bason, it grew so easy in a few
minutes, that it made no attempts to get out;
and, when left at liberty, it often returned to the
water spontaneously. It likewise avails itself of
the mire and moist pavements. One day he e∣scaped,
and descended by a stair into the subter∣raneous
vaults in the royal garden. He conti∣nued
for some time to swim on the stagnant wa∣ter
in the bottom of these vaults. However, as
soon as he saw the light of the torches which were
brought to search for him, he returned to those
who called him, and allowed himself quietly to
be taken. He is familiar, without being cares∣sing:
He asks to eat from those who are at table;
and his petitions consist of a small plaintive cry,
and some gestures with his hand. When he re∣ceives
<PB N="42" REF="55"/>
a morsel, he carries off and conceals it, to
be eaten at leisure. He sleeps pretty often, re∣posing
on his belly. He eats every thing, except∣ing
flesh, which he constantly refuses, whether
it be raw or roasted. He gnaws every thing he
can find, stuffs, furniture, wood, &amp;c.; and we
have been obliged to line, with a double coat of
white-iron, the barrel in which he was trans∣ported.</P>
<P>Though the beavers prefer the margins of lakes,
rivers, and other fresh waters; yet they are found
on the sea-coasts, but principally on mediterra∣nean
gulfs which receive great rivers, where the
water has not its usual saltness. They are hostile
to the otter, whom they chace, and will not per∣mit
to appear in the waters they frequent. The
fur of the beaver is finer and more bushy than
that of the otter: It consists of two kinds of hair;
the one, which is short, but bushy, fine as down,
and impenetrable by water, immediately covers
the skin; the other, which is longer, firmer, more
splendid, but thinner, serves the former as a sur∣tout,
defending it from dust and dirt. This se∣cond
kind of hair is of little value; it is the first
alone that is employed in our manufactures. The
black furs are generally most bushy, and conse∣quently
in greatest esteem. The fur of the ter∣rier
beaver is much inferior to that of the cabin-building
kind. The beavers, like all other qua∣drupeds,
cast their hair in summer; and the furs
of those caught during this season are of little va∣lue.
<PB N="43" REF="56"/>
The fur of the white beaver is greatly e∣steemed,
upon account of it rarity; and the per∣fectly
black furs are nearly as rare as the white.</P>
<P>But, beside the fur, which is the most precious
article, the beaver furnishes a matter, of which
great use has been made in medicine. This mat∣ter,
called <HI>castoreum,</HI> is contained in two large
bags or bladders, which the antients mistook for
the testicles of the animal. We shall here give
neither the description nor the uses of that sub∣stance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Le Traité du castor, par Marius et Francus.</NOTE>, because they are to be found in all our
dispensatories<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is alledged that the beavers press out this liquor with their feet, that it restores their appetite after a disgust, and that the savages rub the snares with it which they lay for ap∣prehending them. It is more certain, however, that they use this liquor for greasing their hair.</NOTE>. The savages, it is said, extract an
oil from the tail of the beaver, and use it as a to∣pical
application for several diseases. The flesh
of the beaver, though fat and delicate, has always
a disagreeable flavour. Their bones are said to
be excessively hard; but, concerning this fact, we
have had no opportunities of determining, because
we only dissected a young one. Their teeth are
very hard, and so sharp, that they are used by
the savages as knives to cut, hollow, and polish
their timber. The savages clothe themselves
with beavers skins; and, in winter, turn the shag∣gy
side inward; and these, from their having
imbibed much sweat from the perspiration of
<PB N="44" REF="57"/>
their wearers, are called <HI>fat-beaver,</HI> or <HI>coat-bea∣ver,</HI>
and are only employed for coarse works.</P>
<P>The beaver uses his fore-feet, like hands, with
equal dexterity as the squirrel, the toes being
well separated; but those of the hind-feet are
united by a membrane. These they employ as
fins, and extend them like the toes of a goose,
which animal they resemble in their walking up∣on
land. The beaver swims better than he runs:
As his fore-legs are much shorter than the hind
ones, he always walks with his head low, and his
back arched. His senses are extremely delicate,
especially the sense of smelling. Dirtiness and
bad smells seem to be perfectly insupportable to
him. When retained in confinement too long,
and obliged to void his excrements, he places them
near the threshold of the door, and, as soon as
it is opened, he pushes them out. This habit of
cleanliness is natural to them; and our young
beaver never failed, in this manner, to clean his
habitation. At the age of twelve months, he
exhibited marks of ardour for a female, which
renders it probable that he had then nearly at∣tained
his full growth. Hence the duration of
life in these animals cannot be very long; per∣haps
it is too much to extend it to fifteen or
twenty years. It is not astonishing that this bea∣ver
was smaller than others of his age, having
been perpetually confined almost from his birth;
and, being unacquainted with water till he was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine months old, he could neither grow nor ex∣pand

<P>We formerly remarked, that the beaver was
an animal common to both Continents; and they
are, in fact, as frequent in Siberia as in Canada.
They may be easily tamed, and even taught to
fish, and to bring home their prey to the family.
M. Kalm assures us of this fact:</P>
<P>“I have seen in America,” says he, “beavers so
fully tamed, that, when sent out to fish, they
brought home the booty to their master. I have
also seen others which were so familiar with their
masters, and with the dogs, that they followed
them, accompanied them in the boats, jumped
into the water, and, in a moment after, return∣ned
with a fish.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Kalm, tom. 2. p. 350.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>“We have seen,” says M. Gmelin, “in a small
village of Siberia, a beaver that was brought
up in the house, and was so exceedingly trac∣table,
that he sometimes made voyages to a con∣siderable
distance, decoyed females, and brought
them home; after the season of love was over,
these females returned without any conduc∣tor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Kamtschatka, p. 73.</NOTE>.”</P>

<P>THOUGH several authors have described this
animal under the name of <HI>Coati,</HI> to prevent
its being confounded with the true <HI>Coati,</HI> or e∣ven
with the <HI>Coati-mondi,</HI> we have adopted its
English name.</P>
<P>The raccoon which we have had alive, and kept
him twelve months, was of the size and figure
of a small badger. Its body is thick and short,
and the hair long, bushy, black at the points,
and gray underneath. His head resembles that
of the fox; but his ears are round and much
shorter. The eyes are large, and of a yellowish
green colour. Above the eyes, a black band runs a∣cross;
<PB N="47" REF="61"/>
the muzzle is slender, the nose somewhat
turned up, and the upper lip advances beyond
the under one. He has, like the dog, six cut∣ting
teeth, and two canine in each jaw. The
tail is bushy, as long as the body, and marked
alternately with black and white rings through
its whole extent. The fore-legs are much short∣er
than the hind ones; and there are five toes,
armed with strong sharp claws, on each foot.
The hind feet rest so much on the heel, that the
animal can elevate and support its body in a po∣sition
inclined forwards. He uses the fore-feet
in carrying food to his mouth. But, as his toes
are rigid, and have little flexibility, he uses both
hands at a time in laying hold of what is given
him. Though thick and short, he is very agile:
His claws, which are sharp as thorns, enable
him to climb trees with great facility. He
mounts the trunk with alacrity, and runs to
the extremities of branches. He goes by leaps,
rather gambols than walks, and his movements,

<P>This animal is a native of the southern parts of
America. He is never found in the Antient Con∣tinent;
at least, those travellers who have de∣scribed
the animals of Africa and the East Indies
make no mention of him. But he is very com∣mon
in the warm regions of America, and parti∣cularly
in Jamaica<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sloane's Nat. hist of Jamaica, tom. 2. p. 329.</NOTE>, where he lives in the moun∣tains,
from which he descends to eat the sugar

excessive cold. M. Klein<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Klein, quad p. 62.</NOTE> kept one at Dant∣zick;

<P>The raccoon softens, or rather dilutes, in wa∣ter
every thing he intends to eat. He throws
his bread into the bason that holds his water;
and, unless pressed with hunger, he removes it
not till it be well soaked. But, when very hun∣gry,
he eats dry food, or any thing that is presented
to him. He searches about and eats every thing
that he can find, as flesh, either crude or prepared,
fishes, eggs, living fowls, grain, roots, &amp;c. He
likewise devours all kinds of insects. He de∣lights
in hunting spiders; and, when at liberty
in the garden, he eats grasshoppers, snails, and
worms. He loves sugar, milk, and other soft
kinds of nourishment, excepting fruits; but
all these he rejects, when he can have flesh or
fish. He retires to a distance to obey the calls of
nature. He is familiar, and even caressing; for
he leaps upon those he is fond of, playing spon∣taneously,
and perpetually moving about with
great agility. He appears to have much of the
nature of the maki, and to possess some of the
qualities of the dog.</P>

<P>Concerning the raccoon, I have received the
following communication from M. Blanquart
des Salines, in a letter dated Calais, October 29.
1775.</P>
<P>“My raccoon, before he came into my posses∣sion,
had always been chained. In this state of
captivity, he was very gentle, but had little in∣clination
to caress. The people of the house
were all equally kind to him; but he received
them differently; for what pleased him in one,
he revolted against in another; and in this his
conduct was invariable.</P>
<P>“His chain sometimes broke; and liberty
rendered him insolent. He took possession of an
apartment, would allow none to enter, and it
was with some difficulty that he could again be
reconciled to bondage. Since he came under my
management, I have frequently given him his
liberty. Without losing sight of him, I allow∣ed
him to walk about with his chain; and each
time his gratitude was expressed by a thousand
caressing gambols. But this is by no means the
case when he makes his escape himself. He
then roams about, sometimes for three or four
days together, upon the roofs of the neighbour∣ing
houses, descends, during the night-time,
into the court-yards, enters the hen-houses,
<PB N="50" REF="65"/>
strangles all the poultry, and eats their heads.
His chain does not render him more humane,
but only more circumspect. He then employs
every artifice to make the fowls grow familiar
with him; he permits them to partake of his
victuals; and it is only after having inspired them
with the highest notions of security, that he
seizes one, and tears it in pieces. Some young
cats have met with the same fate. The motions
of this animal, though light, are always oblique;
and I doubt whether he can overtake other ani∣mals
by running. He opens oisters with won∣derful
dexterity. His sense of touching must be
exquisite. In all his little operations, he seldom
uses either his nose or his eye. For example,
he makes an oister pass under his hind-paws;
then, without looking at it, he searches with his
hands for the weakest part; there he sinks his
claws, separates the shells, and leaves not a ve∣stige
of the fish. In all this operation, neither his
eyes nor his nose, which he keeps at a distance,
are of the least use to him.</P>
<P>“This raccoon is not very grateful for the ca∣resses
he receives; but is extremely sensible of
bad treatment. A servant one day gave him se∣veral
lashes with a whip. But this man has e∣ver
since endeavoured in vain to accomplish a
reconciliation. Neither eggs nor fishes, of which
the animal is exceedingly fond, can appease his
resentment. At the approach of the servant, the
raccoon flies into a rage; his eyes kindle; he
<PB N="51" REF="66"/>
springs at the man, utters most dolorous cries, and
rejects every thing presented to him, till the
disagreeable object disappears. The accents of
his rage are very singular, sometimes resembling
the whistling noise of the curlew, and some∣times
the hoarse barking of an old dog.</P>
<P>“If any one strikes him, if he is attacked by
an animal that he thinks stronger than himself,
he makes no resistance; but, like the hedge-hog,
conceals his head and feet by rolling up his body
in the form of a ball; no complaint escapes him;
and, in this position, he calmly submits to be
killed.</P>
<P>“I remarked, that he never allowed hay or
straw to remain in his nest; but chose rather
to lie upon wood. When litter is put in, he in∣stantly
throws it out. I never perceived that
cold made him uneasy. Of three winters,
he has passed two exposed to all the rigours of
the air. I have seen him covered with snow,
having no shelter, and yet in good health. I i∣magine
that he is not solicitous about heat. Du∣ring
the last frosts, I presented to him warm wa∣ter,
and water almost frozen, for diluting his
food; but he uniformly preferred the latter.
He had liberty of sleeping in the stable; but
often preferred a corner of the court.</P>
<P>“The defect of saliva, or having but a small
quantity of it, is, I imagine, the reason why this
animal dilutes his food with water. He never
wets fresh or bloody meat, nor a peach, nor a
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
raisin. But he plunges every thing that is dry
into his bason.</P>
<P>“He abhors children; their crying irritates
him; and he makes every effort to spring upon
them. A small bitch, of which he is fond, he
chastises severely when she barks too loud. I
know not why several animals equally detest
sharp cries. In the year 1770, I had five white
mice. I happened to make one of them cry;
the others attacked it: I continued to make it
cry; and they killed it.</P>
<P>“This raccoon is a female; she comes in sea∣son
in the beginning of summer, and her ardour for
the male continues six weeks. During this period,
nothing can quiet her; every object is disgust∣ing;
and she hardly takes nourishment. A hun∣dred
times each day she passes, between her
thighs and between her fore-feet, her bushy tail,
which she seizes by the end with her teeth, and
agitates perpetually, to give friction to the parts.</P>
<P>“This animal acquires not its full growth till
it be two years and a half old.”</P>

<P>THIS animal has been called <HI>Coati-mondi</HI>
by several authors. We have had it alive;
and, after comparing it with the Coati mentioned
by Thevet, and described by Marcgrave, we dis∣covered
the Coati and Coati-mondi to be only
varieties of the same species; for Marcgrave, af∣ter
describing the coati, says expressly, that there
are other coati of a dark brown colour, called, for
the sake of distinction, <HI>coati-mondi</HI> by the Brasi∣lians.
He admits not, therefore, any other dif∣ference
between the coati and coati-mondi, but
that of the colour of the hair; and hence they
can only be regarded as varieties of the same spe∣cies.

The coati is very different from the raccoon
described in the preceding article. He is of a
smaller stature; his body and neck, head, and
muzzle, are much longer; the upper jaw is ter∣minated
by a kind of moveable snout, which
stretches an inch, or an inch and a half, beyond
the extremity of the under jaw. This turned up
snout, joined to the length of the jaws, gives to
the muzzle a curved and elevated appearance.
The coati has also smaller eyes than the raccoon,
shorter ears, longer, coarser, and less variegated
hair, shorter legs, and longer feet; and it rests
still more upon the heel. Like the raccoon, it
has an annulated tail<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some coatis have the tail of one uniform colour; but, as there are no other differences, they must be considered only as varieties, and not as distinct species.</NOTE>, and five toes on each foot.</P>
<P>Some authors regard the sow-badger as a coati,
and have added to this genus the <HI>taxus suillus</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brisson. Regn. anim. p. 263.</NOTE>,
of which Aldrovandus has given a figure. But,
when it is considered, that the sow-badger men∣tioned
by hunters, is supposed to be found in
France, and even in colder European climates,
and that, on the contrary, the coati never appears
but in the southern climates of the New Conti∣nent,
this notion must be rejected, as having no
foundation to support it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See what we remarked concerning the Taxus suillus, ar∣ticle Badger.</NOTE>; for the figure given
by Aldrovandus is nothing more than that of a
<PB N="55" REF="74"/>
badger, with the addition of a sow's snout. The
author pretends not to have drawn this animal
from nature; and he has given no description of
it. The long muzzle and moveable snout suffi∣ciently
distinguish the coati from all other ani∣mals.
Like the bear, the coati stands with ease
on his hind-feet, resting upon his broad heels,
that are terminated by large callosities, which
extend outward, and augment the base of the
feet.</P>
<P>The coati has a trick of gnawing his own tail,
which, when not mutilated, exceeds the length
of the body; he generally carries his tail erect,
and sweeps it about from side to side. This re∣markable
practice of gnawing the tail is not,
however, peculiar to the coati; the monkeys, the
<HI>makis,</HI> and some other animals which have long
tails, shorten them one third, or one fourth, by
eating both the flesh and the vertebrae. This
gave rise to a general conclusion, that, in very
long members, the extremities of which are, of
course, removed to a great distance from the
centre of feeling, the sensation of feeling is weak,
and that this weakness of feeling is proportion∣ed
to the distance and the thinness of the part;
for, if the extremity of the tail, in those animals,
was very sensible, the pain excited would be
stronger than the desire of mutilation, and they
would preserve their tails with equal anxiety as
the other parts of their bodies. Upon the whole,
<PB N="56" REF="75"/>
the coati is an animal of prey, who lives upon
flesh and blood, and who, like the fox or martin,
devours small animals and fowls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave, hist. Brasil. p. 228.</NOTE>, eats eggs, and
hunts for the nests of birds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Thevet, Singular. de la France Antarct. p. 96.</NOTE>; and it is, pro∣bably,
from this conformity of disposition, rather
than from any resemblance to the martin, that
the coati has been considered as a small species of
the fox<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Seventh volume of the Transactions of the Swe∣dish Academy, we have the following remarks concerning the coati-mondi, by Linnaeus, which we shall transcribe, without pretending to vouch the facts he delivers.</P>
<P>“This animal,” says Linnaeus, “is <HI>equally</HI> numerous both in <HI>South</HI> and in <HI>North</HI> America. In the length of his hind-legs, the inclination of his head, the bushiness of his hair, and in his paws, he resembles the bear. But he is small and fa∣miliar; and his tail is very long, and variegated with diffe∣rent colours. The Prince of Sweden made a present of one of these animals to Linnaeus, who kept him a considerable time, but lost all the labour be bestowed in attempting to ci∣vilize him; for the coati-mondi, when he could slip into the court-yard, <HI>violating all the rights of hospitality,</HI> tore off the <HI>heads</HI> of the poultry, and <HI>drank</HI> their blood. He was so ob∣stinate, that he would do nothing contrary to his inclination. Notwithstanding the smallness of this animal, he defended himself with great force, when any body attempted to seize him against his will; and he stuck fast to the legs of those with whom he was familiar, when he wanted to <HI>ransack</HI> their <HI>poc∣kets,</HI> and carry off what he found in them. But there is a <HI>remedy</HI> for this <HI>obstinacy.</HI> The coati has an extreme aversion to hog's bristles; and the smallest <HI>brush</HI> makes him desert his enterprise. He was <HI>one day</HI> worried by a mastiff; and M. Linnaeus <HI>dissected</HI> him. His mode of living was very singu∣lar. He slept from midnight till noon, waked the rest of the day, and uniformly walked about from six in the evening till midnight, without the least regard to the weather. This is probably the time assigned by nature to this species of ani∣mals, when in their own <HI>country,</HI> for procuring their food, for hunting birds, and discovering their eggs, which constitute their principal nourishment;” <HI>Biblioth. raisonnée, tom. 41. part. 1. p.</HI> 25.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS animal is about the size of a hare,
and has been regarded, by most systematic
writers, as a species of rabbit, or large rat. These,
however, it resembles in some minute characters
only; but, in natural dispositions, it differs es∣sentially
from them. It has the rudeness of hair,
the grunting, and likewise the voracious appetite
<PB N="59" REF="80"/>
of a hog; and, when fully glutted, it conceals,
like the fox, the remainder of its food in different
places. The agouti delights in cutting and gnaw∣ing
every thing he meets with. When irritated,
the hair of his back rises, and he strikes the ground
forcibly with his hind-feet. His bite is cruel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This animal is very mischievous: The capuchins of Olinda in Brasil brought up a young one, and used the pre∣caution of extracting his teeth; yet he continued to extend his devastations as far as his chain allowed him; <HI>Hist. des Indes par Souchu de Rennefort,</HI> p. 203.</NOTE>.
He digs not a hole, like the rabbit, nor sits on the
ground like the hare; but generally lives in the
hollows of decayed trees. Fruits, potatoes, and
manioc, are the common food of those which live
near the habitations of men. But those that live
in the woods and savannahs, feed upon leaves
and roots, plants and shrubs. The agouti, like
the squirrel, uses his fore-feet in holding his food,
and carrying it to his mouth. He runs very
nimbly both on plain and rising grounds. But,
as his fore-legs are much shorter than his hind-legs,
he would tumble headlong, if he did not
slacken his course in descending. Both his eye
and his ear are fine. He stops and listens to the
sound of music. The flesh of those which are fat
and well fed, is not very bad, though it be hard,
and not very agreeable to the taste. They scald
the agouti, and make him ready, in the same man∣ner
as a pig. He is hunted with dogs. When
forced among the cut sugar canes, he is soon ta∣ken;
because these grounds being generally co∣vered
<PB N="60" REF="81"/>
a foot thick with straw and leaves, at each
leap he sinks in this litter, so that a man may o∣vertake
and slay him with a baton. He com∣monly
runs very nimbly before the dogs; and,
when he gains his retreat, he lies squat, and re∣mains
obstinately in his concealment. The hun∣ters
are obliged to chace him out by filling his
hole with smoke: The animal, half suffocated,
utters mournful cries; but never issues forth, un∣less
when pushed to the last extremity. His cry,
which he often repeats when disturbed or irrita∣ted,
resembles that of a small hog. If taken
young, he is easily tamed, and goes out and re∣turns
of his own accord. These animals com∣monly
reside in the woods and hedges; where
the females choose a place well covered and bushy,
and there prepare a bed of leaves and hay for
their young. They annually produce two or
three, but generally two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des isles Antilles, par le Pere du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 296.</NOTE>. Like the cats, they
transport their young, two or three days after birth,
into the hollows of trees, where they suckle them
for a short time. The young are soon in a con∣dition
to follow their mother, and to search for
food. Thus their time of growth is short; and,
consequently, the duration of their lives cannot
be very long.</P>
<P>The agouti appears to be an animal peculiar to
the southern parts of America, none of them be∣ing
ever found in the old world. They are com∣mon
<PB N="61" REF="82"/>
in Brasil, in Guiana, in St Domingo, and in
all the islands. They seem to require a warm
climate in order to subsist and to multiply. They
can live, however, in France, if kept in a dry
place, and sheltered from the winter frosts. Even
in America, they appear not in the temperate or
cold regions. In the islands there is only the
species of agouti which we have described. But
at Cayenne, and in Guiana and Brasil, a second
species is mentioned, called <HI>Agouchi,</HI> which is
said to be uniformly smaller than the first. But
we are assured, by the evidence of people who
have lived long at Cayenne, and who know both
the agouti and agouchi, the latter of which we
have never been able to procure, that the animal
we have described is the true agouti. We had
it alive: It was as large as a rabbit; its hair was
rude, and of a brown colour, a little mixed with
red. Its upper lip was divided like that of the hare:
Its tail was still shorter than the tail of the rabbit:
The ears were short and broad. The upper jaw
advanced beyond the under: The muzzle re∣sembled
that of the dormouse, and the teeth
those of the marmot. The neck was long, and
the legs slender: It had four toes on the fore,
and three on the hind-feet. Marcgrave and
most naturalists after him, have asserted, that the
agouti had six toes on the hind-feet. M. Brisson
is the only writer who has not copied this error
of Marcgrave: Having described the animal
<PB N="62" REF="83"/>
from nature, he found, as we did, only three toes
on the hind-feet.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We have little to add concerning the agouti:
M. de la Borde informs us, that, in Guiana, it is
the most common quadruped, all the woods,
plains, heights, and even the marshes, being full
of them.</P>
<P>“The Agouti,” says he, “is about the
size of a hare; his skin is hard, and lasts
very long when employed as an upper-leather
to shoes. He has no grease: His flesh is as
white, and nearly as good as that of the rabbit,
having the same taste and flavour. Whether old
or young, their flesh is always tender; but those
which inhabit the sea-coast are best. They are
taken in traps, or hunted with dogs. The In∣dians
and Negroes, who know how to allure
them by whistling, or imitating their cries, kill
as many of them as they please. When pursued,
they conceal themselves, like the rabbits, in the
holes of old trees. They hold their food in their
paws, like the squirrels. Their ordinary food, which
they often conceal in the earth, to be used occa∣sionally,
are the nuts of the maripa, of the tour∣lovri,
of the corana, &amp;c.; and, after concealing
these nuts, they often touch them not for six

</FIGURE>
<PB N="63" REF="85"/>
months. They multiply as fast as the rabbits,
producing three, four, and sometimes five young
ones, during every season of the year. They
live not in numbers in the same hole; but they
are either found alone, or the mother with her
young. They are easily tamed, and eat almost
every thing. When in a domestic state, they re∣move
not to any great distance, and always re∣turn
to the house spontaneously. But they con∣stantly
retain a little of their savage disposition.
In general, they remain in their holes during the
night, unless the moon shines bright; but they
run about during most of the day. There are
some countries, as about the mouth of the river
of the Amazones, where these animals are so
numerous, that they are often met with in
scores.</P>

<P>THE influence of climate, in the human
species, is only marked by slight varieties;
because this species is single, and extremely di∣stinct
from every other. Man, white in Europe,
black in Africa, yellow in Asia, and red in A∣merica,
is the same animal, tinctured with the co∣lour
peculiar to the climate. As he is formed to
exercise dominion over the earth, and, as he has
the whole globe for his habitation, his nature seems
to be accommodated to every situation. Under
the fervours of the south, or the frozen regions
of the north, he lives, multiplies, and is so uni∣versally
and so antiently diffused over every coun∣try,
that he appears to have no peculiar climate.
<PB N="65" REF="87"/>
Among the other animals, on the contrary, the
influence of climate is stronger, and marked by
sensible characters; because they differ in species,
and their nature is less perfect, and less diffused
than that of man. The varieties of each species
are not only more numerous, and more strongly
marked, but even the differences of species them∣selves
seem to depend upon the differences of cli∣mate.
Some are unable to propagate but in warm,
and others cannot subsist but in cold countries.
The lion never inhabited the northern regions;
the rein-deer was never found in the south; and
perhaps no other species but that of man is gene∣rally
diffused over the whole surface of the globe.
Each has its peculiar country, to which it is con∣fined
by a physical necessity; each is a genuine
son of the country it inhabits; and it is in this
sense alone, that particular animals ought to be
called natives of a particular climate.</P>
<P>In warm countries, the land-animals are larger
and stronger than in the frozen or temperate re∣gions.
They are likewise more hardy and fe∣rocious.
All their natural qualities seem to ori∣ginate
from the ardour of the climate. Lions,
born under the scorching heats of Africa or the
Indies, are the strongest, the fiercest, and the most
formidable. Our wolves, and other carnivorous
animals, would hardly have the merit of being
his providers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a species of Lynx called <HI>the Lion's Provider.</HI></NOTE>. The lions of America, if they
deserve that name, are, like the climate, infinitely
<PB N="66" REF="88"/>
more mild than those of Africa; and, what proves
that the excess of their ferocity originates from
the excess of heat, is, that, in the same country,
those who inhabit the high mountains, where the
air is temperate, differ in disposition from those
who live in the plains, where the heat is extreme.
The lions of Mount Atlas, the summit of which
is sometimes covered with snow, have neither the
courage, the strength, nor the ferocity of the lions
of Biledulgerid or of Zaara, whose plains are co∣vered
with burning sands. It is chiefly in these
fervid deserts that we meet with those terrible
lions, who are the dread of travellers, and the
scourge of the neighbouring provinces. Happily
the species is not numerous: It even appears to
diminish daily; for, from the testimony of those
who have traversed this part of Africa, the num∣ber
of lions is not nearly so great as formerly.
The Romans, says Mr Shaw<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels.</NOTE>, drew from Lybia,
for their public spectacles, fifty times more lions
than could now be found in that country. It
has likewise been remarked, that, in Turkey,
Persia, and India, lions are much less frequent
than they were in antient times: And, as this
bold and powerful creature preys on every other
animal, and is himself a prey to none, the dimi∣nution
of the species can only be attributed to
the increase of the numbers of mankind; for, it
must be allowed, that the strength of the king of
animals is not match against the address of a
<PB N="67" REF="89"/>
Hottentot or a Negro, who often attack him, face
to face, with very light weapons. The lion, ha∣ving
no enemy but man, and his species being
reduced to a fiftieth, or, if you will, to a tenth
part of its former standard, it follows, that the
human species, instead of having suffered any
considerable diminution since the time of the Ro∣mans,
(as has been often alledged), is, on the con∣trary,
increased, even in such countries as Lybia,
where the power of man appeared to have been
greater during the aera of Carthage, than it is
now under that of Tunis and Algiers.</P>
<P>Man's industry augments in proportion to his
numbers; but that of the other animals remains
always the same. All the destructive species, as
that of the lion, seem to be banished to distant
regions, or reduced to a small number, not only
because mankind have increased, but because they
have also become more powerful, and have in∣vented
formidable arms which nothing can resist.
Would to God man had never combined the o∣perations
of steel and fire for other purposes than
those of destroying lions and tigers!</P>
<P>This superiority of man in numbers, and in
industry, which has impaired the force of the lion,
has likewise enervated his courage. Amòng a∣nimals,
this latter quality, though natural, rises
or falls according as the exertions of their
strength are successful or abortive. In the vast
deserts of Zaara, in those which seem to separate
two very different races of men, the Negroes and
<PB N="68" REF="90"/>
the Moors, in the unpeopled regions that lie a∣bout
the territories of the Hottentots, and, in
general, in all those southern parts of Africa and
Asia, which man has disdained to inhabit, the
lions are still very numerous, and continue in
their natural state. Accustomed to measure their
strength with that of every animal they meet, the
habit of conquering renders them terrible and in∣trepid.
Being ignorant of the power of man,
they are not afraid to encounter him. Having
never experienced the force of his arms, they
hold them in defiance. Wounds enrage, with∣out
terrifying them. They are not disconcerted
even by the appearance of numbers. A single lion
of the desert often attacks a whole caravan; and
if, after a violent and obstinate engagement, he
finds himself fatigued, instead of flying, he re∣treats
fighting, always opposing his face to the
enemy. Those lions, on the other hand, who
dwell in the neighbourhood of the towns or vil∣lages
of India or Barbary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 2. p. 213. &amp; la relation du Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 2. p. 112.</NOTE>, being acquainted with
man, and the power of his arms, have lost their
native fortitude to such a degree, that they fly
from the threatenings of his voice, and dare not
attack him. They content themselves with seizing
small cattle, and even fly before the women and
children<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 54.</NOTE>, who make them indignantly quit their
prey, by striking them with clubs.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="91"/>
This change, this softening in the temper of
the lion, indicates that he is susceptible of the im∣pressions
he receives, and that he must possess a
docility sufficient to render him tameable to a
certain degree, and to admit of a species of edu∣cation:
And history informs us, that lions have
been yoked in triumphal cars, and conducted to
the battle or the chace; and that, faithful to
their masters, they never exerted their strength
or their courage but in opposition to the com∣mon
enemy. This much is certain, that the lion,
when taken young, and brought up among do∣mestic
animals, is easily accustomed to live, and
even to sport innocently with them; that he is
gentle and caressing to his master; and that, if he
sometimes resumes his natural ferocity, he seldom
turns his rage against his benefactors. As his
movements are impetuous, and his appetites ve∣hement,
we ought not to presume that they can
always be balanced by the impressions of educa∣tion.
It is dangerous, therefore, to allow him to
want food too long, or to irritate him unnecessa∣rily.
Bad treatment not only enrages him, but
he remembers it, and seems to meditate revenge,
in the same manner as he remembers and requites
benefits received. Here I might quote a great
number of particular facts, some of which appear
to be exaggerated; but the whole, when combined,
are sufficient to prove, that the anger of the lion is
noble, his courage magnanimous, and his temper
susceptible of impressions. He has often been
<PB N="70" REF="92"/>
known to disdain the insults, and to pardon the of∣fensive
liberties of weak enemies. When led in∣to
captivity, he discovers symptoms of uneasiness,
without anger or peevishness; on the contrary,
he assumes habits of gentleness, obeys his master,
caresses the hand that feeds him, and sometimes
pardons the animals which are thrown to him
for prey. By this act of generosity, he seems to
consider himself as forever bound to protect them;
he lives peaceably with them, allows them a part,
and sometimes the whole of his food, and will
rather submit to the gnawings of hunger than
destroy the fruit of his own beneficence.</P>
<P>The lion cannot justly be branded with cruelty,
since he acts from necessity, and kills no more
than he consumes; while the tiger, the wolf, the
hyaena, and many other inferior species, such as
the fox, the martin, the polecat, the ferret, &amp;c.
delight in slaughter, and seem rather to gratify
their rage than their hunger.</P>
<P>The external appearance of the lion detracts
not from the noble and generous qualities of his
mind. His figure is respectable, his looks firm
and determined, his gait stately, and his voice
tremendous. His bulk is not excessive, like that
of the elephant or rhinoceros. He is not gross
and unwieldy, like the hippopotamus or the ox,
nor too contracted, like the hyaena or the bear,
nor lengthened to deformity, like the camel. The
body of the lion, on the contrary, is so well poised
and proportioned, that it may be regarded as a
<PB N="71" REF="93"/>
perfect model of strength combined with agility:
Equally solid and springy, neither surcharged
with fat nor with flesh, and containing nothing
superfluous, he seems to be constituted entirely of
nerves and of muscles. This great muscular force
is manifested by the prodigious leaps and bounds
which he performs with ease; by the brisk move∣ments
of his tail, a single sweep of which is suf∣ficient
to throw a man to the ground; by the
facility with which he moves the skin of his face,
and especially that of his front, which heightens
greatly the expression of fury; and, lastly, by the
power of moving the hair of his mane, which he
not only erects, but agitates on all sides, when he
is enraged.</P>
<P>To all these splendid individual qualities of the
lion, we may add the nobleness of his species.
By noble species in nature, I mean those which are
constant, invariable, and liable to no suspicion of
degradation. These species are commonly singu∣lar,
and of themselves constitute a genus. They
are distinguished by characters so deeply marked,
that they can neither be mistaken, nor confound∣ed
with any other. To begin with man, who is
the noblest being of the creation, his species is
single, since men of all races, of all climates, and
of all colours, can mix and propagate together;
and, at the same time, no animal can be said to
make any approaches to the human species by
natural relation. In the horse, the species is not
so noble as the individual; because he is so nearly
<PB N="72" REF="94"/>
approached by the ass, that a junction of the two
produces individuals, whom Nature treats as ba∣stards,
unworthy of the genuine race, and ren∣ders
incapable of perpetuating either species of
which they are the issue; but, as proceeding from
a mixture of the two, they fail not to demonstrate
the great affinity between them. In the dog, the
species is, perhaps, still less noble, because it
seems to be allied to those of the wolf, the fox,
and jackall, who may all be regarded as degene∣rated
branches of the same family. In descend∣ing
gradually to the inferior species, as those of
the rabbit, weasel, rat, &amp;c. we shall find, that
each particular species has a number of collateral
branches, of which we are unable to discover the
genuine root. Lastly, in the insects, which ought
to be regarded as the lowest species in Nature,
each kind is accompanied with so many neigh∣bouring
species, that we are obliged to denomi∣nate
them by genera only. This is the chief use
of methodical distributions, which ought not to be
employed, excepting in difficult enumerations of
the smallest objects in nature, but which become
totally useless, and even ridiculous, in treating of
the superior tribes. To class man with the
monkey, or to say, that the lion is <HI>a cat with a
long mane and tail,</HI> is to degrade and disfigure,
instead of describing or denominating the objects
of nature.</P>
<P>The species of the lion, therefore, is one of the
most noble, because it is single, and cannot be
<PB N="73" REF="95"/>
confounded with those of the tiger, leopard,
ounce, &amp;c. These species, which seem to be the
least removed from the lion, are so little distin∣guished
from each other, that they have often
been confounded by travellers and methodists<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the article Tiger, where we have mentioned some animals, to which this name has been improperly applied.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The largest lions are about eight or nine feet
long, by four or five feet high, and the tail is a∣bout
four feet long<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A very young lion, dissected by the gentlemen of the Academy, was seven and a half feet long, from the extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the tail, and four and a half feet high.</NOTE>. The small sized lions are
about five and a half feet long, by three and a half
feet high, and the tail is about three and a half feet
in length. The lioness, in all dimensions, is
about one fourth part less than the lion.</P>
<P>Aristotle<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist anim. cap. 44.</NOTE> distinguishes lions into the greater
and the smaller; the latter, he remarks, are pro∣portionally
shorter in the body, have their hair
more crisped, and are less courageous than the
former. He adds, that, in general, all lions are
of a yellow colour. The first of these facts
seems to be doubtful; for no traveller mentions
lions with crisped hair: Some authors, who,
in other respects, appear not to merit entire con∣fidence,
talk of a tiger with crisped hair, which is
found at the Cape of Good Hope<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Les Mem. de Kolbe, in which he calls this animal the <HI>Wolf-tiger.</HI></NOTE>. But almost
all authors agree as to the colour of the lion,
<PB N="74" REF="96"/>
which is yellow on the back, and whitish on the
sides and belly. Aelian and Oppian, however,
affirm, that the Ethiopian lions are as black as
the men; that, in India, there are lions entirely
white, and others spotted with different colours,
as red, black, and blue. But this seems not to
be supported by any authentic evidence; for
Marc-Paul, the Venetian, speaks not of these
spotted lions as if he had seen them; and Ges∣ner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner, hist anim. quad. p. 574.</NOTE>
properly remarks, that he only followed
Aelian. It appears, on the contrary, that there
are little or no varieties in this species; that the
lions of Africa and of Asia are perfectly similar;
and that the lions of the mountains differ from
those of the plains in stature only, and not in
colour.</P>
<P>The lion has a mane, or rather long hair
which covers almost all the anterior parts of his
body<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This mane consists of hair equally soft and smooth as that of the rest of the body.</NOTE>, and grows always longer as he advan∣ces
in age. But the lioness, however old, has no
mane. The American animal, called <HI>a Lion</HI> by
the Europeans, and <HI>Puma</HI> by the natives of Peru,
has no mane, and is also smaller, weaker, and less
courageous than the true lion. It is not impos∣sible,
that the mildness of this region of fouth
America should have had such influence on the
nature of the lion, as to deprive him of his mane,
and diminish both his courage and his stature.
But it seems to be an absolute impossibility, that
<PB N="75" REF="97"/>
this animal, who inhabits the countries within
the tropics only, and against whom nature ap∣pears
to have shut up every avenue to the north,
should have passed from the southern regions of A∣sia
or Africa into America, these continents being
divided from each other, towards the south, by
immense oceans. Hence we are led to conclude,
that the Puma is not a lion sprung from those
of the old world, and degenerated by the in∣fluence
of the climate of America, but that he is
an animal peculiar to America, like most animals
of the new Continent. When the Europeans first
discovered America, they found the quadrupeds,
birds, fishes, insects, plants, and almost every
thing, perfectly different from those of Europe.
It was, therefore, necessary to denominate the prin∣cipal
objects of this new world. The names given
them by the natives were mostly barbarous, and
very difficult to pronounce or to remember. The
names of objects were, of course, borrowed from
those of the European languages, and especially
from the Spanish and Portuguese. In this penury
of denomination, the smallest analogy in external
figure or in stature is sufficient to make us at∣tribute
to unknown objects, the names of those
with which we are acquainted. This gives rise
to endless uncertainties and confusion, which are
still farther augmented, not only by giving to
the productions of the new world the denomi∣nations
of those of the old, but by the continual
transportation of European plants and animals
<PB N="76" REF="98"/>
into America. To obviate these difficulties, we
ought carefully to distinguish what belongs to
the one continent, from what belongs to the o∣ther,
and to avoid the deceptions originating
from improper denominations. We shall per∣ceive
the necessity of this discrimination in the
subsequent article, where an enumeration of
the animals peculiar to both continents shall
be given.</P>
<P>M. de la Condamine, whose evidence merits
the highest credit, says expressly, that he knows
not whether the American animal called <HI>a Lion</HI>
by the Spaniards, and <HI>Puma</HI> by the natives of
Quito, deserves the name of a lion: He adds,
that it is much smaller than the African lion,
and that the male has no mane<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de l'Amerique Meridionale, p. 24.</NOTE>. Fresier like∣wise
informs us, that the animals called <HI>Lions</HI> in
Peru, are very different from those of Africa;
that they fly upon the approach of man; and that
they are dreadful only to the flocks: He farther
remarks, that their head somewhat resembles both
the head of the wolf and of the tiger; and that
their tail is less than the tail of either of these a∣nimals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Le voyage de Fresier a la mer du sud, p. 132.</NOTE>.
We learn, from more antient rela∣tions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Joseph Acosta, nat. hist. of the Indies.</NOTE>,
that the American lions have no resem∣blance
to those of Africa; that they have neither
the stature, nor the boldness of the true lion; that
they are neither red nor yellow, but of a gray
<PB N="77" REF="99"/>
colour; that they have no manes, and are accu∣stomed
to climb trees. Hence these animals dif∣fer
from the lion in stature, in colour, in the form
of the head, in the length of the tail, in the want
of manes, and in their manners and dispositions.
Characters so numerous and so essential ought for∣ever
to prevent us from confounding the Puma
of America with the genuine lion of Africa or of
Asia.</P>
<P>Though this noble animal inhabits the warm∣est
climates only, he can subsist for a great length
of time in temperate countries, and, perhaps, with
some attention, might even be enabled to propa∣gate.
Gesner relates, that lions were brought
forth in the menagerie of Florence; and Wil∣lough
by tells us, that, in Naples, a lioness that
had been impregnated by a lion in the same den,
brought forth five whelps at one litter. These
examples are rare; but, if true, they prove that
lions are not absolute strangers to a temperate
climate. None of them, however, exist in the
southern parts of Europe: In the age of Homer,
there were no lions in the Peloponnesus, although
they were then, and even in the days of Aristotle,
in Thrace, in Macedonia, and in Thessaly. It is
apparent, therefore, that, in all ages, they prefer∣red
the hot climates; that they seldom lived in
temperate countries; and that they never inha∣bited
the more northern regions. The natura∣lists
above quoted, who speak of lions brought
forth at Florence and Naples, are silent as to the
<PB N="78" REF="100"/>
time of the female's gestation, the size of the new∣born
whelps, and the quickness or slowness of
of their growth. Aelian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner, hist. quad. p. 575.</NOTE> limits the time of ges∣tation
to two months; but Philostratus and Ed∣ward
Wotton<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. de differ. anim. cap. 80.</NOTE> extend it to six. I am inclined
to be of the latter opinon; for the lion is an a∣nimal
of great magnitude; and we know, that,
in general, among large animals, the time of ges∣tation
is longer than among the smaller species.
The same thing takes place with regard to the
growth of the body. Both antients and moderns
agree, that new-born lions are very small, being
about the size of a weasel<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 80.</NOTE>, that is, six or seven
inches in length. They must, therefore, require
several years before they can grow eight or nine
feet long. The young lions are likewise said to
be two months old before they can walk. With∣out
giving implicit faith to these facts, we may,
with probability, presume, that the lion, from the
largeness of his body, must require three or four
years for acquiring his full growth, and that he
ought to live about seven times three or four
years, or nearly to the age of twenty-five. The
Sieur de St Martin, master of the bull-fights at Paris,
assures me, that he has kept lions sixteen or seven∣teen
years; and he imagines that they live not
above the age of twenty or twenty-two. He
has kept others twelve or fifteen years; and it is
<PB N="79" REF="101"/>
well known that their lives must be abridged, and
their conftitution weakened, by the want of ex∣ercise,
consinement, and chagrin.</P>
<P>Aristotle affirms, in two different parts of his
works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arist. de Generatione, lib. 3. cap. 2. et 10.</NOTE>, that the lioness produces five or six
whelps at the first litter, four or five at the se∣cond,
three or four at the third, and two or three
at the fourth; and that, after this last litter,
which is always the least numerous, she becomes
barren. This assertion merits no credit; for, in
all animals, the first and last litters are less nu∣merous
than the intermediate ones. This philoso∣pher
erred, as well as all the naturalists who came
after him, when he maintained that the lioness had
only two paps; for it is now certain that she has
four. He likewise affirms<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. 4. cap. 6.</NOTE>, that the lion, the
bear, and the fox, are brought forth in an un∣formed
state: But it is now past a doubt, that
these creatures are as well formed at birth as any
other animals, and that all their members are
distinctly unfolded. Lastly, he affirms, that the
lions copulate in a reversed manner<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. Anim. lib. 5. cap. 2. Linn. Syst. p. 60. Leo retro mingit et coit.</NOTE>; but, from
a bare inspection of the parts of the male, it is
evident, that the lion must copulate in the ordi∣nary
way of other quadrupeds. I have men∣tioned
these slight errors of Aristotle, because the
authority of this great man has deceived all the
<PB N="80" REF="102"/>
writers on natural history since his time. What
he remarks of the lion's neck being composed of
one rigid and inflexible bone, has also been con∣tradicted
by experience; for, in every quadruped,
without exception, and even in man, the neck
consists precisely of seven vertebrae. It is ano∣ther
general fact, that the necks of carnivorous
animals are shorter than those of the frugivo∣rous,
and particularly of the ruminating species.
But this difference in the length of the neck de∣pends
on the largeness of each vertebra, and not
on their number, which is always the same, from
the elephant to the mole. With regard to the
solidity of the lion's bones, which Aristotle af∣firms
to have neither marrow nor cavity; to
their hardness, which he compares to that of
flint; and to their property of striking fire with
steel; these blunders ought not to have been re∣peated
by Kolbe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 4.</NOTE>; nor should they have come
down to our time; since, even in the days of
Aristotle, they were ridiculed by Epicurus.</P>
<P>The lions are exceedingly ardent in their a∣mours.
When the female is in season, she is
sometimes followed by eight or ten males<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner, Hist. quad. p. 575.</NOTE>, who
incessantly roar around her, and engage in the
most furious combats, till one of them conquers
all the rest, and retires in peaceable possession of
his mate. The lioness brings forth in the spring<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>,
and produces but once in the year; which shows
<PB N="81" REF="103"/>
that she is occupied for some months in suckling
and taking care of her young; and, consequent∣ly,
that the time of their growing, during which
they need the assistance of the mother, is at least
several months.</P>
<P>In these animals, all the passions, even those
of the softest kind, are excessive. The maternal
affection of the lioness is extreme. Though na∣turally
weaker, and less courageous than the
lion, whenever she has young, she becomes
dreadfully ferocious. She then exposes herself
with more boldness than the lion; she knows no
danger; she attacks, indiscriminately, men and
every other animal; and, after slaying them,
carries them home to her whelps, whom she
soon accustoms to suck the blood and tear the
flesh. She commonly brings forth in places the
most sequestrate and inaccessible; and, when
afraid of being discovered, she conceals the
tracks of her feet, by returning several times on
her steps, or effaces them with her tail. When
her anxiety is great, she sometimes transports
her young to a different place; and, if the hun∣ters
attempt to force them from her, she becomes
perfectly furious, and defends them to the last
extremity.</P>
<P>The lion, it is alledged, has neither the senses
of smelling nor of seeing so acute as most ani∣mals
of prey. The light of the sun seems to
incommode him; he seldom goes abroad in the
middle of the day, but makes all his excursions
<PB N="82" REF="104"/>
during the night: When he sees the fires burn∣ing
around the flocks, he never approaches
them. It has also been remarked, that he per∣ceives
not the odour of other animals at a di∣stance;
that he hunts only by the eye, and not
by the scent, like the dog and the wolf, whose
sense of smelling is finer. Even the name of
<HI>Guide,</HI> or <HI>Lion's Provider,</HI> has been given to a
species of lynx, which is supposed to have a pier∣cing
eye and exquisite scent; and, it is said, that
this lynx always follows or precedes the lion, to
point out his prey. We are acquainted with
this animal, who, like the lion, inhabits Arabia,
Lybia, &amp;c. and who sometimes follows the lion
with a view to pick up what he leaves; for,
being smaller, and much weaker, he should ra∣ther
fly from the lion than serve him.</P>
<P>The lion, when pressed with hunger, boldly
attacks every animal that comes in his way.
But, as he is extremely formidable, and is an∣xiously
avoided by every beast of the forest, he
is often obliged to lie concealed in the ways
where animals commonly pass. He lies squat
on his belly among brush-wood, from which he
darts with such force, that he often seizes his
prey at the first bound. In the deserts and fo∣rests,
antelopes and monkeys are his common
food, though he only takes the latter when upon
the ground; for he climbs not trees like the tiger
or the Puma<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein de Quad. p. 82.</NOTE>. He devours as much at a time
<PB N="83" REF="105"/>
as will serve him two or three days. His teeth
are so strong, that he breaks bones with ease,
and swallows them along with the flesh. He is
said to support hunger very long. As his tem∣perament
is exceedingly hot, he is impatient of
thirst, and drinks as often as he finds water,
which he laps like a dog. The tongue of the
dog, when lapping, is bended upwards; but that
of the lion is bended downward, which occa∣sions
him to drink long, and to lose much water.
He requires about fifteen pounds of raw flesh
every day. He prefers the flesh of living ani∣mals,
especially of those whom he slays himself.
He does not willingly eat putrid carcasses, and
chooses rather to hunt for a fresh prey than to
use the remains of a former. Though he com∣monly
feeds upon fresh meet, his breath is very
rank, and the odour of his urine is insupportable.</P>
<P>The roaring of the lion is so strong, that,
when uttered during the night in the deserts, it
resembles, by the repetition of ecchos, the noise
of thunder<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyages de la Boulaye-le-Gouz, p. 320.</NOTE>. This roaring is the ordinary
voice of the lion; for, when enraged, he utters a
short, and suddenly repeated cry. But the
roaring is a prolonged cry, a kind of a deep∣toned
grumbling, mixed with a sharp vibrating
noise. He roars five or six times in the day,
and oftener before rain<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">These facts I learned from the Sieur Saint-Martin, mas∣ter of the bull-fights, who has kept several lions.</NOTE>. When enraged, his
<PB N="84" REF="106"/>
cry is still more terrible than his roaring. He
then beats his sides and the earth with his tail,
agitates his mane, moves the skin of his face and
his large eye-brows, shows his dreadful tusks,
and thrusts out his tongue, which is armed with
prickles so hard, that it alone is sufficient to tear
the skin and the flesh, without the assistance of
either teeth or claws. His strength lies more
in the head, jaws, and fore-legs, than in the pos∣terior
parts of his body. He sees in the night,
like the cats. His sleep is short, and he is easily
awaked. But it is a mistake to say that he sleeps
with his eyes open.</P>
<P>The ordinary pace of the lion is bold, grave,
and slow, though always oblique. His course
consists not of equal movements; but is perform∣ed
by leaps and bounds; and his motions are so
brisk, that he cannot instantly stop, but general∣ly
surpasses his aim. When he leaps on his prey,
he makes a spring of twelve or fifteen feet, falls
above the victim, seizes it with his fore-feet,
tears it in pieces with his claws, and then de∣vours
it with his teeth. While young and nimble,
he lives by hunting, and seldom quits the deserts
or the forests, where finds plenty of wild ani∣mals
for his subsistence. But, when he grows
old, heavy, and less fit for the exercise of hunt∣ing,
he approaches frequented places, and be∣comes
more dangerous to man and the domestic
animals. It has, indeed, been remarked, that,
<PB N="85" REF="107"/>
when he sees men and animals together, he at∣tacks
the latter, and never the former, unless any
man strikes him; for, in this case, he is wonder∣fully
alert in distinguishing the person who hurts
him; and he instantly quits his prey to take
vengeance on the offender. It is alledged, that
he prefers the flesh of the camel to that of all
other animals. He is likewise very fond of
young elephants. As they are unable to resist
him till their tusks are grown, he accomplishes
his purpose with ease, unless the mother comes
to their assistance. The elephant, the rhinoce∣ros,
the tiger, and the hippopotamus, are the on∣ly
animals which can resist the fury of the lion.</P>
<P>This animal, however formidable, is hunted
with large dogs, supported by men on horse∣back,
who dislodge him, and make him retire.
But both the dogs and the horses require to be
previously trained; for most animals tremble
and fly from the odour of the lion. His skin,
though of a close and firm texture, resists neither
a ball nor a javeline. He is seldom, however,
killed with a single blow. He is often taken, as
we take wolves, by making him fall into a deep
pit, covered with limber materials, and upon
which a live animal is tied. The lion becomes
gentle as soon as he is seized; and, if advantage
be taken of the first emotions of his surprise and
shame, he may be chained, muzzled, and con∣ducted
at pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="108"/>
The flesh of the lion has a strong a disa∣greeable
flavour; yet it is frequently eaten by
the Indians and Negroes. The skin, which was
formerly the robe of heroes, serves those people
for a mantle or a bed. They also preserve the
grease, which is of a penetrating nature, and even
of some use in medicine.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L'hist. Nat. des Animaux, par Mess. Arnaud de Nobleville et Salerne, tom. 5. part. 2. p. 112.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>OF TIGERS.</HEAD>
<P>TIGER being a generic name given to se∣veral
animals of different species, we shall
begin with distinguishing them from each other.
The leopards and panthers, which are so often
confounded, have both been called <HI>Tigers</HI> by most
travellers. The ounce, a small species of panther,
which is easily tamed, and used for hunting in
the East, has been mistaken for the panther, and
received the general denomination of <HI>Tiger.</HI> The
lynx, and the lion's provider, by the Turks called
<HI>Karackoulah,</HI> and by the Persians <HI>Siyahgush,</HI> have
sometimes also received the appellation of <HI>Pan∣ther</HI>
or of <HI>Ounce.</HI> All these animals are com∣mon
in Africa, and in the southern regions of
Asia. But the true tiger is a rare animal, little
known to the antients, and not well described by
the moderns. Aristotle makes no mention of
the tiger: Pliny only observes of him, that he is
an animal of astonishing fleetness,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Animal tremendae velocitatis; <HI>Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 8. c.</HI> 18.</NOTE>, and adds,
that he was much more rarely to be met with
than the panther, because Augustus first present∣ed
a tiger to the Romans at the dedication of the
theatre of Marcellus, while, in the days of Scau∣rus,
this Aedile presented 150 panthers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 8. c. 17.</NOTE>, and af∣terwards
Pompey exhibited 410, and Augustus
<PB N="88" REF="112"/>
420, at the public spectacles of Rome. But
Pliny gives not a single mark by which the tiger
is to be distinguished: Oppian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Oppian, lib. 1. de venatione, ubi ait: Orynges alios decorari toeniis oblongis tigrium instar, alios vero rotundis ut panthera.—Tigres (ait Solinus) bestias insignes maculis notae et pernicitas memorabiles riddiderunt, fulvo nitent, hoc ful∣vum nigricantibus segmentis inter-undatum,</NOTE> and Solinus,
who wrote after Pliny, appear to have been the
first who mention that the tiger is characterized
by long stripes, and the panther by round patches.
This is, indeed, one of the marks which distinguish
the true tiger not only from the panther, but
from several other animals that have been cal∣led
tigers. Strabo<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strab. lib. 15.</NOTE> quotes Megasthenus on the
subject of the true tiger, who tells us, that, in In∣dia,
there are tigers twice as large as the lion.
Thus the only notices we have from the antients,
concerning this remarkable animal, are, that he
is extremely ferocious and fleet; that his body is
marked with long stripes; and that he exceeds
the lion is magnitude. The moderns, as Ges∣ner,
and other naturalists, who mention the tiger,
have added nothing to the little that had been
observed by the antients.</P>
<P>All those skins which have short hair and
roundish and distinct spots, have been called tigers
skins; and travellers, deceived by this false de∣nomination,
have indiscriminately named every
ferocious animal, thus spotted, by the appellation
of <HI>tigers.</HI> The academy of sciences were like∣wise
<PB N="89" REF="113"/>
misled by this prejudice; and, to all the
spotted animals they dissected, though very dif∣ferent
from the genuine tiger, they have given
the same denomination.</P>
<P>The most general cause of the multiplication
of equivocal and vague terms in natural history,
has arisen, as shall be more fully demonstrated in
the following article, from the necessity of giving
names to the unknown productions of the New
World. Many animals, merely from some
slight resemblances to those of the Old Con∣tinent,
though very different, both in species
and dispositions, have had the same names im∣posed
on them. The error of calling every spot∣ted
animal a <HI>tiger,</HI> began in Europe, and was
transported to America, where it was doubly aug∣mented.
For spotted quadrupeds being disco∣vered
in this new country, they were instantly
called <HI>tigers,</HI> though they neither belonged to the
species of the true tiger, nor to any of those Asi∣atic
or African animals who had falsely received
that name. Hence, in place of one species of
tiger, their number has been increased to nine or
ten; and, consequently, the history of those dif∣ferent
animals has been greatly embarrassed, what
belongs to one species being often ascribed to an∣other.</P>
<P>To dispel the confusion arising from these false
denominations, especially among the animals which
have been commonly called tigers, I shall give a
comparative enumeration of quadrupeds, in which
<PB N="90" REF="114"/>
I shall distinguish, 1. Those which are peculiar to
the Old World, and existed not in America upon
its first discovery; 2. Those which are peculiar to
the New, and were unknown in the Old World;
3. Those which are common to both continents,
without being transported by men from the one
to the other. For this purpose, we must collect
into one view what lies scattered in the works of
the first historians of America.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ANIMALS PECULIAR TO THE OLD WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>As the largest animals are best known, and
liable to the fewest uncertainties, we shall, in this
enumeration, trace them nearly in the order of
their magnitude.</P>
<P>Elephants are peculiar to the Old World; the
largest are produced in Asia, and the smallest in
Africa. They are natives of the warmest re∣gions;
and, though they are capable of existing,
yet they cannot multiply, in temperate climates.
Even in their native country, they propagate not,
after being deprived of their liberty. Though
entirely confined to the warm regions of the Old
Continent, their numbers are considerable. In
America, there is not an animal that can be com∣pared
to the elephant, either for figure or mag∣nitude.</P>
<P>The same remark applies to the rhinoceros,
whose species is much less numerous than that
of the elephant. He is peculiar to the deserts of
<PB N="91" REF="115"/>
Africa, and to the forests of the southern regions
of Asia; and no American animal has the smallest
resemblance to him.</P>
<P>The hippopotamus inhabits the banks of the
large rivers of India and Africa. His species
is perhaps still less numerous than that of the
rhinoceros; and he is not to be found in Ame∣rica,
nor in the temperate climates of the Old
World.</P>
<P>The camel and dromedary, who are so com∣mon
in Asia, in Arabia, and in all the eastern
regions of the Old Continent, were equally un∣known
in America as the elephant, the rhinoceros,
and the hippopotamus. The appellation of <HI>ca∣mel</HI>
has been given to the Lama<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camelus glama, corpore laevi, topho pectorali; <HI>Linn. Syst. p.</HI> 91. Camelus pilis brevissimus vestitus; <HI>Brisson. Regn. anim. p.</HI> 56. Ovis Peruana; <HI>Marcg. Hist. Brasil. p.</HI> 243.</NOTE> and Pacos<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camelus Pacos, tophis nullis, corpore lanato; <HI>Linn. Syst. p.</HI> 91. Camelus pilis prolixis toto corpore vestitus; <HI>Brisson. Regn. anim. p.</HI> 57. Ovis Peruana pacos dicta; <HI>Marcg. Hist. Brasil. p.</HI> 244.</NOTE>
of Peru, though those animals are so different
from the camel, that, by some, they have been
called <HI>sheep,</HI> and by others <HI>camels</HI> of Peru, and
though the pacos has nothing in common
with our sheep, but the wool, and the lama re∣sembles
the camel only by the length of its neck.
The Spaniards formerly transported real camels
to Peru<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Hist. nat. des Indes par Jos. Acosta, p. 44.—208. l'Hist. des Incas tom. 2. p. 266.</NOTE>: But the climate of this New World
was not favourable to these animals; for, al∣though
<PB N="92" REF="116"/>
they produced, their numbers never be∣came
considerable.</P>
<P>The giraffe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Giraffa quam Arabes Zurnapa, Graeci et Latini Camelo∣pardalin nominant; <HI>Bellon. Obs. p.</HI> 118.</NOTE>, or camelopard, an animal re∣markable
for the height of its stature, and the
length of its neck and fore-legs, is not to be found
in America. It is a native of Africa, particular∣ly
Ethiopia, and has never spread beyond the
Tropics into the temperate regions of the Old
World.</P>
<P>We have seen, in the preceding article, that
the lion exists not in America, and that the puma
of Peru is an animal of a different species. We
shall likewise find, that the tiger and panther are
peculiar to the Antient Continent, and that the
animals of South America, who have received
these names, are different species. The true tiger
is a terrible animal, and perhaps more to be dread∣ed
than the lion himself. His ferocity is tre∣mendous;
and we may judge of his strength by
his size, which is commonly from four to five
feet high, by nine, ten, thirteen or fourteen feet
long, without comprehending the tail. His skin
is not variegated with round spots, but with black
bands on a yellow ground, which extend trans∣versely
over the whole body, and form rings on
his tail from one end to the other. These cha∣racters
are sufficient to distinguish the tiger from
all the carnivorous animals of the New World,
the largest of which scarcely exceed the size of
our mastisss or grey-hounds. The leopard and
<PB N="93" REF="117"/>
panther of Africa and Asia, are not nearly so
large as the tiger, and yet they are much larger
than the rapacious animals of South America.
Pliny, whose testimony cannot be questioned, as
panthers were in his time exposed in great num∣bers
at the public shews of Rome, points out the
essential characters of this animal, by telling us,
that his hair is whitish, and every where varie∣gated
with black spots, resembling eyes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pantheris in candido breves macularum oculi varias … et pardos, qui mares sunt appellant in eo omni genere creber∣rimo in Africa Syriaque, quidam ab iis Pantheras candore solo discernunt, nec adhuc aliam differentiam inveni; <HI>Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 17.</NOTE>: He
adds, that the female differs from the male in no∣thing
but the superior whiteness of her hair.
The American animals who have been called
<HI>tigers,</HI> have a greater similarity to the panther:
From the latter, however, they differ so much,
that it is easy to perceive they belong not to the
same species.</P>
<P>The first is the <HI>jaguar, jaguara,</HI> or <HI>janowara,</HI>
and is a native of Guiana, Brasil, and other re∣gions
of South America. Ray, with some plau∣sibility,
named this animal the <HI>pard</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pardus an Lynx Brasiliensis, jaguara dicta; <HI>Marcgrav. Ray, Synops. quad. p.</HI> 166.</NOTE>, or <HI>lynx</HI> of
Brasil. The Portuguese called him <HI>once</HI> or <HI>ança,</HI>
because they had given that name improperly,
first to the lynx, and afterwards to the small pan∣ther
of India. The French, without reason, have
called it a <HI>tiger</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gros tigre da la Guiane; <HI>Desmarchais, tom. 3. p.</HI> 299. Le Tigre d'Amerique; <HI>Brisson. Regn. anim. p.</HI> 270.</NOTE>; for it has no affinity to that
<PB N="94" REF="118"/>
animal. It differs from the panther also in the
size of its body, the figure and situation of its
spots, the colour and length of its hair, which
is crisped when young, and is always rougher
than that of the panther. Neither does it re∣semble
this animal in its dispositions and manners;
it is more savage, and cannot be tamed. These
differences, however, hinder not the jaguar of
Brasil from resembling the panther, more than
any other animal of the Old World. The second
we shall call <HI>couguar,</HI> by contracting the Brasilian
name <HI>cuguacu-ara</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuguacu-ara; <HI>Pison. Hist. Nat. Ind. p.</HI> 104. Le Tigre rouge; <HI>Barrere. hist. Fr. equin. p.</HI> 165; <HI>Brisson, Regn. anim. p.</HI> 272.</NOTE>, pronounced by the natives
<HI>cougouacou-ara.</HI> The French have, with still
more impropriety, called this animal the <HI>red tiger.</HI>
It resembles the true tiger in nothing, and differs
very much from the panther, having its hair of a
red colour, without spots. The form of the
head is likewise different, and the muzzle is long∣er
than that of the tiger or panther. A third
species, which has also obtained the name of <HI>ti∣ger,</HI>
and is equally removed from that spe∣cies
with the preceding animals, is the jagua∣rete<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jaguarete; <HI>Pison. Hist. Nat. Ind.</HI> p. 103. Once, a species of tiger; <HI>Desmarchais, tom. 3. p.</HI> 300. The black tiger; <HI>Brisson. Regn. anim. p.</HI> 271.</NOTE>.
This animal is nearly of the same size
with the jaguar, and resembles him in na∣tural
dispositions; but differs from him in some
external characters. He has been called the
<HI>black tiger,</HI> because his hair is blackish, intersper∣sed
<PB N="95" REF="119"/>
with spots still blacker than those of the ja∣guar.
Beside these three species, and perhaps a
fourth, commonly called tigers, there is another
American animal that has a greater resemblance
to the tiger, namely the mountain cat, related
both to the cat and panther, and which is more
properly marked by this compound appellation,
than by its Mexican name, <HI>tlacoosclotl</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hernandez Hist. Mex. p. 512. Chat-pard; <HI>Hist. l'Acad. des sciences, tom. 3. part. 1. p.</HI> 109; <HI>Brisson, Regn. anim, p.</HI> 273.</NOTE>. It is
smaller than the jaguar, jaguarete, or couguar, but
larger than the wild cat, which it resembles in
figure, though its tail is much shorter, and its
hair variegated with black spots, which are ob∣long
on the back, and circular on the belly. The
jaguar, jaguarete, couguar, and mountain cat, are
therefore American animals, which have improper∣ly
been named <HI>tigers.</HI> We have seen the couguar
and mountain cat alive, and know them to be
very different in species; but they are still more
different from that of the tiger and panther.
With regard to the puma and jaguar, it is evi∣dent,
from the descriptions of those who have seen
these animals, that the puma is not a lion, nor the
jaguar a tiger. Thus we may pronounce with
confidence, that the lion, the tiger, and even the
panther, are no more to be found in America,
than the elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopo∣tamus,
the giraffe, and the camel. All these spe∣cies
require a warm climate for the purposes of
propagation; and, having never inhabited nor∣thern
<PB N="96" REF="120"/>
regions, could not convey themselves in∣to
America. This general fact is too important
not to be supported by every proof that can be
produced: We shall, therefore, continue our com∣parison
of the animals of the Old World with
those of the New.</P>
<P>Every body knows that horses, when first
transported to America, struck the natives not
only with surprise, but with terror; and that
these animals have thriven and multiplied as fast
in America as in Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Antilles, par Tertre, tom. 2. p. 289.</NOTE>. The same remark
applies to the ass, from which mules have been
produced, that are more useful for every kind of
carriage than the Lama, particularly in the moun∣tainous
parts of Chili and Peru.</P>
<P>The zebra<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zebra; <HI>Ray, Synops. quad. p. 69. Edwards, p. 27. Brisson. Regn. anim. p.</HI> 101. Asne Sauvage; <HI>Kolbe, tom. 3. p.</HI> 22.</NOTE> is an animal peculiar to the Old
World, and which, perhaps, has never been seen
in the New. It seems to be confined to a par∣ticular
climate, and is found no where but in
that part of Africa which extends from the Equa∣tor
to the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>Horned cattle were found neither in the islands
nor on the continent of South America. Soon
after the discovery of these countries, bulls and
cows were transported from Europe by the Spa∣niards.
In 1550, they, for the first time labour∣ed
the ground with oxen in the valley of Cusco<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 266.</NOTE>.
These animals multiplied prodigiously on the
<PB N="97" REF="121"/>
Continent, as well as in the islands of St Domin∣go,
Cuba, &amp;c.; and even became wild in several
places. The species of horned cattle, which we
call Bison, found in Mexico, Louisiana<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de. Nouveau Monde, par Jean Laet, liv. 10. ch. 4.</NOTE>, &amp;c. be∣longs
not to the European race. The bison ex∣isted
in America before our horned cattle were
transported thither. He is so different from the
latter, that he may be regarded as constituting a
separate species. He has a fleshy protuberance
between his shoulders; his hair is softer than
wool, longer on the fore-part of his body than
the hind, and curled upon the neck and along the
spine of the back. It is of a brown colour, ob∣scurely
marked with some whitish spots. The
bison has, besides, short legs, which, like the head
and neck, are covered with long hair. The male
has a long tail, terminating in a bush of hair, like
that of the lion. Though these distinctions have
appeared to me, as well as to all other naturalists,
sufficient to constitute the bison and our horned
cattle of different species, yet I will not presume
to determine this point; because the essential
characteristic of animals being of the same species,
is the faculty of a regular and uninterrupted pro∣pagation
of their kinds; and this fact, with re∣gard
to the bison and our horned cattle, has ne∣ver
hitherto been subjected to the test of experi∣ment.
Mons. de la Nux, counsellor of the royal
council of the island of Bourbon, has favoured
me with a letter, dated 9th October 1759, in
which he informs me, that the bison propagates
<PB N="98" REF="122"/>
with the common horned cattle; and, it were to
be wished, that persons living in these countries
would imitate the example of this gentleman, in
making experiments upon animals. It would
be easy for the inhabitants of Louisiana to try to
make the American bison copulate with the Eu∣ropean
cow, or the European bull with the fe∣male
bison. Such commixtures might, perhaps, be
fruitful; and, in that case, we would be assured
that the European horned cattle, the bunch∣backed
species of the island of Bourbon, the East-India
bull, and American bison, constitute but
one species. From the experiments of Mons. de
la Nux, it is apparent, that the bunch is not an
essential character, because, after some genera∣tions,
it entirely vanishes. Besides, I have disco∣vered
that this bunch or protuberance, which ap∣pears
on the camel as well as the bison, is a com∣mon,
but not a permanent character, and ought
to be regarded as an accidental variety, depend∣ing,
perhaps, on the constitution of the body;
for I have seen a meager sickly camel which had
no vestige of a bunch. The other character of
the American bison namely, long soft hair, ap∣pears
to be only a difference arising from the in∣fluence
of climate, in the same manner as we ob∣serve
its effect on our goats, cats, and rabbits,
when compared to those of Angora, which,
though very different in regard of their hair, are
nevertheless of the same species. Hence it is
probable, (especially if the American bison pro∣duces
with European cows) that our horned cat∣tle
<PB N="99" REF="123"/>
must formerly have passed from the northern
regions contiguous to those of North America,
and that, having afterwards spread into the tem∣perate
regions of the New World, they assumed
with time the impressions of the climate, and
became real bisons. But, till this essential cha∣racter
of generation be fully established, we must
still conclude, that our cow and bull is a species
peculiar to the Antient Continent, and existed
not in America till they were transported thither.</P>
<P>America has still less pretensions to the sheep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 322.</NOTE>.
These animals were transported from Europe, and
have succeeded both in the warm and temperate
climates. But, though equally prolific, they are
commonly more meager<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pison. Marcgrav.</NOTE>, and their flesh less
succulent and tender than that of the European
sheep. The climate of Brasil seems to be most
favourable to them; for that is the only region
of the New World where they become excessive∣ly
fat<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Nouv. Monde, par Jaen Laet, liv. 15. chap. 15.</NOTE>. Both European and African sheep have
been transported to Jamaica<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ovis Guineensis seu Angolensis; <HI>Marcgrav. lib. 6. cap. 10. Ray, Synops. quad. p. 75. Sloane's hist. of Jamaica.</HI></NOTE>, and have equally
succeeded. These two species belong entirely
to the Old Continent.</P>
<P>Neither is the goat a native of America. The
numerous flocks now found there have all pro∣ceeded
from those which were transported. At
Brasil, the goat has not multiplied so fast as the
sheep<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Nouv. Monde, lib. 15. chap. 15.</NOTE>. When first carried to Peru by the Spa∣niards,
<PB N="100" REF="124"/>
goats were so rare, that they were sold
for 110 ducats a-piece<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 322.</NOTE>; but they afterwards be∣came
so numerous, that they were sold for little
more than the value of the skin. In that coun∣try,
they produce three, four, and sometimes five
kids at a time, while, in Europe, they produce
only one or two. The large and small American
islands are equally replenished with goats as the
Continent. They have even been carried by the
Spaniards to the islands of the South Sea; and in
the island of Juan Fernandez<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anson's voyage.</NOTE>, particularly, they
have been extremely fertile. But, as they fur∣nished
provisions to the pirates who afterwards
infested these seas, the Spaniards resolved to ex∣tirpate
them from the island; and, for this purpose,
left a number of dogs, which having likewise
multiplied in their turn, destroyed the goats in
every accessible part of the island, and became
so ferocious, that they actually attacked men.</P>
<P>The wild boar, the domestic hog, and that of
China, which constitute but one species, and
multiply so plentifully in Europe and Asia, are
not natives of America. The Mexican hog,
which has an aperture in its<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tajacu; <HI>Pison. Ind. p.</HI> 98.—Tajacu, aper Mexicanus mos∣chiferus; <HI>Ray, Synops. quad. p.</HI> 97.—Le Sanglier du Mexique; <HI>Brisson, Regn. anim. p.</HI> 111.</NOTE> back, is the ani∣mal
in America that approaches nearest to the
common species. I have seen it alive, and have
attempted, in vain, to make it produce with the
<PB N="101" REF="125"/>
European sow. Their characters, besides, are so
different, that there is good reason to pronounce
them of a different species. The hogs transport∣ed
from Europe to America have succeeded bet∣ter,
and multiplied faster, than the sheep or goat.
The first swine, says Garcilasso<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 266.</NOTE>, sold at Peru
still dearer than the goats. The flesh of the ox
and sheep, according to Piso<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pison. hist. nat. Brasil.</NOTE>, is not so good at
Brasil as in Europe; but the hogs are better, and
multiply faster; and Laet remarks<NOTE N="Dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. de nouveau monde, par Jean Laet, chap. 4. p. 5.</NOTE>, that those
of St Domingo have also improved so as to ex∣ceed
those of Europe. In general, it is allowed,
that, of all domestic animals transported from
Europe to America, the hog has most univer∣sally
succeeded. In Canada, as well as in Bra∣sil,
which includes the coldest and warmest
climates of the New World, they produce and
multiply, and their flesh is equally good. The
goat, on the contrary, has multiplied in the warm
or temperate countries only, and cannot support
the species in Canada: It is for this reason, that,
though numbers of them are brought from Eu∣rope,
they still continue to be rare in that coun∣try.
The ass, which multiplies in Brasil, Peru,
&amp;c. is unable to multiply in Canada, where nei∣ther
mules nor asses, though many couples of the
latter have been from time to time transported
thither, are to be seen. The cold seems to de∣prive
them of that vigour of constitution, that
<PB N="102" REF="126"/>
natural ardour, by which, in warm-climates, they
are so much distinguished from other animals.
Horses have multiplied nearly in an equal man∣ner
over all the regions of America. They ap∣pear
to have only diminished in size<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Hans Sloane's hist. of Jamaica.</NOTE>. But that
is common to them with all the other animals
brought from Europe to America; for, in Ca∣nada,
the ox, the goat, the sheep, the hog, the
dog, are smaller than in France; and, what is still
more singular, all the native American animals
are, in general, much smaller than those of the
Old Continent. In this New World, Nature seems
to have operated upon a smaller scale: Man a∣lone
has been copied after the same model. But,
before mentioning the facts which support this
observation, we must finish our enumeration.</P>
<P>The hog, as we have seen, is not a native of
America, but was transported thither; and he has
not only multiplied there in a domestic state,
but has become wild in many places, where he
multiplies in the woods, like our wild boars<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. nat. des Indes, par Joseph Acosta, p. 44.</NOTE>,
without the aid of man. A species of hogs, dif∣ferent
from those of Europe, have likewise been
transported from Guiney to Brasil<NOTE N="Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pison. hist. nat. Brasil.</NOTE>, where they
have increased. This Guiney hog, which is
smaller than the European kind, has long point∣ed
ears, and a tail that almost trails on the ground.
It is not covered with bristles, but with short hair,
<PB N="103" REF="127"/>
and appears to be a distinct species from that
of Europe; for we have never learned from
Brasil, where the ardour of the climate favours
every kind of propagation, that the two species
have intermixed, or even produced mules.</P>
<P>The dog, whose races are so various, and so uni∣versally
diffused, appear not in America but by a
kind of specimens, which it is difficult to compare
with the whole species. At St Domingo, there
were small animals called <HI>gosques,</HI> which resem∣bled
little dogs. But Garcilasso affirms, that
they had no dogs similar to those of Europe. He
adds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 322.</NOTE>, that the European dogs, which had been
transported to Cuba and St Domingo, and be∣came
wild, had diminished the number of cattle,
which had also become wild; and that these dogs
hunt in packs of ten or twelve, and are equally
destructive as the wolves. There are no genuine
dogs, says Joseph Acosta<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. nat. des Indes, p. 46. l'Hist. du Nouveau Monde, par Jean Laet, lib. 10. chap. 5.</NOTE>, in the west Indies,
but only animals resembling small dogs, called <HI>alcos</HI>
in Peru, and which attached themselves to their
masters, and had nearly the same dispositions
with the dog. If Father Charlevoix<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. de l'isle Saint Domingue, par le Pere Charlevoix, tom. 1. p. 35.</NOTE> merits
credit, who quotes no authority, “the <HI>goschis</HI>
of St Domingo were small dumb dogs, which
served for the amusement of the ladies<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Were there any ladies in St Domingo when it was dis∣covered?</NOTE>. They
<PB N="104" REF="128"/>
were also used for hunting other animals by
the scent. They made excellent eating<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The flesh of the dog is by no means good for eating.</NOTE>, and
were a great supply to the Spaniards when the
first famines happened; so that, if great numbers
had not afterwards been brought from the con∣tinent,
the species would have been exhausted.
There were several kinds of them; the hair of
some was smooth and shining; others had their
bodies covered with very soft wool; and the
greatest number had only a kind of tender,
thin down. The varieties in their colour sur∣passed
even those of our dogs.”</P>
<P>If ever this species of <HI>goschis</HI> existed, with the
qualities ascribed to it by Father Charlevoix,
why has it been passed over in silence by other
authors? And why do not these animals, which,
according to him, were not only spread over
the island of St Domingo, but several places of
the Continent, no longer subsist? Or, if they do
subsist, why have they lost all their beautiful
peculiarities? It is probable, that the <HI>goschis</HI> of
Charlevoix, whose name he never met with but
in the writings of Father Pers, is the <HI>gosques</HI> of
Garcilasso. Perhaps, likewise, the <HI>gosques</HI> of St
Domingo, and the alco of Peru, are the same ani∣mal;
and it seems to be certain, that this animal
is more allied to the European dog, than any o∣ther
American quadruped. Some authors have
regarded it as the genuine dog. Jean Laet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. du Nouveau Monde, par Jean Laet, lib. 15. chap. 15.</NOTE> says,
<PB N="105" REF="129"/>
in express terms, that, upon the discovery of the
West Indies, they employed for hunting a kind
of small dogs, which were absolutely mute. It
was remarked, in the history of the dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. 4. art. <HI>Dog.</HI></NOTE>, that,
in warm climates, he loses the faculty of bark∣ing.
But this loss is supplied by a sort of howl∣ing;
and they are never, like these American
animals, perfectly mute. Dogs transported from
Europe have thriven almost equally well in the
hottest and coldest climates of America, and they
are more esteemed by the savages than any o∣ther
animal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. du Nouveau Monde, par Jean Laet, liv. 15. chap. 15. p. 513.</NOTE>. In warm countries, they have lost
their voice; in cold regions, their size is dimi∣nished;
and, almost every where, their ears have
become erect. Hence they have degenerated,
or rather mounted up to their primitive race,
which is that of the shepherd's dog, which has
erect ears, and barks less than any other kind.
Dogs may, therefore, be regarded as belonging
solely to the Old Continent, where their nature
and talents are unfolded only in the temparte
regions, and where they seem to have been va∣riegated
and brought to perfection by the care
of man; for, in all uncivilized and very hot, or
very cold countries, they are equally small, ugly,
and almost mute.</P>
<P>The Hyaena<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hyaena</HI> Aristotelis; <HI>Hist. anim.—Dabuch</HI> Arabum; <HI>Char∣leton Exer. p.</HI> 15.</NOTE>, which is of the size of the
wolf, was known to the antients. It is remark∣able
<PB N="106" REF="130"/>
for an orifice and glands, situated, as in the
badger, between the anus and tail, from which
proceeds a strong fetid odour. He is likewise
remarkable for his strong mane, which runs a∣long
the neck and shoulders, for an enormous
voracity, which incites him to dig up bodies from
the graves, and devour the most putrid flesh, &amp;c.
This horrible creature is found only in Arabia,
and other southern provinces of Asia. It ex∣ists
not either in Europe or in the New World.</P>
<P>The Jackall, which, of all animals, makes the
nearest approach to the dog, though he differs
in essential characters, is very common in Ar∣menia
and Turkey, and is likewise found in se∣veral
other provinces of Asia and Africa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the art. <HI>Jackal.</HI></NOTE>: But
he is an absolute stranger in America. He is
remarkable for the colour of his hair, which is
a brilliant yellow: He is about the size of a fox;
and, though the species is very numerous it has
never reached Europe, nor even the north of
Asia.</P>
<P>The Genet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the art. <HI>Genet.</HI></NOTE>, which is a native of Spain, would
never have passed undiscovered, if it had existed
in the New World. But, as no American histo∣rians
or travellers make any mention of him,
he must be considered as peculiar to the Old
Continent. He inhabits the southern parts of
Europe, and those of Asia under the same la∣titude.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="131"/>
Though the civet has been said to be found
in New Spain; yet it seems not to be the civet
of Africa and the Indies, from which we derive
the musk, and which is mixed and prepared
with that of the animal called <HI>hiam</HI> in China;
for we consider the true civet to be an animal
peculiar to the southern regions of the Old Con∣tinent,
which has never reached the northern
provinces, and could not pass over to the New.</P>
<P>Cats as well as dogs were entire strangers to
America; and, though I have quoted a passage,
from which it appears that a person in the train
of Christopher Columbus killed a wild cat in
those new regions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. 4. art. <HI>Cat.</HI></NOTE>; yet I am persuaded that
these animals had then no existence there. I
was not, at that time, equally skilled in the ma∣ny
abuses made of names; and I acknowledge,
that I am not yet so well acquainted with ani∣mals,
as to distinguish them clearly in the false
or misapplied appellations given them by tra∣vellers.
Neither is this surprising, since our no∣menclators,
whose researches have been entirely
directed to this point of view, instead of throw∣ing
light upon the subject, have increased the
confusion, by other names and phrases adapted
to their arbitrary arrangements, which are al∣ways
more deceitful than actual inspection. The
natural propensity of comparing objects, which
we see for the first time, to those already known,
<PB N="108" REF="132"/>
joined to the almost insuperable difficulty of
pronouncing American names, are the two causes
of this misapplication of terms, which has been
productive of so many errors. It is easier, for
example, to call a new animal <HI>a wild boar</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le voyage de Desmarchais, tom. 3. p. 112.; l'Essai sur l'hist. nat. de la France equinoctiale, par Barrere; l'hist. de Mexique par Hernandes, p. 637.; l'hist. de la Nouvelle E∣spagne, par Fernandes, p. 8.</NOTE>, or
<HI>a black hog,</HI> than to pronounce his American
name, <HI>quauh-coyamelt;</HI> to call another an <HI>A∣merican
fox</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Desmarchias, tom. 3. p. 307.</NOTE>, than to preserve his Brasilian name
<HI>tamandua-guaca;</HI> to call those animals <HI>Peruvian
sheep</HI> or <HI>camels,</HI> which, in the language of the
natives, are denominated <HI>pelou jehialt-oquitli</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hernandes, hist. du Mexique, p. 660.</NOTE>.
In the same manner, the <HI>cabiai, cabionara,</HI> or <HI>ca∣pybara,</HI>
is called the <HI>water-hog</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Desmarchais, tom. 3. p. 314.</NOTE>, though it be
an animal very different from the hog; and the
<HI>carigueibeju</HI> is called <HI>an otter.</HI> The same con∣fusion
has been introduced into almost all the a∣nimals
of the New World, whose names were so
strange and barbarous to the Europeans, that they
endeavoured to bestow others upon them derived
from resemblances, sometimes happily imagined,
with the animals of the Old Continent, but of∣ten
borrowed from relations too remote to justify
such denominations. Five or six species of small
animals were regarded as hares, for no other
<PB N="109" REF="133"/>
reason, but because, like the latter, their flesh
was very good. An animal without horns, was
called <HI>a cow,</HI> or <HI>an elk,</HI> which the Americans
denominated <HI>tapiierete</HI> at Brasil, <HI>manipouris</HI> at
Guiana, and it was called <HI>anta</HI> by the Portu∣guese,
though it had no other relation to the cow
or elk than a slight resemblance in the form of
the body. Some others compared the <HI>pak</HI> or
<HI>paca</HI> to the rabbit, and others to a hog of two
months old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. du Nouveau Monde, par Jean Laet, p. 484.</NOTE>: Some considered the <HI>Opossum</HI> as a
rat, and called it <HI>the wood-rat;</HI> and others took
it for a small <HI>fox</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Klein de quad. p. 59. Barrere, hist. de la France equi∣noxiale, p. 166.</NOTE>. But it is unnecessary here
to expose, at greater length, the false denomina∣tions
bestowed by travellers, historians, and no∣menclators,
upon the American animals; because
I shall endeavour, in a subsequent part of this
discourse, to point them out and correct them.</P>
<P>We have seen, that all our domestic animals,
and the largest species of the wild animals of A∣frica
and Asia, had no original existence in the
New World. Several species likewise, of less con∣sideration,
belong not to America, which we
shall enumerate as succinctly as possible.</P>
<P>The antelopes, whose species are numerous,
and of which some inhabit Arabia, others A∣frica,
and others the East Indies, require a warm
climate for subsisting and multiplying. They
<PB N="110" REF="134"/>
never stretched into the northern parts of Eu∣rope,
so as to enable them to pass over to Ame∣rica.
Hence these African and Asiatic species
were not found in the New World. The Bar∣bary
antelope seems indeed to have been transport∣ed
thither, and Hernandes calls it <HI>algazel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hernandes, hist. du Mexique, p. 512.</NOTE> <HI>ex A∣phrica.</HI>
The animal of New Spain, called by
the same author <HI>temamaçame,</HI> by Seba <HI>cervus,</HI>
by Klein <HI>tragulus,</HI> and by Brisson, <HI>the antelope
of New Spain,</HI> appears to be a different species
from all the antelopes of the Old Continent.</P>
<P>It is natural to imagine, that the chamois goat,
which delights in the Alpine snows, would not
avoid the frozen regions of the north, and might,
therefore, have passed over to America; yet it
is not to be found there. This animal seems
not to affect a peculiar climate, but a particular
situation. He is fond of the summits of the
Alps, Pyrennees, &amp;c.; and, instead of spread∣ing
farther, has never descended to the plains
at the foot of those mountains. This is not the
only animal which dwells perpetually in the
same climate and situation. The marmot, the
wild goat, the bear, and the lynx, are also moun∣tain
animals, and rarely appear in the plains.</P>
<P>The buffalo, which is a native of warm cli∣mates,
and has been rendered domestic in Italy,
resembles the American bison less than the ox,
and is not found in the New Continent.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="135"/>
The wild goat inhabits the tops of the highest
mountains of Europe and Asia; but was never
seen on the Cordeliers.</P>
<P>The musk animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hiam,</HI> animal musci; <HI>Boym. Flor. Sinen.</HI>—Animal moschi∣serum; <HI>Ray, Synops. quad.</HI> p. 127.</NOTE>, which is nearly of the size
of a fallow deer, inhabits only particular provin∣ces
of China, and of the eastern parts of Tartary.
The royal antelope, known by the name of the
<HI>small stag of Guiney</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chevrotain;</HI> Brisson. Regn. animal. p. 95.</NOTE>, appears to be confined
to certain provinces of Africa, the East Indies,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>The rabbit, which came originally from Spain,
and is now diffused over all the temperate cli∣mates
of Europe, existed not in America; for
the animals called by that name belong to a dif∣ferent
species; and all the genuine rabbits in A∣merica
were transported thither from Europe<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ferrets, which were brought from Africa
into Europe, where they cannot subsist without
the care of man, were not found in America.
Even our rats and mice were unknown in that
continent. But they were transported in our
ships<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>, and are now prodigiously numerous in
all the cultivated countries of the New World.</P>
<P>The following is a pretty exact list of the a∣nimals
peculiar to the Old Continent, and which
had no existence in America previous to its in∣tercourse
with Europe: The elephant, the rhi∣noceros,
the hippopotamus, the camelopard, the
<PB N="112" REF="136"/>
camel, the dromedary, the lion, the tiger, the
panther, the horse, the ass, the zebra, the ox, the
buffalo, the sheep, the goat, the hog, the dog,
the hyaena, the jackall, the genet, the civet, the
cat, the antelope, the chamois goat, the wild
goat, the small Guiney stag, the rabbit, the fer∣ret,
the rat, the mouse, the fat squirrel, the gar∣den
squirrel, the marmot, the ichneumon, the
badger, the sable, the stoat or ermine, the jer∣boa,
the maki, and several species of monkeys,
&amp;c. All these animals are peculiar to the Old
Continent, as shall be shown, when we give the
history of each.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>OF ANIMALS PECULIAR TO THE NEW
WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>The animals of the New World were equally
unknown to the Europeans, as ours were to the
natives of America. In the New Continent, the
only half-civilized people were the Peruvians and
Mexicans. The latter had no domestic animals;
but the former had reduced to slavery the lama,
the pacos, and the alco, a small creature re∣sembling
a little dog. The pacos and the lama,
to which Fernandes gives the name of <HI>peruich∣catl</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Peruich-catl; Fernandes, Hist. Nov. Hisp. p.</HI> 11. Camelus Peruanus <HI>glama</HI> dictus; <HI>Ray, Synops. quad.</HI> p. 145. Camelus, seu camelo-congerer Peruvianum, lanigerum, <HI>pacos</HI> dictum; <HI>Id. ibid.</HI> p. 147.</NOTE>, or <HI>Peruvian cattle,</HI> like the chamois goat,
<PB N="113" REF="137"/>
frequent only the highest mountains, as those of
Peru, Chili, and New Spain. Though they had
become domestic in Peru, and, of course, had
been spread over the adjacent countries; yet, in∣stead
of multiplying in the place of their nati∣vity,
their number has diminished since the Eu∣ropean
cattle, which have succeeded wonderfully
in all the southern regions of America, were
transported thither.</P>
<P>It is singular, that, in a world almost totally
occupied by savages, whose manners approached
to those of the brute creation, there should have
been no society or correspondence between these
savage men and the animals which surrounded
them; for no domestic animals appear, without
some degree of civilization. Does it not fol∣low,
that man, in the savage state, is only a
species of animal, incapable of governing others,
and, possessing only his individual faculties, em∣ploys
them for procuring subsistence, and pro∣viding
for his safety, by attacking the weak, and
avoiding the strong animals, without any desire
of reducing them to subordination? In every
nation, though only half-civilized, we meet with
domestic animals. In France, the horse, the ass,
the ox, the sheep, the goat, the hog, the dog,
and the cat; in Italy, the buffalo; in Lapland,
the rain-deer; in Peru, the lama, the pacos, and
the alco; in the eastern countries, the drome∣dary,
the camel, other species of the ox, the
sheep, and the goat; in the southern regions, the
<PB N="114" REF="138"/>
elephant; all these have been reduced to servi∣tude,
or rather admitted into society; while the
savage, who hardly wishes for the society of his
female, either fears or disdains that of other ani∣mals.
It is true, none of the species we have
rendered domestic, existed in America. But, if
the savages with whom it was peopled had an∣tiently
united, and diffused the mutual know∣ledge
and resources of society, they would have
subjugated almost all the animals of that coun∣try,
most of them being of gentle, tractable, and
timid dispositions, very few ferocious, and none
formidable. Hence these animals have avoided
the slavery of a domestic state neither by the
fierceness of their nature, not the indocility of
their tempers. Their liberty has resulted solely
from the weakness of man, whose powers are
extremely circumscribed without the aid of so∣ciety,
upon which even the multiplication of his
species depends. The immense territories of the
New World contained not, upon its first disco∣very,
a greater number of inhabitants than what
are to be found in one half of Europe. This
scarcity of the human species allowed the other
animals to multiply prodigiously. They had
fewer enemies and more space: Every circum∣stance
was favourable to their increase; and each
species, accordingly, consisted of a vast number
of individuals. But the number of the species,
when compared with those of the Old Conti∣nent,
was not above one fourth, or one third.
<PB N="115" REF="139"/>
If we reckon that 200 species of quadrupeds ex∣ist
in the whole known quarters of the globe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus, in his last edition, enumerates only 179, and Brisson 260: But more than 60 of these should be retrench∣ed, being only varieties, and not distinct species.</NOTE>,
we shall find above 130 of them in the Old Con∣tinent,
and less than 70 in the New; and, if
we subtract the species common to both Conti∣nents,
or those which, by their constitution, were
able to endure the rigours of the North, and pas∣sed
by land from the one Continent to the other,
the New World cannot claim above 40 native
species. In America, therefore, animated Na∣ture
is weaker, less active, and more circumscri∣bed
in the variety of her productions; for we
perceive, from the enumeration of the American
animals, that the number of species is not only
fewer, but that, in general, all the animals are
much smaller than those of the Old Continent.
No American animal can be compared with the
elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the
dromedary, the camelopard, the buffalo, the lion,
the tiger, &amp;c. The tapir or <HI>tapiierete</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tapiierete</HI> Brasiliensibus; <HI>Pison. Hist. Nat. p. 101. Marc∣gravii Hist. Brasil. p.</HI> 229.

is the largest quadruped of South America.
This animal, the elephant of the New World,
exceeds not the size of a calf of six months old,
or of a very small mule; for he has been com∣pared
to both of these animals, though he has
<PB N="116" REF="140"/>
no resemblance to them, having neither a whole
nor a cloven hoof, but feet irregularly digitated,
namely, four toes on the fore-feet, and three on
the hind-feet. His body is shaped nearly like
that of the hog. His head, however, is propor∣tionally
much larger: He has no tusks or canine
teeth; and the upper lip is very long and move∣able
at pleasure. The lama is not so large as
the tapir, and he only appears to be large by the
length of his neck and legs. The pacos is still
a much smaller animal.</P>
<P>The cabiai<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capybara Brasiliensibus; <HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gravii Hist. Brasil. p.</HI> 230.</NOTE>, which, next to the tapir, is the
largest animal of south America, exceeds not the
size of an ordinary hog. He differs as much as
any of the former from all the animals of the
Old Continent; for, though he has been called
the <HI>marsh</HI> or <HI>river hog</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sus maximus palustris;</HI> Barrere, Hist. Fr. equin. p. 160. <HI>Cochon d'eau;</HI> Voyages de Desmarchais, tom. 3. p. 314.</NOTE>, he differs from that
animal by conspicuous and essential characters.
He is digitated, having, like the tapir, four toes
on the fore-feet and three on the hind-feet. His
eyes are large, his muzzle gross and obtuse, his
ears small, his hair short, and he has no tail.</P>
<P>The tajacou<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tajacu;</HI> Pison. Hist. Nat. p. 98. <HI>Tajacu, Caaigoara Brasiliensibus;</HI> Marcgr. Hist Brasil p. 229. <HI>Coyametl;</HI> Fer∣nandes, Hist. Nov. Hisp. p. 8.</NOTE> is smaller than the cabiai, and
has a greater resemblance to the hog, from which
he differs much in the structure of his internal
parts, as in the form of the stomach and lungs,
<PB N="117" REF="141"/>
&amp;c. He has also an open gland on the lower
part of his back, which discharges a fetid liquor.
He is, therefore, a different species from that of

the tapir, are found in any part of the Old Con∣tinent.
The same thing may be said of the
<HI>tamandua-guacu</HI> or <HI>ouariri</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tamandua-guacu, sive major; <HI>Pison. Hist. Nat. p.</HI> 320.

which we have called <HI>ant-eaters.</HI> These
animals, the largest of which is below mediocri∣ty,
seem to be peculiar to South America. Their
structure is very singular: They have no teeth;
their tongue is long and cylindrical, like that of
the birds called woodpeckers; the opening of
the mouth is so small, that they can neither bite
nor hardly lay hold of any thing; but extend
their long tongue, and, putting it in the way of
the ants, retract it when loaded with these in∣sects,
which is the only method they have of
procuring nourishment.</P>
<P>The sloth<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ai ou paresseux; <HI>Desmarchais, tom. 3. p.</HI> 300. Ouaikaré; <HI>Barrere, Hist. Fr. equin. p.</HI> 154.</NOTE>, which the natives of Brasil call
<HI>ai</HI> or <HI>hai,</HI> on account of the plaintive cry <HI>ai,</HI>
which it perpetually utters, seems likewise to be
peculiar to the New Continent. He is still
smaller than any of the former, being only about
two feet long. He is remarkable for walking
slower than the turtle, for having three toes both
<PB N="118" REF="142"/>
on the fore and hind-feet, the fore-legs much
longer than the hind ones, a very short tail, and
no external ears. Besides, the sloth and the ar∣madillo
are the only quadrupeds which have no
cutting or canine teeth, but only cylindrical
grinders rounded at the extremities, nearly like
those of some of the cetaceous animals.</P>
<P>The cariacou of Guiana is an animal of the na∣ture
and size of our largest roebucks. The
male has horns which fall off annually, and the
female has none. At Cayenne, he is called the
<HI>wood-hind.</HI> There is another species, called <HI>the
little cariacou,</HI> or <HI>marsh-hind,</HI> which is conside∣rably
smaller than the former, and the male has
no horns. From the resemblance of the name,
I suspected that the cariacou of Cayenne might
be the <HI>cuguacu</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuguacu-ete, Cuguacu-apara; <HI>Pison. hist. nat. p. 97. Marcgrau hist. Brasil p.</HI> 235. Biche des Paletuviers, Biche des bois; <HI>Barr. hist. Fr. équin. p.</HI> 151.</NOTE>, or <HI>cougouacou-apara</HI> of Bra∣sil;

are all peculiar to America, though our latest no∣menclators
mention a species of armadillo in the
East-Indies, and another in Africa. For the ex∣istence
of these, we have only the testimony of
the describer of the cabinet of Seba, which is not
an authority that merits credit; for errors arising
from the names of countries are very common
in collections of natural objects. An animal is
purchased under the name of the <HI>Ternate,</HI> or <HI>A∣merican
bat,</HI> another under that of the <HI>East-India
armadillo.</HI> They are immediately announced
under these appellations in the description of this
collection, and are adopted into the lists of our
nomenclators. But, when examined more closely,
these Ternate, or American bats, are found to be
<PB N="120" REF="144"/>
French bats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. 4. of this history, art. BAT. <HI>Seba, vol.</HI> 1. p 47. where the figure of the African armadillo is represented, and p. 62. where that of the Indian armadillo is given.</NOTE>, and the Indian or African arma∣dillos
may likewise belong to America.</P>
<P>We have not hitherto mentioned the ape tribes,
because their history demands a particular discus∣sion.
The word <HI>ape</HI> is a generic name applied
to a great number of species; it is not, therefore,
surprising, that many of them are said to be
found in the southern regions of both Conti∣nents.
But, we must now inquire whether the
apes of Asia and Africa are the same with the
American animals to which that name has been
applied, and whether, out of more than thirty
species, which we have examined alive, there
be a single one of them common to both Conti∣nents.</P>
<P>The satyr<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Satyrus Indicus, Ourang-outang Indis, et Homo sylves∣tris dict<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s: <HI>Charleton, Exer.</HI> p. 16.

differs less from that of a man than of an ape,
is peculiar to Africa and the South of Asia, and
exists not in America.</P>
<P>The gibbon<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This ape, which we have seen alive, and which was brought from Pondicherry to M. Dupleix, is not mentioned by any Nomenclator.</NOTE>, whose fore-legs, or hands, are
as long as the whole body, including the hind-legs,
is found in the East-Indies, but not in A∣merica.
These two apes have no tales.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="145"/>
The ape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Simia Simpliciter dicta; <HI>Ray, synops. quad.</HI> p. 149.</NOTE>, properly so called, whose hair is of
a greenish colour, mixed with a little yellow, and
has no tail, is a native of Africa, and some other
parts of the Old Continent, but not of the New.
The same thing may be said of the <HI>cynocephali,</HI> or
dog-headed apes, of which there are two or three
species. Their muzzle is not so short as that of
the former; but they have no tail, or it is so
short as scarcely to be visible. All the apes
which have no tail, particularly those with short
muzzles, and whose face, of course, greatly re∣sembles
that of man, are the genuine apes; and
the five or six species we have mentioned are all
natives of the warm climates of the Old Conti∣nent,
and are found in no part of the New.
Hence we are authorised to affirm, that there
are no true apes in America.</P>
<P>The baboon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Papio; <HI>Ray, synops. quad. p.</HI> 158. Babio; <HI>Charleton, Exer. p.</HI> 16. Cebus-papio, Baboon, Hyaena Gesneri; <HI>Klein. quad. p.</HI> 89.

and whose body is contracted like that of the
hyaena, is very different from the apes formerly
mentioned. His tail is very short, and always
erect; his muzzle is long, and broad at the ex∣tremity;
his buttocks are naked, and of a blood
colour; his legs are very short, and his nails
strong and sharp. This animal, which has great
strength, and is very mischievous, is found only
<PB N="122" REF="146"/>
in the southern deserts of the Old Continent, and
not in America.</P>
<P>Hence all the apes which have no tails, and
all those whose tails are remarkably short, belong
solely to the Old Continent; and, of those with
long tails, almost all the large kinds are found in
Africa. There are a few of a middle size in A∣merica;
but the animals, called <HI>little monkeys
with long tails,</HI> are very numerous in the New
World. These little monkeys are the <HI>sapajous</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monkeys with prehensile tails.</NOTE>,
the <HI>sagouins</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Monkeys with straight, but not prehensile tails.</NOTE>, the tamarins, &amp;c. When we give
the particular history of these animals, it shall be
shown that all the American monkeys are diffe∣rent
from those of Africa and Asia.</P>

species, or varieties, make a near approach to the
monkeys with long tails, having, like them,
hands, but longer and sharper muzzles, and are also
peculiar to the Old Continent. Thus all the a∣nimals
of Africa and the south of Asia, which
have received the names of <HI>apes</HI> or <HI>monkeys,</HI> are
no more to be found in America than the ele∣phant,
rhinoceros, or tiger.</P>
<P>The more minutely we inquire into this sub∣ject,
we will be the more convinced that the ani∣mals
of the southern regions of the one Con∣tinent
existed not in the other, and that the few
<PB N="123" REF="147"/>
which are now found there, were transported by
man, as the Guiney sheep, which has been carried
to Brasil; the Guiney-pig, which was brought from
Brasil into Guiney, and, perhaps, some other
small animals, the transportation of which was
facilitated by the commerce and small distance
of these two parts of the globe. Between the
coast of Guiney and that of Brasil, there are a∣bout
500 leagues of sea; and there are more than
2000 between the coast of Peru and the East-Indies.
All those animals which, from their na∣ture,
cannot endure cold climates, and even those
which, though they could subsist, cannot produce
in such climates, are confined, on two or three
sides, by seas, which they are unable to traverse,
and, on the other, by countries so cold, that they
cannot live in them. Hence we ought not to
wonder at this general fact, which at first ap∣peared
singular, and was never before so much
as suspected, namely, that none of the animals
which are natives of the Torrid Zone of the one
Continent, are to be found in the other.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>OF ANIMALS COMMON TO BOTH CONTINENTS.</HEAD>
<P>From the preceding enumeration, it appears, that
not only the quadrupeds in the warmest climates
of Africa and Asia, but most of those in the tem∣perate
regions of Europe, are wanting in Ame∣rica.
But several of our animals which can en∣dure
<PB N="124" REF="148"/>
cold, and multiply in the northern climates,
are found in North America: And, though they
differ considerably, we are obliged to acknow∣ledge
them to be the same, and to believe that
they formerly passed from the one Continent to
the other by lands, which are still unknown, or
rather have long since been swallowed up by the
ocean. This proof, drawn from natural history,
is a stronger demonstration of the almost conti∣nued
contiguity of these two Continents, than
all the conjectures of speculative geographers.</P>
<P>The bears of the Illionois, of Louisiana, &amp;c.
appear to be the same with ours; only the for∣mer
are smaller and blacker.</P>
<P>The stag of Canada, though less than ours,
differs from him only by the greater height of his
horns, more numerous antlers, and a longer tail.</P>
<P>The roebuck, which is found in the south of
Canada and in Louisiana, is likewise smaller, and
has a longer tail than the European kind. The
Orignal is the same animal with the elk, though
it is not equally large.</P>
<P>The rain-deer of Lapland, the fallow-deer of
Greenland, and the caribou of Canada, appear
to be the same animal. The fallow-deer or stag
of Greenland, described and painted by Edwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nat, hist. of birds, p. 51.</NOTE>,
has too great a resemblance to the rain-deer to
be regarded as a different species. As to the
caribou, though there is no exact description of it;
yet, from the marks we have been able to col∣lect,
<PB N="125" REF="149"/>
it seems to be the same animal with the rain-deer.
M. Brisson<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brisson. Regn. animal. p. 91.</NOTE> has made the caribou a diffe∣rent
species, and refers it to the <HI>cervus Burgun∣dicus</HI>
of Johnston. But this <HI>cervus Burgundicus</HI>
is an unknown animal, and certainly never existed
either in Burgundy or in Europe: It is a simple
name that has been given to some uncommon
horns of the stag or fallow-deer; or rather M.
Brisson may have seen the head of the caribou,
whose horns consisted of one straight stem on
each side, about ten inches long, with an antler
or branch near the base, turned forwards; or the
head of a female rain-deer; or a head of the first
or second year; for the female rain-deer bears
horns as well as the male, though much smaller,
and, in both, the direction of the first antlers is
forward; and, lastly, in this animal, as well as
in all others of the deer kind, the ramifications of
the horns are exactly proportioned to the num∣ber
of years they have lived.</P>
<P>The hares, the squirrels, the hedgehogs, the
otters, the marmots, the rats, the shrew-mice,
and the moles, are also species common to the
two Continents, though, in all these kinds, there
is not an American species perfectly similar to
those of Europe; and it is extremely difficult, if
not impossible, to pronounce with certainty
whether they are really different species, or only
varieties of the same, changed by the influence
of the climate.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="150"/>
The beavers of Europe appear to be the same
with those of Canada. Though these animals
prefer cold countries, they can subsist, and even
multiply, in temperate climates. There are still
some of them in France upon the islands of the
Rhone. Their number was formerly much
greater; and they seem to avoid populous coun∣tries
more than very warm climates. They never
establish their societies but in deserts remote from
the habitations of men: And, even in Canada,
which may be considered as a vast desert, they
have retired far from any of our settlements.</P>
<P>The wolf and fox are also common to both
continents. They are found, but with some va∣rieties,
in all parts of North America, where there
are black foxes and wolves; but all of them are
smaller than those of Europe, which is the case
with every animal, whether native or trans∣ported.</P>
<P>Though the weasel and ermine frequent the
cold countries of Europe, they are at least very
rare in America; but the pine-weasel, the mar∣tin,
and the polecat are more numerous.</P>
<P>The pine-weasel of North America appears to
be the same with ours. The vison, or pekan
weasel of Canada, has a great resemblance to the
martin; and the striped polecat of North Ame∣rica
is perhaps only a variety of the European
kind.</P>
<P>The American lynx seems to be the same
with the European. He prefers cold countries;
<PB N="127" REF="151"/>
but he likewise lives and multiplies in temperate
climates, and generally frequents the forests and
high mountains.</P>
<P>The seal, or sea-calf, seems to be confined to
northern countries, and is found equally on the
coasts of Europe and of North America.</P>
<P>These are nearly all the animals which are
common to the Old and New Worlds; and from
this number, which is not considerable, we ought,
perhaps, to retrench more than a third part,
whose species, though apparently the same, may
be different in reality. But, admitting the iden∣tity
of all these species with those of Europe, the
number common to the two continents is very
small, when compared with that of the species
peculiar to each. It is farther apparent, that,
of all these animals, it is those only which fre∣quent
the northern countries that are common
to both Continents; and that none of those
which cannot multiply in warm or temperate
climates are found in both worlds.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, no longer a doubtful point,
that the two Continents either are, or have for∣merly
been, contiguous towards the north, and
that the animals common to both have passed
from the one to the other by lands with which
we have now no acquaintance. We are led to
believe, especially since the discoveries made by
the Russians to the north of Kamtschatka, that
the lands of Asia are contiguous to those of
America; for the north of Europe seems to have
<PB N="128" REF="152"/>
been always separated from the New World by
seas too considerable to permit the passage of a∣ny
quadruped. These animals, however, of
North America, are not precisely the same with
those of the north of Asia; but have a stronger
resemblance to the quadrupeds of the north of
Europe. It is the same with the animals which
belong to the temperate climates. The argali,
or Siberian goat, the sable, the Siberian mole,
and the Chinese Musk, appear not in Hudson's
bay, nor in any other north-west part of the New
Continent; but, on the contrary, we find, in
the north-east parts of it, not only the animals
common to the north of Europe and Asia, but
likewise those which appear to be peculiar to
Europe, as the elk, the rain-deer, &amp;c. It must,
however, be acknowledged, that the north-east
parts of Asia are so little known, that we can
have no certainty whether the animals of the
north of Europe exist there or not.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, as a singular phaeno∣menon,
that the animals in the southern provin∣ces
of the New Continent, are small in propor∣tion
to those in the warm regions of the Old.
There is no comparison between the size of the
elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the
camelopard, the camel, the lion, the tiger, &amp;c. and
the tapir, the cabiai, the ant-eater, the lama, the
puma, the jaguar, &amp;c. which are the largest qua∣drupeds
of the New World: The former are
four, six, eight, and ten times larger than the
<PB N="129" REF="153"/>
latter. Another observation brings additional
strength to this general fact: All the animals
which have been transported from Europe to A∣merica,
as the horse, the ass, the ox, the sheep,
the goat, the hog, the dog, &amp;c. have become
smaller; and those which were not transported,
but went thither spontaneously, those, in a word,
which are common to both Continents, as the
wolf, the fox, the stag, the roebuck, the elk,
&amp;c. are also considerably less than those of Eu∣rope.</P>
<P>In this New World, therefore, there is some
combination of elements and other physical
causes, something that opposes the amplification
of animated Nature: There are obstacles to the
developement, and perhaps to the formation of
large germs. Even those which, from the kind∣ly
influences of another climate, have acquired
their complete form and expansion, shrink and
diminish under a niggardly sky and an unproli∣fic
land, thinly peopled with wandering savages,
who, instead of using this territory as a master,
had no property or empire; and, having sub∣jected
neither the animals nor the elements, nor
conquered the seas, nor directed the motions of
rivers, nor cultivated the earth, held only the first
rank among animated beings, and existed as a
creature of no consideration in Nature, a kind of
weak automaton, incapable of improving or se∣conding
her intentions. She treated them ra∣ther
like a stepmother than a parent, by refusing
<PB N="130" REF="154"/>
them the invigorating sentiment of love, and
the strong desire of multiplying their species.
For, though the American savage be nearly of
the same stature with men in polished societies;
yet this is not a sufficient exception to the gene∣ral
contraction of animated Nature throughout
the whole Continent. In the savage, the organs
of generation are small and feeble. He has no
hair, no beard, no ardour for the female. Though
nimbler than the European, because more accu∣stomed
to running, his strength is not so great.
His sensations are less acute; and yet he is more
timid and cowardly. He has no vivacity, no
activity of mind. The activity of his body is
not so much an exercise or spontaneous motion,
as a necessary action produced by want. De∣stroy
his appetite for victuals and drink, and you
will at once annihilate the active principle of all
his movements: He remains in stupid repose, on
his limbs or couch, for whole days. It is easy
to discover the cause of the scattered life of sa∣vages,
and of their estrangement from society.
They have been refused the most precious spark
of Nature's fire: They have no ardour for
women, and, of course, no love to mankind.
Unacquainted with the most lively and most
tender of all attachments, their other sensations
of this nature are cold and languid. Their love
to parents and children is extremely weak. The
bonds of the most intimate of all societies, that
of the same family, are feeble; and one family
<PB N="131" REF="155"/>
has no attachment to another. Hence no union,
no republic, no social state, can take place among
them. The physical cause of love gives rise to
the morality of their manners. Their heart is
frozen, their society cold, and their empire cruel.
They regard their females as servants destined to
labour, or as beasts of burden, whom they load
unmercifully with the produce of their hunting,
and oblige, without pity or gratitude, to perform
labours which often exceed their strength. They
have few children, and pay little attention to
them. Every thing must be referred to the first
cause: They are indifferent, because they are
weak; and this indifference to the sex is the o∣riginal
stain which disgraces Nature, prevents her
from expanding, and, by destroying the germs
of life, cuts the root of society.</P>
<P>Hence man makes no exception to what has
been advanced. Nature, by denying him the
faculty of love, has abused and contracted
him more than any other animal. But, before
examining the causes of this general effect, it
must be allowed, that, if Nature has diminished
all the quadrupeds in the New World, she seems
to have cherished the reptile and enlarged the
insect tribes; for, though at Senegal there are
longer serpents and larger lizards than in South
America, yet the difference between these ani∣mals
is not near so great as that which subsists
between the quadrupeds. The largest serpent
of Senegal is not double the size of the Cayenne
<PB N="132" REF="156"/>
serpent. But the elephant is perhaps ten times
the bulk of the tapir, which is the largest qua∣druped
of South America. With regard, how∣ever,
to insects, they are no where so large as in
South America. The largest spiders, beetles,
caterpillars, and butterflies, are found in Ca∣yenne
and other neighbouring provinces: Here
almost all insects exceed those of the Old
World, not in size only, but in richness of co∣louring,
delicacy of shades, variety of forms,
number of species, and the prodigious multipli∣cation
of individuals. The toads, the frogs, and
other animals of this kind, are likewise very large
in America. We shall take no notice of birds
and fishes; because, as Nature has enabled them
to pass from the one Continent to the other, it
is hardly possible to distinguish those which are
proper to each. But reptiles and insects, like
the quadrupeds, are confined to their respective
Continents.</P>
<P>Let us now examine why the reptiles and in∣sects
are so large, the quadrupeds so small, and
the men so cold, in the New World. These ef∣fects
must be referred to the quality of the earth
and atmosphere, to the degree of heat and moi∣sture,
to the situation and height of mountains,
to the quantity of running and stagnant waters,
to the extent of forests, and, above all, to the
inert condition of Nature in that country. In
this part of the globe, the heat in general is much
less, and the humidity much greater. If we
compare the heat and cold of every degree of
<PB N="133" REF="157"/>
latitude, we shall find very considerable differen∣ces:
At Quebec, for example, which is under the
same degree of latitude with Paris, the rivers freeze
every year some fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t thick; a coat of snow still
thicker covers the land for several months; the
air is so cold that the birds fly off and disappear
during the winter, &amp;c. This difference of tem∣perature
under the same latitude in the Tempe∣rate
Zone, though very considerable, is perhaps
still less than the difference of heat under the
Torrid Zone. In Senegal, the sun is perfectly
scorching; while in Peru, which lies under the
same line, an agreeable temperature prevails.
The same remark applies to all the other lati∣tudes.
The Continent of America is so formed
and situated, that every circumstance concurs in
diminishing the action of heat. America con∣tains
the highest mountains, and, of course, the
largest rivers in the world. These mountains
form a chain which seems to bound the Conti∣nent
towards the west, through its whole extent.
The plains and low grounds are all situated on
this side of the mountains, and run from their
bottoms to the sea which separates the Conti∣nents
on this side. Thus the east wind, which
blows perpetually between the Tropics, arrives
not in America, till it has traversed a vast ocean,
by which it is greatly cooled. Hence this wind
is much cooler at Brasil, Cayenne, &amp;c. than at
Senegal, Guiney, &amp;c. where it arrives impreg∣nated
with the accumulated heat acquired from
all the lands and burning sands in its passage
<PB N="134" REF="158"/>
through Asia and Africa. Let us recollect what
was remarked concerning the different colours
of men, and particularly of the Negroes. It
seemed to be demonstrated, that the greater or
less degree of a tawny, brown, or black colour,
depends entirely on the situation of the climate;
that the Negroes of Nigritia, and those of the west
coast of Africa, are blackest; because their coun∣tries
are situated in such a manner, that the heat
is always greater than in any other part of the
globe, the east wind, before its arrival, having
traversed vast tracts of land; that, on the con∣trary,
the American Indians under the line are
only tawny, and the Brasilians brown, though
under the same latitude with the Negroes; be∣cause
the heat of their climate is neither so great
nor so constant, the east wind arriving not till
after being cooled by the waters, and loaded
with moist vapours. The clouds which inter∣cept
the light and heat of the sun, and the rains
which refresh the air and the surface of the earth,
are periodic, and continue several months in
Cayenne, and other regions of South America.
This first cause renders all the east coasts of A∣merica
much more temperate than Africa or
Asia: And, after the east wind has arrived in a
cool state, in traversing the plains of America, it
begins to assume a greater degree of heat, when
it is suddenly stopped and cooled by that enor∣mous
chain of mountains of which the western
part of the New Continent is composed; so that
<PB N="135" REF="159"/>
it is still colder under the line at Peru, than at
Brasil, Cayenne, &amp;c. on account of the prodigi∣ous
elevation of the land. Hence the natives of
Peru, Chili, &amp;c. are less brown, red, or tawny,
than those of Brasil. If these mountains were
reduced to a level with the adjacent plains, the
heat on the western coasts would become exces∣sive,
and we would soon find Negroes at Peru
and Chili, as well as upon the west coasts of
Africa.</P>
<P>Thus, from the situation alone of the land in
the New Continent, the heat must be greatly in∣ferior
to that of the Old; and I shall now show,
that there is likewise a greater degree of moi∣sture
in America. The mountains, being the
highest upon the globe, and being opposed to the
direction of the east wind, stop and condense
all the aerial vapours, and, of course, give rise to
an infinite number of springs, which, by uniting,
soon form the greatest rivers in the world. Hence
in the New Continent, there are more running
waters, in proportion to the extent of territory,
than in the Old; and this quantity of water is
greatly increased for want of proper drains or
outlets. The natives having neither stopped
the torrents, nor directed the rivers, nor drain∣ed
the marshes, the stagnating waters cover im∣mense
tracts of land, augment the moisture of
the air, and diminish its heat. Besides, as the
earth is every where covered with trees, shrubs,
and gross herbage, it never dries. The transpi∣ration
of so many vegetables, pressed close to∣gether,
<PB N="136" REF="160"/>
produce immense quantities of moist and
noxious exhalations. In these melancholy re∣gions,
Nature remains concealed under her old
garments, and never exhibits herself in fresh
attire; being neither cherished nor cultivated by
man, she never opens her fruitful and beneficent
womb. Here the Earth never saw her sur∣face
adorned with those rich crops, which de∣monstrate
her fecundity, and constitute the o∣pulence
of polished nations. In this abandoned
condition, every thing languishes, corrupts, and
proves abortive. The air and the earth, over∣loaded
with humid and noxious vapours, are
unable either to purify themselves, or to profit
by the influences of the Sun, who darts in vain
his most enlivening rays upon this frigid mass,
which is not in a condition to make suitable
returns to his ardour. Its powers are limited to
the production of moist plants, reptiles, and in∣sects,
and can only afford nourishment to cold
men and feeble animals.</P>
<P>The scarcity of men, therefore, in America,
and most of them living like the brutes, is the
chief cause why the earth remains in a frigid
state, and is incapable of producing the active
principles of Nature. To expand the germs of
the largest quadrupeds, and to enable them to
grow and multiply, requires all the activity which
the sun can give to a fertile earth. It is for the
opposite reason, that insects, reptiles, and all the
animals which wallow in the mire, whose blood
<PB N="137" REF="161"/>
is watery, and which multiply in corruption,
are larger and more numerous in the low, moist,
and marshy lands of the New Continent.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the these remarkable diffe∣rences
between the Old and New World, we are
inclined to believe that the latter is actually more
recent, and has continued longer than the rest of
the globe under the waters of the ocean; for,
if we except the enormous western mountains,
which appear to be monuments of the highest
antiquity which this globe affords, all the low
parts of this continent seem to be new lands, e∣levated
and formed by the sediments of waters.
In many places, immediately under the vegetable
stratum, we find sea shells and madrepores alrea∣dy
forming large masses of lime-stone, but which
are commonly softer than our free-stone. If
this continent be really as antient as the other,
why was it so thinly peopled? Why were almost
its whole inhabitants wandering savages? Why
did the Peruvians and Mexicans, who had uni∣ted
into society, reckon only two or three hun∣dred
years since the existence of the first man
who taught them to associate? Why are they
still ignorant of the art of transmitting facts to
posterity by permanent signs, since they had
already discovered a method of conveying their
ideas at a distance by tying knots upon cords?
Why did they not reduce the lama, the pacos,
and other animals, into a domestic state? Their
arts, like their society, were in embryo; their
<PB N="138" REF="162"/>
talents were imperfect, their ideas locked up, their
organs rude, and their language barbarous. Be∣low
is a list of animals, whose names are so dif∣ficult
to pronounce, that it is surprising how the
Europeans could submit to the trouble of wri∣ting

Hence every circumstance indicates that the
Americans are new men, or rather men who
had been so long separated from their original
country, that they had lost every idea of the part
of the world from which they had issued; that
the greatest part of the continent of America
was new land, still untouched by the hand of
man, and in which Nature had not time suffi∣cient
to accomplish her plans, or to unfold the
whole extent of her productions; that the men
are cold, and the animals small, because the ardour
of the former, and the magnitude of the latter,
depend upon the salubrity and heat of the air;
and that, some centuries hence, when the lands
are cultivated, the forests cut down, the courses
of the rivers properly directed, and the marshes
drained, this same country will become the most
fertile, the most wholesome, and the richest in the
whole world, as it is already in all the parts which
have experienced the industry and skill of man.
We mean not, however, to conclude, that large a∣nimals
would then be produced. The tapir and
cabiai will never acquire the magnitude of the
elephant or hippopotamus. But the animals
transported thither will no longer diminish, as
they have formerly done. Man will gradually
fill up the vacuities in these immense territories,
which were perfect deserts when first discover∣ed.</P>
<P>The first historians of the Spanish conquest,
to augment the glory of their arms, have exag∣gerated
<PB N="140" REF="164"/>
prodigiously the number of the enemies
they had to encounter. Can these historians persuade
any man of sense, that there were millions of in∣habitants
in Cuba and St Domingo, when, at the
same time, there was neither a monarchy, a re∣public,
nor hardly any society among them; and
that, in these two large adjacent islands, and at
no great distance from the continent, there were
only five species of quadrupeds, the largest of
which exceeded not the size of a squirrel or a
rabbit? Nothing can be a stronger proof of the
empty and desert state of nature in those new
lands. “We found,” says Laet, “in the island
of St Domingo, but few species of quadrupeds,
as the <HI>hutias,</HI> which differs not much from
our rabbit, but is only a little smaller, with
short erect ears, and a tail like that of a mole;
—the <HI>chemi,</HI> which is nearly of the same form
with the <HI>hutias,</HI> but somewhat larger;—the
<HI>molui,</HI> which is smaller than the <HI>hutias;</HI>—the
<HI>cori,</HI> of equal size with the rabbit; its mouth
resembles that of the mole; it has no tail, and
its legs are short; some of them are black, but
oftener a mixture of the two; it is a domestic
animal, and very tame;—besides a small kind
of <HI>dogs,</HI> which were absolutely mute; their
number is now much diminished, because the
European dogs have destroyed them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. du Nouv. Monde, par Jean Laet, liv. 1. chap. 4. p. 5. L'Hist. de l'isle Saint Domingue, par le P. Charlevoix, tom. 1. p. 35.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="165"/>
“In the islands of St Domingo, Cuba, and the
Antilles,” says Acosta<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Hist nat. des Indies, par Joseph Acosta, p. 144.</NOTE>, “there were hardly
any of the animals belonging to the continent
of America, and not one that resembled those
of Europe.” All the sheep, goats, horses,
oxen, and asses,' remarks Father du Tertre,
in the Antilles, in Guadaloupe, and in all
the French islands, have been brought there
by the people of that nation; for none were
carried there by the Spaniards, because the
Antilles were then so thickly covered with
wood, that the cattle could find no herbage
for their subsistence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. gen. des Antilles, par le P. du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 289. where the reader will find many articles borrowed from Joseph Acosta.</NOTE>.” M. Fabry, who tra∣versed,
during fifteen months, the western ter∣ritories
of America, beyond the Missisippi, assu∣red
me, that he often travelled three or four hun∣dred
leagues, without seeing a single man. All
our military gentlemen, who travelled from
Quebec to the river Ohio, and from the Ohio to
Louisiana, agree, that a person may frequently
travel one or two hundred leagues, in the depth
of the forests, and not meet with a single family
of savages. All those testimonies demonstrate
the desert and melancholy state of the New Con∣tinent,
even where the temperature of the cli∣mate
is most agreeable. But, what is more direct∣ly
to our present purpose, they destroy the posterior
<PB N="142" REF="166"/>
evidence of our nomenclators, and describers of
cabinets, who people the New World with the
animals peculiar to the Old, and mark others
as natives of particular countries where they ne∣ver
existed. For example, it is certain, that, in
St Domingo, there was originally no quadruped
larger than a rabbit; and, though there had, they
would have been devoured by the European
dogs, which soon became as wild and ferocious
as wolves: However, to the <HI>marac</HI> or <HI>maracai</HI> of
Brasil, they have given the name of the tiger-cat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Felis silvestris, <HI>Tigrinus in Hispaniola; Seba, vol. 1. p.</HI> 77.</NOTE>
of St Domingo, though it is no where
found but on the continent. They have made
the scaley lizard, or long-tailed manis of Java,
an American animal, called <HI>tatoe</HI> by the Brasi∣lians<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Seba, vol. 1. p. 88.</NOTE>
which is peculiar to the East Indies:
They maintain, that the civet<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Brisson. Regn. anim. p. 258.</NOTE>, which is a na∣tive
of the southern parts of the Old Continent,
is found also in New Spain, without considering
that a creature so useful, which is reared in se∣veral
parts of Africa, of the Levant, and the
Indies, as a domestic animal, for the purposes of
collecting the musk, an important article of com∣merce,
would not have been neglected by the
Spaniards, if the civets really existed in New
Spain.</P>
<P>But our nomenclators have likewise denied to
America some animals to which she has an original
<PB N="143" REF="167"/>
title. They have placed the opossum in the
East Indies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seba, vol. 1. p. 61, 64.</NOTE>, and the sloth in Ceylon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. p. 54.</NOTE>, though
these animals belong solely to the New World,
and are so remarkable, the one for a sac under
its belly in which it carries its young, the other
for the extreme slowness of all its movements,
that, if they existed in the East Indies, travellers
could never have passed them over in silence.
Seba relies on the authority of Francis Valantine
for the East India opossum. But this authority
can have no weight; for Francis Valantine was
so ignorant of the quadruped <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd fishes of Am∣boyna,
and his descriptions are so bad, that Ar∣tedi
declares no use can be made of his infor∣mation.</P>
<P>We pretend not, however, to affirm absolutely,
that none of the quadrupeds in the warm climates
are common to both continents. Of this we
can have no physical certainty, till the whole of
them be accurately examined. But it is evident,
that none of the large, and very few of the small
American animals, exist in the Old Continent.
Besides, though there should be some exceptions,
which I hardly imagine, they must be limited
to a very small number of animals, and could
have no influence on the general law which I
mean to establish, and which seems to be the
only rule for enabling us to acquire a proper
knowledge of the animal kingdom. This law,
<PB N="144" REF="168"/>
which leads us to judge as much by the climate
and dispositions of animals, as by their figure and
structure, will seldome deceive, and will enable
us to avoid or detect a multiplicity of errors.
Suppose the question, for example, to be concern∣ing
an Arabian animal, as the hyaena, we may
safely pronounce that it exists not in Lapland;
but we will never mantain, with some naturalists,
that the hyaena and glutton are the same ani∣mal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Regn. anim. par Brisson, p. 234.</NOTE>,
nor with Kolbe, that the cross-fox, which
inhabits the most northern regions of the New
Continent, is found at the Cape of Good
Hope<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Descript. du Cap, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 62.</NOTE> and we will find, that this animal is
not a fox, but a jackall: Neither should the
animal, called by the same author the <HI>earth∣hog,</HI>
which feeds upon ants, be confounded with
the ant-eaters of America: This Cape animal
is probably the manis or scaley lizard<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. p. 43.</NOTE> which
has no other resemblance to the ant-eater, than that
of using the same food. In the same manner,
if it had been considered, that the rain-deer<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Id. ib. p. 128.</NOTE> is
a northern animal, this name would have never
been applied to an African antelope. The phoca,
or seal, which frequents the seas of the north,
ought not to be found at the Cape of Good
Hope<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Brisson, Regn. anim. p. 230. where he says, after Kolbe, that the seal is called a <HI>sea-d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g</HI> by the inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope.</NOTE>. The genet, which is a native of Spain,
Asia Minor, &amp;c. and peculiar to the Old Con∣tinent,
<PB N="145" REF="169"/>
is ranked by Klein under the name of
<HI>Coati</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein, de quad. p. 63.</NOTE>, which is an American animal. The
<HI>ysquiepatl</HI> of Mexico, an animal which exhales
an offensive odour, and for that reason we shall
rank it with the pole-cats, should never be consi∣dered
as a small fox or badger<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Seba, vol. 1. Brisson. Regn. anim. p. 255.</NOTE>. The <HI>Coati mondi</HI>
of America should not be confounded, as has
been done by Aldrovandus<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aldrovand. quad. digit. p. 267.</NOTE>, with the badger∣hog,
which is always mentioned as an European
animal. But I mean not to exhibit all the er∣rors
of nomenclators: My aim is to prove, that
their blunders would not have been so numerous,
if they had attended to the difference of climates;
if they had studied the histories of animals, and
discovered, as I have done, that those of the south∣ern
parts of each Continent are never found in
both; and, lastly, if they had abstained from
generic names, by which numbers of species, not
only different, but very remote from each other,
are blended together.</P>
<P>Thus the genuine object of a nomenclator is
not to lengthen, but to contract his list, by ma∣king
impartial inquiries and comparisons. No
task can be easier than to peruse all the writers
on animals, and to form a table of their names
and phrases, which will always be longer in pro∣portion
as the labour bestowed in vestigation is
less: But nothing is more difficult than to ex∣amine
<PB N="146" REF="170"/>
and compare animals with that judgment
and discernment, which are necessary to reduce
this table to its just dimensions. I again repeat,
that there are not in the whole habitable earth
above two hundred species of animals, even inclu∣ding
forty different species of monkeys. To each of
these, therefore, we have only to allot a proper name;
and a very indifferent memory is able to retain
two hundred names. For what purpose, then, are
quadrupeds arranged into classes, orders, and ge∣nera?
Methodical distributions are only a kind
of scaffolds invented to aid the memory in the re∣collection
of plants, the number of which is so
great, their distinctions so minute, and their
species so liable to variation, that it is necessary
to consider them in bundles or genera, by put∣ting
together such as have the greatest simila∣rity
to each other. As in all works of genius, what
is absolutely useless, is always ill imagined, and
often becomes hurtful, instead of giving names to
two hundred quadrupeds, we have dictionaries
loaded with such a variety of terms and phrases,
that it would require more labour to explain,
than was spent in composing them. Why em∣ploy
a phraseological jargon, when we can speak
plain language, by pronouncing simple names?
Why change all the acceptation of terms, un∣der
the pretext of making classes and genera?
When a genus is composed of a dozen of animals,
under the name, for example, of the <HI>rabbit,</HI> why
is not the rabbit itself to be found there, but must
<PB N="147" REF="171"/>
be sought for under the genus of <HI>hare</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brisson. Regn. anim. p, 140. 142.</NOTE>? Is it
not absurd, and even ridiculous, to fabricate
classes, where genera the most remote are assem∣bled
together; for example, to unite in the first,
<HI>man</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lin. syst. nat. Holmiae, 1758. tom, 1. p. 18. 19.</NOTE> and the <HI>bat;</HI> in the second, the <HI>elephant</HI> and
<HI>scaly lizard;</HI> in the third, the <HI>lion</HI> and the <HI>ferret;</HI> in
the fourth, the <HI>hog</HI> and the <HI>mole;</HI> in the fifth, the
<HI>rhinoceros</HI> and the <HI>rat?</HI> &amp;c. Such heterogeneous
and ill conceived ideas cannot be supported.
The works, accordingly, which contain fancies
so crude, have been successively destroyed by
their own authors. One edition contradicts an∣other,
and the whole receives no applause but
from tyros and children, who are uniformly
the dupes of mystery, to whom the fopperies of
method appear to be scientific, and, in fine, who
respect their master in proportion to the talent
he possesses of representing the clearest and mos
perspicuous objects under the most abstruse and
dark points of view.</P>
<P>By comparing the fourth edition of Linnaeus's
work with the tenth, we find, that man<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. edit. 4. p. 64.</NOTE> is no
longer ranked with the bat, but with the scaly
lizard; that the elephant, the hog, and the rhi∣noceros,
instead of being ranked, the first with
the scaly lizard, the second with the mole, and
the third with the rat, are all associated with the
shrew-mouse<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. p. 69.</NOTE>. Instead of the five orders or
classes<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. p. 63.</NOTE> of <HI>anthropomorpha, ferae, glires, ju∣menta,</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="172"/>
and <HI>pecora,</HI> to which he had reduced all
quadrupeds, the author, in this last edition, has
split them into seven,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lin. syst. nat. edit. 1. p. 16. 17.</NOTE>, viz. <HI>primates, bruta,
ferae, bestiae, glires, pecora, belluae.</HI> From these
general changes, we may conceive the many al∣terations
introduced among the genera and spe∣cies,
which last alone have any real existence.
He says, that there are two species of men, the
<HI>day-man</HI> and the <HI>night-man, homo diurnus sapi∣ens;
homo nocturnus troglodites</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. ib. p. 20. 24.</NOTE>; and that these
distinct species should not be regarded as varieties
only<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Speciem trogloditae ab homine sapiente distinctissimam, nec nostri generis illam nec sanguinis esse, statura quamvis si∣millimam dubium non est, ne itaque varietatem credas quam vel sola membrana nictitans absolute negat; <HI>Lyn. syst. nat. edit. x. p.</HI> 24.</NOTE>. Is not this to add fable to absurdity, to
represent the ravings of old women, or the false∣hoods
of credulous travellers, as constituting a
principal part in the system of Nature? Is it not
better to be silent with regard to matters of
which we are ignorant, than to establish essential
characters and general distinctions upon the gross∣est
errors, such as, for example, that, of all ani∣mals
which give suck, woman alone has a clito∣ris<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Id. ib. p. 24. 25.</NOTE>?
This is so opposite to the truth, that, of
above a hundred different animals which we have
dissected, not a single one wanted that part. But
I have dwelt, perhaps, too long on criticisms of
<PB N="149" REF="173"/>
this kind, especially as they are not my principal
object. I have said enough to guard the reader
against errors both of a general and particular
kind, which are no where so numerous as in the
works of nomenclators; because, being sollicitous
to comprehend every thing within the limits of
their systems, they are obliged to associate all that
they are ignorant of, with the little that they
know.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, the following
general conclusions may be drawn: That man
is the only animated being on whom Nature has
bestowed sufficient strength, genius, and ductility,
to enable him to subsist and to multiply in every
climate of the earth. No other animal, it is evi∣dent,
has obtained this great privilege; for, in∣stead
of multiplying every where, most of them
are limited to certain climates, and even to par∣ticular
countries. Man is totally a production
of heaven: But the animals, in many respects,
are only creatures of the earth. Those of one
Continent are not found in another; or, if there
are a few exceptions, the animals are so changed
and contracted, that they are hardly to be recog∣nised.
Is any farther argument necessary to con∣vince
us, that the model of their form is not un∣alterable;
that their nature, less fixed than that
of man, may be varied, and even absolutely
changed in a succession of ages; that, for the
same reason, the least perfect, the least active, and
<PB N="150" REF="174"/>
the worst defended, as well as the most delicate
and heavy species, have already, or will soon dis∣appear;
for their very existence depends on the
form which man gives or allows to the surface
of the earth?</P>
<P>The prodigious <HI>mammouth,</HI> whose enormous
bones I have often viewed with astonishment,
and which were, at least, six times larger than
those of largest elephant, has now no exist∣ence;
yet the remains of him have been found
in many places remote from each other, as in
Ireland, Siberia, Louisiana, &amp;c. This species
was unquestionably the largest and strongest of
all quadrupeds; and, since it has disappeared,
how many smaller, weaker, and less remarkable
species must likewise have perished, without lea∣ving
any evidence of their past existence? How
many others have undergone such changes, ei∣ther
from degeneration or improvement, occa∣sioned
by the great vicissitudes of the earth and
waters, the neglect or cultivation of Nature, the
continued influence of favourable or hostile cli∣mates,
that they are now no longer the same
creatures? Yet the quadrupeds, next to man,
are beings whose nature and form are the most
permanent. Birds and fishes are subject to greater
variations: The insect-tribes are liable to still
greater vicissitudes: And, if we descend to vege∣tables,
which ought not to be excluded from a∣nimated
Nature, our wonder will be excited by
<PB N="151" REF="175"/>
the quickness and facility with which they as∣sume
new forms.</P>
<P>Hence, it is not impossible, that, without in∣verting
the order of Nature, all the animals of
the New World were originally the same with
those of the Old, from whom they derive their
existence; but that, being afterwards separated
by immense seas, or impassable lands, they would,
in the progress of time, suffer all the effects of a
climate that had become new to them, and must
have had its qualities changed by the very causes
which produced the separation, and, consequent∣ly,
degenerate, &amp;c. But these circumstances
should not prevent them from being now regard∣ed
as different species of animals. From whatever
cause these changes, produced by the operation of
time and the influence of climate, have originated,
and though we should date them from the crea∣tion
itself, they are not the less real. Nature, I
allow, is in a perpetual state of fluctuation: But
it is enough for man to seize her in his own age,
and to look backward and forward, in order to
discover her former condition, and what future
appearances she may probably assume.</P>
<P>With regard to the utility of this mode of com∣paring
animals, it is evident, that, independent
of ascertaining names, of which some examples
have been given, it extends our knowledge of
the animal creation, and renders it more certain
and perfect; that it prevents us from ascribing,
to American animals, properties which are pecu∣liar
<PB N="152" REF="176"/>
to those of the East-Indies, only because they
have the same name; that, in examining the no∣tices
of foreign animals communicated by travel∣lers,
it will enable us to distinguish names and
facts, and to refer each to its proper species;
and, lastly, that it will render the history which
I am now composing less defective, and per∣haps
more conspicuous and complete.</P>

<HEAD>THE TIGER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Tiger has six cutting, and two canine teeth in each jaw; five toes before, and four behind. The claws are sharp, hooked, lodged in a sheath, and may be exerted or drawn in at pleasure. The head is round, the visage short, and the tongue rough. Both the head and body of the tiger are smooth. He has vast strength in his limbs. His colour is a pale yellow, beautifully marked with long stripes of black, pointing from the back to the belly, and others across the thighs. The tail is about one third shorter than the body, and annulated with black. His size is often superior to that of the lion. The <HI>Royal</HI> tiger is of a tremendous bulk.

<P>IN the class of carnivorous animals, the lion
holds the first rank, and the tiger the second.
As the first of a bad genus is always the largest,
and has often the best dispositions, the second is
generally the most rapacious and destructive. To
pride, courage, and strength, the lion adds dig∣nity,
clemency, and magnanimity. But the ti∣ger
is grossly ferocious, and cruel without neces∣sity.
<PB N="154" REF="178"/>
The same thing takes place in all nature,
where rank is the offspring of strength. The
first, in which all power resides, is less tyranni∣cal
than his immediate inferior, who, unable to
obtain unlimited power, avenges himself, by a∣busing
that portion of it which he enjoys. Thus
the tiger is more to be dreaded than the lion.
The latter often forgets that he is the sovereign,
or the strongest of all animals. He moves for∣ward
with tranquillity and steadiness, and never
attacks man, unless when provoked. He never
runs with precipitation, nor gives chace, but
when pressed with hunger. The tiger, on the
contrary, though satiated with carnage, seems to
be perpetually thirsting for blood. His fury has
no intervals, but during the time he is obliged
to lie in ambush for prey at the sides of rivers.
He seizes and tears to pieces a fresh animal with
the same rage that he exerted in devouring the
first. He desolates the country which he inha∣bits,
and fears neither the aspect nor the arms of
man. He puts to death whole flocks of dome∣stic
animals, and all the wild beasts which come
in his way: He attacks the young elephant and
rhinoceros, and sometimes even ventures to brave
the lion.</P>
<P>The form of the body generally accords with
the natural disposition. The air of the lion is
noble; the height of his limbs is proportioned
to the length of his body. His large thick mane,
which covers his shouldiers, and forms a shade to
<PB N="155" REF="179"/>
his face, his determined aspect, his grave de∣meanour,
all concur in announcing his proud
and majestic intrepidity. The too great length
of the body of the tiger, and his disproportion∣ately
short limbs, his naked head, his haggard
eyes, and his blood-coloured tongue, which al∣ways
lolls out of his mouth, are marks of ig∣noble
malice and insatiable cruelty. He has no
instinct but perpetual rage, a blind and undi∣stinguishing
ferocity, which often impells him
to devour his own young, and to tear in pieces
their mother, when she attempts to defend them.
May this excessive thirst for blood never be al∣layed,
till he has destroyed the whole race of
monsters which he produces!</P>
<P>It is a fortunate circumstance for the other a∣nimals,
that the species of the tiger is not nume∣rous,
and appears to be confined to the warmest
regions of the East Indies. Tigers are found in
Malabar, in Siam, in Bengal, the same countries
which are inhabited by the elephant and rhino∣ceros.
They are even said to follow the rhino∣ceros
for the purpose of eating his dung<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jac. Bontii Hist. Nat. Ind. Orient. p. 54. Recueil des voyages de la Compagnie des Indes, tom. 7. p. 278. Voyage de Schoutten aux Indes Orientales.</NOTE>, which
both refreshes and purges them. They frequent,
with him, the borders of the rivers and lakes;
for, as blood only augments their thirst, they
have often occasion for water, to cool the fer∣vour
which consumes them. Besides, they watch,
<PB N="156" REF="180"/>
near the waters, the approach of animals, which
the heat of the climate obliges to resort thither
several times a day. Here they procure their
prey, or rather multiply their massacres; for
they often leave the creatures they have recently
killed, to devour others. They delight in blood,
and glut themselves with it till they are intoxi∣cated.
They tear the body for no other pur∣pose
than to plunge their head into it, and to
drink large draughts of blood, the sources of
which are generally exhausted before their thirst
is appeased.</P>
<P>When, however, the tiger kills large animals,
as a horse or buffalo, he does not tear out their
bowels on the spot; but, to prevent interruption,
and that he may devour them at leisure, he drags
them off to the wood with such incredible swift∣ness,
that his course seems to be hardly retarded
by their enormous weight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jac. Bontii Hist. Nat. Ind. Orient. p. 53.</NOTE>. This is sufficient to
give an idea of his strength; but it will be ren∣dered
still clearer by attending to the dimensions
of his body. Some travellers have compared
him to the horse<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Les voyages de Dellon, p. 104.</NOTE>, others to the buffalo<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The tigers of India, says Boullaye-le-Gouz, are of a pro∣digious size. I have seen skins of them longer and wider than that of a buffalo. They are sometimes addicted to eat men; and, in many parts of India, no man travels without being well armed, because the tiger, whose figure resembles that of a cat, raises himself on his hind-legs, and leaps up∣on the person he attacks; <HI>Voyage de la Boullaye-le-Gouz, p.</HI> 246. 247.</NOTE>, and
<PB N="157" REF="181"/>
others have only said that he is much larger than
the lion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prosper. Alp. Hist. Nat. Aegypt. p. 237. Wotton, p. 65.</NOTE>. But we have authorities more re∣cent,
and above all suspicion. We are assured
by M. de la Lande-Magon, that he has seen, in
the East Indies, a tiger of fifteen feet in length,
including the tail, which, supposing it to be four
or five feet, the length of the body was at least
ten. The skin preserved in the royal cabi∣net,
it is true, exceeds not seven feet from the
extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the tail.
But the tiger to which it belonged was taken when
very young, and was ever afterward confined
in a narrow apartment, where the want of ex∣ercise
and room, the languor and restraint of con∣finement,
and unnatural food, shortened his life,
and prevented the proper extension of his body.
In the history of the stag<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See vol. IV. Art. STAG.</NOTE>, it was remarked, that
these animals, when taken young, and shut up
in too small parks, not only never acquired their
natural size, but became deformed and ricketty.
We likewise learn, from the dissections of every
species of animals brought up in houses or court∣yards,
that their bodies and members, for want of
exercise, never acquire their natural dimensions;
that such organs as cannot be used, as those of
generation, are so minute, in all captive and soli∣tary
animals, that it is difficult to discover them.
The difference of climate alone may produce the
same effects as confinement and want of exer∣cise.
<PB N="158" REF="182"/>
Animals peculiar to warm climates, though
left at liberty, and well fed, are incapable of mul∣tiplying
in cold countries: And, reproduction be∣ing
the natural effect of copious nutrition, it is
evident, that, as the former faculty is destroy∣ed,
the latter must also be incomplete; and
that, in these animals, cold alone is sufficient to
restrain the action of the internal mould, and to
diminish growth, since it is capable of oblitera∣ting
the power of reproduction.</P>
<P>It is not, therefore, surprising, that this tiger,
whose skin and skeleton is preserved in the roy∣al
cabinet, should not have acquired its natural
size. The bare inspection, however, of this
stuffed skin, and of the skeleton, conveys an idea
of a most formidable animal. Upon the bones
of the leg, there are rugosities, or impressions,
which indicate the attachment of muscles still
stronger than those of the lion. These bones are
also equally strong, though shorter; and, as for∣merly
remarked, the height of the tiger's legs is
not proportioned to the great length of his bo∣dy.
Hence the incredible swiftness ascribed to
him by Pliny, and which is implied in the name
of the animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tigris</HI> vocabulum est linguae Armeniae; nam ibi et sa∣gitta et quod vehementissimum flumen, dicitur <HI>Tigris; Varro de lingua Latina</HI>—Persae et Medi sagittam <HI>Tigrim</HI> nuncupant; <HI>Gesn. hist. quad. p.</HI> 936.</NOTE>, cannot be attributed to his ordi∣nary
movements, nor even to the quickness of a
continued course; for it is apparent, from the
<PB N="159" REF="183"/>
shortness of his legs, that he can neither walk nor
run<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The terrible swiftness, says Bontius, ascribed by Pliny to this animal, is an error. On the contrary, he runs slowly; and this is the reason why he more willingly attacks men than swift animals, as the stag, the wild boar, the buffalo, or the wild ox, and why he attacks all animals by ambuscade. He darts with impetuosity upon their heads, and beats the strongest animals to the ground with a single stroke of his paw; <HI>Bont. p.</HI> 53. It is easy to reconcile these facts with the expressions of Pliny.</NOTE> with such celerity as those animals whose
legs are proportionally longer. But this pro∣digious
swiftness may, with propriety, be applied
to the terrible bounds which he makes without
any extraordinary effort; for, if we suppose his
strength and suppleness to be proportioned to
those of the cat, which he greatly resembles in
structure, and which leaps, in an instant, to the
distance of many feet, the tiger, whose body is
ten times longer, may, nearly in the same in∣stant,
leap many fathoms. Hence it is not the
celerity of his course, but the quickness of his
leap, which Pliny meant to describe, and which
renders this animal tremendous, because it is im∣possible
to avoid him, after he makes his spring.</P>
<P>The tiger is perhaps the only animal whose
ferocity cannot be subdued. Neither violence
nor restraint have any effect in softening his
temper. He is equally irritated with gentle or
rough treatment. The mild influence of society
makes no impression on the obduracy of his na∣ture.
Time, instead of mollifying the ferocious∣ness
<PB N="160" REF="184"/>
of his humour, only exasperates his rage.
With equal wrath he tears the hand which feeds
him, as that which is lifted up to strike him.
He roars at the sight of every thing that lives.
Every object appears to him as a fresh prey,
which he devours beforehand with the avidity
of his eyes, menaces with frightful groans, and
the grinding of his teeth, and often darts upon
it, without regarding his chains, which only re∣strain,
but cannot calm his fury.</P>
<P>To complete the idea of the strength of this
animal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Indi tigrim elephanto robustiorem multo existimant. Ne∣archus scribit, Indos referre tigrim esse maximi equi magnitu∣dine, velocitate et viribus bestias omnes superare, elephantum etiam, insilientem in caput ejus, facile sustocare; <HI>Gesn. hist. quad. p.</HI> 937.</NOTE>, we shall give Father Tachard's re∣lation
of a combat between a tiger and two e∣lephants.
“A palisade<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Premier voyage de Siam, par le Perè Tachard, p. 292.</NOTE>,' says this author, `of a∣bout
a hundred paces square, was erected. In∣to
this inclosure two elephants were introdu∣ced,
for the purpose of fighting a tiger. They
were defended by a kind of plastron, in the
form of a mask, which covered the head and a
part of the trunk. As soon as we arrived, a
large tiger was brought out of his lodge. His
colour and figure were new to the Frenchmen
who were present at this combat; for he was
not only much longer and thicker than those
we have seen in France, but his skin was dif∣ferently
spotted. Instead of spots scattered
<PB N="161" REF="185"/>
without order, he had long, broad, circular
bands, which, arising from the back, joined
below the belly, and were continued along the
tail, in the form of alternate white and black
rings. There was nothing peculiar in his head
or limbs, excepting that they were larger than
those of common tigers, though the animal
had not yet acquired his full growth; for M.
Constance informed us, that there were tigers
in that kingdom three times larger; and that,
when hunting along with the king, he had
once seen a tiger nearly as large as the biggest
mule. They have also a smaller kind, like
that brought from Africa to Europe, one of
which I was shown the same day at Louvo.”</P>
<P>“The tiger destined for the combat was not
let loose, but was so fixed by two cords, that,
having no liberty to spring, the first elephant
which approached gave him two or three
blows on the back with his trunk. These
strokes were so heavy, that they beat the tiger
to the ground, where he lay for some time as
if he had been dead. But, though this first
attack had abated his fury, he was no sooner
united, than he gave a horrible roar, and made
a spring at the elephant's trunk, which was
stretched out to strike him. The elephant,
however, dexterously drew up his trunk, pro∣tected
it with his tusks, which he presented at
the same time, and with them he threw the
tiger to a great height in the air. The tiger
<PB N="162" REF="186"/>
was so stunned, that he made no farther ad∣vances,
but took several turns round the pali∣sade,
and sometimes sprung towards the people
in the galleries. Three elephants were then
set upon him, each of whom, in their turn,
gave him such blows, that he again seemed to
be dead, and afterwards endeavoured only to
avoid his enemies, who would unquestionably
have killed him, if an end had not been put to
the combat.” Even from Father Tachard's
description, it is plain, that the tiger he saw fight
with the elephants is the true tiger; that he ap∣peared
to be a new animal to the Frenchmen,
because they had probably seen, in France, only
African panthers or leopards, or, rather, the A∣merican
jaguars; and that the small tiger he saw
at Luovo was nothing but a panther. We may
likewise conceive, from this simple narrative, the
amazing strength and ferocity of the tiger.
Though young, and not arrived at his full
growth, though a captive, and bound with ropes,
though single against three; yet this tiger was so
formidable to those enormous animals, that all
the parts of their bodies which Nature had not
defended with an impenetrable skin, were o∣bliged
to be covered with plastrons or cushions.</P>
<P>The tiger, of which an anatomical description
was made by the Jesuits at China, and commu∣nicated
to the Academy of Sciences by Father
Gouie<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The spotted tiger is the only one known in Europe. But in Tartary and China, there are tigers with black bands or belts; and, even in these countries, two species are men∣tioned, though no other differences appear to exist. The tiger dissected by the Jesuits of China, which had been kil∣led in the chace by the Emperor, along with other four, weighed only 265 pounds, and, consequently, was none of the largest; another of them weighed 400 pounds. The one that was dissected had a third part of his stomach filled with worms, though it is not said that he was in a putrid state. Some of the people who were present remarked, that they had observed the same appearance in a tiger which was dis∣sected at Macao; <HI>Hist. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année</HI> 1699, p. 51.</NOTE>, seemed to be the genuine tiger, as well
<PB N="163" REF="187"/>
as that called the <HI>Royal Tiger,</HI> mentioned by
Perrault<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. pour servir a l'hist. des anim. part. 2. p. 287.</NOTE>, in his memoirs concerning animals,
and of which he says the description was made
in Siam. Dellon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Dellon, p. 104.</NOTE>, in his voyages, mentions
expressly, that tigers are more frequent in Mala∣bar
than in any other part of the East Indies;
that there are several species of them; but that
the largest, which is as big as a horse, and called
the <HI>Royal Tiger</HI> by the Portuguese, is extremely
rare.</P>
<P>The royal tiger, therefore, appears not to be a
different species. He is found in the East Indies
only, and not in Brasil, as has been alledged by
some of our naturalists<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Regn. anim. Brisson. p. 269.</NOTE>. I am even inclined
to believe, that the true tiger is peculiar to Asia,
and the interior parts of the south of Africa;
for, though most travellers who have visited the
coasts of Africa mention tigers, yet it is easy to
<PB N="164" REF="188"/>
perceive, from their descriptions, that they are
not genuine tigers, but leopards, panthers, ounces,
&amp;c. Doctor Shaw remarks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels. par Dapper, p. 206.</NOTE>, that, in the
kingdoms of Tunis and Algiers, the lion and
panther hold the first rank among the rapacious
animals; but that the tiger is not found in this
part of Barbary. Doctor Shaw's observation
seems to be just; for they were Indian, not Afri∣can
ambassadors<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Descript. des Isles de l'Archipel.</NOTE>, who presented to Augustus,
when at Samos, the first tiger that was ever seen
by the Romans. It was also from India that
Heliogabalus procured those tigers with which
he wished to have his chariot drawn, when he
wanted to personate the god Bacchus.</P>
<P>Thus the species of the tiger has always been
more rare and less diffused than that of the lion.
The female, however, like the lioness, produces
four or five cubs at a litter. She is furious at
all times; but her rage rises to the utmost extre∣mity,
when robbed of her young. She then
braves every danger; she pursues the plunderers,
who are often obliged to release one, in order to
retard her motion. She stops, takes it up, and
carries it off to the nearest cover; but she in∣stantly
returns, and continues the pursuit after
the spoilders to the very gates of their villages, or
to their boats. When all hope of recovering
them is lost, she expresses the exquisiteness of
<PB N="165" REF="189"/>
her sorrow by dismal and hideous howlings,
which excite terror wherever they reach.</P>
<P>The tiger, like the lion, moves the skin of his
face, grinds his teeth, and roars; but the sound
of his voice, which has, by some travellers, been
compared to that of certain large birds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Second voyage de Siam, par le P. Tachard, p. 248.</NOTE>, is diffe∣rent.
<HI>Tigrides indomitae rancant, rugiuntque

of a hoarse and frightful cry<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The tigers of the eastern regions of Asia are remark∣ably large and swift. Their general colour is a reddish yel∣low. Their roar, like that of the lion, raises horror in the hearer; <HI>Voyage de Coreal, tom. 1. p.</HI> 173.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The skin of these animals is much esteemed,
especially in China. The military mandarines,
in their public marches, cover their sedans, and
likewise their pillows, during the winter, with
tigers skins. In Europe, these skins, though
rare, are not much valued. Those of the leo∣pard
of Guiney and Senegal, called <HI>tigers skins</HI>
by our furriers, are preferred. Besides, the skin
is the only use that can be derived from this
most noxious of all quadrupeds. His sweat<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. de Siam, par Gervaise, p. 36.</NOTE>,
and the hair of his whiskers<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">La Chine illustrée, par Kircher, p. 110.</NOTE>, are alledged to
be certain poisons to man and other animals.
But he does so much real mischief when alive,
that it is needless to ascribe imaginary evils to
<PB N="166" REF="190"/>
his remains; for the Indians eat his flesh, and
find it neither unwholesome nor disagreeable;
and, if a pill composed of his whiskers is mor∣tal,
this effect is produced by the sharpness and
roughness of the hair, which acts on the sto∣mach
in the same manner as small needles.</P>

<P>TO remove all ambiguities arising from the
use of improper names, or other causes,
let it be remarked, that, beside the tigers, whose
history and description I have just given, Asia
and Africa afford other three species of this
genus, all different from the tiger, and from
each other. These three species are the <HI>Pan∣ther,</HI>

The basis of the colour upon the back and sides
is of a more or less deep yellow, and that of the
belly is whitish. He is marked with black spots,
which are circular, or in the form of a rose, de∣tached
from each other upon the sides, hollow
in the middle, and most of them have several
lesser spots, in their center, of the same colour.
These spots, of which some are oblong, and o∣thers
circular, are frequently three inches in dia∣meter.
The spots on the head, breast, belly, and
legs, are entire.</P>
<P>The second species is the little panther of Op∣pian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oppian de venatione, lib. 3.</NOTE>,
to which the antients have assigned no
particular name; but modern travellers have
called it <HI>Ounce,</HI> from the corrupted term <HI>Lynx</HI> or
<HI>Lunx.</HI> We shall adopt the name <HI>Ounce,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The ounce has a large head, short ears, and long hair on the whole body, of a whitish ash-colour, tinged with yellow, which is fainter in the breast and belly. It is marked with small round spots. There is a large black spot behind each <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar. The upper part of the neck is varied with large single sports; the sides of the back with longitudinal marks, consist∣ing of several spots almost touching each other, leaving the ground colour of the body in the middle. The spots beneath these are irregular, large, and full. Those on the legs are small, and thinly dispersed. The tail is full of hair, and ir∣regularly marked with large black spots. This species is of a strong make, being long backed, and short legged. The length from the nose to the tail is about three feet and a half, and that of the tail is upwards of three feet; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad. p.</HI> 175.</NOTE>, be∣cause
<PB N="169" REF="194"/>
the animal has some affinity to the lynx.
The ounce is much smaller than the panther, be∣ing
only about three feet and a half long, which
is nearly the size of the lynx. The length of
the hair exceeds that of the panther, as well as
that of the tail, which is sometimes more than
three feet in length, though the body of the
ounce is, upon the whole, one third less than that
of the panther, whose tail is only about two
feet and a half. The ground colour of the ounce
is a whitish gray upon the back and sides, and
the gray is still whither on the belly. But the
back and sides of the panther are always of a
more or less deep yellow colour. The spots
are nearly of the same figure and size in the
one as in the other.</P>
<P>The third species is peculiar to Senegal, Guiney,
and other southern regions, which had not been
discovered by the antients; and, of course, they
had no knowledge of this animal, which we
shall call the <HI>Leopard,</HI> a name that has been im∣properly
<PB N="170" REF="195"/>
applied to the great panther. The leo∣pard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hair of the leopard is of a lively yellow colour, marked on the back and sides with small spots, disposed in circles, and placed pretty closely together. The face and legs are mark∣ed with single spots. The breast and belly are covered with longer hairs than the rest of the body, of a whitish colour. The spots on the tail are large and oblong. The length of this species, from nose to tail, is four feet, and that of the tail two and a half.</NOTE>
is larger than the ounce, but much less
than the panther, seldom exceeding four feet in
length. The tail is two or two and a half feet
long. The ground colour of the hair, upon the
back and sides, is yellow; that of the belly is
whitish. The spots are annular, or like roses,
but much smaller than those of the panther and
ounce, and most of them are composed of four
or five small full spots: Some of the latter are
irregularly disposed.</P>
<P>These three species, as we have seen, are per∣fectly
distinct. The merchants call the skins of
the first species, <HI>panther skins,</HI> those of the se∣cond,
which we have denominated the <HI>ounce, A∣frican
tigers skins,</HI> and those of the third, or leo∣pard,
though very improperly, <HI>tigers skins.</HI></P>
<P>Oppian<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Oppianus de venatione, lib. 3.</NOTE> was acquainted with the panther
and ounce; of the former he remarks, that there
were two kinds, the one large and the other
small, though the form of their bodies, and the
disposition of the spots, were similar; but that
they are different in the length of their tail,
<PB N="171" REF="196"/>
which was longer in the small than in the large
species. The Arabs call the great panther <HI>Nemer,</HI>
and the smaller kind <HI>Phet</HI> or <HI>Phed,</HI> which last,
though a little corrupted, is the same with <HI>Faadh,</HI>
and is the real Barbary name of this animal.
“The Faadh,” says Dr Shaw<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels. <HI>Nota.</HI> The English <HI>a</HI> is pronounced like the French <HI>ai,</HI> which brings Dr Shaw's Faadh, pronounced <HI>Faidh,</HI> still nearer to the <HI>Fhed.</HI></NOTE>, “resembles the
leopard, (he means the panther), by having the
same spots; but they differ in other respects;
for the skin of the former is darker and coarser,
and he is not so ferocious as the latter.” Be∣sides,
we learn from a passage of Albert, com∣mented
upon by Gesner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner. hist. quad. p. 825.</NOTE>, that the <HI>Phet</HI> or <HI>Phed</HI>
of the Arabs, is denoted, in Italian, and some o∣ther
European languages, by the word <HI>Leunza</HI>
or <HI>Lonza.</HI> Hence it is evident, that the small
panther of Oppian, and the Arabian <HI>Phet</HI> or
<HI>Phed</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alphed,</HI> id est, leopardus minor; <HI>Albertus.</HI></NOTE>, the Barbary <HI>Faadh,</HI> and the European
<HI>Onze</HI> or <HI>Ounce,</HI> are the same animal, which is also
probably the <HI>Pard</HI> or <HI>Pardus</HI> of the antients,
and the <HI>Panthera</HI> of Pliny; for he says, that
the ground colour of the panther<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Pantheris in <HI>candido</HI> breves macularum oculi; <HI>Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 18.</NOTE> was white,
but that of the great panther, as formerly ob∣served,
is yellow. It is, besides, probable, that
the small panther was called simply <HI>Pard</HI> or
<HI>Pardus,</HI> and that they afterwards named the large
<PB N="172" REF="197"/>
panther <HI>Leopard,</HI> or <HI>Leopardus;</HI> because they i∣magined
it was a mongrel species, increased in
size by mixing with that of the lion. But, as
there is no foundation for this fancy, we have
preferred the simple and primitive name <HI>pan∣ther,</HI>
to the modern compound one, <HI>Leopard,</HI>
which last we have applied to a new animal, that
has hitherto been mentioned under equivocal ap∣pellations
only.</P>
<P>Thus the ounce differs from the panther by
being smaller, having a longer tail, and also
longer hair, and a whitish gray colour; and
the leopard differs from both the panther and
ounce, by his brilliant yellow robe, though more
or less deep, by the smallness of his spots, and
by their being disposed in groups, as if each of
them were formed by the union of four or five.</P>
<P>Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plinii Hist. Nat. lib. 8. cap. 18.</NOTE>, and several posterior authors, say,
that the robe of the female panther was whiter
than that of the male. This may be true of
the ounce: But we have observed no such di∣stinction
in the panthers kept at Versailles, which
were drawn from the life. Hence, if there is
any difference between the male and female, it
can neither be constant nor sensible. We have
indeed perceived shades, more or less strong,
in some skins of these animals; but it is pro∣bable
that this difference depends more on the
difference of age or of climate than upon that of
the sexes.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="198"/>
The animals described and dissected by the
gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoires pour servir a l'histoire des animaux, part 3. p. 3.</NOTE>, under
the name of <HI>Tigers,</HI> and that described by Caius<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gesner. Hist. quad. p. 825.</NOTE>,
in Gesner, under the name of <HI>Uncia,</HI> are of the
same species with our leopard. Of this not a
doubt can remain, after comparing our figure
and description with those of Caius and M. Per∣rault.
The latter, indeed, says, that the animals
described and dissected by the gentlemen of the
Academy under the appellation of <HI>tigers,</HI> were
not the ounce of Caius. But the only reasons he
gives are, that the ounce is smaller, and is not
white under the belly. However, if M. Per∣rault
had compared the description of Caius with
the subjects he examined, I am persuaded that
he would have perceived no difference between
them and the ounce of Caius. But, as some
doubts may still remain, I shall here relate the
most essential parts of Caius's description, which,
though made upon a dead animal, appears to be
very exact<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Uncia fera est saevissima, canis villatici magnitudine, facie et aure leonina: corpore, cauda, pede, et ungue felis, aspectu truci: dente tam robusto et acuto, ut vel ligna divi∣dat: ungue ita pollet, ut eodem contra nitentes in adversum retineat; colore per summa corporis pallescentis ochrae, per ima cineris, asperso undique macula nigra et frequenti, cauda reliquo corpore aliquanto obscuriori et grandiori macula.

Hist. quadrup. pag. 825. et</HI> 826.</NOTE>. It may be remarked, that Caius,
<PB N="174" REF="199"/>
without giving the precise dimensions of the a∣nimal's
body, says, that it is larger than the shep∣herd's
dog, and as thick, though it be shorter, as
the bull-dog: I cannot conceive, therefore, how
M. Perrault should have said, that the ounce of
Caius was much smaller than the tigers dissected
by the gentlemen of the Academy. These a∣nimals,
from the extremity of the muzzle, to
the origin of the tail, measured only four feet
in length. The leopard which we have descri∣bed,
<PB N="175" REF="200"/>
and which is unquestionably the same ani∣mal
with the tigers of M. Perrault, was like∣wise
about four feet long; and, if we measure
a bull-dog, and particularly a mastiff, we will
find that he often exceeds these dimensions.
Thus the tigers described by the gentlemen of
the Academy differ not so much in size from the
ounce of Caius, as to justify M. Perrault's conclu∣sion,
that they were not the same animal. The
second difference is that of the colour of the
hair on the belly, which M Perrault says is
white, and Caius ash-coloured, that is, whitish.
Hence these two characters, which induced M.
Perrault to think that the tigers dissected by the
gentlemen of the Academy were not the ounce
of Caius, should have led him to the oppo∣site
conclusion, especially if he had attended to
the rest of the description, which perfectly a∣grees.
We must, therefore, regard the tigers
of the gentlemen of the Academy, the ounce of
Caius, and our leopard, as the same animal;
and I cannot conceive how some naturalists
should have mistaken M. Perrault's tigers for
American animals, and confounded them with
the jaguar.</P>
<P>I consider it, therefore, as certain, that the ti∣gers
of Perrault, the uncia of Caius, and our leo∣pard,
are the same animal, and that our panther
is the same with the panther of the antients; for,
excepting in the size, our panther agrees with
the antient in every other character; and this in∣considerable
<PB N="176" REF="201"/>
difference may be safely ascribed to
confinement and want of exercise. This diffe∣rence
of dimensions at first perplexed me. But,
after a minute comparison between the large
skins sold by the furriers with that of our pan∣ther,
there could be no longer hesitation that
they were the very same creatures. The panther
we have described, as well as other two of the
same species, kept at Versailles, came from Bar∣bary:
The two first were presented to his Ma∣jesty
by the regency of Algiers, about twelve
years ago; and the third was purchased by the
King from an Algerine Jew.</P>
<P>Another remark must be made. Of the three
animals above described under the appellation of
the <HI>panther,</HI> the <HI>ounce,</HI> and the <HI>leopard,</HI> not a
single one can be referred to the animal which
naturalists have indicated by the name of <HI>pardus,</HI>
or <HI>leopardus.</HI> The <HI>pardus</HI> of Linnaeus, and the
<HI>leopard</HI> of Brisson, which appear to be the same
animal, are designed in the following manner:
<HI>Pardus, felis cauda elongata, corporis maculis su∣perioribus
orbiculatis, inferioribus virgatis;</HI> Syst.
Nat. p. 61. <HI>Leopardus, felis ex albo flavicans,
maculis nigris in dorso orbiculatis, in ventre lon∣gis,
variegata;</HI> Regn. anim. p. 272. This cha∣racter,
of long spots on the inferior parts of the
body, belongs neither to the panther, the ounce,
nor the leopard; and yet it is the panther of the
antients, the <HI>panthera, pardalis, pardus, leopardus</HI>
of Gesner, the <HI>pardus, panthera</HI> of Prosper Alpi∣nus;
<PB N="177" REF="202"/>
in a word, the panther found in Africa
and the East-Indies, which these authors mean
to point out by the above definitions. From the
accurate researches I have made, I am perfectly
satisfied that these three animals, and, perhaps, a
fourth, to be afterwards mentioned, which like∣wise
has not this character of long spots on the
belly, are the only species of this genus to be
found in Asia or Africa. We must, therefore,
hold this character of our nomenclators to be
fictitious; for, in all the animals of this kind,
both in the Old and New Continent, when they
have long spots, these spots are uniformly situa∣ted
on the superior parts of the body, as the neck
and back, and never on the inferior parts.</P>
<P>I must again remark, that the animal described
in the third part of the <HI>Memoires pour servir a
l'histoire des animaux, p.</HI> 3. is neither the pan∣ther,
the ounce, nor the leopard, of which I am
here treating.</P>
<P>In fine, when perusing the writings of the an∣tients,
the <HI>panther</HI> should not be confounded
with the <HI>panthera.</HI> The <HI>panthera</HI> is the animal
we have described; but the <HI>panther</HI> of Homer
and other authors, is a kind of timid wolf, per∣haps
the jackal, as shall be explained in the hi∣story
of that animal. Besides, the word <HI>pardalis</HI>
is the antient Greek name of the true panther,
and is applied indiscriminately to both male and
female. The word <HI>pardus</HI> is more modern, be∣ing
first used by Lucan and Pliny. <HI>Leopardus</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="203"/>
is still less antient; for it appears to have been
first employed by Julius Capitolinus: And <HI>pan∣thera</HI>
was derived from the Greek by the antient
Latins, but never used by the Greeks themselves.</P>
<P>After dispelling the darkness with which no∣menclators
perpetually obscure Nature, after re∣moving
every source of ambiguity, by giving ex∣act
figures of the three animals of which we are
treating, we shall now proceed to remark what
is peculiar to each of them.</P>
<P>The panther, which we have examined alive,
has a ferocious air, a restless eye, a cruel aspect,
brisk movements, and a cry similar to that of an
enraged dog, but stronger and more hoarse. He
has a rough and very red tongue, strong and
pointed teeth, hard sharp claws, a beautiful skin,
of a more or less deep yellow colour, variegated
with black circular spots, or united in the form
of roses, and short hair. The upper part of the
tail is marked with large black spots, and with
rings of black and white toward the extremity.
He is of the size and make of a mastiff dog, only
his legs are not so long.</P>
<P>The relations of travellers agree with the te∣stimonies
of the antients, as to the large and
small panther, that is, our panther and ounce. It
appears, that there now exist, as in the days of
Oppian, in that part of Africa which extends a∣long
the Mediterranean, and in those parts of
Asia that were known to the antients, two spe∣cies
of panthers, and most travellers have called
<PB N="179" REF="204"/>
the larger the <HI>panther</HI> or <HI>leopard,</HI> and the smaller
the <HI>ounce.</HI> They all agree, that the ounce is easily
tamed, that he is trained to hunting, and em∣ployed
for this purpose in Persia, and several o∣ther
provinces of Asia; that some ounces are so
small, that a horseman carries them on the crup∣per
behind him, and that they are so gentle as to
admit of being handled and caressed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Persians have a quadruped called the <HI>ounce,</HI> whose skin is spotted like that of a tiger, but which is very tame and gentle. A horseman carries it on a truss behind him; and, when he perceives an antelope, he makes the ounce descend, which is so nimble, that, in three bounds, it leaps on the neck of the antelope, though the latter runs with incredible swiftness. The antelope is a small species of roe-deer, which are very nume∣rous in this country. The ounce soon kills the antelope with his sharp teeth. But, if he misses his blow, and the antelope escapes, he remains fixed on the spot, in a confused and mortified condition. In these moments of distress and disappointment, an infant may apprehend him, without the least resistance; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 2. p.</HI> 26.</P>
<P>In great hunting matches, the Persians train ferocious animals to the chace, as lions, tigers, leopards, panthers, and ounces; the latter of which are called <HI>youzze.</HI> They do no injury to man. A horseman carries one behind him, with its eyes covered by a cloth, and fixed by a chain. When the hunter perceives any game, he uncovers the animal's eyes, and turns his head to the prey. If he spies it, he darts upon it with great bounds, throws himself upon it, and brings it to the ground. If, after making a few leaps, he misses his object, he is discouraged, and common∣ly stops. The hunter takes him up, and consoles him with ca∣resses.—I saw, in the year 1666, this kind of hunting in Hyr∣cania.—Some of these trained animals hunt with great dexterity, creeping on their bellies through hedges and brush∣wood till they are near their prey, and then darting upon them; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee Voyage de Chardin en Perse, &amp;c. tom. 2. p. 32.

This panther was an ounce; for the author likewise says, that, in Persia, they use the ounce or panther for hunting antelopes; that these animals were brought from Arabia; and that they were so tame as to be carried on the crupper of a horse.</P></NOTE>. The
<PB N="180" REF="205"/>
panther seems to be of a more fierce and untrac∣table
nature. Man may be said rather to subdue
than to tame him. He never loses entirely his
ferocious disposition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tigres ex Ethiopia in Aegyptum convectas vidimus, etsi nullo modo cicuratae hae mansuefiant, neque unquam ferinam naturam relinquant; sunt leaenis quam similes et forma et co∣lore albicante, rotundis maculis fulvescentibus evariatae, sed leaenis longe majores sunt; <HI>Prosp. Alp. hist. Aegypt. p.</HI> 237.—When the hunter discovers the antelopes, he endeavours to show them to the leopard, which is chained upon a small cart. This cunning animal does not instantly run at them, as might be imagined, but winds about, creeping and concealing himself in order to approach and surprise them; and, as he is capable of making five or six springs with incredible rapidity, when he has advanced near enough, he darts upon them, strangles them in an instant, and gluts himself with their blood, their heart, and their liver. But, if he misses his aim, which sometimes happens, he stands still, and never attempts to pursue them, which would be in vain; for they run much swifter and longer than he is able. His master then approaches him gently, flattering and amusing him with pieces of flesh, till he throws a cover over his eyes, puts on his chain, and conducts him back to the cart; <HI>Voyage de Bernier, dans le Mogol. tom. 2. p.</HI> 243. This description can only apply to the large panther; because no such precautions are necessary with the ounce.</NOTE>; and, when destined for
<PB N="181" REF="206"/>
the chace, great attention is necessary in training
him, and still greater caution is requisite in con∣ducting
and exercising him. He is led in a cart,
shut up in a cage, the door of which is opened
when game appears. He springs toward the
animal, and generally, at three or four bounds,
seizes and strangles it; but, if he misses his blow,
he becomes furious, and sometimes attacks his
master, who commonly prevents this hazard,
by carrying along with him pieces of flesh, or
live animals, as lambs, or kids, one of which he
throws to him to appease his rage.</P>
<P>The species of the ounce seems to be more nu∣merous
and more diffused than that of the pan∣ther.
<PB N="182" REF="207"/>
Ounces are very common in Barbary, A∣rabia,
and all the southern parts of Asia, Egypt,
perhaps, excepted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are no lions, tigers, or leopards, in Egypt; <HI>De∣script. de l'Egypte, par Mascrier. tom. 2. p.</HI> 125.</NOTE>. They even extend as far
as China, where they are called <HI>hinen-pao</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hinen-pao</HI> is a kind of leopard or panther found in the province of Pekin. He is not so ferocious as the tiger, and the Chinese are very fond of him; <HI>Relation de la Chine, par Thevenot,</HI> p. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ounce is used for hunting in the warm
climates of Asia; because dogs are very scarce in
these countries<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As the Moors at Surat, and on the Malabar coasts, have no dogs to hunt the antelopes and fallow-deer, they endea∣vour to supply this defect, by taming and training leopards. These animals attack their prey with great address, and, after seizing it, they never quit, but remain firmly fixed upon it; <HI>Voyage de Jean Ovington, tom. 1. p.</HI> 278.</NOTE>, having hardly any but what
are transported thither, and even these lose, in a
short time, their voice and their instinct. Be∣sides,
the panther, the ounce, and the leopard,
have such an antipathy to dogs, that they attack
them preferably to all other animals<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The leopards are mortal enemies to the dogs, and devour them as often as they meet with them; <HI>Voyage de la Maire, p.</HI> 99.</NOTE>. In Eu∣rope,
our hunting dogs have no enemy but the
wolf. But, in countries filled with tigers, lions,
panthers, leopards, and ounces, which are all
stronger and more cruel than the wolf, it is im∣possible
to preserve dogs. The scent of the ounce
is not near so fine as that of the dog. He nei∣ther
follows animals by their foot, nor is he able
<PB N="183" REF="208"/>
to overtake them in a continued chace. He
hunts solely by the eye, and makes only a few
springs at his prey. He is so nimble, that he
easily clears a ditch or a wall of many feet.
He often climbs trees to watch passing animals,
and suddenly darts down upon them. This
mode of seizing prey is common to the panther,
the leopard, and the ounce.</P>
<P>The manners and dispositions of the leopard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Guiney leopard is generally of the size and stature of a large bull-dog. He is very ferocious and incapable of being tamed. He attacks with fury every kind of animal, man not excepted. Neither the tigers nor lions of the Guiney coast do any injury to man, unless they are extremely pressed with hunger. The leopard partakes something of the lion and something of the large wild cat. His skin is all marked with round spots of different shades of blackness upon a gray∣ish ground. His head is of a middle size, his mouth is large, and well armed with teeth, of which the women of that coun∣try make necklaces. His tongue is equally rough as that of the lion. His eyes are fiery, and continually in motion. His aspect in cruel, and indicates a perpetual thirst for blood. His ears are round, short, and always erect. He has a thick short neck, strong thighs, large feet, five toes on the fore and four on the hind feet, both armed with strong sharp claws, which he shuts like the fingers of a hand, and never looses them from his prey till he has torn it in pieces, both with his claws and teeth. Though very rapacious and gluttonous, he is always meagre. The leopards multiply very fast; but the tigre, who is stronger and more alert, is their deadly foe, and destroys great numbers of them. The Negroes take the ti∣ger, the leopard, and the lion, by means of deep pits covered with reeds and a little earth, upon which they place some dead animal as a bait. <HI>Voyage de Desmarchais, tom. 1. p.</HI> 202.—The tiger of Senegal is more furious than the lion. He is nearly about the length and height of a grey-hound. He attacks, indiscriminately, man and all other animals. The Negroes kill him with their darts and arrows, in order to procure their skins. Though their bodies be pierced in ma∣ny places, they defend themselves to the last drop of their blood, and often destroy some of the assailants; <HI>Voyage de la Maire, p.</HI> 99.</NOTE>

<PB N="184" REF="209"/>
learn not that he has ever been tamed like the
ounce, or that the Negroes of Senegal or Guiney,
where he is very common, ever use him for
hunting. He is generally larger than the ounce
and smaller than the panther. His tail, though
two or two and a half feet long, is shorter than
that of the ounce.</P>
<P>The leopard of Senegal and Guiney, to which
we have particularly applied the name of <HI>leopard,</HI>
is probably the animal called <HI>Engoi</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tigers of Congo are called <HI>Engoi; Drake's Voyages,</HI> p. 105. <HI>Recueil des voyages qui out servi à l'etablissement de la compagnie des Indes, tom.</HI> 4. p. 326.</NOTE> at Congo,
and perhaps also the <HI>Antamba</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Madagascar antamba is an animal as large as a dog, with a round head, and, according to the relations of the Negroes, resembling the leopard.

We mention these names, because it would in∣crease
our knowledge of animals, if we had lists
of the names given them in the language of the
countries they inhabit.</P>
<P>The species of the leopard appears to be sub∣ject
to greater varieties than that of the panther
or ounce. We have examined a great number of
leopard's skins, which differed from each other,
<PB N="185" REF="210"/>
either in the shades of the ground-colour, or in
those of the annular spots, some of which were
more distinctly defined than others. But these
rings are always smaller than those of the pan∣ther
or ounce. In all leopards skins, the spots
are nearly of the same size and figure; and their
chief difference consists in the deepness or light∣ness
of their colours. The ground-colour of the
skin differs only in being of a more or less deep
yellow. But, as all these skins are nearly of the
same size, both in the body and tail, it is pro∣bable
that they belong to the same species of
animal.</P>
<P>The panther, the ounce, and the leopard, inha∣bit
Africa, and the warmest climates of Asia only.
They have never spread over the northern, or
even the temperate regions. Aristotle mentions
the panther as an African and Asiatic animal,
and says expressly, that it existed not in Europe.
Hence these animals, which seem to be confined
to the Torrid Zone of the Old Continent, could
never pass over to the New by the northern lands;
and we shall find, by the descriptions we are to
give of the American animals of this genus, that
they are different species, and ought not to be
confounded, as most of our nomenclators have
done, with those of Asia or Africa.</P>
<P>These animals, in general, delight in the thick∣est
forests, and often frequent the banks of rivers,
and the environs of sequestrated habitations,
where they endeavour to surprise domestic ani∣mals,
<PB N="186" REF="211"/>
and the wild beasts which come to the ri∣vers
in quest of water. They seldom attack
men, even when provoked. They climb trees
with great ease, where they pursue cats, and o∣ther
animals, which seldom escape them. Though
they live solely on prey, and are commonly
meagre, travellers pretend that their flesh is not
bad to eat. It is, indeed, eaten by the Indians
and Negroes; but they prefer the flesh of the
dog, which they consider as the most delicious
food. With regard to their skins, they are all
valuable, and make excellent furs. The most
beautiful and dearest is that of the leopard, one
of which, when the yellow is bright, and the
spots very black and well defined, costs eight or
ten louis-d'ors.</P>

<P>THE jaguar resembles the ounce in size of
body, in the figure of most of the spots,
and even in dispositions. He is not so bold as
the leopard or panther. Like the leopard, the
<PB N="188" REF="217"/>
ground-colour of his hair is a beautiful yellow, and
not gray like the ounce. His tail is shorter than
that of either of these animals: His hair is long∣er
than that of the panther, and shorter than that
of the ounce: It is crisped when young, and
smooth when he arrives at full growth. We
have never seen this animal alive; but had one
sent us well preserved in spirits; and it is from
this subject that our figure and description have
been taken. It had been taken young, and
brought up in the house till it was two years old,
when it was killed, in order to be transmitted to
us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This animal was sent to us by M. Pagés, King's physi∣cian at St Domingo, under the name of <HI>Chat-tigre.</HI> M. Pagés remarks, in his letter, that this animal was brought from the Continent, where it is very common, to St Domingo, in a Spanish vessel. He adds, that it was two years of age when he ordered it to be killed; that it had swelled in the spirits; that it eat, drank, and uttered the same cry as the wild cat; and that it mewed, and preferred fish to flesh: Piso and Marcgrave likewise tell us, that the jaguars of Bra∣sil are very fond of fish. The chat-tigre, says Dampier, <HI>tom. 3. p.</HI> 306. which is very common in the Bay of Campeachy, has short legs, and a contracted body, like that of the mastiff; but, in the form of his head, the colour of his hair, and the manner of watching his prey, he resembles the tiger.</NOTE>. It had not, therefore, acquired its natural
dimensions. But, it was evident, from the bare
inspection of this animal, that, when full grown,
he could not exceed the size of an ordinary dog.
This animal, however, is the most formidable,
the most cruel, in a word, he is tiger of the
<PB N="189" REF="218"/>
New World, where Nature seems to have con∣tracted
every kind of quadruped. The jaguar
lives on prey like the tiger. But a light is
sufficient to make him fly; and, when his sto∣mach
is full, he so entirely loses all courage and
vivacity, that he runs before a single dog. He
is neither nimble nor active, but when pres∣sed
with hunger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are tigers at Brasil which, when agitated by fa∣mine, are very bold; but, after a full meal, they become so cowardly, that they instantly fly for fear of the dogs; <HI>De∣script. des Indes Orientales, par Herrera, p.</HI> 252. The same re∣mark is to be found in <HI>l'Hist. des Indes par Maffée, p.</HI> 69. There are tigers about Porto-bello, the environs of which are very woody and desert. These appear to be of a small species; for a single man, when the animal is about to attack him, of∣ten cuts off its paws one after another; <HI>Voyage de Dom Juan et Dom Antoine de Ulloa; Extrait de la Bibliotheque raisonné, tom. 44. p.</HI> 413.</NOTE>. The savages, who are
naturally poltroons, are afraid to encounter
him. They alledge, that he prefers them to the
Europeans, whom he never attacks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have heard that these tigers had an antipathy against the Indians; that they seldom or never attack the Spaniards; and that they sometimes pick out and carry off an Indian when sleeping in the midst of Spaniards; <HI>Hist.

is likewise said to prefer the Blacks to the
Whites<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the province of Bamba, in the kingdom of Congo, there are tigers which never attack white men, but often rush upon the Negroes: When a Negro and a white man are sleeping near each other, these animals run with fury upon the Negro, without injuring the white; <HI>Drake's Voyage round the world, p.</HI> 105.</NOTE>, whom he is supposed to distinguish by

well as the day.</P>
<P>Almost all the authors who have written the
history of the New World mention this animal;
some under the name of the <HI>tiger</HI> or <HI>leopard,</HI>
others under the names given him in Brasil,
Mexico, &amp;c. Piso and Marcgrave, who first
described him fully, called him <HI>jaguara,</HI> instead
of <HI>janouara,</HI> his Brasilian name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Brasil there is a rapacious animal which the savages call <HI>janou-ara,</HI> and has limbs nearly as high as those of the greyhound; but he has great whiskers, a beautiful skin, varie∣gated like that of the ounce, whom he very much resembles in every other respect; <HI>Voyage de Jean de Lery, p.</HI> 162.—The janouar is a kind of ounce, as large as an English bull-dog, with a fine spotted skin; <HI>Mission des Capuci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, par le Père d' Ab∣levi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, p.</HI> 251.—The janouara of Brasil lives only on prey. He is of the stature of a greyhound, and his skin is spotted; <HI>Voyage de Coreal, tom. 1. p.</HI> 173.</NOTE>. They have
also mentioned another animal of the same ge∣nus,
and perhaps of the same species, under the
name of <HI>jaguarette.</HI> Like these two authors,
we have distinguished the jaguar from the ja∣guarette;
because they appear to be animals of a
different species. However, as we have only
seen one of these animals, we cannot determine
whether they are two distinct species, or a varie∣ty
of the same species. Piso and Marcgrave re∣mark,
that the jaguarette is distinguished from
the jaguar by having shorter, more bright, and
differently coloured hair, which is black, varie∣gated
with spots of a still deeper black. But, in
every other particular, he resembles the jaguar
<PB N="191" REF="220"/>
so strongly in the figure of his body, manners,
and temper, that he may still be only a variety
of the same species; especially as Piso informs us,
that, in the jaguar, the ground-colour of the
hair, and that of the spots, vary in different in∣dividuals
of this species. He says, that some
are marked with black, and others with red or
yellow spots: And, with regard to the difference
of gray, yellow, or black colours, the same thing
takes place in other species of animals. There
are black wolves, black foxes, black squirrels,
&amp;c. If such variations are rarer among wild
than domestic animals, the phaenomenon must
be ascribed to the former being liable to fewer
accidents which can produce such changes. As
the life of the former is more uniform, their
food less various, and their liberty greater than
those of the latter, their nature must likewise be
more constant, or less subject to accidental alte∣rations
in colour.</P>

<P>We here give a figure of an animal, which
belongs to the species of the leopard, or jaguar.
The drawing was communicated by the deceased
Mr Colinson, without either name or history.
As we are ignorant whether it is a native of the
Old or New Continent, and as it differs from the
ounce and leopard by the form of its spots, and
still more from the jaguar and ocelot, we could
not determine to which of these animals it may
be referred. It appears, however, to have a
greater relation to the jaguar than to the leo∣pard.</P>

<HEAD>The JAGUAR of NEW SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>In the month of June 1775, a female jaguar
was sent to M. Le Brun from New Spain. It
was very young; for all its teeth had not yet
appeared, and it has since grown larger at Chail∣lot,
where M. de Seve made a drawing of it in
the beginning of October. We reckon it to be
about nine or ten months old. His length, from
the muzzle to the anus, was one foot eleven
inches, and the height of its hind train from
thirteen to fourteen inches. The jaguar described
in the original work, was two feet five inches four
lines long, and the height of the hind train one
foot four inches nine lines: But it was two years
of age. Though belonging to different countries,
there is a great similarity between these two ani∣mals.
The differences in the form of the spots seem
to be only individual varieties. The iris is of a
brown colour inclining to green; the edges of
the eyes are black, with a white band both above
and below. The colour of the head is yellow
blended with gray, which is also the ground-co∣lour
of the spots; and the latter are bordered
with black bands. These spots and bands are
grounded on a dirty reddish white colour, in∣clining
more or less to gray. The ears are
black, with a very large white spot on their ex∣ternal
part. The tail is long, and well covered
with hair.</P>

<HEAD>The JAGUAR of GUIANA.</HEAD>
<P>M. Sonini de Manoncour has made some ex∣cellent
remarks on the jaguars of Guiana, which
I shall here transcribe.</P>
<P>“The hair of the young jaguar,” says he, “is
not crisped, as M. de Buffon alledges. I have
seen young jaguars with hair as smooth as that
of adults. This observation has been confirm∣ed
by the most experienced hunters. With
regard to their size, instead of only equalling,
as M. de Buffon remarks, that of an ordinary
dog, I have had two skins, which I was assured
belonged to subjects of two or three years old,
and one of them measured near five feet from
the muzzle to the tail, which was two feet
long. I have myself seen, in the forests of
Guiana, tracks of these animals, which induced
me, as well as M. de la Condamine, to think,
that the American animals called tigers were
as large as those of Africa. I even think, that,
excepting the true, or royal tiger, the Ameri∣can
tiger is the largest animal to which this
appellation is given; since, according to M. de
Buffon, the panther, which is the largest of
these animals, exceeds not, when full grown,
five or six feet in length; and it is certain
that there are quadrupeds of this kind which
greatly surpass these dimensions. The colour
of the jaguar varies with age. When young,
<PB N="195" REF="224"/>
he is of a very deep yellow, approaching to red,
or even brown. This colour brightens in pro∣portion
as the animal increases in years.”</P>
<P>The jaguar is not that indolent animal he
has been represented by some travellers, whom
M. de Buffon has copied. Instead of being
afraid of dogs, he springs upon them wherever
he meets them. He makes great havock a∣mong
the flocks. Those which inhabit the de∣serts
of Guiana are even formidable to men.
In a journey I made through these great forests,
we were tormented two nights successively by
a jaguar, notwithstanding a large fire, which
was kept perpetually blazing. He roamed
continually round us; and we found it impos∣sible
to shoot him; for we no sooner aimed at
him than he disappeared in a moment, then re∣turned
on the other side, and in this manner
kept us in perpetual alarm. Notwithstanding
all our vigilance, we could never shoot him.
He continued these manoeuvres during two
complete nights. He returned on the third:
But, seemingly disgusted by not obtaining his
end, and perceiving that we had augmented
our fire, which he was afraid to approach too
near, he left us with dreadful howlings. His
cry, <HI>hou, hou,</HI> is somewhat plaintive, grave,
and strong, like that of the ox.”</P>
<P>“With regard to the supposed predilection of
the jaguar to the natives of the country, rather
than to the Negroes or Whites, I suspect
<PB N="196" REF="225"/>
strongly that it is fabulous. I found this no∣tion
established at Cayenne: But I travelled
along with savages through places where the
largest tigers are common, and never discover∣ed
that they entertained any remarkable degree
of terror at these animals. Like us, they su∣spended
their hammocks on trees, removed to
a certain distance from us, and contented them∣selves
with kindling a small fire, which fre∣quently
went out in the course of the night.
These savages, however, were inhabitants of
the interior parts of the country, and, conse∣quently,
knew the danger they had to appre∣hend.
I can assure you, that they took no
precautions, and appeared to be very little af∣fected,
though surrounded with these animals.”</P>
<P>Here I cannot help remarking, that this last
fact proves that these animals are not very dan∣gerous,
at least to men.</P>
<P>“The flesh of the jaguar is not good to eat.
He combats, with advantage, all the quadru∣peds
of the New Continent, who fly from him
with terror. The ant-eater, though he has no
teeth to defend himself, is the most cruel ene∣my
the jaguars have to encounter. As soon
as the jaguar attacks the ant-eater, it lies down
on its back, and seizes and suffocates him with
its long claws.”</P>

<P>THE couguar is as long, but not so thick as
the jaguar; his legs are also longer, and
he has more the shape of a greyhound. His
head is small, his tail long, and his hair of near∣ly
a uniform colour, being of a lively red, mixed
with a little tincture of black, especially on the
back. He has no spots, like those of the tiger,
the leopard, the ounce, and the panther. His
chin, throat, and all the inferior parts of his bo∣dy,
<PB N="198" REF="230"/>
are whitish. Though weaker, he is equally
ferocious, and, perhaps, more cruel than the ja∣guar.
He appears to be still more rapacious on
his prey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuguacu-arana, the red, or rather bay tiger, is the most insatiable and rapacious of all American animals; <HI>Barrère, Hist. de la France equinox. p.</HI> 166.</NOTE>; for he devours without tearing it in

by hunting and destroying them, they have gra∣dually
retired to a distance from the more culti∣vated

swift, and climb trees with greater facility, than
the jaguar. When gorged with prey, they are
both equally indolent and cowardly. They sel∣dom
attack men, unless they find them sleeping.
When men pass the night in the woods, the
kindling of a fire is sufficient to prevent the ap∣proach
of these animals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Indians on the banks of the Oroonoko in Guiana, kindle fires during the night to intimidate the tigers, who never approach as long as the fire burns; <HI>Hist.

shades of large forests. They conceal themselves
in the thickets, or even in a bushy tree, from
which they dart upon animals as they pass.
Though they live only on prey, and drink blood
oftener than water, their flesh is said to be very
good eating. Piso says, that it is as good as
veal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nec est, quod aliquis putet à Barbaris tantum expeti carnem horum rapacium animalium: Illae enim quae rufes∣centibus et flavescentibus maculis sunt, ab omnibus passim Europeis incolis, instar vitulinae, estimatur; <HI>Pison.

<HEAD>The COUGUAR of PENSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Jaguar, as well as the Couguar, inhabit
the warmest regions of South America. But
there is another species of Couguar (of which we
have given a figure) found in the temperate cli∣mates
of North America, as on the mountains of
Carolina, Georgia, Pensylvania, and the adjacent
provinces. The drawing of this couguar was
sent me from England by the late Mr Colinson,
with the following description: If it is exact, this
couguar must differ greatly from the common
kind.</P>
<P>“The Couguar of Pensylvania,” says Mr Co∣linson,
“differs much from the couguar of Cay∣enne,
(above described). His limbs are shorter,
<PB N="201" REF="233"/>
his body much longer, and his tail is also three
or four inches longer. But, in the colour of
the hair, and the form of the head and ears,
they have a perfect resemblance to each other.
The couguar of Pensylvania,” adds Mr Colinson,
“is an animal remarkable for thinness and length
of body, shortness of legs, and length of tail.
The length of the body, from the muzzle to the
anus, is five feet four inches; and that of the
tail is two feet six inches. The fore-legs are
one foot long, and the hind-legs one foot three
inches. The height of the body before is one
foot nine inches, and one foot ten inches behind.
The circumference of the thickest part of the
body is two feet three inches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Colinson's letter to M. de Buffon, April 30. 1763.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Mr Edwards, who, for skill in the art of draw∣ing,
and his knowledge of Natural history, me∣rits
the applauses of all lovers of science, sent me
some engravings which corresponded with the
drawing communicated by Mr Colinson.</P>

<HEAD>THE BLACK COUGUAR.</HEAD>
<P>M. de la BORDE, King's physician at Ca∣yenne,
informs me, that in the Continent there
are three species of rapacious animals; that the
first is the jaguar, which is called the <HI>tiger;</HI> that
<PB N="202" REF="234"/>
the second is the couguar, called the <HI>red tiger,</HI> on
account of the uniform redness of his hair; that
the jaguar is of the size of a large bull-dog, and
weighs about 200 pounds; that the couguar is
smaller, less dangerous, and not so frequent in
the neighbourhood of Cayenne as the jaguar;
and that both these animals take six years in ac∣quiring
their full growth. He adds, that there
is a third species in these countries, called the
<HI>black tiger,</HI> of which we have given a figure un∣der
the appellation of the <HI>black couguar.</HI></P>
<P>“The head,” says M. de la Borde, “is pretty
similar to that of the common couguar; but the
animal has long black hair, and likewise a long
tail, with strong whiskers. He weighs not a∣bove
forty pounds. The female brings forth
her young in the hollows of old trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To this description we shall add that given by Mr Pen∣nant, which is more accurate, though somewhat different from that communicated by M. de la Borde to M. de Buffon.</P>
<P>“<HI>Black tiger,</HI> or <HI>cat,</HI> with the head black, sides, fore part of the legs, and the tail, covered with short and very glossy hairs, of a dusky colour, sometimes spotted with black, but generally plain: Upper lips white: At the corner of the mouth a black spot: Long hairs above each eye, and long whiskers on the upper lip: Lower lip, throat, belly, and the inside of the legs, whitish, or very pale ash-colour: Paws white: Ears pointed: Grows to the size of a heiser of a year old: Has vast strength in its limbs.—Inhabits Brasil and Guiana: Is a cruel and fierce beast; much dreaded by the Indians; but happily is a scarce species;” <HI>Pennant's Synops. of qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. p.</HI> 180.</P>
<P>This description was taken from two black couguars which were shown in London some years ago.</P>”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="235"/>
This black couguar may be the same animal
which Piso and Marcgrave call the <HI>jaguarette,</HI> or
<HI>jaguar with black hair,</HI> and which no other tra∣veller
has mentioned under the name of <HI>jagua∣rette.</HI>
I only find, in a note of M. Sonini de
Manoncour, that the jaguarette is called the <HI>black
tiger</HI> at Cayenne, and that he is of a different
species from the jaguar, being smaller, and thin∣ner
in the body. This animal is fierce and ra∣pacious;
but he is very rare in the neighbour∣hood
of Cayenne.</P>
<P>“The jaguars and couguars,” continues M. de
la Borde, “are very common in all the lands
which border on the river of the Amazons, as far
as Saint Martha. Their skin is so tender as to
be easily pierced by the simple arrows of the
Indians. Besides, all these animals are not ab∣solutely
covetous of carnage; for a single prey
always satisfies them. They go generally a∣lone;
but, when the females are in season,
sometimes two or three of them are seen toge∣ther.”</P>
<P>“When pressed with hunger, they attack cows
and oxen. They spring upon the back of an
ox, fix the claws of their left foot upon his
neck, and, when he falls down, they tear him
in pieces; and, after opening his breast and belly
to glut themselves with blood, they trail por∣tions
of his flesh into the wood. They then
cover the remainder of the carcass with bran∣ches
of trees, and never remove to any great
<PB N="204" REF="236"/>
distance. But, as soon as the flesh begins to
corrupt, they eat no more of it. Sometimes they
conceal themselves in trees, and dart down up∣on
passing animals. They likewise follow the
flocks of wild hogs, and seize the stragglers.
But, if ever they allow themselves to be sur∣rounded
by these animals, they have no safety
but in a precipitate retreat.”</P>
<P>“But neither the jaguars nor couguars are ab∣solutely
ferocious: They never attack men, un∣less
when they feel themselves wounded. But
they despise the assaults of dogs, whom they
often seize in the very neighbourhood of houses.
When pursued by such a number of dogs as o∣bliges
them to fly, they take refuge in the trees.
These animals often roam about the margins of the
sea, and eat the eggs deposited there by the turtles.
They likewise eat <HI>caï mans,</HI> or alligators, lizards,
fishes, and sometimes the buds and tender leaves
of the Indian fig. They are excellent swim∣mers,
and traverse the largest rivers. In taking
the <HI>caïman,</HI> they lie down on their belly at the
edge of the river, strike the water to make a
noise, and attrack the attention of the <HI>caïman,</HI>
who soon approaches, and raises his head above
the water, upon which the jaguar instantly
makes his deadly spring, and, after killing the
animal, drags him off to a distance, in order to
devour him at his leisure.”</P>
<P>“The Indians say, that the jaguars decoy the
agouti by counterfeiting his cry; they likewise

say that they attract the caïman by a cry simi∣lar
to that of a young dog, or like that of a
man who coughs, which is still more difficult to
believe.”</P>
<P>“When these animals are in season, they set
up dreadful roarings, which are heard at a great
distance. They commonly bring forth but one
at a time, which they deposit in the large trunks
of corrupted trees. At Cayenne, they eat the
flesh of these animals, which, when young, is as
white as that of a rabbit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extract from observations sent from M. de la Borde to M. de Buffon in the year 1774.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The couguar, when brought into captivity, is
almost equally gentle as the other domestic ani∣mals.</P>
<P>“I have seen,” says the author of <HI>Les Recher∣ches
sur les Americains,</HI> “a living couguar at the
house of Ducos, a keeper of wild beasts; he was
as peaceable as a dog, and of greater size than
the largest kind of dogs. He stands high on his
legs, which renders him nimble and alert. His
canine teeth are very large, and conical. He
was neither disarmed nor muzzled; and he was
conducted by a leash.—He allowed himself to
be caressed with the hand. I have seen boys
mount him, and ride astraddle on his back.
The name of the <HI>paltroon tiger</HI> has been given
to him with propriety<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Defence des Recherches sur les Americains, p. 86.</NOTE>.”</P>

<HEAD>THE LYNX<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The lynx has a short tail, black at the end, pale yellow eyes, and long full hair under the chin. The hair on the body is long and soft, of a cinereous colour, tinged with red, and marked with dusky spots, more or less distinct in different subjects; in some they are hardly vissible. The belly is whi∣tish. The ears are erect, and tufted with long black hairs, which is the character of the different kinds of <HI>lynxes.</HI> The legs and feet are very thick and strong. The length of the skin of a Russian lynx, from nose to tail, was four feet six inches, and that of the tail only six inches. They sometimes vary in their colour.

<P>THE gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences
have given a very good description of the
Lynx, and have discussed, with much critical a∣cuteness,
<PB N="207" REF="243"/>
the facts and names relating to this a∣nimal
which occur in the writings of the an∣tients<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. pour servir. à l'histoire des animaux, part. 1. p. 127.</NOTE>.
They have shown, that the Lynx of
Aelian is the same animal which they have de∣scribed
and dissected, and they censure, with pro∣priety,
those who have mistaken it for the <HI>thos</HI>
of Aristotle. This discussion is intermixed with
remarks and reflections which are pertinent and
interesting. After clearing their ground with so
much address, we wish they had retained the
true name <HI>lynx,</HI> instead of substituting that of <HI>lu∣pus
cervarius.</HI> They appear likewise, after ma∣king
a proper distinction, with Oppian, of two
different species or races of the lynx, the one
large, which hunts and attacks the fallow deer
and the stag, and the other smaller, which hunts
the hare only, to have blended the two together,
namely, the spotted lynx, which is commonly
found in the northern countries, and the Levant
or Barbary lynx, whose hair is of a uniform co∣lour.
We have seen both these animals alive.
They resemble each other in many respects.
They have both two long black pencils of hair
on the tips of their ears. This character, under
which Aelian first pointed out the lynx, is pecu∣liar
to these two animals, and probably led the
gentlemen of the Academy to regard them as
constituting but one species. But, independent
of the difference of colour and spots of the hair,
<PB N="208" REF="244"/>
the following history and description will render
it extremely probable that they are distinct spe∣cies.</P>
<P>M. Klein says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein de quad. p. 77.</NOTE>, that the most beautiful lynx is
a native of Africa and Asia, and particularly of
Persia; that he saw one at Dresden that had been
brought from Africa, which was finely spotted,
and stood high on its limbs; that those of Eu∣rope,
especially of Prussia and the northern re∣gions,
are less handsome; that they have little
or no white, but are rather red, with blotched
and ill-defined spots, &amp;c. I choose not to deny
absolutely what M. Klein has here advanced.
I have never seen it mentioned, however, by
any other author, that the lynx is a native of
the warm countries of Asia and Africa. Kolbe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 63.</NOTE>
is the only writer who affirms, that the lynx is
common at the Cape of Good Hope, and perfectly
resembles that of Brandenburgh, and the north
of Europe. But I have discovered so many er∣rors
in the works of this author, that I give no
credit to his testimony, unless when it coincides
with that of others. Now, all travellers agree
in having seen the spotted lynx in the north of
Germany, in Lithuania, Muscovy, Siberia, Ca∣nada,
and other northern regions of both Con∣tinents.
But no author, whose writings I have
perused, asserts that the lynx is to be met with
in the warm regions of Africa or Asia. The
<PB N="209" REF="245"/>
lynx of the Levant, of Barbary, of Arabia, and
other hot climates, are, as formerly remarked, of
one uniform colour, without any spots: He is
not, therefore, the lynx of M. Klein, which was
sinely spotted, nor that of Kolbe, which perfect∣ly
resembled those of Bradenburgh. It would
be a difficult task to reconcile the evidence of
those authors with what we learn from other
sources. The lynx is unquestionably more com∣mon
in cold than in temperate climates, and he
is, at least, very rare in warm countries. He
was, indeed, known to the Greeks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Greeks, who, in their fictions, always preserved some appearance of truth, especially with regard to times and places, say, that it was a King of <HI>Scythia</HI> who was changed into the lynx; which seems to indicate that the lynx was a Scythian animal.</NOTE> and Ro∣mans.
But, from this circumstance, it is not to
be inferred, that he was brought from Africa, or
the southern provinces of Asia. Pliny, on the
contrary, says, that the first of these animals,
which ever appeared in Rome, were sent from
Gaul in the days of Pompey. At present there
are none in France, unless perhaps in the Alps
or Pyrenees. Under the name of <HI>Gaul,</HI> how∣ever,
the Romans comprehended a great part of
the North; and, besides, France is now much
warmer than it was in the time of the Romans.
The finest skins of the lynx come from Siberia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Russia, the lynxes are very common; their skins are beautiful, but not near so valuable as those of Siberia; <HI>Nouv, Mem. sur la Grande Russie, tom. 2. p.</HI> 73.</NOTE>,
under the name of <HI>Loup-cervier,</HI> and from Ca∣nada<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lynx of North America is a kind of cat, but much larger. He climbs trees, and lives on the animals which he catches. His hair is long, of a grayish white colour, and makes an excellent fur. His flesh is white, and makes good eating; <HI>Descript. des côtes de l'Amerique Septent. tom. 2. p.</HI> 441.</NOTE>,
<PB N="210" REF="246"/>
under that of <HI>chat-cervier,</HI> because these
animals, like all others, are smaller in the New
than in the Old Continent; in the former, they
are compared to the wolf, in the latter to the
cat<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the woods of Canada, there are a great many wolves, or rather <HI>chat-cerviers;</HI> for they have nothing in common with the wolf, but a kind of howling; in every other respect, says M. Sarrasin, they are <HI>ex genere felino.</HI> They are excellent hunters, and live entirely on game, which they pursue to the tops of the highest trees. Their flesh is white, and good for eating. Their skin and hair is well known in France as a valuable branch of commerce; <HI>Charlevoix, tom.</HI> 3. p. 333.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The following circumstances might deceive
M. Klein, and even men of greater ability:
1. The antients say, that India furnished lynxes
to the God Bacchus<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Victa racemifero lyncas dedit India Baccho; <HI>Ovid. Me∣tamorph.</HI></NOTE>; 2. Pliny has placed the
lynx in Aethiopia, and says<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 8. c. 21. et lib. 28. c. 8.—It is to be observed, that Pliny here speaks of the lynx, and not of the <HI>fupus-cervarius;</HI> that all the qualities and virtues of the hair, the claws, the urine, &amp;c. relate only to the lynx, which he mentions as an uncommon Aethiopian monster, and not to the <HI>lupus-cervarius,</HI> which he positively asserts was sent from Gaul to the public spectacles of Rome. The only thing which might create a suspicion that the <HI>chaus</HI> or <HI>lupus-cervarius</HI> of Pliny was not our lynx, is his affirming that it had the figure of the wolf, and the spots of the panther. But this doubt will vanish, when it is considered, that, of all the carnivorous animals in the northern regions, the lynx alone has his skin spotted like that of the panther.</NOTE>, that the hide and
claws were prepared at <HI>Carpathos,</HI> now <HI>Scarpan∣tho,</HI>
or <HI>Zerpanto,</HI> an island in the Mediterranean
between Rhodes and Candia; 3. Gesner has made
a particular article of the Asiatic or African lynx,
which contains the following extract of a letter
<PB N="211" REF="247"/>
from Baron de Balicze<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner, Hist. quad. p. 683.</NOTE>. “You have not men∣tioned,”
says the Baron to Gesner, “in your hi∣story
of animals, the Indian or African lynx.
As Pliny has spoken of it, the authority of so
great a man induced me to send you a draw∣ing
of this animal, that you may have an op∣portunity
of describing it. This drawing was
made at Constantinople. The animal is very
different from the German lynx, being larger,
having rougher and shorter hair,” &amp;c. Gesner,
without making any reflections on this letter,
contents himself with relating the substance of
it, and informing us, in a parenthesis, that the
drawing never arrived.</P>
<P>To prevent similar mistakes, let us observe,
1. That the poets and painters have yoked the
chariot of Bacchus with tigers, panthers, or
lynxes, according to their own fancy, or rather,
because all ferocious animals, with spotted skins,
were equally consecrated to this God. 2. That
it is the word <HI>lynx</HI> which creates all this ambi∣guity;
for it is evident, by comparing different
<PB N="212" REF="248"/>
passages of Pliny with each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pompeii Magni primum ludi ostenderunt Chaum, quem Galli Rhaphium vocabant, effigie lupi, pardorum maculis; <HI>Plinii, lib. 8. c.</HI> 19.—Sunt in eo genere (scilicet luporum), qui cervarii vocantur, qualem é Gallia in Pompeii Magni harena spectatum diximus; <HI>Plin. lib. 8. c.</HI> 22.—Lyncas vulgo fre∣quentes et sphingas, fusco pilo, mammis in pectore geminis, Aethiopia generat, multaque alia monstro similia; <HI>Plin. lib. 8. c.</HI> 21.—From these three passages, it is apparent, that the <HI>chaus</HI> and the <HI>lupus-cervarius</HI> are the same animal, and that the lynx is a different creature. Pliny seems to have been deceived by the name, when he tells us that the figure of the lynx resembled that of the wolf. The lynx, like the wolf, is an animal of prey, nearly of the same size, and howls some∣thing like the wolf; but, in every other article, these animals are totally different.</NOTE>, that the Aethi∣opian
animal he calls <HI>lynx,</HI> is by no means the
same with the <HI>chaus</HI> or <HI>lupus-cervarius,</HI> which
is a native of the northern regions; and that, by
a similar misapplication of the name, the Baron
de Balicze has been deceived, though he regards
the Indian lynx as a different animal from the
German <HI>luchs,</HI> or our lynx. This African or
Indian lynx, which he says was larger and more
beautifully spotted than our lynx, was perhaps a
kind of panther. Whatever may be in this last
conjecture, it is plain, that the lynx, of which we
are here treating, exists not in warm climates,
but is confined to the northern countries of the
Old and New Continents. Olaus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. de gent. septent. ab Olao Magno, lib. 18. p. 139.</NOTE> says, that
this animal is common in the forests of the nor∣thern
parts of Europe. Olearius<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Relat. d'Adam Olearius, tom. 1. p. 121.</NOTE> makes the
same remark, when treating of Muscovy. Ro∣sinus
<PB N="213" REF="249"/>
Lentilius tells us, that the lynx is common
in Courland and Lithuania, and that those of
Cassubia, a province of Pomerania, are smaller
and less spotted than those of Poland and Lithu∣ania<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Auctuarium Hist. Nat. Poloniae, Gabriele Rzaczynski.</NOTE>.
Lastly, to these testimonies, Paulus Jo∣vius
adds, that the finest skins of the lynx come
from Siberia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Aldrov. de quad. digit. p. 96.</NOTE>, and that they constitute a great
article of trade at Ustivaga, a town six hundred
miles distant from Moscow.</P>
<P>This animal which, as we have seen, prefers
cold to temperate countries, is one of those that
might pass from the one Continent to the other
by the lands to the North; and, accordingly, he
is found in North America. Travellers have de∣scribed
him in a manner not to be misunder∣stood<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Among the Gaspesians, there are three kinds of wolves. The <HI>lupus-cervarius</HI> has silver coloured hair, and two pencils of black hair on his head (he means the ears). His flesh is pretty good, though its smell be too rank. This animal is more terrible to behold than cruel; and his skin makes an excellent fur. <HI>Nouv. relat. de la Gaspesie, par le Père Chretien Leclercq. p.</HI> 488.—In the country of the Hurans, the <HI>lupus-cervarius</HI> is more frequent than the common wolves, which are there very scarce; <HI>Voyage de Sagaar Theodat, p.</HI> 307.—In Ame∣rica, there are rapacious animals, as leopards, and <HI>lupi-cervarii,</HI> but no lions. <HI>Singularités de la France antartique, par Thevet, p.</HI> 103.</NOTE>:
Besides, his skin is an article of com∣merce
between America and Europe. The
lynxes of Canada, as formerly remarked, are only
smaller and whiter than those of Europe; and it
is this difference of size that has procured to
them the name of <HI>cati-cervarii,</HI> and has induced
<PB N="214" REF="250"/>
the nomenclators to regard them as a distinct
species.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Linnaeus, who lives at Upsal, and ought to know this animal, since it is a native of Sweden and the adjacent countries, first distinguished the <HI>lupus-cervarius</HI> from the <HI>catus-cervarius.</HI> He denominates the first, <HI>felis caudâ truncatâ, cor∣pore rufescente maculato.

Without pronouncing decisively con∣cerning
this matter, the Canadian and Russian
lynxes appear to be the same species; 1. Because
the difference of size is not very considerable<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Felis alba maculis nigris variegata, caudâ brevi. … Ca∣tus cervarius, <HI>le chat-cervier.</HI>—Felis auricularum apicibus pilis longissimis preditis, caudâ brevi. … Lynx, le loup-cervier; <HI>Brisson, Regn. anim. p.</HI> 274. et 275.</NOTE>,
being nearly proportioned to that which takes
place in all the quadrupeds which are common
to both Continents. The wolves, the foxes, &amp;c.
of America, being less than those of Europe, the
same phaenomenon should be exhibited in the
lynx. 2. Because these animals, even in the
North of Europe, vary in size<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lynces ambae (magnae et parvae) corporis figurâ similes sunt, et similiter utrisque oculi s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aviter fulgent, facies utris∣que alacris perlucet, parvum utrisque caput, &amp;c.; <HI>Oppianus.</HI></NOTE>; and two kinds,
a smaller and a larger, have been mentioned by
authors. 3. Because they equally love cold cli∣mates,
and, being of the same dispositions, the
<PB N="215" REF="251"/>
same figure, and differing only in size and some
shades of colour, these characters seem sufficient
to authorise us to pronounce that they belong to
the same species.</P>
<P>The lynx, of which the antients said that his
sight penetrated the most opaque bodis, and
whose urine became a precious stone, called
<HI>Lapis lyncurius,</HI> is an animal equally fabulous as
the qualities they have ascribed to him. This
imaginary lynx has no other relation to the true
lynx than the name. We must not, therefore,
in imitation of most naturalists, attribute to the
former, which is a real being, the qualities of
this creature of imagination, the existence of
which even Pliny himself seems not to believe;
for he speaks of it as an extraordinary animal,
and ranks it along with the sphynx, the pegasus,
the unicorn, and other prodigies or monsters
brought forth in Aethiopia, a country of which
the antients had no knowledge.</P>
<P>Our lynx, though his sight cannot penetrate
stone-walls, has brilliant eyes, a mild aspect, and
an agreeable and sprightly air. His urine is not
converted into precious stones; but he covers it
with earth, like the cats, to whom he has a great
resemblance, and whose manners and love of
cleanliness are the same. He has nothing in
common with the wolf, but a kind of howling,
which, being heard at a great distance, often de∣ceives
the hunters, and makes them imagine they
are pursuing a wolf. This alone is, perhaps,
<PB N="216" REF="252"/>
sufficient to account for the name <HI>wolf,</HI> which
has been given to him, and to which, to distin∣guish
him from the real wolf, the hunters have
added the epithet <HI>cervarius,</HI> because he attacks
the stag; or rather because his skin is variegated
with spots like that of the young stag. The lynx
is smaller, and stands lower on his legs than the
wolf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lynces nostrae lupis minores sunt, tergo maculosae; <HI>Stu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</HI></NOTE>. He is generally about the size of a fox.
He differs from the panther and ounce by the
following characters: His hair is longer, and his
spots less lively and not so well defined. His
ears are much longer, and terminate in a
pencil of black hair. His tail is much shorter,
and black at the extremity. The circle of his
eyes is white, and his aspect is softer and less fe∣rocious.
The skin of the male is more spotted
than that of the female. He does not run out,
like the wolf, but walks and springs like the cat.
He lives by hunting, and pursues his prey to the
tops of the highest trees. The wild cats, the
pine weasels, the ermines, and the squirrels, are
unable to escape him. He likewise seizes birds;
and watches the approach of stags, fallow-deer,
hares, &amp;c. darts down upon them, seizes them
by the throat, sucks their blood, and opens their
skull to devour their brain; after which, he of∣ten
abandons them, and goes in quest of a fresh
game. He seldom returns to his prey; which
is the reason why the lynx has been said to have
<PB N="217" REF="253"/>
a very bad memory. The colour of his hair
changes with the climate and the season. The
winter furs are more beautiful and richer than
those of summer. His flesh, like that of all car∣nivorous
animals, is not good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rzaczynsky, auct. Hist. Nat. Pol p. 314.</NOTE>.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We here give the figure of a Canadian lynx
from an excellent preparation in the royal Ca∣binet.
It is only two feet three inches long
from the tip of the nose to the origin of the tail,
and from twelve to thirteen inches high. The
body is covered with long grayish hair, mixed
with white, and striped with yellow. The spots
are more or less black. The head is grayish,
blended with white and bright yellow hairs, and
striped, as it were, with black in some parts.
The tip of the nose, as well as the margin of the
under jaw, is black. The whiskers are white,
and about three inches long. The ears are two
inches three lines high, garnished in the inside
with large white hairs, and with yellowish hairs
on the edges. The outer side of the ear is co∣vered
with mouse-coloured hair, and the exter∣nal
margins are black. At the extremity of each
ear, there is a large thin pencil of black hairs,
<PB N="218" REF="254"/>
seven lines high. The tail, which is thick, short,
and well furnished with hair, is only three inches
nine lines in length; from the extremity to the
middle, it is black, and afterwards of a reddish
white colour. The under part of the belly, the
hind legs, and the inside of the fore-legs, and the
feet, are of a dirty white. The claws are white,
and about six lines long. This lynx has a great
resemblance, both in the spots and nature of the
hair, to that whose figure we have given; but
it differs in the length of the tail and the pen∣cils
on the ears. The Canadian lynx, therefore,
may be regarded as a variety very different from
the lynx of the Old Continent. It may even be
said to make a near approach to the caracal, by
the pencils on its ears; but it differs from the
caracal still more than from the lynx, by the
length of the tail and the colour of the hair.
Besides, the caracal is only found in warm coun∣tries;
but the lynx prefers cold climates. The
pencil of hair upon the tips of the ears, which is
regarded as a distinctive character, is only acci∣dental,
and appears in animals of this species, and
even in the domestic and wild cats. Of this we
have given an example in the supplement to the
article <HI>cat.</HI> Hence we persist in believing that
the American lynx is only a variety of the Eu∣ropean
lynx.</P>
<P>The Norwegian lynx, described by Pontoppi∣dan,
is white, or of a bright gray colour, inter∣spersed
with deep spots. Its claws, like those of
<PB N="219" REF="255"/>
other lynxes, resemble the claws of cats. He
elevates his back, and springs upon his prey with
equal quickness and address. When attacked by
a dog, he turns upon his back, and repels the e∣nemy
by repeated strokes of his claws. This
author adds, that there are, in Norway, four
species; that some of them approach the figure
of the wolf, others that of the fox, others that of
the cat, and, lastly, there are others whose head
resembles that of a colt. This last fact, which I
believe to be false, creates the most violent suspi∣cion
with regard to all the rest. The author
adds some articles which are more probable.</P>
<P>“The lynx,” says he, “does not run along
the country, but conceals himself in woods and
caverns. He makes his retreat deep and wind∣ing,
from which he can be expelled only by
fire and smoke. His sight is piercing, and he
spies his prey at a very great distance. He of∣ten
eats no more of a sheep or goat than the
brain, the liver, and the intestines; and he
digs under the doors, in order to gain admis∣sion
into the sheep-folds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan's Nat. Hist. of Norway.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The species of the lynx is not only spread
over Europe, but all the northern provinces of
Asia. In Tartary, they are called <HI>Chulon</HI> or
<HI>Chelason</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Voyages, tom. 6. p. 602.</NOTE>. Their skins are highly valued, and,
though very common, they sell equally dear in
<PB N="220" REF="256"/>
Norway, Russia, and as far as China, where they
are much used for muffs, and other furs.</P>
<P>That the pencils of hair on the tips of the ears
is not a distinctive character, appears from this
fact, that there exists, in the district of Alger,
called <HI>Constantine,</HI> a species of caracal, without
these pencils, and which resembles the lynx, ex∣cepting
that its tail is longer. The colour of its
hair is reddish, with longitudinal black stripes
from the neck to the tail, detached spots on the
flanks disposed in the same direction, a black half-circle
on the top of the fore-legs, and a band of
rough hair on the four legs, extending from the
extremity of the foot to above the heel; and this
hair inclines upward, instead of downward, like
the hair of every other part of the body.</P>

<P>THOUGH the caracal resembles the lynx in
size, figure, aspect, and the pencil of black
hair on the tips of the ears, we are of opinion,
from the disparities between these two animals,
that they belong to different species. The ca∣racal
is not spotted like the lynx; his hair is
rougher and shorter; his tail is longer, and of
a uniform colour; his muzzle is also more
lengthened; his aspect is less mild, and his
disposition more ferocious. The lynx inha∣bits
only cold or temperate climates; the cara∣cal
is never found but in warm countries. It
<PB N="222" REF="260"/>
is from these differences of disposition and cli∣mate
that we have judged them to belong to
different species, as well as from the inspection
and comparison of the two animals, both of
which we have examined and drawn from the
life.</P>
<P>This animal is common in Barbary, in Arabia,
and in all the countries inhabited by the lion, the
panther, and the ounce. Like them, he lives on
prey; but, being smaller and weaker, it is with
difficulty he procures subsistence; for he is ge∣nerally
obliged to be contented with what they
leave. He keeps at a distance from the panther,
because that animal exercises its cruelties after
being fully gorged with prey. But he follows
the lion, which, after a full repast, never injures
any creature. The caracal feasts upon the of∣fals
of the lion's table, and sometimes accompa∣nies
him at no great distance, having nothing to
apprehend from his rage, because he is unable,
like the panther, to pursue the caracal to the
tops of the tallest trees. For all these reasons
the caracal has been called the lion's guide or
provider<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The karacoulacs are animals somewhat larger than cats, and of the same make. They have black ears, nearly half a foot long, and from this circumstance they derive their name, which signifies <HI>black ear.</HI> According to the opinion of the na∣tives, they serve as pioneers to the lion; for they go a little be∣fore, explore those places where prey is to be expected, and are rewarded with a share. When this animal gives the a∣larm to the lion, his cry resembles that of one person to ano∣ther, though the voice is considerably sharper. <HI>Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 2. p.</HI> 114.</NOTE>. The latter, whose smell is not a∣cute,
<PB N="223" REF="261"/>
employs the former to scent animals at a
distance, and rewards him with a part of the
spoil<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I saw an animal in an iron cage, which the Arabs called <HI>the lion's guide.</HI> It has so strong a resemblance to a cat, that it has been called <HI>the cat of Syria;</HI> and I saw another of them at Florence which went under the same name. He is so fierce, that, if any person attempts to take meat from him, he becomes perfectly furious, and, if not appeased, springs instantly upon the spoiler. There are small tufts of hair on the summits of his ears; and he is called the <HI>lion's guide,</HI> because the latter is said to be deficient in scent. But, when attended by the cara∣cal, which has a very acute nose, he follows his prey, and re∣wards his conductor with a share. <HI>Voyage d'Orient du Père Philippe, Carme-déchaussé, liv. 2. p.</HI> 76.—The <HI>gat el challah, siyah gush,</HI> or <HI>karrah-kulak,</HI> i. e. <HI>the black cat,</HI> or <HI>black eared cat,</HI> as the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish names signify, is of the bigness and shape of a cat of the largest size. The body is of a red∣dish brown; the belly of a light colour, and sometimes spot∣ted; the chops are black, the ears of a deep gray, with the tips of them distinguished by small tufts of black stiff hair, as in the lynx. The figure given of this animal by Charle∣ton is not so full in the chops as the Barbary Siyah-gush; <HI>Shaw's travels, p.</HI> 175. The figure given by Charleton does not represent the hair properly; and the head, which is bald, is deprived of its roundness. However, the siyah-gush of Charleton, and that of Barbary, mentioned by Dr Shaw, be∣long to the same species with our caracal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The caracal is about the size of a fox, but
much stronger and more ferocious. He has
been known to attack and instantly tear to pieces
a middle-sized dog, which defended itself as
long as it was able. He is extremely difficult
to tame. However, when taken young, and
reared with care, he may be trained to hunting,
<PB N="224" REF="262"/>
an employment of which he is naturally fond,
and in which he is very successfull, especially if
he is never let loose upon any animal that is not
his inferior in strength; for he loses courage, as
soon as he perceives real danger. In India, he is
employed for catching hares, rabbits, and even
large birds, whom he surprises, and siezes with
singular address.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I mentioned under the article <HI>caracal,</HI> that
the word <HI>gat-el-challah</HI> signified <HI>the black eared
cat.</HI> Mr Bruce assures me that it means <HI>the cat
of the desert.</HI> In that part of Nubia formerly called
the <HI>isle of Meroe,</HI> he saw a caracal which differed
in some respects from that of Barbary, of which
we have given a figure. The face of the Nu∣bian
caracal is rounder, the ears black on the
outside, but interspersed with silver-coloured
hairs. He has the mule-cross on his withers,
like most of the Barbary caracals. On the
breast, belly, and inside of the thighs, there are
small bright yellow spots, and not blackish brown,
as in the Barbary caracal. These are only slight
varieties, the number of which might be still
augmented; for we find in Barbary, or rather
in Lybia, near the antient Capsa, a caracal with
white, instead of black ears. The pencils of
these white-eared caracals are thin, short, and

black. They have a white tail, the extremity
of which is surrounded with four black rings,
and four black patches on the hind part of each
leg, like the Nubian caracal. They are also
smaller than the other caracals, not exceeding
the size of a domestic cat. The ears are white
within, and covered on the out side with bushy
hair, of a lively red colour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by Mr Bruce to M. de Buffon.</NOTE>. If this difference
in size were constant, it might be alledged that
there are two species of caracals in Barbary, the
one large with black ears and long pencils; the
other much smaller, with white ears and very
short pencils. It appears likewise, that these ani∣mals,
which differ so greatly in their ears, are e∣qually
diversified in the form and length of the
tail, as well as in the height of the legs; for Mr
Edwards has sent us the figure of a caracal from
Bengal, whose tail and limbs are vastly longer
than those of the common kind.</P>

<P>THOUGH Aristotle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristot. hist. anim. lib. 6. c. 32. lib. 8, c. 5.</NOTE> has left us two cha∣racters
by which alone this animal is
easily distinguished from all others; yet travel∣lers
and naturalists have confounded the hyaena
with no less than four different species, namely,
the jackal, the glutton, the civet, and the baboon.
They are carnivorous and ferocious, like the
hyaena, and each of them has some resemblance to
him, which might give rise to the mistake. The
<PB N="227" REF="267"/>
jackal inhabits the same countries, and, like
the hyaena, has nearly the form of a wolf, feeds
upon dead carcasses, and digs them out of the
sepulchres. The glutton is equally voracious,
has the same appetite for putrified flesh, the
same instinct of digging the dead out of their
graves; and, though he lives in a different cli∣mate,
and his figure is very different from that
of the hyaena, this conformity of natural disposi∣tions
was sufficient to make authors confound
them together. The civet is found in the same
countries, and, like the hyaena, has long hair a∣long
the back, and a particular fissure or ori∣fice.
These singular characters, which belong to
no other animals, misled Belon into the notion
that the civet was the hyaena of the antients.
The baboon has still less resemblance to the hy∣aena
than the other three; for it has hands and
feet like those of a man or a monkey. Naturalists,
therefore, could only be deceived by the name: In
Barbary, the hyaena, according to Dr Shaw, is
called <HI>dubbah,</HI> and the baboon, according to Mar∣mol
and Leo Africanus, is called <HI>dabuh;</HI> and, as
the baboon is found in the same climates, digs
the earth, and is nearly of the same form with
the hyaena, these affinities first deceived travel∣lers,
and naturalists copied the blunder, with∣out
sufficient examination. Even those who have
clearly distinguished these two animals, have gi∣ven
to the hyaena the name of <HI>dabuh,</HI> which be∣longs
to the baboon. Hence the hyaena is not
<PB N="228" REF="268"/>
the <HI>dabuh</HI> of the Arabians, nor the <HI>jesef</HI> or <HI>sesef</HI>
of the Africans, as we are told by naturalists<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Exercit. p. 14 Brisson. Regn. anim. p. 234.</NOTE>.
Neither should he be confounded with the <HI>deeb</HI>
of Barbary. But, to prevent all future confusion
arising from names, we shall, in a few words,
give a detail of the researches we have made
with regard to these animals.</P>

to Pietro della Valle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Schiras, I saw a living animal, which the Persians called <HI>castar.</HI> It was as strong as a large dog. It was of the size, figure, and colour of a tiger, (he means the panther), and the head and muzzle were long like those of a hog. This animal is said to feed on human flesh, and to dig up the carcasses from the scpulchres, which made me conjecture that it might be the hyaena of the antients. However this may be, it was a ferocious creature which I had never before seen; <HI>Voyage de Pietro della Valle, tom. 5. p.</HI> 343.</NOTE>. These are all the
appellations which can, with propriety, be appli∣ed
to the hyaena. It is probable, however, that
the <HI>lycaon</HI> and <HI>crocuta</HI> of India and Aethiopia,
mentioned by the antients, are no other than the
hyaena. Porphyry says expressly<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Porphyrius in eo opere quod inscripsit de abstinentia ab usu carnium, hyaenam dicit ab Indis appellari crocutam; <HI>Gillius apud Gesner. hist. quad. p.</HI> 555.</NOTE>, that the
Indian <HI>crocuta</HI> is the hyaena of the Greeks.
Indeed, all that the antients have said, whether
true or fabulous, concerning the <HI>lycaon</HI> and <HI>cro∣cuta,</HI>

apply to the hyaena. But we shall post∣pone
all farther conjectures on this subject, till
we come to treat of fabulous animals, and the
relations they have with real ones.</P>
<P>The panther of the Greeks, the <HI>lupus cana∣rius</HI>
of Gaza, and the <HI>lupus Armenius</HI> of the A∣rabians
and modern Latins, seem to be the same
animal, namely, the jackal, which Pollux says

We shall preserve the name <HI>jackal,</HI> be∣cause
it has been adopted by most travellers, and
content ourselves with remarking in this place,
that he differs from the hyaena not only in size,
figure, and colour, but likewise in his manners;
for the jackals commonly go in troops, and the
hyaena is a solitary animal. Our modern no∣menclators,
in imitation of Kaempfer, call the
jackal, <HI>lupus aureus,</HI> because his hair is of a live∣ly
yellow colour.</P>
<P>The jackal, as we have seen, is an animal very
different from the hyaena, as well as from the
glutton, which last is peculiar to the northern
regions of Lapland, Russia, and Siberia: It is
<PB N="232" REF="272"/>
even unknown in the temperate climates, and,
consequently, could never inhabit Arabia, and
the other warm countries frequented by the
hyaena. Besides, the figure of the glutton re∣sembles
that of a very large badger; his limbs
are so short, that his belly nearly reaches to the
ground; he has five toes both on the fore and
hind feet; no mane, and black hair over all the
body, excepting sometimes a few brownish yel∣low
hairs on the flanks. In a word, he possesses
nothing in common with the hyaena, but his
voracity. He was likewise unknown to the an∣tients,
who had not penetrated far into the nor∣thern
regions of Europe. Olaus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inter omnia animalia quae immani voracitate creduntur insatiabilia, gulo in partibus Sueciae <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eptentrionalis, praeci∣puum suscepit nomen, ubi patrio sermone <HI>Jerff</HI> dicitur, et lingua Germanica <HI>Wilsfrass,</HI> Sclavonice <HI>Rosomaka,</HI> a multa commesti∣one; Latina vero non nisi fictitio gulo, videlicet a gulositate, ap∣pellatur; <HI>Hist. de gent. septent. ab Olao Magno, p.</HI> 138.</NOTE> is the first au∣thor

The French travellers have called him
<HI>glouton</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Relation de la Grande Tartarie, p. 8.</NOTE>. Of this species there are varieties, as
well as in that of the jackal, which shall be
pointed out in the particular history of those a∣nimals.
But these varieties, instead of making
<PB N="233" REF="273"/>
him approach nearer the hyaena, remove the
two species to a still greater distance.</P>
<P>The civet has nothing in common with the
hyaena, excepting the fissure or sac under the
tail, and the mane along the neck and spine.
It differs from the hyaena in the figure and size
of the body, being one half smaller. Its ears are
short and covered with hair, while those of the
hyaena are long and naked. Besides, it has
shorter limbs, and five toes on each foot; but
the legs of the hyaena are long, and he has on∣ly
four toes on each foot. Neither does the
civet dig the earth in quest of dead bodies. It
is, therefore, extremely easy to distinguish these
animals.</P>
<P>With regard to the baboon, which is the <HI>papio</HI>
of the Latins, he seems to have been mistaken
for the hyaena by an ambiguity of names, to
which a passage of Leo Africanus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dabuh</HI> Arabica appellatione Africanis <HI>Sesef</HI> dicitur. Ani∣mal et magnitudine et forma lupum refert, <HI>pedes et crura homi∣nis similes;</HI> reliquo bestiarum genere non est noxius, sed huma∣na corpora sepulchris evellit ac devorat; <HI>Leon. Afric. de Afric. descript. tom. 2. p.</HI> 756.</NOTE>, copied by
Marmol<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 57.</NOTE>, seems to have given rise. The <HI>dabuh,</HI>
say these two authors, `is of the size and figure
`of the wolf, and tears dead bodies from the
`sepulchres.' The similarity of the name <HI>dabuh</HI>
with <HI>dubbah,</HI> which last denotes the hyaena,
joined to the avidity for dead carcasses common
<PB N="234" REF="274"/>
to the <HI>dabuh</HI> and <HI>dubbah,</HI> have made them be
mistaken for the same animal, though it be ex∣pressly
mentioned in the very passages we have
quoted, that the <HI>dabuh</HI> has hands and feet like
those of a man, which corresponds with the ba∣boon,
but can never apply to the hyaena.</P>
<P>By looking at Belon's figure of the <HI>lupus ma∣rinus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon, de aquatil. p. 35</NOTE>,
which Gesner has copied<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner, hist. quadrup. p. 674.</NOTE>, this animal
might be mistaken for the hyaena, because there
is a considerable resemblance. But his descrip∣tion
applies not to our hyaena; for he tells us,
that the <HI>lupus marinus</HI> is an amphibious animal,
which feeds on fishes, and has sometimes been
seen on the coasts of the British ocean. Besides,
Belon mentions none of the peculiar characters
which distinguish the hyaena from all other qua∣drupeds.
Belon, prepossessed, perhaps, with the
notion that the civet was the hyaena of the an∣tients,
has given the figure of the true hyaena,
under the name of <HI>lupus marinus;</HI> for the cha∣racters
of the hyaena are so singular, that it is
almost impossible to mistake him. He is, per∣haps,
the only quadruped that has four toes on
each foot. Like the badger, he has an orifice
under the tail, which penetrates not into the bo∣dy.
He has long, straight, naked ears; a head
shorter and more square than that of the wolf;
but his legs, particularly the hind ones, are long∣er.
His eyes are placed like those of a dog.
<PB N="235" REF="275"/>
The hair of his body and mane is of a dark gray
colour, mixed with a little yellow and black, and
transverse dusky undulations. He is of the size
of a wolf, only his body is shorter and more
compact.</P>
<P>This savage and solitary animal lives in the ca∣verns
of the mountains, in the clefts of rocks, or
dens which he digs for himself in the earth. His
disposition is extremely ferocious, and, though
taken young, never can be tamed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hyaenam marem Ispahani curiositatis causa alebat dives quidam <HI>Gabr</HI> seu ignicola, suburbii <HI>Gabristaan,</HI> captam dum u∣bera sugeret, in latibulis vicini montis.

rushes with fury upon cattle of all kinds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Abyssinia, the wolves are small and timorous. But they have an animal called hyaena, which is extremely bold and rapacious. He attacks men in the open day as well as during the night, and often breaks down the doors and inclosures of the sheep-folds; <HI>Hist. de l'Abissinia, par Rudolf, p.</HI> 41.</NOTE>. He
<PB N="236" REF="276"/>
follows the flocks, and often breaks down the
doors of stables, and the inclosures of the sheep∣folds.
His eyes sparkle in the dark; and he is
said to see better in the night than in the day.
All naturalists agree, that his cry resembles
the groanings of a man who vomits, or rather
the lowing of a calf, according to Kaempfer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kaempfer, loc. supra citat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The hyaena defends himself against the lion,
is not afraid of the panther, and attacks the ounce,
which is not able to resist him. When prey
fails, he digs the earth with his feet, and tears
out the dead bodies of animals and men, who,
in the countries which he inhabits, are equally
buried in the fields. He is found in almost all
the warm climates of Africa and Asia; and the
animal called <HI>farasse</HI> at Madagascar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Madagascar, there are animals called <HI>farasses,</HI> of the same nature with the wolf, but still more voracious; <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des Indes-Orient. p.</HI> 168.—See also <HI>l'hist. de l'Ore∣noque, par Ioseph Jumilla, tom. 3. p.</HI> 603.</NOTE> which in
figure resembles the wolf, but is larger, stronger,
and more cruel, is perhaps the same with the
hyaena.</P>
<P>A greater variety of absurd stories have been
related concerning the hyaena than any other
quadruped. The antients gravely tell us, that the
hyaena is alternately male and female; that,
when it brings forth, suckles, and rears its young,
it continues to be a female during the whole
year; but that, the following year, it resumes
<PB REF="277"/>
<FIGURE>
<P>Plate CXXV.</P>
<P>HYAENA.</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="237" REF="278"/>
the functions of the male, and makes its compa∣nion
submit to the lot of the female. This story,
it is apparent, has no other foundation than the
fissure under the tail, which is common to the
male as well as the female, independent of the
organs of generation peculiar to both sexes, which,
in the hyaena, are similar to those of all other
quadrupeds. The hyaena has been said to imi∣tate
the human voice, to remember the names of
shepherds, to call upon, to fascinate, and to de∣prive
them of the power of motion; and, at the
same time, to terrify the shepherdesses, to make
them run from and neglect their flocks, to ren∣der
them frantic with love, &amp;c.—All this might
happen without the hyaena! and I here stop,
lest I should, with Pliny, incur the censure of
delighting in compiling and relating ridiculous
fables.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1773, I saw a male hyaena at the
fair of St Germain. The hyaena above descri∣bed
was perfectly ferocious; but this male, ha∣ving
been tamed when young, was remarkably
gentle; for, though his master often provoked
him with a cudgel, in order to make him erect
his mane, he instantly afterwards seemed to forget
the affront. He played with his keeper, who
put his hand into the animal's mouth, without
<PB N="238" REF="279"/>
the least apprehension of danger. This hyaena
was precisely of the same species with that whose
description I have formerly given; and I have
nothing to add to it, excepting that the tail of
this male was all white, without any mixture of
other colours. He was somewhat larger than
the first, being three feet two inches long, from
the extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the
tail, and carried his head lower than is repre∣sented
in the figure. His height was two feet
three inches; and his hair was white, intermix∣ed
with streaks and spots of black, both on the
body and legs.</P>
<P>In the south part of the island of Meroë, there
are hyaenas much larger than those of Barbary.
Their muzzle is longer, and has a greater resem∣blance
to that of a dog. This animal is so strong,
that he carries off a man to the distance of a
league or two, without stopping. His hair is
coarse, browner than that of the other kind, and
the transverse streaks are blacker. His mane e∣rects
not from the head, but from the tail. Mr
Bruce was the first who remarked of this hyaena,
as well as that of Syria and Barbary, that, when
forced to fly, they are lame of the left hind-leg,
which continues so remarkably for about a hun∣dred
paces, that the animal seems as if he would
tumble down on his left side<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated to M. de Buffon from Mr Bruce.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>IT is the opinion of most naturalists, that the
perfume called <HI>musk</HI> was furnished only by
one species of animal. I have seen two of these
animals, which, it must be allowed, have many
essential relations, both in their external and in∣ternal
structure; but they differ from each other
<PB N="240" REF="281"/>
by such a number of other characters, as entitle
them to be regarded as two distinct species. To the
first we have preserved the antient name of <HI>civet,</HI>
and to the second we have given, for the sake of
distinction, that of <HI>zibet.</HI> The civet appears to be
the same with that described by the gentlemen of
the Academy in the <HI>Mem. pour servir a l'histoire
des animaux,</HI> by Caius in Gesner, <HI>p.</HI> 873. and by
Fabius Columna, who has given a figure of both
male and female in the work of Jean Faber,
which is at the end of that of Hernandes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hernandes, hist. Mex. p. 580.</NOTE></P>
<P>The second species, which I have called <HI>the
zibet,</HI> seems to be the same animal with that
described by M. de la Peyronnie, under the
name of <HI>the musk animal,</HI> in the <HI>Mem. de
l'Aacad. des sciences, année</HI> 1731. Both differ
from the civet by the same characters; both
<PB N="241" REF="282"/>
want the mane or long hair on the spine;
and both have annulated tails. But the civet
has neither mane nor rings. It must be al∣lowed,
however, that our zibet and the musk a∣nimal
of M. de la Peyronnie, have not such a per∣fect
resemblance as to leave no doubt concerning
the identity of their species. In the zibet, the
rings on the tail are larger than those of the
musk animal. The former has not a double
collar, and his tail is shorter in proportion to the
length of his body. But these differences are
slight, and appear to be only accidental varieties,
to which the civet must be more liable than o∣ther
wild animals, because he is kept in a do∣mestic
state in many parts of India and the Le∣vant.
It is certain, however, that our zibet
has a greater resemblance to the musk animal
of M. de la Peyronnie than to the civet, and,
consequently, the two former may be regarded
as belonging to the same species; for we have
no absolute certainty that the civet and zibet
are not varieties of the same species, because we
are ignorant whether they can intermix and pro∣duce
fertile individuals: And, when we say,
that they seem to be different species, we only
mean that the presumption is exceedingly strong,
since it is founded on permanent differences in
their characters, which generally distinguish real
species from accidental varieties.</P>
<P>The animal we here call <HI>the civet,</HI> is named

Guiney; for our subject was sent alive, from Gui∣ney
to St Domingo, to one of our correspondents,
who, after feeding it some time, killed it for
the conveniency of carriage.</P>
<P>The zibet is probably the civet of Asia, of
the East Indies, and of Arabia, where he is cal∣led
<HI>Zebet</HI> or <HI>Zibet,</HI> an Arabian word, which sig∣nifies
also the perfume of this animal. He dif∣fers
from the civet in having a longer and thick∣er
body, a thinner and flatter muzzle, which is
somewhat concave on the upper part; while the
muzzle of the civet is thicker, shorter, and a lit∣tle
convex. The ears of the former are also
larger, and more erect. His tail is longer, and
better marked with annular spots, and his hair
is shorter and softer. He has no mane, or long
hair on the neck and spine, no black spots un∣der
the eyes, or on the cheeks, which are re∣markable
characters in the civet. Several tra∣vellers
have suspected that there were two spe∣cies
of civets; but no body has examined them
so minutely as to furnish a distinct description.
We have seen both, and, after a careful compa∣rison,
we think they are not only different spe∣cies,
but belong, perhaps, to different climates.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="284"/>
These animals have been called <HI>musk-cats</HI> or <HI>ci∣vet-cats,</HI>
though they have nothing in common
with the cat but agility of body. They rather re∣semble
the fox, especially in the head. Their skin
is marked with bands and spots, which has made
them be mistaken for the panther, when seen
at a distance. But they differ from the panther
in every other respect. There is an animal cal∣led
<HI>the genet,</HI> which is spotted in the same man∣ner,
whose head is nearly of the same form,
and which, like the civet, has a sac where
an odoriferous liquor is secreted. But the genet
is smaller than our civet. Its limbs are shorter,
and its body much thinner. Its perfume is weak,
and of short duration: But the perfume of the
civet is very strong; and that of the zibet is still
more violent and piercing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding all the attention that has for a long time been bestowed in collecting foreign animals at the <HI>Me∣nagerie,</HI> these are the only two of this species which have ap∣peared, or which, among the number of musk animals that we have seen there, had a strong persume; <HI>Mem. de la Peyronnie inséré dans ceux de l'Académie des Sciences, année 1731. p.</HI> 444.

is found in the fissure which these two a∣nimals
have near the organs of generation. It
is a thick humour, of the consistence of poma∣tum,
and its perfume, though very strong, is a∣greeable,
even when it issues from the body of
the animal. This matter of the civet must not be
confounded with musk, which is a sanguineous

from the civet or zibet. The animal which
produces the musk is a species of roebuck, or

most of the fables related concerning the hyaena
have been derived from the civet. The phil∣ters,
said to have been extracted from certain
parts of the hyaena, and their power of exciting
love, indicates sufficiently that the antients knew
the stimulating virtue of the civet's pomatum,
which is still used for this purpose in the East.
What they have related concerning the uncertain∣ty
of the sex in the hyaena, applies still better to the
civet; for, in the male, nothing appears external∣ly
but three apertures, so perfectly similar to those
of the female, that it is impossible otherwise to di∣stinguish
the sex than by dissection. The aper∣ture

<P>The error of Gregoire de Bolivar, with re∣gard
to the climates which give birth to the ci∣vets,
has been more generally diffused than that
of Belon. After telling us that they are com∣mon
in Africa and the East Indies, he asserts po∣sitively,
that they are very numerous in every
part of South America. This assertion, trans∣mitted
to us by Faber, has been copied by Al∣drovandus,
and adopted by all succeeding wri∣ters
on the subject. It is certain, however, that
the civets are peculiar to the warm climates of
the Old Continent, and could never pass by the
north into America, where, in fact, in civets e∣ver
existed till they were transported from the
Philippine islands, and the coast of Africa. But,
as the assertion of Bolivar is positive, and mine
only negative, I must give my reasons for pro∣ving
the falsity of the fact. To enable the read∣er
to judge, beside the remarks I am about to make,
I shall quote the passage of Faber entire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoc animal (zibethicum scilicet) nascitur in multis In∣diae Orientalis atque Occidentalis partibus, cujusmodi in o∣rientali sunt provinciae Bengala, Ceilan, Sumatra, Java major et minor, Malipur, ac plures aliae—In Nova Hispania vero sunt provinciae de Quatemala, Campege, Nicaragua, de Vera-Cruce, Florida, et magna illa insula Sancti Dominici, aut Hispaniola, Cuba, Mantalino, Guadalupa, et aliae—In regno Peruano animal hoc magna copia reperitur, in Para∣guay, Tucuman, Chiraguanas, Sancta-Cruce, de la Sierra, Jungas, Andes, Chiachiapoias, Quizos, Timana, novo regno, et in omnibus provinciis magno flumine Maragnone confini∣bus, quae circa hoc ferme sine numero ad duo leucarum millia sunt extensa.

from the mouth of its author. These three re∣marks
are alone sufficient to throw a suspicion
on this pretended <HI>animal zibethicum Americanum,</HI>
as well as upon the assertions of Faber borrowed
from Bolivar. But, to render our detection of
this error complete, we find, in a tract composed
by Fernandes upon American animals, at the
end of the volume which contains the Natural
history of Mexico by Hernandes, Recchi, and
Faber, a passage that flatly contradicts Bolivar,
and where Fernandes assures us, that the civet is
not an American animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Aeluro a quo Gallia vocata corraditur, c. 34.

by uniting this positive testimony of Fernandes
to that of all the travellers who say that the ci∣vets
are very common in the Philippine islands,
in the East Indies, and in Africa, none of whom
mention their having ever seen these animals in
America, it will no longer admit of a doubt, that
the civet is not a native of America, but an ani∣mal
peculiar to the warm climates of the Old
Continent, and was never found in the New till
after being transported thither. If I had not
been on my guard against mistakes of this kind,
which are too frequent, I would have announced
our civet as an American animal, because it was
transmitted from St Domingo; but, having exa∣mined
the memoir and letter of M. Pagés, which
accompanied the animal, I found that it came
originally from Guiney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This civet was brought from Guiney. It fed upon fruits; but it likewise very willingly eat flesh. While it lived, it diffused, to a great distance, an insupportable odour of musk; and, after its death, I was not able to endure the scent in a chamber. Immediately above the scrotum, I found a fissure, which was a common passage to two pouches, one on each side of the testicles. These pouches were full of a gray, thick, viscid humour, mixed with long hairs of the same co∣lour with those I found in the pouches. The facs or pouch∣es were about an inch and a half deep; and their diameter was much larger at the top than the bottom; <HI>Extrait du Mem. de M. Pagès, Medecin du Roi à Saint-Domingue, daté du Cap, le 6. Septembre,</HI> 1759.</NOTE> These particular
facts I consider as so many proofs of the general
position, that there is a real distinction between
all the animals peculiar to the southern regions
of each Continent.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="290"/>
Hence the civet and zibet belong to the Old
Continent. They differ from each other only by
the external marks formerly pointed out. For
the structure of their internal organs, and of the
reservoirs which contain their perfume, I must
refer to the excellent descriptions of Messrs Mo∣rand
and Peyronnie<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'acad. des sciences, année 1728, et 1731.</NOTE> With regard to what

plants, or laudanum, storax, and other balsamic
and odoriferous drugs.</P>
<P>To collect this perfume, the animal is put in∣to
a narrow cage, where he cannot turn himself.
The cage is opened at one end; the animal is
drawn a little out by the tail, and fixed in this
position, by putting a stick across the bars of
the cage, which likewise enables the people to
lay hold of the hind legs. They then introduce a
<PB N="251" REF="292"/>
small spoon into the sac that contains the per∣fume,
with which they scrape all its internal
sides, and put the matter into a vessel, which is
covered up with great care. This operation is
repeated two or three times a-week. The quan∣tity
of odorous humour depends much on the
quality of the nourishment, and the appetite of
the animal, which always produces more in pro∣portion
to the goodness of its food. Boiled flesh,
eggs, rice, small animals, birds, young poultry,
and especially fish, are the best kinds of food, and
they ought to be varied in such a manner as to
preserve the health and excite the appetite. He
requires very little water; and, though he drinks
seldom, he discharges urine frequently; and, in
this operation, the male is not to be distinguish∣ed
from the female.</P>
<P>The perfume of these animals is so strong, that
it infects all parts of the body: The hair and
the skin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reservoir that contains the odorous liquor of the ci∣vet lies below the anus, and above another orifice, which is so similar in both sexes, that, without diffection, all civets appear to be females. … As this liquor becomes incommodious, when the reservoirs are too full of it, the animal is provided with proper muscles for squeezing it out. Though it be col∣lected in great quantities in these reservoirs, where it is likewise brought to the highest perfection; yet it seems to be diffused by sweat through the whole skin; for the hair of both our civets had a strong smell; that of the male, particularly, was so im∣pregnated with perfume, that the hand, after gently rubbing his hair, retained an agreeable odour for a considerable time; <HI>Hist. de l'Acad. des sciences, tom. 1. p.</HI> 82.</NOTE> are so thoroughly penetrated with this
odour, that they retain it long after death; and,
<PB N="252" REF="293"/>
during life, it is so violent as to be quite insup∣portable,
especially if a person is shut up in the
same apartment with the animal. When heated
with rage, the odour becomes more highly ex∣alted;
and, if the animal be tormented till he
sweats, the keeper collects the sweat, which has
likewise a strong scent, and serves for adultera∣ting,
or at least augmenting the quantity of the
perfume.</P>
<P>The civets are naturally savage, and even some∣what
ferocious; yet they are easily tamed, so as
to be approached and handled without danger.
They have strong sharp teeth; but their claws
are weak and blunt. Though their bodies are
thick, they are active and nimble. They leap
like cats, but can likewise run like dogs. They
live by hunting and surprising small animals and
birds. Like the fox, they enter the court-yards,
and carry off poultry. Their eyes sparkle in the
dark, and they probably see well during the
night. When animal food fails them, they eat
roots and fruits. They drink little, never fre∣quent
moist places, and spontaneously live among
burning sands and arid mountains. In their
own climate, they are very prolific; but, though
they can live and produce their perfume in tem∣perate
regions, they are incapable of multiplying.
Their voice is stronger, and their tongue smoother
than those of the cat; and their cry has a resem∣blance
to that of an enraged dog.</P>

In Europe, the unctuous perfume extracted
from these animals is called <HI>civet,</HI> and <HI>zibet</HI> or
<HI>algallia</HI> in Arabia. It is more used in India and
the Levant, than in the more northern countries.
It is hardly now employed as a medicine; but
the perfumers and confectioners make use of
it in the composition of their perfumes. The
odour of the civet, though strong, is more agree∣able
than that of musk. But both of them lost
their reputation upon the discovery of amber∣gris,
or rather the mode of preparing it: And
even the ambergris, which not long ago was
esteemed for the excellence of its smell, has cea∣sed
to be admired by people of a refined and de∣licate

<P>In the year 1772, M. de Ladebat sent a live
civet to M. Bertin secretary of state. This ani∣mal
was given by the Dutch Governour of Fort
Mine, on the coast of Africa, to the captain of
one of M. de Ladebat's ships, in the year 1770,
and was landed at Bourdeaux in the month of
November 1772. On its arrival, it was very
weak; but, after some days, resumed its strength,
and, at the end of five or six months, its size was
augmented about four inches. It was fed with
raw and boiled flesh, fish, soup, and milk. It
was kept warm during the winter; for it seemed
to suffer much from cold, and became less fero∣cious

<P>THE Genet is a smaller animal than the
civets. It has a long body, short legs, a
sharp muzzle, a slender head, smooth, soft hair
of a shining grayish ash-colour, marked with
black spots, which are round and detached on
the sides, but unite so closely on the back, that
they seem to form continued black bars, stretch∣ing
along the body. Upon the neck and spine,
there is a kind of mane or long hair, forming a
black bar from the head to the tail, which last is
as long as the body, and marked with seven or
eight alternately black and white rings. The
black spots on the neck are also in the form of
bars; and under each eye there is a very con∣spicuous
white spot. Under the tail, and in the
<PB N="255" REF="298"/>
same situation as in the civets, the genet has an
aperture or sac, in which is secreted a kind of
perfume; but it is weak, and soon loses its o∣dour.
The genet is longer than the martin, to
which it has a great resemblance in figure, man∣ners,
and dispositions. But the genet seems to
be more easily tamed. Belon tells us, that he
saw genets in the houses of Constantinople, which
were as tame as cats, and allowed to run about,
without doing any kind of mischief; and that
they are called <HI>Constantinople cats, Spanish cats,</HI>
or <HI>genet cats.</HI> They have nothing, however, in
common with cats, but the art of watching and
catching mice. It is, perhaps, because they are
found only in Spain and the Levant, that they
have obtained the names of these countries; for
the word <HI>genet</HI> is not derived from the antient
languages, and is probably a new name, taken
from some place frequented by the genet, which
we know is very common in Spain, where a cer∣tain
race of horses are called <HI>genets.</HI> Naturalists
pretend, that the genets inhabit only moist places,
and in the neighbourhood of brooks; and that
they are never found in mountains or dry grounds.
Their species is not numerous, or at least much
diffused. There are none in France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the supplement, p, 256.</NOTE> or in any
other province of Europe, excepting Spain and
Turkey. Hence, for their subsistence and mul∣tiplication,
they require a warm climate; yet
none of them appear to be found in the warm
<PB N="256" REF="299"/>
countries of Africa and India; for the fossane,
which is called the <HI>Madagascar genet,</HI> is a dif∣ferent
species, and shall afterwards be described.</P>
<P>The skin of this animal makes a light and
handsome fur. Genet muffs were very fashion∣able
some years ago, and gave a high price. But,
since we learned the art of counterfeiting them,
by painting with black spots the skin of the gray
rabbit, their price has fallen three-fourths, and
the mode has changed.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I remarked, under the article <HI>genet,</HI> that the
species was not widely diffused, and that there
were none of them in France, nor in any other
province of Europe, excepting Spain and Tur∣key
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, p. 255.</NOTE>. I had not then learned that genets were
found in our southern provinces, and that they
are very common in Poitou, where they are
known by the name of <HI>genets,</HI> even to the pea∣sants,
who assure us, that these animals inhabit
only moist places and the banks of rivulets<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Extrait des affiches du Poitou, du Jeudi, 10. Fevrier 1774.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Abbé Roubaud, author of the <HI>Gazette

existence of this animal as a native of France.

In the month of April 1775, he sent me a genet
that he had killed at Livray in Poitou, and which,
excepting some variations in the colour of the
hair, was the same with the Spanish genet.
This animal is likewise found in the neighbour∣ing
provinces.</P>
<P>“For these thirty years that I have lived in
the province of Rouergue,' says M. Delpeche,
it has been a constant practice among our pea∣sants
to bring dead genets every winter to a
certain merchant of this place, who told me
that they were not numerous, but that they
live in the neighbourhood of Villefranche, and
burrow, during the winter, in holes, like rab∣bits.

<P>We have given a figure of a female genet,
which differs so much from the female formerly
represented, as to merit a particular description.
It was shown at the fair of St Germain in the
year 1772. It was fierce, and endeavoured to
bite. It was kept in a narrow, roundish cage,
which rendered it difficult to be drawn. It was
fed with flesh, and had the physiognomy, and
all the principal characters of the genet formerly
represented. The head was long and slender;
the muzzle was also long, and advanced beyond
the under jaw. The eye was large, with a nar∣row
pupil. The ears were round; and the hair
of the head and body was spotted. The tail was
<PB N="258" REF="301"/>
long and bushy. This animal was somewhat
thicker than the former. The latter, indeed,
was young, for it grew considerably larger in
three or four months: We could not learn from
what country it had been brought: His keeper
had purchased it, seven or eight months before,
in London. It was in perpetual motion, never
resting, except during the time it slept.</P>
<P>The genet now under consideration was twen∣ty
inches long, and seven inches and a half high.
The upper part of the neck was more bushy than
that of the former genet, whose hair was all of
an equal length. The circular bars on the tail
are less distinct, and, indeed, extend not farther
than about one third part of the tail. The
whiskers are black, and much longer, being two
inches seven lines long, and lie upon the cheeks,
instead of being erect, as in the cats and tigers.
The nose is black, and the nostrils very much
arched. Above the nose there is a black line,
which extends to between the eyes, and is ac∣companied
by two white bands. Above the
eyes there is a white spot, and a white band be∣low
them. The ears are black, but longer and
narrower at the base than those of the first genet.
The hair of the body is of a whitish gray colour,
mixed with large black hairs, which being re∣flected,
seem to form a kind of black undulations.
The upper part of the back is striped and spot∣ted
with black; the rest of the body is marked
in the same manner, but the black is fainter.

<P>THOUGH these two animals have received
the same denomination of <HI>musk rats,</HI> and
have some common characters, they ought not
<PB N="261" REF="306"/>
to be confounded. They should likewise be di∣stinguished
from the pilori, or musk rat of
the Antilles: They all form different species, and
belong to different climates; the first being found
in Canada, the second in Lapland and Muscovy,
and the last in Martinico, and other Antilles
islands.</P>
<P>The Canadian musk rat differs from the Mus∣covian,
by having all its toes separate, conspicu∣ous
eyes, and a very short muzzle. But the
musk rat of Muscovy has the toes of the hind
feet webbed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oculi exigui et vix conspicui. … Digiti majores mem∣branis connexi ad commodiùs natandum, rostri pars superior firma, prominula, et paene unciam longa, nigricans, eâque formâ praedita, ut instar suis aut talpae terram vertere possit; <HI>Clusii exotic. auct. p.</HI> 375.</NOTE>, very small eyes, and a long
muzzle, like that of the shrew mouse. Both
have long compressed tails, and differ from the
musk rat of the Antilles in this and several o∣ther
characters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The musk rats of the Antilles, called by the French <HI>piloris,</HI> generally burrow under ground, like the rabbits, and are nearly of the same size; but they have no resemblance to our large rats, excepting that they are white on the belly, and black or tawny on the rest of the body. They smell so strong of musk, that their retreats are easily discovered by the per∣sume; <HI>Hist. Nat. des Antilles, p.</HI> 124.</NOTE>. The latter has a very short
<PB N="262" REF="307"/>
tail, which is cylindrical<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The piloris are a species of wood rats, three or four times larger than the common kind. They are almost white; they have a very short tail; and smell strongly of musk; <HI>Nouv. Voy. aux Isles de l'Amerique, tom. 1. p.</HI> 438. The piloris are found in Martinico and some of the other Antilles. They are musk rats, of the same figure with the common rat, but so large, that four of our rats would not weigh a single pi∣lori. … They nestle even in the huts; but are not so proli∣fic as the common rat. … The piloris are natives of Mar∣tinico; but the common rat never appeared there till it was frequented by ships; <HI>Hist. gen. des Antilles, par le P. Tertre, tom. 2. p.</HI> 302.</NOTE>, like that of the com∣mon
rat. But both of the former have very
long tails. The head of the Canadian musk rat
resembles that of the water rat, and the head of
the Muscovy kind resembles that of the shrew
mouse.</P>
<P>In the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences,
ann. 1725, there is a very complete description
of the Canadian musk rat. M. Sarrasin, King's
physician at Quebec, and correspondent of the
academy, has dissected a number of these animals,
and made some singular remarks. By comparing
his description with ours, we are persuaded that
the musk rat of Canada is the same animal
whose figure is here represented.</P>
<P>The Canadian musk rat is of the size of a
small rabbit, and of the figure of a rat. Its head
is short, and resembles that of the water rat.
<PB N="263" REF="308"/>
Its hair is soft and glossy; and, beneath the first
hair, there is a thick down, nearly like that of
the beaver. Like other rats, its tail is long, and
covered with scales; but its form is different;
for, instead of being cylindrical, it is compressed
laterally from the middle to the extremity, and
roundish near the origin. The toes are not u∣nited
by membranes, but garnished with long
close hair, which assists the animal in swimming.
Its ears are very short, and not naked, as in the
common rat, but covered, both internally and
externally, with hair. The eyes are large, their
aperture being about three lines. In the under
jaw there are two cutting teeth, about an inch
long, and two shorter ones in the upper. These
four teeth are very strong, and serve the animal
for gnawing and cutting wood.</P>
<P>The singularities observed in this animal by
M. Sarrasin are, 1. The great muscular force in
its skin, which enables the creature to contract
its body into a small volume: 2. The suppleness
of the false ribs, which admits this contraction,
and is so considerable, that the musk rat is
enabled to pass through holes where much smal∣ler
animals cannot enter: 3. The manner in
which the females discharge their urine; for
the urethra terminates not, as in other quadru∣peds,
under the clitoris, but at a hairy eminence
above the os pubis; and in this eminence there
is an aperture that allows the urine to escape.
This singular organization is peculiar to a few
<PB N="264" REF="309"/>
species of animals, as the rats and apes, the fe∣males
of which have three apertures. It has
been remarked, that the beaver is the only qua∣druped
whose urine and excrement are dischar∣ged
by a common aperture. The female rats
and apes are, perhaps, the only animals who
discharge their urine by an aperture separated
from the organs of generation. But this singu∣larity
is confined to the females, the structure of
the males being the same with that of other qua∣drupeds.
4. M. Sarrasin farther remarks, that
the testicles, which, as in other rats, are situated
on each side of the anus, become, in the rutting
season, very large in proportion to the size of
the animal, their bulk being often equal to that
of a nutmeg; but that, after this season, they di∣minish
so greatly as not to exceed a line in di∣ameter;
and that they not only undergo a change
of size, consistence, and colour, but even their
situation is remarkably varied. In the same
manner, after the season of love, the seminal
vessels, the vasa deferentia, and all the organs of
generation, are almost entirely obliterated: The
testicles, which, during this period, were exter∣nal,
and very prominent, retire within the body.
They are sixed, like the other parts just men∣tioned,
to the membrana adiposa. This mem∣brane,
by the redundant nourishment, gradually
expands and increases till the arrival of the rut∣ting
season, when the organs of generation,
which seem to be appendages of the membrane,
<PB N="265" REF="310"/>
unfold, swell, and acquire their complete di∣mensions.
But, when the redundant nourish∣ment
is exhausted by reiterated embraces, the
membrane turns meagre, contracts, and gradu∣ally
retires toward the reins, carrying along with
it the vasa deferentia, the seminal vessels, and
the testicles, which last become so light, empty,
and shrivelled, as hardly to be distinguishable. In
the same manner, the seminal vessels, which,
at the commencement of the rutting season, are
an inch and a half long, are afterwards reduced
to a line or two in diameter: 5. That the folli∣cles
which contain the perfume of this animal in
the form of a milky humour, and which are si∣tuated
near the organs of generation, undergo
the same changes. In the rutting season, they
are large and turgid, and their perfume is so
strong and highly exalted, that it is perceptible
at a great distance. They afterwards contract,
shrivel, and at last entirely disappear. This
change in the follicles, which contain the per∣fume,
is more rapid and complete than that
which happens to the organs of generation.
These follicles are common to both sexes, and,
in the rutting season, contain a considerable quan∣tity
of milky humour, secreted by vessels, which,
in the male, terminate at the extremity of the
penis, and towards the clitoris in the female.
This secretion is performed, and the humour eva∣cuated
nearly at the same place as the urine in
other quadrupeds.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="311"/>
All these peculiarities remarked by M. Sarra∣sin,
were worthy the attention of so able an ana∣tomist.
In the history of the water rat, the
mole, and short-tailed field mouse, we have men∣tioned
similar changes in the organs of gene∣ration.
Thus we find quadrupeds, though in
their general structure they resemble the other
animals of the same class; whose organs of ge∣neration
are annually obliterated and renewed,
nearly in the same manner as the milts of fishes,
and the seminal vessels of the calmar, whose
changes, annihilation, and reproduction have
been formerly described<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. II. p. 186.</NOTE>. These shades by
which Nature connects beings apparently the far∣thest
removed from each other, these singular
examples, should never be neglected; because
they belong to the general system of organiza∣tion,
and unite the most distant points of ani∣mated
bodies. But this is not the place for ex∣patiating
on the general conclusions which might
be drawn from these singular facts, nor on the
close connection they have with our theory of
generation. They will be anticipated by the
intelligent reader; and we shall soon have occa∣sion
to exhibit them to greater advantage, by add∣ing
them to other facts of a similar nature.</P>
<P>As the Canadian musk rat belongs to the same
country with the beaver, dwells on the water,
and has nearly the same figure, colour, and fur,
they have often been compared to each other.
<PB N="267" REF="312"/>
It is even asserted, that a full grown musk rat,
at first sight, maybe mistaken for a beaver of a
month old. They differ greatly, however, in
the form of the tail, which, in the beaver, is oval
and flat horizontally; but, in the musk rat, it is
very long and flat, or compressed vertically. Be∣sides,
these animals have a great resemblance in
their dispositions and instincts. The musk rats,
like the beavers, live in society during the win∣ter.
They make little huts, about two feet and
a half in diameter, and sometimes larger, where
several families associate together. It is not the
object of this operation, like that of the mar∣mots,
to sleep during five or six months, but
solely to shelter them from the rigour of the air.
These houses, or huts, are round, and covered
with a dome about a foot thick. Their materi∣als
are herbs and rushes interlaced, and cement∣ed
with earth, which they plash with their feet.
They are impenetrable to rain, and furnished
with steps in the inside, to prevent their being
injured by inundations from the land. These
huts, which serve the animals for a retreat, are
covered, during winter, with several feet of snow
and ice, without incommoding them. They lay
not up provisions, like the beaver, but dig a kind
of pits or passages under and round their habi∣tations,
to give them an opportunity of procu∣ring
water and roots. Though thus associated,
they pass the winter in melancholy; for it is not
the season of their amours. During all this pe∣riod,
<PB N="268" REF="313"/>
they are deprived of light; and, when the
gentle breezes of the spring begin to dissolve the
snow, and to discover the tops of their habita∣tions,
the hunters open the dome, suddenly
dazzle them with the light, and kill or seize all
those who have not had time to retire to their
subterraneous galleries, into which they are still
followed; for their skin is valuable, and their flesh
makes tolerably good eating. Those who escape
the vigilance of the hunter quit their habitations
at this time. They wander about during
summer, but always in pairs; because it is the
season of their amours. They feed upon herbs,
and voraciously devour the fresh productions of
the earth. By this redundance of excellent nou∣rishment,
the membrana adiposa expands, in∣creases,
and is filled with fat; the follicles are al∣so
renewed and filled; the organs of generation
unfold and swell; and then the animals acquire
an odour of musk, so strong as to be hardly sup∣portable.
This odour is perceived at a distance;
and, though agreeable to Europeans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The musk rat of North America is somewhat thicker and longer than our water rat. Water is its element; but it sometimes goes upon land. It has a flat tail, from eight to ten inches long, an inch broad, and covered with small black scales. Its skin is reddish, and the fur very fine. Near the testicles. there is a matter which has a most agreeable smell of musk, and does not incommode those to whom musk is of∣fensive. In winter, when they are killed for the sake of their fur, they have no odour; but it begins to be perceptible in spring, and continues strong till autumn… The flesh, which has no flavour of musk, makes excellent food; <HI>Descript. de l'Amer.

<PB N="269" REF="314"/>
to the savages, that they have denomina∣ted
a river, inhabited by a vast number of these
rats, the <HI>Stinking River.</HI></P>
<P>The females bring forth annually five or six
young. Their time of gestation is not long;
because they come in season in the beginning of
summer, and the young are pretty large in the
month of October, when they retire with their
parents into the huts, which are built every year;
for, it has been remarked, that they never return
to their old habitations. Their cry is a kind of
groaning, which the hunter counterfeits, in order
to make them approach him. Their fore-teeth
are so strong, and so proper for cutting, that,
when shut up in a box of hard wood, they soon
make a hole sufficient for their escape, which is
a faculty they have in common with the beaver.
They swim neither so swift nor so long as the
beaver; but often go upon the ground. They
do not run well, and they walk still worse, rock∣ing
from side to side, like a goose. Their skin
preserves the smell of musk, which renders their
fur not so generally agreeable; but the down,
or under hair, is used in the manufacturing of
hats.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="315"/>
These animals are not remarkably wild, and,
when taken young, are easily tamed. They are
then very pretty; and their tail, which is long
and flat, and makes their figure disagreeable, is,
at this period of life, very short. They sport
with as much innocence and gentleness as young
cats. They never bite<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The musk rats of Canada, called <HI>ondathra</HI> by the Hurons, eat herbs, and the pith of rushes about the lakes and rivers. When young, it is pleasant to see them eat and perform their little gambols. I had a very pretty one, which I fed with the pith of rushes, and an herb similar to the dandelion. They are not liable to bite; for I handled mine at pleasure, without the smallest danger of injury; <HI>Voyage de Sagard Theodat. p.</HI> 322.—The plant, which M. Sarrasin says the musk rat prefers to all others, is the <HI>calamus aromaticus.</HI></NOTE>, and might be easily

<P>The musk rat of Muscovy would, perhaps,
exhibit to us peculiarities similar to those of the
Canadian; but it seems not to have been dis∣sected,
or examined alive, by any naturalist. We
can only mention its external form, that preser∣ved
in the King's cabinet having been sent from
Lapland in a dry state. We must, therefore,
regret that so little is known of this animal.</P>

<P>OF all the animals in the New World, the
Mexican Hog is the most numerous and
most remarkable species. At first sight, he re∣sembles
our wild boar, or rather the hog of Siam,
<PB N="272" REF="319"/>
which, as formerly remarked, is only a variety
of the wild boar. In the same manner, the Mex∣ican
hog has been called the <HI>boar,</HI> or <HI>hog of Ame∣rica.</HI>
He constitutes, however, a different spe∣cies;
for, from repeated trials, it has been found,
that he does not intermix either with our wild
or domestic kinds. He likewise differs from the
hog in several essential characters, both external
and internal. He is not so corpulent, and his
legs are shorter. The form of his stomach and
intestines is also different. He has no tail. His
bristles are much coarser than those of the wild
boar. Lastly, on his back, near the crupper,
there is an orifice about three lines broad, and
more than an inch deep, from which an ichorous
humour, of a very disagreeable smell, flows very
copiously. No other animal has an aperture in
this region of the body. The civets, the badger,
<PB N="273" REF="320"/>
and the genet have the reservoir of their per∣fume
under the organs of generation; and the
Canadian musk rat, and the musk animal, have
it under the belly. The liquor which issues
from the dorsal aperture of the Mexican hog is
secreted by a number of large glands, which are
well described by M. Daubenton, and by Dr
Tyson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. No 153.</NOTE>. It is unnecessary to give in detail the
observations of these acute anatomists. It shall
only be remarked, that Dr Tyson is wrong in
asserting that this animal has three stomachs, or,
as Mr Ray<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Raii Synops. quad. p. 99.</NOTE>, expresses it, a gizzard and two sto∣machs.
M. Daubenton has clearly demonstra∣ted,
that it has but one stomach, divided by two
strangulations, which give it he appearance of
three; that only one of these three bags has a
pylorus, or aperture for allowing the descent of
the aliment into the other intestines; and, con∣sequently,
that the other two should be regarded
as appendages, or rather portions, of the same
stomach.</P>
<P>The Mexican hog might be rendered dome∣stic,
as well as the common kind. He is nearly
of the same dispositions, feeds upon the same
nourishment, and his flesh, though drier, and less
loaded with fat, is by no means disagreeable. It
is likewise improved by castration; but, when
his flesh is intended to be eaten, not only the or∣gans
of generation, as is practised on the wild
<PB N="274" REF="321"/>
boar, but the whole dorsal glands of both male
and female should be cut off instantly after death;
for the retention of them for a single half hour
gives the meat an odour so strong as to render
it uneatable.</P>
<P>These animals are very numerous in all the
warm climates of South America. They go in
herds, which sometimes amount to two or three
hundred. For defending themselves, and repel∣ling
those who want to deprive them of their
young, they are endowed with the same instincts
as the common hog. They mutually assist each
other; they surround their enemies, and often
wound the dogs and the hunters. In their na∣tive
country, they prefer the mountains to the
plains. They search not for marshes and mires,
like our wild boar, but remain in the forests,
where they live upon fruits, seeds, and roots.
They likewise eat serpents, toads, and lizards,
whose skins they previously tear off with their
feet. They produce a great number at a time,
and, perhaps, more than once a-year. The young
soon follow their mother, and never separate from
her till they are full grown. When taken young,
they are easily tamed; they lose their natural fe∣rocity,
but retain their stupidity; for they know
no person, and have no attachment to those who
take care of them. They do no mischief, and
may be allowed to go and come at pleasure, with∣out
any inconvenience. They never stray, but
return home spontaneously; and they never
<PB N="275" REF="322"/>
quarrel, but when a number of them are present∣ed
with victuals in the same trough. When
angry, their grunting is stronger and harder than
that of the common hog; but they seldom cry.
Like the wild boar, when suddenly alarmed, they
make a sharp blowing kind of noise. Their
breath is very strong; and, when irritated, their
hair rises, which is so coarse, that it rather re∣sembles
the prickles of a hedgehog than the bri∣stles
of the wild boar.</P>
<P>The species of the Mexican hog is preserved
without any change; for they never intermix
with those hogs which were transported from
Europe, and have become wild in America.
These animals often meet in the woods, and e∣ven
go in company, without producing any new
variety. The same observation applies to the
Guiney hog, which has multiplied greatly in A∣merica,
after being brought thither from Africa.
The European hog, the Guiney hog, and the
Mexican hog, are three species, which, though
they seem to approach very near each other, are
perfectly distinct, since they all subsist in the
same climate, without change or intermixture.
Our wild boar is the strongest and most formi∣dable
of the three. The Mexican hog is equally
ferocious; but he is weaker, more unwiedly,
and worse armed, his tusks being much shorter
than those of the wild boar. The former is im∣patient
of cold, and cannot subsist, even in our
temperate climates, without being sheltered;
<PB N="276" REF="323"/>
and the wild boar cannot subsist in very cold
countries. Hence neither of these animals could
pass from the one Continent to the other by the
lands lying toward the north pole; and, there∣fore,
the Mexican hog cannot be regarded as the
European hog altered or degenerated, by the in∣fluence
of the American climates, but as an ani∣mal
peculiar to the southern regions of the New
World.</P>
<P>Ray, and other authors, maintain, that the li∣quor
secreted by the dorsal glands of the Mexi∣can
hog, is a kind of musk, an agreeable per∣fume,
even when it issues from the body of the
animal; that it is perceived at a great distance; and
that it perfumes the places where he inhabits, or
through which he passes. But, on the contrary,
I have a thousand times experienced, that the
odour of this liquor, when it escapes from the ani∣mal,
is so nauscous, that we could neither smell
nor collect it without extreme disgust. It seems
only to become less fetid by drying in the air;
but it never assumes the agreeable odour of musk
or of civet; and naturalists would have made a
nearer approach to truth, if they had compared
it to that of <HI>castor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um.</HI></P>

hog, which never intermix. The largest
kind, says he, has white hair on its chops; and,
on each side of the jaw, there is a round white
spot, of the size of a small crown-piece. The
rest of the body is black; and the animal weighs
about one hundred pounds. The smaller species
has reddish hair, and weighs not above sixty
pounds.</P>
<P>It is the large species which is here represented.
And, with regard to the smaller kind, the differ∣ence
of colour and size, mentioned by M. de la
Borde, must be only a variety produced by age,
or some other accidental circumstance.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde, however, says, that the large
kind runs not, like the small, after dogs and
men. He adds, that both species inhabit the
large woods, and that they go in flocks of two
or three hundred. They feed on the mountains
during the rainy season; and, when it is past,
they frequent the low and marshy grounds.
They feed upon fruits, seeds, and roots, and like∣wise
dig in the mires, in quest of worms and o∣ther
insects. They are hunted without dogs,
by following the track of their feet. They are
easily shot; for, instead of flying, they assemble
together, and often give the hunters an oppor∣tunity
of charging and discharging several times.
They pursue the dogs, and sometimes men. He
relates, that, being one day employed, along with
several others, in hunting these animals, accom∣panied
by a single dog, which, as soon as they
<PB N="278" REF="327"/>
appeared, took refuge between his master's legs.
For the greater safety, he, with the other hunters,
stood on a rock. They were, nevertheless, sur∣rounded
by the flock of hogs. A constant fire
was kept up; but the creatures did not retire till
a great number of them was slain. These ani∣mals,
however, he remarks, fly after they have
been several times hunted. The young, when
taken in the chace, are easily tamed; but they
will not associate or mix with the domestic spe∣cies.
In their natural state of liberty, they fre∣quent
the marshes, and often swim across large
rivers. They make great havock in the planta∣tions.
Their flesh, says he, has an excellent
taste, but is not so tender as that of the domestic
hog; it resembles the flesh of the hare, and has
neither lard nor grease. The females bring forth
only two at a litter; but they produce in all
seasons. When killed, the dorsal gland should
be instantly cut out, otherwise it will give a bad
flavour to the meat.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde mentions another species of
hog, which he calls <HI>patira,</HI> and is also found in
Guiana. I shall transcribe what he remarks of
this animal, solely with the view that he, or
some other observer, may furnish us with more
precise information, and a more complete descrip∣tion
of it.</P>
<P>“The patira is of the size of the smaller spe∣cies
of Mexican hog; and differs from it only
<PB N="279" REF="328"/>
by having a white line along the spine from
the neck to the tail.”</P>
<P>“These animals live in the large forests, from
which they never depart. They associate not
in large flocks, but in families. They are,
however, very common, and never leave their
native country. They are hunted with or
without dogs. When pursued by dogs, they
stand firm, and defend themselves with cou∣rage.
They take refuge is hollow trees, or in
holes of the earth dug by the armadillos. These
holes they enter backwards; and remain as long
as they can: But, when highly irritated, they
instantly issue out in a body. In order to seize
them as they come out, the hole is inclosed
with branches of trees; one of the hunters,
armed with a pitchfork, stands above the hole
to fix them by the neck, while another forces
them out, and kills them with a sabre.”</P>
<P>“When there is but one in a hole, and the
hunter has not leisure to seize it, he shuts up
the entrance, and is sure of his game next day.
The flesh of the patira is superiour to that of o∣ther
hogs. When taken young, they are ea∣sily
tamed; but they have a mortal anitpathy
to dogs, whom they perpetually attack. The
females bring forth only two at a time; and
they are fit for procreating in every season of
the year. They keep always in the marshes,
unless when totally covered with water.”</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="329"/>
“The hair of the patira is not so hard as that
of the wild boar, or domestic hog, but is soft
and flexible like that of the pecari. The pa∣tira,
when tamed, follows his master, and al∣lows
himself to be handled by those with whom
he is acquainted; but strangers he threatens
with his head and teeth.”</P>

<HEAD>THE TERNAT BAT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The bats, or winged quadrupeds, are distinguished from all other animals, by having long toes on the fore-feet, connect∣ed by thin broad membranes, extending to the hind-legs.</P>
<P>The great or Ternat bat has large canine teeth, four cutting teeth above, and an equal number below, a sharp black nose, and large naked ears. The tongue is pointed, and terminated by sharp aculeated papillae. The exterior toe is detached from the membrane, and the claw is strong and hooked. There are five toes on the hind-feet; the talons are very crooked, strong, and compressed sidewise. It has no tail: The membrane is divided behind quite to the rump. The head is of a dark fer∣ruginous colour: On the neck, shoulders, and underside, the red is much lighter and brighter. On the back, the hair is shorter, dusky and smooth. The membranes of the wings are dusky. They vary in colour; some are entirely of a reddish brown, others dusky. This now described was one foot long, and the extent of the wings, from tip to tip, was four feet. But they are found vastly larger; <HI>Pennant's Synops. of quad. p.</HI> 359.</P>

<P>THOUGH the two Ternat bats appear to
be distinct species, we have placed them
together, because of their great resemblance; for
they differ only in magnitude and colour. The lar∣ger,
<PB N="282" REF="331"/>
whose hair is of a reddish brown colour, is
nine inches long from the end of the muzzle to
<PB N="283" REF="332"/>
the extremity of the body; and the wings, when
extended, are three feet from tip to tip; and
the lesser, whose hair is of a cinereous brown
colour, exceeds not five and a half inches in
length, and the wings extend not above two
feet; and it has on the neck a half-collar of a
lively red, mixed with orange, of which there is
no vestige in the larger kind. Both belong near∣ly
to the same warm climates of the Old World,
being found in Madagascar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the island of Madagascar, &amp;c. the bats are as large as hens, and so numerous that they frequently darken the air. Their cry is frightful; <HI>Voyage de Madagascar, par de V. p.</HI> 83. 245.</NOTE>, Mauritius, Ter∣nat,
the Phillipines, and other islands of the
Indian Archipelago, where they seem to be more
common than on the adjacent Continents.</P>
<P>In the warm countries of the New World,
there is another flying quadruped, the American
name of which we have not learned. We shall
call it <HI>Vampire,</HI> because it sucks the blood of men
and other animals when asleep, without occa∣sioning
pain sufficient to waken them. This A∣merican
animal is of a different species from the
two Ternat bats, both of which are peculiar to
Africa and the South of Asia. The vampire is
smaller than either of the Ternat bats. The
first, when it flies, appears to be of the size of a
pigeon; the lesser Ternat bat is of the size
<PB N="284" REF="333"/>
of a crow, and the larger is as big as a large hen.
Both Ternat bats have well formed heads, short
ears, and rounded muzzles, nearly resembling
that of a dog. The muzzle of the vampire, on
the contrary, is longer; its aspect is equally hi∣deous
as that of the most ugly bats; its head is
ill shaped; and its ears are large, open, and very
erect. It has a deformed nose, the nostrils be∣ing
of the shape of a funnel, with a membrane
above them, which is elevated like a horn or
painted crest, and adds greatly to the deformity
of its countenance. Hence it is apparent, that
this species is totally different from the Ter∣nat
bats. The vampire is not more remark∣able
for its deformity than its mischief. Of this
we have the recent and authentic testimony of
M. de la Condamine: “The bats,” says he,
“which suck the blood of horses, mules, and
even of men, if they do not sleep under the
shelter of a house or tent, are a common scourge
to most of the warm countries of America.
Some of them are of a monstrous size. At
Borja, and several other places, they have en∣tirely
destroyed the cattle which had been in∣trodced
there by the missionaries, and begun
to multiply<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de la riviere des Amazones, par M. de la Conda∣mine, p. 171.</NOTE>.” These facts are confirmed by
several other historians and travellers. P. Mar∣tyr<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Dariene, novi orbis regione, Hispani noctu vespertilionum morsibus torquebantur, quae si dormientem forte momorderint quempiam, exhausto sanguine trahunt in vitae discrimen, et mortuos fuisse nonnullos ex ea tabe compertum est; <HI>Petrus Martyr,</HI> Oceani decadis tertiae lib. 6.</NOTE>,
who wrote soon after the conquest of
<PB N="285" REF="334"/>
South America, says, that, in the Isthmus of Da∣rien,
there are bats which suck the blood of men
and cattle, when asleep, to such a degree as to
weaken and even kill them. This fact is
likewise affirmed by Jumilla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In South America, the bats are incredibly troublesome. There are two kinds, one of the size of those we see in Spain; the other so large, that the wings extend three quarters of a yard. Both are dexterous blood-suckers, and fly about during the night in quest of men and cattle. If those who are obliged to sleep on the ground do not cover themselves from head to foot, which is very inconvenient in these warm regions, they are certain of being pierced by the bats. With regard to those who sleep in houses, with their front only uncovered, they are infallibly bit; and, if these animals strike a vein, the unfortunate person often passes insensibly from sleep to death by the loss of blood, so subtile is the wound inflicted: Besides, by fanning the air with their wings, they refresh the sleeper whom they mean to deprive of life; <HI>Hist. Nat. de l'Orenoque, par le Père Iumilla, tom. 3. p.</HI> 100.</NOTE>, as well as Don
George Juan, and Don Antoine de Ulloa<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bats are very numerous at Carthagena; they bleed the inha∣bitants so dexterously, and without wakening them, as to enfeeble them extremely; <HI>Biblioth, raisonnée, tom. 44. p.</HI> 409.</NOTE>.
Though it appears, from these authorities, that
the blood-sucking bats are very common in all
South America, we have never hitherto been
able to procure a single individual. But Seba
has given a figure and description of this ani∣mal,
whose nose is so extraordinary, that it is
surprising such a conspicuous deformity should
not have been taken notice of by travellers. The
<PB N="286" REF="335"/>
strange animal described by Seba, may not be
the vampire or blood-sucker. Seba's figure may
be erroneous; and the deformed nose may be
only an accidental monstrosity, though there are
examples of similar and permanent deformities
in other species of bats. Time alone can remove
these uncertainties.</P>
<P>Both the Ternat bats are in the Royal cabi∣net,
and were brought from the isle of Bour∣bon.
They are peculiar to the Old Continent,
and are no where so numerous in Africa and
Asia, as the vampire is in America. These ani∣mals
are larger, stronger, and perhaps more
mischievous than the vampire. But their destruc∣tion
is executed by open force, both during the
day and night. They kill poultry and small
birds: They attack men, and often wound
them in the face. But no travellers mentions
their sucking the blood of men or cattle, when
asleep.</P>
<P>The antients had an imperfect knowledge of
these winged quadrupeds, which are a kind of
monsters; and it is probable, that, from such bi∣zarre
models of nature, they had conceived the
idea of harpies. The wings, the teeth, the
claws, the cruelty, the voracity, the filthiness,
and every other deformity and destructive qua∣lity
ascribed to the harpies, correspond very
well with our Ternat bats. Herodotus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herodot. lib. 3. It is singular, that Pliny, who has re∣lated so many marvellous stories, should here accuse Hero∣dotus of falshood, and treat the sact of bats attacking men, as a mere fable of antiquity.</NOTE> ap∣pears
<PB N="287" REF="336"/>
to point them out, when he says, that
there were large bats which were extremely
troublesome to the people who gather cassia a∣round
the marshes of Asia; and that they were
obliged to cover their bodies and faces with
leather, to defend themselves against the dange∣rous
bites of these animals. Strabo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Mesopotamia, inter Euphratis conversiones, est maxima verspertilionum multitudo, qui longe majores sunt quam in caeteris locis. Capiuntur, et in esum condiuntur; <HI>Strabo, lib.</HI> 16.</NOTE> speaks of
large bats in Mesopotamia, whose flesh made
good eating. Among the moderns, Albertus,
Isidorus, and Scaliger, mention these large bats
in a vague manner. Linscot, Nicolas Matthias<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nicolus Matthias, in a work printed at Visurgbourg, in Sweden, says, p. 123. that these large bats fly in flocks du∣ring the night; that they drink the juice of the palm-trees in such quantities as render them intoxicated, and make them fall, as if they were dead, at the roots of the trees; that he siezed one in this condition, and having nailed it to a wall, it gnawed and rounded the nails with its teeth, as if they had been filed. He adds, that its muzzle resembles that of a fox.</NOTE>,
and Francis Pyrard<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the island of St Laurence and in the Maldiva islands, there are bats as large as crows; <HI>Voyage de Pyrard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 38. 132.—In Malabar, the bats fly at noon-day; they are as large as cats, and people eat them without reluctance; <HI>Biblioth▪ raisonnée, tom. 32. p.</HI> 194.</NOTE> have made more particular

He says, that each of them were of the size of a large crow; that they were a foot long: and that the length of the penis was two inches. He adds, after Linscot, that they are eaten by the Indians, who thought them as delicate as partidges.</NOTE> has
<PB N="288" REF="337"/>
given a short description, and a figure of them.
Lastly, descriptions and good figures of these
animals, which correspond with our specimens,
are to be found in Seba and Edwards.</P>
<P>The Ternat bats are carnivorous animals,
and so voracious, that they eat every thing;
for, when flesh or fish fail them, they feed up∣on
vegetables, and fruits of all kinds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Manilla islands, we find an infinity of large bats hanging attached to each other upon the trees. They take flight in the evening, and go in quest of food to the distant woods. They sometimes fly in such numbers, and so close, that they darken the air with their wings, which are often six palms in extent. They know how to distinguish, in the thickest woods, the trees which bear ripe fruit. These they devour, during the night, making a noise that may be heard at the distance of two miles, and return, at day-break, to their retreats. The Indians, who see these animals eating their best fruits, make war against them, not only to gratify re∣venge, but to feed upon their flesh, which they say tastes like that of a rabbit; <HI>Hist. gen. des voyages, par M. l'Abbé Prevost, tom. 10. p.</HI> 389.</NOTE>. They
drink the juice of the palm-tree; and it is ea∣sy
to intoxicate and sieze them, by placing near
their retreats vessels filled with palm-water, or
some other fermented liquor. They attach and
suspend themselves to the trees by their claws.
They generally fly in flocks, and more frequent∣ly
in the night than the day. They avoid places
frequented by men, and dwell in the deserts,
particularly in uninhabited islands. They co∣pulate
<PB N="289" REF="338"/>
with ardour. The sex in the male
is very conspicuous. The penis is not conceal∣ed
in a sheath, like that of quadrupeds, but
hangs out of the body, like that of the mon∣key<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In hoc animali uterque sexus dignoscebatur: Nam eorum aliquot, qui mihi conspecti sunt, satis longum exertumque penem habebant, quales sere simiarum est; <HI>Carol. Clusii. Exotic. tom. 2. pag.</HI> 94.</NOTE>.
The sex of the females is also very ap∣parent.
They have only two paps placed on
the breast, and they produce few at a litter,
but oftener than once a year. The flesh of these
animals, when young, is not bad to eat; the
Indians compare the taste of it to that of a par∣tridge
or rabbit.</P>
<P>All travellers through America agree, that the
large bats of the New Continent have the facul∣ty
of sucking the blood of sleeping men and
cattle, without wakening them. The travellers
into Asia or Africa, who mention the Ternat
bats, take no notice of this singular fact. Their
silence, however, amounts not to a complete
proof, especially as these creatures have so many
other resemblances to the American vampires.
We, therefore, thought it worthy of examina∣tion,
whether the Ternat bats, (for we have
not been able to procure the tongue of a vam∣pire),
could possibly suck blood, without occa∣sioning
a pain sufficient to waken a sleeping
person. If they cut the flesh with their teeth,
which are as large as those of other quadrupeds
of the same size, a man in the most profound
<PB N="290" REF="339"/>
sleep, and particularly cattle, whose sleep is much
lighter, would be instantly roused by the pain.
The same thing would happen, if the wound
was made by their claws. Hence it must be
with their tongue alone that they are enabled to
make such small apertures in the skin as to per∣mit
the blood to be extracted from the veins,
without occasioning a great degree of pain. Up∣on
examination, M. Daubenton discovered that
the tongue of the Ternat bats was pointed,
and armed with very hard, minute, sharp pa∣pillae,
which are bended backwards: These
may be insinuated into the pores of the skin, and
penetrate so far as to make a stream of blood
flow by the constant suction of the tongue.
But it is fruitless to reason upon a fact, all the
circumstances of which are not understood, and
some of them, perhaps, exaggerated or unskil∣fully
related.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I find, from a note communicated by M.
Commerson, that he had seen, in the isle of
Bourbon, millions of those large or Ternat bats,
which, in the evenings, fly in flocks like crows,
and perch upon trees, particularly the <HI>vaccoun,</HI>
to eat the fruit. He adds, that, when taken
<PB N="291" REF="340"/>
young, they make good food, the taste of the
flesh resembling that of the hare, and being
equally black.</P>
<P>The late M. de la Nux, since the publication
of my work, sent me, from the same island, some
excellent remarks upon what I had written con∣cerning
these animals. His letter, of which the
following are extracts, is dated October 24.
1772.</P>
<P>“In your letter of the 8th March 1770, you
declare that you are equally happy to be in∣formed
of truth, or to have your own errors
corrected, and invite me to communicate my
thoughts are remarks with the utmost free∣dom.
I accept of the invitation, and am only
afraid lest I should tire you by prolixity. With
regard to the great or Ternat bats, to combat
errors which have been long received, requires
a variety of evidence. These animals, it would
appear, have only been examined with the
eye of fear: They have been regarded as ugly
and monstrous; and therefore, without far∣ther
examination than a bare inspection of
their figure, they have received a character,
manners, and habits, which do not belong to
them; as if mischievousness, ferocity, and dir∣tiness
were inseparable from ugliness of a∣spect.”</P>
<P>M. de la Nux remarks, that, in my descrip∣tion,
p. 283. both the size and number of the
great Ternat bats are exaggerated; that there
<PB N="292" REF="341"/>
is nothing frightful in their cry; that it re∣sembles
the hoarse noise made by a man when
he opens his mouth, contracts the wind-pipe,
and makes several forcible expirations and respi∣rations;
and that, when these animals are at
rest on a tree, they make a gentle kind of mur∣muring,
which is not disagreeable.</P>
<P>“P. 61. Pliny with reason,” continues our
author, “treats the narrative of Herodotus as
fabulous. The Ternat bats, at least in the
islands, instead of attacking men, uniformly
avoid them. They bite cruelly, but only when
defending themselves from blows, or when
they are seized; so that, whoever is wound∣ed
by them must ascribe their misfortune
to their own want of address, and not to
the ferocity of an animal that has no such
quality.”</P>
<P>“P. 286. 287. Notes. Here the size of the
great Ternat bat approaches nearer to the
truth. … <HI>In Malabar, the bats fly at
noon-day.</HI> This is true of the larger, but not
of the lesser Ternat bats. The former fly
not in troops during the day, but singly, when
they mount very high, which greatly diminish∣es
their apparent magnitude. They fly long
without stopping, and I believe that they can
pass from the isle of Bourbon to the isle of
France, a distance of at least thirty leagues, in
a very short time. They never hover, like
birds of prey. But, in the great elevation of
<PB N="293" REF="342"/>
perhaps two hundred fathoms above the sur∣face
of the earth, the motion of their wings,
which is rapid when near the ground, appears
to be very slow.”.</P>
<P>“Strictly speaking, the great Ternat bats live
not in society. When in quest of food, they
unite into flocks or companies more or less nu∣merous.
These companies associate by acci∣dent
upon the trees whose flowers or fruits are
agreeable to their palates. They may be ob∣served
arriving successively, and laying hold of
the trees by the claws of their hind feet, where
they rest for a long time, if not disturbed.
There are always some, however, which de∣tach
themselves from time to time, and join
the company. But, when a bird of prey pas∣ses
above the tree, when they hear the noise of
thunder, or of a musket, or when they spy
any person in their neighbourhood, they all
take wing at once. It is on such occasions
that they are seen, during the day, flying in
companies, which, though numerous, never
obscure the air, because they cannot fly close
enough to produce this effect: The expression
is at least hyperbolical. But to say, that <HI>an
infinity of large bats may be seen attached to
each other upon the trees,</HI> is not only false, but
absurd. They are too peevish to hold each o∣ther,
in this manner, by the hand; and, if we
examine their figure, the impossibility of such
a concatenation will be apparent. They rest
<PB N="294" REF="343"/>
on the branches above, below, or at each o∣ther's
side; but always remain separate.”</P>
<P>“With regard to the lesser Ternat bats, they
never fly in the day: They live in society, to
the number sometimes of more than four hun∣dred,
in the hollow trunks of large corrupted
trees, from which they depart not till the dusk
of the evening, and return before day-break. It
is firmly believed in this island, that, whatever
numbers these societies consist of, there is never
more than one male found among them: But I
cannot attest this fact. I shall only remark, that
these sedentary animals acquire a great degree
of fatness, and that, when this colony was first
established, many people, whose taste and sto∣mach
were not too nice, collected vast quan∣tities
of bat grease for food. I have seen the
time when a <HI>tree of bats,</HI> as it is termed, was no
inconsiderable treasure. It is easy to shut up
the entrance of their retreats, to take them out
alive one by one, or to suffocate them with
smoke, and in either way to ascertain the num∣ber
of males and females of which the society
is composed. I know nothing more of this
species. I return to the notes. … Another
hyperbole: P. 288. <HI>They know how to distinguish,
in the thickest woods, the trees which bear ripe
fruit. These they devour during the night,
making a noise that may be heard at the distance
of two miles.</HI> … In reading this passage, we
are led to ascribe the noise to the act of masti∣cation.
<PB N="295" REF="344"/>
The noise that is heard at a great di∣stance,
both in the night and the day, is that
which is natural to the animals when in a pas∣sion,
and when disputing about their food; for
it must not be imagined that the large Ternat
bats eat only during the night. They have a
fine eye, as well as an acute scent. They see
very well in the day; and it is not surprising,
that they should distinguish, in the woods, ripe
fruits and grain as well as flowers. Besides,
the bananas of every kind, of which they are
very fond, the peaches and other fruits cultiva∣ted
by the Indians, are not in the thickest parts
of the woods. … <HI>The flesh of these animals,</HI>
p. 289. <HI>is not bad</HI> … True, if the reluctance
excited by their figure could be overcome. When
about five months old, they are fat, and as good
of their kind as the Guiney hen, or young wild
boar; but, when old, they are hard, though
pretty fat during the fruit-season, which con∣tinues
all the summer and a part of autumn.
The males, especially when aged, acquire a
strong, disagreeable flavour. … Neither is it
correct to say, in general, that these animals
<HI>are eaten by the Indians.</HI> It is well known,
that the Indian neither eats nor kills any ani∣mal.
Perhaps they are eaten by the Moors and
Malayans. It is certain, that many Europe∣ans
eat them. Hence it is true, that bats are
eaten in India, though not by the Indians. In
this island, both species are eaten.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="345"/>
After this examination, I proceed to the hi∣story
of these animals, which likewise requires
to be rectified. My proofs shall be drawn sole∣ly
from my own observation, and from what
has been alledged by those writers whom our
Historian of Nature has followed.”</P>
<P>“Both the great and lesser Ternat bats are
natives of the Isles of France, of Bourbon,
and of Madagascar. I have resided in the isle
of Bourbon upwards of fifty years. When I
arrived in the month of September 1722, these
animals were very common in districts already
settled, where they are now become rare. The
reasons are obvious: 1. The forests were then
at no great distance from the settlements; and
they cannot subsist but in forests. 2. The Great
Ternat bats are viviparous, and bring forth one
young only each year. 3. For the sake of their
flesh and their grease, they are hunted, during
the whole summer, autumn, and part of winter,
by the Whites with muskets, and by the Ne∣groes
with nets. Besides these causes of dimi∣nution
in the species, they abandon the neigh∣bourhood
of our settlements, and retire into the
interior parts of the island, where they are ex∣posed
to constant destruction by the chesnut-coloured
Negroes.”</P>
<P>“The season of their amours here is in the
month of May, which is about the middle of
our autumn, and the females bring forth a
month after the vernal equinox. Hence the
<PB N="297" REF="346"/>
time of their gestation is from four and a half
to five months. Of the precise time the young
take in acquiring their full growth, I have no
knowledge: But I know that they appear to
be perfect at the winter solstice, which is nearly
eight months from their birth. Besides, no
small bats are seen, excepting in April and May,
when the old are easily distinguished from the
young, by the more vivid colour of the latter.
The old ones become gray, though I know not
at what period; and it is then that their flesh
is hard, and has so strong and disagreeable a fla∣vour,
that the fat alone, with which they are
well provided from the end of spring to the be∣ginning
of winter, is eaten by the Negroes.”</P>
<P>“It is certain, that these animals feed upon no
kinds of flesh, but solely on bananas, peaches,
and other fruits, which our forests produce a∣bundantly
in different seasons. They are like∣wise
very fond of the juices of certain umbel∣lated
flowers, particularly those of our stinking
tree, the nectarium of which is very short.
These flowers abound in January and February,
which is the heart of our summer, and allure
into the lower parts of the island vast numbers
of bats; and, it is probable, for the purpose of
sucking the nectaria of umbellated flowers of
different species, that their tongue is furnished
with so many sharp papillae. The skin of the
mango fruit is resinous, and is never touched
by the bats. When confined in a cage, they
<PB N="298" REF="347"/>
have been made to eat bread, sugar-canes, &amp;c.
I know not, however, whether they were made
to eat flesh either raw or roasted. But, suppo∣sing
they had, it is not in a state of slavery that
I am considering them; for bondage changes
the manners, charactes, and habits of all ani∣mals.
Man has nothing to apprehend from
these bats, either personally, or for his poultry.
It is impossible for them to seize even the smal∣lest
bird. They cannot, like a falcon, stoop
down upon their prey. If they approach too
near the ground, they fall down, and are inca∣pable
of resuming their flight till they climb
upon any elevated object they first meet with,
supposing it should be the body of a man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I saw a young Ternat bat fly into my house in the dusk of the evening, and fall down at the feet of a Negress about eight years of age. It instantly began to climb up the child's body, who was luckily very near me. I quickly relieved her, lest the claws of its wings should have scratched her shoulders or face.</NOTE>.
When on the ground, they trail their bodies
slowly along, and make their stay in that situ∣ation
as short as possible. As they are by no
means adapted for running, how is it practi∣cable
for them to seize birds on the branches
of trees? The slow and aukward manner in
which they move toward the end of a branch,
in order to catch the wind in their wings, shows
that every attempt of this nature would be a∣bortive.
When about to fly, these animals
<PB N="299" REF="348"/>
cannot, like birds, dart at once into the air.
To disengage their claws from the place to
which they are attached, they are obliged to
beat the air several times with their wings; and,
however full their wings may be when they
quit their station, their weight is apt to make
them sink. In order to raise themselves, they
traverse the concavity of a curve line. But the
place from which they depart is not always
commodious for the free play of their wings.
They may be restrained by the vicinity of
branches; and, when thus situated, they pro∣ceed
to a part of the branch from which they
can take wing without any risk. It frequently
happens, that, when a numerous flock rest upon
trees of twenty or thirty feet high, and are sur∣prised
by a peal of thunder, or the firing of a
gun, several of them fall to the ground before
they receive a sufficient quantity of air to sup∣port
them. In this case, they instantly climb
the first tree they meet with, in order to resume
their flight as soon as possible. Let us suppose
that a traveller, hunting animals of which he
has no knowledge, whose figure and aspect
strike him with terror, is suddenly surrounded
with a number of large bats; that he is en∣tangled
by one or two of them climbing up his
body; that, by roughly endeavouring to disen∣gage
himself, he irritates the animals, and is
scratched, or even bit by them; would not a
scene of this kind give rise to the notion, that
<PB N="300" REF="349"/>
these bats were ferocious, rushing upon men,
in order to wound or devour them, while the
whole affair is only a fortuitous rencounter of
animals of different species, who are equally a∣fraid
of each other? I say more: The forest is
absolutely necessary to the existence of these
bats, to which they are led by the instinct of
self-preservation, and not by any savage or fe∣rocious
disposition. When to all these facts, I
add, that neither the great nor lesser Ternat
bats ever fix upon carrion, and that naturally
they do not eat upon the ground, but require
to be in a hanging posture when they feed, I
think I have said enough to eradicate the pre∣judice
which represents them as carnivorous,
voracious, destructive, and cruel animals. When
I farther add, that their flight is as heavy and
noisy, especially when near the ground, as that
of the vampire ought to be light and silent, I
shall have, by this last character, removed the
one species to a considerable distance from the
other.”</P>
<P>“Because the great Ternat bats are sometimes
observed flying near the surface of the water,
like the swallow, they have been represented as
feeding upon fish. But this flesh is equally
disagreeable to them as all other kinds; for, I
repeat it, that they live entirely on vegetables.
It is solely for the purpose of bathing that they
frequent the waters; and, if they fly nearer the
surface of the water than the earth, it is owing
<PB N="301" REF="350"/>
to the fewer interruptions presented by the for∣mer
to the motion of their wings. To this
circumstance the natural cleanliness of these a∣nimals
must be ascribed. I have seen, and I
have killed numbers, and never discovered the
smallest degree of dirtiness upon any of them.”</P>
<P>“The great bat is by no means a beautiful
animal. When seen nigh, its movements are
all disagreeable. There is only one point of
view, a single attitude, in which all its natural
deformity disappears, and in which it may be
observed with pleasure. When perched on a
tree, it hangs with its head down, and its
wings folded, and placed exactly on each side
of the body. In this situation, the vibrating
wings, which constitute its deformity, as well
as the hind paws, by the claws of which it is
suspended, are concealed. We see only a
roundish, plump, pendulous body, covered
with deep brown hair extremely clean and
smooth, terminated by a head whose physiog∣nomy
is vivacious, and by no means disagree∣able.
This is their only attitude of repose, in
which they remain a long time during the
day. They are seen to best advantage at an
elvation above the earth from forty to sixty
feet, and at the distance of about one hundred
and fifty feet. Now, figure to yourself a
large tree, whose branches are garnished with
one hundred and fifty or two hundred of such
objects, having no other motion but what is
<PB N="302" REF="351"/>
communicated to them by the branches, and
you will have an idea of a picture, which I
have regarded as curious, and contemplated
with pleasure. In the richest cabinets of na∣tural
history, the great Ternat bat is always
shown with its wings fully extended, which
is its most ugly attitude. This position may
answer one purpose. But some of them ought
to be viewed at a side, or from above, in their
natural state of repose. The one represented
in your work is not just; for these animals
never rest on the ground with their four feet.”</P>
<P>“I shall finish my notes, by remarking, that
both species afford a wholesome nourishment;
for, though their flesh is often devoured to excess,
it was never known to be hurtful. Neither should
this fact excite surprise, when it is considered
that these animals feed entirely on ripe fruits,
the juices, flowers, and perhaps the exudations
of a number of trees. The last I was induced
to believe from a passage in Herodotus. But I
have not been able to ascertain the truth of it
by actual observation.”</P>

<P>This Bat has a head of a very singular con∣struction.
The nose has hardly any carti∣lage,
and the front is much sunk. The nostrils
are not separated, as in most animals, by a par∣tition,
but each of them is placed on the side of
a small gutter, which is open above from one
end to the other. The internal edge of this
gutter is very small; the external is larger, and
terminated by a small button. The external
edges of the two gutters unite above the upper
lip, and form the extremity of a large furrow,
which extends from the upper lip to the front,
where there is a deep naked hole, the borders of
which are covered with long hair. The ears are
long and narrow. The hair of the head, except∣ing
that of the top, throat, breast, and belly, is
whitish, with a tincture of yellow. The hair on
the top and hind part of the head, the neck,
shoulders, back, and rump, is of a reddish brown.
The length of the longest hairs is four lines and a
half. The ears and the membrane of the wings
and tail have different tinctures of blackish and
reddish brown. The tail is inclosed in the mem∣brane

<P>THIS animal is related, by certain charac∣ters
only, to the squirrel, the rat, and the
<HI>loir,</HI> or fat squirrel. It resembles the squirrel in
nothing but the largeness of its eyes, and the
form of its tail, which, however, is neither so
long, nor so bushy. It approaches the fat squir∣rel
<PB N="308" REF="362"/>
by the figure of its body, by the shortness
and nakedness of its ears, and by the hairs on
its tail, which are of the same figure and length.
But it is not, like the fat squirrel, subject to be
reduced to a torpid state by the action of cold.
Hence the flying squirrel is neither a rat, a squir∣rel,
nor a fat squirrel, though it participates of
the nature of each of the three species.</P>
<P>Mr Klein gave the first exact description of
this animal in the Philosophical Transactions,
1733. It was known, however, long before that
time. It is found equally in all the northern
regions of the Old and New Continents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the country of the Hurons, there are three kinds of squirrels. … … The flying squirrels, called <HI>Sabouesquanta,</HI> are most valued. They are ash-coloured; their head is thick; and a membrane, or expansion of the skin, extends from the fore to the hind feet, which they stretch out when about to fly. … … The females produce three or four at a litter, &amp;c.; <HI>Voy. du pays des Hurons, par Sagard Theodat, p.</HI> 306.—There is another small animal, called <HI>Assapanick</HI> by the Vir∣ginian Indians, and <HI>flying squirrel</HI> by the English, which, by extending the skin attached to its legs, in the form of wings, flies three or four hundred feet at a time; <HI>Hist. de Nouv. Monde, par Jean Laët, lib. 3. p.</HI> 88.—The flying squirrels are of the size of a large rat, and of grayish white colour. They are as drowsy and indolent as the other squirrels are vi∣gilant and active. They are called <HI>flying squirrels,</HI> because they fly from one tree to another by means of a membrane which extends, in the form of wings, when they take their little flights; <HI>Voy. de la Hontan, tom. 2. p.</HI> 42.—The flying squir∣rels come from North America; but they have lately been discovered in Poland; <HI>Edw. Hist. of Birds, p. 191. Catesby, Hist. Nat. Carol. tom. 2. p.</HI> 76.</NOTE>. But
it is more common in America than in Europe,
<PB N="309" REF="363"/>
where they are rare, and confined to some nor∣thern
countries, as those of Lithuania and Rus∣sia.
This small animal dwells upon trees, like
the squirrel. It moves about from branch to
branch; and, when leaping from one tree to an∣other
considerably distant, the loose skin or
membrane is stretched forward by the fore-feet,
and backward by the hind-feet. The skin be∣ing
thus stretched, and drawn out laterally above
an inch, augments the surface of the body, with∣out
increasing its quantity of matter, and, of
course, retards so much the acceleration of the
fall, that, by a single leap, the creature is enabled
to sail to a considerable distance. This motion
has no resemblance to the flying of birds, or the
fluttering of bats, both of which are performed
by striking the air with repeated vibrations. It
is only a simple leap, depending on a single im∣pulse:
The motion produced by that impulse is
prolonged, because the animal's body is render∣ed
specifically lighter, is more powerfully resisted
by the air, and, consequently, falls more slowly.
The expansion of the skin from foot to foot is
peculiar to the flying squirrel; and this charac∣ter
is sufficient to distinguish it from all other
squirrels, rats, and dormice. But the most re∣markable
peculiarities of Nature are seldom con∣fined
to a single species. In the same genus,
there is another animal with a similar skin, which
extends not only from foot to foot, but from the
head to the tail. This animal, a figure and de∣scription
<PB N="310" REF="364"/>
of which is given by Seba<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seba, vol. 1. p. 72. tab. 44. fig. 3.</NOTE>, under the
name of the <HI>Virginian flying-squirrel,</HI> seems to
differ so greatly from our flying squirrel, as to
constitute a distinct species. We cannot, how∣ever,
determine the nature of this animal; it
may exist, and be of a different species from our
flying squirrel. But it may be a simple variety
only, or perhaps an accidental or monstrous pro∣duction;
for it is mentioned by no traveller or
naturalist. Seba is the only person who has seen
it in the cabinet of <HI>Vincent.</HI> I am always suspi∣cious
of descriptions made in cabinets; for the
animals in these repositories are often manufac∣tured
in such a manner as to render their appear∣ance
most singular.</P>

during the day, and resumes its activity in the
evening. It is easily tamed; but it is subject to
become enraged, and must be kept in a cage, or
restrained by a small chain. Flying squirrels are
fed with bread, fruits, and seeds. They are par∣ticularly
fond of the buds and young shoots of
the pine and birch trees. They search not for
nuts and almonds, like the squirrels. They make
a bed of leaves, in which they sleep during the
whole day, and never depart from it till night,
when stimulated by hunger. As they have little
activity, they become an easy prey to pine-wea∣sels,
and other animals which climb trees; and,
of course, the species is not numerous, though
the females generally bring forth three or four
young at a time.</P>

<P>I formerly remarked, p. 311. that there were lar∣ger
flying squirrels than those of which we have
<PB N="313" REF="367"/>
given descriptions, and that there is, in the royal
cabinet, a skin five and a half inches long, while
that of the common species exceeds not four
inches. But this difference is nothing, when com∣pared
to that which subsists between our flying
squirrel, and the East-India <HI>taguan,</HI> whose skin
was sent from Machian to the Prince de Condi,
who was so obliging as to allow me to examine it.
This great flying squirrel, which is preserved in
the cabinet of Chantilly, was twenty-three inches
long, from the point of the nose to the extremi∣ty
of the body. These animals are found not
only at Machian, but in the Philippine islands, and
probably in many other parts of India. The
one just mentioned was taken on the Malabar
coast. Its size is gigantic, when compared with
the flying squirrels of Russia and America; for
the latter exceeds not four and a half or five
inches in length. Nevertheless, the taguan, or
great flying squirrel, resembles the other species
in figure and in the prolongation of the skin,
which is perfectly similar. But, as the differ∣ence
of size is so remarkable, it ought to be con∣sidered
as a distinct species.</P>
<P>The great flying squirrel differs from the small,
1. In size, being twenty-three inches long. 2. In
the length of the tail, which is twenty-one inches.
Besides, the tail is not flat, like that of the com∣mon
kind, but round, like that of the cat, and
covered with long blackish brown hair. 3. The
eyes and ears of both species are similarly situa∣ted,
<PB N="314" REF="368"/>
and the black whiskers are proportionally
the same; but the head of the large kind is small∣er
in proportion to the size of its body. 4. The
face is entirely black; the sides of the head, and
the cheeks, are mixed with black and white hairs;
on the top of the nose, and round the eyes, the
hair is a mixture of black, white, and red. Be∣hind
the ears there are dark long brown hairs,
which cover the sides of the neck; these are not
to be found in the common kind. The top of the
head, and of the whole body, as far as the tail,
is sprinkled with black and white hairs, where
the black predominates, because the white hairs
are black at the roots, and become white only
near their extremities. The under part of the
body is of a dirty white colour, which extends
below the belly. 5. The prolongation of the
skin is covered above with dark brown hair, and
below with yellowish ash-coloured hair. The
legs are of a reddish black colour, and the upper
part of the tail is brown. This brown shade
grows gradually deeper till it becomes black at
the extremity of the tail. 6. The feet of the
great flying squirrel have the same number of
toes as in the common kind; but those of the for∣mer
are covered with black, and those of the
latter with white hair. The claws are thin and
hooked like those of a cat. From this resem∣blance,
and that of the tail, the animal has re∣ceived
the name of the <HI>flying cat.</HI> The large
claw of the fore-feet is five lines and a half
<PB N="315" REF="369"/>
long, and the longest of the hind-feet only five
lines. The figure of this animal, drawn by M.
de Seve as perfectly as the state of the dried skin
would permit, is here represented. We have
called it <HI>Le Taguan,</HI> in consequence of the fol∣lowing
passage in the general history of voy∣ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen, des Voyages, tom. 10. p. 410.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“In the Philippine islands, there is a species
of flying cat, of the size of a hare, and of the
colour of a fox, which the natives call <HI>Taguan.</HI>
It has wings like a bat, but covered with hair,
which they make use of in leaping from one
tree to another, at the distance of thirty palms.”</P>
<P>After writing this article, a work of M. de
Vosmaër, containing descriptions of several qua∣drupeds
and birds, has fallen into my hands. I
there read with pleasure the description of the
great flying squirrel, and some remarks concern∣ing
the smaller species.</P>
<P>M. de Vosmaër informs us, that he saw, in
the possession of the Prince of Orange, two of
the small flying squirrels alive; but that they
did not live long.</P>
<P>“They slept,' he says, `almost the whole day.
When briskly pushed, they made a small ef∣fort,
as if they intended to fly; but they stole
away immediately, being exceedingly timid.
They are fond of heat; and, when uncovered,
they quickly concealed themselves under the
wool which formed their bed. Their food was
<PB N="316" REF="370"/>
soaked bread, fruits, &amp;c. which they eat, like
the squirrels, by sitting on their posteriors, and
holding the food with their fore paws. At
the approach of night, they become more vi∣vacious
and restless. The difference of climate
had unquestionably great influence on these
animals, who appeared to be extremely deli∣cate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript, d'une ecureuil volant, par. M. Vosmaër, p. 9.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>These remarks of M. de Vosmaër correspond
with my own observations. I have just now
one of these little animals (March 17. 1775) li∣ving
in a cage, with a small box in the bottom
of it. It continues the whole day covered with
the cotton, and comes out only in the night to
take food. It has a faint cry, like that of a
mouse, which is never heard but when the ani∣mal
is forced out from among the cotton.
Though its teeth are very small, it bites severely.
Its hair is extremely smooth and agreeable to
the touch. There is no way of making it ex∣tend
its wings, but by obliging it to fall from a
height. It is so remarkably chilly, that I cannot
conceive how it can defend itself from the cold
in the northern climates; since in France, if not
kept in a chamber, and furnished with wool or
cotton to lie on, and even to wrap itself all over,
it would perish in a very short time.</P>
<P>With regard to the taguan, or great flying
squirrel, let us attend to the remarks of M. de
Vosmaër: “The small flying squirrel described
<PB N="317" REF="371"/>
by M. de Buffon, has a great affinity to the
larger species. They both have similar mem∣branes,
not for flying, but for supporting them∣selves
in the air, when they leap from branch
to branch.”</P>
<P>“The skin of the <HI>great flying squirrel,</HI> which
is a more proper appellation than that of the
<HI>flying cat,</HI> was sent me in a dried state. M.
Alamand has given a short description of this
animal from a female subject preserved in the
cabinet of the Leyden academy.”</P>
<P>“Valentine first mentioned these animals, and
says, that they are found in the island of Gi∣lolo,
and go by the name of <HI>flying civets.</HI> He
remarks, that they have long tails like those of
the monkeys; that, when at rest, their wings
are not seen; that they are wild and timid;
that their head is reddish, with a mixture of
gray; that their wings, or rather membranes,
are covered on both sides with hair; that their
bite is so strong, that they easily escape from a
wooden cage in a single night; that by some
people they are called <HI>flying monkeys;</HI> that they
are also found in the island of Ternat, where
they were first mistaken for squirrels, only the
head was thinner and larger, there was gray
hair above the muzzle, and a black line run
the whole length of the back; that the ex∣tensible
skin, which adheres to their bodies,
is garnished with hair, as white, on the under
side, as that of the belly; and that, when they
<PB N="318" REF="372"/>
leap from tree to tree, they extend their mem∣branes,
and have then the appearance of being
flat.”</P>
<P>In the work of M. l'Abbé Prevost, it is said,
that this animal is found in the Philippine islands,
where it is called <HI>taguan.</HI></P>
<P>“I have seen two females, the one in the Ley∣den
cabinet, the other in that of <HI>M. Heeteren</HI>
at the Hague. The colour of the body was a
light chesnut, deeper on the back, and the end
of the tail was blackish. The difference of
sex is distinguishable by six small paps, placed
at equal distances, in two rows, from the breast
to the belly. I have also seen two males in
the Prince of Orange's cabinet. The length
of the body, in Rhenish measure, was one foot
five inches, and that of the tail one foot eight.
The head is more pointed than that of the
squirrel.”</P>
<P>“The ears are small, pointed, and covered on
the outside with short, fine, clear brown hair.
Above the eyes, there are two long brownish
yellow hairs; but there are none on the eye∣lids.
On each side of the muzzle, there are
long, black, rigid whiskers. The nose is na∣ked;
the teeth, like those of the squirrels, are
two above and two below, of a deep yellow
colour, and very long. The grinders are at
the bottom of the muzzle.”</P>
<P>“Both fore and hind feet, especially the latter,
are concealed by the membrane, which covers
<PB N="319" REF="373"/>
them nearly as far as the paws. The fore∣feet
are divided into four black toes, the two
middlemost, and particularly the third, being
much longer than the other two. The hind∣feet
are also black, and divided into five toes,
four of which are of equal length; but the
fifth, or innermost, is much shorter, and has
the appearance of a simple appendage. The
claws are large, sharp, black before, white be∣low,
and broad at the origin. The articula∣tions
of the toes are similar to those of the
squirrels.”</P>
<P>The skin or membrane is thinnest in the
“middle, where it is about four inches broad on
each side, and exceeds not the thickness of fine
Indian paper. In other parts, it is also very
thin, of a clear texture, and garnished with
small chesnut hairs. Near the fore and hind
feet, it becomes thicker, and rises in the form
of a bag, widest at the thighs, and growing
gradually narrower towards the paws. This
part is closely covered with brown and black
hairs. Upon the fore-paws it appears loose,
hangs down like a rag, and is covered with
thick hair. The external edges of this skin
are bounded with a thick selvage of black and
gray hairs.”</P>
<P>“The upper part of the head, the back, and
the origin of the tail, are covered with pretty
long, thick hairs, black in the under part, and
<PB N="320" REF="374"/>
mostly of a grayish white colour at the sum∣mits.”</P>
<P>“The hairs of the tail are black, more gray
near the body, and so disposed as to make the
tail appear round.”</P>
<P>“The cheeks are of a grayish brown colour;
and the throat, breast, and belly, are of a clear
whitish gray. On the under side of the mem∣brane,
there are also gray hairs; but they are
very thinly scattered.”</P>

<P>THIS animal inhabits the northern regions
of both worlds. It has a great resem∣blance
to the squirrel, from which it differs only
by the following external characters. It is
larger than the squirrel, and its hair is not red∣dish,
but of a gray colour, more or less deep.
The ears are deprived of the long hairs, which
adorn those of the common squirrel. These dif∣ferences,
which are constant, seem sufficient to
constitute a distinct species. Several authors
maintain, that the gray squirrels of Europe dif∣fer
from those of America; that the former be∣long
to the common kind, whose colour changes
with the season in our northern climates. With∣out
pretending to deny this last fact, which,
<PB N="322" REF="380"/>
however, is not properly ascertained, we consider
the gray squirrel of Europe and that of Ameri∣ca
as the same animal, and as a species distinct
from the common squirrel; for our squirrels are
found in North America as well as in the north
of Europe. They are of the same size, and their
colour is of a more or less lively red, according
to the temperature of the climate. At the same
time, we find, in both Continents, other squir∣rels,
which are larger, and whose hair is gray or
blackish in all seasons. Besides, the fur of the
gray squirrel is much finer and softer than that
of the common kind. Hence it appears, that
these two animals, the differences between which
are constant, and their species, though very si∣milar,
have never intermixed, ought to be re∣garded
as separate species. M. Regnard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These gray squirrels are the same with the French squir∣rels, only their reddish colour changes to gray during the win∣ter snows. The farther north, they turn always more gray. The Laplanders make war against them in the winter; and their dogs are so well trained to this species of hunting, that they never failed to discover the squirrels upon the highest trees, and to advertise the hunters who accompanied us. We shot some of them with our guns; for the Laplanders had not then their round arrows, with which they bring down these animals; and we had the pleasure of seeing with what dexterity and quickness they take off the skin. The hunting season begins about Michaelmas. Almost every native of Lapland is oc∣cupied in this business, which is a considerable article of com∣merce. Forty skins are sold for a crown. But there is no merchandise in which a man may be more deceived, than in that of the gray squirrel and crmines; for you buy without see∣ing, the fur side of the skins being always turned in most. There is no distinction to be made. The good and bad are all sold at the same price. We learned from our Laplanders a sur∣prising fact concerning these gray squirrels, which was after∣wards confirmed by our own experience. They often change the places of their residence, and not one of them can be found, during a whole winter, where there were millions the preceding year. In their marches from one part of the country to another, when it becomes necessary to pass a lake or a river, which are very frequent in Lapland, these ani∣mals lay hold of a piece of pine or birch bark, which they draw to the edge of the water, mount upon it, and abandon themselves to the pleasure of the wind and waves. They e∣rect their tails in the form of sails; but, if the wind blows too strong, or the waves rise high, both pilot and vessel are overturned. This kind of shipwreck, which often consists of three or four thousand sail, generally enriches some Lapland∣ers, who find the dead bodies on the shore, and, if they have not lain too long on the sand, prepare the furs in the ordina∣ry manner. But, when the winds are favourable, the poor creatures make a happy voyage, and arrive at their destined port. This remarkable fact might have the appearance of a fable, if it had not fallen within my own observation; <HI>Oeu∣vres de M. Regnard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 163.</NOTE> affirms
<PB N="323" REF="381"/>
positively, that the gray squirrels of Lapland
are the same animals with our French squirrels.
This authority would be sufficient, were it not
contradicted by other evidences. M. Regnard
has written some excellent theatrical works;
but he was not much versant in natural history:
Neither did he remain long enough in Lapland
to see the squirrels change their colour. It is
true, that some naturalists, and among this num∣ber
is Linnaeus, tell us, that, in the northern
regions, the squirrels change their colour in
<PB N="324" REF="382"/>
winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sciurus vulgaris … habitat in arboribus frequens, aestate ruber, hyeme incanus; <HI>Faun. Suec. p.</HI> 9. Sciurus vulgaris. … Aestate ruber, hyeme cinereus; <HI>Syst. nat. p.</HI> 63.</NOTE>; which is not improbable, as, in these
climates, hares, wolves, and weasels also change
their colours. But this change is from yellow
or red to white, and not from yellow or red to
an ash-colour. But, to confine ourselves to the squirrel, Linnaeus, in the <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> says,
<HI>aestate ruber, hyeme incanus.</HI> The change, there∣fore,
is from red to white, or rather from red∣dish
to whitish; and it is not easy to conceive
why Linnaeus, in the last edition of his <HI>Systema

us, on the contrary, that the squirrels in the
neighbourhood of Dantzick are reddish in win∣ter

in Poland, gray and blackish squirrels as well
as the reddish kind, which never change their
colour. These gray and blackish squirrels are
found in Canada<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Virginian squirrels are nearly of the size of rabbits. They are black, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with black and white.

<PB N="325" REF="383"/>
Hence the gray squirrel may be re∣garded
as an animal common to both Continents,
and of a different species from the ordinary squir∣rel.</P>
<P>Besides, we never see our squirrels, though
very numerous in the forests, unite together in
flocks. Neither do we ever see them travel in
company, approach the waters, or traverse ri∣vers
on the bark of trees. Thus they differ
from the gray squirrel, not only in size and co∣lour,
but in manners and habits; for, though
the navigations of the gray squirrel seem to be
hardly credible; yet they are attested by such
a number of witnesses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rei veritate nititur, quod Gesnerus ex Vincentio Belua∣censi et Olao M. referet: Sciuros, quando aquam transire cupiunt, lignum levissimum aquae imponere, eique insidentes et cauda, non tamen ut vult, erecta, sed continuo mota, velifi∣cantes, neque flante vento, sed tranquillo aequore transvehi: quod fide dignus fidusque meus emissarius ad insulas Goth∣landiae plus simplici vice observavit, et cum spoliis in littori∣bus ibidem collectis redux, mirabundus mihi retulit; <HI>Disserta∣tio de sciuro volante.

of the gray squirrel. The Barbary, the palm,

border very near upon each other.</P>
<P>We have few historical facts concerning the
gray squirrel. Fernandes<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Francisci Fernandes; <HI>Hist, animal, nov. orbis, p.</HI> 8.</NOTE> remarks, that the
gray or blackish squirrels of America dwell up∣on
trees, and particularly upon the pine; that
they feed upon fruits and seeds; that they amass
provisions for the winter, which they deposit in
the holes of trees, where they also retire to pass the
severe season; that in these holes the females bring
forth their young, &amp;c. Thus the manners of the
gray squirrel differ from those of the common
kind, who build nests, like the birds, on the
tops of trees. We cannot, however, pretend to
determine absolutely that this blackish squirrel
of Fernandes is the same with the gray squirrel
of Virginia, or that both of them are the same
with the gray squirrel of Europe. We only

<P>THE palm squirrel is of the size of a rat, or
of a small squirrel. He lives upon the
palm-trees, and from that circumstance he has
had his name. By some he is called the <HI>palm∣rat,</HI>
<PB N="329" REF="388"/>
and by others the <HI>palm-squirrel.</HI> But, as he
is neither a rat nor a squirrel, we have given
him the simple denomination of <HI>Le palmiste.</HI>
The form of his head is nearly the same with
that of the short-tailed field-mouse, and covered
with frizled hair. His long tail trails not, like
that of the rat, but is elevated vertically, with∣out,
however, lying on his back, like that of the
<PB N="330" REF="389"/>
squirrel. The tail is covered with hair longer
than that of the body, but shorter than the hair
on the tail of a squirrel. Along the spine of
the back, from the neck to the tail, there is a
whitish stripe, accompanied on each side with a
brown stripe, which is followed by another
white stripe. This striking character, by which
this animal would appear to be distinguished
from all others, is found to be nearly the same
in the Barbary and ground squirrels. These
three animals have such a resemblance to each
other, that Mr Ray<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sciurus Getulus Caii, mustela Africana Clusii, eadem nobis videtur.—Descriptio mustelae Africanae cum sciuri Getuli descriptione satis bene convenit, ut non dubitem idem animal esse: Huic similis est sciurus a clarissimo <HI>Dom. Lister,</HI> observatus et descriptus; <HI>Raii synops. quad.</HI> p. 216.</NOTE> imagined they constituted
but one species. If it be considered, however, that
the palm and Barbary squirrels are only found
in the warm climates of the Old Continent, and
that the ground squirrel, described by Lister,
Catesby<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Catesby, hist. nat. de la Caroline, tom. 2. p. 75.</NOTE>, and Edwards<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Edwards, nat. hist of birds, part 4. p. 181.</NOTE>, is peculiar to the
cold and temperate regions of the New World,
we must conclude them to be different spe∣cies.
By a closer examination, we perceive
that the whtie and brown stripes of the ground
squirrel are differently disposed from those of
the palm-squirrel. In the palm-squirrel, the
white stripe, which extends along the spine
of the back, is black or brown in the ground
squirrel, and the white stripes are placed next
<PB N="331" REF="390"/>
the black, as the black are next the whtie in the
palm-squirrel. Besides, the palm-squirrel has
only three white stripes; but the ground-squir∣rel
has four. The latter turns his tail upon his
back, but the former does not. The palm-squir∣rel
dwells upon trees; but the ground-squirrel
keeps always on the surface of the earth, and,
from this circumstance, he has obtained his
name. In fine, the ground-squirrel is smaller
than the palm-squirrel: From all these con∣siderations,
they appear to be two distinct spe∣cies.</P>
<P>With regard to the Barbary squirrel, as it is a
native of the same continent and climate, as it is
of the same size and nearly of the same figure, with
the palm-squirrel, they might be considered as va∣rieties
of the same species. By comparing, how∣ever,
the description and figure of the Barbary
squirrel given by Caius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sciurus getulus <HI>Caii, apud Gesner. hist. quad.</HI> p. 847.</NOTE>, and copied by Aldro∣vandus
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrov. de quad. digit. p. 405.</NOTE> and Johnston<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Johns. de quad. p. 113.</NOTE>, with the description
and figure we have given of the palm-squirrel,
and by again comparing Edwards's description
and figure of the Barbary squirrel, we shall per∣ceive
distinctions so remarkable as to point out
these animals as belonging to different species.
All the three are in the royal cabinet. In the
Barbary squirrel, the head and face are rounder,
the ears larger, and the hair of the tail longer
and more bushy, than in the palm-squirrel. In
<PB N="332" REF="391"/>
the form of the head and body, the Barbary
squirrel resembles the squirrel more than the
rat, and the palm-squirrel resembles the rat more
than the squirrel. The Barbary squirrel has
four white stripes, the palm-squirrel only three.
In the palm-squirrel, the middle white stripe
runs along the spine of the back; but, in the Bar∣bary
squirrel, the stripe along the back is black
mixed with red, &amp;c. Besides, these animals have
nearly the same manners and dispositions as the
common squirrels: They all feed upon fruits,
which they carry to their mouths by their fore∣paws.
They have the same voice and cry,
the same instinct and agility. They are ex∣tremely
gentle and lively. They are easily ta∣med,
and contract such an attachment to their
habitation, that, after leaving it, they spontane∣ously
return. The figure of both is handsome.
Their robe, which is striped with white, is
more beautiful than that of the squirrel; their
size is smaller, their body lighter, and their
movements equally prompt. Like the common
squirrel, the palm and Barbary squirrels dwell
on the tops of trees; but the ground squirrel
never rises from the earth, in which, like the
long-tailed field-mouse, he makes a retreat im∣penetrable
by the water. Unless completely
tamed, he bites every person indiscriminately<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage du Pays des Hurons, par Sagard Theodat, p. 306.</NOTE>.
Hence, in manners and dispositions, he has a
greater resemblance to the rats and field-mice
than to the squirrels.</P>

<P>IN South America, there are three animals,
with a long muzzle, a narrow mouth, with∣out
any teeth, and a long round tongue, that
<PB N="334" REF="396"/>
they thrust into the ant-nests, and retract it
when covered with these insects, which consti∣tute
their principal food. The first of these
ant-eaters is called by the Brasilians <HI>Tamandua∣guacu,</HI>
<PB N="335" REF="397"/>
or <HI>great Tamandua,</HI> to which the French
inhabitants of America have given the name of
<HI>Tamanoir.</HI> From the end of the muzzle to the
origin of the tail, it is about four feet in length.
The head is from fourteen to fifteen inches long,
and the tail about two feet and a half, covered
with coarse hair more than a foot in length.
The muzzle is immoderately long, the neck
short, the head narrow, the eyes small and black,
the ears roundish, the tongue thin, more than
two feet long, and, when retracted, folded up
in the mouth. The legs exceed not a foot in
length, those before being a little taller and thin∣ner
than those behind. The feet are round.
The fore-feet have four claws, the two middle∣most
being largest. Those behind have five claws.
The colour of the hairs, both on the body and
tail, is a mixture of black and white. The hair
on the tail is disposed in the form of a plume,
which the animal, when he wants to sleep, or
when he wants to defend himself from rains or
the heat of the sun, turns on his back, and co∣vers
his whole body with it. The long hairs
of the tail and body are not round through
<PB N="336" REF="398"/>
their whole extent, but flat at the extremities,
and feel dry to the touch, like withered herbs.
When irritated, he gives a brisk agitation to his
tail; but, when walking at ease, he allows it to
trail and sweep the road over which he passes.
The hairs on the anterior parts of his body are
shorter than those on the posterior: The latter
are turned backward, and the former forward.
The anterior parts are also whither than the po∣sterior.
There is a black stripe upon the breast,
which stretches along the sides, and terminates
on the back near the thighs. The hind legs are
nearly black, and those before almost white,
with a large black spot about the middle. The
great ant-eater runs so slow, that a man can
easily overtake him in the chace. His feet seem
less fitted for running than for climbing, and
seizing cylindrical bodies; for he takes such
a forcible hold of a branch or a stick, that it is
impossible to make him quit it.</P>
<P>The second of these animals, or the middle
ant-eater, is called simply <HI>tamandua</HI> by the Ame∣ricans.
He is much smaller than the former,
being only about eighteen inches from the ex∣tremity
of the muzzle to the origin of the tail.
His head is six inches in length. His muzzle
is long, and crooked downward. The tail is ten
inches long, and naked at the point. The ears are
erect, and an inch in length. The tongue is
round, eight inches long, and placed in a kind
of groove or canal within the lower jaw. The
<PB N="337" REF="399"/>
height of the legs exceeds four inches; and they
are of the same form, and furnished with the
same number of claws, as the great ant-eater.
He climbs, and adheres firmly to the branches,
like the former species, and runs or walks equal∣ly
ill. Neither can he shelter himself with his
tail; because it is too short, and partly not co∣vered
with hair. When he sleeps, he conceals
his head under his neck and fore legs.</P>
<P>The third species is called by the natives of
Guiana <HI>ouatiriouaou.</HI> To distinguish it from
the two former, we have given it the appellation
of the <HI>least ant-eater.</HI> It is much smaller than
the middle kind; for it exceeds not six or seven
inches from the extremity of the muzzle to the
origin of the tail; the head is two inches long,
and the muzzle is proportionally shorter than
that of the middle ant-eater. The tail, which
is seven inches in length, curls downward at the
extremity, where it is naked. The tongue is
narrow, a little compressed, and very long. It
has almost no neck. The head is thick in pro∣portion
to the body. The eyes are placed low,
at no great distance from the corners of the
mouth. The ears are small, and concealed by
the hair. The fore legs are only three inches
long, and their feet have but two claws, the out∣most
of which is much thicker and longer than
the inmost. There are four claws on the hind
feet. The hair on the body is about nine inches
long, soft, and of a brilliant, colour, being a mix∣ture
<PB N="338" REF="400"/>
of red with a bright yellow. The feet are
not fitted for walking, but for climbing, and lay∣ing
hold of objects. The animal mounts upon
trees, and suspends himself on the branches by
the extremity of his tail.</P>
<P>Of this genus, we know only the three spe∣cies
above described. M. Brisson mentions, from
Seba, a fourth species, under the name of the
<HI>long-eared ant-eater.</HI> But this species seems to
be extremely suspicious; for, in Seba's enume∣ration
of the ant-eaters, he says expressly, “We
have, in our cabinet, <HI>six species</HI> of ant-eaters.”
He describes, however, only five; and among
these five he places the <HI>ysquiepatl,</HI> or stifling wea∣sel,
an animal not only of a different species, but
of a different genus, very remote from that of the
ant-eaters; since it has teeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vapulavit aliquando optimus autor de nominibus pro∣priis, si ysquiepati seu vulpeculam Mexicanam, tamanduam dixit; <HI>p.</HI> 66. Quasi aliquam omnino speciem, canis septentri∣onalis sere aemulam, maxilla inferiore crassa et rotunda, binis insignibus dentibus armata, cum tamen de sex diversis specie∣bus sit professus, quod omnes dentibus careant; <HI>Klein, de qua∣drup. p.</HI> 43.</NOTE>, a flat short tongue,
like that of other quadrupeds, and approaches
very near to the weasel kind. Of these six spe∣cies,
pretended to be preserved in the cabinet of
Seba, there remain only four; for the ysquie∣patl,
which is the fifth, is by no means an ant∣eater,
and he makes no mention of the sixth, un∣less
the author intended to rank the scaly lizard
under this genus, which appears not from his
<PB N="339" REF="401"/>
descriptions. The scaly lizard feeds upon ants;
he has a long muzzle, a narrow mouth, with∣out
any apparent teeth, and a long, round tongue.
These characters are common to the scaly lizard
and ant-eaters. But the former differs from all
other quadrupeds by the singularity of having its
body covered with large scales, instead of hair
Besides, it is an animal peculiar to the warm
climates of the Old Continent; while the ant-eaters,
whose bodies are covered with hair, are
only found in the southern regions of the New
World. There remains, therefore, but four spe∣cies,
instead of six announced by Seba; and, of
these four, only one is recognisable from his de∣scriptions,
which is our third, or least ant-eater,
to whom Seba has given but one claw to each
fore foot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fig. 3. <HI>Tamandua,</HI> or <HI>another white American coati.</HI> This animal is totally different from the preceding (he means that of table 37. fig. 2. See the following note). The head is much shorter, and the ears much smaller. The eyes are a little larger, and the inferior part of the muzzle somewhat longer. Their tongues are more similar, both of them being fitted for swallowing ants. The shoulders are large, the body thick and short, and <HI>the fore-feet are armed with one large hooked claw.</HI> The hind legs and feet resemble those of an ape. Its white woolly hair is shorter than that of the preceding; and the same may be said of its crisped tail. This animal is reckoned the rarest of its species. The Aethiopians of Suri∣nam call it <HI>coati,</HI> and relate, that, when apprehended, it rolls itself up, with the feet so closely attached to each other, that it is impossible to force them asunder. They die in a mo∣ment, when immersed in spirit of wine, or in the liquor <HI>kildu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vel; Seba, vol. 1. p. 60. plate 37. fig.</HI> 3.</NOTE>, instead of two. The other three are
so ill described, that it is impossible to distinguish
<PB N="340" REF="402"/>
their true species. I thought it proper to tran∣scribe
these descriptions entire, not only to prove
what I have advanced, but to give an idea of
what credit is due to this writer. The animal
he calls <HI>tamandua murmecophage d'Amerique,
tom. 1. p. 60. tab. 37. fig.</HI> 2. has no relation to
any of the three of which we are here treating.
To be convinced of this, we have only to read
the author's description<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tamandua murmecophage d'Amerique.</HI> This animal is very common in the West-Indies; but the only one we have seen was brought from the East-Indies. Several naturalists have entertained marvellous ideas concerning this creature. Some imagine it to be the <HI>leo for micarius,</HI> others the <HI>formica-leo,</HI> the <HI>formica-vulpes,</HI> the <HI>formica lupus,</HI> &amp;c. M. Poupart, in the <HI>Mem. de l'Acad. royale des sciences, ann. 1704, p.</HI> 235. remarks, that this animal was gray, and made snares, like a spi∣der, for entangling ants; but this comparison seems not to be just. Bastamantanus, who has written a book upon the reptiles mentioned in the Bible, regards the <HI>murmeco-leo,</HI> another name for this animal, as a species of beetle called the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orned beetle,</HI> and which is denominated the <HI>flying slag</HI> by the Germans. (<HI>All this, we perceive, is very important and very use∣ful in the description of a quadruped.</HI>) But, continues the au∣thor, all these descriptions, and several others, express not the nature of this animal, the figure of which we have given from the original. It is covered with soft woolly hair, has a short neck, broad shoulders, a long narrow head and muzzle, from which issues a long tongue, adapted for seizing and swallow∣ing ants. The wisdom of the Creator has furnished these a∣nimals with the necessary organs for collecting food agreeable to their taste. The fore paws have each, <HI>beside the ordinary toes, three other toes,</HI> which have grown above the others, and are armed with hooked claws, the largest of which is on the middle toe. It is with these that they scrape the earth, and pierce the ants nests. The nostrils, which are placed very near the mouth, are strait, rough, and furnished with hair. They discover the retreats of the ants by the scent. The ears are oblong, or pendulous. The hind feet, as in the bear, are divided into five toes, armed with long crooked claws. The tail, which is long and bushy, terminates in a point, and they use it, like the monkeys, in fixing themselves to the branches of trees. The testes of the males are concealed within the skin. The ants, both large and small, become a prey to these animals, which, in their turn, are used by men as a medicine; <HI>Seba, vol. 1. p. 60. tab. 37. fig.</HI> 2.—From such a description nothing can be learned: To apply it to the ant-eaters, as Linnaeus has done, to give, at the same time, this animal three toes on the fore feet, beside the ordinary three, and to make these grow above the others, are absurdities so glaring, as to throw discredit upon the whole narration.</NOTE>. The second, which
<PB N="341" REF="403"/>
he mentions under the name of the <HI>tamandua∣guacu</HI>
of Brasil, or the <HI>bear which eats the ants</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Tamaudua-guacu</HI> of Brasil, or the <HI>bear that eats the ants.</HI> This is the largest species we have ever seen. Marcgrave calls it <HI>Tamandua-guacu,</HI> and Cardan, <HI>ursus formicarius,</HI> or the <HI>bear that eats the ants.</HI> The body is long; the shoulders are broad and high; the head is very long; the muzzle gradu∣ally tapers to a point; and the nostrils are large and open: The tongue, which it thrusts out, to seize the ants, <HI>about the eight part of a cubit,</HI> terminates in a round button. The ears are long and <HI>pendulous.</HI> The eyes are pretty large, and de∣fended by thick hairs. The muzzle is long, wrinkled, and garnished with hair. The rest of the body is covered with long, thick hairs, similar to hogs bristles, but become fine and woolly near the skin, and their colour is a bright chesnut. The hair on the belly is of a deeper brown. Under the tail, which is long, and terminates in a point, the colour of the hair is a bright yellow. The female, whose figure we have given, has eight paps, three on each side of the belly, and two between the fore feet. Witnesses worthy of credit relate, that the females bring forth, at every litter, as many young as they have paps; in which they resemble the swine, <HI>who ne∣ver-bring forth many at a time, unless they have a great number of paps.</HI> Both the fore and hind feet are larger than those de∣scribed in fig. 2. of the preceding table. They use for food the largest kinds of ants.</P>
<P>We have in our cabinet <HI>six species of ant-eaters,</HI> who all differ from each other in the figure of the body, head, feet, and claws. The tamandua represented in fig. 2. (<HI>Note. He is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere speaking of the fsquiepatl, which differs more from the tamandua than a cat from a dog)</HI> is a fourth less than the former; its head, ears, and eyes, are also smaller. His fore foot has only a single claw, which is strong and hooked. The hind foot has three toes and three claws. The hair is soft, woolly, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the colour of that of a young hare. The figure of the fifth species of tamandua is the same. The colour of the hair is a pale red on the back, mixed with silvery white, and a yellowish ash-colour on the belly. This species has four paps, two under the fore and two under the hind legs. (<HI>This spe∣cies, being of the same figure with that which precedes it, must, there∣fore, be a species of ysquiepatl, and not of the tamandua.)</HI> The sixth species has a longer muzzle, and ears erect like those of the fox. None of these species have teeth; <HI>Seba, vol. 1. p. 65. tab. 40. fig.</HI> 1.—It is impossible to comprehend what the author says, or what he means by the sixth species. We only per∣ceive that he clearly contradicts himself, when he tells us that none of these species have teeth, since the ysquiepatl, which is <HI>nominatim</HI> included among the six, has a great number of teeth. From such examples, we may form a judgment of this author and his work. It is a subject of regret, that men who make cabinets of natural objects are not better informed, and that, to gratify their insignificant vanity, and enhance the value of their collections, they undertake the publication of descriptions, which are always replete with such numerous exaggerations and blunders, that the correction of them would require more time than the authors bestow on the composi∣tion of their voluminous works.</P></NOTE>,

p. 65. tab. 40. fig. 1. This is vague and equivo∣cal
language. I agree, however, with Klein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein de quadrup. p. 45.</NOTE>
and Linnaeus, that it may be the true tamandua∣guacu,
or great ant-eater; but so miserably de∣scribed
<PB N="343" REF="405"/>
and represented, that Linnaeus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linn. Syst. Nat. p. 51.</NOTE> has united,
under one species, Seba's first and second animals,
namely, that of tab. 37. fig. 2. and that of tab.
40. fig. 1. M. Brisson has considered the last as
a distinct species; but I know not whether the
establishing of this species be better founded, than
the reproach he throws upon M. Klein for con∣founding
it with that of the great ant-eater.
The only reproach which M. Klein seems to
merit is for adding, to a good description that he
has given of this animal, the false remarks of
Seba. In fine, the third of these animals, of
which we find a figure in Seba, tom. 2. p. 48.
tab. 47. fig. 2. is so ill described, that, notwith∣standing
my confidence in the judgment of M.
Linnaeus and Klein, this animal, from Seba's fi∣gure
and description, can never be referred to the
<HI>tamandua-i,</HI> or middle ant-eater. I would beg of
them to peruse the description<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>The little American tamandua,</HI> or <HI>the ant-eater delineated along with a nest of these insects.</HI> See how it embraces with its fore claws the nest of ants, upon whom alone it feeds. Observe its oblong, thin, narrow head, its short ears, its pointed muzzle, that conceals its long, slender tongue, with which it catches and swallows the ants, as I propose to show in the following plates, (<HI>no such plates appear in his work.</HI>) The head, legs, feet, tail, and the fore part of the body, are straw-coloured. The hind part of the body is reddish brown. Upon the breast there is a belt of silky hair, which gradually disappears about the middle of the back. The tail is short, almost naked, and curled inward; <HI>Seba, vol. 2. p. 48. tab. 47. fig.</HI> 2.—Note. The last characters in this description agree pretty well with the tamandua; but, in general, it is so incorrect, that nothing certain can be determined from it.</NOTE> a second time,
<PB N="344" REF="406"/>
and then form their judgment. Discussions of
this kind are always disagreeable; but they of∣ten
cannot be avoided in details of Natural hi∣story.
Before describing an object, we must
clear it, as far as possible, from all obscurities,
and mark the numberless errors that obstruct the
road to truth, at which it is often difficult to
arrive.</P>
<P>From this critical examination, one thing ap∣pears
to be certain, that three species of ant-eaters
actually exist; that these three are the
great, the middle, and the least ant-eater, or the
<HI>tamanoir,</HI> the <HI>tamandua,</HI> and the <HI>fourmiller;</HI> and
that the fourth species, mentioned by M. Brisson,
under the name of the <HI>long-eared ant-eater,</HI> is
very doubtful, as well as the other species de∣scribed
by Seba. We have seen the great and
the least ant-eater; their skins are in the royal
cabinet, and they are very distinct species. But
we have never seen the middle kind. Our de∣scription
of it shall be taken from Piso and Marc∣grave,
the only authors who ought to be consult∣ed
concerning this animal, because all others
have copied from them.</P>
<P>As to size of body, the <HI>tamandua,</HI> or middle
ant-eater, may be considered as a mean propor∣tional
between the great and the least kind. Like
the great ant-eater, he has a long muzzle, and
four toes on the fore feet; but, like the least
kind, his tail, by which he hangs on the branches
of trees, is naked at the extremity. Both kinds,
<PB N="345" REF="407"/>
when suspended on a branch, balance their bo∣dies,
stretch their muzzles towards the hollows
they discover in trees, thrust in their long tongues,
and quickly retract them, in order to swallow
the insects they have collected.</P>
<P>These three animals, which are so different in
size and proportions of body, have many com∣mon
qualities, both in their structure and man∣ners.
They all feed upon ants, and plunge their
tongues into honey, and other liquid or viscid
substances. They readily pick up crums of bread,
or small morsels of flesh. They are easily tamed.
They can subsist a long time without any food.
They never swallow all the liquor which they
take for drink; for a part of it falls back through
the nostrils. They generally sleep during the
day, and move about in the night. They run
so slowly, that a man may easily overtake them
in an open field. Their flesh, though its taste
be very disagreeable, is eaten by the savages.</P>
<P>At a distance, the great ant-eater has the ap∣pearance
of a fox; and, for this reason, some tra∣vellers
have given him the name of the <HI>American
fox.</HI> He has strength sufficient to defend him∣self
from a large dog, or even from the <HI>jaguar</HI>
or Brasilian cat. When attacked, he at first
sights on end, and, like the bear, annoys the e∣nemy
with the claws of his fore feet, which are
very terrible weapons. He then lies down on
his back, and uses all the four feet; in which si∣tuation
he is almost invincible, and continues the
<PB N="346" REF="408"/>
combat to the last extremity: Even when he
kills his enemy, he quits him not for a long time
after. He is enabled to resist better than most
animals; because he is covered with long bushy
hair, his skin is remarkably thick, his flesh has
little sensation, and his principle of life is very
tenacious.</P>
<P>All the three ant-eaters are natives of the warm
climates of America, as Brasil, Guiana, the coun∣try
of the Amazones, &amp;c. None of them are
to be found in Canada, or the northern regions
of the New World, and therefore should have no
existence in the Old Continent. Kolbe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. du Cap, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 43.</NOTE> and
Desmarchais<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Desmarchais, tom. 3. p. 307.</NOTE>, however, mention these animals
as natives of Africa; but they seem to have con∣founded
the scaly lizard with the ant-eaters.
Perhaps they have been misled by the following
passage in Marcgrave: “<HI>Tamandua-guacu Bra∣silieusibus,
Congensibus (ubi et frequens est</HI>) um∣bulu
<HI>dictus.</HI>” If by <HI>Congensibus</HI> Marcgrave
meant the natives of Congo, the inference of
Kolbe and Desmarchais, that the great ant-eater
was found in Africa, would have been just. But
Marcgrave certainly never saw this animal in A∣frica,
since he acknowledges, that, even in Ame∣rica,
he never saw more than stuffed skins of it.
Desmarchais says simply, that the great ant-eater
is found both in Africa and America, without
adding a single circumstance in proof of the fact.
<PB N="347" REF="409"/>
With regard to Kolbe, no dependence can be had
on his testimony; for a man who saw, at the
Cape of Good Hope, elks and lynxes perfectly
similar to those of Prussia, might also see the ant-eater
in that climate. The ant-eaters are never
mentioned by any author among the natural pro∣ductions
of Africa and Asia. But all the travel∣lers,
and most of the historians of America, take
particular notice of these animals. De Lery, de
Laët<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. des Indes Occidentales, par Jean Laët, p. 485. 556.</NOTE>, le P. d'Abbeville<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mission en l'isle de Maragnon, par le Pere d'Abbeville, p. 248.</NOTE>, Maffé<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Indes, par Maffé, traduit par de Pure, p. 71.</NOTE>, Faber, Nie∣remberg<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Euseb.

and M. de la Condamine<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Voyage de la rivière des Amazones, par M. de la Con∣damine, p. 167.</NOTE>, agree
with Piso, Barrere, &amp;c. that the ant-eaters are
natives of the warm climates of America. We
must, therefore, conclude that Desmarchais and
Kolbe have been deceived, and that these ani∣mals
exist not in the Old Continent.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT
THE GREAT ANT-EATER.</HEAD>
<P>Dr Maudhuit, a learned naturalist and physician,
has sent us from Guiana a well preserved spe∣cimen
<PB N="348" REF="410"/>
of the great ant-eater, which, though pre∣cisely
the same species with that formerly de∣scribed,
has a shorter muzzle. The distance be∣tween
the eye and ear is likewise less, and the
feet are shorter. On the fore feet there are four
claws; the two middlemost being very large,
and the two outermost very small. The hind
feet have five black claws. The muzzle, as
far as the ears, is covered with short brown hair.
About the ears, the hair begins to grow longer;
upon the sides of the body, it is two inches and
a half in length, and as hard to the touch as that
of the wild boar. The colour of the hairs is a
mixture of deep brown and a dirty white. This
animal is three feet eleven inches long.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde, King's physician at Cayenne,
has communicated the following observations re∣garding
this animal.</P>
<P>“The ant-eater inhabits the woods of Gui∣ana,
where there are two species. The indi∣viduals
of the largest kind sometimes weigh
one hundred pounds. They run more slowly
and sluggishly than the hog. They swim a∣cross
large rivers; and, on these occasions, it is
easy to knock them down with a stick. In the
woods, they are shot with muskets. They are
not very common; and the dogs refuse to hunt
them.”</P>
<P>“The great ant-eater tears up with his claws
the nests of the wood-lice, that are every where
to be found on the trees, which he climbs with
ease. It is dangerous to come near this ani∣mal;
<PB N="349" REF="411"/>
for his claws inflict the most dreadful
wounds. He defends himself with success a∣gainst
the most ferocious animals of this Con∣tinent,
as the jaguars, couguars, &amp;c. whom he
tears with his claws, the muscles and tendons of
which are very strong. He kills many dogs;
and therefore they refuse to hunt him.”</P>
<P>“The great ant-eater is often seen in the large
uncultivated savannahs. He is said to feed up∣on
ants. In his stomach, which is larger than
that of a man, I found a vast number of wood∣lice,
that had been recently swallowed. The
structure and dimensions of his tongue seem to
indicate, that he may likewise feed upon ants.
The female brings forth but one young, in
holes of trees, near the root; and, at this pe∣riod,
she is dangerous even to men. The flesh
of this animal is eaten by the common people
of Cayenne; it is black, and has neither fat
nor flavour. His skin is thick and hard; and
his tongue is nearly of the same conical form
with his muzzle.”</P>
<P>“The great ant-eater,” continues M. de la
Borde, “acquires not his full growth in less than
four years. His respiration is performed sole∣ly
by the nostrils. At the first vertebra which
joins the neck to the head, the wind-pipe is
very large; but it suddenly contracts, and
forms a canal, which is continued, in the horn
or trunk that serves the animal for an upper
jaw, to the nostrils. This horn is a foot in
<PB N="350" REF="412"/>
length, being as long, at least, as the rest of the
head. The wind-pipe has no opening into
the mouth; and yet the aperture of the nostrils
is so small, as hardly to admit a common quill.
The eyes are very small, and the animal sees
at a side only. His fat is extremely white.
When he crosses rivers, he carries his long tail
on his back.”</P>
<P>Messrs Aublet and Olivier assure me, that the
great ant-eater feeds by means of his tongue
only, which is covered with a viscid humour, to
which the insects adhere. They add, that his
flesh is not bad.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>THE MIDDLE ANT-EATER.</HEAD>
<P>The animal here represented, the skin of
which is well preserved in the royal cabinet, be∣longs
to the species of <HI>Tamandua</HI> or middle ant-eater.
It differs from the <HI>tamanoir,</HI> or great
ant-eater, not only in size, but in figure. Its
head is proportionally much thicker. The eye
is so small that it exceeds not a line in breadth.
The ears are round, and fringed above with large
black hairs. The body, from the tip of the nose
to the origin of the tail, is thirteen inches long,
and ten inches high. The hair on the top of
the back is fifteen lines long, and that on the
belly, which is of a dirty white colour, is of an
<PB N="351" REF="413"/>
equal length. The tail, which is only seven
inches and a half long, is wholly covered with
long yellow hair, and variegated with bands or
rings slightly tinged with black.</P>
<P>In all this description, there are only two cha∣racters
which accord not with that given of the
tamandua by Marcgrave. 1. The tail is all gar∣nished
with hair; but that of Marcgrave was
naked at the extremity. 2. In our tamandua,
there are five toes on the fore-feet; in that of
Marcgrave there were only four. But, as they
agree in every other article, we must conclude
the animal, whose figure is here represented, to
be a variety of the tamandua, or middle ant-eater,
if not precisely the same species.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde seems to point out this ani∣mal
under the name of the <HI>little tamanoir.</HI></P>
<P>“It has,” says he, “whitish hair, about two
inches long, and weighs above sixty pounds.
It has no teeth; but its claws are very long.
Like the former, it feeds during the night, and
the female brings forth but one at a time. Its
manners are also the same, and it frequents the
large forests. Its flesh is very good; but it is
more rarely to be met with than the great ta∣manoir.”</P>
<P>I wish M. de la Borde had given a more par∣ticular
account of this animal, that all uncertain∣ty
with regard to its species might have been re∣moved.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="352" REF="414"/>
<HEAD>THE LEAST ANT-EATER.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to this animal, M. de la Borde,
at the same time, sent me the following remarks.</P>
<P>“It has bright reddish hair, and somewhat of
a golden colour. It feeds upon ants, which
adhere to its long worm-shaped tongue. This
animal is not larger than a squirrel. It moves
slowly, and is easily taken. Like the sloth, it
fixes itself to a staff; and, as it has no desire to
disengage itself, it may be carried in this man∣ner
wherever we please. It has no cry. We
often find these animals adhering to branches
by their claws. The females bring forth only
one at a time in holes of trees, which they line
with leaves. They feed only in the night.
Their claws are very dangerous; and they
clasp them so close, that it is impossible to loose
them. They are not rare; but it is difficult to
perceive them on the trees.”</P>
<P>M. Vosmaër has made a very erroneous cri∣ticism
on what I have said concerning the least
ant-eater<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. d'un grand ecureuil volant, p. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“I must remark,” says he, “though contrary to
the opinion of M. de Buffon, (see above, p. 349.)
that last year M. Tulbagh sent me an animal,
under the name of <HI>porc de terre,</HI> which is the
<HI>myrmecophagus</HI> of Linnaeus; so that Desmar∣chais

and Kolbe were right in maintaining that
this animal was found in Africa, as well as in
“America. If we form a judgment from the
specimen sent me, which is preserved in spirit
of wine, appears to be new born, and is as large
as a good pig, we must conclude the full grown
animal to be of a considerable size. The fol∣lowing
are its principal characters, as far as
they could be remarked in an animal so young.”</P>
<P>“The muzzle is pretty broad at the point,
round, and somewhat compressed above. The
ears are very broad, long, thin, pointed, and
pendulous. On the fore feet there are four
toes; the first and third are of equal length,
the second sowewhat longer, and the fourth or
exterior one a little shorter than the third.
The four claws are very long, a little hooked,
sharp, and nearly of an equal size. On the
hind feet there are sive toes, the three inter∣mediate
ones being nearly equal in length,
and the two exterior much shorter; the claws
are smaller, and the two exterior ones are
least. The tail, without being long, is thick,
and terminates in a point. The two <HI>Myr∣mecophagi</HI>
of Seba, tom. 1. tab. 37. fig. 2.
and tab. 40. fig. 1. are certainly the same,
and differ only in colour; and the figures gi∣ven
of them are good. This is a particular
species, totally different from the <HI>tamandua∣guacu</HI>
of Marcgrave, or the <HI>tamanoir</HI> of M.
de Buffon.”</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="419"/>
From this passage, it might be thought that
I was deceived with regard to the animal repre∣sented
by Seba, tab. 37. fig. 2. However, I
have said precisely the same thing with M.
Vosmaër; for I expressed myself in the follow∣ing
words “The animal called <HI>Tamandua, mur∣mecophage
d'Amerique,</HI> by Seba, tom. 1. p. 60.
tab. 37. fig. 2. has no resemblance to any of
the three of which we are here treating.” Now,
the three American animals which I mentioned
were the great, middle, and least ant-eaters.
What M. Vosmaër remarks, therefore, contra∣dicts
nothing I have advanced; which amounts
to this, that these three animals are peculiar
to America, and not to be found in the Old
Continent. This language is so precise, that
M. Vosmaër can have nothing to oppose to it.
If the <HI>Myrmecophagus</HI> of Seba, tab. 37. fig. 2.
is found in Africa, it only proves that Seba was
deceived when he calls it the American <HI>Myrme∣cophagus,</HI>
but can have no effect upon what I
have advanced, and still persist in mantaining,
that the three ant-eaters are found in America,
and not in Africa.</P>

<P>All lizards are entirely covered with a smooth
skin, variegated with spots which resemble scales.
But the short and long tailed manis have no
scales on the throat, breast, and belly. The
long-tailed manis, like other quadrupeds, has
hair on all the inferior parts of the body; and
the short-tailed manis has, on these parts, only
a smooth skin without hair. The scales which
cover the other parts of both these animals
adhere not entirely to the skin, but are strongly
fixed by their under part only. Like the quills
<PB N="357" REF="422"/>
of the porcupine, they are moveable, and are
elevated or depressed, according to the will of
the animals. When irritated, they erect their
scales, and particularly when they roll themselves
up like a ball. These scales are so large, hard,
and poignant, that they repel every animal of
prey. They form an armour which wounds
as well as resists. The most cruel and famish∣ed
creatures, as the tiger, panther, &amp;c. endea∣vour
in vain to devour these animals. They
trample upon, and toss them about; but, when∣ever
they attempt to seize them, they receive ve∣ry
dangerous and painful wounds. No animal
of prey is able to face, crush, or suffocate them,
although it loads them with its whole weight.
The fox is afraid of the hedgehog when rol∣led
up; but he forces it to extend, by tram∣pling
on it with his feet. As soon as the head
appears, he seizes it by the snout, and thus ac∣complishes
his purpose. But, of all animals,
without excepting the porcupine, the armour of
the manis is the most offensive. When these a∣nimals
contract their bodies, and present their
arms, they brave the fury of all their enemies.
Besides, when rolled up, these animals assume
not, like the hedgehog, a globular figure:
Their body, in contracting, takes the form of a
clue; but their long thick tail remains without,
and serves as a ring or belt to the body. This
exterior part, by which it would appear the a∣nimals
might be seized, defends itself; for it is
<PB N="358" REF="423"/>
furnished, both above and below, with scales as
hard and sharp as those which cover the body;
and, as it is convex above and flat below, and
has nearly the figure of a half pyramid, the an∣gular
sides are covered with sharp erected scales;
so that the tail seems to be still more carefully
defended than the body, the inferior parts of
which are deprived of scales.</P>
<P>The short tailed manis is larger than the long
tailed kind. His fore feet are covered with
scales to their extremity; but the feet of the
long tailed species, and even a part of the fore
legs, are only covered with hair. The scales of
the former are larger, thicker, more convex, and
less chamfered than those of the latter, which
are armed with three sharp points, while those
of the short tailed manis are not pointed, but
uniformly sharp. The long tailed manis has
hair on the inferior parts of the body: The short
tailed kind has no hair under the body; but,
between the scales which cover the back, there
are some hairs as thick and long as hogs bristles,
which are wanting in the long tailed species.
These are all the essential distinctions that we
have observed from examining the stuffed skins
of both these animals, which differ so much
from all other quadrupeds, that they have been
regarded as a kind of monsters. The differences
we have pointed out, being general and constant,
authorise us to conclude the short and long tailed
manis to be distinct species. We recognised
<PB N="359" REF="424"/>
these relations and discrepances not only by in∣specting
three subjects, but likewise by perusing
all the remarks of travellers and naturalists.</P>
<P>The short tailed manis, when full grown, is
from six to eight feet long, including the tail,
which is nearly the length of the body, but ap∣pears
to be proportionally shorter while the ani∣mal
is young; the scales are also smaller and
thinner, and of a paler colour; but, in the adult
animal, their colour becomes deeper, and they
acquire such a degree of hardness as to resist a
musket ball. The long tailed manis, as former∣ly
remarked, is much less than the short tailed
species. Both of them have some relation to the
great and middle ant-eaters; for they feed upon
ants, have very long tongues, a narrow mouth,
without any apparent teeth, very long bodies
and tails, feet and toes nearly of the same size
and figure, though different in number, both spe∣cies
of manis having five toes to each foot, while
the ant-eaters have only four on the fore feet.
The latter are covered with hair, and the former
with scales; neither are they natives of the same
Continent. The ant-eaters are found only in
America, and the two species of manis in the
East Indies and Africa, where they are called
<HI>Quogelo</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We find in the woods a quadruped which the Negroes call <HI>qugelo.</HI> From the neck, to the extremity of the tail, it is covered with sharp scales, resembling the leaves of the arti∣choke. They are close, and so thick and strong as to defend it from the claws and teeth of the most rapacious animals. It is perpetually chaced, and easily overtaken, by the tigers and leopards But, as its claws and mouth would be a feeble defence against the dreadful tusks and talons of these animals, Nature has taught it to roll itself up like a ball, by folding its tail under the belly, and contracting its body in such a manner as to present on all sides the sharp points of its scales. The tiger or leopard, when they turn the creature too rude∣ly with their paws, receive such wounds as oblige them to re∣tire. The Negroes kill it with battons, sell the skin to the Whites, and eat the flesh, which they say is white and deli∣cate. Its tongue is enormously long, and covered with a vis∣cid liquor. It goes in quest of ants nests, and the haunts of insects; extends its tongue, which it either pushes into their holes, or lays it flat upon the places where they pass. These insects, attracted by the odour, quickly run toward the tongue, remain entangled in the viscid liquor; and, when the tongue is properly loaded with them, the animal retracts it, and devours them. This creature is not mischievous. He never attacks any person, but, provided he can find a suffi∣cient quantity of ants, is perfectly contented. The largest of this species that has been observed, is eight feet long, com∣prehending the tail, which is four feet; <HI>Voyage de Desmarchais, tom. 1. p.</HI> 200.</NOTE> by the Negroes, who eat the flesh of these
<PB N="360" REF="425"/>
animals, which they reckon delicate and whole∣some,
and use their scales for several purposes.
In fine, these creatures have nothing disgusting
about them but their figure. They are gentle
and innocent, feeding only on insects. They
run slowly, and cannot escape from a man, but
by concealing themselves in holes of rocks, or in
those they dig in the earth, where the females
bring forth their young. They are two extra∣ordinary
species, not numerous, and very useless.
The oddness of their form seems to be intended to
constitute the last shade between the figure of
quadrupeds and that of reptiles.</P>

<PB REF="426"/>
<HEAD>THE ARMADILLO.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a quadruped is mentioned, the
very name seems to convey the idea of
an animal covered with hair. In the same man∣ner,
when we speak of a bird or a fish, feathers
and scales present themselves to the imagination,
and appear to be inseparable attributes of these
beings. Nature, however, as if she intended to
withdraw herself from all method, and to elude
our most general views, contradicts our ideas and
denominations, knows not our arbitrary charac∣ters,
and astonishes us still more by her excep∣tions
than by her laws. Quadrupeds, which
should be regarded as constituting the first class
of animated nature, and are, next to man, the
most conspicuous creatures in this world, are,
nevertheless, neither superior in every respect,
nor separated, by permanent characters or attri∣butes,
from all other beings. The first charac∣ter,
that of having four feet, and from which
their name is derived, is found among the lizards,
frogs, &amp;c. who differ so much from quadrupeds
in every other article, that they have, with pro∣priety,
been thrown into a distinct class. The
second general property, that of being vivipa∣rous,
belongs not exclusively to quadrupeds, but
is common to them and the cetaceous animals.
<PB N="362" REF="427"/>
In fine, the third attribute, that of being covered
with hair, which appears to be the less equivo∣cal,
because it is the most conspicuous, exists not
in several species which cannot be retrenched
from the order of quadrupeds, since, with the
exception of this character alone, their resem∣blance
to each other is complete: And, as these
seeming exceptions of Nature are, in reality, but
the shades she employs to connect beings of the
most remote kinds, we ought to feize these sin∣gular
relations as often as they present them∣selves.
The armadillos, instead of hair, are co∣vered,
like the turtles, the lobsters, &amp;c. with a
solid crust. The manis is armed with scales si∣milar
to those of fishes. The porcupine carries
a kind of prickly feathers, without vanes, but
having quills like those of birds. thus, in the
class of quadrupeds alone, and in the most con∣stant
and apparent character of these animals,
that of being covered with hair, Nature varies,
by making them approach the three very diffe∣rent
classes of birds, fishes, and the crustaceous
tribes. Hence we ought never to judge of the
nature of beings by a single character; for it will
always be imperfect and fallacious. Even two
or three characters, though extremely general,
are often insufficient; and, as I have frequently
remarked, it is only by the union of all the at∣tributes,
and an enumeration of all the charac∣ters,
that a judgment can be formed concerning
the permanent and essential qualities of the pro∣ductions
<PB N="363" REF="428"/>
of Nature. Accurate descriptions, with∣out
any attempt toward definitions, a more scru∣pulous
examination of the discrepances than of
the similarities, a particular attention to the ex∣ceptions,
and even to the slightest shades, are the
true guides, and, I will venture to affirm, the
only means we possess of investigating Nature.
If the time lost in framing definitions and me∣thodical
arrangements, had been employed in
making good descriptions, we should not, at this
day, have found Natural History in her infancy,
but would have had less difficulty in removing
her swaddling cloths and her toys, and, per∣haps,
might have advanced her age; for we
would have written more for science, and less
against error.</P>
<P>But to return to our subject. Among vivipa∣rous
quadrupeds, as we have seen, there are se∣veral
species of animals which are not covered
with hair. The armadillos alone constitute an
entire genus, which includes a number of distinct
species, and all of them are covered with a crust
resembling bone. This crust covers the head,
neck, back, flanks, rump, and extends to the ex∣tremity
of the tail. The crust itself is also co∣vered
with a thin, smooth, transparent skin. The
only parts to which this crust extends not, are
the throat, the breast, and the belly, which are
covered with a granulated skin, like that of a
deplumed hen; and, upon an accurate inspec∣tion
of these parts, we discover, in different
<PB N="364" REF="429"/>
places, the rudiments of scales, of the same sub∣stance
with the crust. Hence the skin of these
animals, even where it is most flexible, has a
tendency to become osseous; but the ossification
is only completed in those places where the skin
is thickest, as on the superior and external parts
of the body, and on the limbs. The crust con∣sists
not of one piece, like that of the turtle, but
is divided into several bands, connected to each
other by membranes, which allow a certain de∣gree
of movement to this coat of mail. The
number of these bands depends not, as has been
imagined, on the age of the animal. The new
born and the adult armadillo have the same
number of bands, as appears by comparing the
young with the old; and, though we cannot be
certain that those which have more or fewer
bands never intermix or produce, it is at least
very probable, since the difference in the number
of moveable bands is constant, that they are
either distinct species, or permanent varieties,
occasioned by the influence of different climates.
In this uncertainty, which time alone can re∣move,
we have chosen to treat of all the arma∣dillos
under one article, enumerating, at the
same time, each kind as if it were a particular
species.</P>
<P>Le Pere d'Abbeville<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mission au Maragnon, par le Père d'Abbeville, p. 247.</NOTE> appears to have first
distinguished the armadillos by different names,
which have been adopted by most subsequent
<PB N="365" REF="430"/>
authors. He has pointed out pretty clearly six
species: 1. The twelve-banded armadillo, or
<HI>kabassou.</HI> 2. The eight-banded, or <HI>tatouète.</HI>
3. The six-banded, or <HI>encuberto</HI> of Marcgrave.
4. The three-banded, or <HI>tatu-apara.</HI> 5. The
eighteen-banded, or <HI>cirquinçon.</HI> 6. The nine-banded,
or <HI>cachichame.</HI> The different species
have been confounded by other travellers. But
we have occasion to borrow the descriptions of
two kinds only, having seen the other four.</P>
<P>All the armadillos, excepting the eighteen-banded,
have two bony shields, one on the
shoulders, another on the rump. Each of these
consists of one solid piece. But the cuirass, which
is likewise osseous, and covers the body, is di∣vided
transversely into more or fewer moveable
bands, connected by a flexible skin. But the
armadillo with eighteen bands has only one
shield, which is upon his shoulders. The rump,
instead of a shield, is covered with moveable
bands, similar to those above mentioned. We
shall now describe each species particularly, ac∣cording
to the number of bands.</P>

<P>Clusius is the first author who described this
animal; and, though his description was taken
from a drawing only, it is easy to perceive, from
the remarkable characters of having three move∣able
bands on the back and a short tail, that it
is the same species of which Marcgrave has gi∣ven
a good description under the name of <HI>Tatu
apara.</HI> The head is oblong and almost pyra∣midal;
the eyes are small, the ears short and
rounded, and the top of the head is covered with
a helmet consisting of one piece. On all the
feet there are five toes. The two middle claws
of the fore feet are very large, the two lateral
<PB N="367" REF="432"/>
ones smaller, and the fifth, or exterior one, is
the least. The claws of the hind feet are shorter
and more equal. The tail exceeds not two
inches in length, and is wholly covered with a
shell or crust. The body is a foot long, and about
eight inches over at the broadest part. The
back, or cuirass, is divided into four joints, and
composed of three transverse moveable bands, by
which the animal is enabled to bend its body
and to roll itself up like a ball. The skin which
forms the joints is very flexible. The shields
which cover the shoulders and rump consist of
pentangular pieces, very equally ranged. The
three moveable bands between the two shields
are composed of square or oblong pieces, and on
each piece there is a number of lenticular scales
of a yellowish white colour. Marcgrave adds, that,
when the creature lies down to sleep, or when
touched by any person, he gathers his feet to∣gether,
puts his head below his belly, and makes
the whole body so perfectly round, that he has
more the appearance of a sea-shell than of a
land animal. This contraction is effected by
means of two large muscles on the sides of the
body; and it is with difficulty that the strongest
man can force an extension with his hands.
Piso and Ray have added nothing to Marc∣grave's
description. But it is singular, that Seba,
who has given a figure and description nearly
the same with those of Marcgrave, should not on∣ly
not mention this author, but assert, with confi∣dence,
<PB N="368" REF="433"/>
“that this animal is unknown to the na∣turalists;
that it is extremely rare; that it is
found in the most remote countries of the East
Indies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hunc remotissimi et maxime versus orientem siti Indiae loci proferunt—Animal hocce rarum admodum et haud vulgare est, nec ejus mentionem ab ullo autorum sactam re∣perimus, &amp;c.; <HI>Seba, vol. 1. p.</HI> 62.</NOTE>, &amp;c. while, infact, this Brasilian ar∣madillo”
is excellently described by Marcgrave,
and the species as common as any other, not in∣deed
in the East Indies, but in America, where
it is very frequent. The only real difference
between the description of Seba and that of
Marcgrave is, that the latter gives the animal
five toes to each foot, and the former only four.
One of them must be wrong; for they both e∣vidently
describe the same animal.</P>
<P>Fabius Columna<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aquatil et terrestr. animal. Obs. Fab. Columna auctore, p. 15. tab. 16. fig. 1. 2. 3</NOTE> has described and given

in the form of a ball, which appears to
have had four moveable bands. But, as this au∣thor

<P>This armadillo is larger than the former.
The top of the head, the neck, body, limbs, and
tail, are covered with a very hard osseous crust,
<PB N="370" REF="437"/>
composed of pretty large pieces, most elegantly
placed. Each of the two shields on the shoul∣ders
and rump consists of one piece. There is,
indeed, beyond the shield on the shoulder, and
near the head, a moveable band which enables
the animal to bend his neck. The shield on
the shoulders consists of five parallel rows, which
are composed of pieces that have five or six angles,
with a kind of oval figure in each. The cuirass on
the back, or the part between the two shields, is
divided into six bands, connected to each other,
and to the shields, by seven junctures of a thick
flexible skin. These bands consist of large square
or oblong pieces. On the skin of the joints there
are several whitish hairs, similar to those on the
throat, breast, and belly. All the inferior parts
of the body, instead of a hard crust, are covered
with a granulated skin. The shield on the rump
has a fringed border, the mosaic work of which
resembles that of the moveable bands; the rest
is composed of pieces very similar to those of
the shield on the shoulders. The crust of the
head is long, broad, and consists of one piece as
far as the moveable band on the neck. The
<PB N="371" REF="438"/>
muzzle is sharp, the eyes small and sunk, and
the tongue narrow and pointed. The ears,
which are naked, having neither hair nor crust,
are short and brown like the skin of the dorsal
junctures. There are eighteen teeth in each jaw,
and five toes on each foot, with pretty long,
rounded, and rather narrow than broad claws.
The head and muzzle nearly resemble those of a
pig. The tail is thick at its origin, and gradual∣ly
tapers toward the point, where it is very thin,
and rounded. The colour of the body is a red∣dish
yellow. The animal is commonly plump
and fat; and the penis of the male is very con∣spicuous.
He digs the earth with great ease by
the assistance of his snout and his claws. He
lives in his burrow during the day, and comes
out in the night only to search for food. He
drinks often, and feeds upon fruits, roots, in∣sects,
and birds when he can seize them.</P>

than those of the six-banded armadillo. The
eyes are small and black; there are four toes
on the fore, and five on the hind feet; the head
is covered with a helmet, the shoulders and
rump with two shields, and the body with a cui∣rass
composed of eight moveable bands connec∣ted
to each other and to the two shields by nine
junctures of flexible skin. The tail is likewise co∣vered
with eight moveable rings of crust, and nine
joints of flexible skin. The colour of the cui∣rass
on the back is an iron-gray, and the flanks
and tail are of a whitish gray mixed with spots
of iron-gray. The belly is covered with a
whitish, granulated skin, interspersed with some
hairs. The head of the individual described by
Marcgrave was three inches long, the ears near∣ly
two, the legs about three, the two middle
toes of the fore feet one inch, and the claws
<PB N="373" REF="440"/>
half an inch. The length of the body, from
the neck to the origin of the tail, was seven
inches, and that of the tail nine. The crust of
the shields was interspersed with prominent white
spots, of the size of lentiles. The moveable bands
were marked with triangular figures. This crust
is not very hard; for the smallest shot pierces

<P>Nieremberg's description of this animal is ex∣tremely
imperfect; that of Wormius and Grew
is much better. Wormius's individual was an

adult, and one of the largest of the species; that
of Grew was younger and smaller. We shall
only give their descriptions as far as they corre∣spond
with our own specimen. Besides, it is
probable that the nine-banded armadillo is not
a distinct species from the eight-banded; for, in
every other respect, they seem to have a perfect
resemblance to each other. We have two eight∣banded
armadillos, which are dried, and appear
to be males; and we have seven or eight with
nine bands; one of them, which is entire, is
a female, the others are so disfigured in drying,
that the sex is not distinguishable. It would ap∣pear,
therefore, that the eight-banded is the male,
and the nine-banded the female. This is only
a conjecture, which I mention here, because,
in the following article, we shall see two arma∣dillos,
one of which has more rows on the rump∣shield
than the other, and yet their resemblance
is so great, that this difference may depend sole∣ly
on sex; for it is not improbable, that a great∣er
number of rows and of moveable bands may
be necessary for facilitating the gestation and de∣livery

In the individual described by Wormius, the
head was five inches long, from the end of the
muzzle to the ears, and eighteen inches from
the ears to the origin of the tail, which last was
a foot in length, and composed of twelve rings.
In an individual of the same species described
by Grew, the head was three inches, the body
seven and a half, and the tail eleven. The
proportions of the head and body correspond
very well; but the difference in the tail is too
considerable; and, it is probable, that, in Wor∣mius's
individual, the tail had been broken, for
it ought to have exceeded a foot in length. As
in this species the tail tapers to a point as small
as an awl, and is at the same time very brittle,
it is rare to preserve a specimen with the tail
entire, as in that described by Grew.</P>

<P>This animal seems to be the largest of the
armadillo kind. Its head is thicker and broad∣er,
and its muzzle not so slender as those of
<PB N="376" REF="443"/>
the other species. The legs and feet are also
thicker, and the tail has no crust, a peculiarity
which sufficiently distinguishes it from all the o∣thers.
It has five toes on all the feet, and
twelve distinct moveable bands. The shield on
the shoulders consists only of four or five rows,
each of which is composed of pretty large qua∣drangular
pieces. The moveable bands are like∣wise
composed of large and almost square pieces.
Those which compose the rump shield are nearly
similar to those on the shoulders. The helmet
on the head consists of large, irregular pieces.
Between the joints of the moveable bands, and
in other parts of the armour, there are some
hairs, like hog's bristles. Upon the breast, bel∣ly,
legs, and tail, we perceive the rudiments of
scales, which are round, hard, and polished, like
the rest of the crust, and, round these, are small
tufts of hair. The pieces which compose the
helmet, the two shields, and the cuirass, being
proportionably larger and fewer in number in
the twelve banded than in the other armadillos,
entitle us to conclude that it is the largest of the
<PB N="377" REF="444"/>
kind. In that represented in the figure, the head
was seven inches long, and the body twenty-one.
But we are uncertain whether that represented
in the former plate belongs to the same species.
They are similar in many respects, particularly
in having twelve moveable bands. But they
likewise differ in so many articles, that it is per∣haps
rash to ascribe these differences to sex alone.</P>

<P>Mr Grew first described this animal from a
skin preserved in the cabinet of the Royal Society.
All the other armadillos have two shields, one
on the shoulders, and another on the rump.
But the eighteen banded species has only one
shield, which is upon the shoulders. It has ob∣tained
the name of the <HI>weasel armadillo,</HI> because
<PB N="378" REF="445"/>
its head resembles that of the weasel. From
Grew's description of this animal, we find that
the body was about ten inches long, the head
three, and the tail five. The legs were from
two to three inches in length; the forehead was
large and flat; the eyes were small, and the
ears an inch long. It had five toes on each foot,
and large claws, of an inch long, on the three
middle toes, the others being smaller. The ar∣mour
of the head and that of the legs were
composed of round scales, about a quarter of an
inch in diameter. The armour of the neck con∣sisted
of one piece, formed of small square scales.
The shield on the shoulders consisted also of one
piece, composed of several rows of similar small
square scales. These rows on the shield, in this as
well as all the other species, are continuous, and
adhere by a symphysis. The rest of the body,
from the shield on the shoulders to the tail, is
covered with moveable bands separated from
each other by a flexible skin. These bands are
eighteen in number. The anterior ones are
largest, and composed of small square and ob∣long
pieces. The posterior consist of round and
square pieces; and the extremity of the armour,
near the tail, is of a parabolic figure. The first
half of the tail is covered with six rings, com∣posed
of small square pieces; and the second
half, as far as the point, is covered with irregular
scales. The breast, the belly, and the ears, are
naked, as in the other species. Of all the ar∣madillos,
<PB N="379" REF="446"/>
from the moveable bands which ex∣tend
to the tail, it would appear that this species
has the power of contracting and rolling itself
up like a ball with the greatest ease.</P>
<P>We have taken this description, as well as Mr
Ray, from Grew. M. Brisson has also follow∣ed
Mr Ray, and given a good description of this
animal, which he calls simply the <HI>armadillo.</HI>
But it is singular, that Linnaeus, though he had
the descriptions of Grew and Ray before his
eyes, should mention this same animal as ha∣ving
but one band<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dasypus unicintus, tegmine tripartito, pedibus pentadac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ylis; <HI>Linn. syst. nat. p.</HI> 53.</NOTE>, when it has no less than
eighteen. This notion proceeds from a blun∣der
as evident as that of mistaking the <HI>tatu
seu armadillo Africanus</HI> of Seba, for the <HI>tatu
mustelinus</HI> of Grew, which, even from the de∣scription
of these authors, are very different a∣nimals.
It is equally certain that the animal
described by Grew is a real existing species, as
the existence of that of Seba, at least as he de∣describes
it, is doubtful. According to him, this
African armadillo has the whole armour of its
body divided into three parts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scutum osseum toto incumbens corpori tripartitum est; <HI>Seba, tom. 1. p.</HI> 47.</NOTE>. If this were
the case, instead of many bands, the back and
sides would be covered with one piece bounded
by the shields on the shoulders and rump. This
passage is the foundation of Linnaeus's error,
<PB N="380" REF="447"/>
who calls the animal <HI>Dasypus unicinctus, tegmine
tripartito.</HI></P>
<P>All the armadillos are natives of America.
Before the discovery of the New World, they
were totally unknown. They are never men∣tioned
by the antients; modern travellers uni∣formly
speak of them as animals peculiar to
Mexico, Brasil, Guiana, &amp;c. and no person e∣ver
pretends to have seen any of the species ei∣ther
in Asia or Africa. Some voyagers have
indeed confounded the armadillos of America
with the manis, or scaly lizard of the East In∣dies.
Others have imagined that they existed
on the West coasts of Africa, because they have
sometimes been transported from Brasil to Gui∣ney.

<P>“Nature has armed this creature with a hard crust and large scales, like a corslet, by which means the inwards and flesh are easily taken out, without injuring its natural figure.

all the modern historians, mention these animals
as natives of South America. Of all the writers
I have quoted, Piso alone has advanced, but
without any authority, that the armadillos are
found in the East Indies<NOTE N="***" PLACE="foot">Cum in Occidentalis non solum, sed et Orientalis Indiae partibus frequens adeo sit hoc inusitatae conformationis a∣nimal, non mirum si vel nomine, vel magnitudine, figura quoque subinde variet; <HI>Pison. hist. nat. Brasil. p.</HI> 100.</NOTE>, as well as in A∣merica.
He has probably confounded the scaly
lizards with the armadillos. The former are called
<HI>armadillos</HI> by the Spaniards. This error has been
adopted by our nomenclators and describers of
cabinets, who have not only admitted the arma∣dillos
into the East Indies, but into Africa,
though none of them ever existed in those parts
<PB N="382" REF="449"/>
of the world, except such as were transported
from America.</P>
<P>The climate and country of these animals,
therefore, are not equivocal: But it is more
difficult to determine the size of each kind.
With this view, we have compared the skins of
a great number preserved in the royal and other
cabinets: We have also compared all the descrip∣tions
of authors with our own, without being
able to draw any certain conclusion. It only ap∣pears,
that the twelve and six banded armadillos
are the largest, and that the three, eight, nine, and
eighteen banded species are the least. The head
of the larger kinds is more solid and harder than
that of the smaller; the pieces of which it is com∣posed
are larger and fewer in number; the move∣able
bands encroach less upon each other; and the
skin and flesh are harder and not so good. Piso
says, that the flesh of the six banded armadil∣lo
is not eatable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prima et maxima (<HI>species</HI>) tatupeba, cujus descriptioni supersedeo, utpote non edulis; <HI>Pison. bist. nat. Brasil. p</HI> 100.</NOTE>; and Nieremberg assures us
that it is noxious<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quaedam innoxia et gratissimi alimenti sunt, alia noxia et venenata, ut vomitu ac flatu alvi sincopem inducant.—Distinguuntur testarum seu laminarum numero: Innoxia oc∣tonis, noxia senis constant; <HI>Nieremberg, hist. nat. Peregr. p.</HI> 159.</NOTE>. Barrere tells us, that
the twelve banded armadillo has a strong odour
of musk. All authors agree, that the flesh of
the three banded, and particularly that of the
eight banded species, is as good as that of a pig.
<PB N="383" REF="450"/>
They likewise remark, that all the small kinds
frequent the plains and marshes; and that the
largest species are only found in dry and eleva∣ted
places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the woods of Oronook and Guiana, there are armadil∣los four times larger than those of the plains; <HI>Hist. nat. de l'Orenoque, par Gumilla, tom. 2. p.</HI> 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All these animals have the faculty of contrac∣ting
their bodies in the form of a ball with
more or less facility. When contracted, the de∣fect
of their armour is most conspicuous in those
which have fewest moveable bands. In this si∣tuation,
the three banded species presents two
large voids between the shields and the armour
of the back. None of them can assume a form
so perfectly round as the hedgehog; they have
rather the figure of a globe very much flattened
at the poles.</P>
<P>The singular crust with which they are co∣vered
is a real bone, composed of small conti∣guous
pieces, which, without being moveable
or articulated, except at the joints of the bands,
are united by a symphysis, and may all be
separated from each other when heated in a
fire. When the animal is alive, these small
pieces, both in the shields and moveable bands<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">“The nine-banded armadillo is very sensible. When his scales are pressed, he complains, and rolls himself up like a ball. I remarked, that all the rows, beside the movement by which they joint into each other, have another along the spine of the back, which enables them to extend and enlarge themselves,” &amp;c.; <HI>Nouv. voy. aux isles de l'Amerique, tom. 2. p.</HI> 388,</NOTE>,
<PB N="384" REF="451"/>
obey, in some measure, its motions, especially
that by which it contracts itself. If this were
not the case, it could not possibly roll itself up.
These pieces are of different figures in different
species, and are always arranged with as much
regularity as the most elegant mosaic work. The
thin pellicle which covers the crust, is a transpa∣rent
skin, which has the effect of a varnish to
the whole body. This skin rises a good deal,
and even changes the reliefs of the mosaic work,
which are very different when it is removed.
Besides, this osseous crust is only a cover, totally
independent of the internal parts of the animal's
body, whose bones, and other organs, are con∣structed
like those of all other quadrupeds.</P>
<P>The armadillos, in general, are inoffensive a∣nimals,
and do no mischief, unless they are allowed
to enter the gardens, where they eat melons, po∣tatoes,
and other roots and pot-herbs. Though
natives of the warm climates of America, they
can live in temperate regions. Some years ago,
I saw one in Languedoc, which was fed in the
house, and went about freely without doing any
harm. They walk quickly; but they can nei∣ther
run, nor leap, nor climb trees; so that they
can never escape those who pursue them. Their
only resources are to conceal themselves in their
holes, or, if too distant from their retreats, to
endeavour to dig a hole before they are seized;
for the mole digs not more quickly than the ar∣madillo.
<PB N="385" REF="452"/>
Before being totally concealed, they
are sometimes caught by the tail, when they
make such a powerful resistance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The nine-banded armadillos, when their head and part of the body are concealed in the hole, believe themselves to be safe; and, indeed, they have nothing to fear, unless the fol∣lowing expedient be used to drag them out. The Indian ar∣rives, and seizes the animal by the tail, which is very long. The armadillo opens his scales, and attaches them so strong∣ly to the walls of his hole, that the Indian may pull off the tail, but cannot force the animal from his retreat. In this case, the hunter tickles him with a stick or the end of his bow, which makes the animal contract his scales, and then he is taken without difficulty; <HI>Hist. nat. de l'Orénoque, par Gumilla, tom. 3. p.</HI> 226.</NOTE>, that the tail
is left in the hands of the enemy. To prevent
mutilating them in this manner, it is necessary
to widen the holes, and then they are taken
without resistance. Whenever they are seized,
they roll themselves up, and never extend till
they are placed near a fire. Their crust, though
hard and rigid, is so sensible, that, when touched
by the finger, that animal feels the impression,
and instantly contracts itself. When their holes
are deep, they are forced out by smoke or by
water. They are said to remain in their holes
during a third part of the year<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Antilles, par le Père du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 298.</NOTE>. It is certain,
however, that they never come out but during
the night, when they go in quest of food. The
armadillo is▪ hunted with small dogs<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. nat. des Antilles, p. 123.</NOTE>, by whom
<PB N="386" REF="453"/>
they are soon overtaken. They contract them∣selves
long before the dogs come up with them;
and in this state they are seized and carried off.
When on the top of a precipice, they escape
both the dogs and the hunter; for they contract,
and allow themselves to roll down like a bullet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hernandès, hist. Mexic. p. 314.</NOTE>,
without breaking their crust, or receiving any
injury.</P>
<P>These animals are fat, and very fruitful. The
male exhibits, by his external organs, great ge∣nerative
powers. The female is said to produce
every four months<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Histoire naturelle de l'Orénoque, par Gumilla, p. 225.</NOTE>; and, accordingly, the spe∣cies
is very numerous. As they make excellent
eating, they are hunted in every manner. They
are easily taken with snares, that are laid on the
edges of waters and other moist places, which
they always frequent. They never remove far
from their holes, which are very deep, and which
they endeavour to regain upon every alarm.
They are said not to be afraid of the bite of the
rattle-snake<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nieremberg, hist. nat. Peregr. p. 159.</NOTE>, though it is as dangerous as that
of the viper. It is said that they live in peace
with these reptiles, who are often found in their
holes. The savages employ the crust of the ar∣madillo
for several purposes. They paint it
with different colours, and make baskets, boxes,
and other small vessels of it. Monard, Xime∣nes,
<PB N="387" REF="454"/>
and other writers, ascribe great medicinal
powers to different parts of these animals. They
assure us, that the crust, reduced to a powder,
and taken internally, even in a small dose, is a
powerful sudorific; that the hip-bone, pulveri∣sed,
cures the venereal disease; that the first
bone of the tail, applied to the ear, restores hear∣ing
to the deaf, &amp;c. We can give no credit to
these extraordinary powers. The crust and
bones of the armadillo are of the same nature
with the bones of other animals. Effects so
marvellous can only be produced by imaginary
virtues.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Our original figure of the six-banded armadil∣lo
was taken from a preserved crust. The figure
now represented was drawn from the life by M.
de Séve, who, at the same time, sent me the fol∣lowing
description.</P>
<P>“The male is fourteen inches long, without
reckoning the tail, and corresponds pretty
well with the description given in your work.
However, in your description, it is said the
shoulder-shield consists of five parallel rows of
small pentangular pieces, with an oval in each.
<PB N="388" REF="455"/>
But these characters seem to vary; for, in the
animal I have drawn, the shoulder-shield is
composed of six parallel rows, of which the
small pieces are irregular hexagons. The
rump-shield consists of ten parallel rows, and
the small pieces are narrow squares. The
rows near the tail lose their square form, and
become more round. The tail, a part of which
was broken off, is four inches and a half in
length; but, in the drawing, I have made it
six inches. In walking, it carries the tail high,
and a little crooked. The trunk is covered
with an osseuous crust as well as the body. The
trunk has six unequal rows, composed of small
irregular hexagons. The head is three inches
ten lines long, and the ears one inch three
lines. The eye, instead of being sunk, as re∣marked
in your history, is indeed very small,
but the globe is prominent, and well defended
by eye-lids. The body is very fat, and the
skin of the belly is wrinkled, and full of small
tubercles, from which issue a number of pretty
long white hairs. The crust, on the broadest
part of the body, is six inches seven lines.
The fore legs are two inches two lines long,
and those behind three inches four lines. The
fore claws are very long, the longest being one
inch three lines, the next one inch two lines,
and the smallest ten lines. The length of the
hind claws is at most half an inch. The legs
<PB N="389" REF="456"/>
are covered, as far as the claws, with a yel∣lowish
scaly skin. When the animal walks,
he supports himself on the tips of the claws of
the fore feet. His penis, when drawn out in
a state of repose, is six inches seven lines long,
near four lines thick, and must augment consi∣derably
during its erection. When the penis
stretches, it lies upon the belly like a snail,
leaving a space of a line or two between each
circumvolution. I have been told, that, when
these animals copulate, the female lies on her
back to receive the male. The one I have
described was only eighteen months old.”</P>
<P>M. de la Borde remarks, that there are two
species of armadillos in Guiana. The largest is
black, and weighs from eighteen to twenty
pounds. The other, which is brown, or rather
iron-coloured, has three claws of different lengths.
Its tail is soft, and without any armour, being
covered with a simple skin. It is much smal∣ler
than the other, and weighs only about three
pounds.</P>
<P>“The large armadillo,' says M. de la Borde,
brings forth eight, and sometimes ten at a lit∣ter,
in their holes, which they dig very deep.
When attempts are made to unkennel this ani∣mal,
he labours hard to render the hole still
deeper, and descends almost perpendicularly.
He goes out in the night only, and feeds up∣on
worms, woodlice, and ants. His flesh is
<PB N="390" REF="457"/>
good, and, in flavour, somewhat resembles that
of a pig. The small iron-coloured armadillo
brings forth only four or five young; but she
digs still deeper, and is more difficult to catch.
When it rains, these animals go out during
the day; but, in fair weather, they remain in
their holes till night. They are always solitary;
and they are known to be in their holes by a
number of flies which follow their scent. When
the hunter digs in order to seize them, they
dig likewise; and, by throwing the earth be∣hind,
shut up the mouths of their holes so
completely, that no smoke can enter. The
females bring forth in the beginning of the
rainy season.”</P>
<P>The large black armadillo of M. de la Borde
may be referred to the twelve-banded species,
which is the largest of all the armadillos; and
the small iron-coloured kind may be referred to
the eight-banded armadillo, though M. de la
Borde says, that its tail is naked, a fact which
merits confirmation.</P>
<P>We have given a figure of an armadillo with
nine moveable bands and a very long tail.

The length of the body is about ten inches. It is made like a pig, and in some places is called the hog-rabbit; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad. p.</HI> 245.</P>

<P>THE Paca, or spotted Cavy, is an animal
peculiar to the New World. It digs holes
in the earth, like the rabbit, to which it has of∣ten
been compared, though there is very little
resemblance between them. It is even larger
than the hare. Its body is thicker and plumper;
the head is round and the muzzle short. It is
<PB N="393" REF="465"/>
very fat, and rather resembles a young pig<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoc genus animalia pilis et voce porcellum referunt, dentibus et figura capitis, et etiam <HI>magnitudine</HI> cuniculum; auribus murem; suntque singularia et sui generis; <HI>Raii synops. quad. p.</HI> 227. Mr Ray might have added, that this animal re∣sembles a pig still more in the figure of its body, in the taste and whiteness of the flesh, in fatness, and the thickness of its skin; and that it is larger than any rabbit.</NOTE> in
figure, grunting, gait, and manner of eating; for
it uses not, like the rabbit, its fore-feet in carry∣ing
food to its mouth; and, like the hog, it digs
the earth in quest of nourishment. It frequents
the banks of rivers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The pacas resemble pigs of two months old; and are very numerous about the banks of the river St Francis; <HI>De∣script. des Indes Occident. par de Laët, p.</HI> 484.</NOTE>, and is only found in the

reasons, this animal is in perpetual request. It is
difficult for the hunters to take him alive. When
surprised in his hole, which they lay open both

bites in a cruel manner. His skin, though co∣vered

<PB N="395" REF="467"/>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The description of the spotted cavy given in
the last article was taken from a young subject,
which had not acquired one half of its full growth.
I have since had one sent me, which, when it ar∣rived,
was larger than the former, and, from
the month of August 1774, to the 28th day of
May 1775, during which period it was nourish∣ed
in my house, its size continued to augment.
I now proceed to give an account of its mode of
living and acting, from the remarks of the Sieur
Trécourt.</P>
<P>When provided with a wooden cage or box,
this animal remains perfectly tranquil during the
day, especially when plentifully supplied with
food. He seems even to have an affection for
his retreat, as long as the day lasts; for, after
feeding, he retires spontaneously into it. But,
when night approaches, by perpetual restlessness
and agitation, and by tearing the bars of his pri∣son
with his teeth, he discovers a violent desire
of getting out. Nothing of this kind happens
during the day, unless he has occasion for some
natural evacuation; for he cannot endure the
smallest degree of dirtiness in his little apartment;
<PB N="396" REF="468"/>
and, when about to void his excrements, he al∣ways
retires to the most distant corner he can
find. When his straw begins to smell, he often
throws it out, as if he meant to demand fresh
litter. This old straw he pushes out with his
muzzle, and goes in quest of rags or paper to re∣place
it. But his attachment was not confined
to his cage. All obscure corners seemed to be
agreeable to him; and he often formed a new
nest for himself in presses which he found open,
or under the kitchen grate. Wherever he e∣stablished
a new abode, nothing but force could
make him leave it. In this animal, which was
a female, the propensity to cleanliness was so
strong, that, a large male rabbit being shut up
with her when she was in season, she took an
aversion to him the moment he voided his ex∣crement
in their common apartment. Before
this event, she had received him so cordially, that
something was expected; she even made con∣siderable
advances, for she licked his nose, ears,
and body; and she allowed him to take almost
the whole food which was given her. But, as
soon as the rabbit had infected the cage with his
ordure, she retired into the bottom of an old
press, where she made a bed of paper and rags,
and returned not to her old lodging till she saw
it neat, and freed from the unclean guest which
had been presented to her.</P>
<P>The spotted cavy is easily accustomed to a do∣mestic
life. Unless industriously irritated, he is
<PB N="397" REF="469"/>
gentle and tractable. He is fond of adulation,
and licks the hands of the person who caresses
him. He knows those who take care of him,
and readily distinguishes their voices. When
gently stroaked on the back, he stretches him∣self
out, lies down on his belly, by a small cry
expresses his acknowledgment, and seems to ask
a continuance of the favour. When seized in
a rough manner, however, he makes very violent
efforts to escape.</P>
<P>His muscles are very large and strong; and yet
his skin is so sensible, that the slightest touch is suf∣ficient
to excite in him the most lively emotions.
This great sensibility, though generally accom∣panied
with sweetness of temper, produces some∣times,
when too much irritated, or when a disa∣greeable
object is presented, the most violent
paroxysms of passion. The bare sight of an
unkown dog is sufficient to produce this effect
in the spotted cavy. When confined in his cage,
he has been observed, upon the entrance of a
strange dog into the chamber, to bite the door
and make an effort to open it. At first, it was
believed that he never wished to go out, unless
when pressed by natural necessities. But, when
at full liberty, we were surprised to see him dart
out suddenly upon an innocent dog, which he
bit very severely. In a few days, however, he
became familiar with this dog. People with
whom he is unacquainted, if they irritate him,
he treats in the same manner. But he never
<PB N="398" REF="470"/>
bites those who have the care of him. He has
an aversion to children, whom he always pur∣sues.
His passion is expressed by chattering his
teeth, and is always preceded by a kind of grunt∣ing.</P>
<P>This animal sits often on his posteriors, and
sometimes remains long in this situation. He
has the air of combing his head and whiskers
with his paws, which he continually licks and
moistens with his saliva. In this operation, he
often uses both paws at a time; he then scratch∣es
all the parts of his body which he can reach
with his fore-feet, and completes his dressing
by scratching with his hind paws such parts as
cannot be reached by the fore ones.</P>
<P>This animal, notwithstanding, is gross and
corpulent. His body is neither delicate, nor
smooth, nor nimble, but rather heavy and lurid,
having nearly the gait of a small hog. He runs
seldom, and, when he does, it is always with a
bad grace. He has no vivacious movement, but
that of leaping upon the furniture, or upon such
things as he wishes to seize and carry off. He
resembles the hog still farther in the whiteness
and thickness of his skin, which cannot be drawn
off, because it adheres to the flesh.</P>
<P>Though our animal had not acquired his full
growth, he was eighteen inches long in his na∣tural
contracted situation; but, when he extend∣ed
himself, he was near two feet from the point
<PB N="399" REF="471"/>
of the muzzle to the extremity of the body;
while the spotted cavy, described in the original
work, exceeded not seven inches five lines; which
difference, as there was no other between the
two animals, must be ascribed entirely to that of
their ages.</P>
<P>The height before, in the individual we are
now describing, is seven inches, and behind about
nine inches and a half; so that, in walking, the
hind part of the body appeared always higher
than the head. The posterior part of the body
is also the thickest, being nineteen inches and a
half in circumference, while that of the anterior
part is only fourteen inches.</P>
<P>The body is covered with short, coarse, thinly
scattered hairs, of a dusky colour, and deeper on
the back. But the belly, the breast, the throat,
and the interior parts of the legs, are of a dirty
white: This animal is rendered exceedingly re∣markable,
by five longitudinal rows of white
spots, which run along the body, and approach
each other at their extremities.</P>
<P>The head, from the nose to the top of the
front, is near five inches long, and very convex.
The eyes are large, prominent, of a brownish
colour, and about two inches distant from one
another. The ears are roundish, about eight
lines in length, and nearly of an equal breadth
at the base; they are plaited, and covered with
a down so fine as to be almost imperceptible ei∣ther
<PB N="400" REF="472"/>
to the touch or the sight. The end of the
nose is broad, nearly of a black colour, and di∣vided
like that of the hare. The nostrils are
very large. The animal has considerable strength
and address in the management of this organ;
for I have often seen him raise the portcullis of
his cage with it. The under jaw is an inch
shorter, and much narrower than the upper. On
each side, and toward the base of the upper jaw,
there is a kind of longitudinal fold, garnished
with hair in the middle, which, at first sight, e∣specially
when viewed sidewise, may be mista∣ken
for the mouth; for the mouth appears not,
unless when it is open; its aperture exceeds not
six or seven lines; and it is not above two
or three lines distant from the fold mentioned
above.</P>
<P>Each jaw is armed with two very long incisive
teeth, which are as yellow as saffron, and of
strength sufficient to cut wood. I have seen this
animal, in the course of a single night, cut a hole
in one of the planks of his lodging large enough
to let out his head. His tongue is narrow, thick,
and somewhat rough. His whiskers consist of
black and white hairs, placed on each side of the
nose; and there are similar hairs, but blacker and
fewer in number, on each side of the head under
the ears. The resistance of the animal prevent∣ed
us from counting the number of its grinders.</P>
<P>Each foot, both before and behind, has five
toes, four of which are armed with claws about
<PB N="400" REF="473"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="401" REF="474"/>
half an inch long, and of a flesh colour. But
this colour should not be regarded as a constant
character; for, in several animals, and particular∣ly
the hare, we often find the claws black, while,
in other individuals, they are whitish or flesh∣coloured.
The fifth, or interior claw, is very
short, and only visible when the animal raises
his foot. Between the hind feet, at a little di∣stance
from the organs of generation, there are
two paps of a brownish colour. In fine, though
the tail is hardly visible, by searching, we find a
small button of two or three lines long.</P>
<P>The domestic paca, or spotted cavy, eats every
thing presented to him, and has a strong appe∣tite.
He is commonly fed with bread, which
he eats equally well, whether it be soaked in
water, in wine, or even in vinegar. But, he is
so fond of sugar and fruits, that, when offered
to him, he expresses his joy by bounding and
leaping. He is also fond of roots and pot-herbs
of all kinds; for he eats, with equal relish,
grapes, cellery, onions, and garlick; and
he refuses not coleworts, grass, moss, or the
bark of trees. We have even seen him eat
wood, though half charred. Flesh he seemed
to like worse than any other food, and he eat it
but rarely, and in very small quantities. He
might be easily fed with grain; for he often
searched for it among his litter. When he
drinks, he laps like the dog. His urine is
<PB N="402" REF="475"/>
thick, and has an insupportable odour. His ex∣crements
consist of small crottels, which are
longer than those of the rabbit or hare.</P>
<P>From these minute observations, we are led to
believe that this species might be naturalized in
France, which, as the animal is easily tamed, and
his flesh is excellent, would be a useful acquisition.
He seems not to be much afraid of cold; and,
besides, as he can dig holes in the earth, he could
easily defend himself against the rigour of win∣ter.
A single individual of this species would
furnish as much good meat as seven or eight
rabbits.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde informs us, that the spotted
cavy generally lives on the banks of rivers; and
that he forms his hole in such a manner as to
have three different ways of entering, or going
out. “When pursued,” he remarks, “he takes
to the water, and dives frequently; but, when
attacked by the dogs, he makes a vigorous
defence.” M. de la Borde adds, “that the
flesh of this animal is much esteemed at Cay∣enne,
and that, however prepared, it is ex∣cellent.”</P>
<P>“The spotted cavy lives alone in his hole, and
leaves it not till night, when he goes in quest
of food. He comes not abroad during the
day, unless when he is obliged by the neces∣sities
of nature; for no dung is ever found in
his kennel; and, when he returns, he always
<PB REF="476"/>
<FIGURE>
<P>Plate CLVII.</P>
<P>PACA.</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="403" REF="477"/>
shuts up the entrances with leaves and twigs.
The female generally produces but one at a
time, which quits not the mother till it be full
grown, or, if it be a male, till it copulates.
At Cayenne there are two or three species,
which are said not to intermix. Some of them
weigh from fourteen to twenty pounds, and
others from twenty-five to thirty.”</P>

<HEAD>The VIRGINIAN OPOSSUM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>All the species of the opossum have two canine teeth in each jaw. The cutting teeth in each jaw are unequal. They have five toes on each foot; and the hind feet are formed like a hand, with a distinct thumb.—The Virginian opossum has a long sharp pointed nose, large, round, naked, and very thin ears, small, black, lively eyes, and long stiff hairs on each side of the nose, and behind the eyes. The face is covered with short soft hairs, of a dusky colour. Above each eye, there is a large white spot. The cheeks are whitish, and the sides of the neck of a dirty yellow. The hind part of the neck, and the back, are covered with soft, but uneven hairs, above two inches long, the bottoms of which are of a yellowish white, the middle part black, and the ends whitish. The sides are covered with dirty and dusky hairs, and the belly with soft, woolly, dirty white hair. The legs and thighs are black, the feet dusky, and the claws white. The base of the tail, for near three inches, is clothed with long hairs like those on the back, and the remainder with small scales; the half next the body is black, and the rest white. The tail has a disagreeable appearance, resembling the body of a snake, and has the same prehensile power as that of some monkeys. The body is round, and pretty thick, and the legs are short. The female, on the lower part of the belly, has a large pouch, in which the teats are lodged, and where the young shelter as soon as they are born.

<P>THE Opossum is an American animal, and
easily distinguishable from all others, by
two very singular characters. 1. Under the belly
of the female there is a large cavity in which she re∣ceives
<PB N="405" REF="479"/>
and suckles her young. 2. In both male
and female, the first toe of the hind feet has
no claws, and is separated from the rest, like the
thumb in the human hand; while the other
toes of the same feet are placed near each other,
<PB N="406" REF="480"/>
and armed with crooked claws. The first cha∣racter
has been remakred by most travellers and
naturalists; but the second has entirely escaped
them. It was first observed by Edward Tyson,
an English physician. He is the only author
who has given a good description of the fe∣male<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The anatomy of an oppossum, London, 1698.</NOTE>;
<PB N="407" REF="481"/>
and, a few years after, Mr Cowper,
a celebrated English anatomist, communicated
to Tyson the observations he had made upon
the male. Other authors, and particularly the
nomenclators, who perpetually multiply species
without necessity, have committed a number of
blunders with regard to this animal, which we
must endeavour to correct.</P>
<P>Our opossum is the same animal with the great
Oriental philander of Seba<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Seba, tom. 1. p. 64, tab. 39.</NOTE>; for, of all the ani∣mals
of which Seba has given figures, and to
which he applies the names of <HI>Philander, Opos∣sum,
of Carigueya,</HI> this alone has the two charac∣ters
of a pouch under the belly, and thumbs
without claws on the hind feet. Neither is the
opossum an Eastern animal, but a native of the
warm climates of the New World; for the two
we have in the royal cabinet were brought from
America. That of Tyson was sent to him from
Virginia. M. de Chanvallon, a correspondent
of the Academy of Sciences at Martinico, who
gave us a young opossum, recognised the other
two to be real American opossums. It is agreed
by all voyagers, that this animal is found in Bra∣sil,
New Spain, Virginia, the Antilles, &amp;c. and
<PB N="408" REF="482"/>
none of them ever mention their having seen it
in the East Indies. Hence Seba deceives him∣self,
when he calls them the <HI>Oriental Philanders.</HI>
He says, that his philander was sent him from
Amboina, along with other curiosities, under the
name of <HI>Coes-coes;</HI> but he allows, at the same
time, that it had been brought to Amboina from
some other remote country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philander maximus orientalis foemina. Inter alia rario∣ra et hocce animal nobis ex Amboina missum est, sub nomine <HI>Coes-coes.</HI> eo quidem delatum EX ORIS REMOTIORIBUS; <HI>Seba, vol. 1. p.</HI> 64.</NOTE>. This confession
is alone sufficient to throw a suspicion on the
denomination of <HI>Oriental Philander;</HI> for it is
very probable that travellers may have transport∣ed
this animal from America to the East Indies;
but we have no proof of its being a native of
Amboina; and the very passage quoted from
Seba seems to indicate the contrary. The source
of this error, in fact, as well as that of the name
<HI>Coes-coes,</HI> is to be ascribed to Piso, who says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Indiis Orientalibus, IDQUE SOLUM, QUANTUM HAC∣TENUS CONSTAT, IN AMBOINA similis bestia frequens, ad felis magnitudinem accedens; mactata ab incolis comeditur, si rite praeparetur, nam alias foetet. Nomen illi <HI>Cous-cous</HI> inditum; <HI>Pison. hist. nat. Brasil. p.</HI> 323.</NOTE>,
that, in Amboina, there is an animal, similar to
the Brasilian opossum, which is called <HI>Cous-cous.</HI>
Piso mentions no authority for this assertion. It
would be very singular, if it were true, that this
animal is found in Amboina, and in no other
part of the East Indies. Seba, on the contrary,
<PB N="409" REF="483"/>
remarks, that the one sent to him from Amboina
was not a native of that place, but had been
transported from a more distant country. But,
though he was ignorant of the region from which
his philander was brought, he has presumed to
give it the epithet of <HI>Oriental.</HI> It is unquestio∣nably,
however, the same animal, as will appear
from comparing his figure, Tab. 39. with Nature.
But what augments this error, at the same time
that the author gives to the American opossum
the name of <HI>the great Oriental philander,</HI> he ex∣hibits
to us another animal, which he believes
to be different from the former, and calls it the
<HI>American philander</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seba, tab. 36, fig, 1. and 2.</NOTE>; and yet, from his own
description, it differs from the great Oriental phi∣lander
only in being smaller, and in having the
spots above the eyes of a browner colour. These
differences are too slight and too accidental to
constitute two distinct species; for he takes no
notice of another difference, which, if it had any
existence, would be much more essential, namely,
that this American philander of Seba<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE> has a
sharp claw upon the thumbs of the hind feet,
while his great Oriental philander has no claws
on these thumbs<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. tab. 39.</NOTE>. Now, it is certain, that our
opossum, which is the true American one, has
no claws on the hind thumbs. If any animal,
therefore, with sharp claws on these thumbs, ex∣isted,
like that represented by Seba in his 36th
<PB N="410" REF="484"/>
table, it could not, as he maintains, be the Ame∣rican
opossum. But this is not all: Seba gives
a third animal under the name of the <HI>Oriental
philander</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seba, tab. 38. fig. 1.</NOTE>; of which, however, he makes no
mention in his descriptions of the other two, but
follows François Valentin, an author, as for∣merly
remarked, who merits no confidence. This
third animal is still the same with the two first.
Hence it appears, that the three figures in Seba's
36th, 38th, and 39th tables, are one and the
same animal; and it is probable, that the drawer,
from inattention, has given sharp claws to the
hind as well as to the fore thumbs, as in tables
36th and 38th, and that, being more exact in
table 39th, he has represented the thumbs of the
hind feet, as they really are, without claws. We
are, therefore, persuaded that these three animals
of Seba are only individuals of the same species,
which is the same with that of our opossum, and
that the slight differences in size and colour,
mentioned above, proceed from age or from ac∣cident.
The author himself allows, that the two
animals in his 36th and 38th tables, differ only
in size and some shades of colour<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Est autem femella haecce Americanis Philandris FOEMI∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>IS QUAM SIMILLIMA; nisi quod pilis dorsalibus aliquantum <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>turatius fufeis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estita, et toto habitu procerior sit illis; <HI>Seba,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>; and that the
third, table 39th, differs from the two former in
being larger only, and having the spots above
<PB N="411" REF="485"/>
the eyes, instead of yellowish, of a brown colour.
Seba remarks, “That, according to Francis Va∣lentin,
the philander, table 38th, is the largest
kind found in the East Indies, and especially
among the Mallayes, where it is called <HI>Pelan∣dor
Aroé,</HI> that is, <HI>the rabbit of Aroé,</HI> though
Aroé is not the only place where these animals
are to be met with; that they are common in
the island of Solor; that they are reared along
with the rabbits, to whom they do no harm;
that their flesh, which is excellent, is eaten by
the inhabitants,” &amp;c. These facts are extreme∣ly
questionable, not to say false. 1. The phi∣lander,
tab. 38th, is not the largest East India kind;
for, according to our author, that represented in
tab. 39th, which he likewise attributes to the East
Indies, is larger. 2. This philander has no re∣semblance
to the rabbit; and, consequently, is
improperly called <HI>the rabbit of Aroé.</HI> 3. No
Voyager to the East Indies makes mention of
this remarkable animal; neither is it found in
any other part of the Old Continent. Seba him∣self
seems to perceive not only the incapacity,
but the unfaithfulness of the author he quotes:
“Cujus equidem rei,” says he, “fides sit penes au∣torem.
At mirum tamen est, quod D. Valen∣tinus
philandri formam haud ita descripserit
prout se habet, et uti nos icones ad vivum fac∣tas
praegressis tabulis exhibuimus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Seba, tom. 1. p. 61.</NOTE>.” But, to
give a complete demonstration of the little credit
<PB N="412" REF="486"/>
due to the testimony of Francis Valentin, who
has written a history of the East Indies in five
folio volumes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ond en nienw Oost-Indien, &amp;c. 1724.</NOTE>, it is sufficient to refer to what
is said of him by Artedi<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Multa scripsit Franciscus Valentinus, quae Judaeus Appella credat. … Ita comparatus est hic liber Belgicus, ut histori∣corum naturalium genuinorum et eruditorum oculos nullo modo ferre possit; <HI>Artedi Ichthyologiae hist. literar. p.</HI> 55. et 56.</NOTE>, and to the reproaches
thrown upon his veracity by Seba himself<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Inde autem quam liquidissime detegitur error a D. Fran∣cisco Valentino commissus, circa historiam horum animalium; <HI>tom 3. p.</HI> 273. … Error absonus valde et enormis, inde for∣san ortum duxit, quod vir iste hanc animalium speciem haud debite examinaverit, &amp;c.; <HI>Seha, vol. 1. p.</HI> 64.</NOTE>. Va∣lentin
asserts, “that the pouch of the philander
is a uterus in which the young are conceived;
that, after dissecting a female himself, he could
find no other; that, if this pouch is not a real
uterus, the teats are to the young what the pe∣dicles
are to fruits; that they adhere to these
teats till they are full grown, and then separate
as the fruit from the pedicle, after it arrives at
maturity,” &amp;c. The truth is, that Valentin,
who assures us that these animals are extremely
common in the East Indies, and particularly in
the island of Solor, had never seen one of them
in that country; that all he has said, including
his most conspicuous errors, he has copied from
Piso and Marcgrave, who both copied from
Ximenes, and are wrong in every article they
have added of their own; for Marcgrave and
Piso, as well as Valentin, assert, in the most po∣sitive
<PB N="413" REF="487"/>
tone, that the pouch is the true uterus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haec bursa ipse uterus est animalis, nam alium non habet, uti ex sectione illius comperi: In hac semen concipitur et ca∣tuli formantur; <HI>Marcgrav. Hist. Brasiliens. p.</HI> 223.</NOTE>,
where the young opossums are conceived. Marc∣grave
says, that he dissected a female, and found
no other uterus. Piso goes farther, and tells us,
that he dissected several females<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">EX REITERATIS horum animalium sectionibus, alium non invenimus uterum praeter hanc bursam, in qua semen con∣cipitur et catuli formantur; <HI>Pison. Hist. nat. Brasil. p.</HI> 323.</NOTE>, and never
could discover any internal uterus; and to this
assertion he adds another equally false, that this
animal is found in Amboina. Let men now
judge what credit is due to Marcgrave, Piso, and
Valentin, the first of whom has examined with
no attention, the second has augmented the er∣rors
of the first, and the third has copied from
both.</P>
<P>I ask pardon of my readers for this long cri∣tical
discussion. But, when errors are to be cor∣rected,
we can never be too exact, or too atten∣tive
even to minute things.</P>
<P>M. Brisson, in his account of quadrupeds, has
implicitly adopted what he found in the works
of Seba, and follows him both in his denomina∣tions
and descriptions. He even proceeds a step
farther than his author, when he makes three
distinct species of the philanders, represented in
tab. 36. 38. and 39. of Seba; for, if M. Brisson
had examined the idea given by Seba, he would
<PB N="414" REF="488"/>
have found, that the latter does not exhibit his
philanders as three distinct species. Seba never
doubted, that an animal found in the warm cli∣mates
of America, would not also be found in the
warm regions of Asia. He denominated his a∣nimals
Oriental or American, according as they
came to him from the one or the other Continent.
It is obvious, from the following passage, that
he does not take the word <HI>species</HI> in a strict sense:
“This is the largest <HI>species</HI> of these animals;” p.
61. He adds, “This female is perfectly similar
to the female philanders of America; it is only
longer, and covered on the back with hair of a
deeper yellow.” These differences, as formerly
remarked, are only accidental varieties, which
are common among individuals of the same spe∣cies
at different ages; and, in fact, Seba never
pretended to make a methodical distribution of
animals into classes, genera, and species. He
gives only figures of the different specimens in
his cabinet, which he distinguishes by numbers,
according to any varieties he perceived in their
size, the tints of their colours, or the countries
from which he obtained them. It is apparent,
therefore, that M. Brisson had no authority for
making three species of philanders, especially as
he gives no distinctive characters, and makes no
mention of the want of claws on the thumbs of
the hind feet. He says, in general, that the phi∣landers
have <HI>claws,</HI> without making any ex∣ception.
The philander, however, which he
<PB N="415" REF="489"/>
saw in the royal cabinet, had no claws on the
thumbs of the hind feet; and it appears to have
been the only one he ever saw; since, in his
book, there is no more than No. 1. marked with
two asterisms. The chief error in Brisson's work
is in the list of species, which is more numerous
than that of Nature.</P>
<P>M. Linnaeus is the only other nomenclator
we have to examine. In this article, he is less
exceptionable than in many others; for he has
suppressed one of the three species of Seba<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Count de Buffon's strictures on the Systema Natu∣rae of Linnaeus are adapted to the tenth edition; Buffon's criticisms, of course, have no application to the present state of Linnaeus's system. The translator, therefore, thinks it unnecessary to insert them; and, he apprehends, the reader will not think himself injured by the omission.</NOTE>.
But he ought to have reduced them to one.</P>
<P>From the preceding examination, which has
been made with the most scrupulous impartiali∣ty,
it appears, that the <HI>philander, opossum,</HI> seu
<HI>carigueya Brasiliensis,</HI> of Seba, tab. 36. fig. 1. 2.
and 3. the <HI>philander Orientalis maximus,</HI> tab. 39.
fig. 1. the Oriental philander, No. 2. and the
philander of Amboina, No. 3. of M. Brisson;
and, lastly, the <HI>marsupialis,</HI> No. 1. and the
<HI>opossum,</HI> No. 3. of Linnaeus, are the same ani∣mal,
and that this animal is our opossum, which
is peculiar to South America, and was never
seen in the East Indies, unless when transported
thither. I thought I had cleared up every am∣biguity;
but still some difficulties remain with
<PB N="416" REF="490"/>
regard to the <HI>taiibi,</HI> which Marcgrave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave, Histor. Natur. Brasiliens. pag. 223.</NOTE> has not
represented as an animal different from the <HI>ca∣rigueya;</HI>
but, nevertheless, Johnston<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Johnston, de Quadruped. pag. 95.</NOTE>, Seba<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Seba, vol. 1. pag. 57. tab. 36. fig. 4.</NOTE>,
Klein<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Klein, de Quadruped. pag. 59.</NOTE>, Linnaeus<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus Syst. Nat. edit. 10. pag. 54. No. 2.</NOTE>, and Brisson<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Brisson, Regn. Anim. pag. 290.</NOTE>, gives it as a
species distinct from the preceding. In Marcgrave,
however, we find the two names <HI>carigueya</HI> and
<HI>taiibi</HI> at the head of the same article, where it is
said, that this animal is called <HI>carigueya</HI> in Bra∣sil,
and <HI>taiibi</HI> in Paraguay. “Carigueya Brasi∣liensibus,
aliquibus jupatiima, Petiguaribus
taiibi.” He then gives Ximenes's description
of the carigueya. After which, we find another
animal, called <HI>taiibi</HI> by the Brasilians, <HI>cachorro
domato</HI> by the Portuguese, and <HI>booschratte,</HI> or
<HI>wood-rat,</HI> by the Dutch. Margrave says not
that this animal is different from the carigueya;
he represents it, on the contrary, as the male ca∣rigueya:
“Pedes et digitos habet ut foemella
jam descripta.” It is obvious, therefore, that,
in Paraguay, both the male and female opossum
are called <HI>taiibi,</HI> and that, in Brasil, the name
<HI>taiibi</HI> is given to the male, and that of <HI>carigueya</HI>
to the female. Besides, the differences between
these two animals, as they appear even from the
descriptions given of them, are too slight to con∣stitute
distinct species. The most remarkable
<PB N="417" REF="491"/>
difference is in the colour of the hair, which, in
the carigueya, is yellow and brown, but gray
is the taiibi, whose hairs are white<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hair of the wood-rat is of a fine silver gray colour. Some of them are seen totally white. The female has, under her belly, a purse which she can open and shut at pleasure; <HI>Charlevoix's Descript▪ de la Nouv. France, tom. 3. p.</HI> 334.</NOTE> below, and
brown or black at their extremities. It is more
than probable, therefore, that the taiibi is the
male opossum. Mr Ray<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Raii Synops. Quad p. 185.</NOTE> seems to be of this
opinion, when, speaking of the carigueya and
taiibi, he says, “An specie, an sexu tantum a
praecedente diversum?” Seba, however, not∣withstanding
the authority of Marcgrave, and
the rational doubts of Ray, gives, in tab. 36.
fig. 4. the figure of an animal, which, without
any hesitation, he calls <HI>taiibi,</HI> and, at the same
time, says, that it is the same with the <HI>tlaquat∣zin</HI>
of Hernandez. This is to accumulate error
upon error; for, from the acknowledgment of
Seba himself, his taiibi, which is a female, has
no pouch under the belly<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Marsupio tamen pro recondendis catulis caret haec spe∣cies; <HI>Seba, tom. 1. p.</HI> 58.</NOTE>, and Hernandez
makes this pouch the chief character of his tla∣quatzin.
The taiibi of Seba, therefore, cannot
be the tlaquatzin of Hernandez, because it wants
the pouch, nor the taiibi of Marcgrave, because
it is a female. It is certainly another animal, ill
drawn, and worse described, to which Seba has
<PB N="418" REF="492"/>
thought proper to give the name of <HI>taiibi,</HI> and
absurdly refers it to the tlaquatzin of Hernandez,
which, as formerly remarked, is the same with
our opossum. Brisson and Linnaeus, with re∣gard
to the taiibi, have blindly followed Seba.
They have both copied Hernandez's blunder as
to the tlaquatzin, and made an equivocal species
of this animal, the one under the name of the
<HI>Brasilian philander</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philander pilis in exortu albis, in extremitate nigricanti∣bus vestita … … Philander Brasiliensis; <HI>Regn. Anim. p.</HI> 290.</NOTE>, and the other under that
of <HI>philander</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Didelphis philander, cauda basi pilosa, auriculis pendu∣lis, mammis quaternis; <HI>Syst. Nat. p.</HI> 72.</NOTE>. The true taiibi of Marcgrave
and Ray, therefore, is neither the taiibi of Seba,
nor the philander of Linnaeus, nor the Brasilian
philander of Brisson; and the two latter are not
the tlaquatzin of Hernandez. The taiibi of Se∣ba,
if it had any existence, would be an animal
different from all those mentioned by the above
authors, and would require a new denomination.
In fine, as the male opossum has no pouch, it is
not surprising, that the male and female have
been considered as different animals, and that
the female has got the name of the <HI>carigueya,</HI>
and the male that of the <HI>taiibi.</HI></P>
<P>Edward Tyson dissected and described the fe∣male
opossum with great accuracy. In his in∣dividual,
the head was six inches long, the body
thirteen, and the tail twelve. The fore legs are
six inches in length, and the hind legs four inches
<PB N="419" REF="493"/>
and a half. The circumference of the body is
from fifteen to sixteen inches; that of the tail,
at its origin, is three inches, and only one to∣ward
the extremity. The head across the eyes
is three inches broad, gradually diminishes to
the nose, and resembles the head of a pig more
than that of a fox. The orbits of the eyes are
much inclined in the direction from the ears to
the nose. The ears are rounded, and about an
inch and a half long. The aperture of the
mouth is two inches and a half, measuring from
one of the angles of the lips to the end of the
muzzle. The tongue is pretty narrow, three
inches long, rough, and full of small papillae,
directed backward. There are five toes on the
fore feet, all armed with crooked claws, and an
equal number on the hind feet, four of which
only have claws, and the fifth, which is the
thumb, is separated from the rest, placed in a
lower situation, and has no claw. There is no
hair on the claws, which are covered with a
reddish skin, and nearly an inch in length. The
palm of the hands and feet is large, and there
are fleshy callosities under all the toes. The tail
is covered, for two or three inches from its ori∣gin,
with hair, and afterwards, to the end, with
a smooth scaly skin. The scales are whitish,
nearly hexagonal, and regularly placed, so as
not to encroach on each other, being all sepa∣rated
by a small circle of skin, which is of a
browner colour than the scales. The ears are
<PB N="420" REF="494"/>
naked, thin, and membranous, like the wings of
a bat; they are also very open, and the auditory
canal is large. The upper jaw is a little longer
than the under. The nostrils are large, the eyes
small, black, prominent and lively. The neck
is short, the chest broad, and the whiskers like
those of the cat. The hair on the fore part of
the head is whiter and shorter than that on the
body: The back and sides are ash-coloured,
mixed with some small tufts of black and whitish
hairs; the belly is browner, and the legs more
dusky. Under the belly of the female, there is an
aperture about two or three inches long, formed
by two folds of skin, which compose a pouch
thinly covered with hair internally. This pouch
contains the teats; the young, as soon as brought
forth, go into it in order to suck the mother, and
acquire so strong a habit of concealing them∣selves,
that, after arriving at a considerable size,
they continue to take refuge in the pouch, when∣ever
they are alarmed. This pouch the animal
can open or shut at pleasure, which it per∣forms
by means of several muscles, and two
bones that are peculiar to the opossum. These
two bones are placed before the os pubis, to
which they are attached by their base. They
are about two inches long, and gradually dimi∣nish
in thickness from the base to the extremity,
and serve as a fulcrum to the muscles which
open the pouch. The antagonists of these mus∣cles
shut the pouch so close, that, in the living
<PB N="421" REF="495"/>
animal, it cannot be seen, unless when forcibly
dilated by the fingers. In the inside of the
pouch there is a number of glands, which se∣crete
a yellowish substance of so disagreeable a
smell, that it infects the whole body of the ani∣mal.
This matter, however, when dried, not
only loses its disagreeable odour, but acquires a
perfume which may be compared to that of
musk. The pouch is not, as has been falsely
asserted by Marcgrave and Piso, the place where
the young are conceived. The female opossum
has an internal uterus, which differs, indeed,
from that of other animals, but where the young
are conceived and retained till the moment of
their birth. Tyson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We will therefore here take a survey and an account of these parts; and we find that there are <HI>two</HI> ovaria, <HI>two</HI> tubae Fallopianae, <HI>two</HI> cornua uteri, <HI>two</HI> uteri, and <HI>two</HI> vaginae uteri; <HI>Tyson, anatomy of an opossum, p.</HI> 36.</NOTE> tells us, that in this ani∣mal
there are two uteri, two vaginae, four cor∣nua
uteri, four Fallopian tubes, and four ovaria.
From the dissections of M. Daubenton, though
he agrees not with Tyson in every article, it is
certain, that, in the generative parts of the opos∣sum,
there are several parts double, which are
single in other animals. The glans penis of
the male, and the glans clitoridis of the female,
are forked, and have the appearance of being
double. The vagina, which is single at its en∣trance,
afterwards divides into two canals, &amp;c.
This structure is extremely singular, and differs
from that of all other quadrupeds.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="496"/>
The opossum is an original native of the
warm countries of the New World. He ap∣pears
not, however, to be so strictly attached to
warm climates as the armadillo; for he is found
not only in the Brasil, Guiana, and Mexico, but
likewise in Florida, Virginia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The opossum is common in Virginia and New Spain; <HI>Hist. Nat. des Antilles, p.</HI> 122.</NOTE>, and other tem∣perate
regions of America. He is a very com∣mon
animal; because the female produces of∣ten,
and, according to most authors, four or five<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quaternos quinosve parit catulos, quos utero conceptos, editosque in lucem, alvi cavitate quadam, dum adhuc parvuli sunt, condit et servat, &amp;c.; <HI>Hernand. Hist. Mex. p.</HI> 330.</NOTE>,
some say six or seven, at a time. Marcgrave as∣sures
us, that he has seen six living young in
the pouch of the female<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Haec ipsa quam describo bestia sex catulos vivos et om∣nibus membris absolutos, sed sine pilis, in hac bursa habebat, qui etiam hinc inde in ea movebantur; quilibet catulus duos digitos erat longus, &amp;c.; <HI>Marcgrave, Hist. Bras. p.</HI> 222. They have a pouch under the belly where they carry their young, six or seven of which are brought forth at a litter; <HI>Descript. de Nouv. Monde, per de Laët, p</HI> 485.</NOTE>. These young ones
were about two inches long, very agile, and
came out and went into the pouch several times
a day. When new born, they are very small.
According to some travellers, when they escape
from the uterus, and go into the pouch, and at∣tach
themselves to the teats, they exceed not the
size of flies<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The female opossum has a double belly, or rather a pendu∣lous membrane that covers the whole belly, without being fixed to it, the inside of which may be seen after the animal has once brought forth. At the hinder part of this membrane, there is an aperture, into which the hand may be introduced. It is here where the young retire, either to avoid danger, or for the purposes of sucking and sleeping. In this manner they live till they are able to procure food for themselves. … I have seen young ones attached to the teats, when they exceeded not the size of a fly. They never quit the teats till they are as large as mice; <HI>Hist. de la Virginie, p.</HI> 220.</NOTE>. This fact is not so much exag∣gerated
<PB N="423" REF="497"/>
as might naturally be imagined; for
we have seen, in an animal whose species has a
great affinity to that of the opossum, young at∣tached
to the teats, which were not bigger than
large beans; and it is probable, that, in this
animal, the uterus is only a place destined for
the conception and first formation of the foetus,
the exclusion of which being earlier than in o∣ther
quadrupeds, its growth is finished in the
pouch, where it enters the moment after its pre∣mature
birth. No person has ascertained the
time of gestation in the female opossum, which
is probably much shorter than in any other qua∣druped:
And, as this premature exclusion of
the foetus is a singularity in Nature, we must
earnestly recommend it to those who have an
opportunity of observing the opossum in its na∣tive
country, to endeavour to discover the time
the females go with young, and, after birth, how
long the young ones remain attached to the

in itself, and may be productive of utility: From
it we may perhaps learn some method of pre∣serving

the lives of infants who come into the
world before the natural period.</P>
<P>That the young opossums, therefore, continue
attached, and pasted, as it were, to the teats of
the mother, till they acquire strength and growth
sufficient to enable them to move about with
ease, is a fact no longer to be doubted. Neither
is it peculiar to this species, as will appear from
the history of the <HI>marmose,</HI> or murine opossum,
which is given in the next article. The female
of this last species has no pouch under its belly,
like the female of the former. It is not, there∣fore,
to the conveniency of a secure retreat af∣forded
by the pouch, that the effects of adhering
long to the teats, and acquiring growth in this
immoveable situation, are to be ascribed. I
make this remark to prevent the pouch from
being regarded as a second uterus, or at least as
a shelter indispensably necessary to young which
are prematurely brought forth. Some authors
mention, that the young remain fixed to the
teats for several weeks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The young are attached to the teats, and remain several weeks in this situation, till they acquire strength, the use of their sight, and a proper covering of hair. They then fall into the membrane, from which they go out, and return at pleasure; <HI>Hist. de la Virginie, p.</HI> 220.</NOTE>. Others say, that they
continue in the pouch during the first month of
their age only<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Septem plus minusve ut plurimum uno partu excludit foetus, quos donec menstruam aetatem attingant, pro lubitu nunc alvo recondit, nunc iterum prodit; <HI>Ralp. Hamor. apud Nieremberg, p,</HI> 157.</NOTE>. It is an easy operation to
<PB N="425" REF="499"/>
open the pouch of the mother, and to examine
and count the young without incommoding
them. They never quit the teats, which they
hold with their mouths till they have strength
enough to walk. They then fall into the pouch;
and afterwards go out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After bringing forth, the mother puts her offspring into the pouch. They instantly fix upon the teats, and continue to feed upon the milk in this secure and warm retreat. … As soon as they are able to move about upon the grass, the mother opens her pouch, and allows them to escape, &amp;c.; <HI>Mem. de la Louisiane, par Dumont, p.</HI> 84.</NOTE> in quest of food<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The mother brings forth her young blind and naked, and with her fore paws puts them into the pouch, which is a kind of uterus, where they find an agreeable warmth, &amp;c. … She takes them not out of this pouch till they have the use of their eyes. She then carries them to some rising ground where no danger is to be apprehended; and, having opened her pouch, she makes them come out, exposes them to the rays of the sun, and amuses them by sporting and playing. Upon the smallest noise, or suspicion of dan∣ger, she soon recalls them by a cry <HI>tic, tic, tic,</HI> and they run into the pouch for shelter, &amp;c.; <HI>Seba, vol. 1. p.</HI> 56.—When the mother hears any suspicious noise, she gives a signal by a certain cry, which the young understand, run instantly to their protector, and return into the pouch; <HI>Mem. de la Loui∣siane, p.</HI> 83.</NOTE>.
They often return to the pouch to sleep, to suck,
and to conceal themselves when danger is ap∣prehended;
then the mother flies, carrying her
whole offspring along with her. Her belly
seems not to be enlarged till long after she has
brought forth, and till the young have acquired
some bulk; for, during the time of gestation,
her size is not perceptibly augmented.</P>

easy to perceive, that these animals must walk
ill, and run slowly. A man, accordingly, it is
said, may easily seize them without accelerating
his pace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This animal is so slow, that he is very easily taken; <HI>Mem. de la Louisiane, par Dumont, p.</HI> 83.—I never saw any animal move so slowly; for I have often taken one at my or∣dinary pace; <HI>Du Pratz, Hist. de Louisiane, tom. 2. p.</HI> 93.</NOTE>.

<P>M. de la Borde, King's physician at Cayenne,
informs me, that he fed three opossums in a
small cask, where they suffered themselves to be
managed with ease. They eat fish, flesh raw or
roasted, bread, bisket, &amp;c. They licked each
other perpetually, and made the same purring
noise as cats do when caressed.</P>
<P>“I did not perceive,” says he, “that they had
any bad smell. Some species are large and
others small<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was lately sent to the Royal Cabinet, from Cayenne, a skin of one of these small opossums, which, though the animal was an adult, exceeded not three inches and a half in length, and the tail was four inches and a half long.</NOTE>. They all carry their young
in a pouch under their bellies; and the young
never quit the teats, even when sleeping. The
dogs kill, but do not eat these animals. They
make a kind of grunting noise, which extends
to no great distance. They are easily tamed.
They go into the hen-houses, and devour the
fouls. Their flesh is not good to eat: In cer∣tain
<PB N="430" REF="506"/>
species, its odour is so unsupportable, that
the animal receives the epithet of <HI>stinking</HI> from
the inhabitants of Cayenne.”</P>
<P>These stinking opossums must not be con∣founded
with the true <HI>mouffettes,</HI> or stinking
weasels, which constitute a very different genus
of animals.</P>
<P>M. de Vosmaër, director of the Prince of
Orange's cabinet of Natural History, has added
a note to p. 6. of his description of a flying
squirrel, published at Amsterdam in the year
1767, in which he says,</P>
<P>“The <HI>coescoes</HI> is the <HI>bosch</HI> or <HI>beusrult</HI> of the
East Indies, the <HI>philander</HI> of Seba, and the
<HI>didelphis</HI> of Linnaeus. The learned M. de
Buffon (see above, p. 407.) denies absolutely its
existence in the East Indies, and limits it entirely
to the New World. We can, however, assure
this learned naturalist, that Valentin and Seba
were right in making these animals common
to Asia and America. Last summer, I myself
received a male and a female from the East In∣dies.
The same species has likewise been
transmitted from Amboina to Doctor Schlosser
of Amsterdam. The chief difference between
the <HI>coescoes</HI> of the East and that of the West
Indies, consists, according to my observation,
in the colour of the hair, which, in the East
India male, is all of a yellowish white: That
of the female is a little browner, with a black,
or rather brown line on the back. The head
<PB N="431" REF="507"/>
of the West India kind is shorter; but the head
of the male appears to be longer than that of
the female. The ears of the East are much
shorter than those of the West India species.
The description of the second species, mention∣ed
by Valentin, is too diffuse to afford any
certain information.”</P>
<P>That M. Vosmaër received male and female
animals from the East Indies, under the deno∣mination
of <HI>coescoes,</HI> I have no reason to doubt.
But the differences which he himself points out
between the coescoes and the opossums, may
lead us to conclude, that they are not animals of
the same species. I acknowledge, however, that
M. de Vosmaër's criticism is just, when he re∣marks,
that I made Seba's three philanders the
same animal, whilst, in fact, the third, represent∣ed
in his 39th plate, is a different species, and
is found in the Philippine Islands, and, perhaps,
in some other parts of the East Indies, where it
is known by the name of <HI>coescoes, cuscus,</HI> or
<HI>cusos.</HI> In the voyage of Christopher Barche∣witz,
I find the following notice:</P>
<P>“In the island of Lethy, there are <HI>cuscus</HI> or
<HI>cuscos,</HI> whose flesh has nearly the taste of that of
the rabbit. In colour they resemble the marmot.
The eyes are small, round, and brilliant. The
legs are short; and the tail, which is long,
has no hair on it. This animal leaps from one
tree to another, like the squirrel, and then fixes
its tail round a branch, that it may eat the fruit
more commodiously. It diffuses a disagree∣able
<PB N="432" REF="508"/>
odour, like that of the fox. The female
has a pouch under the belly, into which her
young go in and out below her tail. She leaps
from one tree to another, conveying her
young in this pouch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Barchewitz, p. 532.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>From the pouch under the belly, and the
prehensile tail, it appears, that the cuscus or
cusos of the East Indies is really an animal of the
same genus with the American opossum. But
this is by no means a proof that it belongs to
the same species with any of those which inha∣bit
America. This would be the only example
of such a coincidence. If M. Vosmaër had en∣graven
the figures of these coescoes, as he men∣tions
in the text, we would have been enabled to
form a more complete notion of the similarities
and differences which subsist between the Asiatic
coescoes and the American opossums. But I am
still persuaded that those of the one Continent
will never be found in the other, unless they are
transported thither. I refer the reader to what I
have said on this subject in p. 407. of this volume.</P>
<P>We mean not to deny the possibility of e∣qual
climates, in both Continents, producing
some animals of the precise same species. We
formerly remarked, that the same temperature,
in different parts of the globe, should produce
the same beings, both in the animal and vege∣table
kingdoms, if all other circumstances were
equal. We treat not here, however, of philo∣sophical
possibilities, which may be more or
<PB N="433" REF="509"/>
less probable, but of a very general fact, of
which numberless examples may be given. It
is certain, that, when America was discovered,
none of the following animals existed in the
New World: The elephant, the rhinoceros,
the hippopotamus, the camelopard, the camel,
the dromedary, the buffalo, the horse, the ass,
the lion, the tiger, the apes, the baboons, and a
number of others, which I have formerly enume∣rated,
p. 111. of this volume. In the same manner,
the tapir, the lama, the pecari, the jaguar, the
couguar, the agouti, the paca, the coati, the
sloth, and several others formerly mentioned,
did not exist in the Old Continent. Is not this
multitude of examples sufficient to guard us
against pronouncing, like M. Vosmaër, that
such and such animals belong equally to the
southern regions of both Worlds.</P>
<P>The following passage should be applied to
the Indian cuscus or cusos:</P>
<P>“In the Malucca islands,” Mandeslo remarks,
“there is an animal called <HI>cusos,</HI> which dwells
on trees, and feeds on their fruits. It resem∣bles
a rabbit, and has thick, frizzled, coarse
hair, of a mixed colour between gray and
red. The eyes are round and vivacious, the
feet small, and the tail so strong, that the ani∣mal
hangs by it on the branches, in order the
more easily to reach the fruit<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Mandeslo, suite d'Olearius, tom. 2. p. 384.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>In this passage no mention is made of the
pouch under the belly, which is the most di∣stinguishing
<PB N="434" REF="510"/>
character of the opossums. But
I still maintain, that, if the cusos of the East
Indies has this character, it is certainly a species
which approaches very near to the American
opossums; and I shall be inclined to think that
it differs from the opossum nearly in the same
manner as the jaguar differs from the leopard.
Of all the animals belonging to the southern
climates of both Continents, the two last, with∣out
being of the same species, make the nearest
approach to each other.</P>

The face, head, and upper part of the body, are of a tawny colour, and the belly of a yellowish white. The feet are co∣vered with short whitish hair. The toes are formed like those of the preceding species. The tail is slender, and covered with minute scales to the very rump. The length, from nose to tail, is about six inches and a half, and that of the tail the same.

The female has no pouch under the bel∣ly;
there are only two longitudinal folds near

themselves to the teats. The parts of genera∣tion

their form and position, those of the Virgini∣an
opossum. The glans of the male is also
forked, and placed in the anus; and this last a∣perture
seems likewise, in the female, to be the
orifice of the vagina. The birth of the young,
in this species, seems to be still more premature.

When they are brought forth, and attach them∣selves
to the teats, they are hardly so large as
small beans. The litter is also more numerous:
I have seen ten young, each of them fixed to a
separate teat, and yet the mother had four teats
unoccupied; so that, in all, she had no less than
fourteen teats. It is upon females of this spe∣cies
that the observations recommended in the
preceding article ought chiefly to be made;
for I am persuaded, that they bring forth a few
days after conception, and that the young, at
the time of exclusion, are only foetuses, as they
exceed not one fourth part of the growth which
foetuses generally acquire at that period. The
delivery of the mother is always a very early a∣bortion,
and the foetuses preserve their lives
solely by fixing to the teats, and never quitting
their hold, till they attain that degree of strength
and growth which they would have naturally
acquired in the uterus, if they had not been thus
prematurely excluded.</P>
<P>The murine opossum has the same dispositions
and manners as the Virginian species. They
both dig holes and burrow in the ground, fix
themselves to the branches of trees by the
extremities of the tail, and dart upon birds
and small animals. They likewise eat fruits,
grain, and roots. But they prefer fish and
crabs, which, it is said, they catch with their
tails. This fact is extremely doubtful, and ac∣cords
not with the natural stupidity ascribed to

these animals, who, according to the testimony

its head is somewhat thicker, and its tail larger
than those of the marmose or murine opossum,
and that, though it be of the same genus, it be∣longs
to a different climate, and even to a diffe∣rent
Continent. He then refers to Nieremberg
and Johnston for farther information concern∣ing
this animal. But it is evident, that neither
Nieremberg nor Johnston had ever seen it; for
they only follow Fernandes. None of these three
authors say that it is a native of Africa. They
mention it, on the contrary, as peculiar to the
mountains of the warm regions of America; and
yet Seba, without the smallest authority, pretends
that it is an African animal. That which we
saw unquestionably came from America. It was
larger, the muzzle was not so sharp, and the tail was
longer than those of the murine opossum, and in
every particular it approached nearer than the
latter to the Virginian opossum. These three
animals have a great resemblance in their exter∣nal
<PB N="440" REF="518"/>
and internal structure, in the supernumerary
bones of the pelvis, in the form of the feet, in
their premature birth, in their long and constant
adherence to the teats, and in their manners and
dispositions. They all belong to the same cli∣mate
of the New World. They are never found
in the cold regions of America, and cannot live
even in temperate climates. Besides, they have
all an ugly aspect. Their mouth, which is split
like that of a pike, their ears which resemble
those of a bat, their serpent-like tail, and their
feet, shaped like those of a monkey, exhibit a
strange picture, which is rendered still more dis∣agreeable
by their offensive smell, and by the
slowness and stupidity that accompany all their
actions and movements.</P>
