<HEAD>MINUTES <HI>of the Advocates at</HI> Edinburgh.</HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>July</HI> 30.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Robert Bennet,</HI> Dean of the Fa∣culty, presented a Medal from the Dutchess of <HI>Gordon,</HI> and made the following Speech, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“Her Grace sends, as a Present to you, the Medal of King <HI>James</HI> VIII. whom we and the <HI>English</HI> call the Pretender. I hope” Thanks are to be return'd for it.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Alex. Stevenson</HI> answer'd, <HI>That the Me∣dal shou'd be return'd to her Grace; for the re∣ceiving it was throwing Dirt upon the Face of the Government.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Robert Alexander</HI> of <HI>Black House</HI> second∣ed him, and said, <HI>That the receiving such a Medal was owning a Right contrary to her Ma∣jesty's.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Robert Frazer</HI> answer'd, <HI>That</HI> Oliver Cromwell's <HI>Medal, who deserv'd to be hang'd, and the Arms of the Common-wealth of</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>had been receiv'd, and why not this?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Mr. <HI>Duncan Forbes,</HI> Brother to <HI>Colloden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Joseph Hume of Nineboles,</HI> said, <HI>It was time enough then to receive the Medal when the Pretender was hang'd.</HI> To whom adher'd Mr. <HI>Hugh Dalrymple,</HI> Son to the President, Mr. <HI>James Ferguson,</HI> Son to Sir <HI>John Ferguson of Kirkennel,</HI> and Sir <HI>James Stuart of Goodtrees,</HI> her Majesty's Sollicitor.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dundass</HI> of <HI>Arniston</HI> after that rose up, and made the following Speech.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dean of Faculty,</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“Whatever these Gentlemen may say of their Loyalty, I think they affront the Queen whom they pretend to honour, in disgracing her Brother, who is not only a Prince of the Blood, but the first thereof; and if Blood can give any Right, he is our undoubted Sovereign. I think too, they bring her Majesty's Title in question, which is not our Business to determine. Medals are the Documents of History, to which all Historians refer: and therefore tho I should give King <HI>William</HI>'s Stamp with the Devil at his right Ear, I see not how it cou'd be refus'd, seeing a hundred years hence it wou'd prove that such a Coin had been in <HI>England.</HI> But, <HI>Dean of Faculty,</HI> what needs further Speeches? None oppose re∣ceiving the Medal, and returning Thanks to her Grace, but a few pitiful scoundrel Vermin and Mushrooms, not worthy our notice. Let us therefore proceed to name some of our Number, to return our hearty Thanks to the Dutchess of <HI>Gordon.”</HI></Q></P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
The Dean of the Faculty put it to the Vote, and carry'd it, That Thanks shou'd be return'd to her Grace by the said Mr. <HI>Dun∣dass</HI> and Mr. <HI>Horn of Westhall.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dundass</HI> ask'd, In what Terms he shou'd return Thanks?</P>
<P>The Dean of the Faculty, in the name of the whole Society, answer'd, <HI>That they wou'd approve whatsoever Mr.</HI> Dundass <HI>and Mr.</HI> Horn <HI>thought convenient.</HI></P>
<P>According to the Order given, Mr. <HI>Dun∣dass</HI> and Mr. <HI>Horn</HI> waited upon her Grace on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the third Instant <HI>July,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dun∣dass</HI> spoke to her Grace as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam,</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“We are deputed here by the Dean and Faculty of Advocates, in their Name, and for our selves, to return our most hearty Thanks to your Grace for all your Fa∣vours, and particularly for the Honour you did us in presenting us with a Medal of our Sovereign Lord the King. We shall always be proud of any Occasion to testify our Loyalty to his Majesty, and the Respect and Honour we have for your Grace.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<P>The Dutchess answer'd:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gentlemen,</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“I have always esteem'd the Faculty of Advocates as the most Learned and Gen∣tlemanny Society in <HI>Europe:</HI> And seeing they have made so fine a Collection of Books and Medals, I think every body
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
shou'd assist them. For my part, what∣ever of Value comes to my hand, of either sort, I shall freely bestow 'em upon” the Faculty.</Q></P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dundass</HI> reply'd:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam,</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“I hope, and am confident so do my Con∣stituents, that your Grace shall have very soon an Opportunity to compliment the Faculty with a second Medal struck upon the Restoration of the King and Royal Fa∣mily, and the finishing Rebellion, usurping Tyranny and Whiggery.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Medal was <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> with a Fleet of Ships coming to 'em, and the <HI>Motto Reddite</HI> on the one side; and on the other side the King's Face, with this Inscrip∣tion, <HI>Cujus est.</HI></P>
<P>75 were present, only 12 refus'd it.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>THis Medal is not new, for we have had an Account of it above a year ago; or rare, for 'tis common enough: nor does the intrinsick Value of it exceed half a Crown, so that it cou'd not be worth the Dutchess's while to present it, or the Faculty's to re∣ceive it on the account of its being new, scarce or valuable in it self.</P>
<P>Had the Advocates design'd it only as a Curiosity fit to have a place among their Col∣lection of Medals, they might as easily have got it as one of Mr. <HI>Dundass</HI>'s Copper Half-Pence that was stamp'd by a notorious Vil∣lain with the Devil at King <HI>William</HI>'s right Ear; and they might have put it in their Collection without any Noise, to have serv'd as a proof a hundred years hence that such a treasonable Medal had been struck, asserting the Pretender's Right.</P>
<P>But the presenting and rece<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing it with so much Parade, and endeavouring to make it the Act of the Faculty, is a publick and treasonable affront to her Majesty, an arraign∣ment of her Title, and a striking at the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession: all which is direct Trea∣son by the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
This Crime, which is as high as any that is cognizable by our Law, except it be Blas∣phemy against God, is further aggravated by its Circumstances.</P>
<P N="1">I. In that 'twas presented by a Lady of the highest Rank, and of one of the greatest Families in the Kingdom. This seems to have been done on purpose to give it the more weight for encouraging the Jacobite Faction, that a Lady of such high Birth in <HI>England,</HI> and marry'd to one of the chief and most potent Families in <HI>Scotland,</HI> shou'd dare in so publick a manner to espouse the Cause and Title of the Pretender. But one wou'd have thought her Grace might have consider'd how much her own Family had suffer'd by adhering to the Cause of the abdicated Fa∣ther, which is not like to be retriev'd by her intemperate Zeal for the pretended Son. Or had she consulted the History of the Duke her Husband's Family, she might soon have been convinc'd, that they have lost much of their antient Power and Grandeur, by adhering to the Cause of Popery and Ar∣bitrary Power since the beginning of the Reformation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> besides the Lives they have lost in the Field and otherwise on that occasion.</P>
<P>The Duke seem'd to be sensible of this, and therefore behav'd himself with such Mo∣deration when he held out the Castle of <HI>E∣dinburgh</HI> for King <HI>James</HI> at the Revolution, as justly procur'd him the Esteem of his Country, in which he has so great an Interest, and obtain'd him honourable Articles of
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Capitulation when he surrender'd. His peaceable Behaviour ever since seems to vindicate his Grace from having any hand in this weak Conduct of the Dutchess, who has neither consulted the Duke's In∣terest, nor that of the Marquiss her Son, whose matching with a Protestant Lady, and his other Conduct, is a proof of such Mode∣ration as becomes a young Lord of his Qua∣lity and Expectations.</P>
<P>It is true, the Religion of the Dutchess may plead something towards excusing her; but since her very Principles make her lia∣ble to the Law, such an Action as this is far from being proper to ward off its Pe∣nalties.</P>
<P>I come next to the Advocates, and must observe, that their very Profession heigh∣tens their Crime; and their being declar'd Protestants is far from lessening it, since the Step they have taken tends manifestly to overturn both Law and Religion, the preservation of which is the end of their Office.</P>
<P>But it wou'd seem, the Design of the Faction was to give Reputation to their Cause, by bringing in so many Gentlemen of the long Robe to espouse it. This they knew to be the readiest way to deceive the Vulgar, and to bring them into their Measures, since they are generally led by great Examples, and will be apt to con∣clude, that there can be no Danger in follow∣ing the Pattern set them by those who ought best of all Men to understand the Laws and Constitutions of their Country.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
The timing of this Transaction is also very remarkable on the following Ac∣counts.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it was so soon after the General Assembly of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had publickly declar'd themselves for the Pro∣testant Succession in the House of <HI>Han∣over:</HI> And their Sense being justly taken for that of the Bulk of the Protestants in the Nation, whom they fully represent in an Ecclesiastical Capacity, it wou'd seem the Faction thought it necessary to bal∣lance them, by what they wou'd pass upon the World as the Sense of those who are the Ministers of Law and Justice in that Country.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it was likewise so soon after her Majesty had declar'd by her Speech, at the close of last Session of Parliament, That she wou'd maintain the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession. From whence we have reason to conclude, that the Faction being sensible of the Hurt which this had done their Cause, they thought the only way to retrieve it, was by getting so many Lawyers to declare for it. That was necessary to revive the droop∣ing Spirits of the Party, who were baulk'd in the mighty Expectations they flatter'd themselves with, when they exerted their utmost Efforts to send up Persons of their own Stamp to represent <HI>Scotland</HI> in Par∣liament. This looks so like the Practice of the <HI>English</HI> Highfliers, to retrieve the Loss which their Cause sustain'd by the Sentence of Parliament against <HI>Sacheverel</HI>'s Doctrine, that we have reason to conclude
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
it proceeds from the same Source; that the Party, in both Nations, is acted by one and the same Spirit, and have the same per∣nicious Views.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it was at a time when our Ar∣mies are in the Field, venturing their Lives for the common Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and particularly for the support of her Majesty's Title and the Protestant Succession; which gives us reason to conjecture, that it was design'd on purpose to encourage a second Invasion by the Pretender, when the Na∣tion is exhausted of so great a part of its Force by foreign Expeditions. If this Re∣flection be thought too uncharitable, the Advocates may blame their Orator <HI>Dun∣dass</HI> for it, since he so boldly tells the Dutchess of <HI>Gordon,</HI> <Q>“That he and his Constituents did hope her Grace wou'd very soon have an Opportunity to com∣pliment the Faculty with a second Medal upon the Restoration of the King and the Royal Family.”</Q> Which, by the way, is a proof that they look'd upon her Grace as constituted Lady-Treasurer, to distribute the Pretender's Medals.</P>
<P>The Crime of the Advocates is aggrava∣ted by this, That they not only knew those Proceedings to be against Law, but obsti∣nately persisted in them, tho they were told so by some of their own Number, and particularly by Sir <HI>James Stuart</HI> her Majesty's Sollicitor, who by virtue of his Office, as well as by Principle, was oblig'd to rebuke them. This I take to be a plain Discovery of a latent Principle, which tho
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
the Faction have sometimes express'd upon occasion, they have not dared so publickly to own till now, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Acts made since the Revolution are no Laws, but the Effects of <HI>Rebellion, usurping Tyranny, and Whiggery,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Dundass,</HI> out of his exube∣rant Zeal, thinks fit to word it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Frazer</HI>'s cogent Argument comes next to be consider'd, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>“That since they had receiv'd the Medal of <HI>Oliver,</HI> who deserv'd to be hang'd, he thought it de∣fended the receiving of this.”</Q> I am apt to think this learned Gentleman was not aware that the Parallel was more exact than he'll be willing to allow; but with this Disadvantage to the Pretender, That he is actually condemn'd to such an infa∣mous Punishment by the Bill of Attainder, while he is yet alive; whereas <HI>Oliver</HI> was not condemn'd till after his Death. Be∣sides, his Usurpation is under the Cover of Fraud, whereas <HI>Oliver</HI>'s was by Force; which is the more honourable of the two, because we have a Chance to defend our Purse from a Highway-Man, which we can∣not so easily do from a Pick-pocket or Night-strouler, that does his Work in the dark. This can't be thought too severe, considering that the best Title which the Pretender's Friends have yet shew'd for his Right to the Crown, is, that of a Warm∣ing Pan, flyly convey'd under the Bed-Clothes. It must be own'd indeed, that tho in other Respects the Parallel is not so just; yet 'tis more to the Dishonour of Mr. <HI>Fra∣zer</HI> and his Associates, who receiv'd the
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Pretender's Medal as that of their pre∣sent Sovereign, and in Affirmation of his Title; whereas that of <HI>Oliver</HI> was re∣ceiv'd only as a Document of a Histo∣ry, which the Nation has more Cause to remember than to be in Love with: Be∣sides, that Medal sets up no Rival to the Title of her Majesty, or to that of the <HI>Ha∣nover</HI> Family. So that upon the whole, those Gentlemen gave Mr. <HI>Frazer</HI> a very full and pertinent Answer, who advis'd to suspend receiving the Medal till the Pretender was hang'd.</P>
<P>We come next to Mr. <HI>Dundass</HI>'s learn∣ed <HI>Speech,</HI> and cannot but observe the A∣greement betwixt that Gentleman's Ora∣tory and Arguments, and those of some of our modern Addressers. He alledges, that to dispute the Right of Blood, which is only a synonimous Term for what our Ad∣dressers call <HI>Hereditary Right,</HI> is to affront the Queen, and bring her Title in ques∣tion. Whether those Gentlemen will thank him for this natural Commentary on their Addresses, is not material; but we have reason to thank him for speaking out so plain, what they did only by halves. I'm afraid tho it will be found, that Mr. <HI>Dun∣dass,</HI> instead of defending her Majesty's Ti∣tle by this Proposition, arraigns that of her Majesty, and of all her Predecessors of the Family of <HI>Stuart:</HI> for it is plain, they deriv'd their Title not from Proximi∣ty of Blood, if we may credit the Laws and Histories of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but from an Act of Parliament, upon a Revolution, by
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
which <HI>Baliol,</HI> tho next in Blood was de∣thron'd, and all his Posterity declar'd un∣capable of the Succession, which was settled upon <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> and his lssue, from whom her Majesty is the twelfth or thir∣teenth in lineal Descent, by the Marriage of the Family of <HI>Stuart</HI> with <HI>Bruce</HI>'s Daugh∣ter. This makes it evident, that if <HI>Here∣ditary Right</HI> be Divine and Indefeasible, the Line of <HI>Stuarts</HI> were Usurpers <HI>ab initio;</HI> so much is her Majesty and a dozen of her Royal Ancestors, oblig'd to the Patrons of this Doctrine.</P>
<P>But further, Mr. <HI>Dundass,</HI> who is a Law∣yer by Profession, ought to know that the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to prevent all such Disputes about the Succession as happen'd in those Days, did make an Act, That in case of any future Competition for the Crown, the Controversy should be determin'd by Parliament; and that it was made an Article of their League with <HI>France,</HI> That whoever the States adjudged it to, should be supported by the Power of that Kingdom, as the <HI>Scots</HI> were oblig'd to sup∣port the like Decision by the States of <HI>France,</HI> if any such happen'd with relation to their Crown: so little was Indefeasible <HI>Heredi∣tary Right</HI> understood then in either of those Kingdoms. He may likewise know, that it did never obtain in <HI>Scotland,</HI> till since the Union of the two Crowns, when a few Pa∣rasites thought it the best way of making their Court. For this we cann't have a better Voucher, than the History of <HI>John Major</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Man, a Papist and Professor
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
of Divinity in <HI>France;</HI> who in his History dedicated to K. <HI>James</HI> V. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and first printed in 1527. <HI>Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Fol.</HI> 76, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of <HI>Ascensius</HI>'s Edition, maintains the Justice of <HI>Baliol</HI>'s being dethron'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. Because he was unfit to Reign, for ha∣ving betray'd the Rights of the Kingdom to <HI>Edward</HI> I. of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Because the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> derive their Right from the People.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because they had a Power to deprive the King and his Posterity if they deserv'd it, as well as to enthrone them.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Crown may be dispos'd of as shall be most to the Advantage of the Re∣publick.</P>
<P N="5">5. That Controversies about the Crown, ought to be determin'd by Parliament; with several other Arguments which 'tis needless to insist upon.</P>
<P>But we have a later Instance than that: The States of <HI>Scotland</HI> dethron'd Q. <HI>Mary</HI> for her Tyranny; and set up her Son K. <HI>James</HI> VI. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and afterwards the First of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in her stead. This Right of the States was never question'd by that Prince himself, and their Proceedings were approv'd by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> who sollicited Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to put Q. <HI>Mary</HI> to Death, for a Conspiracy against her Per∣son and Government. And when it was objected that Q. <HI>Mary</HI> was a Foreign So∣vereign, and therefore not subject to the Jurisdiction of <HI>England;</HI> they answer'd, That she was then no Sovereign, because justly depriv'd of her Authority by her own Sub∣jects;
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
as appears by Sir <HI>Simon d' Ewes</HI>'s Journal.</P>
<P>By all this it is plain, That Mr. <HI>Dundass</HI> and his Associates, discover either a gross Ignorance of their own Constitution, or a traiterous Hatred to it, when they call the Revolution, the Dethronement of the late K. <HI>James,</HI> and the Exclusion of the Popish Line, <HI>Rebellion, Ʋsurping Tyranny, and Whig∣gery;</HI> since it was warranted by such noble and unquestionable Precedents, and suppor∣ted by better Documents than the Preten∣det's Half-Crown Medal.</P>
<P>'Tis not worth while to take notice of Mr. <HI>Dundass</HI>'s scurrilous Language to the Gentlemen who oppos'd those treasonable Proceedings, any farther than as it shews the Fury with which the Jacobite Principles in∣spire those who entertain them. 'Tis not possible for these Men to keep within bounds; they divest themselves at once not only of all Principles of Loyalty and Christianity, but even of Humanity. Nothing but such a Degeneracy cou'd make one Gentleman give such Language to another in the face of a Society compos'd of Men of Families, and of the best Education that <HI>Europe</HI> affords. For besides what they learn at their own Schools and Universities, the Gentlemen of that Faculty do generally travel abroad, and study in those foreign Universities that are most fam'd for the Civil Law: So that they have always had the Reputation, as the Dutchess justly observes, of being as Learn∣ed and Gentlemanlike a Society as any in <HI>Europe.</HI> But these Proceedings shew that
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
too many of 'em have forfeited all Title to that Character, and that neither Birth nor Education are sufficient Antidotes against the Poyson of slavish Principles, of which Mr. <HI>Dundass</HI> is too pregnant an Instance.</P>
<P>It is not doubted but the Government will enquire into the Grounds of those Hopes which that Gentleman so confidently expresses in the name of himself and of his Constituents, that <HI>the King and the Royal Fa∣mily,</HI> as he thinks fit to call 'em, are to be so speedily <HI>restor'd.</HI> For it is scarce to be suppos'd that so many Gentlemen wou'd take such a dangerous Step as this, except they rely on some powerful Support that is capa∣ble of protecting them against positive Law. They are not ignorant of the several Acts which have pass'd to extinguish the Hopes of the <HI>pretended Prince of Wales,</HI> and for the Security of her Majesty's Person, and of the Crown in the Protestant Line: Nor can they forget the Act pass'd in the 7th of her Majesty, for improving the Union of the two Kingdoms, that makes the Laws re∣lating to High Treason, and the Proceed∣ings thereupon, the same in both parts of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> They must therefore either be possess'd with a Spirit of Madness, or think themselves sure of some impregnable Defence against those Laws. It has indeed been a long time observ'd, that the Jaco∣bite Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> have been very inso∣lent, and acted as if there were no such Laws in being. But whatever Reasons those who have been intrusted with the Admini∣stration in that Country have had for their Connivance at such Practices hitherto, it is
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
certainly high time now that those Reasons shou'd be superseded, when in such a Society as the Faculty of Advocates, who are by their Office Ministers of Law and Justice, her Majesty's Title and that of the Family of <HI>Hanover,</HI> is not only avowedly struck at, but the bringing in of the Pretender, and the Destruction of the Revolution-Party is so boldly threaten'd, under the Notion of <HI>giving the finishing Blow to Rebellion, usurping Tyranny, and Whiggery.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certainly high time for those who are Friends to her Majesty's Title and Per∣son, and to the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession, to take the Alarm, and to push on a thorow Enqui∣ry into the Reason of those Mens extraor∣dinary Confidence; since nothing less than all that is dear to us as Men and Christians lies at stake, if that Party succeed in their Designs.</P>
<P>'Tis perhaps without Precedent, that a Body of Men who live by the Law, shou'd so avowedly fly in the Face of it, and set up the Title of an attainted Traytor, in opposition to a Princess on the Throne, on pretence of doing her Honour, and support∣ing that very Title which they strike at. Such manifest Hypocrisy in other Cases, might perhaps be pass'd over with Laugh∣ter and Contempt; but in this it calls for a more serious Regard, and the Punishment it deserves. High-Treason is too dangerous an edg-Tool to play with. We are not, for the sake of the High Church Cant of <HI>Indefea∣sible Hereditary Right,</HI> and <HI>Ʋnlimited Passive-Obedience,</HI> to suffer our selves to be bully'd out of our Fortunes, Lives and Religion.
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
When any Church comes to such a Height, 'tis high time for the State to take it down.</P>
<P>These Men having thus thrown off the Disguise, it is time for the <HI>English</HI> High-Church Party to explain themselves, by Addresses of Abhorrence of those Mens Pro∣ceedings, except they wou'd have the World believe they are acting the same Part un∣der a Mask, which the <HI>Scotch</HI> Advocates act without one. If their Zeal for her Majesty and the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession be such as they pretend, 'tis time for them to vindicate their old Addresses from such a traiterous Commentary, by new ones; that the World may be convinc'd that <HI>Hereditary-Right</HI> and <HI>Passive-Obedience</HI> have not the same Meaning in <HI>England</HI> which the Popish and Episco∣pal Party put upon 'em in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis hop'd they will now see, that their Patronage of the Episcopal Conventi∣clers there, has been very ill plac'd, and that they will no more call the Prosecution of Traytors, a Persecution of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> These Men had the Boldness upon her Majesty's Accession to the Throne, to address her not only for their Liberty of Worship, but to be admitted into Benefices without taking the Oaths appointed by Law. They had the Confidence to pro∣pose it in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and when the Question was ask'd, whether in case such a Liberty was allow'd them, they would be willing to take the said Oaths? their Patrons reply'd, <HI>That if the Oaths were impos'd, 'twou'd be no Favour.</HI> The principal Argument made use of by the <HI>Scotch</HI> Episcopal Clergy to obtain this from her Majesty, was,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
That they were her Father's Friends. This was a pretty bold-Step from the Pulpit: But had the Advocates their will, they wou'd make one much bolder from the Bench, since they endeavour to excuse their Trea∣son against her Majesty, by being Friends to her Brother! God preserve us from such brotherly Love. We are sure the Apostles had no such Meaning, when they said, <HI>Let brotherly Love continue.</HI></P>
<P>We are oblig'd however to those Gentle∣men for speaking so plainly, and telling us what we are to expect when the Pretender comes, which is no less than that a finishing Stroke shall be given to our Liberties and Religion, by the utter Extirpation of what they are pleas'd to call <HI>Rebellion, usurping Tyranny, and Whiggery.</HI> We have no reason to doubt, but some of those learned Gen∣tlemen have been consulted in penning his Declaration, which to be sure will be con∣cer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d in modester terms; but we thank 'em for publishing the Commentary before the Text, and telling us, That the Whigs are to be treated as <HI>pitiful Scoundrels, Vermin, and Mushrooms.</HI> This is fair Warning for the Whigs to prepare for a Brush, before the Papists and Jacobites bring their Faggots.

<P>SInce the Defence of the Pretender's Title is now become so fashionable, that many scarce think it a Crime, and others do it more covertly, by crying up the Doctrine of <HI>Hereditary-Right,</HI> in which they think themselves patroniz'd by numbers of our Clergy, who wou'd persuade their blind Followers, that it is the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> it mayn't be improper to conclude these <HI>Remarks</HI> with an Account how our Laws stand in that respect, to prevent, if possible, the Peoples being fur∣ther deluded by those false Pretences, and especial∣ly by such as wou'd traiterously make some of the Acts of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. which seem to look that way, the Measures of our present Obedience: but how truly, will be seen by the following Acts.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Act for the <HI>Attainder of the pretended Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>of High-Treason,</HI> made in the 13th and 14th of <HI>William</HI> III. and to be found <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. of the Sta∣tutes of that Year, runs thus:</P>
<P><Q>“Whereas the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> hath, since the decease of the late King <HI>James,</HI> by the Incitation and Encouragement of the <HI>French</HI> King; <HI>(being bred up and instructed to introduce the Romish Superstition and</HI> French <HI>Government into these your Majesty's Kingdoms)</HI> openly and traiterously, with Design to dethrone your Majesty, assumed the Name and Title of <HI>James</HI> III. of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and caus'd himself to be so proclaim'd in the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> in manifest violation of your Majesty's most Lawful and Rightful Title to the Crown of these Realms, and of the several Acts of Parliament made, as well for recognizing of the same, as for settling the Succession of the Crown, contrary to the Duty of his Allegiance, and to the disturbing of the Peace of these your Majesty's Kingdoms: To the end therefore that

your Majesty's good and loyal People of <HI>England,</HI> assembled in Parliament, may, in the most solemn manner, express their utmost Resentment of so great an Indignity done to your Majesty's most Sa∣cred Person and Government; and that the said TRAYTOR may be brought the more certainly and speedily to condign Punishment, may it please your Majesty, that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, that the said pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> stand and be convicted and at∣tainted of High-Treason; and that he suffer Pains of Death, and incur all Forfeitures as a Traytor” convicted and attainted of High-Treason.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“And for preventing traiterous Correspondence between your Majesty's Subjects, and the said pre∣tended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> or his Adherents, be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any of the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> from and after the First of <HI>March,</HI> 1701. shall within this Realm or without, hold, entertain, or keep any Intelligence or Correspondence, in Person, or by Letters, Messages, or otherwise, with the said pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> or with any Person or Persons employ'd by him, knowing such Person to be so employ'd, or shall by Bill of Exchange or otherwise, remit or pay any Sum or Sums of Mony for the Use or Service of the said pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> knowing such Mony to be for such Use or Service; such Person so offending, being lawfully convicted, shall be taken, deemed, and adjudged to be guilty of High-Treason, and shall suffer and forfeit as in” Cases of High-Treason.</Q></P>

<P>By the Sixth of <HI>Anne,</HI> Chap. 7.

<HI>Mary,</HI> of ever blessed and glorious Memory, entitu∣led, <HI>An Act declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Sub∣ject, and settling the Succession of the Crown,</HI> and one other Act made in <HI>England,</HI> in the 12th Year of the Reign of his said Majesty K. <HI>William</HI> III. entituled, <HI>An Act for the further Limitation of the Crown, and better securing the Rights and Liberties of the Subject,</HI> and the Acts lately made in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> mutually for the Union of the two Kingdoms; or that the Kings or Queens of this Realm, with and by the Authority of Parliament, are not able to make Laws and Sta∣tutes of sufficient Force and Validity, to limit and bind the Crown, and the Descent, Limitation, In∣heritance and Government thereof; every such” Person or Persons shall be guilty of High Treason.</Q></P>
<P>We plainly see by these Acts, that <HI>Hereditary Right</HI> a∣ny otherwise than as it is settled by these Statutes, is fully abrogated; and that it is High-Treason to say any Person has a Title to our Crown, <HI>otherwise</HI> than accor∣ding to those Acts, which, (1.) Set aside the <HI>Hereditary Right</HI> in the case of K. <HI>William,</HI> Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> even during the Life of the late K. <HI>James;</HI> and (2.) Sus∣pended that of her present Majesty after the Death of her Sister during K. <HI>William</HI>'s Life: and (3.) Has set a∣side the <HI>Hereditary Right</HI> of the whole Pepish Line de∣scended from the Dutchess of <HI>Orleans,</HI> Daughter to K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore 'tis hoped People will not suffer themselves to be further impos'd on by the false Pre∣tence, that <HI>an Indefeasible Hereditary-Right is the Doctrine of the Church of England.</HI> For how high soever some of our Clergy carry that Point, and whatever Power they may assume, these Statutes will be found more high and pow∣erful than they; and if duly executed, will be sufficient to take them down. Let them produce a better Autho∣rity for their Doctrine if they can, than is here done for that of the Whigs; and till then, let them not oppose the Cant and Addresses of their High Church to the Laws of the State. I shall conclude with advising those Gentlemen to beware how they comfort and abet the traiterous <HI>Scotch</HI> Advocates, lest they come within the reach of the 1st <HI>Anne,</HI> cap. 17. For this is a Treason of a higher kind than that for which <HI>Damaree</HI> and <HI>Purchase</HI> escap'd being hang'd by the Intercession of their High∣flying Friends; and may make the Intercessors, if any be so bold as to do it, stand in need of Intercession for themselves.</P>
