<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Rise and Progress of the BEECH-OIL <HI>Invention,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> MAKE you a Present of the following Dis∣course; that is, I give you the Book <HI>gratis</HI>. Any Man, whose Thanks are worth receiving, will soon perceive it worth his Thanks: But I shall readily discharge you of the Obligation, if you will resolve to read it carefully.</P>
<P>When I say carefully, I mean <HI>thinkingly</HI>; that is, either read with Attention, like a Man of Understanding; be∣gin and go through the whole Discourse sedately, and re∣solve to weigh and judge impartially of what you meet with, or else lay down the Book, and trouble you self no farther. A wise Man puts himself upon the Level with
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
a Fool, as often as he judges rashly, and without due Reason.</P>
<P>The Subject of the Book being founded upon an Ac∣cident, which is like to make a greater Noise in the World than any Discovery in Trade for these many Ages past, I have thought fit to put my self to a very conside∣rable Expence, and send it as a Present to the House∣keepers of this City.</P>
<P>I should be glad, if the Example could stir up in Mer∣chants and Tradesmen of all Orders, a vigorous Applica∣tion to Searches after new Discoveries in their respective Callings.</P>
<P>Such an universal Bent of Genius would not only en∣rich a thousand private Families, but improve our Trade, encrease our Wealth, and firmly establish the Glory of the Nation.</P>
<P>Many, doubtless, have heard Talk of this Discovery before the Book comes to their Hands; and most of them were possibly possessed of an Opinion, that 'twas nothing but a Project. If these Men read as all Men should read, they will soon be forced to change their Sentiments.</P>
<P>Every Body now will see an open Demonstration of the Truth of this Fact: And the Tongues of Knaves and Fools will be no more at Liberty to slander what they have not Sense to comprehend.</P>
<P>Let me therefore seriously and with much Earnestness advise all Persons, to whose Perusal this Book shall come, to consider it as an Opportunity thrown into their Hands by Providence. If a rich Man gets it, he, who knows the Benefit of Riches, will be most pleased with so fair and easy Means of becoming still richer; and if it falls in the Way of such whose Circumstances are more narrow,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
'twill from that Time forward be their own Fault if they do not make themselves happy for their whole Lives after.</P>
<P>But here I must complain of a Crime, which is become as general as it is detestable, That mean, low-spirited Incli∣nation which prevails among Persons of all Ranks, to in∣dulge Detraction, and spread abroad the common Cries of <HI>Scandal</HI>; People are not satisfied with giving Credit to the <HI>silliest</HI> Falshoods, but are eager in applying the worst Interpretation possible to every new Matter they hear of; and then when their own unreasonable Distrust has made them think worse of a Thing than it deserves, they ne∣ver rest till they have brought over a thousand Proselites to their Folly, and stirr'd up a general Odium against a Devil of their own raising: And if, after all their Noise, their positive Affirmations, and obstinate Reproaches, they come to be convinc'd of the Truth, whether they will or no, They think it Attonement enough for the Mischief they have done, to declare with a grave Face, <HI>That they could not have thought it</HI>.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible to instance or remember half the idle Rumours and ridiculous Abuses, which have, with all the grave Formality of Truth, been spread about through Town and Country, with Design to blast the Credit of this new Discovery, which can possibly do no Man Hurt, but on the contrary will save the Nation Millions of Mo∣ney, and give Bread to many thousand Families, when I and all these empty Pratlers shall be Dust and Ashes.</P>
<P>This has made it in a manner necessary to put my self to such an Expence, to rescue the Undertaking from the Hands of Ignorance and Malice, and to make those har∣den'd Wretches blush, if it be possible, who have not only basely blacken'd such a publick Benefit, but misled great Numbers of well-meaning Men to follow their Example.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>How much more noble and becoming the great and ge∣nerous Soul of Man, had been an open and avow'd En∣couragement of any Thing, which bore a Face of Pub∣lick Good, and Service to our Country?</P>
<P>These idle Busie-bodies, these Tongue-Champions, who, like a Drum, owe all their Noise to their being hollow, These waspish, stingless Insects, ought to know, That the Guilt they practise is not only a Misapplication of their Time, and a Prostitution of their Reason, but an Act as base and villanous as breaking open Houses, be∣cause it prevents and intercepts a Blessing, which would chiefly fall upon the Widow and the Orphan.</P>
<P>Nothing can be plainer than the Truth of this; for if any Man or Woman, who think your Judgment clearer than their own, entreat you to advise them how to act in a doubtful Case, and you making use of the Autho∣rity they give you, should, out of Prejudice, Laziness, unreasonable Fears, or for want of due Thinking and En∣quiry, misrepresent the Fact, and disappoint them of a present Opportunity to make their Fortunes, which is never like to come again, If after this their Circumstan∣ces pinch them, Who but you stand guilty in the Sight of God, of all the Miseries which fall upon them?</P>
<P>Such is the Case before us. The Book in your Hands will give <HI>you</HI>, and every Reader, such an Opportunity; will lay open and explain the whole Affair, till it is made as clear and visible as the Light of Heaven; will confute and expose to Scorn the Impudence and Folly of those idle Cavils and Objections which are made against it, and demonstrate that there is no Hazard run; and that even if there were a Hazard run, it could bear no Pro∣portion with the Profit expected; and that tho' it were possible (which it is not) that all the little Money parted with should be lost for ever, the Loss would be so small, as hardly to be felt; whereas if the Thing succeeds, (as
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
it shall be made plain it must) the Contributor of a Trifle makes his Fortune by the Bargain.</P>
<P>It is worth remarking, that notwithstanding the Vi∣rulence, the Malice, which has been so long and so openly profess'd against this Undertaking, no Man has found it possible to start one probable Objection, or pro∣duce one Argument, which all his Subtlety cou'd main∣tain against even the first Answer, that was given him.</P>
<P>You, that hear People in Coffee-houses, or elsewhere, pretending to speak ill of the Invention, or advise against it; make This your Test of their Intention and their Honesty; Tell them, that Reason, and not Noise, shou'd be the End of Talking; and that you will soon be of their Mind, if they can give you any Argument against the Undertaking, which you cannot answer: Try them this Way, after you have read the follow∣ing Sheets, and you will soon see Folly in its proper Light, and learn to despise, instead of listening to, the Impotence of Defamation.</P>
<P>But to the Matter in Hand; <HI>London</HI>, 'tis true, has more Reason than any City of <HI>Europe</HI> to beware of <HI>Pro∣jects</HI>, for they have frequently prov'd ruinous to many of her Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Tricks and Cheats dress'd up with Artifice, and co∣ver'd with the specious Show of publick Good, or pri∣vate Benefit, have tempted many, and made wild Ha∣vock among credulous People; but is That a Reason, why they shou'd never listen to a new Proposal? No sure! It rather ought to teach them always to weigh a Proposition well, before they close with it; for the same calm Thought and serious Reflection, which will easily convince them of the Security, and firm Foundation of such an Offer, as is here made them, wou'd as certainly have detected and expos'd the false Bottom of the Pro∣jects,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
which they suffer'd by, and so prevented their own, and other People's Disappointments.</P>
<P>This word <HI>Project</HI> is now become downright scanda∣lous, and if we take it in the common Sense or Accepta∣tion, it ought for ever to continue so.</P>
<P>But I wou'd have you distinguish, that the Business we are now upon, is no <HI>Project</HI>; 'tis a <HI>Discovery</HI>; A Project is a Notion, which, having no real or visible Existence, the Issue subsists at best upon a precarious Probability. But a Discovery is a Secret in Nature, or in Art, which having long lain hid, is brought to light by some fortunate Accident, pretends to nothing, but what Experience justifies, and carries its Demonstration along with it.</P>
<P>For Example, The frequent Attempts which have been made, to turn baser Metals into Gold, commonly called the <HI>Philosopher's Stone</HI>, these were <HI>Project</HI>; And the Knowledge of the magnetical Virtue in the Loadstone, to which we owe the Compass, and its vast Improve∣ment in the Art of Navigation, this was <HI>Discovery</HI>.</P>
<P>People, who are apt to think slightly of these Mat∣ters, shou'd be taught to know, that the Inventors of useful Arts were held <HI>Sacred</HI> by the Wisdom of ancient Ages, and so far were People then from the present Practice of discountenancing Endeavours, conducive to the general Interest of Mankind, that they fell into the quite contrary Extream, and express'd the overflowing of their Zeal and good Will, by a downright Idolatry, worshipping them as Gods, and raising Altars, to adorn and eternize their Memory</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Bacchus</HI> made a Deity, for no other Reason than that he taught the Use of Grapes, and first drank Wine with his Cotemporaries, who before were igno∣rant
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
of any such extraordinary Vertue, in a Fruit, which was familiar to their Tast, and grew at large on every Mountain.</P>
<P>The Wisdom of our Rulers has not, perhaps, enough consider'd, what a Benefit the Nation wou'd receive from the Establishment of what I may call a <HI>College of Arts</HI>, of which I shall one Day speak more at large, and in which our aptest Youth might be instructed in the Theory of all such Knowledge, as relates to the Im∣provement of our Trade and Manufactures, and then sent abroad into all Parts of the commercial World, with constant and generous Allowances, to observe and com∣pare the Practices of other Nations, and labour to im∣prove on their Remarks, by any accidental Hints, which such extended Views might give a Being to; as an En∣couragement to which, they shou'd become entitled to certain known and stated Profits, Honours, and Distinc∣tions, if at their Return, they cou'd communicate a Se∣cret, useful to their Country.</P>
<P>I cannot help observing with a very great Concern, that by the unhappy Influence of Custom, the Learning most in Use amongst us, is least <HI>Useful</HI>; I think it is <HI>Ramus</HI>, who is somewhere of Opinion, that no Man of Letters ought to value himself upon his Skill in natural Philosophy, unless he can by Application of that Skill demonstrate himself, in the Effects, a better <HI>Gardner, Husbandman</HI>, or <HI>Merchant</HI>, than a common Dealer in those Arts; for, says he, 'tis justly we abhor and despise the idle Ostentation of sophisticated Universities.</P>
<P>'Tis for want of looking out upon the World, and understanding <HI>Things</HI>, as well as <HI>Books</HI>, that our Men of Learning are not far more serviceable to themselves, and the Publick, than they have hitherto been; Were Prac∣tice substituted in the Room of Speculation, the good Effects of Knowledge wou'd become as <HI>visible</HI>, as they are <HI>excellent</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>Examples best illustrate an Assertion; and Instances abound upon the Case before us.</P>
<P><HI>Thales</HI> the <HI>Milesian</HI> is the eldest Name in Philosophy; This good Man endeavouring to convince the Rich and Fortunate of his Time, that true Happiness consisted in the Practice of severer Virtues than they cared to be ac∣quainted with, Experienc'd that the Quality of the In∣structor wou'd be first regarded, and then a Judgment form'd upon the Worth of the Instruction.</P>
<P>As soon as he discover'd the Disease, he apply'd a Remedy; he foresaw in a Year of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lenty, by his Know∣ledge in natural Causes, that the following Season wou'd be liable to weather, that must damnify the Plants, and most especially the <HI>Olive-Trees</HI>, a Misfortune which hardly happen'd in an Age in that Country; upon this he finds means to engross and bargain for all the Oil he cou'd procure, at a very low and inconsiderable Rate; The next Year comes on, the Olives are destroy'd, the Commodity rises most prodigiously, and so the natural Consequence of this Bargain made him at once the <HI>rich∣est</HI> Man of all his Nation, and the <HI>more natural</HI> Conse∣quence of That, was, that every Body presently acknow∣ledg'd him the <HI>Wisest</HI>.</P>
<P>I will tell you another Story, and bring the Matter nearer home.</P>
<P>It is not out of some Men's Remembrance, that a young Gentleman, of no Fortune, a Student at <HI>Oxford</HI>, fell in Love with an Inn-Keeper's Daughter of that Town, whose Circumstances were very narrow; he had Philosophy enough to despise superfluous Wealth; and Judgment to foresee the Necessity of a Compe∣tence; but Love was Headstrong, and too hard for Rea∣son, so that, after a Year or two's ineffectual Delay, they bid defiance to their Stars, and had Courage enough
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
to marry; The Scholar gain'd a Wife, and lost a Fellow∣ship, the only small Subsistence he before depended on.</P>
<P>Our Inn-Keeper often upbraided the Bridegroom with the barren Effects of his Learning, and thought it very strange, as he well might, that while every Body told him, his Son-in-Law was a great Scholar, his whole Stock of Knowledge cou'd not help him to one Penny of his own getting.</P>
<P>Six or seven Months after this Marriage, the Father-in-Law dies, miserably poor, and the Credit, which his Industry maintain'd in his Life-time, dying with him, the Goods he left behind were seiz'd on by his Credi∣tors, and the Student and his young Wife turn'd out of Doors, to eat the Bread of Fortune, where they cou'd find it.</P>
<P>The Wife had a Relation in Town, unable to con∣tribute any great Assistance, she took them however in∣to a Garret of her House, where the Man cou'd only wast his Hours between Books and Sighs, while the Partner of his Sorrows made hard shift to pick up a Sup∣port by <HI>Knitting Stockings</HI>, at a certain common Price for every Pair.</P>
<P>At last, by a growing Belly, their Cares at once became more weighty, and their Patience less fortify'd; The only Subject of their Conversation now, was their melancholy Dread of what wou'd become of the poor Infant, who was to be born a Beggar.</P>
<P>But sitting constantly together from Morning to Night, the Scholar often fix'd his Eyes with stedfast Observation on the Motion of his Wife's Fingers, in the dextrous Ma∣nagement of her Needles; He took it into his Imagina∣tion, that it was not impossible to contrive a little <HI>Loom</HI>, which might do the Work with much more Ex∣pedition.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>This Thought he communicated to his Wife, and join∣ing his Head to her Hands, the Endeavour succeeded to their Wish, and thus the ingenious <HI>Stocking Loom</HI>, which is so common now, was first invented, by which he did not only make himself and his Family happy, but has left his Nation indebted to him for a Benefit, which en∣ables us to export Silk Stockings in great Quantities, and to a vast Advantage, to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se very Countries, from whence before, we us'd to bring them at considerable Loss in the Balance of our Traffick.</P>
<P>A Thousand like Improvements in every Trade, and every Nation, may, and will undoubtedly be made, when Accident or Necessity shall stir up the Imagination of industrious Men, to draw aside the Veil, which now conceals them.</P>
<P>I know not any Thing, which is a greater national Misfortune, than a general Byass towards enslaving Judg∣ment to Success; we seldom Measure our Opinions by the Reason of the Point in Question, but the previous Fortune of some Matter like it; Thus, if it happens, that a great and noble Undertaking, by some Accident has fail'd of the Success expected, every Proposal, which has the Misfortune to come after it, is without Exami∣nation compar'd to it, and condemn'd by Wholesale; and if on the contrary, any idle Project has succeeded well, Whatever rash, ridiculous Attempt has the good Luck to follow That, is sure to be encourag'd, and cry'd up, with as unjudging and precipitate a Violence, as the contrary had been decry'd and vilify'd.</P>
<P>I will Instance this in a particular Case or two, which almost every Man of Business can remember:</P>
<P>Captain <HI>William Phipps</HI>, who was afterwards made Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI> for his good Fortune, came over from <HI>New England</HI> in the Year 1687, and prevail'd upon the
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI>, Sir <HI>James Hays</HI>, and several other Gentlemen, to send him back with a good Ship, and all Things necessary, to dive, or <HI>fish</HI>, as I may call it, for a great Heap of Gold and Silver, which lay at the Bottom of the Sea, God knows how many Fathoms deep, in a <HI>Spanish</HI> Vessel, that had been cast away in the <HI>West In∣dies</HI>; Never sure were any Men of common Sense em∣bark'd in a more unpromising Adventure; 'twas above a Million to one against them, and if they had fail'd, the Attempt had been made the standing Jest of the whole Nation; but they succeeded even against all Prospect of Probability, and were enrich'd by the Accident; and the Consequence of this was, that a thousand Families have been since undone, by sending their Estates a Diving af∣ter Shipwreck'd Treasure.</P>
<P>On the contrary, there have, since that Time, been set on Foot two <HI>Unsuccessful</HI> Undertakings; The making of <HI>Salt-Petre</HI>, and the <HI>Mine-Adventure</HI>; one of which, in my Opinion, seems at least to have been founded on a very probable Expectation; but it happen'd, that they fail'd the Hopes of those concern'd, and every Thing that has been since propos'd, is presently rejected with a silly Grin; a Shake of the Head, and, <HI>Ay, This is just such a great Business, such an enriching, profitable Pro∣ject, as the</HI> Salt-Petre <HI>Works, and the</HI> Mine-Adventure.</P>
<P>A reasonable Man shou'd be asham'd of shooting thus at Random; it is not only a private Folly, but a national Disadvantage, that we indulge our selves in such little narrow Views of Things; These confin'd and selfish Un∣derstandings generally distinguish ignorant Men; you shall never fail to know a Fool, by his abounding with Impossibilities, and you may presently set your Mark upon a Man, who tells you, he can't believe such and such a Thing, <HI>because, if it had been in Nature, it had certainly been found out before our Time</HI>; Had all our An∣cestors been just as wise as He, they might have held their Hands in their Pockets, and gravely concluded,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
that <HI>Apricocks</HI> and <HI>Peaches</HI>, and <HI>Hops</HI> and <HI>Cherries</HI> wou'd not have grown in <HI>England</HI>, for it is not much above an Age, since they knew it by Experience.</P>
<P>Can any Thing be easier or less dangerous, than to hear at large, what a Man can say for any Scheme he has to offer? Our Opinion is our own still, and we may judge as we think proper; but to refuse to be con∣vinc'd, and then conclude a Thing impossible, is like winking hard at Noon-Day, and swearing, It is Mid∣night.</P>
<P>A free and open Ear shou'd still be lent to all Pre∣tences for the publick Good, or indeed towards better∣ing a Man's private Condition; we can lose nothing by listening, and may without the smallest Hazard re∣ject the <HI>Bad</HI>, and embrace the <HI>Good</HI> of every new Pro∣posal.</P>
<P>Had such a Spirit as this prevail'd amongst us, the War we have so much complain'd of, had been found no Burthen; Our Taxes had been equal, easy, and un∣felt; Our Fishery had not been the Treasure of the Dutch; Our Trade had been enlarg'd; Our Lands im∣prov'd; Our People multiplied; And our <HI>Poor</HI> instead of crowding our Streets with Objects of Misery, had been made a happy Means of new Advantages and Honour to the Nation.</P>
<P>But <HI>England</HI> is not chang'd from what she was of old; Her cunning Natives have been ever thus sharp-fighted in discovering <HI>Impossibilities</HI>; a most unhappy Genius! which often makes us <HI>laugh</HI> indeed, tho' we very rarely chance to <HI>win</HI> by it.</P>
<P>The Honour of discovering the new World might have been ours, but that our then Politicians were mer∣rily dispos'd, and laugh'd us out of the Wealth of the Indies.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>Had <HI>Columbus</HI> sail'd for <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>, as he did for <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabella</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>, we had <HI>really</HI> as well as <HI>nominally</HI> held the Balance of <HI>Europe</HI>.</P>
<P>Were it not for the natural Tendency of some Men's Genius to searches after new Discoveries; our heavy headed Impossibility Men had still eat Roots, and like their Brother Savages of <HI>America</HI>, had felt their Bodies as indifferently cloath'd, as their unfurnish'd Under∣standings.</P>
<P>'Tis an amazing Reflection, that a Man can put on his Shoes, his Shirt, his Coat; That he can eat Bread, drink Wine, or Ale, or read or write, or do any, even the commonest and most familiar Business of Life, with∣out remembring that he owes the very Power of doing what he is about, to a Blessing of humane Nature, which he is every Day prophaning, under the Name of <HI>Project</HI>.</P>
<P>The most ignorant Clodpate in a whole Knot of Pro∣ject-Killers daily warms himself by as good a Fire as he can get; he knows that it burns and has Heat, because it makes him rub his Shins, when he sits too close to it; but ask him for a Reason, why it does so, and he can give you none, <HI>but because it does so</HI>; Custom has made the Fact familiar to his Senses, and he never contemplates the Strangeness of the Object.</P>
<P>The same wise Enemy to Arts can look upon a Peice of Cloth in the Draper's Shop, is skilful enough to know the Fine from the Course, and the Cheap from the Dear; but as to the Skill, the Invention, by which it is brought to the Form he sees it in; why, That he thinks is no great Matter of Wonder; but show him, how to trace the Wool from the Sheep's Back, through all its numerous Changes, to its last Perfection, and then let
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
him ask himself, whether he thinks the Nation had got so many Millions by this Woolen-Manufacture, if some Body had not been wiser than He.</P>
<P>Let him but look back, and consider himself as born in one of the Infant Ages of the World, before the Art of <HI>Writing</HI>, or making Paper was discover'd; and a thousand to one but he had laugh'd till his Sides shook, when first he heard talk of a new Project, that was on Foot, forsooth, to converse with one another at a hun∣dred Miles distance, and explain a Man's Thoughts to a Friend without speaking a Word, by sending him a Par∣cel of black Marks, drawn out with a Pencil upon the inner Bark of a Cherry-Tree.</P>
<P>As common as these Things are become now, they had a Beginning, and were undoubtedly consider'd by un∣thinking Men, in as silly a Light as I place them; so will a thousand great Inventions more, which if any Body were to set about in publick, People wou'd look upon him as no better than a Madman.</P>
<P>Even Printing, Sailing by the Compass, and the dread∣ful Art of making Gun-Powder; are all Discoveries, as it were of Yesterday.</P>
<P><HI>Old Stow</HI> and many other Authors will inform you, what prodigious Slanders, Calumnies and Opposition, That noble and useful Undertaking of the New River met with, even to the Ruin of the poor Gentleman who first attempted it: But Experience having now con∣vinc'd the World, that such a Thing was possible, the Malice is forgotten with the Glory, and it ceases to be a Wonder:</P>
<P>Every Body remembers with a malicious Pleasure the Disappointments, which have been occasion'd by a few unfortunate Endeavours, and can too readily apply the Examples upon all Occasions; but no Man takes Pains
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
to carry in his Memory the <HI>fortunate</HI> Adventures and Discoveries, which have been made, tho' in Number far superior to the other.</P>
<P>For Example, 'tis not much above fourscore Years ago, that an honest plain Man discover'd the Way of <HI>burning Bricks with Sea-Coal</HI>, and began to practise it in Publick at his own Works; Upon this the rest of his Fraternity, with all the common Inhumanity of Malice, derided, and expos'd him; insomuch that his Attempt became the standing Banter of their silly Clubs, and made up all their Conversation.</P>
<P>They went on thus merrily, 'till at the End of a Year or two, in the midst of their Pleasantry, their Trade fell off at once, by the Increase of their Rival's Business, and they saw themselves reduc'd to a Necessity of quitting their old beaten Road to follow that, which they had made so free with, or they must soon have wanted Bread to the good Drink, they had been so merry over.</P>
<P>The late Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was, I think, the first who encourag'd and set on Foot, the Art of making here in <HI>England</HI>, that fine clear Sort of Glass for Coaches, and the Pannels between Chamber-Windows; He was follow'd with Success by some other ingenious Men, and every Body knows, that now, instead of paying vast Sums of Money every Year to <HI>Italy</HI> for this kind of Ware, we make as fine Glass as any in the World, and that our Merchants export great Quantities to their considerable Profit, and the Nations no small Advantage.</P>
<P>In <HI>Venice</HI> this Art of improving Glass was carried to a yet higher Perfection; for a certain Tradesman of that City had invented a Way to make it malleable, that is, to lose its brittle Nature, and to bear beating into any Form with a Hammer, like a Piece of Iron, without be∣ing robb'd of its Transparency, and the Reward this no∣ble
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Discoverer met with for his Pains, was, that the Glass-Makers found Means to hire a Set of Ruffians to dog him in a dark Night, as he came from the Opera, who tied a Stone about his Neck, and drown'd him in one of the common Water Courses of the City.</P>
<P>All <HI>Europe</HI> knows, that <HI>France</HI>, almost in the Minority of her present King, was forc'd, at a most prodigious annual Expence, to buy her Silks from <HI>Italy. Mulberries, 'twas plain, would never grow in that cold Country, and the Silk Manufacture could not be expected to thrive so much nearer to the North: Their Frosts would kill the Worms; or, if not, the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fit of their Labour would be doubly eat out by the Charges</HI>.</P>
<P>In the Midst of all these <HI>invincible</HI> Difficulties, Mon∣sieur <HI>Colbert</HI>, and certain other great Spirits among them, despising the common Cant of such ridiculous Ob∣jections, resolved at least to put it to a Tryal, and found it at once inexpressibly easy, and immensely profitable. Their King's Revenue richly feels the Benefit of these Gentlemens Industry; and the <HI>impossible</HI> Silk Trade of those Parts now gives Subsistence to above a hundred thousand of their Families.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>France</HI>, as well as <HI>England</HI>, produces some of these Lethargick Animals: But in the Case before us, publick Experience made them blush at the Remem∣brance of their Ignorance; and to atone for past Folly, they fell in among the foremost to the Practice of this Art, which has added so much Honour to the Name of <HI>France</HI>, and such a Treasure to their Country.</P>
<P>So that admit a <HI>French</HI> Man heavy, he is not, we see, <HI>incorrigible</HI>. Example has at worst the Power to animate the heaviest of their Clods: But let us compare the <HI>French</HI> Men of those Days with their Cotemporaries of our Island, and their Darkness will appear bright, by the Inequality of the Comparison.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/><HI>England</HI> had then a Prince upon her Throne, as watch∣ful for his Country's Good as any Monarch who has reign'd before or after him.

<P><Q>“IT is a principal Part of that Christian Care which appertains to Sovereignty, to endeavour by all Means possible, as well to beget as to encrease among their Peo∣ple the Knowledge and Practice of all Arts and Trades, that thereby they may be both wean'd from Idleness, and the Enormities thereof, which are infinite, and be∣come exercised in such Industries and Labours, as are accompanied with evident Hopes, not only of preserving People from the Shame and Grief of Penury, but also of raising and encreasing them in Wealth and Abun∣dance, the Scope which every free-born Spirit aims at, not in Regard of himself only, and the Ease which a plentiful Estate brings to every one in his particular

Condition, but also in Regard of the Honour of their native Country, whose Commendation is no way more set forth, than in the Peoples Activeness and Industry. The Consideration hereof having of late employ'd our Mind, who always esteem our Peoples Good our neces∣sary Contemplation, we have conceiv'd, as well by the Discourse of our own Reason, as by Information ga∣ther'd from others, that the Making of <HI>Silk</HI> might as well be effected here, as it is in the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI>, where it has of late been put in Practice; for neither is the Climate of this Isle so far distinct or different in Condition from that Country, especially from the hither Parts thereto, but that it is to be hop'd, that those Things, which by Industry prosper there, may by like Industry have like Success here; and many private Per∣sons, who for their Pleasure have bred of those Worms, have found by Experience, that they may be nourished and maintained here, if Provision were made for Planting of Mulberry-Trees, whose Leaves are the Food of the Worms: And therefore we have thought good hereby to let you understand, that although in suffering this Invention to take Place, we shew our selves somewhat an Adversary to our Profit, by diminishing our Customs for Silk brought from beyond the Seas, nevertheless when there is so great a publick Utility to our King∣dom and Subjects in general, and whereby (besides Multitudes of People of both Sexes, and all Ages) such as, in regard of Incapacity, are unfit for other Labour, may be set at work, comforted, and relieved, we are content that our private Benefit shall give way to the publick: And therefore, being perswaded that no well-affected Subject will refuse to put his helping Hand to such a Work, as can have no other End in us but the Desire of the Welfare of our People, we have thought good in this Form to require you (as a Person of greatest Authority in that County, and from whom the Gene∣rality may receive Notice of our Pleasure with more Conveniency than otherwise) to take Occasion, either at the Quarter-Sessions, or at some other publick Place
<PB N="$$" REF="20"/>
of Meeting, to perswade and require such as are of Ability (without descending to trouble the Poor, for whom we seek to provide) to buy and distribute in that County the Number of Ten thousand Mulberry-Plants, which shall be delivered unto them at our City of — at the Rate of three Farthings the Plant, or at six Shil∣lings the Hundred, containing five Score Plants. And because the Buying of the said Plants at this Rate may at the first seem chargeable to our said Subjects, (whom we would be loth to burthen) we have taken Order, that in <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April</HI> next, there shall be deliver'd at the same Place a good Quantity of Mulberry-Seeds, there to be sold to such as will buy them, by Means whereof the said Plants will be deliver'd at a smaller Rate than they can be afforded, being carried from hence; having resolved also in the mean time, that there shall be publish'd in Print a plain Instruction and Direction, both for the increasing of the said Mulberry-Trees, the breeding of the Silk-Worms, and all other Things needful to be understood, for the perfecting a Work every way so commendable and profitable, as well to the Planter, as to those who shall use the Trade. Having now made known unto you the Mo∣tives, as they stand with the publick Good, wherein every Man is interested, because we know how much the Example of our own Lieutenants and Justices will further the Cause. If you and other your Neigh∣bours will be content to take some good Quantities hereof to distribute upon your own Lands, we are content to acknowledge thus much more, that all Things of this nature tending to Plantation, Increase of Sci∣ence, and Works of Industry, are Things so naturally pleasing to our own Disposition, as we shall take it for an Argument of extraordinary Affection towards our Person, and form our Judgment of your Dispositions, as you shall express in any kind your ready Minds to further the same, and shall esteem that in furthering the same, you seek to further our Honour and Con∣tentment (having seen in a few Years past, that our

<P>You see here a King, endeavouring by the Force of promised Rewards and threatned Punishments, to make his People only sensible of their own Interest, and con∣descending even to play the Gardener and the Seedsman to accomplish his Design. And what do you think was the Effect of all his Reasons? Why scarce a Man thought decently of his Attempt; Not a Seed was sown; Not a Tree was planted; But the merry Creatures laugh'd immoderately at their good old Sovere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn's being turn'd <HI>Projector</HI>, while they universally neglected and despised the Excellence of his Intention.</P>
<P>After This I hope you will not wonder, that the In∣dustry of private Men is misinterpreted, malign'd, and render'd fruitless, when a mighty King, with all his Strength of Power and Persuasion, addressing himself to a People who had sworn Obedience to his Orders, could meet no better Success in Pursuit of an Attempt which he begun, and push'd, with such a generous Ve∣hemence.</P>
<P><PB N="$$" REF="22"/>Even our boasted Woollen Manufacture is in a manner new amongst us. Every Body knows that till the Reign of one of our <HI>Edwards</HI>, we were forc'd to send abroad our unwrought Wool to <HI>Antwerp</HI>, and other Places, there to be made into Cloth, and then brought back, and sold to us again at a Price so extravagant, that the Nation was <HI>impoverished</HI> by the very Wool, which has since those Times been found the only Means of making us a <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Flourishing</HI> People; So necessary and beneficial is a due Encouragement of national Industry.</P>
<P>There is scarce a Silk-Weaver, Hatter, Powterer, or any other Tradesman amongst us, but can remember, if he pleases, what vast Improvements, in his particular Calling, he has in his own Time been a Witness to the Discovery of.</P>
<P>But to bring this Argument still closer to our Purpose, there is a common Trade now carried on in every Cor∣ner of <HI>Great Britain</HI>, and which is therefore never taken Notice of as a Thing extraordinary; I mean the <HI>Rape-Trade</HI>; that is, the making great Quantities of <HI>Oil</HI> from <HI>Rape-Seed</HI>, or <HI>Cole-Seed</HI>, which is positively the clearest and the fullest Proof that can be wish'd for, of the Profit and Infallibility of the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h-Oil Discovery:</HI> And he who first brought into Practice this Rape-Oil Trade, wanted nothing but the Prudence of solliciting a Patent, which he was undoubtedly entitled to, to have made himself the Master of as great a Fortune as any in the Kingdom. Hundreds yearly at this very Day get Estates by that Trade, which at Four Shillings a Bushel p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oduces <HI>less</HI> Oil, and far <HI>worse</HI>, than our Beech-Mast, which can never cost Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel.</P>
<P>The Land that bears this Rape is let at an extraordi∣nary Rent, and cultivated at a vast and constant Expence. The Seed is sow'd and reap'd with much Toil and Hazard, and all this Pains and Charge must be repeated annually;
<PB N="$$" REF="23"/>
whereas in making Beech-Oil, we have, without any ploughing or sowing, a common Forest Product to work upon, more plentiful in most Places than the very Acorns, and of less reputed Value, as will by and by be prov'd be∣yond a Possibility of Contradiction. Our Charges there∣fore can be nothing but the Price of shaking the Trees, and sweeping up our Harvest, of which, one Bushel, as you may see experienc'd every Day, yields more Oil, and better, than the same Quantity of Rape-Seed, and yet the Rape-Seed is obtain'd at almost ten times the Hazard, Expence and Inconvenience.</P>
<P>I will add a Word or two in general by way of Ad∣vice, That, to prevent a frequent Overlooking such Ad∣vantages as these, People would begin to think a little more of their private Business, and trouble themselves less with the Concerns of the Publick; and then I hasten more particularly to the Design in Hand.</P>
<P>It is impossible for any Man, but one who has expe∣rienc'd it, so much as to imagine what a Number of these profitable Secrets might be easily discovered. This is a Way of growing rich, not only far more ready, but more delightful too, than any of the common ones. It makes a Thousand other Peoples Fortunes, at the same Time that it improves your own.</P>
<P>I am almost afraid to venture such a Declaration among the disingenuous Tempers of Mankind, or I could in∣stance and disclose some Six or Seven such Examples, which I have my self discover'd in my small Pursuit of Nature, as might animate the dullest Clod, and would perhaps awake the sleepy Genius of our Nation.</P>
<P>It wou'd be very ill-natur'd to put a wrong Interpre∣tation upon my Meaning in this Place; I wou'd not have you believe, I lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k upon my self, as Master of a sharper Sight than other People. That Kind of Vanity, if a Man
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
can know himself, is not my Fault, and I readily declare, that there is no great Merit in Discoveries of this Na∣ture: They are meerly owing to a Virtue very common, but generally misapply'd; The plain Effect of downright Industry, and Thinking a little out of the beaten Road.</P>
<P>If any Body wonders then that such Discoveries are not more frequent, since we have a great many wise and industrious Men in <HI>England</HI>, the Answer is plain; Most Men are from their Infancy design'd to some particular Way of Life; They are either born to Estates, which draw them on to Pleasures, incompatible with the Seve∣rity of Thinking, Or they are bred to Divinity, or Law, or Trade, or some known Track of Business, the Persuit of which gives them no Leisure to think of other Mat∣ters, and brings them in a <HI>certain little</HI> Profit, which they think it imprudent to abandon for an <HI>uncertain Greater</HI>; Or they are busied in Endeavours to procure and preserve some great Man's Favour; Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y are looking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut for Posts at Court, or elsewhere; Thus in different Spheres, the Generality of Mankind are engag'd in Appli∣cations, which requiring all thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Stock of Thought, leave them no Room to trace such Views, as I am speak∣ing of; which, however easy to the Search, must, not∣withstanding, be the Product of Solitude and Retirement.</P>
<P>To be a little more particular, and justify the general Assurance I just now gave you; that my own Experience has demonstrated, how very well worth a Man's while it is, to bend his Thoughts this Way; I think my self oblig'd to declare, at least by two or three Examples, upon what Founda<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions I took the Liberty to speak in that manner.</P>
<P>Every Body knows that <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es-Wax</HI> is a Commodity generally consumed, not only in this Kingdom, but all over <HI>Europe</HI>, and that most People of Fashion burn great Quantities of Wax Candles in their Houses, which they
<PB N="$$" REF="25"/>
buy at a considerable Charge; And yet there is a com∣mon Vegetable, almost the Growth of every Hedge, which yields a Wax, even finer than this Bees-Wax, at an Expence so inconsiderab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, that I am very sure, and cou'd prove it, if I pleas'd, that in the Practice of the Thing, a Pound of such Wax-Candles wou'd not cost Three Half-pence:</P>
<P>And here, to spoil the Sport of a few shallow Wretches, who are very fond of an Opportunity, to expose them∣selves to the Remark of an old Proverb, That the great∣est Fool is the loudest Laugher; I must inform them, That as strange a Secret, as they will think this, there is nothing of wonder in it; for every Sea-Captain, who has been us'd to Trade upon the Continent of <HI>America</HI>, is very well acquainted with the <HI>Myrtle Wax-Candles</HI> of <HI>Carolina, Virginia</HI>, and other Plantations.</P>
<P>Now, if in these Countries, which have been so long possess'd by the <HI>English</HI>, it is a usual Thing to make Wax-Candles of a common Berry which grows upon the Myrtle-Tree, pray which in Reason ought to be esteem'd the greatest Wonder? That a Secret, chiefly owing to the Imitation of this Practice, shou'd be now discover'd here in <HI>England</HI>, or that it shou'd not have been found out by the same Means half an Age ago?</P>
<P>Another Discovery, which is rather more extraordi∣nary than the foregoing, after several failing Attempts, has perfectly succeeded, and I have lately bestow'd it upon an honest Gentleman▪ who will soon by open Prac∣tice, to his vast Advantage, demonstrate to the World a Secret, which, like the Egg of <HI>Columbus</HI>, must appear so easy, that the only Wonder will be, why every Body did not hit upon it; The Fact is this, that the Charge of a single Penny, exclusive of the Price of Coals, produces a Gallon of <HI>Aqua-vitae</HI>, much fitter for all common Uses, than the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rice rectify'd Spirit of Malt.</P>
<P><PB N="$$" REF="26"/>I was once discoursing with a Gentleman concerning the Oil, which we now make from Beech-Mast, after it has for so many hundred Years been trampled under Foot in every Wood, and look'd upon as good for just nothing, but feeding Hogs; I wish Sir, said the Gentle∣man, smiling, you cou'd find out some profitable Use for <HI>Acorns</HI>, as well as Beech-Mast, for I believe I have two or three hundred thousand Bushels this Year upon my own Oaks; I told him, that if he cou'd be serious enough to thank me for my pains, I wou'd make those Acorns worth almost as much Money as the Oaks they grew upon; he seem'd to think me not in Earnest, till, to convince him that I was, I told him, that while the <HI>Tan∣ners</HI> give such Rates for the <HI>Bark</HI> of those Trees, they wou'd do well to make Use of the <HI>Fruit</HI> only: For in <HI>Italy</HI> and all over the <HI>Archipelago</HI>, they use nothing in the Tanning Trade, but <HI>dry'd Acorns</HI>, which being beaten down with Poles, in vast Quantities, and at an inconsiderable Expence, are afterwards ground to pow∣der, as our Bark is, and us'd for the same Purposes, with a much better Effect; they call it in their Tongue <HI>Velania</HI>: What use the Gentleman thought fit to make of the Opportunity put into his Hands, I know not, but I am very sure, it was his own Fault, if in such a Year as this, which is none of the best neither for Acorns, he neglected a Business, by which any Man might have got a very good Estate without much Charge, and with no manner of Hazard.</P>
<P>But to what Purpose shou'd I enumnerate these In∣stances, which I am morally assur'd t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> invincible Stupi∣dity of an unthinking Age, will ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er turn into Ridi∣cule, than believe, or make the proper Use of; How∣ever, if they serve to stir up the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire of some wiser Men's Ingenuity, my Country will be benefited, and my Design has succeeded; I pay back the Impudence of Folly, with an equal Weight of Scorn.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>And here, since I have ventur'd to stand out a Mark for Censure, by hinting one or two, out of many useful Discoveries, which I have my self been fortunate enough to make, even in the Morning of my Life, and for the Truth of all which I can appeal to living Witnesses, I will go on yet further, and do engage my self by solemn Promise to my Country, to demonstrate a much greater seeming Impossibility, if I have the Honour of a Vote in the next Parliament, in gratitude to those honest Bur∣gesses, who were lately pleas'd to send me up an Invita∣tion to represent them, under the common Seal of their Corporation.</P>
<P>To express my Meaning well, I must take Notice, that while every Man is forward enough to run with the Herd, and complain how many Millions the Nation stands endebted for, no Body thinks himself concern'd so far as to consider, by what Means the publick Credit may be clear'd from so prodigious an Incumbrance; we are poorly contented to look upon it as a Thing impossi∣ble; and yet is This Giant's Task an easy Undertaking, and cannot but be universally acknowledg'd so, as soon as the Proposition shall be made in Parliament, where immediate Birth may at any Time be given to a Fund, which, without the least Oppression or Complaint, will be capable to supply at once as many Millions, as will pay off all the Debts of the Nation, and deliver us from <HI>Poors-Rates, Excise, Land-Tax</HI>, or almost any Tax at all for ever after.</P>
<P>Unequal Taxes are the Ruin of a Kingdom, and while it is the hardest Task of publick Care to divide This ne∣cessary Burthen fairly, The design'd Proposal is so fully Equal, that it will affect each several Member of the Body Politic in a due Proportion to the Difference of Circumstances.</P>
<P>Instead of oppressing and lying heavy upon Trade and
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
Manufacture, the Influence of this Fund, will almost double the Benefit, and Ease of Either.</P>
<P>'Tis a new, unheard of Kind of Contribution; and while every single Person in the Kingdom joins to raise it, it will, notwithstanding That, be paid insensibly.</P>
<P>It cannot but be welcome to the People, because no Man will know that he pays a Farthing; nay, he now pays the same Money over and above all Taxes, which, by being made a Tax, will become the only Tax he has to pay.</P>
<P>Every Man in the Kingdom, consider'd in his pri∣vate Capacity, will save a great deal more Money by paying this, than his Share in the Payment can coun∣terbalance:</P>
<P>It will be capable of almost infinite Improvement; It will immediately bring in a Revenue of four Millions a Year, and add to the national Stock of Money above four and twenty Millions <HI>Sterling</HI>.</P>
<P>It differs from all other general Contributions in This Particular; That tho' the Charge of collecting it will be very great, tho' no Way dangerous, yet it is provided for by a Means arising within it self, and will occasion no Deduction from the Revenue it produces.</P>
<P>It will naturally, and without Compulsion, reduce the Interest of Money to 3 or 4 <HI>per Cent</HI>, and conse∣quently raise the Purchase of Land in the same Propor∣tion:</P>
<P>In short, It will change at once the Condition of the Publick, from very uneasy to compleatly happy, and not a Man draws Breath amongst us, but will share the Benefit.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>I have taken This Task upon me, and will in due Time make it Good; Mean while I leave it to the Buz of many an idle Fly, who will undoubtedly be blowing on it, and return to my subject, from which I only di∣gress'd, to give another Proof, that Things, which seem impossible, are very easy to the Reach of Application.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common in the Mouths of our Peo∣ple, than that all Trades are overstock'd with Numbers of Professors, and that they eat the Bread out of one another's Mouths. If this be true, there is no Remedy so good for the Disease, as That which I am recommend∣ing; Every new Discovery in Trade lays open a new Mine of Treasure, and disburdens the overloaded Pro∣fessions; for the more new Trades arise, the fewer Pro∣fessors will encumber the old Ones, and consequently the greater will their Profits be, and the less the Misery and Poverty of the Nation:</P>
<P>But I have now done with the Introduction; and will hasten to the more immediate Business of the Book; which is, to give you; <HI>First</HI>, A particular Account of the Invention it self; <HI>Secondly</HI>, By what means I first became Master of it; next, what Steps I took to expe∣rience, and make sure the Benefits which might attend it; Then all that has been hitherto done in the Affair; And lastly, What further Measures I propose to take, in order to the general Establishment, and carrying on so great and weighty a Concern.</P>

<HEAD>AN EXPLANATION OF THE DISCOVERY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT you may the better understand, what this Discovery means, and what predigious Benefit will accrue to the Nation by it, you must first know, that the two great Trades of the Soap-maker and Clothier do wholly depend upon Oil, which is for the most Part brought in from beyond-Sea, and costs the Nation many Millions, as you will see plainly prov'd, beyond all Possibility of Contradiction.</P>
<P>There is in all the Forests of <HI>England</HI> a very common Tree, call'd a Beech-Tree; much larger than the Oak; There are vast Woods almost every where, of nothing else but this Beech; most of our Noblemen, and private Gentlemen have large Quantities, and some of them se∣veral thousand Acres of Beech in their own Estates, as particularly the Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI>, the Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI>,
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
the Earl of <HI>Scarborough</HI>, the Earl of <HI>Winchelsea</HI>, and an endless Number more in all Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>There are within forty Miles round <HI>London</HI>, many hundred thousand Acres of full grown, bearing Beech, almost without any other Tree intermix'd with them.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common than for one of these Beech-Trees to bear fifty Bushels of that three corner'd Beech-Mast, of which y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u have a Sample sent you with this Book, as you also have of the outward Husk, in which it grows, tho' I don't reckon the Husk, but the Ker∣nels only, when I say that it is a common Thing for one Tree to bear fifty Bushels of Beech-Mast.</P>
<P>About the latter End of <HI>September</HI>, the Husks, which hang like Ropes of Onions, and weigh down the Bran∣ches, open of their own Accord, and let fall the Mast, three corner'd as you see it, in such vast Quantity, that the Ground is every where cover'd over with it several Inches deep.</P>
<P>Some Part of This the Hogs devour, or in Parks the Deer; The rest, having no known Use, lies rotting on the Ground, and Spoils the Herbage. 'Tis hardly ever known to be gather'd, and when it is, the Poor have Six-pence, or Eight-pence a Bushel for picking it up, and carrying it to some honest Farmer's Wife, for a fa∣vourite Hog, or so, that is to be kill'd against Christ∣mas.</P>
<P>Now the Discovery is This; That every Bushel of This common Mast, which has lain neglected and despi∣sed for so many Ages, is found to yield two Gallons of much better Oil, than That made of Olives, which the Clothiers and Soap-Makers call <HI>Seville-Oil</HI>, or <HI>Galipoli-Oil</HI>, and for which the Nation pays such prodigious Sums of Money to Foreigners.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>So that This Discovery, hitherto a Secret, adds an Honour, and a Profit to the Publick; and may therefore fairly be allow'd to give a private Benefit to him, who brings it into Practice; And the Malice and Ill-nature it has met with, will be condemn'd by every honest Man, as a Discouragement to Industry, and dishonourable to the Character of our Countrymen in General.</P>
<P>You are not desir'd to take my Word for any Thing, I have affirm'd; you shall in the following Part of this Discourse, have such undeniable Proofs, and Demon∣stration, that no Man in his Senses will presume hereafter to open his Mouth in Opposition to it.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>An Account of the Time When, and man∣ner How, This Discovery was first made.</HEAD>
<P>I Was a Boy, not quite fifteen Years old, when I first left <HI>England</HI>, in the Year 1699, and began those Travels, which, till a few Years since, kept me out a constant Wanderer over most Parts of the World.</P>
<P>I came in the Year 1700, to <HI>Naples</HI>, where carelesly neglecting a little Cold, I had got, it became on a Sudden very troublesome and violent.</P>
<P>I apply'd my self for Advice to an Apothecary, at whose House I happen'd to lodge, and after several un∣successful Attempts in his common Rules, he desir'd me to drink a pretty large Quantity of Oil of sweet Almonds.</P>
<P>I had a very strong Aversion to Oil, of any Kind, and cou'd not be prevail'd upon to follow this Advice,
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
till he told me, that if I lov'd the Almonds themselves, I cou'd not dislike their Oil, which was pure, and sim∣ple, and obtain'd by only pounding, and pressing them; And that if I wou'd, I shou'd see the Manner they us'd to make it in.</P>
<P>I accepted This offer, and stood by, while his Servant weigh'd out a Parcel of Almonds, and throwing them into a large Mortar, beat them a long Time with a heavy Iron <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estle; I observ'd that the broken Almonds, the finer they were pounded, grew more and more Oily, and stuck better together, till at last they be∣came a clammy Substance between a Powder and a Paste.</P>
<P>The Almonds thus beaten, were put into a thick li∣nen Bag, and placed between two meeting Parts of a strong wooden Press, which were forc'd hard together by the turning of an Iron Skrew; After some small Time the Oil began to drop pretty fast, and continu'd to do so, till the Apothecary had got the Quantity, proper for my Purpose; which having thus seen drawn, I took without any Difficulty, and it was perfectly suc∣cessful.</P>
<P>I went a few Days after, with an <HI>Italian</HI> Fryar, to see the burning Mountain <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>suvius</HI>; The Cave, The Grotto, The Tomb of <HI>Virgil</HI>, and many other Rarities of that celebrated Neighbourhood, And happening one Day to take a By-Road for Expedition, we cross'd a very large Wood, which, as I afterwards observ'd, was al∣most all <HI>Beech</HI>; As we rode along, The Boughs, which were at that Time overloaded with full-ripe Mast, hung low and were exce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding Troublesome, so that I was of∣ten forc'd to bend forward upon my Horse, and to make Use of a strong Stick to guard off the Branches, as we rode close under them:</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/>The Boughs, as we pass'd on, being thus resisted by our Sticks, and the Husks of the Mast open, as they al∣ways are, when their Fruit is ripe, the Kernels, by the Motion of the Branches, fell down upon us as thick as Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l; and when I came out of the Wood, I found abun∣dance of them, which had rested upon my Hat, and which out of a trifling Curiosity, to know what they had within them, or rather merely by Chance, I put carelesly into my Pocket.</P>
<P>But when I had opened and eat several, and found them so unexpectedly sweet and pleasant, I ask'd the Fa∣ther what This Fruit was call'd, and was then first taught to know a Beech-Tree.</P>
<P>The Similitude in Taste between a new Almond, and the Beech-Mast, just fall'n from the Trees, imme∣diately brought to my Remembrance the Oil, which had so lately cur'd my Cold, and the easy manner of making it; surely, thought I, as the Substance and Taste of these two Things are so near alike, their Effects can never be so different, but that the Beech must afford as good an Oil, as the Almond Tree.</P>
<P>I resolv'd, however, to make an Experiment, and took Care in my Return, to get a Quart or two of Beech-Mast, and having hung it a whole Night in a linen Bag, near a small Fire, to dry away That watry Part, which you may observe predominant in Filberds, and Walnuts, till they have been a good while kept; I pounded them in a Mortar, and when they were re∣duc'd with Shell and all to a proper Substance, I got the Apothecary's Press, and went to work the same Way, I had before observ'd him take with the Al∣monds.</P>
<P>I was rather pleas'd than surpriz'd, to find my self so far from being mistaken, that the Oil was more in Quan∣tity
<PB N="$$" REF="35"/>
than had been drawn from an equal Weight of Al∣monds, and the Apothecary not knowing, what it really was, after having several Times tasted it, declar'd that it was the finest Oil of Almonds that ever he saw drawn.</P>
<P>Thus far my natural Curiosity had led me; and here for want of Years, or Judgment, or an early Know∣ledge in the Principles of Trade, I had lost the Advan∣tage of this fortunate and rich Discovery, had not Chance retriev'd it.</P>
<P>I left <HI>Naples</HI> soon after this, and carried the Oil along with me in a little Crystal Bottle, with Design to try, if it wou'd keep long in the warm Countries, I was going into; I preserv'd it above a Year, and all that Time it grew better and better, till at last by frequent changing Places, it was lost I know not how, and with it the very Remembrance of the Accident.</P>
<P>At last, in the Year 1712, some Affairs of no great Consequence calling me into the West of <HI>England</HI>, I re∣turn'd about the Beginning of <HI>September</HI> from <HI>Devonshire</HI>, and taking no direct Road, came along by <HI>Henley</HI> and the woodiest Part of <HI>Maidenhead</HI>-Thicket, where, for 12 or 14 Miles together, a Man can hardly see any other Wood but Beech.</P>
<P>It happen'd, that this very Year, the Beech-Mast grew in greater Plenty, than Ordinary, and as I rode among the Trees, I observ'd that they were almost bow'd to the Ground with their Burthens, and hung just as I had seen them twelve Years before in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI>; The Similitude of the two Objects at once brought back to my Remembrance the Experiment, I had then made, and I was immediately mov'd with Curiosity to try, if the <HI>English</HI> Beech-Nut might not yield an Oil, as sweet as the <HI>Neapolitan</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36"/>At my Return to <HI>London</HI> I made the Experiment; I found it answer the utmost of my Expectations; and having by Enquiries of the Country People, before in∣form'd my self, that there was no Use for this Mast, but that all, which the Hogs left undevour'd, lay rotting on the Ground, and was look'd upon as not worth gather∣ing; I made it my next Business to trace out the Uses of this new Oil.</P>
<P>I found it excellent in all Things, wherein it was try'd; The Perfumers valu'd it beyond the Oils they use, because they said it had a stronger Body; The A∣pothecaries, to a Man, were positive that it was Oil of Almonds, and as good as ever they had tasted; The Clothiers declar'd, that a Pint of This was worth a Quart of such Oil, as they generally make use of, but that so fine an Oil must needs, they said, be sold at too great a Price for their Business.</P>
<P>When I perceiv'd that the Oil was in it self thus excellent, I endeavour'd to find out what demand there might be for Oils in general, by applying my self to the several Dealers in That Commodity, and examining care∣fully the Bills of Entry at the Custom-House; But I was soon convinc'd that the Quantity of Oil consum'd in <HI>England</HI>, was so prodigious, that it was never likely to be glutted.</P>
<P>I had now but one doubt left to satisfy, and that was, whether there was a Quantity of <HI>Mast</HI> in <HI>England</HI> to make a Trade of Beech-Oil, and supply the <HI>Demand</HI>, which I found so general; I knew well enough by the Experiments, I had made, that whatever Quantities of this Oil cou'd be got, wou'd in a Manner cost nothing, but the Charge of procuring Mast, which I found by That, which I had got gather'd, cou'd never come to more in such a Year as That, than Three-pence or a Groat a Bushel; so that it only remain'd to discover,
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
whether Beech-Mast was as common, and as much neg∣lected in other Counties of the Kingdom, as it was in those Parts, which I so lately pass'd through, of <HI>Berk∣shire</HI> and <HI>Oxfordshire</HI>.</P>
<P>To this End I made several Journies on purpose, till I had seen the largest Parts of two and twenty Coun∣ties, in the least of which I plainly found that there was Beech-Mast enough to supply Oil, not to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> only, but all the three Kingdoms three Times over.</P>
<P>Here, I must confess, I began to be amaz'd! Is it possible, thought I, comparing all the foregoing Cir∣cumstances, that such a Discovery as This, is now to be made? I saw it a Reality, and yet cou'd scarce be∣lieve it other than a Dream; so vast and so infallible were the Profits of the Secret found; and so unlikely and improb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble but a Month or two before, shou'd I have thought the Accident.</P>
<P>The only Difficulty now was. How to manage such an Undertaking; The Stock, I found by the most mo∣derate Computation, wou'd amount to a greater Sum than I cou'd raise; And the Arts of Trade I had Reason to believe were best known to People, who had made Trade their Business.</P>
<P>I therefore propos'd the Affair to such Persons, as I thought most likely to listen to the Of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and carry on the Business; I judg'd it prudent to conceal the Parti∣culars, that is, I did not tell them, that I had found out that an Oil might be made of <HI>Beech-Mast</HI>, but I told them, that I cou'd make an Oil in great Quantity from a common Vegetable of <HI>British</HI> Growth, which wou'd be as good, or better for all Uses, than the <HI>Se∣ville</HI>, or <HI>Gallipoli</HI> Oils, and yet not cost a fourth Part of the Rates, which those Oils went at; that I was ready to let them into a large Proportion of the Pro∣fits,
<PB N="$$" REF="38"/>
if they wou'd raise a proper Stock, and that if they wou'd secure my Interest, by entering first into a conditional Covenant, I wou'd make them Masters of the Secret, and give them full Experience and Demon∣stration of the Fact, in whatever Manner, they shou'd think most satisfactory.</P>
<P>'Till now I was a Stranger to the Tempers of Man∣kind, and expected to have heard Reason oppos'd against Reason, and that I shou'd have been undeceiv'd my self, or have convinc'd others, by a natural Consequence of Argument and Demonstration; But I was ignorant it seems, and did not know the World; Whim, Project, Impossibility, Diving, Linen-Manufacture, Salt-Petre, Mine-Adventure, were the only Arguments I met with, and in whatever Corner of the City I proposed the Undertaking, instead of the Civility due to a Man, whose Business was to make their Fortunes, I cou'd scarce have met with colder Treatment, had I come to borrow Mo∣ney of them.</P>
<P>By this Time I discover'd plainly, that I was going the wrong Way to work; That Peoples invincible Aver∣sion to the word <HI>Project</HI>, wou'd never suffer them to believe me, till I cou'd speak what I had to say plainly, and it was dangerous to do That, till I had secur'd a Property in the Exercise of the Invention, by Vertue of a Patent from the Crown; which Kind of Patent, an Act of Parliament of the 21st of King <HI>James</HI> the First, has made valid, and lawful, against all Opposition for fourteen Years.</P>
<P>I then apply'd my self to her late Majesty of Blessed Memory, in Council, and on the 23d Day of <HI>October</HI> 1713, Her said Majesty was graciously pleased to grant me Her Royal Letters Patents in the following Manner.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
<HEAD>An Abstract of the First <HI>Proposals</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>'THAT Subscriptions should be taken for a Stock 'of Twenty thousand Pounds.</P>
<P><Q>“That a Fourth should be paid down, and the rest at <HI>Michaelmas</HI>, 1714. under Forfeiture of the First Pay∣”ment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“That every Subscriber should receive by Two equal half-yearly Payments, at <HI>Lady-day</HI> and <HI>Michaelmas</HI>, an Annuity, to commence at <HI>Lady-day</HI>, 1715. amounting to 50 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> upon whatever Sum they subscrib'd, and to continue during the whole Term of the Letters-”Patents.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“That on every Midsummer-day there should be Nine Directors chosen by Majority of Voices, to assist the Patentee with their Advice upon Occasion, and receive Complaints, upon Default of Payment to any of the Subscribers: In which Case, if upon Notice given, the Patentee should fail to do the Justice required, the Nine Directors had Power to meet and chuse a Governor from among themselves, who should by Vertue of that Choice exclude the Patentee, and proceed, with Ad∣vice of the other Eight Directors, in the Exercise of all Power granted by the Patent, for the joint Advantage of the Subscribers in Proportion to their several In∣”terests.</Q></P>
<P>This Offer met with the Success expected; People snatch'd the Opportunity, and the Twenty thousand Pounds were not only immediately subscrib'd, but above ten times the Money offer'd me in vain, after the Sub∣scription was compleat, and it was too late to take it.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>But being daily press'd to take in more Subscriptions, though upon a shorter and a smaller Interest, and finding by the growing Accounts of the great Demand for Oil, that I could very well employ a larger Stock, I resolved to accept of a Hundred thousand Pounds more, upon a different Bottom, and accordingly published the Proposals following.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>An Abstract of the Second <HI>Proposals</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>'THAT a Subscription should be taken for One 'hundred thousand Pounds.</P>
<P><Q>“That a tenth Part of every subscrib'd Sum should be paid down for the Use of the Patentee, and the other nine Parts be subject only to the Call and Disposal of ”Thirteen Directors of their own chusing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“That the Patentee should provide Granaries, into which the Directors should put Store-keepers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to receive and pay for whatever Beech-Mast the Patentee should send in, at any Price not exceeding one Shilling <HI>per</HI> Bushel, which Mast they were to re-deliver to the Order of the Patentee, upon Payment of a double Price <HI>per</HI> Bushel to what they paid for it; by which Means the Subscribers, who were bound to quarterly Dividends, would receive back in Parts their Principal and Interest together, and in Two Years Time make a ”Profit of <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI> on their Subscriptions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“That the Patentee might be obliged to take all the Mast off their Hands at such Rate, within the Two Years limited, Power was given to the Directors, upon Default, to enter on his Works, and without Rent, Re∣ward or Consideration, occupy the same till they had made Oil of all the Beech-Mast in their Hands, and
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
sold it for their own and the Subscribers Benefit, by which Means their Profit had been many times over and above what was proposed, and to entitle them to which, they were only to pay to the old Annuity-Subscribers such Parts of their Annuities as became due, while they ”should carry on the Business.</Q></P>
<P>The Books were open but a very few Days before this second Sum was also subscrib'd; and now the Stock which I had to work with, amounted to a Hundred and twenty thousand Pounds, and the Persons concern'd in the Two Subscriptions, though they both depended on the same general Bottom, had each a several differing Security, and their Interests no way clash'd with one another.</P>
<P>My Business now was, how to set this great Machine a moving in the properest Manner; and in pursuance of that Design, I thought it best to inform my self, whether I might be sure of Granaries and Ware-house-room enough in or about <HI>London</HI> for so large a Quantity of Mast as I might be obliged to lay up; and after a very short Search and Enquiry, I became convinc'd, that up∣on a Day's Warning, I might have Store-room enough for as many Millions of Bushels as I could be furnished with.</P>
<P>I will instance only in one Proof, and demonstrate it by the following Estimate, which is an Account of one Place only.</P>

<P><PB N="47" REF="46"/>It was my next Care to provide a proper Work-House, for making so much of the Oil as wou'd supply the De∣mand of <HI>London</HI> and its Neighbourhood, which is so great, that the Soap-makers only within the Bills of Mor∣tality, consume above seven thousand Tons of Oil in one Year; It was long before I cou'd find a Place compleat∣ly fit for this Business; At last I succeeded, and took a Lease of the long Brick Building at <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI>, which is commonly call'd the <HI>Gun-House</HI>, and which is the most convenient Place in the World for such a Design, as it lies full upon the Water, that Barges from <HI>Berkshire, Buckingham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hire</HI>, and <HI>Oxfordshire</HI>, coming down the Ri∣ver, may lie close up to the Wall, and crane out the Mast into any Part of the Lofts, or the Work-House; And the Oil may by Means of such leathern Pipes, as the Brewers Men convey their Drink by into Ale-House-Cellars, be fill'd into Vessels, as they lie in the Barges, directly from the Cisterns, without the least Trouble of Landing and re-loading the Caskage:</P>
<P>Being thus secure of a Work-House, and store-Room enough, my next Care was, by what Method to proceed in making the Oil:</P>
<P>In order to inform my self in this particular, I visited the Rape-Mills, and all other Places, where Oils of any Sort are made by Expression, and dislik'd them all; The Way of Grinding down the Seed in the Mills, is by the circular Motion of a turning Grindstone, set Edgeways upon another, which lies flat, which Grindstone, by passing so often and so swiftly over the Seed, I found to heat it so much in the Crushing, that it occasion'd an extraordinary Rankness in the Oil; And That Rankness is encreas'd by another Method they have of heating the broken Seed in an Iron Pan, before they press it.</P>
<P>The Oil is then press'd out by the Force of great wooden Beams, which being hung perpendicular, and
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
lifted up to certain Heights by the Motion of a Water∣wheel, fall down with a smart Stroke, and squeeze out the Oil from a Bag, which is plac'd between two Wedges in a close Press, from whence the Oil drops down into a Copper Receiver.</P>
<P>'Tis worth your while, if you have never seen a Rape-Mill, to be curious enough to do it; You will then be presently convinc'd, by observing how much Oil the Rape-Seed yields, that 'tis no wonder there shou'd be as much in the Beech-Mast; which, upon the Comparison, Every Body will presently perceive to be the Heaviest, and most Oily of the two Seeds, and in Proportion not near so husky. There are many Rape-Mills about <HI>London</HI>; Particularly one at <HI>Wandsworth</HI>, ano∣ther at <HI>Rotherhith</HI>, and a Third upon the Bank between <HI>West-Ham</HI> and <HI>Bromley</HI>.</P>
<P>To remedy the Defects, I observ'd in these Mills, and avoid their Inconveniencies of frequent Repair, and often standing still by too much Water, or too little, I resolv'd upon a new Engine, capable of doing infinitely more work than the Mills, at a Quarter of their Expence both in Time and Money.</P>
<P>I caus'd one of These to be set up at <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI>, where it now stands, which is easily manag'd by one Man's Labour, and will at least make more Oil, than the best Mill in <HI>England</HI> can pretend to, with the Charge of great Rents, Repairs, and 3 or 4 Men to ma∣nage it.</P>
<P>I had gone on to have improv'd this Engine, and en∣larg'd it, as also to erect a great many more in the same Place, make Cisterns, and finish all Things necessary, which is not the Work of above six Weeks at longest, but I found it needless, for the Reasons, I shall by and by ac∣quaint you with.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48"/>I tire you perhaps with this tedious Account of Parti∣culars, but I entreat you to have Patience; It will lead you gradually from one Proof to another, till you find your self fully convinc'd of the Greatness of this Disco∣very, and inspir'd with a just and generous Indignation against the Malice and Folly of such unthinking Men, who have endeavour'd to oppress it.</P>
<P>Having now prepar'd, and made sure, whatever was fit to be first done; I made it my next Care to become a perfect Master of all Things necessary to be known, both at Home and Abroad, in order to the proper Manage∣ment of the Affair in General.</P>
<P>I chose with the best Discretion I was Master of, and dispatch'd Agents on Purpose into most Parts of <HI>Europe</HI>, procur'd Recommendatory Letters, and held as extended a Correspondence as possible, for Information concerning the Quantities and Rates of Beech-Mast from beyond Sea; The Effect of These Endeavours you shall presently see, in as full a Manner as possible.</P>
<P>I consider'd that the Counties, wherein the Woollen Manufactures are establish'd, wou'd consume the greatest Quantities of Beech-Oil; and that therefore it wou'd be very useful to send into those Counties, and procure a certain Information from the Dealers themselves, what Quantities of Oil I might expect to sell, and prepare to make it in Proportion to the Demand; For by the Con∣tradictory Accounts, I receiv'd from Merchants, and Tradesmen, of whom no Two were ever in one Story, I perceiv'd there cou'd be no Dependance on their Re∣ports of Oil imported: And the Bills of Entry cou'd only inform me, How much Oil was brought to <HI>London</HI>, which is nothing to the whole Kingdom's Consumption, because the woollen Manufacture, which consumes most Oil, is least establish'd in the Neighbourhood of that City.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49"/>Again, I thought it necessary to send Samples of this Beech-Oil among the Dealers, that by making Trials in their several Ways, they might all experimentally become acquainted with its Virtues.</P>
<P>In Pursuance of This Resolution I sent down able Agents, Men vers'd in the Nature, and the Forms of Business, into all such Parts of <HI>England</HI>, as I judg'd most worth my while to correspond with; Every Man had his particular Road appointed him, and was to act and govern himself by stated Rules; An Example of which I here give you in the Copy of one of their In∣structions.</P>

<HEAD>Instructions for Mr. <HI>Jacob Westley,</HI> in order to obtain proper Information, for establishing a Staple of Beech-Oil, for the Supply of the Clothing Trade in the County of <HI>Worcester</HI>.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><Q>“1. YOU must consider what Road it will be best to take for compleating your Tour, so as not to miss either Town, Village, or Parish, which is in ”any Degree considerable for the Clothing Trade.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>“II. As you come to any of these Places, you may proceed by what Means you think best, to discourse with the Combers, or other Consumers of Oil; which may be done by sending for, or going to them, singly; Or by giving publick Notice, and appointing a Time ”for Them all to meet you at your Inn.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="51" REF="50"/>
<Q>“III. The first Thing you are to do, is to convince them by what Authority you Act, and that you are the only Person lawfully qualify'd to treat with them upon ”this Subject.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><Q>“IV. You must fully represent the prodigious Advan∣tage, which will arise to the Clothing Trade in Ge∣neral, and to their Town in particular by This new Discovery. That they will from this Time forward, be supply'd with much better Oil, than ever they had before: Then shew them Samples of the Beech-Oil, which you are to take with you, and supply your self afresh by Quantities sent before, and lodg'd at proper Distances against your Coming: Let them make Expe∣rience of this Oil, and try it with their Wool, or what other Way they please; and inform them, That in the gathering of Mast, and making of this Oil, many thou∣sands of poor People will be employ'd: That, in Order to make it as great a Benefit as possible to the woollen Manufacture, The Patentee will always sell them Beech-Oil much cheaper, than the Price they now give for <HI>Se∣ville</HI>, or <HI>Gallipoli</HI> Oils, which are far worse, as they will find by their Trials; Then tell them, where the general Staple for the County will be fix'd, and take down their Names, and Places of Abode, as also the Quanti∣ty of Oil, which each Man commonly uses, one Year with another, and the exact Price, they now pay for Oil, as also what they have paid, when at the highest, ”and the lowest Rates.</Q></P>
<P N="5"><Q>“V. As you pass from Place to Place, inform your self what other Uses there are for Oil, and find out the Men and talk with them severally, and take an Ac∣count of their Names, Place of Abode, Quantity and ”Price of the Oil they consume.</Q></P>
<P N="6"><Q>“VI. All these Accounts you must exactly enter in a Book for that Purpose, and send them me up Weekly

in a Post-Letter, as also whatever other Informations ”you meet with for the Advantage of the Undertaking.</Q></P>
<P>The Care and Diligence of these Agents succeeded so well, that I had long ago a List of Dealers in Oil, and their Orders to send down above two and twenty thousand Tons of Beech-Oil, to ready-Money Custo∣mers, at 40 <HI>l.</HI> a Ton, which amounts to almost a Mil∣lion of Money Sterling in one Years Time, by Means of a Discovery, which People are all the while making merry with, and looking upon, as a Project, and an emp∣ty Notion.</P>
<P>This will I know be strange News to many honest Gentlemen, who judge of publick Consumption by their own private Dealings; But I am not here affirming Things upon Imagination, but Experience, and unde∣niable Demonstration; I have the Names, Places of Abode, and Quantity consum'd yearly, of almost every noted Dealer in Oil in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>I desire you to believe nothing but what you see prov'd; 'Twou'd require a Volume to insert here the whole Account; I will therefore only make Use of the Northern Consumption, because in That Part of the Kingdom every Body knows, that the Demand for Oil bears no Proportion to That of other Places.</P>
<P>The following Letters from my Northern Agent, as he made his Journey, will shew you a Consumption of above Two Thousand Tons a Year, in a Corner of the Land, where very few Merchants think there is any Oil us'd at all; and which I therefore chuse to give you as an Example.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>“IT is now high Time to give you an Account of my Travels to This Place; where the Concern I was under, when I left the good Family I was before en∣gaged in, was alleviated by the kind Reception of your new Agent and Undertaking. All the eminent Merchants both at <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Leeds</HI>, have an entire good Opinion of its Success, and have promis'd to pro∣mote it; tho' I think it will not need their Assistance; Your Letter to Mr. Mayor of <HI>Leeds</HI> was very kindly receiv'd; He promis'd he wou'd write to you; and has already given me just Proofs of his good Intentions, by acquainting, and explaining to the Aldermen, Mer∣chants, Clothiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Profit and Usefulness of the Invention; At the Market, which is every Tuesday and Saturday, Mr. Mayor in Person recommended your Oil to the Dealers in that Commodity You are much oblig'd to Him, Alderman <HI>Ascough</HI>, and indeed the whole Town, for their Extraordinary Civility; All the Oil-Men will take Quantities, and pay ready Money: The Consumption of Oil in the two Towns of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Leeds</HI> only, amounts to upwards of a thousand Ton a Year; But if you can send them four or five hundred Tons, it may stop their Mouths for a while; Rape-seed Oil is now at two Shillings and Eight-pence a Gallon, and has been at three Shillings and Ten-pence; <HI>Seville</HI> Oil, which has been at six Shillings, is now at four Shillings and Four-pence; I am sure, when yours comes, They will use none else; The Growers of Rape look amaz'd; And the Drawers of Oil, will shortly put their Mill-Sails into deep Mourn∣”ing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Please to replenish my Stock of Beech-Oil; I shou'd I think have had a Hogshead set in the Middle of the Market, with two or three hundred Spoons for the Country Clothiers to taste with; They have try'd and

lick'd away my little Cargo; But I may say This to my Comfort, that I have never yet met one Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ”who pretended to dislike it; I conclude,</Q></P>

<P><Q>“I Staid a whole Week in <HI>York</HI>, and found it the properest Time in the World to propagate your Affair. I had every Day Occasion to expose your Oil to the best Judges in the North. Mr. <HI>Bell</HI>, the Chymist, has by a full Experiment found yours to excel any Oil, that can be used for the Woollen Manufacture. It continues to please every Dealer; insomuch that no Body will lay

up Quantities for longer than the Time, when they ex∣”pect yours to be ready.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Consumption of Oil to this Place amounts to Eighteen hundred and eighty seven Tons and two Hogsheads, in the Hands of substantial and ready-money Customers, who will pay upon Delivery. I hope to finish my Jour∣”ney in a few Weeks more; and am,</Q></P>

<P>I take up too much Room, and am forced to break off without inserting the remaining Accounts, which make the total Amount of even this Northern Circuit above two Thousand Tons of Oil <HI>per Annum</HI>.</P>

<P><Q>“I Have since my last had Opportunity of meeting at one Time a whole knot of Woolcombers, and I find they are all overjoy'd at so good an Oil; the Want of sweet Oil having always been a great Damage to their ”Business.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They are all of one Mind; and all, who try your Beech-Oil, as most of them do before they speak their Mind, assure me, that they never saw so good, and so fat ”an Oil, as this is.</Q></P>

<Q>“I am sure, that if I had a Thousand Tons, I could sell ”it all just now here in <HI>Cornwall</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I send you the Particulars hitherto, and shall continue to do so as I go on. But I find that in general every Workman, who combs Wool for Serge, uses one with ”another a Hogshead in a Year.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have already, as you will see, taken an Account of more than Four thousand such Workmen in this Part of the County; so that That amounts to a Thousand Tons of Oil a Year; which, if you remember, was more than ”you thought us'd in <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Devonshire</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Price now given is four Shillings and ten Pence the Gallon. It has been bought for three Shillings ”twenty Years ago. I shall next Week, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I am,</Q></P>

<P><Q>“The exactest general Information I can now send you is, that I have an Account of Forty Thousand Wool-workers, who, allowing them but to use a Barrel a-piece, which is far short, as you have seen by the Particulars, of what they really do consume, require a Supply of

<P><Q>“I AM at last got home; and with the more Satisfa∣ction to my self, because you seem pleased with my ”Endeavours for your Service.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I enclose the compleat Account; and have nothing to add, but that the Clothiers every where complain, that the Merchants, of late Years, have not been able to sup∣ply them with Oil sufficient for their Occasions; and that their Goods have not been so well wrought, as they had been, had they had Plenty of good Oil to work their Wooll with; so that they will use even more than the Account mentions, when they find they can have it ”so easily.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I will observe your Orders as to the Beech-Mast: But the Blite has made it so much more troublesom to get it good, than it is in other Years, that I much fear I shall

<P>By this Time you are, I hope, convinc'd, that the Beech-Oil can never want a Market; and it only remains to demonstrate, that it is as much impossible for the Mar∣ket to want Beech-Oil.</P>
<P>But now to return to the Thread of my Design, when I perceiv'd by the Accounts my Agents sent me from eve∣ry Part of the Kingdom, what prodigious Quantities of Oil might be dispos'd of; how much the Dealers preferr'd Beech-Oil to any other; and that the Commodity would at all Times command ready Money, and might pick and chuse its Customers, I thought it high Time to take care of the Beech-Mast.</P>
<P>I was willing to obtain as particular Accounts, as to a Supply of Mast, as I had received of the Demand for Oil; and therefore, being resolv'd to spare no Cost or Labour, I dispatch'd at one time new Agents into Six and thirty Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, out of the Two and fifty, besides those sent into foreign Parts before.</P>
<P>Their Business you will best comprehend by the follow∣ing Instructions.</P>

<HEAD>Instructions for Mr. <HI>William Cross,</HI> in a Journey for Procuration of <HI>Beech-Mast,</HI> through the Counties of <HI>Dorset, Somerset,</HI> and <HI>Wilts</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>'YOU begin your Journey from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>'Cran∣burn</HI>.</P>
<P><Q>“At <HI>Cranburn</HI> begin your Enquiries, not only from Gentlemen with whom you are acquainted, or to whom you can procure recommendatory Letters, but also from all Inn-keepers, Travellers, Country-men, or others, in∣”to whose Company you shall accidentally fall.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Whatever Answers you receive to any Questions, or whatever Bargains you make, or Informations you get, in relation to the Affair you go about, you must enter as particularly as possible in a Paper-Book, by way of Journal, with an Account of the Place where, the Time when, the Persons who, and all other Circum∣”stances daily occurring.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Questions to be ask'd are such as these: What Quantity of Beech grows thereabouts? To whom it belongs? And whether they know of any People who have ever gather'd Beech-Mast? How much clear from the Husk they have been able to gather from one Tree? How many Bushels one Person's Labour could procure in one Day? What Wages they expect <HI>per</HI> Day in those Parts? And what Method in gathering the Mast they ”generally make use of?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="67"/>
<Q>“When you have ask'd all these Questions, and re∣ceived and set down their several Answers, you must deliver to the Person or Persons, three, six, or more, as they think fit, of the Printed Bills, and desire that if they should accidentally meet with any Gentlemen who own Mast, or Farmers, or poor People who would gather it, and have heard nothing of these Bills, that they would tell them all the Particulars, and give them Directions where to send Notice of any Quantity of Mast they shall get, and encourage them as much as they can, to gather all they are able to find, and to use the Method of ga∣”thering which is set down in the printed Bills.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“If you meet with any Gentlemen who have Parks or Woods of their own, full of Mast, but do not care for the Trouble of gathering it at their own Charge, you may let them know, that if they will suffer poor People to gather their Mast without Interrupt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and order a Servant to take Account of what Quantity is gather'd, and in whose Hands it lies, you will call at their House some Time in <HI>October</HI>, and pay them down two Pence a Bushel for all the Mast which has been gather'd from their Trees, and which their above-named Servant shall go with you, and help you to, from the Country-People ”who gather'd it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But endeavour, if possible, to perswade the Country-Gentlemen themselves to employ the poor People, and gather their own Mast: And in order thereto, make them sensible how great a Benefit they will do in their Neigh∣bourhood; and that if they take the Method of gather∣ing described in the B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, by spreading Things under the Boughs, and shaking the Branches with a Hook upon the Pole, they cannot fall at the Price proposed, to get at least half clear Profit. To this End, perswade them on∣ly to try one Day, when their Mast is full ripe, and by comparing the Quantity which shall be gather'd that Day, with the Wages which they pay to the Gatherers, they
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
will presently be at a Certainty for a trifling Charge, and ”may go on, or not, as they find it will answer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Wherever you see any straggling Beech-Trees full of Mast, on or near the High-way, or elsewhere, though never so few, you may call at the next Cottage, or poor Man's House you come to, and engage him to gather it when it is ripe, as the Bills will instruct him, and to keep it where it may lie dry; and let him know that you will be with him some Time in <HI>October</HI>, to see what Quantity he has got, and pay him the propos'd Price for every Bushel, that is clean and free from Leaves, Husks, Sticks, or other Foulness: And Before you leave him, set down his Name, and Place of Abode, that you may not for∣get how to find him, and leave with him some Bills to disperse among such of his Acquaintance who know of any Mast, and shall be willing to gather it upon the same Terms; desiring him, if he finds any such, to tell you when you come next, who they are, and where they live, that you may call and pay them for the Mast ”they shall have gather'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“In this Manner you must go on from <HI>Cranburn</HI> to <HI>Cran∣burn</HI>-Chase, <HI>Holt</HI>-Forest, and so if you hear of more Mast towards the Sea to the Left; Then up to the Right again to <HI>Gillingham</HI>-Forest by <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>, thence to <HI>Blandford, Middleton, Cerne-Abby</HI>, and farther Westward, as far in <HI>Dorsetshire</HI>, as you can hear of Beech-Woods, or Parks, that have much Beech in them; Then turn up into <HI>Somersetshire</HI>, and Edge along upon the Border, going no further into the County, than you can be in∣form'd of any Store of Beeches, and so come into <HI>Wilt∣shire</HI> by the Way of <HI>Bath</HI>; From the <HI>Bath</HI> to <HI>Blackmore</HI>-Forest, <HI>Crookwood, Pewsham</HI>-Forest, so up to <HI>Bradon</HI>-Forest; from thence to <HI>Auborne</HI>-Chace, <HI>Savernake</HI>-Fo∣rest, and so away to <HI>Chute</HI>-Forest, where your Business will End, and from thence you must make the best of your Way to <HI>London</HI>, without farther Enquiries; Besides the particular Places here mention'd, you must endea∣vour
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
within the said Counties to get what Information you can of all Parks, Woods, or other Forests, where any Quantity of Beech-Trees grow, still cros<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing as you pass from Right and Left, as your Intelligence directs you, constantly setting down in your Journal, what Places and Persons you go to, what you hear, and what you meet ”with.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“For the more commodious Distribution of your Printed Bills, it will be proper to send by the Carriers before you leave <HI>London</HI>, little Parcels of a Thousand a Piece, directed for your self to be left at the Ware-houses, till call'd for, at these following Places, <HI>Blandford</HI>, the ”<HI>Bath</HI> and the <HI>Devises</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“By this Means you may call for your Bills, as you want them, and never trouble your self at once with too great ”a Quantity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Endeavour, where-ever you come, to make the Inn∣keepers sensible, how great an Advantage it wou'd be, if they hir'd poor People, at so much a Day, and laid up all the Mast in their upper Rooms, till <HI>October</HI>, ”when you will come back again to take it from them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“When all this is done, which must be perform'd with as little Delay as possible, you must return to <HI>London</HI>, and receive Bills to go the same Course over again, to pay for all the Mast, which shall be gather'd, and dis∣pose of it according to such further Instructions, as will ”then be ready for you.</Q></P>
<P>What the Consequence of these Gentlemens Journeys was, you shall see by one of their Journals, and a few of their Letters, which are all I can allow Room for.</P>

<P><Q>“Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> inform'd me, that generally there is a vast Quantity of Beech-Mast in this Park, and that the Peo∣ple thereabouts give Money to my Lord's Servants, to have the Liberty of turning in their Hogs at the Season, ”when the Mast falls.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“He also offer'd me Room to store large Quantities of Mast; Hereabouts the Labourers at this Time of the Year think Twelve-pence or Ten-pence a Day good Wages; But I cou'd not hear by all my Enquiries, that any Body had ever thought the Beech-Mast worth ga∣thering, or carrying Home, as knowing no use that it ”was fit for.</Q></P>

Steward, Mr. <HI>Call</HI>, not being at home, I rode on to <HI>Surrenden</HI>, to view Sir <HI>Cholmondeley Deering</HI>'s, but the Steward not being in the Way at that Place neither, I cou'd observe nothing more, than that there were great Numbers of huge Beech-Trees in this Part of the Country; And that, tho' many of them bore no Mast this Year, nor the last, as the Country-People inform'd me, yet there lay under every Tree, Bushels upon Bushels of old Husks, half rotten, which had fall'n in the Year 1712, which was a great Year for ”Beech-Mast.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“On the Eighth of <HI>September</HI>, being inform'd that there was much Beech about <HI>Barrum-Downs</HI>, I re∣solv'd to see it; But calling at Sir <HI>Henry Oxenden</HI>'s at <HI>Dean</HI>, I had the Misfortune to fall ill of a violent Fe∣ver, which held me till the 25th, during which Time, Sir <HI>Henry</HI> sent his Steward to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llinge</HI>, near <HI>Rumney-Marsh</HI>; and to <HI>Denton</HI> near <HI>Barrum-Downs</HI>; where at his Return, he inform'd me, that he found a pretty Deal of Beech, but that it bore little or no Mast; and that contrary to the Nature of other Beech-Trees, there was much Under-wood amongst the great Growth, which wou'd make it a difficult Matter to spread ”Cloths, or gather the Mast without them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>September</HI> the 25th, I went with Sir <HI>Henry Oxenden</HI>'s Recommendations to <HI>Eastwell</HI>, concerning my Lord <HI>Winchelsea</HI>'s Park; My Lord was not willing to part with his Mast This Year, because he had but a little, and hardly enough for his Deer, because other Fodder was scarce, but next Year his Lordship expected large Quantities, and shou'd be ready to treat about it; I rode about the Park, which I take to be seven or eight Miles in Circuit; It is very full of Beech-Trees, hard∣ly any other Wood in it, most of them are prodigious large; I met with very few, that had any Mast upon them, and Those, which had any, did not bear so thick, as they do in a good Year; They had about
<PB N="74" REF="73" MS="y"/>
twenty Bushels upon a Tree, or very little more, and a great Deal of light Mast among it; The Country Peo∣ple told me, that in such a Year as That before the last, there was Mast enough in this Park, to load a Fleet of <HI>New-Castle</HI> Colliers; and that the Trees are budded in so promising a Manner against next Year, that they never saw the like, and that they always ob∣serve, that every third Year the Mast never fails to ”grow in great Plenty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“From <HI>Eastwell</HI> I went to <HI>Surrenden</HI>, and met with the Steward, who shew'd me Sir <HI>Cholmondeley Deering</HI>'s Park, where I saw a great many large Beech-Trees, many of which were pretty full of tolerable good Mast, which the Steward promis'd to have gather'd, and sent up as <HI>per</HI> Directions; They inform'd me here, as in∣deed in all other Places, that in a good Year, which is always every Third, the Mast does not grow, as it does this Year, upon one Tree in ten or twenty; But that every Tree is loaded with Mast as thick as it can hang, and the Mast all Plump and full of Kernel without any light Husks, or Worm-eaten Nuts amongst it; I enquir'd for the Wood call'd Long-Beech, but Mr. <HI>Colliton</HI>, the Steward at <HI>Surrenden</HI> inform'd me, ”that it was cut down.</Q></P>
<P>'<HI>September</HI> the 26th was <HI>Sunday</HI>.</P>
<P><Q>“<HI>September</HI> the 27th, I view'd a Wood of Sir <HI>George Tutes</HI>, near <HI>Bulls-Green</HI>, but cou'd find no Mast; In all these Parts I cou'd never meet with any Body, who had ever thought the Beech-Mast worth gathering, tho' they all agreed, that in such a Year as 1712 was, and as next Year is expected to be, one Man's Labour might in one Day fill as many Sacks, as a Horse cou'd carry; Eight-pence or Ten-pence a Day is good Wages ”here at this Time of the Year</Q></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="74" MS="y"/>
<Q>“<HI>September</HI> the 28th, I went to <HI>Tunbridge</HI>, and from thence to <HI>Eridge</HI>, where I saw a great Quantity of Beech in my Lord <HI>Abergavenny</HI>'s Park; One Mr. <HI>Boakes</HI>, the Tenant inform'd me, that he wonder'd any Body shou'd think it worth his while to offer Money for such a common Thing as Beech-Mast, which cou'd cer∣tainly be good for nothing but Hogs-meat; That Fern, or Grass was not more plentiful than this Mast in a bearing Year, But that there was very little to be got ”this Season.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“From <HI>Eridge</HI> I rode through several Farmers Grounds, who have nothing but Beech-Trees in all their Enclosures, and the Ground every where so smooth under them, that it wou'd be the easiest Thing in the World to mow away the Grass, and then after beating down the Mast with Poles, it might be swept together with stubbed Brooms and gather'd in pro∣”digious Quantities, without any manner of Trouble.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I rode afterwards through several great Beech-Woods, belonging to Mr. <HI>Packer</HI> and other Gentlemen; But it wou'd be an endless Task, so much as to Name all Places, where I find great Numbers of fine ”Beeches.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>September</HI> the 29th, I had the Misfortune to lame my Horse, and was forc'd to go back to <HI>Bayhall</HI> for ”another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>September</HI> the 30th, I travers'd <HI>Waterdown</HI>-Forest, where great Numbers of Beeches bear little or no Mast this Season, what there was, the Country People en∣”gag'd to gather for me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I went thence to Sir <HI>George Rivers</HI>'s Park at <HI>Chef∣ford</HI>, and found Beech enough, but it bore very indif∣”ferently.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75" MS="y"/>
<Q>“From <HI>Chefford</HI>, I rode to my Lord of <HI>Leicester</HI>'s at <HI>Penshurst</HI>; The Steward and Keeper were gone abroad to keep Courts, and their Coming home was uncertain, my Lord's Park bears little Mast this Year, but I was inform'd by several of my Lord's Servants, Mr. <HI>Marshal</HI> at the <HI>Porcupine</HI>, where I inn'd, and one Doct. <HI>Hailer</HI>, who had liv'd twenty Years in this Country, that, tho' the Parks and Woods were cover'd every third Year with Beech-Mast, up to the Ancles, yet they never remember'd, that any Body had thought it worth picking up, but Hogs were suffer'd to eat it up, and tread it in, as a Thing of no Value: They cou'd give me no great Hopes this Year, but what cou'd be done ”they promis'd me to take Care of.</Q></P>
<P>'From <HI>Penshurst</HI> I went to <HI>Cowden</HI>, and got several 'useful Informations from Mr. <HI>Cary</HI> at the <HI>Swan</HI> there.</P>
<P>'From <HI>Cowden</HI> I rode to <HI>Stoneland</HI> Park, there I 'saw many stately Beeches, but no Mast this Season.</P>
<P><Q>“I went on to <HI>East-Grinsted</HI>, and enquir'd all I cou'd from my Landlord, Mr. <HI>Budging</HI>, at the Crown ”there.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“On the first of <HI>October</HI> I went to <HI>Ashdown</HI>-Forest, where I took all possible Care to have the Mast ga∣ther'd for me, and found a pretty Deal here and there, ”in several Parts of the Forest:</Q></P>
<P><Q>“This Forest is of it self sufficient, if there was no other Beech-Wood in the Kingdom, to afford Mast, that will make Oil for the whole World in any one ”bearing Season</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It belongs to the Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI>, is about seven Miles long, and five Miles broad, and generally com∣puted
<PB N="77" REF="76" MS="y"/>
to contain near fourteen thousand Acres of Beech-”wood.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I spoke with the Warrenners; whose Names are, <HI>Daniel Hubourn, Henry Mitchel, Robert Polly, James Hutton</HI>, and <HI>Richard Watson</HI>; These have All, prodi∣gious Tolls of Beech in their several Limitations, And they told me, that this Time two Years the whole Fo∣rest was so thick with Mast, that they hung like Hops, and bore the Branches down to the very Ground; And when they fell, they lay so thick, that they were forc'd in several Places, to shovel them out of their foot-Paths; They said, that every third Year is such a bearing Year, and that by the early, thick, and most prodigious Budding of the Trees, the next Season must be the greatest, and most plentiful for ”Beech-Mast that ever was heard of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They never knew any gather'd, but the Hogs are us'd to feed on the Mast, as it lies, till the Winter-wea∣”ther rots it, and makes it bitter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>Thomas Baker</HI> at the <HI>Red-Cross</HI> at <HI>Which-Cross</HI>, upon this Forest, told me, that he had observ'd the Beech-Mast hang upon the Trees, till <HI>Christmas</HI>, and that a Month or six Weeks hence is the best Time for gather∣ing it; For the longer the Mast hangs, the fuller and ”sweeter the Kernel grows:</Q></P>
<P>'Poor People hereabouts, at This Time of the Year, 'will work for Six-pence or Eight-pence a Day.</P>
<P><Q>“I met with one <HI>Thomas Ranger</HI> upon this Forest, who told me that he had come above a hundred Miles, through almost nothing but Beech-Wood, and that he had observ'd, the Mast was every where very scarce ”this Year.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="77" MS="y"/>
<Q>“The Warreners inform'd me, that the Wood-Pid∣geons feed much upon Beech-Mast, and that in a bear∣ing Season, you shall see a Hundred of them at a Time ”upon one Tree.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>October</HI> the second I left <HI>Ashdown</HI>-Forest, and in my way to <HI>Turner</HI>'s <HI>Hill</HI>, I travell'd through prodigious Woods of Beech; and the Country People with whom I dealt were every where delighted beyond Measure with the Account, I gave them of this new Disco∣”very.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Many Gentlemen I found were wise enough to take the Hint, and have already begun to plant Beech, where they have none; and to thin their Woods, where by reason of their growing too close, they are observ'd to bear less, than the Trees which stand at ”large.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“From <HI>Turner</HI>'s <HI>Hill</HI> to Mr. <HI>Pain</HI>'s at <HI>Hoadly</HI>, and from thence to Mr. <HI>Lyddal</HI>'s at <HI>Wakehurst</HI>, I cou'd hard∣ly see any Thing but Beech; Mr. <HI>Jackson</HI> at Mr. <HI>Lyd∣dal</HI>'s inform'd me, that all those Woods afford such vast Quantities of Mast in a good Year, as he says next will be, that the Farmers think it worth their While, to give seven or eight Shillings for the running of one ”Hog.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I call'd at all the Villages, I came near, and made as many Bargains as I cou'd; 'Tis impossible to express ”how pleas'd the People are with the Business:</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I cross'd the Country from <HI>Wakehurst</HI> to <HI>Balc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI>-Forest; The Warreners here, are <HI>Richard Peters</HI>, and <HI>James Gibbs</HI>; They told me that the Forest will bear well next Year, and that it never does so but once in ”three Years.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="78" MS="y"/>
<Q>“I learnt from them, that there is a Sort of Beech, call'd Black Beech; some call it Hound-Beech, that ”never bears at all.</Q></P>
<P>'I went on to <HI>Tilgate</HI>-Forest, where I met with much 'the same Success and Informations.</P>
<P>'All This while I cou'd, in a manner, come near no 'Wood but Beech; I went on to <HI>Hand-Cross</HI>.</P>
<P>'<HI>October</HI> the third was <HI>Sunday</HI>.</P>
<P><Q>“<HI>October</HI> the fourth, Mr. <HI>Curtis</HI> at the <HI>Red-Lion</HI>, of∣fer'd me Store houses to lay up a great Quantity of Mast, and gave me several Accounts of great Quanti∣”ties of Beech.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I went into St. <HI>Leonard</HI>'s Forest, where I had the following Account from <HI>Lyney Gatford</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Shep∣”herd</HI>, two of the Warreners.</Q></P>
<P>'That the Forest belongs to my Lady <HI>Calf</HI>;</P>
<P>'That it contains above eighteen thousand Acres.</P>
<P>'That it always hits well once in three Years.</P>
<P><Q>“That <HI>Anno</HI> 1712, the Beech-Mast lay so thick all over the Forest, that a Man cou'd not walk with Plea∣”sure, by reason of his sinking into it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“That the Dryness of this Year had blasted most of the little Mast it bore, but that it was most unusually ”budded for the next Year.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>October</HI> the Fifth, Mr. <HI>John Waller</HI> at the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Head</HI> at <HI>Horsham</HI> promis'd to do all the Service he ”cou'd.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="79" MS="y"/>
<Q>“From <HI>Horsham</HI> I went to the <HI>Mense</HI>, a vast Place of Beech, belonging to Mr. <HI>Stanley</HI>, but found the Mast ”very indifferent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Mr. <HI>John Tailer</HI> of this Place inform'd me, that the Trees here were beyond Imagination thick of Mast This Time two Years; That he had observ'd, it was always so one Year in three; and that the Trees were strangely budded against another Year, which I have my self with much wonder every where taken Notice of; He was much amaz'd to hear that Beech-Mast wou'd make Oil, and has liv'd in That Place all his ”Life-time, and never knew any gather'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I went to <HI>Flaxen</HI>-Park, which is full of fine Beech, and belongs to the Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI>; but it has miss'd ”this Year.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I find it much a-like every where, as to the Mast; but there will be no End of setting down the prodi∣gious and unmeasureable Tracts of Beech, I meet with, ”as I travel.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I went to <HI>Petworth</HI>, and spoke with one <HI>John Gray</HI>, who has a great many Beeches, but cou'd promise no ”large Store of Mast this Year.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Mr. <HI>Gilway</HI>, Keeper of my Lord Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI>'s Park here, Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> at the <HI>White-Hart</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Plat</HI> a <HI>Tobacconist</HI>, all join in an Assurance, that in every Third Year a Man might fill St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church with the Beech-Mast, that may be got in their Neigh∣”bourhood.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“From <HI>Petworth</HI> I went to my Lord <HI>Montague</HI>'s Park by <HI>Midhurst</HI>, where the Beech-Trees are innumerable; I observe that where-ever I come, the Beech suffers not so much as Grass to grow under it, and the Ground
<PB N="81" REF="80" MS="y"/>
being generally plain and dry, there is nothing to do, but sweep up the old Husks and Sticks to the Body of the Tree, in a Heap, and the Mast may be thresh'd down, and then rak'd up, and put into Sacks, with∣out the Charge of spreading Sheets, or any other Ex∣pence, or Labour; so that I don't see how, consider∣ing the Quantity, which one Man's Labour will pro∣cure in a Day, a Bushel of Mast can be expected to cost any little Sum, so much as worth the Naming; I am sure the Charge of Carriage, which is very cheap too in these Parts, will more than double the Expence of the ”Beech-Mast.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Mr. <HI>Lawrence Horishe</HI> at the <HI>Eagle</HI>, at <HI>Midhurst</HI>, sent for several People, who liv'd upon <HI>Charlton</HI>-Forest, about three Miles off, who inform'd me, that they wou'd gather and send up as much Mast, as they cou'd get; That their Forest in some Years bears such prodi∣gious Quantities, that the Boughs are often known to ”split the Trees with their Burthen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“This Forest belongs to my Lord <HI>Scarborough</HI>; and the Chief Rangers are <HI>John Crouch</HI>, of <HI>West-Den</HI>, and <HI>John Bud</HI> of <HI>Charlton</HI>, who were very well pleas'd to hear of the likelihood there was for their Mast to become ”worth gathering.</Q></P>
<P>'They assur'd me that next Year wou'd produce a very 'plentiful Crop.</P>
<P><Q>“<HI>October</HI> the Sixth, I travers'd <HI>Bear</HI>-Forest, which is near twenty Miles round; There was some Mast, which I took what Care I cou'd to get gather'd; The People told me that it never fail'd to hit every third Year, and that next Year it wou'd bear a Mort of Mast ”as they express'd it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I went on to a Place, call'd the <HI>Barnet</HI>, between <HI>Petersfield</HI> and <HI>Alton</HI>, belonging to Sir <HI>Harry Tichburn</HI>,
<PB N="82" REF="81" MS="y"/>
where is great Plenty of Beech, and indeed till this Journey, I did not think there had been one Beech, ”where I found a Thousand.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>October</HI> the Seventh, From hence I went to <HI>Winche∣ster</HI>, and thence to Mr. <HI>Streets</HI>, at the <HI>Anchor</HI> at <HI>Red∣”bridge</HI>, upon the <HI>New-Forest</HI> in <HI>Hampshire</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I met here with one Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI>, who lives at <HI>Win∣chester</HI>; This Gentleman told me, that he wou'd engage in a good Year to deliver a Million of Bushels, from off the <HI>New-Forest</HI> only, and that he thought I offer'd too great a Price; He said he knew the Forest very well, and is sure, there are poor People enough living in it, to gather all the Mast it can bear, and store-Room ”enough near at Hand to lay it up all safe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> rode out with me about the Forest, where the Beech-Trees are monstrously large; We met with many People, who inform'd us, that the Year be∣fore last, the Beech-Mast lay and rotted upon the Ground, in such Plenty, that the Colts, which are bred upon the Forest, were much put to it to find Grass enough to live upon; And that next Year wou'd prove as good a Season for Mast, as That was; I ask'd them how they cou'd be so sure before-hand, and they shew'd me the Branches, and bid me take Notice, how they were budded, and assur'd me that there wou'd be ”more Mast upon the Trees than Leaves;</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Rangers Names of the <HI>New-Forest</HI> are, Mr. <HI>Ed∣ward Bright</HI>, Mr. <HI>Gale</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wild</HI>, Mr. <HI>Dickson</HI>, Mr. <HI>Gun∣ner</HI>, Mr. <HI>Marden</HI>, Mr. <HI>Gun</HI>, Mr. <HI>Tarver</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Gold</HI>; The Mast of this Forest is in Common, and the poor ”People can never be hinder'd from gathering it.</Q></P>

Years been destroy'd in this Forest, but there yet re∣main incredible Numbers; many of them are This Year pretty full of Mast, and what can be got I have given Orders about; But they tell me here, as indeed they do every where, that the Beech-Mast seldom hits greatly above once in three Years, of which this is but the Se∣cond; We rode above twenty Miles in the Forest, through some of the stateliest Beeches I ever saw, and tho' I can scarce know what to promise this Year; I am not able to represent in Words the amazing Quantity of Mast, which in a bearing Year, may almost every where be gather'd in This Part of the Kingdom; Not This Forest only abounds, but cross the <HI>Severn</HI> for twenty or thirty Miles together along the Hills, you can see no∣thing as you ride along but Beech; And I am positive that many single Hundreds in the County of <HI>Glocester</HI>, ”will afford you Mast enough to do your Business:</Q></P>

<P><Q>“To talk of naming every Wood and Forest of Beech, were to go about to count the Stars; Above half the King of <HI>Prussia</HI>'s Dominions, as I came through them, have hardly any other Trees than Beech, and hardly any Prospect but Woods; Both <HI>Saxony</HI>'s, and all the River <HI>Elb</HI> are full of Beech; It is the commonest Wood over all <HI>Germany</HI>; I have seen the Mast almost half a Foot thick for five or six Leagues together; 'Tis so easy to be got, that no value can justly be set upon it, but the Carriage from one Place to another; But above all Places, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stphalia</HI> is the Country, for there the Oaks and Beeches, by the Mast they afford, give Revenue to the Prince and Subsistence to the People; I lie now at the House of a <HI>Westphalian</HI>, whose Brother is a Forester under the Bishop of <HI>Osnabrug</HI>, and He tells me that he

remembers his Father us'd to feed for Sale, a constant Stock of five or six hundred Hogs with Beech-Mast, and that he has known above fourscore Bushels beaten ”down in an Hour or two's Time, from one single Tree.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Here is a Gentleman of <HI>Holstein</HI> in This Town, who tells me that the Earldom of <HI>Laurwig</HI> in <HI>Norway</HI> is in a manner over-run with <HI>Beech</HI>, that Workmanship is strangely cheap there, and Freight for <HI>London</HI> so easy, that he is sure it wou'd not cost so much to carry Mast ”from thence, as to buy it up in <HI>England</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“He says that the <HI>Royal</HI> and <HI>Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Holstein</HI> abound greatly with this Sort of Mast, and that if Care were taken to have it gather'd, a Navy might be loaded ”from Either of those Countries.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“SInce I receiv'd Yours, I have taken all possible Care to be particularly inform'd in the Affair of Beech-Mast, I cou'd my self have said much to it, having liv'd nine Years in a Part of <HI>France</HI>, where all the Inha∣bitants for many Miles round, are, as it were, <HI>sub teg∣mine Fagi</HI>; But I have been solicitous to hear the Sense of wiser Men upon the Subject, and am now able to ”answer your Queries with a fuller Assurance:</Q></P>
<P><PB N="$9" REF="88"/>
<Q>“Here, about <HI>Paris</HI>, we have no Beech-Woods, that is to say, none which consist entirely of that Species; Tho' we have them, and that vastly large, and no less frequent, in our neighbouring Woods, about <HI>Meudon, Versailles, St. Germain, Mont-Morency, Fountainbleau</HI>, and many other Places, within a Day's Journey round us: But almost every where on the River <HI>Loire</HI>, and particularly, in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Orleans</HI>, there are whole, and huge Forests of this Kind: The <HI>Garonne</HI> is border'd with them, even as low as <HI>Bourdeaux</HI>, nor are they wanting on the <HI>Somme</HI>; Indeed I know no ”Wood so common as the Beech in all this Country.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They ripen, here with us, about the Beginning of this Month, but do not easily, nor without much shak∣ing, quit their Husks, till after a severe Frost or two; I have observ'd them hanging upon some Trees till near <HI>Christmas</HI>. When they fall, they lie in most Places an Inch or two thick, but the Deer, where-ever they can ”come at the Store, are sure to lessen it a-pace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I cannot so particularly inform you, as to the Price, for which they may be gather'd, but to come as near a Certainty as I cou'd, being last Week with <HI>T— B</HI>— at <HI>Mont-Morency</HI>, I employ'd a Peasant for a whole Afternoon, to spread a Parcel of Blankets under the Beeches, behind his Stable, and shake down all he cou'd; And at Night he measur'd out eleven Bushels; According to which Quantity, if we reckon, that a Man who begins to work in the Morning, may shake down twenty Bushels a Day, I cannot see they will come to ”much above a Farthing a Bushel.</Q></P>

<SALUTE><HI>Monsieur,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>“I DO my self the Honour to answer without Loss of Time, the Letter of a Gentleman, tho' unknown, yet so effectually recommended; <HI>Monsigneur</HI> the Am∣bassador was pleas'd to do me a Justice I am proud of, when he said I was a Lover of publick Spiritedness, and ”the Study of Nature,</Q></P>
<P><Q>“We have, <HI>Monsieur</HI>, in every Part of <HI>France</HI>, too much of this Beech, you write about; Towards the <HI>Pyrenees</HI> it harbours Wolves in Numbers, hurtful to the Husbandry of the Neighbourhood; Our Northern Pro∣vinces have now for near an Age made better Use of the same Woods in smaller Quantity; For they have in many Places no Oil, but what the Beech-Mast yields them, and which is indeed so excellent, that many of our Courtly Tasts begin to envy the Beech-Oil of our Peasants, and prefer it to the choicest Product of our ”Olives.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But nothing moves my wonder so much as that this Art should be, till now, a Secret in your Country, when it is the most publick Thing in the World in that Part of ours, which is nearest to you; I am the more amaz'd, because at the Time, when I receiv'd your Letter, I was sitting in my Study, and remembring such a Thing, I presently laid my Hand on a Book, which was translated out of your Language not above twenty Years ago, and was dedicated to the <HI>Roya<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Society</HI> of <HI>London</HI>; 'Twas publish'd by the Sieur <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Evelyn</HI>, and is call'd a Dis∣course of Forest-Trees; This very Author in a particu∣lar Chapter upon the <HI>Beech-T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee</HI>, says expresly, that the Beech-Mast yields a very sweet Oil, which the Peasants of <HI>France</HI> press out in Mills, and eat with much Satisfaction; your Island is indeed possess'd of
<PB N="9$" REF="90"/>
many Blessings, and may the rather Escape our Wonder for neglecting This; But give me leave, <HI>Monsieur</HI>, to declare my self more pleas'd than surpriz'd at a Neglect, ”which is the Means of so much Honour to a —</Q></P>
<P>[Here the Gentleman is pleas'd to practise the good Breeding of his Country; so I go on to the Business of his Letter.]</P>
<P><Q>“In <HI>Bretagne</HI>, and the Provinces where they make this Oil of Beech-Mast, their Mast is gather'd and brought to the Mills by Country People for a <HI>Piece de cinq Sons</HI> (five Pence) <HI>per</HI> Bushel. The Millers will grind any Man's Mast, and make it into Oil, for a Penny a Bushel over and above the Mast-Cakes, which they give to Cat∣tle. I cannot remember what exact Quantity of Oil they expect from every Bushel of Mast; but I am sure it is more than they get from the same Quantity of Rape-Seed; which last Seed is therefore grown out of Use in ”those Places.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I know not how to answer your Question of what Price it bears hereabouts. We are so well stor'd with Olive-Oil, that we never make Oil of Beech, but in small Quantities for the Apothecaries, and a few parti∣cular Palates. But I can in general assure you, that if Plenty creates Cheapness, you may buy it in these Parts ”for what you please to offer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Three Forests of <HI>Blois, Chambours</HI>, and <HI>Orleans</HI>, are full of Beech Wood for above Two hundred Miles together. The Ground lies so cover'd with the Mast in its Season, that it makes Hunting troublesome: And all these Forests are fall of the poorest People in <HI>France</HI>, and lie along upon the River <HI>Loire</HI>, which runs down to <HI>Nantz</HI>, from whence the Mast might be shipp'd away ”for <HI>England</HI></Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>I might go on thus through a hundred Sheets of Paper, but you have already more than enough to demonstrate the prodigious Profit, Ease and Infallibility of the Disco∣very.</P>
<P>I come now to the Reasons why, after all this satis∣factory Information, and undeniable Proof of the great and certain Profit of the Undertaking, I stop'd short at once, and took new Measures.</P>
<P>It is impossible for one who is not perfectly acquainted with the Nature of these Things, to imagine what an in∣expressible Fatigue attends the standing like an <HI>Atlas</HI> un∣der Burthens far too heavy for a single Shoulder.</P>
<P>This Fatigue does not only arise from the Pains and Care, the daily Toil and constant Circumspection neces∣sary: These, though in <HI>themselves</HI> no easy Weight, are light, when compar'd with the frequent Impertinencies arising from a general Unsteddiness in Peoples Inclina∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="92"/>Every silly Story gives Alarum to the Apprehensions of the Multitude. To Day they <HI>confide</HI>, to Morrow they <HI>despair</HI>; and 'twere a pleasant Speculation for a Person unconcern'd, to stand by and observe this incessant Ro∣tation of unsettled Fancies.</P>
<P>Nor, is this all. A Man who succeeds in an Affair like mine, and enjoys in a manner all the Profit himself, is made the common Butt, the shooting Mark of Envy and Malice. The World is apt to think his Merit over-paid by his good Fortune; and they never fail to take the surest Means they can to mortify his Vanity.</P>
<P>All this I experienc'd in the severest Manner; and all this I despis'd. I look'd down with a due Contempt up∣on the unmanly Efforts of defaming Talkers, and con∣sider'd with much Concern, but little Anger, that they had not learn'd to make <HI>what they would be willing to suf∣fer</HI>, the Rule and Measure of <HI>what they resolve to do</HI>.</P>
<P>But at last, I must confess, I grew weary of long re∣ceiving and forgiving the same repeated Injuries; and resolv'd to use the fairest and most likely Means I could think of to put an End to the Cause from whence they took their Rise.</P>
<P>A lucky Opportunity threw it self in my Way. The Year, by the unseasonable Drought, and a severe Blite at∣tending it, was, as you have seen by the Journals, very unfavourable to the Beech-Trees: The Mast was nipp'd in the Bud, and most of it spoil'd. Even that which escap'd, of which enough however might easily have been got to supply more Beech-Oil than would have made good my Articles, was lighter and less only than in good Sea∣sons.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="93"/>The Accident immediately allarm'd the Subscribers. They became apprehensive that their Money was in Dan∣ger; and comparing this Disappointment in the Season with the Rumours of the Town, they rashly grew jea∣lous of Success, and became almost universally uneasy.</P>
<P>To as many of them as openly declar'd their Appre∣hensions, I made plain their Mistake: I blam'd them for their Unsteddiness: I represented to them, that though the Blite had damaged the Mast, and much lessen'd the Quantity, yet there was more than enough to be got to do my Business.</P>
<P>I illustrated this by the Example of <HI>Apple-Trees</HI>, which every Body knows to <HI>fail</HI> three or four times for once that they <HI>bear well</HI>; and that even in the worst Years, some Parts of the Kingdom have great Store of Apples: So the <HI>Beech-Mast</HI>, though blited in the general, is not∣withstanding very good in many particular Places.</P>
<P>I went on, and urg'd, that as no Body would pretend that a Man could get nothing by the <HI>Cider-Trade</HI>, because there are four <HI>scarce</HI> Apple-Years to one <HI>plentiful</HI> one, so it would be more unjust to pretend, that the <HI>Beech-Oil-Trade</HI> must come to nothing by reason of a bad Year or two, Because a good Year for <HI>Beech-Mast</HI> must as infal∣libly come as a good Year for <HI>Apples</HI>; and when it does come, the Patent secures the whole Benefit of the Beech-Oil to it Proprietors; whereas the Cider-Trade lies open, and has many Thousand Rival-Sharers to divide and lessen its Profits, which are not in themselves a tenth Part so considerable.</P>
<P>I further informed them, That I did by no means depend wholly upon the <HI>English Mast</HI>; but that I had sent many Agents abroad, and had contracted with seve∣ral Merchants for great Quantities of Beech-Mast, from <HI>France, Germany</HI>, and other Places; and particularly with
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
Mr. <HI>Adrian Gulderstein</HI>, for Two hundred thousand Bushels from the <HI>Ducal Holstein</HI>.</P>
<P>These and many other Arguments I us'd to convince them, That their Security was infallible, and they ought in Reason to distinguish that it was so: But however I resolv'd at once to put an End to all their Doubts. If other People would not see their own Advantage, that was no Reason why I should be blind to mine: I there∣fore writ a Letter to the following purpose, and sent it to every particular Subscriber, both upon the first Propo∣sal and the second.</P>
<P><Q>“I told them, that <HI>Michaelmas</HI> drawing nigh, I thought it proper to put them in mind, that if they did not pay in the last Part of their Subscription-Money, the first Part, which they had paid in already, would by the Ar∣”ticles they subscrib'd to become forfeited.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But that, notwithstanding this Article of Forfeiture, I would be so far from insisting on the Advantage, That if any of them were in the least uneasy, they were free∣”ly and entirely at Liberty to withdraw their Subscrip∣tion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“And to encourage them to withdraw, They should not only be paid back all the Money they had advanc'd, but a clear Profit of Twenty five <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon it; that is, I would pay them a Hundred and twenty five Pounds ”for every Hundred Pounds receiv'd from them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I therefore gave them ten Days Time for Considera∣tion, and desired them to choose freely, and either pay in the rest of their Money by the Time fix'd, or give Notice at the Office, that they would quit the Sub∣”scription upon the Conditions which I offer'd them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="95"/>The Subscribers upon the last Proposal, to a Man, accep∣ted my Offer; and the Reason they gave me for so doing was this, That there was likely to be no great Quantity of Mast this Year, and that therefore they believed my first Stock would be sufficient. That the Success of my Affair was very probable; but that since I had been so generous to make them such an unexpected Offer, they could not but believe I had my Interest in so doing; and they thought they should act most wisely by accepting it, since it was no contemptible Gain to clear Twenty five <HI>per Cent.</HI> and to have been less than Six Months out of their Money.</P>
<P>I paid them back their Subscription, and the Profit upon it, with a much greater Pleasure than they receiv'd it from me. But the Subscribers to the First Stock of Twenty thousand Pounds were divided in their Senti∣ments; and those in the List, which you will see inserted in another Part of this Book, would upon no Considera∣rations whatever be induced to part with their Right in the Subscription, and still remain entitled to their An∣nuities.</P>
<P>I now with a great deal of Pleasure look'd back upon what I had done. I had reduc'd my Stock from a Hun∣dred and twenty thousand Pounds to Fifteen thousand on∣ly, and had drawn my Business into a very narrow Com∣pass.</P>
<P>I had every Day great Sums of Money offer'd me, but I dislik'd the Conditions, though they were indeed much easier than those I had so luckily dissolv'd. I found the Blite had so far damag'd the Mast in <HI>England</HI>, that I ra∣ther chose to depend on my Foreign Prospect for the little Quantity I should now want, and therefore recall'd my Agents, put a Stop to the Engines and other Works I was beginning at <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI>, and many other Places in the Country, and thought it more prudent to wait another
<PB N="97" REF="96"/>
Year before I put the Business to its utmost Stretch, be∣cause the Mast, which is almost the only Expence, will then be both as cheap again, and as good again toge∣ther.</P>
<P>But at last, the universal Opinion of my Friends, and my own Reason concurr'd, in a Resolution, That it was, upon many Accounts, a fitter Work for a Bo∣dy of Men than any single Person; and that by such a Method of carrying it on as I have now determin'd to proceed by, the general Advantage of the Business, and my own particular Profit and Ease, might be very well reconcil'd, and promote each other.</P>
<P>This therefore is the Cause to which you owe the Op∣portunity of this new Proposal. The Proposal it self you have at large in the next Division.</P>

<PB N="98" REF="97"/>
<HEAD>A NEW PROPOSAL For Establishing a BEECH-OIL COMPANY, AND Dividing the Power and Profit of the <HI>PATENT</HI> into Shares.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> WILL endeavour to describe what I mean distinctly, and speak as plain as I can, that I may be rightly understood by my Readers.</P>
<P>Never before was so great and so secure a Profit given for such a trifling Consideration, as will be here demand∣ed. My Design is not a Gain to my self, but a certain Foundation for the Undertaking I am going on with; and the only present Benefit I seek to make, will be found upon Examination little more than a reasonable Re∣imbursement of my Charges.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="98"/>The smallest Sum for which any Body can be concern'd in this Proposal, is Five and forty Pound, seven Shillings, and six Pence. If you part with this Forty five Pounds, odd Shillings, it cannot fail, within the Year, to make you a clear Profit of at least Two hundred. If you make not the Profit, you part not with the Money. And if you will be timorous enough to fancy Impossibilities, and sup∣pose that the whole Affair should come to nothing, even in That Case you cannot lose above the odd Five Guineas.</P>
<P>The Greatness of the Stock, which is Two hundred thou∣sand Pounds, will arise from the Number of the Sharers, and not the Dearness of the Shares. Every Part of the Design shall be made plain to your Apprehension in the Pages following. All I intend here is only to let you know the Bottom upon which you are to stand, if you come into the Proposal.</P>
<P>A Book is now open, every Day, at the Beech-Oil Office, at the <HI>Golden-Key</HI>, a Woollen-Draper's, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-yard, from Nine in the Morning till Twelve, and from Two till Five in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>This Book contains Five thousand Instruments, which I call Shares. These Instruments are sign'd by my Hand; and every Body who purchases one or more of them, be∣comes entitled to one or more Shares in the whole Benefit and Power of the Patent.</P>
<P>The Price of every one of these Shares is Forty five Pounds, seven Shillings, and six Pence; that is to say, Forty five Pounds, seven Shillings, and six Pence, is the whole Sum which any Body can be obliged to pay in up∣on one Share from first to last: Out of all which, I am to have, in Consideration and Reimbursement of all past Charges, Trouble and Fatigue whatever, no more than the odd Five Guineas: The other Forty Pound <HI>per</HI> Share is to be the Stock to carry on the Business, and the Sharers
<PB N="100" REF="99"/>
themselves are to raise it, and dispose of it as they see Occasion.</P>
<P>So that the downright Fact is no more than this: You pay Five Guineas for being let into a certain Means of making Two hundred Pounds a Year by laying out Forty. Observe but what you read, and you shall see this made as plain and demonstrable as you think it prodigious.</P>
<P>You will say, such a Profit as This was never heard of before. I allow it was not; neither was there ever be∣fore so good a Foundation to build it upon.</P>
<P>When you have paid this Five Guineas for your Share, the other Forty Pounds will remain in your own Hands.</P>
<P>Out of this Forty Pounds the only dead Payment will be Fifteen Shillings every half Year, for the Annuities hereafter mentioned, which still stand charged upon the Patent. All other Expences will be for carrying on the Business, as is found necessary by Five and twenty Directors of your own choosing.</P>
<P>These Directors are obliged to account for the Profits once a Year, or oftner; and when the Dividends are made, your Charge is first to be reimbursed you, after which One twentieth Part of the clear Gain is to be de∣ducted for my Use, in Consideration of the Power and Advantages I give you, and then the Remainder is divided among you all in Proportion to your several Interests.</P>
<P>Your Money must be raised by a publick Order of your Directors, and by different Payments, sometimes Twenty Shillings, sometimes Fifty, sometimes more, as Occasion may require, and the whole Business transacted with as much Ease and Security to the Sharers as is possible.</P>
<P>But you will better apprehend the Design by the fol∣lowing Extract of the Deed and Schedules, by which
<PB N="101" REF="100"/>
your Right is convey'd to you, and which, for your un∣questionable Security, is enroll'd in the High Court of <HI>Chancery</HI>.</P>

<PB N="108" REF="107"/>
<HEAD>A Discourse explaining the Advantages of This <HI>Proposal</HI> to the Persons concern'd.</HEAD>
<P>I Will under this Head be as brief as possible, for I have no Occasion to say much upon a Subject, which to every Thinking Reader, will explain it self.</P>
<P>If you consider the <HI>Profit</HI>, it is prodigious; If you think upon the <HI>Sum</HI> you <HI>venture</HI>, to entitle your self to this Profit; It is scarce worth naming.</P>
<P>The foregoing Proofs must convince any Man of com∣mon Sense, that Beech-Mast can never cost the <HI>Company</HI>, Even reckoning Carriage and all, so much as Six-pence a Bushel, or indeed any Thing near it, as I shall hereafter make more plain to your Directors, when I discover ma∣ny Steps, which by the Experience, I have had in the Affair, seem properest to be taken.</P>
<P>All other Charges, with Mills, Engines, Salaries, and every Thing, which can be thought upon, will fall infi∣nitely short of another Six-pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel; so that what∣ever Oil a Bushel of Beech-Mast yields, can stand the <HI>Company</HI> but in one Shilling.</P>
<P>Suppose then that you have only six Quarts from a Bushel, and that you sell, at the very lowest Price, Even no dearer than stinking Rape-Oil, that is, at three Shil∣lings a Gallon; At This Rate, which, both as to Pro∣duce and Price of the Oil, is far below what can ever happen, Every sharer will make a clear Profit of 400 <HI>l. per Cent, per Annum</HI>, upon whatever Money he employs in the Undertaking.</P>
<P>Nay, you may fairly reckon all the Money the Oil sells for, to be clear Profit, since I have experienc'd and will discover to the Company, that the very refuse Mast-Cakes, which are left after pressing out the Oil, will sell for more Profit, than the whole Charge of the Business.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="108"/>Neither is it an Objection to say, that the Beech-Mast hits well only one Year in three, since besides that you may in bad Years be furnish'd cheaply from beyond-Sea, you may gather Mast enough in <HI>England</HI>, in one good Year, to supply the Trade, till another good Year hap∣pens, tho' they shou'd be seven Years asunder.</P>
<P>I have taken Leases of some of the best Beech-Parks in <HI>England</HI>, any one of which, in such a Year as this next is expected to prove, will almost supply Mast enough for the whole Kingdom; The Rents are very easy, and the Bargains shall hereafter be apply'd to the Service of the <HI>Company</HI>.</P>
<P>Let us however set aside the Profit to be made by the <HI>Mast-Cakes</HI>, and only reckon upon the 400 <HI>per Cent</HI>, which is a Gain, that I defy all Mankind to shew a Rea∣son, for not depending on.</P>
<P>At this Rate, Examine the Advantages you become entitled to by buying one Share only.</P>
<P>You come to the Office at the <HI>Golden Key</HI> in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Church-yard</HI>, and pay down for your Share five Guinea's.</P>
<P>This five Guinea's is all you hazard; You cannot pos∣sibly lose a Farthing more; For admit that all the unde∣niable Demonstration of this Business were a meer Dream, a Shadow, a <HI>Chimaera</HI>, a Thing of nothing; Yet even so, you can lose no more than that little Sum, for the fol∣lowing Reasons.</P>
<P>No more Money is to be paid, or can be demanded, till your Directors are chosen, and see fit to call it in by such several Payments, as they find necessary.</P>
<P>It is naturally to be supposed, that You, and every other Person concerned, will take Care to give your Vote for none but Men, whose Honour, Character, and Capa∣city you are very well acquainted with.</P>
<P>When four and twenty such Men are join'd with me, They have four and twenty Times my Power in the Ma∣nagement of the Affair; and will, naturally, both for their Reputation and their Interest, take proper Measures, fully to acquaint themselves with the Nature of it and issue no Orders but what shall be apparently conducive to the general Benefit.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="109"/>You cannot be imposed upon by any false Pretences; For all Orders for raising Money, and the Causes for which they require it, are enter'd, and lie publick for your looking into, and your Directors are oblig'd, at the End of their Year, to give you an Account, and demon∣strate that they have apply'd your Money, as your selves design'd it.</P>
<P>Were the next Year, instead of a <HI>Good</HI>, to prove a <HI>bad</HI> one, all the Money, which you cou'd possibly be liable to pay, wou'd be Thirty Shillings for the Annuities, and a much smaller Sum for Salaries, Agencies, and all the standing Charges of the Business, so that if you were to be <HI>Getting</HI> nothing, you wou'd, in a manner, be <HI>Pay∣ing</HI> nothing neither.</P>
<P>But as it is a Kind of Infallibility, that next Year will prove, as every Third Year does, a Year of Plenty, so 'tis likely, that within the first twelve Months, your Di∣rectors will find it Necessary, to call in all, or the great∣est Part of your Forty Pounds, to pay for Beech-Mast, Oil-Works, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if so, by that Time your whole Sum is paid in, a Dividend of Profits will become due, and you will receive a Hundred and sixty Pounds clear Profit, upon the Forty Pounds you pay in upon your Share, as before-mention'd.</P>
<P>'Tis a Jest and a Folly, not worth answering, for any Man to question, or deny this Calculation; It is very much under-rated, and will appear so to any Man, who has the Soul of a Gentleman, and Sense enough to make him capable of Demonstration; I build not upon imagi∣nary Schemes of what <HI>May</HI> be, but plainly prove, what <HI>Must</HI> be; And He, who does not see and acknowledge This, shou'd lay the Fault upon his own shallow Judg∣ment, and not Want of Force in the Argument; I write not to the Dregs of Mankind, but have been so us'd to the Insolence and Scurrility of ignorant Men, that I for∣get my present Readers may be the Reverse of That de∣testable Character, and am provok'd to more Warmth than is necessary.</P>
<P>You have here no dangerous Trials, no rash Adven∣tures
<PB N="111" REF="110"/>
to make; You have no uncertain Charges to under∣go, before you reap the Benefit you aim at, Your Ex∣pence, on the Contrary, is small and limited, Your Pro∣duct certain, visible and common, and the Event, as in∣fallible, as the Undertaking easy.</P>
<P>If Malice dares attack <HI>This</HI> Proposal, nothing surely can be free from Her Ill Influence; The Enemy to a De∣sign like <HI>This</HI>, can never be a Friend to the Interest of his Country; And 'tis a <HI>silly</HI> Spleen, that leads a Man to talk, and act against a Business, meerly because his Soul is nar∣row, and he has not Reach of Thought enough to fathom it.</P>
<P>If any Body can object against the smallest Particular of what I have affirm'd in the foregoing Pages, Let him stand out and attack me fairly; I desire, as the Fencers say, <HI>No Favour</HI>; But to asperse, to backbite, and calum∣niate; to stand, as it were, behind a Door, and shoot at me through a Loop-Hole, is a poor and an unmanly Practice, and below the very Dignity of Humane Nature.</P>
<P>I have nothing now to add, but that I wou'd advise my Reader, after a just, and an impartial Reflection on the Whole, to consider wisely, and not lose an Opportu∣nity, which is likely to be but short; and which being now miss'd, will never happen more.</P>
<P>Weigh and consider, with the Reason of a Man, and the Spirit of a Gentleman, what a Trifle is to be ven∣tur'd, in Comparison with the Profit expected; How much more generous it is to run so small a Hazard, were it merely in Regard to <HI>Publick Good</HI>, upon the very <HI>May be</HI> of a probable Proposal, likely at least to be beneficial to the Nation, than for Fear of losing such an inconsider∣able Sum, as you may be concern'd for, to leave so much as a bare <HI>Possibility</HI> of its failing for Want of Encourage∣ment.</P>
<P>Shares are sold at the Beech-Oil Office, which is now kept at the <HI>Golden Key</HI>, a <HI>Woollen-Draper's</HI>, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Church-Yard</HI>, from 9 to 12 in the Morning, and from 2 to 5 in the Afternoon.</P>

<PB N="112" REF="111"/>
<P>FOR the Satisfaction of All such, who may not know, What Beech-Mast is, Little Parcels of it are deliver'd with the Book.</P>
<P>Sometimes 4 and 6, but generally Two of those little three corner'd Nuts grow together within the outward Husk, which Husk always gapes, when they are ripe, and lets them fall, upon the least Shaking of the Tree.</P>
<P>In making the Oil, the little Nuts with the hard brown Skin, that is upon them, are all ground down to Powder by a Mill, as Almonds are, But I send you to Nuts whole, that you may the better see the Nature of them.</P>
<P>Now to be at once convinc'd, as effectually as is possi∣ble, of the great Quantity of Oil, which This Mast con∣tains, you need only pull off the little brown Shell from one of the Nuts, and sticking the Kernel fast upon the Point of a sharp Fork, hold it in a Candle, till it takes Fire, And you will see it burn with as clear a Flame, as the Candle it self, and may perceive the Oil run down an Inch or two upon the Fork, as you hold it in your Hand.</P>
<P>This little Trial, when you consider that near a Hun∣dred thousand of These Nuts go to make a Bushel, will as fully demonstrate the Fact to any Man of Sense, or Knowledge, as Ten thousand Experiments; Tho' pub∣lick Experiments will also be made, in vast and daily Quantities, when the good Mast, which is speedily ex∣pected from <HI>France</HI>, and <HI>Holstein</HI>, shall arrive in the River.</P>
<P>For the better Convincing you of the Certainty of This Proof, Take any little Piece of a Wall-nut, Hazel∣nut, or Almond, all which are publickly known to yield half their Weight in Oil, tho' by the Price of these Nuts, their Oils are very dear, and you will see it burn exactly in the same Manner with the Beech-Mast; But on the Contrary, make the same Experiment with a Chesnut, or an Acorn, which have no Oil in them, and you shall presently perceive the Difference of their Natures.</P>
