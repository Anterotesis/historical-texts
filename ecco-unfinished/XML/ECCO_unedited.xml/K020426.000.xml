<HEAD>CIVIC SERMONS
TO THE
PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Nay, why even of yourselves, judge ye not
what is right.</HEAD>
<P>MY BRETHREN—I call you by
this title because we are all truly
brethren; not, as some of the heathens
imagined, of different <HI>races,</HI> sprung, some
of them from the earth, and others deriv∣ing
their origin from the gods; but being
all descended from one earthly father,
namely Adam, and all created by one hea∣venly
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
father, namely the one only God
of the Universe. I have called these Ser∣mons.
A Sermon is a discourse. Your
cattle cannot discourse; they like each
other's company, they herd together,
they have a variety of tones by which
they can make each other sensible when
they are pleased, angry, or in pain, but
they cannot discourse. To discourse is
to communicate ideas, that is thoughts,
to compare—to reason upon them. This
is the privilege of man. It is by this
faculty that he is above the brutes,
and it is to persuade you to use this
faculty that these discourses are chiefly
written. Many seem to think that
poor people, or those who work to
maintain themselves, have not this fa∣culty,
and that you ought to be led
and governed like the brutes, without
knowing why or how. But this is
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
worse than sinking you from your sta∣tion,
it is degrading you from your
species. <HI>Judgment</HI> depends upon good
sense and information. Good sense is
born with us, and is found in every
rank of life, in one as much as ano∣ther.
There are many in the highest
classes who are deficient in it, and who
for that reason are led, and often im∣posed
upon by others; and many in the
lowest employments, who from possessing
a remarkable share of it, are consulted
and looked up to by those about them.
This you cannot but have observed.
With regard to information, the case
is different; that is not given by na∣ture;
and if a man is destitute of it,
certainly he cannot judge of those things
in which he wants it. But there is
none of you so low as that he may not
acquire a competent degree of infor∣mation,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
even in matters of general im∣portance,
if he earnestly desire and seek
for it. You can all of you get in∣formation
enough concerning your re∣spective
trades and handicrafts, and yet
many of them are very difficult and
full of mystery to those who have never
taken the pains to enquire into their
principles. The clay that is wrought
into shape under the hands of the pot∣ter,
seems to the stander-by to be
swelled, and rounded, and touched into
form, as it were by enchantment. The
dextrous throwing of the shuttle, and
the web of cloth that grows beneath
the fingers of the weaver, is gazed at
with admiration by the fine gentleman
or fine lady, who saunter through your
busy manufactories, and they see colours
mingle, and flowers and figures start
into the work, without being able to
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
comprehend how they are produced there.
Yet it is not because their capacity is
not equal to such knowledge, for <HI>you</HI>
comprehend these things, because you
think it your duty and interest so to
do, and you have taken pains to learn
them. The principles of Government,
which is one of the noblest subjects
for the understanding of man to em∣ploy
itself about, and which I now
wish to recommend to your attention,
are not more difficult than the princi∣ples
of the arts by which you get your
bread; you may certainly understand them
if you think it worth your while to take
the pains.</P>
<P>But many people will tell you, you
have nothing to do with Government;
that you are like sheep, who ought to
follow the shepherd; like the feet and
hands, which ought to obey the head,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
without having yourselves any choice
or will in the business. You may de∣sire
these people to look at a sheep,
and then at a shepherd; to examine
the feet and hands, and then the head,
and they will find that the one is by
Nature formed quite differently from
the other. You cannot take a sheep
from the flock, and by giving him a
crook, and putting on him a certain
garment, turn him into a shepherd.
You perceive at once, on looking at the
feet and hands, that they are designed
for different purposes from the head.
In all these instances, the intention of
nature is written in such plain and for∣cible
characters, that no one can mis∣take
it. If, therefore, you see any
men born amongst you as different from
yourselves as you are from sheep, and as
much superior, you may safely take it
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
for granted that it is the will of Heaven
that you should obey them; but as no
one will pretend that there are any such
men, the son of a king being born into
the world the same naked, helpless, ig∣norant
creature that your own children
are; it will be proper to enquire <HI>why</HI>
some men are set over and govern
other men. And as to what these peo∣ple
say with regard to your having no∣thing
to do with Government, I will
tell you what Government is, and then
you will judge whether you have any
thing to do with it or no.</P>
<P>Government is the art of managing
the affairs of a community. Our com∣munity
consists of nearly twelve mil∣lions,
of whom I suppose about nine
millions maintain themselves by some
kind of manual labour. If, therefore,
you of the lower classes have nothing
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
to do with Government, three millions
are allowed to manage as they please
the affairs of nine millions. Govern∣ment
is not the art of managing the
affairs of the moon, but your own af∣fairs.
It is not true therefore that
you have nothing to do with it. Ask
those who tell you that Government is
nothing to you, whether it is nothing
to you how much of your wages and
hard earnings are taken from you in
taxes—how much of your corn you
may put into your own barns, and how
much you must put into the barns of
other people—for what things you may
be put in prison, and for what things
your life may be taken away—by what
means you may obtain redress if you
have suffered wrong from any one—to
which of your children your little pro∣perty
will go after you are dead, or
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
whether to any of them?—on what oc∣casions
you may be obliged to go into
other countries to fight and kill people
whom you never quarrelled with, or
perhaps to be killed yourselves. I think
you will hardly say, that these things are
nothing to you; yet all these things
belong to Government, and are deter∣mined
by it. You may fairly suspect
of those who give you such advice, that
Government is a great deal to them,
and that they find it very convenient
to manage your affairs; but look around
you, and you will easily see that no one's
affairs in any business whatever are well
managed, except he himself has some
knowledge and care about them.</P>
<P>Some are pleased to say, that if you
understand Government, you will not
obey it. I should rather think the con∣trary;
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
and that finding, upon examina∣tion,
Government to be a noble art, an
excellent contrivance, an invention to
secure peace and order and plenty in a
kingdom; to restrain bad men and pro∣tect
good; not a plot and conspiracy
against you, but a plot for your welfare and
happiness formed by wise and honest men,
who have watched while you slept, and
been careful for you before you could be
careful for yourselves—finding this, I
say of Government, and good Govern∣ment
is this, you will love and revere
it almost beyond any thing else, and
be ready to lay down your lives to
preserve it to your families. In bad
Governments, such as Turkey, Govern∣ment
is a plot <HI>against</HI> the people, and
therefore in all probability they will not
obey it when once they come to find
out the plot; but no one, I hope, will
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
presume to say it is so in this kingdom.
That which is good is more loved the
more it is known and studied. The
bees have reason to be thankful to the
man who invented glass hives, because
now that we can see the ingenuity of
their contrivances, and their industry and
their oeconomy more fully than before,
our admiration of their skill is so much
the greater. Whoever, therefore, says you
will not obey, if you understand, slanders
the Government; he calls it unjust, weak,
and calculated to make you wretched;
why else will it not bear to be looked
into? Besides, you are at this time par∣ticularly
called upon by the Proclamation
of your King, which tells you that there
are <HI>divers wicked and seditious writings
industriously dispersed,</HI> and <HI>correspondencies
entered into to forward criminal</HI> and
<HI>wicked purposes,</HI> which writings and
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
purposes you are <HI>solemnly warned to
guard against.</HI> It is therefore highly in∣cumbent
upon you to know what Se∣dition
is; and to know whether the
purposes for which any correspondencies
are entered into are <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>criminal,</HI>
otherwise, through your ignorance, you
may be guilty of calling by these bad
names, practices and writings which
are very harmless and lawful. Some
men, it is plain, have got wrong no∣tions
of Government; it is the more ne∣cessary
for you to get right ones. And
that you may have some rule to go by,
in judging of these writings and prac∣tices,
the Proclamation further tells
you, that they tend to <HI>vilify</HI> and <HI>bring
into contempt provisions made for the
security of your rights</HI> and <HI>liberties;</HI> the
security of which rights and liberties,
<HI>both civil and religious,</HI> together with
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<HI>the public peace and prosperity,</HI> your
Governors assure you that they <HI>desire
more earnestly than any thing else.</HI> It
becomes therefore highly necessary that
you should enquire what these rights
and liberties are, and what things tend
to promote the peace and prosperity of
a kingdom. These are high matters,
but you see you are called upon to
examine, you are expected to understand
them. You will not be allowed to plead;
I do not know what Sedition is, I do
not know what our rights are. You
are further enjoined to <HI>discourage all pro∣ceedings
tending to promote riots and tu∣mults.</HI>
That there have been such
things you know very well; I suppose
few of you can be ignorant, that a
little while ago, wicked and seditious
men, misled I suppose by some of these
wrong notions which you are warned
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
against, assembled at Birmingham, and
pulled down the houses, destroyed the
goods, and endangered the lives of quiet
and worthy citizens, to the very great
shame and disgrace of this kingdom;
the more so, as they have not yet re∣ceived
any adequate indemnification for
their property so destroyed. Now the
men who did this mischief wanted to
be informed what the rights of their
neighbours were, and what sort of be∣haviour
Government required of them;
for want of this knowledge, they called
themselves, all the while, the Friends of
Government, and mistook the matter
so far as to think, that pulling down
of houses was promoting the peace and
prosperity of the kingdom. You are
further desired to place <HI>a just confidence
in the wisdom and integrity of Parlia∣ment.</HI>
You will do well to observe the
propriety of this expression. The figure
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
of Justice, you know, is represented with
a balance to weigh out to every one his
due, with nice and scrupulous exactness,
so much and no more. You are not de∣sired
to place a blind confidence, but a just
confidence, that is, a confidence in their
wisdom and integrity, just so much as will
arise from what upon examination they
shall be found to possess of those qualities.</P>
<P>You are invited, therefore, by those
who wish the welfare of their country,
and your welfare, to gain just ideas of
wha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerns it; for, by having false
ideas, you may do much harm: but do
not mistake me, you are not <HI>all</HI> invited.
You who are dissolute, idle, intemperate,
savage in your manners, profligate in
your principles, without care for your∣selves,
or for those who depend upon your
labour; who prey upon the honest in∣dustry
of others; who are ignorant, not
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
merely from want of information, but
from a debased and besotted understanding—to
you I do not speak, you <HI>must</HI> be
governed like brutes; for you <HI>are</HI> brutes.
You who own no law, cannot judge of
laws. You <HI>must</HI> be slaves, not thro' the
appointment of men, but by the eternal
law of nature. A King, with such dis∣positions,
cannot govern; he may prowl
about for a time, and tear in pieces and
destroy; but he cannot govern. You too
may break loose, and do mischief to others,
but you cannot do good to yourselves;
you never did, nor ever can. You rush
over, and devour, and trample down;
but when your wild fury has spent itself,
you are sure to slink back, hungry and
tired and sore with wounds, to crouch
as before, and lick the hand that is held
over you. To you Government is known
by its restraints, and Religion by its terrors.
All that Government <HI>can</HI> do for you is to
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
soften and alleviate the miseries you bring
upon yourselves, by your thoughtlessness
and your vices. While to others it secures
<HI>from</HI> you the property they have taken
pains to acquire, for you, with sterner
kindness, it builds hospitals, workhouses,
and prisons; but it does not call you to
the assemblies of Citizens, nor submit
its awful regulations to your untutored
fancies. But you, in whatever rank of
life you are, who are sober, industrious,
and thoughtful; you who respect the
property and rights of your neighbour,
and therefore demand and deserve that
your own rights and property should be re∣spected;
you who have a home, and there∣fore
have a country; you who have a love
of order, a sense of ingenuous shame, a re∣lish
for the conveniencies and decencies
which civilized life affords; you who
have a provident care for your families;
who are accustomed to say to yourselves,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
I will not buy strong drink to-day, be∣cause
my children will have no bread to∣morrow—you
are worthy to consider the
affairs of a community, which, tho' more
complicated, are not materially different.
Come then, when the business of the day
is over, and leaning over your counters,
or by your clean fire-sides; or sitting
under your spreading trees, or in the porch
covered with honey-suckle before your
door, steal a little leisure to turn over these
things in your minds, in which, if I can
assist you, it will give me great satisfaction.
You need not chide away your children,
that press about you to climb upon your
knees; they will give a spirit and edge to
your meditations. It is for THEM: it is
for YOURSELVES.</P>
<P>For the present farewell, and God
bless you!</P>
