<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF our Laws and Liberties be dear to us, how much are we indebted to those by whom they are secured, and 'tis the duty of every grate∣full person in some measure to pay their acknow∣ment, to such whose Care and Courage protects them from the rude insults of Arbitrary Power, among which none is more Conspicuous than your self.</P>
<P>What you have done for <HI>England</HI>'s safety shows the great Stock from whence you sprung; your No∣ble Father, whose Glorious Actions will to Posteri∣ty record his Name whilst you, his Son, pursue his Glorious steps, and guard your Country from invading Foes, a subject for Incomiums from our abler Pens, for what can like Poetry preserve a brave Man's Fame, the greatest Conqueror the World
<PB REF="3"/>
e're knew, but for that had in Oblivion slept; and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Hero receiv'd more lasting Glory from the blind Bards Immortal Lines, than did <HI>Egyptian</HI> Mo∣narchs, whose insatiate thirst for eternal Fame errected Piramids of prodigious bulk, strong and durable, as they thought the World it self. Yet these, and Statues too of Stone and Brass are now de∣vour'd by the Iron teeth of Time, and not so much as the Founders Name left undefac'd, but Poets give eternal life to great Exploits, which thro variety of Languages gain universal Praise.</P>
<P>I am proud to be the first that in this kind have laid an Offering at your Feet, thereby shewing our greatest wits a subject worthy their sublimest thoughts, for tho the Poet makes the Verse, 'tis the Hero makes the Poet.</P>
<P>Your Conduct, Bravery and Success at Sea shows you were born for War, and justly chosen to Com∣mand a Fleet, that does Command the World, yet is not your Courage more terrible to your Ene∣mies abroad than your courteous affability, and obliging condescention is charming, to your friends at home.</P>
<P>The Muse still studies to pay her earliest tribute to the most deserving, and in all her search, where can she find Merit more than yours, alured by these thoughts she Courts your Protection, a Protection that wou'd make even Cowards loose their Fear, and by your bright Example straight grow Valiant, you'l excuse I hope, Sir, the zeal that hurried me
<PB REF="4"/>
on to make this small Essay in your Praise, and my Countries Honour, 'tis daring I confess in one who is unqualified for a Theme so ample: But fear be∣ing a Vice you ever hated, I may presume to be more easily pardon'd for this bold attempt, and al∣low'd to lay hold of this opportunity of declaring to the World how much I am,</P>

<L>THE Man you Ladies ought to fear,</L>
<L>Behold and see his Picture here,</L>
<L>With Arms a cross and down cast Eyes</L>
<L>Thus languishes, and thus he dies,</L>

<L>Thus he sighs, and thus looks dull,</L>
<L>Thus he ogles, thus he snears,</L>

<L>But thanks my Stars, that danger I disown,</L>
<L>For in the Pit, I see 'tis—one — to one.</L>
<L>And while the Fair can all their rights enjoy,</L>
<L>We'll keep our Title up to being Coy,</L>

<P>My Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Gra.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hast thou divulg'd the News that my Son died at <HI>Rome?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rosco.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Lord, with every Circumstance, the Time, the Place, and manner of his Death; that 'tis believed, and
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
told for truth with as much confidence, as they had been Spe∣ctators of his End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Gra.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's well, that's very well, now <HI>Rosco</HI> follows my part, I must express a most unusual grief, not like a well-left Heir for his dead Father, or a lusty Widdow for an old decri∣pit Husband; no, I must counterfeit in a far deeper strain; weep like a Parent for an only Son: Is not this a hard task? Ha, <HI>Rosco</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rosco.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, no, my Lord, not for your Skill; in your Youth your Lordship saw Plays, convers'd with Players, knew the fam'd <HI>Alberto</HI>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Gra.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, by Heav'n, I have seen that Knave paint Grief in such a lively colour, that for false and acted Passion he has drawn true Tears, the Ladies kept time with his Sighs, and wept to his sad Accents as he had truly been the Man he seem'd, then I'll try my part, thou has't still been privy to my Bosom; secrets know'st Wealth, and Ambition are the Dar∣lings of my Soul; nor will I leave a Stratagem unessay'd to raise my Family. My Son is well and safe, but by Com∣mand from me he returns not this three Months. My Daugh∣ter, my <HI>Lucasia</HI>, is my only care, and to advance her For∣tune, have I fram'd this Project; how dost like it <HI>Rosco</HI>, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rosco.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Rarely, my Lord, my Lady will be now suppos'd the Heir to all your vast Revenues, and peste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d with more Suitors than the <HI>Grecian</HI> Queen, in the long absence of her Lord. You'll have the Dons, Lords and Dukes swarm about your House like Bees.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Gra.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My aim is fixt at the Rich and Great, he that has Wealth enough, yet longs for more, Count <HI>Pirro</HI>, the Governour's Heir and Nephew, that rich Lord that knows no end of his large Fortunes, yet still gapes on, for Gold is a sure Bait to gain him, no other Loadstone can attrack his iron heart, 'tis proof against the force of Beauty, else I should not need this Stra∣tagem, for Nature has not prov'd a Nigard to my Daughter.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Gra.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! not relish it! has she any other Tast but mine, or shall she dare to wish ought that may contradict my purpose— But hold, perhaps you know how she's inclin'd, you may be Confederate with her, and manage her Intreagues with that Begger <HI>Palante</HI>, who is only by Lord <HI>Exphane's</HI> bounty, my mortal Enemies, kept from starving.</P>

<P>You have lost a worthy, and a hopeful Son, but Heav'n that always gives, will sometimes take, and there is no Balsam left to cure these Wounds but patience; there's no disputing with it, yet if there were, in what could you ac∣cuse

<SPEAKER><HI>Gra.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know I should not repine, my Lord, but nature will prevail, I cannot help reflecting on my Loss; alas, my Lord, you know not what it is to lose a Son; 'tis true, I have still a Child, Heav'n has now confin'd my care to one, to see her well bestow'd shall be the business of my Life — Oh! my <HI>Eugenio</HI>.</P>

<L>Has <HI>Homer, Hesiod</HI>, and the rest by roat;</L>
<L>Yet what's all this to Picquet, Dress or Play?</L>
<L>Or to the Circle, on a Visiting-Day?</L>
<L>A finish'd Beau; for such fine things I have seen,</L>
<L>That heretofore, has of some Colledge been:</L>
<L>But that Despising, nothing now retains,</L>
