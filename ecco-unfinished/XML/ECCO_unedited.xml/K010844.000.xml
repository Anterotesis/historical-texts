<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THis is but the second Time that the Author hereof hath undertaken to appear in this publick Manner, although he has for many Years been known to have strangely fortold several Things, which have precisely come to pass: As in particular; At the Peace of <HI>Reswick,</HI> he foretold, that in a short time the War would break forth a∣gain: He foretold the great Storm, and several other Things; and having the second Sight, he has said many Strange and Wonderful Things in a Manner so unaccounta∣ble, that none have come near him in this Age.</P>
<P>He was perswaded the last Year to give Leave to a Friend to Publish his Prophetick Observations, who did it with an inexcusable Weakness, turning much of it into Jest and Ridicule, and setting the Imaginary and Thread∣bare Name of <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> to it: This made the more serious Part of it suspected by Wiser, People, and made the Whole look more like something Prophane and Ro∣mantick than a Prediction of Wonderful Judgments to befal the World.</P>
<P>The Author therefore justly disliking that Method, recom∣mends his Predictions to you this Year, from his own Hand, in a more grave and solemn Manner.</P>
<P>Before he goes on to the Particulars of a Year, equal for Wender with any that have gone before, he bespeaks his Reader to look back upon his last Year, and observe how much of what he said there, came exactly to pass, book suitable to the Circumstance of Time and Place as well as Persons.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> He foretold the Death of the late Emperor <HI>Joseph:</HI> but the partial Publisher having been affraid to make it Publick, for Fear of the Resentment of the Emperor's Ministers, He forbore to mention it, though the very Time, and part of the Circumstances, appear in the Original Manuscript, which the Author has now by him,</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
<HI>Next,</HI> He foretold the Death of the <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>France</HI> in so many Words, the very Month of his Decease; h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Words are these, <HI>The Dauphine Dyes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> He exactly Predicted the Death of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦reschal de Bouffleurs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> He exactly Predicted the Battle between t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> with such exact Circumstan¦ces, that he told you the Pretences both Sides made to the Victory, together with the wasting away of the King <HI>Sweden's</HI> Forces, without doing any thing considerable.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> He foretold you the breaking out of the Plag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Dominions, and especially that it should make great Havock in his Capital City <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> which has been eminently fullfilled, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many other Things, for which he referrs to his last Year<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prophecy, and hopes as he has set out this in a more seri¦ous Manner, it may meet with your more serious At¦tention.</P>

<HEAD>First Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Councils of <HI>Europe</HI> having been long busie upon the great Dispute about Peace, begin now to fee not so certain as some People imagined; and therefore with great Diligence apply themselves to make prepara¦tions for War; but this is only that the good posture of Affairs on both sides my contribute to make the Op¦posite <HI>Party</HI> more willing to hearken to Terms.</P>
<P>Whatever shew of War they make, many other Con¦federates incline to obtain a Peace; <HI>France</HI> uses all i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Interest to obtain a <HI>Peace,</HI> and will bid fair to fix a Peace if not with all the Allies, yet with some of them, who are so Considerable, as that the Less must come in last; but this is not yet, for some of the Confederat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> oppose it with great Steddiness.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
The War in <HI>Pomerania</HI> goes on heavily, the <HI>Dane:</HI> blasted by Heaven, succeed in nothing they Attempt a∣gainst the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the Extremity of the Weather, Want, Sickness and Service, waste their Army, and the rest run away so fast, as will make the Whole unfit for their Designs. The <HI>Swedes</HI> defend themselves, and stand their Ground, and that Undertaking will prove un∣successful, as most unjust Wars do.</P>
<P>The Affair of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Bender</HI> will prove yet Intricate; he will make Three Attempts to shake the Resolutions of the Grand Signior, and he almost per∣swades him to Break again with the <HI>Muscovites;</HI> but the Humour Changes at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and he cannot compleat it yet, he continues there still.</P>
<P>A great Storm this Month may do great damage at Sea, and in the Ports of <HI>Europe;</HI> but it seems the <HI>Dutch</HI> will be the principal Sufferers.</P>
<P>A great Person in this Nation, and two in <HI>France,</HI> will yield to Fate about this Month.</P>
<P>In <HI>Britain</HI> great Contention about places, preferments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And several People who have long expected to lose their places, shall fall, to make Room for another Party to guide the Nation.</P>
<P>No Signs of <HI>Peace</HI> among our selves yet, whatever may happen Abroad.</P>

<DIV1 N="2">
<HEAD>Second Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>PEace creates War as War produces Peace, and the same Meetings and Consultations of Ambassadors and Plenipotentiaries have been had, but not being able to ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust Matters, the Preparations for War go on; great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ums of Money, and new invented Ways for the raising <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are now the Subject of the Councils of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Rich raise Strifes and War, and the Poor pay for it: New <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>axes are laid by Authority, and the Heads of the Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctors are now employed to find out proper Methods for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upplies, that we may be ready for War as well as for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eace.</P>
<P>Great Struggling of <HI>Parties</HI> in <HI>Britain,</HI> in Opposition
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
to a Treaty of Peace; yet the Necessity of Affairs seems to make it unavoidable: Those that consent to Treat, do not all consent to it with a design of <HI>Peace;</HI> however, the Resolution of the Treaty seems to prevail, and accor∣dingly Ambassadors from all Parts are Named, and be∣gin their first Conference in form, though abundance of Memorials and Remonstrances are daily presented from Abroad against it.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> press to peace; the <HI>English</HI> appear willing; the <HI>Dutch</HI> backward; smaller Allies indifferent; the Em¦peror absolutely refuses it.</P>
<P>Twice about <HI>February</HI> things appear ready to close, the <HI>Frenth</HI> offer largely; some Allies assent, some crave more, others reject all.</P>
<P>Strange foreboding Signals of the Calamities of <HI>Eu¦rope</HI> happen about this time, unusual Tempests, monstrous Births, surprizing Earthquakes, and the like: The Mor¦tality of Cattle spreads it self into several parts of <HI>Eu¦rope;</HI> a rare runner of a Mortality of another Kind, which shall Carry off a great many of the First Rank in <HI>Europe</HI> particularly in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

<DIV1 N="3">
<HEAD>Third Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>GReat News from Sea about this Time to the Advan¦tage of our Enemies the <HI>French</HI> in some part o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>America.</HI> The Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> are now acting two contrary Extreams; they Treat of a <HI>Peace</HI> as if the resolved to have no more <HI>War;</HI> and they prepare for <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as if they had no Thought of <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P>All the proceedings on the Treaties of <HI>Peace</HI> seem end in a separate Accommodation, and as if every Bran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were to look to it self: They begin to Act with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Confidence, and less Satisfaction in one another than fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> merly: <HI>France</HI> makes its Court here, and blusters a talks big there, just as its Interest guides: <HI>Britain</HI> a <HI>Holland</HI> hold together still, though great Endeavours many Sides to separate and disunite them.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> use all the Art and Subtilty, peculiar that Nation, in order to separate the Confederates, a break them off from one another; nor is it altogether wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> out Success; some Nations are in more Need of <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
than others: Some carry on the War at less <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> than others; and some are likely to make better <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Peace</HI> than others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Emperor</HI> stands obstinately out against a <HI>Peace,</HI> and threatens to carry on the <HI>War</HI> alone; complains of being Abandoned by the Allies; and refuses to divide, or part with the least Share of the <HI>Spanish Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>North,</HI> as more out of danger of the <HI>French,</HI> are backward to a <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Britain</HI> puthes for a <HI>Peace</HI> Abroad, but great Heats and Quarrels about it at Home, where neither the Thing it self, or the Conditions, relish with the people so well as <HI>Peace</HI> ought to do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> are now sitting; uncom∣mon Difficulties attend the raising Supplies, and restless Spirits push at making popular Distractions: The Friends to new Revolutions in <HI>Britain,</HI> both as to Ministry and Succession, though on different Foundations, and with differing Views join in this, to oppose and embarrass the constituted Government.</P>
<P>Great Changes are Brewing in the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Denmark, Poland</HI> and <HI>Muscovy</HI> prepare as if they resolved to devour the <HI>Swede,</HI> but the latter holds up still against them all.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4">
<HEAD>Fourth Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PEACE</HI> surprizes the World now rather by the va∣rious Shapes it appears in, than the Means it is procured by: The Nations seem rather to drive one another to Peace, than approve of it; and those that call what they have done, <HI>a making Peace,</HI> rather comply than are pleased with it.</P>
<P>However, they Treat with more Earnestness about it now, as being brought to the <HI>Crisis</HI> of Time when they must cast the <HI>Dye</HI> for <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War.</HI></P>
<P>Something shall happen in the middle of this Transaction that shall put all <HI>Europe</HI> on new Measures. A Great Crown falls from a powerful Head about this Time; and <HI>Europe</HI> avoids a third <HI>War</HI> about <HI>Property,</HI> with great Difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Strange unseasonable Tempests and unwholesome Va∣pours fill the Air; and the darkest Day that was ever∣seen, will happen about <HI>April,</HI> though by no Eclipse of the Sun at all.</P>
<P>The War in <HI>Pomerania</HI> threatens greatly about this Time, the <HI>Swedes</HI> begin to appear strong; and the Princes of the <HI>Empire,</HI> the States of <HI>Holland</HI> and others, begin to concern themselves to prevent the Consequences of the War: The <HI>Muscovites,</HI> puff'd up with Success, talk big, and threaten the Empire; and the Confederate Princes begin to see too late the Fruits of Assisting to make that Barbarous Nation great in the World.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> begins to make new Stirs in the <HI>East,</HI> and continuing still among the <HI>Turks,</HI> at last brings the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> to a Quarrel; but no <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar</HI> in Hand yet.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> falls in with the <HI>Swedish</HI> Designs at <HI>Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ti∣nople,</HI> but acting the Cunning part, however leaves if in∣different, whether to get the <HI>Turks</HI> to break with the <HI>Czar</HI> or with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as what may either Way embark the <HI>Empire</HI> in the War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Venetians</HI> Arm, and some little Hostilities happen at Sea; but no War yet.</P>
<P>About this Time, the <HI>Season</HI> returning, the <HI>Plague</HI> be∣gins to give new Alarms in <HI>Europe,</HI> and spreads it self in∣to <HI>Mecklenberg, Holstein</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> being brought thither by the <HI>Danish</HI> Armies and Fleets: <HI>Rostock, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>Str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsund</HI> begin to feel the terrible Effects of it: The City of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> escapes yet.</P>
<P>Three great Persons in the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Family else, and perhaps himself; his Allies not effectually assisting him, the <HI>Danish</HI> Affairs are reduced very low.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5">
<HEAD>Fifth Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>NOW they begin the Campaigns; some Fight and some Treat, and some both Treat and Fight; and some who talk as big as any, neither Fight nor Treat: The War goes on Awkwardly and Heavily, as if they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought with an Iil Will: <HI>French Cunning</HI> prevails in many
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<HI>Courts,</HI> and they have Peace in Effect, when they have War in Appearance: Thus the War now rather Impo∣verishes than Destroys, and there is likely to be more Money than Blood lost this Campaign.</P>
<P>Farther off, the War and the Plague punishes <HI>Europe</HI> together, the last having made desolate the most Flourish∣ing Countries, spreads now into the <HI>Empire,</HI> by slow steps coming this Way still, threatens us more and more. <HI>Hamburgh</HI> feels this terrible Enemy a little before the hot Weather comes in, but more afterwards: <HI>Pomerania</HI> is now miserably afflicted with War, Pestilence and Fa∣mine; no Pen can describe the Distresses of the Inhabi∣tants of that Country.</P>
<P>The New Emperor begins to threaten <HI>Europe</HI> with a Mighty Army, and talks Great Things: <HI>France</HI> gets Ground by crafty and subtil Councils, rather than the Sword; yet an Action happens in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to the Disadvantage of the Imperialists; <HI>Charles</HI> VI. pushes great forces into <HI>Italy,</HI> and prepares for new Wars on the Side of <HI>Provence,</HI> but he wants Shipping to Transport his Forces into <HI>Spain,</HI> and unless the <HI>Con∣federates</HI> supply, he must give it over in <HI>Catalonia.</HI></P>
<P>Death gives a great Blow in <HI>England,</HI> which will have an Effect upon the publick Measures; but the QUEEN is Safe, and the Hopes of her Enemies are not so high as before.</P>
<P>The Parties in <HI>England</HI> carry on a furious War, and fight many Battles, which, tho' without Blood, have very fatal Effects upon the Nation: Things look dark, and the People begin to see the Circumstances their own Folly has brought them to: National Divisions threaten the Nations Peace, Trade lost, Credit sunk, and the People uneasy.</P>
<P>The Queen exhorts to Peace: What <HI>People</HI> but those would let her perswade in vain?</P>
<P>Great Strife at Court, heaving and thrusting in and out; and every Head has his Party to push on his Inte∣rest among the People, and make him appear formidable and popular</P>
<P>Some promising Hopes of a <HI>General Peace</HI> begin to ap∣pear, but it goes off again; the <HI>Emperor</HI> stands out yet,
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
and obtains some Allies more than was expected; <HI>France</HI> offers to restore to <HI>Britain,</HI> and make our Queen Arbitress of <HI>Europe; France</HI> resolves to have a <HI>Peace</HI> with <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> by Granting rather more than they Ask.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="6">
<HEAD>Sixth Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>STill they Fight on, and Treat on; nor does any Suc∣cess on this Side or that influence the <HI>Plenipotenti∣aries</HI> on either Side: The <HI>French</HI> decline coming to any de∣cisive Action, but stand on the defensive in all <HI>Places,</HI> ex∣cept <HI>Spain,</HI> that no Blow in the Field may oblige them to yield to meaner Terms than they were willing to stoop to before.</P>
<P>The uncommon Symptoms of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Distress, now shew that they were not vain Signals; the Earthquake in <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> the <HI>Disease</HI> of the Oxen in <HI>Pa∣dua</HI> and other parts of <HI>Italy;</HI> the strange <HI>Distemper:</HI> that raged both among Men and Horses: What were they but Fore-runners of the <HI>Plague</HI> which this Year, and about this time of the Year invades many Countries in <HI>Europe</HI> with a dreadful Violence.</P>
<P>Last Year I foretold you it should come into <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and both of them have prov'd true: <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI> shall Bury an Hundred Thousand e'er this Year shall enter far in; <HI>Belgrade</HI> and <HI>Buda</HI> have found it true also from both these: Expect it now in the <HI>Do∣minion</HI> of the <HI>Venetian</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and on both sides the <HI>Adriatick Gulph.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Hamburgh</HI> escapes not the Month of <HI>May, Britain</HI> escapes not this Year, and if both escape this Year, let them take it for a Reprieve from Heaven till the next, to move them to Repentance before the Sword is drawn, and before the <HI>Destroyer</HI> lands among them.</P>
<P>Now the Intriegues of the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Tartar</HI> at <HI>Ben∣der</HI> break out; and the <HI>Turks</HI> again animated against the <HI>Muscovices,</HI> threaten a new War, but no Action on ei∣ther Side yet.</P>
<P>The Councils of <HI>Europe</HI> are now universally perplex'd
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
and great Revolutions will happen in divers parts of the World, nor will the least of them happen among us and our Allies.</P>
<P>The War in the <HI>North</HI> begins to grow formidable to the rest of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the <HI>Policies</HI> of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and King of <HI>Poland</HI> threaten the <HI>Empire.</HI> A Great <HI>Prince,</HI> hitherto an Enemy to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Councils, ap∣pears now acted and influenc'd by the Council of <HI>Ver∣sailles,</HI> at least as far as may serve to threaten <HI>Europe,</HI> and force the Confederates to turn their Eyes to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and divert them from other Efforts.</P>
<P>At last the <HI>Dane</HI> is Ruin'd by the War with <HI>Sweden,</HI> and obliged by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> to give over his <HI>Designs,</HI> and sit still, and glad to do it too, without the <HI>Swedes</HI> falling upon them.</P>
<P>Death threatens a <HI>Great Person</HI> in the <HI>Hanover</HI> Court; but <HI>Britain</HI> having no less than four immediate succeed∣ing Heirs there to her Crown, need not fear having an Occasion to make a new Settlement of the Entail.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7">
<HEAD>Seventh Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>NOW we are flatter'd with Hopes of bringing the <HI>Peace</HI> to a Conclusion, but Obstructions still ap∣pear; the <HI>Emperor</HI> pushes and presses the <HI>French</HI> on a War; the Armies on every Side are in the Field, and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> tells us, <HI>He will make good what was boasted on Behalf of the Emperor:</HI> He passes the <HI>Rhine,</HI> enters <HI>Alsatia,</HI> offers Battle to the <HI>French,</HI> who won't Fight, hoping to Master the <HI>Germans</HI> a better Way.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Maintenon</HI> looks into her Grave, as if to see how she likes it; but if she escapes <HI>June,</HI> she sur∣vives still, and recovers.</P>

<P>War breaks out now between the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Ve∣netians,</HI> and <HI>France</HI> Insults the <HI>Venetians</HI> at the same time; yet the <HI>Turks</HI> make no immediate Expedition in∣to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Territories, being cautious of a <HI>War</HI> with the <HI>Emperor: French</HI> Councils embroil the <HI>Turkish</HI> Court, and the <HI>Grand V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zier</HI> complies with the <HI>Propo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als</HI> for <HI>War,</HI> or falls, or gives Way to those who are of another Mind.</P>
<P>A Battle in <HI>Pomerania</HI> about the Month of <HI>June,</HI> and fought with great Obstinacy and Blood on both Sides; the <HI>Swedes</HI> have the real Advantage, though the other claim victory according to Custom.</P>

<P>Aseeming Conclusion of the Peace has been now the Effect of a large <HI>Treaty: France</HI> oppress'd by the War, makes larger Concessions, and the Influence of some Princes assist: The Emperor, tho' not able to effect all his Designs, seems more flexible to Conditions, being willing to get <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Indies</HI> from the <HI>French,</HI> yet the many Interests which the several Parties pursue in this War, are not so easie to be adjusted as that a full Conclusion can be made.</P>
<P>In <HI>Flanders</HI> the utmost Artifice is made use of on both Sides, as well to push on, as to fend off the War. The <HI>French</HI> lose Ground, and the Confederates make odd Attacks; and this shewing only a long retracting of the War, which many are weary of, and make a Handle to press to Peace.</P>
<P>We find the Conclusions at <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> unable to put a final End to Jealousies and War; and tho' we have now the Appearance of Peace, they all stand with Sword it Hand, as if ready to break out into a New War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Muscovites</HI> go to War in Earnest; and about this Month some Action happens between them to the Disadvantage of the <HI>Muscovites:</HI> The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> is now in the Field, and his Affairs in <HI>Pomeren</HI> take a new Turn.</P>

<HEAD>Eleventh Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>SOme People think the Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> is settled now, and some think it as far off as ever; yet new Mea∣sures at Court make new Divisions among the <HI>Parties:</HI> Great Discontent about Management endangers the New Ministry, and if a thorow Change does not happen in the <HI>British Court,</HI> it will be nearer to it than ever it was before, and the Escape very Narrow.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> feels great Disorders about this Time, and Things look very dark on that Side. Some popular Riots happen, as is usual, in Distemper'd Countries be∣fore more publick Commotions happen.</P>
<P><HI>Britain,</HI> like a Body neither Sick or Well, enjoys neither <HI>Peace,</HI> or makes <HI>War;</HI> and the Disatisfactions at Home swell up so, that honest Men know not which to desire: The <HI>French</HI> rejoice at a <HI>Peace,</HI> some here call it so, but others say it is Criminal to call it a <HI>Peace,</HI> and that a War is nearer a Peace than the Condition we are in at present.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> and some other Confederates, not think∣ing themselves kindly used in, or secure by the late Treaty, Arm, and refuse to Declare themselves upon what Occasion several Endeavours are used to foment a Breach between the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> but do not bring Things to that heighth yet.</P>
<P>Winter and cold Weather makes Health encrease a little, and the Pestilence stops; but the War goes on in the <HI>North</HI> with great Fury, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> prevail in several Places.</P>

<HEAD>Twelfth Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Year ends on our Side with Plans, Schemes, <HI>Plots</HI> and <HI>Designs</HI> of <HI>Parties</HI> for the next: <HI>French</HI> Interests and <HI>French Parties</HI> influence too much our Af∣fairs; and the Knowledge of it makes every Man, and every party of <HI>Men</HI> Jealous of each other.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> has made but too much Advantage of the Divisions of the Year among the Confederates, and has obtain'd some advantageous Conditions, which if they had been better United, he could never have arrived to; yet the <HI>English.</HI> Court has given Checks to some of his Encroachments, and talks roughly to him about some others, on which he abates some Pretensions.</P>
<P>What is wanting to fix and settle a General Peace, and what Conditions were Agreed to, they now begin to put in Execution, and to settle the General Quiet.</P>
<P>Councils, States, Parliaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Assemble now, and People flatter themselves that War and Mise∣ry, Poverty and <HI>Taxes</HI> shall cease, and <HI>Trade</HI> Flou∣rish; but we see it yet but in Faith and Futurity: <HI>GOD send us better News for next Year.</HI></P>
