<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>MINISTERS in all countries are very cau∣tions, and very careless—In France, as well as England, they lock up letters and state papers in <HI>Green boxes;</HI> but sometimes these boxes are not well taken care of—it was to this caution, and this carelessness, that I am indebted for the discovery of Monsieur <HI>De Sartine's</HI> politics. For, about six weeks since, a bro∣ther Jacobin and myself, in our morning rounds, called at Mademoiselle <HI>Du Thé's.</HI> Madamoiselle's femme de chambre, a little arch brunette, whose eyes seemed to require absolution, having opened the door, engaged the attention of my companion; so that, without any inquiries from the maid, I slipped up stairs, to be of e∣qual service to the mistress. The toilet door being open, I walked in, in hopes of finding her there; but I soon saw my mistake; for, upon one of the sophas I discovered a chapeau de bras and sword; which ex∣citing my curiosity, I examined the room more closely, and, behind the veil of the glass, to my great delight, I perceived a <HI>Green box.</HI> In short, Monsieur De Sar∣tine, who had come late from his Majesty, was, at that moment, in Madamoiselle Du Thé's arms, while his <HI>Green box</HI> was in mine; and I leave you to think which of the two was the best pleased. I immediately snatch∣ed up this treasure of secrecy, and, hiding it under my gown, without disturbing my brother, who was occu∣pied in devotion, I hastened home to study politics. I own, at first, I had some scruples about opening the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>box, but I reflected how much it was the duty of my profession to discover all secrets; and, I argued, that, if it was profane, even in kings, to conceal their thoughts from their confessors, a minister who locked up his secrets must be an enemy to religion, and, if not him∣self, certainly his <HI>Green box</HI> should be put to the <HI>que∣stion.</HI>—But, why reveal these secrets? It's fair to disco∣ver, but not to disclose them.—To this I answer, that the papers themselves must be my defence—Possibly, some critics may, at first, be inclined to compare Sar∣tine's box to Pandora's, and the editor to a second E∣pimetheus; but they will soon do me the justice to make some distinction between us. It was not till <HI>af∣ter</HI> he had opened his box that war and discord broke forth; but all the mischief was done in France, long <HI>before</HI> I opened M. Sartine's. The fable says, Hope alone rested at the bottom: An allegory, very flatter∣ing to the Editor of the <HI>Green box.</HI>—In short, if these papers show how little reason we have to depend on the French ministry, or the English opposition, I shall trust to the judgment of every friend of France to ap∣prove or condemn this publication.—O you, my coun∣trymen, whom I love, and who ought to love me for flying my country for your sake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As soon as the Editor had determined to publish these papers, he thought it adviseable to retire to Holland.—The Bastille has never been a friend to the liberty of the press.</NOTE>, will you not at last think and act like Frenchmen of true spirit?</P>
<P>—The editor has published the several papers without any arrangement, but merely as he drew them out of the box, leaving it to the superior sagacity of his readers to form their own opinions as they may natu∣rally arise from reading them.</P>

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS FOR MYSELF<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It cost the Editor great pains to decypher these private memorandums—they appeared by the M. S. to have been sketched out at different times by M. De Sartine, sometimes with a pen, and sometimes with a pencil.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>WHENEVER His Majesty talks to me about the distress of the people, the low state of the finances, or of such things, I must expatiate on glory, the love of empire, Louis le Grand, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If his Majesty should inquire for the particulars of our loss at Pondicherry, I will immediately recount the arms, ammunition, and warlike stores, so gloriously ta∣ken at Senegal. It is but a slight transition from Asia to Africa, and his Majesty is no pedant in geography.</P>
<P>D'Estaing's squadron is in so bad a way, that it is now high time for me to discover that I always have thought he would not succeed—I have looked melan∣choly for the two last levees; but this is not enough. I must take a decided line—I am therefore determined, at all events, the very first time the King mentions D'Estaing, to <HI>shake my head;</HI> nay, I have my doubts whether it may not be eligible—even to <HI>shrug up my shoulders.</HI></P>
<P>Though it is very right to praise so young a King as ours, for his generosity and disinterested love for Ame∣rica, yet it's not politic to say too much of this. In an absolute monarchy, it is dangerous to talk so warm∣ly
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>of the love of liberty; besides it may appear a little inconsistent; for, tho' we are now so kind to Ameri∣ca, we can't quite forget how the English differed in opinion with us about Corsica; and if our court is so liberal to Dr Franklyn, does not his Britannic Majesty support poor Paoli?</P>
<P>I begin to think it's high time we should furnish his Majesty with a mistress in our interests; for, though the Queen, who is quite our friend, governs him pretty well at present, it cannot be reasonably supposed, that a wife can long retain her influence. I must talk to <HI>Du Thé</HI> on this subject—some woman must always go∣vern France; and whether Madame Maintenon was a wife, or a mistress, she equally refuted the Salic law.</P>
<P>It will be very prudent to hire a good quantity of poets, painters, sculptors, and engravers, to keep his Majesty in good humour with himself, and chace away all melancholy thoughts from Versailles. On every occasion of bad news, it will be necessary to give va∣riety to adulation. Sometimes to present his Majesty with an ode or two, in which he shall be ranked with the Jupiters, the Apollos, the Alexanders, &amp;c.—at o∣ther times to surpass, if possible, the flattering pencil of Le Brun—now to represent in allegory, his protection of America, under the form of a fountain, with thir∣teen spouts watering thirteen laurels—Invention must be racked for new designs in medals; for example, his Majesty binding thirteen faggots—His Majesty a colos∣sus, one foot at Paris, the other at Philadelphia. The misfortune is, it will be almost impossible to invent no∣velties; for, while Louis XIV. was at war with the Hollanders, he had almost as many medals in honour
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>of his love of liberty, as he suffered defeats for actually combating against it. However, if medals can't be managed well, we may try what tapestry can do. Col∣bert was a cunning Scot, and certainly founded the Gobelins, as a new resource for flattery. We must improve on this system, and new hang the Louvre with worsted laurels over the thirteen American stripes in∣terspersed with fleur de lys.</P>
<P>Neckar either has a little too much conscience, or he deceives people very artfully; for he refuses any salary for his office; yet, if he has no douceurs, no bribes, no contracts, how very false the old proverb is, <HI>point d' argent point de Suisse!</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to receive your commands, con∣veyed in the most obliging manner, by your secre∣tary. The connections which some years residence here has enabled me to form, assisted by the introduc∣tions you have so judiciously pointed out, may give me some few occasions of making discoveries, not wholly unworthy your attention. But, I must own, I fear these will be but few; were I employed in this kind of <HI>secret embassy,</HI> by almost any one but Monsieur de Sartine, I might, perhaps, magnify trifles, and repeat trite details, with an officiousness and mystery sufficient
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>to promote my own interest. But, when I write to you, what event can I communicate, which your wis∣dom will not have foreseen? What opinions can I suggest, that can be new to your understanding? This difficulty would be great in any country: In England it has double force.—Alas! in these times, a spy's office here is almost a sinecure: A dozen news-papers in the morning, and as many fresh ones every evening, rob us of all our business: A secret, even in private affairs, is a prodigy in London; but, as to public matters, it is the patriot's boast, that a free constitu∣tion abhors secrecy: And so, indeed, it seems; for, not only the minutest accounts of the army, the navy, and the taxes, but the minister's letters, official in∣structions, and, in short, every paper, the disclosure of which may serve opposition, and tend to prejudice the ministers, by a premature discovery of their plans, are perpetually called for, and must lie on the tables of Parliament; where, as soon as they are once brought, their contents, one way or other, get into print; consequently, a few days after they are pu∣blished, the French ministers are not only as much in possession of them as the English, but study them far more attentively, and to ten times more advantage, than <HI>they</HI> do who called for their disclosure in Eng∣land.—All this is bad encouragement to a spy at London. News-papers, pamphlets, parliamentary de∣bates, remembrancers, and all the infinite variety of periodical libels, under the conduct of our good friend Mr Almon, leave but a scanty and beaten field of po∣litics for private discovery. To be of any real use, I must limit my researches to the secret motives, and
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>concealed interests of the contending factions. The English themselves publish the text of politics—I must write the comment. Engaged as we are m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a war, which the speeches, writings, predictions, and menaces of the opposition in England have led us to attempt, it will be of most consequence to penetrate their in∣tentions, to trace their true designs, and, in sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, to be a <HI>spy on their hearts;</HI> a study to which a dis∣banded Jesuit has, perhaps, the best key, by consul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his own. I am invited to dine with Lord Shelburne in a few days; after which, I shall seize the first occa∣sion to transmit my next despatches; happy to give every testimony of my perfect respect and attachment to Mr de Sartine.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU shou'd have heard from me before now, but, as I cou'd not safely write by the post, I waited for this private conveyance; particularly as I wished to acknowledge, in the most secure manner, your goodness in allowing me to draw for 200 Luidores par avance—A few days after I wrote to you last, I dined with Lord Shelburne. Monsr. — spoke of me so favourably to his friend Dr Price, the celebrated calculator, that the Dr advised his Lordship to invite me—It was on the 30th January, a kind of festival to all true republicans—I went with Dr Price; and when we were announced, we found his Lordship in his li∣brary, with the whole Shelburne party; that is to say,
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>with his two friends Col. Barré and Counsellor Dun∣ning.—These great statesmen were rather oddly em∣ployed—They were attending to Dr Priestley on a lec∣ture of electricity, which I found however had some reference to politics. At first indeed they only tried experiments of curiosity—one of them was ridiculous enough—They put the Orator Dunning on a little stool with glass legs. He is fat and short; and put me in mind of Dr Last's examination in Foot's Devil on Two Sticks—I asked whether they put him there to harangue; when Lord Shelburne very obsigingly di∣rected me to put my finger to the orator's nose, from which, to my great displeasure, sparks slew out; so that I immediately suspected this machine was con∣structed to light up his countenance: But they told me this was only a prologue before the operation, which now came on; for he descended from the stool, and they put a wire round his neck to pass the electric fire through his throat; for this orator is husky, and Dr Priestley flatters himself that these manoeuvres con∣tinued regularly for a few years, may at last dissolve the phlegm, and restore his voice—As soon as these philosophical politics were over, Col. Barré entered in∣to conversation with me—A man of abilities, but very noisy!—However, I was very happy to find he had a most extensive acquaintance in France, and indeed in all quarters of the globe; though I own, when he told me he was particularly intimate with you, I was rather a∣stonished that you had never given me a hint of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though I have not the slightest acquaintance with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ond, I'll not disclaim it—perhaps I may improve on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>.—
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>The Colonel has a fine voice for the eloquence of op∣position—a deep base to express the doubts and fears of a patriot, and the cadence of muttering thunder to threaten <HI>a minister.</HI> With these two orators alone, Lord Shelburne shares his councils and his hopes; and not injudiciously; for the one has the reputation of being the best advocate <HI>in a bad cause,</HI> and the other is cer∣tainly the best story-teller in Europe.—You see then, this party is a little exposed to division and jealousy. Indeed they are tolerably secure of unanimity; at least, of a greater degree of it than any other party—How∣ever, a few subaltern friends might give them more effect; for, at present, they seem like three admirals without any vessels under their conduct; but they are too proud to be united to any set of men, ministers or opposition.—His Lordship indeed is a kind of minister by <HI>anticipation,</HI> and his time at present is a rehearsal of what he hopes it will actually be at last; he practi∣ses the <HI>etiquette</HI> of greatness in his own house; he treats his private company as they were at his pu∣blic levee; he addresses them <HI>en routine;</HI> he proportions his smiles, and gives a limited quantity of compliments suitable to their different ranks; affecting to adapt himself and accommodate his conversation to the level of his audience.</P>
<P>As far as I can judge, he is very fond of passing for the Maecenas of England; he would be thought to encourage all the fine arts; and, if a new kind of mouse-trap was invented, he would be mortified not to be thought the patron of so useful an artist; his conversation, which turns mostly on politics, is a med∣ley of the sentiments and sayings of his two friends, and
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>his two philosophers; so that he seems a talking Ency∣clopoedie, where the different subjects of the composition are supplied by the proper professors; the <HI>art militaire,</HI> and <HI>knowledge of the world,</HI> by Col. Barré the tricks and subtile distinctions of law by Mr Dunning; philoso∣phy and scepticism by Dr Priestley; and political para∣doxes by my friend Dr Price.—All this cannot fail of making out something striking, though not original; we admire the picture, though the trees are done by one, the cattle by another, and the figures by a third, and so on; for the design at least is great, and the combi∣nation of such scattered beauties is curious and splen∣did—My Lord himself studies finances most; he has all kinds of lists of all kinds of things; and he had the goodness to tell me, in confidence, that he has disco∣vered so many thousand fresh subjects for taxes, that he could quite charm the nation with new imposts, if he was but once minister. So attentive is he to these calculations, that he thinks of them at all times and places; and he assured the House of Lords, in a de∣bate about America, that he rode out every day in Hyde-park to ascertain more precisely the proportion∣able number of horses in England, by calculating those in Middlesex, in order to a general tax on saddles and bridles.—How far such a party as this can serve the French ministers, by attacking those of England, I leave it to your superior sagacity to determine: It is to me a much less doubtful point, how far they would serve you, if they were ministers themselves.—I hope soon to give you some sketch of the <HI>Rockingham Party;</HI> in the mean time, I remain, with the utmost respect, your's, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I AM but just returned from a tedious levee of the Queen's, where your American Ambassadors had their first audience—a sincere head-ach might plead my excuse for not fulfilling my promise of writing—But I know you are anxious to hear how their Excel∣lencies are liked, or rather <HI>tolerated</HI>—Considering all, then, pretty well!—But, indeed, you must thank the Countess <HI>Jule de Polignac</HI> and me for it—for, it was no very easy matter to persuade her Majesty to <HI>endure</HI> them. The Countess and myself stood very close to her, by way of precaution. Unluckily, <HI>Madamoiselle Bertin</HI> had been with her all the morning, and you know how the milliners abhor an English war.—She had ridiculed these ambassadors so humorously, that, when they made their <HI>entrée,</HI> her Majesty was very near laughing.—The truth is, my dear friend, they were villanously dressed; and, I don't know how it happened, but none of them looked like gentlemen. It was all in vain to talk of simplicity of manners! of greatness of mind! and contempt of forms! <Q><HI>Ma foi</HI> “”(dit la Reine) <HI>il faut avouer ce n'est que de la canaille</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be injustice to her Majesty, to attempt any translation of so inimitable an expression.</NOTE>!</Q> However I pointed to Dr Franklin's white hat, as the emblem of innocence; and the Countess of Poli∣gnac to his spectacles, (one of which was broken), as
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>that of oeconomy. Assuredly, said her Majesty, thie Dr Franklin is '<HI>bien singulier</HI> en toutes chose.' We laughed at this turn, which put her in good humour; and the <HI>Duke de Coigny,</HI> who was standing by, assured her Majesty that this <HI>singular</HI> Doctor, with his white hat, and broken spectacles, could, nevertheless, bottle lightening, and uncork it as fatally as Pandora opened her box, or Ulysses's friends united the boraccio; at which we all laughed; because none of us understood it.—In short, we have contrived pretty well for the present; but do, my dear friend, send these barbarous ambassadors some taylors and hair-dressers; and pray encourage his Excellency, the Doctor, to have his spectacles mended.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVERY day I am more convinced how hard a task it is to discover valuable secrets. You seemed aware of this, when you pointed out people whom you thought could assist me in my embassy. At the head of this list was Mons. <HI>Le Tessier.</HI> I had my first audience of him at his hotel in Market-lane; and this was the result. He assured me he still loved his country, but, at present, this love must be a little su∣spended, for he was now director of the opera, and had solemnly bound himself to his patrons, never to speak or write about politics; besides all the leisure
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>time he had was devoted to learning the rudiments of the English language in the morning, in order to criti∣cise the best and most refined works in it in the evening.—I told him, though this might check out conferring in public, yet we might have nightly conferences. 'Ah! Mons. he cried, recollect <HI>Baumarchais</HI> and <HI>De∣on!</HI> If you and I were to meet in this way, it would renew the idea of a <HI>spy wedding,</HI> and one of us must forfeit the dignity of being thought of the male gender.' —Still he assured me, he loved his country and Mons. <HI>De Sartine.</HI> And, at last, he hit on a method, without breaking his promise to his patrons, to communicate secrets quite in a new way, more curious than hints in hieroglyphics, or libels in lemon juice—And how is this? you will say. Why, in short, merely by the fashion of dressing his hair—Of dressing his hair!—Yes, it is so; for, having fixed on our plan of signals, I can now, with the assistance of a good glass, even a∣cross the opera-house, interpret his thoughts on politics by the <HI>position</HI> and <HI>number</HI> of his curls—For example—as stocks are likely to fall or rise, <HI>they,</HI> too, will mount or descend above or below his ear, which hence will become a kind of barometer, or graduated scale for all the variations of public gambling,—so, too, I shall see by their <HI>extention</HI> or <HI>contraction,</HI> whether ministers will be <HI>rigid</HI> or <HI>relaxed</HI> towards America; and, by aug∣menting or diminishing their number, he can convey to me his opinions whether factions will become more or less numerous, which is the material point during the sittings of parliament.—I wished, indeed, that he would improve on this last idea, and set apart the dif∣ferent sides of his head to express his remarks on the opposite parties in politics; the right, for the ministry,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>the left, for opposition; one set of buckles for the whigs, and the opposite for the tories; and so compare the Ayes and the Noes by the different proportion of buckles on the opposite ears—But this, he said, was exacting too much—and, even, if Mrs Hubbard could be reconciled to such a paradox in hair-dressing, the very novelty might alarm suspicion, and lead to detec∣tion—However, he will be very correct in what he does communicate, and, for that reason, he now calls his valet de chambre his secretary, as he is to copy out the ideas of his head on his hair.—Thus, Sir, you see how difficult it is to profit even by our friends; and on what delicate distinctions my sources of intelligence must depend: Yet I shall avail myself as much as I can of them, in order to obey your commands.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the variety of important concerns which demand your Grace's attention, I cannot be surprised, that so inferior a consideration, as the interest of a private individual, should escape your recollection. But per∣mit me to remind your Grace, that, at a moment when the victory of the 27th of July is the theme of public applause, the honour of the nation is, in some degree, concerned, in rewarding my humble, though successful counsels—Had it not been for my advice, the equipment of that fleet, which has gained you
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>such immortal honour, might have been greatly re∣tarded, if not absolutely prevented. Your Grace will recollect, that it was my suggestion, and mine a∣lone, to put copies of the <HI>order of the anchorage of Brest</HI> aboard those vessels which were taken by the English—I foresaw they would be deceived, and alarmed—The event exceeded my most sanguine expectations—The English fleet steered home; and ours was equip∣ped without molestation.—I trust your Grace will, by recommending me for promotion, give me occasion to <HI>act,</HI> as well as <HI>advise.</HI></P>

<P>ALAS!

<P>THE Reader may possibly expect the letter on the Rockingham party, which the spy promised in one of his former<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d spatches; but the Editor has found it impossible to publish it. It is true, there was one in the box upon this subject, but very much blotted and erased: As far as it could be made out, it appeared very severe on this Rockingham party, as they are called.—Possibly Sartine might have thought that such professed enemies of the English, were of course, the best friends of the English ministry, and accordingly effaced this satire against his own interest; or, perhaps, politeness conquered party; and, though the ludicrous account of the Shelburnites did not much offend him, he entirely disapproved of serious personalities, upon any subject or occasion.—However it was, he had blot∣ted out some words, and left others remaining—for example, there seemed to have been (but it was scarce∣ly intelligible) a good deal at first about aristocracy, and against the obsolete pretensions of some noblemen, who think they are perfectly qualified for Ministers in these times, because their relations were plain, honest people last century.—This was half rubb'd out, but near it, <HI>hereditary virtue</HI> was very legible. There was a question, why the descendants of Dutch families,
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>should pretend to lead his present Majesty, merely be∣cause their ancestors were King William's followers; or why George the Third should prefer two or three Dukes now a days, because Charles the Second was fond of their great grand-mothers.—This too had the pen drawn across it; and over it, Sartine had written in capital letters—STAUNCH, OLD WHIGS.</P>
<P>Close to the names of Grenville and Burke, I could just make out <HI>stamp act</HI> and <HI>declaratory law,</HI> and a word or two about inconsistency and party; but these were followed by a long string of compliments on wisdom and eloquence. There seemed to be a kind of allegory about this party; it was called an hospital for invalid Admirals and Generals; a parliamentary Chelsea for wounded honour, and decayed reputation: Sartine had blotted this too, by way of keeping up a light and shade, in this mutilated manuscript, for the character which followed, were youthful indiscretion, and <HI>Newmarket</HI> were the only words erased in whole pages of panegyric.</P>
<P>By way of postscript, the spy had given a list of those who were always to be admitted to Lord Rocking∣ham's levee; this it seems his wife had obtained by vi∣siting Lady Rockingham's femme de chambre, who had got a copy from the Marquis's porter; it was torn, but, on the fragments, I saw Mr Burke, Mr Nollikins, Mr Charles Turner, the Duke of Grafton, Jack Lee, Jack Ryder, Sir George Howard, and, at the corner, <HI>Captain</HI> Walsingham, with a quaere as to the <HI>Colonel.</HI></P>

<P>YOUR affection for the King, our master, your disinterested love of your country, and the

So much with respect to the trade of France. Our revenue, you well know, in time of <HI>peace,</HI> is not equal to our ex∣pence.—In 1769, the expences exceeded the revenue by 30 millions—In 1770, they mounted to 70 mil∣lions, when L'Abbe Terray made the great reductions,

<P>Thus, it appears, that we are, the first year of a war, burthened with an excess in our expence of 30 millions of livres.</P>
<P>Here is, my dear friend, a short state of our finan∣ces; and, though we borrowed only forty millions last year, (in order to impress our enemies with an idea, that we are less in want of money than <HI>themselves,</HI> and that our fellow-subjects might not too early ex∣claim against a war, from fresh burthens laid upon them, before it was scarcely commenced) we must borrow <HI>immensely</HI> and <HI>immediately,</HI> if we mean to con∣tinue
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>it.

<P>The expences of our fleet last year were enormous, without any advantages from it. The repairs of it, in consequence of the action of the 27th of July, I under∣stand, will be equal to half the original cost of it—Could we send out, this summer, ships for a channel squadron, we could not man them—The English have in their goals the seamen we expected to obtain from the arrival of our fleets—In a word, Spain will not join us—the Americans are ruined—we cannot lend them money, nor send them any assistance—our trade is ruined—we are upon the eve of another national bank∣ruptey, and it is only an immediate peace that can save this country.</P>

<P>Certainly we two could write notes on the <HI>Noblesse Commerçante</HI>—yet, don't we deserve some consolation for all our toils? For my own part, I am wearied of such complicated intrigues. Perpetual hypocrisy is a fatiguing business—I am tired of wearing the courtier's masque so constantly—It will refresh me to drop it for a moment, with my friend. Alas! Vergennes, why did we listen to this Baumarchais? His wild specula∣tions involved us with these cursed Americans; they
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>got in debt with us, and it became necessary, at any rate, to plunge France in a war, to give us a chance of getting paid—What obstacles did we meet for a long time, to all our attempts! The King, fond of pleasure and ease, wished to enjoy both himself, and to commu∣nicate both to his subjects. On his accession, he found the nation exhausted by a long ruinous war—Bank∣rupts in honour as well as property—the public spirit broken, and the public credit destroyed—Yet, under such a sovereign, guided by the wisdom and experience of Maurepas, France might once more have recovered from her wounds; while the rich products of the East and West India trades, established by Colbert as our best resources, flowed into all her harbours, dispensing wealth and industry, from the prince to the peasant. What art did it require, to persuade his Majesty to forego such certain happiness for the wild speculation of an American alliance!—At length, the English army <HI>piled up their arms at Saratoga,</HI> and ambition could no longer resist the temptation—Still, however, Neckar doubted—But arithmetic yielded to flattery—The Queen loved to controul—we promised to support her, and she managed his Majesty—But what have all these machinations produced? Pondicherry and St Lucie are lost, or, in other words, the East and West Indies; for we have no force in the one, and D'Estaign is blocked up in the other—We have remonstrances from bankrupts at Bourdeaux—petitions from wooden-leg∣ged captains, or their wooden-shoed widows—The first you can manage—but Montbarry is tired of the others. The young officers, who at first talked of nothing but exalting the fleur de lis, and treading down the English
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>lion, get tired of this business—They want to come to Paris—they want to come to the opera, to the Queen's ball, to their mistresses, to the horse races; to be any where, in short, but at country quarters—The King teazes me for victories—The Queen says, the Doctor's spectacles must be mended—Maurepas shakes his head —Neckar calculates, and frowns—The Spanish ambas∣sador says nothing—Above all,</P>

<HEAD>SKETCH of the SUMMER CAMPAIGN.</HEAD>
<P>—JERSEY—a coup de main.—The militia will certainly run away—the Governor not come, till the whole business is over—This can't fail of suc∣cess —What a fine gazette it will make for our friends in American <HI>Jersey!</HI></P>
<P>—Invasion of Ireland—people mostly papists; but unluckily for us, as well off now as the protestants— However, our friends in the opposition promise, some how or other, to make them rebel—One of them has engaged to set their priests to work, particularly Fa∣ther —The Irish should be taught to com∣pare themselves to the Americans—a Congress might be held in Dublin, Sir <HI>Edward Newenham</HI> president —We must write to order two or three harangues in the English parliament, to spirit up the Irish army to mutiny—I wish we could make our own people forget <HI>Thurot's</HI> name—The worst of all is, the Irish are a nation of blunderers; and, though they should even invite us to join them, it is more than probable they'd mistake us for enemies, as soon as we got there; and with the same blundering folly, prefer the safety and honour of England, to the unambitious disinterested friendship of France.</P>
<P>—In the course of the summer, a descent on Southampton and Brighthelmstone, in the bathing season, may give us some eclat, and it will keep up the
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>spirits of our young officers, to storm the ball rooms, or enter the bathing houses sword in hand.</P>
<P>As to a <HI>grand fleet,</HI> the merchants will murmur, if we dont't make some parade about their interests, though all the mischief is done already; for the En∣glish privateers have seized above twelve millions Ster∣ling of their property—Besides, even if we can man a grand fleet, D'Orvilliers disdains to stay in the English channel. After his victory, as he called it, last sum∣mer, he thought even the Atlantic too narrow for his own glory, or his sovereign's ambition. Yet all the <HI>business</HI> is done in this <HI>English Channel,</HI> as those islan∣ders have the insolence to call it.</P>
<P>—We must garrison our coast towns very care∣fully;—for, as soon as Jersey is taken, the English will try to retaliate—not that they are very fond of coming too near our coast; but still we must take care; for nothing could make us so ridiculous in the eyes of all Europe, as a ship or two of theirs coming under our forts, to burn and seize our men of war and our mer∣chant ships.</P>
<P>If D'Estaign beats Byron, we'll send for him home to burn Portsmouth—for no one but D'Estaign is worthy to finish what John the Painter began.</P>
<P>We are very much puzzled what forts to attack,—<HI>Dover Castle</HI> is impregnable; <HI>Tuffnell</HI> commands there!—<HI>Scilly</HI> would be a desperate business; <HI>Egerton</HI> is prepared for us!—<HI>Tilbury</HI> indeed would be easy e∣nough, if we cou'd once get there.—Many are for attacking <HI>The Cinque Ports,</HI> because Lord North is governor!—They say he has a trick of salling asleep on his post—Its true enough he doe sleep; but, I'm
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>afraid, like the lion, to crush his enemies when he awakes.—<HI>Fort William</HI> we can easily reduce—for our old enemy Mr Rigby says, Governour Bur∣goyne can only fight for the congress now.—The Tower wou'd be best of all, if we cou'd sail up the by night.—Lord Cornwallis will be as tedious and circuitous in answering General Howe's <HI>inquiries,</HI> as the General was in getting to Philadelphia, so he'll have no time to think of us—and if we once take the Tower, it will be particularly pleasant to ransack the armoury, where this proud people have preserved so many spoils of their former glory, and our unaccount∣able defeats.—So much for Europe—as to Ame∣rica—</P>

<HEAD>Her <HI>MAJESTY</HI>'S Answer to My Letters, inclosing <HI>MAU∣REPAS</HI>' and <HI>NECKAR</HI>'S.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>S—</P>
<P>I HAVE studied very attentively the letter you sent me.—That Maurepas and Neckar should hold such language, does not in the least surprise me, but that you should seen affected by their apprehensions, is a point I cannot account for.—The King, you say, appears to be out of spirits with the war.—I grant it; and am rather pleased he is so; for it will incline him still less to interfere in the management of it. Had the commencement of it been marked with any very encouraging circumstances, it is probable, he might have become more alert and inquisitive in the business, than would have suited either my ambition or your interest. No, Sartine! let us once establish our party, by whatever means, in the management of this war, and doubt not but we shall soon have victories and triumphs to compensate for a little present disgrace.—Ask Vergennes whether he does not think as I do on this subject.—Or, should we even be forced to aban∣don our system, we may at all times negotiate with equal advantage: Nay, the <HI>Duke de Nivernois</HI> asserts,
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>(and, I think, he is justified in it), that the more un∣successful the war is on our part, the more secure we shall be of an advantageous peace.—The English, from a foolish affectation of magnanimity, acquire humility from triumphs; so that the more victories they gain, the fewer concessions they require.—They will never beat us out of our ability to conquer them in treaties.</P>
<P>So far for your statesmen's timid and desponding arguments.—But to the letter, which you inclose me from the officious Bishop of — I scarcely think a reply can be necessary. He begins with expressions of the highest admiration at the spirit and genius which he affects to discover in me, and which he pro∣nounces to be so extraordinary from my youth and sex.—He instances, in a very flattering style, the glo∣rious effects of female enterprise and ability, from Assyrian Semiramis to Russian Catharine; and then deliberately enters upon a formal panegyric on the su∣perior virtue and beauty of retired dignity and do∣mestic felicity: A situation, which, with more zeal than argument, he asserts, will yield the truest fame to a wedded Princess: And, with a provoking confi∣dence, rests his proofs on the single instance of Char∣lotte of England.</P>
<P>Tell the good Bishop I have no objection to his style, nor to his introduction: But I had rather have him for my historian than my counsellor. Assure him, however, that I very thankfully accept all his compliments; and reject nothing but his doctrine.</P>
<P>Were I inclined to debate the point with him, as a matter of argument only, inexperienced as I am, I should not doubt but that the better reasons would
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>appear on my side. It is scarcely possible for a wo∣man, whom Fate has destined to partake a throne, to be capable, much less desirous, of deriving her hap∣piness from the tranquil duties, and frivolous enjoy∣ments, which suit the sphere, and constitute the habits of those in a less exalted state. From her infancy, her desires and expectations are moulded on a diffe∣rent biass—her cradle is watched with more jealousy than affection, and her maturer age is looked forward to, not with the fond anticipation of parental love, but with the interested impatience of political speculation.—The cultivation of her mind is on principles which oppose the growth of every tender plant which the hand of Nature has placed there—the seedlings of gentle affection and sympathetic fondness, are torn out as weeds. She must accustom herself to be without choice in the most important interests of life.—She must not think of love—nor can imagine the being loved.—She has no inducements to form attachments of friend∣ship in a country she will be compelled to leave; nor can her filial affection be great, when she considers that her <HI>happiness</HI> is but a secondary object to her pa∣rents. At length the state requires its sacrifice of her, and she is wedded without choice.—From that mo∣ment, observe the curious justice that is exacted from her: <Q>You are now to attach your mind to domestic “delights—You are now to cultivate affection and social love—Avoid all interference in matters of state. Private virtues and accomplishments are a Queen's best ornaments; nothing beyond is amiable; no∣thing ”engaging.</Q>—In this manner, I remember, did my great aunt — harangue me on my
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>leaving Vienna; and the good Bishop appears to be a teacher of the same persuasion. But, is there sense or reason in supposing that the constitution of the mind can at once be so entirely changed? Can it instantly repossess itself of those feelings and inclina∣tions which every attempt had been made to era∣dicate?—When in earliest spring you have killed the root, will you call for the luxuriance of a summer's shade? In all other situations of life, the force of ha∣bit and education is admitted.—No person in Paris marrying a girl, who, from her infancy, has been bred at St Cyr, expects to find at once the manners and principles of a finished <HI>precieuse;</HI> as reasonably might the beau at Pekin require, that the maid, who, to at∣tain one species of beauty, has been cramped and crip∣pled from her cradle, should dance at her marriage, with the activity of a Chinese <HI>Heinel</HI>—From those only who are born to royalty, are such inconsistencies re∣quired—We are readily suffered to consider ourselves as creatures of a political relation and importance, till it is the interest of the state to portion us into exile—But is the <HI>Queen</HI> to be still more insignificant than the <HI>Princess?</HI> Is the <HI>policy</HI> of her marriage the only state-business she is capable of understanding? Was the <HI>ne∣gotiation</HI> for her affection the last she is to be consulted in? Is she to be related to the empire on whose throne she sits, only by the alliance she has given it? And, in short, to be made use of in the grand political engine, as the <HI>pivot</HI> on which nations are united and brought into co-operation; yet, in the working of it, to be de∣nied the credit of being a part of the machine? I wish those, who are so desirous of seeing such a prodigy of
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>domestic majesty, would also draw out the plan on which so amiable a scheme is to be carried into execu∣tion—I confess myself, that I have no very accurate ideas of a Paris Penelope—Perhaps, to give the true dignity to such a state, they would have the whole bu∣siness of domestic felicity and conjugal tenderness, be∣tween a royal pair, conducted with the same ceremony with which the alliance commenced. And, really, it would be an injustice, that they, whose obedient affec∣tions were won by proxy and embassies, should be put to the fatigue of supporting the tender connection without similar interferences. On this plan, a due dig∣nity might still be preserved—the form of demanding an <HI>audience</HI> should precede each familiar <HI>visit;</HI> and no <HI>private conference</HI> should ever degenerate into a <HI>teté a teté—Billet-deux embassies</HI> might be frequent, through which the soft intercourse of sighs and compliments might be carried on with a suitable decorum—<HI>Exclusive treaties,</HI> with regard to smiles and the <HI>doux yeux,</HI> would be adjusted by a <HI>pacte de famille;</HI> and, though no ap∣pearance of favouritism should exist, yet the sovereign might be permitted to <HI>kiss hands on being presented</HI>—with an heir—It would be unpolite to require the con∣stancy of either to be <HI>guarantéed</HI>—However, on the absence of the Monarch, he might appoint a resident, with limited powers, or to act only as <HI>chargé des affairs.</HI></P>
<P>Excuse my writing with such levity; but there is a ridicule in the injustice of all arguments against the privileges of our sex, of what ever rank, which makes it impossible to answer them with seriousness.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
<P>—In short, I have considered what pursuits are best calculated to give satisfaction to my own mind.—I feel no real delight in the elegant dissipations of a court, though I affect to lead them. The admiration I receive is too much chastised by respect to situation, to flatter mere female vanity; the gratifying which is the only true inducement to be graceful or amiable.—To deter me from the pursuit of politics, or a desire of governing, let such dull moralists as the Bi∣shop quote the Salic law, and all the common place in∣ferences which ungallant policy has drawn from it.—On a true female spirit it must act rather as an induce∣ment.—It would be impious in any of us to pre∣tend that the <HI>Original Interdiction</HI> would have opera∣ted otherwise on our minds than it did on our first parents: And had Eve partaken of a throne in a coun∣try like France, the mere provocation of the <HI>Salic Law</HI> would have prevented her knowing rest till she had acquired a share in the government.—</P>
