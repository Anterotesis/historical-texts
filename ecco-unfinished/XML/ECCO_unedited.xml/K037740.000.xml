<P>IT was a real Desire to do good, amongst a very large and useful Body of People, that gave Rise to this little Piece. The Author thought the Stage, where the Bad might be disgrac'd, and the Good rewarded, the most ready and effectual Me∣thod for this Purpose: And, as he never wrote before in the Dramatic Way, and was unwilling to be known, he was happy in recommending the Per∣formance, by the Assistance of a Friend, to the Care and Judgment of Mr. GARRICK.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Country Boy! ha, ha, ha. How long has this Scheme been in your Head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some Time — I am now convinc'd of what you have often been hinting to me, that I am confoundedly cheated by my Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! are you satisfied at last, Mr. <HI>Lovel?</HI> I al∣ways told you, that there is not a worse Set of Ser∣vants in the Parish of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, than in your Kitchen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis with some Difficulty I believe it now, Mr. <HI>Freeman;</HI> tho', I must own, my Expences often
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>make me stare — <HI>Philip,</HI> I am sure, Is an honest Fellow; and I will swear for my Blacks — If there is a Rogue among my Folks, it is that surly Dog <HI>Tom.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken in every one. <HI>Philip</HI> is an hy∣pocritical Rascal: <HI>Tom</HI> has a good deal of surly Ho∣nesty about him: and for your Blacks, they are as bad as your Whites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, <HI>Freeman,</HI> how came you to be so well acquainted with my People? None of the Wenches are handsome enough to move the Affections of a middle-aged Gentleman as you are. Ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a young Man, Mr. <HI>Lovel,</HI> and take a Pride in a Number of idle, unnecessary Servants, who are the Plague and Reproach of this King∣dom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEL.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Charles,</HI> You are an old-fashion'd Fellow. Ser∣vants a Plague and Reproach! ha, ha, ha. I would have forty more, if my House would hold them. Why, Man, in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> before I was ten Years old, I had an hundred Blacks kissing my Feet every Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You Gentry of the Western Isles are high mettled ones, and love Pomp and Parade — I have seen it delight your Soul, when the People in the Street have stared at your Equipage; especially if they whispered loud enough to be heard, <Q>That is “”'Squire <HI>Lovel,</HI> the great <HI>West Indian.</HI></Q> Ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be very sorry if we were as splenetic as you Northern Islanders, who are devoured with Me∣lancholy and Fog. Ha, ha, ha. No, Sir, we are
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>Children of the Sun, and are born to diffuse the bounteous Favours which our noble Parent is pleased to bestow on us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you had more of your noble Parent's Re∣gularity, and less of his Fire. As it is, you con∣sume so fast, that not one in twenty of you live to be fifty Years old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in that fifty we live two hundred, my Dear; mark that.—But to Business—I am resolv'd upon my Frolick.—I will know whether my Servants are Rogues or not. If they are, I'll bastinado the Rascals; if not, I think I ought to pay for my Impertinence. —Pray tell me; is not your <HI>Robert</HI> acquainted with my People? Perhaps he may give a little Light into the thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the Truth, Mr. <HI>Lovel,</HI> your Servants are so abandoned, that I have forbid him your House — However, if you have a Mind to ask him any Question, he shall be forth coming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall; but it is an hundred to one if you get any thing out of him; for, though he is a very honest Fellow, yet he is so much of a Servant, that he'll never tell any thing to the Disadvantage of another — Who waits? <STAGE><HI>[Enter Servant.]</HI></STAGE> Send <HI>Robert</HI> to me — <STAGE><HI>[Exit Servant.]</HI></STAGE> And what was it determined you upon this Project at last?</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, <HI>Charles,</HI> I must thank you for my Frolick — It has been a wholesome one to me — Have I done right?</P>

<SPEAKER>LOVEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Persons of Rank would act up to their Stan∣dard, it would be impossible that their Servants could ape them — But when they affect every thing that is ridiculous, it will be in the Power of any low Creature to follow their Example.</P>
