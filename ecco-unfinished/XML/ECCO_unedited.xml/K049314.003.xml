<HEAD>THE
EXPEDITION
OF
HUMPHRY CLINKER.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD be very ungrateful, dear
Lewis, if I did not find myself dis∣posed
to think and speak favourably of
this people, among whom I have met with
more kindness, hospitality, and rational
entertainment, in a few weeks, than ever
I received in any other country during
the whole course of my life.—Perhaps,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
the gratitude excited by these benefits
may interfere with the impartiality of my
remarks; for a man is as apt to be pre∣possessed
by particular favours as to be
prejudiced by private motives of disgust.
If I am partial, there is, at least, some me∣rit
in my conversion from illiberal preju∣dices
which had grown up with my con∣stitution.</P>
<P>The first impressions which an English∣man
receives in this country, will not
contribute to the removal of his preju∣dices;
because he refers every thing he
sees to a comparison with the same articles
in his own country; and this comparison
is unfavourable to Scotland in all its ex∣teriors,
such as the face of the country in
respect to cultivation, the appearance of
the bulk of the people, and the language
of conversation in general.—I am not so
far convinced by Mr. Lismahago's argu∣ments,
but that I think the Scots would
do well, for their own sakes, to adopt the
English idioms and pronunciation; those
of them especially, who are resolved to
push their fortunes in South-Britain.—
I know, by experience, how easily an
Englishman is influenced by the ear, and
how apt he is to laugh, when he hears his
own language spoken with a foreign or
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
provincial accent.—I have known a mem∣ber
of the house of commons speak with
great energy and precision, without being
able to engage attention, because his ob∣servations
were made in the Scotch dia∣lect,
which (no offence to lieutenant Lis∣mahago)
certainly gives a clownish air
even to sentiments of the greatest dignity
and decorum.—I have declared my opi∣nion
on this head to some of the most
sensible men of this country, observing,
at the same time, that if they would em∣ploy
a few natives of England to teach the
pronunciation of our vernacular tongue,
in twenty years there would be no diffe∣rence,
in point of dialect, between the
youth of Edinburgh and of London.</P>
<P>The civil regulations of this kingdom
and metropolis are taken from very dif∣ferent
models from those of England, ex∣cept
in a few particular establishments,
the necessary consequences of the union.
—Their college of justice is a bench of
great dignity, filled with judges of cha∣racter
and ability.—I have heard some
causes tried before this venerable tribu∣nal;
and was very much pleased with the
pleadings of their advocates, who are by
no means deficient either in argument or
elocution. The Scottish legislation is
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
founded, in a great measure, on the civil
law; consequently, their proceedings vary
from those of the English tribunals; but,
I think, they have the advantage of us
in their method of examining witnesses
apart, and in the constitution of their
jury, by which they certainly avoid the
evil which I mentioned in my last from
Lismahago's observation.</P>
<P>The university of Edinburgh is sup∣plied
with excellent professors in all the
sciences; and the medical school, in par∣ticular,
is famous all over Europe.—The
students of this art have the best opportu∣nity
of learning it to perfection, in all its
branches, as there are different courses
for the <HI>theory of medicine,</HI> and the <HI>practice
of medicine;</HI> for <HI>anatomy, chemistry, botany,</HI>
and the <HI>materia medica,</HI> over and above
those of <HI>mathematics</HI> and <HI>experimental phi∣losophy;</HI>
and all these are given by men of
distinguished talents. What renders this
part of education still more complete, is
the advantage of attending the infirmary,
which is the best instituted charitable
foundation that I ever knew. Now we
are talking of charities, here are several
hospitals, exceedingly well endowed, and
maintained under admirable regulations;
and these are not only useful, but orna∣mental
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
to the city. Among these, I shall
only mention the general work-house, in
which all the poor, not otherwise provided
for, are employed, according to their dif∣ferent
abilities, with such judgment and
effect, that they nearly maintain them∣selves
by their labour, and there is not a
beggar to be seen within the precincts of
this metropolis. It was Glasgow that set
the example of this establishment, about
thirty years ago.—Even the kirk of Scot∣land,
so long reproached with fanatacism
and canting, abounds at present with mi∣nisters
celebrated for their learning, and
respectable for their moderation.—I have
heard their sermons with equal astonish∣ment
and pleasure.—The good people of
Edinburgh no longer think dirt and cob∣webs
essential to the house of God.—Some
of their churches have admitted such or∣naments
as would have excited sedition,
even in England, a little more than a
century ago; and psalmody is here prac∣tised
and taught by a professor from the
cathedral of Durham:—I should not be
surprised, in a few years, to hear it ac∣companied
with an organ.</P>
<P>Edinburgh is a hot-bed of genius.—
I have had the good fortune to be made
acquainted with many authors of the first
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
distinction; such as the two Humes, Ro∣bertson,
Smith, Wallace, Blair, Ferguson,
Wilkie, &amp;c. and I have found them all
as agreeable in conversation as they are
instructive and entertaining in their writ∣ings.
These acquaintances I owe to the
friendship of Dr. Carlyle, who wants
nothing but inclination to figure with the
rest upon paper. The magistracy of
Edinburgh is changed every year by elec∣tion,
and seems to be very well adapted
both for state and authority.—The <HI>lord
provost</HI> is equal in dignity to the <HI>lord mayor
of London;</HI> and the <HI>four bailies</HI> are equiva∣lent
to the rank of aldermen.—There is
a <HI>dean of guild,</HI> who takes cognizance of
mercantile affairs; a treasurer; a town∣clerk;
and the council is composed of
deacons, one of whom is returned every
year, in rotation, as representative of every
company of artificers or handicraftsmen.
Though this city, from the nature of its
situation, can never be made either very
convenient or very cleanly, it has, never∣theless,
an air of magnificence that com∣mands
respect.—The castle is an instance
of the sublime in scite and architecture.—
Its fortifications are kept in good order,
and there is always in it a garrison of re∣gular
soldiers, which is relieved every
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
year; but it is incapable of sustaining a
siege carried on according to the modern
operations of war.—The castle hill,
which extends from the outward gate to
the upper end of the high-street, is used
as a public walk for the citizens, and
commands a prospect, equally extensive
and delightful, over the county of Fife,
on the other side of the Frith, and all
along the sea-coast, which is covered
with a succession of towns that would seem
to indicate a considerable share of com∣merce;
but, if the truth must be told,
these towns have been falling to decay
ever since the union, by which the Scots
were in a great measure deprived of their
trade with France.—The palace of Holy∣rood-house
is a jewel in architecture,
thrust into a hollow where it cannot be
seen; a situation which was certainly not
chosen by the ingenious architect, who
must have been confined to the scite of
the old palace, which was a convent.
Edinburgh is considerably extended on
the south side, where there are divers
little elegant squares built in the English
manner; and the citizens have planned
some improvements on the north, which,
when put in execution, will add greatly
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
to the beauty and convenience of this ca∣pital.</P>
<P>The sea-port is Leith, a flourishing
town, about a mile from the city, in the
harbour of which I have seen above one
hundred ships lying all together. You
must know, I had the curiosity to cross
the Frith in a passage-boat, and stayed
two days in Fife, which is remarkably
fruitful in corn, and exhibits a surprising
number of fine seats, elegantly built, and
magnificently furnished. There is an in∣credible
number of noble houses in every
part of Scotland that I have seen.—Dal∣keith,
Pinkie, Yester, and lord Hopton's,
all of them within four or five miles of
Edinburgh, are princely palaces, in every
one of which a sovereign might reside at
his ease.—I suppose the Scots affect these
monuments of grandeur.—If I may be
allowed to mingle censure with my re∣marks
upon a people I revere, I must ob∣serve,
that their weak side seems to be va∣nity.—I
am afraid that even their hospi∣tality
is not quite free of ostentation.—
I think I have discovered among them
uncommon pains taken to display their
fine linen, of which, indeed, they have
great plenty, their furniture, plate, house-keeping,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
and variety of wines, in which
article, it must be owned, they are pro∣fuse,
if not prodigal.—A burgher of
Edinburgh, not content to vie with a ci∣tizen
of London, who has ten times his
fortune, must excel him in the expence
as well as elegance of his entertainments.</P>
<P>Though the villas of the Scotch nobi∣lity
and gentry have generally an air of
grandeur and state, I think their gardens
and parks are not comparable to those
of England; a circumstance the more
remarkable, as I was told by the inge∣nious
Mr. Philip Miller of Chelsea, that
almost all the gardeners of South-Britain
were natives of Scotland. The verdure
of this country is not equal to that of
England.—The pleasure-grounds are, in
my opinion, not so well laid out accord∣ing
to the <HI>genius loci;</HI> nor are the lawns,
and walks, and hedges kept in such de∣licate
order.—The trees are planted in
prudish rows, which have not such an
agreeable natural effect, as when they
are thrown into irregular groupes, with
intervening glades; and the firs, which
they generally raise around their houses,
look dull and funereal in the summer
season.—I must confess, indeed, that
they yield serviceable timber, and good
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
shelter against the northern blasts; that
they grow and thrive in the most barren
soil, and continually perspire a fine bal∣sam
of turpentine, which must render the
air very salutary and sanative to lungs of
a tender texture.</P>
<P>Tabby and I have been both frighten∣ed
in our return by sea from the coast
of Fife.—She was afraid of drowning,
and I of catching cold, in consequence
of being drenched with sea-water; but
my fears, as well as her's, have been hap∣pily
disappointed.—She is now in per∣fect
health; I wish I could say the same
of Liddy.—Something uncommon is
the matter with that poor child; her
colour fades, her appetite fails, and her
spirits flag.—She is become moping
and melancholy, and is often found in
tears.—Her brother suspects internal
uneasiness on account of Wilson, and de∣nounces
vegeance against that adventurer.
—She was, it seems, strongly affected
at the ball by the sudden appearance of
one Mr. Gordon, who strongly resembles
the said Wilson; but I am rather suspi∣cious
that she caught cold by being over∣heated
with dancing.—I have consulted
Dr. Gregory, an eminent physician of
an amiable character, who advises the
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
land air, and the use of goat-milk whey,
which, surely, cannot have a bad effect
upon a patient who was born and bred
among the mountains of Wales.—The
doctor's opinion is the more agreeable, as
we shall find those remedies in the very
place which I proposed as the utmost ex∣tent
of our expedition—I mean the bor∣ders
of Argyle.</P>
<P>Mr. Smollett, one of the judges of the
commissary court, which is now sitting,
has very kindly insisted upon our lodging
at his country-house, on the banks of
Lough-Lomond, about fourteen miles be∣yond
Glasgow. For this last city we
shall set out in two days, and take Stir∣ling
in our way, well provided with re∣commendations
from our friends at Edin∣burgh,
whom, I protest, I shall leave with
much regret. I am so far from thinking
it any hardship to live in this country,
that, if I was obliged to lead a town life,
Edinburgh would certainly be the head∣quarters
of</P>

<LETTER>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>I AM now little short of the <HI>Ultima
Thule,</HI> if this appellation properly belongs
to the Orkneys or Hebrides. These last
are now lying before me, to the amount
of some hundreds, scattered up and down
the Deucalidonian sea, affording the most
picturesque and romantic prospect I ever
beheld—I write this letter in a gentle∣man's
house, near the town of Inverary,
which may be deemed the capital of the
West Highlands, famous for nothing so
much as for the stately castle begun, and
actually covered in by the late duke of
Argyle, at a prodigious expence—Whe∣ther
it will ever be completely finished is
a question—</P>
<P>But, to take things in order.—We
left Edinburgh ten days ago; and the
further North we proceed, we find Mrs.
Tabitha the less manageable; so that her
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
inclinations are not of the nature of the
loadstone; they point not towards the pole.
What made her leave Edinburgh with re∣luctance
at last, if we may believe her
own assertions, was a dispute which she
left unfinished with Mr. Moffat, touch∣ing
the eternity of hell torments. That
gentleman, as he advanced in years, be∣gan
to be sceptical on this head, till, at
length, he declared open war against the
common acceptation of the word <HI>eternal.</HI>
He is now persuaded, that <HI>eternal</HI> signi∣fies
no more than an indefinite number of
years; and that the most enormous sinner
may be quit for <HI>nine millions, nine hundred
thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine years
of hell-fire;</HI> which term or period, as he
very well observes, forms but an incon∣siderable
drop, as it were, in the ocean of
eternity—For this mitigation he contends,
as a system agreeable to the ideas of good∣ness
and mercy, which we annex to the
supreme Being—Our aunt seemed will∣ing
to adopt this doctrine in favour of the
wicked; but he hinted, that no person
whatever was so righteous as to be ex∣empted
entirely from punishment in a fu∣ture
state; and that the most pious Chri∣stian
upon earth might think himself ve∣ry
happy to get off for a fast of seven or
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
eight thousand years in the midst of fire
and brimstone. Mrs. Tabitha revolted
at this dogma, which filled her at once
with horror and indignation—She had re∣course
to the opinion of Humphry Clin∣ker,
who roundly declared it was the
popish doctrine of purgatory, and quoted
scripture in defence of the <HI>fire everlasting,
prepared for the devil and his angels</HI>—The
reverend mester Mackcorkendale, and all
the theologists and saints of that persua∣sion
were consulted, and some of them
had doubts about the matter; which
doubts and scruples had begun to infect
our aunt, when we took our departure
from Edinburgh.</P>
<P>We passed through Linlithgow, where
there was an elegant royal palace, which
is now gone to decay, as well as the town
itself—This too is pretty much the case
with Stirling, though it still boasts of a
fine old castle, in which the kings of
Scotland were wont to reside in their mi∣nority—But
Glasgow is the pride of Scot∣land,
and, indeed, it might very well pass for
an elegant and flourishing city in any part
of Christendom. There we had the good
fortune to be received into the house of
Mr. Moore, an eminent surgeon, to
whom we were recommended by one of
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
our friends at Edinburgh; and, truly,
he could not have done us more essen∣tial
service—Mr. Moore is a merry fa∣cetious
companion, sensible and shrewd,
with a considerable fund of humour; and
his wife an agreeable woman, well bred,
kind, and obliging—Kindness, which I
take to be the essence of good-nature and
humanity, is the distinguishing characte∣ristic
of the Scotch ladies in their own
country—Our landlord shewed us every
thing, and introduced us to all the world
at Glasgow; where, through his recom∣mendation,
we were complimented with
the freedom of the town. Considering
the trade and opulence of this place, it
cannot but abound with gaiety and di∣versions—Here
is a great number of
young fellows that rival the youth of the
capital in spirit and expence; and I was
soon convinced, that all the female beau∣ties
of Scotland were not assembled at
the hunters ball in Edinburgh—The
town of Glasgow flourishes in learning, as
well as in commerce—Here is an univer∣sity,
with professors in all the different
branches of science, liberally endowed,
and judiciously chosen—It was vacation
time when I passed, so that I could not
entirely satisfy my curiosity; but their
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
mode of education is certainly preferable
to ours in some respects—The students
are not left to the private instruction of
tutors; but taught, in public schools or
classes, each science by its particular pro∣fessor
or regent.</P>
<P>My uncle is in raptures with Glasgow
—He not only visited all the manufac∣tures
of the place, but made excursions
all round, to Hamilton, Paisley, Ren∣frew,
and every other place within a
dozen miles, where there was any thing
remarkable to be seen in art or nature.
I believe the exercise, occasioned by these
jaunts, was of service to my sister Liddy,
whose appetite and spirits begin to revive
—Mrs. Tabitha displayed her attractions
as usual, and actually believed she had en∣tangled
one Mr. Maclellan, a rich inkle-manufacturer,
in her snares; but when
matters came to an explanation, it ap∣peared
that his attachment was altogether
spiritual, founded upon an intercourse of
devotion, at the meeting of Mr. John
Wesley; who, in the course of his evan∣gelical
mission, had come hither in per∣son—At
length, we set out for the banks
of Lough-Lomond, passing through the lit∣tle
borough of Dumbarton, or (as my un∣cle
will have it) Dunbritton, where there
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
is a castle, more curious than any thing of
the kind I had ever seen—It is honoured
with a particular description by the ele∣gant
Buchannan, as an <HI>arx inexpugnabilis,</HI>
and, indeed, it must have been impreg∣nable
by the antient manner of besieging.
It is a rock of considerable extent, rising
with a double top, in an angle formed by
the confluence of two rivers, the Clyde
and the Leven; perpendicular and inac∣cessible
on all sides, except in one place
where the entrance is fortified; and there
is no rising-ground in the neighbourhood
from whence it could be damaged by any
kind of battery.</P>
<P>From Dumbarton, the West High∣lands
appear in the form of huge, dusky
mountains, piled one over another; but
this prospect is not at all surprising to a na∣tive
of Glamorgan—We have fixed our
head-quarters at Cameron, a very neat
country-house belonging to commissary
Smollett, where we found every sort of
accommodation we could desire—It is
situated like a Druid's temple, in a grove
of oak, close by the side of Lough-Lomond,
which is a surprising body of pure
transparent water, unfathomably deep in
many places, six or seven miles broad,
four and twenty miles in length, display∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
above twenty green islands, covered
with wood; some of them cultivated for
corn, and many of them stocked with red
deer—They belong to different gentle∣men,
whose seats are scattered along the
banks of the lake, which are agreeably
romantic beyond all conception. My un∣cle
and I have left the women at Came∣ron,
as Mrs. Tabitha would by no means
trust herself again upon the water, and
to come hither it was necessary to cross a
small inlet of the sea, in an open ferry∣boat—This
country appears more and
more wild and savage the further we ad∣vance;
and the people are as different
from the Low-land Scots, in their looks,
garb, and language, as the mountaineers
of Brecknock are from the inhabitants of
Herefordshire.</P>
<P>When the Lowlanders want to drink a
chearupping-cup, they go to the public
house, called the Change-house, and call
for a chopine of two-penny, which is a
thin, yeasty beverage, made of malt;
not quite so strong as the table-beer of
England—This is brought in a pewter
stoop, shaped like a skittle, from whence
it is emptied into a quaff; that is a curi∣ous
cup made of different pieces of wood,
such as box and ebony, cut into little
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
staves, joined alternately, and secured
with delicate hoops, having two ears or
handles—It holds about a gill, is some∣times
tipt round the mouth with silver,
and has a plate of the same metal at bot∣tom,
with the landlord's cypher engraved
—The Highlanders, on the contrary, de∣spise
this liquor, and regale themselves
with whisky; a malt spirit, as strong as
geneva, which they swallow in great
quantities, without any signs of inebria∣tion.
They are used to it from the cra∣dle,
and find it an excellent preservative
against the winter cold, which must be
extreme on these mountains—I am told
that it is given with great success to in∣fants,
as a cordial in the confluent small∣pox,
when the erruption seems to flag,
and the symptoms grow unfavourable—
The Highlanders are used to eat much
more animal food than falls to the share
of their neighbours in the Low-country—
They delight in hunting; have plenty of
deer and other game, with a great num∣ber
of sheep, goats, and black-cattle run∣ning
wild, which they scruple not to kill
as venison, without being at much pains
to ascertain the property.</P>
<P>Inverary is but a poor town, though it
stands immediately under the protection
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
of the duke of Argyle, who is a mighty
prince in this part of Scotland. The
peasants live in wretched cabins, and
seem very poor; but the gentlemen are
tolerably well lodged, and so loving to
strangers, that a man runs some risque of
his life from their hospitality—It must
be observed that the poor Highlanders
are now seen to disadvantage—They have
been not only disarmed by act of parlia∣ment;
but also deprived of their antient
garb, which was both graceful and con∣venient;
and what is a greater hardship
still, they are compelled to wear breeches;
a restraint which they cannot bear with
any degree of patience: indeed, the ma∣jority
wear them, not in the proper place,
but on poles or long staves over their
shoulders—They are even debared the
use of their striped stuff, called Tartane,
which was their own manufacture, prized
by them above all the velvets, brocards,
and tissues of Europe and Asia. They
now lounge along in loose great coats, of
coarse russet, equally mean and cumber∣some,
and betray manifest marks of de∣jection—Certain
it is, the government
could not have taken a more effectual me∣thod
to break their national spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
We have had princely sport in hunting
the stag on these mountains—These are
the lonely hills of Morven, where Fingal
and his heroes enjoyed the same pastime:
I feel an enthusiastic pleasure when I sur∣vey
the brown heath that Ossian wont to
tread; and hear the wind whistle through
the bending grass—When I enter our
landlord's hall, I look for the suspended
harp of that divine bard, and listen in
hopes of hearing the aerial sound of his
respected spirit—The Poems of Ossian are
in every mouth—A famous antiquarian
of this country, the laird of Mackfarlane,
at whose house we dined a few days ago,
can repeat them all in the original Gaelick,
which has a great affinity to the Welch,
not only in the general sound, but also in
a great number of radical words; and I
make no doubt but that they are both
sprung from the same origin. I was not
a little surprised, when asking a High∣lander
one day, if he knew where we
should find any game? he replied, “<HI>hu
niel Sassenagh,</HI>” which signifies <HI>no En∣glish:</HI>
the very same answer I should have
received from a Welchman, and almost
in the same words. The Highlanders
have no other name for the people of the
Low-country, but Sassenagh, or Saxons;
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
a strong presumption, that the Lowland
Scots and the English are derived from
the same stock—The peasants of these
hills strongly resemble those of Wales in
their looks, their manners, and habita∣tions;
every thing I see, and hear, and
feel, seems Welch—The mountains,
vales, and streams; the air and climate;
the beef, mutton, and game, are all
Welch—It must be owned, however, that
this people are better provided than we in
some articles—They have plenty of red
deer and roebuck, which are fat and de∣licious
at this season of the year—Their
sea teems with amazing quantities of the
finest fish in the world; and they find
means to procure very good claret at a
very small expence.</P>
<P>Our landlord is a man of consequence
in this part of the country; a cadet from
the family of Argyle, and hereditary cap∣tain
of one of his castles—His name, in
plain English, is Dougal Campbell; but
as there is a great number of the same
appellation, they are distinguished (like
the Welch) by patronimics; and as I
have known an antient Briton called Ma∣doc
ap-Morgan, ap-Jenkin, ap-Jones, our
Highland chief designs himself Dou'l
Mac-amish mac-'oul ich-ian, signifying
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Dougal, the son of James, the son of
Dougal, the son of John—He has travel∣ed
in the course of his education, and is
disposed to make certain alterations in his
domestic oeconomy; but he finds it im∣possible
to abolish the antient customs of
the family; some of which are ludicrous
enough—His piper, for example, who is
an hereditary officer of the household,
will not part with the least particle of his
privileges—He has a right to wear the
kilt, or antient Highland dress, with the
purse, pistol, and durk—a broad yellow
ribbon, fixed to the chanter-pipe, is
thrown over his shoulder, and trails along
the ground, while he performs the func∣tion
of his minstrelsy; and this, I sup∣pose,
is analogous to the pennon or flag
which was formerly carried before every
knight in battle—He plays before the
laird every Sunday in his way to the kirk,
which he circles three times, perform∣ing
the family march, which implies de∣fiance
to all the enemies of the clan; and
every morning he plays a full hour by the
clock, in the great hall, marching back∣wards
and forwards all the time, with a
solemn pace, attended by the laird's kins∣men,
who seem much delighted with the
music—In this exercise, he indulges them
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
with a variety of pibrachs or airs, suited
to the different passions, which he would
either excite or assuage.</P>
<P>Mr. Campbell himself, who performs
very well on the violin, has an invincible
antipathy to the sound of the Highland
bag-pipe, which sings in the nose with a
most alarming twang, and, indeed, is
quite intolerable to ears of common sen∣sibility,
when aggravated by the echo of a
vaulted hall—He therefore begged the
piper would have some mercy upon him,
and dispense with this part of the morn∣ing
service—A consultation of the clan
being held on this occasion, it was unani∣mously
agreed, that the laird's request
could not be granted without a danger∣ous
encroachment upon the customs of
the family—The piper declared, he could
not give up for a moment the privilege he
derived from his ancestors; nor would
the laird's relations forego an entertain∣ment
which they valued above all others
—There was no remedy; Mr. Campbell,
being obliged to acquiesce, is fain to stop
his ears with cotton; to fortify his head
with three or four night-caps, and every
morning retire into the penetralia of his
habitation, in order to avoid this diurnal
annoyance. When the music ceases, he
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
produces himself at an open window that
looks into the court-yard, which is by
this time filled with a crowd of his vassals
and dependents, who worship his first ap∣pearance,
by uncovering their heads, and
bowing to the earth with the most humble
prostration. As all these people have
something to communicate in the way of
proposal, complaint, or petition, they
wait patiently till the laird comes sorth,
and, following him in his walks, are fa∣voured
each with a short audience in his
turn. Two days ago, he dispatched above
an hundred different sollicitors, in walk∣ing
with us to the house of a neighbour∣ing
gentleman, where we dined by invita∣tion.
Our landlord's house-keeping is
equally rough and hospitable, and savours
much of the simplicity of ancient times:
the great hall, paved with fiat stones, is
about forty-five feet by twenty-two, and
serves not only for a dining-room, but al∣so
for a bed-chamber to gentlemen-de∣pendents
and hangers-on of the family. At
night, half a dozen occasional beds are rang∣ed
on each side along the wall. These are
made of fresh heath, pulled up by the roots,
and disposed in such a manner as to make
a very agreeable couch, where they l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,
without any other covering than the plaid
—My uncle and I were indulged with se∣parate
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
chambers and down beds, which
we begged to exchange for a layer of
heath; and indeed I never slept so much
to my satisfaction. It was not only soft and
elastic, but the plant, being in flower, dif∣fused
an agreeable fragrance, which is
wonderfully refreshing and restorative.</P>
<P>Yesterday we were invited to the fune∣ral
of an old lady, the grand-mother of a
gentleman in this neighbourhood, and
found ourselves in the midst of fifty
people, who were regaled with a sump∣tuous
feast, accompanied by the music of
a dozen pipers. In short, this meeting
had all the air of a grand festival; and
the guests did such honour to the enter∣tainment,
that many of them could not
stand when we were reminded of the
business on which we had met. The com∣pany
forthwith taking horse, rode in a
very irregular cavalcade to the place of in∣terment,
a church, at the distance of two
long miles from the castle. On our arri∣val,
however, we found we had commit∣ted
a small oversight, in leaving the corpse
behind; so that we were obliged to wheel
about, and met the old gentlewoman half
way, carried upon poles by the nearest re∣lations
of her family, and attended by
the <HI>coronach,</HI> composed of a multitude of
old hags, who tore their hair, beat their
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
breasts, and howled most hideously. At
the grave, the orator, or <HI>senachie,</HI> pro∣nounced
the panegyric of the defunct,
every period being confirmed by a yell of
the <HI>coronach.</HI> The body was committed
to the earth, the pipers playing a pibroch
all the time; and all the company stand∣ing
uncovered. The ceremony was
closed with the discharge of pistols; then
we returned to the castle, resumed the
bottle, and by midnight there was not
a sober person in the family, the females
excepted. The 'squire and I were, with
some difficulty, permitted to retire with
our landlord in the evening; but our en∣tertainer
was a little chagrined at our re∣treat;
and afterwards seemed to think it
a disparagement to his family, that not
above a hundred gallons of whisky had
been drank upon such a solemn occasion.
This morning we got up by four, to hunt
the roebuck, and, in an half an hour,
found breakfast ready served in the hall.
The hunters consisted of Sir George Col∣quhoun
and me, as strangers, (my uncle
not chusing to be of the party) of the
<HI>laird in person, the laird's brother, the laird's
brother's son, the laird's sister's son, the
laird's father's brother's son,</HI> and all their
<HI>foster brothers,</HI> who are counted parcel of
the family: but we were attended by an
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
infinite number of <HI>Gaellys,</HI> or ragged
Highlanders, without shoes or stockings.</P>
<P>The following articles formed our
morning's repast: one kit of boiled eggs;
a second, full of butter; a third, full of
cream; an entire cheese, made of goat's
milk; a large earthen pot full of honey;
the best part of a ham; a cold venison
pasty; a bushel of oat meal, made in thin
cakes and bannocks, with a small wheaten
loaf in the middle for the strangers; a large
stone bottle full of whisky, another of
brandy, and a kilderkin of ale. There
was a laddle chained to the cream kit,
with curious wooden bickers to be filled
from this reservoir. The spirits were
drank out of a silver quaff, and the ale
out of horns: great justice was done to
the collation by the guests in general;
one of them in particular ate above two
dozen of hard eggs, with a proportion∣able
quantity of bread, butter, and ho∣ney;
nor was one drop of liquor left up∣on
the board. Finally, a large roll of
tobacco was presented by way of desert,
and every individual took a comfortable
quid, to prevent the bad effects of the
morning air. We had a fine chace over
the mountains, after a roebuck, which
we killed, and I got home time enough
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
to drink tea with Mrs. Campbell and our
'squire. To-morrow we shall set out on our
return for Cameron. We propose to cross
the Frith of Clyde, and take the towns of
Greenock and Port-Glasgow in our way.
This circuit being finished, we shall turn
our faces to the south, and follow the sun
with augmented velocity, in order to en∣joy

<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>ABOUT a fortnight is now elapsed,
since we left the capital of Scotland, di∣recting
our course towards Stirling, where
we lay—The castle of this place is such
another as that of Edinburgh, and affords
a surprising prospect of the windings of
the river Forth, which are so extraordina∣ry,
that the distance from hence to Alloa
by land, is but four miles, and by water it is
twenty-four. Alloa is a neat thriving
town, that depends in a great measure on
the commerce of Glasgow, the merchants
of which send hither tobacco and other
articles, to be deposited in warehouses for
exportation from the Frith of Forth. In
our way hither we visited a flourishing
iron-work, where, instead of burning
wood, they use coal, which they have the
art of clearing in such a manner as
frees it from the sulphur, that would
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
otherwise render the metal too brittle for
working. Excellent coal is found in al∣most
every part of Scotland.</P>
<P>The soil of this district produces scarce
any other grain but oats and barley; per∣haps
because it is poorly cultivated, and
almost altogether uninclosed. The few
inclosures they have consist of paultry
walls of loose stones gathered from the
fields, which indeed they cover, as if they
had been scattered on purpose. When I
expressed my surprize that the peasants
did not disencumber their grounds of these
stones; a gentleman, well aquainted with
the theory as well as practice of farming,
assured me that the stones, far from being
prejudicial, were serviceable to the crop.
This philosopher had ordered a field of his
own to be cleared, manured and sown with
barley, and the produce was more scanty
than before. He caused the stones to be
replaced, and next year the crop was as
good as ever. The stones were removed
a second time, and the harvest sailed; they
were again brought back, and the ground
retrieved its fertility. The same experi∣ment
has been tried in different parts of
Scotland with the same success—Astonish∣ed
at this information, I desired to know
in what manner be accounted for this
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
strange phenomenon; and he said there
were three ways in which the stones might
be serviceable. They might possibly re∣strain
an excess in the perspiration of the
earth, analogous to colliquative sweats,
by which the human body is sometimes
wasted and consumed. They might act
as so many fences to protect the tender
blade from the piercing winds of the
spring; or, by multiplying the reflexion
of the sun, they might increase the warmth,
so as to mitigate the naural chilness of
the soil and climate—But, surely this ex∣excessive
perspiration might be more ef∣fectually
checked by different kinds of
manure, such as ashes, lime, chalk, or
marl, of which last it seems there are
many pits in this kingdom: as for the
warmth, it would be much more equally
obtained by inclosures; one half of the
ground which is now covered, would be
retrieved; the cultivation would require
less labour; and the ploughs, harrows,
and horses, would not suffer half the da∣mage
which they now sustain.</P>
<P>These north-western parts are by no means
fertile in corn. The ground is naturally
barren and moorish. The peasants are poor∣ly
lodged, meagre in their looks, mean
in their apparel, and remarkably dirty.
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
This last reproach they might easily wash
off, by means of those lakes, rivers, and
rivulets of pure water, with which they
are so liberally supplied by nature. Agri∣culture
cannot be expected to flourish
where the farms are small, the leases short,
and the husbandman begins upon a rack
rent, without a sufficient stock to answer
the purposes of improvement. The gra∣naries
of Scotland are the banks of the
Tweed, the counties of East and Mid-Lothian,
the Carse of Gowrie, in Perth∣shire,
equal in fertility to any part of
England, and some tracts in Aberdeen∣shire
and Murray, where I am told the
harvest is more early than in Northum∣berland,
although they lie above two de∣grees
farther north. I have a strong cu∣riosity
to visit many places beyond the
Forth and the Tay, such as Perth, Dun∣dee,
Montrose, and Aberdeen, which
are towns equally elegant and thriving;
but the season is too far advanced, to ad∣mit
of this addition to my original plan.</P>
<P>I am so far happy as to have seen
Glasgow, which, to the best of my recol∣lection
and judgment, is one of the pret∣tiest
towns in Europe; and, without all
doubt, it is one of the most flourishing in
Great Britain. In short, it is a perfect
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
bee-hive in point of industry. It stands
partly on a gentle declivity; but the
greatest part of it is in a plain, watered by
the river Clyde. The streets are straight,
open, airy, and well paved; and the
houses lofty and well built of hewn
stone. At the upper end of the town,
there is a venerable cathedral, that may
be compared with York minster or West∣minster;
and, about the middle of the
descent from this to the Cross, is the col∣lege,
a respectable pile of building, with
all manner of accommodation for the pro∣fessors
and students, including an elegant
library, and an observatory well provid∣ed
with astronomical instruments. The
number of inhabitants is said to amount
to thirty thousand; and marks of opu∣lence
and independency appear in every
quarter of this commercial city, which,
however, is not without its inconveniences
and defects The water of their public
pumps is generally hard and brackish,
an imperfection the less excusable, as the
river Clyde runs by their doors, in the
lower part of the town; and there are ri∣vulets
and springs above the cathedral,
sufficient to fill a large reservoir with ex∣cellent
water, which might be thence distri∣buted
to all the different parts of the ci∣ty.
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
It is of more consequence to consult
the health of the inhabitants in this ar∣ticle,
than to employ so much attention in
beautifying their town with new streets,
squares, and churches. Another defect,
not so easily remedied, is the shallowness
of the river, which will not float vessels
of any burthen within ten or twelve
miles of the city; so that the merchants
are obliged to load and unload their ships
at Greenock and Port-Glasgow, situated
about fourteen miles nearer the mouth of
the Frith, where it is about two miles
broad.</P>
<P>The people of Glasgow have a noble
spirit of enterprise—Mr. Moore, a sur∣geon,
to whom I was recommended from
Edinburgh, introduced me to all the prin∣cipal
merchants of the place. Here I
became acquainted with Mr. Cochran,
who may be stiled one of the sages of this
kingdom. He was first magistrate at the
time of the last rebellion. I sat as mem∣ber
when he was examined in the house
of commons; upon which occasion Mr.
P—observed he had never heard such
a sensible evidence given at that bar—I
was also introduced to Dr. John Gordon,
patriot of a truly Roman spirit, who is the
father of the linen manufacture in this
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
place, and was the great promoter of the
city workhouse, infirmary, and other
works of public utility. Had he lived
in ancient Rome, he would have been
honoured with a statue at the public ex∣pence.
I moreover conversed with one
Mr. G—ssf—d, whom I take to be one
of the greatest merchants in Europe. In
the last war, he is said to have had at one
time five and twenty ships, with their
cargoes, his own property, and to have
traded for above half a million sterling
a year. The last war was a fortunate pe∣riod
for the commerce of Glasgow—The
merchants, considering that their ships
bound for America, launching out at once
into the Atlantic by the north of Ireland,
pursued a track very little frequented by
privateers, resolved to insure one another,
and saved a very considerable sum by this
resolution, as few or none of their ships
were taken—You must know I have a
sort of national attachment to this part of
Scotland—The great church dedicated to
St. Mongah, the river Clyde, and other
particulars that smack of our Welch lan∣guage
and customs, contribute to flatter
me with the notion, that these people are
the descendants of the Britons, who once
possessed this country. Without all ques∣tion,
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
this was a Cumbrian kingdom: its
capital was Dumbarton (a corruption of
Dumbritton) which still exists as a royal
borough, at the influx of the Clyde and
Leven, ten miles below Glasgow. The
same neighbourhood gave birth to St.
Patrick, the apostle of Ireland, at a place
where there is still a church and village,
which retain his name. Hard by are
some vestiges of the famous Roman wall,
built in the reign of Antonine, from the
Clyde to the Forth, and fortified with
castles, to restrain the incursions of the
Scots or Caledonians, who inhabited the
West-Highlands. In a line parallel to this
wall, the merchants of Glasgow have de∣termined
to make a navigable canal be∣twixt
the two Friths, which will be of in∣credible
advantage to their commerce, in
transporting merchandize from one side
of the island to the other.</P>
<P>From Glasgow we travelled along the
Clyde, which is a delightful stream, ad∣orned
on both sides with villas, towns,
and villages. Here is no want of groves,
and meadows, and corn-fields inter∣spersed;
but on this side of Glasgow,
there is little other grain than oats and
barley; the first are much better, the last
much worse, than those of the same spe∣cies
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
in England. I wonder, there is so
little rye, which is a grain that will thrive
in almost any soil; and it is still more
surprising, that the cultivation of pota∣toes
should be so much neglected in the
Highlands, where the poor people have
not meal enough to supply them with
bread through the winter. On the other
side of the river are the towns of Paisley
and Renfrew. The first, from an incon∣siderable
village, is become one of the
most flourishing places of the kingdom,
enriched by the linen, cambrick▪ flowered
lawn, and silk manufactures. It was for∣merly
noted for a rich monastery of the
monks of Clugny, who wrote the famous
<HI>Scoti-Chronicon,</HI> called <HI>The Black Book of
Paisley.</HI> The old abbey still remains, con∣verted
into a dwelling-house, belonging to
the earl of Dundonald. Renfrew is a pretty
town, on the banks of Clyde, capital of
the shire, which was heretofore the patri∣mony
of the Stuart family, and gave the
title of baron to the king's eldest son,
which is still assumed by the prince of
Wales.</P>
<P>The Clyde we left a little on our left-hand
at Dunbritton, where it widens into
an aestuary or frith, being augmented by
the influx of the Leven. On this spo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
stands the castle formerly called Alcluyd,
washed by these two rivers on all sides,
except a narrow isthmus, which at
every spring-tide is overflowed. The
whole is a great curiosity, from the quality
and form of the rock, as well as from the
nature of its situation—We now crossed
the water of Leven, which, though no∣thing
near so considerable as the Clyde, is
much more transparent, pastoral, and de∣lightful.
This charming stream is the
outlet of Lough-Lomond, and through a
tract of four miles pursues its winding
course, murmuring over a bed of pebbles,
till it joins the Frith at Dunbritton. A
very little above its source, on the lake,
stands the house of Cameron, belonging
to Mr. Smollett, so embosomed in an oak
wood, that we did not see it till we were
within fifty yards of the door. I have
seen the Lago di Garda, Albano, De Vico,
Bolsena, and Geneva, and, upon my ho∣nour,
I prefer Lough-Lomond to them all;
a preference which is certainly owing to
the verdant islands that seem to float upon
its surface, affording the most inchanting
objects of repose to the excursive view.
Nor are the banks destitute of beauties,
which even partake of the sublime. On
this side they display a sweet variety of
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
woodland, corn-field, and pasture, with
several agreeable villas emerging as it
were out of the lake, till, at some distance,
the prospect terminates in huge moun∣tains
covered with heath, which being in
the bloom, affords a very rich covering
of purple. Every thing here is romantic
beyond imagination. This country is
justly stiled the Arcadia of Scotland; and
I don't doubt but it may vie with Arca∣dia
in every thing but climate.—I am
sure it excels it in verdure, wood, and
water.—What say you to a natural bason
of pure water, near thirty miles long, and
in some places seven miles broad, and in
many above a hundred fathom deep, having
four and twenty habitable islands, some of
them stocked with deer, and all of them
covered with wood; containing immense
quantities of delicious fish, salmon, pike,
trout, perch, flounders, eels, and pow∣ans,
the last a delicate kind of fresh-water
herring peculiar to this lake; and finally
communicating with the sea, by sending
off the Leven, through which all those
species (except the powan) make their
exit and entrance occasionally?</P>
<P>Inclosed I send you the copy of a little
ode to this river, by Dr. Smollett, who
was born on the banks of it, within two
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
miles of the place where I am now writ∣ing.—It
is at least picturesque and accu∣rately
descriptive, if it has no other merit.
—There is an idea of truth in an agreeable
landscape taken from nature, which pleases
me more than the gayest fiction which the

<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>IF I was disposed to be critical, I
should say this house of Cameron is too
near the lake, which approaches, on one
side, to within six or seven yards of the
window. It might have been placed in a
higher site, which would have afforded a
more extensive prospect and a drier at∣mosphere;
but this imperfection is not
chargeable on the present proprietor, who
purchased it ready built, rather than be
at the trouble of repairing his own family-house
of Bonhill, which stands two miles
from hence on the Leven, so surrounded
with plantation, that it used to be known
by the name of the Mavis (or thrush) Nest.
Above that house is a romantic glen or clift
of a mountain, covered with hanging woods,
having at bottom a stream of fine water
that forms a number of cascades in its
descent to join the Leven; so that the
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
scene is quite enchanting. A captain of
a man of war, who had made the circuit of
the globe with Mr. Anson, being con∣ducted
to this glen, exclaimed, “Juan
Fernandez, by God!”</P>
<P>Indeed, this country would be a per∣fect
paradise, if it was not, like Wales,
cursed with a weeping climate, owing to
the same causes in both, the neighbour∣hood
of high mountains, and a westerly
situation, exposed to the vapours of the
Atlantic ocean. This air, however, not∣withstanding
its humidity, is so healthy,
that the natives are scarce ever visited by
any other disease than the small-pox, and
certain cutaneous evils, which are the
effects of dirty living, the great and ge∣neral
reproach of the commonalty of this
kingdom. Here are a great many living
monuments of longaevity; and among
the rest a person, whom I treat with sin∣gular
respect, as a venerable druid, who
has lived near ninety years, without pain
or sickness, among oaks of his own plant∣ing.—He
was once proprietor of these
lands; but being of a projecting spirit,
some of his schemes miscarried, and he
was obliged to part with his possession,
which hath shifted hands two or three
times since that period; but every suc∣ceeding
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
proprietor hath done every thing
in his power, to make his old age easy and
comfortable. He has a sufficiency to
procure the necessaries of life; and he
and his old woman resided in a small con∣venient
farm-house, having a little garden
which he cultivates with his own hands. This
ancient couple live in great health, peace,
and harmony, and, knowing no wants, enjoy
the perfection of content. Mr. Smollet
calls him the admiral, because he insists
upon steering his pleasure-boat upon the
lake; and he spends most of his time in
ranging through the woods, which he de∣clares
he enjoys as much as if they were
still his own property—I asked him the
other day, if he was never sick, and he
answered, Yes; he had a slight fever the
year before the union. If he was not
deaf, I should take much pleasure in his
conversation; for he is very intelligent,
and his memory is surprisingly retentive—
These are the happy effects of tempe∣rance,
exercise, and good nature—Not∣withstanding
all his innocence, however,
he was the cause of great perturbation to
my man Clinker, whose natural supersti∣tion
has been much injured, by the h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sto∣ries
of witches, fairies, ghosts, and gob∣lins,
which he has heard in this country—
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
On the evening after our arrival, Hum∣phrey
strolled into the wood, in the course
of his meditation, and all at once the
admiral stood before him, under the sha∣dow
of a spreading oak. Though the
fellow is far from being timorous in cases
that are not supposed preternatural, he
could not stand the sight of this appari∣tion,
but ran into the kitchen, with his
hair standing on end, staring wildly, and
deprived of utterance. Mrs. Jenkins, see∣ing
him in this condition, screamed aloud,
“Lord have mercy upon us, he has seen
something!” Mrs. Tabitha was alarm∣ed,
and the whole house in confusion.
When he was recruited with a dram, I
desired him to explain the meaning of all
this agitation; and, with some reluctance,
he owned he had seen a spirit, in the shape
of an old man with a white beard, a black
cap, and a plaid night gown. He was
undeceived by the admiral in person, who,
coming in at this juncture, appeared to
be a creature of real flesh and blood.</P>
<P>Do you know how we fare in this Scot∣tish
paradise? We make free with our
landlord's mutton, which is excellent, his
poultry-yard, his garden, his dairy, and
his cellar, which are all well stored. We
have delicious salmon, pike, trout, perch,
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
par, &amp;c. at the door, for the taking. The
Frith of Clyde, on the other side of the
hill, supplies us with mullet, red and grey,
cod, mackarel, whiting, and a variety of
sea-fish, including the finest fresh herrings
I ever tasted. We have sweet, juicy beef,
and tolerable veal, with delicate bread
from the little town of Dunbritton; and
plenty of partridge, growse, heath-cock,
and other game in presents.</P>
<P>We have been visited by all the gentle∣men
in the neighbourhood, and they have
entertained us at their houses, not barely
with hospitality, but with such marks of
cordial affection, as one would wish to
find among near relations, after an absence
of many years.</P>
<P>I told you, in my last, I had projected
an excursion to the Highlands, which pro∣ject
I have now happily executed, under
the auspices of Sir George Colquhoun, a
colonel in the Dutch service, who offered
himself as our conductor on this occasion.
Leaving our women at Cameron, to the
care and inspection of Lady H—
C—, we set out on horseback for In∣verary,
the county town of Argyle, and
dined on the road with the Laird of Mac∣farlane,
the greatest genealogist I ever
knew in any country, and perfectly ac∣quainted
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
with all the antiquities of Scot∣land.</P>
<P>The Duke of Argyle has an old castle
at Inverary, where he resides when he is
in Scotland; and hard by is the shell of
a noble Gothic palace, built by the last
duke, which, when finished, will be a
great ornament to this part of the High∣lands.
As for Inverary, it is a place of
very little importance.</P>
<P>This country is amazingly wild, espe∣cially
towards the mountains, which are
heaped upon the backs of one another,
making a most stupendous appearance of
savage nature, with hardly any signs of
cultivation, or even of population. All
is sublimity, silence, and solitude. The
people live together in glens or bottoms,
where they are sheltered from the cold
and storms of winter: but there is a mar∣gin
of plain ground spread along the sea
side, which is well inhabited and improv∣ed
by the arts of husbandry; and this I
take to be one of the most agreeable tracts
of the whole island; the sea not only keeps
it warm, and supplies it with fish, but af∣fords
one of the most ravishing prospects
in the whole world; I mean the appear∣ance
of the Hebrides, or Western Islands,
to the number of three hundred, scattered
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
as far as the eye can reach, in the most
agreeable confusion. As the soil and cli∣mate
of the Highlands are but ill adapted
to the cultivation of corn, the people ap∣ply
themselves chiefly to the breeding and
feeding of black cattle, which turn to
good account Those animals run wild all
the winter, without any shelter or subsist∣ence,
but what they can find among the
heath. When the snow lies so deep and
hard, that they cannot penetrate to the
roots of the grass, they make a diurnal
progress, guided by a sure instinct, to the
sea-side at low water, where they feed
on the <HI>alga marina,</HI> and other plants that
grow upon the beach.</P>
<P>Perhaps this branch of husbandry,
which requires very little attendance and
labour, is one of the principal causes of
that idleness and want of industry, which
distinguishes these mountaineers in their
own country—When they come forth in∣to
the world, they become as diligent and
alert as any people upon earth. They are un∣doubtedly
a very distinct species from their
fellow-subjects of the Lowlands, against
whom they indulge an ancient spirit of
animosity; and this difference is very dis∣cernible
even among persons of family and
education. The Lowlanders are general∣ly
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
cool and circumspect, the Highlanders
fiery and ferocious: but this violence of
their passions serves only to inflame
the zeal of their devotion to strangers,
which is truly enthusiastic.</P>
<P>We proceeded about twenty miles be∣yond
Inverary, to the house of a gentle∣man,
a friend of our conductor, where
we stayed a few days, and were feasted in
such a manner, that I began to dread the
consequence to my constitution.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the solitude that pre∣vails
among these mountains, there is no
want of people in the Highlands. I am
credibly informed that the duke of Ar∣gyle
can assemble five thousand men in
arms, of his own clan and surname, which
is Campbell; and there is besides a tribe
of the same appellation, whose chief is
the Earl of Breadalbine. The Macdo∣nalds
are as numerous, and remarkably
warlike: the Camerons, M 'Leods, Fra∣sers,
Grants, M 'Kenzies, M 'Kays,
M 'Phersons, M 'Intoshes, are powerful
clans; so that if all the Highlanders, in∣cluding
the inhabitants of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Isles, were
united, they could bring into the field an
army of forty thousand fighting men, ca∣pabable
of undertaking the most danger∣ous
enterprize. We have lived to see
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
four thousand of them, without discipline,
throw the whole kingdom of Great Bri∣tain
into confusion. They attacked and
defeated two armies of regular troops,
accustomed to service. They penetrated
into the centre of England; and after∣wards
marched back with deliberation, in
the face of two other armies, through an
enemy's country, where every precaution
was taken to cut off their retreat. I know
not any other people in Europe, who,
without the use or knowledge of arms,
will attack regular forces sword in hand,
if their chief will head them in battle.
When disciplined, they cannot fail of be∣ing
excellent soldiers. They do not walk
like the generality of mankind, but trot
and bounce like deer, as if they moved
upon springs. They greatly excel the
Lowlanders in all the exercises that re∣quire
agility; they are incredibly abste∣mious,
and patient of hunger and fatigue;
so steeled against the weather, that in tra∣velling,
even when the ground is covered
with snow, they never look for a house, or
any other shelter but their plaid, in which
they wrap themselves up, and go to sleep
under the cope of heaven. Such people,
in quality of soldiers, must be invincible,
when the business is to perform quick
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
marches in a difficult country, to strike sud∣den
strokes, beat up the enemy's quar∣ters,
harrass their cavalry, and perform
expeditions without the formality of ma∣gazines,
baggage, forage, and artillery.
The chieftainship of the Highlanders is
a very dangerous influence operating at
the extremity of the island, where the
eyes and hands of government cannot be
supposed to see and act with precision and
vigour. In order to break the force of
clanship, administration has always prac∣tised
the political maxim, <HI>Divide et impera.</HI>
The legislature hath not only disarmed
these mountaineers, but also deprived them
of their ancient garb, which contributed
in a great measure to keep up their mili∣tary
spirit; and their slavish tenures are
all dissolved by act of parliament; so that
they are at present as free and independ∣ent
of their chiefs, as the law can make
them: but the original attachment still re∣mains,
and is founded on something prior
to the <HI>feudal system,</HI> about which the wri∣ters
of this age have made such a pother,
as if it was a new discovery, like the <HI>Co∣pernican
system.</HI> Every peculiarity of po∣licy,
custom, and even temperament, is
affectedly traced to this origin, as if the
feudal constitution had not been common
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
to almost all the natives of Europe. For
my part, I expect to see the use of trunk∣hose
and buttered ale ascribed to the in∣fluence
of the <HI>feudal system.</HI> The connec∣tion
between the clans and their chiefs is,
without all doubt, <HI>patriarchal.</HI> It is
founded on hereditary regard and affec∣tion,
cherished through a long succession
of ages. The clan consider the chief as
their father, they bear his name, they
believe themselves descended from his fa∣mily,
and they obey him as their lord,
with all the ardour of filial love and vene∣ration;
while he, on his part, exerts a pa∣ternal
authority, commanding, chastising,
rewarding, protecting, and maintaining
them as his own children. If the legis∣lature
would entirely destroy this connec∣tion,
it must compel the Highlanders to
change their habitation and their names.
Even this experiment has been formerly
tried without success—In the reign of
James VI. a battle was fought with∣in
a few short miles of this place, be∣tween
two clans, the M 'Gregors and the
Colquhouns, in which the latter were de∣feated:
the Laird of M 'Gregor made
such a barbarous use of his victory, that
he was forfeited and outlawed by act of
parliament: his lands were given to the
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
family of Montrose, and his clan were
obliged to change their name. They
obeyed so far, as to call themselves seve∣rally
Campbell, Graham, or Drummond,
the surnames of the families of Argyle,
Montrose, and Perth, that they might
enjoy the protection of those houses; but
they still added M 'Gregor to their new
appellation; and as their chief was de∣prived
of his estate, they robbed and
plundered for his subsistence.—Mr. Ca∣meron
of Lochiel, the chief of that clan,
whose father was attainted for having
been concerned in the last rebellion, re∣turning
from France in obedience to a pro∣clamation
and act of parliament, passed
at the beginning of the late war, payed a
visit to his own country, and hired a farm
in the neighbourhood of his father's house,
which had been burnt to the ground. The
clan, though ruined and scattered, no sooner
heard of his arrival than they flocked to
him from all quarters, to welcome his re∣turn,
and in a few days stocked his farm
with seven hundred black cattle, which
they had saved in the general wreck of their
affairs: but their beloved chief, who was
a promising youth, did not live to enjoy the
fruits of their fidelity and attachment.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="57"/>
The most effectual method I know to
weaken, and at length destroy this in∣fluence,
is to employ the commonalty in
such a manner as to give them a taste of
property and independence—In vain the
government grants them advantageous
leases on the forfeited estates, if they have
no property to prosecute the means of
improvement—The sea is an inexhausti∣ble
fund of riches; but the fishery cannot
be carried on without vessels, casks, salt,
lines, nets, and other tackle. I convers∣ed
with a sensible man of this country,
who, from a real spirit of patriotism, had
set up a fishery on the coast, and a ma∣nufacture
of coarse linen, for the employ∣ment
of the poor Highlanders. Cod is
here in such plenty, that he told me he
had seen seven hundred taken on one line,
at one hawl—It must be observed, how∣ever,
that the line was of immense length,
and had two thousand hooks, baited with
muscles; but the fish was so superior to
the cod caught on the banks of New∣foundland,
that his correspondent at Lis∣bon
sold them immediately at his own
price, although Lent was just over when
they arrived, and the people might be
supposed quite cloyed with this kind of
diet—His linen manufacture was like∣wise
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
in a prosperous way, when the late
war intervening, all his best hands were
pressed into the service.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected, that the gentle∣men
of this country should execute com∣mercial
schemes to render their vassals
independent; nor, indeed, are such
schemes suited to their way of life and in∣clination;
but a company of merchants
might, with proper management, turn to
good account a fishery established in this
part of Scotland—Our people have a
strange itch to colonize America, when
the uncultivated parts of our own island
might be settled to greater advantage.</P>
<P>After having rambled through the
mountains and glens of Argyle, we visit∣ed
the adjacent islands of Ila, Jura, Mull,
and Icolmkill. In the first, we saw the re∣mains
of a castle, built in a lake, where
Macdonald, lord or king of the isles,
formerly resided. Jura is famous for
having given birth to one Mackcrain,
who lived one hundred and eighty years
in one house, and died in the reign of
Charles the Second. Mull affords seve∣ral
bays, where there is safe anchorage;
in one of which, the Florida, a ship of
the Spanish armada, was blown up by one
of Mr. Smollett's ancestors—About forty
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
years ago, John duke of Argyle is said
to have consulted the Spanish registers,
by which it appeared, that this ship had
the military chest on board—He employed
experienced divers to examine the wreck;
and they found the hull of the vessel still
entire, but so covered with sand, that
they could not make their way between
decks; however, they picked up seve∣ral
pieces of plate, that were scattered a∣bout
in the bay, and a couple of fine brass
cannon.</P>
<P>Icolmkill, or Iona, is a small island
which St. Columba chose for his habita∣tion—It
was respected for its sanctity,
and college or seminary of ecclesiastics—
Part of its church is still standing, with
the tombs of several Scottish, Irish, and
Danish sovereigns, who were here inter∣red—These
islanders are very bold and
dexterous watermen, consequently the
better adapted to the fishery: in their
manners they are less savage and impe∣tuous
than their countrymen on the con∣tinent;
and they speak the Erse or
Gaelick in its greatest purity.</P>
<P>Having sent round our horses by land,
we embarked in the district of Cowal, for
Greenock, which is a neat little town, on
the other side of the Frith, with a curi∣ous
harbour, formed by three stone jet∣ties,
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
carried out a good way into the sea
—Newport-Glasgow is such another
place, about two miles higher up—Both
have a face of business and plenty, and
are supported entirely by the shipping of
Glasgow, of which I counted sixty large
vessels in these harbours—Taking boat
again at Newport, we were in less than
an hour landed on the other side, within
two short miles of our head-quarters,
where we found our women in good
health and spirits—They had been two
days before joined by Mr. Smollett and his
lady, to whom we have such obligations
as I cannot mention, even to you, with∣out
blushing.</P>
<P>To-morrow we shall bid adieu to the
Scotch Arcadia, and begin our progress
to the southward, taking our way by La∣nerk
and Nithsdale, to the west borders
of England. I have received so much
advantage and satisfaction from this tour,
that if my health suffers no revolution in
the winter, I believe I shall be tempted
to undertake another expedition to the

<OPENER>To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.
MY DEAREST LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>NEVER did poor prisoner long for
deliverance, more than I have longed for
an opportunity to disburthen my cares in∣to
your friendly bosom; and the occa∣sion
which now presents itself, is little less
than miraculous—Honest Saunders Mac∣awly,
the travelling Scotchman, who goes
every year to Wales, is now at Glasgow,
buying goods, and coming to pay his re∣spects
to our family, has undertaken to
deliver this letter into your own hand—
We have been six weeks in Scotland, and
seen the principal towns of the kingdom,
where we have been treated with great ci∣vility—The
people are very courteous;
and the country being exceedingly ro∣mantic,
suits my turn and inclinations—
I contracted some friendships at Edin∣burgh,
which is a large and lofty city,
full of gay company; and, in particular,
commenced an intimate correspondence
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
with one miss R—t—n, an amiable
young lady of my own age, whose charms
seemed to soften, and even to subdue the
stubborn heart of my brother Jery; but
he no sooner left the place than he re∣lapsed
into his former insensibility—I
feel, however, that this indifference is
not the family-constitution—I never ad∣mitted
but one idea of love, and that has
taken such root in my heart, as to be e∣qually
proof against all the pulls of dis∣cretion,
and the frosts of neglect.</P>
<P>Dear Letty! I had an alarming adven∣ture
at the hunters ball in Edinburgh—
While I sat discoursing with a friend in a
corner, all at once the very image of Wil∣son
stood before me, dressed exactly as
he was in the character of Aimwell! It
was one Mr. Gordon, whom I had not seen
before—Shocked at the sudden appari∣tion,
I fainted away, and threw the whole
assembly in confusion—However, the
cause of my disorder remained a secret to
every body but my brother, who was
likewise struck with the resemblance, and
scolded after we came home—I am very
sensible of Jery's affection, and know he
spoke as well with a view to my own in∣terest
and happiness, as in regard to the
honour of the family; but I cannot bear
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
to have my wounds probed severely—I
was not so much affected by the censure
he passed upon my own indiscretion, as
with the reflection he made on the con∣duct
of Wilson—He observed, that if he
was really the gentleman he pretended to
be, and harboured nothing but honour∣able
designs, he would have vindicated
his pretensions in the face of day—This
remark made a deep impression upon my
mind—I endeavoured to conceal my
thoughts; and this endeavour had a bad
effect upon my health and spirits; so it
was thought necessary that I should go to
the Highlands, and drink the goat-milk∣whey.</P>
<P>We went accordingly to Lough-Lo∣mond,
one of the most enchanting spots
in the whole world; and what with this
remedy, which I had every morning fresh
from the mountains, and the pure air,
and chearful company, I have recovered
my flesh and appetite; though there is
something still at bottom, which it is not
in the power of air, exercise, company, or
medicine to remove—These incidents
would not touch me so nearly, if I had a
sensible confidant to sympathize with my
affliction, and comfort me with whole∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome
advice—I have nothing of this kind,
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
except Win Jenkins, who is really a good
body in the main, but very ill qualified
for such an office—The poor creature is
weak in her nerves, as well as in her un∣derstanding;
otherwise I might have
known the true name and character of
that unfortunate youth—But why do I
call him <HI>unfortunate?</HI> perhaps the epithet
is more applicable to me for having listen∣ed
to the false professions of—But,
hold! I have as yet no right, and sure I
have no inclination to believe any thing
to the prejudice of his honour—In that
reflection I shall still exert my patience—
As for Mrs. Jenkins, she herself is really
an object of compassion—Between vani∣ty,
methodism, and love, her head is al∣most
turned. I should have more regard
for her, however, if she had been more
constant in the object of her affection;
but, truly, she aimed at conquest, and
flirted at the same time with my uncle's
footman, Humphry Clinker, who is re∣ally
a deserving young man, and one Dut∣ton,
my brother's valet de chambre, a
debauched fellow; who, leaving Win in
the lurch, ran away with another man's
bride at Berwick.</P>
<P>My dear Willis, I am truly ashamed of
my own sex—We complain of advan∣tages
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
which the men take of our youth,
inexperience, sensibility, and all that;
but I have seen enough to believe, that
our sex in general make it their business
to ensnare the other; and for this pur∣pose,
employ arts which are by no means
to be justified—In point of constancy,
they certainly have nothing to reproach
the male part of the creation—My poor
aunt, without any regard to her years and
imperfections, has gone to market with
her charms in every place where she
thought she had the least chance to dis∣pose
of her person, which, however,
hangs still heavy on her hands—I am a∣fraid
she has used even religion as a de∣coy,
though it has not answered her ex∣pectation—She
has been praying, preach∣ing,
and catechising among the metho∣dists,
with whom this country abounds;
and pretends to have such manifesta∣tions
and revelations, as even Clinker
himself can hardly believe, though the
poor fellow is half crazy with enthusiasm.
As for Jenkins, she affects to take all her
mistress's reveries for gospel—She has al∣so
her heart-heavings and motions of the
spirit; and God forgive me if I think un∣charitably,
but all this seems to me to
be downright hypocrisy and deceit—Per∣haps,
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
indeed, the poor girl imposes on
herself—She is generally in a flutter, and
is much subject to vapours—Since we
came to Scotland, she has seen appari∣tions,
and pretends to prophesy—If I
could put faith in all these supernatural
visitations, I should think myself aban∣doned
of grace; for I have neither seen,
heard, nor felt any thing of this nature,
although I endeavour to discharge the du∣ties
of religion with all the sincerity,
zeal, and devotion, that is in the power

<OPENER>To Mrs. MARY JONES, at Bramble∣ton-hall.
DEAR MARY,</OPENER>
<P>SUNDERS MACULLY, the Scotch∣man,
who pushes directly for Vails, has
promised to give it you into your own
hand, and therefore I would not miss the
oportunity to let you now as I am still in
the land of the living; and yet I have
been on the brink of the other world
since I sent you my last letter.—We went
by sea to another kingdom called Fife,
and coming back, had like to have gone
to pot in a storm.—What between the
frite and sickness, I thought I should have
brought my heart up; even Mr. Clinker
was not his own man for eight and forty
hours after we got ashore.—It was well
for some folks that we scaped drownding;
for mistress was very frexious, and seem∣ed
but indifferently prepared for a change;
but, thank God, she was soon put in a
better frame by the private exaltations of
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
the reverend Mr. Macrocodile.—We af∣terwards
churned to Starling and Gras∣cow,
which are a kiple of handsome
towns; and then we went to a gentle∣man's
house at Loff-Loming, which is a
wonderful sea of fresh water, with a
power of hylands in the midst on't.—
They say as how it has got n'er a bot∣tom,
and was made by a musician; and,
truly, I believe it; for it is not in the
coarse of nature.—It has got <HI>waves with∣out
wind, fish without fins, and a floating
hyland;</HI> and one of them is a crutch-yard,
where the dead are buried; and always
before the person dies, a bell rings of it∣self
to give warning.</P>
<P>O Mary! this is the land of congyra∣tion—The
bell knolled when we were there
—I saw lights, and heard lamentations.—
The gentleman, our landlord, has got
another house, which he was fain to quit,
on account of a mischievious ghost, that
would not suffer people to lie in their
beds.—The fairies dwell in a hole of
Kairmann, a mounting hard by; and
they steal away the good women that are
in the straw, if so be as how there a'n't a
horshoe nailed to the door: and I was
shewn an ould vitch, called Elspath Ring∣avey,
with a red petticoat, bleared eyes,
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
and a mould of grey bristles on her sin.—
That she mought do me no harm, I
crossed her hand with a taster, and bid
her tell my fortune; and she told me such
things—descriving Mr. Clinker to a hair
—but it shall ne'er be said, that I min∣chioned
a word of the matter.—As I was
troubled with fits, she advised me to bathe
in the loff, which was holy water; and
so I went in the morning to a private
place along with the house-maid, and we
bathed in our birth-day soot, after the fa∣shion
of the country; and behold, whilst
we dabbled in the loff, sir Gorge Coon
started up with a gun; but we clapt our
hands to our faces, and passed by him to
the place where we had left our smocks—
A civil gentleman would have turned his
head another way.—My comfit is, he
new not which was which; and, as the
saying is, <HI>all cats in the dark are grey.</HI>—
Whilst we stayed at Loff-Loming, he and
our two squires went three or four days
churning among the wild men of the
mountings; a parcel of selvidges that lie
in caves among the rocks, devour young
children, speak Velch, but the vords are
different. Our ladies would not part with
Mr. Clinker, because he is so stout, and so
pyehouse, that he fears neither man nor
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
devils, if so be as they don't take him by
surprise.—Indeed, he was once so flurried
by an operition, that he had like to have
sounded.—He made believe as if it had
been the ould edmiral; but the ould ed∣miral
could not have made his air to
stand on end, and his teeth to shatter;
but he said so in prudence, that the ladies
mought not be affear'd. Miss Liddy has
been puny, and like to go into a decline
—I doubt her pore art is too tinder—but
the got's-fey has sat her on her legs again.
—You nows got's-fey is mother's milk
to a Velchvoman. As for mistress, bles∣sed

</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. at
Oxon.
DEAR KNIHGT,</OPENER>
<P>ONCE more I tread upon English
ground, which I like not the worse for
the six weeks' ramble I have made among
the woods and mountains of Caledonia;
no offence to the <HI>land of cakes, where ban∣nocks
grow upon straw.</HI> I never saw my
uncle in such health and spirits as he
now enjoys. Liddy is perfectly recovered;
and Mrs. Tabitha has no reason to com∣plain.
Nevertheless, I believe, she was,
till yesterday, inclined to give the whole
Scotch nation to the devil, as a pack of
insensible brutes, upon whom her accom∣plishments
had been displayed in vain.—
At every place where we halted, did she
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
mount the stage, and flourished her rusty
arms, without being able to make one
conquest. One of her last essays was
against the heart of sir George Colquhoun,
with whom she fought all the weapons
more than twice over.—She was grave and
gay by turns—she moralized and metho∣dized—she
laughed, and romped, and
danced, and sung, and sighed, and ogled,
and lisped, and fluttered, and flattered—
but all was preaching to the desart—The
baronet, being a well-bred man, carried
his civilities as far as she could in con∣science
expect, and, if evil tongues
are to be believed, some degrees farther;
but he was too much a veteran in gallan∣try,
as well as in war, to fall into any
ambuscade that she could lay for his affec∣tion.—While
we were absent in the High∣lands,
she practised also upon the laird
of Ladrishmore, and even gave him the
rendezvous in the wood of Drumscail∣loch;
but the laird had such a reverend
care of his own reputation, that he came
attended with the parson of the parish,
and nothing passed but spiritual commu∣nication.—After
all these miscarriages,
our aunt suddenly recollected lieutenant
Lismahago, whom, ever since our first
arrival at Edinburgh, she seemed to have
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
utterly forgot; but now she expressed
her hopes of seeing him at Dumfries, ac∣cording
to his promise.</P>
<P>We set out from Glasgow by the way
of Lanerk, the county-town of Clydes∣dale,
in the neighbourhood of which, the
whole river Clyde, rushing down a steep
rock, forms a very noble and stupendous
cascade. Next day we were obliged to
halt in a small borough, until the car∣riage,
which had received some damage,
should be repaired; and here we met
with an incident which warmly in∣terested
the benevolent spirit of Mr.
Bramble.—As we stood at the window of
an inn that fronted the public prison, a
person arrived on horseback, genteelly,
tho' plainly, dressed in a blue frock, with
his own hair cut short, and a gold-laced
hat upon his head.—Alighting, and giving
his horse to the landlord, he advanced to
an old man who was at work in paving
the street, and accosted him in these
words: “This is hard work for such an
old man as you.”—So saying, he took
the instrument out of his hand, and be∣gan
to thump the pavement.—After a
few strokes, “Have you never a son
(said he) to ease you of this labour?”
“Yes, an please your honour, (replied
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
the senior) I have three hopeful lads,
but, at present, they are out of the
way.” “Honour not me (cried the
stranger); it more becomes me to ho∣nour
your grey hairs.—Where are
those sons you talk of?” The ancient
paviour said, his eldest son was a captain
in the East-Indies; and the youngest had
lately inlisted as a soldier, in hopes of
prospering like his brother. The gentle∣man
desiring to know what was become
of the second, he wiped his eyes, and
owned, he had taken upon him his old
father's debts, for which he was now in
the prison hard by.</P>
<P>The traveller made three quick steps
towards the jail, then turning short,
“Tell me, (said he) has that unnatural
captain sent you nothing to relieve
your distresses?” “Call him not un∣natural
(replied the other); God's
blessing be upon him! he sent me a
great deal of money; but I made a
bad use of it; I lost it by being securi∣ty
for a gentleman that was my land∣lord,
and was stript of all I had in the
world besides.” At that instant a
young man, thrusting out his head and
neck between two iron bars in the prison-window,
exclaimed, “Father! father!
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
if my brother William is in life, that's
he!” “I am!—I am!—(cried the
stranger, clasping the old man in his
arms, and shedding a flood of tears)—
I am your son Willy, sure enough!”
Before the father, who was quite con∣founded,
could make any return to this
tenderness, a decent old woman bolting
out from the door of a poor habitation,
cried, “Where is my bairn? where is
my dear Willy?”—The captain no
sooner beheld her, than he quitted his fa∣ther,
and ran into her embrace.</P>
<P>I can assure you, my uncle, who saw
and heard every thing that passed, was
as much moved as any one of the parties
concerned in this pathetic recognition.—
He sobbed, and wept, and clapped his
hands, and hollowed, and finally ran
down into the street. By this time, the
captain had retired with his parents, and
all the inhabitants of the place were assem∣bled
at the door.—Mr. Bramble, never∣theless,
pressed thro' the crowd, and enter∣ing
the house, “Captain, (said he) I beg
the favour of your acquaintance—I
would have travelled a hundred miles
to see this affecting scene; and I shall
think myself happy, if you and your
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
parents will dine with me at the public
house.” The captain thanked him for
his kind invitation, which, he said, he
would accept with pleasure; but, in the
mean time, he could not think of eating
or drinking, while his poor brother was in
trouble.—He forthwith deposited a sum
equal to the debt in the hands of the ma∣gistrate,
who ventured to set his brother
at liberty without farther process; and
then the whole family repaired to the inn
with my uncle, attended by the crowd,
the individuals of which shook their
townsman by the hand, while he returned
their caresses without the least sign of
pride or affectation.</P>
<P>This honest favourite of fortune, whose
name was Brown, told my uncle, that he
had been bred a weaver, and, about eigh∣teen
years ago, had, from a spirit of
idleness and dissipation, enlisted as a sol∣dier
in the service of the East-India com∣pany;
that, in the course of duty, he had
the good fortune to attract the notice and
approbation of lord Clive, who preferred
him from one step to another, till he at∣tained
the rank of captain and pay-mas∣ter
to the regiment, in which capacities
he had honestly amassed above twelve
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
thousand pounds, and, at the peace, re∣signed
his commission.—He had sent se∣veral
remittances to his father, who re∣ceived
the first only, consisting of one
hundred pounds; the second had fallen
into the hands of a bankrupt; and the
third had been consigned to a gentleman
of Scotland, who died before it arrived;
so that it still remained to be accounted
for by his executors. He now presented
the old man with fifty pounds for his pre∣sent
occasions, over and above bank notes
for one hundred, which he had deposited
for his brother's release.—He brought
along with him a deed ready executed,
by which he settled a perpetuity of four∣score
pounds upon his parents, to be in∣herited
by their other two sons after their
decease.—He promised to purchase a
commission for his youngest brother; to
take the other as his own partner in a
manufacture which he intended to set up,
to give employment and bread to the in∣dustrious;
and to give five hundred
pounds, by way of dower, to his sister,
who had married a farmer in low circum∣stances.—Finally,
he gave fifty pounds
to the poor of the town where he was
born, and feasted all the inhabitants with∣out
exception.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78"/>
My uncle was so charmed with the cha∣racter
of captain Brown, that he drank
his health three times successively at din∣ner.—He
said, he was proud of his ac∣quaintance;
that he was an honour to
his country, and had in some measure re∣deemed
human nature from the reproach
of pride, selfishness, and ingratitude.—
For my part, I was as much pleased with
the modesty as with the filial virtue of
this honest soldier, who assumed no merit
from his success, and said very little of
his own transactions, though the answers
he made to our inquiries were equally sen∣sible
and laconic. Mrs. Tabitha behaved
very graciously to him until she under∣stood
that he was going to make a tender
of his hand to a person of low estate, who
had been his sweet-heart while he worked
as a journeyman-weaver.—Our aunt was
no sooner made acquainted with this de∣sign,
than she starched up her behaviour
with a double proportion of reserve; and
when the company broke up, she observ∣ed,
with a toss of her nose, that Brown
was a civil fellow enough, considering
the lowness of his origin; but that For∣tune,
though she had mended his cir∣cumstances,
was incapable to raise his
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
ideas, which were still humble and ple∣beian.</P>
<P>On the day that succeeded this adven∣ture,
we went some miles out of our road
to see Drumlanrig, a seat belonging to the
duke of Queensberry, which appears like
a magnificent palace erected by magic,
in the midst of a wilderness.—It is indeed
a princely mansion, with suitable parks
and plantations, rendered still more strik∣ing
by the nakedness of the surrounding
country, which is one of the wildest tracts
in all Scotland.—This wildness, however,
is different from that of the Highlands; for
here the mountains, instead of heath, are
covered with a fine green swarth, afford∣ing
pasture to innumerable flocks of sheep.
But the fleeces of this country, called
Nithsdale, are not comparable to the
wool of Galloway, which is said to equal
that of Salisbury plain. Having passed
the night at the castle of Drumlanrig, by
invitation from the duke himself, who is
one of the best men that ever breathed,
we prosecuted our journey to Dumfries, a
very elegant trading town near the bor∣ders
of England, where we found plenty
of good provision and excellent wine, at
very reasonable prices, and the accommo∣dation
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
as good in all respects as in any
part of South-Britain.—If I was confined
to Scotland for life, I would chuse Dum∣fries
as the place of my residence. Here we
made enquiries about captain Lismahago,
of whom hearing no tidings, we proceed∣ed,
by the Solway Frith, to Carlisle. You
must know, that the Solway sands, upon
which travellers pass at low water, are ex∣ceedingly
dangerous, because, as the tide
makes, they become quick in different
places, and the flood rushes in so impe∣tuously,
that passengers are often over∣taken
by the sea, and perish.</P>
<P>In crossing these treacherous Syrtes with
a guide, we perceived a drowned horse,
which Humphry Clinker, after due in∣spection,
declared to be the very identical
beast which Mr. Lismahago rode when
he parted with us at Felton-bridge in Nor∣thumberland.
This information, which
seemed to intimate that our friend the
lieutenant had shared the fate of his horse,
affected us all, and above all our aunt
Tabitha, who shed salt tears, and obliged
Clinker to pull a few hairs out of the
dead horse's tail, to be worn in a ring as
a remembrance of his master: but her
grief and ours was not of long duration;
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
for one of the first persons we saw in Car∣lisle,
was the lieutenant <HI>in propria pers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na,</HI>
bargaining with a horse-dealer for another
steed, in the yard of the inn where we
alighted.—Mrs. Bramble was the first
that perceived him, and screamed as if she
had seen a ghost; and, truly, at a proper
time and place, he might very well have
passed for an inhabitant of another world;
for he was more meagre and grim than
before.—We received him the more cor∣dially
for having supposed he had been
drowned; and he was not deficient in ex∣pressions
of satisfaction at this meeting.—
He told us, he had enquired for us at
Dumfries, and been informed by a travel∣ling
merchant from Glasgow, that we
had resolved to return by the way of
Coldstream.—He said, that in passing the
sands without a guide, his horse had
knocked up; and he himself must have
perished, if he had not been providential∣ly
relieved by a return post-chaise.—He
moreover gave us to understand, that his
scheme of settling in his own country
having miscarried, he was so far on his
way to London, with a view to embark
for North-America, where he intended to
pass the rest of his days among his old
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
friends the Miamis, and amuse himself in
finishing the education of the son he had
by his beloved Squinkinacoosta.</P>
<P>This project was by no means agreeable
to our good aunt, who expatiated upon
the fatigues and dangers that would at∣tend
such a long voyage by sea, and after∣wards
such a tedious journey by land—
She enlarged particularly on the risque he
would run, with respect to the concerns of
his precious soul, among savages who
had not yet received the glad tidings of
salvation; and she hinted that his aban∣doning
Great-Britain might, perhaps,
prove fatal to the inclinations of some de∣serving
person, whom he was qualified to
make happy for life. My uncle, who is
really a Don Quixote in generosity, under∣standing
that Lismahago's real reason
for leaving Scotland was the impossibility
of subsisting in it with any decency upon
the wretched provision of a subaltern's
half-pay, began to be warmly interested
on the side of compassion.—He thought it
very hard, that a gentleman who had
served his country with honour, should be
driven by necessity to spend his old age,
among the refuse of mankind, in such a
remote part of the world.—He discoursed
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
with me upon the subject; observing,
that he would willingly offer the lieute∣nant
an asylum at Brambleton-hall, if he
did not foresee that his singularities and
humour of contradiction would render
him an intolerable house-mate, though his
conversation at some times might be both
instructive and entertaining: but, as
there seemed to be something particular
in his attention to Mrs. Tabitha, he and I
agreed in opinion, that this intercourse
should be encouraged, and improved, if
possible, into a matrimonial union; in
which case there would be a comfortable
provision for both; and they might be
settled in a house of their own, so that
Mr. Bramble should have no more of their
company than he desired.</P>
<P>In pursuance of this design, Lismahago
has been invited to pass the winter at
Brambleton-hall, as it will be time enough
to execute his American project in the
spring.—He has taken time to consider of
this proposal; mean while, he will keep
us company as far as we travel in the
road to Bristol, where he has hopes of
getting a passage for America. I make no
doubt but that he will postpone his voy∣age,
and prosecute his addresses to a hap∣py
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
consummation; and sure, if it pro∣duces
any fruit, it must be of a very pe∣culiar
flavour. As the weather continues
favourable, I believe, we shall take the
Peak of Derbyshire and Buxton Wells in
our way.—At any rate, from the first
place where we make any stay, you shall

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>THE peasantry of Scotland are cer∣tainly
on a poor footing all over the king∣dom;
and yet they look better, and are
better cloathed than those of the same
rank in Burgundy, and many other places
of France and Italy; nay, I will venture
to say they are better fed, notwithstand∣ing
the boasted wine of these foreign
countries. The country people of North-Britain
live chiefly on oat-meal, and milk,
cheese, butter, and some garden-stuff,
with now and then a pickled-herring, by
way of delicacy; but flesh-meat they sel∣dom
or never taste; nor any kind of
strong liquor, except two-penny, at times
of uncommon festivity—Their breakfast
is a kind of hasty pudding, of oat-meal
or pease-meal, eaten with milk. They
have commonly pottage to dinner, com∣posed
of cale or cole, leeks, barley or
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
big, and butter; and this is reinforced
with bread and cheese, made of skimmed-milk—At
night they sup on sowens or
flummery of oat-meal—In a scarcity of
oats, they use the meal of barley and
pease, which is both nourishing and pa∣latable.
Some of them have potatoes;
and you find parsnips in every peasant's
garden—They are cloathed with a coarse
kind of russet of their own making,
which is both decent and warm—They
dwell in poor huts, built of loose stones
and turf, without any mortar, having a
fire-place or hearth in the middle, gene∣rally
made of an old mill-stone, and a
hole at top to let out the smoke.</P>
<P>These people, however, are content,
and wonderfully sagacious—All of them
read the Bible, and are even qualified to
dispute upon the articles of their faith;
which, in those parts I have seen, is en∣tirely
Presbyterian. I am told, that the
inhabitants of Aberdeenshire are still more
acute. I once knew a Scotch gentleman
at London, who had declared war against
this part of his countrymen; and swore
that the impudence and knavery of the
Scots, in that quarter, had brought a re∣proach
upon the whole nation.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87"/>
The river Clyde, above Glasgow, is
quite pastoral; and the banks of it are
every where adorned with fine villas.
From the sea to its source, we may reckon
the seats of many families of the first rank,
such as the duke of Argyle at Roseneath,
the earl of Bute in the isle of that name,
the earl of Glencairn at Finlayston, lord
Blantyre at Areskine, the dutchess of
Douglas at Bothwell, duke Hamilton at
Hamilton, the duke of Douglas at
Douglas, and the earl of Hyndford at
Carmichael. Hamilton is a noble pa∣lace,
magnificently furnished; and hard
by is the village of that name, one of the
neatest little towns I have seen in any
country. The old castle of Douglas be∣ing
burned to the ground by accident,
the late duke resolved, as head of the first
family in Scotland, to have the largest
house in the kingdom, and ordered a
plan for this purpose; but there was only
one wing of it finished when he died. It
is to be hoped that his nephew, who is
now in possession of his great fortune, will
complete the design of his predecessor—
Clydesdale is in general populous and
rich, containing a great number of gen∣tlemen,
who are independent in their for∣tune;
but it produces more cattle than
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
corn—This is also the case with Twee∣dale,
through part of which we passed,
and Nidsdale, which is generally rough,
wild, and mountainous—These hills are
covered with sheep; and this is the small
delicious mutton, so much preferable to
that of the London-market. As their
feeding costs so little, the sheep are not
killed till five years old, when their flesh,
juices, and flavour, are in perfection;
but their fleeces are much damaged by
the tar, with which they are smeared to
preserve them from the rot in winter, dur∣ing
which they run wild night and day,
and thousands are lost under huge
wreaths of snow—'Tis pity the farmers
cannot contrive some means to shelter
this useful animal from the inclemencies
of a rigorous climate, especially from the
perpetual rains, which are more prejudi∣cial
than the greatest extremity of cold
weather.</P>
<P>On the little river Nid, is situated the
castle of Drumlanrig, one of the noblest
seats in Great-Britain, belonging to the
duke of Queensberry; one of those few
noblemen whose goodness of heart does
honour to human-nature—I shall not pre∣tend
to enter into a description of this
palace, which is really an instance of the
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
sublime in magnificence, as well as in
situation, and puts one in mind of the
beautiful city of Palmyra, rising like a
vision in the midst of the wilderness.
His grace keeps open house, and lives
with great splendour—He did us the ho∣nour
to receive us with great courtesy,
and detain us all night, together with a∣bove
twenty other guests, with all their
servants and horses, to a very considera∣ble
number—The dutchess was equally
gracious, and took our ladies under her
immediate protection. The longer I live,
I see more reason to believe that preju∣dices
of education are never wholly era∣dicated,
even when they are discovered
to be erroneous and absurd. Such ha∣bits
of thinking as interest the grand pas∣sions,
cleave to the human heart in such
a manner, that though an effort of rea∣son
may force them from their hold for a
moment, this violence no sooner ceases,
than they resume their grasp with an en∣creased
elasticity and adhesion.</P>
<P>I am led into this reflection, by what
passed at the duke's table after supper.
The conversation turned upon the vulgar
notions of spirits and omens, that prevail
among the commonalty of North-Britain,
and all the company agreed, that nothing
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
could be more ridiculous. One gentle∣man,
however, told a remarkable story
of himself, by way of speculation—“Be∣ing
on a party of hunting in the North,
(said he) I resolved to visit an old
friend, whom I had not seen for twen∣ty
years—So long he had been retired
and sequestered from all his acquain∣tance,
and lived in a moping melan∣choly
way, much afflicted with low∣ness
of spirits, occasioned by the death
of his wife, whom he had loved with
uncommon affection. As he resided
in a remote part of the country, and
we were five gentlemen with as many
servants, we carried some provision with
us from the next market town, lest we
should find him unprepared for our re∣ception.
The roads being bad, we
did not arrive at the house till two
o'clock in the afternoon; and were a∣greeably
surprised to find a very good
dinner ready in the kitchen, and the
cloth laid with six covers. My friend
himself appeared in his best apparel at
the gate, and received us with open
arms, telling me he had been expect∣ing
us these two hours—Astonished at
this declaration, I asked who had given
him intelligence of our coming? and
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
he smiled without making any other
reply—However, presuming upon our
former intimacy, I afterwards insisted
upon knowing; and he told me, very
gravely, he had seen me in a vision of
the second sight—Nay, he called in the
evidence of his steward, who solemnly
declared, that his master had the day
before apprised him of my coming,
with four other strangers, and ordered
him to provide accordingly; in conse∣quence
of which intimation, he had
prepared the dinner which we were now
eating; and laid the covers according
to the number foretold.” The incident
we all owned to be remarkable, and I en∣deavoured
to account for it by natural
means. I observed, that as the gentle∣man
was of a visionary turn, the casual
idea, or remembrance of his old friend,
might suggest those circumstances, which
accident had for once realized; but that
in all probability he had seen many vi∣sions
of the same kind, which were never
verified. None of the company directly
dissented from my opinion; but from the
objections that were hinted, I could plain∣ly
perceive, that the majority were per∣suaded
there was something more extra∣ordinary
in the case.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92"/>
Another gentlemen of the company,
addressing himself to me, “Without all
doubt, (said he) a diseased imagina∣tion
is very apt to produce visions; but
we must find some other method to ac∣count
for something of this kind, that
happened within these eight days in my
neighbourhood—A gentleman of a
good family, who cannot be deemed a
visionary in any sense of the word, was
near his own gate, in the twilight, vi∣sited
by his grandfather, who has been
dead these fifteen years—The spectre
was mounted seemingly on the very
horse he used to ride, with an angry
and terrible countenance, and said
something, which his grandson, in the
confusion of his fear, could not under∣stand.
But this was not all—He lifted
up a huge horse-whip, and applied it
with great violence to his back and
shoulders, on which I saw the impres∣sion
with my own eyes. The appari∣tion
was afterwards seen by the sexton
of the parish, hovering about the tomb
where his body lies interred; as the
man declared to several persons in the
village, before he knew what had hap∣pened
to the gentleman—Nay, he ac∣tually
came to me as a justice of the
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
peace, in order to make oath of these
particulars, which, however, I declin∣ed
administering. As for the grandson
of the defunct, he is a sober, sensible,
worldly-minded fellow, too intent up∣on
schemes of interest to give into re∣veries.
He would have willingly con∣cealed
the affair; but he bawled out
in the first transport of his fear, and,
running into the house, exposed his
back and his sconce to the whole fami∣ly;
so that there was no denying it in
the sequel. It is now the common dis∣course
of the country, that this ap∣pearance
and behaviour of the old
man's spirit, portends some great cala∣mity
to the family, and the good wo∣man
has actually taken to her bed in
this apprehension.”</P>
<P>Though I did not pretend to explain
this mystery, I said, I did not at all
doubt, but it would one day appear to be
a deception; and, in all probability, a
scheme executed by some enemy of the
person who had sustained the assault;
but still the gentleman insisted upon the
clearness of the evidence, and the concur∣rence
of testimony, by which two credi∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble
witnesses, without any communica∣tion
one with another, affirmed the ap∣pearance
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
of the same man, with whose
person they were both well acquainted—
From Drumlanrig we pursued the course
of the Nid to D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umfries, which stands
several miles above the place where the
river falls into the sea; and is, after Glas∣gow,
the handsomest town I have seen in
Scotland—The inhabitants, indeed, seem
to have proposed that city as their model;
not only in beautifying their town and re∣gulating
its police, but also in prosecut∣ing
their schemes of commerce and ma∣nufacture,
by which they are grown rich
and opulent.</P>
<P>We re-entered England, by the way
of Carlisle, where we accidentally met
with our friend Lismahago, whom we had
in vain inquired after at Dumfries and
other places—It would seem that the cap∣tain,
like the prophets of old, is but lit∣tle
honoured in his own country, which
he has now renounced for ever—He gave
me the following particulars of his visit
to his native soil—In his way to the place
of his nativity, he learned that his ne∣phew
had married the daughter of a
burgeois, who directed a weaving manu∣facture,
and had gone into partnership
with his father-in-law: chagrined with
this information, he had arrived at the
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
gate in the twilight, where he heard the
sound of treddles in the great hall, which
had exasperated him to such a degree,
that he had like to have lost his senses:
while he was thus transported with indig∣nation,
his nephew chanced to come
forth, when, being no longer master of
his passion, he cried, “Degenerate ras∣cal!
you have made my father's house
a den of thieves;” and at the same time
chastised him with his horse-whip; then,
riding round the adjoining village, he
had visited the burying-ground of his an∣cestors
by moon-light; and, having paid
his respects to their <HI>manes,</HI> travelled all
night to another part of the country—
Finding the head of his family in such a
disgraceful situation, all his own friends
dead or removed from the places of their
former residence, and the expence of
living encreased to double of what it had
been, when he first left his native coun∣try,
he had bid it an eternal adieu, and
was determined to seek for repose among
the forests of America.</P>
<P>I was no longer at a loss to account for
the apparition, which had been described
at Drumlanrig; and when I repeated the
story to the lieutenant, he was much
pleased to think his resentment had been
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
so much more effectual than he intended;
and he owned, he might at such an hour,
and in such an equipage, very well pass
for the ghost of his father, whom he was
said greatly to resemble—Between
friends, I fancy Lismahago will find a re∣treat
without going so far as the wig∣wams
of the Miamis. My sister Tabby
is making continual advances to him, in
the way of affection; and, if I may trust to
appearances, the captain is disposed to
take opportunity by the forelock. For
my part, I intend to encourage this cor∣respondence,
and shall be glad to see them
united—In that case, we shall find a way
to settle them comfortably in our own
neighbourhood. I, and my servants,
will get rid of a very troublesome and ty∣rannic
gouvernante; and I shall have the
benefit of Lismahago's conversation,
without being obliged to take more of his
company than I desire; for though an
olla is a high-flavoured dish, I could not
bear to dine upon it every day of my life.</P>
<P>I am much pleased with Manchester,
which is one of the most agreeable and
flourishing towns in Great-Britain; and I
perceive that this is the place which hath
animated the spirit, and suggested the chief
manufactures of Glasgow. We propose
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
to visit Chatsworth, the Peak, and Buxton,
from which last place we shall proceed di∣rectly
homewards, though by easy jour∣nies.
If the season has been as favourable
in Wales as in the North, your harvest is
happily finished; and we have nothing
left to think of but our October, of
which let Barns be properly reminded.
You will find me much better in flesh than
I was at our parting; and this short sepa∣ration

<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>LISMAHAGO is more paradoxical than
ever.—The late gulp he had of his native
air, seems to have blown fresh spirit into
all his polemical faculties. I congratulat∣ed
him the other day on the present flou∣rishing
state of his country, observing
that the Scots were now in a fair way to
wipe off the national reproach of pover∣ty,
and expressing my satisfaction at the
happy effects of the union, so conspicu∣ous
in the improvement of their agricul∣ture,
commerce, manufactures, and man∣ners—
The lieutenant, screwing up his
features into a look of dissent and disgust,
commented on my remarks to this effect—
“Those who reproach a nation for its po∣verty,
when it is not owing to the
profligacy or vice of the people, de∣serve
no answer. The Lacedaemonians
were poorer than the Scots, when they
took the lead among all the free states
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
of Greece, and were esteemed above
them all for their valour and their vir∣tue.
The most respectable heroes of
ancient Rome, such as Fabricius, Cin∣cinnatus,
and Regulus, were poorer
than the poorest freeholder in Scotland;
and there are at this day individuals in
North-Britain, one of whom can pro∣duce
more gold and silver than the
whole republic of Rome could raise at
those times when her public virtue shone
with unrivalled lustre; and poverty was
so far from being a reproach, that it
added fresh laurels to her fame, because
it indicated a noble contempt of wealth,
which was proof against all the arts of
corruption—If poverty be a subject for
reproach, it follows that wealth is the
object of esteem and veneration—In
that case, there are Jews and others in
Amsterdam and London, enriched by
usury, peculation, and different spe∣cies
of fraud and extortion, who are
more estimable than the most virtuous
and illustrious members of the com∣munity.
An absurdity which no man
in his senses will offer to maintain.—
Riches are certainly no proof of me∣rit:
nay they are often (if not most
commonly) acquired by persons of sor∣did
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
minds and mean talents: nor do
they give any intrinsic worth to the pos∣sessor;
but, on the contrary, tend to
pervert his understanding, and render
his morals more depraved. But, grant∣ing
that poverty were really matter of
reproach, it cannot be justly imputed
to Scotland. No country is poor that
can supply its inhabitants with the ne∣cessaries
of life, and even afford arti∣cles
for exportation. Scotland is rich
in natural advantages: it produces
every species of provision in abundance,
vast herds of cattle and flocks of sheep,
with a great number of horses; pro∣digious
quantities of wool and flax,
with plenty of copse wood, and in some
parts large forests of timber. The
earth is still more rich below than above
the surface. It yields inexhaustible
stores of coal, free-stone, marble, lead,
iron, copper, and silver, with some gold.
The sea abounds with excellent fish,
and salt to cure them for exportation;
and there are creeks and harbours round
the whole kingdom, for the conveni∣ence
and security of navigation. The
face of the country displays a surprising
number of cities, towns, villas, and
villages, swarming with people; and
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
there seems to be no want of art, in∣dustry,
government, and police: such
a kingdom can never be called poor, in
any sense of the word, though there
may be many others more powerful
and opulent. But the proper use of
those advantages, and the present pro∣sperity
of the Scots, you seem to derive
from the union of the two kingdoms!”</P>
<P>I said, I supposed he would not deny
that the appearance of the country was
much mended; that the people lived bet∣ter,
had more trade, and a greater quan∣tity
of money circulating since the union,
than before. “I may safely admit these
premises, (answered the lieutenant)
without subscribing to your inference.
The difference you mention, I should
take to be the natural progress of
improvement—Since that period, other
nations, such as the Swedes, the
Danes, and in particular the French,
have greatly increased in commerce,
without any such cause assigned. Be∣fore
the union, there was a remarkable
spirit of trade among the Scots, as ap∣peared
in the case of their Darien com∣pany,
in which they had embarked no
less than four hundred thousand pounds
sterling; and in the flourishing state of
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
the maritime towns in Fife, and on the
eastern coast, enriched by their trade
with France, which failed in conse∣quence
of the union. The only solid
commercial advantage reaped from that
measure, was the privilege of trading
to the English plantations; yet, ex∣cepting
Glasgow and Dumfries, I don't
know any other Scotch towns concern∣ed
in that traffick. In other respects,
I conceive the Scots were losers by the
union.—They lost the independency of
their state, the greatest prop of nation∣al
spirit; they lost their parliament, and
their courts of justice were subjected
to the revision and supremacy of an
English tribunal.”</P>
<P>“Softly, captain, (cried I) you can∣not
be said to have lost your own par∣liament,
while you are represented in
that of Great-Britain.” “True, (said
he, with a sarcastic grin) in debates of
national competition, the sixteen peers
and forty-five commoners of Scotland,
must make a formidable figure in the
scale, against the whole English legis∣lature.”
“Be that as it may, (I ob∣served)
while I had the honour to sit in
the lower house, the Scotch members
had always the majority on their side.”
“I understand you, Sir, (said he) they
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
generally side with the majority; so
much the worse for their constituents.
But even this evil is not the worst they
have sustained by the union. Their
trade has been saddled with grievous
impositions, and every article of living
severely taxed, to pay the interest of
enormous debts, contracted by the
English, in support of measures and
connections in which the Scots had no
interest nor concern.” I begged he
would at least allow, that by the union
the Scots were admitted to all the privi∣leges
and immunities of English sub∣jects;
by which means multitudes of them
were provided for in the army and navy,
and got fortunes in different parts of Eng∣land,
and its dominions. “All these,
(said he) become English subjects to
all intents and purposes, and are in a
great measure lost to their mother-coun∣try.
The spirit of rambling and adventure
has been always peculiar to the natives of
Scotland. If they had not met with en∣couragement
in England, they would
have served and settled, as formerly, in
other countries, such as Muscovy,
Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Germany,
France, Piedmont, and Italy, in all
which nations their descendents conti∣nue
to flourish even at this day.”</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="107"/>
By this time my patience began to fail,
and I exclaimed, “For God's sake, what
has England got by this union which,
you say, has been so productive of mis∣fortune
to the Scots.” “Great and mani∣fold
are the advantages which England
derives from the union (said Lismaha∣go,
in a solemn tone.) First and fore∣most,
the settlement of the protestant
succession, a point which the English
ministry drove with such eagerness, that
no stone was left unturned, to cajole and
bribe a few leading men, to cram the
union down the throats of the Scottish
nation, who were surprisingly reverse to
the expedient. They gained by it a
considerable addition of territory, ex∣tending
their dominion to the sea on
all sides of the island, thereby shutting
up all back-doors against the enterprizes
of their enemies. They got an ac∣cession
of above a million of useful
subjects, constituting a never-failing
nursery of seamen, soldiers, labourers,
and mechanics; a most valuable acqui∣sition
to a trading country, exposed to
foreign wars, and obliged to maintain
a number of settlements in all the four
quarters of the globe. In the course
of seven years, during the last war, Scot∣land
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
furnished the English army and
navy with seventy thousand men, over
and above those who migrated to their
colonies, or mingled with them at home in
the civil departments of life. This was a
very considerable and seasonable supply
to a nation, whose people had been for
many years decreasing in number, and
whose lands and manufactures were ac∣tually
suffering for want of hands. I
need not remind you of the hackneyed
maxim, that, to a nation in such circum∣stances,
a supply of industrious people
is a supply of wealth; nor repeat an
observation, which is now received as an
eternal truth, even among the English
themselves, that the Scots who settle in
South Britain are remarkably sober,
orderly, and industrious.”</P>
<P>I allowed the truth of this remark, add∣ing,
that by their industry, oeconomy,
and circumspection, many of them in
England, as well as in her colonies,
amassed large fortunes, with which they
returned to their own country, and this
was so much lost to South-Britain.—
“Give me leave, sir, (said he) to assure
you, that in your fact you are mistaken,
and in your deduction, erroneous.—
Not one in two hundred that leave
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
Scotland ever returns to settle in his
own country; and the few that do re∣turn,
carry thither nothing that can
possibly diminish the stock of South-Britain;
for none of their treasure stag∣nates
in Scotland—There is a continual
circulation, like that of the blood in
the human body, and England is the
heart, to which all the streams which it
distributes are refunded and returned:
nay, in consequence of that luxury
which our connexion with England hath
greatly encouraged, if not introduced,
all the produce of our lands▪ and all
the profits of our trade, are engrossed
by the natives of South Britain; for
you will find that the exchange be∣tween
the two kingdoms is always
against Scotland; and that she retains
neither gold nor silver sufficient for her
own circulation.—The Scots, not con∣tent
with their own manufactures and
produce, which would very well an∣swer
all necessary occasions, seem to
vie with each other in purchasing super∣fluities
from England; such as broad∣cloth,
velvets, stuffs, silks, lace, furs,
jewels, furniture of all sorts, sugar,
rum, tea, chocolate, and coffee; in a
word, not only every mode of the
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
most extravagant luxury, but even
many articles of convenience, which
they might find as good, and much
cheaper in their own country. For all
these particulars, I conceive, England
may touch about one million ster∣ling
a-year.—I don't pretend to make
an exact calculation; perhaps, it may
be something less, and, perhaps, a
great deal more.—The annual revenue
arising from all the private estates of
Scotland cannot fall short of a million
sterling; and, I should imagine, their
trade will amount to as much more.—
I know, the linen manufacture alone
returns near half a million, exclusive
of the home-consumption of that arti∣cle.—
If, therefore, North-Britain pays
a balance of a million annually to Eng∣land,
I insist upon it, that country is
more valuable to her in the way of
commerce, than any colony in her pos∣session,
over and above the other advan∣tages
which I have specified: therefore,
they are no friends, either to England
or to truth, who affect to depreciate the
northern part of the united kingdom.”</P>
<P>I must own, I was at first a little net∣tled
to find myself schooled in so many
particulars.—Though I did not receive
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
all his assertions as gospel, I was not pre∣pared
to refute them; and I cannot help
now acquiescing in his remarks so far as
to think, that the contempt for Scotland,
which prevails too much on this side the
Tweed, is founded on prejudice and er∣ror.—
After some recollection, “Well,
captain, (said I) you have argued
stoutly for the importance of your own
country: for my part, I have such a
regard for our fellow-subjects of North-Britain,
that I shall be glad to see the
day, when your peasants can afford to
give all their oats to their cattle, hogs,
and poultry, and indulge themselves
with good wheaten loaves, instead of
such poor, unpalatable, and inflamma∣tory
diet.” Here again I brought my∣self
into a premunire with the disputa∣ceous
Caledonian. He said, he hoped
he should never see the common people
lifted out of that sphere for which they
were intended by nature and the course of
things; that they might have some reason
to complain of their bread, if it were mix∣ed,
like that of Norway, with saw-dust
and fish-bones; but that oatmeal was, he
apprehended, as nourishing and salutary
as wheat-flour, and the Scots in general
thought it at least as savoury.—He affirmed,
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
that a mouse, which, in the article of
self-preservation, might be supposed to
act from infallible instinct, would always
prefer oats to wheat, as appeared from ex∣perience;
for, in a place where there was
a parcel of each, that animal had never
begun to feed upon the latter till all
the oats were consumed: for their nutri∣tive
quality, he appealed to the hale, ro∣bust
constitutions of the people who lived
chiefly upon oatmeal; and, instead of
being inflammatory, he asserted, that it
was a cooling sub-acid, balsamic and
mucilaginous; insomuch, that in all in∣flammatory
distempers, recourse was had
to water-gruel, and flummery made of
oa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>meal.</P>
<P>“At least, (said I) give me leave to
wish them such a degree of commerce
as may enable them to follow their own
inclinations.”—“Heaven forbid!
(cried this philosopher) Woe be to
that nation, where the multitude is
at liberty to follow their own inclina∣tions!
Commerce is undoubtedly a
blessing, while restrained within its pro∣per
channels; but a glut of wealth
brings along with it a glut of evils:
it brings false taste, false appetite,
false wants, profusion, venality, con∣tempt
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
of order, engendering a spirit of
licentiousness, insolence, and faction,
that keeps the community in continual
ferment, and in time destroys all the
distinctions of civil society; so that
universal anarchy and uproar must en∣sue.
Will any sensible man affirm,
that the national advantages of opu∣lence
are to be sought on these terms?”
“No, sure; but I am one of those who
think, that, by proper regulations, com∣merce
may produce every national bene∣fit,
without the allay of such concomi∣tant
evils.”</P>
<P>So much for the dogmata of my friend
Lismahago, whom I describe the more
circumstantially, as I firmly believe he
will set up his rest in Monmouthshire.
Yesterday, while I was alone with him,
he asked, in some confusion, if I should
have any objection to the success of a gen∣tleman
and a soldier, provided he should
be so fortunate as to engage my sister's af∣fection.
I answered, without hesitation,
that my sister was old enough to judge for
herself; and that I should be very far
from disapproving any resolution she
might take in his favour.—His eyes
sparkled at this declaration. He de∣clared,
he should think himself the hap∣piest
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
man on earth to be connected with
my family; and that he should never be
weary of giving me proofs of his gratitude
and attachment. I suppose Tabby and
he are already agreed; in which case, we
shall have a wedding at Brambleton-hall,

DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>ADVENTURES begin to thicken as
we advance to the southward.—Lismaha∣go
has now professed himself the admirer
of our aunt, and carries on his addresses
under the sanction of her brother's appro∣bation;
so that we shall certainly have a
wedding by Christmas. I should be glad
you was present at the nuptials, to help
me to throw the stocking, and perform
other ceremonies peculiar to that occa∣sion—
I am sure it will be productive

be worth your while to come across
the country on purpose to see two such ori∣ginal
figures in bed together, with their
laced night-caps; he, the emblem of good
chear, and she, the picture of good na∣ture.
All this agreeable prospect was
clouded, and had well nigh vanished en∣tirely,
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
in consequence of a late misunder∣standing
between the future brothers-in-law,
which, however, is now happily
removed.</P>
<P>A few days ago, my uncle and I, going
to visit a relation, met with lord Oxming∣ton
at his house, who asked us to dine
with him next day, and we accepted the
invitation.—Accordingly, leaving our
women under the care of captain Lisma∣hago,
at the inn where we had lodged the
preceding night, in a little town, about a
mile from his lordship's dwelling, we
went at the hour appointed, and had a
fashionable meal served up with much
ostentation to a company of about a dozen
persons, none of whom we had ever seen
before.—His lordship is much more re∣markable
for his pride and caprice, than
for his hospitality and understanding;
and, indeed, it appeared, that he con∣sidered
his guests merely as objects to
shine upon, so as to reflect the lustre of
his own magnificence.—There was much
state, but no courtesy; and a great deal of
compliment without any conversation.—
Before the desert was removed, our noble
entertainer proposed three general toasts;
then calling for a glass of wine, and
bowing all round, wished us a good af∣ternoon.
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
This was the signal for the
company to break up, and they obeyed
it immediately, all except our 'squire, who
was greatly shocked at the manner of this
dismission.—He changed coutenance, bit
his lip in silence, but still kept his seat,
so that his lordship found himself obliged
to give us another hint, by saying, he
should be glad to see us another time.
“There is no time like the time present
(cried Mr. Bramble); your lordship has
not yet drank a bumper to <HI>the best in
Christendom.</HI>” “I'll drink no more bum∣pers
to-day (answered our landlord);
and I am sorry to see you have drank too
many.—Order the gentleman's carriage
to the gate.”—So saying, he rose and
retired abruptly; our 'squire starting up
at the same time, laying his hand upon
his sword, and eying him with a most fe∣rocious
aspect. The master having vanish∣ed
in this manner, our uncle bad one of
the servants to see what was to pay; and
the fellow answering, “This is no inn,”
“I cry you mercy, (cried the other) I
perceive it is not; if it were, the land∣lord
would be more civil.—There's a
guinea, however; take it, and tell
your lord, that I shall not leave the
country till I have had an opportunity
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/>
<PB N="118" REF="118"/>
the rage of his indignation, that he mis∣took
its object.—He wanted to quarrel
with Mr. Bramble; he said, he had been
dishonoured on his account, and he look∣ed
for reparation at his hands.—My un∣cle's
back was up in a moment; and he
desired him to explain his pretensions.—
“Either compel lord Oxmington to give
me satisfaction, (cried he) or give it me
in your own person.” “The latter
part of the alternative is the most easy
and expeditious (replied the 'squire,
starting up): if you are disposed for a
walk, I'll attend you this moment.”</P>
<P>Here they were interrupted by Mrs.
Tabby, who had overheard all that
passed.—She now burst into the room,
and running betwixt them, in great agi∣tation,
“Is this your regard for me, (said
she to the lieutenant) to seek the life of
my brother?” Lismahago, who seem∣ed
to grow cool as my uncle grew hot,
assured her he had a very great respect
for Mr. Bramble, but he had still more
for his own honour, which had suffered
pollution; but if that could be once pu∣rified,
he should have no further cause of
dissatisfaction.—The 'squire said, he
should have thought it incumbent upon
him to vindicate the lieutenant's honour;
<PB N="119" REF="119"/>
but, as he had now carved for himself, he
might swallow and digest it as well
as he could.—In a word, what
betwixt the mediation of Mrs. Tabitha,
the recollection of the captain, who per∣ceived
he had gone too far, and the re∣monstrances
of your humble servant, who
joined them at this juncture, those two
originals were perfectly reconciled; and
then we proceeded to deliberate upon the
means of taking vengeance for the insults
they had received from the petulant peer;
for, until that aim should be accomplish∣ed,
Mr. Bramble swore, with great em∣phasis,
that he would not leave the inn
where we now lodged, even if he should
pass his Christmas on the sport.</P>
<P>In consequence of our deliberations, we
next day, in the forenoon, proceeded in a
body to his lordship's house, all of us,
with our servants, including the coach∣man,
mounted a-horseback, with our
pistols loaded and ready primed.—Thus
prepared for action, we paraded solemnly
and slowly before his lordship's gate, which
we passed three times in such a manner, that
he could not but see us, and suspect the
cause of our appearance.—After dinner
we returned, and performed the same ca∣valcade,
which was again repeated the
<PB N="120" REF="120"/>
morning following; but we had no oc∣casion
to persist in these manoeuvres.—
About noon, we were visited by the gen∣tleman,
at whose house we had first seen
lord Oxmington.—He now came to make
apologies in the name of his lordship, who
declared he had no intention to give of∣fence
to my uncle, in practising what
had been always the custom of his house;
and that as for the indignities which had
been put upon the officer, they were of∣fered
without his lordship's knowledge,
at the instigation of his valet de chambre.
—“If that be the case, (said my uncle, in
a peremptory tone) I shall be contented
with lord Oxmington's personal ex∣cuses;
and I hope my friend will be
satisfied with his lordship's turning
that insolent rascal out of his service.”
—“Sir, (cried Lismahago) I must insist
upon taking personal vengeance for
the personal injuries I have sustained.”</P>
<P>After some debate, the affair was ad∣justed
in this manner.—His lordship,
meeting us at our friend's house, declar∣ed
he was sorry for what had happened;
and that he had no intention to give um∣brage.—
The valet de chambre asked par∣don
of the lieutenant upon his knees,
when Lismahago, to the astonishment of
<PB N="121" REF="121"/>
all present, gave him a violent kick on
the face, which laid him on his back, ex∣claiming
in a furious tone, “<HI>Oui je te
pardonne, gens foutre.</HI>”</P>
<P>Such was the fortunate issue of this pe∣rilous
and adventure, which threatened abun∣dance
of vexation to our family; for the
'squire is one of those who will sacrifice
both life and fortune, rather than leave
what they conceive to be the least spe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k
or blemish upon their honour and reputa∣tion.
His lordship had no sooner pro∣nounced
his apology, with a very bad
grace, than he went away in some disor∣der,
and, I dare say, he will never invite
another Welchman to his table.</P>
<P>We forthwith quitted the field of this
atchievement, in order to prosecute our
journey; but we follow no determi∣nate
course.—We make small devia∣tions,
to see the remarkable towns, villas,
and curiosities on each side of our route;
so that we advance by slow steps towards
the borders of Monmouthshire: but in
the midst of these irregular motions, there
is no abberration nor eccentricity in that
affection with which I am, dear Wat,</P>

<LETTER>
<PB N="122" REF="122"/>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>AT what time of life may a man think
himself exempted from the necessity of
sacrificing his repose to the puctilios of a
contemptible world? I have been engag∣ed
in a ridiculous adventure, which I shall
recount at meeting; and this, I hope,
will not be much longer delayed, as we
have now performed almost all our visits,
and seen every thing that I think has
any right to retard us in our journey
homewards—A few days ago, under∣standing
by accident, that my old friend
Baynard was in the country, I would not
pass so near his habitation without pay∣ing
him a visit, though our correspon∣dence
had been interrupted for a long
course of years.</P>
<P>I felt myself very sensibly affected by
the ideas of our past intimacy, as we ap∣proached
the place where we had spent so
many happy days together; but when we
<PB N="123" REF="123"/>
arrived at the house, I could not recog∣nize
any one of those objects, which had
been so deeply impressed upon my re∣membrance—
The tall oaks that shaded
the avenue, had been cut down, and the
iron gates at the end of it removed, toge∣ther
with the high wall that surrounded the
court yard. The house itself, which was
formerly a convent of Cistercian monks,
had a venerable appearance; and along
the front that looked into the garden, was
a stone gallery, which afforded me many
an agreeable walk, when I was disposed
to be contemplative—Now the old front
is covered with a screen of modern archi∣tecture;
so that all without is Grecian,
and all within Gothic—As for the garden,
which was well stocked with the best fruit
which England could produce, there is
not now the least vestage remaining of
trees, walls, or hedges—Nothing ap∣pears
but a naked circus of loose sand,
with a dry bason and a leaden triton in
the middle.</P>
<P>You must know, that Baynard, at his
father's death, had a clear estate of fifteen
hundred pounds a-year, and was in other
respects extremely well qualified to make
a respectable figure in the common∣wealth;
but, what with some excesses of
<PB N="124" REF="124"/>
youth, and the expence of a contested e∣lection,
he in a few years found himself
encumbered with a debt of ten thousand
pounds, which he resolved to discharge
by means of a prudent marriage—He ac∣cordingly
married a m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Thomson, whose
fortune amounted to double the sum that
he owed—She was the daughter of a ci∣tizen,
who had failed in trade; but her
fortune came by an uncle, who died in
the East-Indies—Her own parents being
dead, she lived with a maiden aunt, who
had superintended her education; and, in
all appearance, was well enough qualifi∣ed
for the usual purposes of the married
state—Her virtues, however, stood ra∣ther
upon a negative, than a positive foun∣dation—
She was neither proud, insolent,
nor capricious, nor given to scandal, nor
addicted to gaming, nor inclined to gal∣lantry—
She could read, and write, and
dance, and sing, and play upon the harp∣sichord,
and smatter French, and take a
hand at whist and ombre; but even these
accomplishments she possessed by halves
—She excelled in nothing. Her conver∣sation
was fla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, her stile mean, and her
expression embarrassed—In a word, her
character was totally insipid. Her per∣son
was not disagreeable; but there was
<PB N="125" REF="125"/>
nothing graceful in her address, nor en∣gaging
in her manners; and she was so
ill qualified to do the honours of the
house, that when she sat at the head of
the table, one was always looking for
the mistress of the family in some other
place.</P>
<P>Baynard had flattered himself, that it
would be no difficult matter to mould
such a subject after his own fashion, and
that she would chearfully enter into his
views, which were wholly turned to do∣mestic
happiness. He proposed to reside
always in the country, of which he was
fond to a degree of enthusiasm, to cul∣tivate
his estate, which was very improv∣able;
to enjoy the exercise of rural di∣versions;
to maintain an intimacy of cor∣respondence
with some friends that were
settled in his neighbourhood; to keep a
comfortable house, without suffering his
expence to exceed the limits of his in∣come;
and to find pleasure and employ∣ment
for his wife in the management and
avocations of her own family—This,
however, was a visionary scheme, which
he never was able to realize. His wife
was as ignorant as a new-born babe of
every thing that related to the conduct of
a family; and she had no idea of a coun∣try
<PB N="126" REF="126"/>
life—Her understanding did not reach
so far as to comprehend the first princi∣ples
of discretion; and, indeed, if her
capacity had been better than it was, her
natural indolence would not have permit∣ted
her to abandon a certain routine, to
which she had been habituated. She had
not taste enough to relish any rational en∣joyment;
but her ruling passion was va∣nity,
not that species which arises from
self-conceit of superior accomplishments,
but that which is of a bastard and idiot
nature, excited by shew and ostentation,
which implies not even the least consci∣ousness
of any personal merit.</P>
<P>The nuptial peal of noise and nonsense
being rung out in all the usual changes,
Mr. Baynard thought it high time to make
her acquainted with the particulars of the
plan which he had projected—He told
her that his fortune, though sufficient to
afford all the comforts of life, was not
ample enough to command all the super∣fluities
of pomp and pageantry, which,
indeed, were equally absurd and intolera∣ble—
He therefore hoped she would have
no objection to their leaving London in
the spring, when he would take the op∣portunity
to dismiss some unnecessary do∣mestics,
<PB N="127" REF="127"/>
whom he had hired for the occa∣sion
of their marriage—She heard him in
silence, and after some pause, “So, (said
she) I am to be buried in the country!”
He was so confounded at this reply, that
he could not speak for some minutes: at
length he told her, he was much morti∣fied
to find he had proposed any thing
that was disagreeable to her ideas—“I
am sure (added he) I meant nothing
more than to lay down a comfortable
plan of living within the bounds of our
fortune, which is but moderate.”
“Sir, (said she) you are the best judge
of your own affairs—My fortune, I
know, does not exceed twenty thou∣sand
pounds—Yet, even with that
pittance, I might have had a husband
who would not have begrudged me a
house in London—” “Good God!
my dear, (cried poor Baynard, in the
utmost agitation) you don't think me
so sordid—I only hinted what I thought
—But, I don't pretend to impose—”
“Yes, sir, (resumed the lady) it is
your prerogative to command, and my
duty to obey—”</P>
<P>So saying, she burst into tears and re∣tired
to her chamber, where she was join∣ed
by her aunt—He endeavoured to re∣collect
<PB N="128" REF="128"/>
himself, and act with vigour of
mind on this occasion; but was betray∣ed
by the tenderness of his nature, which
was the greatest defect of his constitution.
He found the aunt in tears, and the niece
in a fit, which held her the best part of
eight hours, at the expiration of which,
she began to talk incoherently about
<HI>death</HI> and her <HI>dear husband,</HI> who had sat
by her all this time, and now pressed her
hand to his lips, in a transport of grief
and penitence for the offence he had
given—From thence forward, he care∣fully
avoided mentioning the country;
and they continued to be sucked deeper
and deeper into the vortex of extrava∣gance
and dissipation, leading what is
called a fashionable life in town—About
the latter end of July, however, Mrs.
Baynard, in order to exhibit a proof of
conjugal obedience, desired of her own
accord, that they might pay a visit to his
country house, as there was no company
left in London. He would have excused
himself from this excursion, which was
no part of the oeconomical plan he had
proposed; but she insisted upon making
this sacrifice to his taste and prejudices,
and away they went with such an equi∣page
as astonished the whole country—
<PB N="129" REF="129"/>
All that remained of the season was en∣grossed
by receiving and returning visits
in the neighbourhood; and, in this in∣tercourse,
it was discovered that sir John
Chickwell had a house-steward and one
footman in livery more than the comple∣ment
of Mr. Baynard's household. This
remark was made by the aunt at table,
and assented to by the husband, who ob∣served
that sir John Chickwell might ve∣ry
well afford to keep more servants than
were found in the family of a man who
had not half his fortune. Mrs. Baynard
are no supper that evening; but was seiz∣ed
with a violent fit, which completed
her triumph over the spirit of her consort.
The two supernumerary servants were ad∣ded—
The family plate was sold for old
silver, and a new service procured; fa∣shionable
furniture was provided, and the
whole house turned topsy turvy.</P>
<P>At their return to London, in the be∣ginning
of winter, he, with a heavy heart,
communicated these particulars to me in
confidence. Before his marriage, he had
introduced me to the lady as his particu∣lar
friend; and I now offered in that cha∣racter,
to lay before her the necessity of
reforming her oeconomy, if she had any
regard to the interest of her own family,
<PB N="130" REF="130"/>
or complaisance for the inclinations of her
husband—But Baynard declined my of∣fer,
on the supposition that his wife's
nerves were too delicate to bear expostu∣lation;
and that it would only serve to
overwhelm her with such distress as would
make himself miserable.</P>
<P>Baynard is a man of spirit, and had she
proved a termagant, he would have
known how to deal with her; but, either
by accident or instinct, she fastened upon
the weak side of his soul, and held it so
fast, that he has been in subjection ever
since—I afterwards advised him to carry
her abroad to France or Italy, where he
might gratify her vanity for half the ex∣pence
it cost him in England; and this
advice he followed accordingly—She was
agreeably flattered with the idea of seeing
and knowing foreign parts, and foreign
fashions; of being presented to sove∣reigns,
and living familiarly with princes.
She forthwith seized the hint which I
had thrown out on purpose, and even
pressed Mr. Baynard to hasten his depar∣ture;
so that in a few weeks they crossed
the sea to France, with a moderate train,
still including the aunt; who was her
bosom counsellor, and abetted her in all
her opposition to her husband's will—
<PB N="131" REF="131"/>
Since that period, I have had little or no
opportunity to renew our former corre∣spondence—
All that I knew of his trans∣actions,
amounted to no more than that
after an absence of two years, they re∣turned
so little improved in oeconomy,
that they launched out into new oceans of
extravagance, which, at length, obliged
him to mortgage his estate—By this time
she had bore him three children, of which
the last only survives, a puny boy of
twelve or thirteen, who will be ruined in
his education by the indulgence of his
mother.</P>
<P>As for Baynard, neither his own good
sense, nor the dread of indigence, nor
the consideration of his children, has been
of force sufficient to stimulate him into
the resolution of breaking at once the
shameful spell by which he seems en∣chanted—
With a taste capable of the
most refined enjoyment, a heart glowing
with all the warmth of friendship and hu∣manity,
and a disposition strongly turned
to the more rational pleasures of a retired
and country life, he is hurried about in a
perpetual tumult, amidst a mob of beings
pleased with rattles, baubles, and gew∣gaws,
so void of sense and distinction,
that even the most acute philosophy would
<PB N="132" REF="132"/>
find it a very hard task to discover for
what wise purpose of providence they
were created—Friendship is not to be
found; nor can the amusements for which
he sighs be enjoyed within the rotation of
absurdity, to which he is doomed for life.
He has long resigned all views of improv∣ing
his fortune by management and atten∣tion
to the exercise of husbandry, in
which he delighted; and as to domestic
happiness, not the least glimpse of hope
remains to amuse his imagination. Thus
blasted in all his prospects, he could not
fail to be overwhelmed with melancholy
and chagrin, which have preyed upon
his health and spirits in such a manner,
that he is now threatened with a con∣sumption.</P>
<P>I have given you a sketch of the man,
whom the other day I went to visit—At
the gate we found a great number of pow∣dered
lacquies, but no civility—After we
had sat a considerable time in the coach,
we were told, that Mr. Baynard had rode
out, and that his lady was dressing; but
we were introduced to a parlour, so very
fine and delicate, that in all appearance it
was designed to be seen only, not inha∣bited.
The chairs and couches were
carved, gilt, and covered with rich da∣mask,
<PB N="133" REF="133"/>
so smooth and slick, that they
looked as if they had never been sat upon.
There was no carpet on the floor; but
the boards were rubbed and waxed in such
a manner, that we could not walk, but
were obliged to slide along them; and as
for the stove, it was too bright and po∣lished
to be polluted with sea coal, or
stained by the smoke of any gross mate∣rial
fire—When we had remained above
half an hour sacrificing to the inhospita∣ble
powers in this <HI>temple of cold reception,</HI>
my friend Baynard arrived, and under∣standing
we were in the house, made his
appearance, so meagre, yellow, and de∣jected,
that I really should not have
known him, had I met with him in any
other place—Running up to me, with
great eagerness, he strained me in his em∣brace,
and his heart was so full, that for
some minutes he could not speak—Hav∣ing
saluted us all round, he perceived our
uncomfortable situation, and conducting
us into another apartment, which had fire
in the chimney, called for chocolate—
Then, withdrawing, he returned with a
compliment from his wife, and, in the
mean time, presented his son Harry, a
shambling, blear-eyed boy, in the habit
of a hussar; very rude, forward, and im∣pertinent—
<PB N="134" REF="134"/>
His father would have sent
him to a boarding-school, but his mam∣ma
and aunt would not hear of his lying
out of the house; so that there was a cler∣gyman
engaged as his tutor in the fa∣mily.</P>
<P>As it was but just turned of twelve,
and the whole house was in commotion to
prepare a formal entertainment, I fore∣saw
it would be late before we dined, and
proposed a walk to Mr. Baynard, that
we might converse together freely. In
the course of this perambulation, when I
expressed some surprise that he had re∣turned
so soon from Italy, he gave me to
understand, that his going abroad had no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at all answered the purpose, for which he
left England; that although the expence
of living was not so great in Italy as at
home, respect being had to the same rank
of life in both countries, it had been
found necessary for him to lift himself a∣bove
his usual stile, that he might be on
some footing with the counts, marquises,
and cavalieres, with whom he kept com∣pany—
He was obliged to hire a great
number of servants, to take off a great
variety of rich cloaths, and to keep a
sumptuous table for the fashionable scoroc∣coni
of the country; who, without a con∣sideration
<PB N="135" REF="135"/>
of this kind, would not have
payed any attention to an untitled fo∣reigner,
let his family or fortune be ever
so respectable—Besides, Mrs. Baynard was
continually surrounded by a train of ex∣pensive
loungers, under the denominations
of language-masters, musicians, painters,
and ciceroni; and had actually fallen in∣to
the disease of buying pictures and an∣tiques
upon her own judgment, which was
far from being infallible—At length she
met with an affront, which gave her a
disgust to Italy, and drove her back to
England with some precipitation. By
means of frequenting the dutchess of
B—'s conversazione, while her grace
was at Rome, Mrs. Baynard became ac∣quainted
with all the fashionable people
of that city, and was admitted to their as∣semblies
without scruple—Thus favour∣ed,
she conceived too great an idea of
her own importance, and when the du∣chess
left Rome, resolved to have a con∣versazione
that should leave the Ro∣mans
no room to regret her grace's de∣parture.
She provided hands for a mu∣sical
entertainment, and sent bighetti of
invitation to every person of distinction;
but not one Roman of the female sex ap∣peared
at her assembly—She was that night
<PB N="136" REF="136"/>
seized with a violent fit, and kept her bed
three days, at the expiration of which she
declared that the air of Italy would be
the ruin of her constitution. In order to
prevent this catastrophe, she was speedily
removed to Geneva, from whence they
returned to England by the way of Lyons
and Paris. By the time they arrived at
Calais, she had purchased such a quanti∣ty
of silks, stuffs, and laces, that it was
necessary to hire a vessel to smuggle them
over, and this vessel was taken by a cus∣tom-house
cutter; so that they lost the
whole cargo, which had cost them above
eight hundred pounds.</P>
<P>It now appeared, that her travels had
produced no effect upon her, but that of
making her more expensive and fantastic
than ever:—She affected to lead the fashion,
not only in point of female dress, but in eve∣ry
article of taste and connoisseurship. She
made a drawing of the new façade to the
house in the country; she pulled up the
trees, and pulled down the walls of the
garden, so as to let in the easterly wind,
which Mr. Baynard's ancestors had been
at great pains to exclude. To shew her
taste in laying out ground, she seized into
her own hand a farm of two hundred
acres, about a mile from the house, which
<PB N="137" REF="137"/>
she parcelled out into walks and shrub∣beries,
having a great bason in the middle,
into which she poured a whole stream that
turned two mills, and afforded the best
trout in the country. The bottom of the
bason, however, was so ill secured, that it
would not hold the water which strained
through the earth, and made a bog of the
whole plantation: in a word, the ground
which formerly payed him one hundred
and fifty pounds a year, now cost him
two hundred pounds a year to keep it
in tolerable order, over and above the first
expence of trees, shrubs, flowers, turf,
and gravel. There was not an inch of
garden ground left about the house, nor
a tree that produced fruit of any kind;
nor did he raise a truss of hay, or a bushel
of oats for his horses, nor had he a single
cow to afford milk for his tea; far less did
he ever dream of feeding his own mutton,
pigs, and poultry: every article of house∣keeping,
even the most inconsiderable,
was brought from the next market town,
at the distance of five miles, and thither
they sent a courier every morning to fetch
hot rolls for breakfast. In short, Baynard
fairly owned that he spent double his
income, and that in a few years he should
be obliged to sell his estate for the pay∣ment
<PB N="138" REF="138"/>
of his creditors. He said his wife
had such delicate nerves, and such imbe∣cillity
of spirit, that she could neither
bear remonstrance, be it ever so gentle,
nor practise any scheme of retrenchment,
even if she perceived the necessity of such
a measure. He had therefore ceased
struggling against the stream, and endea∣voured
to reconcile himself to ruin, by
reflecting that his child at least, would
inherit his mother's fortune, which was se∣cured
to him by the contract of marriage.</P>
<P>The detail which he gave me of his
affairs, filled me at once with grief and
indignation. I inveighed bitterly against
the indiscretion of his wife, and reproach∣ed
him with his unmanly acquiescence un∣der
the absurd tyranny which she exerted.
I exhorted him to recollect his resolution,
and make one effectual effort to disengage
himself from a thraldom, equally shame∣ful
and pernicious. I offered him all the
assistance in my power. I undertook to
regulate his affairs, and even to bring
about a reformation in his family, if he
would only authorise me to execute the
plan I should form for his advantage. I
was so affected by the subject, that I could
not help mingling tears with my remon∣strances,
and Baynard was so penetrated
<PB N="139" REF="139"/>
with these marks of my affection, that he
lost all power of utterance. He pressed
me to his breast with great emotion, and
wept in silence. At length he exclaimed,
“Friendship is undoubtedly the most
precious balm of life! Your words,
dear Bramble, have in a great measure
recalled me from an abyss of despon∣dence,
in which I have been long over∣whelmed—
I will, upon honour, make
you acquainted with a distinct state of
my affairs, and, as far as I am able to
go, will follow the course you prescribe.
But there are certain lengths which my
nature—The truth is, there are ten∣der
connexions, of which a bachelor
has no idea—Shall I own my weakness?
I cannot bear the thoughts of making
that woman uneasy—” “And yet,
(cried I) she has seen you unhappy for
a series of years—unhappy from her
misconduct, without ever shewing the
least inclination to alleviate your dis∣tress—”
“Nevertheless (said he) I am
persuaded she loves me with the most
warm affection; but these are incon∣gruities
in the composition of the hu∣man
mind which I hold to be inexpli∣cable.”</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="140"/>
I was shocked at his infatuation, and
changed the subject, after we had agreed
to maintain a close correspondence for the
future—He then gave me to understand,
that he had two neighbours, who, like
himself, were driven by their wives at full
speed, in the high road to bankruptcy
and ruin. All the three husbands were
of dispositions very different from each
other, and, according to this variation,
their consorts were admirably suited to
the purpose of keeping them all three in
subjection. The views of the ladies were
exactly the same. They vied in grandeur,
that is, in ostentation, with the wife of Sir
Charles Chickwell, who had four times
their fortune; and she again piqued her∣self
upon making an equal figure with a
neighbouring peeress, whose revenue tre∣bled
her own. Here then was the fable of
the frog and the ox, realized in four diffe∣rent
instances within the same county: one
large fortune, and three moderate estates,
in a fair way of being burst by the infla∣tion
of female vanity; and in three of
these instances, three different forms of
female tyranny were exercised. Mr. Bay∣nard
was subjugated by practising upon
the tenderness of his nature. Mr. Milk∣san,
being of a timorous disposition,
<PB N="141" REF="141"/>
truckled to the insolence of a termagant.
Mr. Sowerby, who was of a temper nei∣ther
to be moved by fits, nor driven by
menaces, had the fortune to be fitted with
a help<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, who assailed him with the
weapons of irony and satire; sometimes
snee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in the way of compliment; some∣times
throwing out sarcastic comparisons,
implying reproaches upon his want of
taste, spirit, and generosity: by which
means she stimulated his passions from one
act of extravagance to another, just as the
circumstances of her vanity required.</P>
<P>All these three ladies have at this time
the same number of horses, carriages, and
servants in and out of livery; the same
variety of dress; the same quantity of
plate and china; the like ornaments in
furniture; and in their entertainments
they endeavour to exceed one another in
the variety, delicacy, and expence of their
dishes. I believe it will be found upon
enquiry, that nineteen out of twenty, who
are ruined by extravagance, fall a sacrifice
to the ridiculous pride and vanity of silly
women, whose parts are held in contempt
by the very men whom they pillage and
enslave. Thank heaven, Dick, that among
all the follies and weaknesses of human
<PB N="142" REF="142"/>
nature, I have not yet fallen into that of
matrimony.</P>
<P>After Baynard and I had discussed all
these matters at leisure, we returned to∣wards
the house, and met Jery with our
two women, who had come forth to take
the air, as the lady of the mansion had
not yet made her appearance. In short,
Mrs. Baynard did not produce herself, till
about a quarter of an hour before dinner
was upon the table. Then her husband
brought her into the parlour, accompa∣nied
by her aunt and son, and she receiv∣ed
us with a coldness of reserve sufficient
to freeze the very soul of hospitality.
Though she knew I had been the intimate
friend of her husband, and had often seen
me with him in London, she shewed no
marks of recognition or regard, when I
addressed myself to her in the most friend∣ly
terms of salutation. She did not even
express the common complement of, <HI>I am
glad to see you;</HI> or, <HI>I hope you have enjoyed
your health since we had the pleasure of see∣ing
you;</HI> or some such words of course:
nor did she once open her mouth in the
way of welcome to my sister and my niece:
but sat in silence like a statue, with an
aspect of insensibility. Her aunt, the
model upon which she had been formed,
<PB N="143" REF="143"/>
was indeed the very essence of insipid for∣mality:
but the boy was very pert and
impudent, and prated without ceasing.</P>
<P>At dinner, the lady maintained the
same ungracious indifference, never speak∣ing
but in whispers to her aunt; and as
to the repast, it was made up of a parcel
of kickshaws, contrived by a French
cook, without one substantial article
adapted to the satisfaction of an English
appetite. The pottage was little better
than bread soaked in dishwashings, luke∣warm.
The ragouts looked as if they
had been once eaten and half digested:
the fricassees were involved in a nasty yel∣low
poultice; and the rotis were scorched
and stinking, for the honour of the fu∣met.
The desert consisted of faded fruit
and iced froth, a good emblem of our land∣lady's
character; the table-beer was sour,
the water foul, and the wine vapid; but
there was a parade of plate and china, and
a powdered lacquey stood behind every
chair, except those of the master and
mistress of the house, who were served by
two valets dressed like gentlemen. We
dined in a large old Gothic parlour, which
was formerly the hall. It was now paved
with marble, and, notwithstanding the
fire, which had been kindled about an
<PB N="144" REF="144"/>
hour, struck me with such a chill sensa∣tion,
that when I entered it the teeth
chattered in my jaws—In short, every
thing was cold, comfortless, and disgust∣ing,
except the looks of my friend Bay∣nard,
which declared the warmth of his
affection and humanity.</P>
<P>After dinner we withdrew into another
apartment, where the boy began to be
impertinently troublesome to my niece
Liddy. He wanted a play-fellow, for∣sooth;
and would have romped with her,
had she encouraged his advances—He was
even so impudent as to snatch a kiss, at
which she changed countenance, and
seemed uneasy; and though his father
checked him for the rudeness of his be∣haviour,
he became so outrageous as to
thrust his hand in her bosom: an insult to
which she did not tamely submit, though
one of the mildest creatures upon earth.
Her eyes sparkling with resentment, she
started up, and lent him such a box in
the ear, as sent him staggering to the other
side of the room.</P>
<P>“Miss Melford, (cried his father) you
have treated him with the utmost
propriety—I am only sorry that the
impertinence of any child of mine
should have occasioned this exertion of
<PB N="145" REF="145"/>
your spirit, which I cannot but applaud
and admire.” His wife was so far
from assenting to the candour of his apo∣logy,
that she rose from table, and, taking
her son by the hand, “Come, child,
(said she) your father cannot abide
you.” So saying, she retired with this
hopeful youth, and was followed by her
gouvernante: but neither the one nor the
other deigned to take the least notice of
the company.</P>
<P>Baynard was exceedingly disconcerted;
but I perceived his uneasiness was tinctur∣ed
with resentment, and derived a good
omen from this discovery. I ordered the
horses to be put to the carriage, and,
though he made some efforts to detain us
all night, I insisted upon leaving the house
immediately; but, before I went away, I
took an opportunity of speaking to him
again in private. I said every thing I could
recollect, to animate his endeavours in
shaking off those shameful trammels. I
made no scruple to declare, that his wife
was unworthy of that tender complaisance
which he had shewn for her foibles: that
she was dead to all the genuine sentiments
of conjugal affection; insensible of her
own honour and interest, and seemingly
destitute of common sense and reflection.
<PB N="146" REF="146"/>
I conjured him to remember what he
owed to his father's house, to his own re∣putation,
and to his family, including even
this unreasonable woman herself, who was
driving on blindly to her own destruction.
I advised him to form a plan for retrench∣ing
superfluous expence, and try to con∣vince
the aunt of the necessity for such a
reformation, that she might gradually pre∣pare
her niece for its execution; and I
exhorted him to turn that disagreeable
piece of formality out of the house, if he
should find her averse to his proposal.</P>
<P>Here he interrupted me with a sigh, ob∣serving
that such a step would undoubted∣ly
be fatal to Mrs. Baynard—“I shall
lose all patience, (cried I), to hear you
talk so weakly—Mrs. Baynard's fits
will never hurt her constitution. I
believe in my conscience they are all
affected: I am sure she has no feeling
for your distresses; and, when you are
ruined, she will appear to have no feel∣ing
for her own.” Finally, I took his
word and honour, that he would make an
effort, such as I had advised; that he
would form a plan of oeconomy, and, if
he found it impracticable without my as∣sistance,
he would come to Bath in the
winter, where I promised to give him the
<PB N="147" REF="147"/>
meeting, and contribute all in my power
to the retrieval of his affairs—With this
mutual engagement we parted; and I shall
think myself supremely happy, if, by my
means, a worthy man, whom I love and
esteem, can be saved from misery, disgrace,
and despair.</P>
<P>I have only one friend more to visit in
this part of the country, but he is of a
complexion very different from that of
Baynard. You have heard me mention
Sir Thomas Bullford, whom I knew in Ita∣ly.
He is now become a country gentle∣man;
but, being disabled by the gout
from enjoying any amusement abroad, he
entertains himself within doors, by keep∣ing
open house for all comers, and play∣ing
upon the oddities and humours of his
company: but he himself is generally the
greatest original at his table. He is very
good-humoured, talks much, and laughs
without ceasing. I am told that all the
use he makes of his understanding at pre∣sent,
is to excite mirth, by exhibiting his
guests in ludicrous attitudes. I know not
how far we may furnish him with enter∣tainment
of this kind, but I am resolv∣ed
to beat up his quarters, partly with a
view to laugh with the knight himself,
and partly to pay my respects to his lady,
<PB N="148" REF="148"/>
a good-natured sensible woman, with whom
he lives upon very easy terms, although she
has not had the good fortune to bring him
an heir to his estate.</P>
<P>And now, dear Dick, I must tell you
for your comfort, that you are the only
man upon earth to whom I would pre∣sume
to send such a long-winded epistle,
which I could not find in my heart to cur∣tail,
because the subject interested the
warmest passions of my heart; neither
will I make any other apology to a cor∣respondent
who has been so long accus∣tomed
to the impertinence of</P>

<LETTER>
<PB N="149" REF="149"/>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. at
Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE, there is something mis∣chievious
in my disposition, for nothing
diverts me so much as to see certain cha∣racters
tormented with false terrors.—
We last night lodged at the house of sir
Thomas Bullford, an old friend of my
uncle, a jolly fellow, of moderate intel∣lects,
who, in spite of the gout, which
hath lamed him, is resolved to be merry
to the last; and mirth he has a particular
knack in extracting from his guests, let
their humour be never so caustic or refrac∣tory.—
Besides our company, there was in
the house a fat-headed justice of the peace,
called Frogmore, and a country prac∣titioner
in surgery, who seemed to be our
landlord's chief companion and confi∣dant.—
We found the knight sitting on a
couch, with his crutches by his side, and
his feet supported on cushions; but he
<PB N="150" REF="150"/>
received us with a hearty welcome, and
seemed greatly rejoiced at our arrival.—
After tea, we were entertained with a so∣nata
on the harpsichord by lady Bullford,
who sung and played to admiration; but
sir Thomas seemed to be a little asinine
in the article of ears, though he affected
to be in raptures, and begged his wife to
favour us with an <HI>arietta</HI> of her own com∣posing.—
This <HI>ari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tta,</HI> however, she no
sooner began to perform, than he and
the justice fell asleep; but the mo∣ment
she ceased playing, the knight
waked snorting, and exclaimed, “<HI>O
cara!</HI> what d'ye think, gentlemen?
Will you talk any more of your Pargo∣lesi
and your Corelli?”—At the same
time, he thrust his tongue in one cheek,
and leered with one eye at the doctor and
me, who sat on his left hand.—He con∣cluded
the pantomime with a loud laugh,
which he could command at all times ex∣tempore.—
Notwithstanding his disorder,
he did not do penance at supper, nor did
he ever refuse his glass when the toast
went round, but rather encouraged a
quick circulation, both by precept and
example.</P>
<P>I soon perceived the doctor had made
himself very necessary to the baronet.—
<PB N="151" REF="151"/>
He was the whetstone of his wit, the butt
of his satire, and his operator in certain
experiments of humour, which were oc∣casionally
tried upon strangers.—Justice
Frogmore was an excellent subject for this
species of philosophy; sleek and corpu∣lent,
solemn and shallow, he had studied
Burn with uncommon application, but
he studied nothing so much as the art of
living (that is, eating) well.—This fat
buck had often afforded good sport to our
landlord; and he was frequently started
with tolerable success, in the course of
this evening; but the baronet's appetite
for ridicule seemed to be chiefly excited
by the appearance, address, and conver∣sation
of Lismahago, whom he attempted
in all the different modes of exposition;
but he put me in mind of a contest that
I once saw betwixt a young hound and an
old hedge-hog—The dog turned him over
and over, and bounced, and barked, and
mumbled; but as often as he attempted
to bite, he felt a prickle in his jaws, and
recoiled in manifest confusion:—The
captain, when left to himself, will not
fail to turn his ludicrous side to the com∣pany,
but if any man attempts to force
him into that attitude, he becomes stub∣born
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
as a mule, and unmanageable as an
elephant unbroke.</P>
<P>Divers tolerable jokes were cracked
upon the justice, who ate a most uncon∣scionable
supper, and, among other
things, a large plate of broiled mush∣rooms,
which he had no sooner swallowed
than the doctor observed, with great gra∣vity,
that they were of the kind called
<HI>champignons,</HI> which in some constitutions
had a poisonous effect.—Mr. Frogmore,
startled at this remark, asked, in some
confusion, why he had not been so kind
as to give him that notice sooner.—He
answered, that he took it for granted, by
his eating them so heartily, that he was
used to the dish; but as he seemed to be
under some apprehension, he prescribed
a bumper of plague water, which the
justice drank off immediately, and retired
to rest, not without marks of terror
and disquiet.</P>
<P>At midnight we were shewn to our
different chambers, and in half an hour,
I was fast asleep in bed; but about three
o'clock in the morning I was waked with
a dismal cry of <HI>Fire!</HI> and starting up, ran
to the window in my shirt.—The night
was dark and stormy; and a number of
<PB N="153" REF="153"/>
people half-dressed ran backwards and
forwards thro' the court-yard, with links
and lanthorns, seemingly in the utmost
hurry and trepidation.—Slipping on my
cloaths in a twinkling, I ran down stairs,
and, upon inquiry, found the fire was
confined to a back-stair, which led to a
detached apartment where Lismahago
lay.—By this time, the lieutenant was
alarmed by bawling at his window, which
was in the second story, but he could not
find his cloaths in the dark, and his room∣door
was locked on the outside.—The
servants called to him, that the house had
been robbed; that, without all doubt,
the villains had taken away his cloaths,
fastened the door, and set the house on
fire, for the stair-case was in flames.—In
this dilemma the poor lieutenant ran about
the room naked like a squirrel in a cage,
popping out his head at the window be∣tween
whiles, and imploring assistance.—
At length, the knight in person was
brought out in his chair, attended by my
uncle and all the family, including our
aunt Tabitha, who screamed, and cried,
and tore her hair, as if she had been dis∣tracted.—
Sir Thomas had already ordered
his people to bring a long ladder, which
was applied to the captain's window, and
<PB N="154" REF="154"/>
now he exorted him earnestly to descend.
—There was no need of much rhetoric
to persuade Lismahago, who forthwith
made his exit by the window, roaring all
the time to the people below to hold fast
the ladder.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the gravity of the
occasion, it was impossible to behold this
scene without being seized with an incli∣nation
to laugh. The rueful aspect of
the lieutenant in his shirt, with a quilted
night-cap fastened under his chin, and
his long lank limbs and posteriors ex∣posed
to the wind, made a very pic∣turesque
appearance, when illumined by
the links and torches which the servants
held up to light him in his descent.—All
the company stood round the ladder, ex∣cept
the knight, who sat in his chair, ex∣claiming
from time to time, “Lord have
mercy upon us!—save the gentleman's
life!—mind your footing, dear cap∣tain!
—softly!—stand fast!—clasp the
ladder with both hands!—there!—
well done, my dear boy!—O bravo!—
an old soldier for ever!—bring a blan∣ket—
bring a warm blanket to com∣fort
his poor carcase—warm the bed
in the green room—give me your
hand, dear captain—I'm rejoiced to see
thee safe and sound with all my heart.”
<PB N="155" REF="155"/>
Lismahago was received at the foot of
the ladder by his innamorata, who snatch∣ing
a blanket from one of the maids,
wrapped it about his body; two men-ser∣vants
took him under the arms, and a
female conducted him to the green room,
still accompanied by Mrs. Tabitha, who
saw him fairly put to bed.—During this
whole transaction, he spoke not a syllable,
but looked exceeding grim, sometimes at
one, sometimes at another of the specta∣tors,
who now adjourned in a body to the
parlour where we had supped, every
one surveying another with marks of
astonishment and curiosity.</P>
<P>The knight being seated in an easy
chair, seized my uncle by the hand, and
bursting into a long and loud laugh,
“Matt, (cried he) crown me with oak, or
ivy, or laurel, or parsley, or what you
will, and acknowledge this to be a <HI>coup
de maitre</HI> in the way of waggery—ha,
ha, ha!—Such a <HI>camisicata, scagliata,
beffata!—O, che roba!</HI>—O, what a
subject!—O, what <HI>caricatura!</HI>—O,
for a Rosa, a Rembrandt, a Schalken!
—Zooks, I'll give a hundred guineas
to have it painted!—what a fine de∣scent
from the cross, or ascent to the
gallows!—what lights and shadows!—
what a groupe below!—what expression
<PB N="156" REF="156"/>
above!—what an aspect!—did you
mind the aspect?—ha, ha, ha!—and
the limbs, and the muscles—every
toe denoted terror!—ha, ha, ha!—
then the blanket!—O, what <HI>costume?</HI>
St. Andrew! St. Lazarus! St. Barra∣bas!
—ha, ha, ha!” “After all then,
(cried Mr. Bramble very gravely) this
was no more than a false alarm.—We
have been frightened out of our beds,
and almost out of our senses, for the
joke's sake.” “Ay, and such a joke!
(cried our landlord) such a farce! such
a <HI>denouement!</HI> such a <HI>catastrophe!</HI>”</P>
<P>“Have a little patience (replied our
'squire); we are not yet come to the
<HI>catastrophe;</HI> and pray God it may not
turn out a tragedy instead of a farce.
—The captain is one of those satur∣nine
subjects, who have no idea of hu∣mour.—
He never laughs in his own
person; nor can he bear that other
people should laugh at his expence.—
Besides, if the subject had been properly
chosen, the joke was too severe in all
conscience.” “'Sdeath! (cried the
knight) I could not have bated him an
ace had he been may own father; and
as for the subject, such another does
not present itself once in half a centu∣ry.”
Here Mrs. Tabitha interposing,
<PB N="157" REF="157"/>
and bridling up, declared, she did not
see that Mr. Lismahago was a fitter
subject for ridicule than the knight him∣self;
and that she was very much afraid,
he would very soon find he had mistaken
his man.—The baronet was a good
deal disconcerted by this intimation, say∣ing,
that he must be a Goth and a barba∣rian,
if he did not enter into the spirit of
such a happy and humorous contrivance.
—He begged, however, that Mr. Bram∣ble
and his sister would bring him to rea∣son;
and this request was reinforced by
lady Bullford, who did not fail to read
the baronet a lecture upon his indiscretion,
which lecture he received with submission
on one side of his face, and a leer upon
the other.</P>
<P>We now went to bed for the second
time; and before I got up, my uncle had
visited Lismahago in the green room, and
used such arguments with him, that when
we met in the parlour he seemed to be
quite appeased.—He received the knight's
apology with a good grace, and even pro∣fessed
himself pleased at finding he had
contributed to the diversion of the com∣pany.—
Sir Thomas shook him by the
hand, laughing heartily; and then desired
a pinch of snuff, in token of perfect re∣conciliation—
<PB N="158" REF="158"/>
The lieutenant, putting his
hand in his waistcoat pocket, pulled out,
instead of his own Scotch mull, a very
fine gold snuff box, which he no sooner
perceived than he said, “Here is a small
mistake.” “No mistake at all (cried
the baronet): a fair exchange is no
robbery.—Oblige me so far, captain,
as to let me keep your mull as a
memorial.” “Sir, (said the lieute∣nant)
the mull is much at your service;
but this machine I can by no means
retain.—It looks like compounding a
sort of felony in the code of honour.—
Besides, I don't know but there may
be another joke in this conveyance;
and I don't find myself disposed to be
brought upon the stage again.—I
won't presume to make free with your
pockets, but I beg you will put it up
again with your own hand.”—So
saying, with a certain austerity of as∣pect,
he presented the snuff-box to the
knight, who received it in some confu∣sion,
and restored the mull, which he
would by no means keep, except on the
terms of exchange.</P>
<P>This transaction was like to give a
grave cast to the conversation, when my
uncle took notice that Mr. Justice Frog∣more
<PB N="159" REF="159"/>
had not made his appearance either
at the night-alarm, or now at the general
rendezvous. The baronet hearing Frog∣more
mentioned, “Odso! (cried he) I
had forgot the justice.—Pr'ythee, doc∣tor,
go and bring him out of his ken∣nel.”
—Then laughing till his sides were
well shaken, he said he would shew the
captain▪ that he was not the only person
of the drama exhibited for the entertain∣ment
of the company. As to the night∣scene,
it could not affect the justice, who
had been purposely lodged in the farther
end of the house, remote from the noise,
and lulled with a dose of opium into the
bargain. In a few minutes, Mr. Justice
was led into the parlour in his night-cap
and loose morning gown, rolling his head
from side to side, and groaning piteously all
the way.—“Jesu! neighbour Frogmore,
(exclaimed the baronet) what is the
matter?—you look as if you was not a
man for this world.—Set him down
softly on the couch—poor gentle∣man!
—Lord have mercy upon us!—
What makes him so pale, and yellow,
and bloated?” “Oh, sir Thomas!
(cried the justice) I doubt 'tis all over
with me—Those mushrooms I eat at
your table have done my business—
<PB N="160" REF="160"/>
ah! oh! hey!” “Now the Lord
forbid! (said the other)—what! man,
have a good heart.—How does thy sto∣mach
feel?—hah?”</P>
<P>To this interrogation he made no re∣ply,
but throwing aside his night gown,
discovered that his waistcoat would not
meet upon his belly by five good inches at
least. “Heaven protect us all! (cried sir
Thomas)—what a melancholy specta∣cle!
—never did I see a man so sudden∣ly
swelled, but when he was either just
dead, or just dying.—Doctor, can'st
thou do nothing for this poor object?”
“I don't think the case is quite desperate
(said the surgeon), but I would advise
Mr. Frogmore to settle his affairs with
all expedition; the parson may come
and pray by him, while I prepare a
glyster and an emetic draught.” The
justice, rolling his languid eyes, ejaculated
with great fervency, “Lord, have mercy
upon us! Christ, have mercy upon
us!”—Then he begged the sur∣geon,
in the name of God, to dispatch—
As for my worldly affairs, (said he)
they are all settled but one mortgage,
which must be left to my heirs—but
my poor soul! my poor soul! what
will become of my poor soul?—miser∣able
<PB N="161" REF="161"/>
sinner that I am!” “Nay,
pr'ythee, my dear boy, compose thy∣self
(resumed the knight); consider the
mercy of heaven is infinite; thou can'st
not have any sins of a very deep dye
on thy conscience, or the devil's in't.”
“Name not the devil (exclaimed the ter∣rified
Frogmore), I have more sins to
answer for than the world dreams of.—
Ah! friend, I have been sly—sly—
damn'd sly!—Send for the parson
without loss of time, and put me to
bed, for I am posting to eternity.”—
He was accordingly raised from the couch,
and supported by two servants, who led
him back to his room; but before he
quitted the parlour, he intreated the good
company to assist him with their prayers.
—He added, “Take warning by me, who
am suddenly cut off in my prime, like
a flower of the field; and God forgive
you, sir Thomas, for suffering such
poisonous trash to be eaten at your
table.”</P>
<P>He was no sooner removed out of hear∣ing,
than the baronet abandoned himself
to a violent fit of laughing, in which he
was joined by the greatest part of the
company; but we could hardly prevent
<PB N="162" REF="162"/>
the good lady from going to undeceive
the patient, by discovering, that while he
slept his waistcoat had been straitened by
the contrivance of the surgeon; and that
the disorder in his stomach and bowels
was occasioned by some antimonial wine,
which he had taken over night, under the
denomination of plague-water.—She
seemed to think that his apprehension
might put an end to his life: the knight
swore he was no such chicken, but a
tough old rogue, that would live long
enough to plague all his neighbours.—
Upon enquiry, we found his character did
not intitle him to much compassion or re∣spect,
and therefore we let our landlord's
humour take its course.—A glyster was
actually administered by an old woman of
the family, who had been sir Thomas's
nurse, and the patient took a draught
made with oxymel of squills to forward
the operation of the antimonial wine,
which had been retarded by the opiate of
the preceding night. He was visited by
the vicar, who read prayers, and began to
take an account of the state of his soul,
when those medicines produced their ef∣fect;
so that the parson was obliged to
hold his nose while he poured forth spi∣ritual
<PB N="163" REF="163"/>
consolation from his mouth. The
same expedient was used by the knight
and me, who, with the doctor, entered
the chamber at this juncture, and found
Frogmore enthroned on an easing-chair,
under the pressure of a double evacuation.
The short intervals betwixt every heave
he employed in crying for mercy, confes∣sing
his sins, or asking the vicar's opinion
of his case; and the vicar answered, in a
solemn snuffling tone, that heightened the
ridicule of the scene. The emetic having
done its office, the doctor interfered, and
ordered the patient to be put in bed again.
When he examined the <HI>egista,</HI> and felt his
pulse, he declared that much of the <HI>virus</HI>
was discharged, and, giving him a compo∣sing
draught, assured him he had good
hopes of his recovery.—This welcome
hint he received with the tears of joy in his
eyes, protesting, that if he should recover,
he would always think himself indebted
for his life to the great skill and ten∣derness
of his doctor, whose hand he
squeezed with great fervor; and thus he
was left to his repose.</P>
<P>We were pressed to stay dinner, that
we might be witnesses of his resuscita∣tion;
but my uncle insisted upon our
<PB N="164" REF="164"/>
departing before noon, that we might
reach this town before it should be dark.
—In the mean time, lady Bullford con∣ducted
us into the garden to see a fish∣pond
just finished, which Mr. Bramble
censured as being too near the parlour,
where the knight now sat by himself,
dozing in an elbow-chair after the fa∣tigues
of his morning atchievement.—
In this situation he reclined, with his
feet wrapped in f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annel, and supported
in a line with his body, when the door
flying open with a violent shock, lieu∣tenant
Lismahago rushed into the room
with horror in his looks, exclaiming,
“A mad dog! a mad dog!” and
throwing up the window sash, leaped
into the garden.—Sir Thomas, waked by
this tremendous exclamation, started up,
and forgetting his gout, followed the
lieutenant's example by a kind of instinc∣tive
impulse.—He not only bolted thro'
the window like an arrow from a bow,
but ran up to his middle in the pond be∣fore
he gave the least sign of recollection.
Then the captain began to bawl, “Lord,
have mercy upon us!—pray, take care
of the gentleman!—for God's sake,
mind your footing, my dear boy!—
<PB N="165" REF="165"/>
get warm blankets—comfort his poor
carcase—warm the bed in the green
room.”</P>
<P>Lady Bullford was thunder struck at
this phaenomenon, and the rest of the
company gazed in silent astonishment,
while the servants hastened to assist their
master, who suffered himself to be carried
back into the parlour without speaking a
word.—Being instantly accommodated
with dry clothes and flannels, comforted
with a cordial, and replaced <HI>in statu quo,</HI>
one of the maids was ordered to chafe his
lower extremities, an operation in con∣sequence
of which his senses seemed to re∣turn
and his good humour to revive.—
As we had followed him into the room,
he looked at every individual in his turn,
with a certain ludicrous expression in his
countenance, but fixed his eye in parti∣cular
upon Lismahago, who presented
him with a pinch of snuff, and when he
took it in silence, “Sir Thomas Bullford,
(said he) I am much obliged to you
for all your favours, and some of them
I have endeavoured to repay in your
own coin” “Give me thy hand
(cried the baronet); thou hast indeed
payed me <HI>Scot and lot;</HI> and even left a
<PB N="166" REF="166"/>
balance in my hands, for which, in
presence of this company, I promise to
be accountable.”—So saying, he laugh∣ed
very heartily, and even seemed to en∣joy
the retaliation which had been exacted
at his own expence; but lady Bullford
looked very grave; and in all probabili∣ty
thought the lieutenant had carried his
resentment too far, considering that her
husband was valetudinary—but, accord∣ing
to the proverb, <HI>he that will play at
bowls must expect to meet with rubbers.</HI></P>
<P>I have seen a tame bear, very divert∣ing
when properly managed, become a
very dangerous wild beast when teized
for the entertainment of the spectators.—
As for Lismahago, he seemed to think
the fright and the cold bath would have
a good effect upon his patient's constitu∣tion;
but the doctor hinted some appre∣hension
that the gouty matter might, by
such a sudden shock, be repelled from the
extremities and thrown upon some of the
more vital parts of the machine.—I
should be very sorry to see this prognostic
verified upon our facetious landlord, who
told Mrs. Tabitha at parting, that he
hoped she would remember him in the
distribution of the bride's favours, as he
<PB N="167" REF="167"/>
had taken so much pains to put the cap∣tain's
parts and mettle to the proof.—
After all, I am afraid our 'squire will ap∣pear
to be the greatest sufferer by the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ronet's
wit; for his constitution is by no
means calculated for night-alarms.—He

<P>MISS Liddy is so good as to unclose

<OPENER>To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.
MY DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>THIS method of writing to you from
time to time, without any hopes of an
answer, affords me, I own, some ease and
satisfaction in the midst of my disquiet, as
it in some degree lightens the burthen
of affliction; but it is at best a very im∣perfect
enjoyment of friendship, because
it admits of no return of confidence and
good counsel—I would give the whole
world to have your company for a single
day—I am heartily tired of this itinerant
way of life—I am quite dizzy with a per∣petual
succession of objects—Besides it is
impossible to travel such a length of way,
without being exposed to inconveniences,
dangers, and disagreeable accidents,
which prove very grievous to a poor crea∣ture
of weak nerves like me, and make
me pay very dear for the gratification of
my curiosity.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="173"/>
Nature never intended me for the busy
world—I long for repose and solitude,
where I can enjoy that disinterested friend∣ship
which is not to be found among
crouds, and indulge those pleasing reve∣ries
that shun the hurry and tumult of
fashionable society—Unexperienced as
I am in the commerce of life, I have seen
enough to give me a disgust to the gene∣rality
of those who carry it on—There is
such malice, treachery, and dissimulation,
even among professed friends and inti∣mate
companions, as cannot fail to strike
a virtuous mind with horror; and when
Vice quits the stage for a moment, her
place is immediately occupied by Folly,
which is often too serious to excite any
thing but compassion—Perhaps I ought
to be silent on the foibles of my poor
aunt; but with you, my dear Willis, I
have no secrets; and, truly, her weak∣nesses
are such as cannot be concealed.
Since the first moment we arrived at Bath,
she has been employed constantly in
spreading nets for the other sex; and, at
length, she has caught a superannuated
lieutenant, who is in a fair way to make
her change her name—My uncle and my
brother seem to have no objection to this
extraordinary match, which, I make no
<PB N="174" REF="174"/>
doubt, will afford abundance of matter
of conversation and mirth; for my part,
I am too sensible of my own weaknesses,
to be diverted with those of other peo∣ple
—At present, I have something at
heart that employs my whole attention,
and keeps my mind in the utmost terror
and suspence.</P>
<P>Yesterday in the forenoon, as I stood
with my brother at the parlour window
of an inn, where we had lodged, a per∣son
passed a-horseback, whom (gracious
Heaven!) I instantly discovered to be
Wilson! He wore a white riding-coat,
with the cape buttoned up to his chin;
looked remarkably pale, and passed at a
round trot, without seeming to observe
us—Indeed, he could not see us; for
there was a blind that concealed us from
the view. You may guess how I was af∣fected
at this apparition—The light for∣sook
my eyes; and I was seized with such
a palpitation and trembling, that I could
not stand. I sat down upon a couch, and
strove to compose myself, that my bro∣ther
might not perceive my agitation;
but it was impossible to escape his prying
eyes—He had observed the object that
alarmed me; and, doubtless, knew him
at the first glance—He now looked at me
<PB N="175" REF="175"/>
with a stern countenance; then he ran
out into the street, to see what road the
unfortunate horseman had taken—He af∣terwards
dispatched his man for further
intelligence, and seemed to meditate some
violent design. My uncle, being out of
order, we remained another night at the
inn; and all day long Jery acted the part
of an indefatigable spy upon my conduct
—He watched my very looks with such
eagerness of attention, as if he would
have penetrated into the utmost recesse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of my heart—This may be owing to his
regard for my honour, if it is not the ef∣fect
of his own pride; but he is so hot,
and violent, and unrelenting, that the
sight of him alone throws me into a flut∣ter;
and really it will not be in my
power to afford him any share of my af∣fection,
if he persists in persecuting me at
this rate. I am afraid he has formed
some scheme of vengeance, which will
make me completely wretched! I am a∣fraid
he suspects some collusion from
this appearance of Wilson.—Good
God! did he really appear? or was it
only a phantom, a pale spectre to apprise
me of his death?</P>
<P>O Letty, what shall I do?—where shall
I turn for advice and consolation?—shall
<PB N="176" REF="176"/>
I implore the protection of my uncle,
who has been always kind and compas∣sionate.
—This must be my last resource.
—I dread the thoughts of making him
uneasy; and would rather suffer a thou∣sand
deaths than live the cause of dissen∣sion
in the family.—! cannot perceive the
meaning of Wilson's coming hither:—
perhaps, he was in quest of us, in order
to disclose his real name and situation:—
but wherefore pass without staying to
make the least inquiry?—My dear Wil∣lis,
I am lost in conjecture.—I have not
closed an eye since I saw him.—All night
long have I been tossed about from one
imagination to another.—The reflection
finds no resting place.—I have prayed,
and sighed, and wept plentifully.—If
this terrible suspence continues much
longer, I shall have another fit of illness,
and then the whole family will be in con∣fusion.
—If it was consistent with the wise
purposes of Providence, would I were in
my grave.—But it is my duty to be re∣signed
—My dearest Letty, excuse my
weakness—excuse these blots—my tears
fall so fast that I cannot keep the paper
dry—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et I ought to consider that I have
as yet no cause to despair—but I am
such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint-hearted timorous creature!</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="177"/>
Thank God, my uncle is much better
than he was yesterday.—He is resolved
to pursue our journey strait to Wales.—
I hope we shall take Gloucester in our

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR WATKIN,</OPENER>
<P>I YESTERDAY met with an incident
which I believe you will own to be very
surprising—As I stood with Liddy at the
window of the inn where we had lodged,
who should pass by but Wilson a-horse∣back!
—I could not be mistaken in the
person, for I had a full view of him as
he advanced; I plainly perceived by my
sister's confusion that she recognized him
at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time. I was equally astonish∣ed
and incensed at his appearance, which I
could not but interpret into an insult, or
something worse. I ran out at the gate,
and, seeing him turn the corner of the
street, I dispatched my servant to observe
his motions, but the fellow was too late
to bring me that satisfaction. He told me,
however, that there was an inn, called the
Red Lion, at that end of the town, where
he supposed the horseman had alighted,
<PB N="179" REF="179"/>
but that he would not enquire without fur∣ther
orders. I sent him back immediate∣ly
to know what strangers were in the
house, and he returned with a report that
there was one Mr. Wilson lately arrived.
In consequence of this information I
charged him with a note directed to that
gentleman, desiring him to meet me in
half an hour in a certain field at the town's
end, with a case of pistols, in order to
decide the difference which could not be
determined at our last rencounter: but I
did not think proper to subscribe the bil∣let.
My man assured me he had delivered
it into his own hand; and, that having
read it, he declared he would wait upon
the gentleman at the place and time ap∣pointed.</P>
<P>M`Alpine beingan old soldier, and lucki∣ly
sober at the time, I entrusted him with
my secret. I ordered him to be within call,
and, having given him a letter to be deliver∣ed
to my uncle in case of accident, I repaired
to the rendezvous, which was an inclosed
field at a little distance from the high∣way.
I found my antagonist had already
taken his ground, wrapped in a dark
horseman's coat, with a laced hat flapped
over his eyes; but what was my astonish∣ment,
when, throwing off this wrapper,
<PB N="180" REF="180"/>
he appeared to be a person whom I had
never seen before! He had one pistol
stuck in a leather belt, and another in his
hand ready for action, and, advancing a
few steps, called to know if I was ready
—I answered, “No,” and desired a par∣ley;
upon which he turned the muzzle
of his piece towards the earth; then re∣placed
it in his belt, and met me half
way—When I assured him he was not the
man I expected to meet he said, <HI>it might
be so:</HI> that he had received a slip of pa∣per
directed to Mr. Wilson, requesting
him to come hither; and that as there
was no other in the place of that name,
he naturally concluded the note was in∣tended
for him, and him only—I then gave
him to understand, that I had been injur∣ed
by a person who assumed that name,
which person I had actually seen within
the hour, passing through the street on
horseback; that hearing there was a Mr.
Wilson at the Red Lion, I took it for
granted he was the man, and in that be∣lief
had writ the billet; and I expressed
my surprize, that he, who was a stranger
to me and my concerns, should give me
such a rendezvous, without taking the
trouble to demand a previous explana∣nation
—He replied, that there was no
<PB N="181" REF="181"/>
other of his name in the whole county;
that no such horseman had alighted at the
Red Lion since nine o'clock, when he
arrived—that having had the honour to
serve his majesty, he thought he could
not decently decline any invitation of this
kind, from what quarter soever it might
come; and that if any explanation was
necessary, it did not belong to him to de∣mand
it, but to the gentleman who sum∣moned
him into the field—Vexed as I was
at this adventure, I could not help ad∣miring
the coolness of this officer, whose
open countenance prepossessed me in his
favour.—He seemed to be turned of for∣ty;
wore his own short black hair, which
curled naturally about his ears, and was
very plain in his apparel—When I beg∣ged
pardon for the trouble I had given
him, he received my apology with great
good humour.—He told me that he lived
about ten miles off, at a small farm house,
which would afford me tolerable lodging,
if I would come and take the diversion of
hunting with him for a few weeks; in
which case we might, perhaps, find out
the man who had given me offence—I
thanked him very sincerely for his courte∣ous
offer, which, I told him, I was not
at liberty to accept at present, on account
<PB N="182" REF="182"/>
of my being engaged in a family partie;
and so we parted, with mutual professions
of good will and esteem.</P>
<P>Now tell me, dear knight, what am I
to make of this singular adventure?—Am
I to suppose that the horseman I saw was
really a thing of flesh and blood, or a
bubble that vanished into air?—or must
I imagine Liddy knows more of the mat∣ter
than she chuses to disclose?—If I
thought her capable of carrying on any
clandestine correspondence with such a fel∣low,
I should at once discard all tender∣ness,
and forget that she was connected
with me by the ties of blood—But how
is it possible that a girl of her simplicity
and inexperience, should maintain such
an intercourse, surrounded, as she is with
so many eyes, destitute of all opportuni∣ty,
and shifting quarters every day of her
life!—Besides, she has solemnly promised
—No—I can't think the girl so base—so
insensible to the honour of her family.—
What disturbs me chiefly, is the impres∣sion
which these occurrences seem to make
upon her spirits—These are the symptoms
from which I conclude that the rascal has
still a hold on her affection—surely I have
a right to call him a rascal, and to con∣clude
<PB N="183" REF="183"/>
that his designs are infamous—But
it shall be my fault if he does not one day
repent his presumption—I confess I
cannot think, much less write on this sub∣ject,
with any degree of temper or pati∣ence;
I shall therefore conclude with tell∣ing
you, that we hope to be in Wales by
the latter end of the month: but before
that period you will probably hear again

in this address—We have been this day
within a hair's breadth of losing honest

but a great quantity of rain having fallen
last night and this morning, there was
such an accumulation of water, that a
mill-head gave way, just as the coach was
passing under it, and the flood rushed
<PB N="185" REF="185"/>
down with such impetuosity, as first float∣ed,
and then fairly overturned the car∣riage
in the middle of the stream—Lisma∣hago
and I, and the two servants, al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght∣ing
instantaneously, ran into the river to
give all the assistance in our power.—Our
aunt, Mrs. Tabitha, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad the good
fortune to be uppermost, was already
half way out of the coach window, when
her lover approaching, disengaged her
entirely; but, whether his foot slipt, or
the burthen was too great, they fell over
head and ears in each other's arms. He
endeavoured more than once to get up,
and even to disentangle himself from her
embrace, but she hung about his neck
like a mill-stone (no bad emblem of ma∣trimony,)
and if my man had not proved
a staunch auxiliary, those two lovers would
in all probability have gone hand in
hand to the shades below—For my part,
I was too much engaged to take any cog∣nizance
of their distress.—I snatched out
my sister by the hair of the head, and,
dragging her to the bank, recollected
that my uncle had not yet appeared—
Rushing again into the stream, I met
Clinker hauling ashore Mrs. Jenkins, who
looked like a mermaid with her hair di∣shevelled
about her ears; but, when I ask∣ed
<PB N="186" REF="186"/>
if his master was safe, he forthwith
shook her from him, and she must have
gone to pot, if a miller had not season∣ably
come to her relief.—As for Hum∣phrey,
he flew like lightning to the coach,
that was by this time filled with water,
and, diving into it, brought up the poor
'squire, to all appearance, deprived of
life—It is not in my power to describe
what I felt at this melancholy spectacle—
it was such an agony as baffles all descrip∣tion!
The faithful Clinker, taking him
up in his arms, as if he had been an in∣fant
of six months, carried him ashore,
howling most piteously all the way, and I
followed him in a transport of grief and
consternation—When he was laid upon
the grass, and turned from side to side,
a great quantity of water ran out at his
mouth, then he opened his eyes, and
fetched a deep sigh—Clinker perceiving
these signs of life, immediately tied up his
arm with a garter, and, pulling out a horse∣fleam,
let him blood in the farrier stile.—
At first a few drops only issued from the
orifice; but the limb being chafed, in a
little time the blood began to flow in a
continued stream, and he uttered some in∣coherent
words, which were the most wel∣come
sounds that ever saluted my ear.
<PB N="187" REF="187"/>
There was a country inn hard by, the
landlord of which had by this time come
with his people to give their assistance.—
Thither my uncle being carried, was un∣dressed
and put to bed, wrapped in warm
blankets; but having been moved too
soon, he fainted away, and once more lay
without sense or motion, notwithstanding
all the efforts of Clinker and the land∣lord,
who bathed his temples with Hun∣gary
water, and held a smelling-bottle to
his nose. As I had heard of the efficacy
of salt in such cases, I ordered all that
was in the house to be laid under his head
and body; and whether this application
had the desired effect, or nature of herself
prevailed, he, in less than a quarter of an
hour, began to breathe regularly, and
soon retrieved his recollection, to the un∣speakable
joy of all the by-standers. As
for Clinker, his brain seemed to be affect∣ed.
—He laughed, and wept, and danced
about in such a distracted manner, that
the landlord very judiciously conveyed
him out of the room. My uncle, seeing
me dropping wet, comprehended the
whole of what had happened, and asked
if all the company was safe?—Being an∣swered
in the affirmative, he insisted up∣on
my putting on dry clothes; and, hav∣ing
<PB N="188" REF="188"/>
swallowed a little warm wine, desired
he might be left to his repose. Before I
went to shift myself, I inquired about the
rest of the family—I found Mrs. Tabitha
still delirious from her fright, discharg∣ing
very copiously the water she had swal∣lowed.
She was supported by the cap∣tain,
distilling drops from his uncurled
periwig, so lank and so dank, that he
looked like father Thame without his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edges, embracing Isis, while she cascad∣ed
in his urn. Mrs. Jenkins was pre∣sent
also, in a loose bed-gown, without
either cap or handkerchief; but she seem∣ed
to be as little <HI>compos mentis</HI> as her mis∣tress,
and acted so many cross purposes
in the course of her attendance, that, be∣tween
the two, Lismahago had occasion
for all his philosophy. As for Liddy, I
thought the poor girl would have actu∣ally
lost her senses. The good-woman of
the house had shifted her linen, and put
her into bed; but she was seized with the
idea that her uncle had perished, and in
this persuasion made a dismal out-cry;
nor did she pay the least regard to what I
said, when I solemnly assured her he was
safe. Mr. Bramble hearing the noise, and
being informed of her apprehension, de∣sired
she might be brought into his cham∣ber;
<PB N="189" REF="189"/>
and she no sooner received this in∣timation,
than she ran thither half naked,
with the wildest expression of eagerness
in her countenance—Seeing the 'squire
sitting up in the bed, she sprung forwards,
and, throwing her arms about his neck,
exclaimed in a most pathetic tone, “Are
you—Are you indeed my uncle—My
dear uncle!—My best friend! My fa∣ther!
—Are you really living? or is it
an illusion of my poor brain!” Honest
Matthew was so much affected, that he
could not help shedding tears, while he
kissed her forehead, saying, “My dear
Liddy, I hope I shall live long enough
to shew how sensible I am of your af∣fection
—But your spirits are fluttered,
child—You want rest—Go to bed and
compose yourself—” “Well, I will
(she replied)—but still methinks this
cannot be real—The coach was full of
water—My uncle was under us all—
Gracious God!—You was under water
—How did you get out?—tell me
that? or I shall think this is all a de∣ception
—” “In what manner I was
brought out, I know as little as you
do, my dear (said the 'squire); and,
truly, that is a circumstance of which
I want to be informed.” I would have
<PB N="190" REF="190"/>
given him a detail of the whole adven∣ture,
but he would not hear me until I
should change my clothes; so that I had
only time to tell him, that he owed his
life to the courage and fidelity of Clin∣ker;
and having given him this hint, I
conducted my sister to her own cham∣ber.</P>
<P>This accident happened about three
o'clock in the afternoon, and in little
more than an hour the hurricane was all
over; but as the carriage was found to
be so much damaged, that it could not
proceed without considerable repairs, a
blacksmith and wheelwright were imme∣diately
sent for to the next market-town,
and we congratulated ourselves upon be∣ing
housed at an inn, which, though re∣mote
from the post-road, afforded ex∣ceeding
good lodging. The women be∣ing
pretty well composed, and the men
all a-foot, my uncle sent for his servant,
and, in the presence of Lismahago and
me, accosted him in these words—“So,
Clinker, I find you are resolved I
shan't die by water—As you have fished
me up from the bottom at your own
risque, you are at least entitled to all
the money that was in my pocket, and
there it is—” So saying, he presented
<PB N="191" REF="191"/>
him with a purse containing thirty
guineas, and a ring nearly of the same
value—“God forbid! (cried Clinker)
your honour shall excuse me—I am a
poor fellow; but I have a heart—O!
if your honour did but know how I re∣joice
to see—Blessed be his holy name,
that made me the humble instrument—
But as for the lucre of gain, I renounce
it—I have done no more than my duty
—No more than I would have done
for the most worthless of my fellow∣creatures
—No more than I would have
done for captain Lismahago, or Archy
Macalpine, or any sinner upon earth—
But for your worship, I would go
through fire as well as water—” “I
do believe it, Humphry (said the
'squire); but as you think it was your
duty to save my life at the hazard of
your own, I think it is mine to express
the sense I have of your extraordinary
fidelity and attachment—I insist upon
your receiving this small token of my
gratitude; but don't imagine that I
look upon this as an adequate recom∣pence
for the service you have done
me—I have determined to settle thirty
pounds a-year upon you for life; and
I desire these gentlemen will bear wit∣ness
<PB N="192" REF="192"/>
to this my intention, of which I
have a memorandum in my pocket∣book.”
“Lord make me thankful
for all these mercies! (cried Clinker,
sobbing) I have been a poor bankrupt
from the beginning—your honour's
goodness found me, when I was—nak∣ed
—when I was—sick and forlorn—
I understand your honour's looks—I
would not give offence—but my heart
is very full—and if your worship won't
give me leave to speak,—I must vent
it in prayers to heaven for my benefac∣tor.”
When he quitted the room, Lis∣mahago
said, he should have a much bet∣ter
opinion of his honesty, if he did not
whine and cant so abominably; but that
he had always observed those weeping and
praying fellows were hypocrites at bot∣tom.
Mr. Bramble made no reply to this
sarcastic remark, proceeding from the
lieutenant's resentment of Clinker's hav∣ing,
in pure simplicity of heart, ranked
him with M'Alpine and the sinners of
the earth.—The landlord being called
to receive some orders about the beds,
told the 'squire that his house was very
much at his service, but he was sure he
should not have the honour to lodge him
and his company. He gave us to under∣stand
<PB N="193" REF="193"/>
that his master, who lived hard by,
would not suffer us to be at a public
house, when there was accommodation
for us at his own; and that, if he had
not dined abroad in the neighbourhood
he would have undoubtedly come to offer
his services at our first arrival. He then
launched out in praise of that gentleman,
whom he had served as butler, represent∣ing
him as a perfect miracle of goodness
and generosity. He said he was a person
of great learning, and allowed to be the
best farmer in the country:—that he had
a lady who was as much beloved as him∣self,
and an only son, a very hopeful
young gentleman, just recovered from a
dangerous fever, which had like to have
proved fatal to the whole family; for, if
the son had died, he was sure the parents
would not have survived their loss—He
had not yet finished the encomium of Mr.
Dennison, when this gentleman arrived
in a post-chaise, and his appearance seem∣ed
to justify all that had been said in his
favour. He is pretty well advanced in
years, but hale, robust, and florid, with
an ingenuous countenance, expressive of
good sense and humanity. Having con∣doled
with us on the accident which had
happened, he said he was come to con∣duct
<PB N="194" REF="194"/>
us to his habitation, where we should
be less incommoded than at such a paultry
inn, and expressed his hope that the la∣dies
would not be the worse for going thi∣ther
in his carriage, as the distance was
not above a quarter of a mile. My
uncle having made a proper return to this
courteous exhibition, eyed him attentive∣ly,
and then asked if he had not been at
Oxford, a commoner of Queen's college?
When Mr. Dennison answered, “Yes,” with
some marks of surprise—“Look at me
then (said our 'squire) and let us see if
you can recollect the features of an old
friend, whom you have not seen these
forty years.”—The gentleman, tak∣ing
him by the hand, and gazing at him
earnestly,—“I protest, (cried he,) I do
think I recal the idea of Matthew
Loyd of Glamorganshire, who was stu∣dent
of Jesus.” “Well remembered,
my dear friend, Charles Dennison, (ex∣claimed
my uncle, pressing him to his
breast), I am that very identical Mat∣thew
Loyd of Glamorgan.” Clinker,
who had just entered the room with some
coals for the fire, no sooner heard these
words, than, throwing down the scuttle
on the toes of Lismahago, he began to
caper as if he was mad, crying—“Mat∣thew
<PB N="195" REF="195"/>
Loyd of Glamorgan!—O Provi∣dence!
—Matthew Loyd of Glamor∣gan!”
—Then, clasping my uncle's
knees, he went on in this manner—
“Your worship must forgive me—Mat∣thew
Loyd of Glamorgan!—O Lord,
Sir!—I can't contain myself!—I shall
lose my senses—” “Nay, thou hast
lost them already, I believe, (said the
'squire, peevishly) prithee Clinker be
quiet—What is the matter?”—
Humphrey, fumbling in his bosom, pull∣ed
out an old wooden snuff-box, which he
presented in great trepidation to his mas∣ter,
who, opening it immediately, per∣ceived
a small cornelian seal, and two
scraps of paper—At sight of these arti∣cles
he started, and changed colour, and,
casting his eye upon the inscriptions—“Ha!
—how!—what!—where (cried he) is the
“person here named?” Clinker, knock∣ing
his own breast, could hardly pro∣nounce
these words—“Here—here—
here is Matthew Loyd, as the certificate
sheweth—Humphrey Clinker was the
name of the farrier that took me 'pren∣tice”
—“And who gave you these to∣kens,”
—said my uncle, hastily—“My
poor mother on her death-bed”—re∣plied
the other—“And who was your
<PB N="196" REF="196"/>
mother?” “Dorothy Twyford, an
please your honour, heretofore bar∣keeper
at the Angel at Chippenham.”—
“And why were not these tokens pro∣duced
before?” “My mother told
me she had wrote to Glamorganshire,
at the time of my birth, but had no
answer; and that afterwards, when she
made enquiry, there was no such per∣son
in that county.” “And so in con∣sequence
of my changing my name and
going abroad at that very time, thy
poor mother and thou have been left
to want and misery—I am really shock∣ed
at the consequence of my own folly.”
—Then, laying his hand on Clinker's
head, he added, “Stand forth, Matthew
Loyd—You see, gentlemen, how the
sins of my youth rise up in judgment
against me—Here is my direction writ∣ten
with my own hand, and a seal
which I left at the woman's request;
and this is a certificate of the child's
baptism, signed by the curate of the
parish.” The company were not a
little surprised at this discovery, upon which
Mr. Dennison facetiously congratulated
both the father and the son: for my part,
I shook my new-found cousin heartily by
the hand, and Lismahago complimented
<PB N="197" REF="197"/>
him with the tears in his eyes, for he had
been hopping about the room, swearing
in broad Scotch, and bellowing with the
pain occasioned by the fall of the coal-scuttle
upon his foot. He had even vow∣ed
to drive the <HI>saul</HI> out of the body of
that mad rascal: but, perceiving the un∣expected
turn which things had taken, he
wished him joy of his good fortune, ob∣serving
that it went very near his heart,
as he was like to be a great toe out of
pocket by the discovery—Mr Dennison
now desired to know for what reason my
uncle had changed the name by which he
knew him at Oxford, and our 'squire sa∣tisfied
him, by answering to this effect.—
“I took my mother's name, which was
Loyd, as heir to her lands in Glamor∣ganshire;
but, when I came of age, I
sold that property, in order to clear my
paternal estate, and resumed my real
name; so that I am now Matthew
Bramble of Brambleton-hall in Mon∣mouthshire,
at your service; and this
is my nephew, Jeremy Melford of Bel∣field,
in the county of Glamorgan.”
At that instant the ladies entering the
room, he presented Mrs. Tabitha as his
sister, and Liddy as his niece. The old
gentleman saluted them very cordially,
<PB N="198" REF="198"/>
and seemed struck with the appearance of
my sister, whom he could not help sur∣veying
with a mixture of complacency
and surprize—“Sister, (said my uncle)
there is a poor relation that recom∣mends
himself to your good graces—
The quondam Humphrey Clinker is
metamorphosed into Matthew Loyd;
and claims the honour of being your
carnal kinsman—in short, the rogue
proves to be a crab of my own plant∣ing
in the days of hot blood and unre∣strained
libertinism.” Clinker had by
this time dropt upon one knee, by the
side of Mrs. Tabitha, who, eyeing him
askance, and flirting her fan with marks
of agitation, thought proper, after some
conflict, to hold out her hand for him
to kiss, saying, with a demure aspect,
“Brother, you have been very wicked:
but I hope you'll live to see the folly of
your ways—I am very sorry to say the
young man, whom you have this day ac∣knowledged,
has more grace and reli∣gion,
by the gift of God, than you
with all our profane learning, and re∣peated
opportunity—I do think he has
got the trick of the eye, and the tip of
the nose of my uncle Loyd of Flluy∣dwellyn;
and as for the long chin,
<PB N="199" REF="199"/>
it is the very moral of the governor's—
Brother, as you have changed his name
pray change his dress also; that livery
doth not become any person that hath
got our blood in his veins.”—Liddy
seemed much pleased with this acquisition
to the family.—She took him by the hand,
declaring she should always be proud to
own her connexion with a virtuous young
man, who had given so many proofs of
his gratitude and affection to her uncle.—
Mrs. Winifred Jenkins extremely flut∣tered
between her surprize at this disco∣very,
and the apprehension of losing her
sweet-heart, exclaimed in a giggling tone,
—“I wish you joy, Mr. Clinker—Floyd
—I would say—hi, hi, hi!—you'll be
so proud you won't look at your poor
fellow servants, oh, oh, oh!” Honest
Clinker owned he was overjoyed at his
good fortune, which was greater than he
deserved—“But wherefore should I be
proud? (said he) a poor object conceiv∣ed
in sin, and brought forth in iniqui∣ty,
nursed in a parish work-house, and
bred in a smithy—Whenever I seem
proud, Mrs. Jenkins, I beg of you to
put me in mind of the condition I was
in, when I first saw you between Chip∣penham
and Marlborough.”</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="200"/>
When this momentous affair was dis∣cused
to the satisfaction of all parties
concerned, the weather being dry, the
ladies declined the carriage; so that we
walked all together to Mr. Dennison's house,
where we found the tea ready prepared
by his lady, an amiable matron, who re∣ceived
us with all the benevolence of hos∣pitality.
—The house is old fashioned and
irregular, but lodgeable and commodious.
To the south it has the river in front, at
the distance of a hundred paces; and on
the north, there is a rising-ground, cover∣ed
with an agreeable plantation; the greens
and walks are kept in the nicest order,
and all is rural and romantic. I have not
yet seen the young gentleman, who is on a
visit to a friend in the neighbourhood,
from whose house he is not expected 'till
to-morrow.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as there is a man
going to the next market-town with let∣ters
for the post, I take this opportunity
to send you the history of this day, which
has been remarkably full of adventures;
and you will own I give you them like a
beef-steak at Dolly's, <HI>hot</HI> and <HI>hot,</HI> without

</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<PB N="201" REF="201"/>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>SINCE the last trouble I gave you, I
have met with a variety of incidents, some
of them of a singular nature, which I re∣serve
as a fund for conversation; but there
are others so interesting, that they will
not keep in <HI>petto</HI> till meeting.</P>
<P>Know then, it was a thousand pounds
to a sixpence, that you should now be ex∣ecuting
my will, instead of perusing my
letter! Two days ago, our coach was
overturned in the midst of a rapid river,
where my life was saved with the utmost
difficulty, by the courage, activity, and
presence of mind of my servant Humphry
Clinker—But this is not the most sur∣prising
circumstance of the adventure—
The said Humphry Clinker proves to be
Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thew Loyd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> son of one Mat∣thew
Loyd of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if you know
any such person—You see, Doctor, that
<PB N="202" REF="202"/>
notwithstanding all your philosophy, it is
not without some reason that we Welch∣men
ascribe such energy to the force of
blood—But we shall discuss this point on
some future occasion.</P>
<P>This is not the only discovery which I
made in consequence of our disaster—
We happened to be wrecked upon a
friendly shore—The lord of the manor
is no other than Charles Dennison, our
fellow-rake at Oxford—We are now hap∣pily
housed with that gentleman, who has
really attained to that pitch of rural feli∣city,
at which I have been aspiring these
twenty years in vain. He is blessed with
a consort, whose disposition is suited to
his own in all respects; tender, generous,
and benevolent—She, moreover, possesses
an uncommon share of understanding,
fortitude, and discretion, and is admir∣ably
qualified to be his companion, con∣fidant,
counsellor, and coadjutrix. These
excellent persons have an only son, about
nineteen years of age, just such a youth
as they could have wished that Heaven
would bestow to fill up the measure of
their enjoyment—In a word, they know
no other allay to their happiness, but their
apprehension and anxiety about the life
and concerns of this beloved object.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="203"/>
Our old friend, who had the misfor∣tune
to be a second brother, was bred to
the law, and even called to the bar; but
he did not find himself qualified to shine
in that province, and had very little in∣clination
for his profession—He disobliged
his father, by marrying for love, with∣out
any consideration of fortune; so that
he had little or nothing to depend upon
for some years but his practice, which af∣forded
him a bare subsistence; and
the prospect of an increasing family, be∣gan
to give him disturbance and disquiet.
In the mean time, his father dying, was
succeeded by his elder brother, a fox-hunter
and a sot, who neglected his af∣fairs,
insulted and oppressed his servants,
and in a few years had well nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ruined
the estate, when he was happily carried
off by a fever, the immediate consequence
of a debauch. Charles, with the appro∣bation
of his wife, immediately deter∣mined
to quit business, and retire into the
country, although this resolution was
strenuously and zealously opposed by every
individual, whom he consulted on the
subject. Those who had tried the expe∣riment,
assured him that he could not pre∣tend
to breathe in the country for less than
the double of what his estate produced;
<PB N="204" REF="204"/>
that, in order to be upon the footing of a
gentleman, he would be obliged to keep
horses, hounds, carriages, with a suitable
number of servants, and maintain an ele∣gant
table for the entertainment of his
neighbours; that farming was a mystery,
known only to those who had been bred
up to it from the cradle, the success of it
depending not only upon skill and indus∣try,
but also upon such attention and
oeconomy as no gentleman could be sup∣posed
to give or practise; accordingly,
every attempt made by gentlemen mis∣carried,
and not a few had been ruined
by their prosecution of agriculture—Nay,
they affirmed that he would find it cheap∣er
to buy hay and oats for his cattle, and
to go to market for poultry, eggs, kitchen
herbs, and roots, and every the most in∣considerable
article of house-keeping,
than to have those articles produced on
his own ground.</P>
<P>These objections did not deter Mr.
Dennison, because they were chiefly
founded on the supposition, that he would
be obliged to lead a life of extravagance
and dissipation, which he and his consort
equally detested, despised, and determin∣ed
to avoid—The objects he had in view,
were health of body, peace of mind, and
<PB N="205" REF="205"/>
the private satisfaction of domestic quiet,
unallayed by actual want, and uninter∣rupted
by the fears of indigence—He was
very moderate in his estimate of the ne∣cessaries,
and even of the comforts of life
—He required nothing but wholesome
air, pure water, agreeable exercise, plain
diet, convenient lodging, and decent ap∣parel.
He reflected, that if a peasant
without education, or any great share of
natural sagacity, could maintain a large
family, and even become opulent upon a
farm, for which he payed an annual rent
of two or three hundred pounds to the
landlord, surely he himself might hope
for some success from his industry, having
no rent to pay, but, on the contrary,
three or four hundred pounds a-year to
receive—He considered, that the earth
was an indulgent mother, that yielded her
fruits to all her children without distinc∣tion.
He had studied the theory of agri∣culture
with a degree of eagerness and de∣light;
and he could not conceive there
was any mystery in the practice, but
what he should be able to disclose by dint
of care and application. With respect to
houshold expence, he entered into a mi∣nute
detail and investigation, by which
he perceived the assertions of his friends
<PB N="206" REF="206"/>
were altogether erroneous—He found he
should save sixty pounds a-year in the
single article of house-rent, and as much
more in pocket-money and contingen∣cies;
that even butcher's-meat was twen∣ty
per cent. cheaper in the country that
in London; but that poultry, and almost
every other circumstance of house-keep∣ing,
might be had for less than one half
of what they cost in town; besides, a con∣siderable
saving on the side of dress, in
being delivered from the oppressive im∣position
of ridiculous modes, invented
by ignorance, and adopted by folly.</P>
<P>As to the danger of vying with the
rich in pomp and equipage, it never gave
him the least disturbance. He was now
turned of forty, and, having lived half
that time in the busy scenes of life, was
well skilled in the science of mankind.
There cannot be in nature a more con∣temptible
figure than that of a man, who
with five hundred a year presumes to ri∣val
in expence a neighbour who possesses
five times that income—His ostentation,
far from concealing, serves only to disco∣ver
his indigence, and render his vanity
the more shocking; for it attracts the
eyes of censure, and excites the spirit of
inquiry. There is not a family in the
<PB N="207" REF="207"/>
county, nor a servant in his own house,
nor a farmer in the parish, but what
knows the utmost farthing that his lands
produce, and all these behold him with
scorn or compassion. I am surprised that
these reflections do not occur to persons
in this unhappy dilemma, and produce a
salutary effect; but the truth is, of all the
passions incident to human nature, vani∣ty
is that which most effectually perverts
the faculties of the understanding; nay,
it sometimes becomes so incredibly de∣praved,
as to aspire at infamy, and find
pleasure in bearing the stigmas of re∣proach.</P>
<P>I have now given you a sketch of the
character and situation of Mr. Dennison,
when he came down to take possession of
this estate; but as the messenger, who
carries the letters to the next town is just
setting off, I shall reserve what further I
have to say on this subject, till the next
post, when you shall certainly hear from</P>

<PB N="208" REF="208"/>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>ONCE more, dear doctor, I resume
the pen for your amusement.—It was on
the morning after our arrival that, walk∣ing
out with my friend, Mr. Dennison,
I could not help breaking forth into the
warmest expressions of applause at the
beauty of the scene, which is really in∣chanting;
and I signified, in particular,
how much I was pleased with the disposi∣tion
of some detached groves, that afford∣ed
at once shelter and ornament to his ha∣bitation.</P>
<P>“When I took possession of these
lands, about two and twenty years ago,
(said he) there was not a tree standing
within a mile of the house, except
those of an old neglected orchard,
which produced nothing but leaves and
moss.—It was in the gloomy month of
November, when I arrived, and found
the house in such a condition, that it
might have been justly stiled the <HI>tower
of desolation.</HI>—The court-yard was co∣vered
<PB N="209" REF="209"/>
with nettles and docks, and the
garden exhibited such a rank plantation
of weeds as I had never seen before;—
the window-shutters were falling in
pieces;—the sashes broken;—and
owls and jack-daws had taken posses∣sion
of the chimnies.—The prospect
within was still more dreary.—All was
dark, and damp, and dirty beyond
description;—the rain penetrated in
several parts of the roof;—in some
apartments the very floors had given
way;—the hangings were parted from
the walls, and shaking in mouldy rem∣nants;
—the glasses were dropping
out of their frames;—the family-pic∣tures
were covered with dust;—and all
the chairs and tables worm-eaten and
crazy.—There was not a bed in the
house that could be used, except one
old-fashioned machine, with a high-gilt
tester, and fringed curtains of yellow
mohair, which had been, for aught I
know, two centuries in the fami∣ly.
—In short, there was no furniture
but the utensils of the kitchen; and
the cellar afforded nothing but a few
empty butts and barrels, that stunk so
abominably, that I would not suffer
any body to enter it until I had flashed
<PB N="210" REF="210"/>
a considerable quantity of gun-powder
to qualify the foul air within.”</P>
<P>“An old cottager and his wife, who
were hired to lie in the house, had left
it with precipitation, alledging, among
other causes of retreat, that they could
not sleep for frightful noises, and that
my poor brother certainly walked after
his death.—In a word, the house ap∣peared
uninhabitable; the barn, stable,
and out-houses were in ruins; all the
fences broken down, and the fields ly∣ing
waste.”</P>
<P>“The farmer who kept the key never
dreamed I had any intention to live
upon the spot.—He rented a farm of
sixty pounds, and his lease was just
expiring.—He had formed a scheme
of being appointed bailiff to the estate,
and of converting the house and the
adjacent grounds to his own use.—A
hint of his intention I received from
the curate at my first arrival; I there∣fore
did not pay much regard to what
he said by way of discouraging me
from coming to settle in the country;
but I was a little startled when he gave
me warning that he should quit the
farm at the expiration of his lease, un∣less
<PB N="211" REF="211"/>
I would abate considerably in the
rent.”</P>
<P>“At this period I accidentally became
acquainted with a person, whose friend∣ship
laid the foundation of all my pro∣sperity.
In the next market-town, I
chanced to dine at an inn with a Mr.
Wilson, who was lately come to settle
in the neighbourhood.—He had been
lieutenant of a man of war: but quit∣ted
the sea in some disgust, and mar∣ried
the only daughter of farmer Bland,
who lives in this parish, and has ac∣quired
a good fortune in the way of
husbandry.—Wilson is one of the best
natured men I ever knew; brave,
frank, obliging, and ingenuous.—He
liked my conversation, I was charmed
with his liberal manner; an acquain∣tance
immediately commenced, and
this was soon improved into a friend∣ship
without reserve.—There are cha∣racters
which, like similar particles of
matter, strongly attract each other.—
He forthwith introduced me to his fa∣ther-in-law,
farmer Bland, who was
well acquainted with every acre of my
estate, of consequence well qualified
to advise me on this occasion.—Find∣ing
<PB N="212" REF="212"/>
I was inclined to embrace a coun∣try
life, and even to amuse myself with
the occupations of farming, he approv∣ed
of my design—He gave me to un∣derstand
that all my farms were under∣lett;
that the estate was capable of
great improvement; that there was
plenty of chalk in the neighbourhood;
and that my own ground produced ex∣cellent
marle for manure.—With re∣spect
to the farm, which was like to
fall into my hands, he said he would
willingly take it at the present rent;
but at the same time owned, that if I
would expend two hundred pounds in
enclosure, it would be worth more than
double the sum.”</P>
<P>“Thus encouraged, I began the exe∣cution
of my scheme without further
delay, and plunged into a sea of ex∣pence,
though I had no fund in reserve,
and the whole produce of the estate
did not exceed three hundred pounds
a year.—In one week, my house was
made weather-tight, and thoroughly
cleansed from top to bottom; then it
was well ventilated by throwing all the
doors and windows open, and making
blazing fires of wood in every chimney
from the kitchen to the garrets.—The
<PB N="213" REF="213"/>
floors were repaired, the sashes new glaz∣ed,
and out of the old furniture of the
whole house, I made shift to sit up a
parlour and three chambers in a plain
yet decent manner.—The court-yard
was cleared of weeds and rubbish, and
my friend Wilson charged himself with
the dressing of the garden; bricklayers
were set at work upon the barn and
stable; and labourers engaged to re∣store
the fences, and begin the work
of hedging and ditching, under the di∣rection
of farmer Bland, at whose re∣commendation
I hired a careful hind
to lie in the house, and keep constant
fires in the apartments.”</P>
<P>“Having taken these measures, I re∣turned
to London, where I forthwith
sold off my houshold-furniture, and, in
three weeks from my first visit, brought
my wife hither to keep her Christ∣mas.
—Considering the gloomy
season of the year, the dreariness of the
place, and the decayed aspect of our
habitation, I was afraid that her resolu∣tion
would sink under the sudden trans∣ition
from a town-life to such a melan∣choly
state of rustication; but I was
agreeably disappointed.—She found
the reality less uncomfortable than the
<PB N="214" REF="214"/>
picture I had drawn.—By this time,
indeed, things were mended in appear∣ance.
—The out-houses had risen out of
their ruins; the pigeon-house was re∣built,
and replenished by Wilson, who
also put my garden in decent order,
and provided a good stock of poultry,
which made an agreeable figure in my
yard; and the house, on the whole,
looked like the habitation of human
creatures.—Farmer Bland spared me a
milch-cow for my family, and an ordi∣nary
saddle-horse for my servant to go
to market at the next town.—I hired a
country lad for a footman; the hind's
daughter was my house-maid, and my
wife had brought a cook-maid from
London.”</P>
<P>“Such was my family when I began
house-keeping in this place, with three
hundred pounds in my pocket, raised
from the sale of my superfluous furni∣ture
—I knew we should find occupa∣tion
enough through the day to employ
our time; but I dreaded the long win∣ter
evenings; yet for these too we
found a remedy.—The curate, who
was a single man, soon became so natu∣ralized
to the family, that he generally
lay in the house; and his company
<PB N="215" REF="215"/>
was equally agreeable and useful.—He
was a modest man, a good scholar, and
perfectly well qualified to instruct me
in such country matters as I wanted to
know.—Mr. Wilson brought his wife
to see us, and she became so fond of
Mrs. Dennison, that she said she was
never so happy as when she enjoyed the
benefit of her conversation.—She was
then a fine buxom country lass, ex∣ceedingly
docile, and as good-natured
as her husband Jack Wilson; so that a
friendship ensued among the women,
which hath continued to this day.”</P>
<P>“As for Jack, he hath been my con∣stant
companion, counsellor, and com∣missary.
—I would not for a hundred
pounds you should leave my house
without seeing him.—Jack is an uni∣versal
genius—his talents are really
astonishing—He is an excellent car∣penter,
joiner, and turner, and a cun∣ning
artist in iron and brass.—He not
only superintended my oeconomy, but
also presided over my pastimes.—He
taught me to brew beer, to make cyder,
perry, mead, usquebaugh, and plague-water;
to cook several outlandish deli∣cacies,
such as <HI>ollas, pepper pots, pillaws,
corys, chabobs,</HI> and <HI>stufatas.</HI>—He under∣stands
<PB N="216" REF="216"/>
all manner of games from chess
down to chuck-farthing, sings a good
song, plays upon the violin, and
dances a hornpipe with surprising agili∣ty.
—He and I walked, and rode, and
hunted, and fished together, without
minding the vicissitudes of the weather;
and I am persuaded, that in a raw,
moist climate, like this of England,
continual exercise is as necessary as food
to the preservation of the individual.—
In the course of two and twenty years,
there has not been one hour's interrup∣tion
or abatement in the friendship sub∣sisting
between Wilson's family and
mine; and, what is a rare instance of
good fortune, that friendship is conti∣nued
to our children.—His son and
mine are nearly of the same age and the
same disposition; they have been bred
up together at the same school and
college, and love each other with the
warmest affection.”</P>
<P>“By Wilson's means, I likewise form∣ed
an acquaintance with a sensible phy∣sician,
who lives in the next market-town;
and his sister, an agreeable old
maiden, passed the Christmas holidays
at our house.—Mean while I began my
farming with great eagerness, and that
<PB N="217" REF="217"/>
very winter planted these groves that
please you so much.—As for the neigh∣bouring
gentry, I had no trouble from
that quarter during my first campaign;
they were all gone to town before I
settled in the country; and by the
summer I had taken measures to defend
myself from their attacks.—When a
gay equipage came to my gates, I was
never at home; those who visited me
in a modest way, I received; and ac∣cording
to the remarks I made on their
characters and conversation, either re∣jected
their advances, or returned their
civility.—I was in general despised
among the fashionable company, as a
low fellow, both in breeding and cir∣cumstances;
nevertheless, I found a few
individuals of moderate fortune, who
gladly adopted my stile of living;
and many others would have acceded
to our society, had they not been pre∣vented
by the pride, envy, and ambition
of their wives and daughters.—Those,
in times of luxury and dissipation, are
the rocks upon which all the small
estates in the country are wrecked.”</P>
<P>“I reserved in my own hands, some
acres of ground adjacent to the house,
for making experiments in agriculture,
according to the directions of Lyle,
<PB N="218" REF="218"/>
Tull, Hart, Duhamel, and others who
have written on this subject; and qua∣lified
their theory with the practical ob∣servations
of farmer Bland, who was
my great master in the art of husban∣dry.
—In short, I became enamoured
of a country life; and my success
greatly exceeded my expectation.—
I drained bogs, burned heath, grubbed
up furze and fern; I planted copse and
willows where nothing else would grow;
I gradually inclosed all my farms, and
made such improvements, that my
estate now yields me clear twelve hun∣dred
pounds a year.—All this time
my wife and I have enjoyed unin∣terrupted
health, and a regular flow of
spirits, except on a very few occasions,
when our chearfulness was invaded by
such accidents as are inseparable from
the condition of life.—I lost two chil∣dren
in their infancy, by the small-pox,
so that I have one son only, in whom
all our hopes are centred.—He went
yesterday to visit a friend, with whom
he has stayed all night, but he will be
here to dinner.—I shall this day have
the pleasure of presenting him to you
and your family; and I flatter myself
you will find him not altogether un∣worthy
of our affection.”</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="219"/>
“The truth is, either I am blinded by
the partiality of a parent, or he is a boy
of a very amiable character; and yet
his conduct has given us unspeakable
disquiet.—You must know, we had
projected a match between him and a
gentleman's daughter in the next coun∣ty,
who will in all probability be heiress
of a considerable fortune; but, it
seems, he had a personal disgust to the
alliance.—He was then at Cambridge,
and tried to gain time on various pre∣tences;
but being pressed in letters by
his mother and me to give a definitive
answer, he fairly gave his tutor the slip,
and disappeared about eight months
ago.—Before he took this rash step, he
wrote me a letter, explaining his objec∣tions
to the match, and declaring, that
he would keep himself concealed until
he should understand that his parents
would dispense with his contracting an
engagement that must make him mi∣serable
for life, and he prescribed the
form of advertising in a certain news∣paper,
by which he might be apprized
of our sentiments on this subject.”</P>
<P>“You may easily conceive how much we
were alarmed and afflicted by this elope∣ment,
which he had made without drop∣ping
<PB N="220" REF="220"/>
the least hint to his companion
Charles Wilson, who belonged to the
same college.—We resolved to punish
him with the appearance of neglect, in
hopes that he would return of his own
accord; but he maintained his purpose
till the young lady chose a partner for
herself; then he produced himself,
and made his peace by the mediation
of Wilson.—Suppose we should unite
our families by joining him with your
niece, who is one of the most lovely
creatures I ever beheld.—My wife is
already as fond of her as if she were
her own child, and I have a presenti∣ment
that my son will be captivated by
her at first sight.” “Nothing could
be more agreeable to all our family
(said I) than such an alliance; but,
my dear friend, candour obliges me to
tell you, that I am afraid Liddy's heart
is not wholly disengaged—there is a
cursed obstacle—” “You mean
the young stroller at Gloucester (said
he)—You are surprised that I should
know this circumstance; but you will
be more surprised when I tell you that
stroller is no other than my son George
Dennison—That was the character he
assumed in his eclipse.” “I am, in∣deed,
<PB N="221" REF="221"/>
astonished and overjoyed, (cried
I) and shall be happy beyond expres∣sion
to see your proposal take effect.”</P>
<P>He then gave me to understand that
the young gentleman, at his emerging
from concealment, had disclosed his pas∣sion
for Miss Melford, the niece of Mr.
Bramble of Monmouthshire. Though
Mr. Dennison little dreamed that this was
his old friend Matthew Loyd, he neverthe∣less
furnished his son with proper creden∣tials,
and he had been at Bath, London, and
many other places in quest of us, to make
himself and his pretensions known.—The
bad success of his enquiry had such an
effect upon his spirits, that immediately at
his return he was seized with a dangerous
fever, which overwhelmed his parents
with terror and affliction; but he was
now happily recovered, though still weak
and disconsolate. My nephew joining us
in our walk, I informed him of these cir∣cumstances,
with which he was wonder∣fully
pleased. He declared he would pro∣mote
the match to the utmost of his power,
and that he longed to embrace young Mr.
Dennison as his friend and brother.—Mean
while, the father went to desire his wife
to communicate this discovery gradually
to Liddy, that her delicate nerves might
not suffer too sudden a shock; and I
<PB N="222" REF="222"/>
imparted the particulars to my sister Tab∣by,
who expressed some surprize, not alto∣gether
unmixed, I believe, with an emo∣tion
of envy; for, though she could have
no objection to an alliance at once so ho∣nourable
and advantageous, she hesitated
in giving her consent, on pretence of the
youth and inexperience of the parties: at
length, however, she acquiesced, in conse∣quence
of having consulted with captain
Lismahago.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennison took care to be in the
way when his son aarrived at the gate,
and, without giving him time or oppor∣tunity
to make any enquiry about the
strangers, brought him up stairs to be
presented to Mr. Loyd and his family—
The first person he saw, when he entered
the room, was Liddy, who, notwithstanding
all her preparation, stood trembling in the
utmost confusion—At sight of this object
he was fixed motionless to the floor, and,
gazing at her with the utmost eagerness of
astonishment, exclaimed, “Sacred hea∣ven!
what is this!—ha! wherefore—.”
Here his speech failing, he stood straining
his eyes, in the most emphatic silence—
“George (said his father) this is my
friend Mr. Loyd.” Roused at this
intimation, he turned and received my
salute, when I said, “Young gentleman,
<PB N="223" REF="223"/>
if you had trusted me with your secret
at our last meeting, we should have
parted upon better terms.” Before he
could make any answer, Jery came round
and stood before him with open arms.—
At first, he started and changed colour;
but after a short pause, he rushed into his
embrace, and they hugged one another as
if they had been intimate friends from
their infancy: then he payed his respects
to Mrs. Tabitha, and advancing to Lid∣dy,
“Is it possible, (cried he) that my
senses do not play me false!—that I see
Miss Melford under my father's roof—
that I am permitted to speak to her
without giving offence—and that her
relations have honoured me with their
countenance and protection.” Liddy
blushed, and trembled, and faultered—
“To be sure, sir, (said she) it is a very
surprising circumstance—a great—
a providential—I really know not
what I say—but I beg you will think
I have said what's agreeable.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Dennison interposing said, “Com∣pose
yourselves, my dear children.—
Your mutual happiness shall be our
peculiar care.” The son going up to
his mother, kissed one hand; my niece
bathed the other with her tears; and the
good old lady pressed them both in their
<PB N="224" REF="224"/>
turns to her breast.—The lovers were too
much affected to get rid of their embar∣rassment
for one day; but the scene was
much enlivened by the arrival of Jack
Wilson, who brought, as usual, some
game of his own killing.—His honest
countenance was a good letter of recom∣mendation.
—I received him like a dear
friend after a long separation; and I could
not help wondering to see him shake Jery
by the hand as an old acquaintance.—
They had, indeed, been acquainted some
days, in consequence of a diverting inci∣dent,
which I shall explain at meeting.—
That same night a consultation was held
upon the concerns of the lovers, when the
match was formally agreed to, and all the
marriage-articles were settled without the
least dispute.—My nephew and I pro∣mised
to make Liddy's fortune five thou∣sand
pounds. Mr. Dennison declared,
he would make over one half of his estate
immediately to his son, and that his
daughter-in-law should be secured in a
jointure of four hundred.—Tabby pro∣posed,
that, considering their youth, they
should undergo one year at least of proba∣tion
before the indissoluble knot should be
tied; but the young gentleman being
very impatient and importunate, and the
scheme implying that the young couple
<PB N="225" REF="225"/>
should live in the house, under the wings
of his parents, we resolved to make them
happy without further delay.</P>
<P>As the law requires that the parties
should be some weeks resident in the pa∣rish,
we shall stay here till the ceremony is
performed.—Mr. Lismahago requests
that he may take the benefit of the same
occasion; so that next Sunday the banns
will be published for all four together.—
I doubt, I shall not be able to pass my
Christmas with you at Brambleton-hall.
—Indeed, I am so agreeably situated in
this place, that I have no desire to shift
my quarters; and I foresee, that when
the day of separation comes, there will be
abundance of sorrow on all sides.—In the
mean time, we must make the most of
those blessings which Heaven bestows.—
Considering how you are tethered by your
profession, I cannot hope to see you so
far from home; yet the distance does not
exceed a summer-day's journey, and
Charles Dennison, who desires to be re∣membered
to you, would be rejoiced to
see his old compotator; but as I am now
stationary, I expect regular answers to the

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. at
Oxon.
DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>EVERY day is now big with incident
and discovery—Young Mr. Dennison
proves to be no other than that identical
person whom I have execrated so long, un∣der
the name of Wilson—He had eloped
from college at Cambridge, to avoid a
match that he detested, and acted in dif∣ferent
parts of the country as a stroller,
until the lady in question made choice of
a husband for herself; then he returned
to his father, and disclosed his passion for
Liddy, which met with the approbation
of his parents, though the father little
imagined that Mr. Bramble was his old
companion Matthew Loyd. The young
gentleman, being impowered to make ho∣nourable
proposals to my uncle and me,
had been in search of us all over Eng∣land,
<PB N="227" REF="227"/>
without effect; and he it was whom
I had seen pass on horseback by the win∣dow
of the inn, where I stood with my
sister, but he little dreamed that we were
in the house—As for the real Mr. Wilson,
whom I called forth to combat, by mis∣take,
he is the neighbour and inti∣mate
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riend of old Mr. Dennison, and
this connexion had suggested to the son
the idea of taking that name while he re∣mained
in obsurity.</P>
<P>You may easily conceive what pleasure
I must have felt on discovering that the
honour of our family was in no danger
from the conduct of a sister, whom I love
with uncommon affection; that, instead
of debasing her sentiments and views to a
wretched stroller, she had really capti∣vated
the heart of a gentleman, her equal
in rank and superior in fortune; and that,
as his parents approved of his attach∣ment,
I was on the eve of acquiring a
brother-in-law so worthy of my friendship
and esteem. George Dennison is, with∣out
all question, one of the most accom∣plished
young fellows in England. His
person is at once elegant and manly, and
his understanding highly cultivated. Tho'
his spirit is lofty, his heart is kind; and
<PB N="228" REF="228"/>
his manner so engaging, as to command
veneration and love, even from malice
and indifference. When I weigh my own
character with his, I am ashamed to find
myself so light in the balance; but the
comparison excites no envy—I propose
him as a model for imitation—I have
endeavoured to recommend myself to his
friendship, and hope I have already found
a place in his affection. I am, however,
mortified to reflect what flagrant injus∣tice
we every day commit, and what ab∣surd
judgment we form, in viewing ob∣jects
through the falsifying medium of
prejudice and passion. Had you asked
me a few days ago, the picture of Wilson
the player, I should have drawn a por∣trait
very unlike the real person and cha∣racter
of George Dennison—Without all
doubt, the greatest advantage acquired in
travelling and perusing mankind in the
original, is that of dispelling those shame∣ful
clouds that darken the faculties of the
mind, preventing it from judging with
candour and precision.</P>
<P>The real Wilson is a great original,
and the best tempered, companionable
man I ever knew—I question if ever he
was angry or low spirited in his life. He
<PB N="229" REF="229"/>
makes no pretensions to letters; but he
is an adept in every thing else that can
be either useful or entertaining. Among
other qualifications, he is a complete
sportsman, and counted the best shot in
the county. He and Dennison, and Lis∣mahago
and I, attended by Clinker, went
a-shooting yesterday, and made great ha∣vock
among the partridges—To-morrow
we shall take the field against the wood∣cocks
and snipes. In the evening we
dance and sing, or play at commerce, loo,
and quadrille.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennison is an elegant poet, and
has written some detached pieces on the
subject of his passion for Liddy, which
must be very flattering to the vanity of
a young woman—Perhaps he is one of
the greatest theatrical geniuses that ever
appeared. He sometimes entertains us
with reciting favourite speeches from our
best plays. We are resolved to convert
the great hall into a theatre, and get up
the <HI>Beaux Stratagem</HI> without delay—I think
I shall make no contemptible figure in
the character of <HI>Scrub;</HI> and Lismahago
will be very great in <HI>Captain Gibbet</HI>—Wil∣son
undertakes to entertain the country
people with <HI>Harlequin <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>keleton,</HI> for which
he has got a jacket ready painted with his
own hand.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="230"/>
Our society is really enchanting. Even
the severity of Lismahago relaxes, and
the vinegar of Mrs. Tabby is remarkably
dulcified, ever since it was agreed that
she should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake precedency of her niece
in being first noosed: for, you must know,
the day is fixed for Liddy's marriage;
and the banns for both couples have been
already once published in the parish
church. The Captain earnestly begged
that one trouble might serve for all, and
Tabitha assented with a vile affectation
of reluctance. Her inamorato, who came
hither very slenderly equipt, has sent for
his baggage to London, which, in all
probability, will not arrive in time for the
wedding; but it is of no great conse∣quence,
as every thing is to be transacted
with the utmost privacy—Meanwhile,
directions are given for making out the
contracts of marriage, which are very fa∣vourable
for both females; Liddy will be
secured in a good jointure; and her aunt will
remain mistress of her own fortune, ex∣cept
one half of the interest, which her
husband shall have a right to enjoy for
his natural life: I think this is as little in
conscience as can be done for a man
who yokes with such a partner for
life.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="231"/>
These expectants seem to be so happy,
that if Mr. Dennison had an agreeable
daughter, I believe I should be for making
the third couple in this country dance.
The humour seems to be infectious; for
Clinker, alias Loyd, has a month's mind
to play the fool, in the same fashion, with
Mrs. Winifred Jenkins. He has even
sounded me on the subject; but I have
given him no encouragement to prosecute
this scheme—I told him I thought he
might do better, as there was no engage∣ment
nor promise subsisting; that I did
not know what designs my uncle might
have formed for his advantage; but I
was of opinion, that he should not, at
present, run the risque of disobliging him
by any premature application of this
nature—Honest Humphry protested
he would suffer death sooner than do
or say any thing that should give
offence to the 'squire: but he owned he
had a kindness for the young woman, and
had reason to think she looked upon him
with a favourable eye; that he consider∣ed
this mutual manifestation of good will,
as an engagement understood, which
ought to be binding to the conscience of
an honest man; and he hoped the 'squire
<PB N="232" REF="232"/>
and I would be of the same opinion,
when we should be at leisure to bestow
any thought about the matter—I believe
he is in the right; and we shall find time
to take his case into consideration—You
see we are fixed for for some weeks at
least, and as you have had a long respite,
I hope you will begin immediately to
discharge the arrears due to</P>

<OPENER>To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at
Gloucester.
MY DEAR, DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>NEVER did I sit down to write in
such agitation as I now feel—In the course
of a few days, we have met with a num∣ber
of incidents so wonderful and interest∣ing,
that all my ideas are thrown into con∣fusion
and perplexity—You must not ex∣pect
either method or coherence in what
I am going to relate—my dearest Willis.
Since my last, the aspect of affairs is
totally changed!—and so changed!—but,
I would fain give you a regular detail—
In passing a river, about eight days ago,
our coach was overturned, and some of
us narrowly escaped with life—My uncle
had well nigh perished—O Heaven, I
cannot reflect upon that circumstance
without horror—I should have lost my best
friend, my father and protector, but for
the resolution and activity of his servant
Humphry Clinker, whom Providence
<PB N="234" REF="234"/>
really seems to have placed near him for
the necessity of this occasion.—I would
not be thought superstitious; but surely
he acted from a stronger impulse than
common fidelity—Was it not the voice
of nature that loudly called upon him to
save the life of his own father? for, O
Letty, it was discovered that Humphry
Clinker was my uncle's natural son.</P>
<P>Almost at the same instant, a gentle∣man,
who came to offer us his assistance,
and invite us to his house, turned out to
be a very old friend of Mr. Bramble—
His name is Mr. Dennison, one of the
worthiest men living; and his lady is a
perfect saint upon earth. They have an
only son—who do you think is this only
son?—O Letty!—O gracious heaven!
how my heart palpitates, when I tell you
that this only son of Mr. Dennison, is that
very identical youth who, under the name
of Wilson, has made such ravage in my
heart!—Yes, my dear friend! Wilson and
I are now lodged in the same house, and
converse together freely—His father ap∣proves
of his sentiments in my favour;
his mother loves me with all the tender∣ness
of a parent; my uncle, my aunt, and
my brother, no longer oppose my incli∣nations
—On the contrary, they have a∣greed
<PB N="235" REF="235"/>
to make us happy without delay;
and in three weeks or a month, if no
unforeseen accident intervenes, your friend
Lydia Melford, will have changed her
name and condition—I say, if <HI>no accident
intervenes,</HI> because such a torrent of suc∣cess
makes me tremble!—I wish there
may not be something treacherous in this
sudden reconciliation of fortune—I have
no merit—I have no title to such felicity?
Far from enjoying the prospect that lies be∣fore
me, my mind is harrassed with a con∣tinued
tumult, made up of hopes and
wishes, doubts and apprehensions—I can
neither eat nor sleep, and my spirits are
in perpetual flutter.—I more than ever
feel that vacancy in my heart, which your
presence alone can fill.—The mind, in
every disquiet, seeks to repose itself on
the bosom of a friend; and this is such a
trial as I really know not how to support
without your company and counsel—I
must therefore, dear Letty, put your
friendship to the test—I must beg you
will come and do the last offices of maiden∣hood
to your companion Lydia Mel∣ford.</P>
<P>This letter goes inclosed in one to our
worthy governess, from Mrs. Dennison, en∣treating
her to interpose with your mamma,
<PB N="236" REF="236"/>
that you may be allowed to favour us
with your company on this occasion; and
I flatter myself that no material objection
can be made to our request—The distance
from hence to Gloucester, does not exceed
one hundred miles, and the roads are
good.—Mr. Clinker, alias Loyd, shall be
sent over to attend your motions—If you
step into the post-chaise, with your maid
Betty Barker, at seven in the morning, you
will arrive by four in the afternoon at the
half-way house, where there is good ac∣commodation.
There you shall be met
by my brother and myself, who will next
day conduct you to this place, where, I
am sure, you will find yourself perfectly
at your ease in the midst of an agreeable
society.—Dear Letty, I will take no re∣fusal
—if you have any friendship—any
humanity—you will come.—I desire that
immediate application may be made to
your mamma; and that the moment
her permission is obtained, you will
apprise</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I was not so fortunate as
to be favoured with an answer to the
letter with which I troubled you in the
spring, I still flatter myself that you re∣tain
some regard for me and my con∣cerns.
I am sure the care and ten∣derness
with which I was treated, under
your roof and tuition, demand the warm∣est
returns of gratitude and affection on
my part, and these sentiments, I hope, I
shall cherish to my dying day—At present,
I think it my duty to make you acquaint∣ed
with the happy issue of that indiscre∣tion
by which I incurred your displeasure.
—Ah! madam, the slighted Wilson is
metamorphosed into George Dennison,
only son and heir of a gentleman, whose
character is second to none in England,
as you may understand upon inquiry.

My guardians, my brother and I, are
now in his house; and an immediate
union of the two families is to take place
in the persons of the young gentleman
and your poor Lydia Melford.—You will
easily conceive how embarrassing this si∣tuation
must be to a young inexperienced
creature like me, of weak nerves and
strong apprehensions; and how much the
presence of a friend and confidante would
encourage and support me on this occa∣sion.
You know, that of all the young
ladies, Miss Willis was she that possessed
the greatest share of my confidence and
affection; and, therefore, I fervently wish
to have the happiness of her company at
this interesting crisis.</P>
<P>Mrs. Dennison, who is the object of
universal love and esteem, has, at my re∣quest,
written to you on this subject▪ and
I now beg leave to reinforce her sollicita∣tion.
—My dear Mrs. Jermyn! my ever
honoured governess! let me conjure you
by that fondness which once distinguished
your favourite Liddy! by that benevo∣lence
of heart which disposes you to pro∣mote
the happiness of your fellow-crea∣tures

<OPENER>To Mrs. MARY JONES, at Bramble∣ton-hall.
O MARY JONES! MARY JONES!</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE met with so many axidents,
suprisals, and terrifications, that I am in
a parfeck fantigo, and believe I shall ne∣ver
be my own self again. Last week I
was dragged out of a river like a drown∣ed
rat, and lost a bran-new night-cap,
with a sulfur stay-hook, that cost me a
good half-a-crown, and an odd shoe of
green gallow monkey; besides wetting
my cloaths and taring my smuck, and an
ugly gash made in the back part of my
thy, by the stump of a tree—To be sure
Mr. Clinker tuck me out of the cox; but
he left me on my back in the water, to
go to the 'squire; and I mought have had
a watry grave, if a millar had not brought
me to the dry land—But, O! what
choppings and changes girl—The player
man that came after miss Liddy, and
frightened me with a beard at Bristol
<PB N="241" REF="241"/>
Well, is now matthew murphy'd into a fine
young gentleman, son and hare of 'squire
Dollison—We are all together in the same
house, and all parties have agreed to the
match, and in a fortnite the surrymony
will be preformed.</P>
<P>But this is not the only wedding we are
to have—Mistriss is resolved to have the
same frolick, in the naam of God! Last
Sunday in the parish crutch, if my own
ars may be trusted, the clerk called the
banes of marridge betwixt Opaniah Lash∣meheygo,
and Tapitha Brample, spi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster;
he mought as well have called her inkle∣weaver,
for she never spun and hank of
yarn in her life—Young 'squire Dolli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on
and miss Liddy make the second kipple;
and there might have been a turd, but
times are changed with Mr. Clinker—O,
Molly! what do'st think? Mr. Clinker
is found to be a pye-blow of our own
'squire, and his rite naam is Mr. Mattew
Loyd (thof God he nose how that can
be); and he is now out of livery, and
wares ruffles—but I new him when he was
out at elbows, and had not a rag to kive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his pistereroes; so he need not hold his
head so high—He is for sartain very um∣ble
and compleasant, and purtests as how
he has the same regard as before; but
<PB N="242" REF="242"/>
that he is no longer his own master, and
cannot portend to marry without the
'squire's consent—He says we must wait
with patience, and trust to Providence,
and such nonsense—But if so be as how
his regard be the same, why stand shilly
shally? Why not strike while the iron is
hot, and speak to the 'squire without loss
of time?—What subjection can the 'squire
make to our coming together?—Thof my
father wan't a gentleman, my mother was
an honest woman—I did'n't come on the
wrong side of the blanket, girl—My pa∣rents
were marred according to the rights
of holy mother crutch, in the face of men
and angles—Mark that, Mary Jones.</P>
<P>Mr. Clinker (Loyd I would say) had best
look to his tackle—There be other chaps
in the market, as the saying is—What
would he say if I should except the soot
and sarvice of the young 'squire's valley?
Mr. Machappy is a gentleman born, and
has been abroad in the wars—He has a
world of buck larning, and speaks
French, and Ditch, and Scotch, and all
manner of outlandish lingos; to be sure
he's a little the worse for the ware, and
is much given to drink; but then he's
good-tempered in his liquor, and a pru∣dent
woman mought wind him about her
<PB N="243" REF="243"/>
—But I have no thoughts of him, I'll
assure you—I scorn for to do, or to
say, or to think any thing that mought
give unbreech to Mr. Loyd, without
furder occasion—But then I have such
vapours, Molly—I sit and cry by myself,
and take ass of etida, and smill to burnt fa∣thers,
and kindal-snuffs; and I pray con∣stantly
for grease, that I may have a
glimpse of the new-light, to shew me the
way through this wretched veil of tares—
And yet, I want for nothing in this fa∣mily
of love, where every sole is so kind
and so courteous, that wan would think
they are so many saints in heaven. Dear

prayers, being, with my sarvice to Saul▪</P>

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot imagine what pleasure I
have in seeing your hand-writing, after
such a long cessation on your side of our
correspondence—Yet, Heaven knows, I
have often seen your hand-writing with
disgust—I mean, when it appeared in ab∣breviations
of apothecary's Latin—I like
your hint of making interest for the rever∣sion
of the collector's place, for Mr. Lis∣mahago,
who is much pleased with the
scheme, and presents you with his com∣pliments
and best thanks for thinking so
kind of his concerns—The man seems to
mend, upon further acquaintance. That
harsh reserve, which formed a disagree∣able
husk about his character, begins to
peel off in the course of our communica∣tion
—I have great hopes that he and
Tabby will be as happily paired as any
two draught animals in the kingdom;
<PB N="245" REF="245"/>
and I make no doubt but that he will
prove a valuable acquisition to our little
society, in the article of conversation, by
the fire-side in winter.</P>
<P>Your objection to my passing this season
of the year at such a distance from home,
would have more weight if I did not
find myself perfectly at my ease where I
am; and my health so much improved,
that I am disposed to bid defiance to gout
and rheumatism.—I begin to think I have
put myself on the superannuated list too
soon, and absurdly sought for health in
the retreats of laziness—I am persuaded
that all valetudinarians are too sedentary,
too regular, and too cautious—We
should sometimes increase the motion of
the machine, to <HI>unclog the wheels of life;</HI>
and now and then take a plunge amidst
the waves of excess, in order to case-har∣den
the constitution. I have even found
a change of company as necessary as a
change of air, to promote a vigorous cir∣culation
of the spirits, which is the very
essence and criterion of good health.</P>
<P>Since my last, I have been performing
the duties of friendship, that required a
great deal of exercise, from which I hope
to derive some benefit—Understanding,
by the greatest accident in the world, that
<PB N="246" REF="246"/>
Mr. Baynard's wife was dangerously ill of
a pleuritic fever, I borrowed Dennison's
post-chaise, and went a-cross the country
to his habitation, attended only by Loyd
(quondam Clinker) on horseback.—As the
distance is not above thirty miles, I ar∣rived
about four in the afternoon, and
meeting the physician at the door, was
informed that his patient had just expired.
—I was instantly seized with a violent e∣motion,
but it was not grief.—The fami∣ly
being in confusion, I ran up stairs into
the chamber, where, indeed, they were
all assembled—The aunt stood wringing
her hands in a kind of stupefaction of
sorrow, but my friend acted all the ex∣travagancies
of affliction—He held the
body in his arms, and poured forth such
a lamentation, that one would have
thought he had lost the most amiable con∣sort
and valuable companion upon earth.</P>
<P>Affection may certainly exist indepen∣dent
of esteem; nay, the same object may
be lovely in one respect, and detestable
in another—The mind has a surprising
faculty of accommodating, and even at∣taching
itself, in such a manner, by dint of
use, to things that are in their own nature
disagreeable, and even pernicious, that it
cannot bear to be delivered from them
<PB N="247" REF="247"/>
without reluctance and regret. Baynard
was so absorbed in his delirium, that he did
not perceive me when I entered, and de∣sired
one of the women to conduct the aunt
into her own chamber.—At the same time
I begged the tutor to withdraw the boy,
who stood gaping in a corner, very little
affected with the distress of the scene.—
These steps being taken, I w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited till the
first violence of my friend's transport was
abated, then disengaged him gently from
the melancholy object, and led him by the
hand into another apartment; though he
struggled so hard, that I was obliged to
have recourse to the assistance of his valet
de chambre.—In a few minutes, how∣ever,
he recollected himself, and folding
me in his arms, “This (cried he) is a
friendly office, indeed!—I know not
how you came hither; but, I think,
Heaven sent you to prevent my going
distracted.—O Matthew! I have lost
my dear Harriet!—my poor, gentle,
tender creature, that loved me with such
warmth and purity of affection—my
constant companion of twenty years!
—She's gone—she's gone for ever!—
Heaven and earth! where is she?—
Death shall not part us!”</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="248"/>
So saying, he started up, and could
hardly be with-held from returning to the
scene we had quitted—You will perceive
it would have been very absurd for me
to argue with a man that talked so madly.
—On all such occasions, the first torrent
of passion must be allowed to subside
gradually.—I endeavoured to beguile his
attention by starting little hints and insi∣nuating
other objects of discourse imper∣ceptibly;
and being exceedingly pleased
in my own mind at this event, I exerted
myself with such an extraordinary flow of
spirits as was attended with success.—
In a few hours, he was calm enough to
hear reason, and even to own that Hea∣ven
could not have interposed more effec∣tually
to rescue him from disgrace and
ruin.—That he might not, however, re∣lapse
into weaknesses for want of com∣pany,
I passed the night in his chamber,
in a little tent bed brought thither on pur∣pose;
and well it was I took this precau∣tion,
for he started up in bed several
times, and would have played the fool,
if I had not been present.</P>
<P>Next day he was in a condition to
talk of business, and vested me with
full authority over his houshold, which I
<PB N="249" REF="249"/>
began to exercise without loss of time,
tho' not before he knew and approved of
the scheme I had projected for his advan∣tage.
—He would have quitted the house
immediately; but this retreat I opposed.
—Far from encouraging a temporary
disgust, which might degenerate into an
habitual aversion, I resolved, if possible,
to attach him more than ever to his Hous∣hold
Gods.—I gave directions for the fu∣neral
to be as private as was consistent
with decency; I wrote to London, that
an inventory and estimate might be made
of the furniture and effects in his town-house,
and gave notice to the landlord,
that Mr. Baynard should quit the premi∣ses
at Lady-day; I set a person at work
to take account of every thing in the
country-house, including horses, carriages,
and harness; I settled the young gentle∣man
at a boarding-school, kept by a cler∣gyman
in the neighbourhood, and thither
he went without reluctance, as soon as he
knew that he was to be troubled no more
with his tutor, whom we dismissed.—The
aunt continued very sullen, and never ap∣peared
at table, though Mr. Baynard payed
his respects to her every day in her own
chamber; there also she held conferences
with the waiting-women and other ser∣vants
<PB N="250" REF="250"/>
of the family: but, the moment her
niece was interred, she went away in a post-chaise
prepared for that purpose: she did
not leave the house, however, without
giving Mr. Baynard to understand, that
the wardrobe of her niece was the perqui∣site
of her woman; accordingly that
worthless dr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b received all the clothes,
laces, and linen of her deceased mistress,
to the value of five hundred pounds, at a
moderate computation.</P>
<P>The next step I took was to disband
that legion of supernumerary domestics,
who had preyed so long upon the vitals
of my friend: a parcel of idle drones,
so intolerably insolent, that they even
treated their own master with the most
contemptuous neglect. They had been
generally hired by his wife, according to
the recommendation of her woman, and
these were the only patrons to whom they
payed the least deference. I had there∣fore
uncommon satisfaction in clearing the
house of those vermin. The woman of
the deceased, and a chambermaid, a valet
de chambre, a butler, a French cook, a
master gardner, two footmen, and a coach∣man,
I payed off, and turned out of the
house immediately, paying to each a
month's wages in lieu of warning. Those
<PB N="251" REF="251"/>
whom I retained, consisted of a female
cook, who had been assistant to the French∣man,
a house maid, an old lacquey, a
postilion, and under-gardener. Thus I
removed at once a huge mountain of ex∣pence
and care from the shoulders of my
friend, who could hardly believe the evi∣dence
of his own senses, when he found
himself so suddenly and so effectually re∣lieved.
His heart, however, was still
subject to vibrations of tenderness,
which returned at certain intervals, ex∣torting
sighs, and tears, and exclamations
of grief and impatience: but these fits
grew every day less violent and less fre∣quent,
'till at length his reason obtained
a complete victory over the infirmities of
his nature.</P>
<P>Upon an accurate inquiry into the state
of his affairs, I find his debts amount to
twenty thousand pounds, for eighteen
thousand pounds of which sum his estate
is mortgaged; and as he pays five per
cent. interest, and some of his farms are
unoccupied, he does not receive above
two hundred pounds a year clear from his
lands, over and above the interest of his
wife's fortune, which produced eight hun∣dred
pounds annually. For lightening
this heavy burthen, I devised the follow∣ing
<PB N="252" REF="252"/>
expedient.—His wife's jewels, toge∣ther
with his superfluous plate and furni∣ture
in both houses, his horses and carri∣ages,
which are already advertised to be
sold by auction, will, according to the es∣timate,
produce two thousand five hun∣dred
pounds in ready money, with which
the debt will be immediately reduced to
eighteen thousand pounds—I have under∣taken
to find him ten thousand pounds at
four per cent. by which means he will
save one hundred a-year in the article of
interest, and perhaps we shall be able to
borrow the other eight thousand on the
same terms. According to his own scheme
of a country life, he says he can live com∣fortably
for three hundred pounds a year;
but, as he has a son to educate, we will
allow him five hundred; then there will
be an accumulating fund of seven hun∣dred
a-year, principal and interest, to pay
off the incumbrance; and, I think, we
may modestly add three hundred, on the
presumption of new-leasing and improv∣ing
the vacant farms: so that, in a couple
of years, I suppose there will be above a
thousand a-year appropriated to liquidate
a debt of sixteen thousand.</P>
<P>We forthwith began to class and set
apart the articles designed for sale, under
<PB N="253" REF="253"/>
the direction of an upholder from Lon∣don;
and, that nobody in the house might
be idle, commenced our reformation with∣out
doors, as well as within. With Bay∣nard's
good leave, I ordered the gardener
to turn the rivulet into its old channel,
to refresh the fainting Naiads, who had so
long languished among mouldring roots,
withered leaves, and dry pebbles.—The
shrubbery is condemned to extirpation;
and the pleasure-ground will be restored
to its original use of corn-field and pas∣ture.
—Orders are given for rebuilding the
walls of the garden at the back of the
house, and for planting clumps of firs, in∣termingled
with beech and chesnut, at the
east end, which is now quite exposed to
the surly blasts that come from that quar∣ter.
All these works being actually be∣gun,
and the house and auction left to
the care and management of a reputable
attorney, I brought Baynard along with
me in the chaise, and made him acquaint∣ed
with Dennison, whose goodness of heart
would not fail to engage his esteem and
affection.—He is indeed charmed with
our society in general, and declares that
he never saw the theory of true pleasure
reduced to practice before.—I really be∣lieve
it would not be an easy task to find
<PB N="254" REF="254"/>
such a number of individuals assembled
under one roof, more happy than we are
at present.</P>
<P>I must tell you, however, in confidence,
I suspect Tabby of tergiversation.—I have
been so long accustomed to that original,
that I know all the caprices of her heart,
and can often perceive her designs while
they are yet in embrio—She attached her∣self
to Lismahago for no other reason
but that she despaired of making a more
agreeable conquest.—At present, if I am
not much mistaken in my observation, she
would gladly convert the widowhood of
Baynard to her own advantage.—Since he
arrived, she has behaved very coldly to
the captain, and strove to fasten on the
other's heart, with the hooks of over∣strained
civility.—These must be the in∣stinctive
efforts of her constitution, rather
than the effects of any deliberate design;
for matters are carried to such a length
with the lieutenant, that she could not re∣tract
with any regard to conscience or re∣putation.
Besides, she will meet with
nothing but indifference or aversion on the
side of Baynard, who has too much sense
to think of such a partner at any time,
and too much delicacy to admit a thought
of any such connexion at the present junc∣ture
<PB N="255" REF="255"/>
—Meanwhile, I have prevailed upon
her to let him have four thousand pounds
at four per cent. towards paying off his
mortgage. Young Dennison has agreed
that Liddy's fortune shall be appropriat∣ed
to the same purpose, on the same terms.
—His father will sell out three thousand
pounds stock for his accommodation.—
Farmer Bland has, at the desire of Wil∣son,
undertaken for two thousand; and I
must make an effort to advance what fur∣ther
will be required to take my friend
out of the hands of the Philistines. He
is so pleased with the improvements made
on this estate, which is all cultivated like
a garden, that he has entered himself as a
pupil in farming to Mr. Dennison, and re∣solved
to attach himself wholly to the prac∣tice
of husbandry.</P>
<P>Every thing is now prepared for our
double wedding. The marriage-articles
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or both couples are drawn and executed;
and the ceremony only waits until the
parties shall have been resident in the
parish the term prescribed by law. Young
Dennison betrays some symptoms of im∣patience;
but, Lismahago bears this
necessary delay with the temper of a phi∣losopher.
—You must know, the captain
does not stand altogether on the founda∣tion
<PB N="256" REF="256"/>
of personal merit. Besides his half-pay,
amounting to two and forty pounds
a year, this indefatigable oeconomist has
amassed eight hundred pounds, which he
has secured in the funds. This sum arises
partly from his pay's running up while
he remained among the Indians; partly
from what he received as a consideration
for the difference between his full ap∣pointment
and the half-pay, to which he
is now restricted; and partly from the
profits of a little traffic he drove in pel∣try,
during his sachemship among the
Miamis.</P>
<P>Liddy's fears and perplexities have
been much assuaged by the company of
one Miss Willis, who had been her inti∣mate
companion at the boarding-school.
Her parents had been earnestly sollicited
to allow her making this friendly visit on
such an extraordinary occasion; and two
days ago she arrived with her mother,
who did not chuse that she should come
without a proper gouvernante. The young
lady is very sprightly, handsome, and a∣greeable,
and the mother a mighty good
sort of a woman; so that their coming
adds considerably to our enjoyment. But
we shall have a third couple yoked in the
matrimonial chain. Mr. Clinker Loyd
<PB N="257" REF="257"/>
has made humble remonstrance, through
the canal of my nephew, setting forth the
sincere love and affection mutually sub∣sisting
between him and Mrs. Winifred
Jenkins, and praying my consent to their
coming together for life. I would have
wished that Mr. Clinker had kept out of
this scrape; but as the nymph's happiness
is at stake, and she has had already some
fits in the way of despondence, I, in order
to prevent any tragical catastrophe, have
given him leave to play the fool, in imi∣tation
of his betters; and I suppose we
shall in time have a whole litter of his
progeny at Brambleton-hall. The fel∣low
is stout and lusty, very sober and
conscientious; and the wench seems to
be as great an enthusiast in love as in re∣ligion.</P>
<P>I wish you would think of employing
him some other way, that the parish may
not be overstocked—you know he has
been bred a farrier, consequently belongs
to the faculty; and as he is very docile,
I make no doubt but, with your good in∣struction,
he may be, in a little time,
qualified to act as a Welsh apothecary.
Tabby, who never did a favour with a
good grace, has consented, with great re∣luctance,
to this match. Perhaps it hurts
<PB N="258" REF="258"/>
her pride, as she now considers Clinker
in the light of a relation; but, I believe,
her objections are of a more selfish na∣ture.
She declares she cannot think of
retaining the wife of Matthew Loyd in
the character of a servant; and she fore∣sees,
that on such an occasion the woman
will expect some gratification for her past
services. As for Clinker, exclusive of
other considerations, he is so trusty, brave,
affectionate, and alert, and I owe him such
personal obligations, that he merits more
than all the indulgence that can possibly
be shewn him, by</P>

<PB N="259" REF="259"/>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. at
Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>THE fatal knots are now tied. The
comedy is near a close; and the curtain
is ready to drop: but, the latter scenes
of this act I shall recapitulate in order.—
About a fortnight ago, my uncle made
an excursion across the country, and
brought hither a particular friend, one
Mr. Baynard, who has just lost his wife,
and was for some time disconsolate, though
by all accounts he had much more cause
for joy than for sorrow at this event.—
His countenance, however, clears up a∣pace;
and he appears to be a person of
rare accomplishments.—But, we have re∣ceived
another still more agreeable rein∣forcement
to our company, by the arrival
of Miss Willis from Glocester. She was
Liddy's bosom friend at boarding¦school,
and being earnestly sollicited to assist at
the nuptials, her mother was so obliging as
<PB N="260" REF="260"/>
to grant my sister's request, and even to
come with her in person. Liddy, accom∣panied
by George Dennison and me, gave
them the meeting half-way, and next day
conducted them hither in safety. Miss
Willis is a charming girl, and, in point of
disposition, an agreeable contrast to my
sister, who is rather too grave and senti∣mental
for my turn of mind.—The other
is gay, frank, a little giddy, and always
good-humoured. She has, moreover, a
genteel fortune, is well born, and remark∣ably
handsome.—Ah Phillips! if these
qualities were permanent—if her humour
would never change, nor her bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies de∣cay,
what efforts would I not make—But
these are idle reflections—my destiny must
one day be fulfilled.</P>
<P>At present we pass the time as agree∣ably
as we can.—We have got up several
farces, which afforded unspeakable enter∣tainment
by the effects they produced
among the country people, who are ad∣mitted
to all our exhibitions.—Two nights
ago, Jack Wilson acquired great applause
in Harlequin Skeleton, and Lismahago
surprized us all in the character of Pierot.
—His long lank sides, and strong marked
features, were all peculiarly adapted to his
part.—He appeared with a ludicrous
<PB N="261" REF="261"/>
stare, from which he had discharged all
meaning: he adopted the impressions of
fear and amazement so naturally, that
many of the audience were infected by
his looks; but when the skeleton held
him in chace his horror became most di∣vertingly
picturesque, and seemed to en∣dow
him with such praeternatural agility
as confounded all the spectators. It was
a lively representation of Death in pursuit
of Consumption, and had such an effect
upon the commonalty, that some of them
shrieked aloud, and others ran out of the
hall in the utmost consternation.</P>
<P>This is not the only instance in which
the lieutenant has lately excited our won∣der.
His temper, which had been soured
and shrivelled by disappointment and
chagrin, is now swelled out, and smoothed
like a raisin in plum-porridge. From
being reserved and punctilious, he is
become easy and obliging. He cracks
jokes, laughs and banters, with the most
facetious familiarity; and, in a word, en∣ters
into all our schemes of merriment
and pastime—The other day his baggage
arrived in the waggon from London, con∣tained
in two large trunks and a long
deal box not unlike a coffin. The trunks
were filled with his wardrobe, which he
<PB N="262" REF="262"/>
displayed for the entertainment of the
company, and he freely owned, that it
consisted chiefly of the <HI>opima spolia</HI> taken
in battle. What he selected for his wed∣ding
suit, was a tarnished white cloth
faced with blue velvet, embroidered with
silver; but, he valued himself most upon
a tye-periwig, in which he had made his
first appearance as a lawyer above thirty
years ago. This machine had been in
buckle ever since, and now all the servants
in the family were employed to frizz it
out for the occasion, which was yesterday
celebrated at the parish church. George
Dennison and his bride were distinguished
by nothing extraordinary in their apparel.
His eyes lightened with eagerness and
joy, and she trembled with coyness and
confusion. My uncle gave her away, and
her friend Willis supported her during
the ceremony.</P>
<P>But my aunt and her paramour took
the pas, and formed, indeed, such a pair
of originals, as, I believe, all England
could not parallel. She was dressed in
the stile of 1739; and the day being cold,
put on a manteel of green velvet laced
with gold: but this was taken off by the
bridegroom, who threw over her shoulders
a fur cloak of American sables, valued at
<PB N="263" REF="263"/>
fourscore guineas, a present equally agree∣able
and unexpected. Thus accoutred,
she was led up to the altar by Mr. Den∣nison,
who did the office of her father:
Lismahago advanced in the military step
with his French coat reaching no farther
than the middle of his thigh, his cam∣paign
wig that surpasses all description,
and a languishing leer upon his counte∣nance,
in which there seemed to be some∣thing
arch and ironical. The ring, which
he put upon her finger, he had concealed
till the moment it was used. He now
produced it with an air of self-compla∣cency.
It was a curious antique, set
with rose diamonds: he told us after∣wards,
it had been in his family two
hundred years, and was a present from his
grand-mother. These circumstances a∣greeably
flattered the pride of our aunt
Tabitha, which had already f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und un∣common
gratification in the captain's ge∣nerosity;
for he had, in the morning,
presented my uncle with a fine bear's skin,
and a Spanish fowling-piece, and me with
a case of pistols curiously mounted with
silver. At the same time he gave Mrs.
Jenkins an Indian purse, made of silk
grass, containing twenty crown pieces.
You must know, this young lady, with
<PB N="264" REF="264"/>
the assistance of Mr. Loyd, formed the
third couple who yesterday sacrificed to
Hymen. I wrote to you in my last, that
he had recourse to my m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diation, which I
employed successfully with my uncle;
but Mrs. Tabitha held out 'till the love-sick
Jenkins had two fits of the mother;
then she relented, and those two cooing
turtles were caged for life—Our aunt
made an effort of generosity in furnishing
the bride with her superfluities of clothes
and linen, and her example was followed
by my sister; nor did Mr. Bramble and
I neglect her on this occasion. It was, in∣deed,
a day of peace-offering—Mr. Den∣nison
insisted upon Liddy's accepting two
bank notes of one hundred pounds each,
as pocket-money; and his lady gave her
a diamond necklace of double that value.
There was, besides, a mutual exchange of
tokens among the individuals of the two
families thus happily united.</P>
<P>As George Dennison and his partner
were judged improper objects of mirth,
Jack Wilson had resolved to execute some
jokes on Lismahago, and after supper be∣gan
to ply him with bumpers, when the la∣dies
had retired; but the captain perceiving
his drift, begged for quarter, alledging
that the adventure, in which he had en∣gaged,
<PB N="265" REF="265"/>
was a very serious matter; and
that it would be more the part of a good
Christian to pray that he might be streng∣thened,
than to impede his endeavours
to finish the adventure.—He was spared
accordingly, and permitted to ascend the
nuptial couch with all his senses about
him.—There he and his consort sat in
state, like Saturn and Cybele, while the
benediction-posset was drank; and a cake
being broken over the head of Mrs. Ta∣bitha
Lismahago, the fragments were dis∣tributed
among the bystanders, according
to the custom of the antient Britons, on
the supposition that every person who are
of this hallowed cake, should that night
have a vision of the man or woman whom
Heaven designed should be his or her
wedded mate.</P>
<P>The weight of Wilson's waggery fell
upon honest Humphry and his spouse,
who were bedded in an upper room, with
the usual ceremony of throwing the stock∣ing.
—This being performed, and the
company withdrawn, a sort of catter∣wauling
ensued, when Jack found means
to introduce a real cat shod with walnut-shells,
which galloping along the boards,
made such a dreadful noise as effectually
<PB N="266" REF="266"/>
discomposed our lovers.—Winifred
screamed aloud, and shrunk under the
bed-cloaths.—Mr. Loyd, believing that
Satan was come to buffet him <HI>in propria
persona,</HI> laid aside all carnal thoughts, and
began to pray aloud with great fervency.
—At length, the poor animal, being more
afraid than either, leaped into the bed,
and meauled with the most piteous excla∣mation.
—Loyd, thus informed of the na∣ture
of the annoyance, rose and set the
door wide open, so that this troublesome
visitant retreated with great expedition;
then securing himself, by means of a dou∣ble
bolt, from a second intrusion, he was
left to enjoy his good fortune without fur∣ther
disturbance.</P>
<P>If one may judge from the looks of the
parties, they are all very well satisfied with
what has passed.—George Dennison and
his wife are too delicate to exhibit any
strong-marked signs of their mutual satis∣faction,
but their eyes are sufficiently ex∣pressive.
—Mrs. Tabitha Lismahago is ra∣ther
fulsome in signifying her approbation
of the captain's love; while his deport∣ment
is the very pink of gallantry.—He
sighs, and ogles, and languishes at this
amiable object; he kisses her hand, mut∣ters
<PB N="267" REF="267"/>
ejaculations of rapture, and sings ten∣der
airs; and, no doubt, laughs internal∣ly
at her folly in believing him sincere.—
In order to shew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>how little his vigour was
impaired by the fatigues of the preceding
day, he this morning danced a Highland
sarabrand over a naked back-sword, and
leaped so high, that I believe he would
make no contemptible figure as a vaulter
at Sadler's Wells.—Mr. Matthew Loyd,
when asked how he relishes his bargain,
throws up his eyes, crying, “For what
we have received, Lord make us thank∣ful:
amen.”—His helpmate giggles,
and holds her hand before her eyes, af∣fecting
to be ashamed of having been in
bed with a man.—Thus all these widgeons
enjoy the novelty of their situation; but,
perhaps their note will be changed, when
they are better acquainted with the nature
of the decoy.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Willis cannot be persuaded to
stay, and Liddy is engaged by promise to
accompany her daughter back to Glou∣cester,
I fancy there will be a general mi∣gration
from hence, and that most of us
will spend the Christmas holidays at Bath;
in which case, I shall certainly find an op∣portunity
to beat up your quarters—By

<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>MY niece Liddy is now happily settled
for life; and captain Lismahago has taken
Tabby off my hands; so that I have no∣thing
further to do, but to comfort my
friend Baynard, and provide for my son
Loyd, who is also fairly joined to Mrs.
Winifred Jenkins.—You are an excellent
genius at hints.—Dr. Arbuthnot was but
a type of Dr. Lewis in that respect.—
What you observe of the vestry-clerk
<PB N="269" REF="269"/>
deserves consideration.—I make no doubt
but Matthew Loyd is well enough quali∣fied
for the office; but, at present, you
must find room for him in the house.—
His incorruptible honesty and indefati∣gable
care will be serviceable in superin∣tending
the oeconomy of my farm; tho' I
don't mean that he shall interfere with
Barns, of whom I have no cause to complain.
—I am just returned with Baynard, from a
second trip to his house, where every thing
is regulated to his satisfaction.—He could
not, however, review the apartments
without tears and lamentation, so that
he is not yet in a condition to be left
alone; therefore I will not part with him till
the spring▪ when he intends to plunge in∣to
the avocations of husbandry, which
will at once employ and amuse his atten∣tion.
—Charles Dennison has promised to
stay with him a fortnight, to set him
fairly afloat in his improvements; and
Jack Wilson will see him from time to
time; besides, he has a few friends in the
country, whom his new plan of life will
not exclude from his society.—In less than
a year, I make no doubt, but he will find
himself per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ectly at ease both in his mind and
body, for the one had dangerously affect∣ed
<PB N="270" REF="270"/>
the other; and I shall enjoy the exqui∣site
pleasure of seeing my friend rescued
from misery and contempt.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis being determined to return
with her daughter, in a few days, to Glou∣cester,
our plan has undergone some al∣teration.
—Jery has persuaded his brother-in-law
to carry his wife to Bath; and I
believe his parents will accompany him
thither.—For my part, I have no inten∣tion
to take that route.—It must be some∣thing
very extraordinary that will induce
me to revisit either Bath or London.—
My sister and her husband, Baynard and
I, will take leave of them at Gloucester,
and make the best of our way to Bramble∣ton-hall,
where I desire you will prepare
a good chine and turkey for our Christmas
dinner.—You must also employ your
medical skill in defending me from the
attacks of the gout, that I may be in good
case to receive the rest of our company,
who promise to visit us in their return
from the Bath.—As I have laid in a
considerable stock of health, it is to be
hoped you will not have much trouble
with me in the way of physic, but I in∣tend
to work you on the side of exercise.
—I have got an excellent fowling-piece
<PB N="271" REF="271"/>
from Mr. Lismahago, who is a keen
sportsman, and we shall take the heath in
all weathers.—That this scheme of life may
be prosecuted the more effectually, I in∣tend
to renounce all sedentary amusements,
particularly that of writing long letters;
a resolution, which, had I taken it sooner,
might have saved you the trouble which
you have lately taken in reading the te∣dious

My spouse, the captain, being subject to

<P>PROVIDINCH hath bin pleased to
make great halteration in the pasture of
our affairs.—We were yesterday three
kiple chined, by the grease of God, in the
holy bands of mattermoney, and I now
subscrive myself Loyd at your sarvice.—
All the parish allowed that young 'squire
Dallison and his bride was a comely pear
for to see.—As for madam Lashmiheygo,
you nose her picklearities—her head, to be
sure, was fintastical; and her spouse had

<PB N="274" REF="274"/>
from the land of the selvidges, thof they
say it it is of immense bally.—The captain
himself had a huge hassock of air, with
three tails, and a tumtawdry coat, bod∣dered
with sulfur.—Wan said he was a
monkey-bank; and the ould bottler swore
he was the born imich of Titidall.—
For my part, I says nothing, being as how
the captain has done the handsome thing
by me.—Mr. Loyd was dressed in a lite
frog, and checket with gould binding;
and thof he don't enter in caparison with
great folks of quality, yet he has got as
good blood in his veins as arrow privet
'squire in the county; and then his
pursing is far from contentible.—Your

tabby sack, with my Runnela cap, ruff
toupee, and side curls.—They said, I
was the very moral of lady Rickmanstone,
