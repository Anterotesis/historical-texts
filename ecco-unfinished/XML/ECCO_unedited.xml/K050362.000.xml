<HEAD><HI>UNION</HI> AND No UNION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> are united by an establish'd Constitution, and formed both into One Body, now called the Kingdom of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> which Constitution is called the UNION; this is well enough known. But that there is Union little enough a∣mong us, as well about the Establish∣ment of that Constitution it self, as a∣bout the Observing or not Observing the Articles made between us, is the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
great Misfortune of Both Nations. I believe I may say without giving any one offence, that a Firmer Union of Policy with Less Union of Affection, has hardly been known in the whole World. Nay it will not, I believe, be offer'd or suggested, that there is any Visible Increase of Good Will, Chari∣ty, or Love of Neighbourhood, be∣tween the Nations, since the finishing the Transaction of the late Treaty of Union. I am very sorry to note a Truth so little to our Consolation.</P>
<P>It would be too Inviduous a Task to enter into a Particular Account of the Reasons which might be given for these Divisions, and this Decay of Affection between the Two Nations, since the late <HI>Ʋnion;</HI> most of them may be re∣duc'd to these three.</P>
<LG>
<L>Matters of Religion; between <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and Episcopal.</L>
<L>Matters of State; between <HI>Jacobite</HI> and <HI>Ha∣nover</HI> Succession.</L>
<L>Matters of Property; about Taxing and not Taxing, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>Of all these it seems necessary to give some Account, that indifferent People
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
may judge whether these Breaches are sufficiently grounded, whether there are any probable Methods to be propo∣sed for a Cure, and how far the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> may or may not be said to be broken and dissolved thereby: From the Result of which also, the Conduct of some Gentlemen in their late Publick Resent∣ment of things relating to <HI>Seotland,</HI> may be approv'd or condemn'd.</P>
<P>FIRST. <HI>Matters of Religion; between</HI> Presbyterian <HI>and Episcopal.</HI> The Breach here seems to lye thus; The <HI>Presbyteri∣ans</HI> having capitulated in the Treaty of Union for the Security of their Church, and for the preserving all its Pri∣vileges; both as to Discipline and Government, and the Uniformity also as to Doctrine and Worship; expected perhaps from thence that no Encourage∣ment, Countenance, or Protection, much less Toleration, should be given to the Episcopal, (called there) the Prelatic Party; and therefore these, when the Act for tollerating the Episcopal Meetings was pass'd; an Act for restoring the <HI>Yule</HI> Vacance; and another to restore the Right of Patrons to Presentation of Mi∣nisters to vacant Benefices, &amp;c. These I
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
say, cry out loudly, <HI>The Ʋnion was Bro∣ken.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Episcopal or Prelatick Party, finding, Her Maje∣sty her self (being Educated in the same Opinion) very Tender of them; the Church of <HI>England</HI> in Charity Embra∣cing and Espousing them; and the Times <HI>as they supposed</HI> Favouring them <HI>further than before,</HI> failed not to push on their Interest, to press for their Liberty, and Unhappily to lay their Hopes up∣on that exploded Article, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Dispensing Power of the Queen; promp∣ting several things in their own Favour Inconsistent not with the Articles on∣ly, but with the Constitution of <HI>Britain,</HI> which if they could obtain, they would be the first to boast of as an Infraction both of the Revolution and also of the Union; that so they might look on the Union to be really Dissolv'd in its own Nature, and that one Breach being made might justify ma∣king another: And so on to a Rupture, which without wronging them it may be said, they above all things Passi∣onately Desire, and therefore we find no People more forward to say the Union is already broken, tho' the ve∣ry
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
things which they will own to be Breaches of the Union were done in their Favour.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Second Head consists of State Matters, or the Affair of the Succession; <HI>between the Pretender and the House of Hanover,</HI> in these Affairs the Presbyterians tho' not at all in the Jacobite Interest, yet openly many of them refuse to take the Abjuration, and when the same is Enforced and Imposed upon them under severe Pe∣nalties and Forfeitures, they loudly Complain of that Law as <HI>a Breach of the Ʋnion,</HI> which Union they say (and that very truely) stipulated, that <HI>no Oaths should be Imposed upon them Con∣trary to their Principles,</HI> and this Oath, they say, is against their Principles, as it obliges them Voluntarily to forswear and abjure a Presbyterian King <HI>as such;</HI> tho' otherwise his Descent and Birth gave him an Unquestioned Ti∣tle to the Crown, therefore they say, <HI>The Ʋnion is Broken and Dissolved.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party bringing first all their treasonable Argu∣ments to assert the <HI>Just Claim</HI> (as they call it) of the <HI>Pretender</HI> to the Crown;
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
affirm that such Right is hereditary and indefeasible, and that no Humane Po∣wer can legally supersede that Claim. The <HI>Ʋnion</HI> therefore having dissolv'd the Constitution, and set aside the <HI>Law∣ful Heir, as they would have him be called,</HI> is an unrighteous Act, contrary to the Laws of God, and the Nature of the thing, and is therefore void in its own Nature, dissolves it self, and cannot sub∣sist in barr of his Right, which derives, as they alledge, from God alone. This causes them to join in the aforesaid Complaint, That <HI>the Ʋnion is broken and dissolved.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Third Head is, <HI>Matters of Property,</HI> such as Trade, Taxes, Customs, Duties, &amp;c. and this brings us directly to the Case in Hand, in which, upon the Parliament Voting the Malt Tax to be paid by all the Subjects of <HI>Great Bri∣tain;</HI> a New, and none of the softest Cries is raised in the Dialect of the Former <HI>(viz.)</HI> That <HI>the Ʋnion is Bro∣ken.</HI></P>
<P>I am heartily Sorry to see, and more to mention the Heat with which these things are managed; <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<HI>mean without Doors,</HI> for I enter my Protest here as early as possible, that <HI>nothing said here be Construed to be meant of any thing done or transacted in ei∣ther House of Parliament, or to reflect upon any Members of either House for any thing done in Parliament.</HI> But this I take for a Rule that may be followed, if any Man (tho' a Member of Parliament of either House) does say or act any thing out of his Parliamentary Capa∣city out of the House and not as a Member, he is then <HI>as to that Action,</HI> to be Considered not as a Member of Parliament, but as a British Subject in Common with his Neighbours, and such Action of his may be Dis∣coursed of equally with the Actions of other Men; for Example, if a Member of Parliament commit a Murther, a Robery, or any other Crime, suppose he Insults a Woman, a Man's Wife, a Magistrate, or a Sovereign! As the Law shall without doubt freely take its ordinary Course to preserve the Life, Property, Cha∣stity, and Safety of the Subject with the Peace and Prerogative of the Go∣vernment and Sovereign, it shall no doubt bring such an Offender to Ju∣stice,
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
notwithstanding his Character as a Member, and as it will be no Breach of Privilege to have such Offences Prosecuted, so neither would it be to Censure those Offences in Print or Writing, I hope I am not mistaken in this Case, and yet if I am, I shall take care not to come within reach of the contrary: Well however: On this Ac∣count, <HI>I say,</HI> I am sorry to see the Heat with which some People on both sides carry on the present Contention about this Affair of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I will speak of it as Cautiously and Respectively as I can.</P>
<P>I must confess the Taxing <HI>Scotland</HI> seems a nice thing, for tho' it is True that it was left entirely <HI>in the Treaty of Ʋnion</HI> to the Determination of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> so far as re∣lates to such Taxes as are Exempted in the said Treaty of Union. <HI>So yet,</HI> there is an Expression in the Treaty first made at <HI>London,</HI> which tho' it does not limit the said Parliament, yet it seems to lay down a Rule which is recommended to the Par∣liament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> (that should succeed) by the respective Parliament of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
then in being and to Expire, I say, recommended to the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to have their Eyes upon▪ as much as they thought reasonable, in their future Proceedings about Charging <HI>Scotland</HI> with Taxes. This Expression is thus;</P>
<P><Q>“”That the Parliament of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> could not be supposed to lay any sorts of Burdens upon the United King∣doms, but what they shall find of Necessity at that Time for the Preser∣vation and Good of the Whole, and with due Regard to the Circumstances and Abilities of every Part of the Uni∣ted Kingdom: Therefore it is agreed, that there be no further Exemption insisted upon for any Part of the Uni∣ted Kingdoms, but that the Consi∣deration of any Exemptions beyond what are already agreed on in this Treaty, shall be left to the Determi∣nation of the Parliament of <HI>Great Bri∣tain.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I take this to be something like the Exhortations of an Aged and Tender Parent, or Parents on their Death Bed to their Son, who was upon the Point of taking a Wife; the Good Man tells his Son the particular Duties of his
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
future Condition, as a Master of a Fa∣mily, and as a Father to his Children; and particularly tells him perhaps, the Circumstances of his Wife; what Re∣spect is due to her for the sake of the Family he has taken her from: How Tenderly he should Treat her; how he should bear with her want of Temper, with her want of Fortune; and especially, that he should never upbraid her with her Mean Circum∣stances, or lessen her Jointure for want of her Fortune and the like; then just lives to see them Married and Ex∣pires.</P>
<P>Now it is True, the Son is not, in the Legal Constitution of Husband and Wife bound by these Exhortations, nor can he be said at-all to break his Marriage Covenant if he does not follow the Advice of his Father, or use his Wife so kindly as his Father Exhorted him to do; because the Woman takes him upon the express Terms of a Marriage, <HI>for Better for Worse,</HI> yet hardly any Man but will cause the Remembrance of his Dying Father's Exhortations and Recom∣mendations to Influence his Conduct very much; and if he be a Kind and
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
Tender Husband, <HI>It can hardly be sup∣posed he will lay any burthen upon his Wife but what he shall find of Necessity at that time for the preservation and Good of his Family, and with due Regard to her Circumstances and Abilities.</HI></P>
<P>This I take to be something like the Case here, and therefore, that what ever Unkindnesses or Misunderstan∣dings may thus pass on either fide be∣tween the Marryed Couple, <HI>i. e. The Two Nations,</HI> yet that this can by no means be called a Breach of the Mar∣riage Contract: Nor can either side Claim thereby, that the Marriage or Union should be Dissolved, which in∣deed by the Nature of the Bargain cannot be done, no not by the mutual Consent of the Parties Marryed or United.</P>
<P>I might carry this Simily much further, but this Case admits not to be spoken of in Parables; we are now come to such a height in the misun∣derstanding of one another, that he who will speak of the thing to the Purpose, must speak of it in the plain Language, which the People he speaks to make use of in it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"/>
The Occasions of the Nation re∣quire, that the Malt Tax as it is ge∣nerally called, should be laid on by the Parliament for the Year 1713, and accordingly a Bill has pass'd the House of Commons (as <HI>per</HI> their Votes) for laying the usual Duty of 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Quarter, or 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Bushell upon Malt, Commencing the 24th of <HI>June</HI> next, by which Bill as we are told by the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen who are without Doors, the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> are charged with the said Duties which they never were before, having been Exempted from it by the Articles of the Union.</P>
<P>What has been said for or against this Bill in the House of Commons while it was in Debate there, this I may not speak of here. But I find the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen, I say, who are in Town, and not in the House, in a Fer∣ment hardly to be described about it, and from them it runs thro' all the Town, and is now in every Bodies Mouth, thus or in Words to this pur∣pose.</P>
<P>That <HI>Scotland</HI> is Ruined, that the Tax is an Intollerable Burthen, that they are not Treated in it with Ju∣stice and in an Equality, which was
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
in all other Taxes laid down, as the stated Method of Taxing <HI>Scotland</HI> at the time of the Union; that they were told, that in all Taxings the Circum∣stances and Abillity of <HI>Scotland</HI> to bear the Taxes which were to be Imposed should be Considered, and that this is expresly mentioned as the reason which induced the <HI>Scots</HI> in the Treaty of Union to submit the matter of future Taxings to the Wisdom of a British Parliament, who it could not be supposed would lay any sort of Burthens upon the United Kingdom, but with due Regard to the said Cir∣cumstances, and to the Abillity of e∣very Part of the said Kingdom to bear the same.</P>
<P>Others carrying their Dissatisfaction higher, forgetting Decency, and the Respect due, not to the Parliament only, but to the whole Government also, talk with a Freedom not fit to be repeated <HI>(viz.)</HI> Of the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> being broken, the Contract void, and that they will go to the Queen, and laying their Reasons be∣fore Her Majesty, humbly desire her to declare the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> dissolved, and to re∣mit the Nations back to their respective separate State and Independency one on another.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16"/>
Whether any one has gone of this Er∣rand or no, or will go, is not the Sub∣ject of my Speculation at this time; but it may come under Enquiry, and such People would do well to consi∣der before they proceed to such an ex∣traordinary Step as that—Whether they are not assured before they offer such a thing to the Queen, that it is what her Majesty can do; and then what they may be said to be guilty of, who go to any Person to ask a thing, which they know before they go, the Person they go to cannot grant.</P>
<P>In most Cases that I could name, such a thing would be call'd bantering the Person, in some Cases it would be called insulting; what it may be called in this Case is not fit for me to determine, Her Majesty will not be at a Loss what Opinion to pass upon it.</P>
<P>In the mean time I must acknowledge I meet with none, no not one Man of Sense and of Moderation, but what condemns and censures the Action as wanting in Respect, in Prudence and in Policy; and it may be hoped such a general Dislike will influence the Gentlemen not to think of taking such a Step; if any have done it already, I say no∣thing at all to that part, what I say, is to persuade and prevail upon those who have no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
done it, that they may lay aside the Thoughts of it, as a thing not to be justify'd to their Reason or Duty, and is nothing at all to those who may have so far forgotten themselves, as to have taken any wrong step already.</P>
<P>The principal Reason why I mention this is, because I cannot see with all the Eyes I have, or with all the Reasoning I can think of, that there is the least Ground in all this, to say or suggest that <HI>the Ʋnion is broken,</HI> much less that the Convention or Agreement between the two Nations IS DISSOLVED by this Act; and if, whatever may have been before, this is not so, then all the Reasons they give for the Un∣easiness abovesaid fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>Let none suggest that because I insist upon it that the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> is not broken and dissolved, that therefore I am to argue for the Charging <HI>Scot∣land</HI> with the Malt Tax; it is evident that the Doing or not Doing it is out of the question, as well as out of the province of a Pamphlet to debate, (1) Because the thing is done, and (2) Because it is the Legality of the Fact only that we are now speaking of, not the Conveni∣ence of it.</P>
<P>I regret exceedingly the thing, I lament the heavy Burthen this Tax will be to poor <HI>Scot∣land;</HI> and am willing to express my self as much that way, as a sincere Sorrow for a Dis∣aster to that Nation can require; but there is a great difference between being very sorry that it is so, and crying out against the Parliament as injurious, saying it is illegal, contrary to Articles, and a Breach of the stipulated A∣greement with <HI>Scotland,</HI> complaining of <HI>En∣gland</HI> as treacherous, false, a Breaker of Trea∣ties, &amp;c. and that therefore the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> is dis∣solved:</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18"/>
This I can by no means allow, but on the con∣try shall prove that <HI>Scotland</HI> her self, even by the Treaty of <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> has agreed and consented that this Tax should, at this time too, be laid upon them, if the <HI>British</HI> Parliament thought it needful to be so.</P>
<P>If this can be proved, then I think the In∣temperance of all the Measures which any have taken, or may take, in their censuring the Proceedings of the Parliament, will sufficiently be reproved.</P>
<P>To prove this we need go no further than the Treaty it self, and the Articles, which ex∣presly declare (1) That no Exemptions but such as are mentioned in the said Articles, shall be insisted. (2) That all Exemptions from Du∣ties, or Laying on Duties, with relation to <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be, and is thereby wholly left to the Determination of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot then but be in the breast of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to judge when it is proper to tax <HI>Scotland</HI> with any Payment whatsoever, which is not express'd to be ex∣empted, and which <HI>Scotland</HI> is not directly freed from in the Articles of the <HI>Ʋnion.</HI></P>
<P>But to bring this nearer, we are next to exa∣mine how the particular Case of the Malt Tax stands, with respect to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for this to look back not to the Articles only, but to the Debates of the Commissioners and Parliamen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about this very Tax, and the Articles of U∣nion. These are at large set down in <HI>De Foe'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> History of the Ʋnion,</HI> which however being to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> long to be repeated here, will be in part sup∣ply'd by the Following brief Account of it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19"/>
The First Treaty was carry'd on at <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1708; in which Treaty the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> had proposed an E∣quality of all Taxes to be laid upon the United Kingdom. The Words are these, <HI>That there be the same Customs, Excises, and all other Taxes, and the same Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Regula∣tions of Trade, throughout the Ʋnited Kingdom of</HI> Great Britain. <HI>Vide</HI> the Minutes, 29th of A∣pril 1706. Hist. of the <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> Fo. 27.</P>
<P>To this the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scot∣land</HI> answer'd on the 13th of <HI>May, That they do agree to the Equality of Excise on Beer, Ale, Mum, Cyder, Spirits, &amp;c. But propose an Exemp∣tion from all other Burthens and Excises, within</HI> Scotland, <HI>for a competent time, to be adjusted in the Course of the Treaty</HI> Ibid. Fol. 33. It is necessary, as we quote this, to give the Reasons alledged for this Demand of Exemption, which were thus expressed <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> may by the Benefit arising by the Communication of Trade, be put in a Capacity to bear a Proportion of Burthens and Excises, and they hope the Lords Commissioners for <HI>En∣gland</HI> will be convinc'd, that the Immunity from those other Burthens and Excises for a Term of Years, is consistent with an entire U∣nion, and will not put the Trade on an une∣qual foot, when the present Circumstances of Both Kingdoms are duely consider'd. <HI>Ibid. Fol.</HI> 34. <HI>Part</HI> iv.</P>
<P><HI>The Answer to this Proposal is set down at large, but is in Effect this,</HI> That the Lords, Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> to shew their readyness to comply with every thing that was reasonable to the bringing the Treaty to a good Effect, are wil∣ling to enter into the Consideration of the particu∣lar
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
Burthens and Exercises so desired to be Ex∣empted Point by Point, but that requiring Time, they in the General, declare, that they are enclined to Consent to an Exemption of Excises and Burthens as is proposed, in such Cases where it may done without Prejudice to the Trade and Manufactures. <HI>ib. fol. 34. Part iv.</HI></P>
<P>These things as mentioned here make it Evident, that the Exemption of these Bur∣thens and Excises for a competent Time only, was proposed even by the <HI>Scots</HI> Com∣missioners themselves. That is, that they did not understand or desire to have it understood, that the said Exemption should or could be perpetual. This farther appears in the De∣bates upon that Head the 17th of <HI>May</HI> follow∣ing, thus, <HI>The Lords Commissioners for</HI> Scotland <HI>from their Consideration of the present Circum∣stances of</HI> Scotland <HI>find themselves under a ne∣cessity to renew their Proposal for an Exemption fer some competent Time, from all other Exercises and Burthens: That the Subjects of</HI> Scotland <HI>may by the Benefit of Trade be enabled Cheerfully to bear an Equality of all other Burthens.</HI> ib. Part iv. fol. 37.</P>
<P>In the Debates of the 18th of <HI>May,</HI> The <HI>English</HI> Commissioners answered, That they understood this Exemption to extend only to such Duties as then subsisted in <HI>England:</HI> But if the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners would extend their Proposal of the 13th to an Exemption from all Burthens and Excises, which the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> may hereafter find necessary to impose on the United Kingdom. The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> are of Opi∣nion, that it cannot be supposed the Parlia∣ment of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will ever lay any sort
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
of Burthens upon the United Kingdom, but what they shall find of Necessity at that Time for the Preservation and Good of the Whole, and with due Regard to the Circumstances and Abilities of every Part of the United King∣dom, and to allow of any Supposition to the contrary, would be to form and set up an un∣answerable Argument against the Union it self.</P>
<P>To this the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> after long Deliberations consented, and the first Treaty was concluded with no other Provision against the Malt Tax than an Exemption from it during that current Year, as is express'd in the 13th Article as follows.</P>
<P>That during the continuance of the Duty upon Malt payable in <HI>England,</HI> which determines the <HI>24</HI>th Day of <HI>June 1707, Scotland</HI> shall not be charg'd with that Duty.</P>
<P>But when this Treaty came to be Debated in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and things were not carry'd on with such Temper and Mutual Confidence as they had been in the Treaty in <HI>England:</HI> The Parliament in <HI>Scotland</HI> after several Debates, thought fit to Grant a longer Exemption for several Duties, and for this of the Malt among the rest, take it thus.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD><HI>Friday</HI> the 6th of <HI>December</HI> 1706.</HEAD>
<P>The Debates of the Day were upon the Af∣fair of the Malt Tax, the previous Question had been put <HI>(viz.)</HI> Whether the Exemption from the Malt Tax should be Temporary or Perpetual? And it was carryed Temporary.</P>
<P>Then the main Question was put, Whether the Exemption from any Imposition on Malt in <HI>Scotland</HI> should be during this present War, or for a longer time, and carryed during the pre∣sent War only?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22"/>
The Difficulties in these things in <HI>Scotland</HI> arise from this Question, Whether they should depend upon the <HI>British</HI> Parliament maintain∣ing a just and an equal Regard to the good of the whole United Island after the Union, and that they would have Respect to the Circum∣stances of every Part in their laying Taxes? Or whether they should Pin them down in all time coming, that no other Burthens or Taxes should be laid on, than those already mention'd?</P>
<P>The Supposition of the Parliament of <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>'s being Partial against <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Re∣presentatives of <HI>Scotland</HI> being few being oppres∣sed and out Voted, as I have noted already, tho' it was a popular Notion and improved to an extravagant Height without Doors, yet it had not obtain'd so as to be own'd in the Parliament, nor indeed could any Man with just Reason have supposed such a thing, and therefore to offer at a positive Limitation on the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> seem'd to have something in it very harsh.</P>
<P>Again, it was alledg'd, That to Limit the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> not to lay on any other Customs, Excises, Taxes, Duties or Burthens, than those consented to in this Act, was to take away the Power from the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to conform their Affairs even to their own Circumstances, since the time might come when some of these Duties might be∣come burthensome that now were not so, and others which now would be burthensome, might be more for the Publick Service; but to tye the Parliament down absolutely, as in this case, would be to limit them from making Alterations in the pubiick Taxes, tho' apparently for the publick Advantage, and would in effect take from from them that Power for which they were really constitu¦ted, <HI>viz.</HI> to dispose the Peoples Purses, and redress thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grievanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"/>
It was long argued that the Parliament ought to be limit∣ted in this Case, because of the danger there was of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> being burthen'd with intolerable Taxes, and of the present Circumstances of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were allow'd to be unable to bear them. That under the Pretence of alte∣ration of Taxes, oppressive Duties might be laid upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> which tho' they might be tolerable in <HI>England,</HI> were not so here, and they ought to provide against them.</P>
<P>But it was resolv'd at last into this, That all future Contingences must be left to a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, and the words of the Arcicles contain a sufficient Reason for so doing</P>
<P>And thus with some Difficulty the Clause was passed, without any further Amendment.</P>
<P>These are such clear Testimonies, That the limiting the Exemption of the Malt Tax in <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Term of the War, was the meer Act and Deed of the Parlia∣ment in <HI>Scotland.</HI> That it was so far from being thought a short while or a Hardship, that it was the Effect of their warmest Debates and highest Distrust of the <HI>English.</HI> That <HI>Treaters</HI> or <HI>Commissioners</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> at the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> had acquiesced with the Exemption only for the current Year, leaving the rest to the Consideration of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament. But that the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> expressing some Dissatisfaction, or at least, less Confidence in the said <HI>British</HI> Parliament at that time, made an Amend∣ment to the First Treaty, in these Words, <HI>viz. That the Duties on Malt now payable in</HI> England, <HI>shall not be Charged upon t e Subjects of</HI> Scotland, <HI>during the Continuance of the present War.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Foundation the Legality of the present Case, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Of laying on the Malt Duty upon the Subject of <HI>Scotland;</HI> so that all the Pretence for its being a Breach of the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> is really taken away, the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament ha∣ving consented and agreed that the Exemption should ex∣tend to the End of the War only. This was the utmost the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> insisted upon, and the Words are made a Clause in the xv Article of the <HI>Ʋnion.</HI></P>
<P>I think it would be of no signification to mention here the Cavils of some People about the Words, <HI>The End of the Present War;</HI> as that the War is not ended, the Ratifi∣cations of the Peace with all the Allies being not actually exchanged, as particularly with <HI>Spain.</HI> This is of so lit∣tle moment, the War being acknowledg'd on all hands to be at an end, that it needs no other Answer.</P>
<P>Upon what other Supposition the Gentlemen of the North can suggest the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> is broken and dissolved, I mean particularly as it relates to the Malt Tax, we can∣not
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
prejudge, neither can any Answer be given thereto, until those other Suppositions may appear.</P>
<P>Passing then from the Dispute of the Legality of this Tax being now laid upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> and its Consistency with the <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> Two things remain before us, which being lightly touch'd contain the whole Argument <HI>(viz.)</HI> 1. <HI>What can be said in Defence of the violent Resentments which some People are pleased to express on this Occasion;</HI> and (2) <HI>What will be the Consequences of this Duty in</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>(1)</HI> What shall we say to the warm Expressions of Resent∣ment which are made so publick among some Men upon this Occasion, even to a Degree that I think is criminal, as it has been threatning to the Constitution and publick Peace.</P>
<P>As to that I think nothing can be said to justify it, and therefore to say nothing at all to it, is to shew such a Ten∣derness to the Persons as they ought to think themselves very much oblig'd by. Indiscretions are best forgotten, Time will make the Persons themselves remember them, and be very glad they were permitted to go no farther.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged, <HI>Scotland</HI> will be pinch'd hard by the Duties upon Malt, but to talk Disloyally and Undutifully upon such a Head is to make that a Crime, which is only a Misfortune. Nor have the People who thus Express themselves, the least pretence for saying they speak the Lar∣guage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when they talk thus. The People of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be Aggrieved, and may Complain of those Grievances, but they never, especially as a Nation or Body extend those Complaints beyond the Duty of Good Sub∣jects.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>What will be the Consequence of this Duty in</HI> Scot∣land? It is allowed, it will fall hard: But <HI>England</HI> has many Ways to make <HI>Scotland</HI> amends for any Hardship they may fall under on this Account. One way especially would be to pass an Act that the Ale which is now 1 <HI>d. per</HI> Chopin or Quart, may be sold at Five Farthings, or. Three Half-pence by the Retailer, and in proportion by the Common Brewer, without advancing the Duty of Excise, which without such an Act they cannot do.</P>
<P>Since these Sheets were in the Press, we see the House of Commons about to take into consideration that Part of Her Majesty's Speech which relates to the Encouragement of the Fishery. This is a large Field, in which there is a∣bundance of room to do <HI>Scotland</HI> good and <HI>England</HI> also, and by which, if suitable steps, are taken, <HI>England</HI> may find ways and means so to assist <HI>Scotland</HI> in Trade, in circulati∣on of Money, and in employment of the Poor, so as that the Malt Tax shall be no Burthen to them.</P>
