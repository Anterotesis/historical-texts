<P>Why Sir, I have the most accurate ac∣count; in the first place, she's very handsome, but nobody knows who she is; the next, she came here with the Indians, but nobody knows where she came from, and as to her future destination, nobody knows where she's going to.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>O. Average.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Break him! a dog, I'll break his head; I'll Court Martial him: was it for this I instructed him in the knowledge of the Counting-house, learnt him Policy-insurance—the art of fabricating news—and the science of getting Rich?</P>
</SP>

<HEAD>SONG. BLUSTER.</HEAD>
<L>See! the enemy advancing!</L>
<L>Hark! the signal to engage;</L>
<L>While the charger proudly prancing,</L>
<L>Seems our victory to presage.</L>
<L>The cannon's cheering thunder,</L>
<L>Inspires us with delight.</L>
<L>And even cowards wonder,</L>
<L>They are not afraid to fight.</L>
<L>The front line now is scattered,</L>
<L>There press the fainting foe,</L>
<L>The left wing too is shattered.</L>
<L><HI>(Victoria! Victoria!)</HI></L>
<L>Pursue pursue the blow.</L>
<L>Tho' ruthless slaugther slaining</L>
<L>With blood th'affrighted field,</L>
<L>The enemy disdaining,</L>
<L>All fear, full scorn to yield.</L>
<L>See! inspired with indignation,</L>
<L>Now they rally quick again,</L>
<L>Yet, tho' urg'd by desperation,</L>
<L>All their efforts are in vain.</L>
<L>But now we rout their van, boys,</L>
<L>Give quarter where you can, boys.</L>
<L>Huzza! our arms victorious,</L>
<L>Compleat their overthrow.</L>
<L>Success ïs doubly glorious</L>
<L>Against so brave a foe.</L>
<L>Hark! thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drums reluctant beating,</L>
<L>Give the signal for retreating;</L>
<L>While our trumpet's welcome greeting,</L>
<L>Triumph sounds in sprightly tone,</L>
<L>Victoria! the day's our own.</L>
