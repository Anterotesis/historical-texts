<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the IMPORTANCE of ORDER in CONDUCT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 CORINTH. xiv. 40.</BIBL>
<Q>Let all things be done—in order.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>ELIGION,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. I.</NOTE> like every regular and
well-connected system, is compos∣ed
of a variety of parts; each of
which possesses its separate importance, and
contributes to the perfection of the whole.
Some graces are essentail to it; such as faith
and repentance, the love of God, and the
love of our neighbour; which, for that rea∣son,
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
must be often inculcated on men.
There are other dispositions and habits
which though they hold not so high a rank,
yet are necessary to the introduction and
support of the former; and therefore, in
religious exhortations these also justly claim
a place. Of this nature is that regard to
order, method and regularity, which the
apostle enjoins us in the text to carry
though the whole of life. Whether you
consider it as, in itself, a moral duty, or
not, yet I hope soon to convince you that
it is essential to the proper discharge of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣most
all duties, and merits upon that ac∣count
a greater degree of attention than is
commonly paid to it in a religious view.</P>
<P>If you look abroad into the world, you
may be satisfied, at the first glance, that a
vicious and libertine life is always a life of
confusion. Thence it is natural to infer
that order is friendly to religion. As the
neglect of it co-operates with vice, so the
preservation of it must assist virtue. By the
appointment of providence, it is indispen∣sably
requisite to worldly prosperity. Thence
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
arises a presumption that it is connected
also with spiritual improvement. When
you behold a man's affairs, through ne∣gligence
and misconduct, involved in dis∣order,
you naturally conclude that his ruin
approaches. You may at the same time
justly suspect, that the causes which affect
his temporal welfare, operate also to the
prejudice of his moral interests. The apo∣stle
teaches us in this chapter, that <HI>God is
not the author of confusion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 33.</NOTE> He is a lover
of order; and all his works are full of order.
But <HI>where confusion is, there is,</HI> its close
attendant, <HI>every evil work</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">James iii. 16.</NOTE> In the se∣quel
of this discourse I shall point out some
of those parts of conduct wherein it is most
material to virtue that order take place; and
then shall conclude with showing the high
advantages which attend it. Allow me to
recommend to you, order in the conduct of
your affairs; order in the distribution of
your time; order in the management of
your fortune; order in the regulation of
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
your amusements; order in the arrange∣ment
of your society. Thus <HI>let all things
be done in order.</HI></P>
<P>I. MAINTAIN order in the conduct of
your wordly affairs. Every man, in every
station of life, has some concerns, private,
domestic, or public, which require succes∣sive
attention he is placed in some sphere
of active duty. Let the employments
which belong to that sphere be so arranged,
that each may keep its place, without just∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
another; and that what regards the
world may not interfere with what is due
to God. In proportion to the multiplicity
of affairs, the observance of order becomes
more indispensable. But scarcely is there
any train of life so simple and uniform but
what will suffer through the neglect of it.
I speak not now of suffering in point of
worldly interest. I call upon you to attend
to higher interests; to remember that the
orderly conduct of your temporal affairs
forms a great part of your duty as Christ∣ians.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12"/>
Many, indeed, can hardly be persuaded
of this truth. A strong propensity has, in
every age, appeared among men to seque∣strate
religion from the commerce of the
world. Seasons of retreat and devotion
they are willing to appropriate to God.
But the world they consider as their own
province. They carry on a sort of sepa∣rate
interest there. Nay, by the respect
which, on particular occasions, they pay to
religion, they too often imagine that they
have acquired the liberty of acting in
worldly matters according to what plan
they chuse. How entirely do such persons
mistake the design of Christianity!—In this
world you were placed by Providence as on
a great field of trial. By the necessities of
your nature you are called forth to differ∣ent
employments. By many ties you are
connected with human society. From su∣periours
and inferiours, from neighbours
and equals, from friends and enemies, de∣mands
arise, and obligations circulate
through all the ranks of life. This active
seene was contrived by the wisdom of hea∣ven,
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
on purpose that it might bring into
exercise all the virtues of the christian cha∣racter;
your justice, candour and veracity
in dealing with one another; your sidelity
to every trust, and your conscientious dis∣charge
of every office, which is committed
to you; your affection for your friends;
your forgiveness of enemies; your charity
to the distressed; your attention to the in∣terests
of your family. It is by fulfilling all
these obligations, in proper succession, that
you show <HI>your conversation to be such as be∣cometh
the gospel of Christ.</HI> It is thus you
make <HI>your light so to shine before men, that
they may see your good works, and glorify your
Father which is in heaven.</HI> It is thus you
are rendered <HI>meet for the inheritance of the
saints in light.</HI>—But how can those various
duties be discharged by persons who are
ever in that hurry and perplexity which
disorder creates? You wish, perhaps, to
perform what your character and station
require. But from the confusion in which
you have allowed yourselves to be involved,
you find it to have become impossible.
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
What was neglected to be done in its pro∣per
place, thrusts itself forward at an incon∣venient
season. A multitude of affairs
crowd upon you together. Different obli∣gations
distract you; and this distraction
in sometimes the cause, sometimes the pre∣tence,
of equally neglecting them all, or,
at least, of sacrificing the greater to the
lesser.</P>
<P>Hence arise so many inconsistent charac∣ters,
and such frequent instances of partial
and divided goodness, as we find in the
world; appearances of generosity without
justice, honour without truth, probity to
men without reverence of God. He who
conducts his affairs with method and regu∣larity,
meets every duty in its proper place,
and assigns it its due rank. But where there
is no order in conduct, there can be no uni∣formity
in character. The natural connex∣ion
and arrangement of duties is lost. If
virtue appear at all, it will be only in fits
and starts. The authority of conscience
may occasionally operate, when our situa∣tion
affords it room for exertion. But in
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
other circumstances of equal importance,
every moral sentiment will be overpowered
by the tumultuous bustle of worldly affairs.
Fretfulness of temper too, will generally
characterize those who are negligent of or∣der.
The hurry in which they live, and
the embarrassments with which they are
surrounded, keep their spirits in perpetual
ferment. Conflicting with difficulties which
they are unable to overcome, conscious of
their own misconduct, but ashamed to con∣fess
it, they are engaged in many a secret
struggle; and the uneasiness which they
suffer within, recoils in bad humour on all
who are around them. Hence the wretch∣ed
resources to which, at last, they are obliged
to fly, in order to quiet their cares. In de∣spair
of being able to unravel what they
have suffered to become so perplexed, they
sometimes sink into supine indolence, some∣times
throw themselves into the arms of
intemperance and loose pleasure; by either
of which they aggravate their guilt, and ac∣celerate
their ruin. To the end that order
may be maintained in your affairs, it is ne∣cessary,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16"/>
II. THAT you attend to order in the dis∣tribution
of your time. Time you ought to
consider as a sacred trust committed to you
by God; of which you are now the depo∣sitaries,
and are to render account at the last.
That portion of it which he has al∣lotted
you is intended partly for the con∣cerns
of this world, partly for those of the
next. Let each of these occupy in the dis∣tribution
of your time that space which
properly belongs to it. Let not the hours
of hospitality and pleasure interfere with
the discharge of your necessary affairs; and
let not what you call necessary affairs en∣croach
upon the time which is due to de∣votion.
<HI>To every thing there is a season, and
a time for every purpose under the heaven.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. iii. 1.</NOTE>
If you delay till to-morrow what ought to
be done to-day, you overcharge the mor∣row
with a burden which belongs not to it.
You load the wheels of time, and prevent
it from carrying you along smoothly. He
who every morning plans the transactions
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
of the day, and follows out that plan, carries
on a thread which will guide him through
the labyrinth of the most busy life. The
orderly arrangement of his time is like a
ray of light which darts itself through all
his affairs. But where no plan is laid,
where the disposal of time is surrendered
merely to the chance of incidents, all things
lie huddled together in one chaos, which
admits neither of distribution nor review.</P>
<P>The first requisite for introducing order
into the management of time, is to be im∣pressed
with a just sense of its value. Con∣sider
well how much depends upon it, and
how fast it flies away. The bulk of men
are in nothing more capricious and incon∣sistent
than in their appretiation of time.
When they think of it as the measure of
their continuance on earth, they highly
prize it, and with the greatest anxiety seek
to lengthen it out. But when they view it
in separate parcels, they appear to hold it
in contempt, and squander it with incon∣siderate
profusion. While they complain
that life is short, they are often wishing its
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
different periods at an end. Covetous of
every other possession, of time only they are
prodigal. They allow every idle man to be
master of this property, and make every
frivolous occupation welcome that can help
them to consume it. Among those who are
so careless of time, it is not to be expected
that order should be observed in its distri∣bution.
But by this fatal neglect, how
many materials of severe and lasting regret
are they laying up in store for themselves!
The time which they suffer to pass away in
the midst of confusion, bitter repentance
seeks afterwards in vain to recal. What
was omitted to be done at its proper mo∣ment,
arises to be the torment of some fu∣ture
season. Manhood is disgraced by the
consequences of neglected youth. Old age,
oppressed by cares that belonged to a former
period, labours under a burden not its own.
At the close of life, the dying man be∣holds
with anguish that his days are finish∣ing,
when his preparation for eternity is
hardly commenced. Such are the effects
of a disorderly waste of time, through not
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
attending to its value. Every thing in the
life of such persons is misplaced. Nothing
is performed aright, from not being per∣formed
in due season.</P>
<P>But he who is orderly in the distribution
of his time, takes the proper method of
escaping those manifold evils. He is justly
said to <HI>redeem the time.</HI> By proper manage∣ment,
he prolongs it. He lives much in
little space; more in a few years than
others do in many. He can live to God
and his own soul, and at the same time at∣tend
to all the lawful interests of he present
world. He looks back on the past, and
provides for the future. He catches and
arrests the hours as they fly. They are
marked down for useful purposes, and their
memory remains. Whereas those hours fleet
by the man of confusion like a shadow.
His days and years are either blanks of
which he has no remembrance, or they are
filled up with such a confused and irregular
succession of unfinished transactions, that
though he remembers he has been busy,
yet he can give no account of the business
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
which has employed him. Of him, more
than of any other, it may with justice be
pronounced, that the <HI>walketh in a vain shew;
he is disquieted in vain.</HI></P>
<P>III. INTRODUCE order into the manage∣ment
of your fortune. Whatever it be, let
the administration of it proceed with me∣thod
and oeconomy. From time to time
examine your situation; and proportion
your expence to your growing or diminish∣ing
revenue. Provide what is necessary,
before you indulge in what is superfluous.
Study to do justice to all with whom you
deal, before you affect the praise of libera∣lity.
In a word, fix such a plan of living
as you find that your circumstances will
fairly admit, and adhere to it invariably
against every temptation to improper ex∣cess.</P>
<P>No admonition respecting morals is more
necessary than this to the age in which we
live; an age manifestly distinguished by a
propensity to thoughtless profusion; wherein
all the different ranks of men are observed
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
to press with forward vanity on those who
are above them; to vie with their supe∣riours
in every mode of luxury and ostenta∣tion;
and to seek no farther argument for
justifying extravagance, than the fashion of
the times, and the supposed necessity of
living like others around them. This turn
of mind begets contempt for sober and or∣derly
plans of life. It overthrows all re∣gard
to domestic concerns and duties. It
pushes men on to hazardous and visionary
schemes of gain; and unfortunately unites
the two extremes, of grasping with rapaci∣ousness,
and of squandering with profusion.
In the midst of such disorder no prosperity
can be of long continuance. While con∣fusion
grows upon men's affairs, and pro∣digality
at the same time wastes their sub∣stance,
poverty makes its advances <HI>like an
armed man.</HI> They tremble at the view of
the approaching evil; but have lost the
force of mind to make provision against it.
Accustomed to move in a round of society
and pleasures disproporotioned to their con∣dition,
they are unable to break through
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
the enchantments of habit; and with their
eyes open sink into the gulph which is be∣fore
them. Poverty enforces dependance;
and dependance increases corruption. Ne∣cessity
first betrays them into mean com∣pliances;
next, impels them to open crimes;
and beginning with ostentation and extra∣vagance,
they end in infamy and guilt.
Such are the consequences of neglecting
order in our worldly circumstances. Such
is the circle in which the profuse and the
dissolute daily run.—To what cause, so
much as to the want of order, can we attri∣bute
those scenes of distress which so fre∣quently
excite our pity; families that once
were flourishing reduced to ruin; and the
melancholy widow and neglected orphan
thrown forth, friendless, upon the world?
What cause has been more fruitful in en∣gendering
those atrocious crimes which fill
society with disquiet and terrour; in train∣ing
the gamester to fraud, the robber to
violence, and even the assassin to blood?</P>
<P>Be assured, then, that order, frugality,
and oeconomy, are the necessary supports of
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
every personal and private virtue. How
humble soever these qualities may appear to
some, they are, nevertheless, the basis on
which liberty, independence, and true ho∣nour,
must rise. He who has the steadiness
to arrange his affairs with method and re∣gularity,
and to conduct his train of life
agreeably to his circumstances, can be master
of himself in every situation into which he
may be thrown. He is under no necessity
to flatter or to lie; to stoop to what is
mean, or to commit what is criminal. But
he who wants that firmness of mind which
the observance of order requires, is held in
bondage to the world; he can neither act
his part with courage as a man, nor with
fidelity as a Christian. From the moment
you have allowed yourselves to pass the line
of oeconomy, and to live beyond your for∣tune,
you have entered on the path of
danger. Precipices surround you on all
sides. Every step which you take may
lead to mischiefs that, as yet, lie hidden;
and to crimes that will end in your ever∣lasting
perdition.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24"/>
IV. OBSERVE order in your amusements;
that is, allow them no more than their pro∣per
place; study to keep them within due
bounds; mingle them in a temperate suc∣cession
with serious duties, and the higher
business of life. Human life cannot pro∣ceed
to advantage without some measure of
relaxation and entertainment. We require
relief from care. We are not formed for a
perpetual stretch of serious thought. By
too intense and continued application, our
feeble powers would soon be worn out. At
the same time, from our propensity to ease
and pleasure, amusement proves, among all
ranks of men, the most dangerous foe to
order. For it tends incessantly to usurp and
encroach, to widen its territories, to thrust
itself into the place of more important con∣cerns,
and thereby to disturb and counter∣act
the natural course of things. One fri∣volous
amusement indulged out of season,
will often carry perplexity and confusion
through a long succession of affairs.</P>
<P>Amusements, therefore, though they be
of an innocent kind, require steady go∣vernment,
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
to keep them within a due and
limited province. But such as are of an
irregular and vicious nature, require not to
be governed, but to be banished from every
orderly society. As soon as a man seeks his
happiness from the gaming-table, the mid∣night-revel,
and the other haunts of licen∣tiousness,
confusion seizes upon him as its
own. There will no longer be order in his
family, nor order in his affairs, nor order
in his time. The most important concerns
of life are abandoned. Even the order of
nature is by such persons inverted; night
is changed into day, and day into night.
Character, honour, and interest itself, are
trampled under foot. You may with cer∣tainty
prognosticate the ruin of these men
to be just at hand. Disorder, arisen to its
height, has nearly accomplished its work.
The spots of death are upon them. Let
every one who would escape the pestilen∣tial
contagion fly with haste from their
company.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="26"/>
V. PRESERVE order in the arrangement
of your society; that is, entangle not your∣selves
in a perpetual and promiscuous crowd;
select with prudence and propriety those with
whom you chuse to associate; let company
and retreat succeed each other at measured
intervals. There can be no order in his life
who allots not a due share of his time to
retirement and reflection. He can neither
prudently arrange his temporal affairs, nor
properly attend to his spiritual interests.
He lives not to himself, but to the world.
By continual dissipation, he is rendered
giddy and thoughtless. He contracts un∣avoidably
from the world that spirit of dis∣order
and confusion which is so prevalent
in it.</P>
<P>It is not a sufficient preservative against
this evil, that the circles of society in which
you are engaged are not of a libertine and
vicious kind. If they withdraw you from
that attention to yourselves, and your do∣mestic
concerns, which becomes a good man,
they are subversive of order, and incon∣sistent
with your duty. What is innocent
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
in itself, degenerates into crime from being
carried to excess; and idle, trifling society
is nearly a-kin to such as is corrupting. One
of the first principles of order is, to learn to
be happy at home. It is in domestic re∣treat
that every wise and virtuous man finds
his chief satisfaction. It is there he forms
the plans which regulate his public conduct.
He who knows not how to enjoy himself
when alone, can never be long happy
abroad. To his vacant mind, company
may afford a temporary relief; but when
forced to return to himself, he will be so
much more oppressed and languid. Where∣as,
by a due mixture of public and private
life, we keep free of the snares of both, and
enjoy each to greater advantage.</P>
<P>WHEN we review those different parts of
behaviour to which I have shewn that order
is essential, it must naturally occur to you,
that they are all mutually connected, and
hang upon each other. Throughout your
affairs, your time, your expence, your
amusements, your society, the principle of
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
order must be equally carried, if you ex∣pect
to reap any of its happy fruits. For
if into any one of those great departments
of life you suffer disorder to enter, it will
spread through all the rest. In vain, for
instance, you purpose to be orderly in the
conduct of your affairs, if you be irregular
in the distribution of your time. In vain
you attempt to regulate your expence, if
into your amusements, or your society, dis∣order
has crept. You have admitted a
principle of confusion which will defeat all
your plans; and perplex and entangle what
you sought to arrange. Uniformity is above
all things necessary to order. If you desire
that any thing should proceed according to
method and rule, let <HI>all things,</HI> as the text
exhorts, <HI>be done in order.</HI></P>
<P>I must also admonish you, that in small,
as well as in great affairs, a due regard to
order is requisite. I mean not that you
ought to look on those minute attentions
which are apt to occupy frivolous minds,
as connected either with virtue or wisdom.
But I exhort you to remember, that disorder,
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
like other immoralities, frequently takes rise
from inconsiderable beginnings. They who,
in the lesser transactions of life, are totally
negligent of rule, will be in hazard of ex∣tending
that negligence by degrees to such
affairs and duties as will render them cri∣minal.
Remissness grows on all who study
not to guard against it; and it is only by
frequent exercise that the habits of order
and punctuality can be thoroughly con∣firmed.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said, the great im∣portance
of this principle to moral and reli∣gious
conduct must already be evident.
Let us, however, conclude with taking a
summary view of the advantages which at∣tend
it.</P>
<P>First, the observance of order serves to
correct that negligence which makes you
omit some duties, and that hurry and pre∣cipitancy
which makes you perform others
imperfectly. Your attention is thereby di∣rected
to its proper objects. You follow the
streight path which Providence has pointed
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
out to man; in the course of which all the
different business of life presents itself regu∣larly
to him on every side. God and man,
time and eternity, possess their proper sta∣tions,
arise in succession to his view, and
attract his care. Whereas he who runs on
in a disorderly course, speedily involves
himself in a labyrinth, where he is sur∣rounded
with intricacy and darkness. The
crooked paths into which he strikes, turn
him aside from the proper line of human
pursuit; hide from his sight the objects
which he ought chiefly to regard, and
bring others under his view, which serve
no purpose but to distract and mislead him.</P>
<P>Next, by attending to order, you avoid
idleness, that most fruitful source of crimes
and evils. Acting upon a plan, meeting
every thing in its own place, you constantly
find innocent and useful employment for
time. You are never at a loss how to dis∣pose
of your hours, or to fill up life agree∣ably.
In the course of human action, there
are two extremes equally dangerous to vir∣tue;
the multiplicity of affairs, and the
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
total want of them. The man of order
stands in the middle between these two ex∣tremes,
and suffers from neither. He is
occupied, but not oppressed. Whereas the
disorderly, overloading one part of time,
and leaving another vacant, are at one pe∣riod
overwhelmed with business, and at
another, either idle through want of em∣ployment,
or indolent through perplexity.
Those seasons of indolence and idleness,
which recur so often in their life, are their
most dangerous moments. The mind, un∣happy
in its situation, and clinging to every
object which can occupy or amuse it, is
then aptest to throw itself into the arms of
every vice and every folly.</P>
<P>Farther, by the preservation of order,
you check inconstancy and levity. Fickle
by nature is the human heart. It is fond
of change; and perpetually tends to start
aside from the streight line of conduct.
Hence arises the propriety of bringing our∣selves
under subjection to method and rule;
which, though at first it may prove con∣straining,
yet by degrees, and from the ex∣perience
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
of its happy effects, becomes na∣tural
and agreeable. It rectifies those irre∣gularities
of temper and manners to which
we give the name of caprice; and which
are distinguishing characteristics of a disor∣derly
mind. It is the parent of steadiness
of conduct. It forms consistency of cha∣racter.
It is the ground of all the confi∣dence
we repose in one another. For, the
disorderly we know not where to find. In
him only can we place any trust who is
uniform and regular; who lives by prin∣ciple,
not by humour; who acts upon a
plan, and not by desultory motions.</P>
<P>The advantages of order hitherto men∣tioned
belong to rectitude of conduct.
Consider also how important it is to your
self-enjoyment and felicity. Order is the
source of peace; and peace is the highest
of all temporal blessings. Order is indeed
the only region in which tranquillity dwells.
The very mention of confusion imports
disturbance and vexation. Is it possible
for that man to be happy who cannot look
into the state of his affairs, or the tenor of
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
his conduct, without discerning all to be
embroiled; who is either in the midst of
remorse for what he has neglected to do,
or in the midst of hurry to overtake what
he finds, too late, was necessary to have
been done? Such as live according to or∣der
may be compared to the celestial bodies
which move in regular courses, and by stat∣ed
laws; whose influence is beneficent;
whose operations are quiet and tranquil.
The disorderly resemble those tumultuous
elements on earth which, by sudden and
violent irruptions, disturb the course of
nature. By mismanagement of affairs, by
excess in expence, by irregularity in the
indulgence of company and amusement,
they are perpetually creating molestation
both to themselves and others. They de∣part
from their road to seek pleasure; and
instead of it, they every where raise up
sorrows. Being always found out of their
proper place, they of course interfere and
jar with others. The disorders which they
raise never fail to spread beyond their own
line, and to involve many in confusion
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
and distress; whence they necessarily be∣come
the authors of tumult and conten∣tion,
of discord and enmity. Whereas or∣der
is the foundation of union. It allows
every man to carry on his own affairs
without disturbing his neighbour. It is the
golden chain which holds together the so∣cieties
of men in friendship and peace.</P>
<P>In fine, the man of order is connected
with all the higher powers and principles
in the universe. He is the follower of God.
He walks with him, and acts upon his plan.
His character is formed on the spirit which
religion breathes. For religion in general,
and the religion of Christ in particular, may
be called the great discipline of order. To
<HI>walk sinfully, and to walk disorderly,</HI> are
synonymous terms in Scripture. From
<HI>such as walk disorderly</HI> we are commanded,
<HI>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> to
<HI>withdraw ourselves.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. iii. 6.</NOTE> The kingdom of
Satan is the reign of disorder and darkness.
To restore order among the works of God,
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
was the end for which the Son of God de∣scended
to the earth. He requires order to
be observed in his church. His undertak∣ing
is to be consummated in that perfect
order which he shall introduce at the last
day. In <HI>the new earth and the new heavens,</HI>
undisturbed order shall for ever prevail
among the <HI>spirits of the just made perfect;</HI>
and whatever farther preparation may be
requisite for our being admitted to join their
society, it is certain that we shall never
share in it, unless we make it now our
study to <HI>do all things decently and in order.</HI></P>

<Q>Keep thy heart with all diligence: for out of

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG the many wise counsels
given by this inspired writer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. II.</NOTE> there
is none which deserves greater regard than
that contained in the text. Its importance,
however, is too seldom perceived by the
generality of men. They are apt to con∣sider
the regulation of external conduct as
the chief object of religion. If they can
act their part with decency, and maintain a
fair character, they conceive their duty to
be fulfilled. What passes in the mean time
within their mind, they suppose to be of no
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
great consequence either to themselves, or
to the world. In opposition to this dan∣gerous
plan of morality, the wise man ex∣horts
us <HI>to keep the heart;</HI> that is, to attend
not only to our actions, but to our thoughts
and desires; and <HI>to keep the heart with all
diligence,</HI> that is, with sedulous and unre∣mitting
care; for which he assigns this
reason, that, <HI>out of the heart are the issues
of life.</HI>—In discoursing of this subject I
purpose to consider, separately, the govern∣ment
of the thoughts, of the passions, and
of the temper. But before entering on any
of these, let us begin with enquiring in
what sense <HI>the issues of life</HI> are said to be <HI>out
of the heart;</HI> that we may discern the force
of the argument which the text suggests, to
recommend this great duty of <HI>keeping the
heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The issues of life</HI> are justly said to be out
of the heart, because the state of the heart
is what determines our moral character,
and what forms our chief happiness or misery.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="38"/>
FIRST, it is the state of the heart which
determines our moral character. The te∣nor
of our actions will always correspond
to the dispositions that prevail within.
To dissemble or to suppress them, is a fruit∣less
attempt. In spite of our efforts, they
will perpetually break forth in our beha∣viour.
On whatever side the weight of
inclination hangs, it will draw the practice
after it. In vain therefore you study to
preserve your hands clean, unless you re∣solve
at the same time to keep your heart
pure. <HI>Make the tree good,</HI> as our Saviour
directs, <HI>and then its fruits will be good also.</HI>
For <HI>out of the heart proceed</HI> not only <HI>evil
thoughts,</HI> but <HI>murders, adulteries, fornica∣tions,
theft, false witness, blasphemies.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Math. xv. 18.</NOTE> If
that fountain be once poisoned, you can
never expect that salubrious streams will
flow from it. Throughout the whole of
their course, they will carry the taint of
the parent spring.</P>
<P>But it is not merely from its influence on
external action that the importance of the
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
heart to our moral character arises. Inde∣pendent
of all action, it is, in truth, the
state of the heart itself which forms our
character in the sight of God. With our
fellow-creatures, actions must ever hold the
chief rank; because, by these only we can
judge of one another; by these we affect
each other's welfare; and therefore to these
alone the regulation of human law extends.
But in the eye of that Supreme Being, to
whom our whole internal frame is unco∣vered,
dispositions hold the place of actions;
and it is not so much what we perform, as
the motive which moves us to perform∣ance,
that constitutes us good or evil in
his sight. Even among men, the mora∣lity
of actions is estimated by the principle
from which they are judged to proceed;
and such as the principle is, such is the
man accounted to be. One, for instance,
may spend much of his fortune in chari∣table
actions; and yet, if he is believed to be
influenced by mere ostentation, he is deem∣ed
not charitable, but vain. He may la∣bour
unweariedly to serve the public; but
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
if he is prompted by the desire of rising
into power, he is held not public spirited,
but ambitious: And if he bestows a bene∣fit
purely that he may receive a greater in
return, no man would reckon him gene∣rous,
but selfish and interested. If reason
thus clearly teaches us to estimate the value
of actions by the dispositions which give
them birth, it is an obvious conclusion, that
according to those dispositions we are all
ranked and classed by him who seeth into
every heart. The rectification of our prin∣ciples
of action is the primary object of
religious discipline: and in proportion as
this is more or less advanced, we are more
or less religious. Accordingly, the rege∣neration
of the heart is every where repre∣sented
in the Gospel as the most essentail
requisite in the character of a Christian.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, the state of the heart not
only determines our moral character, but
forms our principal happiness or misery.
External situations of fortune are no far∣ther
of consequence than as they operate on
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
the heart; and their operation there is far
from corresponding to the degree of worldly
prosperity or adversity. If, from any in∣ternal
cause a man's peace of mind be
disturbed, in vain you load him with all
the honours or riches which the world can
bestow. They remain without, like things
at a distance from him. They reach not
the source of enjoyment. Discomposed
thoughts, agitated passions, and a ruffled
temper, poison every ingredient of plea∣sure
which the world holds out; and over∣cast
every object which presents itself, with
a melancholy gloom. In order to acquire
a capacity for happiness, it must be our first
study to rectify such inward disorders.
Whatever discipline tends to accomplish
this purpose, is of greater importance to
man than the acquisition of the advantages
of fortune. These are precarious and
doubtful in their effect; internal tranquil∣lity
is a certain good. These are only
means; but that is the end. These are no
more than instruments of satisfaction: that,
is satisfaction itself.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="42"/>
Justly is it said by the Wise Man, that <HI>he
who hath no rule over his spirit, is like a city
that is broken down and without walls.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxv. 28.</NOTE> All
is waste; all is in disorder and ruins within
him. He possesses no defence against dan∣gers
of any sort. He lies open to every
insurrection of ill-humour, and every inva∣sion
of distress. Whereas he who is em∣ployed
in regulating his mind is making
provision against all the accidents of life.
He is erecting a fortress into which, in the
day of danger, he can retreat with safety.
And hence, amidst those endeavours to se∣cure
happiness which incessantly employ
the life of man, the careful regulation, or
the improvident neglect of the inward
frame, forms the chief distinction between
wisdom and folly.</P>
<P>THUS it appears with how much pro∣priety
the <HI>issues of life</HI> are said to be <HI>out of
the heart.</HI> Here rise those great springs of
human conduct whence the main currents
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
flow of our virtue, or our vice; of our hap∣piness,
or our misery, Besides this power∣ful
argument for <HI>keeping the heart with all
diligence</HI> I must mention another import∣ant
consideration taken from the present
state of human nature. Think what your
heart now is, and what must be the conse∣quence
of remitting your vigilance in watch∣ing
over it. With too much justice it is
said in Scripture, to be <HI>deceitful above all
things, and desperately wicked.</HI> Its bias of
innate corruption gives it a perpetual ten∣dency
downwards into vice and disorder.
To direct and impel it upwards, requires a
constant effort. Experience may convince
you, that almost every desire has a propen∣sity
to wander into an improper direction;
that every passion tends to excess; and that
around your imagination there perpetually
crowds a whole swarm of vain and cor∣rupting
thoughts. After all the care that
can be bestowed by the best men on the
regulation of the heart, it frequently baf∣fles
their efforts to keep it under proper
discipline. Into what universal tumult
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
then must it rise, if no vigilance be em∣ployed,
and no government be exercised
over it? Inattention and remissness is all
that the great adversary of mankind de∣sires,
in order to gain full advantage.
While you <HI>sleep, he sows his tares in the
field.</HI> The house which he finds vacant
and unguarded, he presently <HI>garnishes with
euil spirits.</HI></P>
<P>Add to this, that the human temper is
to be considered as a system, the parts of
which have a mutual dependance on each
other. Introduce disorder into any one
part, and you derange the whole. Suffer
but one passion to go out of its place, or
to acquire an unnatural force, and presently
the balance of the soul will be broken; its
powers will jar among themselves, and their
operations become discordant. <HI>Keep thy
heart therefore with all diligence;</HI> for all
thy diligence is here required. And though
thine own keeping alone will not avail,
unless the assistance of a higher power con∣cur,
yet of this be well assured, that no
aid from heaven is to be expected, if thou
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
shalt neglect to exert thy self in perform∣ing
the part assigned thee.</P>
<P>HAVING now shown the importance of
exercising government over the heart, I
proceed to consider more particularly in
what that government consists, as it re∣spects
the thoughts, the passions, and the temper.</P>
<P>I begin with the thoughts, which are the
prime movers of the whole human conduct.
All that makes a figure on the great theatre
of the world, the employments of the busy,
the enterprizes of the ambitious, and the
exploits of the warlike, the virtues which
form the happinese, and the crimes which
occasion the misery of mankind, originate
in that silent and secret recess of thought
which is hidden from every human eye.
The secresy and silence which reign there
favour the prejudice entertained by too
many, that thought is exempted from all
controul. Passions, they perhaps admit,
require government and restraint, because
they are violent emotions and disturb so∣ciety.
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
But with their thoughts, they plead,
no one is concerned. By these, as long as
they remain in their bosom, no offence can
be given, and no injury committed. To
enjoy unrestrained the full range of imagi∣nation,
appears to them the native right
and privilege of man.</P>
<P>Had they to do with none but their
fellow-creatures, such reasoning might be
specious. But they ought to remember,
that in the sight of the Supreme Being,
thoughts bear the character of good or evil,
as much as actions; and that they are, in
especial manner, the subjects of divine ju∣risdiction,
because they are cognizable by
no other tribunal. The moral regulation
of our thoughts, is the particular test of our
reverence for God. If we restrain our pas∣sions
from breaking forth into open disor∣ders,
while we abandon our imagination
in secret to corruption, we show that virtue
rests with us upon regard to men; and
that however we may act a part in public
with propriety, there is before our eyes
no fear of that God who <HI>searcheth the
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
heart, <HI>and</HI> requireth truth in the inward
parts.</HI></P>
<P>But even abstracting from this awful
consideration, the government of our
thoughts must appear to be of high con∣sequence,
from their direct influence on
conduct. It is plain that thought gives the
first impulse to every principle of action.
Actions are, in truth, no other than thoughts
ripened into consistency and substance. So
certain is this, that to judge with precision
of the character of any man, and to foretell
with confidence what part he will act, no
more were requisite, than to be rendered
capable of viewing the current of thought
which passes most frequently within him.
Though by such a method we have no ac∣cess
to judge of one another, yet thus it is
always in our power to judge of our selves.
Each of us, by impartially scrutinizing his
indulged and favourite thoughts, may dis∣cover
the whole secret of his real character.
This consideration alone, is sufficient to
show of what importance the government
of thought is to the <HI>keeping of the heart.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="48"/>
BUT, supposing us convinced of its im∣portance,
a question may arise, How far it
is within our power, and in what degree
thoughts are subject to the command of the
will? It is plain that they are not always
the offspring of choice. Often they are in∣evitably
impressed upon the mind by sur∣rounding
objects. Often they start up, as
of themselves, without any principle of in∣troduction
which we are able to trace. <HI>As
the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither
it goeth,</HI> equally rapid in its transitions,
and ins<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rutable in its progress, is the course
of thought. Moving along a train of con∣nections
which are too delicate for our ob∣servation,
it defeats all endeavours either to
explore or to stop its path. Hence vain
and fantastic imaginations sometimes break
in upon the most settled attention, and dis∣turb
even the devout exercises of pious minds.
Instances of this sort must be placed
to the account of human frailty. They are
misfortunes to be deplored, rather than
crimes to be condemned; and our gracious
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
Creator, who <HI>knows our frame, and remem∣bers
we are dust,</HI> will not be severe in mark∣ing
every such error and wandering of the mind.
But, after these allowances are made,
still there remains much scope for the proper
government of thought; and a multitude of
cases occur, in which we are no less ac∣countable
for what we think, than for what
we do.</P>
<P>As, first, when the introduction of any
train of thought depends upon ourselves,
and is our voluntary act; by turning our
attention towards such objects, awaken∣ing
such passions, or engaging in such
employments as we know must give a pe∣culiar
determination to our thoughts. Next,
when thoughts, by whatever accident they
may have been originally suggested, are in∣dulged
with deliberation and complacency.
Though the mind has been passive in their
reception, and, therefore, free of blame;
yet, if it be active in their continuance, the
guilt becomes its own. They may have
intruded at first, like unbidden guests; but
if, when entered, they are made welcome,
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
and kindly entertained, the case is the same
as if they had been invited from the begin∣ning.
If we be thus accountable to God
for thoughts either voluntarily introduced,
or deliberately indulged, we are no less so,
in the last place, for those which find ad∣mittance
into our hearts from supine negli∣gence,
from total relaxation of attention,
from allowing our imagination to rove with
entire licence, <HI>like the eyes of the sool, to∣wards
the ends of the earth.</HI> Our minds are,
in this case, thrown open to folly and va∣nity.
They are prostituted to every evil
thing which pleases to take possession. The
consequences must all be charged to our ac∣count;
and in vain we plead excuse from
human infirmity. Hence it appears, that
the great object at which we are to aim in
governing our thoughts, is, to take the most
effectual measures for preventing the intro∣duction
of such as are sinful, and for hasten∣ing
their expulsion, if they shall have intro∣duced
themselves without consent of the will.</P>
<P>But when we descend into our breasts,
and examine how fur we have studied to
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
keep this object in view, who can tell <HI>how
oft he hath offended?</HI> In no article of reli∣gion
or morals are men more culpably re∣miss
than in the unrestrained indulgence
they give to fancy; and that too, for most
part, without remorse. Since the time that
Reason began to exert her powers, Thought,
during our waking hours, has been active
in every breast, without a moment's sus∣pension
or pause. The current of ideas
has been always flowing. The wheels of
the spiritual engine have circulated with
perpetual motion. Let me ask what has
been the fruit of this incessant activity with
the greatest part of mankind? Of the in∣numerable
hours that have been employed
in thought, how few are marked with any
permanent or useful effect? How many
have either passed away in idle dreams; or
have been abandoned to anxious discon∣tented
musings, to unsocial and malignant
passions, or to irregular and criminal de∣sires?
Had I power to lay open that store∣house
of iniquity which the hearts of too
many conceal; could I draw out and read
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
of them a list of all imaginations they
have devised, and all the passions they have
indulged in secret; what a picture of men
would I present to themselves? What crimes
would they appear to have perpetrated in
fancy, which to their most intimate com∣panions
they durst not reveal?</P>
<P>Even when men imagine their thoughts
to be innocently employed, they too com∣monly
suffer them to run out into extrava∣gant
imaginations, and chimerical plans of
what they would wish to attain, or chuse to
be, if they could frame the course of things
according to their desire. Though such
employments of fancy come not under the
same description with those which are plainly
criminal, yet wholly unblameable they sel∣dom
are. Besides the waste of time which
they occasion, and the misapplication which
they indicate of those intellectual powers
that were given to us for much nobler pur∣poses,
such romantic speculations lead us
always into the neighbourhood of forbid∣den
regions. They place us on dangerous
ground. They are for the most part con∣nected
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
with some one bad passion; and
they always nourish a giddy and frivolous
turn of thought. They unfit the mind for
applying with vigour to rational pursuits,
or for acquiescing in sober plans of conduct.
From that ideal world in which it allows
itself to dwell, it returns to the commerce
of men, unbent and relaxed, sickly and
tainted, averse from discharging the duties,
and sometimes disqualified even for relish∣ing
the pleasures of ordinary life. <HI>O Jeru∣salem!

How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within
thee?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerem. iv. 14.</NOTE>—In order to guard against all
such corruptions and abuses of thought as I
have mentioned, it may be profitable to at∣tend
to the following rules.</P>
<P>IN the first place, study to acquire the
habit of attention to thought. No study in
more important; for in proportion to the
degree in which this habit is possessed, such
commonly is the degree of intellectual im∣provement.
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
It is the power of attention
which in a great measure distinguishes the
wise and the great from the vulgar and
trifling herd of men. The latter are ac∣customed
to think, or rather to dream, with∣out
knowing the subject of their thoughts.
In their unconnected rovings, they pursue
no end; they follow no tract. Every thing
floats loose and disjointed on the surface of
their mind; like leaves scattered and blown
about on the face of the waters.</P>
<P>In order to lead your thoughts into any
useful direction, your first care must be, to
acquire the power of fixing them, and of
restraining their irregular motions. Inure
yourselves to form a plan of proper medi∣tation;
to pursue it steadily; and with se∣vere
authority to keep the door shut against
intrusions of wandering fancy. Let your
mind, for this purpose, become a frequent
object to itself. Let your thoughts be made
the subjects of thought and review.—“To
what is my attention at present directed?
Could I disclose it without a blush to the
world? Were God instantly to call me
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
into judgment, what account could I give
of it to him? Shall I be the wiser or the
better for dwelling on such thoughts as
now fill my mind? Are they entirely
consistent with my innocence, and with
my present and future peace? If they
are not, to what purpose do I indulge
such unprofitable or dangerous musings?”
—By frequent exercise of his inward scru∣tiny,
we might gradually bring imagination
under discipline, and turn the powers of
thought to their proper use as means of im∣provement,
instead of suffering them to be
only the instruments of vanity and guilt.</P>
<P>IN the second place, in order to the go∣vernment
of thought, it is necessary to guard
against idleness. Idleness is the great fo∣menter
of all corruptions in the human
heart. In particular, it is the parent of
loose imaginations and inordinate desires.
The ever active and restless power of thought,
if not employed about what is good, will
naturally and unavoidably engender evil.
Imagine not that mere occupation, of what∣ever
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
ever kind it be, will exempt you from the
blame and danger of an idle life. Perhaps
the worst species of idleness is a dissipated,
though seemingly busy life, spent in the
haunts of loose society, and in the chace of
perpetual amusement. Hence a giddy mind,
alternately elated and dejected with trifles,
occupied with no recollection of the past
but what is fruitless, and with no plans for
the future but what are either frivolous or
guilty.</P>
<P>As, therefore, you would govern your
thoughts, or indeed as you would have any
thoughts that are worthy of being governed,
provide honourable employment for the
native activity of your minds. Keep know∣ledge,
virtue, and usefulness, ever in view.
Let your life proceed in a train of such pur∣suits
as are worthy of a Christian, of a ra∣tional
and a social being. While these are
regularly carried on as the main business of
life, let amusement possess no more than its
proper place in the distribution of your time.
Take particular care that your amusements
be of an irreproachable kind, and that all
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
your society be either improving or inno∣cent.
So shall the stream of your thoughts
be made to run in a pure channel. Manly
occupations and virtuous principles will ex∣pel
the taint which idleness never fails to
communicate to the vacant mind.</P>
<P>IN the third place, when criminal thoughts
arise, attend to all the proper methods of
speedily suppressing them. Take example
from the unhappy industry which sinners
discover in banishing good ones, when a
natural sense of religion forces them on their
conscience. How anxiously do they fly
from themselves? how studiously do they
drown the voice which upbraids them in
the noise of company or diversion? what
numerous artifices do they employ to evade
the uneasiness which returns of reflexion
would produce?—Were we to use equal
diligence in preventing the entrance of vi∣cious
suggestions, or in repelling them when
entered, why should we not be equally suc∣cessful
in a much better cause?—As soon as
you are sensible that any dangerous passion
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
begins to ferment, instantly call in other
passions, and other ideas, to your aid.
Hasten to turn your thoughts into a differ∣ent
direction. Summon up whatever you
have found to be of power for composing
and harmonizing your mind. Fly for as∣sistance
to serious studies, to prayer and
devotion; or even fly to business or inno∣cent
society, if solitude be in hazard of fa∣vouring
the seduction. By such means you
may stop the progress of the growing evil.
You may apply an antidote, before the
poison has had time to work its full effect.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, it will be particularly
useful to impress your minds with a habitual
sense of the presence of the Almighty. When
we reflect what a strong check the belief of
divine omniscience is calculated to give to
all criminal thoughts, we are tempted to
suspect, that even by Christians this article
of faith is not received with sincere convic∣tion.
For who but must confess, that if he
knew a parent, a friend, or a neighbour, to
have the power of looking into his heart,
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
he durst not allow himself that unbounded
scope which he now gives to his imagination
and desire? Whence, then, comes it to pass,
that men, without fear or concern, bring into
the presence of the awful majesty of Heaven
that folly and licentiousness of thought
which would make them blush and tremble,
if one of their own fellow-creatures could
desery? At the same time, no principle is
supported by clearer evidence than the om∣niscience
of God. All religious sects have
admitted it. All societies of men, in their
oaths and covenants, appeal to it. The
soverign of the universe cannot but know
what passes throughout his dominions. He
who supports all nature must needs pervade
and fill it. He who formed the heart is
certainly conscious to what passes within it.</P>
<P>Never let this great article of faith escape
from your view. In thinking, as well as
in acting, accustom yourselves to look up
with reverence to that piercing eye of di∣vine
observation which <HI>never slumbers nor
sleeps.</HI> Behold a pen always writing over
your head, and making up that great re∣cord
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
of your thoughts, words, and actions,
from which at last you are to be judged.
Think that you are never less alone than
when by yourselves; for then is He still
with you, whose inspection is of greater
consequence than that of all mankind.
Let these awful considerations not only
check the dissipation of corrupt fancy, but
infuse into your spirits that solemn com∣posure
which is the parent of meditation
and wisdom. Let them not only expel
what is evil, but introduce in its stead what
is pure and holy; elevating your thoughts
to divine and eternal objects, and acting as
the counterpoise to those attractions of the
world, which would draw your whole at∣tention
downwards to sense and vanity.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING treated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. III.</NOTE> in the foregoing
discourse, of the government of the
thoughts, I proceed to consider the govern∣ment
of the passions, as the next great duty
included in the <HI>keeping of the heart.</HI></P>
<P>Passions are strong emotions of the mind,
occasioned by the view of apprehended
good or evil. They are original parts of
the constitution of our nature; and there∣fore,
to extirpate them is a mistaken aim.
Religion requires no more of us than to
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
moderate and rule them. When our bles∣sed
Lord assumed the nature, without the
corruption, of man, he was subject to like
passions with us. On some occasions he
felt the risings of anger. He was often
touched with pity. He was <HI>grieved in spi∣rit;</HI>
he sorrwed and he wept.</P>
<P>Passions, when properly directed, may
be subservient to every useful ends. They
rouze the dormant powers of the soul.
They are even found to exalt them. They
often raise a man above himself, and ren∣der
him more penetrating, vigorous, and
masterly, than he is in his calmer hours.
Actuated by some high passion, he conceives
great designs, and surmounts all difficulties
in the execution. He is inspired with more
lofty sentiments, and endowed with more
persuasive utterance, than he possesses at
any other time. Passions are the active
forces of the soul. They are its highest
powers brought into movement and exer∣tion.
But, like all other great powers, they
are either useful or destructive, according to
their direction and degree: as wind and
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
are instrumental in carrying on many
of the beneficent operations of nature; but
when they rise to undue violence, or devi∣ate
from their proper course, their path is
marked with ruin.</P>
<P>It is the present infelicity of human na∣ture,
that those strong emotions of the mind
are become too powerful for the principle
which ought to regulate them. This is one
of the unhappy consequences of our apos∣tacy
from God, that the influence of rea∣son
is weakened, and that of passion
strengthened, within the heart. When man
revolted from his Maker, his passions re∣belled
against himself; and from being
originally the instruments of reason, have
become the tyrants of the soul. Hence, in
treating of this subject, two things may be
assumed as principles: first, that through
the present weakness of the understanding,
our passions are often directed towards im∣proper
objects; and next, that even when
their direction is just, and their objects are
innocent, they perpetually tend to run into
excess: they always hurry us towards their
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
gratification with a blind and dangerous
impetuosity. On these two points then
turns the whole government of our passions:
first, to ascertain the proper objects of their
pursuit; and next, to restrain them in that
pursuit when they would carry us beyond
the bounds of reason. If there be any pas∣sion
which intrudes itself unseasonably into
our mind, which darkens and troubles our
judgment, or habitually discomposes our
temper; which unfits us for properly dis∣charging
the duties, or disqualifies us for
cheerfully enjoying the comforts of life,
we may certainly conclude it to have gained
a dangerous ascendant. The great object
which we ought to propose to ourselves is,
to acquire a firm and stedfast mind, which
the infatuation of passion shall not seduce,
nor its violence shake; which, resting on
fixed principles, shall, in the midst of con∣tending
emotions, remain free, and master
of itself; able to listen calmly to the voice
of conscience, and prepared to obey its dic∣tates
without hesitation.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="65"/>
To obtain, if possible, such command of
passion, is one of the highest attainments
of the rational nature. Arguments to show
its importance crowd upon us from every
quarter. If there be any fertile source of
mischief to human life, it is, beyond doubt,
the misrule of passion. It is this which
poisons the enjoyment of individuals, over∣turns
the order of society, and strews the
path of life with so many miseries, as to
render it indeed the valley of tears. All
those great scenes of public calamity, which
we behold with astonishment and horrour,
have originated from the source of violent
passions. These have overspread the earth
with bloodshed. These have pointed the
assassin's dagger, and filled the poisoned
bowl. These, in every age, have fur∣nished
too copious materials for the orator's
pathetic declamation, and for the poet's tra∣gical
song.</P>
<P>When from public life we descend to pri∣vate
conduct, though passion operate not
there in such a wide and destructive sphere,
we shall find its influence to be no less baneful.
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
I need not mention the black and
fierce passions, such as envy, jealousy, and
revenge, whose effects are obviously nox∣ious,
and whose agitations are Immediate
misery. But take any of the licentious and
sensual kind. Suppose it to have unlimited
scope; trace it throughout its course; and
you will find that gradually, as it rises, it
taints the soundness, and troubles the peace
of his mind over whom it reigns; that in
its progress it engages him in pursuits which
are marked either with danger or with
shame; that in the end it wastes his for∣tune,
destroys his health, or debases his
character; and aggravates all the miseries
in which it has involved him with the con∣cluding
pangs of bitter remorse. Through
all the stages of this fatal course, how many
have heretofore run? What multitudes do
we daily behold pursuing it, with blind and
headlong steps?</P>
<P>But, on the evils which flow from unre∣strained
passions, it is needless to enlarge.
Hardly are there any so ignorant or incon∣siderate
as not to admit, that where passion
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
is allowed to reign, both happiness and vir∣tue
must suffer. I proceed therefore to
what is of more consequence, to suggest
some directions which may be useful in
assisting us to preserve the government of
our passions.</P>
<P>IN the first place, we must study to ac∣quire
just views of the comparative import∣ance
of those objects that are most ready to
attract desire. The erroneous opinions
which we form concerning happiness and
misery, give rise to all the mistaken and
dangerous passions which embroil our life.
We suffer ourselves to be dazzled by unreal
appearances of pleasure. We follow, with
precipitancy, whithersoerver the crowd
leads. We admire, without examination,
what our predecessors have admired. We
fly from every shadow at which we see
others tremble. Thus, agitated by vain
fears and deceitful hopes, we are hurried
into eager contests about objects which are
in themselves of no value. By rectifying our
opinions, we would strike at the root
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
of the evil. If our vain imaginations were
chastened, the tumult of our passions would
subside.</P>
<P>It is observed, that the young and the
ignorant are always the most violent in
pursuit. The knowledge which is forced
upon them by longer acquaintance with the
world, moderates their impetuosity. Study
then to anticipate, by reflexion, that know∣ledge
which experience often purchases at
too dear a price. Inure yourselves to fre∣quent
consideration of the emptiness of
those pleasures which excite so much strife
and commotion among mankind. Think
how much more of true enjoyment is lost
by the violence of passion, than by the want
of those things which give occasion to that
passion. Persuade yourselves that the fa∣vour
of God and the possession of virtue
form the chief happiness of the rational
nature. Let a contented mind, and a
peaceful life, hold the next place in your
estimation. These are the conclusions
which the wise and thinking part of man∣kind
have always formed. To these con∣clusions,
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
after having run the race of pas∣sion,
you will probably come at the last.
By forming them betimes, you would make
a seasonable escape from that tempestuous
region, through which none can pass with∣out
suffering misery, contracting guilt, and
undergoing severe remorse.</P>
<P>IN the second place, in order to attain
the command of passion, it is requisite to
acquire the power of self-denial. The self∣denial
of a Christian consists not in perpe∣tual
austerity of life, and universal renun∣ciation
of the innocent comforts of the
world. Religion requires no such unne∣cessary
sacrifices, nor is any such foe to
present enjoyment. It consists in our being
ready, on proper occasions, to abstain from
pleasure, or to submit to suffering, for the
sake of duty and conscience, or from a view
to some higher and more extensive good.
If we possess not this power, we shall be
the prey of every loose inclination that
chances to arise. Pampered by continual
indulgence, all our passions will become
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
mutinous and headstrong. Desire, not rea∣son,
will be the ruling principle of our
conduct.</P>
<P>As, therefore, you would keep your pas∣sions
within due bounds, you must betimes
accustom them to know the reins. You
must not wait till some critical occasion for
the exercise of self-denial occur. In vain
you will attempt to act with authority, if
your first essay be made when temptation
has inflamed the mind. In cooler hours,
you must sometimes abridge your enjoy∣ment
even of what is innocent. In the
midst of lawful pleasure, you must main∣tain
moderation, abstemiousness, and self∣command.
The observance of this disci∣pline
is the only method of supporting rea∣son
in its proper ascendant. For if you
allow yourselves always to stretch to the
utmost point of innocence and safety, be∣yond
that point you will infallibly be hur∣ried,
when passion shall arise in its might
to shake the heart.</P>
<P>IN the third place, impress your minds
deeply with this persuasion, that nothing is
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
what it appears to be when you are under
the power of passion. Be assured, that no
judgment which you then form can be in
the least depended upon as sound or true.
The fumes which arise from a heart boiling
with violent passions, never fail to darken
and trouble the understanding. When the
gourd withered, under the shade of which
the prophet Jonah reposed, his mind, al∣ready
ruffled by the disappointment of his
predictions, lost, on occasion of this slight
incident, all command of itself; and in the
midst of his impatience, he <HI>wished to die
rather than to live.</HI> Instead of being calmed
by that expostulating voice, <HI>Dost thou well,
O Jonah! to be angry because of the gourd?</HI>
he replied with great emotion, <HI>I do well to
be angry even unto death.</HI> But did Jonah
think so when his passion had abated? Do
these sentiments bear the least resemblance
to that humble and devout prayer which,
on another occasion, when in his calm mind,
he put up to God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jonah ii.</NOTE>? No two persons can
differ more from each other, than the same
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
person differs from himself, when agitated
by passion, and when master of his reason.
<HI>I do well to be angry,</HI> is the language of
every man when his mind is inflamed.
Every passion justifies itself. It brings in a
thousand pretences to its aid. It borrows
many a false colour to hide its deformity.
It possesses a sort of magic, by which it can
magnify or diminish objects at pleasure,
and transform the appearance of every thing
within its sphere.</P>
<P>Let the knowledge of this imposture which
passion practises, place you continually on
your guard. Let the remembrance of it
be ever at hand, to check the extravagant
judgments which you are apt to pass in
those moments of delusion. Listen to no
suggestion which then arises. Form no
conclusions on which you are to act. As∣sure
yourselves that every thing is beheld
through a false medium. Have patience
for a little, and the illusion will vanish;
the atmosphere will clear up around you,
and objects return to be viewed in their
native colours and just dimensions.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="73"/>
IN the fourth place, oppose early the be∣ginnings
of passion. Avoid particularly all
such objects as are apt to excite passions
which you know to predominate within
you. As soon as you find the tempest rising,
have recourse to every proper method, ei∣ther
of allaying its violence, or of escaping
to a calmer shore. Hasten to call up emo∣tions
of an opposite nature. Study to con∣quer
one passion by means of some other
which is of less dangerous tendency. Never
account any thing small or trivial which is
in hazard of introducing disorder into your
heart. Never make light of any desire
which you feel gaining such progress as to
threaten entire dominion. Blandishing it
will appear at the first. As a gentle and
innocent emotion, it may steal into the
heart; but as it advances, is likely to <HI>pierce
you through with many sorrows.</HI> What you
indulged as a favourite amusement, will
shortly become a serious business; and in
the end may prove the burden of your life.
Most of our passions flatter us in their rise.
But their beginnings are treacherous; their
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
growth is imperceptible; and the evils which
they carry in their train lie concealed, until
their dominion is established. What Solo∣mon
says of one of them, holds true of them
all, that their <HI>beginning is as when one letteth
out water</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvii. 14.</NOTE>. It issues from a small chink,
which once might have been easily stopped;
but being neglected, it is soon widened by
the stream; till the bank is at last totally
thrown down, and the flood is at liberty to
deluge the whole plain.</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, the excess of every
passion will be moderated by frequent me∣ditation
on the vanity of the world, the
short continuance of life, the approach of
death, judgment, and eternity. The ima∣ginary
degree of importance which the ne∣glect
of such meditation suffers us to bestow
on temporal things, is one great cause of
our vehemence in desire, and our eagerness
in pursuit. We attach ourselves to the ob∣jects
around us, as if we could enjoy them
for ever. Higher and more enlarged pro∣spects
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
of the destination of man would na∣turally
cool this misplaced ardour. For
what can appear so considerable in human
affairs, as to discompose or agitate the mind
of him to whose view eternity lies open, and
all the greatness of the universe of God?
How contemptible will seem to him this
hurry of spirits, this turmoil of passion,
about things which are so soon to end?—
Where are they who once disturbed the
world with the violence of their contests,
and filled it with the renown of their ex∣ploits?
What now remains of their designs
and enterprises, of their passions and pur∣suits,
of their triumphs and their glory?
The flood of time has passed over them,
and swept them away, as if they had never
been. The <HI>fashion of the world</HI> changes
continually around us. We succeed one
another in the human course, like troops
of pilgrims on their journey. Absurdly we
spend our time in contending about the
trifles of a day, while we ought to be pre∣paring
for a higher existence. Eternity is
just as band to close this introductory seene.
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
It is fast rolling towards us, like the tide
of a vast ocean, ready to swallow up all
human concerns, and to leave no trace be∣hind
it, except the consequences of our good
or bad deeds, which shall last for ever.—
Let such reflections allay the heat of passion.
Let them reduce all human things to their
proper standard. From frivolous pursuits
let them recal our attention to objects of
real importance; to the proper business of
man; to the improvement of our nature,
the discharge of our duty, the rational and
religious conduct of human life.</P>
<P>IN the last place, to our own endeavours
for regulating our passions, let us join ear∣nest
prayer to God. Here, if any where,
divine assistance is requisite. For such is
the present blindness and imperfection of
human nature, that even to discover all the
disorders of our heart is become difficult;
much more, to rectify them, is beyond our
power. To that superior aid, then, which
is promised to the pious and upright, let us
look up with humble minds; beseeching
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
the Father of mercies, that, while we study
to act our own part with resolution and
vigilance, he would forgive our returning
weakness; would strengthen our constancy
in resisting the assaults of passion; and enable
us by his grace so to govern our minds, that
without considerable interruptions we may
proceed in a course of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>IT now remains to treat of the govern∣ment
of temper, as included in the <HI>keeping
of the heart.</HI> Passions are quick and strong
emotions, which by degrees subside. Tem∣per
is the disposition which remains after
these emotions are past, and which forms
the habitual propensity of the soul. The
one are like the stream when it is swoln by
the torrent, and ruffled by the winds. The
other resembles it when running within its
bed, with its natural velocity and force.
The influence of temper is more silent and
imperceptible than that of passion. It ope∣rates
with less violence; but as its operation
is constant, it produces effects no less con∣siderable.
It is evident, therefore, that it
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
highly deserves to be considered in a reli∣gious
view.</P>
<P>Many, indeed, are averse to behold it in
this light. They place a good temper upon
the same footing with a healthy constitu∣tion
of body. They consider it as a natural
felicity which some enjoy; but for the want
of which, others are not morally culpable,
nor accountable to God; and hence the
opinion has sometimes prevailed, that a bad
temper might be consistent with a state of
grace. If this were true, it would overturn
that whole doctrine, of which the gospel is
so full, that regeneration, or change of na∣ture,
is the essential characteristic of a Chris∣tian.
It would suppose that grace might
dwell amidst malevolence and rancour, and
that heaven might be enjoyed by such as
are strangers to charity and love.—It will
readily be admitted, that some, by the ori∣ginal
frame of their mind, are more favour∣ably
inclined than others towards certain
good dispositions and habits. But this af∣fords
no justification to those who neglect
to oppose the corruptions to which they are
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
prone, Let no man imagine that the hu∣man
heart is a soil altogether unsusceptible
of culture; or that the worst temper may
not, through the assistance of grace, be re∣formed
by attention and discipline. Settled
depravity of temper is always owing to our
own indulgence. If, in place of checking,
we nourish that malignity of disposition to
which we are inclined, all the consequences
will be placed to our account, and every
excuse from natural constitution be rejected
at the tribunal of Heaven.</P>
<P>The proper regulation of temper affects
the character of man in every relation which
he bears; and includes the whole circle of
religious and moral duties. This, therefore,
is a subject of too great extent to be com∣prehended
in one discourse. But it may be
useful to tike a general view of it; and, be∣fore
we conclude the doctrine of <HI>keeping the
heart,</HI> to shew what the habitual temper of
a good man ought to be, with respect to
God, to his neighbour, and to himself.</P>
<P>FIRST, with respect to God, what he
ought to cultivate is a devout temper. This
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
imports more than the care of perform∣ing
the offices of religious worship. It
denotes that sensibility of heart towards
the Supreme Being, which springs from
a deep impression of his perfections on
the soul. It stands opposed, not only
to that disregard of God which forms
the description of the impious, but to
that absence of religious affections which
sometimes prevails among those who are
imperfectly good. They acknowledge, per∣haps,
the obligations of duty. They feel
some concern to <HI>work out their salvation.</HI>
But they apply to their duty through mere
constraint; and serve God without affection
or complacency, More liberal and gene∣rous
sentiments animate the man who is of
devout temper. God dwells upon his
thoughts as a benefactor and a father, to
whose voice he hearkens with joy. Amidst
the occurrences of life, his mind naturally
opens to the admiration of his wisdom, the
reverence of his power, the love of his
transcendent goodness. All nature appears
to his view as stamped with the impress of
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
these perfections. Habitual gratitude to
his Maker for mercies past, and cheerful
resignation to this will in all time to come,
are the native effusions of his heart.</P>
<P>Such a temper as this deserves to be cul∣tivated
with the utmost attention; for it
contributes, in a high degree, both to our
improvement and our happiness. It resines,
and it exalts human nature. It softens that
hardness which our hearts are ready to con∣tract
from frequent intercourse with this
rugged world. It facilitates the discharge
of every duty towards God and man. At
the same time it is a temper peaceful and
serene, elevated and rejoicing. It forms
the current of our affections to flow in a
placid tenour. It opens pleasing prospects
to the mind. It banishes harsh and bitter
passions; and places us above the reach of
many of the annoyances of worldly life.
When the temper is truly devout, <HI>the peace
of God which passeth understanding keepeth
the heart and soul.</HI> I proceed,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, to point out the proper state
of our temper with respect to one another.
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
It is evident, in the general, that if we
consult either public welfare or private
happiness, Christian charity ought to regu∣late
our disposition in mutual intercourse.
But as this great principle admits of several
diversified appearances, let us consider some
of the chief forms under which it ought to
show itself in the usual tenour of life. Uni∣versal
benevolence to mankind, when it
rests in the abstract, is a loose indetermi∣nate
idea, rather than a principle of real
effect; and too often floats as an useless
speculation in the head, instead of affecting
the temper and the heart.</P>
<P>What, first, presents itself to be recom∣mended
is a peaceable temper; a disposi∣tion
averse to give offence, and desirous of
cultivating harmony, and amicable inter∣course
in society. This supposes yielding
and condescending manners, unwillingness
to contend with others about trifles, and,
in contests that are unavoidable, proper
moderation of spirit. Such a temper is the
first principle of self-enjoyment. It is the
basis of all order and happiness among
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
mankind. The positive and contentious,
the rude and quarrelsome, are the bane of
society. They seem destined to blast the
small share of comfort which nature has
here allotted to man. But they cannot dis∣turb
the peace of others, more than they
break their own. The hurricane rages first
in their own bosom, before it is let forth
upon the world. In the tempests which
they raise, they are always tost; and fre∣quently
it is their lot to perish.</P>
<P>A peaceable temper must be supported by
a candid one, or a disposition to view the
conduct of others with fairness and impar∣tiality.
This stands opposed to a jealous
and suspicious temper, which ascribes every
action to the worst motive, and throws a
black shade over every character. As you
would be happy in yourselves, or in your
connections with others, guard against this
malignant spirit. Study that charity <HI>which
thinketh no evil;</HI> that temper which, with∣out
degenerating into credulity, will dispose
you to be just; and which can allow you
to observe an error, without imputing it as
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
a crime. Thus you will be kept free from
that continual irritation which imaginary
injuries raise in a suspicious breast; and will
walk among men as your brethren, not
your enemies.</P>
<P>But to be peaceable, and to be candid,
is not all that is required of a good man.
He must cultivate a kind, generous, and
sympathizing temper, which feels for dis∣tress,
wherever it is beheld; which enters
into the concerns of his friends with ar∣dour;
and to all with whom he has inter∣course
is gentle, obliging, and humane.
How amiable appears such a disposition,
when contrasted with a malicious or envi∣ous
temper, which wraps itself up in its
own narrow interests, looks with an evil
eye on the success of others, and with an
unnatural satisfaction feeds on their disap∣pointments
or miseries! How little does
he know of the true happiness of life, who
is a stranger to that intercourse of good
offices and kind affections, which, by a
pleasing charm, attach men to one another,
and circulate joy from heart to heart!</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85"/>
You are not to imagine that a benevo∣lent
temper finds no exercise, unless when
opportunities offer of performing actions of
high generosity, or of extensive utility.
These may seldom occur. The condition
of the greater part of mankind, in a good
measure, precludes them. But in the or∣dinary
round of human affairs, a thousand
occasions daily present themselves of miti∣gating
the vexations which others suffer, of
soothing their minds, of aiding their in∣terest,
of promoting their cheerfulness, or
ease. Such occasions may relate to the
smaller incidents of life. But let us re∣member
that of small incidents the system
of human life is chiefly composed. The
attentions which respect these, when sug∣gested
by real benignity of temper, are
often more material to the happiness of
those around us, than actions which carry
the appearance of greater dignity and splen∣dour.
No wise or good man ought to ac∣count
any rules of behaviour as below his
regard, which tend to cement the great
brotherhood of mankind in comfortable
union.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="86"/>
Particularly in the course of that fami∣liar
intercourse which belongs to domestic
life, all the virtues of temper find an ample
range. It is very unfortunate, that within
that circle, men too often think themselves
at liberty to give unrestrained vent to the
caprice of passion and humour. whereas
there, on the contrary, more than any
where, it concerns them to attend to the
government of their heart; to check what
is violent in their tempers, and to soften
what is harsh in their manners. For there
the temper is formed. There, the real
character displays itself. The forms of the
world disguise men when abroad. But
within his own family, every man is known
to be what he truly is.—In all our inter∣course,
then, with others, particularly in
that which is closest and most intimate, let
us cultivate a peaceable, a candid, a gentle
and friendly temper. This is the temper
to which, by repeated injunctions, our holy
religion seeks to form us. This was the
temper of Christ. This is the temper of
Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87"/>
WE are now to consider, thirdly, the
proper state of temper, as it respects the
individual himself. The basis of all the
good dispositions which belong to this head,
is humility. By this I understand, not that
meanness of spirit which leads a man to
undervalue himself, and to sink below his
rank and character; but what the scripture
expresses with great propriety, when it ex∣horts
<HI>every man, not to think of himself more
highly than be ought to think, out to think
soberly</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 3.</NOTE>. He who adopts all the flattering
suggestions of self-love, and forms claims
upon the world proportioned to the ima∣ginary
opinion which he has conceived of
his merit, is preparing for himself a thou∣sand
mortisications. Whereas by checking
the risings of ill-founded vanity, and re∣treating
within those bounds which a mo∣derate
estimation of our character pre∣scribes,
we escape the miseries which always
pursue an arrogant mind, and recommend
ourselves to the favour both of God and
man.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="88"/>
Hence will naturally arise a contented
temper, which is one of the greatest bles∣sings
that can be enjoyed by man, and one
of the most material requisites to the pro∣per
discharge of the duties of every station.
For a fretful and discontented temper ren∣ders
one incapable of performing aright any
part in life. It is unthankful and impious
towards God; and towards men, provok∣ing
and unjust. It is a gangrene which
preys on the vitals, and infects the whole
constitution with disease and putrefaction.
Subdue pride and vanity, and you will
take the most effectual method of eradicat∣ing
this distemper. You will no longer
behold the objects around you with jaun∣diced
eyes. You will take in good part
the blessings which Providence is pleased to
bestow, and the degree of favour which
your fellow-creatures are disposed to grant
you. Viewing yourselves, with all your
imperfections and failings, in a just light,
you will rather be surprised at your enjoy∣ing
so many good things, than discontented
because there are any which you want.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="89"/>
From a humble and contented temper
will spring a cheerful one. This, if not
in itself a virtue, is at least the garb in
which virtue should be always arrayed.
Piety and goodness ought never to be mark∣ed
with that dejection which sometimes
takes rise from superstition, but which is
the proper portion only of guilt. At the
same time, the cheerfulness belonging to
virtue is to be carefully distinguished from
that light and giddy temper which charac∣terizes
folly, and is so often found among
the dissipated and vicious part of mankind.
Their gaiety is owing to a total want of
reflexion; and brings with it the usual con∣sequences
of an unthinking habit, shame,
remorse, and heaviness of heart, in the end.
The cheerfulness of a well-regulated mind,
springs from a good conscience and the fa∣vour
of heaven, and is bounded by tem∣perance
and reason. It makes a man
happy in himself, and promotes the hap∣piness
of all around him. It is the clear
and calm sunshine of a mind illuminated by
piety and virtue. It crowns all other good
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
dispositions, and comprehends the general
effect which they ought to produce on the
heart.</P>
<P>SUCH, on the whole, is the temper, or
habitual frame of mind, in a good man:
Devout towards God; towards men, peace∣able,
candid, affectionate and humane;
within himself, humble, contented and
cheerful. To the establishment of this hap∣py
temper all the directions which I before
suggested for the due regulation of the
thoughts, and for the government of the
passions, naturally conduce; in this they
ought to issue; and when this temper is
thoroughly formed within us, then may
the heart be esteemed to have been <HI>kept
with all diligence.</HI> That we may be thus
enabled to keep it, for the sake both of pre∣sent
enjoyment and of preparation for
greater happiness, let us earnestly pray to
Heaven. A greater blessing we cannot
implore of the Almighty, than that he
who made the human heart, and who
knows its frailties, would assist us to sub∣ject
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
it to that discipline which religion re∣quires,
which reason approves, but which
his grace alone can enable us to main∣tain.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the UNCHANGEABLENESS of the
DIVINE NATURE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JAMES i. 17.</BIBL>
<Q>Every good and every perfect gift is from
above, and cometh down from the Father
of Lights, with whom is no variableness,
neither shadow of turning.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE divine nature<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IV.</NOTE>, in some views,
attracts our love; in others, com∣mands
our reverence; in all, is entitled to
the highest attention from the human mind.
We never elevate our thoughts, in a pro∣per
manner, towards the Supreme Being,
without returning to our own sphere with
sentiments more improved; and if, at any
time, his greatness oppresses our thoughts,
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
his moral perfections always afford us re∣lief.
His almighty power, his infinite
wisdom and supreme goodness, are sounds
familiar to our cars. In his immutability
we are less accustomed to consider him;
and yet it is this perfection which, perhaps,
more than any other distinguishes the di∣vine
nature from the human; gives com∣plete
energy to all its other attributes, and
entitles it to the highest adoration. For,
hence are derived the regular order of na∣ture
and the stedfastness of the universe.
Hence flows the unchanging tenour of those
laws which, from age to age, regulate the
conduct of mankind. Hence the uniform∣ity
of that government, and the certainty
of those promises, which are the ground of
our trust and security. Goodness could
produce no more than feeble and wavering
hopes, and power would command very
imperfect reverence, if we were left to
suspect that the plans which goodness had
framed might alter, or that the power of
carrying them into execution might de∣crease.
The contemplation of God, there∣fore,
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
as unchangeable in his nature and in
all his perfections, must undoubtedly be
fruitful both of instruction and of consola∣tion
to man. I shall, first, endeavour to
illustrate in some degree the nature of the
divine immutability; and then make ap∣plication
of it to our own conduct.</P>
<P><HI>EVERY good and every perfect gift
cometh down from the Father of Lights.</HI>
The title which in the text is given to the
Deity, carries an elegant allusion to the Sun,
the source of light, the most universal be∣nefactor
of nature, the most regular and
constant of all the great bodies with which
we are acquainted in the universe. Yet
even with the Sun there are certain degrees
of <HI>variableness.</HI> He apparently rises and
sets; he seems to approach nearer to us in
summer, and to retire farther off in win∣ter;
his influence is varied by the seasons,
and his lustre is affected by the clouds.
Whereas with him who is the <HI>Father of
Lights,</HI> of whose everlasting brightness the
glory of the Sun is but a faint image,
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
there is no <HI>shadow of turning,</HI> not the most
distant approach to change. In his being
or essence it is plain that alteration can ne∣ver
take place. For as his existence is de∣rived
from no prior cause, nor dependent
on any thing without himself, his nature
can be influenced by no power, can be
affected by no accident, can be impaired
by no time. From everlasting to everlast∣ing,
he continues the same. Hence it is
said, the <HI>he only hath immortality;</HI> that is,
he possesses it in a manner incommunicable
to all other beings. Eternity is described
as the <HI>high and holy place in which he
dwelleth;</HI> it is a habitation in which none
but the <HI>Father of Lights</HI> can enter. The
name which he taketh to himself is, <HI>I am.</HI>
Of other things, some have been and others
shall be; but this is he <HI>which is, which
was, and which is to come.</HI> All time is his;
it is measured out by him in limited por∣tions
to the various orders of created beings;
but his own existence fills equally every
point of duration; <HI>the first and the last, the
beginning and the end, the same yesterday, to∣day,
and for ever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="96"/>
As in his essence, so in his attributes and
perfections, it is impossible there can be any
change. To imperfect natures only it be∣longs
to improve and to decay. Every al∣teration
which they undergo in their abili∣ties
or dispositions, flows either from inter∣nal
defect, or from the influence if a superior
cause. But as no higher cause can bring
from without any accession to the divine
nature, so within itself it contains no prin∣ciple
of decay. For the same reason that
the self-existent Being was from the begin∣ning
powerful and wise, just and good, he
must continue unalterably so for ever. Hence
with much propriety the divine perfections
are described in scripture by allusions to
those objects to which we ascribe the most
permanent stability. <HI>His righteousness is
like the strong mountains. His mercy is in
the heavens; and his faithfulness reacheth
unto the clouds.</HI> These perfections of the
divine nature differ widely from the human
virtues, which are their faint shadows. The
justice of men is at one time severe, at an∣other
time relenting; their goodness is some∣times
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
consined to a partial fondness for a
few, sometimes runs out into a blind in∣dulgence
towards all. But goodness and
justice are in the Supreme Being calm and
steady principles of action, which, enlight∣ened
by perfect wisdom, and never either
warped by partiality, or disturbed by passion,
persevere in one regular and constant tenor.
Among men they may sometimes break forth
with transient splendour, like those wan∣dering
fires which illuminate for a little the
darkness of the night. But in God they
shine with that uniform brightness, which
we can liken to nothing so much as to the
untroubled, eternal lustre of the highest
heavens.</P>
<P>From this follows, what is chiefly mate∣rial
for us to attend to, that in the course
of his operations towards mankind, in his
counsels and decrees, in his laws, his pro∣mises,
and his threatenings, there is <HI>no va∣riableness
nor shadow of turning</HI> with the
Almighty. <HI>Known to him from the begin∣ning
were all his works.</HI> In the divine idea
the whole system of nature existed, long
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
before the foundations of the earth were laid.
When he said, <HI>Let there be light,</HI> he only
realized the great plan which from everlast∣ing
he had formed in his own mind. Fore∣seen
by him was every revolution which
the course of ages was to produce. what∣ever
the counsels of men can effect was
comprehended in his decree. No new emer∣gency
can arise to surprise him. No agita∣tions
of anger or of sorrow, of fear or of
hope, can shake his mind or influence his
conduct. He rests in the eternal possession
of that supreme beatitude, which neither
the virtues nor the crimes of men can in the
least affect. From a motive of overflowing
goodness, he reared up the universe. As
the eternal lover of righteousness, he rules it.
The whole system of his government is
fixed; his laws are irrevocable; and what
he once loveth, <HI>he loveth to the end.</HI> In
scripture, indeed, he is sometimes said to
<HI>be grieved,</HI> and <HI>to repent.</HI> But such expres∣sions,
it is obvious, are employed from ac∣commodation
to common conception; in
the same manner as when bodily organs are
<PB N="92" REF="99"/>
in other passages ascribed to god. The
scripture, as a rule of life addressed to the
multitude, must make use of the language
of men. The divine nature, represented in
its native sublimity, would have transcended
all human conception. When, upon the
reformation of sinners, God is said to <HI>repent
of the evil</HI> which he had threatened against
them, this intimates no more, than that he
suits his dispensations to the alterations which
take place in the characters of men. His
disposition towards good and evil continues
the same, but varies in its application as its
objects vary; just as the laws themselves,
which are capable of no change of affection,
bring rewards or punishments at different
times to the same person, according as his
behaviour alters. Immutability is indeed so
closely connected with the notion of supreme
perfection, that wherever any rational con∣ceptions
of a Deity have taken place, this
attribute has been ascribed to him. Reason
taught the wise and reflecting in every age
to believe, that, as what is eternal cannot
die, so what is perfect can never vary, and
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
that the great Governor of the universe
could be no other than an unchangeable
Being.</P>
<P>FROM the contemplation of this obvious,
but fundamental truth, let us proceed to
the practical improvement of it. Let us
consider what effect the serious consideration
of it ought to produce on our mind and be∣haviour.</P>
<P>It will be proper to begin this head of dis∣course
by removing an objection which the
doctrine I have illustrated may appear to
form against religious services, and in par∣ticular
against the duty of prayer. To what
purpose, it may be urged, is homage ad∣dressed
to a Being whose purpose is unal∣terably
fixed; to whom <HI>our righteousness
extendeth not;</HI> whom by no arguments we
can persuade, and by no supplications we
can mollify? The objection would have
weight if our religious addresses were de∣signed
to work any alteration on God; ei∣ther
by giving him information of what he
did not know; or by exciting affections
<PB N="94" REF="101"/>
which he did not possess; or by inducing
him to change measures which he had pre∣viously
formed. But they are only crude
and imperfect notions of religion which can
suggest such ideas. The change which our
devotions are intended to make is upon our∣selves,
not upon the Almighty. Their chief
efficacy is derived from the good dispositions
which they raise and cherish in the human
soul. By pouring our pious sentiments and
desires before God, by adoring his perfec∣tion
and confessing our own unworthiness,
by expressing our dependence on his aid,
our gratitude for his past favours, our sub∣mission
to his present will, our trust in his
future mercy, we cultivate such affections
as suit our place and station in the universe,
and are thereby prepared for becoming ob∣jects
of the divine grace. Accordingly fre∣quent
assurances are given us in Scripture,
that the prayers of sincere worshippers, pre∣ferred
through the great Mediator, shall be
productive of the happiest effects. <HI>When
they ask, they shall receive; when they seek,
they shall find; when they knock, it shall be
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
opened to them.</HI> Prayer is appointed to be
the channel for conveying the divine grace
to mankind, because the wisdom of Heaven
saw it to be one of the most powerful means
of improving the human heart.</P>
<P>When religious homage is considered in
this light, as great instrument of spiritual
and moral improvement, all the objections
which scepticism can form from the divine
immutability, conclude with no more force
against prayer, than against every other
mean of improvement which reason has
suggested to man. If prayer be superfluous
because God is unchangeable, we might
upon similar grounds conclude, that it is
needless to labour the earth, to nourish our
bodies, or to cultivate our minds, because
the fertility of the ground, the continuance
of our life, and the degree of our under∣standing,
depend upon an immutable So∣vereign,
and were from all eternity fore∣seen
by him. Such absurd conclusions rea∣son
has ever repudiated. To every plain
and sound understanding it has clearly dic∣tated,
that to explore the unknown purposes
<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
of Heaven belongs not to us; but that He
who decrees the end, certainly requires the
means; and that in the diligent employment
of all the means which can advance either
our temporal or spiritual felicity, the chief
exertions of human wisdom and human
duty consist. Assuming it then for an un∣doubted
principle, that religion is a reason∣able
service, and that, though with the <HI>Fa∣ther
of Lights</HI> there be <HI>no variableness,</HI> the
homage of his creatures is nevertheless for
the wisest reasons required by him, I pro∣ceed
to shew what sentiments the contem∣plation
of divine immutability should raise
in our minds, and what duties it should
chiefly enforce.</P>
<P>I. LET it excite us to admire and adore.
Filled with profound reverence, let us look
up to that Supreme Being who sits from
everlasting on the throne of the universe;
moving all things, but remaining immove∣able
himself; directing every revolution of
the creation, but affected by no revolutions
of events or of time. He beholds the heavens
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
and the earth <HI>wax old as a garment, and
decay like a vesture.</HI> At their appointed pe∣riods
he raises up, or he dissolves worlds.
But amidst all the convulsions of changing
and perishing nature, his glory and felicity
remain unaltered.—The view of great and
stupendous objects in the natural world
strikes the mind with solemn awe. What
veneration, then, ought to be inspired by
the contemplation of an object so sublime
as the eternal and unchangeable ruler of the
universe! The composure and stillness of
thought introduced by such a meditation has
a powerful tendency both to purify and to
elevate the heart. It effaces, for a time,
those trivial ideas, and extinguishes those
low passions which arise from the circle of
vain and passing objects around us. It opens
the mind to all the sentiments of devotion;
and accompanies devotion with that pro∣found
reverence which guards it from every
improper excess. When we consider the
Supreme Being as employed in works of
love; when we think of his condescension
to the human race in sending his Son to
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
dwell on the earth; encouraged by favours
and warmed by gratitude, we are sometimes
in danger of presuming too much on his
goodness, and of indulging a certain fond∣ness
of affection, which is unsuitable to our
humble and dependent state. It is neces∣sary
that He should frequently appear to
our minds in all that majesty with which
the immutability of his nature clothes him;
in order that reverence may be combined
with love, and that a mixture of sacred awe
may chasten the rapturous effusions of warm
devotion. Servile fear, indeed, would crush
the spirit of ingenuous and affectionate ho∣mage.
But that reverence which springs
from elevated conceptions of the divine na∣ture,
has a happy effect in checking the
forwardness of imagination, restraining our
affections within due bounds, and compo∣sing
our thoughts at the same time that it
exalts them.</P>
<P>When, from the adoration of the un∣changeable
perfection of the Almighty, we
return to the view of our own state, the first
sentiment which ought naturally to arise, is
<PB N="99" REF="106"/>
that of self-abasement. We are to
be lifted up by any little distinctions which
we possess; and to fancy ourselves great,
only because there are others whom we con∣sider
as less. But what is man with all his
advantages and boasted powers before the
eternal <HI>Father of Lights?</HI> With God there
is no variableness; with man there is no
stability. Virtue and vice divide the em∣pire
of his mind; and wisdom and solly
alternately rule him. Hence he is change∣able
in his designs, sickle in his friendships,
fluctuating in his whole character. His
life is a series of contradictions. He is one
thing to-day, and another to-morrow;
sometimes obliged by experience to alter his
purpose, and often led to change it through
levity. Variable and unequal himself, he
is surrounded with fleeting objects. He is
placed as in the midst of a torrent, where all
things are rolling by, and nothing keeps its
place. He has hardly time to contemplate
this scene of vicissitude, before he too is
swept away.—Thus circumstanced in him∣self,
and in all the objects with which he is
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
connected, let him be admonished to be
humble and modest. Let the contempla∣tion
of the unchanging glory of his Creator
inspire him with sentiments of due submis∣sion.
Let it teach him to know his proper
place; and check that vanity which is so
ready to betray him into guilt.</P>
<P>Let the same meditation affect him with
a deep sense of what he owes to the good∣ness
of the Deity. His goodness never ap∣pears
in so striking a light, as when viewed
in connexion with his greatness. The de∣scription
which is given of him in the text
calls, in this view, for our particular atten∣tion.
It presents to us the most amiable
union of condescension with majesty, of the
moral with the natural perfections of God,
which can possibly be exhibited to the ima∣gination
of man. <HI>From the Father of Lights,
with whom there is no variableness, neither
shadow of turning, cometh down every good
and perfect gift.</HI> The most independent of
all Beings is represented as the most benefi∣cent.
He who is eternal and immutable,
exalted above all, and incapable of receiving
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
returns from any, is the liberal and un∣wearied
Giver of every thing that is good.
—Let such views of the divine nature not
only call forth gratitude and praise, but
prompt us to imitate what we adore. Let
them shew us that benevolence is divine;
that to stoop from our fancied grandeur in
order to assist and relieve one another, is so
far from being any degradation of character,
that it is our truest honour, and our nearest
resemblance to <HI>the Father of Lights.</HI></P>
<P>II. LET the consideration of the divine
immutability convince us, that the method
of attaining the favour of Heaven is one
and invariable. Were the Almighty a ca∣pricious
and inconstant Being, like man,
we should be at a loss what tenour of con∣duct
to hold. In order to conciliate his
grace, we might think of applying some∣times
to one supposed principle of his incli∣nation,
sometimes to another; and bewil∣dered
amidst various attempts, would be
overwhelmed with dismay. The guilty
would essay to flatter him. The timid,
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
sometimes by austere mortifications, some∣times
by costly gifts, sometimes by obse∣quious
rites, would try to appease him.
Hence, in fact, have arisen all the corrup∣tions
of religious worship among men;
from their forming the divine character
upon their own, and ascribing to the Sove∣reign
of the Universe the mutability of hu∣man
passions. God is represented by the
psalmist David as saying to the wicked, <HI>Thou
thoughtest</HI> that I was altogether such an one
as thyself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm l. 21.</NOTE>. This continues to be the de∣scription
of all the superstitious and enthu∣siastic
sects which, since the days of David,
have sprung up in the world.</P>
<P>It is our peculiar happiness under the go∣spel
to have God revealed to us in his ge∣nuine
character, as <HI>without variableness or
shadow of turning.</HI> We know that at no
time there is any change, either in his af∣fections,
or in the plan of his administra∣tion.
One light always shines upon us
from above. One clear and direct path is
always pointed out to man. The Supreme
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
Being is, and was, and ever will be, the
supporter of order and virtue; <HI>the righteous
Lord loving righteousness.</HI> The external
forms of religion may vary; but under all
dispensations which proceed from God, its
substance is the same. It tends continually
to one point, the purification of man's heart
and life. This was the object of the ori∣ginal
law of nature. This was the scope of
the Mosaic institution amidst all its sacrifices
and rites; and this is unquestionably the
end of the gospel. So invariably constant
is God to this purpose, that the dispensation
of mercy in Christ Jesus, which admits of
the vicarious atonement and righteousness
of a Redeemer, makes no change in our
obligation to fulfil the duties of a good life.
The Redeemer himself hath taught us, that
to the end of time the moral law continues
in its full force; and that <HI>till heaven and
earth pass away, one jot or tittle shall in no
wise pass from it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 18.</NOTE>. <HI>This is the only institu∣tion
known to men,</HI> whose authority is un∣changing
and constant. Human laws rise
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>
and fall with the empires that gave them
birth. Systems of philosophy vary with the
progress of knowledge and light. Manners,
sentiments, and opinions, alter with the
course of time. But throughout all ages,
and amidst all revolutions, the rule of mo∣ral
and religious conduct is the same. It
partakes of that immutability of the divine
nature, on which it is founded. Such as
it was delivered to the first worshippers of
God, it continues to be, at this day, to us;
and such it shall remain to our posterity for
ever.</P>
<P>III. LET the contemplation of this per∣fection
of the divine nature teach us to
imitate, as far as our frailty will permit,
that constancy and stedfastness which we
adore. All the moral attributes of the Su∣preme
Being, are standards of character
towards which we ought to aspire. But
as in all these perfections there are proper∣ties
peculiar to the divine nature, our endea∣vours
to resemble them are laid under great
restrictions by the dissimilarity between our
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
nature and the divine. With respect to
that attribute which we now consider, the
circumstances are evident which preclude
improper imitation. To man it is fre∣quently
necessary to correct his errours, and
to change his conduct. An attempt, there∣fore,
to continue wholly invariable would,
in our situation, be no other than impru∣dent
and criminal obstinacy. But withal,
the immutable rectitude of the Deity should
lead us to aspire after fixedness of principle
and uniformity in conduct, as the glory of
the rational nature. Impressed with the
sense of that supreme excellence which
results from unchanging goodness, faith∣fulness
and truth, let us become ashamed
of that levity which degrades the human
character. Let us <HI>ponder our paths,</HI> act
upon a well-regulated plan, and remain
consistent with ourselves. Contemplating
the glory of the Father of Lights, let us
aim at being transformed, in some degree,
<HI>into the same image from glory to glory.</HI> Fi∣nally,</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="113"/>
IV. LET the divine immutability become
the ground of confidence and trust to good
men, amidst all the revolutions of this un∣certain
world. This is one of the chief im∣provements
to be made of the subject, and
therefore requires full illustration. There
are three lights in which we may view the
benefit redounding to us from that attribute
of God which we now consider. It assures
us of the constancy of nature; of the regu∣lar
administration of Providence; of the
certain accomplishment of all the divine
promises.</P>
<P>First, it gives us ground to depend on the
constant and uniform course of nature. On
the unchangeableness of God rests the sta∣bility
of the universe. What we call the
laws of nature are no other than the decrees
of the Supreme Being. It is because He is
<HI>without variableness or shadow of turning</HI>
that those laws have continued the same
sance the beginning of the world; that the
Sun so constantly observes his time of rising
and going down; that the seasons annually
return; the tides periodically ebb and flow;
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
the earth yields its fruits at stated intervals;
and the human body and mental powers
advance to maturity by a regular progress.
In all those motions and operations which
are incessantly going on throughout nature,
there is no stop nor interruption; no change
nor innovation; no deflection from their
main scope. The same powerful and steady
hand which pave the first impulse to the
powers of nature, restrains them from ever
exceeding their prescribed line. Hence
arises the chief comfort of our present life.
We find ourselves in a regular and orderly
world. We look forward to a known suc∣cession
of events. We are enabled to form
plans of action. From the cause we calcu∣late
the effect; and from the past, we rea∣son
with confidence concerning the future.</P>
<P>Accustomed from our infancy to this con∣stancy
in nature, we are hardly sensible of
the blessing. Familiarity has the same ef∣fect
here, as in many other enjoyments, to
efface gratitude. But let us, for a moment,
take an opposite view of things. Let us
suppose, that we had any cause to dread
<PB N="108" REF="115"/>
capriciousness or change in the power who
rules the course or nature; any ground to
suspect that, but for one day, the Sun
might not rise, nor the current of the wa∣ters
hold their usual course, nor the laws of
motion and vegetation proceed as we have
been accustomed to behold them. What
dismay would instantly fill all hearts!
what horror would seem to overspread the
whole face of Nature! What part could we
act, or whithe could we run, in the midst
of convulsions which overturned all the
measures we had formed for happiness, or
for safety? The present adobe of man
would then become, as Job describes the
region of the grave, <HI>a land of darkness, as
darkness itself, and the shadow of death;
without any order; and where the light is as
darkness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job x. 22.</NOTE>. With what joy ought we then
to recognize an unvarying and stedfast ruler,
under whose dominion we have no such
disasters to dread; but can depend on the
course of Nature continuing to proceed as
<PB N="109" REF="116"/>
it has ever gone on, until the period shall
arrive of its final dissolution!</P>
<P>BUT though the great laws of Nature be
constant like their Author, yet in the
affairs of men there is much variety and
change. All that regards our present pos∣sessions
and enjoyments was, for wise rea∣sons,
left, in a great measure, uncertain;
and from this uncertainty arises the disterss
of human life. Sensible of the changes to
which we lie open, we look round with
anxious eyes, and eagerly grasp at every
object which appears to promise us secu∣rity.
But in vain is the whole circle of
human things explored with this view.
There is nothing on earth so stable as to
assure us of undisturbed rest, nor so power∣ful
as to afford us constant protection.
Time, death, and change, triumph over all
the labours of men. What we build up,
they incessantly destroy. The public con∣dition
of nations, and the private fortunes of
individuals, are alike subject to reverse.
Life never retains long the same form. Its
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
whole scenery is continually shifting around
us.—Amidst those endless vicissitudes,
what can give any firm consolation, any
satisfying rest to the heart, except the domi∣nion
of a wise and righteous sovereign,
<HI>with whom there is no variableness nor sha∣dow
of turning?</HI> Though all things change,
and we ourselves be involved in the general
mutability, yet as long as there is fixed and
permanent goodness at the head of the uni∣verse
we are assured that the great interests
of all good men shall be safe. That <HI>river</HI>
perpetually flows, <HI>the streams whereof make
glad the city of God.</HI> We know that the
Supreme Being loved righteousness from
the beginning of days, and that he will
continue to love it to the last. Under his
government none of those revolutions hap∣pen
which have place among the kingdoms
of the earth; where princes die and new
sovereigns ascend the throne; new minis∣ters
and new counsels succeed; the whole
face of affairs is changed; and former plans
fall into oblivion. But <HI>the throne of the Lord
is established for ever; and the thoughts of his
<PB N="111" REF="118"/>
heart endure to all generations.</HI> We serve
the same God whom our fathers worship∣ped
and whom our posterity shall adore.
His unchanging dominion comprehends all
events and all ages; establishes a connect∣ing
principle which holds together the past,
the present, and the future; gives stability
to things which in themselves are fluctuat∣ing,
and extracts order from those which
appear most confused. Well may <HI>the earth
rejoice, and the multitude of isles be gald,</HI>
because there reigneth over the universe such
an immutable Lord.</P>
<P>Were you to unhinge this great article
of faith; were you either to <HI>say with the
fool,</HI> that there is <HI>no God,</HI> or to suppose with
the superstitious, that the God who rules
is variable and capricious; you would in∣deed
<HI>lay the axe to the root of the tree,</HI> and
cut down, with one blow, the hope and
security of mankind. For you would then
leave nothing in the whole compass of na∣ture,
but a round of casual and transitory
being; no foundation of trust, no protec∣tion
to the righteous, no stedfast principle
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
to uphold and to regulate the succession of
existence. Instead of that magnificent spec∣tacle
which the world now exhibits, when
beheld in connexion with the divine go∣vernment,
it would then only present to
view, a multitude of short-lived creatures
springing out of the dust, wandering on
the face of the earth without guide or pro∣tector,
struggling for a few years against
the torrent of uncertainty and change;
and then sinking into utter oblivion, and
vanishing like visions of the night. Mys∣terious
obscurity would involve the begin∣ning
of things; disorder would mark their
progress; and the blackness of darkness
would cover their final result. Whereas,
when Faith enables us to discover an uni∣versal
Sovereign, whose power never fails,
and whose wisdom and goodness never
change, the prospect clears up on every
side. A ray from the great source of light
seems to illuminate the whole creation.
Good men discover a parent and a friend.
They attain a fortress in every danger; a
refuge amidst all storms, <HI>a dwelling-place
<PB N="113" REF="120"/>
in all generations.</HI> They are no longer <HI>afraid
of evil tidings. Their heart is fixed, trust∣ing
in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH these reasonings from the un∣changing
tenour of Divine government
cannot but afford much comfort to good
men, their satisfaction, however, becomes
still more complete, when they consider
the explicit promises which are given them
in the word of God. The immutability of
the divine purpose assures them most per∣fectly
of those promises being fulfilled in
due time, how adverse soever circumstances
may at present appear to their accomplish∣ment.
<HI>The strength of Israel is not a man
that he should lie, nor the son of man that he
should repent. Hath he said it, and shall he
not do it? Hath he spoken, and shall he not
make it good?</HI> Men have the command
only of the present time. When that is
suffered to pass, changes may befal, either
in their own state, or in the situation of
things around them, which shall defeat their
best intentions in our behalf, and render all
<PB N="114" REF="121"/>
their promises fruitless. Hence, even set∣ting
aside the danger of human inconstancy,
the confidence which we can repose on any
earthly protector is extremely imperfect.
Man, in his highest glory, is but a reed
floating on the stream of time, and forced
to follow every new direction of the cur∣rent.
but God is <HI>the rock of ages.</HI> All
time is equally in his hands. Intervening
accidents cannot embarrass him; nor any
unforeseen obstacle retard the performance
of his most distant promise. <HI>One day is with
the Lord as a thousand years; and a thou∣sand
years are as one day.</HI> There is no
vicissitude of the human state in which good
men cannot take sanctuary with him as a
sure and abiding friend; the safe conductor
of their pilgrimage here, as well as the eter∣nal
rest of their souls hereafter. All their
patrons may desert them; and all their
friends may die: but <HI>the Lord still lives,
who is their rock; and the most high God,
who is their redeemer.</HI> He hath promised
that he <HI>will not leave them when they are
old, nor forsake them when their strength
<PB N="115" REF="122"/>
faileth;</HI> and that even when <HI>their heart shall
faint, and their flesh fail, he will be the
strength of their heart and their portion for
ever.</HI> His immutability is not only the
ground of trust in him during their own
abode on earth, but gives them the satisfac∣tion
of looking forward to the same wise
and good administration as continued to the
end of time. When departing hence, and
bidding adieu to life, with all its changeful
scenes, they can with comfort and peace
leave their family, their friends, and their
dearest concerns, in the hands of that God
who reigneth for ever; and whose <HI>counte∣nance
shall always behold the upright</HI> with
the same complacency. <HI>My days are like a
shadow that declineth, and I am withered
like the grass. But thou, O Lord, shalt en∣dure
for ever; and thy remembrance to all
generations. The children of thy servants
shall continue; and their seed shall be esta∣blished
before thee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cii. 11, 12, 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH are the benefits which good men
may derive from meditation on God as
<PB N="116" REF="123"/>
<HI>without variableness or shadow of turning.</HI>
It inspires them with sentiments of devout,
humble, and grateful adoration. It points
out to them the unvarying tenour of con∣duct
which they ought to hold; checks their
sickleness and inconstancy; and amidst all
distresses and fears affords them comfort.
The immutability of God is the surest basis
on which their hopes can be built. It is
indeed the pillar on which the whole uni∣verse
rests.—On such serious and solemn
meditations let our thoughts often dwell, in
order to correct that folly and levity which
are so apt to take possession of the human
heart. And if our minds be overawed, and
even depressed, with so high a view of the
divine nature, let them be relieved by the
reflection, that to this unchangeable God
we are permitted to look up through a gra∣cious
Mediator, who, though possessed of
divine perfection, is not unconscious of hu∣man
distress and frailty.</P>

<Q>We have not an high priest which cannot be

but was in all points tempted like as we are,
yet without sin.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN we compare the counsels of
Providence with the plans of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. V.</NOTE>
we find a like difference obtain as in the
works of nature compared with those of art.
The works of art may, at first view, appear
the most finished and beautiful; but when
<PB N="118" REF="125"/>
the eye is assisted to pry into their contexture,
the nicest workmanship is discerned to be
rough and blemished. Whereas the works
of nature gain by the most accurate exami∣nation;
and those which on a superficial
survey appeared defective or rude, the more
intimately they are inspected, discover the
more exact construction and consummate
beauty. In the same manner the systems
of worldly policy, though at first they seem
plausible and profound, soon betray in their
progress the narrowness of the human un∣derstanding;
while those dispensations of
Providence which appeared to furnish ob∣jections
either against the goodness or the
wisdom of Heaven, have, upon a more ex∣tensive
view of their consequences, fre∣quently
afforded the most striking proofs of
both.</P>
<P><HI>God manifested in the flesh</HI> was <HI>to the Jews
a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks, foolish∣ness.</HI>
It contradicted every prepossession
which their confined ideas of religion and
philosophy led them to entertain. If a su∣periour
Being was to interpose for the resto∣ration
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
of a degenerative world, they concluded
that he would certainly appear in celestial
majesty. But <HI>the thoughts of God are not
as the thoughts of men.</HI> The divine wisdom
saw it to be fit that the Saviour of mankind
should <HI>in all things be made like unto those</HI>
whom he came to save. By living as a man
among men, he dispensed instruction in the
most winning manner. He added to in∣struction
the grace and the force of his own
example. He accommodated that example
to the most trying and difficult situations of
human life; and by suffering a painful
death, he both taught men how to suffer
and die, and in that nature which had of∣fended
he offered a solemn expiation to God
for human guilt.</P>
<P>Besides these ends, so worthy of God,
which were accomplished by the incarna∣tion
of Christ, another, of high importance,
is suggested in the text. Human life is to
good men, as well as to others, a state of
suffering and distress. To supply them
with proper consolation and encouragement
during such a state, was one great purpose
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
of the undertaking of Christ. With this
view he assumed the office of their high
priest, or mediator with God; and the en∣couragement
which this office affords them,
will be proportioned to their assured belief,
first of his power, and next of his com∣passion.
His power is set forth in the verse
preceding the text, and the proper argu∣ment
is founded upon it. <HI>Seeing that we
have a great high priest who is passed into
the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold
fast our profession.</HI> But though it be en∣couraging
to know that our high priest
is <HI>the Son of God,</HI> and that he <HI>is passed into
the heavens,</HI> yet these facts alone are not
sufficient to render him the full object of
our confidence. For, as the Apostle after∣wards
observes, it belongs to the character
of a high priest <HI>to be taken from among men,
that he may have compassion on the ignorant,
and them that are out of the way, seeing that
he himself is compassed with infirmity.</HI> In
order then to satisfy us of our high priest's
possessing also the qualifications of mercy
and compassion, we are told that he is <HI>touch∣ed
<PB N="121" REF="128"/>
with the feeling of our infirmities, and
was in all points tempted like as we are.</HI>
The force of this consideration I purpose
now to illustrate. I shall first explain the
facts which are stated in the text, and then
show how from these our Saviour's com∣passion
is to be inferred, and in what man∣ner
it may be accommodated to the conso∣lation
and hope of good men amidst various
exigencies of life.</P>
<P>THE assertion in the text of Christ's be∣ing
<HI>touched with the feeling of our infirmities,</HI>
plainly implies that he had full experience
both of the external distersses, and of the
internal sorrows of human nature. Assum∣ing
a body such as ours, he subjected him∣self
to all the natural consequences of cor∣poreal
frailty. He did not chuse for him∣self
an easy and opulent condition, in order
to glide through the world with the least
molestation. He did not suit his mission to
the upper ranks of mankind chiefly, by
assimilating his state to theirs. But, born
in meanness, and bred up to labour, he
<PB N="122" REF="129"/>
submitted to the inconveniencies of that
poor and toilsome life which falls to the
share of the most numerous part of the hu∣man
race. Whatever is severe in the dis∣regard
of relations or the ingratitude of
friends, in the scorn of the proud or the
insults of the mean, in the virulence of
reproach or the sharpness of pain, was un∣dergone
by Christ. Though his life was
short, he familiarized himself in it with a
wide compass of human woe; and there is
almost no distressful situation to which we
can be reduced, but what he has experi∣enced
before us. There is not the least
reason to imagine that the eminence of his
nature raised him above the sensations of
trouble and grief. Had this been the case,
he would have been a sufferer in appear∣ance
only, not in reality; there would have
been no merit in his patience, or in the re∣signation
which he expressed. On the con∣trary,
it appears from many circumstances,
that the sensibility of his nature was tender
and exquisite. He affected none of that
hard indifference in which some ancient
<PB N="123" REF="130"/>
philosophers vainly gloried. He felt as a
man, and he sympathized with feelings
of others. On different occasions we are
informed that he was <HI>troubled in spirit,</HI> that
<HI>he groaned,</HI> and that <HI>he wept.</HI> The relation
of his agony in the garden of Gethsemane
exhibits a striking picture of the sensations
of innocent nature oppressed with anguish.
It discovers all the conflict between the
dread of suffering on the one hand, and the
sense of duty on the other; the man strug∣gling
for a while with human weakness,
and in the end recollected in virtue, and
rising superiour to the objects of dismay
which were then in his view. <HI>Father! if
it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Ne∣vertheless,
not as I will, but as thou wilt.
They will be done.</HI> Thus was our Saviour
<HI>touched with the feeling of our infirmities.</HI>
He was <HI>a man of sorrows, and acquainted
with grief.</HI></P>
<P>It is added in the text, that he was <HI>in all
points tempted like as we are.</HI> To be tempt∣ed
is, in the language of Scripture, to un∣dergo
such trials of virtue as are accompa∣nied
<PB N="124" REF="131"/>
with difficulty and conflict. Though
our Lord was not liable to any temptations
from depravity of nature, yet he was per∣petually
exposed to such as arise from situa∣tions
the most adverse to virtue. His whole
life was in this respect a course of tempta∣tion;
that is, a severe trial of his constancy
by every discouragement. He suffered
repeated provocations both from friends
and foes. His endeavours to do good were
requited with the most obstinate and per∣verse
opposition. Sometimes by the solici∣tations
of ignorant multitudes he was tempt∣ed
to accept the proffers of worldly greatness.
Oftener, by the insults of multitudes, more
blind and brutal, he was tempted to desert
an office which exposed him to so much
misery. Together with the world, the
powers of darkness also combined their
efforts against him. We are informed that
he was <HI>led into the wilderness,</HI> and amidst
the horrours of a wild and dreary solitude,
was <HI>tempted of the devil.</HI> The great adver∣sary
of mankind seems to have been per∣mitted
to exert unusual proofs of his power
<PB N="125" REF="132"/>
and malice, on purpose that the trial of
our Saviour's constancy might be more
complete, and his victory over him more
illustrious and distinguished</P>
<P>From all these circumstances, the conclu∣sion
is obvious, that our Lord knows from
personal experience, all the discouragements
and temptations which virtue can suffer.
Though the participated not of the corrup∣tion,
yet he felt the weakness of human
nature. He felt the strength of passion.
He is no stranger to the disturbance and
commotion which either the attacks of the
world, or the powers of darkness, are able
to raise within the breast of man. One re∣markable
difference, indeed, takes place
between our temptations and those of Christ.
Though he was <HI>tempted like as we are, yet
it was without sin.</HI> Though the conflict
was the same, the issue was different. We
are often foiled; He always overcame. But
his disconformity to us in this respect is far
from weakening the strength of our present
argument. For sin contracts and hardens
the heart. Every degree of guilt incurred
<PB N="126" REF="133"/>
by yielding to temptation tends to debase
the mind, and to weaken the generous and
benevolent principles in human nature. If
from our Lord's being <HI>tempted like as we are,</HI>
we have any ground to expect his sympa∣thy,
from his being tempted, <HI>yet without
sin,</HI> we are entitled to hope that his sym∣pathy,
unallayed and perfect, will operate
with more complete energy.</P>
<P>FROM this view of the facts which are
stated in the text, I proceed to show how
justly we may infer our Saviour's compas∣sion,
and in what manner it is to be ac∣commodated
to the consolation of good men
amidst various exigences of life.</P>
<P>It has been the universal opinion of man∣kind,
that personal experience of suffering
humanizes the heart. In the school of af∣fliction,
compassion is always supposed to
be most thoroughly learned: and hence in
the laws of Moses, when the Israelites are
commanded not to oppress the stranger, this
reason is given, <HI>for ye know the heart of a
stranger, seeing ye were strangers yourselves
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
in the land of Egypt.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxiii. 9.</NOTE> The distressed, ac∣cordingly,
file for consolation the those who
have been their companions in woe. They
decline the prosperous, and look up to
them with a suspicious eye. They consi∣der
them as ignorant of their feelings, and
therefore regardless of their complaints.
Amidst the manifold sorrows of life, then,
how soothing is the thought that our great
intercessor with God was a fellow-sufferer
with ourselves, while he passed through
this valley of tears!</P>
<P>But was it necessary for Christ, it may
be said, to assume our nature in order to
acquire the knowledge of its infirmity and
distress? As a divine person, was he not
perfectly acquainted with our frame before
he descended to the earth? Did the stand
in need of being prompted to compassion
by the experience of our sorrows? Could
his experimental knowledge of human weak∣ness
increase the benevolence of a nature
which before was perfect?—No: he sub∣mitted
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
to be <HI>touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, and to be tempted like as we are;</HI>
not in order to become acquainted with
our nature, but to satisfy us that he knew
it perfectly; not in order to acquire any
new degree of goodness, but to give us the
firmer considence in the goodness which he
possessed, and to convey the sense of it to
our hearts with greater force and effect.</P>
<P>Distrust is a weakness peculiarly incident
to the miserable. They are apt to reject
hope, to indulge fear, and to tinge with the
dark colour of their own minds every ob∣ject
which is offered for their encourage∣ment.
The representations given us of the
Deity in Scripture afford undoubtedly much
ground for trust in his goodness. But the
perfection of an Almighty Being, who
dwelleth in the secret place of eternity,
<HI>whom no man hath seen or can see,</HI> is over∣whelming
to a timid apprehension. The
goodness which it promises is a new and
unknown form of goodness. Whatever
proceeds from a nature so far superiour to
our own, is beheld with a degree of awe
<PB N="129" REF="136"/>
which is ready to overpower hope. Upon
this account, under the Old Testament dis∣pensation,
the Supreme Being is often de∣scribed
with the attributes of a man, in order
to give a shade and softening to his great∣ness,
and to accommodate his goodness
more to our capacity. The relentings of a
friend, the pity of a parent, and the sighs
of a mourner, are ascribed to the Almighty.
But we easily perceive such attributes to be
no more than figures and allusions. The
comfort which they afford is not definite
nor precise. They leave the mind under
an anxious uncertainty left it err in its in∣terpretation
of those allegories of mercy.
In the person of Jesus Christ the object of
our trust is brought nearer to ourselves;
and of course adapted more effectually to
our encouragement. Those well-known
tender affections, which are only figura∣tively
ascribed to the Divinity, are in our
great Mediator thoroughly realized. His
goodness is the goodness of human nature
exalted and rendered perfect. It is that
species of goodness with which, of all others,
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
we are best acquainted, compassion to the
unhappy; and compassion cultivated by
that discipline which we know to be the
most powerful, the experience of sorrows.</P>
<P>For such reasons as these, <HI>because the chil∣dren
are partakers of flesh and blood, Christ
himself likewise took part of the same. In all
things it behoved him to be made like unto his
brethren, that he might be a merciful,</HI> as well
as <HI>a faithful high priest.</HI> When we consider
his assumption of our nature in this light,
what a mild and amiable aspect does it give
to the government of heaven! What atten∣tive
solicitude of goodness is shewn in car∣rying
on the dispensation of our redemption
upon a plan so perfectly calculated to banish
all distrust, and to revive the most timid
and dejected heart! How naturally does
that inference follow which the Apostle
makes in the verse immediately succeeding
the text; <HI>let us therefore come boldly to the
throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy,
and find grace to help in time of need!</HI> More
particularly, in consequence of the doctrine
which I have illustrated, we are taught to
hope,</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="138"/>
I. THAT under all our infirmities and
errors, regard will be had to human im∣perfection;
that a merciful distinction will
be made between what is weak and what is
wilfully criminal in our conduct; and that
such measures of obedience only will be ex∣acted
as are proportioned to our circum∣stances
and powers. What can more en∣courage
our religious services, than to be
assured that the God whom we worship
<HI>knows our frame, and remembers we are dust;</HI>
and that the Mediator, through whom we
worship him, <HI>is touched with the feeling of
our infirmities?</HI> The most virtuous are the
most apt to be dejected with the sense of
their frailty. While vain and superficial
men are easily flattered with favourable
views of themselves, and fond hopes of
divine acceptance, the slightest apprehen∣sion
of guilt is ready to alarm the humble
and delicate mind; just as on coarse bodies
and impression is not easily made, while
those of finer contexture are soon hurt; and
as on an exquisite polish the least speek is
visible. But though religion promotes great
<PB N="132" REF="139"/>
sensibility to all feelings of a moral nature,
yet it gives no countenance to excessve and
superstitious fears. That humility which
checks presumption, and that jealousy which
inspires vigilance, are favourable to piety;
while those suspicious which lead to de∣spondency
are injurious to God, hurtful to
ourselves, and repugnant to that whole sys∣tem
of mercy which I have been illustrating.</P>
<P>You complain, that when you engage in
the solemn exercises of devotion, your spi∣rits
are depressed by a load of cares and
sorrows; that in your thoughts there is no
composure, and in your affections no ele∣vation;
that after your utmost essays you
are incapable of fixing your attention stea∣dily
on God, or of sending up your prayers
to him with becoming warmth and fulness
of heart. This debility and wandering of
mind you are apt to impute to some uncom∣mon
degree of guilt. You consider it as
the symptom of incurable hardness of heart,
and as a melancholy proof of your being
abandoned by God.—Such fears as these in
a great measure refute themselves. If you
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
were really obdurate, you would be insen∣sible
of guilt. Your complaints of hardness
of heart are an evidence of your heart being
at that moment contrite and actually relent∣ing.
—Are there any circumstances of in∣ward
discomposure and perplexity of which
He is unconscious who at a critical period
of his life was <HI>heavy and sore amazed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark xiv. 33.</NOTE>; who
was obliged to complain that his soul was
<HI>troubled within him;</HI> and to acknowledge,
that though <HI>the spirit was willing, yet the
flesh was weak?</HI> To a superiour nature,
untouched with human frailty, you might
in such situations look up with some degree
of terrour. But He who remembers the
struggles of his own soul, will not, surely,
judge yours like a hard and unfeeling mas∣ter.
Acquainted with the inmost recesses of
human nature, he perceives the sincerity of
your intentions; he sees the combat you
maintain; he knows how much of your
present confusion and disorder is to be im∣puted,
not to your inclination and will, but
to an infirm, and aged or diseased body, or
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
to a weak and wounded spirit; and there∣fore
will be far from rejecting your attempts
to serve him, on account of the infirmities,
which you lament. He hears the voice of
those secret aspirations which you are unable
to express in words, or to form into prayer.
Every penitential tear which your contrition
sheds, pleads your cause more powerfully
with him, than all the arguments with which
you could fill your mouth.</P>
<P>II. FROM our Saviour's experience of
human misery, we may justly hope that he
will so compassionately regard our distressed
estate, as to prevent us from being loaded
with unnecessary troubles. He will not
wantonly add affliction to the afflicted; nor
willingly crush what he sees to be already
broken. In the course of that high admi∣nistration
which he now exercises, he may
indeed judge certain intermixtures of ad∣versity
to be proper for our improvement.
These are trials of virtue through which all,
without exception, must pass. Rugged was
the road by which our divine Mediator him∣self
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
went before us to glory; and be∣coming
our companion in distress, he meant
to reconcile us to our lot. He ennobled
adversity, by sharing it with us. He raised
poverty from contempt, by assuming it for
his own condition. The severity of his
trials tends to lighten ours. When the ge∣neral
of an army lies on the same hard
ground, drinks of the same cold stream,
carries the same weight of armour with the
lowest centinel, can any of his soldiers re∣pine
a what they endure?</P>
<P>Whatever afflictions our Lord may judge
to be necessary for us, of this we may rest
assured, that he will deal them forth, not
with harsh and imperious authority, but
with the tenderness of one who knows from
experience how deeply the human heart is
wounded by every stroke of adversity. He
will not lay more upon us than he sees we
are able to bear. <HI>Though he cause grief, yet
will he have compassion according to the mul∣titude
of his tender mercies. He will stay his
rough wind in the day of the cast wind</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xxvii. 8.</NOTE>.
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>
For it is his state, but not his nature, which
is now changed. Notwithstanding his high
exaltation, he still retains the compassionate
sentiments of <HI>the man of sorrows.</HI> Still, we
are assured by an inspired writer, <HI>he is not
ashamed to call us his brethren</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 11.</NOTE>. And with
the heart of brother he regards those few
and troubled days, such as his own once
were, which good men are doomed to pass
in this evil world.</P>
<P>From his compassion, indeed, we are not
to expect that fond indulgence or unseason∣able
relief by which the weak pity of men
frequently injures its objects. It is to the
material interests, more than to the present cafe, of good men, that he attends. When
under the impatience of sorrow we exclaim,
<HI>Hath he forgotten to be gracious? hath he
in anger shut up his tender mercies?</HI> we re∣collect
not in whose hands we are. His
compassion is not diminished when its ope∣rations
are most concealed. It continues
equally to flow, though the channels by
which it is conducted towards us lie too
<PB N="137" REF="144"/>
deep for our observation. Amidst our pre∣sent
ignorance of what is good or ill for us
in this life, it is sufficient for us to know,
that the immediate administration of uni∣versal
government is placed in the hands of
the most attentive and compassionate friend
of mankind. How greatly does this consi∣deration
alleviate the burden of human woe!
How happily does it connect with the awful
dispensations of religion the mildest ideas of
tenderness and humanity!</P>
<P>III. THE text leads us to hope that
amidst all the infirmities of our state, both
under the temptations and under the dis∣tresses
of life, our blessed Lord will afford
us a proper measure of assistance and sup∣port.
<HI>In that he hath suffered being tempted,
he is able to succour them who</HI> either suffer,
or <HI>are tempted</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 18.</NOTE>; that is, he is perfectly
qualified for discharging this beneficent
office; he knows exactly where the wound
bleeds, where the burden presses, what re∣lief
will prove most seasonable, and how it
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
can be most successfully applied. The
manner in which it is conveyed by him to
the heart we may be at a loss to explain;
but no argument can be thence drawn
against the credibility of the fact. The
operations which the power of God car∣ries
on the natural world are no less
mysterious than those which we are taught
to believe that his spirit performs in the
moral world. If we can give no account
of what is every day before our eyes, how
a seed becomes a tree, or how the child
rises into a man, is it any wonder that we
should be unable to explain how virtue is
supported, and constancy strengthened, by
God within the heart? If men by their
counsels and suggestions can influence the
minds of one another, must not divine sug∣gestion
and counsel produce a much greater
effect? Surely, the Father of Spirits must,
by a thousand ways, have access to the spi∣rits
which he has made, so as to give them
what determination, or impart to them
what assistance he thinks proper, without
injuring their frame, or disturbing their
rational powers.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="146"/>
Accordingly, wherever any notions of
religion have taken place among mankind,
this belief has in some measure prevailed,
that to the virtuous under distress aid was
communicated from above. This senti∣ment
is so congruous to our natural impres∣sions
of the divine benignity, that both
among poets and philosophers of antient
times it was a favourite idea, and often
occurs in their writings. But what among
them was no more than loose conjecture or
feeble hope has received full confirmation
from the gospel of Christ. Not only is the
promise of divine assistance expressly given
to Christians, but their faith in that promise
is strengthened by an argument which must
carry conviction to every heart. If Christ
had full experience of the insufficiency of
human nature to overcome the difficulties
wherewith it is now surrounded, will he
withhold from his followers that grace
without which he sees they must perish in
the evil day? If in the season of his tempt∣ation
and distress, an angel was sent from
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
heaven <HI>to strengthen him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 43.</NOTE>, shall no celestial
messenger be employed by him on the like
kind errand to those whom he stiles his
brethren? Can we believe that he who once
<HI>bore our griefs and carried our sorrows</HI> will,
from that height of glory to which he is
now exalted, look down upon us here con∣tending
with the storm of adversity, la∣bouring
to follow his steps through the
steep and difficult paths of virtue, exposed
on every side to arrows aimed against us by
the powers of darkness; and that, seeing our
distress, and hearing our supplications, he
will remain an unconcerned spectator,
without vouchsasing us either assistance to
support our frailty, or protection to screen
us amidst surrounding dangers? Where
were then the benevolence of a divine Na∣ture?
Where, the compassion of that medi∣ator
who was trained to mercy in the school
of sorrow? Far from us be such ungrateful
suspicions of the generous friend of human
kind!—Let us exert ourselves as we can,
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
and we shall be assisted. Let us pray, and
we shall be heard; for there is one to pre∣sent
our prayers whom <HI>the father heareth
always.</HI> These, will he say, are my fol∣lowers
on earth, passing through that thorny
path of temptation and sorrow which I once
trode. <HI>Now I am no more in the world;
but these are in the world. Holy Father!
thine they were, and thou gavest them me.
Keep them through thine own name. Sanc∣tify
them through thy truth. Keep them
from the evil one; that they may be where I
am, and may behold the glory which thou
hast given me</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xvii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such is the comfort which arises to us
from our Saviour's participation of the in∣firmities
of human nature; and thus it may
be applied to various situations of anxiety
and distress.</P>
<P>WHEN we review what has been said,
it is necessary that, in the first place, I
guard you against a certain misimprove∣ment
which may be made of this doctrine.
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>
The amiable view which it gives of our
Lord's clemency may flatter some men
with unwarrantable hopes, and lead them to
imagine that in his experience of human
weakness an apology is to be found for
every crime. Persons of this character
must be taught that his compassion differs
widely from that undistinguishing and ca∣pricious
indulgence which is sometimes
found among men. It is the compassion of
an impartial mind, enlightened by wis∣dom
and guided by justice, extending to
the frailties of sincere, but not to the
sins of the presumptuous, and least of all to
the crimes of those who encourage them∣selves
in evil from the hope that they shall
meet with compassion.</P>
<P>A course deliberate guilt admits of no
apology from the weakness of human na∣ture.
For notwithstanding all the infirmi∣ties
incident to it, no man is under a ne∣cessity
of being wicked. So far is our Sa∣viour's
experience of our nature from
affording any ground of hope to presump∣tuous
offenders, that it ought to fill them
<PB N="143" REF="150"/>
with terrour. For it shows them how tho∣roughly
qualified he is to diseriminate
accurately the characters of men, and to
mark the boundaries between frailty and
perverseness. He who from his own feel∣ings
well knows all the workings of the hu∣man
heart, clearly discerns how different
their temper is from what was once his own.
He perceives that vice, not virtue, is
their choice; and that, instead of resisting
temptation, they resist conscience. He sees
that infirmity affords them no excuse; and
that the real cause of their acting a criminal
part, is not because they cannot do better,
but, in truth, because they will not. Hav∣ing
forfeited every title to compassion, they
are left in the hands justice; and ac∣cording
<HI>as they have sown,</HI> they must ex∣cept
<HI>to reap.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, in the next place, to such as are
sincere and upright, the doctrine which I
have illustrated affords high encouragement,
and powerfully recommends the Christian
Religion. It places that religion in its pro∣per
<PB N="144" REF="151"/>
point of view, as a medicinal plan, in∣tended
both for the recovery of mankind
from guilt, and for their consolation under
trouble. <HI>The law was given by Moses; but
grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</HI> The
law was a dispensation of mere authority.
The Gospel is a dispensation, not of autho∣rity
only, but of relief. If it discovers new
duties, and imposes new obligations, it opens
also sources of comfort which were before
unknown to the world.</P>
<P>A mediator between God and his crea∣tures
was an object after which men in all
nations, and under all forms of religion,
had long and anxiously sought. The follies
of superstition have served to disclose to us,
in this instance, the sentiments of nature.
The whole religion of Paganism was a sys∣tem
of mediation and itercession. De∣pressed
by a conscious sense of guilt, nature
shrunk at the thought of adventuring on a
direct approach to the Sovereign of the uni∣verse;
and laboured to find out some auspi∣cious
introductory to that awful presence.
With blind and trembling eagerness, the
<PB N="145" REF="152"/>
nations fled to subordinate deities, to tutelar
gods, and to departed spirits, as their pa∣trons
and advocates above. Them they
studied to sooth with such costyly gifts, such
pompous rites, of such humble supplica∣tions,
as they thought might incline them
to favour their cause, and to support their
interest with the Supreme Divinity. While
mankind were bewildered in this darkness,
the Gospel not only revealed the true Me∣diator,
who in this view may be justly
called <HI>the desire of all nations,</HI> but placed his
character and office in a light most admirably
fitted, as has been shewn in this Discourse,
to support the interest of virtue in the world;
and to encourage the humble, without flat∣tering
the presumptuous. What plan of
religion could be more suited to the circum∣stances
of man, or more worthy of the goodnesss
of his Creator? What more ani∣mating
to the pious worshipper in perform∣ing
those solemn acts of devotion to which
we are called by the service of this day?</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude without taking no∣tice
how remarkably this dispensation of
<PB N="146" REF="153"/>
religion is calculated to promote a spirit of
humanity and compassion among men, by
those very means which it employs for in∣spiring
devotion towards God. We are
now drawing nigh to the Supreme Being
through a Mediator, for whose compassion
we pray on account of the experience which
he has had of our frailty. We trust, that
having been acquainted with distress, he
<HI>will not despise nor abhor the affliction of the
afflicted.</HI> The argument by which we plead
for his compassion concludes still more
strongly for mutual charity, and sympathy
with one another. He who, in the midst
of the common sufferings of life, feels not
for the distressed; he who relents not at his
neighbour's griefs, nor scans his failings
with the eye of a brother, must be sensible
that he excludes himself from the commi∣seration
of Christ. He makes void the ar∣gument
by which he pleads for his mercy;
nay he establishes a precedent against him∣self.
Thus the Christian religion approves
itself as worthy of God, by connecting de∣votion
in strict union with charity. As in
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>
its precepts the love of God and the love of
man are joined, so in its institutions the
exercise of both is called forth; and to wor∣ship
god through the mediation of a com∣passionate
high priest, necessarily supposes
in the worshippers a spirit of compassion
towards their own brethren.</P>

<P>THE state of man on earth is mani∣festly

and perpetual vigilance and attention are
required. There is no passion, or principle
of action in his nature, which may not, if
left to itself, betray him into some criminal
excess. Corruption gains entrance, not only
by those passions which are apparently of
dangerous tendency, such as covetousness,
and love of pleasure; but by means of those
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
also which are seemingly the most fair and
innocent, such as the desire of esteem and
praise. Of this the text suggests a remark∣able
instance. When our Lord appeared
in the land of Judaea, the purity of his doc∣trine,
and the evidence of his miracles, ac∣quired
him a considerable number of fol∣lowers,
chiefly among the lower classes of
men. But the Pharisees, who were the
leading and fashionable sect, galled with
the freedom of his reproofs, decried him as
an impostor. Hence it came to pass, that
though <HI>some of the rulers believed in him, yet,
because of the Pharisees, they did not confess
him.</HI> Rulers, persons who, by their rank and
education, ought to have been superiour to
any popular prejudice, were so far overawed
by the opinions of others, as to stifle their
conviction, to dissemble their faith, and to
join with the prevailing party in condemn∣ing
one whom in their hearts they revered:
for which, this reason is given, that <HI>they
loved the praise of men more than the praise
of God.</HI> Since, then, the love of praise can
mislead men into such culpable and disho∣nest
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>
conduct, let us, with some attention,
examine the nature of this passion. Let us
consider how far it is an allowable principle
of action; when it begins to be criminal;
and upon what accounts we ought to guard
against its acquiring the entire ascendant.</P>
<P>WE are intended by Providence to be con∣nected
with one another in society. Single
unassisted individuals could make small ad∣vances
towards any valuable improvement.
By means of society our wants are supplied,
and our lives rendered comfortable; our
capacities are enlarged, and our virtuous af∣fections
called forth into proper exercise.
In order to confirm our mutual connection,
it was necessary that some attracting power,
which had the effect of drawing men toge∣ther,
and strengthening the social ties, should
pervade the human system. Nothing could
more happily fulfil this purpose, than our
being so formed as to desire the esteem, and
to delight in the good opinion, of each other.
Had such a propensity been wanting, and
selfish principles left to occupy its place, so∣ciety
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
must have proved an unharmonious
and discordant state. Instead of mutual at∣traction,
a repulsive power would have pre∣vailed.
Among men who had no regard
to the approbation of one another, all in∣tercourse
would have been jarring and of∣fensive.
For the wisest ends, therefore, the
desire of praise was made an original and
powerful principle in the human breast.</P>
<P>To a variety of good purposes it is sub∣servient,
and on many occasions co-operates
with the principle of virtue. It awakens
us from sloth, invigorates activity, and
stimulates our efforts to excel. It has given
rise to most of the splendid, and to many of
the useful enterprizes of men. It has ani∣mated
the patriot, and fired the hero. Mag∣nanimity,
generosity and fortitude are what
all mankind admire. Hence such as were
actuated by the desire of extensive same,
have been prompted to deeds which either
participated of the spirit, or, at least, car∣ried
the appearance of distinguished virtue.
The desire of praise is generally connected
with all the siner sensibilities of human na∣ture.
<PB N="152" REF="159"/>
It affords a ground on which exhort∣ation,
counsel and reproof can work a pro∣per
effect. Whereas to be entirely destitute
of this passion betokens an ignoble mind,
on which no moral impression is easily
made. Where there is no desire of praise,
there will be also no sense of reproach; and
if that be extinguished, one of the princi∣pal
guards of virtue is removed, and the
mind thrown open to many opprobrious
pursuits. He whose countenance never
glowed with shame, and whose heart never
beat at the sound of praise, is not destined
for any honourable distinction; is likely to
grovel in the sordid quest of gain, or to
slumber life away in the indolence of selfish
pleasures.</P>
<P>Abstracting from the sentiments which
are connected with the love of praise as a
principle of action, the esteem of our fel∣low-creatures
is an object which, on ac∣count
of the advantages it brings, may be
lawfully pursued. It is necessary to our
success in every fair and honest undertak∣ing.
Not only our private interest, but our
<PB N="153" REF="160"/>
public usefulness, depends in a great measure
upon it. The sphere of our influence is
contracted or enlarged in proportion to the
degree in which we enjoy the good opinion
of the public. Men listen with an unwil∣ling
ear to one whom they do not honour;
while a respected character adds weight to
example, and authority to counsel. To
desire the esteem of others for the sake of
its effects is not only allowable, but in ma∣ny
cases is our duty: and to be totally in∣different
to praise or censure, is so far from
being a virtue, that it is a real defect in
character.</P>
<P>BUT while the love of praise is admitted
to be in so many respects a natural and use∣ful
principle of action, we are at the same
time to observe that it is entitled to no more
than our secondary regard. It has its
boundaries set; by transgressing which, it is
at once transformed from an innocent into a
most dangerous passion. More sacred and
venerable principles claim the chief direc∣tion
of human conduct. All the good ef∣fects
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
which we have ascribed to the desire
of praise, are produced by it when remain∣ing
in a subordinate station. But when
passing its natural line, it becomes the ru∣ling
spring of conduct; when the regard
which we pay to the opinions of men, in∣croaches
on that reverence which we owe
to the voice of conscience and the sense of
duty; the love of praise having then gone
out of its proper place, instead of improv∣ing,
corrupts; and instead of elevating, de∣bases
our nature. The proportion which this
passion holds to other principles of action is
what renders it either innocent or criminal.
The crime with which the Jewish rulers are
charged in the text, was not that they loved
the prase of men; but that they loved it
<HI>more than the praise of God.</HI></P>
<P>Even in cases where there is no direct
competition between our duty and our
fancied honour, between the praise of men
and the praise of God, the passion for ap∣plause
may become criminal by occupying
the place of a better principle. When vain∣glory
usurps the throne of virtue; when
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>
ostentation produces actions which consci∣ence
ought to have dictated; such actions,
however specious, have no claim to moral
or religious praise. We know that good
deeds done merely <HI>to be seen of men</HI> lose
their reward with God. If, on occasion of
some trying conjuncture which makes us
hesitate concerning our line of conduct, the
first question which occurs to us be, not
whether an action is right in itself, and such
as a good man ought to perform, but whe∣ther
it is such as will find acceptance with
the world, and be favourable to our fame,
the conclusion is too evident that the desire
of applause has obtained an undue ascendant.
What a wise and good man ought to study,
is to preserve his mind free from any such
solicitude concerning praise as may be in
hazard of overcoming his sense of duty.
The approbation of men he may wish to
obtain, as far as is consistent with the ap∣probation
of God. But when both cannot
be enjoyed together, there ought to be no
suspence. He is to retire contented with
the testimony of a good conscience; and to
<PB N="156" REF="163"/>
show by the firmness of his behaviour, that,
in the cause of truth and virtue, he is supe∣riour
to all opinion.—Let us now proceed
to consider the arguments which should
support such a spirit, and guard us against
the improper influence of praise or censure
in the course of our duty.</P>
<P>In the first place, the praise of men is
not an object of any such value in itself as
to be entitled to become the leading princi∣ple
of conduct. We degrade our charac∣ter
when we allow it more than subordinate
regard. Like other worldly goods, it is
apt to dazzle us with a false lustre; but if
we would ascertain its true worth, let us
reflect both on whom it is bestowed, and
from whom it proceeds. Were the applause
of the world always the reward of merit;
were it appropriated to such alone as by real
abilities, or by worthy actions, are entitled
to rise above the crowd, we might justly
be flattered by possessing a rare and valuable
distinction. But how far is this from be∣ing
the case in fact? How often have the
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
despicable and the vile, by dexterously
catching the favour of the multitude, soared
upon the wings of popular applause, while
the virtuous and the deserving have been
either buried in obscurity, or obliged to
encounter the attacks of unjust reproach?
The laurels which human praise confers are
withered and blasted by the unworthiness
of those who wear them. Let the man
who is vain of public favour be humbled by
the reflection that, in the midst of his suc∣cess,
he is mingled with a crowd of impos∣tors
and deceivers, of hypocrites and en∣thusiasts,
of ignorant pretenders and super∣ficial
reasoners, who, by various arts, have
attained as high a rank as himself in tem∣porary
fame.</P>
<P>We may easily be satisfied that applause
will be often shared by the undeserving, if
we allow ourselves to consider from whom
it proceeds. When it is the approbation of
the wise only and the good which is pur∣sued,
the love of praise may then be ac∣counted
to contain itself within just bounds,
and to run in its proper channel. But the
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
testimony of the discerning few, modest and
unassuming as they commonly are, forms
but a small part of the public voice. It sel∣dom
amounts to more than a whisper, which
amidst the general clamour is drowned.
When the love of praise has taken possession
of the mind, it confines not itself to an ob∣ject
so limited. It grows into an appetite
for indiscriminate praise. And who are
they that confer this praise? A mixed mul∣titude
of men, who in their whole conduct
are guided by humour and caprice, far more
than by reason; who admire false appear∣ances,
and pursue false goods; who inquire
superficially, and judge rashly; whose senti∣ments
are for the most part erroneous, always
changeable, and often inconsistent. Nor
let any one imagine, that by looking above
the crowd, and courting the praise of the
fashionable and the great, he makes sure of
true honour. There are a great vulgar, as
well as a small. Rank often makes no dif∣ference
in the understandings of men, or in
their judicious distribution of praise. Luxury,
pride, and vanity, have frequently as much
<PB N="159" REF="166"/>
influence in corrupting the sentiments of
the great, as ignorance, bigotry, and pre∣judice,
have in misleading the opinions of
the crowd.—And is it to such judges as
these that you submit the supreme direction
of your conduct? Do you stoop to court
their favour as your chief distinction, when
an object of so much juster and higher am∣bition
is presented to you in <HI>the praise of
God?</HI> God is the only unerring judge of
what is excellent. His approbation alone
is the substance, all other praise is but the
shadow, of honour. The character which
you bear in his sight is your only real one.
How contemptible does it render you to be
indifferent with respect to this, and to be
solicitous about a name alone, a fictitious,
imaginary character, which has no exist∣ence
except in the opinions of a few weak
and credulous men around you? They see
no farther then the outside of things. They
can judge of you by actions only; and not
by the comprehensive view of all your ac∣tions,
but by such merely as you have had
opportunity of bringing forth to public no∣tice.
<PB N="160" REF="167"/>
But the Sovereign of the world be∣holds
you in every light in which you can
be placed. The silent virtues of a generous
purpose and a pious heart attract his notice
equally with the most splendid deeds. From
him you may reap the praise of good actions
which you had no opportunity of perform∣ing.
For he sees them in their principle;
he judges of you by your intentions; he
knows what you would have done. You
may be in his eyes a hero or a martyr,
without undergoing the labours of the one,
or the sufferings of the other. His inspec∣tion,
therefore, opens a much wider field
for praise than what the world can afford
you; and for praise, too, certainly far more
illustrious in the eye of reason. Every real
artist studies to approve himself to such as
are knowing in his art. To their judgment
he appeals. On their approbation he rests
his character, and not on the praise of the
unskilled and rude. In the highest art of
all, that of life and conduct, shall the opi∣nions
of ignorant men come into the most
distant competition with his approbation
<PB N="161" REF="168"/>
who is the searcher of all hearts, and the
standard of all perfection?—The testimony
of his praise is not indeed, as yet, openly
bestowed. But though the voice of the Al∣mighty
sound not in your ears, yet by con∣science,
his sacred vicegerent, it is capable
of being conveyed to your heart. The
softest whisper of divine approbation is
sweeter to the soul of a virtuous man, than
the loudest shouts of that tumultuary ap∣plause
which proceeds from the world.</P>
<P>Consider, farther, how narrow and cir∣cumscribed
in its limits that fame is which
the vain-glorious man so eagerly pursues.
In order to shew him this, I shall not bid
him reflect that it is confined to a small
district of the earth; and that when he looks
a little beyond the region which he inhabits,
he will find himself as much unknown as
the most obscure person around him. I
shall not desire him to consider, that in the
gulph of oblivion, where all human me∣morials
are swallowed up, his name and
fame must soon be inevitably lost. He may
imagine that ample honours remain to gra∣tify
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
ambition, though his reputation extend
not over the whole globe, nor last till the
end of time. But let him calmly reflect,
that within the narrow boundaries of that
country to which he belongs, and during
that small portion of time which his life fills
up, his reputation, great as he may fancy
it to be, occupies no more than an incon∣siderable
corner. Let him think what mul∣titudes
of those among whom he dwells are
totally ignorant of his name and character;
how many imagine themselves too import∣ant
to regard him; how many are too much
occupied with their own wants and pursuits
to pay him the least attention; and where
his reputation is in any degree spread, how
often it has been attacked, and how many
rivals are daily rising to abate it: Having
attended to these circumstances, he will find
sufficient materials for humiliation in the
midst of the highest applause.—From all
these considerations it clearly appears, that
though the esteem of our fellow-creatures
be pleasing, and the pursuit of it, in a mo∣derate
degree, be fair and lawful, yet that
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
it affords no such object to desire as entitles
it to be a ruling principle.</P>
<P>IN the second place, an excessive love of
praise never fails to undermine the regard
due to conscience, and to corrupt the heart.
It turns off the eye of the mind from the
ends which it ought chiefly to keep in view;
and sets up a false light for its guide. Its
influence is the more dangerous, as the co∣lour
which it assumes is often fair; and its
garb and appearance are nearly allied to
that of virtue. The love of glory, I before
admitted, may give birth to actions which
are both splendid and useful. At a distance
they strike the eye with uncommon bright∣ness;
but on a nearer and stricter survey,
their lustre is often tarnished. They are
found to want that sacred and venerable dig∣nity
which characterizes true virtue. Little
passions and selfish interests entered into the
motives of those who performed them. They
were jealous of a competitor. They sought
to humble a rival. They looked round for
spectators to admire them. All is magna∣nimity,
<PB N="164" REF="171"/>
generosity, and courage, to public
view. But the ignoble source whence these
seeming virtues take their rise is hidden.
Without, appears the hero; within, is found
the man of dust and clay. Consult such as
have been intimately connected with the
followers of renown; and seldom or never
will you find that they held them in the
same esteem with those who viewed them
from afar. There is nothing except sim∣plicity
of intention, and purity of principle,
that can stand the test of near approach and
strict examination.</P>
<P>But supposing the virtue of vain-glorious
men not to be always false, it certainly can∣not
be depended upon as firm or sure. Con∣stancy
and steadiness are to be looked for
from him only whose conduct is regulated
by a sense of what is right; <HI>whose praise is
not of men, but of God;</HI> whose motive to dis∣charge
his duty is always the same. Change,
as much as you please, the situation of such
a man; let applause or let censure be his
lot; let the public voice, which this day has
extolled him, to-morrow as loudly decry
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
him; on the tenour of his behaviour these
changes produce no effect. He moves in a
higher sphere. As the sun in his orbit is
not interrupted by the mists and storms of
the atmosphere below, so, regardless of the
opinions of men, <HI>through honour and dis∣honour,
through good report and bad report,</HI>
he pursues the path which conscience has
marked out. Whereas the apparent virtues
of that man whose eye is fixed on the world,
are precarious and temporary. Supported
only by circumstances, occasions, and par∣ticular
regards, they fluctuate and fall with
these. Excited by public admiration, they
disappear when it is withdrawn; like those
exhalations which, raised by heat from the
earth, glitter in the air with momentary
splendour, and then fall back to the ground
from whence they sprung.</P>
<P>The intemperate love of praise not only
weakens the true principles of probity, by
substituting inferior motives in their stead,
but frequently also impels men to actions
which are directly criminal. It obliges them
to follow the current of popular opinion
<PB N="166" REF="173"/>
whithersoever it may carry them; and hence
<HI>shipwreck</HI> is often made both <HI>of faith and of
a good conscience.</HI> According as circum∣stances
lead them to court the acclamations
of the multitude, or to pursue the applause
of the great, vices of different kinds will
stain their character. In one situation they
will make hypocritical professions of reli∣gion.
In another, they will be ashamed of
their Redeemer, and of his words. They
will be afraid to appear in their own form,
or to utter their genuine sentiments. Their
whole character will become fictitious; opi∣nions
will be assumed, speech and behaviour
modelled, and even the countenance formed,
as prevailing taste exacts. From one who
has submitted to such prostitution for the
sake of praise, you can no longer expect
fidelity or attachment on any trying occa∣sion.
In private life, he will be a timorous
and treacherous friend. In public conduct,
he will be supple and versatile; ready to de∣sert
the cause which he had espoused, and
to veer with every shifting wind of popular
favour. In sine, all becomes unfound and
<PB N="167" REF="174"/>
hollow in that heart where, instead of re∣gard
to the divine approbation, there reigns
the sovereign desire of pleasing men.</P>
<P>IN the third place, this passion, when it
becomes predominant, most commonly de∣feats
its own end, and deprives men of the
honour which they are so eager to gain.
Without preserving liberty and independ∣ence,
we can never command respect.
That servility of spirit which subjects us to
the opinions of others, and renders us tri∣butaries
to the world for the sake of ap∣plause,
is what all mankind despise. They
look up with reverence to one who, un∣awed
by their censures, acts according to
his own sense of things, and follows the free
impulse of an honourable mind. But him
who hangs totally on their judgment, they
consider as their vassal. They even enjoy
a malignant pleasure in humbling his vanity,
and withholding that praise which he is seen
to court. By artifice and show he may
shine for a time in the public eye; but it is
only as long as he can support the belief of
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>
acting from principle. When the incon∣sistencies
into which he falls detect his cha∣racter,
his reputation passes away, like the
pageant of a day. No man ever obtained
lasting fame who did not, on several occa∣sions,
contradict the prejudices of popular opinion.</P>
<P>There is no course of behaviour which
will at all times please all men. That which
pleases most universally, and which only
commands durable praise, is religion and
virtue. Sincere piety towards God, kind
affection to men, and fidelity in the dis∣charge
of all the duties of life; a conscience
pure and undefiled; a heart firm to justice
and to truth, superiour to all terrours that
would shake, and insensible to all plesures
that would betray it; unconquerable by the
opposition of the world, and resigned to
God alone; these are the qualities which
render a man truly respectable and great.
Such a character may, in evil times, incur
unjust reproach. But the clouds which envy
or prejudice has gathered around it will gra∣dually
disperse; and its brightness will come
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
forth, in the end, as the noon day. As
soon as it is thoroughly known, it finds a
witness in every breast. It forces approba∣tion
even from the most degenerate. The
human heart is so formed as to be attuned,
if we may use the expression, to its praise.
In fact, it is this firm and inflexible virtue,
this determined regard to principle beyond
all opinion, which has crowned the charac∣ters
of such as now stand highest in the rolls
of lasting fame. The truly illustrious are
they who did not court the praise of the
world, but who performed the actions which
deserved it. They were perhaps traduced,
in their lifetime, by those whom they op∣posed.
But posterity has done them ample
justice; and they are the men whom the
voice of ages now concurs in celebrating.
<HI>The memorial of virtue is immortal; because
it is approved of God and of men. When it
is present, men take example at it; and when
it is gone, they desire it. It weareth a crown,
and triumpheth for ever; having gotten the
victory; striving for undefiled rewards</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisdom of Solomon, iv. 1, 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="177"/>
IN the fourth place, as an immoderate
passion for human praise is dangerous to vir∣tue,
and unfavourable to true honour, so it
is destructive of self-enjoyment and in∣ward
peace. Regard to the praise of God
prescribes a simple and consistent tenour of
conduct, which in all situations is the same;
which engages us in no perplexities, and
requires no artful refinement. <HI>Walking
uprightly, we walk surely,</HI> because we tread
an even and open path. But he who turns
aside from the straight road of duty in order
to gain applause, involves himself in an in∣tricate
labyrinth. He will be often embar∣rassed
concerning the course which he ought
to hold. His mind will be always on the
stretch. He will be obliged to listen with
anxious attention to every whisper of the
popular voice. The demands of those ma∣sters
whom he has submitted to serve, will
prove frequently contradictory and incon∣sistent.
He has prepared a yoke for his
neck which he must resolve to bear, how
much soever it may gall him.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="178"/>
The toils of virtue are honourable. The
mind is supported under them by the con∣sciousness
of acting a right and becoming
part. But the labours to which he is doom∣ed
who is enslaved to the desire of praise,
are aggravated by reflexion both on the un∣certainty
of the recompence which he pur∣sues,
and on the debasement to which he
submits. Conscience will from time to
time remind him of the improper sacrifices
which he has made, and of the forfeiture
which he has incurred of the praise of God
for the sake of praise from men. Suppose
him to receive all the rewards which the
mistaken opinion of the world can bestow,
its loudest applause will often be unable to
drown the upbraidings of an inward voice;
and if a man is reduced to be ashamed of
himself, what avails it him to be caressed by
others?</P>
<P>But, in truth, the reward towards which
be looks who proposes human praise as his
ultimate object, will be always flying, like
a shadow, before him. So capricious and
uncertain, so sickle and mutable is the fa∣vour
<PB N="172" REF="179"/>
of the multitude, that it proves the
most unsatisfactory of all pursuits in which
men can be engaged. He who sets his
heart on it, is preparing for himself perpe∣tual
mortifications. If the greatest and best
can seldom retain it long, we may easily
believe that from the vain and undeserving
it will suddenly escape. There is no cha∣racter
but what on some side is vulnerable
by censure. He who lifts himself up to the
observation and notice of the world is, of
all men, the least likely to avoid it. For
he draws upon himself a thousand eyes that
will narrowly inspect him in every part.
Every opportunity will be watched of bring∣ing
him down to the common level. His
errours will be more divulged, and his in∣firmities
more magnified, than those of
others. In proportion to his eagerness for
praise will be his sensibility to reproach.
Nor is it reproach alone that will wound
him. He will be as much dejected by si∣lence
and neglect. He puts himself under
the power of every one to humble him,
by with-holding expected praise. Even
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>
when praise is bestowed, he is mortified
by its being either faint or trite. He pines
when his reputation stagnates. The degree
of applause to which he has been accustom∣ed
grows insipid; and to be always praised
from the fame topics, becomes at last much
the same with not being praised at all.</P>
<P>All these chagrins and disquietudes are
happily avoided by him who keeps so trou∣blesome
a passion within its due bounds;
who is more desirous of being truly worthy
than of being thought so; who pursues the
praise of the world with manly temperance,
and in subordination to the praise of God.
He is neither made giddy by the intoxicat∣ing
vapour of applause, nor humbled and
cast down by the unmerited attacks of cen∣sure.
Resting on a higher approbation he
enjoys himself in peace, whether human
praise stays with him, or flies away. <HI>With
me it is a small thing to be judged of you, or of
man's judgment. He that judgeth me is the
Lord. My witness is in Heaven, and my
record is on high.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="181"/>
IN the fifth and last place, the advan∣tages
which redound from the praise of men,
are not such as can bear to be put in com∣petition
with those which flow from the
praise of God. The former are necessarily
confined within the verge of our present
existence. The latter follow us beyond
the grave, and extend through all eternity.
Not only is the praise of men limited in its
effects to this life, but also to particular situa∣tions
of it. In the days of health and ease
it may brighten the sunshine of prosperity.
It may then sooth the ear with pleasing ac∣cents,
and gratify the imagination with fan∣cied
triumphs. But when the distressful
seasons of life arrive, it will be found alto∣gether
hollow and unsubstantial: And sure∣ly,
the value of any possession is to be chiefly
estimated by the relief which it can bring
us in the time of our greatest need. When
the mind is cast down with sorrow and
grief, when sickness spreads its gloom
around us, or death rises in awful prospect
to our view, the opinions and the dis∣courses
of the world will appear trifling and
<PB N="175" REF="182"/>
insignificant. To one who is occupied
with nearer and more affecting interests,
the praise or the censure of the world will
seem like the noise of distant voices, in
which he has small concern. But then is
the season when the praise of God supports
and upholds the labouring soul. Brought
home to the heart by the testimony of a
good conscience, and by <HI>the divine spirit
bearing witness with our spirits,</HI> it inspires
fortitude, and produces a <HI>peace which passeth
understanding.</HI></P>
<P>At present we behold an irregular and
disordered state of things. Virtue is often
deprived of its proper honours, and vice
usurps them in its stead. The characters of
men are mistaken; and ignorance and folly
dispose of human applause. But the day
hastens apace which shall close this scene of
errours, and vindicate the rights of justice
and truth. Then <HI>shall be rendered to every
man according to his works.</HI> Envy shall no
longer have the power of obscuring merit,
nor popular prejudices be able to support
the undeserving. Hidden worth shall be
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
brought to light, and secret crimes revealed
Many who passed through the world in the
silent obscurity of humble, but steady good∣ness,
shall be distinguished as the favourites
of Heaven; while the proud, the ambitious,
and the vain, are left to everlasting disho∣nour.
The great Judge hath declared, that
<HI>whosoever has been ashamed of him and of his
words, of that man shall he be ashamed when
he cometh in the glory of his Father, with all
the holy angels.</HI> Every departure from duty
shall at the period of final distribution ter∣minate
in ignominy. True honour and true
virtue shall be seen to coincide; and when
all human fame has passed away like smoke,
the only praise which shall be for ever re∣membered
is that divine testimony, <HI>Well
done, thou good and faithful servant; enter
thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THESE arguments clearly show the im∣portance
of preserving the love of praise
under proper subordination to the principle
of duty. In itself, it is an useful motive to
action; but when allowed to extend its
<PB N="177" REF="184"/>
influence too far, it corrupts the whole
character, and produces guilt, disgrace, and
misery. To be entirely destitute of it, is
a defect. To be governed by it, is depra∣vity.
The proper adjustment of the several
principles of action in human nature is a
matter that deserves our highest attention.
For when any one of them becomes either
too weak or too strong, it endangers both
our virtue and our happiness. <HI>Keep thy
heart therefore with all diligence;</HI> pray that
God would enable thee to keep it with suc∣cess;
<HI>for out of the heart are the issues of
life.</HI></P>

<P>NO serious maxim has been more ge∣nerally
adopted than that of the text.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VII.</NOTE>
In every age, the vanity of human life has
been the theme of declamation, and the sub∣ject
of complaint. It is a conclusion in which
men of all characters and ranks, the high
and the low, the young and the old, the
religious and the worldly, have more fre∣quently
concurred than in any other. But
how just soever the conclusion may be, the
premises from which it is drawn are often
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
false. For it is prompted by various mo∣tives,
and derived from very different views
of things. Sometimes the language of the
text is assumed by a sceptic who cavils at
Providence, and censures the constitution of
the world. Sometimes it is the complaint
of a peevish man who is discontented with
his station, and ruffled by the disappoint∣ment
of unreasonable hopes. Sometimes it
is the style of the licentious, when groan∣ing
under miseries in which their vices have
involved them. Invectives against the va∣nity
of the world which come from any of
these quarters deserve no regard; as they
are the dictates of impiety, of spleen, or of
folly. The only case in which the senti∣ment
of the text claims our attention, is
when uttered, not as an aspersion on Pro∣vidence,
or a reflection on human affairs in
general; not as the language of private dis∣content,
or the result of guilty sufferings;
but as the sober conclusion of a wise and
good man concerning the imperfection of
that happiness which rests solely on worldly
pleasures. These, in their fairest form, are
<PB N="180" REF="187"/>
not what they seem to be. They never
bestow that complete satisfaction which they
promise; and therefore he who looks to
nothing beyond them shall have frequent
cause to deplore their vanity.</P>
<P>Nothing is of higher importance to us as
men and as Christians, than to form a proper
estimate of human life, without either load∣ing
it with imaginary evils, or expecting
from it greater advantages than it is able to
yield. It shall be my business, therefore,
in this Discourse, to distinguish a just and
religious sense of the vanity of the world
from the unreasonable complaints of it which
we often hear. I shall endeavour, I. To
shew in what sense it is true that all earthly
pleasures are vanity, II. To inquire how
this vanity of the world can be reconciled
with the perfections of its great Author.
III. To examine whether there are not
some real and solid enjoyments in human
life which fall not under this general charge
of vanity. And, IV. To point out the
proper improvement to be made of such a
state as the life of man shall appear on the
whole to be.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="188"/>
I. I AM to shew in what sense it is true
that all human pleasures are vanity. This
is a topic which might be embellished with
the pomp of much description. But I shall
studiously avoid exaggeration, and only
point out a threefold vanity in human life
which every impartial observer cannot but
admit; disappointment in pursuit, dissatis∣faction
in enjoyment, uncertainty in pos∣session.</P>
<P>First, disappointment in pursuit. When
we look around us on the world, we every
where behold a busy multitude, intent on
the prosecution of various designs which
their wants or desires have suggested. We
behold them employing every method which
ingenuity can devise, some the patience of
industry, some the boldness of enterprise,
others the dexterity of stratagem, in order
to compass their ends. Of this incessant stir
and activity, what is the fruit? In compa∣rison
of the crowd who have toiled in vain,
how small is the number of the successful?
Or rather, where is the man who will de∣clare
that in every point he has completed
<PB N="182" REF="189"/>
his plan, and attained his utmost wish? No
extent of human abilities has been able to
discover a path which, in any line of life,
leads unerringly to success. <HI>The race is not
always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,
nor riches to men of understanding.</HI> We may
form our plans with the most profound sa∣gacity,
and with the most vigilant caution
may guard against dangers on every side.
But some unforeseen occurrence comes across
which hassles our wisdom, and lays our la∣bours
in the dust.</P>
<P>Were such disappointments confined to
those who aspire at engrossing the higher
departments of life, the misfortune were
less. The humiliation of the mighty, and
the fall of ambition from its towering height,
little concern the hulk of mankind. These
are objects on which, as on distant meteors,
they gaze from afar, without drawing per∣sonal
instruction from events so much above
them. But, alas! when we descend into
the regions of private life, we find disap∣pointment
and bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed hope equally preva∣lent
there. Neither the moderation of our
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
views, nor the justice of our pretensions, can
ensure success. But <HI>time and chance happen
to all.</HI> Against the stream of events both
the worthy and the undeserving are obliged
to struggle; and both are frequently over∣born
alike by the current.</P>
<P>BESIDES disappointment in pursuit, dis∣satisfaction
in enjoyment is a farther vanity
to which the human state is subject. This
is the severest of all mortifications, after
having been successful in the pursuit, to be
baffled in the enjoyment itself. Yet this is
found to be an evil still more general than
the former. Some may be so fortunate as
to attain what they have pursued; but none
are rendered completely happy by what they
have attained. Disappointed hope is mi∣sery;
and yet successful hope is only im∣perfect
bliss. Look through all the ranks
of mankind. Examine the condition of
those who appear most prosperous; and you
will find that they are never just what they
desire to be. If retired, they languish for
action; if busy, they complain of fatigue.
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
If in middle life, they are impatient for dis∣tinction;
if in high stations, they sigh after
freedom and ease. Something is still want∣ing
to that plenitude of satisfaction which
they expected to acquire. Together with
every with that is gratified, a new demand
arises. One void opens in the heart, as
another is filled. On wishes, wishes grow;
and to the end, it is rather the expectation
of what they have not, than the enjoyment
of what they have, which occupies and in∣terests
the most successful.</P>
<P>This dissatisfaction in the midst of hu∣man
pleasure springs partly from the nature
of our enjoyments themselves, and partly
from circumstances which corrupt them.
No worldly enjoyments are adequate to the
high desires and powers of an immortal spi∣rit.
Fancy paints them at a distance with
splendid colours; but possession unveils the
fallacy. The eagerness of passion bestows
upon them at first a brisk and lively relish.
But it is their fate always to pall by fami∣liarity,
and sometimes to pass from satiety
into disgust. Happy would the poor man
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
think himself if he could enter on all the
treasures of the rich; and happy for a short
while he might be. But before he had long
contemplated and admired his state, his pos∣sessions
would seem to lessen, and his cares
would grow.</P>
<P>Add to the unsatisfying nature of our
pleasures the attending circumstances which
never fail to corrupt them. For, such as
they are, they are at no time possessed un∣mixed.
To human lips it is not given to
taste the cup of pure joy. When external
circumstances show fairest to the world, the
envied man groans in private under his own
burden. Some vexation disquiets, some pas∣sion
corrodes him; some distress, either felt
or feared, gnaws, like a worm, the root of
his felicity. When there is nothing from
without to disturb the prosperous, a secret
poison operates within. For worldly hap∣piness
ever tends to destroy itself, by cor∣rupting
the heart. It fosters the loose and the
violent passions. It engenders noxious habits;
and taints the mind with a false delicacy,
which makes it feel a thousand unreal evils.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="193"/>
BUT put the case in the most favourable
light. Lay aside from human pleasures
both disappointment in pursuit, and deceit∣fulness
in enjoyment; suppose them to be
fully attainable, and completely satisfactory;
still there remains to be considered the va∣nity
of uncertain possession and short dura∣tion.
Were there in worldly things any
fixed point of security which we could gain,
the mind would then have some basis on
which to rest. But our condition is such,
that every thing wavers and totters around
us. <HI>Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for
thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</HI>
It is much if, during its course, thou hearest
not of some what to disquiet or alarm thee.
For life never proceeds long in an uniform
train. It is continually varied by unex∣pected
events. The seeds of alteration are
every where sown; and the sunshine of
prosperity commonly accelerates their
growth. If your enjoyments be numerous,
you lie more open on different sides to be
wounded. If you have possessed them long,
you have greater cause to dread an ap∣proaching
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
change. By slow degrees pro∣sperity
rises; but rapid is the progress of
evil. It requires no preparation to bring
it forward. The edifice which it cost much
time and labour to erect, one inauspicious
event, one sudden blow, can level with the
dust. Even supposing the accidents of life
to leave us untouched, human bliss must
still be transitory; for man changes of him∣self.
No course of enjoyment can delight
us long. What amused our youth Joses its
charm in maturer age. As years advance,
our powers are blunted, and our pleasurable
feelings decline. The silent lapse of time
is ever carrying somewhat from us, till at
length the period comes when all must be
swept away. The prospect of this termina∣tion
of our labours and pursuits is sufficient
to mark our state with vanity. <HI>Our days
are a band-breadth, and our age is as no∣thing.</HI>
Within that little space is all our
enterprise bounded. We crowd it with
toils and cares, with contention and strife.
We project great designs, entertain high
hopes, and then leave our plans unfinished,
and sink into oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="195"/>
This much let it suffice to have said con∣cerning
the vanity of the world. That
too much has not been said, must appear
to every one who considers how generally
mankind lean to the opposite side; and how
often by undue attachment to the present
state, they both feed the most sinful pas∣sions,
and <HI>pierce themselves through with many
sorrows.</HI> Let us proceed to enquire,</P>
<P>II. How this Vanity of the world can he
reconciled with the perfections of its divine
Author. This enquiry involves that great
difficulty which has perplexed the thought∣ful
and serious in every age; If God be
good, whence the evil that fills the earth?
In answer to this interesting question, let us
observe,</P>
<P>In the first place, that the present condi∣tion
of man was not his original or primary
state. We are informed by divine revela∣tion,
that it is the consequence of his volun∣tary
apostacy from God and a state of inno∣cence.
By this, his nature was corrupted;
his powers were enfeebled; and vanity and
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
vexation introduced into his life. All na∣ture
became involved in the condemnation
of man. The earth was cursed upon his
account, and the whole creation made to
<HI>groan and travail in pain.</HI></P>
<P>How mysterious soever the account of
this fall may appear to us, many circum∣stances
concur to authenticate the fact, and
to show that human nature and the human
state have undergone an unhappy change.
The belief of this has obtained in almost all
nations and religions. It can be traced
through all the fables of antiquity. An ob∣scure
tradition appears to have pervaded
the whole earth, that man is not now what
he was at first; but that, in consequence of
some transgression against his great Lord,
a state of degradation and exile succeeded
to a condition that was more flourishing and
happy. As our nature carries plain marks
of perversion and disorder, so the world
which we inhabit bears the symptoms of
having been convulsed in all its frame.
Naturalists point out to us every where the
traces of some violent change which it has
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
suffered. Islands torn from the continent,
burning mountains, shattered precipices, un∣inhabitable
wastes, give it all the appearance
of a mighty ruin. The physical and moral
state of man in this world mutually sym∣pathize
and correspond. They indicate not
a regular and orderly structure either of
matter or of mind, but the remains of some∣what
that once was more fair and magnifi∣cent.
Let us observe,</P>
<P>IN the second place, that as this was not
the original, so it is not intended to be the
final state of man. Though in conse∣quence
of the abuse of the human powers, sin
and vanity were introduced into this region
of the universe, it was not the purpose of
the Creator that they should be permitted
to reign for ever. He hath made ample
provision for the recovery of the penitent
and faithful part of his subjects, by the
merciful undertaking of that great restorer
of the world, our Lord Jesus Christ. By
him <HI>life and immortality were</HI> both purchas∣ed
and <HI>brought to light. The new heavens
<PB N="191" REF="198"/>
and the new earth</HI> are discovered, <HI>wherein
dwelleth righteousness;</HI> where, through the
divine grace, human nature shall regain its
original honours, and man shall return to
be what once he was in Paradise. Through
those high discoveries of the Gospel, this
life appears to good men only in the light
of an intermediate and preparatory state.
Its vanity and misery, in a manner, disap∣pear.
They have every reason to submit
without complaint to its laws, and to wait
in patience till the appointed time come for
<HI>the restitution of all things.</HI> Let us take no∣tice</P>
<P>IN the third place, that, a future state
being made known, we can account in a
satisfying manner for the present distress of
human life, without the smallest impeach∣ment
of divine goodness. The sufferings
we here undergo are converted into disci∣pline
and improvement Through the
blessing of Heaven, good is extracted from
apparent evil; and the very misery which
originated from sin is rendered the means
<PB N="192" REF="199"/>
of correcting sinful passions, and preparing
us for felicity. There is much reason to
believe that creatures as imperfect as we
are, require some such preliminary state of
experience before they can recover the per∣fection
of their nature. It is in the midst
of disappointments and trials that we learn
the insufficiency of temporal things to hap∣piness,
and are taught to seek it from God
and Virtue. By these the violence of our
passions is tamed, and our minds are form∣ed
to sobriety and reflection. In the varie∣ties
of life, occasioned by the vicissitude of
worldly fortune, we are inured to habits
both of the active and the suffering virtues.
How much soever we complain of the va∣nity
of the world, facts plainly show, that
if its vanity were less, it could not answer
the purpose of salutary discipline. Unsa∣tisfactory
as it is, its pleasures are still too
apt to corrupt our hearts. How fatal then
must the consequences have been, had it
yielded us more complete enjoyment? If,
with all its troubles, we are in danger of
being too much attached to it, how entirely
<PB N="193" REF="200"/>
would it have seduced our affections, if no
troubles had been mingled with its plea∣sures?</P>
<P>These observations serve in a great mea∣sure
to obviate the difficulties which arise
from the apparent vanity of the human
state, by showing how, upon the Christian
system, that vanity may be reconciled with
the infinite goodness of the Sovereign of the
Universe. The present condition of man
is not that for which he was originally de∣signed;
it is not to be his final state; and
during his passage through the world, the
distresses which he undergoes are rendered
medicinal and improving. After having
taken this view of things, the cloud which,
in the preceding part of the discourse, ap∣peared
to sit so thick upon human life be∣gins
to be dissipated. We now perceive that
man is not abandoned by his Creator. We
discern great and good designs going on in
his behalf. We are allowed to entertain
better hopes; and are encouraged to en∣quire,
as was proposed for the
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
III. HEAD of discourse, Whether there
be not in the present condition of human
life some real and solid enjoyments which
come not under the general charge of <HI>vanity
of vanities.</HI> The doctrine of the text is to
be considered as chiefly addressed to worldly
men. Them Solomon means to teach that
all expectations of bliss which rest solely on
earthly possessions and pleasures, shall end
in disappointment. But surely he did not
intend to assert that there is no material
difference in the pursuits of men, or that
no real happiness of any kind could now be
attained by the virtuous. For besides the
unanswerable objection which this would
form against the divine administration, it
would directly contradict what he elsewhere
asserts, that while <HI>God giveth sore travail to
the sinner, he giveth to the man that is good
in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. ii. 26.</NOTE>
It may, it must indeed be admitted, that
unmixed and complete happiness is un∣known
on earth. No regulation of con∣duct
can altogether prevent passions from
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>
disturbing our peace, and misfortunes from
wounding our heart. But after this con∣cession
is made, will it follow that there is
no object on earth which deserves our
pursuit, or that all enjoyment becomes
contemptible which is not perfect? Let
us survey our state with an impartial
eye, and be just to the various gifts of
Heaven. How vain soever this life, con∣sidered
in itself, may be, the comforts
and hopes of religion are sufficient to give
solidity to the enjoyments of the righ∣teous.
In the exercise of good affections,
and the testimony of an upright conscience;
in the sense of peace and reconciliation with
God through the great Redeemer of Man∣kind;
in the firm confidence of being con∣ducted
through all the trials of life by infi∣nite
wisdom and goodness; and in the joyjul
prospect of arriving in the end at immortal
felicity, they possess a happiness which,
descending from a purer and more perfect
region that this world, partakes not of its
vanity.</P>
<P>Besides the enjoyments peculiar to reli∣gion,
there are other pleasures of our pre∣sent
<PB N="196" REF="203"/>
sent state which, though of an inferiour
order, must not be overlooked in the esti∣mate
of human life. It is necessary to call
attention to these, in order to check that
repining and unthankful spirit to which
man is always too prone. Some degree of
importance must be allowed to the com∣forts
of health, to the innocent gratifications
of sense, and to the entertainment afforded
us by all the beautiful scenes of nature;
some to the pursuits and amusements of
social life; and more to the internal enjoy∣ments
of thought and reflexion, and to the
pleasures of affectionate intercourse with
those whom we love. These comforts are
often held in too low estimation, merely
because they are ordinary and common;
although that be the circumstance which
ought, in reason, to enhance their value.
They lie open, in some degree, to all; ex∣tend
through every rank of life, and fill up
agreeably many of those spaces in our pre∣sent
existence, which are not occupied with
higher objects, or with serious cares.</P>
<P>We are in several respects unjust to Pro∣vidence
in the computation of our pleasures
<PB N="197" REF="204"/>
and our pains. We number the hours
which are spent in distress or sorrow; but
we forget those which have passed away, if
not in high enjoyment, yet in the midst of
those gentle satisfactions, and placid emo∣tions,
which make life glide smoothly along.
We complain of the frequent disappoint∣ments
which we suffer in our pursuits. But
we recollect not that it is in pursuit, more
than in attainment, that our pleasure now
consists. In the present state of human na∣ture,
man derives more enjoyment from the
exertion of his active powers in the midst of
toils and efforts, than he could receive from
a still and uniform possession of the object
which he strives to gain. The solace of the
mind under all its labours, is hope; and
there are few situations which entirely ex∣clued
it. Forms of expected bliss are often
gleaming upon us through a cloud, to re∣vive
and exhilarate the most distressed. If
pains be scattered through all the conditions
of life, so also are pleasures. Happiness,
as far as life affords it, can be engrossed by no
rank of men to the exclusion of the rest; on
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>
the contrary, it is often found where, at
first view, it would have been least expect∣ed.
When the human condition appears
most depressed, the feelings of men, through
the gracious appointment of Providence,
adjust themselves wonderfully to their state,
and enable them to extract satisfaction from
sources that are totally unknown to others.
Were the great body of men fairly to com∣pute
the hours which they pass in ease, and
even with some degree of pleasure, they
would be found far to exceed the number
of those which are spent in absolute pain
either of body or mind.—But in order to
make a still more accurate estimation of
the degree of satisfaction which, in the midst
of earthly vanity, man is permitted to enjoy,
the three following observations claim our
attention,</P>
<P>THE first is, that many of the evils which
occasion our complaints of the world are
wholly imaginary. They derive their ex∣istence
from fancy and humour, and child∣ish
subjection to the opinions of others.
<PB N="199" REF="206"/>
The distress which they produce, I admit,
is real; but its reality arises not from the
nature of things, but from that disorder of
imagination which a small measure of re∣flection
might rectify. In proof of this we
may observe, that the persons who live most
simply, and follow the dictates of plain un∣adulterated
nature, are most exempted from
this class of evils. It is among the higher
ranks of mankind that they chiefly abound;
where fantastic resinements, sickly delicacy,
and eager emulation, open a thousand
sources of vexation peculiar to themselves.
Life cannot but prove vain to them who
affect a disrelish of every pleasure that is
not both exquisite and new; who measure
enjoyment, not by their own feelings, but
by the standard of fashion; who think
themselves miserable if others do not ad∣mire
their state. It is not from wants or
sorrows that their complaints arise; but,
though it may appear a paradox, from too
much freedom from sorrow and want; from
the languor of vacant life, and the irritation
occasioned by those stagnating humours
<PB N="200" REF="207"/>
which ease and indulgence have bred within
them. In their case, therefore, it is not the
vanity of the world, but the vanity of their
minds, which is to be accused. Fancy has
raised up the spectres which haunt them.
Fancy has formed the cloud which hangs
over their life. Did they allow the light
of reason to break forth, the spectres would
vanish, and the cloud be dispelled.</P>
<P>THE second observation on this head is,
that of those evils which may be called real,
because they owe not their existence to
fancy, nor can be removed by rectifying
opinion, a great proportion is brought upon
us by our own misconduct. Diseases, po∣verty,
disappointment and shame are far
from being, in every instance, the unavoid∣able
doom of men. They are much more
frequently the offspring of their own mis∣guided
choice. Intemperance engenders
disease, sloth produces poverty, pride cre∣ates
disappointments, and dishonesty exposes
to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame. The ungoverned passions of men
betray them into a thousand follies; their
<PB N="201" REF="208"/>
follies into crimes; and their crimes into
misfortunes. Yet nothing is more com∣mon
than for such as have been the authors
of their own misery, to make loud com∣plaints
of the hard fate of man, and to take
revenge upon the human condition by ar∣raigning
its supposed vanity. <HI>The foolish∣ness
of man first perverteth his way, and then
his heart fretteth against the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>I do not, however, maintain that it is
within our power to be altogether free of
those self-procured evils. For perfection of
any kind is beyond the reach of man.
Where is the wisdom that never errs?
Where the just man that offendeth not?
Nevertheless, much is here left to our∣selves;
and, imperfect as we are, the con∣sequences
of right or of wrong conduct
make a wide difference in the happiness of
men. Experience every day shows that a
sound, a well-governed, and virtuous mind
contributes greatly to smooth the path of
life; and that <HI>wisdom excelleth folly as far
as light excelleth darkness. The way of the
wicked is as darkness; they know not at what
<PB N="202" REF="209"/>
they stumble. But the righteousness of the
perfect shall direct his way; and he that
walketh uprightly, walketh surely.</HI> The
tendency of the one is towards a plain and
safe region. The course of the other leads
him amidst snares and precipices. The one
occasionally may, the other unavoidably
must, incur much trouble. Let us not
then confound, under one general charge,
those evils of the world which belong to the
lot of humanity, and those which, through
divine assistance, a wise and good man may,
in a great measure, escape.</P>
<P>THE third observation which I make re∣spects
those evils which are both real and
unavoidable; from which neither wisdom
nor goodness can procure our exemption.
Under these this comfort remains, that if
they cannot be prevented, there are means,
however, by which they may be much al∣leviated.
Religion is the great principle
which acts, under such circumstances, as the
corrective of human vanity. It inspires
fortitude, supports patience, and by its
<PB N="203" REF="210"/>
prospects and promises darts a cheering ray
into the darkest shade of human life. If it
cannot secure the virtuous from disappoint∣ment
in their pursuits, it forms them to such
a temper as renders their disappointments
more light and easy than those of other men.
If it does not banish dissatisfaction from
their worldly pleasures, it confers spiritual
pleasures in their stead. If it ens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res them
not the possession of what they love, it fur∣nishes
comfort under the loss. As far as it
establishes a contented frame of mind, it
supplies the want of all that worldly men
covet to possess. Compare the behaviour
of the sensual and corrupted with that of the
upright and holy, when both are feeling the
effects of human vanity, and the difference
of their situation will be manifest. Among
the former you are likely to find a querulous
and dejected, among the latter, a composed
and manly spirit. The lamentations of the
one excite a mixture of pity and contempt;
while the dignity which the other maintain
in distress commands respect. The suffer∣ings
of the former settle into a peevish and
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
fretful disposition; those of the latter soften
the temper and improve the heart. These
consequences extend so far as to give ground
for asserting, that a good man enjoys more
happiness in the course of a seemingly un∣prosperous
life, than a bad man does in the
midst of affluence and luxury. What a
conspicuous proof of this is afforded by the
Apostle Paul, who from the very depth of
affliction could send forth such a triumphant
voice as proclaims the complete victory
which he had gained over the evils of life?
<HI>Troubled on every side, yet not distressed;
perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but
not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.
For though our outward man perish, our in∣ward
man is renewed, day by day</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Corinth. iv. 8, 9. 16.</NOTE> Such,
though perhaps in an inferior degree, will
be the influence of a genuine religious prin∣ciple
upon all true Christians. It begins to
perform that office to them here, which here∣after
it will more completely discharge, of
<HI>wiping away the tears from their eyes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="212"/>
Such, upon the whole, is the estimate
which we are to from of human life. Much
vanity will always belong to it; though the
degree of its vanity will depend, in a great
measure, on our own character and con∣duct.
To the vicious, it presents nothing
but a continued scene of disappointment and
dissatisfaction. To the good, it is a mixed
state of thing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; where many real comforts
may be enjoyed; where many resources
under trouble may be obtained; but where
trouble, in one form or other, is to be ex∣pected
as the lot of man. From this view
of human life.</P>
<P>The first practical conclusion which we
are to draw is, that it highly concerns us
not to he unreasonable in our expectations
of worldly felicity. Let us always remem∣ber
where we are; from what causes the
human state has become subject to depres∣sion;
and upon what accounts it must re∣main
under its present law. Such is the
infatuation of self-love, that though in the
general doctrine of the vanity of the world
<PB N="206" REF="213"/>
all men agree, yet almost every one flatters
himself that his own case is to be an excep∣tion
from the common rule. He rests on
expectations which he thinks can not fail
him; and though the present b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not altoge∣ther
according to his wish, yet with the
confidence of certain hope he anticipates
futurity. Hence the anguish of disappoint∣ment
sills the world; and evils, which are
of themselves sufficiently severe, opppress with
double force the unprepared and unsuspect∣ing
mind. Nothing therefore is of greater
consequence to our peace, than to have al∣ways
before our eyes such views or the
world as shall prevent our expecting more
from it than it is destined to afford. We
destroy our joys by devouring them before∣hand
with too eager expectation. We ruin
the happiness of life when we attempt to
raise it too high. A tolerable and comfort∣able
state is all that we can propose to our∣selves
on earth. Peace and contentment,
not bliss nor transport, is the full portion of
man. Perfect joy is reserved for heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="214"/>
But while we repress too sanguine hopes
formed upon human life, let us, in the se∣cond
place, guard against the other extreme
of repining and discontent. Enough has
been already said to shew, that notwith∣standing
the vanity of the world, a consi∣derable
degree of comfort is attainable in the
Present state. Let the recollection of this
serve to reconcile us to our condition, and
to check the arrogance of complaints and
murmur.—What art thou, O son of man!
who having sprung but yesterday out of the
dust, darest to lift up they voice against thy
Maker, and to arraign his providcence, be∣cause
all things are not ordered according
to they wish? What title hast thou to find
fault with the order of the universe, whose
lot is so much beyond what thy virtue or
merit gave thee ground to claim? Is is no∣thing
to thee to have been introduced into
this magnificent world; to have been ad∣mitted
as a spectator of the divine wisdom
and works; and to have had access to all
the comforts which nature, with a bountiful
hand, has poured forth around thee? Are
<PB N="208" REF="215"/>
all the hours forgotten which thou hast passed
in ease, in complacency, or joy? Is it a
small favour in thy eyes, that the hand of
divine mercy has been stretched forth to aid
thee, and, if thou reject not its proffered
assistance, is ready to conduct thee into a
happier state of existence? When thou com∣parest
thy condition with thy desert, blush,
and be ashamed of they complaints. Be silent,
be grateful, and adore. Receive with thank∣fulness
the blessings which are allowewd thee.
Revere that government which at present
refuses thee more. Rest in this conclusion,
that though there be evils in the world, its
Creator is wise and good, and has been
bountiful to thee.</P>
<P>In the third place, the view which we
have taken of human life should naturally
direct us to such pursuits as may have most
influence for correcting its vanity. There
are tow great lines of conduct which offer
themselves to our choice. The one leads
towards the goods of the mind; the other
towards those of fortune. The former,
<PB N="209" REF="216"/>
which is adopted only by the few, engages
us chiefly in forming our principles, regu∣lating
our dispositions, improving all our
inward powers. The latter, which in every
age has been followed by the multitude,
points at no other end but attaining the
conveniencies and pleasures of external life.
It is obvious that, in this last pursuit, the
vanity of the world will encounter us at
every step. For this is the region in which
it reigns, and where it chiefly displays its
power. At the same time, to lay the world
totally out of view is a vain attempt. The
numberless ties by which we are connected
with external things, put it out of our power
to behold them with indifference. But
though we cannot wrap ourselves up en∣tirely
in the care of the mind, yet the more
we make its welfare our chief object, the
nearer shall we approach to that happy in∣dependence
on the world which places us
beyond the reach of suffering from its
vanity.</P>
<P>That discipline, therefore, which corrects
the eagerness of worldly passions, which
<PB N="210" REF="217"/>
fortisies the heart with virtuous principles,
which enlightens the mind with useful
knowledge, and furnishe; to it matter of
enjoyment from within itself, is of more
consequence to real felicity, than all the pro∣vision
which we can make of the goods of
fortune. To this let us bend our chief at∣tention.
Let us <HI>keep the heart with all di∣ligence,
seeing out of it are the issues of life.</HI>
Let us account our mind the most important
province which is committed to our care;
and if we cannot rule fortune, study at least
to rule ourselves. Let us propose for our
object, not worldy success, which it de∣pends
not on us to obtain; but that upright
and honourable discharge of our duty in
every conjuncture, which, though the di∣vine
assistance, is always within our power.
Let our happiness be sought where our pro∣per
praise is found; and that be accounted
our only real evil, which is the evil of our
nature; not that, which is either the ap∣pointment
of Providence, or which arises
from the evil of others.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="218"/>
But in order to carry on with success
this rational and manly plan of conduct, it
is necessary, in the last place, that to moral,
we join religious discipline, Under the
present imperfection of our minds, and
amidst the frequent shocks which we receive
from human evils, much do we stand in
need of every assistance for supporting our
constancy. Of all assistance to which we
can have recourse, none is so powerful as
what may be derived from the principles of
the Christian faith. He who builds on any
other foundation will find, in the day of
trial, that he had built his house on the sand.
Man is formed by his nature to look up to
a superiour Being, and to lean upon a strength
that is greater that his own. All the con∣fiderations
which we can offer for confirm∣ing
his mind, presuppose this resource, and
derive from it their principal efficacy.</P>
<P>Never then let us lose sight of those great
objects which religion brings under our
view, if we hope to stand firm and erect
amidst the dangers and distresses of our pre∣sent
state. Let us cultivate all that con∣nection
<PB N="212" REF="219"/>
with the great Father of Spirits
which our condition admits; by piety and
prayer; by dependence on his aid, and trust
in his promises; by a devout sense of his
presence, and a continual endeavour to ac∣quire
his grace and favour. Let us, with
humble faith and reverence, commit our∣selves
to the blessed Redeemer of the world;
encouraged by the discoveries which he has
made to us of the divine mercy, and by the
hopes which he has afforded us of being
raised to a nobler and happier station in the
kingdom of God. So shall virtue, grounded
upon piety, attain its full strength. Inspired
with a religious spirit, and guided by ra∣tional
principles, we shall be enabled to
hold a steady course through this mixed
region of pleasure and pain, of hopes and
fears; until the period arrive when that
cloud which the present vanity of the world
throws over human affairs shall entirely dis∣appear,
and eternal light be diffused over all
the works and ways of God.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ON DEATH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM. Xxiii. 4.</BIBL>
<Q>Yea though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>This Psalm exhibits the pleasing pic∣ture
of a pious man rejoicing in the
goodness of Heaven.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VIII.</NOTE> He looks around him
on his state, and his heart overflows with
gratitude. when he reviews the past part
of his life, he contemplates God as his
<HI>shepherd who bath made him lie down in
green pastures, and led him beside the still
waters.</HI> When he considers the present, he
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
beholds his divine benefactor <HI>preparing a
table for him in the presence of his enemies,
and making his cup run over.</HI> When he
looks forward to the future, he consides in
the same goodness, as continuing to <HI>follow
him all the days of his life, and bringing him
to dwell in the house of the Lord for over.</HI>
Amidst these images of tranquillity and hap∣piness,
one object presents itself, which is
sufficient to overeast the minds and to damp
the joy of the greatest part of men; that is,
the approach of death. But on the Psalmist
it produced no such effect. With perfect
composure and serenity he looks forward to
the time when he is to pass through <HI>the val∣ley
of the shadow of death.</HI> The prospect,
instead of dejecting him, appears to heighten
his triumph, by that security which the pre∣sence
of his almighty guardian afforded him.
<HI>I will fear no evil, for thou art with me:</HI>
and pursuing the allusion with which he
had begun, exults in the hope that the shep∣herd
who had hitherto conducted him would
support him with his <HI>staff,</HI> while he passed
through that dark and perilous region, and
<PB N="215" REF="222"/>
with his <HI>rod,</HI> or pastoral crook, would guard
him from every danger.</P>
<P>Such is the happy diftinction which
good men enjoy, in a situation the most
formidable to human nature. That threat∣ening
spectre which appalls others, carries
no terrour to them. While worldly men
are justly said <HI>through fear of death to be
all their life-time subject to bondage,</HI> to the
righteous only it belongs to look on death,
and smile. Since then it is in the power
of religion to confer upon us so high a
privilege, let us adventure to contemplate
steadily this last foe whom we must all en∣counter.
Let us consider what death is in
itself, and by what means good men are
enabled to meet it with fortitude. Though
the subject may be reckoned gloomy, it
must be admitted to be interesting. The
close of life is a solemn and important
event, to which every wise man will have
regard in the general tenour of his conduct.
No one can act his part with propriety,
who considers not how it is to terminate;
and to exclude form our thoughts what we
<PB N="216" REF="223"/>
cannot prevent form actually taking place,
is the refuge of none but the timorous and
weak. We are more encouraged to enter
on this meditation by reflecting on the su∣periour
advantages which, as Christians,
we enjoy for overcoming the fear of death,
beyond that holy man whose sentiment is
now before us. Those great objects, which
he beheld through the medium of types
and figures, are clearly revealed to us. That
dispensation of greace, which in his days
began to open, is now completed. That
life and immortality, which then only dawn∣ed
on the world, have now shone forth
with full light and splendour.</P>
<P>DEATH may be considered in three
views; as the separation of the soul from
the body; as the conclusion of the present
life; as the entrance into a new state of
existence. In the first view, it is regarded
as painful and agonizing. In the second,
it is melancholy and dejecting. In the
third, it is awful and alarming. One of the
first enquiries which occurs concerning it is,
<PB N="217" REF="224"/>
for what purposes it was clothed with all
these terrours? Why, under the govern∣ment
of a gracious Being, the termination
of life was loaded with so much sorrow and
distress? We know that, in consequence of
the fall, death was inflicted as punishment
upon the human race. But no unnecessary
severities are ever exercised by God; and
the wisdom and goodness of the divine plan
will be much illustrated, by observing that
all the formidable circumstances which at∣tend
death are, in the present situation of
mankind, absolutely requisite to the pro∣per
government of the world. The ter∣rours
of death are, in fact, the great guar∣dians
of life. They excite in every indivi∣dual
that desire of self-preservation, which
is nature's first law. They reconcile him
to bearing the distresses of life with patience.
They prompt him to undergo its useful
and necessary labours with alacrity; and
they restrain him from many of those evil
courses by which his safety would be en∣dangered.
While they are in so many re∣spects
beneficial to the individual, they are
<PB N="218" REF="225"/>
at the same time, the safeguard of society.
If death were not dreaded and abhorred as
it is by men, no public order could be pre∣served
in the world. The sword of autho∣rity
were lifted up in vain. The fanctions
of law would lose their effect. The scaf∣fold
and the executioner would be derided;
and the violent lest to trample unrestrained
on the rights of the peaceful. If, notwith∣standing
the restraints which self-preserva∣tion
imposes, society is so often disturbed
by the crimes of the wicked, what a scene
of confusion would it become, if capital
punishments, which are the last resource
of governments, were of no influence to
deter offenders?</P>
<P>For such important ends the conclusion
of life has, by the appointment of Provi∣dence,
been made an awful object. The
valley of death has been planted with ter∣rours
to the apprehension of men. Here,
as in many other instances, what seemed
at first to arraign the goodness of the Deity,
is upon enquiry found to consirm it. But
though, for the most salutary purposes, it
<PB N="219" REF="226"/>
was requisite that the fear of death should
be a powerful principle in human nature,
yet, like our other propensities, it is apt,
when left to itself, to run into excess. Over
many it usurps such an ascendant as to de∣base
their character, and to defeat the
chief ends of livings. To preserve it within
such bounds that it shall not interrupt us in
performing the proper offices and duties
of life, is the distinction of the brave man
above the coward; and to surmount it in
such a degree that it shall not, even in near
prospect, deject our spirit, or trouble our
peace, is the great preference which virture
enjoys above guilt. It has been the study
of the wise and reflecting, in every age, to
attain this steadiness of mind. Philosophy
pursued it as its chief object; and professed
that the great end of its discipline was, to
enable its votaries to conquer the fear of
death. Let us then, before we have re∣course
to the more powerful aid of religion,
hearken for a little to what reason has sug∣gested
on this subject. Her assistance may,
perhaps, be not entirely despicable; and
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
though the armour which she offers be not
completely of proof, it may serve, how∣ever,
to turn aside, or to blunt some of
the shafts which are aimed against us by
the last foe.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner she may be supposed
to address mankind, in order to reconcile
them to their fate.—Children of man!
it is well known to you that you are a
mortal race. Death is the law of your
nature, the tribute of your being, the debt
which all are bound to pay. On these
terms you received life, that you should be
ready to give it up when Providence calls
you to make room for other, who in like
manner, when their time is come, shall
follow you. He who is unwilling to sub∣mit
to death when heaven decrees it, de∣serves
not to have lived. You might as
reasonably complain that you did not live
before the time appointed for your coming
into the world, as lament that you are not
to live longer when the period of your
quitting it is arrived. What divine Provi∣dence
<PB N="221" REF="228"/>
hath made necessary, human pru∣dence
ought to comply with cheerfully.
Submit at any rate you must; and is it not
much better to follow of your own accord,
than to be dragged reluctantly, and by
force? What privilege have you to plead,
or what reason to urge, why you should
possess an exemption from the common
doom? All things around you are mortal
and perishing. Cities, states, and empires
have their period set. The proudest monu∣ments
of human art moulder into dust.
Even the works of nature wax old and
decay. In the midst of this universal ten∣dency
to change, could you expect that to
your frame alone a permanent duration
should be given? All who have gone be∣fore
you have submitted to the stroke of
death. All who are to come after you
shall undergo the same fate. The great
and the good, the prince and the peasant,
the renowned and the obscure, travel alike
the road which leads to the grave. At the
moment when you expire, thousands
throughout the world shall, together with
<PB N="222" REF="229"/>
you, be yielding up their breath. Can
that be held a great calamity which is com∣mon
to you with every thing that lives on
earth; which is an event as much accord∣ing
to the course of nature as it is that
leaves should fall in autumn, or that fruit
should drop from the tree when it is fully
ripe?</P>
<P>The pain of death cannot be very long,
and is probably less se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere than what you
have at other times experienced. The pomp
of death is more terr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing than death itself.
It is to the weakness: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>gination that it
owes its chief power of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>ting your spi∣rits;
for when the force of the mind is
rouzed, there is almost no passion in our
nature but what has showed itself able to
overcome the fear of death. Honour has
defied death; love has despised it; shame
has rushed upon it; revenge has disregarded
it; grief a thousand times has wished for it.
Is it not strange that reason and virtue can∣not
give you strength to surmount that fear,
which, even in feeble minds, so many pas∣sions
have conquered? What inconsistency
<PB N="223" REF="230"/>
is there in complaining so much of the evils
of life, and being at the same time so afraid
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f what is to terminate them all? Who can
tell whether his future life might not teem
with disasters and miseries, as yet unknown,
were it to be prolonged according to his
wish? At any rate, is it desireable to draw
life out to the last dregs, and to wait till old
age pour upon you its whole store of diseases
and sorrows? You lament that you are to
die; but did you view your situration pro∣perly,
you would have much greater cause
to lament if you were chained to this life
for two or three hundred years, without
possibility of release. Expect therefore
calmly that which is natural in itself, and
which must be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because it is the ap∣pointment
of heaven. Perform your duty
as a good subject of the Deity, during the
time allotted you; and rejoice that a
period is fixed for your dismission from the
present warfare. Remember that the sla∣vish
dread of death destroys all the comfort
of that life which you seek to preserve.
Better to undergo the stroke of death at
<PB N="224" REF="231"/>
once, than to live in perpetual misery from
the fear of dying.</P>
<P>SUCH discourses as these are specious at
least, and plausible. The arguments are not
without strength, and ought to produce some
effect on a considerate reflecting mind. But
it is to be suspected that their effect will be
chiefly felt when the mind is calm and at
ease; rather when speculating upon death
at a distance, than when beholding it at
hand. When the critical moment arrives
which places the anxious, trembling soul on
the borders of an unknown world, reason∣ings
drawn from necessity and propriety
will be of small avail to quiet its alarms. In
order to afford relief, you must give it hope;
you must promise it protection; you must
offer somewhat on which it can lay hold for
support, amidst the struggles of labouring
nature. Hence the great importance of
those discoveries which revelation has made,
and of those principles with which it fortifies
the heart. To the consideration of these let
us next proceed, and observe their superiour
<PB N="225" REF="232"/>
efficacy for surmounting the fear of death.
In order to judge of their importance, it
will be proper to take a view of death in
each of those lights in which it appears most
formidable to mankind.</P>
<P>IT may be considered, first, as the ter∣mination
of our present existence; the final
period of all its joys and hopes. The con∣cluding
scene of any course of action in
which we have been engaged with pleasure,
even the last sight of objects which we have
been long accustomed to behold, seldom
fails of striking the mind with painful re∣gret.
How many circumstances will concur
to heighten that regret, when the time comes
of our bidding an eternal adieu to the light
of day; to every pursuit which had occu∣pied
our attention as citizens of the world;
and to every friend and relation who had
attached our hearts? How dejecting is the
thought to the greatest part of men, that
the sun shall rise, and the seasons shall re∣turn
to others, but no more to them; and
that while their neighbours are engaged in
<PB N="226" REF="233"/>
the usual affairs of life, they shall be shut
up in a dark and lonesome mansion, for∣gotten,
and cut off from among men, as
though they had never been! <HI>I said, in the
cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates
of the grave. I am deprived of the residue of
my years. I shall not see the Lord again in
the land of the living. I shall behold man no
more with the inhabitants of the world</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xxxviii. 10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Let us now observe, that the dejection
into which we are apt to sink at such a
juncture, will bear proportion to the degree
of our attachment to the objects which we
leave, and to the importance of those re∣sources
which remain with us when they
are gone. He who is taking farewell of a
country through which he had traveled
with satisfaction, and he who is driven from
his native land, with which he had con∣nected
every idea of settlement and com∣fort,
will have very different feelings at the
time of departure. Such is the difference
which, at the hour of death, takes places be∣tween
the righteous and the ungodly. The
<PB N="227" REF="234"/>
latter knows nothing higher or better than
the present state of existence. His interests,
his pleasures, his expectation, all centered
here. He lived solely for the enjoyments
of this world. Dreadful, therefore, and in∣supportable
must be that event which sepa∣rates
him from these for ever. Whereas the
culture of religion had previously formed
the mind of a Christian for a calm and easy
transition from this life. It had instructed
him in the proper estimate of sublunary
happiness. It had set higher prospects be∣fore
him. It had formed him to a more
refined taste of enjoyments than what the
common round of worldly amusements
could gratify. It gave him connections
and alliances with spiritual objects, which
are unknown to the men of the world.
Hence, though he be attached to life by the
natural feelings of humanity, he is raised
above the weak and unmanly regret of part∣ing
with it. He knew that it was intended
as preparatory only to a succeeding state.
As soon as the season of preparation should
be finished, he expected a removal; and
<PB N="228" REF="235"/>
when Providence gives the signal, he bids
adieu to the world with composed resolu∣tion,
and undisturbed heart.—What though
death interrupt him in the middle of his
designs, and break off the plans which he
had formed of being useful to his family
and the world? All these he leaves with
tranquillity in the hands of that Providence
to which he has ever been accustomed to
look up with resignation; which governed
the world wisely and graciously before he
existed; and which he knows will continue
to govern it with equal wisdom and benig∣nity,
when he shall be in to no more. The
time of his departure was not left to his
own choice; but he believes it to be the
most proper, because it is the time chosen
by Him who cannot err. <HI>Honourable age
is not that which standeth in length of time,
nor that which is measured by number
of years. But wisdom is the grey hair to
man; and an unspotted life is old age</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisd. of Solomon, iv. 8. 9.</NOTE>.
When he behold his friends and relations
mourning around him, his heart may melt,
<PB N="229" REF="236"/>
but will not be overpowered; for it is re∣lieved
by the thought that he is bidding
them only a temporary, not an eternal fare∣wel.
He commends them, in the mean
time, to the blessing of the God whom he
has served; and while he is parting from
them, he hears a vice which sooths his
spirit with those comforting words, <HI>Leave
thy satherless children; I will preserve them
alive; and let thy widow trust in me</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xlix. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT death is more than the conclusion
of human life. It is the gate which, at the
same time that it closes on this world, opens
into eternity. Under this view, it has often
been the subject of terrour to the serious
and reflecting. The transition they were
about to make was awful. Before them lay
a vast undiscovered region, from whose
bounds no traveler ever returned to bring
information of the reception which he found,
or of the objects which he met with there.
The first conception which suggests itself is,
that the disembodied spirit is to appear be∣fore
<PB N="230" REF="237"/>
its Creator, who is then to act as its
judge. The strict inquisiton which it must
undergo, the impartial doom which it must
hear pronounced, and the unalterable state
to which it shall be assigned, are awful
forms rising before the imagination. They
are ideas which conscience forces upon all.
Mankind can neither avoid considering
themselves as accountable creatures, nor
avoid viewing death as the season when
their account is to be given. Such a senti∣ment
is with m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the source of dread;

are then, too generally, superficial; slight ex∣cuses
satisfy their minds, and the avocations
of life prevent their attention from dwelling
long on disagreeable subjects. But when
altogether withdrawn from the affairs of the
world, they are left to their own reflections
on past conduct; with their spirits enfeebled
by disease, and their minds impressed with
the terrours of an invisible region; the most
resolute are apt to despond, and even the
virtuous are in danger of sinking under the
remembrance of their errours and frailties.
The trembling mind casts every where
around an anxious exploring eye after any
powder that can uphold, any mercy that will
shield an save it. And accordingly we see
how eagerly every device has been embraced
which superstition could invent in various
countries, for quieting the alarms of the de∣parting
spirit.</P>
<P>Here appears the great importance of
those discoveries which Christianity has made
concerning the government of the universe.
<PB N="232" REF="239"/>
It displays the ensigns of grace and cle∣mency.
It reveals the Almighty not as a
creator only and a judge, but as a compas∣sionate
parent, <HI>who knows our srame, who
remembers we are dust, who pities us as a sa∣ther
pritieth his children; and with whom there
is sorgiveness,</HI> that he may be loved as well
as feared. These general view, however,
of the divine administration, would not
have been sufficient to give full relief, if
they had not been confirmed by certain de∣cisive
facts, to which the mind can appeal
amidst all its doubts and fears. Two such
facts the Gospel holds forth to us, particu∣larly
adapted to the situation of human na∣ture
in its greatest extremity; the atone∣ment,
and the intercession of Christ. There
is no sentiment more natural to men than
this, that guilt must be expiated by suffer∣ing.
All government is founded on the
principle, that public justice requires com∣pensation
for crimes; and all religions pro∣ceed
upon the belief, that, in order to the
pardon of the sinner, atonement must be
made to the justice of heaven. Hence the
<PB N="233" REF="240"/>
endless variety of sacrifices, victims, and
expiations which have filled the earth. The
great sacrifice which our Redeemer offered
for guilt, coincides with these natural sen∣timents
of mankind in giving ease to the
heart. It shows us the forfeit of guilt paid
by a divine personage in our behalf; and
allows us to look up to the Governour of
the world, as merciful to the guilty in con∣sistency
with justice and order. But still
some anxiety might remain concerning the
extension of that mercy to our own case in
particular. An invisible sovereign is an
awful idea; almighty, unknown power is
always formidable, and would be ready to
overwhelm the spirit of the feeble, were not
an intercessor with that soverign revealed.
This intercessor is one who lived and acted
in our own nature; who not only knows
but who experienced our frailty; who has
all the feelings of a brother of human in∣firmity
and distress; who himself passed
through that <HI>valley of the shadow of death</HI>
which is now opening on us; to whose
powerful mediation with his father we have
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
every encouragement to commit the charge
of our departing spirits.—Such is the provi∣sion
which Christianity has made for com∣forting
the last hours of man. The atone∣ment,
and the intercession of Christ, are the
refuge of the penitent sinner, and the con∣solation
of the saint. By their means the
throne of the universe if encircled with
mercy. The cloud which hung over the
invisible world begins to be dispersed; and
hope brightens through the gloom.</P>
<P>BUT what completes the triumph of good
men over death is, the prospect of eternal
felicity. This was the great object after
which all nations have sighed, as the only
complete remedy both of the miseries of life
and the fears of death. On this, the learned
and the ignorant, the civilized and the sa∣vage
tribes of mankind bent their longing
eyes; eagerly grasping at every argument,
and fondly indulging every hope, that could
promise them a propoitious Deity, and the
prolongation of existence in a happier state.
But beyond wishes and feeble expectation,
<PB N="235" REF="242"/>
the light of nature could hardly reach.
Even the most cultivated, philosophical mind
was, at the hour of dissolution, left in pain∣ful
suspense. Christianity has put an end
to all hesitation and doubt on this important
subject. It has drawn aside the v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il through
which reason essayed to penetrate; and has
displayed to full view the future dwellings
of the spirits of the just, the mansions of
everlasting rest, <HI>the city of the living God.</HI>
Not only has it informed us that a state of
perfect felicity is prepared for the righteous,
but it has added to this information a variety
of circumstances which render that state
sensible to our imagination, and e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>couraging
to our hopes. It represents it as fully se∣cured
by the gracious undertaking of the
Saviour of the world. It describes it as <HI>an
inheritance,</HI> to which he has given his fol∣lowers
a right and title. He is said to have
taken possession of it in the name. He
rose from the grave as <HI>the sirst-fruits of them
that sleep;</HI> and under the character of their
<HI>fore-runn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> entered into the heavenly re∣gions.
<HI>I am the resurrection and the life.
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
He that believeth on me, though he were dead,
yet shall be live. I give unto my sheep eter∣nal
life. I ascend to my Father and your
Father, to my God and you God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xi. 25. xx. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>Hence, to those who have lived a vir∣tuous
life, and who die in the faith of
Christ, the whole aspect of death is changed.
Death is to them no longer the tyrant who
approaches with his iron rod, but the mes∣senger
who brings the tidings of life and
liberty. The prospects which open to them
cheer their minds. Even in the valley of
death's shade, <HI>green pastures</HI> appear to rise.
They view themselves as going forth, not
to lie silent and solitary in the darkness of
the grave, not to wander forsaken in the
wide deserts of the universe, not even to
pass into a region where they are altogether
strangers and unknown; but to enter on a
land, new indeed to sight, but by faith and
hope frequented long besore; where they
shall continue to be under the charge of him
who hath hitherto been their guardian, be
re-united to many of their ancient and be∣loved
<PB N="237" REF="244"/>
friends, and admitted to join the <HI>in∣numerable
multitude, gathered out of all
nations and tongues and people, who stand
before the throne of God.</HI> They leave be∣hind
the dregs of their nature; and ex∣change
this consined and gloomy apartment
of the universe, for the glorious mansions
of their Father's house. Blessed surely are
the dying in this hope, and <HI>blessed the dead</HI>
in this fruition, <HI>resting from their labours
and followed by their works.</HI> Good men
are detained at present in the outer court of
the temple: Death admits them into the
holy place. As yet they sojourn in the
territories of pilgrimage and exile: Death
brings them home to the native land of
Sprits. In this world they are divided
from one another, and mingled with the
worthless and the vile: Death unites in one
assembly all the pure and the just. <HI>In the
sight of the universe they seemed to die, and
their d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture was taken for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ller d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion.
But they are is peace. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd

with the most High</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisdom of Solomon iii. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.—v. 15.</NOTE>—<HI>O Death! where
<PB N="238" REF="245"/>
is now thy sling? O Grave! where is the
victory?</HI> Where are the terrours with
which thou hast so long affrighted the na∣tion?
Where are the dreary and desolate
domains, the haunts of spectres and shades,
the abhorred dwellings of darkness and
corruption? At the touch of the divine
rod, they visionary horrours have fled. The
spell is broken. The dawn of the celestial
morning has dispelled thy dismal gloom;
and instead of the <HI>habitation of dragons,</HI> ap∣pears
the paradise of God.</P>
<P>BUT supposing both the regreat of qui∣ting
life, and the dread of entering into a
future state to be overcome, there is still
one circumstance which renders death form∣idable
to many, that is, the shock which
nature is apprehended to sustain at the se∣paration
of the soul from the body.
Fromidable, I admit, this may justly ren∣der
it to them whose languishing spirits
have no inward fund whence they can then
draw relief. Firmness and strength of
mind is peculiarly requisite for the support
of nature in its last extremity; and that
<PB N="239" REF="246"/>
strength is supplied by religion. The testi∣mony
of a good conscience, and the re∣membrance
of a virtuous life, a well∣grounded
trust in the divine acceptance, and
a firm hope of future felicity, are principles
sufficient to give composure and fortitude
to the heart, even in the midst of agony.
In what a high degree they can suspend or
alleviate the feelings of pain, has been fully
demonstrated by the magnanimous beha∣viour
of such as have suffered death in the
cause of conscience and religion. How
often has the world beheld them advancing
to meet that supposed king of terrours, not
with calmness only, but with joy; raised
by divine prospects and hopes into an en∣tire
neglect and contempt of bodily suffer∣ing?</P>
<P>It is not without reason that a peculiar
assistance from heaven is looked for by good
men, at the hour of death. As they are
taught to believe, that in all the emergan∣cies
of their life divine goodness has watched
over them, they have ground to conclude,
that at the last it will not forsake them; but
<PB N="240" REF="247"/>
that at the season when its aid is most
needed, it shall be most liberally commu∣nicated.
Accordingly, a persuasion so con∣gruous
to the benignity and compassion of
the Father of mercies has been the comfort
of pious men in every age. <HI>My flesh and
my heart faileth; but God is the strength of
my heart. In the valley of the shadow of
death I well fear no evil, for thou art with
me.</HI> When <HI>the rod and staff</HI> of this shepherd
of Israel are held forth to his expiring ser∣vants,
declining nature needs no other sup∣port.
The secret influence of his reviving
spirit is sufficient for their consolation and
strength, while the painful struggle with
mortality lasts; till at length, when the
moment arrives the <HI>the silver cord must be
loosed, and the golden bowl be broken,</HI> their
Almighty Protector carries off the immortal
spirit unhurt by the fall of its carthly taber∣nacle,
and places it in a better mansion.—
How respectable and happy is such a con∣clusion
of human life, when one in this
manner quits the stage of time, honoured
and supported with the presence of his
<PB N="241" REF="248"/>
Creator, and enjoying, till the last moment
of reflection, the pleasing thought, that he
has not lived in vain! <HI>I have fought a good
fight; I have finished my course; I have kept
the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me
a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the
righteous judge shall give me at that day</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 7, 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the view which we have taken
of the advantages possessed by good men for
overcoming the fears of death, the first sen∣timent
which should arise in our minds is
gratitude to Heaven for the hopes which
we enjoy by means of the Christian reli∣gion.
How depressed and calamitous was
the human condition, as long as the terrour
of death hung, like a dark cloud, over the
inhabitants of the earth; when, after all the
toils of life, the melancholy silence of the
grave appeared finally to close the scene of
existence; or, if a future state opened be∣hind
it, that state teemed with all those
forms of horrour which conscioius guilt
could suggest to a terrified imagination!
<PB N="242" REF="249"/>
The happiest change which ever took place
in the circumstances of the humar race, is
that produced by the discoveries with which
we are blessed concerning the government
of the universe, the redemption, of the world,
and the future destination of man. How
much dignity is thereby added to the hu∣man
character and state? What light and
cheerfulness is introduced into our abode?
What eternal praise is due to Him who,
<HI>according to his abundant mercy, hath begot∣ten
us again into a lively hope, by the resur∣rection
of Jeses Christ from the dead, to an
inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that
fadeth not away, reserved in heaven?</HI></P>
<P>The next effect which the subject we
have considered should produce, is an ear∣nest
desire to acquire those advantages which
good men enjoy at their death. The road
which leads to them is plain and obvious.
A peaceful and happy death is, by the ap∣pointment
of Heaven, connected with a
holy band virtuous life. Let us renounce
criminal pursuits and pleasures; let us fear
<PB N="243" REF="250"/>
God and keep his commandments; let us
<HI>hold faith and a good conscience,</HI> if we hope
for comfort at our last hour. To prepare
for this last hour, every wise man should
consider as his most important concern.
Death many justly be held the test of life.
Let a man have supported his character
with esteem and applause, as long as he
acted on the busy stage of the world, if at
the end he sinks into dejection and terrour,
all his former honour is effaced; he departs
under the imputation of either a guilty con∣science,
or a pusillanimous mind. In the
other parts of human conduct, disguise and
subtlety many impose on the world; but
seldom can artifice be supported in the hour
of death. The mask most commonly falls
off, and the genuine character appears.
When we behold the scene of life closed
with proper composure and dignity, we na∣turally
infer integrity and fortitude. We
are led to believe that divine assistance sup∣ports
the soul, and we presage its transition,
into a happier mansion. <HI>Mark</HI> the perfect
<PB N="244" REF="251"/>
man and behold the upright; for the end of
that man is peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxxvii. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE last instruction which our subject
points out, respects the manner in which a
wise and good man ought to stand affected
towards life and death. He ought not to
be servilely attached to the one. He has
no reason abjectly to dread the other. Life
is the gift of God, which he may justly
cherish and hold dear. Nay, he is bound
by all fair means to guard and preserve it,
that he may continue to be useful in that
post of duty where Providence has placed
him. But there are higher principles to
which the love of life should remain sub∣ordinate.
Wherever religion, virtue, or
true honour, call him forth to danger, life
ought to be hazarded without fear. There
is a generous contempt of death which
should distinguish those who live and walk
by the faith of immortality. This is the
source of courage in a Christian. His be∣haviour
<PB N="245" REF="252"/>
ought to shew the elevation of his
soul above the present world; ought to dis∣cover
the liberty which he possesses of fol∣lowing
the native sentiments of his mind,
without any of those restraints and fetters
which the fear of death imposes on vicious
men.</P>
<P>At the same time, this rational contempt
of death must carefully be distinguished
from that inconsiderate and thoughtless in∣difference;
with which some have affected to
treat it. This is what cannot be justified
on any principle of reason. Human life is
no trifle, which men may play away at their
pleasure. Death, in every view, is an im∣portant
event. It is the most solemn crisis
of the human existence. A good man has
reason to meet it with a calm and firm mind.
But no man is entitled to treat it with osten∣tatious
levity. It calls for manly serious∣ness
of thought. It requires all the recol∣lection
of which we are capable; that with
the proper disposition of dependent beings,
when the dust is about to <HI>return to its dust,</HI>
we may deliver up <HI>the spirit to Him who
gave it.</HI></P>

<P>IN this mysterious book of Scripture many
revolutions are foretold which were to
take place in the church of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IX.</NOTE> They
are not indeed so foretold as to afford clear
and precise information concerning the time
<PB N="247" REF="254"/>
of their coming to pass. It would have
been, on many accounts, improper to have
lifted up too far that awful veil which covers
futurity. The intention of the Spirit of
God was not to gratify the curiosity of the
learned, by disclosing to them the fate of
monarchies and nations, but to satisfy the
serious concerning the general plan, and final
issue, of the divine government. Amidst
those distresses which befel Christians during
the first ages, the discoveries made in this
book were peculiarly seasonable; as they
shewed that there was an Almighty Guar∣dian,
who watched with particular attention
over the interests of the church which he
had formed; who foresaw all the commo∣tions
which were to happen among the
kingdoms of the earth, and would so over∣rule
them as to promote in the end the
cause of truth. This is the chief scope of
those mystic visions with which the Apostle
John was favoured<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of seals opened in
heaven; of trumpe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sounding; and vials
poured sorth. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kingdom of darkness
was to maintain for while a violent struggle

against the kingdom of light. But at the
conclusion, a voice was to be heard, <HI>as the
voice of many waters and of mighty thunder∣ings,
saying, Alleluiah, for the Lord God
omnipotent reigneth. The kingdoms of this
world are become the kingdoms of our Lord,
and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Revel. xix. 6.—xi. 15.</NOTE>.
Such is the prospect with which the divine
Spirit at intervals enlightens, and with which
he finally terminates, the many dark and
direful scenes that are exhibited in this book.
In closing the canon of Scripture, he, with
great propriety, leaves upon our mind deep
impressions of the triumphs of righteous∣ness,
and of the blessedness of the redeemed.
<HI>After this I beheld, and, lo! a great multi∣tude,
which no man could number, of all na∣tions,
and kindreds, and people, and tongues,
stood before the throne and before the Lamb,
clothed with white robes, and palms in their
hands.</HI></P>
<P>These words present a beautiful descrip∣tion
of the happiness of saints in heaven;
a subject on which it is, at all times, both
<PB N="249" REF="256"/>
comfortable and improving to meditate.
On this day, in particular, when we are to
commemorate the dying love of our Savi∣our,
we cannot be better employed than in
contemplating what his love hath purchas∣ed;
in order both to awaken our gratitude,
and to confirm our attachment to him. The
sacrament of the supper is the oath of our
fidelity. Let us dispose ourselves for cele∣brating
it, by taking a view of the rewards
which await the faithful. I shall, for this
end, in several observations from the words
of the text, taken in connection with the
context, endeavour to illustrate, in some
imperfect degree, the prospect which is
here afforded us of a state of future felicity;
and then shall make practical improvement
of the subject.</P>
<P>I. WHAT the words of the text most
obviously suggest is, that heaven is to be
considered as a state of blessed society. <HI>A
multitude,</HI> a numerous assembly, are here
represented as sharing together the same
felicity and honour. Without society, it is
<PB N="250" REF="257"/>
impossible for man to be happy. Place
him in a region where he was surrounded
with every pleasure; yet there, if he found
himself a solitary individual, he would pine
and languish. They are not merely our
wants, and our mutual dependence, but
our native instincts also, which impel us to
associate together. The intercourse which
we here maintain with our fellows, is a
source of our chief enjoyments. But, alas!
how much are these allayed by a variety of
disagreeable circumstances that enter into all
our connexions! Sometimes we suffer
from the distresses of those whom we love;
and sometimes from their vices or frailties.
Where friendship is cordial, it is exposed to
the wounds of painful sympathy, and to
the anguish of violent separation Where
it is so cool as not to occasion sympathetic
pains, it is never productive of much plea∣sure.
The ordinary commerce of the world
consists in a circulation of frivolous inter∣course,
in which the heart has no concern.
It is generally insipid, and often soured
by the slightest difference in humour, or op∣position
<PB N="251" REF="258"/>
of interest. We fly to company in
order to be relieved from wearisome corre∣spondence
with ourselves; and the vexations
which we meet with in society, drive us
back again into solitude. Even among the
virtuous, dissensions arise; and disagree∣ment
in opinion too often produces aliena∣tion
of heart. We form few connexions
where somewhat does not occur to disap∣point
our hopes. The beginnings are often
pleasing. We flatter ourselves with having
found those who will never give us any
disgust. But weaknesses are too soon dis∣covered.
Suspicions arise; and love waxes
cold. We are jealous of one another, and
accustomed to live in disguise. A studied
civility assumes the name without the pleasure
of friendship; and secret animosity and
envy are often concealed under the caresses
of dissembled affection.</P>
<P>Hence the pleasure of earthly society,
like all our other pleasures, is extremely im∣perfect;
and can give us a very faint con∣ception
of the joy that must arise from the
society of perfect spirits in a happier world.
<PB N="252" REF="259"/>
Here, it is with difficulty that we can se∣lect
from the corrupted crowd a few with
whom we wish to associate in strict union.
There, are assembled all the wise, the holy,
and the just who ever existed in the uni∣verse
of God; without any distress to trou∣ble
their mutual bliss, or any source of dis∣agreement
to interrupt their perpetual
harmony. Artifice and concealment are
unknown there. There, no competitors
struggle; no factions contend; no rivals
supplant each other. The voice of discord
never rises, the whisper of suspicion never
circulates, among those innocent and be∣nevolent
spirits Each, happy in himself,
participates in the happiness of all the rest;
and by reciprocal communications of love
and friendship, at once receives from, and
adds to the sum of general felicity. Re∣new
the memory of the most affectionate
friends with whom you were blest in any
period of your life. Divest them of all
those infirmities which adhere to the hu∣man
character. Recal the most pleasing
and tender moments which you ever en∣joyed
<PB N="253" REF="260"/>
in their society; and the remem∣brance
of those sensations mat assist you
in conceiving that felicity which is pos∣sessed
by the saints above. The happiness
of <HI>brethren dwelling together in unity,</HI> is,
with great justice and beauty, compared by
the Psalmist to such things as are most re∣freshing
to the heart of man; to the fra∣grancy
of the richest odours, and to the
reviving influence of soft aetherial dews.
<HI>It is like the precious ointment poured on the
head of Aaron; and like the dew of Hermon,
even the dew that descendeth on the moun∣tains
of Zion, where the Lord commandeth
the blessing, even life for evermore</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. cxxxiii. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Besides the felicity which springs from per∣fect
love, there are two circumstances which
particularly enhance the blessedness of that
<HI>multitude who stand before the throne;</HI> these
are, access to the most exalted society, and
renewal of the most tender connexions.
The former is pointed out in the Scripture
by <HI>joining the innumerable company of angels,
and the general assembly and church of the
<PB N="254" REF="261"/>
first-born; by sitting down with Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
heaven</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 22,. 23. Matth. viii. 11.</NOTE>; a promise which opens the su∣blimest
prospects to the human mind. It
allows good men to entertain the hope, that,
separated from all the dregs of the human
mass, from that mixed and polluted crowd
in midst of which they now dwell, they
shall be permitted to mingle with prophets,
patriarchs and apostles, with legislators and
heroes, with all those great and illustrious
spirits, who have shone in former ages as
the servants of God, or the benefactors of
men; whose deeds we are accustome to
celebrate; whose steps we now follow at a
distance; and whose names we pronounce
with veneration.</P>
<P>United to this high assembly, the bless∣ed
at the same time renew those ancient
connexions with virtuous friends which had
been dissolved by death. The prospect to
this awakens in the heart the most pleasing
and tender sentiment which perhaps can fill
it, in this mortal state. For of all the sor∣rows
<PB N="255" REF="262"/>
rows which we are here doomed to endure,
none is so bitter as that occasioned by the
fatal stroke which separates us, in appear∣ance,
for ever, from those to whom either
nature or friendship had intimately joined
our hearts. Memory, from time to time,
renews the anguish; opens the wound
which seemed once to have been closed;
and by recalling joys that are past and gone,
touches every spring of painful sensibility.
In these agonizing moments, how relieving
the thought, that the separation is only
temporary, not eternal; that there is a time
to come of re-union with those with whom
our happiest days were spent; whose joys
and sorrows once were ours; and from
whom, after we shall have landed on the
peaceful shore where they dwell, no revo∣lutions
of nature shall ever be able to part
us more!—Such is the society of the blessed
above. Of such are the multitude composed
who <HI>stand before the throne.</HI> Let us now
observe,</P>
<P>II. THAT this is not only a blessed but
a numerous society. It is called a <HI>mul∣titude,
<PB N="256" REF="263"/>
a great multitude, a great multitude
which no man could number.</HI> These expres∣sions
convey the most enlarged views of the
kingdom of glory. Dismay not yourselves
with the apprehension of heaven being a
confined and almost inaccessible region, into
which it is barely possible for a small hand∣ful
to gain admission, after making their
escape from the general wreck of the human
race. <HI>In my Father's house,</HI> said our Sa∣viour,
<HI>there are many mansions.</HI> That <HI>city
of the living God</HI> towards which you profess
to bend your course, is prepared for the
reception of citizens innumerable. It
already abounds with inhabitants; and
more and more shall be added to it, until
the end of time. Whatever difficulties
there are in the way which leads to it, they
have been often surmounted. The path,
though narrow, is neither impassable, nor
untrodden. Though the gate stands not
so wide as that which opens into hell, yet
through the narrow gate multitudes have
entered, and been crowned.</P>
<P>It is much to be lamented that among all
denominations of Christians, the unchari∣table
<PB N="257" REF="264"/>
spirit has prevailed of unwarrantably
circumscribing the terms of divine grace
within a narrow circle of their own draw∣ing.
The one half of the Christian world
has often doomed the other, without mercy,
to eternal perdition. Without the pale of
that church to which each sect belongs, they
seem to hold it impossible for salvation to be
attained. But is this the genuine spirit of
the Gospel? Can a Christian believe the
effects of the sufferings of Christ, to be no
greater than these? For this did the Son
of God descend from the highest heavens,
and pour out his soul unto the death, that
only a few who adopt the same modes of
expression, and join in the same forms of
worship with us, might be brought to the
kingdom of heaven? Is this all <HI>the deli∣verance
he has wrought upon the earth? He
was with child; he was in pain;</HI> and shall
he not <HI>see of the travail of his soul, and be
satisfied?</HI> Surely, the Scripture has given
us full ground to conclude that the trophies
of our Redeemer's grace shall correspond to
the greatness of his power. <HI>The captain of
<PB N="258" REF="265"/>
our salvation shall bring many sons with
himself to glory. The pleasure of the Lord
shall prosper in his hand. He shall see his
seed: He shall justify many. Men shall be
blessed in him, and all nations shall call him
blessed.</HI> For our farther encouragement,
let us observe,</P>
<P>III. THAT the heavenly society is repre∣sented
in the text, as gathered out of all the
varieties of the human race. This is inti∣mated
by the remarkable expressions of <HI>a
multitude which no man could number, of all
nations and kindreds and people and tongues;</HI>
as if designed on purpose to correct our
narrow notions of the extent, and power of
divine grace. They whom distant seas and
regions now divide, whose languages and
manners are at present strange to one an∣other,
shall then mingle in the same assem∣bly.
No situation is so remote, and no
station so unfavourable as to preclude access
to the heavenly felicity. A road is opened
by the divine spirit to those blissful habita∣tions,
from all corners of the earth, and
<PB N="259" REF="266"/>
from all conditions of human life; from
the peopled city, and from the solitary de∣sert;
from the cottages of the poor, and
from the palaces of kings; from the dwell∣ings
of ignorance and simplicity, and from
the regions of science and improvement.
<HI>They shall come,</HI> says our blessed Lord him∣self,
<HI>from the east and from the west, from
the north and from the south, and sit down in
the kingdom o God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such discoveries serve both to enlarge our
conceptions of the extent of divine good∣ness,
and to remove those fears which are
ready to arise from particular situations in
life. Were you permitted to draw aside the
veil, and to view that diversified assembly
of the blessed who surround the throne, you
would behold among them numbers who
have overcome the same difficulties which
encounter you, and which you dread as
insuperable. You would behold there, the
uninstructed, with whom an upright inten∣tion
supplied the place of knowledge; the
<PB N="260" REF="267"/>
feeble, whom divine grace had strength∣ened;
and the misled, whom it had brought
back into the right path. You would be∣hold
the young who had surmounted the
allurements of youthful pleasure, and the
old who had born the distresses of age with
undecayed constancy; many whom want
could not tempt to dishonesty; many whom
riches did not seduce into pride or impiety;
many who in the most difficult and ensnar∣ing
circumstances, in the midst of camps
and armies and corrupted courts, had pre∣served
unsullied integrity. In a word,
<HI>from all kindreds and people,</HI> that is, from
all ranks of life, and all tribes of men, even
from among <HI>publicans and sinners,</HI> you
would behold those whom divine assistance
had conducted to future glory.—And is
not the same assistance, in its full extent,
offered also to us? Encompassed, while
we run the Christian race with this <HI>cloud of
witnesses</HI> who have finished their course
with success; animated, while we <HI>fight the
good fight,</HI> with the shouts of those who
have overcome and are crowned, shall de∣spair
<PB N="261" REF="268"/>
enervate or deject our minds? From
the happy multitude above, there issues a
voice which ought to sound perpetually in
the ear of faith, <HI>Be ye faithful unto the
death, and ye shall receive the crown of life;
Be strong in the Lord and in the power of
his might; Be followers of us who through
faith and patience are now inheriting the
promises.</HI> Consider,</P>
<P>IV. THE description given in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext
of the happiness and glory of the heavenly
society. They were beheld by the apostle
<HI>standing before the throne, and before the
lamb, cloathed with white robes and palms
in their hands.</HI> All that these <HI>palms and
white robes</HI> import, it is not given us now to
understand. We know that among all na∣tions
they have been used as ensigns of joy
and victory; and are undoubtedly employed
here to represent that distinguished felicity
and honour, to which human nature shall be
then advanced. But we must be endowed
with the faculties of the blessed, in order to
comprehend their employments and plea∣sures;
<PB N="262" REF="269"/>
and therefore on this part of the
subject I shall not attempt to enlarge. The
silence of humble and respectful hope, be∣ter
becomes us that the indulgence of those
excursions of fancy, which degrade the sub∣ject
they endeavour to exalt.</P>
<P>One circumstance only cannot fail to at∣tract
particular attention; that the blessed
are here described as <HI>standing before the
throne and before the lamb;</HI> that is, enjoy∣ing
the immediate presence of the great
Creator, and of the merciful Redeemer of
the world. The unhappy distance at which
we are now removed from God, is the
source of all our woes. Those territories
which we inhabit, are not His abode. They
are regions of exile. They are the dwell∣ings
of a fallen race; and are condemned
to be invested with clouds and darkness.
Here, God standeth afar off. In vain we
often pursue his presence through his works,
his ways, and his religious institutions. He
is said to be <HI>a God that hideth himself. He
dwelleth,</HI> as to us, <HI>in the secret place of
thunder. He holdeth back the face of his
<PB N="263" REF="270"/>
throne, and spreadeth a thick cloud upon it.</HI>
The manifestation of his presence shall be
the signal for the renovation of all things.
When that <HI>Sun of righteousness</HI> breaks forth
from the cloud which now conceals him,
sorrow and sin, and every evil thing shall
fly away before the brightness of his face.
For neither guilt nor misery can remain
where God dwells. As the rising of the
sun transforms at once the face of nature,
and converts the whole extent of space
over which his beams are spread, into a
region of light, so shall the divine presence,
as soon as it is revealed, diffuse universal
bliss over all who behold it. It imports
<HI>fullness of joy, and pleasure for evermore.</HI>
The inspired writer of this book thus de∣scribes
its effects: <HI>There shall be no more
death, neither sorrow, nor crying nor pain;
for the former things are passed away. He
that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make
all things new. They shall hunger no more,
neither thirst any more. But the Lamb
which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
them, and shall lead them unto living foun∣tains
<PB N="264" REF="271"/>
of water. God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes.</HI> But, descending from
this too sublime theme, let us</P>
<P>V. TURN our attention to a circum∣stance
in the state of future happiness, more
commensurate to our present conceptions,
which is suggested by the commentary upon
the words of the text given in the sequel of
the chapter. <HI>And one of the elders answered,
saying unto me, What are these which are ar∣rayed
in white robes; and whence came they?
And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And
he said unto me, These are they which came
out of great tribulation</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. viii. 13, 14.</NOTE>. This explanatory
circumstance may relate particularly to the
case of those primitive sufferers, who en∣dured
severe persecution in the cause of the
gospel. But, in general, it presents this na∣tural
and beautiful view of the future feli∣city
of good men, that it is their rest from
the troubles and toils of life. For, to all,
even to the happiest, human life is tribula∣tion
and conflict. No man is thoroughly
<PB N="265" REF="272"/>
at case in his condition. Pursuits succeed∣ing
to pursuits keep us in constant agitation;
while frequent returns of disppointment
break our plans, and oppress our spirits.
Fatigued by such a variety of toils, mankind
have ever looked forward to rest as their
favourite object. Throughout all their
ranks, from the highest to the lowest, they
are in perpetual chace of it; and it perpe∣tually
flies before them. It is an object
which here they are doomed always to seek,
and never to enjoy.</P>
<P>The nature and laws of our present state
admit not the gratification of this favourite
wish. for, besides the necessity of trouble
in order to fulfil the purposes of discipline
and improvement, our very happiness, such
as it is in this world, requires a circulation
of labours. Our enjoyment consists in pur∣suit,
not in attainment. Attainment is with
us, for most part, the grave of pleasure.
Had we no object to excite fresh activity,
and to impel us to new toils, human life
would quickly stagnate in melancholy indo∣lence.
At the same time, the current of all
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
our wishes tends to repose. Imaginary
forms float incessantly before our view, of
the happiness which is to be enjoyed in rest:
And from this conflict between our wishes
on the one hand, and our actual situation
on the other, arise much of the disquiet,
and much of the infelicity, of human life.
It is only in heaven that the tranquil re∣pose,
which on earth is no more than a
pleasing phantom, shall be fully realized.
There, <HI>remaineth</HI> at last <HI>a rest for the people
of God;</HI> rest from the disturbance of passion,
the vanity of pursuit, and the vexation of
disappointment; rest from all the sins and
the sorrows of this miserable world; rest,
which shall not be merely an indolent ces∣sation
from labour, but a full and satisfying
enjoyment. Good men shall <HI>rest from their
labours, and their works shall follow them.</HI>
They have <HI>come out of great tribulation.</HI>
They have fulfilled, with honour, their ap∣pointed
course of trial. They have sat
down on the seat of the conqueror; and of
past labours nothing remains but the pleasing
<PB N="267" REF="274"/>
review, and the happy fruits. There is still
to be considered,</P>
<P>VI. ONE very material circumstance,
descriptive both of the character, and of the
happiness, of those who enjoy the heavenly
bliss. Not only have <HI>they come out of great
tribulation,</HI> but, as the spirit of God adds
in explaining the text, <HI>they haver washed
their robes, and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. viii. 14.</NOTE>. Two things are here
suggested; the sanctity of the blessed, and
the means by which it is attained.</P>
<P>First, their sanctity or purity is emblema∣tically
described, by their being clothed in
<HI>robes which are washed and made white.</HI>
In order to qualify human nature for the
enjoyment of such happiness as I have en∣deavoured
to describe, it must undergo a
change so great as to receive in Scripture the
appellation of <HI>a new birth;</HI> a change to
which all the institutions of religion, and
all the operations of grace, contribute in this
life, but which is not completed till the next.
<PB N="268" REF="275"/>
In this sanctity, or regeneration, consists not
only the necessary preparation for future fe∣licity,
but, which is not so commonly at∣tended
to, consists an essentail part of that
felicity itself. For, whence arises the mi∣sery
of this present world? It is not owing
to our cloudy atmosphere, our changing sea∣sons,
and inclement skies. It is not owing
to the debility of our bodies, or to the un∣equal
distribution of the goods of fortune.
Amidst all disadvantages of this kind, a pure,
a stedfast, and enlightened mind, possessed
of exalted virtue, could enjoy itself in peace,
and smile at the impotent assaults of fortune
and the elements. It is within ourselves,
that misery has fixed its seat. Our disor∣dered
hearts, our guilty passions, our vio∣lent
prejudices and misplaced desires, are
the instruments of the torment which we
endure. These sharpen the darts which
adversity would otherwise point in vain
against us. These are the <HI>vials of wrath</HI>
which pour forth plagues on the inhabitants
of the earth; and make the dwellings of
nations become the abodes of woe. Thence
<PB N="269" REF="276"/>
discontent, and remorse, gnaw the hearts of
individuals. Thence society is torn by open
violence, or undermined by secret treachery;
and man is transformed into a savage to
man.</P>
<P>But suppose sin to be banished from the
world; suppose perfect purity and charity
to descend from heaven, and to animate
every human breast; and you would be∣hold
the present habitation of men changed
into the paradise of God. The undisturbed
enjoyment of a holy mind, and of a blissful
union with one another, would scarcely al∣low
us to feel those external evils, of which
we now so loudly complain. All nature
would assume a different appearance around
us. That golden age which was so long
the subject of the philosopher's dream, and
of the poet's song, would in fact take place.
According to the beautiful language of an∣cient
prophecy, <HI>springs would then rise in
the desert, and rivers be opened in the thirsty
land. The wilderness and the solitary place
would be glad. The wolf would dwell with
the lamb, and the leopard lie down with the
<PB N="270" REF="277"/>
kid. Judgment would dwell in the wilder∣ness,
and righteousness remain in the fruitful
field. The desert would rejoice, and blossom
as the rose.</HI>—If such, even in this world,
would be the effects of innocence and virtue
completely restored, how much greater must
they be in that <HI>new earth and those new
heavens,</HI> where rectitude of nature shall be
combined with every circumstance of ex∣ternal
felicity? It is the present imperfect
state of human virtue that hinders us from
conceiving fully the influence of righteous∣ness
upon happiness. The <HI>robes</HI> in which
the best men are now clothed, to use the
language of the text, are sullied with so
many stains, as to convey no adequate idea
of the original beauty which belongs to the
garb of righteousness. But when these
stains shall be washed away, when these
robes shall be made perfectly white and
pure, a lustre will flow from them of which
we can, as yet, form no conception.</P>
<P>But how are the robes of the blessed thus
washed? Whence is derived that spotless
purity in which they are arrayed? The
<PB N="271" REF="278"/>
Spirit of God hath answered us, <HI>from the
blood of the Lamb;</HI> leading our thoughts to
that high dispensation of mercy, to which
the saints above owe their establishment,
first in grace, and then in glory. From
that blood which was <HI>shed for the remission
of sins,</HI> flow both the atonement of human
guilt, and the regeneration of human na∣ture.
Human nature had fallen too low to
be capable of retrieving itself. It could not
regain its primitive innocence, and still less
was capable of raising itself so high in the
scale of existence as to mingle with angels.
We had neither sufficient knowledge to dis∣cover,
nor virtue to merit, nor ability to
qualify ourselves for enjoying, celestial glory.
Heaven must have been either covered from
our view by perpetual darkness, or only
beheld from afar as an inaccessible region,
if Christ had not interposed to <HI>open for us a
new and living way within the veil.</HI> The
obligations which his generous undertaking
has conferred upon the human race will tend
highly to increase the felicity of the blessed.
The sense of being distinguished by so il∣lustrious
<PB N="272" REF="279"/>
a benefactor, and the correspond∣ing
returns of gratitude and love to him,
form some of the most pleasing of those
emotions which shall continue to delight
them through all eternity.</P>
<P>FROM those views of a state of future
happiness which the text has suggested, va∣rious
instructions relating to life and prac∣tice
naturally arise. We are taught to rectify
our notions of felicity; to look for it, not
in what is external, but in what relates to
the mind and heart; in good dispositions
and a purified soul; in unity and friendship
with one another, and in the divine pre∣sence
and favour. If such things form the
principal articles of future bliss, they cannot
but be essentail to our happiness in the more
early periods of existence; and he who
seeks his chief enjoyments from an opposite
quarter, is erring widely from the path
which conducts to felicity.</P>
<P>We are farther taught whence to derive
constancy and perseverance, amidst the pre∣sent
discouragements of a virtuous life. In
<PB N="273" REF="280"/>
this world, we often behold good men de∣pressed,
and the wicked prospering around
us. Our best deeds meet with unjust re∣turns
from an ungrateful world. Sincerity
is over-reached by craft, and innocence falls
a victim to power. But let us not on such
occasions say within ourselves, <HI>that in vain
we have cleansed our hearts, and washed our
hands in innocency.</HI> Let us rest on the as∣surance,
that these disorders extend not far
in the kingdom of God. They affect only
the first stage of existence. They relate to
discipline and trial, which will soon be
finished. In that permanent state which is
about to open, a new and better order of
things shall arise. When dejected with the
evils of life, let us look upward to that happy
<HI>multitude who have come out of great tribu∣lation,
and now stand before the throne.</HI>
Until the day arrive which shall join us to
that blessed assembly, let us shew ourselves
worthy of the hope that is before us, by
supporting with a constant mind the trials of
our fidelity. <HI>Be patient; stablish your hearts.
The coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="281"/>
From the prospects which the text has
afforded, we may likewise learn what the
spirit is which should regulate our life.
Sanctity of conduct, dignity of character,
elevation of affections, become those who
expect to mingle with angels, and <HI>spirits of
just men made perfect.</HI> I mean not that such
prospects should carry away our whole at∣tention
from the present world, where un∣doubtedly
lies the chief scene of human ac∣tion,
and human duty. But while we act
as inhabitants of the earth, we ought at the
same time so to remember our connection
with a better world, as not to debase our∣seves with what is mean, not to defile our∣selves
with what is impure, not to entangle
ourselves among what is ensnaring, in the
present state. Let neither its advantages
elate, nor its disappointments deject us;
but with an equal spirit, with a mind full
of immortality, let us pass through all the
changes of this mortal life.</P>
<P>Finally, let the discoveries of future hap∣piness
inspire us with suitable gratitude to
God and Christ; to the eternal Father, who
<PB N="275" REF="282"/>
originally decreed such rewards for the
righteous; and to the Son, who acts in the
high character of the dispenser of the divine
mercies, and the great restorer of the fallen
race of men. Particularly, when approach∣ing
to God in solemn acts of devotion, such
as we are this day to perform, let gratitude
be alive and ardent in our heart. The com∣memoration
of our Saviour's death is in a
high degree suited to awaken every emotion
of tenderness and love. It brings before us,
under one view, all the obligations which
we lie under to this great benefactor of man∣kind.
When just ready to suffer for our
sake, he instituted this holy sacrament, and
said, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me.</HI>—Whom,
O blessed Jesus! shall we ever remember, if
we are capable of forgetting Thee? Thee,
to whom we owe the forgiveness of sin, and
the restoration of divine favour; our victory
over death, and our hope of life eternal!
Thou hast enlarged our views beyond these
territories of disorder and darkness. Thou
hast discovered to us the <HI>city of the living
God.</HI> Thou settest open the gates of that
<PB N="276" REF="283"/>
<HI>new Jerusalem;</HI> and leadest us into the <HI>path
of life.</HI> Thou from age to age gatherest <HI>out
of every nation, and kindred, and people, that
multitude which stand before the throne.</HI> Thou
bringest them <HI>out of great tribulation.</HI> Thine
are the <HI>white robes</HI> with which they are in∣vested;
thine, <HI>the palms</HI> which they bear;
and by Thee they are placed under the light
of the divine countenance for ever.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>RELIGION and Government are the
two great foundations of order and
comfort among mankind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. X.</NOTE> Government re∣strins
the outrages and crimes which would
be subversive of society, secures the pro∣perty,
and defends the lives of its subjects.
But the defect of government is, that hu∣man
laws can extend no farther than to the
actions of men. Though they protect us
from external violence, they leave us open
on different sides to be wounded. By the
vices which prevail in society, our tran∣quillity
<PB N="278" REF="285"/>
may be disturbed, and our lives in
various ways embittered, while government
can give us no redress. Religion supplies
the insufficiency of law, by striking at the
root of those disorders which occasion so
much misery in the world. Its professed
scope is to regulate, not actions alone, but
the temper and inclinations. By this means
it ascends to the sources of conduct; and
very ineffectual would the wisest system of
legislation prove for the happiness of man∣kind,
if it did not derive aid from religion,
in softening the dispositions of men, and
checking many of those evil passions to which
the influence of law cannot possibly reach.</P>
<P>We are led to this reflection by the de∣scription
given in the context of charity,
that great principle in the Christian system.
The Apostle places it in a variety of lights,
and under each of them, explains its opera∣tion
by its internal effects; not by the actions
to which it gives rise, but by the dispositions
which it produces in the heart. He justly
supposes, that if the temper be duly regu∣lated,
propriety of action will follow, and
<PB N="279" REF="286"/>
good order take place in external behaviour.
Of those characters of charity I have chosen
one for the subject of this discourse, which
leads to the consideration of a virtue highly
important to us, both as Christians, and as
members of society. I shall endeavour, first,
to explain the temper here pointed out, by
shewing what this description of charity im∣ports,
that <HI>it thinketh no evil;</HI> and then to
recommend such a disposition, and to dis∣play
the bad effects of an opposite turn of
mind.</P>
<P>I. LET us consider what this description
of charity imports. You will easily perceive
that the expression in the text is not to be
understood in a sense altogether unlimited;
as if there were no occasion on which we
are to think unfavourably of others. To
view all the actions of men with the same
degree of complacency, would be contrary
both to common understanding, and to
many express precepts of religion. In a
word, where so much depravity abounds,
were we to think and speak equally well of
<PB N="280" REF="287"/>
all, we must either be insensible of the dis∣tinction
between right and wrong, or be
indifferent to that distinction when we per∣ceived
it. Religion renders it our duty to
<HI>abhor that which is evil;</HI> and, on many oc∣casions,
to express our indignation openly
against it. But the Apostle, with great pro∣priety,
describes the temper which he is re∣commending
in such strong an general
terms<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as might guard us against that ex∣treme
to which we are naturally most prone,
of rash and unjust suspicion. The virtue
which he means to inculcate is that which
is known by the name of Candour; a vir∣tue,
which, as soon as it is mentioned,
every one will acknowledge to be essential
to the character of a worthy man; a virtue
which we seldom fail of ascribing to any
person whom we seek to recommend to the
esteem of others; but which, I am afraid,
when we examine our own conduct in a
religious view. religious view, is seldom the subject of in∣quiry.</P>
<P>It is necessary to observe, that true can∣dour
is altogether different from that guard∣ed,
<PB N="281" REF="288"/>
inoffensive language, and that studied
openness of behaviour, which we so fre∣quently
meet with among men of the world.
Smiling, very often, is the aspect, and
smooth are the words of those who in∣wardly
are the most ready to think evil of
others. That candour which is a Christian
virtue consists, not in fairness of speech,
but in fairness of heart. It may want the
blandishment of external courtesy, but sup∣plies
its place with humane and generous
liberality of sentiment. Its manners are
unaffected, and its professions cordial.
Exempt, on one hand, from the dark jea∣lousy
of a suspicious mind; it is no less
removed, on the other, from that easy cre∣dulity
which is imposed on by every spe∣cious
pretence. It is perfectly consistent
with extensive knowledge of the world,
and with due attention to our own safety.
In that various intercourse which we are
obliged to carry on with persons of every
different character, suspicion, to a certain
degree, is a necessary guard. It is only
when it exceeds the bounds of prudent cau∣tion,
<PB N="282" REF="289"/>
that it degenerates into vice. There is
a proper mean between undistinguishing
credulity, and universal jealousy, which a
sound understanding discerns, and which
the man of candour studies to preserve.</P>
<P>He makes allowance for the mixture of
evil with good, which is to be found in every
human character. He expects none to be
faultless; and he is unwilling to believe that
there is any without some commendable
quality. In the midst of many defects, he
can discover a virtue. In the midst of per∣sonal
resentment, he can be just to the me∣rit
of an enemy. He never lends an open
ear to those defamatory reports and dark
suggestions, which, among the tribes of
the censorious, circulate with so much ra∣pidity,
and meet with such ready acceptance.
He is not hasty to judge; and he requires
full evidence before he will condemn. As
long as an action can be ascribed to different
motives, he holds it as no mark of sagacity
to impute it always to the worst. Where
there is just ground for doubt, he keeps his
judgment undecided; and during the pe∣riod
<PB N="283" REF="290"/>
of suspence, leans to the most chari∣table
construction which an action can bear.
When he must condemn, he condemns with
regret; and without those aggravations
which the severity of others adds to the
crime. He listens calmly to the apology
of the offender, and readily admits every
extenuating circumstance which equity can
suggest. How much soever he may blame
the principles of any sect or party, he ne∣ver
confounds under one general censure
all who belong to that party or sect. He
charges them not with such consequences
of their tenets, as they refuse and disavow.
From one wrong opinion, he does not in∣fer
the subversion of all sound principles;
nor from one bad action, conclude that all
regard to conscience is overthrown. When
<HI>he beholds the mote in his brother's eye,</HI> he
remembers <HI>the beam in his own.</HI> He com∣miserates
human frailty; and judges of
others according to the principles by which
he would think it reasonable that they
should judge of him. In a word, he views
men and actions in the clear sunshine of
<PB N="284" REF="291"/>
charity and good-nature; and not in that
dark and sullen shade which jealousy and
party spirit throw over all characters.—
Such being in general the spirit of that
charity which <HI>thinketh no evil,</HI> I proceed,</P>
<P>II. To recommend, by various argu∣ments,
this important branch of Christian
virtue.</P>
<P>Let us begin with observing what a ne∣cessary
requisite it is to the proper discharge
of all the social duties. I need not spend
time in showing that those hold a very
high rank in the Christian system. The
encomium which the Apostle in this chap∣ter
bestows upon charity, is alone sufficient
to prove it. He places this grace at the
head of all the gifts, and endowments, which
can be possessed by man; and assures us
that <HI>though we had all faith so that we
could remove mountains,</HI> yet if we be desti∣stute
of charity, <HI>it will profit us nothing.</HI>
Accordingly, <HI>love, gentleness, meekness and
long suffering,</HI> are enumerated as distin∣guishing
<HI>fruits of the spirit</HI> of Christ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galat. v 22, 23.</NOTE> But
<PB N="285" REF="292"/>
it is impossible for such virtues as these to
find place in a breast, where the propensity
to think evil of others is predominant.
Charitable and candid thoughts of men are
the necessary introduction to all good-will
and kindness. They form, if we may
speak so, the only climate in which love
can grow up, and flourish. A suspicious
temper checks in the bud every kind affec∣tion.
It hardens the heart, ad estranges
man from man. What friendship or gra∣titude
can you expect form him, who views
all your conduct with distrustful eyes, and
ascribes every benefit you confer to artifice
and stratagem? The utmost which you
can hope from one of this character, is
justice in his dealings; nor even that can
you be assured of; as the suspicions to
which he is a prey will afford him frequent
pretexts for departing from truth, and for
defending himself with the same arms which
he conceives to be employed against him.
Unhappy will they be who are joined with
him by any close connexion; exposed to
every malignant suspicion which arises in
<PB N="286" REF="293"/>
his own mind, and to every unjust sugge∣stion
which the malice of other may insi∣nuate
against them. That store of poison
which is collected within him frequently
throws out its venom on all who are within
its reach. As a companion, he will be se∣vere
and satirical; as a friend, captious and
dangerous; in him domestic sphere, harsh,
jealous and irascible; in his civil capacity,
seditious and turboulent, prone to impute
the conduct of his superiours to improper
motives, and upon loose information to
condemn their conduct.</P>
<P>The contrary of all this may be expected
from a candid temper. Whatever is ami∣able
in manners, or useful in society, na∣trually
and easily ingrafts itself upon it.
Gentleness, humanity and compassion flow
from it, as their native spring. Open and
cheerful in itself, it diffuses cheerfulness and
good-humour over all who are under its
influence. It is the chief ground of mu∣tual
confidence and union among men.
It prevents those animosities from arising
which are the offspring of groundless pre∣judice;
<PB N="287" REF="294"/>
or, by its bening interposition, al∣lays
them when arisen. In the magistrate,
it tempers justice with lenity. Among
subjects it promotes good order and sub∣mission.
It connects humanity with piety.
For he who is not given to think evil of
his fellow-creatures, will not be ready to
censure the dispensations of his Creator.
Whereas the same turn of mind which ren∣ders
one jealous and unjust towards men,
will incline him to be querulous and impi∣ous
towards God.</P>
<P>In the second place, as a suspicious, un∣charitable
spirit is inconsistent with all
social virtue and happiness, so, in itself,
it is unreasonable and unjust. In order to
form sound opinions concerning characters
and actions, two things are especially re∣quisite,
information and impartiality. But
such as are most forward to decide unfa∣vourably,
are commonly destitute of both.
Instead of possessing, or even requiring, full
information, the grounds on which they
proceed are frequently the most slight and
<PB N="288" REF="295"/>
frivolous. A tale, perhaps, which the idle
have invented, the inquisitive have listened
to, and the credulous have propagated; or
a real incident which rumour, in carrying
it along, has exaggerated and disguised,
supplies them with materials of confident
assertion, and decisive judgment. From an
action they presently look into the heart,
and infer the motive. This supposed mo∣tive,
they conclude to be the ruling prin∣ciple;
and pronounce at once concerning
the whole character.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more contrary both to
equity and to sound reason, than such pre∣cipitate
judgments. Any man who attends
to what passes within himself, may easily
discern what a complicated system the hu∣man
character is, and what a variety of
circumstances must be taken into the ac∣count,
in order to estimate it truly. No
single instance of conduct whatever, is suf∣ficient
to determine it. As from one wor∣thy
action, it were credulity, not charity,
to conclude a person to be free from all
vice; so from one which is censurable, it
<PB N="289" REF="296"/>
is perfectly unjust to infer that the author
of it is without conscience, and without me∣rit.
Did you know all the attending cir∣cumstances,
it might appear in an excusable
light; nay, perhaps, under a commendable
form. The motives of the actor may have
been entirely different from those which
you ascribe to him; and where you suppose
him impelled by bad design, he may have
been prompted by conscience and mistaken
principle. Admitting the action to have
been in every view criminal, he may have
been hurried into it through inadvertency
and surprise. He may have sincerely re∣pented;
and the virtuous principle may
have now regained its full vigour. Perhaps
this was the corner of frailty; the quarter
on which he lay open to the incursions of
temptation; while the other avenues of his
heart were firmly guarded by conscience.</P>
<P>No error is more palpable than to look
for uniformity from human nature; though
it is commonly on this supposition that our
general conclusions concerning character are
formed. Mankind are consistent neither in
<PB N="290" REF="297"/>
good, nor in evil. In the present state of
frailty, all is mixed and blended. The strongest
contrarieties of piety and hypo∣crisy,
of generosity and avarice, of truth
and duplicity, often meet in one character.
The purest human virtue is consistent with
some vice; and in the midst of much vice
and disorder, amiable, nay respectable, qua∣lities
may be found. There are few cases
in which we have ground to conclude that
all goodness is lost. At the bottom of the
character there may lie some sparks of piety
and virtue, suppressed, but not extinguish∣ed;
which kept alive by the breath of hea∣ven,
and gathering strength in secret from
reflection, may, on the first favourable
opening which is afforded them, be ready
to break forth with splendour and force.—
Placed, then, in a situation of so much un∣certainty
and darkness, where our know∣ledge
of the heart and characters of men is
so limited, and our judgments concerning
them are so apt to err, what a continual
call do we receive either to suspend our
judgment, or to give it on the favourable
<PB N="291" REF="298"/>
side? especially when we consider that, as
through imperfect information we are un∣qualified
for deciding soundly, so through
want of impartiality we are often tempted
to decide wrong. How much this enforces
the argument for candour, will appear by
considering,</P>
<P>IN the third place, what the sources are
of those severe and uncharitable opinions
which we are so ready to form. Were the
mind altogether free from prepossession and
bias, it might avail itself to more advan∣tage
of the scanty knowledge which it pos∣esses.
But this is so far from being the
case, that on every side we are encumbered
with prejudices, and warped by passions,
which exert their influence in nothing more
than in leading us to think evil of others.
At all times we are justly said to <HI>see through
a glass, darkly;</HI> but passion and prejudice,
looking through a glass which distorts the
form of the objects, make us also see falsely.</P>
<P>It is one of the misfortunes of our present
situation, that some of the good dispositions
<PB N="292" REF="299"/>
of human nature are apt to betray us into
frailties and vices. Thus, it often happens
that the laudable attachment which we con∣tract
for the country, or the church, to
which we belong, or for some political de∣nomination
under which we class ourselve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
both confines our affections within too nar∣row
a sphere, and gives rise to violent
prejudices against such as come under an
opposite description. Not contented with
being in the right ourselves, we must find
all others in the wrong. We claim an ex∣clusive
possession of goodness and wisdom;
and from approving warmly of those who
join us, we proceed to condemn, with much
acrimony, not the principles only, but the
characters of those from whom we differ.
Hence persons of well-disposed minds are
too often, through the strength of partial
good affection, involved in the crime of
uncharitable judgment. They rashly extend
to every individual the severe opinion
which they have unwarrantably conceived
of the whole body.—This man is of a party
whose principles we reckon slavish; and
<PB N="293" REF="300"/>
therefore his whole sentiments are corrupted.
That man belongs to a religious fee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which
we are accust<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med to deem bigetted; and
therefore he is incapable of any generous
or liberal thought. Another is connected
with sect, which we have been taught to
account relaxed; and therefore he can have
no sanctity.—Are these the judgments of
candour and charity? Is true piety or
virtue so very limited in its nature, as to be
confined to such alone as see every thing
with our eyes, and follow exactly the train
of our ideas? Was there ever any great
community so corrupt as not to include
within it individuals of real worth?</P>
<P>Besides prepossessions of this nature, which
sometimes mislead the honest mind, there
are other, and much more culpable causes
of uncharitable judgment. Pride is hurt
and wounded by every excellence in which
it can claim no share; and from eagerness
to discover a blemish, rests upon the slight∣est
appearance of one, as a satisfying proof.
When rivalry and competition concur with
pride, our desire to espy defects increases,
<PB N="294" REF="301"/>
and, by consequence, the grounds of censure
multiply. Where no opposition of interests
takes place, envy has too much influence
in warping the judgment of many. Even
when none of these causes operate, the in∣ward
consciousness of depravity is sufficient
to fill the mind with evil thoughts of others.
Whence should a man so readily draw his
opinions of men as from that character with
which he is best acquainted because it is
his own? A person of low and base mind
naturally imputes to others the sentiments
which he finds congenial to himself; and is
incredulous of every excellency which to
him is totally unknown. He enjoys, be∣sides,
consolation in the thought that others
are no better than himself; that his weak∣nesses
and crimes are those of all men; and
that such as appear most distinguished for
virtue possess no real superiority, except
greater dexterity in concealing their vices.
Soothing themselves with this doctrine in
secret, too many foster and strengthen the
bad opinion which they entertain of all
mankind. Rarely, if ever, have you ground
<PB N="295" REF="302"/>
to think well of that man's heart who is
on every occasion given to think the worst
of others. Let us observe,</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, that suitable to the
sources whence a jealous and suspicious tem∣per
proceeds, are the effects which it pro∣duces
in the world, the crimes and mischiefs
with which if fills society. It possesses this
unhappy distinction beyond the other fail∣ings
of the huan heart, that while it im∣pels
men to violent deeds, it justifies to their
own apprehension the excesses which they
commit. Amidst the uproar of other bad
passions, conscience acts as a restraining
power. As soon as the tumult subsides, re∣morse
exerts its influence, and renders the
sinner sensible of the evil which he has done.
But the uncharitable man is unfortunately
set loose from any such check or controul.
Through the infatuation of prejudice, his
judgment is perverted; conscience is misled;
<HI>the light within him is turned into darkness.</HI>
Viewing the objects of his displeasure as evil
men, he thinks himself entitled to give that
<PB N="296" REF="303"/>
displeasure full vent; and in committing
the most inhuman actions, may sometimes
imagine that he is doing good service to
God.</P>
<P>The first fruits of an evil-thinking spirit
are calumny and distraction, by which so∣ciety
is so often embroiled, and men are set
at variance with one another. But did it pro∣ceed
no farther than censorious speech, the
mischief would be less. Much greater and
more serious evils frequently ensue. What
direful effects, for instance, have often flow∣ed
from rash and ill-sounded jealousy in
private life? No sooner has one allowed
that daemon to take possession of his mind,
than it perverts his understanding, and taints
all his faculties. Haunting him by night
and by day, bringing perpetually before
him the odious and disquieting forms which
it has raised up, it blackens every appear∣ance
to his view; gives to trifles which
are in themselves light as air, the weight of
full confirmation; till what was at first a
dabious surmise or a slight displeasure, rises
at length into full belief and implacable
<PB N="297" REF="304"/>
fury. Hence, families torn with the most
violent convulsions; the husband armed
against the wise, the father against the son,
the friend against the friend; the plan of
treachery and assassination contrived, and
the dagger plunged into the bosom of the
innocent.—In public life, how often have
kingdom; been shaken with all the violence
of war and rebellion, from the unjust sus∣picions
which subjects had conceived of
their rulers; or the rash jealousy which
princes had entertained of their people?—
But it is in religious dissensions chiefly, that
the mischievous power of uncharitable pre∣judice
has displayed its full atrocity. Re∣ligion
is always found to heighten every
passion on which it acts, and to render
every contest into which it enters, uncom∣monly
ardent; because the objects which it
presents are of such a nature as strongly to
seize and engage the human mind. When
zeal for their own principles has prompted
men to view those of a different persuasion
in the odious lights which bigotry suggests,
every sentiment of humanity has too often
<PB N="298" REF="305"/>
been extinguished. The mild influence of
that religion which breathes nothing but
gentleness, has proved too feeble to restrain
the violent and bloody hand of persecution;
and the uncharitable spirit, raging among
contending parties, has filled the world with
such calamities and crimes as have brought
disgrace on the Christian name.</P>
<P>Let us attend particularly to one awful
instance of the guilt which men may con∣tract,
and of the ruin which they may bring
upon themselves, through the want of fair∣ness
and candour. The nation of the Jews
were always noted for a narrow and un∣charitable
spirit. When John the Baptist,
and our blessed Lord, appeared among them,
because the former was austere in his tem∣per
and retired in his life, they pronounced
of him that he had an evil spirit: And be∣cause
the latter was open and sociable in his
manners, they held him to be destitute of
that sanctity which became a prophet. Their
prejudice against our Lord took its first rise
from a most frivolous and contemptible cause.
<HI>Is not this the son of the carpenter? Can any
<PB N="299" REF="306"/>
good thing come out of Nazareth?</HI> When his
miracles repelled this reproach, and suffi∣ciently
proved the eminence of his character,
still they fostered their prejudices by this
most futile reasoning, <HI>Have any of the rulers
believed on him?</HI> Obstinate in their attach∣ment
to a temporal Messiah, and continuing
to view all our Saviour's conduct with an
evil eye, when he conversed with bad men
in order to reclaim them, they treated him
as a <HI>companion of publicans and sinners.</HI> Be∣cause
he disallowed their groundless tradi∣tions,
they held him to be a breaker of the
Sabbath, and a contemner of religion. Be∣cause
he prophesied the destruction of their
temple, they accused him of being an enemy
to his own nation. Till at last, through
their perpetual misconstruction of his ac∣tions,
their passions became so inflamed as
to make them cry out with one voice, <HI>Away
with this man to the death and give us Ba∣rabbas
the robber.</HI>—Viewing in this dread∣ful
event the consequences of want of can∣dour,
let every man trouble to think evil
rashly of his brother. No one can tell how
<PB N="300" REF="307"/>
far uncharitable prejudice, may carry him
in guilt, if he allow, them to harbour and
gather strength within his breast. The
cloud which <HI>rose from the sea, no bigger than
a man's hand,</HI> may soon swell and spread, till
it cover the whole horizon, and discharge
with most destructive violence the gathered
storm.</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, as a suspicious spirit
is the source of so many crimes and cala∣mities
in the world, so it is the spring of
certain misery to the person who indulges
it. His friends will be few; and small will
be his comfort in those whom he possesses.
Believing others to be his enemies, he will
of course make them such. Let his caution
be ever so great, the asperity of his thoughts
will often break out in his behaviour; and
in return for suspecting and hating, he will
incur suspicion and hatred. Besides the ex∣ternal
evils which he draws upon himself,
arising from alienated friendship, broken
confidence, and open enmity; the suspicious
temper itself is one of the worst evils which
<PB N="301" REF="308"/>
any man can sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fer. If <HI>in all f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar there be
torment,</HI> how mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irable must be his state who,
by living in perpetual jealousy, lives in per∣petual
dread? Looking upon himself to be
surrounded with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies, enemies, and design∣ing
men, he is a stranger to reliance and
trust. He knows not to whom to open
himself. He dresses his countenance in
forced smiles while his heart throbs within
from apprehensions of secret treachery.
Hence fretfulness and ill-humour, disgust
at the world, and all the painful sensations
of an irritated and embittered mind.</P>
<P>So numerous and great are the evils arising
from a suspicious disposition, that of the two
extremes it is more eligible to expose our∣selves
to occasional disadvantage fro think∣ing
too well of others, than to suffer con∣tinual
misery by thinking always ill of them.
It is better to be sometimes imposed upon,
than never to trust. Safety is purchased at
too dear a rate, when, in order to secure it,
we are obliged to be always clad in armour,
and to live in perpetual hostility with our
fellows. This is, for the sake of living, to
<PB N="302" REF="309"/>
deprive ourselves of the comfort of life.
The man of candour enjoys his situation,
whatever it is, with cheerfulness and peace.
Prudence directs his intercourse with the
world; but no black suspicions haunt his
hours of rest. Accustomed to view the cha∣racters
of his neighbours in the most fa∣vourable
light, he is like one who dwells
amidst those beautiful scenes of nature, on
which the eye rests with pleasure. Whereas
the suspicious man, having his imagination
filled with all the shocking forms of human
falsehood, deceit, and treachery, resembles
the traveller in the wilderness, who discerns
no objects around him but what are either
dreary or terrible; caverns that open ser∣pents
that hiss, and beasts of prey that howl.
Hence in him are verified those descriptions
which the Spirit of God has given us of
the misery of the wicked. <HI>They shall have
no peace. They shall be like the troubled sea
when it cannot rest. The Lord shall give
them a trembling heart, and failing of eyes,
and sorrow of mind: And they shall fear day
and night, and have none assurance of heart.</HI>
I add,
<PB N="303" REF="310"/>
IN the sixth and last place, that there is
nothing which exposes men in a more
marked and direct manner to the displea∣sure
of the Almighty, than a malignant and
censorious spirit. I insist not now on the
general denunciations of divine wrath against
malice and hatred. Let us only consider
under what particular description the Spirit
of God brings this crime of uncharitable
judgment. It is declared to be an impious
invasion of the prerogative of God, to whom
alone it belongs to search all hearts, and to
determine concerning all characters. This
privilege He often appropriates expressly to
himself, on purpose to restrain the rashness
of censure among men; requiring us to
leave the judging of others to Him, and to
attend, each of us, to our own business and
duty. <HI>Who art thou that judgest another man's
servant? To his own master, he standeth or
falleth. Judge nothing before the time; until
the Lord come, who shall make manifest the
counsels of the heart</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 4. 1 Corinth. iv. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It deserves our most serious attention, that,
in several passages of Scripture, the great
<PB N="304" REF="311"/>
Judge of the world is represented, at the
day of final retribution, as proceeding upon
this principle, of redering to men according
to the manner in which they have acted
towards their brethren. <HI>With the merciful,
thou wilt show thyself merciful; and with
the froward, thou wilt show thyself froward.
With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be
judged; and with what measure ye mete, it
shall be measured to you again</HI><NOTE N="dagger;" PLACE="foot">Psalm xviii. 25, 26. Matth. vii. z.</NOTE>. It is im∣possible
to form an argument of more force
than this, to restrain all severity of judgment
among such as look forward to the tribunal
of God. The argument extends not in∣deed
so far, as to represent our acceptance
with the Deity as entirely suspended upon
the candour which we show in forming our
sentiments of others. We know that other
graces besides this are requisite in order to
fit us for heaven; and that without piety
towards God, and faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ, all our charity to men will be found
defective and vain. But this we know
also, that in the heart which is destitute of
<PB N="305" REF="312"/>
fairness and candour, the Spirit of God
certainly dwells not; and that whatever
appearances of religion the uncharitable man
may assume, on him the Sovereign of the
universe looks with no favour.—Thou
who art a man full of frailties, who standest
in need, not merely of impartiality in thy
divine Judge, but of indulgence and mercy;
Thou who implorest daily this mercy from
him, and prayest that He would <HI>remember
thou art dust,</HI> and not be strict to <HI>mark ini∣quity
against thee;</HI> darest thou, with those
very prayers in thy mouth, proceed to judge
without candour of thy brethren, and upon
the slightest grounds to reprobate and con∣demn
them? O thou hypocrite! (for by
what other name can we call thee?) vain
are all thy pretensions to piety. Ineffectual
is every plea which thou canst from for
mercy from heaven. The precedent which
thou hast established against thyself is de∣cisive.
Thou hast dictated the sentence of
thine own condemnation.</P>
<P>ON the whole, it clearly appears that no
part of the government of temper deserves
<PB N="306" REF="313"/>
attention more, than to keep our minds pure
from uncharitable prejudices, and open to
candour and humanity in judging of others.
The worst consequences, both to ourselves
and to society, follow from the opposite
spirit. Let us beware of encouraging a habit
of suspicion, by forming too severe and harsh
opinions concerning human nature in gene∣ral.
A great proportion of infirmity and
corruption, doubtless adheres to it; yet
tempered also it is with various mixtures of
virtue and good affection. Darkened as the
divine image now is among mankind, it is
not wholly effaced. Much piety and good∣ness
may lie hidden in hearts that are un∣known
to us. Vice is glaring and loud.
The crimes of the wicked make a noise in
the world, and alarm society. True worth
is retired and modest, and requires parti∣cular
situations to bring it forth to public
notice. The prophet Elijah, in a time of
prevailing corruption, imagined that all true
religion had forsaken the land. <HI>I, even I
only,</HI> said he to the Lord, <HI>am left to serve
thee.</HI> But the Almighty, who discerned
<PB N="307" REF="314"/>
what was concealed from his imperfect view,
replied, <HI>Yet have I left me seven thousand
men in Israel who have not bowed the knee to
Baal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xix. 14. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The aged, and the unfortunate, who have
toiled through an unsuccessful life with long
experience of the falsehood and fraud of evil
men, are apt to be the most severe in the
opinions which they entertain of others.
For such, their circumstances may be al∣lowod
to form some degree of apology. But
if, in youth and prosperity, the same hard
suspicious spirit prevail; if they who are
beginning the career of life set out with all
the scruples of distrust; if, before they have
had reason to complain of the world, they
betray the diffidence of a jealous, and the
malignity of a censorious mind sad is the
presage which may thence be drawn of their
future dishonour. From such, you have
nothing to look for that shall be either en∣gaging

uncharitable judgments, let that awful de∣nunciation
frequently resound in our ears,

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>GENESIS xiv. 5. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with
yourselves that ye sold me hither; for God
did send me before you to preserve life.—
So now it was not you that sent me hither,
but God.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this generous manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XI.</NOTE> Joseph frames
an apology for the unnatural behaviour
of his brethren. He extenuates the atro∣city
of their crime, by representing the happy
effects which it had produced. He looks
beyond all second causes; and recognizes,
in the wonderful events of his life, the hand
of the Almighty.—No human character
<PB N="310" REF="317"/>
exhibited in the records of Scripture is more
remarkable, or instructive, than that of this
patriarch. He is one whom we behold
tried in all the vicissitudes of fortune; from
the condition of a slave, rising to be ruler of
the land of Egypt; and in every station
acquiring, by his virtue and wisdom, favour
with God and man. When oversseer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Potiphar's house, his fidelity was proved by
strong temptations, which he honourably
resisted. When thrown into prison by the
artifice of a false woman, his integrity and
prudence soon rendered him conspicuous,
even in that dark mansion. When called
into the presence of Pharaoh, the wise and
extensive plan which he formed for saving
the kingdom from the miseries of impend∣ing
famine, justly raised him to a high sta∣tion,
wherein his abilities were eminently
displayed in the public service. But in his
whole history there is no circumstance so
striking and interesting, as his behaviour to
his brethren who had sold him into slavery.
The moment in which he made himself
known to them, that moment at which we
<PB N="311" REF="318"/>
are now to contemplate him, was the most
critical one of his life and the most decisive
of his character. It is such as rarely occurs
in the course of human events; and is cal∣culated
to draw the highest attention of all
who are endowed with any degree of sen∣sibility
of heart. Let us consider the senti∣ment
which Joseph utters in the text under
two views, each of which is very instructive
to all Christians. I. As a discovery of his
cordial forgiveness of his brethren; and, II.
as an instance of his dutiful attention to the
Providence of God.</P>
<P>I. THE most cordial forgiveness is here
displayed. I shall not recapitulate all the
preceding history respecting Joseph and his
brethren; as it is well known by every one
who has the least acquaintance with the sa∣cred
writings. From the whole tenour of
the narration it appears that though Jo∣seph,
upon the arrival of his brethren in
Egypt, made himself strange to them, yet
from the beginning he intended to discover
himself; and studied so to conduct the dis∣covery
<PB N="312" REF="319"/>
as might render the surprise of joy
complete. For this end, by affected seve∣rity,
he took measures for bringing down
into Egypt all his father's children. They
were now arrived there; and Benjamin
among the rest, who was his younger bro∣ther
by the same mother, and was particu∣larly
beloved by Joseph. Him he threat∣ened
to detain; and seemed willing to al∣low
the rest to depart. This incident re∣newed
their distress. They all knew their
father's extreme anxiety about the safety of
Benjain, and with what difficulty he had
yielded to his undertaking this journey.
Should he be prevented from returning,
they dreaded that grief would overpower
the old man's spirits, and prove fatal to his
life. Judah, therefore, who had particu∣larly
urged the necessity of Benjamin's ac∣companying
his brothers, and had solemnly
pledged himself to their father for his safe
return, craved, upon this occasion, an au∣dience
of the governour; and gave him a
full account of the circumstances of Jacob's
family.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="320"/>
Nothing can be more interesting and pa∣thetic
than this discourse of Judah, as it is
recorded in the preceding chapter. Little
knowing to whom he spoke, he paints, in
all the colours of simple and natural elo∣quence,
the distressed situation of the aged
patriarch, hastening to the close of life;
long afflicted for the loss of a favourite son,
whom he supposed to have been torn in
pieces by a beast of prey; labouring now
under anxious concern about his youngest
son, the child of his old age, who alone
was left alive of his mother, and whom
nothing but the calamities of severe famine
could have moved a tender father to send
from home, and expose to the dangers of a
foreign land. <HI>If we bring him not back
with us, we shall bring down the grey hairs
of thy servant our father, with sorrow, to the
grave. I pray thee therefore let thy servant
abide instead of the young man, a bondman to
our lord. For how shall I go up to my fa∣ther,
and Benjamin not with me? lest I see
the evil that shall come on my father.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="321"/>
Upon this relation, Joseph could no
longer restrain himself. The tender ideas
of his father and his father's house, of his
ancient home, his country and his kindred,
of the distress of his family, and his own ex∣altation,
all rushed too strongly upon his
mind to bear any farther concealment. <HI>He
cried, cause every man to go out from me;
and be wept aloud.</HI> The tears which he
shed were not the tears of grief. They
were the burst of affection. They were the
effusions of a heart overflowing with all the
tender sensibilities of nature. Formerly he
had been moved in the same manner, when
he first saw his brethren before him. <HI>His
bowels yearned upon them; he sought for a
place where to weep. He went into his
chamber; and then washed his face, and re∣turned
to them.</HI> At that period his gene∣rous
plans were not completed. But now,
when there was no farther occasion for con∣straining
himself, he gave free vent to the
strong emotions of his heart. The first
minister to the king of Egypt was not
<PB N="315" REF="322"/>
ashamed to show, that he felt as a man, and
a brother. <HI>He wept aloud; and the Egyp∣tians,
and the house of Pharaoh heard him.</HI></P>
<P>The first words which his swelling heart
allowed him to pronounce, are the most
suitable to such an affecting situation which
were ever uttered.—<HI>I am Joseph; doth my
father yet live?</HI>—What could he, what
ought he, in that impassioned moment, to
have said more? This is the voice of na∣ture
herself, speaking her own language;
and it penetrates the heart: No pomp of
expression; no parade of kindness; but
strong affection hastening to utter what it
strongly felt. <HI>His brethren could not an∣swer
him; for they were troubled at his pre∣sence.</HI>
Their silence is as expressive of those
emotions of repentance, and shame, which,
on this amazing discovery, filled their
breasts, and stopped their utterance, as the
few words which Joseph speaks are expres∣sive
of the generous agitations which strug∣gled
for vent within him. No painter could
seize a more striking moment for displaying
the characeristical features of the human
<PB N="316" REF="323"/>
heart, than what is here presented. Never
was there a situation of more tender and
virtuous joy, on the one hand; nor, on
the other, of more overwhelming confusion
and conscious guilt. In the simp;e narra∣tion
of the sacred historian, it is set before
us with greater energy and higher effect,
than if it had been wrought up with all the
colouring of the most admired modern elo∣quence.</P>
<P>When Joseph had a little recovered him∣self
from the first transports of emotion, he
proceeds to explain his situation to his
brethren, and to show them the beneficent
purposes for which he conceived himself to
be raised by Providence into power. The
apology which he makes in the text for their
former cruelty is uncommon and remark∣able.
<HI>Now therefore be not grieved nor an∣gry
with yourselves that ye sold me hither;
for God did send me before you to preserve you
a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives
by a great deliverance. So now it was not
you that sent me hither but God; and he
hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and Lord
<PB N="317" REF="324"/>
of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the
land of Egypt.</HI> This apology was, in truth,
no satisfactory excuse for their crime. For
though the over-ruling providence of Hea∣ven
had so directed the course of events, as
to render their bad intentions subservient to
a happy issue; yet the badness of the inten∣tion
originated entirely from themselves.
The envy and jealousy which they enter∣tained
against their brother, led them to
the commission of an atrocious deed. The
deed was voluntary; the crime was all their
own; and the interposition of Providence
in making unforeseen consequences follow
from that crime, did not, could not, excul∣pate
them from guilt. It were an impious
conclusion, that because God extracts good
from our evil, we are not answerable for
the evil which we perpetrate. <HI>God cannot
be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any
man</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James i. 13.</NOTE>. But the sentiment in the text is to
be considered, as a colour which the gene∣rous
humanity of Joseph prompted him to
throw on the conduct of his brethren. He
<PB N="318" REF="325"/>
saw the confusion with which they were
overwhelmed in his presence. He diverts
their attention from the remembrance of a
crime which was now wringing their hearts
with anguish, by representing to them the
happy effects which that crime had pro∣duced.
He sets them free from all uneasi∣ness
on his account. He calls upon them
to rejoice in his prosperity and instead of
dwelling on a painful recollection of their
own conduct, to join with him in ac∣knowledging
and adoring the hand of the
Almighty.</P>
<P>How different is this amiable spirit which
Joseph discovers, from that harsh and osten∣tatious
superiority which too often accom∣panies
the pretended forgiveness of injuries,
among those who call themselves Christians!
They are ready to say that, for their part,
they pardon the wrongs which have been
done them; they wish that the persons who
have committed them may be able to for∣give
themselves; they leave them to God
and to their own conscience. By the severe
suggestion which they throw out, they
<PB N="319" REF="326"/>
discover the inward bitterness of their spi∣rit;
and artfully gratify resentment, at the
time when they profess to exercise forgive∣ness.
Whereas the great and good man
whose character we now consider, effaces
all memory of the crimes which he par∣dons.
He seeks to alleviate the remorse
of his brethren by an extenuation of their
guilt; and while he is preparing to make
their circumstances comfortable, studies at
the same time to render their minds easy
and tranquil.</P>
<P>This was not merely a transient emotion
with Joseph, owing to the first burst of af∣fection
on discovering himself to his bre∣thren.
We have a clear proof, from a re∣markable
transaction which passed many
years after this period, of his disposition
continuing the same to the end of life. It
is recorded in the last chapter of this book,
that when Jacob died, his sons began to be
seized with fear concerning the treatment
which they might receive from their bro∣ther.
The guilty are always suspicious.
Conscious of their own baseness, they are
<PB N="320" REF="327"/>
incapable of conceiving the magnanimity of
others. They saw the bond which held
the family together, now broken by their
father's death. They dreaded that the re∣sentment
of Joseph against them hand hi∣therto
been only suppressed, or concealed.
<HI>They said among themselves, peradventure he
will now hate us, and requite all the evil which
we did unto him.</HI> Under this apprehension,
they first sent a humble message to depre∣cate
his displeasure by the memory of thier
common father; and then appearing in his
presence, they fell down before his face,
professing themselves to be his servants, and
praying hi to forgive the trespass which
they had committed against him. But no
such hidden resentment as they dreaded had
ever lurked in the soul of Joseph. On the
contrary, when he beheld his brethren in
this affecting situation, bereaved of their
ancient protector, and reduced, as they
imagined, to the necessity of holding up
their hands to him for mercy, he was over∣powered
by a tide of tender emotions. <HI>Jo∣seph
wept, while his brethren spake unto him.</HI>
<PB N="321" REF="328"/>
These affectionate tears alone were sufficient
to have ensured their forgiveness. But ha∣stening
also by words to dispel their alarms,
he presently added, <HI>Fear not; for though ye
thought evil against me, God meant it unto
good. Now therefore fear ye not; I will
nourish you and your little ones. And he
comforted them; and spake kindly unto them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Genes. 1. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such was the last incident that is record∣ed
in the life of this eminent personage,
than whom you will find few more distin∣guished
by an assemblage of illustrious vir∣tues;
in the lowest adversity, patient and
faithful; in the highest prosperity, benefi∣cent
and generous; dutiful and affectionate,
as a son; kind and forgiving, as a brother;
accomplished as a statesman; wise and pro∣vident,
as a ruler of the land. In such a
character you behold human nature possess∣ing
its highest honours. The sentiments
which it inspires, tend to ennoble our minds;
and to prevent their imbibing the spirit of
those hard, interested, and self-seeking men
with whom the world abounds.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="329"/>
THE striking example of forgiveness,
which the text displays, ought frequently
to occur to our thoughts amidst the various
occasions of provocation and offence which
arise in our intercourse with the world. If
one so worthy and amiable, in the days too
of his youth and innocence, suffered such
cruel treatment from his brothers, ought
we to be surprised if, even from our nearest
relations, we meet with injustice or ingra∣titude?
Wrongs and injuries are, more or
less, the portion of all. Like Death, they
are an evil unavoidable. No station is so
high, no power so great, no character so
unblemished, as to exempt us from them.
In the world, ungrateful men, false friends,
and violent enemies abound. Every wise
man ought to prepare himself for what he
is to encounter, in passing through this
thorny region. He is not to expect that
he can <HI>gather grapes from thistles;</HI> nor to
lose the government of his mind, because,
in the midst of evil men, he is not allowed
to remain, like a sacred and inviolable per∣son,
untouched and uninjured.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="330"/>
As this view of our situation ought to
blunt the edge of passion and impatience,
so the alleviating circumstances which rea∣son
will suggest, ought to mollify resent∣ment.
Think of the various constructions
which the actions of men will bear. Con∣sider
how different the motives of him who
hath given us offence, may have been from
those which in the heat of passion we ascribe
to him; how apt all men are to be seduced
by mistaken views of interest; and how
little ground we have to complain it, upon
a supposed interfering of interests, we suffer
by others preferring their own to ours.
Remember that no opinions which you
form under the power of resentment can
be depended upon as just; and that every
one loads the intentions of his enemy with
imaginary degrees of malice.</P>
<P>But admitting the injury you have re∣ceived
to be ever so atrocious in its nature,
and aggravated in its circumstances; sup∣posing
it to be even parallel to that which
Joseph suffered; look up, like him, to that
divine government under which we are all
<PB N="324" REF="331"/>
placed. If forgiveness be a duty which
we know God to have required under the
most awful sanctions, dare we draw upon
ourselves the merited vengeance of that su∣periour,
to whose clemency we are obliged
daily to fly? When, with hard and unre∣lenting
dispositions towards our brethren,
we send up to Heaven prayers for mercy to
ourselves, those prayers return like impre∣cations
upon our heads; and our very de∣votions
seal our condemnation.</P>
<P>The most plain and natural sentiment of
equity concur with divine authority to
enforce the duty which I now recommend.
Let him who has never in his life done
wrong, be allowed the privilege of re∣maining
inexorable. But let such as are
conscious of frailties and crimes, consider
forgiveness as a debt which they owe to
others. Common failings are the strongest
lesson of mutual forbearance. Were this
virtue unknown among men, order and
comfort, peace and repose would be stran∣gers
to human life. Injuries retaliated ac∣cording
to the exorbitant measure which
<PB N="325" REF="332"/>
passion prescribes, would justify resentment
in return. The injured person would be∣come
the injurer; and thus wrongs, reta∣liations,
and fresh injuries, would circulate
in endless succession, till the world was
rendered a field of blood. Of all the pas∣sions
which invade the human breast, re∣venge
is the most direful. When allowed
to reign with full dominion, it is more than
sufficient to poison the few pleasures which
remain to man in his present state. How
much soever a person may suffer from in∣justice,
he is always in hazard of suffering
more from the prosecution of revenge.
The violence of an enemy cannot inflict
what is equal to the torment he creates to
himself, by means of the fierce and desperate
passions which he allows to rage in his
soul.</P>
<P>Those evil spirits who inhabit the regions
of misery, are represented as delighting in
revenge and cruelty. But all that is great
and good in the universe, is on the side of
clemency and mercy. The almighty Ruler
of the world, though for ages offended by
<PB N="326" REF="333"/>
the unrighteousness, and insulted by the
impiety of men, is <HI>long suffering and slow
to anger.</HI> His Son when he appeared in
our nature, exhibited both in his life and
his death, the most illustrious example of
forgiveness which the world ever beheld.
If you look into the history of mankind,
you will find that in every age, those who
have been respected as worthy, or admired
as great, have been distinguished for this
virtue. Revenge dwells in little minds.
A noble and magnanimous spirit is always
superiour to it. It suffers not from the inju∣ries
of men those severe shocks which others
feel. Collected within itself, it stands un∣moved
by their impotent assaults; and with
generous pity, rather than with anger, looks
down on their unworthy conduct. It has
been truly said, that the greatest man on
earth can no sooner commit an injury, than
a good man can make himself greater, by
forgiving it. Joseph, at the moment when
we now contemplate him, had entirely un∣der
his power all those unnatural brethren
who had been guilty towards him of the
<PB N="327" REF="334"/>
most cruel outrage which men could per∣petrate.
He could have retained them for
ever in that Egyptian bondage to which
they had once consigned him; and have
gratified revenge by every accumulation of
disgrace which despotic power enabled him
to inflict. Had he acted this part, he
might for a while have been soothed by the
pleasures of his high station. But remorse,
in the end, would have stung his soul.
Cruelty would have rendered him unhappy
within himself, as well as odious to others:
And his name would have perished among
the crowd of those contemptible statesmen,
whose actions stain the annals of history.
Whereas now, his character stands among
the foremost in the ranks of spotless fame.
His memory is blessed to all generations.
His example continues to edify the world;
and he himself shines in the celestial re∣gions
<HI>as the brightness of the firmament, and
as the stars for ever and ever.</HI> Let us now,</P>
<P>II. CONSIDER the sentiment contained
in the text, not only as a discovery of cor∣dial
<PB N="328" REF="335"/>
forgiveness, but as an expression of
devout attention to the conduct of Provi∣dence.
<HI>So now it was not you that sent me
hither, but God.</HI> Remark how beautifully
piety and humanity are, in this instance,
connected together. As we are told of
Cornelius, the good Centurion, that <HI>his
prayers and his alms,</HI> his devotion and his
good works, came up together <HI>in memorial
before God,</HI> so here we perceive fraternal
affection and religious reverence, mingling
in one emotion within the patriarch's heart.
In a person of low and vulgar mind, the
sensations on such an occasion would have
been extremely different. Looking back
on the past events of his life, he would
have ascribed all the adversity which he had
suffered, to the perverse treatment of his
brothers; and all the prosperity which he
afterwards attained, to his own good conduct
and wisdom; and by consequence would
have remained embittered against the instru∣ments
of the one, and filled with pride and
self-sufficiency on account of the other.
But the elevated and noble mind of Joseph
<PB N="329" REF="336"/>
rejected such unworthy sentiments. Con∣templating
the hand of God in all that had
befallen him, he effaced the remembrance
of those evil deeds which had produced his
adversity; and for his prosperity he affect∣ed
no praise to himself, but ascribed it en∣tirely
to the will of Heaven. Let us take
notice that this is not the reflection of a
private, retired man; whose situation might
be supposed to favour such devout medita∣tions.
It is the reflection of one, who was
leading a busy and a seducing life, in the
midst of a court; the favourite of the
greatest monarch who was then known in
the world. Yet him you behold, amidst
the submission and adulation which was
paid to him, preserving the moderation and
simplicity of a virtuous mind; and amidst
the idolatry and false philosophy of the
Egyptians, maintaining the principles of true
religion, and giving glory to the God of
Israel.</P>
<P>From this union of piety with humanity,
which is so conspicuous in the sentiments of
Joseph, there arises one very important in∣struction;
<PB N="330" REF="337"/>
That a devout regard to the hand
of God in the various events of life tends
to promote good dispositions and affections
towards men. It will be found by those
who attend to the workings of human na∣ture,
that a great proportion of those ma∣lignant
passions which break out in the in∣tercourse
of men, arises from consining their
attention wholly to second causes, and over∣looking
the first cause of all. Hence, they
are insolent in prosperity, because they dis∣cern
nothing higher than their own abili∣ties;
and in adversity they are peevish and
unforgiving, because they have no object
on which to fix their view, but the conduct
of men who have acted as their enemies.
They behold no plan of wisdom or goodness
carried on throughout nature, which can
allay the discomposure of their mind. As
soon as their temper is ruffled, the world
appears to them to be a continued scene of
disasters and injuries, of confused events
and of unreasonable men. Whereas to the
pious man, the contemplation of the uni∣verse
exhibits a very different spectacle. In
<PB N="331" REF="338"/>
the midst of seeming confusion he traces a
principle of order; and by attention to that
order, his mind is harmonized and calmed.
He beholds a wise and righteous Governour
presiding over all the commotions which
are raised by the tumult of conflicting pas∣sions
and interests; guiding, with imper∣ceptible
influnce, the hand of the violent to
beneficent purposes; accomplishing unex∣pected
ends by the most improbable means;
obliging the <HI>wrath of man to praise him;</HI>
sometimes humbling the mighty, sometimes
exalting the low; often <HI>snaring the wicked
in the devices which their hands have wrought.</HI>
Respectful acknowledgment of this divine
government, controuls the disorders of infe∣riour
passions. Reverence for the decrees
of Heaven inspires patience and modera∣tion.
Trust in that perfect wisdom and
goodness which directs all for the best, di∣minishes
the shock which worldly disasters
occasion. The irritation of passion and re∣sentment,
will always bear proportion to the
agitation which we suffer from the changes
of fortune. One who connects himself
<PB N="332" REF="339"/>
with nothing but second causes, partakes of
the violence and irregularity of all the in∣feriour
movements belonging to this great
machine. He who refers all to God, dwells,
if we may speak so, in that higher sphere
where motion begins; he is subject to fewer
shocks and concussions, and is only carried
along by the motion of the universe.</P>
<P>How can mildness or forgiveness gain
place in the temper of that man who, on
occasion of every calamity which he suffers
from the ill usage of others, has no sanctuary
within his own breast to which he can make
retreat from their vexations; who is pos∣sessed
of no principle which is of sufficient
power to bear down the rising tide of peevish
and angry passions? The violence of an
enemy, or the ingratitude of a friend, the
injustice of one man, and the treachery of
another, perpetually dwell and rankle in
his thoughts. The part which they have
acted in bringing on his distress is frequently
more grating to him than the distress itself.
Whereas he who in every event looks up to
God, has always in his view a great and ele∣vating
<PB N="333" REF="340"/>
object, which inspires him with mag∣nanimity.
His mind lies open to every
relieving thought, and is inclined to every
suggestion of generosity. He is disposed to
say with Joseph, <HI>it was not you that sent me
hither, but God;</HI> with David, <HI>it is the Lord;
let him do what seemeth good in his eyes;</HI> and
with a greater personage than either of these,
<HI>the cup which my Father hath given me to
drink, shall I not drink it?</HI> Hence arises
superiority to many of the ordinary provo∣cations
of the world. For he looks upon
the whole of his present life as part of a
great plan, which is carried on under the
direction of Heaven. In this plan, he views
men as acting their several parts, and con∣tributing
to his good or evil. But their
parts he considers as subordinate ones;
which, though they may justly merit his
affection, and may occasionally call forth
his resentment, yet afford no proper foun∣dation
to violent or maligant passion. He
looks upon bad men as only the rod with
which the Almighty chastens; like the
pestilence, the earthquake, or the storm.
<PB N="334" REF="341"/>
In the midst of their injustice and violence
he can pity their blindness; and imitate our
blessed Lord in praying, <HI>Father, forgive
them; for they know not what they do.</HI></P>

<BIBL>2 KINGS Viii. 12, 13.</BIBL>
<Q>And Hazael said, Why weepeth my Lord?
And he answered, Because I know the evil
that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel.
Their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and
their young men wilt thou stay with the
sword, and wilt dash their children, and
rip up their women with child. And
Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a
dog, that he should do this great thing?
And Elisha answered, The Lord hath
shewed me that thou shalt be king over
Syria.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the days of Joram king of Israel flou∣rished
the prophet Elisha.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XII.</NOTE> His character
was so eminent, and his fame so widely
spread, that Benhadad the king of Syria,
<PB N="336" REF="343"/>
though an idolater, sent to consult him con∣cerning
the issue of a distemper which
threatened his life. The messenger em∣ployed
on this occasion was Hazael, who
appears to have been one of the princes, or
chief men, of the Syrian court. Charged
with rich gifts from the king, he presents
himself before the prophet; and accosts him
in terms of the highest respect. During the
conference which they held together, Elisha
fixed his eye stedfastly on the countenance
of Hazael; and discerning, by a prophetic
spirit, his future tyranny and cruelty, he
could not contain himself from bursting into
a flood of tears. When Hazael, in surprise,
inquired ilnto the cause of this sudden emo∣tion,
the prophet plainly informs him of the
crimes and barbarities which he forsaw
that hereaster he should commit. The soul
of Hazael abhorred, at this time, the thoughts
of cruelty. Uncorrupted, as yet, by am∣bition
or greatness, his indignation arose at
being thought capable of such savage actions
as the prophet had mentioned; and, with
much warmth, he replies, <HI>But what? is
<PB N="337" REF="344"/>
thy servant a dog, that he should do this great
thing?</HI> Elisha makes no return but to point
out a remarkable change which was to take
place in his conditon; <HI>The Lord hath
shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.</HI>
In course of time, all that had been pre∣dicted
came to pass. Hazael asccended the
throne; and ambition took possession of his
heart. <HI>He smote the children of Israel in all
their coasts. He oppressed them during all
the days of King Jeboabaz</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings Xiii. 22.</NOTE>; and, from
what is left on record of his actions, plainly
appears to have proved what the prophet
foresaw him to be, a man of violence,
cruelty, and blood.</P>
<P>In this passage of history, an object is
presented which deserves our serious atten∣tion.
We behold a man who, in one state
of life, could not look upon certain crimes
without surprise and horrour; who knew
so little of himself as to believe it impossible
for him ever to be concerned in commit∣ting
them; that same man, by a change of
condition, transformed in all this sentiments,
<PB N="338" REF="345"/>
and as he rose in greatness, rising also in
guilt; till at last he completed that whole
character of iniquity which he once de∣tested.
Hence the following observations
naturally arise. I. That to a mind not
entirely corrupted, sentiments of abhorrence
at guilt are natural. II. That notwith∣standing
those sentiments, the mind may
be brought under the dominion of the vices
which it had most abhorred. III. That
this unhappy revolution is frequently owing
to a change of men's external circumstances
and condition in the world. These obser∣vations
are to make the subject of the pre∣sent
discourse; and will lead us to such a
view of human nature as, it is hoped, may
be of general use.</P>
<P>I. SENTIMENTS of abhorrence at guilt
are natural to the human mind. Hazael's
reply to the prophet shews how strongly he
felt them. <HI>Is thy servant a dog, that he
should do this great thing?</HI> Is he, or can he
ever be, so base and wretched as to perpe∣trate
crimes, which would render him un∣worthy
<PB N="339" REF="346"/>
of bearing the name of a man?
This is the voice of human nature, while
it is not as yet hardened in iniquity. Some
vices are indeed more odious to the mind
than others. Providence has wisely pointed
the sharpest edge of this natural aversion
aginst the crimes which are of most perni∣cious
and destrutive nature; such as trea∣chery,
oppression, and cruelty. But, in ge∣neral,
the distinction between moral good
and evil is so strongly marked, as to ac∣company
almost every vice with sensible
disapporbation. Present to any man, even
the most ignorant and untutored, an ob∣vious
instance of injustice, falsehood, or im∣piety;
let him view it in a cool moment,
when no passion blinds, and no interest
warps him; and you will find that his mind
immediately revolts against it, as shameful
and base, nay as deserving punishment.
Hence, in reasoing on the characters of
others, however men may mistake as to
facts, yet they generally praise and blame
according to the principles of sound mo∣rality.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="347"/>
With respect to their own character, a
notorious partiality too generally misleads
their judgment. But it is remarkable, that
no sinner ever avows directly to himself
that he has been guilty of gross and down∣right
iniquity. Even when engaged by his
passions in the commission of the greatest
crimes, he always palliates them to his own
mind by some extenuation or apology, some
pretended necessity, or some borrowed co∣lour
of innocence. Such power the unde∣niable
dignity of virtue, and the acknow∣ledged
turpitude of vice, possess over every
human heart. These sentiments are the re∣maining
impressions of that law, which was
originally written on the mind of man.
They are gleams of that light which once
shone clear and strong within us; and which,
though it be now greatly obsecured, yet con∣tinues
to shoot a feeble ray athwart the
darkness of human nature.—But what∣ever
sentiments of abhorrence at vice we
may at any time entertain, we have no
reason to build upon these a presumptuous
confidence of our continuance in virtue.
<PB N="341" REF="348"/>
For the next instruction which the next
suggests is,</P>
<P>II. THAT such is man's ignorance of his
own character, such the frailty of his na∣ture,
that he may one day become infa∣mous
for those very crimes which at present
he holds in detestation. This observation
is too well verified by the history of Hazael;
and a thousand other instances might be
brought to confirm it. Though there is
nothing which every person ought to know
so thoroughly as his own heart, yet from
the conduct of men it appears, that there is
nothing with which they are less acquainted.
Always more prone to flatter themselves
than desirous to discover the truth, they
trust to their being possessed of every virtue
which has not been put to the trial; and
reckon themselves secure against every vice
to which they have not hitherto been
tempted. As long as their duty hangs in
speculation, it appears so plain, and so eli∣gible,
that they cannot doubt of performing
it. The suspicion never enters their mind,
<PB N="342" REF="349"/>
that in the hour of speculation, and in the
hour of practice, their sentiments may differ
widely. Their present disposition they ea∣sily
persuade themselves will ever continue
the same; and yet that disposition is chan∣ging
with circumstances every moment.</P>
<P>The man who glows with the warm feel∣ings
of devotion, imagines it impossible for
him to lose that sense of the divine good∣ness
which at present melts his heart. He
whom his friend has friend has lately saved from ruin
is confident that, if some trying emergency
shall put his gratitude to proof, he will ra∣ther
die than abandon his benefactor. He
who lives happy and contented in frugal
industry, wonders how any man can give
himself up to dissolute pleasure. Were any
of those persons informed by a superiour
spirit, that the time was shortly to come
when the one should prove an example of
scandalous impiety, the other of treachery
to his friend, and the third of all that ex∣travagant
luxury which disgraces a growing
fortune; each of them would testify as much
surprise and abhorrence as Hazael did, upon
<PB N="343" REF="350"/>
hearing the predictions of the prophet. Sin∣cere
they might very possibly be in their
expressions of indignation; for hypocrisy
is not always to be charged on men whose
conduct is inconsistent. Hazael was in
earnest, when he resented with such ardour
the imputation of cruelty. The Apostle
Peter was sincere, when he made the zealous
profession, that though he should go to
prison and to death with his master, he
would never deny him. They were sin∣cere;
that is, they spoke from the fulness
of their hearts, and from the warmth of the
present moment; but they did not know
themselves, as the events which followed
plainly showed. So false to its principles,
too frequently, is the heart of man; so
weak is the foundation of human virtue; so
much reason there is for what the gospel
perpetually inculcates concerning the neces∣sity
of distrusting ourselves, and depending
on divine aid. Mortifying, I confess, is
this view of human nature; yet proper to
be attended to by all, in order to escape the
most fatal dangers. Fro, merely through
<PB N="344" REF="351"/>
unguarded conduct, and from the want of
this prudent suspicion of their own weak∣ness,
how many, after the most promising
beginnings, have gradually apostatized from
every principle of virtue; until, at last, it
has become as difficult for one to believe
that they ever had any love of goodness, as
it would have been once to have persuaded
themselves that they were to advance to
such a height in wickedness?</P>
<P>IN such cases as I have described, what
has become, it may be enquired, of those
sentiments of abhorrence at guilt which
were once felt so strongly? Are they to∣tally
erased? or, if in any degree they re∣main,
how do such persons contrive to
satisfy themselves in acting a part which
their minds condemn?—Here, there is a
mystery of iniquity which requires to be
unfolded. Latent and secret is the progress
of corruption within the soul; and the
more latent, the more dangerous is its
growth. No man becomes of a sudden
completely wicked. Guilt never shows its
<PB N="345" REF="352"/>
whole deformity at once; but by gradual
acquaintance reconciles us to its appearance,
and imperceptibly diffuses its poison through
all the powers of the mind. Every man
has some darling passion which generally
affords the first introduction to vice. The
irregular gratifications into which it occa∣sionally
seduces him, appear under the form
of venial weaknesses; and are indulged, in
the beginning, with scrupulousness and re∣serve.
But by longer practice these re∣straints
weaken, and the power of habit
grows. One vice brings in another to its
aid. By a sort of natural affinity they con∣nect
and entwine themselves together; till
their roots come to be spread wide and deep
over all the soul. When guilt rises to be
glaring, conscience endeavours to remon∣strate.
But conscience is a calm principle.
Passion is loud and impetuous; and creates
a tumult which drowns the voice of reason.
It joins, besides, artisice to violence; and
seduces at the same time that it impels.
For it employs the understanding to impose
upon the conscience. It devises reasons
<PB N="346" REF="353"/>
and arguments to justify the corruptions of
the heart. The common practice of the
world is appealed to. Nice distinctions are
made. Men are found to be circumstanced
in so peculiar a manner, as to render cer∣tain
actions excusable, if not blameless,
which, in another situation, it is confessed
would have been criminal. By such a pro∣cess
as this, there is reason to believe that
a great part of mankind advance from step
to step in sin, partly hurried by passion,
and partly blinded by self-deceit, without
any just sense of the degree of guilt which
they contract. By inveterate habits the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
judgment is, at length, perverted, and their
moral feelings are deadened. They see
now with other eyes; and can look with∣out
pian on evil actions which they for∣merly
abhorred.</P>
<P>It is proper, however, to observe, that
though our native sentiments of abhorrence
at guilt may be so born down, or so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luded
as to lose their influence on conduct, yet
those sentiments belonging originally to our
frame, and being never totally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>radicated
<PB N="347" REF="354"/>
from the soul, will still retain so much au∣thority,
as if not to reform, at least on some
occasions, to chasten the sinner. It is only
during a course of prosperity, that vice is
able to carry on its delusions without dis∣turbance.
But, amidst the dark and
thoughtful situations of life, conscience re∣gains
its rights; and pours the whole bit∣terness
of remorse on his heart who has
apostatized from his original principles.
We may well believe that, before the end
of his days, Hazael's first impressions would
be made to return. In the hour of adver∣sity,
the remembrance of his conserence
with the venerable Prophet would sting his
heart. Comparing the sentiments which,
in those his better days, he felt, with the
atrocious cruelties which he had afterwards
committed, all the honours of royalty would
be unable to save him from the inward sense
of baseness and insamy.</P>
<P>FROM this view which has been exhi∣bited
of the progress of corruption, and of
the danger of which we are exposed of
<PB N="348" REF="355"/>
falling from principles with once appeared
firmly established, let us receive useful ad∣monition
for our own conduct. <HI>Let not
him that girdeth on his harness, boast like him
that putteth it off.</HI> Let no man place a rash
and dangerous confidence in his virtue.
But <HI>let him that thinketh he standeth, take
heed lest he fall.</HI> Never adventure on too
near an approach to what is evil. Fami∣liarize
not yourselves with it, in the slight∣est
instances, without fear. Listen with
reverence to every reprehension of con∣science;
and preserve the most quick and
accurate sensibility to right and wrong. If
ever your moral impressions begin to de∣cay,
and your natural abhorrence of guilt
to lessen, you have ground to dread that
the ruin of virtue is fast approaching.
While you employ all the circumspection
and vigilance which reason can suggest, let
your prayers, at the same time, continually
ascend to God for support and aid. Re∣member
that from his <HI>descendeth every good
and perfect gift;</HI> and that to him only it
belongs to <HI>keep you from falling, and to pre∣sent
<PB N="349" REF="356"/>
you faultless before the presence of his
glory with exceeding joy.</HI> I proceed now to
the</P>
<P>III. OBSERVATION from the text, That
the power which corruption acquires to
pervert the original principles of men, is
frequently owing to a change of their cir∣cumstances
and condition in the world.
How different was Hazael the messenger
of Benhadad, from Hazael the king; he
who started at the mention of cruelty, from
him who waded in blood! Of this sad
and surprising revolution, the Prophet em∣phatically
assigns the cause in these few
words; <HI>The Lord hath shewed me that thou
shalt be king over Syria.</HI> That crown, that
fatal crown, which is to be set upon thy
head, shall shed a malignant influence over
thy nature; and shall produce that change
in thy character which now thou canst
not believe.—Whose experience of the
world is so narrow, as not to furnish him
with instances similar to this, in much
humbler conditions of life? So great is
<PB N="350" REF="357"/>
the influence of a new situation of external
fortune; such a different turn it gives to
our temper and affections, to our views
and desires, that no man can foretell what
his character would prove, should Providence
either raise or depress his circumstances in
a remarkable degree, or throw him into
some sphere of action widely different from
that to which he has been accustomed in
former life.</P>
<P>The seeds of various qualities, good and
bad, lie in all our hearts. But until pro∣per
occasions r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pen, and bring them for∣ward,
they lie there inactive and dead.
They are covered up and concealed within
the recesses of our nature: or, if they spring
up at all, it is under such an appearance as
is frequently mistaken, even by ourselves.
Pride, for instance, in certain situations,
has no opportunity of displaying itself, but
as magnanimity, or sense of honour. Ava∣rice
appears as necessary and laudable oeco∣nomy.
What in one station of life would
discover itself to be cowardice and baseness
of mind, passes in another for prudent cir∣cumspection.
<PB N="351" REF="358"/>
What in the fulness of power
would prove to be cruelty and oppression,
is reputed, in a subordinate rank, no more
than the exercise of proper discipline. For
a while, the man is known neither by the
world, nor by himself, to be what he truly
is. But bring him into a new situation of
life, which accords with his predominant
disposition; which strikes on certain latent
qualities of his soul, and awakens them into
action; and, as the leaves of a flower gra∣dually
unfold to the sun, so shall all his
true character open full to view.</P>
<P>This may, in one light, be accounted
not so much an alteration of character pro∣duced
by a change of circumstances, as a
discovery brought forth of the real character,
which formerly lay concealed. Yet, at the
same time, it is true that the man himself
undergoes a change. For opportunity being
given for certain dispositions, which had
been dormant, to exert themselves without
restraint, they of course gather strength.
By means of the ascendency which they
gain, other parts of the temper are borne
<PB N="352" REF="359"/>
down; and thus an alteration is made in
the whole structure and system of the soul.
He is a truly wise and good man who,
through divine assistance, remains superi∣our
to this influence of fortune on his cha∣racter;
who having once imbibed worthy
sentiments, and established proper principles
of action, continues constant to these,
whatever his circumstances be; maintains,
throughout all the changes of his life, one
uniform and supported tenour of conduct;
and what he abhorred as evil and wicked in
the beginning of his days, continues to ab∣hor
to the end. But how rare is it to meet
with this honourable consistency among
men, while they are passing through the
different stations and periods of life! When
they are setting out in the world, before
their minds have been greatly misled or
debased, they glow with generous emotions,
and look with contempt on what is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orbid
and guilty. But advancing farther in life,
and inured by degrees to the crooked ways
of men; pressing through the crowd, and
the bustle of the world; obliged to contend
<PB N="353" REF="360"/>
with this man's craft, and that man's scorn;
accustomed, sometimes, to conceal their
sentiments, and often to stifle their feelings,
they became at last hardened in heart, and
familiar with corruption. Who would not
drop a tear over this sad, but frequent fall of
human probity and honour! Who is not
humbled, when he beholds the refined sen∣timents
and high principles on which we
are so ready to value ourselves, brought to
such a shameful issue; and man, with all
his boasted attainments of reason, discover∣ed
so often to be the creature of his exter∣nal
fortune, moulded and formed by the
incidents of his life!</P>
<P>THE instance of Hazael's degeneracy
leads us to reflect, in particular, on the dan∣gers
which arise from stations of power and
greatness; especially, when the elevation of
men to these has been rapid and sudden.
Few have the strength of mind which is re∣quisite
for bearing such a change with tem∣perance,
and self-command. The respect
which is paid to the great, and the scope
<PB N="354" REF="361"/>
which their condition affords for the indul∣gence
of pleasure, are perilous circumstances
to virtue. When men live among their
equals, and are accustomed to encounter the
hardships of life, they are of course remind∣ed
of their mutual dependence on each
other, and of the dependence of all upon
God. But when they are highly exalted
above their fellows, they meet with few
objects to awaken serious reflection, but
with many to feed and inflame their pas∣sions.
They are apt to separate their in∣terest
from that of all around them; to
wrap themselves up in their vain grandeur;
and in the lap of indolence and selfish plea∣sure,
to acquire a cold indifference to the
concerns even of those whom they call their
friends. The fancied independence into which
they are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up, in adverse to sentiments
of piety, as well as of humanity, in their
heart. <HI>Taking the timbrel and the harp, and
rejoicing at the sound of the organ, they say
unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not
the knowledge of thy ways. What is the
Almighty that we should serve him? or what
<PB N="355" REF="362"/>
profit should we have, if we pray unto
him?</HI></P>
<P>But we are not to imagine, that elevated
stations in the world furnish the only formi∣dable
trials to which our virtue is exposed.
It will be found, that we are liable to no
fewer nor less dangerous temptations, from
the opposite extreme of poverty and depres∣sion.
When men who have known better
days are thrown down into abject situations
of fortune, their spirits are broken and their
tempers soured. Envy rankles in their
breast at such as are more successful. The
providence of Heaven is accused in secret
murmurs; and the sense of misery is ready
to push them into atrocious crimes, in order
to better their state. Among the inferiour
classes of mankind, craft and dishonesty are
too often found to prevail. Low and pe∣nurious
circumstances depress the human
powers. They deprive men of the proper
means of knowledge and improvement; and
where ignorance is gross, it is always in
hazard of engendering profligacy.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="363"/>
Hence it has been, generally, the opi∣nion
of wise men in all ages, that there is
a certain middle condition of life, equally
remote from either of those extremes of
fortune, which, though it want not also its
own dangers, yet is, on the whole, the
state most favourable both to virtue and to
happiness. For there, luxury and pride on
the one hand, have not opportunity to ener∣vate
or intoxicate the mind, nor want and
dependence on the other, to sink and de∣base
it; there, all the native affections of
the soul have the freest and fairest exercise,
the equality of men is felt, friendships are
formed, and improvements of every sort are
pursued with most success; there, men are
prompted to industry without being over∣come
by toil, and their powers called forth
into exertion, without being either super∣seded
by too much abundance, or baffled
by insuperable difficulties; there, a mixture
of comforts and of wants, at once awakens
their gratitude to God, and reminds them
of their dependence on his aid; and there∣fore,
in this state, men seem to enjoy life to
<PB N="357" REF="364"/>
most advantage, and to be least exposed to
the snares of vice. Such a condition is re∣corded,
in the book of Proverbs, to have
been the wish and choice of one who was
eminent for wisdom. <HI>Remove far from me
vanity and lies. Give me neither poverty nor
riches. Feed me with food convenient for
me. Lest I be full and deny thee, and say,
Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor and steal,
and take the name of my God in vain</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 8, 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM the whole view which we have
now taken of the subject, we may, in the
first place, learn the reasons for which a
variety of conditions and ranks was esta∣blished
by Providence among mankind.
This life is obviously intended to be a state
of probation and trial. No trial of charac∣ters
is requisite with respect to God, who
sees what is in every heart, and perfectly
knows what part each man would act, in all
the possible situations of fortune. But on
account of men themselves, and of the
<PB N="358" REF="365"/>
world around them, it was necessary that
trial should take place, and a discrimination
of characters be made; in order that true
virtue might be separated from false appear∣ances
of it, and the justice of Heaven be
displayed in its final retributions; in order
that the failings of men might be so dis∣covered
to themselves, as to afford them
proper instruction, and promote their amend∣ment;
and in order that their characters
might be shown to the world in every
point of view, which could furnish either
examples for imitation, or admonitions of
danger. The accomplishment of these im∣portant
purposes required, that human life
should not always proceed in one tenour;
but that it should both be chequered with
many revolutions, and diversified by a va∣riety
of employments and ranks; in pass∣ing
through which, the touchstone might
be applied to the characters of men, and
their hidden virtues or vices explored.
Hazael might have appeared in history with
a degree of reputation to which he was not
entitled, had he continued to act in a sub∣ordinate
<PB N="359" REF="366"/>
station. At bottom, he was false
and unsound. When raised higher in life,
the corruption of his heart discovered itself;
and he is now held forth with deserved in∣famy,
as a warning to succeeding ages.</P>
<P>IN the second place we learn, from what
has been said, the importance of attending
with the utmost care to the choice which we
make of our employment and condition in
life. It has been shown, that our external
situation frequently operates powerfully on
our moral character; and by consequence
that it is strictly connected, not only with
our temporal welfare, but with our ever∣lasting
happiness or misery. He who might
have passed unblamed, and upright, through
certain walks of life, by unhappily chusing
a road where he meets with temptations too
strong for his virtue, precipitates himself
into shame here, and into endless ruin here∣after.
Yet how often is the determination
of this most important article left to the
chance of accidental connections, or sub∣mitted
to the option of youthful fancy and
<PB N="360" REF="367"/>
humour? When it is made the subject of
serious deliberation, how seldom have they,
on whom the decision of it depends, any
further view than so to dispose of one who
is coming out into life, as that he may the
soonest become rich, or, as it is expressed,
make his way to most advantage in the
world? Are there no other objects than
this to be attended to, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixing the plan of
life? Are there no more sacred and im∣portant
interests which deserve to be con∣sulted?
—You would not willingly place
one for whose welfare you was interested, in
a situation for which you were convinced
that his abilities were unequal. These,
therefore, you examine with care; and on
them you rest the ground of your decision.
Be persuaded that not abilities merely, but
the turn of the temper and the heart, require
to be examined with equal attention, in
forming the plan of furture establishment.
Every one has some peculiar weakness,
some predominant passion, which exposes
him to temptations of one kind more than
of another. Early this may be discerned
<PB N="361" REF="368"/>
to shoot; and from its first risings its fu∣ture
growth may be inferred. Anticipate
its progress. Consider how it is likely to
be affected, by succeeding occurrences in
life. If you bring one whom you are rear∣ing
up into a situation, where all the sur∣rounding
circumstances shall cherish and
mature this fatal principle in his nature,
you become, in a great measure, answerable
for the consequences that follow. In vain
you trust to his abilities and powers. Vice
and corruption, when they have tainted the
heart, are sufficient to overset the greatest
abilities. Nay, too frequently they tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
them against the possessor; and render
them the instruments of his more speedy
ruin.</P>
<P>IN the third place, we learn from the
history which has been illustrated, never to
judge of true happiness, merely from the
degree of men's advancement in the world.
Always betrayed by appearances, the mul∣titude
are caught by nothing so much as by
the show and pomp of life. They think
<PB N="362" REF="369"/>
every one blest, who is raised far above others
in rank. From their earliest years they are
taught to fix their views upon worldly ele∣vation,
as the ultimate object of their aims;
and of all the sources of error in conduct,
this is the most general.—Hazael on the
throne of Syria would, doubtless, be more
envied, and esteemed by the multitude a
far happier man than, when yet a subject,
he was employed by Benhadad to carry his
message to Elisha. Yet, O Hazael! how
much better had it been for thee never to
have known the name or honour of a king,
than to have purchased it at the expence of
so much guilt; forfeiting thy first and best
character; rushing into crimes which were
once thine abhorrence; and becoming a
traitor to the native sentiments and dictates
of thy heart! How fatal to thy repose
proved that coveted purple, which was
drenched by thee in so much innocent blood!
How much more cheerful were thy days,
and how much calmer thy nights, in the
former periods of thy life, than, when
placed on a throne, thy car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were invaded
<PB N="363" REF="370"/>
by day with the cries of the miserable whom
thou hadst ruined; and thy slumbers broken
by night with the shocking remembrance of
thy cruelties and crimes!—Never let us
judge by the outside of things; nor con∣clude
a man to be happy, solely because he
is encompassed with wealth or grandeur.
Much misery often lurks where it is little
suspected by the world. The material en∣quiries
respecting felicity are, not what a
man's external condition is, but with what
disposition of mind he bears it; whether he
be corrupted or improved by it; whether
he conducts himself so as to be acceptable
to God, and approved of by good men.
For these are the circumstances which make
the real and important distinctions among
the conditions of men. The effects of these
are to last for ever, when all worldly dis∣tinctions
shall be forgotten.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, from all that has
been said, we should learn never to be im∣moderately
anxious about our external situ∣ation,
but to submit our lot with cheerful∣ness
to the disposal of Heaven. To make
<PB N="364" REF="371"/>
the best and most prudent arrangements
which we can, respecting our condition in
life, is matter of high duty. But let us
rememeber, that all the plans which we form
are precarious and uncertain. After the
utmost precautions taken by human wis∣dom,
no man can foresee the hidden dan∣gers
which may await him in that path of
life on which he has pitched. Providence
chuses for us much more wisely than we
can chuse for ourselves; and, from circum∣stances
that appeared at first most unpro∣mising
and adverse, often brings forth in
the issue both temporal and spiritual felicity.
<HI>Who knoweth what is good for man in this
life, all the days of his vain life, which he
spendeth as a shadow?</HI> When we consider
the darkness of our present state, the im∣becility
of human nature, and the doubtful
and ambiguous value of all that we call
prosperity, the exhortation of the Psalmist
comes home with great force on every re∣flecting
mind, <HI>Commit thy way unto the
Lord</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Psalm xxxvii. 5.</NOTE>. Form thy measures with prudence▪
<PB N="365" REF="372"/>
but divest thyself of anxiety about the issue.
Instead of seeking to order thine own lot,
acquiesce in the appointment of Heaven,
and follow without hesitation the call of
Providence, and of duty. In whatever situ∣ation
of life God shall place thee, look up
devoutly to Him for grace and assistance;
and study to act the part assigned thee with
a faithful and upright heart. Thus shalt
thou have peace within thyself, while thy
course is going on; and when it draws to∣wards
a close, with satisfaction thou shalt
review thy conduct. For, after all the toils
and labours of life, and all the vain struggles
which we maintain for pre-eminence and
distinction, we shall find at the conclusion
of the whole scene, that <HI>to fear God and
keep his commandments is the whole of man.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ECCLESIASTES vii. 2, 3, 4.</BIBL>
<Q>It is better to go to the house of mourning,
than to go to the house of feasting; for that
is the end of all men, and the living will
lay it to his heart. Sorrow is better than
laughter; for by the sadness of the coun∣tenance
the heart is made better. The
heart of the wise is in the house of mourn∣ing;
but the heart of fools is in the house
of mirth.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MANY of the maxims contained in
this book of Ecclesiastes will appear
strange sayings to the men of the world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE>
But when they reflect on the character of
<PB N="367" REF="374"/>
him who delivers them, they cannot but
admit that his tenets deserve a serious and
attentive examination. For they are not
the doctrines of a pedant, who, from an
obscure retirement, declaims against plea∣sures
which he never knew. They are not
the invectives of a disappointed man, who
takes revenge upon the world, by satirizing
those enjoyments, which he sought in vain to
obtain. They are the conclusions of a great
and prosperous prince, who had once given
full scope to his desires; who was thoroughly
acquainted with life in its most flattering
scenes; and who now, reviewing all that
he had enjoyed, delivers to us the result of
long experience, and tried wisdom. None
of his principles seem, at first view, more
dubious and exceptionable than those which
the text presents. To assert that sorrow is
preferable to mirth, and the <HI>house of mourn∣ing</HI>
to the <HI>house of feasting;</HI> to advise men
to chuse mortification and sadness when it
is in their power to indulge in joy, may
appear harsh and unreasonable doctrines.
They may, perhaps, be accounted enemies
<PB N="368" REF="375"/>
to the innocent enjoyment of life who give
countenance to so severe a system, and
thereby increase the gloom which already
sits sufficiently heavy on the condition of
man. But let this censure be suspended,
until we examine with care into the spirit
and meaning of the sentiments here de∣livered.</P>
<P>It is evident that the wise man does not
prefer sorrow, upon its own account, to
mirth; or represent sadness as a state more
eligible than joy. He considers it in the
light of discipline only. He views it with
reference to an end. He compares it with
certain improvements which he supposes it
to produce; when <HI>the heart is made better
by the sadness of the countenance, and the
living to lay to heart what is the end of all
men.</HI> Now, if great and lasting benefits
are found to result from occasional sadness,
these, sure, may be capable of giving it the
preference to some fleeting sensations of joy.
The means which he recommends in order
to our obtaining those benefits are to be ex∣plained
according to the principles of sound
<PB N="369" REF="376"/>
reason; and to be understood with those
limitations which the eastern style, in de∣livering
moral precepts, frequently requires.
He bids us <HI>go to the house of mourning;</HI> but
he does not command us to dwell there.
When he prefers sorrow to laughter, he is
not to be understood as prohibiting all mirth;
as requiring us to wear a perpetual cloud on
our brow, and to sequestrate ourselves from
every cheerful entertainment of social life.
Such an interpretation would be inconsistent
with many other exhortations in his own
writings, which recommend temperate and
innocent joy. It would not suit with the
proper discharge of the duties which be∣long
to us as members of society; and
would be most opposite to the goodness and
benignity of our Creator. The true scope
of his doctrine in this passage is, that there
is a certain temper and state of heart, which
is of far greater consequence of real happi∣ness,
than the habitual indulgence of giddy
and thoughtless mirth; that for the attain∣ment
and cultivation of this temper, fre∣quent
returns of grave reflection are neces∣sary;
<PB N="370" REF="377"/>
that, upon this account, it is profit∣able
to give admission to those views of hu∣man
distress which tend to awaken such
reflection in the mind; and that thus, from
the vicissitudes of sorrow, which we either
experience in our own lot, or sympathize
with in the lot of others, much wisdom and
improvement may be derived. These are
the sentiments which I purpose at present
to justify and recommend, as most suitable
to the character of men and of Christians;
and not in the least inconsistent with plea∣sure,
rightly understood.</P>
<P>Among the variety of dispositions which
are to be found in the world, some indeed
require less of this discipline than others.
There are persons whose tender and deli∣cate
sensibility, either derived from nature,
or brought on by repeated afflictions, ren∣ders
them too deeply susceptible of every
mournful impression; whose spirits stand
more in need of being supported and cheer∣ed,
than of being saddened by the dark
views of human life. In such cases, we are
commanded to <HI>lift up the hands which hang
<PB N="371" REF="378"/>
down, and to confirm the feeble knees</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Isaiah xxxv. 3. Heb. xii. 12.</NOTE>. But
this is far from being the common disposi∣tion
of men. Their minds are in general
inclined to levity, much more than to
thoughtful m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lancholy; and their hearts
more apt to be contracted and hardened,
than to relent with too much facility. I
shall therefore endeavour to shew them, what
bad inclinations their compliance with So∣lomon's
advice would correct; what good
dispositions with respect to God, their neigh∣bours,
and themselves, it would improve;
and how, upon the whole, his doctrine is
verified, that <HI>by the sadness of the countenance
the heart is made better.</HI></P>
<P>I B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>GIN by observing, that the temper
recommended in the text suits the present
constitution of things in this world. Had
man been destined for a course of undis∣turbed
enjoyment, perpetual gaiety would
then have corresponded to his state; and
pensive thought have been an unnatural
intrusion. But in a state where all is che∣quered
<PB N="372" REF="379"/>
and mixed, where there is no pro∣sperity
without a reverse, and no joy with∣out
its attending griefs; where from the
house of feasting all must, at one time or
other, pass into the house of mourning, it
were equally unnatural if no admission was
given to grave reflection. The mind of
man must be attempered to his condition.
Providence, whose wisdom is conspicuous
in all its works, ha adjusted with exact
proportion the inward powers to the out∣ward
state of every rational being. It has
for this purpose implanted the serious and
sympathetic feelings in our nature, that they
might correspond with the vicissitudes of
sorrow in our lot. He who endeavours to
repel their influence, or to stifle them in
unseasonable mirth, acts a violent and un∣natural
part. He strives with vain effort
against the current of things; contradicts
the intentions of his Maker, and counter∣acts
the original impulses of his own heart.</P>
<P>It is proper also to observe, that as <HI>the
sadness of the countenance</HI> has, in our present
situation, a proper and natural place; so it
<PB N="373" REF="380"/>
is requisite to the true enjoyment of plea∣sure.
Worldly and sensual men often re∣mark
not, till it be too late, that, by the
studied efforts of constant repetition, all their
pleasures fail. They draw them off so close
to the dregs, that they become insipid and
nauseous. Hence even <HI>in laughter their
heart is sorrowful, and the end of their mirth
is heaviness</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 13.</NOTE>. It is only the interposal of
serious an thoughtful hours, that can give
any lively sensation to the returns of joy.
I speak not of those thoughtful hours, too
well known to sinners, which proceed from
guilty remorse; and which, instead of pre∣paring
for future pleasure, damp and sicken
the moment of enjoyment; but of those
which take rise from the mind retreating
into itself, and opening to the sentiments of
religion and humanity. Such hours of
virtuous sadness brighten the gleams of suc∣ceding
joy. They give to the temperate
enjoyments of the pious and humane a re∣fined
and delicate relish, to which the hard∣ened
and insensible are entire strangers.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="381"/>
For it will be found, that in proportion as
the tender affections of the soul are kept
awake, how much soever they may some∣times
distress the heart, they preserve it open
likewise to the most agreeable sensations.
He who never knew the sorrows of friend∣ship,
never also knew its joys. He whose
heart cannot relent in the house of mourn∣ing,
will, in the most social hour of the
house of feasting, partake of no more than
the lowest part of animal pleasure.—
Having premised these observations, I pro∣ceed
to point out the direct effects of a
proper attention to the distresses of life upon
our moral and religious character.</P>
<P>IN the first place, the house of mourn∣ing
is calculated to give a proper check to
our natural thoughtlessness and levity. The
indolence of mankind, and their love of
pleasure, spread through all characters and
ranks some degree of aversion to what
is grave and serious. They grasp at any
object, either of business or amusement,
which makes the present moment pass
<PB N="375" REF="382"/>
smoothly away; which carries their thoughts
abroad, and saves them from the trouble of
reflecting on themselves. With too many,
this passes into a habit of constant dissipa∣tion.
If their fortune and rank allow them
to indulge their inclinations, they devote
themselves to the pursuit of amusement
through all its different forms. The skilful
arrangement of its successive scenes, and the
preparatory study for shining in each, are
the only exertions in which their under∣standing
is employed. Such a mode of life
may keep alive, for a while, a frivolous vi∣vacity.
It may improve men in some of
those exteriour accomplishments, which
sparkle in the eyes of the giddy and the
vain; but it must sink them in the esteem
of all the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. It renders them strangers
to themselves; and useless, if not perni∣cious,
to the world. They lose every manly
principle. Their minds become relaxed
and effeminate. All that is great or re∣spectable
in the human character is buried
under a mass of trifles and follies.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="383"/>
If some measures ought to be taken for
rescuing the mind from this disgraceful le∣vity;
if some principles must be acquired
which may give more dignity and steadi∣ness
to conduct, where, I pray you, are
these to be looked for? Not surely in the
house of feasting, where every object flat∣ters
the senses, and strengthens the seduc∣tions
to which we are already prone; where
the spirit of dissipation circulates from heart
to heart; and the children of folly mutually
admire, and are admired. It is in the sober
and serious house of mourning that the tide
of vanity is made to turn, and a new di∣rection
given to the current of thought.
When some affecting incident presents a
strong discovery of the dec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itfulness of all
worldly joy, and rouses our sensibility to
human woe; when we behold those with
whom we had lately mingled in the house
of feasting, sunk by some of the sudden
vicissitudes of li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e into the vale of misery;
or when, in sad silence, we stand by the
friend whom we had loved as our own soul,
stretched on the bed of death; then is the
<PB N="377" REF="384"/>
season when the world begins to appear in a
new light; when the heart opens to virtu∣ous
sentiments, and is led into that train of
reflection which ought to direct life. He
who before knew not what it was to com∣mune
with his heart on any serious subject,
now puts the question to himself, for what
purpose he was sent forth into this mortal,
transitory state; what his fate is likely to
be when it concludes; and what judgment
he ought to form of those pleasures which
amuse for a little, but which, he now sees,
cannot save the heart from anguish in the
evil day. Touched by the hand of thought∣ful
melancholy, that airy edifice of bliss
which fancy had raised up for him, vanishes
away. He beholds in the place of it, the
lonely and barren desert, in which, sur∣rounded
with many a disagreeable object,
he is left mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing upon himself. The time
which he has mis-spent, and the faculties
which he has misemployed, his foolish le∣vity
and his criminal pursuits, all rise in
painful prospect before him. That un∣known
state of existence into which, race
<PB N="378" REF="385"/>
after race, the children of men pass, strikes
his mind with solemn awe.—Is there no
course by which he can re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ieve his past er∣rours?
Is there no superiour power to
which he can look up for aid? Is there no
plan of conduct which, if it exempt him
not from sorrow, can at least procure him
consolation amidst the distressful exigencies
of life?—Such meditations as these, sug∣gested
by the house of mourning, fre∣quently
produce a change on the whole
character. They revive those sparks of
goodness which were nigh being quite ex∣tinguished
in the dissipated mind; and give
rise to principles of conduct more rational
in themselves, and more suitable to the hu∣man
state.</P>
<P>IN the second place, impressions of this
nature not only produce moral seriousness,
but awaken sentiments of piety, and bring
men into the sanctuary of religion. One
might, indeed, imagine that the blessings
of a prosperous condition would prove the
most natural incitements to devotion; and
<PB N="379" REF="386"/>
that when men were happy in themselves,
and saw nothing but happiness around them,
they could not fail gratefully to acknow∣ledge
that God who <HI>giveth them all things
richly to enjoy.</HI> Yet such is their corruption,
that they are never more ready to forget
their benefactor, than when loaded with his
benefits. The giver is concealed form their
careless and inattentive view, by the cloud
of his own gifts. When their life conti∣nues
to flow in one smooth current, un∣ruffled
by any griefs; when they neither
receive in their own circumstances, nor al∣low
themselves to receive from the circum∣stances
of others, any admonitions of hu∣man
instability, they not only become
regardless of Providence, but are in hazard
of contemning it. Glorying in their strength,
and lifted up by the pride of life into sup∣posed
independence, that impious senti∣ment,
if not uttered by the mouth, yet too
often lurks in the hearts of many, during
their flourishing periods, <HI>What is the Al∣mighty
that we should serve him, and what
profit should we have if we pray unto him?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="387"/>
If such be the tendency of the house of
feasting, how necessary is it that, by some
change in their situation, men should be
obliged to enter into the house of mourn∣ing,
in order to recover a proper sense of
their dependent state? It is there, when
forsaken by the gaieties of the world, and
left alone with God, that we are made to
perceive how awful his government is; how
easily human greatness bends before him;
and how quickly all our designs and mea∣sures,
at his interposal, vanish into no∣thing.
There, when the countenance is
sad, and the affections are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oftened by grief;
when we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it apart, involved in serious
thought, looking down as from some emi∣nence
n those dark clouds that hang over
the life of man, he arrogance of prosperity
is humbled, and the heart melts under the
impressions of religion. Formerly we were
taught, but now we see, we feel, how
much we stand in need of an Almighty
protector, amidst the changes of this vain
world. Our soul cleaves to him who <HI>de∣spises
not, nor abhors the affliction of the
<PB N="381" REF="388"/>
afflicted.</HI> Prayer flows forth of its own ac∣cord
from the relenting heart, that he may
be our God, and the God of our friends in
distress; that he may never forsake us while
we are sojourning in this land of pilgrim∣age;
may strengthen us under its cala∣mities,
and bring us hereafter to those ha∣bitations
of rest, where we, and they whom
we love, may be delivered from the trials
which all are now doomed to endure. The
discoveries of his mercy which he has made
in the gospel of Christ, are viewed with
joy, as so many rays of light sent down
from above to dispel, in some degree, the
surrounding gloom. A mediator an in∣tercessor
with the Sovereign of the Uni∣verse,
appear comfortable names; and the
resurrection of the just becomes the power∣ful
cordial of grief. In such moments as
these, which we may justly call happy mo∣ments,
the soul participates of all the plea∣sures
of devotion. It feels the power of
religion to support and relieve. It is soft∣ened,
without being broken. It is full,
and it pours itself forth; pours itself forth,
<PB N="382" REF="389"/>
if we may be allowed to use the expression,
into the bosom of its merciful Creator.</P>
<P>IN the third place, such seriours senti∣ments
produce the happiest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ect upon our
disposition towards our fellow-creatures, as
well as towards God. It is a common and
just observation, that they who have lived
always in affluence and ease, strangers to
the miseries of life, are liable to contract
hardness of heart with respect to all the
concerns of others. Wrapped up in them∣selves,
and their own pleasures, they be∣hold
with indifference the most affecting
scenes of distress. Habituated to indulge
all their desires without controul, they be∣come
impatient of the least provocation or
offence; and are ready to trample on their
inserious, as if they were creatures of a
different species form themselves. Is this
an amiable temper, or such as becomes a
man? When appearing in others, do we
not view it with much displeasure? When
imputed to ourselves, can we avoid account∣ing
it a severe reproach?</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="390"/>
By the experience of distress, this arro∣gant
insensibility of temper is most effec∣tually
corrected; as the remembrance of
our own sufferings naturally prompts us to
feel for others when they suffer. But if
Providence has been so kind as not to sub∣ject
us to much of this discipline in our own
lot, let us draw improvement from the
harder lot of others. Let us sometimes step
aside from the smooth and flowery paths
in which we are permitted to walk, in
order to view the toilsome march of our
fellows through the thorny desert. By vo∣luntarily
going into the house of mourning;
by yielding to the sentiments which it ex∣cites,
and mingling our tears with those of
the afflicted, we shall acquire that humane
sensibility, which is one of the higest orna∣ments
of the nature of man. Perceiving
how much the common distresses of life
place us all on a level, and render the high
and the low, the rich and the poor, com∣panions
in misfortune and mortality, we
shall learn to set no man at nought, and,
least of any, our afflicted brother. Preju∣dices
<PB N="384" REF="391"/>
will be extinguished, and benevo∣lence
opened and enlarged, when looking
around on the multitude of men, we con∣sider
them as a band of fellow-travellers
in the valley of woe, where it ought to be
the office of every one to alleviate, as much
as possible, the common burden.—While
the vain and the licentious are revelling in
the midst of extravagance and riot, how
little do they think of those scenes of sore
distress which are going on at that moment
throughout the world; multitudes strug∣gling
for a poor subsistence to support the
wife and the children whom they love, and
who look up to them with eager eyes for
that bread which they can hardly procure;
multitudes groaning under sickness in de∣solate
cottages, untended and unmourned;
many, apparently in a better situation of
life, pining away in secret with concealed
griefs; families weeping over the beloved
friends whom they have lost, or, in all the
bitterness of anguish, bidding those who
are just expiring the last adieu!</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="392"/>
May we not appeal to the heart of every
good man, nay almost to the heart of every
man who has not divested himself of his
natural feelings, whether the admission of
such views of human life might not, some∣times
at least, furnish a more worthy employ∣ment
to the mind, than that <HI>mirth of fools,</HI>
which Solomon compares to <HI>the crackling
of thorns under a pot</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. vii. 6.</NOTE>; the transient burst
of unmeaning joy; the empty explosion
of giddiness and levity? Those sallies of
jollity in the house of feasting are often
forced form a troubled mind; like flashes
from the black cloud, which, after a mo∣mentary
effulgence, are succeeded by thicker
darkness. Whereas compassionate affec∣tions,
even at the time when they draw
tears from our eyes for human misery,
convey satisfaction to the heart. The gra∣cious
appointment of Heaven has ordained
that sympathetic pains should always be
accompanied with a certain degree of plea∣sure;
on purpose that we might be more
<PB N="386" REF="393"/>
interested in the case of the distressed, and
that by this mysterious bond, man might
be linked closer to man. The inward sa∣tisfaction
which belongs to the compassio∣onate
affections is, at the same time, height∣ened
by the approbation which they receive
from our reason; and by the consciousness
which they afford us of feeling what men
and Christians ought to feel.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, the disposition re∣commended
in the text, not only improves
us in piety and humanity, but likewise
assists us in self-government, and the due
moderation of our desires. The house of
mourning is the school of temperance and
sobriety. Every wise man will find it for
his interest to enter into it sometimes of his
own accord, lest otherwise he be compelled
to take up his dwelling there. Seasonable in∣terruptions
of our pleasures are necessary to
their prolongation. For, continued scenes
of luxury and indulgence hasten to a me∣lancholy
issue. The house of feasting too
often becomes an avenue to the house of
<PB N="387" REF="394"/>
mourning. Short, to the licentious, is the
interval between them; and speedy the
transition from the one to the other.</P>
<P>But supposing that, by prudent manage∣ment,
the men of pleasure could avoid the
pernicious effects which intemperance and
dissoluteness are likely to produce on their
health, or their fortune, can they also pre∣vent
those disorders which such habits will
introduce into their minds? Can they
escape that wrath of the Almighty, which
will. infallibly pursue them for their sins
both here and hereafter? For whence, so
much as from the unchecked pursuit of
pleasure, do all those crimes arise which
stain the characters of men with the deepest
guilt, and expose them to the severest judg∣ments
of Heaven? Whence, then, is the
corrective of those mischiefs to be sought,
but form such a discipline as shall moderate
that intemperate admiration of the world
which gave rise to the evil? By repairing
sometimes to the house of mourning, you
would chasten the looseness of fancy, abate
the eagerness of passion, and afford scope to
<PB N="388" REF="395"/>
reason for exerting here restraining powers.
You would behold this world stripped of
its false colours, and reduced to its proper
level. Many an important instruction you
would receive from the humiliation of the
proud, the mortification of the vain, and
the sufferings of the voluptuous, which you
would see exemplified before you, in the
chambers of sorrow, of sickness, and of
death. You would then be taught <HI>to re∣joice
as though you rejoiced not, and to weep
as though you weeped not;</HI> that is, neither
in joy, nor in grief, to run to excess; but
<HI>to use this world so as not to abuse it;</HI> con∣templating
<HI>the fashion thereof as passing
away.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, you would there learn the
important lesson of suiting your mind, be∣fore-hand,
to what you had reason to ex∣pect
from the world; a lesson too seldom
studied by mankind, and to the neglect of
which, much of their misery, and much of
their guilty, is to be charged. By turning
away their eyes from the dark side of life;
by looking at the world only in one light,
<PB N="389" REF="396"/>
and that a flattering one, they form their
measures on false plan, and are necessa∣rily
deceived and betrayed. Hence, the
vexation of succeeding disappointment and
blasted hope. Hence, their criminal impa∣tience
of life, and their bitter accusations of
God and man; when, in truth, they have
reason to accuse only their own folly.—
Thou who wouldst act like a wise man, and
build thy house on the rock, and not on the
sand, contemplate human life not only in
the sunshine, but in the shade. Frequent
the house of mourning, as well as the house
of mirth. Study the nature of that state in
which thou art placed; and balance its joys
with its sorrows. Thou seest that the cup
which is held forth to the whole human
race, is mixed. Of its bitter ingredients,
expect that thou art to drink thy portion.
Thou seest the storm hovering every where
in the clouds around thee. Be not surprised
if on they head it shall break. Lower, there∣fore,
thy sails. Dismiss thy florid hopes;
and come forth prepared either to act or to
suffer, according as Heaven shall decree.
<PB N="390" REF="397"/>
Thus shalt thou be excited to take the pro∣perest
measures for defence, by endeavour∣ing
to secure an interest in His <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour, who,
<HI>in the time of trouble, can hide thee in his
pavilion.</HI> Thy mind shall adjust itself to
follow the order of his providence. Thou
shalt be enabled, with equanimity and stea∣diness,
to hold thy course through life. Fi∣nally,</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, by accustoming our∣selves
such serious views of life, our ex∣cessive
fondness for life itself will be mo∣derated,
and our minds gradually formed
to wish and to long for a better world. If
we know that our continuance here is to be
short, and that we are intended by our
Maker for a more lasting state, and for em∣ployments
of a nature altogether different
from those which now occupy the busy, or
amuse the vain, we must surely be con∣vinced,
that it is of the highest consequence
to prepare ourselves for so important a
change. This view of our duty is fre∣quently
held up to us in the sacred writings<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="391" REF="398"/>
and hence religion becomes, though not a
morose, yet a grave and solemn principle,
calling off the attention of men from light
pursuits, to those which are of eternal mo∣ment.
<HI>What is a man profited if he shall
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul;</HI>
if he shall lead a life of thoughtless mirth
on earth, and exclude himself from eternal
felicity in heaven? Worldly affection, and
sensual pleasure, depress all our higher powers.
They form an unnatural union between the
human soul and this earth, which was only
designed for its temporary abode. They
attach it too strongly to objects from which
it must shortly part. They alienate its de∣sires
from God and heaven, and deject it
with slavish and unmanly fears of death
Whereas, by the discipline of religious se∣riousness,
it is gradually loosened from the
fetters of sense. Assisted to discover the
vanity of this world, it rises above it; and
in the hours of sober thought, cultivates con∣nection
with those divine and immortal ob∣jects,
among which it is designed to dwell.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="399"/>
ENOUGH has now been said to convince
any thinking person of the justice, and rea∣sonableness,
of the maxims in the text; and
to show, that, on various occasions, <HI>sorrow</HI>
may be <HI>better than laughter.</HI> Wouldst thou
acquire the habit of recollection, and fix the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inciples of thy conduct; wouldst thou be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed up to thy Creator and Redeemer, and
be formed to sentiments of piety and devo∣tion;
wouldst thou be acquainted with those
mild and tender affections which delight the
compassionate and humane; wouldst thou
have the power of sensual appetities tamed
and corrected, and thy soul raised above the
ignoble love of life, and fear of death? Go,
my brother, go—not to scenes of pleasure
and riot, not to the house of feasting and
mirth—but to the silent house of mourn∣ing;
and adventure to dwell for a while
among objects that will soften thy heart.
Contemplate the lifeless remains of what
once was fair and flourishing. Bring home
to thyself the vicissitudes of life. Recal the
remembrance of the friend, the parent, or
the child, whom thou tenderly lovedst. Look
<PB N="393" REF="400"/>
back on the days of former years; and think
on the companions of thy youth, who now
sleep in the dust. Let the vanity, the mu∣tability,
and the sorrows of the human estate,
rise in full prospect before thee; and though
thy <HI>countenance</HI> may be <HI>made sad, thy heart
shall be made better.</HI> This sadness, though
for the present it dejects, yet shall in the
end fortify thy spirit; inspiring thee with
such sentiments, and prompting such reso∣lutions,
as shall enable thee to enjoy, with
more real advantage, the rest of life. Dis∣positions
of this nature form one part of
the character of those <HI>mourners</HI> whom our
Saviour hath pronounced <HI>blessed;</HI> and of
those to whom it is promised, that <HI>sowing
in tears they shall reap in joy</HI><NOTE N="+" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 4. Psalm cxxvi. 5.</NOTE>. A great
difference there is between being serious
and melancholy; and a melancholy too
there is of that kind which deserves to be
sometimes indulged.</P>
<P>Religion hath, on the whole, provided
for every good man abundant materials of
consolation and relief. How dark soever
<PB N="394" REF="401"/>
the present face of nature may appear, it
dispels the darkness, when it brings into
view the entire system of things, and ex∣tends
our survey to the whole kingdom of
God. It represents what we now behold
as only a part, and a small part, of the ge∣neral
order. It assures us, that though here,
for wise ends, misery and sorrow are per∣mitted
to have place, these temporary evils
shall, in the end, advance the happiness of
all who love God, and are faithful to their
duty. It shows them this mixed and con∣fused
scene vanishing by degrees away, and
preparing the introduction of that state, where
the house of mourning shall be shut up for
ever; where no tears are seen, and no
groans heard; where no hopes are frus∣trated,
and no virtuous connections dis∣solved;
but where, under the light of the
divine countenance, goodness shall flourish
in perpetual felicity. Thus, though reli∣gion
may occasionally chasten our mirth
with sadness of countenance, yet under that
sadness it allows not the hearts of good men
to sink. It calls upon them to rejoice, <HI>be∣cause
<PB N="395" REF="402"/>
the Lord reigneth who is their rock, and
the most high God who is their Redeemer.</HI>
Reason likewise joins her voice with that of
religion; forbidding us to make peevish and
unreasonable complaints of human life, or
injuriously to ascribe to it more evil than it
contains. Mixed as the present state is,
she pronounces, that generally, if not al∣ways,
there is more happiness than misery,
more pleasure than pain, in the condition
of man.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the divine GOVERNMENT of the
PASSIONS of MEN.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM lxxvi. 10.</BIBL>
<Q>Surely, the wrath of man shall praise thee;
the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Psalm appears to have been
composed on occasion of some re∣markable
delivernace obtained bythe Jewish
nation<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIV.</NOTE>. It is generally understood to have
been written in the reign of Hezekiah, and
to refer to the formidable invasion of Judaea
by Sennacherib; when the angel of the
Lord, in one night, discomfited the whole
Assyrian host, and smote them with sudden
destruction. To this interposition of the
<PB N="397" REF="404"/>
divine arm, those expressions in the context
may naturally be applied; <HI>Then brake he
the arrows of the bow, the shield, the sword,
and the battle. The stout-hearted are spoiled;
they have slept their sleep; and none of the
men of might have found their bands. At
thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot
and the horse are cast into a dead sleep.</HI> In
the text, we have the wise and religious
reflection of the Psalmist upon the violent
designs which had been carried on by the
enemies of his country, and upon the issue
to which Providence had brought them.
<HI>Surely, the wrath of man shall praise thee.</HI>
By <HI>the wrath of man,</HI> we are to understand
all that the impetuosity of human passions
can devise or execute; the projects of am∣bition
and resentment, the rage of persecu∣tion,
the fury of war; the disorders which
violence produces in private life, and the
public commotions which it excites in the
world. All these shall <HI>praise God,</HI> not with
their intention and design, nor by their na∣tive
tendency; but by those wise and good
purposes, which his providence makes them
<PB N="398" REF="405"/>
accomplish; from their poison extracting
health, and converting things which in
themselves are prenicious, into instruments
of his glory, and of public benefit: So that,
though <HI>the wrath of man worketh not the
righteousness of God,</HI> it is nevertheless forced
and compelled to minister to his praise.
The Psalmist adds, <HI>the remainder of wrath
shalt thou restrain;</HI> that is, God will allow
scope to the wrath of man as far as it an∣swers
his good purposes, and is subservient
to his praise; the rest of it shall be curbed
and bound up. When it would attempt to
go beyond its prescribed limit, the says to it,
as to the waters of the ocean, <HI>Hitherto shalt
thou come, but no further; and here shall thy
proud waves be stayed.</HI></P>
<P>All this shall be fully verified and de∣clared
by the last issue of things; when we
shall be able more clearly to trace the di∣vine
administration through its several steps,
by seeing the consummation of the; whole.
In some cases, it may be reserved for this
period, to unfold the mysterious wisdom
of Heaven. But in general, as much of
<PB N="399" REF="406"/>
the divine conduct is at present manifest,
as gives just ground for the assertion in the
text. In the sequel of this discourse, I shall
endeavour to; illustrate and confirm it. I
shall show in what manner the wrath of
man is made to praise the power, the wis∣dom,
the justice, and the goodness of God.</P>
<P>I BEGIN with this observation, That in
order to accomplish the great purposes car∣ried
on by the Government of the Universe,
it is necessary that the divine perfections be
displayed before mankind, in a sensible and
striking manner. We are not to conceive
the Supreme Being as hereby seeking praise
to lhimself, from a principle of ostentation or
vain glory. Independent and self-sufficient,
he rests in the enjoyment of his own beati∣tude.
His praise consists in the general
order and welfare of his creation. This
end cannot be attained, unless mankind be
made to feel the subjection under which
they are placed. They must be taught to
admire and adore their sovereign. They
must be overawed by the view of a high
<PB N="400" REF="407"/>
hand, which can at pleasure controul their
actions, and render them subservient to
purposes which they neither foresaw nor
intended. Hence the propriety of God's
making <HI>the wrath of man to praise him.</HI>
We easily conceive in what manner the
heavens and the earth are said to praise
God, as they are standing monuments of
that supreme perfection which is displayed
in their creation. The virtues of good
men obviously praise him, by exhibiting
his image, and reflecting back his glory.
But when even the vices and inordinate
passions of bad men are made to praise him,
in consequence of the useful purposes which
they are compelled to accomplish, this, in
particular manner, distinguishes and sig∣nalizes
a divine hand; this opens a more
wonderful prospect of the administration of
Heaven, than if all its subjects had been
loyal and willingly obedient, and the course
of human affairs had proceeded in a quiet
and regualr tenour.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="408"/>
I. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> redounds to the
praise of divine power. It brings it forth
with full and awful lustre, to the view of
mankind. To reign with sovereign com∣mand
amidst the most turbulent and disor∣dered
state of things, both in the natural
and moral world, is the peculiar glory of
omnipotence. Hence God is described in
Scripture as <HI>sitting on the flood, riding on the
wings of the wind, dwelling in the darkness
and the tempest;</HI> that is, making the most
violent powers in the universe minister to
his will, giving them scope, or restraining
them, according as suits the purposes of his
dominion. As <HI>he stills,</HI> at his pleasure, <HI>the
raging of the seas, and the noise of their
waves,</HI> in like manner, <HI>he stills the tumults
of the people.</HI> When the passions of men
are most inflamed, and their designs just
ripe for bursting into execution, often, by
some unexpected interposition, he calls
upon the world to observe that there is one
higher than the highest on earth, who can
frustrate their devices in a moment, and
command <HI>the earth to be still before him.</HI>
<PB N="402" REF="409"/>
Proud fleets, destined to carry destruction
to neighbouring kingdoms, may cover the
ocean. He blows with his wind, and they
are scattered. Mighty armies may go forth
to the field in all the glory of human
strength; but the issues of battle are with
him. He suspends on high the invisible
balance which weighs the fate of nations.
According as the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ale inclines, he gives to
some slight event the power of deciding the
contest. He clouds the sky with darkness,
or opens the windows of heaven to let
forth their flood. He dejects the hearts of
the brave with sudden terrour, and render,
the hands of the strong weak and unper∣forming,
at the critical moment. A thou∣sand
unseen ministers stand ready to be the
instruments of his power, in humbling the
pride, and checking the efforts of the wrath
of man. Thus, in the instance of haughty
Sennacherib, and that boasted tempest of
wrath which he threatened to pour upon
all the Jewish nation; <HI>I will put my hook,</HI>
says the Almighty, <HI>in thy nose, and my bridle
in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the
<PB N="403" REF="410"/>
way by which thou camest</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xix. 28.</NOTE>. In that night
the destroying angel smote the host, and
he <HI>departed with shame of face to his own
land. When the heathen rage, and the peo∣ple
imagine a vain thing; when the kings of
the erth set themselves, and its rulers take
counsel together; He that sitteth in the Hea∣vens
shall laugh; the Lord shall hold them in
derision</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm ii. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to praise
the wisdom as well as the power of God.
Nothing displays more remarkably the ad∣mirable
counsel of heaven, than its arrang∣ing
the train of events in such a manner,
that the unruly passions of the wicked shall
contribute to overthrow their own designs.
History abounds with examples of their
being rendered the unconscious ministers of
Providence, to accomplish purposes directly
opposite to those which they had in view.
Thus the cruelty of the sons of Jacob, in
pursuing the destruction of their brother
<PB N="404" REF="411"/>
Joseph, became the means of effecting his
high advancement. Thus the wrath of
Pharaoh against the Israelites, and his un∣just
attempts to detain them in bondage,
proved the occasion of bringing them forth
from the land of slavery, with signal mark<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the favour of Heaven. Thus the inhu∣man
plan which Haman had formed for
r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining Mordecai, and extirpating the
whole Jewish nation, paved the way for
Mordecai's high promotion, and for the
triumph of the Jews over all their ene∣mies.</P>
<P>After this manner the Almighty <HI>snareth
the wicked in the works of their hands;</HI> and
erects his own counsel upon the ruin of
theirs. Those events which, viewed apart,
appear as spots in the divine administration,
when considered in connection with all
their consequences, are often found to give
it additional lustre. The beauty and mag∣nificence
of the universe are much height∣ened,
by its being and extensive and compli∣cated
system; in which a variety of springs
are made to play, and a multitude of dif∣ferent
<PB N="405" REF="412"/>
movements are, with most admirable
art, regulated and kept in order. Inter∣fering
interests, and jarring passions, are in
such manner balanced against one another;
such proper checks are placed on the vio∣lence
of human pursuits; and the <HI>wrath of
man</HI> is made so to hold its course, that how
opposite soever the several motions seem to
be, yet they concur and meet at last in
one direction. While, among the multi∣tudes
that well on the face of the earth,
some are submissive to the divine authority;
some rise up in rebellion against it; others,
absorbed in their pleasures and pursuits, are
totally inattentive to it; they are all so
moved by an imperceptible influence from
above, that the zeal of the dutiful, the
wrath of the rebellious, and the indifference
of the careless, contribute finally to the
glory of God. All are governed in such a
way as suits their powers, and is consistent
with rational freedom, yet all are subjected
to the necessity of fulfilling the eternal
purposes of Heaven. This depth of di∣vine
wisdom in the administration of the
<PB N="406" REF="413"/>
universe, exceeds all human comprehen∣sion,
and affords everlasting subject of ado∣ration
and praise.</P>
<P>III. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> praises the justice
of God, by being employed as the instru∣ment
of inflicting punishment upon sinners.
Did bad men trace the course of events in
their life with attentive eye, they might
easily discover the greatest part of the dis∣asters
which they suffer to be brought upon
them by their own ungoverned passions.
The succession of causes and effects is so
contrived by Providence, that the wrath
which they meant to pour forth on others,
frequently recoils, by its effects, upon them∣slves.
But supposing them to escape those
external mischiefs which violent passions na∣turally
occasion, they cannot evade the in∣ternal
misery which they produce. The
constitution of things is framed with such
profound wisdom, that the divine laws, in
every event, execute themselves against
the sinner, and carry their sanction in their
own bosom. The Supreme Being has no
<PB N="407" REF="414"/>
occasion to unlock the prisons of the deep,
or to call down the thunder from heaven,
in order to punish the <HI>wrath of man.</HI> He
carries on the administration of justice with
more simplicity, and dignity. It is sufficient
that he allow those fierce passions which
render bad men the disturbers of others, to
operate on their own hearts. He delivers
them up to themselves, and they become
their own tormentors. Before the world
they may disguise their sufferings; but it is
well known, that to be inwardly torn with
despite, revenge and wrathful passions, is
the most intense of all misery. In thus con∣necting
the punishment with the crime,
making their <HI>own wickedness to reprove
them, and their backslidings to correct them,</HI>
the avenging hand of a righteous Gover∣nour
is conspicuous; and thus the observa∣tion
of the Psalmist is fully verified; <HI>the
wicked have drawn out their sword and
bent their bow, to c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st down the poor and
needy: but their sword shall enter into their
own heart</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxxvii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ 15.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="415"/>
The <HI>wrath of man</HI> also praises the justice
of God in the punishment of other crimi∣nals,
as well as of the wrathful themselves.
Ambitious and lawless men are let loose
upon each other, that without any supper∣natural
interposition, they may fulfil the
just vengeance of heaven in their mutual
destruction. They may occasionally be
cemented together by conspiracy against
the just; but as no firm nor lasting bond
can unite them, they become at last the
prey of mutual jealousy, strife and fraud.
For a time they may go on, and seem to
prosper. The justice of heaven may ap∣pear
to slumber; but it is awake; and only
waits till the measure of their iniquity be
full. God represents himself in Scripture
as sometimes permitting wickedness to arise
to an overgrown height, on purpose that
its ruin may be greater, and more exem∣plary.
He says to the tyrant of Egypt,
that <HI>for this cause he had raised him up,</HI> that
is, had allowed him to prosper and be ex∣alted,
<HI>that he might shew in him his power
and that his name might be declared through∣out
<PB N="409" REF="416"/>
all the earth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. ix. 16.</NOTE>. The administra∣tion
is glorified in the punishment contrived
for the workers of iniquity, as well as in
the reward prepared for the righteous. <HI>This
is the purpose which the Lord hath purposed
upon all the earth; and this is the hand that
is stretched forth over all the nations</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xiv. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IV. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to praise
the goodness of God. This is the most
unexpected of its effects; and therefore
requires to be the most fully illustrated.
All the operations of the government of the
Deity may be ultimately resolved into good∣ness.
His power, and wisdom, and justice,
all conduce to general happiness and order.
Among the means which he uses for ac∣complishing
this end, it will be found that
the wrath of man, through his over-ruling
direction, possesses a considerable place.</P>
<P>First, it is employed by God as an useful
instrument of discipline and correction to
the virtuous. The storms which ambition
and pride raise among mankind, he permits
<PB N="410" REF="417"/>
with the same intention that he sends forth
tempests among the elements; to clear the
atmosphere of noxious vapours, and to pu∣rify
it from that corruption which all things
contract by too much rest. When wicked
men prevail in their designs, and exercise
the power which they have gained with a
heavy and oppressive hand, the virtuous are
apt to exclaim, in bitterness of soul, Where
is the Lord? and where the sceptre of
righteousness and truth? <HI>Hath God forgotten
to be gracious?</HI> or doth he indeed see, and
<HI>is there knowledge in the most high?</HI>—
Their oppressors are, in truth, no more
than the ministers of God to them for good.
He sees that they stand in need of correction,
and therefore raises up enemies against them,
in order to cure the intemperance of pro∣sperity;
and to produce, in the serious
hours of affliction, proper reflections upon
their duty, and their past errours.</P>
<P>In this light the disturbers of the earth
are often represented in Scripture; as
scourges in the hand of God, employed to
inflict chastisement upon a degenerating
<PB N="411" REF="418"/>
people. They are commissioned for the
execution of righteous and wise purposes,
concealed from themselves; and when their
commission is fulfilled, they are recalled, and
destroyed. Of this we have a remarkable
example in the use which God made of the
king of Assyria, with respect to the people
of Israel. <HI>I will send him against an hypo∣critical
nation, and against the people of my
wrath will I give him a charge, to take the
spoil, and to take the prey. Howbeit, he
meaneth not so; neither doth his heart think
so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and out
off nations not a few. Wherefore it shall
come to pass, that when the Lord hath per∣formed
his whole work upon mount Zion and
on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the
stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory
of his high looks</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah x. 6, 7▪ 12.</NOTE> In vain, then, doth the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> lift itself up against God. <HI>He
saith, by the strength of my hand I have done
it, and by my wisdom, for I am prudent.
Shall the ax boast itself against him that h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w∣eth
therewith? or shall the saw magnify it∣self
<PB N="412" REF="419"/>
against him that shaketh it?</HI> All things,
whether they will it or not, must <HI>work to∣gether
for good to them that love God.</HI> The
<HI>wrath of man,</HI> among the rest, fills up the
place assigned to it by the ordination of
Heaven. The violent enemy, the proud
conqueror, and the oppressive tyrant, possess
only the same station with the famine, the
pestilence, and the flood. Their triumphs
are no more than the accomplishment of
God's correction; <HI>and the remainder of their
wrath shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e restrain.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, God makes the <HI>wrath of
man</HI> contribute to the benefit of the vir∣tuous,
by rendering it the means of im∣proving
and signalizing their graces; and of
raising them, thereby, to higher honour and
glory. Had human affairs proceeded in an
orderly train, and no opposition been made
to religion and virtue by the violence of the
wicked, what room would have been left
for some of the highest and most generou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
exertions of the soul of man? How many
shining examples of fortitude, constancy,
<PB N="413" REF="420"/>
and patience, would have been lost to the
world? What a field of virtues peculiar to
a state of discipline had lain uncultivated?
Spirits of a higher order possess a state of
established virtue, that stands in need of no
such trials and improvements. But to us▪
who are only under education for such a
state, it belongs to pass through the furnace,
that our souls may be tried, resined, and
brightened. We must stand the conflict,
that we may be graced and crowned as con∣querors.
The <HI>wrath of man</HI> opens the field
to glory; calls us forth to the most distin∣guished
exercise of active virtue, and forms
us to all those suffering graces which are
among the highest ornaments of the human
soul. It is thus, that the illustrious band of
true patriots and heroes, of confessors and
martyrs, have been set forth to the admira∣tion
of all ages, as <HI>lights of the world:</HI>
while the rage and fury of enemies, instead
of bearing them down, have only served to
exalt and dignify them more.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, the <HI>wrath of man</HI> is often
made to advance the temporal prosperity of
<PB N="414" REF="421"/>
righteous. The occasional distresses which
it brings upon them frequently lay the foun∣dation
of their future success. The vio∣lence
with which wicked men pursue their
resentment, defeats its own purpose; and
engages the world on the side of the vir∣tuous,
whom they persecute. The attempts
of malice to blacken and defame them,
bring forth their characters with more ad∣vantage,
to the view of impartial beholder.
The extremities to which they are reduced
by injustice and oppression, rouze their cou∣rage
and activity; and often give occasion
to such vigorous efforts in their just defence,
as overcome all opposition, and terminate
in prosperity and success. Even in cases
where the <HI>wrath of man</HI> appears to prevail
over the peaceable and the just, it is fre∣quently,
in its issue, converted into a bles∣sing.
How many have had reason to be
thankful, for being disappointed by their
enemies in designs which they earnestly
pursued, but which, if successfully accom∣plished,
they have afterwards seen, would
have occasioned their ruin? <HI>whoso is wise
<PB N="415" REF="422"/>
and will observe these things, even he shall
understand the loving-kindness of the Lord</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cvii. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While the <HI>wrath of man</HI> thus praises God
by the advantages which it is made to bring
to good men, as individuals, the divine hand
is equally apparent in the similar effects
wich it is appointed to produce to nations
and societies. When wars and commo∣tions
shake the earth, when factions rage,
and intestine divisions embroil kingdoms
that before were flourishing, Providence
seems, at first view, to have abandoned
public affairs to the misrule of human pas∣sions.
Yet from the midst of this confusion
order is often made to spring; and from
these mischiefs lasting advantages to arise.
By such convulsions, nations are rouzed
from that dangerous lethargy into which
flowing wealth, long peace, and growing
effeminacy of manners had suck them.
They are awakened to discern their true
interests; and taught to take proper mea∣sures
for security and defence against all
their foes. Inveterate prejudices are cor∣rected;
<PB N="416" REF="423"/>
and latent sources of danger are
discovered. Public spirit is called forth;
and larger views of national happiness are
formed. The corruptions to which every
government is liable, are often rectified by
a ferment in the political body, as noxious
humours in the animal frame are carried off
by the shock of a disease. Attempts made
against a wise and well established civil con∣stitution,
tned in the issue to strengthen it;
and the disorders of licentiousness and fac∣tion,
teach men more highly to prize the
blessings of tranquillity and legal protection.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, the <HI>wrath of man,</HI> when it
breaks forth in the persecution of religion,
praises the divine goodness, by being ren∣dered
conducive to the advancement of truth
and propagation of religion in the world.
The church of God, since the days of its
infancy, hath never been entirely exempted
from the wrath of the world; and in those
ages, during which it was most exposed to
that wrath, it hath always flourished the
most. In vain the policy and the rage of
<PB N="417" REF="424"/>
men united their efforts to extinguish this
divine light. Though all the four winds
blew against it, it only shone brighter,
and flamed higher. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Many waters could
not quench it, nor all the floods drown it.</HI>
The constancy and fortitude of those who
suffered for the truth, had a much greater
effect in increasing the number of converts,
than all the terror and cruelty of persecu∣tors,
in diminishing it. By this means, the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> was made to turn against it∣self,
to the destruction of its won purpose;
like waves, which assaulting a rock with
impotent fury, discover its immoveable sta∣bility,
while they dash themselves in pieces
at its feet.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add one other instance of
the <HI>wrath of man</HI> praising God, by accom∣plishing
ends of most extensive benefit to
mankind. Never did the rage and malice
of the wicked imagine that they had ob∣tained
a more complete triumph, than in
the death of Jesus Christ. When they had
executed their purpose of making him suffer
<PB N="418" REF="425"/>
as a malefactor, they were confident that
they had extinguished his name, and dis∣comfited
his followers for ever. Behold
how feeble are the efforts of the wrath of
man against the decree of Heaven! All
that they intended to overthrow, they most
effectually established. The death of Christ
was, in the counsels of Heaven, the spring of
everlasting life to the faithful. The cross
of everlasting life to the faithful. The cross
on which he suffered with apparent igno∣miny,
became the standard of eternal honour
to him; the ensign under which his fol∣lowers
assembled, and triumphed. He who,
at his pleasure, <HI>restrains the remainder of
wrath,</HI> suffered the rage of our Saviour's
enemies to suggest no other things to them
than what, long before, He had determined,
and his prophets had foretold. They all
conspired to render the whole scene of
Christ's sufferings exactly conformable to
the original, predicted plan of divine mercy
and goodness; and each of them contri∣buted
his share to accomplish that great un∣dertaking,
which none of them in the least
understood, nor meant to promote.—So
<PB N="419" REF="426"/>
remarkable an instance as this, fully ascer∣tained
in Scripture, of the <HI>wrath of man</HI>
ministering to the designs of Heaven, ought
to be frequently in our eye; as an exem∣plification
of the conduct of Providence in
many other cases, where we have not so
much light afforded us for tracing its ways.</P>
<P>By this induction of particulars, the doc∣trine
contained in the text is plainly and
fully verified. We have seen, that the dis∣orders
which the pride and passions of men
occaison if the world, though they take rise
from the corruption of human nature in
this fallen state, yet are so overruled by Pro∣vidence,
as to redound to His honour and
glory who governs all. They illustrate be∣fore
the world the divine perfections in the
administration of the universe. They serve
the puroses of moral and religious im∣provement
to the souls of men. By a secret
tendency, they advance the welfare of those
whom they appear to threaten with evil.
<HI>Surely, O God! the wrath of man shall praise
thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou re∣strain.</HI>
<PB N="420" REF="427"/>
—In thy hand it is; and thou never
lettest it forth but in weight and measure.
It is wild and intractable in its nature; but
Thou tamest it. It is blind and headlong
in its impulse; but Thou directest it. It
struggles continually to break its chain; but
Thou confinest it; Thou retrenchest all the
superfluity of its fury.—Let us now con∣sider,
what improvement is to be made of this
meditation on the ways of Providence.</P>
<P>IN the first place, let it lead us to a reli∣gious
contemplation of the hand of God
in all the transactions of the world. In the
ordinary course of human affairs, we be∣hold
a very mixed and busy scene; the
passions of men variously agitated, and new
changes daily taking place upon this stage
of time. We behold peace and war alter∣nately
returning; the fortunes of private
men rising and falling; and states and na∣tions
partaking of the same vicissitude. In
all this, if we attend only to the operation
of external causes, and to the mere rotation
of events, we view no more than the ina∣nimate
<PB N="421" REF="428"/>
part of nature; we stop at the sur∣face
of things; we contemplate the great
spectacle which is presented to us, not with
the eyes of rational and intelligent beings.
The life and beauty of the universe arises
from the view of that wisdom and goodness
which animates and conducts the whole,
and unites all the parts in one great de∣sign.
There is an eternal mind who puts
all those wheels in motion; himself remain∣ing
for ever at rest. Nothing is void of
God. Even in the passions and ragings of
men, He is to be found; and where they
imagine they guide themselves, they are
guided and controuled by his hand. What
solemn thoughts and devout affections ought
this meditation to inspire; when in view∣ing
the affairs of the world, we attend not
merely to the actings of men, but to the
ways of God; and consider ourselves, and
all our concerns, as included in is high
administration!</P>
<P>IN the second place, the doctrine which
has been illustrated should prevent us from
<PB N="422" REF="429"/>
censuring Providence, on account of any
seeming disorders and evils which at present
take place in the world. The various in∣stances
which have been pointed out in this
discourse, of human passion and wickedness
rendered subservient to wise and useful ends,
give us the highest reason to conclude that,
in all other cases of seeming evil, the like
ends are carried on. This ought to satisfy
our mind, even when the prospect is most
dark and discouraging. The plans of di∣vine
wisdom are too large and comprehen∣sive
to be discerned by us in all their extent;
and where we see only by parts, we must
frequently be at a loss in judging of the
whole. <HI>The way of God is in the sea and
his path in the great waters; his footsteps are
not known</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxxvii. 19.</NOTE>. <HI>But although thou sayest thou
canst not see him, yet judgment is before him;
therefore trust thou in him</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job, xxxv. 14.</NOTE> As in the
natural world, no real deformity is found,
nothing but what has either some orna∣ment,
or some use; so in the moral world,
<PB N="423" REF="430"/>
the most irregular and deformed appear∣ances
contribute in one way or other to the
order of the whole. The Supreme Being,
from the most opposite and disagreeing
principles, forms universal concord; and
adapts even the most harsh and dissonant
notes to the harmony of his praise. As he
hath reared the goodly frame of nature
from various and jarring elements, and
hath settled it in peace; so he hath formed
such an union by his providence of the
more various interests, and more jarring
passions of men, that they all conspire to
his glory, and co-operate for general good.
—How amazing is that wisdom, which
comprehends such infinite diversities, and
contrarieties, within its scheme! How pow∣erful
that hand, which bends to its own
purpose the good and the bad, the busy
and the idle, the friends and the foes of
truth; which obliges them all to hold on
their course to his glory, though divided
from one another by a multiplicity of pur∣suits,
and differing often from themselves;
and while they all move at their own free∣dom,
<PB N="424" REF="431"/>
yet by a secret influence, winds and
turns them at his will! <HI>O the depth of the
riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of
God! How unsearchable are his judgments,
and his ways past finding out</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 33.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>IN the third place, we see, from what
has been said, how much reason there is
for submission to the decrees of Heaven.
Whatever distresses we suffer from the
<HI>wrath of man,</HI> we have ground to believe
that they befall not in vain. In the midst
of human violence, or oppression, we are
not left to be the sport of fortune. Higher
counsels are concerned. Wise and good
designs are going on. God is always car∣rying
forward his own purposes; and if
these terminate in his glory, which is ever
the same with felicity of the righteous,
is not this a sufficient reason for our calm
and chearful acquiescence?</P>
<P>Hence also, to conclude, arises the most
powerful argument for studying, with zeal∣ous
asis;duity, to gain the favour and pro∣tection
<PB N="425" REF="432"/>
of the Almighty. If his displeasure
hang over our heads, all things around us
may be just objects of terrour. For against
him, there is no defence. The most violent
powers in nature are ministers to him.
Formidable, indeed, may prove the <HI>wrath
of man,</HI> if he be pleased to let it forth
against us. To him, but not to us, it be∣longs
to restrain it at pleasure. Whereas,
when we are placed under his protection,
all human wrath is divested of its terrours.
<HI>If he be for us, who</HI> or what <HI>can be against
us?</HI> Let us pursue the measures which he
hath appointed for obtaining his grace by
faith, repentance and a holy life, and we
shall have no reason to be <HI>afraid of evil
tidings; our hearts will be fixed trusting in
the Lord.</HI> When the religious fear of God
possesses the heart, it expe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the ignoble
fear of man; and becomes the principle of
courage and magnanimity. The Lord is
<HI>a buckler and a shield</HI> to them that serve
him. <HI>When he ariseth, his enemies shall be
scattered, as smoke is driven away, and as
chaff before the wind. He giveth strength
<PB N="426" REF="433"/>
and victory to his people; he cloatheth them
with salvation. The wrath of man shall
praise him; and the remainder of wrath shall
be restrain.</HI></P>

Christian Knowledge.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ISAIAH xi. 9.</BIBL>
<Q>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
mountain; for the earth shall be full of the
knowledge of the Lord, as the water co∣ver
the sea.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS passage of Scripture is under∣stood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XV.</NOTE>
by all Christian interpreters, to
refer to the days of the Gospel. The Pro∣phet
describes, in the context, the auspi∣cious
influence of the Messiah's reign, as
<PB N="428" REF="435"/>
extending over all nature, and producing
universal felicity. The full accomplish∣ment
of this prediction is yet future, and
respects some more advanced period of the
kingdom of God, when true religion shall
universally prevail, and the native tendency
of the Gospel attain its entire effect. In
the prospect of this event, the Prophet
seems to rise above himself, and celebrates
that happy age in the most sublime strain
of eastern poetry. He opens a beautiful
view of the state of the world, as a state of
returning innocence. He represents all
nature flourishing in peace; discord and
guile abolished; the most hostile natures
reconciled, and the most savage, reformed
and tamed. <HI>The wolf shall dwell with the
lamb, and the leopard lie down with the
kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the
fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling together, and a little child shall lead
them. The lion shall eat straw like the ox:
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of
the asp, and the weaned child shall put his
hand on the cockatrice deu. They shall not
hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain;
<PB N="429" REF="436"/>
for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of
the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</HI></P>
<P>Upon reading these words, we must im∣mediately
perceive the great encouragement
which they give to all good designs for pro∣moting
religion in the world. When we
engage in these, we have the comfort of
being engaged, not only in a good cause,
but also in one that shall undoubtedly be
successful. For we are here assured by the
divine promise, that truth and righteousness
shall at length prevail, and that the in∣creasing
influence of religion shall introduce
general happiness. It is a pleasing and ani∣mating
reflection, that in carrying on such
designs, we act upon the divine plan; and
co-operate with God for advancing the
kingdom of the Messiah. We have no rea∣son
to be discouraged by any unfavourable
circumstances which at present oppose our
pious endeavours. Though the ignorance,
superstition, and corruption, which now fill
so great a part of the world, have a dark
any mysterious aspect, it is not beyond the
power of that Supreme Being who brings
<PB N="430" REF="437"/>
light out of darkness, to clear up those per∣plexing
appearances, and gradually to ex∣tricate
mankind from the labyrinth of ig∣norance
and errour. Let us consider how
improbable it seemed, when the gospel was
first published, that it should extend so far,
and overthrow so much established supersti∣tion,
as it has already done. There is no∣thing,
in the present state of the world, to
render it more unlikely that it shall one day
be universally received, and prevail in its
full influence. At the rise of Christianity,
the disproportion was, at least, as great,
between the apparent human causes, and
the effect which has actually been produced,
as there is, in our age, between the circum∣stances
of religion in the world, and the
effect which we farther expect. <HI>The Sun
of righteousness</HI> having already exerted its
influence in breaking through the thickest
darkness, we may justly hope, that it is
powerful enough to dispel all remaining
obscurity; and that it will ascend by de∣grees
to that perfect day, when <HI>healing shall
be under its wings</HI> to all the nations. <HI>A
<PB N="431" REF="438"/>
little one shall become a thousand; and a small
one, a strong nation. I the Lord will hasten
it in its time</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lx. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BESIDES the prediction which the text
contains of the future success of religion,
it points out also a precise connection be∣tween
the increase of religious knowledge,
and the happiness of mankind. <HI>The know∣ledge
of the Lord filling the earth,</HI> is assigned
as the cause why <HI>they shall not hurt nor de∣stroy
in all the holy mountain of God.</HI> To
this I am not to lead your thoughts; as
a subject both suited to the occasion of the
present meeting, and proper to be illustrated
in times, wherein total indifference to reli∣gious
principles appears to gain ground.
Whether Christianity shall be propagated
farther or not, is treated as a matter of no
great concern to mankind. The opinion
prevails among many, that moral virtue
may subsist, with equal advantage, in∣dependent
of religion. For moral princi∣ples,
great regard is professed; but articles
<PB N="432" REF="439"/>
of religious belief are held to be abstract
tenets, remote from life; points of mer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
speculation and debate, the influence of
which is very inconsiderable of the actions
of men. Their general conduct, it is con∣tended,
will always proceed upon views
and principles which have more relation to
the present state of things; and religious
knowledge can therefore stand in no neces∣sary
conncetion with their happiness and
prosperity.—How adverse such opinions
are both to the profession and practice of
religion, is abundantly evident. How ad∣verse
they are to the general welfare and
real interests of mankind, I hope to make
appear to candid minds.</P>
<P>By <HI>the knowledge of the Lord</HI> in the text,
is not to be understood the natural know∣ledge
of God only. It is plain, that the
Prophet speaks of the age of the Messiah,
when more enlarged discoveries should be
made to mankind of the diving perfections
and government, than unassisted reason
could attain. <HI>The knowledge of the Lord,</HI>
therefore, comprehends the principles of
<PB N="433" REF="440"/>
Christianity, as well as of natural religion.
In order to discern the importance of such
knowledge to general happiness, we shall
consider man, I. as an individual; II. as a
member of society.</P>
<P>I. CONSIDERING man as an individual,
let us inquire, how far the knowledge of
true religion is important, first, to his im∣provement;
next, to his consolation.</P>
<P>FIRST, with respect to the improvement
of man; the advancement of his nature in
what is valuable and useful, the acquisition
of such dispositions and habits as fit him for
acting his part with propriety of this stage,
and prepare him for a higher state of action
hereafter; what benefit does he receive, in
these respects, from religious knowledge and
belief? It is obvious, that all increase of
knowledge is improvement to the under∣standing.
The more that its sphere is en∣larged,
the greater number of objects that
are submitted to its view, especially when
these objects are of intrinsic excellence, the
<PB N="434" REF="441"/>
more must those rational powers, which are
the glory of man, be in the course of attain∣ing
their proper strength and maturity.
But were the knowledge of religion merely
speculative, though the speculation must be
admitted to be noble, yet less could be said
of its importance. We recommend it to
mankind, as forming the heart, and direct∣ing
the life. Those pure and exalted con∣ceptions
which the Christian religion has
taught us to entertain of the Deity, as the
universal Father and righteous Governour
of the universe, the standard of unspotted
perfection, and <HI>the author of every good and
perfect gift;</HI> conducting his whole admini∣stration
with an eternal regard to order,
virtue, and truth; ever favouring the cause
and supporting the interests of righteous
men; and applying, in this direction, the
whole might of omnipotence, and the whole
counsel of unerring wisdom, from the be∣ginning
to the end of things; such con∣ceptions
both kindle devotion, and strengthen
virtue. They give fortitude to the mind in
the practice of righteousness, and establish
<PB N="435" REF="442"/>
the persuasion of its being our highest in∣terest.</P>
<P>All the doctrines peculiar to the Gospel
are great improvements on what the light
of nature had imperfectly suggested. A
high dispensation of Providence is made
known, particularly suited to the exigencies
of man; calculated for recovering him from
that corrupted state into which experience
bears witness that he is fallen, and for re∣storing
him to integrity, and favour with his
Creator. The method of carrying on this
great plan is such as gives us the most
strinking views of the importance of righteous∣ness
or virtue, and of the high account in
which it stands with God. The Son of
God appeared on the earth, and suffered as
a propitiation for the sins of the world,
with this express intention, that he might
<HI>bring in everlasting righteousness;</HI> that he
might <HI>purge our consciences from dead works
to serve the living God;</HI> that he might <HI>re∣deem
us from all iniquity, and purify unto
himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
works.</HI> Such a merciful interposition of
<PB N="436" REF="443"/>
the Creator of the world, while it illus∣triously
displays his goodness, and signalizes
his concern for the moral interests of man∣kind,
affords us, at the same time, the most
satisfying ground of confidence and trust.
It offers an object to the mind, on which it
can lay hold for the security of its future
hopes; when, with a certainty far beyond
what any abstract argument could yield, it
appeals to a distinguished fact; and is
enabled to say, <HI>He that spared not his own
Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
shall be not with him also freely give us all
things</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 32.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>While the divine Government is thus
placed in a light the most amiable, and most
encouraging to every virtuous mind, there
is, at the same time, something extremely
awful and solemn in the whole doctrine of
redemption. It is calculated to strike the
mind with reverence for the divine admi∣nistration.
it points at some deep malignity
in sin, at some dreadful consequences flow∣ing
from guilt, unknown in their causes
<PB N="437" REF="444"/>
and in their whole effects to us, which
moved the Sovereign of the World to de∣part
from the ordinary course of Providence,
and to bring about the restoration of his
fallen creatures by a method so astonishing.
Mankind are hereby awakened to the most
serious reflections. Such views are opened
of the sanctity of the divine laws, of the
strictness of the divine justice, of the im∣portance
of the part which is assigned them
to act, as serve to prevent their trifling with
human life, and add dignity and solemnity
to virtue. These great purposes are farther
carried on, by the discovery which is made
of the fixed connection in which this life
stands with a future eternal state. We are
represented as <HI>sowing now, what we are to
reap</HI> hereafter; undergoing a course of pro∣bation
and trial, which, according as it ter∣minates
in our improvement, or leaves us
unreformed and corrupted, will dismiss us
to lasting abodes, either of punishment or
reward. Such a discovery rises far above
the dubious conjectures, and uncertain rea∣sonings,
which mere natural light suggests
<PB N="438" REF="445"/>
concerning the future condition of man∣kind.
Here we find, what alone can pro∣duce
any considerable influence on practice,
explicit promise and threatening; an autho∣ritative
sanction given to a law; the Gover∣nour
and Judge revealed; and all the mo∣tives
which can operate on hope and fear,
brought home to the heart, with <HI>Thus saith
the Lord of Hosts.</HI> In a word, a great and
magnificent plan of divine administration is
opened to us, in the Gospel of Christ; and
nothing is omitted that can impress man∣kind
with the persuasion of their being all,
in the strictest sense, subjects of the moral
government of God.</P>
<P>THOUGH the bounds of this Discourse
allow us to take only an imperfect view of
the principles of Christian doctrine, yet the
hints which have been given lay a suffi∣cient
foundation for appealing to every im∣partial
mind, whether the knowledge and
belief of such principles be not intimately
connected with the improvement, and, by
consequence, with the happiness of man.
<PB N="439" REF="446"/>
I reason now with such as admit, that virtue
is the great source both of improvement
and happiness. Let them lay what stress
they please upon the authority of conscience,
and upon the force and evidence of its dic∣tates;
can they refuse to allow, that the
natural tendency of the principles which I
have mentioned, is to support those dictates,
and to confirm that authority; to excite,
on various occasions, the most useful senti∣ments;
to provide additional restraints from
vice, and additional motives to every virtue?
Who dares pronounce, that there is no case
in which conscience, stands in need of such
assistance, to direct, where there is so much
uncertainty and darkness; and to prompt,
where there is so much feebleness and irre∣solution,
and such a fatal proneness to vice
and folly?</P>
<P>But how good soever the tendency of
religious principles may be, some will still
call in question their actual significancy,
and influence on life. This tendency is
by various causes defeated. Between the
belief of religious principles and a corre∣spondent
<PB N="440" REF="447"/>
practice, it will be alleged that
frequent experience shews there is no ne∣cessary
connection; and that therefore the
propagation of the one, cannot give us any
assurance of proportionable improvements
following in the other.—This, in part, is
granted to be true; as we admit that reli∣gious
knowledge and belief are susceptible
of various degrees, before they arrive at that
real christian Faith which the Scripture re∣presents
as <HI>purifying the heart.</HI> But though
the connection between principle and prac∣tice
be not necessary and invariable, it will
not, I suppose, be denied that there is some
connection. Here then one avenue to the
heart is opened. If the tendency of reli∣gious
knowledge be good, wisdom must
direct, and duty oblige us to cultivate it.
For tendency will, atleast in some cases,
rise into effect and, probably, in more
cases than are known and observed by the
world. Besides the distinguished examples
of true religion and virtue which have, more
or less, adorned every age of the Christian
aera, what numbers may there be, in the
<PB N="441" REF="448"/>
more silent and private scenes of life, over∣looked
by superficial observers of mankind,
on whose hearts and lives religious princi∣ples
have the most happy influence? Even
on loose and giddy minds, where they are
far from operating their full effect, their
influence is, frequently, not altogether lost.
Impressions of religion often cheek vice in
its career. They prevent it from proceed∣ing
its utmost length; and though they do
not entirely reform the offender, they serve
to maintain order in society. Persons who
are now bad, might probably have been
worse without them, and the world have
suffered more from unrestrained licentious∣ness.
They often sow latent seeds of good∣ness
in the heart, which proper circum∣stances
and occasions afterwards ripen;
though the reformation of the offender may
not be so conspicuous, as his former enor∣mities
have been. From the native ten∣dency
of religious belief, there is reason to
conclude, that those good effects of it are
not so rare as some would represent them.
By its nature and tendency, we can better
<PB N="442" REF="449"/>
judge of its effects, than by observations
drawn from a supposed experience, which
often is narrow in its compass, and falla∣cious
in its conclusions.</P>
<P>The actual influence of principle and be∣lief
on mankind, admits of clear illustration
from uncontested matter of fact. They
who hold the good effects of Christian prin∣ciples
to be so inconsiderable, as to render
the propagation of them of small import∣ance,
will be at no loss to give us instances
of corrupt principles of belief having had
the most powerful influence on the world.
Loud complaints we hear from this quarter,
of the direful effects which superstition and
enthusiasm have produced; of their having
poisoned the tempers, and transformed the
manners of men; of their having over∣come
the strongest restraints of law, of rea∣son,
and humanity. Is this then the case
that all principles, except good ones, are of
such mighty energy?—Strange! that false
religion should be able to do so much, and
true religion so little; that belief, so pow∣erful
in the one case, should be so impo∣tent
<PB N="443" REF="450"/>
in the other.—No impartial enquirer,
surely, can entertain this opinion. The
whole history of mankind shows that their
religious tenets and principles, of whatever
nature they be, are of great influence in
forming their character, and directing their
conduct. The mischief which false prin∣ciples
have done, affords a good argument
to guard carefully against errour; but as it
is a proof of what belief can do, it gives
ground to hope the more from it, when
rightly directed. The same torrent which,
when it is put out of its natural course,
overflows and lays waste a country, adorns
and enriches it, when running in its pro∣per
channel. If it be alleged that super∣stition
is likely to be more powerful in its
effects than truth, because it agrees better
with the follies and corruptions of the
world, we may oppose to this on the other
hand, that truth has the divine blessing and
the countenance of Heaven on its side.
Let us always hope well of a cause that is
good in itself, and beneficial to mankind.
Truth is mighty, and will prevail. Let us
<PB N="444" REF="451"/>
spread the <HI>incorruptible seed</HI> as widely as
we can, and trust in God that he will give
the increase. Having thus shown the im∣portance
of religious knowledge to man∣kind
in the way of improvement, let us,</P>
<P>IN the second place, consider it in the
light of consolation; as bringing aid and
relief to us amidst the distresses of life.
Here religion incontestably triumphs; and
its happy effects in this respect, furnish a
strong argument to every benevolent mind
for wishing them to be farther diffused
throughout the world. For without the
belief and hope afforded by divine Reve∣lation,
the circumstances of a man are ex∣tremely
forlorn. He finds himself placed
here as a stranger in a vast universe, where
the powers and operations of nature are
very imperfectly known; where both the
beginnings and the issues of things are in∣volved
in mysterious darkness; where he
is unable to discover, with any certainty,
whence he sprung, or for what purpose he
was brought into this state of existence;
<PB N="445" REF="452"/>
whether he be subjected to the government
of a mild, or of a wrathful ruler; what con∣struction
he is to put on many of the dis∣pensations
of his providence; and what his
fate is to be when he departs hence. What
a disconsolate situation, to a serious enquir∣ing
mind! The greater degree of virtue it
possesses, its sensibility is likely to be the
more oppressed by this burden of labouring
thought. Even though it were in one's
power to banish all uneasy thought, and to
fill up the hours of life with perpetual
amusement, life so filled up would, upon
reflection, appear poor and trivial. But
these are far from being the terms upon
which man is brought into this world. He
is conscious that his being is frail and fee∣ble;
he sees himself beset with various
dangers; and is exposed to many a me∣lancholy
apprehension, from the evils
which he may have to encounter, before he
arrives at the close of life. In this distressed
condition, to reveal to him such discoveries
of the Supreme Being as the Christian reli∣gion
affords, is to reveal to him a Father
<PB N="446" REF="453"/>
and a Friend; is to let in a ray of the most
cheering light upon the darkness of the hu∣man
estate. He who was before a desti∣tute
orphan, wandering in the inhospitable
desert, has now gained a shelter from the
bitter and inclement blast. He now knows
to whom to pray, and in whom to trust;
where to unbosom his sorrows; and from
what hand to look for relief.</P>
<P>It is certain, that when the heart bleeds
from some wound of recent misfortune,
nothing is of equal efficacy with religious
comfort. It is of power to enlighten the
darkest hour, and to asswage the severest
woe, by the belief of divine favour, and
the prospect of a blessed immortality. In
such hopes, the mind expatiates with joy;
and when bereaved of its earthly friends,
solaces itself with the thoughts of one friend
who will never forsake it. Resined rea∣sonings
concerning the nature of the hu∣man
condition, and the improvement which
philosophy teaches us to make of every
event, may entertain the mind when it is
at ease; may perhaps contribute to sooth
<PB N="447" REF="454"/>
it, when slightly touched with sorrow.
But when it is torn with any sore distress,
they are cold and feeble, compared with a
direct promise from the word of God.
This is <HI>an anchor to the soul both sure and
stedfast.</HI> This has given consolation and
refuge to many a virtuous heart, at a time
when the most cogent reasonings would
have proved utterly unavailing.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of death, especially,
when if man thinks at all, his anxiety
about his future interests must naturally in∣crease,
the power of religious consolation is
sensibly felt. Then appears, in the most
striking light, the high value of the disco∣veries
made by the Gospel; not only life
and immortality revealed, but a mediator
with God discovered; mercy proclaimed,
through him, to the frailties of the penitent
and the humble; and his presence pro∣mised
to be with them when they are pass∣ing
through <HI>the valley of the shadow of
death,</HI> in order to bring them safe into un∣seen
habitations of rest and joy. Here is
ground for their leaving the world with
<PB N="448" REF="455"/>
comfort and peace. But in this severe and
trying period, this labouring hour of na∣ture,
how shall the unhappy man support
himself, who knows not, or believes not,
the hope of religion? Secretly conscious
to himself that he has not acted his part as
he ought to have done, the sins of his past
life arise before him in sad remembrance.
He wishes to exist after death, and yet
dreads that existence. The Governour of
the world is unknown. He cannot tell
whether every endeavour to obtain his
mercy may not be in vain. All is awful
obscurity around him; and in the midst of
endless doubts and perplexities, the trem∣bling,
reluctant soul, is forced away from
the body. As the missortunes of life must,
to such a man, have been most oppressive,
so its end is bitter. His sun sets in a dark
cloud; and the night of death closes over
his head, full of misery.—Having now
shewn how important <HI>the knowldege of the
Lord</HI> is, both to the improvement and the
consolation of man, considered as an indi∣vidual,
I am next to shew,</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="456"/>
II. How important this knowledge is to
him as a member of society. This branch
of the subject is in part anticipated by what
has been said. For all the improvement
which man receives as an individual, re∣dounds
to the benefit of the public. Society
reaps the fruit of the virtues of all the
members who compose it; and in propor∣tion
as each, apart, is made better, the
whole must flourish.</P>
<P>But besides this effect, religious know∣ledge
has a direct tendency to improve the
social intercourse of men, and to assist them
in co-operating for common good. It is
the great instrument of civilizing the mul∣titude,
and forming them to union. It
tames the fierceness of their passions, and
softens the rudeness of their manners.
There is much reason to doubt whether
any regular society ever subsisted, or could
subsist, in the world, destitute of all reli∣gious
ideas and principles. They who, in
early times, attempted to bring the wander∣ing
and scattered tribes of men from the
woods, and to unite them in cities and
<PB N="450" REF="457"/>
communities, always found it necessary to
begin with some institution of religion.
The wisest legislators of old, through the
whole progress of their systems of govern∣ment,
considered religion as effential to civil
polity. If even those imperfect forms of
it, loaded with so much superstition and
errour, were important to the welfare of
society, how much more that reasonable
worship of the true God, which is taught
by the Gospel? True religion introduces
the idea of regular subjection, by accus∣toming
mankind to the awe of superiour
power in the Deity, joined with the vene∣ration
of superiour wisdom and goodness.
It is by its nature an associating principle;
and creates new and sacred bonds of union
among men. Common assemblies for reli∣gious
worship, and joint homage offered
up to one God; the sense of being all de∣pendent
on the same protection, and bound
to duty by the same ties, sharers in the
same benefits of heaven, and expectants of
the same reward, tend to awaken the sen∣timents
of friendly relation, and to con∣firm
<PB N="451" REF="458"/>
firm and strengthen our mutual connexion.
The doctrine of Christianity is most adverse
to all tyranny and oppression, but highly
favourable to the interests of good govern∣ment
among men. It represses the spirit
of licentiousness and sedition. It inculcates
the duty of subordination to lawful supe∣riours.
It requires us <HI>to fear God, to ho∣nour
the king, and not to meddle with them
that are given to change.</HI></P>
<P>Religious knowledge forwards all useful
and ornamental improvements in society.
Experience shows, that in proportion as it
diffuses its light, learning flourishes, and
liberal arts are cultivated and advanced.
Just conceptions of religion promote a free
and manly spirit. They lead men to think
for themselves; to form their principles
upon fair inquiry, and not to resign their
conscience to the dictates of men. Hence
they naturally inspire aversion to slavery of
every kind; and promote a taste for liberty
and laws. Despotic governments have ge∣nerally
taken the firmest root among nations
that were blinded by Mahometan or Pagan
<PB N="452" REF="459"/>
darkness; where the throne of violence has
been supported by ignorance and salse reli∣gion.
In the Christian world, during those
centuries in which gorss superstition held its
reign undisturbed, oppression and slavery
were in its train. The cloud of ignorance
sat thick and deep over the nations; and
the world was threatened with a relapse into
ancient harbarity. As soon as the true
<HI>knowledge of the Lord</HI> revived, at the auspi∣cious
aera of the Reformation, learning, li∣berty,
and arts, began to shine forth with it,
and to resume their lustre.</P>
<P>But the happy influence which religion
exerts on society, extends much farther than
to effects of this kind. It is not only sub∣sidiary
to the improvement, but necessary to
the preservation of society. It is the very
basis on which it rests. Religious prin∣ciple
is what gives men the surest hold of
one another. That last and greatest pledge
of veracity, an oath, without which no so∣ciety
could subsist, derives its whole autho∣rity
from an established reverence of God,
to whom it is a solemn appeal. Banish re∣ligious
<PB N="453" REF="460"/>
principle, and you loosen all the
bonds which connect mankind together;
you shake the fundamental pillar of mutual
confidence and trust; you render the secu∣rity
arising from laws, in a great measure,
void and ineffectual. For human laws, and
human sanctions, cannot extend to number∣less
cases, in which the safety of mankind
is deeply concerned. They would prove
very feeble instruments of order and peace,
if there were no cheeks upon the conduct of
men from the sense of divine legislation; if
no belief of future rewards and punishments
were to overawe conscience, and to supply
the defects of human government.</P>
<P>Indeed, the belief of religion is of such
importance to public welfare, that the most
expressive description we could give of a
society of men in the utmost disorder, would
be to say, that there was no fear of God
left among them. Imagination would im∣mediately
conceive of them as abandoned to
rapine and violence, to persidy and treachery;
as deceiving and deceived, oppressing and
oppressed; consumed by intestine broils,
<PB N="454" REF="461"/>
and ripe for becoming a prey to the first
invader. On the other hand, in order to
form the idea of a society flourishing in its
highest glory, we need only conceive the
belief of Christian principles exerting its full
influence on the hearts and lives of all the
members. Instantly, the most amiable scene
would open to our view. We should see
the causes of public disunion removed, when
men were animated with that noble spirit of
love and charity which our religion breathes;
and formed to the pursuit of those higher
interests, which give no occasion to compe∣tition
and jealousy. We should see families,
neighbourhoods, and communities, living in
unbroken amity, and pursuing, with one
heart and mind, the common interest; so∣briety
of manners, and simplicity of life,
restored; virtuous industry carrying on its
useful labours, and cheerful contentment
every where reigning. Politicians may lay
down what plans they please for advancing
public prosperity; but, in truth, it is the
prevalency of such principles of religion and
virtue, which forms the strength and glory
<PB N="455" REF="462"/>
of a nation. When these are totally want∣ing,
no measures contrived by human wis∣dom
can supply the defect. In proportion
as they prevail, they raise the state of society
from that sad degeneracy into which it is at
present sunk; and carry it forward, under
the blessing of Heaven, towards that happy
period, when <HI>nation shall not lift up their
sword against nation, nor learn war any
more.</HI></P>
<P>In order to prove the importance of reli∣gious
knowledge to the interest of society,
one consideration more, deserving particu∣lar
attention, remains to be mentioned. It
is, that if <HI>good seed</HI> be not sown in the field,
<HI>tares</HI> will infallibly spring up. The pro∣pension
towards religion is strong in the
human heart. There is a natural prepa∣ration
in our minds, for receiving some im∣pressions
of supernatural belief. Upon
these, among ignorant and uncultivated
men, superstition or enthusiasm never fail
to graft themselves. Into what monstrous
forms these have shot forth, and what va∣rious
mischiefs they have produced to so∣ciety
<PB N="456" REF="463"/>
is too well known. Nor is this the
whole of the danger. Designing men are
always ready to take advantage of this po∣pular
weakness, and to direct the supersti∣tious
bias of the multitude to their own am∣bitious
and interested ends. Superstition,
in itself a formidable evil, threatens conse∣quences
still more formidable, when it is
rendered the tool of design and craft. Hence
arises one of the most powerful arguments
for propagating with zeal, as far as our in∣fluence
can extend, the pure and undesiled
doctrines of the Gospel of Christ; in order
that just and rational principles of religion
may fill up that room in the minds of men,
which dangerous fanaticism will otherwise
usurp.</P>
<P>This consideration alone is sufficient to
show the high utility of the design under∣taken
by the Society for propagating Chris∣tian
Knowledge. With great propriety,
they have bestowed their chief attention on
a remote quarter of our own country, where,
from a variety of causes, ignorance and su∣perstition
had gained more ground, than in
<PB N="457" REF="464"/>
any other corner of the land; where the
inhabitants, by their local situation, were
more imperfectly supplied with the means
of proper education and instruction; and at
the same time exposed to the seductions of
such as sought to pervert them from the
truth. The laudable endeavours of the
Society in diffusing religious and useful
knowledge through this part of the country,
have already been crowned with much suc∣cess;
and more is still to be expected from
the continuance of their pious and well-directed
attention.</P>
<P>With such good designs, it becomes all
to co-operate, who are lovers of mankind.
Thus shall they show their just sense of the
value of that blessing which they enjoy, in
the knowledge of the Gospel of Christ;
and their gratitude to Heavan for confer∣ring
it upon them. Thus shall they make
the blessings of those who are now ready
to <HI>perish through lack of knowledge,</HI> descend
upon their heads. Thus shall they contri∣bute
their endeavours for bringing forward
that happy period foretold by ancient pro∣phecy;
<PB N="458" REF="465"/>
when <HI>there shall be one Lord over
all the earth, and his name one;</HI> when that
<HI>name shall be great from the rising to the set∣ting
sun;</HI> when <HI>there shall be nothing to hurt
nor destroy in all the holy mountain of God;</HI>
but <HI>judgment shall dwell in the wilderness,
and righteousness remain in the fruitful field;
the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose;</HI>
and <HI>the earth shall be full of the knowledge
of the Lord as the waters cover the sea</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zechar. xiv. 9. Malachi i. 11. Isaiah xxxii. 16 xxxv. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
