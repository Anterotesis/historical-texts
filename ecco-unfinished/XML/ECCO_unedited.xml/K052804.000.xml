<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>TO our late Troubles the Publick is in∣debted
for the following Papers, if they
are of Value to create a Debt. After many
disconsolate Hours, the Author took Courage
to apply himself to some Study, which might
divert him from brooding over the Distresses
of his Country. One Subject led to another,
till a Sort of Work grew under his Hand.
His only View at first was private Amuse∣ment,
nor at present does he esteem the Thing
of Value to be published for its own Sake.
But he confesses, he has at Heart to raise a
Spirit among his Countrymen, of searching
into their Antiquities, those especially which
regard the Law and the Constitution; being
seriously convinced, that nothing will more
contribute than this Study, to eradicate a Set
of Opinions, which, by Intervals, have dis∣quieted
this Island for a Century and an Half.
If these Papers have the Effect designed, it
will justify the Publication: They will serve
at least to bear Testimony of some Degree of
<PB REF="3"/>
Firmness in the Author, who, amidst the
Calamities of a Civil War, gave not over his
Country for lost; but trusting to a good
Cause, and to good Dispositions in the Bulk
of his Countrymen, was able to compose
his Mind to Study, having no other Oppor∣tunity
of being useful; and to deal in Specu∣lations,
which are not relished, but in Times
of the greatest Tranquillity.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF the Introduction of the FEUDAL LAW
into SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THE Introduction of the Feudal Law
into <HI>Scotland</HI> is an Event, which
makes not such a Figure in our Hi∣story
as it ought to do: It is mentioned in∣deed
by most of our Historians, but dryly
and cursorily, as if it were an ordinary Inci∣dent.
And yet, as the Story is told, it appears
to be a very singular Revolution, for which
no adequate Cause is assigned. If Credit can
be given to History or Tradition, we were
once a free People; nay, we are reported to
have been fierce and untamed, our Nobles of
great Power, generally too mighty for the
Sovereign, priding themselves upon Indepen∣dency
and Extent of Property. Now, as it is
the Plan of the Feudal Law, to bestow the
whole Land Property upon the King, and to
subject the Bulk of the People to him as his
Servants and Vassals; a Constitution so con∣tradictory
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
to all the Principles which govern
Mankind can never be brought about, one
should imagine, without Violence, whether
Conquest from without, or military Force
from within: Yet neither of these Causes is
assigned by our Authors, nor will the History
of <HI>Scotland</HI> admit of such a Supposition; for
no Period can be assigned, during which the
Feudal Law might have been introduced,
where there are any Traces of Conquest, or
of military Power, sufficient to inforce so
unnatural a Constitution.</P>
<P>ALL our Historians are agreed, that this
Revolution happened in the Reign of <HI>Mal∣colm</HI>
II. and they are also pretty much agreed
upon the Circumstances which brought it
about. This King had been engaged in fierce
Wars with the <HI>Danes,</HI> which, after various
Success, ended in driving the Invaders out of
this Part of the Island. Many of his Nobles
had done him notable Service; and, to re∣ward
their Fidelity, ('tis said) he divided all
the Crown Lands amongst them. And so
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
circumstantiate is the Story, that 'tis averred
he retained no Lands to himself, but the
<HI>Mute-hill</HI> in the Town of <HI>Scoon.</HI> A very
extensive and unprecedented Piece of Libera∣lity.
But what follows is still more difficult
to be believed; That the Lords, to testify
their Gratitude, gave and granted to their So∣vereign,
and to his Heirs for ever, the Ward
and Relief of their Lands with the Marriage
of their Heirs. This is a short Way of ex∣pressing
a thing, which bears this obvious
Meaning, that all the Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI> were
surrendered to the King as his Property; that
all the great Men came under personal Obli∣gations
to be his Servants and Vassals, holding
only the Possession of the Lands which they
had surrendered, for Sustenance of themselves
and their People, ready upon all Occasions to
fight his Battles. There are few Examples of
so warm Returns of Gratitude among Indi∣viduals;
but, in a whole Nation, altogether
incredible. I should be stunned with such
Liberty of Fiction in a Romance. There∣fore,
laying aside this Account of the Matter,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
as utterly improbable, the Design of this Es∣say
is to bring together some Circumstances,
whence probable Conjectures may be formed,
at what Time, and after what Manner, the
Feudal Law was introduced into <HI>Scotland.</HI>
I shall set out with the Time of Introduction,
as it may give Light to the other Branch of
the Disquisition; and I must confess, that,
notwithstanding the concurring Testimonies
of all our Historians, I entertain some Doubts
whether the Feudal Law was introduced into
<HI>Scotland</HI> so early as in the Reign of <HI>Mal∣colm</HI>
II. What to me brought this thing first
under Suspicion, is a Fact that can be made
extremely evident. When one dives into the
Antiquities of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> it will
appear that we borrowed all our Laws and
Customs from the <HI>English.</HI> No sooner is a
Statute enacted in <HI>England,</HI> but, upon the
first Opportunity, it is introduced into <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
so that our oldest Statutes are mere
Copies of theirs. Let the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> be
put into the Hands of any <HI>Scotsman,</HI> without
giving its History, and he will have no Doubt
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
that he is reading a Collection of <HI>Scots</HI> Statutes
or Regulations. Now it is a Point settled a∣mong
the best <HI>English</HI> Antiquaries, That the
Feudal Law was introduced into <HI>England</HI> by
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror. I need not spend
Time upon this Topick, after what is said by
the accurate <HI>Spelman,</HI> and by our Country∣man
<HI>Craig.</HI> Joining these two things toge∣ther,
a strong Presumption arises, that the
Feudal Law made its Progress from <HI>England</HI>
to this Country, as all the <HI>English</HI> Statutes,
making Improvements and Alterations upon it,
certainly did. But this Presumption receives
additional Force, when it is considered, that
if we had the Feudal Law before it came into
<HI>England,</HI> it must have been taken from some
other People than the <HI>Normans,</HI> with whom
we had no Commerce. Upon that Supposi∣tion,
we must expect to find the Feudal
Customs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Days of <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
the Conqueror, somewhat different from
what they were in <HI>England,</HI> as the Feudal
Customs were very different in different Na∣tions.
What we had in <HI>Scotland</HI> must have
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
been formed upon the Plan of those of the
Country from which we borrowed them,
perhaps a little varied in our Practice. Yet,
upon Inquiry, we find no such Disparity as
we ought to expect from the Supposition.
On the contrary, I think it may with Assu∣rance
be pronounced, that the Feudal Customs
in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were precisely the
same, for a Century or two after the Days of
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror. This Congruity be∣twixt
the Laws of the different Countries
affords Evidence, as high as Probability can
go, of one of two things, either that we bor∣rowed
the Feudal Law from <HI>England,</HI> or,
that they borrowed it from us. The latter
is not maintained by any Author; nor is there
any Foundation for the Assertion, it being as
well vouched as any Point can be, of that
Antiquity, that <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror brought
the Feudal Customs along with him from
<HI>Normandy:</HI> And it is certain, he had no In∣tercourse
with <HI>Scotland,</HI> unless in the Shape
of Enmity and War.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10"/>
IN fair Reasoning it must be yielded, that
the Circumstance now mentioned ought to
create a Suspicion, that the Feudal Law is not
of such Antiquity in <HI>Scotland</HI> as is generally
believed. But it will be said, that Doubts and
Suspicions, however great, must yield to po∣sitive
Evidence; and that we have not only
the Authority of all our Historians for the
Fact above mentioned, but still a more con∣vincing
Evidence, the Laws of <HI>Malcolm</HI> II.
still extant, which bear, “That King <HI>Mal∣colm</HI>
distributed all his Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI>
among his Men; reserving nothing in Pro∣perty
to himself, but the Royal Dignity,
and the <HI>Mute-hill</HI> in the Town of <HI>Scoon.</HI>
And all his Barons gave and granted to him,
the Ward and Relief of the Heir of ilk
Baron, for the King's Sustentation.”</P>
<P>THESE Authorities appear to be of Weight,
and shall be handled deliberately. Supposing
the above mentioned Laws to be those of
<HI>Malcolm</HI> II. the Dispute is at an End, and the
Evidence complete, not only upon account of
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
the above cited Passage, but because in these
Laws frequent mention is made of Feudal
Customs, such as the Office of Chancery,
Charters, Sasines, Barons holding of the King,
Knights holding of Barons, and others hold∣ing
of Knights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But when I weigh this
Evidence of the Antiquity of the Feudal Law
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I perceive one Circumstance
wanting to make it complete. That these
are the Laws of King <HI>Malcolm</HI> cannot be de∣nied;
they have in all Ages been reckoned
authentic, and King <HI>Malcolm</HI> is mentioned in
the Body of the Work: But it may be con∣troverted,
whether these are the Laws of
<HI>Malcolm</HI> the II. We had four Kings of the
Name of <HI>Malcolm;</HI> and we have no Autho∣rity,
but from the Title, to ascribe these
Laws to the second of that Name: But at
what Time, or upon what Evidence was this
Title added, we are altogether uncertain. The
Title in the printed Copy is obviously a <HI>post
facto</HI> Work; for it runs thus: “The Laws
of King <HI>Malcolm Mackenneth,</HI> second of
that Name, who was Son to <HI>Kenneth</HI> the
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
Third, and began to reign in the Year of
the Creation of the World 4974, and of
Christ 1004. These Laws are authentic,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>” This Title proves only, that <HI>Skeen</HI>
the Publisher believed these to be <HI>Malcolm</HI>
the II.'s Laws: Upon what Evidence he does
not say, nor can it well be gathered, if it be
not what arises from the Title given to the
Manuscript Copies, which in all Probability
had no better Foundation than a vague Tra∣dition.</P>
<P>BUT I chuse not to rest upon negative
Arguments. There is Evidence the most con∣vincing,
that <HI>Malcolm</HI> the II. was not the Au∣thor
of these Laws: This Evidence is drawn
from the Work itself, wherein frequent men∣tion
is made of Earls and Barons, of the
Chancellor and his Court, Coroner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> none
of which Names, in all Probability, had a
Being in the Time of <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. The Court
of Chancery was not known in <HI>England</HI> be∣fore
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror; and it is not
probable we had it before his Time. But
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
more positively, 'tis a Fact agreed upon by
all Writers, that it was <HI>Malcolm</HI> III. who cre∣ated
the first Barons and Earls. <HI>Dempster</HI>
the best of our Antiquarians, <HI>p. 120, Mal∣colmus
tertius, sublato Maccabaeo tyranno, reg∣num
legittime sibi debitum occupavit, quod ut
ornaret unica cura incubuit: tunc et a prae∣diis
nobilibus nomina quisque sumpsit, et cum
magna frequensque nobilitas S. Margaretam
ex Hungaria et Anglia secuta in Scotia conse∣disset,
splendorem novo suo principatui addi∣turus,
Barones et Comites creavit.</HI> Before the
Days of <HI>Malcom</HI> III. <HI>Thane</HI> was the only
Name in <HI>Scotland</HI> by which the Nobles were
distinguished. Turn over the Historians, and
there will not be found anywhere Mention of
the Title of Baron before his Time, nor of
Earl. All were called <HI>Thanes,</HI> such as the
Thane of <HI>Fife</HI> in <HI>MacBeath</HI>'s Time, Thane
of <HI>Ross,</HI> Thane of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> Thane of <HI>Caith∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss,</HI>
&amp;c. but from <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI>'s Time
downwards, not a Word of Thane; all
the great Lords are either Earls or Barons.
Here then the Evidence is compleat, that
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
these Laws are not of a more ancient Standing
than the Reign of <HI>Malcolm Canmore,</HI> and to
him therefore they must be restored: For
they are the Laws of one King <HI>Malcolm,</HI> and
'tis more probable they are his, than the Laws
of his great Grandson <HI>Malcolm</HI> IV. before
whose Time the Feudal Law was certainly
introduced into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING discussed this Point, the Argu∣ment
drawn from the Authority of the Histo∣rians
will be easily got over. We have no
Author who wrote in the Days of <HI>Malcolm
Canmore,</HI> nor for many Ages after: There∣fore,
as our Histories rest upon no better Au∣thority
than Tradition, 'tis not surprising,
that an Event which happened in the Reign
of one King, should be ascribed to a Prede∣cessor
of the same Name, there being a pre∣vailing
Bias in most Nations to carry back
their Antiquities as far as possible. But the
Matter does not rest here, the Error of these
Historians may be detected from their own
Writings. <HI>Hector Boece,</HI> for Example, who
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
ascribes the Introduction of the Feudal Law,
as aforesaid, to <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. adds with the same
Breath, that it was <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. who divided
<HI>Scotland</HI> into Baronies. We have therefore
this Author's Testimony, that the same <HI>Mal∣colm</HI>
introduced the Feudal Law, who divided
<HI>Scotland</HI> into Baronies. This was certainly
<HI>Malcolm</HI> III. And <HI>Buchanan,</HI> who for the most
Part implicitely follows <HI>Hector Boece,</HI> yet, in
telling the Story upon his Authority, expres∣ses
a Doubt, and inclines to think, that we
had the Laws of Ward and Relief rather from
the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Normans.</HI></P>
<P>THAT I may leave nothing untouch'd,
which concerns a Point of such Importance
in the Antiquities of this Country, I proceed
to some other Considerations, which I per∣ceive
may be made Use of to support the high
Antiquity of the Feudal Law in <HI>Scotland.</HI> One
is made Use of by the learned <HI>Craig</HI> to that
very End, <HI>Multa tamen sunt quae me movent,
ut hoc jure (sciz. feudali) nostrates usos pu∣tem,
antequam Angli eo uti caeperint. Hoc
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
enim certissimum est, nos purius hoc jus habere
quam vicinos; ut in rivulis aquarum qui quo
propiores sint fonti sive scaturigini eo sunt pu∣riores.</HI>
This Author probably had in View
the Feudal Customs, as they subsisted in his
own Time; and 'tis very true, that in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
the Feudal Law began sooner to decline
than it did in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Arts and Industry
flourished in that Kingdom long before they
had any Life here; and I have observed else∣where,
that the strict Regulations of the Feu∣dal
Law, are in a great Measure inconsistent
with the Arts of Peace. But if <HI>Craig</HI> had
under Consideration the Feudal Law, as prac∣tised
in this Island for some Ages after the
Time of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, he is un∣doubtedly
in a Mistake. The Feudal Law,
during that Period, was precisely the same in
both Kingdoms, so far as we can gather, by
comparing the ancient Statutes and Law-books
of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Regiam Majestatem,</HI> the oldest In∣stitute
we have of our Laws, is generally be∣lieved
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
to have been compiled in the Reign,
and by the Authority of <HI>David</HI> the I. And
as it contains a full and accurate System of
our Feudal Customs, a probable Argument
may be suggested from it, that the Feudal
Law had a Beginning in <HI>Scotland</HI> before the
Days of <HI>Malcolm Canmore.</HI> For, if the Feu∣dal
Law was introduced by that King, there
is no Probability it should make so sudden a
Progress, as to be ripe for a regular Institute
in the Days of his Son <HI>David.</HI> This is not
agreeable to the natural Course of things,
and therefore not readily to be credited. Law
is but of slow Growth, especially among a
rude People, more addicted to the Arts of
War than of Peace. And yet, whatever be
the Aera of the <HI>Regiam Majestatem,</HI> it appears
from it, that the Feudal Law was brought to
a considerable Degree of Perfection in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
at that Time. The Argument is weigh∣ty;
and we must either give the Feudal Law
a more early Date in <HI>Scotland</HI> than the Reign
of <HI>Malcolm Canmore,</HI> or the <HI>Regiam Majesta∣tem</HI>
a later Date than the Reign of <HI>David</HI> I.
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
Touching this Matter one thing is certain,
that the <HI>Regiam Majestatem</HI> was compiled in
the Reign of one of our <HI>Davids.</HI> The Au∣thor,
whoever he be, declares in his Preface,
“That he was commanded by King <HI>David</HI>
to compile this Work, with the Counsel
and Advice of the whole Realm, that all
the Inhabitants thereof might learn and
have Knowledge of the same.” What re∣mains
is to determine which of the <HI>Davids</HI>
this was. If the Reader will indulge a short
Digression, I shall make it evident, that it
was <HI>David</HI> the II. who reigned two Cen∣turies
later than the other, the Distance of
whose Reign from that of <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI>
affords sufficient Time for the Ripening of
the Feudal Law. All the World knows,
that the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, after being buried in
Oblivion for Ages, came to be restored in
<HI>Italy</HI> by an Accident. The very Books of
that Law were understood to be lost past
Recovery, till a Copy of the Pandects was
found in the Town of <HI>Amalphi anno</HI> 1127.
by <HI>Lotharius</HI> the Emperor, when he took
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
that Town, in the War he carried on against
<HI>Rodger</HI> King of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Naples.</HI> The
Knowledge of it increased so fast, that it was
taught publickly by <HI>Vaccarius</HI> at <HI>Oxford</HI> about
the Year 1150, during the Reign of King
<HI>Stephen.</HI> This was as swift a Progress as any
Science can be supposed to make; and there∣fore
no Probability we had it in <HI>Scotland</HI> be∣fore
that Time, nor consequently in the Reign
of <HI>David</HI> the I. who died in the Year 1153.
These Facts will give Light to the Subject in
hand. The Author of the <HI>Regiam Majesta∣tem</HI>
appears to be well acquainted with the
Civil Law, and frequently appeals to it as to
known Law. See <HI>lib. 2. c.</HI> 16. § 2. The
<HI>Regiam Majestatem</HI> therefore, compiled when
the Knowledge of the Civil Law was spread
through <HI>Scotland,</HI> could not have a Being in
the Days of <HI>David</HI> I. and consequently the
Argument is conclusive, that it was compiled
in the Days of <HI>David</HI> II.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to make out,
that the above remarkable Revolution in our
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
Land Rights happened in the Reign of <HI>Mal∣colm
Canmore.</HI> And if there is any thing in
the above Observations, it must afford an ad∣ditional
Conviction, that were one left to con∣jecture,
the said Reign would be pitched up∣on
before any other, for the Introduction of
the Feudal Law. This Law was brought in∣to
<HI>England</HI> by a Conqueror, at least one who
treated his new Subjects as a conquered Peo∣ple.
It was evident, that the possessing of
Land by Tenure, threw great Weight into
the Scale of Royalty; and therefore, it will
not be surprising, that a neighbouring Prince
who understood his own Interest, should en∣deavour
to copy after so good an Example.
At the same time, there never was in the
Reign of any <HI>Scots</HI> King, such a Conflux of
Strangers into <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in the Days of
<HI>Malcolm Canmore; English</HI> especially, some
of the highest Rank. By them the Fashion
was begun of Sirnames, many of which re∣main
at this Day with our most illustrious
Families. 'Twas to keep Pace with <HI>England</HI>
that the new Titles of Earls and Barons were
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
introduced; and we may readily believe, that
a politic King, who understood the Arts of
Government, would not stop short, but endea∣vour
also to introduce the Feudal Law, which
he could not but see would tend greatly to
increase his Power and Authority; and the
Conviction founded upon these Circumstan∣ces
turns stronger and stronger, when we
consider, that the Practice of giving Charters
of Lands, is by our Antiquaries universally
ascribed to <HI>Malcolm Canmore.</HI> Many of our
old Families pretend to have had Charters
from that King, but none before his Time.
Now, supposing the Feudal Law to have been
as old in <HI>Scotland</HI> as <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. 'tis scarce
supposable Charters would be of a later Date,
as such Writs seem to be necessarily connected
with Feudal Grants.</P>
<P>AND this leads to the second Branch of the
Enquiry, by what Means, and after what
Manner were the Nobles prevailed upon, not
only to part with their Lands, but to subject
themselves personally to Feudal Service.
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
However the Matter might be at first disgui∣sed,
the total Surrender of Lands to the King
during the Minority of an Heir, and the Year's
Rent payable at the Entry of every Heir,
were no slight Perquisites to be yielded rashly.
The Matter is dark; and the Historians have
touched it so slightly, that we have few Cir∣cumstances
to build Conjectures upon; and
what makes the Story still more mysterious,
is, that we have Vouchers of extravagant Do∣nations
of the Crown Lands by <HI>David</HI> I. in
favours of the Church. I cannot easily re∣concile
this with the Story told, that the King
gave away the whole Crown Lands, reserving
nothing to himself but the <HI>Mutehill</HI> of <HI>Scoon.</HI>
'Tis true, there might have been Forfeitures
in the Interim; and if any one is satisfied with
this Solution, I have nothing to object, only
the Interval betwixt the Reigns of <HI>Malcolm
Canmore</HI> and of his Son <HI>David</HI> I. is, I'm a∣fraid,
too short to make this Solution be ge∣nerally
relished. At the same Time, King
<HI>David</HI>'s Liberality to the Church is condemn∣ed
by every Writer as truly unjust, with re∣gard
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
to his Successors, who were thereby de∣prived
of their Birth-right, <HI>viz.</HI> the Patrimo∣ny
of the Crown: And yet the Charge is scarce
well founded, if in Fact nothing was given
away, but forfeited Lands, which every King
is privileged to dispose of at his Pleasure.</P>
<P>I CANNOT readily bring myself to believe,
that <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI> gave away the whole
Crown Lands, as is related. And on the o∣other
hand, I can as little bring myself to be∣lieve,
that by any Means less than absolute
Force, could the Bulk of the Nation be
brought to submit to an Act so visibly preju∣dicial
to them, that of surrendering their whole
Lands to the King, and their Persons also,
reserving only the Usufruct, in Name of
Wages, for Services to be performed by them.</P>
<P>IN a Matter so dark and intricate, I dare
venture no further, than to suggest a few Con∣jectures.
Before the Feudal Law was known
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I take it for granted, that our
People held their Lands without Writ, and
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
that Possession was the Circumstance which
determined the Property of Lands, as at this
Day it does of Moveables. Some Traces of
this we have remaining in the <HI>Orkney</HI> Islands,
where the Feudal Law is scarce yet fully esta∣blished.
If instead of introducing the Feudal
Law, all at once over the whole Kingdom,
it shall be supposed, that <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI>
did no more but lay the Foundation of a Build∣ing,
which was finished by his Successors, the
Thing will be easily credited: And touch∣ing
the Engines made Use of, we need not
be at a Loss, for we are directed to them by
our Authors. It was certainly the Crown
Lands which were made Use of as the Bait
to allure the Nobles. A prudent Distributi∣on
of Part of these Crown Lands, without
supposing the whole to be aliened, would go
a great Way. No Person upon whom Crown
Lands were bestowed, could refuse to hold
them upon any Conditions the King was plea∣sed
to impose. Here was a Beginning given
to the Feudal Tenure. If the Gift was con∣siderable,
the Receiver could not handsomely
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
avoid allowing his own Estate to be engrossed
in the Charter, if such a Thing was demand∣ed
of him. And such Stratagems would not
be overlooked by an artful Monarch, who
had it at Heart to make the Feudal Law uni∣versal
in his Kingdom.</P>
<P>HE had another Engine at hand. It is un∣controverted,
that it was <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI>
who introduced the Titles of Earl and Baron.
Possibly he had a further Design in this, than
merely to emulate the Splendour of a neigh∣bouring
Court. Our Forefathers were fond
of Titles, and were delighted with Shew and
Equipage. If some were tempted by a new
Title to give up their Independency, and to
accept of their own Estates as a Gift from the
King, holding of him by military Tenure,
we will cease to wonder-at the unequal Pur∣chase,
when we see so many at present re∣nouncing
their Independency, and giving them∣selves
up as Slaves to a Court for Ribbands
and Garters, still more empty Geugaws, if
possible, than Titles of Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26"/>
THE Foundation being thus happily laid,
the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> had many Opportu∣nities
to carry on the Work. Our Forefa∣thers
were a fierce and restless People; Pro∣perty
was in a continual Flux by Forfeitures;
and 'tis probable, that the Bulk of the <HI>Terra
firma</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has, by that Means, passed
through the Sovereign's Hands one time or
other. This afforded ample Means of exten∣ding
the Feudal Law further and further, as
Care was always taken to make out Gifts of
Forfeiture in the Feudal Form.</P>
<P>ONE other Cause there was of the Growth
of the Feudal Law, which, tho' working
silently and imperceptibly, had I'm persuaded
a greater Effect than all the other Causes
combined together.</P>
<P>MANKIND, especially in ignorant Ages,
are governed by Custom and Habit. By the
Growth of the Feudal Law, a Charter cer∣tainly
came to be considered as the most so∣lemn
Title to Land, so as to give Possession
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
alone, without a Charter, a very slender Hold
of the Imagination. Perhaps this had no re∣markable
Effect upon old Possessors. But
singular Successors, whether Creditors or Pur∣chasers,
were in a different Situation. People
who part with their Money will not be rea∣dily
satisfied with any Title that is not of the
best Sort. Thus, after the Commerce of
Land was introduced, we may trust that
Charters were multiplied exceedingly. For
whatever Security a Family might have from
a long continued Possession, the Notion would
in time be firmly established, that there was
no secure Manner of transferring Land Pro∣perty
but by Charter and Sasine.</P>
<P>IN short, my Conjecture is, that the Feudal
Law was not introduced all at once, as our
Authors insinuate, but by Degrees. And
what I have often heard, favours this Conjec∣ture,
that so late as the Reign of <HI>Iames</HI> VI.
there were Proprietors in <HI>Scotland</HI> who never
had accepted of a Charter.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28"/>
IF I am not deceived, this was a Measure
the most politic, and of the greatest Fore∣cast,
that ever was contrived. It was a bold
Game for the King to play away his Crown
Lands for a small Consideration in hand; but
the Prospect was fair, as no Constitution does
more firmly unite a People with their Sove∣reign,
than that of the Feudal Law, nor gives
him such an immediate Hold of the Persons
and Property of his Subjects. Our Histo∣rians
give us to understand, that a prevailing
Desire to support the Dignity of the Crown,
gave Rise to the Feudal Law in <HI>Scotland.</HI>
I'm sorry to observe, that Instances of pub∣lic
Spirit, even among Individuals, are rare
in our History. But I have read of no In∣stance
of an universal public Spirit through
a whole Nation, sufficient to bring about such
a Revolution; one excepted, among the <HI>La∣cedemonians,</HI>
in the Days of their King <HI>Ly∣curgus</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Nor is the Evidence of this Piece of History altoge∣ther above Exception. <HI>Xenophon,</HI> who writes a Treatise upon the <HI>Spartan</HI> Government, has not a Word of it.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CONSTITUTION of PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Feudal Constitutions, every Su∣perior
had a Jurisdiction within his
own Territory: His Vassals were obliged to
attend his Courts, and it was their Province
to try all Causes, Civil and Criminal, in Form
of a Jury or Inquest. This is the Form of
our County Courts at this Day, held at stated
Times by the High Sheriff, in Name of the
King; the Crown Vassals being all of them
bound to appear under a Penalty, each in the
Court of the County within which his Lands
are situated. The Parliament is the King's
Court for the Kingdom in general, and con∣sequently
his whole Vassals within the King∣dom
were bound to give their Attendance
there. The Barons and Freeholders attended
in this Capacity. The Bishops, Abbots and
Priors attended in the same Capacity; and if
any of them held their Lands of a Subject,
they certainly were not bound to perform this
Service.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/>
THE Idea of a King, where the Feudal
Law took Place, is not that of a chief Magi∣strate
or Governor, but that of a Paramount
Superior, having the whole Property of the
Kingdom vested in him, having his Vassals
attached to him by Homage and Fealty, and
supported by him out of the Produce of his
Lands: which makes a very strict Connection
and Union betwixt them. The Idea of a Par∣liament,
as I have said, is that of a Court
where all the King's Vassals are obliged to at∣tend
for administrating of Justice, and for
making Regulations to bind the whole Society.</P>
<P>IT was one Essect of the Feudal Law to
withdraw Land from Commerce. Land be∣ing
allotted for the Maintenance of Servants
of Vassals, ready to obey their Masters Com∣mands
in War and Peace, the Superior could
not sell, because the whole Profits arising from
the Subject belonged to the Vassal, and the
Vassal could not sell because he was not Pro∣prietor.
This was an unnatural Constitution,
which could not subsist long in peaceable
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
Times. The Severity of the Feudal Law
gave Place by Degrees to milder and more na∣tural
Regulations. Land the most desirable
Acquisition came to be <HI>in commercio,</HI> and the
Crown Vassals originally few in Number, and
possessing large Territories were greatly mul∣tiplied.
Purchasers were willing to hold of
the King rather than of a Subject; and the
King was willing to encourage this Com∣merce,
as it lessened the Power of the great
Barons. In Time the obliging so many small
Vassals to an expensive Attendance in Parlia∣ment,
was considered as a Grievance. In
<HI>England</HI> this Grievance was remedied, pro∣bably
in the Days of <HI>Iohn</HI> or <HI>Henry</HI> III. for
the Record of that Transaction is lost. The
Remedy was introduced with us later, and we
have the Record entire. By the Act 101,
<HI>Parl.</HI> 1427, the Attendance of small Barons
and Freeholders is dispensed with, provided
they send to Parliament, from every Shire,
two or more of their Number to represent
them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
WE followed the <HI>English</HI> so close in all
their Regulations concerning Law and Policy,
that I am persuaded our Statute 1427. has
been copied from some <HI>English</HI> Statute enact∣ed
by King <HI>Iohn,</HI> or in the Beginning of the
Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. which is now lost with
the other Statutes of that Period. One thing
is certain, that we find Knights of the Shire
elected by the smaller Crown Vassals, pre∣cisely
as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> early in the Reign of
<HI>Henry</HI> III. But this is not all. We find by
King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter of Privileges to his <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Subjects, Sections 17. and 18. that it was
the Practice in his Days to summon to Parlia∣ment
the greater Barons by Name, leaving
the lesser Barons and Freeholders to be sum∣moned
by the Sheriffs edictally, or in general
Terms. Here we have the lesser Barons at∣tending
personally. From the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI>
III. downwards, the small Barons and Free∣holders
never did Duty in Parliament, other∣ways
than by sending some of their Number
out of each Shire to represent them. This
makes it extremely evident, that the Atten∣dance
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
of the small Barons and Freeholders
must in <HI>England</HI> have been dispensed with, as
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon Condition of their sending
Representatives. Their withdrawing from
Parliament might have been overlooked; but
so pointed a Regulation, as that of acting by
Delegates, could never have been introduced
otherways than by a Statute. The thing de∣serves
to be attended to, because it laid the
Foundation of a House of Commons, of
which more fully afterwards.</P>
<P>WHETHER the Royal Burrows were ori∣ginally
constituent Members of the Parliament
is a Point much debated. It is observed,
“That the <HI>Reddendo</HI> of their Charters being
Watching and Warding only, they were
not bound to give Suit and Presence in any
of the King's Courts; that they had a Court
peculiar to themselves, which was the
Chamberlain Ayr; that <HI>de facto</HI> there is no
Instance of their ever appearing in a Coun∣ty
Court, and consequently no Reason to
believe they appeared originally in Parlia∣ment;
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
and that in <HI>England</HI> there is no E∣vidence
upon Record, of Burgesses being
called to Parliament, before 49. <HI>Henry</HI> III.
at which time Writs were directed to the
Sheriffs of the several Counties, to return
the Knights of the Shire and Burgesses;
whence 'tis conjectured, that the calling of
the Burgesses to Parliament was a Politic of
<HI>Simon de Montfort,</HI> who had at that Time
the Power of the Kingdom in his Hands,
and who called the Parliament 49. <HI>Henry</HI>
III. in order to purge himself from Suspi∣cions
spread abroad of his intending to usurp
the Crown.” One Fact must be owned,
with regard to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that in a Preamble
to <HI>Robert Bruce'</HI> s Laws still extant, the whole
Orders are faithfully enumerated; Bishops,
Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and other
Noblemen of the Realm, without a Word of
Burgesses. In a Preamble to the Laws of
<HI>Robert</HI> III. Burgesses are mentioned for the
first Time; and the Conjecture is, that many
of the noble Families having been extinguish∣ed,
during the Struggles we had for Liberty
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
against the two <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> King
<HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> in order to recruit the Parlia∣ment,
found it necessary to call the Royal
Burrows to a Participation of the Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING of these specious
Facts and Observations, I am of Opinion,
that the Royal Burrows made originally one
of the Estates of Parliament. What deter∣mines
me to think so, are the following Rea∣sons:
In the first Place, they are the King's
immediate Vassals, and therefore bound to
Attendance equally with the Barons and Pre∣lates;
<HI>Suit and Presence</HI> in the Superior's
Courts being a Duty essential to every Feudal
Holding, unless where expresly remitted.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Attendance in Parliament, in old
Times, being reckoned a Burden or Service,
by no Means a Privilege, the Royal Burrows
would not have obeyed a Summons from the
King, unless they had been bound by their
Holding. And our Kings were by no Means
so absolute, as by their mere Wills to intro∣duce
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
a Regulation of this general and impor∣tant
Nature. And in the <HI>third</HI> Place, Sup∣posing
the King's Authority great enough to
oblige the Burrows to submit to this En∣croachment
upon their Privileges, we cannot
suppose so wise and just a Prince as <HI>Robert
Bruce</HI> would undertake such a violent Mea∣sure,
not only without Necessity, but where
a more natural Remedy was at hand. For if
many noble Families were extinguished, their
Estates surely were not, which falling to the
Crown, by the Supposition, through the Fail∣ure
of Heirs, were an ample Fund for in∣creasing
the Number of Crown Vassals to fill
the Parliament. <HI>Lastly,</HI> 'Tis presumable the
Commerce of Land had crept in before this
Time, and that the Crown Vassals were ra∣ther
more numerous than formerly. It is cer∣tain,
they were so greatly multiplied the very
next Century, that it was thought expedient
to exempt the smaller Barons from their At∣tendance.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37"/>
AND in Answer to what is urged on the
other Side, the <HI>Reddendo</HI> of Watching and
Warding proves nothing; many Services be∣ing
due which are not exprest in the Charter.
Witness the common Stile of Ward-holding,
<HI>Reddendo servitia solita et consueta.</HI> It has
a stronger Appearance, that Royal Burrows
have been all along exempted from attending
the County Courts. But this Indulgence,
and the having a Court peculiar to them∣selves,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Chamberlain Court, will not
infer their Exemption from Parliaments,
where Laws are made binding upon the whole
Kingdom; whereas judicial Proceedings were
the only Subject-matter of Chamberlain Ayrs,
nothing being there transacted relating to pub∣lic
Policy or Government.</P>
<P>THO' there is no Mention of calling Bur∣gesses
to the <HI>English</HI> Parliament before the
49. <HI>Henry</HI> III. it appears to me a very lame
Inference, That the Practice began at this
Time, when we find the Records of preceed∣ing
Transactions so imperfect. At the same
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
Time, were these Records entire, and were
there no Instance before that Period of a Writ
directed to the Sheriff for calling Borgesses to
Parliament, it would not follow, that the
Royal Burrows were no sooner assumed as a
Branch of the Legislature. This must be ex∣plained.
It is mentioned above, to have been
the Practice in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Days, to call on∣ly
the greater Barons by Name, and to leave
the lesser Barons and Freeholders to be sum∣moned
by the Sheriffs edictally, or in general
Terms. Probably the Representatives from
Burrows were ranked with the lesser Barons,
and not honoured with a personal Citation.
When the Attendance of the smaller Barons
came to be dispensed with, upon their send∣ing
Representatives, this Change in the Con∣stitution
introduced an Alteration in the Stile
of the Writs directed to the Sheriffs. Instead
of the old Form, enjoining the Sheriff to no∣tify
publicly the Holding of the Parliament,
that all who were bound might attend, he
was commanded specially to return two
Knights of the Shire: This made it necessary
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
to be equally special with regard to the Re∣presentatives
of the Burrows; and therefore,
in the Writ, he was directed to return two
Knights and two Burgesses: This Circum∣stance
therefore proves nothing further than
that in <HI>Henry</HI> III's Time, the Stile of the
Writ was changed and made special, when it
was before in general Terms. But further,
the Circumstances of the Case are a strong E∣vidence
to me, that this was not the first Time
the Attendance of the Burrows in Parliament
was required. Historians mention, that this
Parliament was called by <HI>Montfort,</HI> in order
to purge himself of a Suspicion, which was
gaining Ground, of his aiming at the Crown.
It is not said he had any particular Connecti∣on
with the Burrows, to make their Presence
of Use to him; and unless it were in some
such View, I cannot imagine, that <HI>Montfort</HI>
would, in these ticklish Circumstances, think
of making any Alteration in the Constitution.
At the same Time, the plain and simple Stile
of the Writ proves it to have been a common
and known Writ of the Law of <HI>England.</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
Had any thing extraordinary been enjoined,
it must have been introduced with a Preamble
to support the Command; especially, as this
was not a Matter of Course, but a Summons,
which the Burrows were not bound to obey.</P>
<P>I HAVE been the fuller upon this Point, as
it tends to ascertain what was the original
Constitution of Parliament, that all the King's
Vassals, and no other Vassals, were the con∣stituent
Members. As personal Attendance
was required, there was no Place for Repre∣sentatives,
unless from the Burrows. It would
have been an Hardship intolerable, to oblige
the whole Community to personal Attend∣ance;
and therefore we may well suppose,
that in all Times this Attendance has been
dispensed with, upon sending a few of their
Number to represent them. This was origi∣nally
the only Representation, properly so
called.</P>
<P>THUS we see how the small Crown Vas∣sals
came to be freed from attending Parlia∣ments,
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> In
<HI>Scotland</HI> these Vassals had so little Attention
to the Public, that they were satisfied with
their Exemption, without thinking of fulfil∣ling
the Condition by sending Representatives,
'till the Regulation was enforced by a new
Law; of which afterwards. Probably in
<HI>England</HI> the Case would have been the same,
but for the peculiar Circumstances of the
Times. One thing appears, that in a Par∣liament
held by <HI>Henry</HI> III. <HI>anno</HI> 1258, there
were but twelve Representatives from the
small Barons. Yet soon thereafter, the Strug∣gles
betwixt the King and his great Barons
drawing to a Head, there were in the Parlia∣ment
1264. no fewer than four Knights for
each County. This full Representation was
probably occasioned by the Anxiety of the
Barons, desiring a numerous Assembly to give
Weight to their Proceedings. And the Re∣gulation
having once taken Place, would rea∣dily
be kept up, without any new Impulse,
with the Difference only of more or fewer
Representatives from each County.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42"/>
THE sending of Representatives, in place
of the small Crown Vassals, was but one Step
towards establishing the House of Commons
of <HI>England</HI> in the Form it now subsists. Tho'
the King's Vassals conveened in Parliament,
were distinguished into three Estates, the Spi∣ritual
Lords, the Temporal Lords or Barons,
and the Representatives from the Royal Bur∣rows,
we must not be deceived as if they
made three different Bodies: They were all
equally the King's Vassals, and composed but
one Body politic, which sat and voted in one
House. And this Form continued in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
so long as our Parliament subsisted, after
we had Representatives from Shires as well as
before. In <HI>England,</HI> for many Centuries, the
greater Barons have made one Body, the Re∣presentatives
from the Shires and Burrows ano∣ther,
who sit in different Houses, and debate
and vote separately. At what Period was
this Form established is altogether unknown,
so far as I can learn; tho' the thing be ex∣tremely
remarkable, by the Change it has
made in the Constitution of the <HI>English</HI> Go∣vernment.
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
This only is certain, that there
were two Houses of Parliament before the
1376; for, in a Parliament held that Year
<HI>Peter de la Mare</HI> is mentioned by Historians
as Speaker of the House of Commons, which
is a pretty strong Evidence, that the Commons
were at that Time separated from the Peers,
having a President or Speaker of their own;
for one Body cannot readily admit of two
Presidents.</P>
<P>As this Division of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament
into two Bodies, was no necessary Consequence
of substituting Representatives, in place of the
numerous Body of Electors, I am apt to ima∣gine,
that the Difficulty of accommodating all
the Members in one Place has occasioned the
Separation. Parliaments were of old ambu∣latory.
Scarce a great Town in <HI>England</HI> but,
one Time or other, has been honoured with
a Parliament. However ill accommodated,
there were no Means for a Separation, while
all the Crown Vassals sat in their own Right:
for they could not think of making a separate
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
Body of a few Representatives from Burrows.
But after Representatives were introduced, in
place of the small Vassals of the Crown, a
Division into two Bodies was readily practi∣cable,
by placing the Spiritual and Temporal
Lords in one Room, the Representatives from
the small Crown Vassals and from the Bur∣rows
in another. This Practice probably had
its Beginning in Towns where no single Room
was found large enough to accommodate the
whole Body, and has been kept up in other
Towns, where there was not the same Ne∣cessity,
possibly by the Authority of the Peers,
upon whom it conferred an additional Lustre.
The Silence of Historians favours this Con∣jecture.
Had this Division of the Parliament
been the Result of any solemn Act, whether
of the Parliament itself, or of the King and
Council, such a Regulation could not readily
have escaped Notice. However this be, the
splitting of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament into two
Bodies, laid the Foundation of a great Change
in the Constitution. And this Event, among
many, is an Instance of Revolutions which
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
spring from the most accidental or transitory
Circumstances, and for that Reason extreme∣ly
obscure in their Origin, however grand in
their present Appearance.</P>
<P>As our <HI>Iames</HI> I. was perfectly well ac∣quainted
with the <HI>English</HI> Constitution, by his
long Residence in <HI>England,</HI> it appears to have
been his Plan to introduce into his own King∣dom
many of the Laws and Customs of that
Country. What we have at present to take
Notice of, are contained in the above menti∣oned
Statute, Act 101. Parl. 1427. <HI>1st</HI> ex∣empting
the small Barons and Freeholders
from Attendance in Parliament, upon Condi∣tion
of sending Representatives; <HI>2d,</HI> making
these Representatives perhaps, with the Re∣presentatives
from the Burrows, a separate
Body, which appears from the Regulation
appointing a President to be chosen, called
the common Speaker of the Parliament; <HI>3d,</HI>
enacting that the Prelates and Peers should be
called to Parliament <HI>nominatim</HI> by special Pre∣cepts.
Touching the first of these Regulati∣ons,
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
of which mention has been made above,
we don't find that the Act took Effect. The
small Vassals of the Crown, who had their
own more than the public Interest at Heart,
laid hold of the Exemption given them, with∣out
thinking of sending Representatives, be∣cause
these Representatives were to be sub∣sisted
at the Charge of their Constituents.
And the Prelates and great Lords, in whom
the Power of the Parliament centered after
this Regulation, had no Interest to enforce it.
The King indeed had an Interest, in order to
balance the exorbitant Power of the Nobles;
but in these rude Times this was overlooked,
insomuch that a Statute was obtained in the
Reign of <HI>Iames</HI> II. <HI>viz.</HI> Act 75. Parl. 1457,
relieving all Freeholders from Attendance,
whose yearly Rent did not amount to 20 <HI>l.</HI>
without a Word of their being obliged to
send Representatives. Matters continued upon
this Footing till the Days of <HI>Iames</HI> VI. save
that by the Act 78. Parl. 1503. all were ex∣empted
from Attendance whose Rent was
within One hundred Merks. The Reforma∣tion
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
greatly increased the Power of the No∣bility,
as it almost extinguished the Prelates.
The Abbacies were totally demolished; and
but few of the Bishops frequented the Parlia∣ment.
By this Means the Nobility had all in
their Power: They opprest the Burrows, and
were too strong for the King. Thus the
Government became purely Aristocratical, and
stood in need of some Regulation to bring it
to its former Poise. Had the Act of <HI>Iames</HI> I.
been followed out, in the same Manner as the
like Regulation was followed out in <HI>England,</HI>
this Evil would have been prevented: and
now the only Remedy was to revive that Act.
The Surprise is, that a Majority was found
among the Nobility, to countenance a Regu∣lation,
which behoved remarkably to abridge
their Authority. It appears from the Statute
which is the 114. Parl. 1587. that great Op∣position
was made. The Attendance of the
small Barons in Parliament was so thoroughly
in Desuetude, that they could not now think
of resuming as a Privilege, what they had so
long been exempted from, considered as a
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
Service. But it had all along been understood
to be the Prerogative of the Crown, acknow∣ledged
in every Statute relating to the Parlia∣ment,
that the King might call, by special
Writ, any of his Vassals he had a-mind, not∣withstanding
of their Exemption. Probably
this has been the Instrument made use of by
the King's Ministers, to gain the End pro∣posed:
The Nobles would be told, that if
they voted against the Regulation, the King
would use his Privilege of calling to Parlia∣ment
a Number of his small Vassals, sufficient
to over-balance the Nobility. As this is but
mere Conjecture, it is submitted to the Judg∣ment
of others. One thing is certain, that
the Act 1427. was revived, and the small
Barons sent Representatives to Parliament
from that Period downwards.</P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned above, that it was a
Part of the Plan of <HI>Iames</HI> I. to divide his Par∣liament
into two Bodies, as in <HI>England.</HI>
This was not followed by <HI>Iames</HI> VI. for our
Parliament continued one Body to the End.
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
It is left to conjecture, whether this was of
Design. or by Accident; for our Historians
are extremely defective upon our civil Tran∣sactions.
We have no Occasion to go further
than to <HI>England,</HI> to learn what Influence it
has upon the Constitution to divide a Parlia∣ment
into two Houses; and as it was a poli∣tic
Age, this of <HI>Iames</HI> VI. I am apt to be∣lieve,
it was not without Design, that the
Parliament of this Kingdom was continued
upon its old Footing. This is a curious Sub∣ject,
and deserves to be attended to. It is
pretty obvious, that the King's Negative a∣gainst
a Regulation agreed to by both Houses
is not a very valuable Privilege. The Opini∣on
of the two Houses, being understood the
Sense of the Nation, has rather too great
Force to be resisted by the <HI>Veto</HI> of any single
Man, the King not excepted. His refusing
an Assent in such a Case, is virtually declaring
himself against the Interest of his People. But
an <HI>English</HI> Monarch is seldom brought under
this Dilemma. If he can but get a Majority
in either House on his Side, the Work is done.
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
He may appear to be neuter. Thus taking
the Parliament complexly, a great Majority
may be against the King, bent, we may sup∣pose,
to fetter him by new Limitations; and
yet he may ward the Blow, can he but pro∣cure
a scrimp Majority in either House for
him. This cannot happen where the Parlia∣ment
makes but one Body, as in <HI>Scotland.</HI>
So far the Advantage lyes on the King's Side,
where the Parliament is composed of two Bo∣dies.
But to balance this, the same Advan∣tage
lyes on the Side of the People, where
the King's Views are to enlarge his Preroga∣tive
by Authority of Parliament; for a scrimp
Majority in either House, interposing a <HI>Veto,</HI>
frustrates his Design. In a Word, a single
Body gives great Opportunities of making En∣croachments
on either Side; whereas, sup∣posing
the Constitution to be sound and en∣tire,
it is best preserved so, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a Parliament
composed of two Bodies.</P>
<P>So far the Scales seem to hang upon the
Level. But then seldom is a Nation so uni∣ted,
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
as to think of making Encroachments
upon the Prerogative Royal: Whereas the
King, a single Person, has many Opportuni∣ties,
and seldom wants Inclination to enlarge
his Powers. King <HI>Iames</HI> and his Ministers
could not but be sensible of this, and there∣fore
a single Body was their Game. But the
Contrivance lay a little deeper; and this may
be discovered, by attending to one Branch of
the Constitution of the Parliament, peculiar
to <HI>Scotland.</HI> At what Time it was that the
Lords of the Articles were established, is un∣certain.
But as the Sessions of our Parlia∣ment
were generally very short, it was found
necessary, when Business multiplied, to elect
a certain Number out of every State, to pre∣pare
and digest Matters that were to be laid
before the Parliament, for their Determina∣tion.
This select Body was called the Lords
of the Articles; and such was the established
Practice, that no Business could be laid before
the Parliament, but what was prepared by
these Lords. This was in Reality a Negative
before Debate, which is of vastly greater Im∣portance
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
than the King's Negative after; and
the worst of all is, that there was no Reme∣dy,
in our Constitution, against the Partiali∣ty
of the Lords of the Articles, however glar∣ing
it might be. A Body thus constituted,
could not fail in Time to engross the whole
Power of the Parliament. And in Fact it
came to this at the Long-run, that Parlia∣ments
commonly sat but two Days. On the
first Day of their Meeting, they chose the
Lords of the Articles, an equal Number out
of each Estate, to whom the King joined
eight of his Crown Officers. These received
all the Grievances or Articles that were
brought to them, and formed them into Bills,
or rejected them at their Pleasure. When all
Matters were ready, the Parliament sat ano∣ther
Day, and approved or rejected the Bills
that were laid before them.</P>
<P>SUCH was the Practice in the 1587, when
the Act of <HI>Iames</HI> I. was revived. The King had
a fair Chance to secure the Lords of the Arti∣cles
for him, whether by influencing their Elec∣tion,
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
or by gaining them over after they were
elected. At any Rate eight Officers of State,
devoted to the King, must have had great In∣fluence
in so small a Body. By this Means
the King was pretty secure, that nothing could
be brought into Parliament without his Ap∣probation.
But even this Security was not
reckoned sufficient. About this very Time,
or soon after, a Scheme was laid and execut∣ed
to improve upon the above Regulation.
Under Pretext of the Lords of the Articles
not having sufficient Time to overtake the
Multiplicity of Affairs laid before them, four
Persons were to be named out of each Estate,
whose Province it was to meet Twenty Days
before the Parliament, to receive all Suppli∣cations,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to reject what they thought fri∣volous
or improper, and to digest into a Book
what they chose to lay before the Lords of
the Articles. This was done by the Act 218,
Parl. 1594. The Act may be thought de∣fective,
as no Provision is made in it for the
Choice of this select Body. But this was pure∣ly
an Artifice. It would have been too bare∣faced
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
to have named the King openly; for it
was the same with giving him a Negative be∣fore
Debate. And yet it must have been
obvious, that the Choice behoved to rest up∣on
the King; for a Body that was to meet
before the sitting of the Parliament, could
not possibly be chosen by the Parliament.
But as if this were not fully sufficient to lodge
with the Crown the Power of directing Mat∣ters
that were to be brought into Parliament,
it is further declared “to be the Privilege of
the King, to bring directly into Parliament
all Matters concerning himself, or common
Good of the Realm.”</P>
<P>THIS Statute was too manisest an En∣croachment
upon the Liberty of the Subject
to be patiently submitted to. It has for that
Reason been dropt; for I cannot otherways
conceive, what Need there was for the Ar∣tifice
made Use of by the Ministers of <HI>Charles</HI> I.
in the Parliament 1633, to secure the Lords
of the Articles for the Crown; to wit, that
the Bishops should chuse eight Peers, and the
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
Peers eight Bishops; and that the Sixteen e∣lected
of the Bishops and Peers should joint∣ly
chuse eight Barons and eight Commission∣ers
for Burrows. With these were joined the
Officers of State; and thus were the Lords of
the Articles constituted, the Chancellor to be
President in all their Meetings. The Arti∣fice
here is obvious. The Bishops were uni∣versally
in the Interest of the Crown, as they
have been at all Times; and upon all Occasi∣ons.
The eight Peers elected by them were
sure Cards for the Crown, supposing but
eight of so numerous a Body capable of such
a Bias. As the whole Bishops were for the
Crown, it was indifferent which Eight were
chosen; and we may be certain, that none
would be chosen out of the Commons, but
what were for the King's Purpose, when such
were the Electors. This Method we may
believe was not practised by the Parliaments
during the Troubles. So far from it, that
the above mentioned Statute 1594 is expresly
rescinded in the Parliament 1640. It was
judged too bold a Step to revive it after the
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
Restoration. But as the Parliaments both in
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were called up∣on
the Restoration, were abundantly obse∣quious
to the King's Measures, another
Scheme was ventured upon very little more
disguised, which was to enact into a Law the
Contrivance fallen upon in the 1633, to se∣cure
the Lords of the Articles for the Crown.
This was done by the first Act, Parl. 1663.
And thus by the Constitution of the <HI>Scots</HI>
Parliament, nothing could be brought under
Deliberation but by the King's Authority,
or, which is the same, by the Authority of
his Creatures the Lords of the Articles, which
was an absolute Bar to all Hopes of any
Laws for securing the Liberty of the Sub∣ject.
On the other hand, he had a much
better Prospect of carrying through Laws
for his own Benefit, than he had in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
A Majority did his Affair, which
did not always answer in the other King∣dom.
For supposing, upon the whole,
a Majority for the King, yet if there
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
was a scrimp Majority in either House against
him, nothing could be carried on.</P>
<P>FOR my Part, I should have thought it less
criminal, in our Restoration Parliament, to
have openly bestowed upon the King a Ne∣gative
before Debate, than, in such an un∣der-hand
artificial Manner, to betray their
Constituents and Nation. This will stand as
a Monument of the wicked Enterprises of
Ministers, and of the Venality of our Parlia∣ments;
and long may it stand, if it do but
serve as a Warning to guard us against such
opprobrious Devices, if such shall ever again
be attempted against us.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the third Article of the Regu∣lations
introduced by the Statute 1427. that
the Prelates and Peers should be called to Par∣liament
by special Precepts, we must recapi∣tulate
in a few Words what has been said
above, upon the <HI>English</HI> Form of calling a
Parliament. Originally Parliaments were cal∣led
by issuing Brieves out of the Chancery to
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
the several Sheriffs, directing them to sum∣mon
publicly, or edictally, all those who
were obliged to attend the Parliament. A
public Notification, probably at the Market-Cross
of the Shire, was thought sufficient.
Over and above this general Summons, which
comprehended all the Ranks equally, a Form
was introduced, in the Reign of King <HI>Iohn,</HI>
of writing Letters to the Prelates and great
Lords by Name, acquainting them of the
Time and Place of holding the Parliament,
and requiring their Attendance. When Re∣presentatives
were introduced in place of the
small Barons, the general Summons was laid a∣side
as useless. The great Barons were called by
special Letters, and the Brieves, now directed
to the Sheriffs, came to be more special, or∣dering
them to return two Knights out of
every Shire, and two Burgesses out of every
Burgh; which Form is continued down to
this Day. In <HI>Scotland</HI> the small Barons, lay∣ing
hold of their Exemption, without sending
Representatives to Parliament, the general or
edictal Citation continued in Use as formerly,
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
with this Addition only, that, besides the ge∣neral
Citation, Letters came to be directed to
every one of the great Lords in particular.
There was not the same Necessity here to al∣ter
the Form of Citation, that there was in
<HI>England:</HI> The general Summons answered
the Purpose now as well as formerly; for,
not comprehending any but who were bound
to give Attendance, it readily accommodated
itself to the new Regulations, exempting from
Attendance those whose yearly Rent was un∣der
a certain Sum. That the general and
special Summons were used at the same time,
is clear from an Order of <HI>Iames</HI> III. entered
in the Records of Parliament 21st <HI>Feb.</HI> 1487.
for dissolving the Parliament, and calling a
new one. The Words are; “We do you
to wit, that our Sovereign Lord, by the
Advice of his Council, has, for certain rea∣sonable
and great Causes deserted and dis∣solved
his Parliament, that was continued
of before to the 5th of <HI>May</HI> next to come,
and has ordained a new general Parliament
to be set, and proclaimed to be holden at
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> the 12th Day of <HI>May</HI> next to
come, with Continuation of Days, and ge∣neral
Precepts to pass to all Lords, Prelates,
Barons, Freeholders and Commissaries, and
with special Letters under his Signet, to all
the Prelates and great Lords of his Realm,
to shew and declare to them the Cause of
the sitting of his said Parliament.”</P>
<P>I HAVE annexed a Copy of the Brieve is∣sued
out of the Chancery for an edictal Cita∣tion,
but I have not been so lucky as to find
anywhere the Form of the special Precept un∣der
the Signet. Probably this Precept has
fallen by Degrees into Disuse, and the calling
of the Parliament been left to the edictal Ci∣tation,
comprehending all Persons who were
bound to give Attendance. What confirms
me in this Opinion is the Statute 1587, so
often above mentioned, directing Commissi∣oners
to be chosen for each Sheriffdom, and
their Names to be notified to the Director of
the Chancery. The Form of calling these
Commissioners to Parliament is exprest in the
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
Statute, “That the said Commissioners be
warned at the first, by virtue of Precepts
forth of the Chancellary, or by his High∣ness's
missive Letters: And in all Time
thereafter by Precepts of the Chancellary,
as shall be directed to the other Estates.”
At this Period it would appear there was no
other Precept in Use but that issued out of
the Chancery, <HI>viz.</HI> the Brieve directed to the
several Sheriffs, ordering a general or edictal
Summons. And this Brieve also was after∣wards
laid aside, and in Place of it Parlia∣ments
were conveened by the King's Procla∣mations.</P>
<P>THE Form of calling a <HI>British</HI> Parliament,
so far as concerns <HI>Scotland,</HI> is appointed by
particular Statutes. In order to the electing
of the sixteen Peers, a Proclamation is issued
under the Great Seal of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> com∣manding
all the Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> to assemble
at such Time and Place, as is appointed in
the Proclamation, then, and there to elect the
sixteen Peers: And the Proclamation must
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
be duly published at the Market-Cross of <HI>E∣dinburgh,</HI>
and in all the County Towns of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> Twenty-five Days before the Meet∣ing
for Election, 6th <HI>Anne</HI> 22. The like
Proclamation might have sufficed for the
Meeting of the Freeholders in every County,
to chuse their Representatives; but a diffe∣rent
Form was chosen, and reasonably, being
more analogous to the Practice of <HI>England.</HI>
Brieves or Writs under the Great Seal of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> are directed to the several She∣riffs
and Stewards, who, on Receipt thereof,
must furthwith give Notice of the Time of
Election of the Commissioners for Shires;
and, at the Day appointed, the Freeholders
must conveen at the Head-Burgh of their
Shire or Stewartry, and proceed to the Elec∣tion
of their Commissioner. And the Clerk
of the Meeting must immediately return the
Name of the Person elected to the Sheriff or
Stewart, who shall annex it to his Writ, and
return it with the same into the Court out
of which the Writ issued. By Authority of
the same Brieve or Writ, the Sheriff or Stew∣art
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
must furthwith direct a Precept to eve∣ry
Royal Burgh within his Jurisdiction, com∣manding
them furthwith to elect a Commis∣sioner,
as they used formerly to elect Com∣missioners
to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
appointing the Commissioners to meet at the
presiding Burrow of the District, upon the
30th Day after the Day of the Teste of the
Writ, there to chuse their Burgess for the
Parliament. And the common Clerk of the
presiding Burrow must immediately, after the
Election, return the Name of the Person e∣lected
to the Sheriff or Stewart, who shall
annex it to his Writ, and return it with the
same, as aforesaid, 6th <HI>Anne</HI> 5.</P>
<P>BY an edictal or general Summons one Be∣nefit
arises to the Subject, which has not been
attended to when the Statute 1587 was made,
otherways 'tis probable this Form of Sum∣mons
would have been laid aside, and that of
personal Citation taken up; for which there
was the better Colour, that it was but follow∣ing
out the Plan laid down by <HI>Iames</HI> I. Up∣on
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
an edictal Citation, every Baron who has
a Seat is intitled to appear in Parliament, be∣cause
he is called. But by a personal Citation,
Opportunity is given to drop out of the List
any particular Baron the King is not pleased
with. Attendance in Parliament is a personal
Service, which cannot be performed by the
Vassal, unless the Superior chuse to accept of
it, and for this Reason it is not due, unless
demanded. A Baron therefore, who is not
called, cannot regularly take his Seat in Par∣liament.
This Matter is well understood in
<HI>England,</HI> where many Times the Advantage
has been laid hold of, which a personal Cita∣tion
gives the King. One remarkable Instance
there is in a Parliament conveened by King
<HI>Henry</HI> III. <HI>anno</HI> 1255, when a great many
Lords were omitted to be summoned who
were not in the King's Interest. Nor at this
Day do I know of any Remedy provided a∣gainst
the Evil, other than the Danger that
would arise to the Constitution, if Liberties
of this Kind were taken, which, tho' strictly
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
legal, could not fail to alarm the whole Na∣tion,
as evidently subversive of the Constitu∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">HONOUR. DIGNITY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no Appetite in human Na∣ture
more prevalent nor more univer∣sal,
than that for Honour and Respect. And
the Pleasure arising from it is of the most re∣fined
Kind; Honour and Respect being by
Nature, a voluntary Tribute paid to intrinsic
Merit. Hence it is, that no other Passion is na∣turally
more friendly to Virtue. But tho' all
Men are fond of Respect, the Bulk of Man∣kind,
unable or unwilling to purchase it at
such a Price as that of real Merit, endeavour
to secure it to themselves at a cheaper Rate.
Early Attempts were made to annex it to the
Possession of outward Advantages, and the
Law has been called in Aid to support the
artificial Connection. Thus, what ought to
be a Free-will Offering, is changed to a Mat∣ter
of Right. We lay Claim to Honour, as if
it were our Property, and as if, like Land or
Goods, we were intitled to it by Law. And
the World has improved so much upon this
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
indolent Scheme, that the different Degrees
of Respect and Honour are nicely adjusted by
Custom, both in Language and Behaviour,
“Qualities and Virtues being assigned to Per∣sons
of Rank, under the Titles of <HI>Graces,
Excellencies, Honours,</HI> and the rest of this
mock Praise and mimical Appellation,” as
is happily exprest by an eminent Author.</P>
<P>IN a moral View nothing can be more
pernicious than this artificial Connection, as
it robs Worth and Merit of their proper
Reward, to annex it to the Goods of For∣tune,
which without it have but too great In∣fluence.
But considering the Matter politi∣tically,
the fixing of artificial Marks of Worth,
which every one can discern, may be justifi∣ed.
Government could scarcely subsist with∣out
them. Real Merit is so remote from
vulgar Apprehension, that were Rulers to be
chosen by this Standard, Differences and Dis∣sensions
would be endless.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74"/>
HOWEVER this be, here arises a Distincti∣on
betwixt Respect bestowed from the Opi∣nion
of Merit, which may be called <HI>natural
Honour,</HI> and Respect bestowed upon the
Possessors of Power and Riches, which may
be called <HI>artificial Honour.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the Ancients, this artificial Ho∣nour
was but in its Infancy; yet in old <HI>Rome</HI>
we have a remarkable Instance of it. There
was a Division of the People into <HI>Nobiles,
Novi,</HI> and <HI>Ignobiles,</HI> taken from the Right of
using Pictures or Statues, an Honour allow∣ed
to such only whose Ancestors, or them∣selves,
had born some curule Office. He
who had the Pictures or Statues of his An∣cestors,
was termed <HI>Nobilis;</HI> he who had
only his own, <HI>Novus;</HI> he who had neither,
<HI>Ignobilis:</HI> So that <HI>jus imaginis</HI> was among
the old <HI>Romans</HI> like the Right of bearing a
Coat of Arms among us.</P>
<P>BUT this artificial Honour grew to a
greater Height in Course of Time. Besides
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
its Connection with the higher Offices in the
State, as among the <HI>Romans,</HI> it came to be an∣nexed
to large Territories, and at last rested
upon Families, without Regard to Land or
Office. This was the Case in all the <HI>Gothic</HI>
Constitutions, and to these two Branches I
shall confine myself, as they are the Founda∣tion
of our present Notions of Dignity and
Honour.</P>
<P>IN these <HI>Gothic</HI> Constitutions, Honour and
Dignity were originally annext to Lands and
Offices, and in no Case to Persons or Fami∣lies,
independent of Lands and Offices.</P>
<P>EARL or Count was the Name given to
the Governor of a Province. The Office
was of great Power and Authority, and could
not fail to have a considerable Share of Dig∣nity
annext to it. <HI>Basnage,</HI> in his Customs
of <HI>Normandy,</HI> observes, that Counts were
the ordinary Judges of Provinces, that under
<HI>Charles</HI> the Simple, they began to be heredi∣tary,
and that some few of them usurped the
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
Sovereignty. In the same Way an Earl in
<HI>England</HI> was the Judge or Governor of a
Shire, and his Office as well as Dignity for
Life only. <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror first made
the Office feudal and hereditary, allotting the
third Penny of all the Pleas determined in the
Sheriff's Court, for Support of the Office.
This Accession of Wealth and Dignity had
the ordinary Effect. Earls became too great
to submit to the Fatigue of Business. De∣putes
were appointed in every County, upon
whom was devolved all the Drudgery Work
of the Magistrate and Judge. And thus it
commonly happens, that the Person who
gets all the Pay, does nothing; while the Per∣son
who does all the Work, gets little or no
Pay. After the Introduction of these <HI>De∣putes,
Vicecomites</HI> or <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> an Earldom
was no longer considered as a territorial Of∣fice,
but as a territorial Dignity, which car∣rying
a good deal of Splendor with it, came
to be a desirable Object. As it no longer
had any Relation to a real County or She∣riffdom,
fictitious or imaginary Counties were
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
erected, in order to bestow the Title of <HI>Earl</HI>
upon the Possessors. And these Titles by
the Bounty of Princes, came to be multiplied
exceedingly; it being observed with Regard
to Ribbons, Titles, and such like Marks of
Distinction, which take nothing from the
Granter, that of all Favours, they are bestow∣ed
with the best Grace. Rare Invention, this,
to reconcile, in so happy a Manner, the Inte∣rests
of the Giver and Receiver.</P>
<P>IT is observed above, that in the <HI>Gothic</HI>
Constitutions, Honour and Dignity were an∣next
to Lands as well as to Offices. In <HI>En∣gland</HI>
a great Estate held of the King, with
Power of Jurisdiction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a <HI>Reddendo</HI>
of so many Knights to serve the King in his
Wars, commonly stiled <HI>a Barony,</HI> had Dig∣nity
or Honour annext to it; and from this
artificial Connection, it also got the Name of
<HI>an Honour,</HI> the Honour of <HI>Richmond,</HI> for Ex∣ample,
of <HI>Woodstock,</HI> &amp;c. And the Family
here was so little regarded, that whoever pur∣chased
such an Estate, with the King's Con∣sent,
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
to be held of the Crown, was of Course,
considered as a Baron, or Person of Honour.</P>
<P>ORIGINALLY the Union of Lands, erect∣ed
into an Earldom or Barony, was conceived
to be so intimate, that it became as it were an
identical Subject, not capable of Division or
Separation into Parts. And hence, in the old
Law of <HI>England,</HI> it was a Rule, that a Baro∣ny
could not be split into Parts, but that the
whole behoved to be aliened together.</P>
<P>BUT this being a strained Conception, re∣pugnant
to more plain and natural Ideas, e∣specially
where Parts of an Earldom or Ba∣rony
are locally distinct one from another,
Nature prevailed over Art, and disposing of
Parts of a Barony crept into Practice.</P>
<P>FOR some time after this Sort of Commerce
was introduced, territorial Honour was not
much affected by it. The Earldom or Ba∣rony
still remained in a great Measure entire
with the Dignity annexed to it. But when,
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
by the Arts of Peace, and Increase of Indu∣stry,
Lands came to be more universally the
Subject of Commerce, readily passing from
Hand to Hand, territorial Honour behoved
to be in an uncertain State. Let us suppose,
that an Earldom or Barony has been possessed
for Ages by the same Family. The Family
falling into Decay, the Estate is dismembered
Piece-mail, 'till little or nothing is left of it.
What is become, in the mean Time, of the
Dignity or Honour originally annexed to the
Estate? For the Estate being split into small
Parts, and possessed perhaps by mean Persons,
the Honour cannot follow any of the Parts.
Is the Idea then lost and gone? If it does sub∣sist,
where is the Object? The Answer is,
That it is transferred from the Estate to the
Family; and the Transition is easy and natu∣ral.
For tho' Possession of the Earldom or
Barony, is the Foundation of the Respect paid
to the Family, yet the Family being the im∣mediate
Object, Respect is paid by the Vul∣gar
without attending to the legal Title, and
is continued to be paid even after the Title is
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
gone. Thus in <HI>Germany,</HI> territorial Titles of
Honour are communicated to every Branch
of the Family, tho' possessed of no Land Pro∣perty;
and therefore, no Wonder, that in
<HI>Britain,</HI> they should remain with the chief
Branch of the Family, after the Estate is di∣lapidated.</P>
<P>ONE Thing did greatly contribute to change
the Nature of Honour, by transferring Ho∣nour
from Land to Families. It was <HI>Malcolm
Canmore,</HI> who, in Imitation of <HI>William</HI> the
Conqueror, introduced the territorial Digni∣ties
of Earl and Baron, which produced Sir∣names
not formerly in Use. <HI>Malcolmus ter∣tius,
sublato Maccabaeo Tyranno, Regnum le∣gittime
sibi debitum, occupavit, quod, ut or∣naret,
unicâ curâ incubuit; tunc et a Praediis
nobilibus nomina quisque sumpsit, et cum mag∣na
frequensque nobilitas S. Margaretam ex
Hungaria et Anglia secuta, in Scotia conse∣disset,
splendorem novo suo Principatui addi∣turus,
Barones et Comites creavit. Dempster,</HI>
p. 120. The Use of Sirnames had undoubt∣edly
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
the Effect to make a closer Union among
the several Parts of the compound Idea of a
Family, by binding all these Parts together
under one common Name; which tended to
facilitate the Connection betwixt a Family and
a Title of Honour, and made it as easy for
the Mind to rest upon a Family for the Ob∣ject
of Honour, as upon an Estate.</P>
<P>IT will be obvious, that this Change in
the Nature of Honour, from territorial to per∣sonal,
behoved to come on by Degrees. Even
after frequent Instances of the Title remain∣ing
with a Family, when the Estate was en∣tirely
or mostly dismembered, the Case would
be different, when the Earldom or Barony
was disponed whole and entire; for there the
Honour for many Ages, was certainly trans∣ferred
with the Estate. Opposite Instances
behoved to breed a Confusion and Darkness
in the Idea of Honour, being sometimes ap∣plied
to Lands, sometimes to Families, inde∣pendent
of Lands. The Mist is cleared up
by Course of Time. The Notion of territo∣rial
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
Honour is quite wore out, and at present
we have no Example of Honour, but what is
personal, and annexed to Families, indepen∣dent
of Land. I have heard of no Exception
in this Island, unless it be with relation to the
Castle of <HI>Arundel,</HI> which at the same Time
appears to be a doubtful Instance.</P>
<P>THO' territorial Honours be now at an End,
there remains one remarkable Consequence
of them, which is in full Observance. It
is a Maxim in Law, that the King is the
Fountain of Honour, and that it is the Pre∣rogative
of the Crown to bestow Honours
and Dignities of all Kinds. It is not difficult
to come at the Foundation of this Privilege.
Tho' it anciently was the Privilege of every
Superior to unite discontiguous Lands into
one artificial Subject, in favours of his Vassal;
no Superior could unite Lands into an Earl∣dom
or Barony, save the King, for a plain
Reason, that it is not called an Earldom or
Barony, unless it hold of the King. The
Honour which followed this Erection or Cre∣ation
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
was understood to flow from the King;
and as the King's Consent, <HI>qua</HI> Superior, is
requisite for transmitting an Earldom or Ba∣rony
to a Purchaser, hence the King came to
be considered as the Fountain of territorial
Honour, in the same Manner as he is the
Fountain of official Honour, by his Power
of appointing the Officers of the Crown.
Taking the Matter strictly, it was not the
King who bestowed the Honour, but the
People. Nothing flowed from the Crown,
but the Office or the Barony, which carrying
great Power and Preheminence, were natu∣rally
attended with Honour and Respect.
And supposing Honour to be a legal Acces∣sory
of a Barony or Office, it will not follow,
that the King can crete Honour, independent
of a Barony or Office, which would be crea∣ting
an Accessory without a Principal. But
our Forefathers were by no Means accurate in
their Conceptions: And from the King's
Power of bestowing the Means of acquiring
Honour, to infer a Power of bestowing Ho∣nour
independent of these Means, is no bet∣ter
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
Reasoning, than to infer a Man's Power
of bestowing Knowledge without any Means,
from his Power of bestowing Riches, which
are one good Mean to acquire Knowledge. Yet
upon this, and no better Foundation, is the
King's Power built, of bestowing personal or
Family Honours, when these, by Degrees,
came to be substituted in Place of the other.</P>
<P>AND thus a new Distinction was, by De∣grees,
introduced, betwixt Honour annexed
to Land or Office, and Honour annexed to
Persons, whether a single Person or Family.
And this latter Sort of artificial Honour, I
shall take the Liberty hereafter to call <HI>perso∣nal
Honour,</HI> tho' very different from that
Respect and Deference which is voluntarily
paid to certain Persons, from the Opinion of
real Worth.</P>
<P>THERE are preserved in <HI>England</HI> ma∣ny
old Charters of the Creation of Earls,
which uniformly run in the Stile of a Grant
of an Office. When by the Multiplication of
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
Earls beyond the Number of Sheriffdoms, an
Earldom sunk down to a mere territorial Dig∣nity,
the Stile of these Charters was varied,
and the common Form was to erect Lands
into an Earldom, in favours of the Grantee
and his Heirs, which was understood to be
all that was necessary to bestow upon him the
territorial Dignity. Afterwards, when the
Notion of personal Honour crept in, certain
Solemnities were used at the Creation of a
Peer, such as girding him with a Sword, co∣vering
his Head with a Cap of Honour and
Circle of Gold, all of them Marks of perso∣nal
Respect. And now, both in <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Scotland,</HI> the Notion of territorial Honour
being quite wore out, an Earl's Patent is so
framed, as to import a mere personal Digni∣ty,
without relation either to Office or to
Land.</P>
<P>WITH Regard to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the oldest Pa∣tent
of an Earl I have seen, is that granted to
<HI>Ranulph</HI> Earl of <HI>Murray.</HI> King <HI>Robert</HI> I.
grants certain Lands to him, and to the Heirs-male
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
of his Body, to be held of the Crown
<HI>in libero comitatu.</HI> As no other Form or Ce∣remony
was used in creating this Gentleman
an Earl, the Charter is full Evidence, that in
those Days the Title of an Earl was conside∣red
as merely a territorial Dignity. A Copy
of the Charter is annext for the Satisfaction
of the curious. Another Charter I have read
of by King <HI>David</HI> II. “in Favours of Sir
<HI>Malcolm Fleming</HI> Knight, and of the Heirs-male
of his Body, for his Homage and
worthy Services, of the Lands of <HI>Farynes,
Deall, Rynos,</HI> and the Burgh of <HI>Wigtoun,</HI>
with their whole Pertinents, and all the
King's Lands of the whole Sheriffdom
of <HI>Wigtoun,</HI> with the Advocation of the
Churches, and Right of Patronage of the
Monasteries and Abbacies existing within
the Sheriffdom; reserving to his Majesty the
Right of Patronage of the Episcopal See of
<HI>Whytehorn</HI> or <HI>Galloway.</HI> And also because
the said Place of <HI>Wigtoun</HI> was lookt upon as
the principal Mannor of the whole She∣riffdom
of <HI>Wigtoun,</HI> the King ordained,
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
that the said <HI>Malcolm</HI> and his Heirs should
for ever take the Name of <HI>Earl,</HI> and be
called the Earls of <HI>Wigtoun.</HI> Further, the
said Lands are erected into a free Regality,
with Power to judge upon the four Ar∣ticles
of the Crown. The said Earl and
his Heirs giving the Service of five Knights
or Soldiers to the King's Army. Dated
at <HI>Airth,</HI> 9th <HI>November,</HI> 1343.” This
Creation of the Earl of <HI>Wigtoun</HI> I have chose
the rather to mention, because of one no∣table
Circumstance which demonstrates the
Notion entertained in these Days of this Dig∣nity,
that it was merely territorial, and went
along with the Lands to the Purchaser, in the
same Manner that the Dignity of a Baron by Te∣nure
did. Upon the 16th <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1371, a Char∣ter
is granted by <HI>Thomas Fleming</HI> Earl of <HI>Wig∣toun,</HI>
to <HI>Archibald</HI> of <HI>Douglas</HI> Knight of <HI>Gal∣loway,</HI>
“Whereby, for the Feuds betwixt
him and the great Men, and Inhabitants of
the Earldom of <HI>Wigtoun,</HI> and for 500 <HI>l.
Sterling</HI> paid him, he dispones to the said
<HI>Archibald</HI> the foresaid Earldom with the
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
Pertinents.” This Charter was confirm∣ed
by <HI>Robert</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> 8th <HI>Fe∣bruary,</HI>
1371. After this Alienation of the
Earldom, <HI>Thomas Fleming</HI> was no longer
considered as an Earl, of which among other
Writs the following Charter is full Evidence,
granted by <HI>Robert</HI> II. in which “he con∣firms
a Charter granted by the said <HI>Ro∣bert
Fleeming,</HI> designed Laird of <HI>Fullwood,</HI>
to <HI>William Boyd,</HI> of a Wadset of all the said
<HI>Thomas Fleming</HI>'s Lands within the Baro∣ny
of <HI>Lenzie,</HI> for 80 <HI>l. Sterling.</HI>” The
principal Charter is dated at <HI>Cumbernauld,</HI>
1372, and the Charter of Confirmation at
<HI>Kinghorn,</HI> 20th <HI>Iune,</HI> 1375. Further, that
the said <HI>Archibald Douglas</HI> Knight of <HI>Gal∣loway,</HI>
did, after the Purchase of the Earl∣dom,
take upon him the Title of Earl of
<HI>Wigtoun,</HI> appears by a Charter of Confir∣mation
still extant, granted by him to <HI>Chri∣stian
Ramsay,</HI> of the Lands of <HI>Balencrief</HI> and
<HI>Gosford,</HI> dated 6th <HI>March</HI> 1422, which runs
thus, <HI>Omnibus hanc chartam visuris vel au∣dituris,
Archibaldus de Douglas, Comes de
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
Wigtoun, ac primogenitus filius et heres mag∣nifici
et potentis Domini, Domini progenito∣ris
nostri, Domini Archibaldi Comitis de Dou∣glas,
Domini Galwidiae et vallis Annandiae,
salutem, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is little Doubt of the gradual
Transition, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as in <HI>England,</HI>
from the Notion of territorial to that of per∣sonal
Dignity; and the Stiles of our latest
Patents in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as in <HI>England,</HI>
are expressive of nothing else but personal
Honour.</P>
<P>PROCEED we now to a more particular
Examination of the Dignity of Lord Baron.
In <HI>England,</HI> three sorts of Barons are taken
Notice of by Writers, Barons by <HI>Tenure,</HI>
Barons by <HI>Writ,</HI> and Barons by <HI>Creation.</HI>
Barons by Tenure are they who derive their
Dignity and Privileges from their Lands, the
same who are described above, under the
Name of <HI>territorial Barons.</HI> Barons by
Writ came to have a Being after the smaller
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
Barons and Freeholders were exempted from
their Attendance in Parliament. The Ex∣emption
was granted in <HI>England,</HI> as well as
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with a reserved Power to the
King to require the Attendance of any of
them in Parliament, when he should see
Cause. This was done by a special Writ, di∣rected
by the King to the small Baron or
Freeholder, whose Presence was required,
and who was not otherwise bound to attend
the Parliament. But as this Writ, whether
we consider the Nature or Tenor of it, was
fulfilled by the Person's Attendance in that
particular Parliament to which he was called;
leaving him to enjoy his Privilege of Exemp∣tion
from other Parliaments, when the Sum∣mons
was not renewed, it does not readily
occur why this Writ should be thought to
bestow any Degree of Nobility, whether per∣sonal
or feudal. And supposing it did, the
Person thus summoned to Parliament was still
a Baron by Tenure; because none could be
subjected to this Summons, but those who
held of the King <HI>in capite.</HI> This Distincti∣on
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
therefore is little to be regarded, and ac∣cordingly
we have no Traces of it in our <HI>Scots</HI>
Antiquities.</P>
<P><HI>BARONS by Patent are those who are cre∣ated
by the King, Barons and Lords of Parli∣ament.
It is agreed among Authors, that the
first Instance of this Kind upon Record is in
the Days of</HI> Richard <HI>II. who in the Year</HI>
1387, <HI>created</HI> Iohn Beauchamp <HI>of</HI> Holt, <HI>Ba∣ron
of</HI> Kiderminster, <HI>and Lord of Parlia∣ment.
The Patent is in the following Words,</HI>
Rex, &amp;c. salutem. Sciatis quod pro bono ser∣vitio
quod dilectus et fidelis Miles noster Io∣annes
de Beauchamp de Holte, Senescallus Ho∣spitii
nostri, nobis impendit, ipsum Ioannem in
unum Parium et Baronum Regni nostri Angliae
praefecimus, volentes quod idem Ioannes, et
haeredes masculi de corpore suo exeuntes, sta∣tum
Baronis obtineant, ac Domini de Beau∣champ,
et Barones de Kiderminster nuncupen∣tur.
In cujus, &amp;c. Dat. 10. Octob. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92"/>
I HAVE given this Patent at large, that
the Nature of the Grant may be the better
understood; and it merits Attention, because,
by creating Earls without Relation to a Coun∣ty,
and Barons without Relation to a Barony,
Foundation was laid for a great Change in
the Constitution of Parliament, though the
Consequence was probably not attended to
in the Beginning. The Parliament was ori∣ginally
made up of the King's Vassals, and
the King had no Power to bring any Person
into Parliament, who did not hold of him in
chief. By the Multiplication of Earls be∣yond
the Number of Counties, which was
begun upon the Fiction of erecting a Castle,
or a Mannor into a County, and afterwards
carried on without that Form, the Title of
<HI>Earl</HI> came to be considered as a personal Dig∣nity;
and now here was another Dignity
invented, by creating a Man a Baron and Lord
of Parliament; which, tho' it was probably
at first bestowed upon Barons by Tenure,
came afterwards to be bestowed upon all Per∣sons
indifferently, without Regard to Land.
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
An Earl originally was intitled to sit in Parlia∣ment,
as the King's immediate Vassal, and
a Baron upon the same Footing. But now,
as the King, by gradually diverging from the
original Constitution, has acquired by long
Use, the Privilege of making an Earl with∣out
a County, and a Lord of Parliament
without a Barony, it may happen some time
hereafter, that the House of Peers shall be
filled with Men who have little or no Pro∣perty
in Land. It must be acknowledged,
that seldom has the Peerage been bestowed
but upon Men of opulent Fortunes. But as
the Crown is under no Restraint in this Par∣ticular,
we owe it more to the Goodness of
our Sovereigns, than of our Constitution, that
the House of Peers is composed of Members
who, if they are not intirely independent,
have themselves more to blame than their
Circumstances.</P>
<P>THO' the above Diploma is the oldest that
is upon Record, it follows not, that it is the
first of the Kind. The Stile of the Diploma
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
rather argues an established Practice, as it is
not introduced with any Preamble, importing
a new Dignity. At what Time then, by
whom, and upon what Occasion was this new
Class of Peerage invented, is uncertain. It
may appear hard to be conceived at first View,
what could be the Intendment of it. In the
Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. and for a long Time be∣fore,
none but the greater Barons attended the
Parliament, the lesser Barons and Freeholders
appearing by their Representatives. Now to
what Purpose could it be, to create a great Ba∣ron,
Lord of Parliament, who was intitled alrea∣dy
to that Privilege. And if the Honour was
designed for a lesser Baron or Freeholder, it
was sufficient to call him to Parliament by a
special Writ. But when the Matter is more
attentively considered, there will be found
probable Reasons for introducing of this Dig∣nity.
The Commerce of Land, begun some
Centuries before, was greatly increased in the
1387. A Barony by Tenure, which was o∣riginally
a permanent Dignity in a Family,
was no longer considered as such, after fre∣quent
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
Instances of the Transmission of these
Dignities from Hand to Hand, in the Way
of Commerce. The Dignity which was con∣siderable,
while it was confined to certain Fa∣milies,
fell in its Value, after it came to be
exposed to Sale, with the Barony to which it
was annexed. This made People aim at some
external Mark of Honour, which should be
permanent in their Families, as Baronies had
been of old. And this was effectuated, by
creating them and their Heirs Barons, and
Lords of Parliament; for here the Dignity
and Privilege being bestowed upon a Family,
and not upon Land as formerly, was inherent
in the Family, and behoved to subsist as long
as the Family subsisted. Nor did this Inven∣tion
require any great Stretch of Fancy: For,
at this Period, and before, the Notion of per∣sonal
Honours had gained Ground, by the
frequent Examples of Earls created, with a
very slight Relation to Property.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Scotland,</HI> where there has been all a∣long
a closs Imitation of <HI>English</HI> Customs,
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
the Dignity of Lord of Parliament was early
introduced; at what precise Period we know
not: We are only certain, that this Dignity
was possessed by many Families, before the
Reign of our <HI>Iames</HI> I. The Act so often
mentioned, exempting the small Barons and
Freeholders from Attendance in Parliament,
is sufficient Evidence, since it contains a Re∣gulation,
“That Bishops, Abbots, Priors,
Dukes, Earls, LORDS OF PARLIAMENT
and Banrents, be summoned to Parliament
by special Precept.” Whether Patents were
originally used in the Creation of our Lords of
Parliament, is not certain. I incline to think
they were not used, because I have seen no
such Patent before the Days of <HI>Iames</HI> VI.
Probably there was no other Form used but
what is contained in the Records of Parlia∣ment,
bearing, that the King, in full Parlia∣ment,
created such a Man, and certain Heirs
mentioned, Lords of Parliament, and ordain∣ed
him to be stiled <HI>Lord A. B.</HI> of <HI>C. D.</HI> the
ordinary Form being to annex <HI>Lord</HI> to the
Sirname, with the Addition of the Name
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
of the Estate, connected by the Particle <HI>of;</HI>
for Example, Lord <HI>Lindsay</HI> of <HI>Byres,</HI> Lord
<HI>Stewart</HI> of <HI>Ochiltree.</HI> I must further observe,
that if Lords of Parliament were created a∣mong
us without a Patent, the Ceremony
must have been performed in Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Barons, by Creation called <HI>Lords of
Parliament,</HI> were distinguished in common
Language from the Barons by Tenure, by be∣ing
called <HI>Lords,</HI> such as, Lord <HI>Erskine,</HI> Lord
<HI>Borthwick,</HI> Lord <HI>Seaton,</HI> &amp;c. whereas Barons
by Tenure were called <HI>Lairds;</HI> for Example,
the Laird of <HI>Dundas,</HI> the Laird of <HI>Calder,</HI>
the Laird of <HI>Luss,</HI> &amp;c. Because there is no
<HI>Latin</HI> Word for a Laird, the Barons by
Tenure were called <HI>Domini,</HI> as well as the
Lords of Parliament were. But then to express
the Difference, the following Forms were
constantly observed. If a Laird, or Baron
by Tenure, was meant to be exprest, it was
in this Manner, <HI>Dominus de Calder, Dominus
de Balwirie, Dominus de Luss,</HI> &amp;c. But Lords
of Parliament were exprest by leaving out
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
the Article, thus, <HI>Dominus Erskine, Dominus
Seaton, Dominus Borthwick.</HI> For Illustrati∣on's
Sake, I have annex'd a Copy of the Roll
of the Parliament 1471, containing, <HI>1mo,</HI> A
List of the Bishops who appeared in that Par∣liament;
<HI>2dly,</HI> Of the Abbots; <HI>3dly,</HI> Of the
Earls; <HI>4thly,</HI> Of the Lords of Parliament;
<HI>5thly,</HI> Of the Barons by Tenure; and <HI>lastly,</HI>
Of the Commissioners for the Burrows.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that the Lords of Parliament
had no greater Power or Privilege in Parlia∣ment
than the Barons by Tenure had; yet
as it was understood to be the King's Inten∣tion,
in creating a Lord of Parliament, to
exalt the Person honoured to a Rank above
that of a Baron by Tenure, the Nation has
all along submitted implicitely to the King's
Will, as most Nations do with Regard to
Titles of Honour bestowed by the Sovereign.
And there are two Circumstances which pro∣bably
have had an Influence to heighten the
Respect paid in Consequence of such Creati∣ons.
The Attendance of a Baron by Te∣nure
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
in Parliament, is a Service, and not a
Matter of Right; whereas, when one is cre∣ated
Lord of Parliament, the Power of atten∣ding
Parliaments is bestowed upon him as a
Privilege. The other Circumstance must
have had still a greater Weight in the Ima∣gination.
The Honour of a Baron by Te∣nure
was annex'd to the Land, and went
with it to the Purchaser of the Barony along
with the Jurisdiction, and its other Accesso∣ries.
The frequent Transmission of Baro∣nies
from Hand to Hand, with the Honours
annex'd, could not fail to depretiate the Dig∣nity,
in the Opinion of all Men. A Man
who, after passing many Years in an obscure
Rank, purchases an Honour with his Mo∣ney,
must lay his Account, for some time,
not to have great Respect paid him. And
tho' the Respect paid to an old Family, will
run on a long Time after the Family-Estate
is gone; yet it must dwindle by Degrees,
'till the Family at last be lost in the common
Herd. It will be obvious, from these Con∣siderations,
that territorial Honour could not
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
long stand its Ground after the Commerce of
Land was introduced, and it will be equal∣ly
obvious, that this Circumstance behoved
to add a great Lustre to the Dignity of a
Lord of Parliament, which was annexed to
the Family, and inseparable from it. Ac∣cordingly,
after the Lords of Parliament were
multiplied by frequent Creations, the Ba∣rons
by Tenure, who made no Figure in
Comparison, tired of the Expence of atten∣ding
Parliaments, without any Return ei∣ther
of Profit or Honour, withdrew by De∣grees.
In latter Times, the Barons by Te∣nure,
who attended Parliaments, were most∣ly
the eldest Sons of the Nobility, infeft in
Lands, to intitle them to a Seat there. And
in Fact, for forty Years before the 1587,
there is not to be found in the Rolls of Par∣liament,
a single Instance of a Baron by Te∣nure
attending the Parliament.</P>
<P>IT was in this Year 1587, that the Statute
of <HI>Iames</HI> I. of <HI>Scotland</HI> was revived, requiring
the lesser Barons to send Commissioners to Par∣liament;
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
and so little Regard was had to Ba∣rons
by Tenure in this Act, that by an ex∣press
Clause, “All Freeholders of the King,
under the Degree of Prelates and <HI>Lords
of Parliament,</HI> are to be warned by Pro∣clamation
to be present at the chusing of these
Commissioners.” It was this Act then,
which gave the finishing Blow to Barons by
Tenure, by depriving them of their Seat in
Parliament, and thereby reducing them to
the Rank of small Barons and Freeholders,
who have no other Privilege, but to send Re∣presentatives
to Parliament: And hence a
<HI>Scotch</HI> Laird has come to be in some Measure
a Term of Reproach, like a <HI>French</HI> Marquis,
or a <HI>German</HI> Baron.</P>
<P>IT remains only to be examined, by what
Means it happened, that the Commerce of
Land, which has quite annihilated the Ho∣nour
of a Baron by Tenure, had not the same
Effect with regard to the Dignity of an Earl.
It is clear from what is above said, that both
of them were once territorial Dignities, and
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
that when the Estate was aliened, the Dig∣nity
went along with it. We may readily be∣lieve,
that the Dignity of an Earl was pretty
much obscured, by this Means, as well as
that of a Baron; and we have Tradition to
confirm us in this Opinion. Yet after perso∣nal
Honour was introduced, whereby we
came to separate the Dignity from the Estate,
the Title of Earl was in greater Repute, while
that of Laird, which was the Title of a Ba∣ron
by Tenure, dwindled away to nothing.
When this Matter is considered, a ready So∣lution
will occur. The Introduction of that
new Class of Nobility, called <HI>the Lords of
Parliament,</HI> which had the Effect to over∣shadow
and obscure the Barons by Tenure,
plainly contributed to exalt the Earls. Place
and Precedency work strongly upon the Ima∣gination,
because they are public and palpable
Marks of Respect. The Barons by Tenure,
such of them who had the greatest Estates, or
were most remarkable for the Figure they
made in the Country, were generally called
to be Lords of Parliament; some of them
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
were more highly exalted, being made Earls.
The Body of territorial Barons being thus im∣poverished,
by the frequent Draughts made
out of it, came to be little respected. They
by Degrees withdrew from Parliament, as
finding nothing there to answer the Expence
of Attendance; and they were excluded alto∣gether
by the Act 1587, which in these Cir∣cumstances
could not, at any Rate, be rec∣koned
a Hardship, and possibly was carried
through with their Consent or Good-liking.
The Removal of the Barons by Tenure from
the Parliament, behoved to add a Lustre to
the Lords of Parliament, and still a greater
Lustre to the Earls, who took Place of them.
And as by this Time, an Earldom was con∣sidered
as a Family Dignity, as well as was
a Baronage by Creation, the Earls could not
fail to preserve their superior Rank in the
Minds of the People, as well as they did in
the Rolls of Parliameut.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Upon SUCCESSION or DESCENT.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SUCCESSION, or the Transmission of E∣states
from the Dead to the Living, is a
Subject which makes a great Figure in Histo∣ry,
as well as in Law. It is a Subject full of
Curiosity; for, depending mostly upon re∣mote
Principles of the Imagination, it shows,
in a Multitude of Instances, how much we
are governed by Feelings, which, abstractly
considered, appear to be of the weakest Sort.
One Effect of this indeed is, that there is no
such Thing as universal Rules of Succession.
Different Maxims are not only embraced in
different Countries, but have been established in
the same Country at different Periods: So that
Succession, like the Fashion, has hitherto been
in a constant Fluctuation. We are apt to think,
that the Rules are now ultimately settled with∣out
Fear of Change. But so, in all Probabili∣ty,
did our Fore-fathers, three of four Centuries
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
ago; for 'tis a common Mistake, from any
short Specimen, to infer a constant Unifor∣mity.
However this be, 'tis of great Use to
trace the Rules of Succession through their
different Changes. A Lawyer possibly may
think his Stock of Knowledge sufficient, if
he can point out the Rules which obtain at
present in his own Country. But a Man who
knows no more of the Matter, cannot form
any clear Judgment about many old Trans∣actions
of the greatest Importance. In the
History of <HI>England,</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and indeed of most <HI>European</HI> Nations, we
meet with frequent Disputes about the Suc∣cession
of Kingdoms, and of other Sovereign∣ties,
which we are altogther at a Loss to
comprehend, because such Disputes cannot
exist at this Day. Who imagines that a se∣cond
Son or Daughter can have any Pretensi∣ons
to a Crown, so long as there are Issue ex∣isting
of the eldest: Yet this very Thing was
made a Question of in the famous Trial about
the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> betwixt <HI>Bruce</HI> and
<HI>Baliol.</HI> We are apt to imagine, that a se∣cond
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
Son, who puts in so idle a Claim, has
other Arguments to support himself with,
than what are founded in the Laws of his
Country: not considering that the Right of
Representation, tho' now generally establish∣ed,
was but creeping into Practice in those
Days. In former Ages the Right of Repre∣sentation
was not so much as dreamed of;
Witness <HI>Lewis,</HI> the second Son of <HI>Charlemain,</HI>
called to the Succession of the Crown of
<HI>France,</HI> when there was an elder Brother's
Son existing. Instances of this Nature, and
there are Multitudes of them, make it evi∣dent,
how necessary a Qualification it is in a
Historian to be acquainted with the Laws
and Antiquities of the Country he writes of.
Is it not surprising, that Father <HI>Daniel,</HI> in his
History of <HI>France,</HI> gives the above Account of
the Succession of <HI>Charlemain,</HI> without making
the least Reflection upon it, as if it were an
ordinary Event, which needed no Comment?
So dry an Historian cannot fail to perplex
his Readers. Perhaps the Father was himself
perplexed, and chose to hide his Ignorance by
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
his Silence. <HI>Rapin</HI> is a most judicious Hi∣storian,
but he is frequently at a Loss, thro'
want of a sufficient Knowledge of the Con∣stitution
of <HI>England.</HI> His Book contains
many Instances of disputed Successions, where
the Facts are stated with great Accuracy.
But an intelligent Reader will perceive, that
he is almost always at a Loss when he endea∣vours
to set forth the Merits of the Cause,
which must be the Case with an Author
who is not intimately acquainted with the
Notions of Succession entertained in the Age,
and in the Country he writes of. The fol∣lowing
Account of the Matter is therefore
given with a View to answer the Purposes of
History as well as of Law.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1">
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER Property was introduced, and had
gained a firm Establishment, the Mat∣ter
of Succession could not be long neglect∣ed.
The Death of the very first Man who
acquired Property, must have given Occasion
to the Question, who was to succeed him?
If his Will was declared upon the Point, no
Doubt could be that it was the Rule<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Author is aware, that while Property was in its Infancy, it was doubted whether a Man's Will, in whatever Manner declared, could have the Effect to regulate his Succes∣sion. But when the Thing is attended to, it will be sound to resolve into a Dispute about the Nature of Property. Occu∣pation is allowed to have been the first Foundation of Property in Land. When a Piece of Ground was taken out of the Com∣mon, and cultivated by the Occupier for the Use of himself and Family, it soon came to be settled, that this Person was to have the undisturbed Possession for his Life; otherways farewell to Labour and Industry. But as his Interest in the Subject behoved to die with himself, it was not readily conceived how his Power over the Subject should continue after his Interest was at an End, or at any Rate subsist after he was dead and gone. But this Dif∣ficulty was plainly owing to the limited Notion of Property, which was entertained after its first Introduction. In early Times Property was not much distinguished from what is now called <HI>usufruct.</HI> No more was conceived in Property, but the unlimited Use of the Subject. But Experience poin∣ted out a more extensive Idea of Property. Mankind are fond of Power, especially over what is their own; and it came to be considered as an unreasonable Hardship, after Industry be∣stowed in acquiring and improving a Field, that the Occupier should not have it in his Power to dispose of it at his Pleasure. The Power of Disposal was relished, and became Law, because it was every one's Interest that it should be Law. And when once this Power was understood, it came by Degrees to be ex∣tended the utmost Length it was capable of, Thus <HI>Grotius, Lib. 2. Cap. 6. Sect. 14. Possum enim rem meam alienare non pure modo sed et sub conditione: nec tantum irrevocabiliter, sed et revocabiliter, atque etiam retenta interim possessione et plenis∣simo fruendi jure. Alienatio autem in mortis eventum, ante e∣am revocabilis, retento interim jure possidendi ac fruendi, est testamentum.</HI> Therefore, when we read of ancient Laws among particular Nations, introducing the Power of making a Testa∣ment, we must not consider these Laws as bestowing peculiar Privileges, but only as authorising a Practice which was the Consequence of an enlarged Idea of Property.</NOTE>. If
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
the Estate was left <HI>in medio,</HI> without a Will to
direct the Succession, his Children for whom
he was bound to provide, would natural∣ly
be suggested to the Mind. This pointed
out the primary Rule of Succession, that Chil∣dren
succeed <HI>ab intestato.</HI> But what if there
are no Children? 'Tis but following out the
same Rule, to pitch upon the nearest Relati∣on.
For after a Man's Death, his Children
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
or other Relations, will be considered as ha∣ving
a closer Connection with his Effects than
Strangers; and, by a natural Transition of I∣deas,
the Property, that was in the Deceased,
will be readily transferred to his Kindred.</P>
<P>CHILDREN, as having the closest Connec∣tion,
come to be considered in the first Place,
and here a subtile Question occurs, Whe∣ther,
by the Law of Nature, Daughters are
intitled to succeed equally with Sons? One
Thing is clear, that wherever the Notions of
a Family have got firm Footing, Female Suc∣cession
must be excluded, since a Woman
by Marriage making a Part of her Husband's
Family, cannot readily carry on the Idea of
that of her Father. But the Notions of a
Family are the Consequence of Male Succes∣sion,
and are not suggested by any natural
Principle. If we lay aside the Notions of a Fa∣mily,
Propinquity must also be laid aside, which
throws an equal Weight into either Scale.
What readily occurs after this, to determine
the Question, is, that Women stand in Need
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
of Food and Raiment as well as Men do, and
are equally capable of enjoying Riches. It is
true, that the Male has among all Nations, and
at all Times, been esteemed the <HI>dignior per∣sona.</HI>
But this Consideration can never be
of Weight to thrust out Females altogether,
and once admitting them into a Share, they
must have an equal Share, as there are no
possible <HI>Data</HI> in this Case to fix any other
Proportion.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find this Rule obser∣ved
among all Nations, with regard to Succes∣sion
in Moveables. In most Countries Females
have been excluded from succeeding to Lands.
But this was the Effect of distingishing Man∣kind
into Tribes and Families, which, tho' not
original in Nature, crept pretty early in. It
was evidently so among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and among
the <HI>Romans,</HI> where the Distinction betwixt
Tribes and Families was so remarkably pre∣served,
that by Law a Person of one Tribe
could not succeed to one of another. And
in other Countries where these Distinctions
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
were not so much attended to, War in early
Times being the principal Occupation, and
Land the principal Object of Conquest, it
was natural that Males only should have the
Possession of Land, which they only could
defend. But even in this Case, it must be
observed, that the whole Sons succeeded e∣qually,
which was departing as little from the
Law of Nature, as the Circumstances of the
Case would allow.</P>
<P>THE Right of Primogeniture was a Crea∣ture
of the Feudal Law. The Possession, not
the Property of Land, was given for personal
Service; and when it came to be the Practice
to extend such Grants in favours of Children,
the Master or Superior having no Claim but
to one Man's Service, the eldest Son came
readily into the Father's Place. For as in
tracing out a Family, the Mind descends by
Degrees from the Father, first to the eldest
Son, and so downwards in the Order of Age;
the eldest Son, where but one can take, is
the first who presents himself. And as the
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
Feudal Law gained Ground, and spread itself
over all <HI>Europe,</HI> the Right of Primogeniture
came by Degrees to be a general Rule in the
Succession to Land Estates, which were held
by military Service.</P>
<P>AS this was evidently the Reason for pre∣ferring
the eldest Son in a military Feu, the
same Reason, in my Apprehension, behoved
to take Place in Burgage Lands, which being
given for the Service of Watching and Ward∣ing,
if one only was bound to perform the
Service, the eldest Son was the Person. But
Soccage Tenure stood upon a different Foot∣ing.
Where the Possession of Lands is given
to a Man, not for personal Service, but upon
Condition of delivering to the Master yearly
a certain Quantity of Corn, or of other Fruits,
which are the Produce of the Ground, there
appears no good Reason why the Benefit of
such a Contract, if there is any Benefit from
it, should not accresce to all the Family e∣qually.
And yet, so far as we can discover,
Sons were always preferred to Daughters in
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
the Succession of Soccage Lands. All I have
to suggest is, That in Times of Ignorance and
Barbarity, when Strength of Body and per∣sonal
Courage are the only Virtues, Women
are little regarded. And the Practice of de∣barring
them altogether from Succession to
military Feus, which made the Bulk of the
Property of the Nation, did probably pave
the Way for preferring the Males to the Suc∣cession
of other Estates. This Conjecture ap∣pears
natural enough; but it is more difficult
to be explained, by what Means it has hap∣pened,
that the equal Succession of Males in
the Soccage Tenure has gone quite into De∣suetude,
and given Place to the Right of Pri∣mogeniture.
This Revolution is not taken
Notice of by our Historians, nor accounted
for by our Lawyers. One Thing is certain,
that Equality among Males, in the Descent of
Soccage Lands, was in Vigour so late as the
<HI>Regiam Majestatem.</HI> See <HI>R. M. L. 2. C.</HI> 27.
We must venture another Conjecture here.
After the Days of <HI>David</HI> II. during whose
Reign the <HI>Regiam Majestatem</HI> was composed,
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
peaceable Times brought on new Manners.
Riches came to be in greater Request than
military Prowess, and many Superiors were
willing to take Rent in Place of Service. This,
in some Measure, confounded the Distinction
betwixt Military and Soccage Tenures, so as
by Degrees to make one Rule serve for the
Succession in both. And as Military Feus
were by far the most frequent, the Right of
Primogeniture, which took Place in most
Cases, became at last universal.</P>
<P>BUT we are not yet at an End with the
Difficulties which arise from this Branch of
our Subject. Tho' the Succession to Soccage
Lands came after this Manner to be confined
to the eldest Son; yet no Alteration was made
in the Female Succession; Females continued
to succeed all equally, and do so at this Day.
This at first Sight must appear whimsical, and
not readily to be accounted for. If the Right
of Primogeniture was so universal a Principle,
how came it to stop short, and not to obtain
in every Case? And 'tis evident, where there
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
are Daughters only, that the Mind, in tracing
out the Line, descends to the eldest, as natu∣rally
as to the eldest Son, where there are
Male Issue. Among the many Grounds of
false Reasoning, there is not one more com∣mon,
than from some slight or accidental Re∣lation
to form an Analogy betwixt two Things
that are very different in other Respects. The
bad Effect of which is, that the Mind, intent
to compleat the Analogy, has a Tendency to
equiparate them in every Circumstance. 'Tis
probable, that the Soccage Tenure was not
far behind the Military Tenure in Point of
Time; and if so, the Rules of its Succession
were settled before the Right of Primogeni∣ture
came to take such fast hold of the Mind,
as to be reckoned a Sort of natural Principle.
Accordingly we find, that tho' Males were
preferred, yet in other Respects the Law of
Nature took Place, by calling the Males all
equally; and failing them, the Females. But
this Circumstance we must attend to, that
tho', in Progress of Time the Right of Primo∣geniture
came to be established as a general
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
Law, and in some Sort as a natural Principle;
yet there was no Example of this Right tak∣ing
Place, except among Males. It was this
very Consideration, in all Appearance, which
led our Forefathers, in their superficial Rea∣sonings,
to lean to the Right of Primogeni∣ture
in all Cases of Male Succession, without
thinking of encroaching upon the established
Rules of Female Succession. Not at all at∣tentive
to what is fundamental in this Matter,
in the <HI>first</HI> Place, that the Right of Primoge∣niture
depended upon the Nature of the Mi∣litary
Holding, which therefore could not
with any Shew of Reason be extended to Hold∣ings
of a different Kind; And, in the <HI>second</HI>
Place, That if the Privilege of Primogeniture
was to be the sole Rule, it ought to have Place
in the Succession of Females, as well as of
Males.</P>
<P>AFTER the Feudal Law came to a Stan∣dard,
the Succession in Military Feus was re∣gularly
extended to the Male Descendents of
the original Vassal, and after these were all
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
exhausted, the Fee returned to the Superior.
There was no Place for collateral Succession.
It might happen, that Collaterals to the de∣ceased
Vassal did succeed, but it was not <HI>qua</HI>
Collaterals, but <HI>qua</HI> Heirs-male of the Body
of the original Vassal. See <HI>L. feud. T.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>IN handling a Subject, where we have so
few Principles to direct us, and where these
Principles are not of the firmest Sort, 'tis no
Wonder that Difficulties crowd in on every
Side. So far we have proceeded upon a rea∣sonable
Foundation, that in the Succession of
Military Feus, Preference is given to the el∣dest
Son. But now the Question is, Whe∣ther
this Privilege is to be extended to his
Male Issue? A Military Vassal dies leaving
Issue a younger Son, and a Grandson by his
eldest Son, the Doubt is, Whether the Son
or Grandson is Heir: The Son is undoubted∣ly
the nearest in Blood, and therefore, by the
Law of Nature, ought to be preferred; and
accordingly this appears to have been the Law
in the Days of <HI>Charlemain,</HI> whose second Son
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
<HI>Lewis</HI> was called to the Succession as lawful
Heir, tho' <HI>Charlemain</HI> had by his eldest Son
a Grandson of perfect Age, when the Suc∣cession
opened. On the other hand, the Cir∣cumstances
of the Grandson are to be consi∣sidered.
He is born, and perhaps educated,
with the Prospect of succeeding to the Estate,
after the Death first of his Grandfather, and
then of his Father. It cannot but be consi∣dered
as a Hardship to be deprived at once of
all his Hopes, by the unexpected Accident of
his Father's Death before that of his Grand∣father.
Such are the Circumstances which
weigh against one another; and therefore no
Wonder to find the most sensible Writers ta∣king
different Sides in a Question so dubious.
Perhaps there is not one Question in Law,
which has afforded a greater Field, not only
for Law-suits, but for bloody and cruel Wars.
The Historians of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> are full
of Instances of this Kind. And the celebrated
Struggle about the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> be∣twixt
<HI>Bruce</HI> and <HI>Baliol,</HI> had no other Foun∣dation.
<HI>Baliol</HI> was descended of the eldest
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
Sister, <HI>Bruce</HI> only of the second. But then
it was urged in Behalf of the latter, that he
was one Degree nearer to the common Stock
than his Competitor, and consequently nearer
in Blood. This Matter is now settled, and
has been for Ages in favours of the Descen∣dents
of the eldest. But it was in some Mea∣sure
reckoned a doubtful Case, even so late
as the Time when the <HI>Regiam Majestatem</HI> was
composed, as will appear from the 33 Chap∣ter
of the second Book.</P>
<P>IT has been disputed, whether the same
Rule ought to hold in the Succession of Col∣laterals.
The Ground of the Doubt is, That
as a Man is never without Hopes of Issue,
none of his Collaterals can be born or educa∣ted
with the Hopes of succeeding to him.
This Circumstance being removed, which
preponderates in the former Case, it may be
thought, that there is nothing to weigh a∣gainst
the Right of the nearest Agnat. Up∣on
this Ground it was, that after the Death
of <HI>Henry</HI> III. of <HI>France,</HI> the League set up
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
up the Cardinal of <HI>Bourbon</HI> as Heir of the
Crown, against his Nephew the King of <HI>Na∣varre,</HI>
afterwards <HI>Henry</HI> IV. For tho' <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
was the Son of the elder Brother, yet the
Cardinal the younger Brother was one Step
nearer to the common Stock. It is extreme
probable, had Cases of this Nature first oc∣curred,
that the nearest Agnat would have
been preferred; and it is equally probable,
had this once been established as the Rule,
tho' occurring only in collateral Succession,
that it would have been applied to the Case
of Descendents, without Regard to their Hope
of Succession. But Instances first occurring,
as readily would happen in the Case of De∣scendents,
the Decisions given in favours of
the eldest Son's Descendents, established a
Sort of general Rule, which was afterwards
applied to the Case of Collaterals.</P>
<P>THUS we see after what Manner the Rules
of Succession have been established, not only
from very slender Circumstances, but in some
Measure from Accident. Had the above
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
Question first occurred in collateral Successi∣on,
probably we should never have heard of
this Privilege given to Descendents, which
Lawyers call the Right of Representation.
But as this Privilege has been first established
in favours of Descendents, it has been consi∣dered
as a general Rule, and applied to the
Case of Collaterals, tho' without the same
Foundation. But this will not be thought
strange, when it is considered, how strong a
Propensity there is in our Nature to act by ge∣neral
Rules, without regard to the Variation
of Circumstances.</P>
<P>AND here we are furnished with an Op∣portunity
to consider a peculiar Sort of Argu∣ment,
the great Resource of Lawyers, when
they are pressed with Difficulties upon any
Subject. Cases often happen where a gene∣ral
Rule will not apply, and where it is ne∣cessary
to make a particular Rule to govern
such Cases. But as Mankind are addicted
to general Rules, and as the Indolence of
Lawyers makes it a Task too hard for them
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
to trace out all the Rules which govern par∣ticular
Cases, they have invented an easy Me∣thod
to bring all the Exceptions under the ge∣neral
Rule; which is by supposing the Fact to
have happened otherways than it did. And
this they justly term a <HI>fictio juris.</HI> Thus for
Example, in the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, a Citizen who
was taken Captive by the Enemy, lost the
<HI>jus civitatis,</HI> and all the Privileges attending
it. This was a general Rule established a∣mong
them. But supposing the Captive to
have made his Escape, or to have recovered
his Liberty by some other lucky Accident, it
would have been an Hardship intollerable,
that this Man without a Fault should be for∣feited
of all his Rights and Privileges. The
Rule, 'tis evident, could not be extended to
this Case. But what was to be done; for
Lawyers were loath to quit with the general
Rule? Instead of making a Rule for Cases of
this Nature, they extricated themselves out
of the Difficulty, by supposing forsooth, that
this Man had never been out of the City; and
this is called the <HI>jus postliminii.</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
Law is full of such Fictions, and the Mo∣derns
their humble Imitators, have followed
them but too closs. Thus, upon the Sub∣ject
under Consideration, it is justly establish∣ed
as a general Rule, that the next in Blood
succeeds. The Privilege which is given to
the Descendents of the next in Blood, who
dies before the Succession opens to him, is
obviously an Exception from this general Rule.
But to supply this Defect in the Rule, the De∣scendent
is supposed by a Fiction of Law, to
come in Place of the Deceased, to be as it
were the same Person with him, and intitled
to claim the Succession, as he could have done
had he been alive. Let us hear our Country∣man
<HI>Craig</HI> upon this Fiction. <HI>Jus repraesenta∣tionis
est, quoties posterior non ex sua, sed ex
prioris persona, quam repraesentat, jus successi∣onis
petit, veluti praemortuo filio cum nepos
aut neptis ad successionem vocantur; non enim
ratione sui, sed patris eorum, i. e. filii defun∣cti,
Successio ad eos pertinet, neque hi ex sua
persona haereditatem aut ejus partem possunt
petere, sed tantum ex persona patris (nam ex

sua non admitterentur, cum filii ex eodem pa∣rente
supersint, qui horum sunt patrui, et
sic agnati propiores defuncti;) et hoc est ejus
personam representare.</HI> This, as has been ob∣served,
is a very commodious Method of sol∣ving
Difficulties. But however commodious,
I will venture to say, it affords little Satisfac∣tion
to the Mind. For the Question still re∣curs,
Where is the Foundation for this Ficti∣on?
Why should there be a Right of Re∣presentation
in Lands more than in Movables?
To say no worse of it, it seems, in my Ap∣prehension,
to signify nothing but to darken
instead of clearing the Subject Matter. Is it
not more natural, and almost as easy to set
forth in plain Terms the Hardship it would
be upon the eldest Son's Descendents, to be
cut out of their Hopes of Succession by the
premature Death of their Father; and that
this Consideration in such Cases prevails over
the Right of Propinquity.</P>
<P>IT remains only to be observed upon this
Head, that, pursuant to the above Plan of
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
Succession, three general Rules behoved to be
established with regard to military Feus.
<HI>1mo,</HI> That the eldest Male is the Favourite
of the Law, and preferred to the Succession.
<HI>2do,</HI> That the Estate gradually descends from
the elder Brother failing Issue, to the younger
Brothers. And <HI>3tio,</HI> That it descends to e∣very
one of the Male Issue of the elder Bro∣ther,
before it comes, to the younger Brother
or his Issue.</P>
<P>THO' such was the common Course of
Succession in military Feus, which in Time
came to be looked on as Part of the common
Law of the Land, we need not doubt that
it was often broke in upon by special Ap∣pointment.
In strict Law the Vassal's Right
is but an <HI>Usufruct,</HI> and it was late before
he was considered as Proprietor. The Supe∣rior
therefore behoved to have a great Sway
in chusing an Heir for his Vassal; especial∣ly
in early Times, before Feus were regular∣ly
extended to Heirs. That Son, without
Regard to Seniority, who had shown himself
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
most active in War, would often be prefer∣red.
And even in after Times, when Suc∣cession
in Feus was more firmly established,
Examples could not be wanting of setting
aside the eldest Son, because of Defects in Bo∣dy
or Mind; or perhaps because he was inten∣ded
for the Church, or addicted to the Arts of
Peace. This gave a Beginning to Entails, by
altering the Order of Succession, and prefer∣ring
a younger Son and his Male Descendents
to the elder Sons and their Descendents.</P>
<P>BUT, now supposing that a younger Son,
thus pitched upon to serve the Superior in
Place of his Father, dies without Male Issue,
the Question is, who is his Heir in the Feu, his
elder Brother or his younger. Perhaps there
will not be found in Law a Speculation more
curious than what this Doubt gives Rise to.
Let us examine attentively what Things oc∣cur
upon this Subject. As 'tis probable from
the Circumstance of the Times, that Ex∣amples
of such Entails were frequent, even
in the Infancy of the feudal Law, we cannot
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
well suppose, that the Rules above laid down,
touching the Succession to military Feus, were
very firmly established, when there was first
Occasion to determine the Point under Con∣sideration.
But supposing these Rules to be
firmly established, it must have been obvious,
at first View, that they did not apply to this
Case. The Right of Primogeniture and the
gradual Descent, relate only to the Father's
Succession, and go no further than to ascer∣tain,
that where a Man dies <HI>intestate,</HI> his
Estate goes first to the eldest Son and his Is∣sue;
whom failing, to the second Son and his
Issue, and so downwards. But there is no∣thing
in this Regulation, where a Man dies
without Issue, to determine who shall be
his Heir, his elder or younger Brother. These
Rules therefore must be laid aside, as of no
Use to support the elder Brother's Claim.
On the other Hand, the Will of the Supe∣rior
or Father, in excluding the eldest Son,
does not militate in Favours of the younger,
since it goes no further than to prefer the se∣cond
Son to the eldest, by no Means to pre∣fer
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
the third Son. And at any Rate laying
aside the eldest Son, because of his Unwilling∣ness
or Incapacity, an Exclusion which is
founded merely on personal Considerations,
cannot be extended against his Male Issue.</P>
<P>THESE Points being discussed, one Thing
occurs in Favour of the elder Brother. In
order to ascertain the Propinquity, it is na∣tural
to cast about for the Principle which
connects the Brothers together, and this is
their Father. When we have carried our
Thoughts to him, we naturally descend to
the eldest Son, as the first Step in the Pro∣gress
of the Mind through the Family. And
thus, as the eldest Son comes next in View,
after the connecting Principle, it will not be
strange, in an overly View of the Matter, to
prefer him as a Step or Degree nearer to the
common Stock than his Competitor is. I
shall have Occasion to show hereafter, that
this Way of thinking has had its Effect in a∣nother
Case of Succession. But, as here, Cu∣stom
has given the Preference to the younger
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
Brother, there must be some other Principle
in our Nature, or some Peculiarity in our
Way of thinking, sufficient to over-balance
that now suggested. For Things established
merely by Custom, without the Influence of
external Circumstances, must certainly have
a Foundation in Nature.</P>
<P>IN searching about for this Principle, let
us premise one Reflection. It will not be
thought strange, that the Rules of Succession,
which depend upon the natural Connections
betwixt Persons, are, like these Connections,
founded upon remote Principles; Principles
which, at first Sight, may appear of little
Weight, which are little attended to, and
which, notwithstanding, have their Effect by
influencing the Mind. And now to our Sub∣ject;
in order to explain which, we must
take a pretty large Compass, being to treat
of Things which are not commonly reflect∣ed
on. In tracing out the Actions of our
Mind, the following Observations will be
found just. <HI>1mo,</HI> In the Conception of Ob∣jects,
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
which are real and existent, we take
them in their proper Order and Situation,
and never leap from one to another which
is distant, without running over, at least, in
a cursory Manner, all the interposed Objects.
Whether this be a natural Principle, or the
Effect of Habit, does not belong to the pre∣sent
Subject. I shall only observe, that the
progressive Motion, through the Points of
Space, of all moving Bodies, is sufficient to
bring on a Habit, and to accustom the Mind
to the like progressive Motion in surveying
its Ideas. <HI>2do,</HI> After the same Manner we
always follow the Succession of Time in pla∣cing
our Ideas, and cannot easily be brought
to contemplate an Object distant in Point of
Time, without running over the intermediate
Objects. <HI>3tio,</HI> As the Tendency of all Bo∣dies
is to move in a streight Line, and in
one Direction; as Nature is going on in its
Course without any retrograde Motion, this
Tenor of Things about us, communicates to
our Minds the like Tendency: However
this be, it is certain, that we more readily
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
pass to the Contemplation of a future Object,
than of one that is past. The Progression
of the Thought, in going from a present to
a past Object, has a disagreeable Feeling, as
if we were walking backward. But when
we turn our Thought to a future Object,
our Fancy flows along the Stream of Time,
and arrives at the Object, by an Order which
seems most natural, passing always from one
Point of Time to that which immediately
follows it. <HI>4to,</HI> The Tendency of Bodies
downwards, continually operating upon the
Senses, must produce from Custom a like
Tendency in the Fancy. Upon this Account
the Mind finds a Difficulty in mounting from
inferior to superior Objects, as if Ideas ac∣quired
a Kind of Gravity from their Objects.
<HI>5to,</HI> The Progress of Thought to Objects
past and future, having similar Feelings with
the Progress to Objects situated above and
below us, these Feelings are commonly ta∣ken
for the same. Hence we imagine our
Ancestors to be in a Manner mounted above
us, and our Posterity to be below us.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153"/>
THESE Observations will give Light to
our Subject. Let us recollect, that it is the
Estate of a middle Brother which is in Dis∣pute.
If we turn our Thoughts to the elder
Brother, the Mind feels some sort of Pain,
as if it were ascending. It is a sort of retro∣grade
Motion, contrary to the Course of Na∣ture.
On the other hand, passing to the
younger Brother is going with the Current, it
carries with it the Facility of descending.
These Things weigh in favours of the younger
Brother. The Transition of the Thought to
the younger being more easy than the Tran∣sition
to the elder, gives an Impression of a
closer Connection or Relation betwixt the se∣cond
and third Brother, than betwixt the se∣cond
and eldest. For 'tis a Law in our Na∣ture,
that the Connection among Objects is
ever considered to be in Proportion to the Fa∣cility
of the Transition of our Ideas from the
one to the other.</P>
<P>IT will perhaps be observed, That Prin∣ciples
like what I have been tracing out, which
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
at best, make but a slender Impression, are
little to be relied on, in our Reasonings upon
any Subject. I readily yield, that in resolving
the present Question, no Man would hesitate
a Moment to divide the middle Brother's E∣state
betwixt the elder and younger, as the
equal Method. But what forces us, perhaps
reluctantly, into an abstract Speculation, is the
Nature of a Military Feu, which does not ad∣mit
of a divided Succession. When we are
so hemmed in, we must extricate ourselves
the best Way we can. A Decision must be
given, for the Competitors are calling out to
have Justice done them. And however slight
this Principle may appear, I must observe,
that it has had Weight enough among our
Forefathers to preponderate the Consideration
above suggested, which weighs for the elder
Brother. At least, I will take it for granted,
that this is the Principle, till I hear of ano∣ther
capable to make a stronger Impression.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155"/>
AND thus a fourth Rule came to be esta∣blished
in the Succession of Military Feus, that
its Course is ever to descend, never to ascend.</P>
<P>TO proceed to other Matters, I have ex∣plained
above, one Effect of bringing Land
into Commerce, which is that of introducing
Primogeniture into all Sorts of Holdings: I
shall now take Notice of other Effects of this
Innovation still more remarkable. The Feu∣dal
Law was an Institution adapted intirely to
War, admirably contrived for that End. But
it was an utter Enemy to Labour and Indu∣stry,
and even, among an indolent People,
scarce sufferable in peaceable Times. Such an
Institution could not be long-lived. Accor∣ding
to the Circumstances of the Times, and
Humours of the People, various Changes
were introduced in different Countries, all of
them tending to correct its Harshness, and to
soften it down to a more peaceable Tempera∣ment.
It is quite wore out in several Places,
and even where it subsists, it is reduced to a
Shadow. As Land is one of the most desi∣rable
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
Objects, the Feudal Law was most un∣natural
in this Respect, that the Property of
Land was altogether withdrawn from Com∣merce,
and scarce any Means to come at the
Possession and Use of it, but by military Ser∣vice.
The Hardship was not much felt in
Times of War: But after the Arts of Peace
began to be cultivated, Manufactures and
Trade to revive in <HI>Europe,</HI> and Riches to en∣crease,
this Institution behoved to turn ex∣treme
burdensome. It first tottered, and then
fell by its own Weight, as wanting a solid
Foundation. All Parties conspired against
it, even these who were most interested to
support it. Superiors began to find, that they
could make more of their Lands than by allot∣ting
them for military Service. They were
willing to change this Service for Rent, and
the Tenants turning themselves to Industry, or
at least fond of Independency, were pleased
with the Exchange. Other Superiors, to
supply Means for Luxury, and tempted with
a Price, were willing to give off detached
Pieces of Land. And thus, by Degrees,
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
Lands returned to their original Condition of
being the principal Subject of Commerce.</P>
<P>THIS behoved to introduce some new Re∣gulations
with regard to Succession. A Man
who gets Lands as a Gratuity, or the Usufruct
of it, in Name of Wages, may reasonably be
confined within the strictest Bounds. But
he who purchases Land, and pays a full
Price, proposes to have it under his own Ma∣nagement,
and at his own Disposal. He pro∣poses
particularly, when he dies, that it shall
go to his Heirs without Limitation. And
the Person who aliens, supposing him to re∣tain
the Superiority, finds it his Interest to a∣gree
to those Conditions, since upon that
Account he gets a greater Price for the Sub∣ject.
Perhaps this was not provided for in
the first Purchases which were made. People
who have Money to bestow, will take Land
upon any Terms rather than want. But as
the Appetite for Liberty and Independency
is active and universal, there will always be
found Purchasers to pay for these Convenien∣cies;
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
and they who stand in Need of Mo∣ney,
will be tempted to dispose of every
Thing that can procure it. And thus by De∣grees,
the Succession to Heirs whatsoever was
introduced into Feudal Rights: That is, colla∣teral
Succession, properly so called, took Place,
which was not formerly known.</P>
<P>FROM this Deduction it will be obvious,
that, for a considerable Time, collateral Heirs
were only admitted to succeed in Feus pur∣chased
with Money, or other valuable Consi∣deration.
Military Feus would remain upon
their old Footing, exclusive of collateral Suc∣cession.
And thus the Notion of Conquest
came in, as opposed to Heritage, or what came
to the Vassal from his Ancestors by Descent.
And during this Period there certainly was
no Distinction betwixt <HI>feuda vetera et nova,</HI>
but betwixt Feus acquired by Purchase,
which behoved all to be late, and Feus gran∣ted
for military Service, which might be ei∣ther
old or new.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159"/>
WHEN once this Matter of collateral Suc∣cession
came to be generally known, it grew
into common Repute, and every Person did
aim at it. And as Bargains of all Sorts about
Land came into Practice, the mixed Nature
of such Bargains, partly onerous, partly gra∣tuitous,
did quite confound the Distinction
established betwixt a Purchase and a Grant
for military Service; and so by Degrees it
crept into the Feudal Law, that new Acquisi∣tions
of Land, for whatever Cause, did go to
Heirs whatsomever. And this behoved to
introduce a new Distinction betwixt <HI>feuda
vetera et nova.</HI> Under <HI>feuda nova</HI> were
comprehended Feus purchased at whatever
Time, and late Feus granted for whatever
Cause; in all of which collateral Succession
did obtain. Under <HI>feuda vetera</HI> were com∣prehended
all the old Feus granted for mili∣tary
Service, which did only descend to the
Male Heirs of the original Vassal. As these
old Feus are long ago wore out, this Di∣stinction
betwixt <HI>feuda vetera et nova</HI> must
be at an End. And now, at least in this
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
Island, every Land Right goes to Heirs
whatsomever, unless the contrary be speci∣fied.</P>
<P>AT what Periods these several Changes in
the Feudal Succession were introduced, is not
certainly known. History does not deal in
such Matters; for Lawyers are seldom Histo∣rians,
and Historians as seldom Lawyers.
But as we have Traces of these Distinctions
in our Law-books, tho' obscurely handled,
the Original of collateral Succession, and its
several Enlargements, do follow so naturally
the Increase of Trade and Riches, that there
is no resisting the Conviction which arises from
the above Deduction. Let us but consider,
that once there was no collateral Succession in
the Feudal Law, and that now it is universal,
not by Statute, but by Practice, and we will
find the several Gradations above mentioned
natural and easy, nay, what must necessarily
have happened by the Progress of Arts and
Sciences, which inspired us not only with a
Taste for Liberty and Independency, but made
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
Riches flow in among us, wherewithal to
purchase these Blessings.</P>
<P>HAVING opened up the Origin of collate∣ral
Succession in the Feudal Law, and the Pro∣gress
of it thro' its various Changes, with re∣gard
to the Subjects in which it did, and does
now obtain. I go on to examine who these
collateral Heirs are who have a Right to suc∣ceed.</P>
<P>LET us suppose a second Brother makes a
Purchase of Land, and dies without Heirs of
his Body, whereby the Succession opens to
his Collaterals, the Question is, whether the
elder or younger Brother should be preferred.
The Principle above laid down favours the
younger, that it is natural for Heritage to de∣scend,
and unnatural that it should ascend.
Further, this was become a Standard Prin∣ciple,
and constantly applied to give Prefe∣rence
to the younger Brother, in the Succes∣sion
of Estates devolving from a Father to a
middle Brother. And it will be observed,
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
that the Principle here ought to have the grea∣ter
Effect, as acting without a Counterba∣lance.
In the Case of Heritage, where the
Estate descends from the common Father, we
are apt to turn our Thoughts upon him, from
whence they naturally fall upon his eldest Son.
This Circumstance does not militate against
the younger Brother, in the Case of an Estate
acquired by a middle Brother; for the Estate
being his own Conquest, we are not prompt∣ed
to look further back. In a Word, if the
younger Brother is preferred in Heritage, not∣withstanding
of a certain Propensity in favours
of the eldest, much more ought he to be pre∣ferred
in Conquest, where there is no such
Propensity against him. Yet in Fact the el∣der
Brother is preferred by all Nations who
have embraced the Feudal Law. And this
will not appear strange, when the Circum∣stances
of Time are attended to. We have a
Propensity in our Nature to act upon general
Principles, as being easy in their Application,
by avoiding Intricacies, which more abstract
Reasoning must lead us into. The Right of
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
Primogeniture was but growing into Fashion
when the Rules of Succession in Heritage were
settled, and so had not Weight enough to
counterbalance a natural Impulse. But by
the Time that Land came to be the common
Subject of Commerce, the Right of Primo∣geniture
was established as a general Principle,
and as the common Law of the Land. In∣stances
of preferring the younger Brother in
the Succession of the middle Brother's Estate,
behoved to be rare, in Comparison of prefer∣ring
the elder Brother to the Father's Estate,
and such rare Instances making no Figure, in
Opposition to the general Rule, the Right of
Primogeniture was readily laid hold of to de∣termine
this Point. And when the Error is
so common of substituting Names for Things,
it will be no Surprise, that this was made the
determining Rule, tho' in strict Thinking it
does not meet the Case. After the Hint is
given, nothing can be more obvious, than
that the Cause of preferring the eldest Son to
the Father's Succession, does by no Means
apply to the Succession of a younger Brother.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="164"/>
BUT we are no sooner extricated out of one
Labyrinth, than we are involved in a greater.
If a third Brother dies possessed of Conquest,
the Succession, by the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> goes
to the immediate elder, by the Law of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
to the eldest. What are the Foundati∣ons
of these different Opinions, and which
the most agreeable to Principles, may not be
an useless Enquiry. The <HI>English</HI> who got
the Start of us in Law-matters, have been
guided in the Decision by the Principle of Pri∣mogeniture;
and indeed, after conferring the
second Brother's Estate upon the eldest, mo∣ved
by this Principle, it was an easy Conse∣quence
to confer upon him also the third Bro∣ther's
Estate. Our People, in the Infancy of
their Law, swayed more by natural Feelings,
than by general Principles, have judged of this
Matter after a different Manner. Beginning
at the third Brother whose Estate was in Que∣stion,
it has been observed, that the Mind in
its Progress would pass first to the second Bro∣ther,
and from him to the eldest. In this
Way the second Brother was considered as one
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
Step nearer to the Deceased than the eldest is,
and so was preferred to the Succession.</P>
<P>'TIS probable the Feudal Law was intro∣duced
into <HI>Scotland,</HI> before an Opportunity
offered of fixing this Point in <HI>England,</HI> other∣ways
it would have come along to us, with
their other Feudal Customs. Thus we were
left to our own Way of thinking in solving
the Problem. And tho' we have determined
the Point, by Similitude of Distance and pro∣gressive
Motion, yet it appears, that some of
our Lawyers have reasoned not quite uniform∣ly
upon this Subject. The learned <HI>Craig</HI>
puts a Case, <HI>L. 2. Dieg.</HI> 15. § <HI>ult.</HI> It is of
four Brothers, three of the first Marriage,
the fourth of a second. The fourth acquires
a Land Estate, and dies without Issue. Our
Author observes, that other Lawyers were
for preferring the immediate elder Brother,
tho' of a different Marriage; and such, no
doubt, at present, is the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
whatever Difficulty there might be in the Que∣stion
before the Rule was established in Prac∣tice;
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
he is for preferring the eldest Brother,
“Because (says he) in the Case of different
Marriages, the Connection or Conjunction
begins at the eldest, and passes thro' him to
the second and third.” This is obscurely
said, but it is not difficult to gather what our
Author had in View. The Argument, when
brought out to Light, is subtile and ingeni∣ous.
Where the Brothers are all closely uni∣ted
by being of the same Marriage, we feel
an intimate Connection amongst them, with∣out
thinking of the connecting Principle. But
amongst Brothers of different Marriages, the
first Idea that presents itself, is rather that of
Difference and Opposition, than of Union.
This forces us when we investigate the Rela∣tion,
to cast about for a connecting Principle,
which we find to be the common Parent; and
as from him the first Step is to the eldest Son,
we conceive this Son to be one Step nearer
than the second, and two Steps nearer than
the third.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167"/>
WHEN the Matter of Succession depends
upon such remote Foundations, and upon
such slight Feelings, 'tis no Wonder the Cu∣stoms
of different Nations should be so dif∣ferent,
and that there should not even be any
uniform or consistent Plan of Succession in the
same Nation: And indeed ours, in particu∣lar,
is far from being uniform. Another
Mistake has crept into our Law, and into all
our Law-Books, less excuseable than any a∣bove
suggested. Let us recollect the Distinc∣tion
mentioned above, betwixt <HI>feuda vetera
et nova.</HI> In the first Class were the old Feus
established upon the Footing of military Ser∣vice,
where the Succession was confined to
Male Descendents of the original Vassal, and
which consequently behoved gradually to de∣scend;
and could never ascend. The other
Class comprehended Purchases, and all late
Feus granted for whatever Cause, which went
to Heirs whatsomever. In these, when the
Succession opened to Collaterals of the origi∣nal
Vassal, the eldest Brother and his De∣scendents
were preferred as the Heirs of
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
Line. 'Tis mighty plain, that these <HI>feuda
nova</HI> could never become <HI>feuda vetera</HI> in a∣ny
Course of Time, so as to exclude colla∣teral
Succession, or to bar Succession by A∣scent.
If Conquest go to the elder Brother,
where the Acquirer a middle Brother, dies
without Issue, no imaginable Reason can be
given why it ought not to go in the same
Channel, where the Acquirer leaves a Son
who succeeds, and dies without Issue. In
one Word, collateral Succession, and Succes∣sion
by Ascent, ought to be convertible
Terms; if in any one Case the eldest Brother
is the lineal Heir, he ought to be considered
as such in every Case of collateral Successi∣on.
But these Matters first took Footing in
the Days of Ignorance, when the Concepti∣ons
of Mankind were gross and inaccurate.
What it may be in other Countries I know
not, but in the Practice of <HI>Scotland</HI> a very
motely Scheme is established. We conceive
nothing to be a <HI>feudum novum,</HI> but an im∣mediate
Acquisition. If it has once past by
Succession, we understand it to be a <HI>feudum
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
antiquum,</HI> or Heritage, not so indeed as to
exclude collateral Succession, but so as to
make the Succession for ever after to descend,
and never to ascend. And we have been led
into this Practice by an Error, apt, as above
observed, to slip into all Sorts of Reasoning,
which is that of mistaking Words for Things.
Not attending to the Import of the Distinc∣tion
betwixt <HI>feudum antiquum et novum,</HI> we
took up with the Word, and deserted the
Meaning, and so by Degrees came to con∣ceive
every old Feu to be <HI>feudum antiquum.</HI>
And as there are no precise Boundaries be∣twixt
what is old and what is new, we were
forced, at last, to fix upon this Rule, That
whatever has past by Succession, is to be un∣derstood
a <HI>feudum antiquum.</HI> And having
once introduced this arbitrary Distinction, in
Place of the former, we unwarily applied to
it these general Rules, which do apply only
to the original Distinction betwixt <HI>feudum
antiquum et novum:</HI> Nothing can be more
gross. In Place of the proper Distinction
betwixt <HI>feudum antiquum et novum,</HI> to sub∣stitute
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
another of a quite different Kind, that
has no Relation to it but the Name; and yet
to mistake this new invented Distinction for
the old, so as to give it the same Effect in
Law, was certainly confounding Things in a
strange Manner, and what could only happen
in the Days of gross Ignorance. It is very
true, that we went no further than to ex∣clude
the Privilege of Primogeniture, where
a Feu had once been taken up by Succession.
We never considered it to be a <HI>feudum an∣tiquum</HI>
in any such proper Sense, as to ex∣clude
collateral Succession. False Reasoning
could scarce lead us so far. In judging of a
nice Case, such as the Competition betwixt
two Brothers, we might be led to substitute
one Idea for another, the <HI>feudum antiquum</HI>
for the <HI>feudum novum,</HI> especially if the Dis∣pute
happened about a Feu that was really
old, or of a long standing. But, in a Dispute
betwixt the Heir of the Vassal and the Su∣perior,
where the Question behoved to turn
upon a Point of Fact, whether the Feu was
granted after the Period that all Grants of this
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
Kind were understood to go to Heirs what∣somever,
there could be little Room for Mi∣stake.</P>
<P>AND now to explain the Terms of <HI>Heir
of Conquest</HI> and <HI>Heir of Line,</HI> let us suppose
a <HI>feudum novum</HI> and a <HI>feudum antiquum</HI>
properly so called, centered both in a middle
Brother: The last, 'tis plain, cannot be, but
by a Destination excluding the eldest Brother.
Or let us suppose them both to be <HI>feuda no∣va,</HI>
the one purchased by the second Brother
himself, the other established in his Person by
virtue of a Destination. Or, conform to our
present Practice, let the one be a Purchase,
the other a Subject to which he derives Right,
as representing a younger Brother. The el∣dest
Brother will succeed in the Lands con∣quest
by the middle Brother, the younger
will succeed in the Lands that came to the
middle Brother by Succession. And so it
may often happen, that the same Person's Suc∣cession
is split and divided betwixt two Male
Representatives, the one named <HI>the Heir of
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
Line,</HI> the other <HI>the Heir of Conquest.</HI> These
Names are only used in the particular Case
where both represent the same Person: In
other Cases where there is no Occasion to
make the Distinction, they pass under the
common Appellation of <HI>Heirs at Law.</HI> For
Example, an eldest Son, succeeding to Lands
purchased by his Father, is not stiled <HI>Heir of
Conquest,</HI> but <HI>Heir at Law</HI> or <HI>of Line.</HI> But
with Regard to this, tho' the elder Brother is
named <HI>Heir of Conquest</HI> in Opposition to the
younger, who has the Name of <HI>Heir of Line,</HI>
we must beware not to consider the Heir of
Conquest as a limited Heir. 'Tis certain he
is <HI>eadem persona cum defuncto,</HI> and as univer∣sal
a Representative as the Heir of Line, pro∣perly
so called, can be. And so says the Lord
<HI>Stair, Tit. (Heirs</HI>) § 10. And he assigns a
very ingenious Reason for giving to the younger
Brother the Title of <HI>Heir of Line.</HI> “The
elder Brother (says he) is called <HI>the Heir
of Conquest,</HI> and the other retaineth the
common Name of <HI>the Heir of Line;</HI>”
which is saying, that the younger Brother is
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
allowed to retain a Name common to both,
for want of another Term to distinguish him
by.</P>
<P>TOUCHING Heirship Moveables, Tacks,
Pensions, or other such Rights from which
the Executor is excluded, and which, pro∣perly
speaking, are not Land Rights, it is
settled in Practice, that all of these go to the
Heir of Line, and not to the Heir of Con∣quest.
The Ground of this Practice may
be readily gathered. Let us recal what is ob∣served
above, that the Right of Primogeni∣ture,
at first confined to military Feus, was
gradually extended to take Place in the Suc∣cession
of Males, whatever was the Nature
of the Feu. But as there had been no Ex∣ample
of the Right of Primogeniture in the
Succession of Females, our Forefathers did
not think of carrying this Right beyond the
Practice, and so confined it to the Male Suc∣cession.
The same has happened here. The
Privilege of Primogeniture had only taken
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
Place in Succession to Lands; and as there
was no Example or Authority to determine
the Point touching the Subjects now in Que∣stion,
the natural Feelings prevailed, and the
Propensity to pass downwards, or according
to the Succession of Time.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>TO complete this Subject, it will be ne∣cessary
to take a View of the Trans∣mission
of Moveables from the Dead to the
Living, and of the different Changes this Spe∣cies
of Succession has undergone in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>HISTORIES in all Ages are full of the En∣croachments
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Clergy. There
is no End of the Artifices used by them to
usurp Power and Riches. Yet it appears
strange, that by all the Historians, who write
with great Spirit against them, one of their
most successful Stratagems to ingross Money
should be omitted; insomuch, that we are
entirely indebted to our Statute-book, for
keeping in Memory one of the most notorious
Pieces of Priest-craft ever was practised.
Would any one believe, that there is a Coun∣try,
and in <HI>Europe</HI> too, where the Clergy
gained such an Ascendant over the Minds of
the People, as tamely to suffer the moveable
Estate of every Man who died intestate, to be
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
swallowed up by them. Those who draw
their Notions from the present Age, will scarce
give Faith to the Story, that Superstition could
ever be so prevalent, in any Age, as to pro∣duce
a Law preferring the Bishop to the next
of Kin. But let them suspend their Wonder
for a Moment, till they learn the whole Ex∣tent
of this Law. It did not stop at exclud∣ing
the Relations of the Deceased, supposing
them to be his Children. The Wife was ex∣cluded.
Nay the Creditors were excluded.
All was given to the Bishop <HI>per aversionem.</HI>
Of <HI>Britain</HI> we are talking, and yet the shame∣less
Rapacity was suffered here for Ages. We
may believe such a monstrous Practice could
not be established at once. It crept in by De∣grees.
The Foundation was laid in a Doc∣trine
sedulously inculcated, That the moveable
Effects of every dead Person, failing his own
Appointment, ought to be laid out for pro∣moting
the Good of his Soul. This brought
the Clergy into the Play. The <HI>Ordinary</HI> pre∣tended
at first but to give Advice, but this Ad∣vice,
in Process of Time, gained Authority,
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
and became a Command. At last the Mask
was thrown off, and the Ordinary, without
Ceremony, took up the Possession, without
deigning to account to any Mortal. Let us
hear a grave Author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bacon</HI>'s Discourse of the Laws and Government of <HI>England,</HI> Part I. Cap. 66.</NOTE> upon this Subject.
“Originally the Goods of the Intestate pas∣sed
by a kind of Descent to the Children;
afterwards by a <HI>Saxon</HI> Law, the Wife had
her Part. In <HI>Henry</HI> I's Time the Clergy
had gotten a Taste; for altho' the Wife
and Children, or next of Kin had then the
Possession, yet it was for the Good of the
Soul of the Deceased; and the Ordinary had
a directing Power therein, and was in the
Nature of an Overseer, and somewhat more.
Afterwards, in the Time of King <HI>John</HI> the
Clergy had drawn Blood; for tho' the Pos∣session
was as formerly, yet the Dividend
must be made in the View of the Church;
and by this Means the Dividers were but
mere Instruments, and the Right was va∣nished
into the Clouds. But in <HI>Henry</HI> III's
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
Time, the Clergy had not only gotten the
Game, but gorged it: Both Right and Pos∣session
was now become theirs, and Wrong
done to none but the Clouds.”</P>
<P>AND so it came to be settled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Abridgement of the Law, Tit. <HI>Executors and Administrators,</HI> P. 398.</NOTE>, That if a
Man died intestate, neither his Wife, Chil∣dren,
nor next of Kin, had Right to any
Share of his Estate, but the <HI>Ordinary</HI> was to
distribute it according to his Conscience, to
pious Uses; and sometimes the Wife and
Children might be amongst the Number of
those whom he appointed to receive it; but
however, the Law trusted him with the whole
Disposition.</P>
<P>THE first Statute that limited the Power
of the <HI>Ordinary</HI> was 13th, <HI>Edward</HI> I. <HI>C.</HI> 19.
by which it is enacted, “That where a Man
dies intestate, and in Debt, and the Goods
come to the <HI>Ordinary</HI> to be disposed, he
shall satisfy the Debts so far as the Goods
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
extend, in such Sort, as the Executors of
such Person should have done, in case he
had made a Will.” Afterwards the actual
Possession was taken from the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> by
obliging him to give a Deputation <HI>to the next
and most lawful Friends of the Intestate, for
administrating his Goods.</HI> 31st <HI>Edward</HI> III.
<HI>Cap.</HI> II. But this Statute proved but a weak
Check to the Avarice of the Clergy. Means
were fallen upon to elude it, by preferring
such of the Intestate's Relations who were
willing to offer the best Terms. This cor∣rupt
Practice was suffered to the Days of
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. when the Clergy losing Ground,
the Statute 21. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. <HI>Cap.</HI> 5. was e∣nacted,
bearing, “That in case any Person
die intestate, or the Executors refuse to
prove the Testament, the <HI>Ordinary</HI> shall
grant Administration to the Widow, or to
the next of Kin, or to both, taking Surety
for true Administration.”</P>
<P>THIS Statute, as it points out the particu∣lar
Persons who are intitled to have Letters
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
of Administration, without leaving any Choice
to the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> was certainly intended to
cut him out of all Hope of making Gain of
the Effects of Persons dying intestate. But
the Church does not easily quit its Hold.
Means were fallen upon to elude this Law
also. Tho' the Possession by these Statutes,
was wrested out of the Hands of the <HI>Ordinary,</HI>
yet his Pretensions subsisted entire, of calling
the Administrator to account, and obliging
him or her to distribute the Effects to pious
Uses. This was an admirable Engine in the
Hands of a Churchman for squeezing Money.
We may readily believe, that the Administra∣tor
who gave any considerable Share to the
Bishop, to be laid out by him, without Doubt!
upon pious Uses, would not find much Dif∣ficulty
in making his Accompt. It was pro∣bably
this rank Abuse, which moved the
Judges of <HI>England</HI> solemnly to resolve, That
the Ordinary, after Administration granted by
him, cannot compel the Administrator to
make Distribution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Last mentioned Author, P. 414.</NOTE>. But at last the Right of
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
the next of Kin was fully established by Sta∣tute
22 and 23. <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>Cap.</HI> 10. which e∣nacts,
That after Payment of Debts, Fune∣rals
and just Expences of all Sorts, the Surplu∣sage
shall be distributed as follows: “One
Third to the Wife of the Intestate, the Re∣sidue
amongst the Children, and such as
legally represent them, if any of them be
dead. If there be no Children, nor legal
Representatives of them, one Moiety shall
be allotted to the Wife, the Residue equal∣ly
to the next of Kin to the Intestate, in
equal Degree, and those who represent
them. But no Representation shall be ad∣mitted
amongst Collaterals, after Brothers
and Sisters Children. And if there be no
Wife, all shall be distribute amongst the
Children; and if no Child, to the next of
Kin to the Intestate in equal Degree, and
their Representatives.”</P>
<P>WE may reasonably conjecture, that the
Church was equally successful in both Parts
of the Island. We have undoubted Evidence
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
that so early as the Days of our King <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI>
which was in the twelfth Century, the
<HI>Ordinaries</HI> or Bishops had wrought them∣selves
into the Possession, and Administration
of the moveable Effects of Persons dying in∣testate.
Their Pretext must have been the
same as in <HI>England,</HI> to distribute the Effects
for pious Uses, in order to promote the Good
of the Soul. Upon such a Foundation no
Action at common Law could be competent
to oblige the <HI>Ordinary</HI> to accompt, whether
at the Instance of the Wife, Children, or
Creditors. The Distribution was to be left
to his Direction, and upon his Conscience.
And what seems to put this past Doubt is,
that it required a Statute here as well as in
<HI>England,</HI> to oblige the <HI>Ordinary</HI> to do Justice
even to Creditors, who are, of all certainly
the most privileged. All this appears from
the 22d Chapter of the Statutes of King <HI>Wil∣liam.</HI>
The Words are, “After the Decease
of any Man intestate, and owing Debts to
Creditors, his Goods shall be disponed by
his <HI>Ordinary,</HI> and the <HI>Ordinary</HI> shall be o∣bliged
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>
to answer for the Debts, so far as the
Goods and Gear will extend, in the same
Manner as Executors named by the Defunct
are bound to do.” This Statute is full Evi∣dence
that in this early Age, the Bishops were
taking Liberties contrary to Conscience, and
the Trust reposed in them, even so far as to
defraud the Intestate's Creditors. We may
believe the Cry was great before the Reme∣dy
was applied; and yet this did not open
the Eyes of our Lawgivers. The Wife, Chil∣dren,
and nearest of Kin were left intirely at
the Mercy of the Church. It is true, the
Evil was not greatly felt, because it was in
every Man's Power to prevent it, by making
a Will. And it was probably urged in Fa∣vours
of the Church, that it must be the pre∣sumed
Intention of every Man who makes no
Will, to leave the Management of his move∣able
Estate to the <HI>Ordinary.</HI></P>
<P>BUT Cases occurring of Persons dying un∣der
Age, who are incapable of making a Te∣stament,
our People began to perceive the
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
Weakness of the Church's Argument from
Intention; for the Ordinary made no Dif∣ficulty
of seizing the Possession also in this
Case, tho' he had not even the Pretext of
an implied Intention. This Practice there∣fore
was thought a Grievance, and a Statute
was made to redress it. The Preamble of
the Act 120. <HI>P.</HI> 1540. is, “That whereas
Persons often dying young, who cannot
make a Testament, the Executor named
by the Ordinary does notwithstanding in∣tromit
with the whole Goods, and with∣draw
the same from the nearest of Kin,
who should have the same by Law:”
Therefore enacted, “That when any Per∣son
dies who cannot make a Testament,
their next of Kin shall have their Goods,
without Prejudice to the <HI>Ordinary</HI>'s Claim
of a Quote.”</P>
<P>THIS Statute laid the Foundation of a le∣gal
Claim, which was soon thereafter enlar∣ged.
One Article of the Instructions 1563,
given to the Commissaries is, “That if one die
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
intestate, or his Executor nominate refuse to
accept of the Office, the Commissaries must
give the Office to the nearest of Kin, be∣ing
willing to find Caution.” This is co∣pied
from the above mentioned Statute of
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. enacted a few Years before.
But the Regulation had still a better Effect in
<HI>Scotland</HI> than in <HI>England.</HI> It required a Sta∣tute
there to complete the Right of the next
of Kin, and to protect them from the En∣croachments
of the Clergy. But in <HI>Scotland</HI>
the Bishops, immediately upon the Reforma∣tion,
having lost all Authority, the next of
Kin getting Letters of Administration from
the Commissaries, came of Course to retain
the Effects, without having any to accompt
to, save to those who had a natural Right.
The Bishop had lost his Claim, and the Com∣missaries
never had any.</P>
<P>I OBSERVE, that in the above Article of
the Instructions 1563, no Mention is made of
the Relict, tho' her Interest is expresly taken
Care of in the <HI>English</HI> Statute, whence the
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
Article is copied. This could not have
happened by Inadvertency. My Conjecture
is, that our Judges have taken the honest
Liberty to sustain Action against the <HI>Ordina∣ries,</HI>
to the Relict for her Third, and to the
Children for their Legitim, in Imitation of
King <HI>William</HI>'s Statute affording Action to
Creditors. If a legal Claim was afforded to
the Wife and Children by the Practice of the
Courts of Law, it was unnecessary to make
any further Provision for them in the Instruc∣tions
1563; and so the Article is confined
to the next of Kin, who formerly had no
Claim. And it was extreme natural for our
Judges to take this Liberty, considering that
the Wife and Children, by the common Law
of the Land, had an unexceptionable Claim
against the Executor nominate. And it might
well be thought strange and unaccountable,
that a Man should have it in his Power to
defraud his Wife and Children of their just
Claim, by forbearing to make a Will, or that
the <HI>Ordinary</HI> should not be liable as well as
the Executor nominate.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187"/>
THUS the Right of the nearest of Kin is
established, where the Predecessor dies inte∣state.
But where a Testament is made, which
is the more frequent Case, they were left
without Remedy, unless Provision was made
for them in the Testament. They had no
Right hitherto established in them, save the
Privilege of being preferred to all others in the
Office of Executry. But this Privilege could
not take Place where an Executor was named
by the Deceased, nor was any Action competent
at common Law to oblige the Executor nomi∣nate
to account to them. 'Twas understood to
be the Will of the Deceased, that the Distri∣bution
should be left to the Discretion of the
Executor, where the contrary was not ex∣pressed;
just as formerly it was understood
to be his Will to leave all to the Discretion
of the <HI>Ordinary</HI> where he died intestate.
And thus it happened, that the very Nomi∣nation
intitled the Executor to retain to him∣self
the free Moveables, even where he was
not named universal or residuary Legatar.
This was remedied by the Act 14. <HI>P.</HI> 1617.
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
which gives to the next of Kin the like Ac∣tion
against the Executor nominate to ac∣compt
for the Effects confirmed, that was be∣fore
competent against him at the Instance
of the Wife and Children.</P>
<P>OUR Law then with Regard to the Inte∣rest
of the nearest of Kin, stands thus. Where
the Predecessor dies intestate, they are privi∣leged
to be Executors, or Administrators with∣out
accompt, and of consequence to retain the
free Effects. Where he makes a Will, they
are intitled to call the Executor to accompt.
But where by Oversight or Accident they hap∣pen
not to apply, <HI>debito tempore,</HI> to be confirm∣ed
Executors, so that a Creditor gets the Of∣fice,
or perhaps the Procurator-fiscal, I see
no Remedy. There is certainly no Action
given in this Case to the next of Kin against
the Administrator or Executor-dative to ac∣compt,
as there is in the Case of an Executor
nominate. Nor is there <HI>par ratio,</HI> as it must
be the Fault of the next of Kin, if they are
cut out of their Right where the Predecessor
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
dies intestate: And the Instructions to the
Commissaries 1666, do take it for granted, that
no such Action is competent; for it obliges
the Procurator-fiscal, who failing others, is
allowed to confirm, to accompt to the Arch∣bishop
or Bishop, he having three Shillings
for every Pound he brings in and makes Pay∣ment
of. Yet where so many Steps are taken
to found the next of Kin in a legal Claim, we
are naturally led to complete the Scheme, by
giving them a Right in every Case. And it
is extreme likely, that if such a Question come
before the Court of Session, the Judges will
sustain a Claim at the Instance of the next of
Kin against an Executor Creditor, and <HI>multo
magis</HI> against the Procurator-fiscal confirming.
And what leads me to think so, is the Act of
Sederunt 14th <HI>November</HI> 1679, in which it
is taken for granted, that an Executor Credi∣tor
is liable to accompt, not only to the Re∣lict
and Children, but to the next of Kin.</P>
<P>FROM this short History of the Transmis∣sion
of Moveables from the Dead to the Li∣ving,
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
it will be evident that there is no such
Thing, properly speaking, in the Law of this
Island, as an Heir <HI>in mobilibus.</HI> If a Will is
made, the Form of it is to name an Executor,
or Trustee, to distribute the Effects; and
sometimes this Distribution is left to be made
by the established Rules of Law, sometimes
Directions are given in the Will itself, as where
a certain Sum is appointed to be paid to this
or that Person, commonly called a Legacy.
If the Person dies intestate, the whole move∣able
Effects are understood to be <HI>eo ipso</HI> vested
in the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> or in Place of him, the Com∣missaries
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> not in the Quality of
Heirs, but as Trustees to distribute the Effects
to pious Uses. Accordingly no Person is le∣gally
intitled to take Possession of an Intestate's
Effects, otherways than by an express War∣rant
from the <HI>Ordinary</HI> or Commissaries. And
after the Restoration, the Bishops in <HI>Scotland</HI>
took great Care to preserve their Right. They
had Spies in all Corners, and no sooner was a
Man laid in his Grave, than they thundered
out all the Artillery of the Law, to force his
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
Relations to apply for Letters of Administra∣tion.
But this Grievance, among others, was
redressed after the Revolution. What was
suffered with Impatience under the Jurisdic∣tion
of Bishops, was not at all to be endured
under the Jurisdiction of their Shadow, the
Commissaries. Accordingly a Statute was
made, Act 26, <HI>p.</HI> 1690, discharging such Pro∣secutions
in Time coming, “That no Person
shall be bound to give up Inventary of a De∣funct's
Goods, and that there shall be no
Confirmation, unless at the Instance of the
Relict, Children, nearest of Kin, or Cre∣ditors.”
The Intendment of this Statute,
tho' not said directly, is to transfer to the
Children or next of Kin, the Property of the
Moveables which belonged to the Deceased,
without requiring any other Act or Solemnity,
but barely the apprehending of Possession.
This will be obvious, from considering that,
by the common Law, there is no other Form
known, of acquiring the Property of Move∣ables,
which belonged to a deceased Person,
but by Warrant of the <HI>Ordinary</HI> or Com∣missaries.
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
And when this Form is dispensed
with, without substituting any other, Posses∣sion
alone must have the Effect. It is true,
Confirmation is not altogether laid aside; it is
still of Use to preserve the Intromitter from
being liable to Creditors beyond the Value of
the Subject. But if the Children or nearest
of Kin are willing to take their Hazard, they
may safely enter into Possession, without ap∣plying
for a Title. And thus, after much
wandering, the Transmission of Moveables
from the Dead to the Living is brought back
to its natural Channel, and reduced to the
simplest Form.</P>
<P>IT remains only to be observed, That tho'
in <HI>England</HI> the <HI>jus repraesentationis</HI> is introdu∣ced
to a certain Extent, in the Succession of
Moveables <HI>ab intestato,</HI> we have not thought
proper to follow this Practice. We adhere
strictly to the Law of Nature in moveable
Succession, by preferring the next in Blood,
without Distinction betwixt Male and Female,
and without regard to the Privilege of Pri∣mogeniture.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX
TOUCHING
The HEREDITARY and INDEFEASIBLE
RIGHT of KINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE hereditary-indefeasible Right of
Kings, and Passive-obedience and Non∣resistance
its genuine Offspring, are Doctrines
which of late have made a great Noise in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
and particularly in this Island. Some
Reflections upon this Subject, suggested by
the present unhappy Times, will make a pro∣per
Appendix to the above Essay.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider Man, abstracted from
all positive Engagements, we find nothing in
his Nature, or in his Situation, to subject him
to the Power of any, his Creator, and his
Parents excepted. The parental Power is at
an End, when Children are grown up, and
can provide for themselves. At any Rate the
parental Power cannot subsist longer than the
Life of the Parents; for it is not a Matter of
Property to be transmitted by Succession, since
<PB N="193" REF="194"/>
it depends upon personal Circumstances. And
supposing it a Subject to be taken by Succes∣sion,
it must descend to all the Children e∣qually,
at least to all the Sons equally; for
Primogeniture, 'tis certain, is not a Right of
the Law of Nature, but a Consequence only
of the Feudal Law. Hence it is a Principle
embraced by the gravest Writers, that all
Mankind are born free, and independent of
one another.</P>
<P>MAN indeed is fitted for Society. His
Wants prompt him to it, and his Inclinati∣ons
render it agreeable. Accordingly we find
Mankind almost everywhere parcelled out in∣to
Societies, which have been originally form∣ed
by accidental Circumstances, more or less
extensive. A Society of any Extent cannot
be without Government. The Members must
have Laws to determine their Differences, and
they must have Rulers to put their Laws in
Execution. At the same Time, we find the
Constitutions of different States, with regard
to Government, almost as various, as are the
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
Sentiments of Men concerning it: So that tho'
Government be necessary to the Well-being
of Society, yet from this Circumstance alone,
were we to look no further back, we may
conclude no particular Form to be necessary,
but the Effect of Choice, or perhaps in some
Measure of Accident.</P>
<P>LET us trace this Matter further, because
it is of Importance. Man is a shy Animal,
and in his original State, rather averse to So∣ciety.
In that State his Wants were few, and
easily supplied; therefore we may readily
conclude, that while Acorns were the Food
of Man, and Water his Drink, there was nei∣ther
Use nor Appetite for Soci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty. Accor∣dingly
we find Mankind originally in every
Corner of the Earth living in scattered Habi∣tations,
with little Intercourse, except among
the Members of the same Family. The Cul∣ture
of Corn laid the Foundation of a more
extensive Intercourse, because thereby mutual
Assistance became necessary. When Arts
were invented, and Industry increased, it was
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
found convenient to herd together in Towns
and Villages. From this closser Connection
one Evil sprung, Opposition of Interests, for∣merly
rare; which at first was the Occasion
of Quarrels and Bloodshed, and afterwards of
frequent Appeals to Men of Weight and Pro∣bity.
In Time the Necessity of fixed Judges
to determine Differences being discovered, the
Election of these Judges, which could not o∣therways
be than popular, was the first Step
to Government. The chief Magistrate there∣fore
was originally no more but the chief
Judge, whose Powers were gradually extend∣ed,
as Cases occurred, which required the
Interposition of a Superior or Governor. War
introduced Slavery, as it subjected those taken
in Battle to the arbitrary Will of their Con∣querors;
and absolute Power was too desire∣able
an Acquisition, to be the Perquisite of
Subjects only. The chief Magistrate, how∣ever
repugnant it is to the Nature of his Of∣fice,
did often grasp at it: And History in∣forms
us, That the chief Magistrate, in dif∣ferent
Societies, has been often but too suc∣cessful.
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
In a Word, absolute Independence
and absolute Power are the two Extremes;
and the latter, at least so far as concerns So∣vereignty,
could never have been introduced,
but by passing through all the intermediate
Degrees.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT therefore is one of the
Arts which Necessity has suggested, which
Time and Experience have ripened, and which
must be perpetually subject to further Im∣provements.
For Government, like all other
Arts, being invented for the Good of Man∣kind,
it must be the Privilege of every Society
to improve upon it, as well as upon Manu∣factures
or Husbandry. No particular Form
therefore can be necessary, as no particular
Form is preferable to another, unless so far as
it has a greater Tendency to promote its End,
the Good of the Society. Comparing Demo∣cracy,
Aristocracy and Monarchy together,
this is their common Standard.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="198"/>
THERE is a People inhabiting the Earth,
who are not left to the Choice of their Go∣vernors,
but are by Nature subjected to Mo∣narchy.
In every Society there is a Royal
Family, of a different Species from the other
Members. Every Monarch is born with
Marks of Royalty, of a peculiar Shape, and
with superior Beauty. We may suppose, that
the Excellencies of the Mind are not inferior
to those of the Body; and no Wonder when
this is the Case, that perfect Obedience is
given through all the State, and that their Mo∣narch's
Will is their only Law. There the
Parts are justly distributed, the Sovereign fra∣med
for Command, as the Subjects for Obe∣dience,
each in their several Capacities equally
contributing to the only End of Government,
the Well-being of the Society. Here there
can be no stretching of Prerogative on the
one Hand, no Resistance nor even Murmurs
on the other. The Monarch taught by Na∣ture,
that the Sovereign Power is a Trust
which ought not to be abused, has no Desire
but to promote the publick Welfare. The
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
People taught by Nature, that passive Obe∣dience
and Non-resistance are the only Means
to promote their Happiness, implicitely sub∣mit
themselves to their Monarch's Will.</P>
<P>WERE Mankind so framed, for of Insects
we have been speaking, these Gentlemen
would have Reason on their Side, who de∣clare
so strongly for indefeasible-hereditary
Right, and the reciprocal Duty of passive
Obedience and Non-resistance: Were our
Royal Family, like that of the Bees, distin∣guished
from the Mass of the People by su∣perior
Excellencies, whether of the Mind or
Body, were they unerringly prompted by Na∣ture
to exercise their Power for the Welfare
of the Society, blind Obedience to their Will
would be a Virtue. But when we trust with
sovereign Power one of the common Stamp
of Mankind, who has by Nature no Marks
of Royalty, and who perhaps by Nature is
not fitted for Command, the Absurdity is
great, to maintain, That this Person ought to
be under no Controul, and that we ought to
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
continue to trust him, after repeated Instances
of his betraying the Trust reposed in him.</P>
<P>I HAVE no Occasion to consider whether
Conquest be a good Title by the Law of
Nature, to acquire the absolute Dominion of
a State, as in <HI>Turky,</HI> where the Grand Sig∣nior
is supposed to be the Lord of the Man∣nor,
and all the People his Slaves. This is
not Government, the Characteristic of which
is, Trust reposed in one for the Good of the
whole. It is like a private Estate, which
may be disposed of by the Proprietor with∣out
Controul, and applied for his own Pur∣poses.
It cannot be pretended that the King
of <HI>Britain</HI> has his Right by Conquest; and
therefore no Support can be drawn to the
Argument from that Quarter.</P>
<P>THE Scheme, it must be yeilded, is so far
consistent, that if we suppose the King's Right
to be indefeasible, and that he cannot be de∣prived
of his Authority, however much his
Measures swerve from the Rules of good Go∣vernment
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
it must follow, that the People
are tied to passive Obedience and Non-re∣sistance,
as there is no <HI>Medium</HI> betwixt Re∣sistance
and Obedience. But where is the
Foundation of the indefeasible Right of the
King, more than of any other Officer of the
State? Does it lie in the Name? One should
scarce think so, when the Name is indiffe∣rently
applied to Governors who have very
little Power, as well as to those whose Power
is the most extensive. It cannot ly in the
Nature of the Office, which being a Trust, is
undoubtedly forfeitable upon Mal-administra∣tion.
It will perhaps be said to ly in the
Constitution of our Government. So far
from it, that no Man is bound to obey the
King's Commands, unless delivered in a cer∣tain
Form prescribed by Law. And even in
<HI>France,</HI> supposing it an absolute Monarchy,
without any constitutional Check upon the
King's Actions, the King's Power is notwith∣standing
limited. There cannot be such a
Thing in Nature, as for a People voluntarily
to surrender their Liberties to the arbitrary
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
Will of any Man. The Act would be void
as inconsistent with the great Law of Nature,
<HI>salus populi suprema lex.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Favourers of this Doctrine, when
beat out of these Entrenchments, have a Re∣treat,
which they suppose impregnable. They
allow at last that the King may do wrong, by
betraying the Trust reposed in him. But
then they maintain, that a King having no
Superior on Earth, can have no proper Judge
of his Actions but God alone, from whom
his Power flows; and therefore is accoun∣table
to the Almighty only. This is a For∣tress
built upon Sand. All Power no doubt
is from God, natural and legal; for he is the
Creator and Upholder of all Things. But
it follows from this, instead of being contra∣dictory
to it, that every Sort of Power is li∣mited
by the Opposition of other Powers,
natural or legal, which are equally from God
with the Power resisted. Perhaps they mean
that every King has his Commission from the
Almighty, and not from the People. Hi∣story
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
alone may suffice to inform us, that this
cannot be, when there have existed so many
Kings unworthy of Command. But suppo∣sing
the Fact, it does not follow, that this
Commission is unlimited. On the contrary,
it must be limited; for who can patronize
so impious a Doctrine as that God should
give a direct Commission to any Being to
plague and persecute Mankind, unless for
their Sins? The Voice of Nature is the
Voice of God; and it is a fixed Principle in
the Law of Nature, that where there is no
common Judge to appeal to, the Party inju∣red
may do himself Justice. The Laws are
superior to the King, and these he must be
judged by. And supposing an absolute Go∣vernment
in the strictest Sense, where the
King's Will is Law, yet there is always one
Law above him. If his Actions generally
tend to Destruction, instead of Government,
the People, who have no Judge to appeal to,
may lawfully do themselves Right. <HI>Salus
populi est suprema lex.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204"/>
BUT after all, where is the Necessity of
God's extraordinary Interposition, by grant∣ing
his immediate Commission to Kings,
when in other Matters he chuses to govern
the World by second Causes and ordinary
Means. Why should we suppose, that Man∣kind
are deprived of their natural Privilege
of chusing their first Magistrate, more than
of chusing those that are subordinate? Where
is this Commission recorded? Is it given to
all Rulers who have the Name of <HI>King,</HI> or
are some Nations peculiarly honoured? Is it
given to all Sovereigns in general, whether
honoured with the Name of <HI>King</HI> or not?
Had all the Crown-Vassals in <HI>France,</HI> Dukes,
Earls, Barons, this Commission, who usurped,
and, for many Ages, possessed a Sort of Sove∣reignty
within their own Territories? These
are puzzling Questions, and it would require
a most express Revelation to put an End to
the Doubts that arise from them. The le∣gislative
Power one should imagine is of a
superior Rank to that of the King, because
it gives Laws to the King; yet no peculiar
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
Interposition of Providence is pretended in
its Behalf. This Body is left to be model∣led
by Choice or by Accident. The Govern∣ment
of the World is after this Manner car∣ried
on; and yet nothing happens, we may
presume, contradictory to the original Plan of
Providence: Why then a peculiar Providence
in Behalf of Kings, or an immediate Revela∣tion,
when there appears to be no Necessi∣ty?
We cannot, without Impiety, admit of
the Supposition, when, so far as weak Man
can conjecture about the Operations of the
Almighty, he never interposes by extraordina∣ry
Means, unless where the ordinary Dispen∣sations
of Providence prove insufficient to an∣swer
his Purposes: We may therefore con∣clude,
with the highest Degree of Assu∣ance,
that Kings have no other Commissi∣on
from God, but what every Magistrate
has, supreme and subordinate, who is legal∣ly
elected according to the standing Laws of
the Society to which he belongs.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206"/>
BUT Doubts and Difficulties multiply up∣on
us. Were all the Nations pointed out by
an express Revelation, who, like the <HI>Jews</HI> of
old, are to be governed by Magistrates of
God's express Appointment. Were all the
Families pointed out who are to bear his
Commission, the Revelation would still be
imperfect. It is not enough to point out the
Family; the Rules of Succession must also be
ascertained, that there be no Dispute about
the particular Persons who are to enjoy this
Hereditary-indefeasible Right. Here, without
a new Revelation, we are left in a great Mea∣sure
at an Uncertainty; for are we to follow
the Rules of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>France?</HI> Are we to
be guided by the Law as at present establish∣ed,
or as it was three Centuries ago? What∣ever
Rules are followed, we must see that they
are in a great Measure arbitrary, the Offspring
of Accident, or of the slenderest Feelings of
the Imagination, and established by Custom
only. Has not this a strong Appearance of
leaving to every Nation the Choice of their
own chief Magistrates? Kings were at first
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
generally chosen for Life. It crept into Prac∣tice
to make all publick Offices hereditary;
and so the sovereign Power has generally
come to be hereditary, partly from the Bent
of the People and partly to avoid the Incon∣veniencies
which elective Monarchy is sub∣jected
to. But after what Manner is this he∣reditary
Right of Kings carried on? Not by a∣ny
universal Law, expresly revealed or wrought
into the Nature of Man; so far from it, that
the Rules of Succession are different in every
different Country, established by Custom a∣lone,
or, in other Words, by the Consent of
the People. In <HI>France,</HI> for Example, the Fe∣males
are totally excluded. Have Females
by the Appointment of the Almighty this in∣defeasible
Right of Succession? If they have,
<HI>France</HI> for many Ages have been in a damn∣able
Error. If not, the Load of the Guilt
must ly upon <HI>England,</HI> and upon many other
Countries who admit of Female Succession.
In my Apprehension, this Consequence can∣not
be evaded, otherways than by fairly ac∣knowledging,
that God in this Matter, as
<PB N="207" REF="208"/>
well as in others, works by second Causes
without any direct Interposition, leaving eve∣ry
Nation to be governed by Laws of their
own Appointment. And indeed nothing looks
liker a Contradiction, than to suppose, that
hereditary Monarchy is the Appointment of
the Almighty, and that he has bestowed upon
every Heir an indefeasible Right, not to be
dispensed with upon any Occasion whatever,
without pointing out, by infallible Marks,
the Persons who are to enjoy this extraordi∣nary
Privilege; commanding us, under the
Pain of Damnation, to give entire Submission
to Persons, as Rulers appointed by him, with∣out
reyealing who these Persons are.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Inference may be drawn from
this Doubtfulness of the Law of Succession.
It is a self-evident Proposition, that no Right
can be stronger, than the Title upon which
it is founded. No Title is more slender, in
most Instances, than that of Succession. How
then can it be maintained, that the hereditary
Right of Kings is indefeasible, when the Title
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
upon which the Right is founded is so weak
and so arbitrary. I think we may with Cer∣tainty
conclude, that such a Right must, upon
every Occasion, give Place to the primary
Rights of Nature, such as tend to our Pre∣servation
and Well-being: And therefore that
any particular Heir may be safely set aside,
when he becomes dangerous to the Society.
For this is assuredly the Voice of God, That
in every Conflict the weaker Right must yield
to the stronger. Nay, we may go one Step
further, that if the Good of the Society can
be more promoted by a different Form of Go∣vernment,
hereditary Right may be laid aside
altogether without any Crime; since the Good
of the Society is an Object of much greater
Importance than the Right of any particular
Family can be.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the Family of <HI>Stewart,</HI> no
Right has a less Air of Divine Authority, than
what they had to the Crown of <HI>Britain.</HI> To
look no further back than to the Competition
betwixt <HI>Bruce</HI> and <HI>Baliol,</HI> which, in these
<PB N="209" REF="210"/>
Days, appeared, and truly was an intricate
Affair: Was <HI>Baliol</HI> a King by Divine Ap∣pointment,
when he was acknowledged and
submitted to, in consequence of an Award
given by <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> who plainly
manifested, by the whole Course of his Pro∣ceedings,
that he was more swayed by politi∣cal
Considerations, than by Justice and Equi∣ty?
Unhappy is the Condition of that People,
who, under the Pain of Damnation, must
yield passive Obedience and Non-resistance to
a Monarch, and yet have no better Authority
to direct their Duty, than such an Award.
It will be said, that the Merits of the Cause
were with <HI>Baliol.</HI> But how the Patrons of
the Divine Right of Kings should come to a
Certainty in this Matter, I'm at a Loss to
understand. For not to mention the Preten∣sions
of his Competitor <HI>Bruce,</HI> it is perhaps
not extremely clear, that a Female has any
Divine Right to a Crown; at least, there is
no Instance of this amongst the <HI>Jews.</HI> And
if Females are admitted, I cannot see why the
Kingdom ought not to be split amongst Fe∣male
<PB N="210" REF="211"/>
Heirs, as well as a private Estate. If
Right to a Crown be considered as a Matter
of Property, there certainly ought to be no
Difference. But laying aside all Difficulties,
and supposing <HI>Baliol</HI>'s Right of Primogeni∣ture
to be invincibly good, 'tis plain <HI>Robert
Bruce</HI> could have no Divine Right, nor can
the <HI>Stewart</HI>'s have a Divine Right who de∣rive
their Right from him. It is but a mean
Subterfuge, That none of <HI>Baliol</HI>'s Race ap∣pear
to claim the Crown. Will it be said, that
this Nation continued in an obstinate Course
of Rebellion against the King of Heaven, so
long as any of <HI>Baliol's</HI> Race existed? How
do we know they do not at present exist? It
is our indispensible Duty to search for the King
whom God has given us, thro' every Corner
of the Earth. And 'tis equally our Duty to
refuse our Obedience to an Usurper; and he
must be so, who has not a hereditary Right,
and consequently, is not of God's Appoint∣ment.
Let us keep in View that Prescripti∣on,
positive or negative, can avail nothing,
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
which has no other Foundation but universal
Consent, implied from a long Acquiescence.</P>
<P>THE Asserters of this Divine Right dare
not yield, that <HI>Baliol</HI> forfeited the Crown of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> by acknowledging himself to be the
King of <HI>England</HI>'s Vassal; for this would be
justifying the late Revolution in every Point.
Making an independent Kingdom a Fief of
another Sovereignty, is not more subversive
of the Constitution, than the Measures are,
which were pursued by <HI>James</HI> VII. during
the whole Course of his Reign. And if the
People of <HI>Scotland</HI> could lawfully judge, that
<HI>Baliol</HI> had subverted the Constitution, and
upon that Judgment transfer the Crown to
another; the People of <HI>Britain</HI> had the same
Title to give Judgment against <HI>James</HI> VII.
and to declare that he had forfeited the Crown.</P>
<P>WITH regard to <HI>England,</HI> the Pretext of
a Divine Right is still more lame, if possible.
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror was a Bastard, and
could have no Divine Right to the Dukedom
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
of <HI>Normandy;</HI> nor did he himself pretend any
other Right to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> than
by the Testament of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor.
But supposing him to have conquered <HI>England,</HI>
which will not be readily yielded, he certain∣ly
did not conquer his <HI>Norman</HI> Subjects who
came over with him to <HI>England,</HI> and from
whom, for ought we know, a great Part of
the Nation are descended. The <HI>Stewarts</HI>
therefore who have no other Claim to the
Crown of <HI>England,</HI> but by a Female Con∣nection
with the Race of <HI>William</HI> the Con∣queror,
cannot, with any Shadow of Reason,
insist upon their beloved Doctrine of a Divine
Right, so far as concerns the <HI>English,</HI> who
are of <HI>Norman</HI> Extraction.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, supposing the heredita∣ry
Right of Kings to be the Appointment of
God, indefeasible and indispensable, the fol∣lowing
Points ought to be ascertained; <HI>1mo,</HI>
Whether this Law be universal, to take Place
over the whole Earth, or if it be limited to
certain Nations, and what these Nations are.
<PB N="213" REF="214"/>
<HI>2do,</HI> To what particular Families does this
Divine Right belong, who are thus made su∣perior
to the rest of Mankind. <HI>3tio,</HI> The
Rules of Succession, which concern these
particular Families, ought to be distinct and
perspicuous, so as to procure a perfect A∣greement
amongst Mankind, as about the
primary Laws of Nature. <HI>4to,</HI> These Rules
ought to be wrought into our Nature, and
the Transgression of them attended with the
strongest Sense of Immorality, like Treach∣ery
or Murder. Were these Points thorough∣ly
cleared, the Scheme might be consistent.
But as it stands, it is attended with Doubts
and Darkness, to lead every honest Heart
who espouses it, into endless Perplexities.</P>
<P>MODERN Histories are full of the Evils
occasioned by disputed Successions; they are
still fuller of the Evils occasioned by Contests
about the King's Prerogative. There can
be no Moderation in such Controversies,
where God Almighty is made a Party, and e∣very
Person called <HI>impious</HI> who takes the op∣posite
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
Side. Hereby it comes, that this Doc∣trine
of the hereditary indefeasible Right of
Kings seldom fails to break the Peace of So∣ciety,
to foster inveterate Enmities, and to
be the Source of endless Wars; of which,
were there no other Evidence, the present
Times afford a deplorable Instance. So that,
if we are to give any Parent to this Doctrine,
other than blind Enthusiasm, we can never
ascribe it to a good Being. And indeed if
there is an invisible Power, a greater Enemy
to Mankind than another, he could not pos∣sibly
instill into us a more poisonous Prin∣ciple.
Plague and Famine are nothing to it.</P>
<P>BUT, tho' I have been deservedly severe up∣on
the Doctrine, I would not be understood to
pass the same Censure upon its Votaries. I am
sensible the further removed a Tenet is from
Truth, the Difficulty of Conversion, is propor∣tionally
great. 'Tis like Love bestowed upon
an ugly Woman, which is observed to be ever
without Bounds. The <HI>Jacobites,</HI> such as are
not of a desperate Fortune, certainly deserve
<PB N="215" REF="216"/>
Compassion, even while they are laying waste
their Country by intestine Commotions. They
can have no other Motive but Principle, when
they venture their Lives and Fortunes in the
Service of their Idol Prince, as their Prospect
of Success can never balance the Hazard.
What Pity is it they were not employed in
a better Cause. But if nothing else will o∣pen
their Eyes, ought it not to have some
Weight, that there is nothing more repug∣nant
to the Laws which must govern all So∣cieties,
than for any single Man, or Set of
Men, to force their Opinion upon the Ma∣jority.
How would they relish the Behavi∣our
of a Member of their own Parliament,
who should endeavour by Force of Arms to
oblige the whole Body to submit to his Sen∣timent?
Or how would they relish it, that
a Body of Men should rise in Arms upon no
better Pretext, than the procuring Justice to
a Friend whom they suppose to be unjustly
condemned by the whole Body of Judges?
Is it not an Excuse commonly given by <HI>Ban∣ditti,</HI>
for robbing on the Highway, that they
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>
are but making Reprisals upon Account of
Goods unjustly wrested from them by Au∣thority
of Law: Yet this is precisely the
present Case. The late King <HI>James</HI> was set
aside by the sovereign Authority of the
Nation, that is, by the Act of the Majo∣rity,
who, from the very Nature of Society,
must be the ultimate Judges, in all Matters
which concern their Preservation and Well-being.
Perhaps he was unjustly condemned.
Be it so for Argument's Sake. But an ulti∣mate
Judgement must ly somewhere, with∣out
further Appeal. It must be a fundamen∣tal
Law in all Societies to acquiesce in this
ultimate Judgment, right or wrong, without
which Concord cannot be preserved, but for
a Moment. No honest Remedy after this can
remain, but to desert the Society and to join
some other, where the Rules of Justice are sup∣posed
to be better observed. Can it be thought
that the Right of any Man in a Society, sup∣posing
him to be a chief Magistrate, trusted
with the greatest Powers, is superior to the
fundamental Laws of the Society, whence
<PB N="217" REF="218"/>
he derives this Right? It is an Absurdity, the
same, as, that a Part is greater than the whole.
It were to be wished, that Gentlemen would
seriously consider this Matter, who are so stre∣nuous
for the Claim of an abdicated King,
and who would embroil Heaven and Earth
to compass the Restoration of the Family.
And would they but allow themselves to think,
with any Degree of Coolness, they would soon
be convinced, That the Peace of Society is an
Object of greater Importance than the Right
of any particular Man can be, supposing him
to be descended from a thousand Kings.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE of some Things omitted in the Essay

<P>THERE appears upon the Records a
Form of creating Peers, different from
any mentioned. One remarkable Instance,
is an Act of the 7th Parliament, <HI>James</HI> VI.
<HI>anno</HI> 1581, bearing, That the Lands of <HI>Doun,</HI>
&amp;c. were feued by Queen <HI>Mary</HI> to Sir <HI>James
Stewart</HI> of <HI>Doun</HI> Knight, his Heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> sub∣suming,

<P>THIS Form, 'tis presumed, has been in∣troduced,
in Imitation of the old Form of
creating an Earl, by erecting his Lands into
a County. And hence the Design and Use of
erecting Lands into a <HI>Dominium</HI> or Lordship.
Patents in the above Form are doubtless of the
King's Grant, as well as other Patents. This,
