Language and Manners required.—It has more

<P>Now Nephew, consider once again, before I open
the Matter to my Neighbour <HI>Heartly,</HI> what I am
going to undertake for you.—Why don't you
speak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it proper and decent, Uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! don't be a Fool—but answer me—don't
you flatter yourself.—What Assurance have you
that this young Lady, my Friend's Ward, has a
liking to you? The young Fellows of this Age
are all Coxcombs, and I am afraid, you are no
Exception to the general Rule.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you Uncle—But may I this Instant be
struck old and peevish, if I would put you upon
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
a false Scent to expose you for all the fine Wo∣men
in Christendom.—I assure you again and
again, and you may take my Word, Uncle, that
Miss <HI>Harriet</HI> has no kind of Aversion to your Ne∣phew
and most humble Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay,—Vanity!—Vanity!—but I
never take a young Fellow's Word about Women;
they'll lye as fast, and with as little Conscience, as
the <HI>Brussels Gazette.</HI>—Produce your Proofs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't your Eyes see 'em, Uncle, without urging
me to the Indelicacy of repeating 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I see nothing but a Fool's Head and a
Fool's Coat, supported by a pair of most unpro∣mising
Legs. Have you no better Proofs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have, my good Infidel Uncle, half a
hundred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out with them then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>First then—Whenever I see her, she never looks
at me.—That's a Sign of Love.—Whenever I
speak to her, she never answers me.—Another
Sign of Love.—And whenever I speak to any
Body else, she seems to be perfectly easy.—That's
a certain Sign of Love.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil it is!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I am with her, she's always grave; and
the Moment I get up to leave her, then the
poor Thing begins—“Why will you leave me,
Mr. <HI>Clackit;</HI> can't you sacrifice a few Moments
to my Bashfulness?—Stay, you agreeable Run∣away,
stay, I shall soon overcome the Fears your
Presence gives me.”—I cou'd say more,—
But a Man of Honour, Uncle—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and has she said all these Things to
you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, and ten times more—with her Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>With her Eyes!—Eyes are very equivocal, <HI>Jack.</HI>—However,
if the young Lady has any Liking
to you, Mr. <HI>Heartly</HI> is too much a Man of the
World, and too much my Friend, to oppose the
Match; so do you walk into the Garden, and I
will open the Matter to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there any Objection to my staying, Uncle?
The Business will be soon ended.—You will pro∣pose
the Match, he will give his Consent, I shall
give mine, Miss is sent for, and <HI>l'affair est fait.</HI></P>

so strong and healthy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can return you the Compliment, my Friend,—Without
Flattery you don't look more than
Thirty-five; and between ourselves, you are on
the wrong Side of Forty—But Mum for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ease and Tranquility keep me as you see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why don't you marry Neighbour? A good Wife
would do well for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>For me? you are pleased to be merry Sir <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith, I am serious, and had I a Daughter
to recommend to you, you should say me nay more
than once, I assure you, Neighbour <HI>Heartly,</HI> be∣fore
I would quit you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much obliged to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>But indeed, you are a little too much of the
Philosopher, to think of being troubled with Wo∣men
and their Concerns.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Pardon Sir <HI>Charles</HI>—Tho' there are
many, who call themselves Philosophers, that live
single, and perhaps are in the right of it, yet I
cannot think that Marriage is at all inconsistent
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
with true Philosophy.—A wise Man will resolve to
live like the rest of the World, with this only Dif∣ference,
that he is neither a Slave to Passions nor
Events.—It is not because I have a little Philoso∣phy,
but because I am on the wrong Side of forty
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that I desire to be excused <HI>(smiling).</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you please, Sir,—and now to my Business—You
have no Objection I suppose to tie up your
Ward, Miss <HI>Harriet,</HI> though you have slipped the
Collar yourself—Ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the contrary, Sir; I have taken her some
time from the Boarding School, and brought her
home, in order to dispose of her worthily, with
her own Inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Father, I have heard you say, recommended
that particular Care to you, when she had reached
a certain Age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did so—and I am the more desirous to obey
him scrupulously in this Circumstance, as she will
be a most valuable Acquisition to the Person who
shall gain her—for, not to mention her Fortune,
which is the least Consideration, her Sentiments are
worthy her Birth; she is gentle, modest, and
obliging.—In a Word, my Friend, I never saw
Youth more amiable or discreet,—but perhaps I am
a little partial to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, she is a delicious Creature, every body
says so.—But I believe, Neighbour, something has
happened that you little think off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, pray Sir <HI>Charles?</HI></P>

Matter in a Moment—Miss <HI>Harriet,</HI> Sir,—Your
Ward.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll excuse me, Mr. <HI>Heartly</HI>—My Uncle does
not set up for an Orator,—a little confused, or so,
Sir,—You see me what I am,—But I ought to ask
Pardon for the young Lady and myself.—We are
young, Sir,—I must confess we were wrong to con∣ceal
it from you,—but my Uncle I see is pleased
to be angry, and therefore, I shall say no more at
present.</P>

<P>If you don't leave the Room this Moment, and
stay in the Garden, till I call you—</P>

<P>I am sorry I have displeased you—I did not think
it was <HI>mal-a-propos;</HI> but you must have your way
Uncle—You command—I submit—Mr. <HI>Heartly,</HI>
your's.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit Young</HI> Clackit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Puppy! (<HI>aside</HI>) My Nephew's a little unthink∣ing,
Mr. <HI>Heartly,</HI> as you see, and therefore I have
been a little cautious how I have proceeded in this
Affair: But indeed, he has perswaded me in a
Manner, that your Ward and he are not ill to∣gether.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! This is the first Notice I have had of
it, and I cannot conceive why Miss <HI>Harriet</HI> should
conceal it from me; for I have often assured her,
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
that I would never oppose her Inclination, though
I might endeavour to direct it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis human Nature, Neighbour,—We are so
ashamed of our first Passion, that we would willing∣ly
hide it from ourselves—But will you mention
my Nephew to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must beg your Pardon, Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>—The
Name of the Gentleman whom she chuses, must
first come from herself,—My Advice or Importu∣nity
shall never influence her: If Guardians would
be less rigorous, young People would be more
reasonable; and I am so unfashionable to think,
that Happiness in Marriage can't be bought too
dear.—I am still on the wrong Side of Forty, Sir
<HI>Charles.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no,—You are right Neighbour,—But here
she is,—Don't alarm her young Heart too much, I
beg of you,—Upon my Word, she is a sweet Morsel.</P>

for shame, Madam! Young Ladies of Fashion
are not frightened at such Things now a days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY <HI>to Sir</HI> CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have gone too far, Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>—We must
excuse her Delicacy, and give her Time to re∣cover,—I
had better talk with her alone; we will
leave her now;—Be perswaded that no En∣deavours
shall be wanting on my Part, to bring this
Affair to a happy and a speedy Conclusion.</P>
</SP>

<P>I shall be obliged to you, Mr. <HI>Heartly.</HI>—Young
Lady your Servant.—What Grace and Modesty!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Miss <HI>Harriet,</HI> you are very particular;
you was tired of the Boarding School, and yet seem
to have no Inclination to be married.—What can be
the Meaning of all this?—That smirking old Gentle∣man
is Uncle to Mr. <HI>Clackit;</HI> and, my Life for it,
he has made some Proposals to your Guardian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee don't plague me about Mr. <HI>Clackit.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why not, Miss? Tho' he is a little fantasti∣cal,
loves to hear himself talk, and is somewhat self-sufficient;
you must consider he is young, has been
abroad, and keeps good Company:—The trade will
soon be at an end, if young Ladies and Gentlemen
grow over nice and exceptious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I can find one without these Faults, I may
surely please myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without these Faults! and is he young, Miss?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is sensible, modest, polite, affable, and ge∣nerous;
and charms from the natural Impulses of his
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
own Heart, as much as others disgust by their sense∣less
Airs, and insolent Affectation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word!—But why have you kept this
Secret so long?—Your Guardian is kind to you be∣yond
Conception.—What Difficulties can you have
to overcome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the Difficulty of declaring my Sentiments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave that to me, Miss.—But your Spark, with
all his Accomplishments, must have very little Pene∣tration
not to have discovered his good Fortune in
your Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take care that my Eyes don't tell too much; and
he has too much Delicacy to interpret Looks to his
Advantage. Besides, he would certainly disapprove
my Passion; and if I should ever make the Decla∣ration,
and meet with a Denial, I should abso∣lutely
die with Shame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll ensure your Life for a Silver Thimble.—But
what can possibly hinder your coming together?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Excess of Merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Excess of a Fiddlestick;—But come, I'll put
you in the way;—You shall trust me with the Secret;—I ll
entrust it again to half a dozen Friends, they
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
shall entrust it to half a dozen more, by which Means
it will travel half the Town over in a Week's time;
the Gentleman will certainly hear of it, and then if
he is not at your Feet in the fetching of a Sigh, I'll
give up all my Perquisites at your Wedding.—What
is his Name, Miss?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell you his Name,—Indeed I cannot; I
am afraid of being thought too singular.—But why
should I be ashamed of my Passion? Is the Impres∣sion
which a virtuous Character makes upon our
Hearts such a Weakness that it may not be excused?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my Faith, Miss, I can't understand you: You
are afraid of being thought singular, and you really
are so:—I would sooner renounce all the Passions in
the Universe than have one in my Bosom beating
and fluttering itself to pieces—Come, come, Miss,
open the Window and let the poor Devil out.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can I possibly say to him? I am as much
ashamed to make the Declaration, as he would be to
understand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't imagine, my Dear, that I would know
more of your Thoughts than you desire I should;
but the tender Care which I have ever shewn, and
the sincere Friendship which I shall always have for
you, give me a sort of Right to enquire into every
thing that concerns you.—Some Friends have spoken
to me in particular,—But that is not all,—I have
lately found you thoughtful, absent, and disturbed;—Be
plain with me,—Has not some body been
happy enough to please you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny it, Sir;—Yes,—Somebody indeed
has pleased me;—But I must intreat you not to give
Credit to any idle Stories, or enquire farther into the
Particulars of my Inclination; for I cannot possibly
have Resolution enough to say more to you.</P>

<P>But have you made a Choice, my Dear?</P>

to make a better;—Reason, Honour, every thing
must approve it.</P>

this; and, if I am not mistaken, it is a Struggle be∣tween
her Reason and her Passion, that occasions all
this Confusion.—But here she is.</P>

<P>I hope you are not angry, Sir, that I left you so

<P>I am angry that you think any Apology necessary.—The
Matter we were upon was of such a delicate

Nature, that I was more pleased with your Confusion,
than I should have been with your Excuses.—You'll
pardon me, my Dear.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have reflected, that the Person for whom I have
conceiv'd a most tender Regard, may, from the wisest
Motives, doubt of my Passion; and therefore I
would endeavour to answer all his Objections, and
convince him how deserving he is of my highest Es∣teem.</P>

<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not yet apprehended what kind of Dispute
could arise between you and Mr. <HI>Clackit:</HI>—I would
advise you both to come to a Reconciliation as soon as
possible.—The Law of Nature is an imperious one,
and cannot, like those of our Country, be easily
evaded; and though Reason may suggest some dis∣agreeable
Reflections, yet when the Stroke is to be
given, we must submit to it.</P>

You fear that the World will not be so readily con∣vinced
of this young Gentleman's Merit as you are:
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
And, indeed, I could wish him more deserving of
you; but your Regard for him gives him a Merit
he otherwise would have wanted, and almost makes
me blind to his Failings.</P>

consult your own Heart upon such an Occasion.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that is your Advice, I will most religiously fol∣low
it; and, for the last time, I am resolved to dis∣cover
my real Sentiments; but as a Confession of this
kind will not become me, I have been thinking of
some innocent Stratagem to spare my Blushes, and in

I be permitted to write to him?—</P>

absolutely said she did; who knows but she has at
last opened her Mind to my good Master, and
he, finding her Taste (like that of other Girls at

so Complaisant as he used to be.—What a
Shame it is that I don't know more of this Mat∣ter,
a Wench of Spirit, as I am, a Favourite of

It is an Affront to my Character, and I must have
Satisfaction immediately.—(<HI>Going.</HI>) I will go
directly to my young Mistress, teize her to death,

his Guard against the Approaches of Vanity, yet
he will find himself weak in that Quarter.—
Had not my Reason made a little Stand against
my Presumption, I might have interpreted some
of <HI>Harriet</HI>'s Words in my own Favour; but—
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
I may well blush, tho' alone, at my extravagant
Folly!—Can it be possible that so young a Crea∣ture
shou'd even cast a Thought of that kind upon
me?—Upon me! Presumptuous Vanity!—
No, no,—I will do her and myself the Justice
to acknowledge that, for a very few slight Ap∣pearances,
there are a thousand Reasons that de∣stroy
so ridiculous a Supposition.</P>

Well, my dear Uncle, what are you astonished,

<P>Bless me, Mr. <HI>Heartly,</HI> what is all this Music

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I brought the Gentlemen of the String, Made∣moiselle,
to convince you, that I feel, as I ought,
the Honour you have done me—(<HI>Shewing the
Letter.</HI>) But for Heaven's sake be sincere a little
with these good Folks; they tell me here that I am
Nobody, and there is another happier than myself,
and for the Soul of me, I don't know how to be∣lieve
'em,—Ha, ha, ha!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hear Miss speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a most terrible Task; but I am compel'd
to it, and to hesitate any longer wou'd be injurious
to my Guardian, his Friend, this young Gentleman,

<P>C'est vrai.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore, before I declare my Sentiments, it is
proper that I disavow any Engagement:—but at the

<P>It is a Power indeed which he despises.—I cannot
be deceived in his Conduct.—Modesty may tye the
Tongue of our Sex, but Silence in him could proceed
only from Contempt.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>How prettily she reproaches me!—But I'll soon
make it up with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that Letter, Sir; your Error there, is ex∣cusable;
and I own myself in that Particular a little
blameable—But it was not my Fault that it was sent

to you; and the Contents must have told you, that
it could not possibly be meant for you. (<HI>To</HI> Y. Clackit.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proof positive, <HI>Jack:</HI>—Say no more.—Now is
my Time to begin.—Hem!—hem!—Sweet young
Lady,—hem!—whose Charms are so mighty, so far
transcending every thing that we read of, in History
or Fable, how could you possibly think that my Si∣lence
proceeded from Contempt? Was it natural
or prudent, think you, for a Man of sixty-five, nay,
just entering into his sixty-sixth year—</P>

<P>Proof positive, Uncle—And very positive.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been led into a Mistake, Madam, which I
hope you will excuse; and I have made myself very
ridiculous, which I hope I shall forget:—And so,
Madam, I am your humble Servant.—This young

<P>O my <HI>Harriet!</HI>—I too must be disgrac'd in my
Turn.—Can you think that I have seen and convers'd
with you unmov'd?—Indeed I have not.—The
more I was sensible of your Merit, the stronger were
my Motives to stifle the Ambition of my Heart.—
But now I can no longer resist the Violence of my
Passion, which casts me at your Feet, the most un∣worthy
indeed of all your Admirers, but of all the
most affectionate.</P>

<P>I have refused my Hand to Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and this

the other of Singularity.—Should I refuse my Hand
a third Time, (<HI>smiling</HI>) I might draw upon myself
a more servere Reproach,—and therefore I accept
your Favour, Sir, and will endeavour to deserve it.</P>

<P>Since Matters are so well settled, give me leave,

is too green it sets one's Teeth on edge, and when too
mellow it has no Flavour at all.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. CLACKIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you have me say, Sir? I am too
much a Philosopher to fret myself, because the Wind,
which was East this Morning, is now West.—The
poor Girl in pique has kill'd herself, to be reveng'd
on me; but hark'ye, Sir, I believe <HI>Heartly</HI> will be
cursed mad to have me live in his Neighbourhood.—
A Word to the Wise.—</P>

<P>I hope, Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that we shall still continue to
