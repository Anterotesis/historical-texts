<HEAD>PREFACE, Directed to those who are for Carrying on this WAR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are not here enquiring into, or ma∣king Reflections upon, those who for private Ends of their own, whether Party Ends, or Personal, are, or have been, for prolonging the War.</P>
<P>The popular Objection is, that we are bound not to enter into any Treaty with the Enemy without Consent of our Allies, and the first and Principal Person in the Alliance is the Em∣peror, who refuses to come to this Treaty or to make Peace with <HI>F ance,</HI> and without him you ought not to attempt it.</P>
<P>The Reasons why the Emperor insists thus against a Treaty are needless to be Discoursed, since his Answer is positive; and as his Impe∣rial Majesty Expresses in his l etter to the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> quoted in these Sheets, his Resolution for the War is irrevocable. Now
<PB REF="3"/>
what signifies Discussing Reasons, when the Party declares himself fix'd, and irrevocable?</P>
<P>The following Sheets are a brief Calculation of the Conduct and the Management of our Glorious Ally, the Emperor particularly in his <HI>Spanish</HI> Capacity, from whence the Reader, by drawing such Inferences as are suitable to the Honour of his Queen, and his Country, and those who would continue the War, purely to gra∣tifie, serve, and oblige, an Ally, may see here what they have to expect from him, and for what kind of Treatment the Blood and Treasure of this Kingdom, which they would so lavishly bestow, is to be expended. It is hoped the Considera∣tion of this may a little move them, which if it should, the Author of these Sheets will think the Time and Labour very well bestowed.</P>

<HEAD>Imperial Gratitude.</HEAD>
<P>THE Title of this Book seems so well to direct the Reader to the Design, that it stands in need of very little Introduction. The Endea∣vour us'd of late to extol and advance the Interest and Conduct of the Emperor, as the most Considerable of the Allies, and Powerful enough to do Great Things of himself, so as to make his present Conduct the Rule by which to direct and judge of Publick Affairs, makes it necessary to enquire a little into these Things; and state them indifferently to the World, that Peo∣ple may no more be impos'd upon about them: To which Purpose we are at present to enter a little into the Conduct of the Person now sitting on the Imperial Throne in his past and present Capacity, confi∣ning our Enquiry, however particularly, to what relates to him as an Ally, and as his Conduct respects Her Majesty, the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
Previous to this it may fall in our Way to enquire or speak a little of the last Emperors Father and Brother, to the Present, and of the Empire itself, of both only with Respect to the Grand Alliance, and the Succession to the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Subsequent to this it may fall in the Way to say something to the Conduct of Her Majesty, the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as it relates to the Person of the present Empe∣ror, and the Interest of the last, and the Obligations which one of them may be under to the other.</P>
<P>These Things lead us to make this Book very much a Search into History, and will fill it with some Original Papers, which every one may not have seen; it will be obvious to every observing Eye whether his Imperial Majesty has return'd a reci∣procal Kindness, or shewn a suitable Re∣spect to Her <HI>British</HI> Majesty for the Kind∣ness and Services he has received: In doing this we shall only proceed to lay down Matter of Fact, without passing our own Judgment therewith: It shall be in no one's Power to charge us with Indecency to, and Reflection on, his Imperial Majesty, the Application of all being left by Way of Question to every Reader to make for himself.</P>
<P>In Pursuit therefore of this Just Enquiry, we must, First, Enter a little into the History of the Emperor, and Empire itself as it re∣lates
<PB REF="6"/>
to the Grand Alliance, where without any Impartiality we shall see, whether it has not been the constant Care and Concern of the Queen of <HI>England</HI> to promote the Interest of the Emperor, not as Emperor only, but even the Family Interest of the Emperor, as Head of the House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>The First Testimony we have of this, is in the very Beginning of the Grand Alli∣ance, on which the present War was found∣ed, and is now carried on; where the Interest of his Imperial Majesties House is made an Essential Article of the said Alliance; and no Peace is to be made till the Emperor receive Satisfaction for his Pretensions to the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> as in the Eight Article of the said Alliance is express'd thus. <HI>An Equitable and Reasonable Satisfaction to his Imperial Majesty for his Pretensions to the Dominions of the</HI> Spanish <HI>Monarchy,</HI> &amp;c. and the like in the Second Article. <HI>Vid.</HI> the Treaty.</P>
<P>It is to be noted here, that at the Time of making this Alliance, the <HI>French</HI> King having set up his Grandson <HI>Philip</HI> on the Throne of <HI>Spain</HI> upon the Pretensions, and by such Arts and Management, of which History is full; the Emperor having a ma∣nifest Right to the Succession of <HI>Spain,</HI> and resolving to put in his said Claim, prepared for War.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
The Confederates, who were every one preparing at the same Time to attack <HI>France</HI> for the New Attempts which he had made, in Breach of the <HI>Treaty of Partition,</HI> had every one their several Pretensions. The <HI>Dutch</HI> for the Loss of their Barrier; the <HI>English</HI> for the Danger of their Com∣merce, and the Setting up a Pretender; the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> his Offensive Treaties, and the like; and all were the more willing to put their Demands together, that they might mutually assist each other in One General War and Confederacy: To this End a Congress was appointed at the <HI>Hague</HI> to concert their respective Claims, and form a <HI>Grand Alliance,</HI> by which they might go on upon <HI>France,</HI> as a United Body, that one might not taste of good or bad Success with∣out the other. This was in the Year 1702.</P>
<P>When this Meeting was first made, the Debate was not, who should, or should not, possess the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, this was not en∣tred into in the least; only in general a Sa∣tisfaction was to be given to his Imperial Majesty for his Pretensions, as above; and therefore those Authors, who contend that this Satisfaction to be given his Imperial Majesty was nothing but putting the said Monarchy into his Hands, <HI>are so far in the Wrong;</HI> and it was urged in the said Con∣gress what was formerly in the <HI>Treaty of Partition</HI> made by King <HI>William. (viz.) That in Order to prevent too many Domini∣ons</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>
<HI>falling into the Hand of any One Prince, therefore</HI>—&amp;c. (viz.) <HI>The same Person was never to be Emperor and King of</HI> Spain, <HI>or King of</HI> France <HI>and King of</HI> Spain, <HI>at the same Time;</HI> in Consequence of which Debate, it was agreed, that the Emperor should take it for Satisfaction, that the Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> should be consign'd over by him, and be by the Allies engaged to the next Prince of his House, which was upon the Consideration before mentioned, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the <HI>Imperial</HI> Crown, and that of <HI>Spain,</HI> ought not to be at one and the same Time, in one and the same Person. This we mention here, not to concern this Tract in any of the Common Debates, which make so much Noise in the Publick Prints; but as it necessarily comes to be mentioned here, in order to clear up the Point, how, and by what Means, the Per∣son of the present Emperor, being then Arch-duke <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> and no more, came to be named to the Crown and Do∣minions of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The Person who named him first, and whose Schemes gave the first Birth to this Proposition, was the <HI>Almirant de Castile,</HI> a Prince of the greatest Penetration into the Affairs of <HI>Spain,</HI> and who was at this Time fled from <HI>Spain</HI> into <HI>Portugal,</HI> whose Con∣duct in those Affairs was so fatal to the <HI>French</HI> Faction, that Means was soon found, as we have heard suggested, to convey him
<PB REF="9"/>
into another World. But as soon as the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> (for then the Union was not,) receiv'd the Proposal, Her Ma∣jesty especially espoused the Interest of this Young Prince, and by Her Ambassador at <HI>Vienna</HI> so far concerned herself in his Behalf, as also with the other Confederates, that the said Arch-duke <HI>Charles</HI> was de∣clar'd King of <HI>Spain</HI> at <HI>Vienna</HI> 12th of <HI>September,</HI> 1703, <HI>N. S.</HI> by his Father, the Emperor <HI>Leopold,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Joseph,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> afterwards Emperor; who for themselves, and their other Heirs, solemnly resign'd their Right and Claim to the same; and as these Things are not left upon Record to every Eye, it may not be improper to give you this short Abridgment of the Manner of it.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD><HI>Vienna, September</HI> 18th, 1703.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the <HI>12</HI>th of this Instant, in the Morning, the Emperor and the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> Sign'd, and Swore, to an Act, by which they both resign'd all their Right and Claim to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, in Favour of the Arch-duke <HI>Charles.</HI> The same Day, about Four in the Afternoon, all the Privy-Councellors were summon'd to the Council-Chamber, where the Emperor, the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the Arch-duke, were pre∣sent:
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
At what Time the Emperor made a short Speech, importing, That the Branch of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> being Extinct by the Death of the Deceas'd King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, that Monarchy with the Domini∣ons annex'd to it, were devolv'd upon him; and therefore being importun'd by his Illustri∣ous Confederates, and among the rest, by the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to provide a Successor to that Mo∣narchy, he had thought fit to send over to <HI>Spain</HI> his Second Son, the Arch-duke <HI>Charles,</HI> in order to be put into Possession of the said King∣dom, and the Dominions thereunto belonging. To which Purpose his said Imperial Majesty, and the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> had thought it requisite to make a Resignation of all their Right and Title to the Crown, saving however to themselves the Rights of the Empire; in Pur∣suance of which Resolution, and Renunciation, they declar'd and acknowledg'd the said Arch-duke to be King of <HI>Spain.</HI> After the Empe∣ror had concluded, the Chancellor of the Court read both the Acts of Renunciation, as well in Behalf of his Imperial Majesty, as of the King of the <HI>Romans;</HI> as also another Act on the Behalf of the Arch-duke, containing, as some say, his Acceptance of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Crown, and a relinquishing of all his Right and Claim to the Dominions of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> in the Empire. Which done, the Emperor, and the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> re∣pair'd to an Altar, erected at the End of the
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
Room, where they swore to the Religious Ob∣servance of the Conditions and Stipulations of the said Act, as did also the Arch-duke for his Part, the Gospels being presented to their Majesty's by Cardinal <HI>Colonitz.</HI></P>
<P>Here it is acknowledged, that this was done at the Instance of Her Majesty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> the latter was influenced by the <HI>Almirant de Castile,</HI> as above.</P>
<P>And to give a Testimony of the early Obligations of this Prince to Her Majesty, here follows the Translation of a Letter, written by the Emperor <HI>Leopold</HI> with his own Hand to Her Majesty, recommend∣ing the New King to Her, as to his Mo∣ther, acknowledging the Great Instrument Her Majesty had been in procuring that Honour to his Son, and expressing what none indeed for ever after could doubt but would be found, in a Person of true Ho∣nour; <HI>(viz.)</HI> a lasting Obligation of Thank∣fulness and Gratitude: We shall make no Comment hereupon, the Thing speaks itself; the Letter follows <HI>thus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A <HI>Letter</HI> from the Emperor to Her <HI>Majesty.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Leopoldus, Imp. Semp. Aug. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ACcording to our Mutual Friendship, we do, by these Presents, signifie to your Serenity, with a Friendly Affection, and in a Brotherly Manner, that Yesterday, with the Consent of our First-born Son, the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> we conferr'd upon our other Son, the Arch-duke of <HI>Austria Charles</HI> the Third, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, legally de∣volv'd upon us by the Death of the Illustrious Catholick King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and did openly declare him King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> under God's Gracious Protection. This Matter has been long deliberated by us, and could not easily be adjusted, because many Things offered themselves to our Consideration <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con;</HI> but while we were in Suspence, the Judgment and Advice of your Serenity, signify'd to us by your Envoy Extraordinary, was of great Weight to remove our Doubts; and being mov'd in your Serenities Name to hasten this Declaration, and the Departure of our said Son, we did the more readily and willingly undertake it, because we have al∣ways found in your Serenity a great Foresight in giving and receiving Council, and a Faith∣ful
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
Performance of your Promises. We have also observed in your Serenity such a particu∣lar Affection and Good-will towards us and our House of <HI>Austria,</HI> that we firmly believe your Serenity will not only take what we have done in good Part, but will always regard it as your own Act. Our said Son would gladly sig∣nifie this to your Serenity, and express our Joint Gratitude and Acknowledgment of it in Person; but since the present Posture of the Common Affairs calls him further, he will perform this in another Method at his Arri∣val. But may it please your Serenity in the mean Time to allow us, since he is to leave us in a few Days, wholly to deliver him over, and to recommend him to your Serenity as to an∣other Mother, with Assurance on his Part, that as long as he lives he shall honour your Sereni∣ty with Filial Respect; and that our Family shall ever be oblig'd to serve your Serenity in the strictest Manner, and in perpetual Grati∣tude. We add no more, but our Prayers to the Almighty and Gracious God to grant your Serenity long Health, and Happy Success.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Immediately upon the Declaration and Letter abovesaid, the Young King is sent by Land from <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> and passing from thence to <HI>England,</HI> we find him re∣ceiv'd by Her Majesty with all that Good∣ness and Bounty that suited the first Steps taken for his Advancement.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14"/>
All this while it may not be amiss to note, and it seems most proper to come in here, that his Young Majesty not only owed his Access to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, to the Good-will, and particular Assistance of Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, but even all the Title and Pretence he could make to the Crown, has also its Rise in Her Maje∣sty since nothing is more notorious, than that he had no Claim of Blood to that Crown, his Father, and his Elder Brother being both at that Time alive: But as one very happily Remarks on that Subject, he had no other Title to Claim by, but what made the Title of his Rival stronger than his own. We are loth to mingle this Account with Quotations from other Authors, but the Argument brought to prove this, is thus abridged.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> had no Right to the Crown by Descent, because, tho' the Renun∣ciation of the Treaty at the <HI>Pyrennees</HI> had been of no Force, his Father, and Elder Brother, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the <HI>Dauphine,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> were both Living, and the Title, if any, was theirs before him.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> had no Right to the Crown by Descent, because, tho' <HI>Philip</HI>'s Claim had been of no Force, yet his Father, and his Elder Brother, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Emperor <HI>Leopold,</HI> and the King of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> were both Living, and the Right was theirs be∣fore him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<HI>Philip</HI> Claims by Gift from <HI>Charles</HI> II. deceased.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> Claims by Gift from the Empe∣ror his Father, and King of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> his Brother.</P>
<P>The Emperor says Crowns are not giv∣en like Gloves, and Gold Rings, at Fune∣rals; nor does a Right to Govern the Sub∣jects of <HI>Spain</HI> descend by Will and Assigna∣tion, but by Right of Blood, and Lineal Descent; and therefore <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>Spain,</HI> could not demise his Dominions to <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> says, if a Gift is not good, neither has <HI>Charles</HI> any Right more than he, who derives only from the Gift and Resignation of <HI>Leopold</HI> and <HI>Joseph,</HI> his Father, and El∣der Brother, who had no more Right to give it away, than <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>We say it seems undeniable thus.</P>
<P>That if a Gift of the Possessor is not va∣lid, neither of these Princes can make any Claim at all.</P>
<P>But if a Gift is Valid, then <HI>Philip</HI> has the best Title, because his Gift was prior to the other.</P>
<P>There is an Additional Claim, which either Parties lay respectively to this Monar∣chy, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that of the Sword; which indeed seems to be the best Right either of them have to the Claim.</P>
<P>We must indeed own a new Right since these descended to both, (1.) To King
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<HI>Charles,</HI> in that this Father, and Elder Brother, are both dead without other Issue Male. (2.) To King <HI>Philip, (viz.)</HI> that his Father be∣ing dead, there remains no Successor but the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> who being to succeed to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> is not thought of: And Possession, a Title, which if then he can keep, it will be worth all the rest.</P>
<P>But to return to the Behaviour of this King <HI>Sine-Ter,</HI> in the Introduction to his New Dominion; where it should be noted, the Intent is not here to lessen his Catho∣lick Majesty, as if he had misbehaved; on the contrary, it is certain he did all that a Prince could decently stoop to do, to let Her Majesty know, that he knew how to acknowledge the Obligation he was under; and to let the World see, it was a King paying all that just Respect to Her that made him so, which a Prince full of Gratitude, and who understood both himself, and the Favour he had receiv'd, ought to pay.</P>
<P>For this, take the short View of his Beha∣viour at <HI>Windsor,</HI> where he arriv'd 26 <HI>De∣cember,</HI> 1703, Her Majesty receiv'd him at the head of the Stairs, where his first Bow to Her Majesty seem'd by all that saw it, to signifie, that he meant to kiss the Ground at Her Feet; there he made Her Majesty a very becoming Compliment, acknowledging his great Obligations to her, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17"/>
We are the more willing to set down these Particulars, tho' they may seem tri∣fling, because they are thus far to the Case in hand, as they signifie the Just Sence his Majesty had then upon his Mind of his In∣finite Engagements to the Generosity and Kindness of the Queen.</P>
<P>Let us now follow his Majesty into his own Dominions, and there we shall find him, not only generously on all Oc∣casions acknowledging Her Majesties Goodness and Bounty, as to obtaining for him the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> but often reduc'd even to entreat and sollicit her Majesty, not only to support him in his Possession, but to rescue him from his Enemies, who had besieged him in the only City of which he was possess'd in the World; and where, but for Her Majesties Seasonable and Pow∣erful Succours, he had inevitably fallen into the Hands of his Enemies.</P>
<P>Here we find him so long confin'd, so low reduc'd, and so like to be ruined, that the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Madrid</HI> in Derision call'd him <HI>Il poco Rey de Barcelone,</HI> the little King of <HI>Bar∣celona;</HI> and even after this Deliverance there we have him reduc'd so low, as not to have even <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ad for his Houshold, or as we may say, Shoes to his Feet, but from her Maje∣sties Bounty: As these Things ought not to be said of a Person now in the most Supreme Degree of Human Dignity in the Christian World, without such Evidence of Fact, as
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
admits no Dispute; so we shall admit no E∣vidence to be sufficient, of Less Dignity than himself, having his own Hand-writing to show for every Thing as we go along, which we hope will be allow'd to be the best Kind of Testimony.</P>
<P>But to take Things in Order: Assoon as his Catholick Majesty, (so we must now call him,) came to <HI>Lisbon;</HI> among the rest of the Ceremonies paid to him there, Mr. <HI>Methuen,</HI> the Queen's Ambassador to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> sent his Son on Board the Men of War to Compliment his Majesty on his Arrival; his Majesty received him very graciously, and express'd in the most obliging Terms, <HI>the great Respect and Vene∣ration he hath for Her Majesty, and how sensi∣ble he is of the great and many Obligations he oweth Her, which he hopeth he should be so Hap∣py as to be able to return in such a Manner as might shew the whole World the grateful Sence he should always retain of Her Majesties Kind∣ness to him.</HI> The Envoy himself, who was in∣dispos'd before, had Audience of his Majesty afterwards, to Compliment him upon his safe coming on Shore, to whom again his Ca∣tholick Majesty expressed <HI>the great Respect he had for Her Majesty, and how much he thought himself obliged to Her.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may leave K. <HI>Charles</HI> a while, and go back to the Conduct of Her Majesty to the Emperor, his Father; and this may be confin'd to Two Cases.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="1$" REF="19"/>
1. The March of the Duke of <HI>Marlbo∣rough</HI> into <HI>Germany</HI> with the Confederate Army the Beginning of the Year 1704, which ended in the great Victory at <HI>Hocksted,</HI> which Victory visibly delivered the Empire from Destruction, and set his Imperial Ma∣jesty free from the Invasion of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who, as it was evident by the Steps he had already taken, would, in less than Two Months, have been at the Gates of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>This, that it may not be thought asumed, we shall give from like Authority, for there is no Proof like the Acknowledgment of Parties; indeed the History of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s March, of the Original, the Measures concerted for it, &amp;c. but above all, the Expence for it, of which 600000 <HI>l.</HI> was out of the <HI>English</HI> Treasury, would confirm it; but the Emperor's Letter to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who, upon that Occasion, he made a Prince of the Empire, leave it past all Contradiction; both what his Condition was be∣fore the Battle, and what was Effected by it.</P>

<LETTER>
<P>NOthing remains, but that I return you my most respectful Thanks for having sent me so great a Fleet, and so Good and Valiant Troops to assist me. After such Happy Begin∣nings, I thought it proper, according to the Opinion of your Generals, and Admirals, to maintain in Person the Conquest we have made, and to shew my Subjects, who are so Affectionate to my Person, that I cannot abandon them. I receive so great an Assistance from your Ma∣jesty, and your Generous Nation, that I am overcome with your Goodness; and in the greatest Confusion, that I should be the Occa∣sion of so great an Expence for the supporting my Interest: But, Madam, I give up my own Person, and my Subjects in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> who expose their Lives and Fortunes upon the As∣surances they have of your Generous Protection. Your Majesty, and your Council, know better than we what is necessary for our Preservation. We shall wait for your Majesty's Succours, with an entire Confidence in your Goodness and Wisdom. It may be seen what Forces are ne∣cessary; it may also be seen how great a Diver∣sion we shall give to <HI>France;</HI> it cannot be doubted but that they will make their utmost Efforts against me as soon as possible, and I doubt not but the same Efforts will be used by my Allies to defend me. What can be said to you, Madam? Your Goodness gives you the

Inclination, and your Power furnishes you with the Means to support those whom the Ty∣ranny of <HI>France</HI> would oppress. All that I can suggest to your Wisdom, and to that of your Allies, is, that the Forces employ'd in this Country will not remain useless to the Publick Good, but will be under an Obligation, and a Necessity to act with the utmost Vigour against the Enemy. I am ever, with the most Sincere Affection, Respect, and Gratitude.</P>

<P>None can say but his Catholick Majesty expresses himself here like a Man of Ho∣nour; and like a Prince, that had on his Mind deep Impressious of what has been done for him; and indeed all his Letters seem to signifie, that his Majesty thought he could never enough extol Her Majesties Goodness to him, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall see g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ater Occasion still, for him both to want, and to acknowledge the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>

<P>It seems, by the Enemies Motions, they have already received Notice of your Approach, but instead of thinking to retreat, they have redoubled their Efforts, and fire upon the Breach, which will be in a Condition to be stormed after to Morrow at farthest, and in all Appearance they will make a desperate At∣tempt to render themselves Masters of this Town before the Fleet can arrive with the Suc∣cours.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Thus far the Distresses of this Prince are at large expressed under his own Hand, and those of his Servants, for he is very remarkable for being full of Letters; we could fill a great Part of this Tract with his Letters to the Queen, to the States-Gene∣ral, to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and se∣veral others, upon the happy Deliverance which was wrought for him by the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Succours, but we spare the Reader that Trouble for want of Room; every one knows that <HI>Barcelona</HI> was relieved by
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
Sir <HI>John Leake,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Bing;</HI> it shall suffice to note, that it was done at such a Crisis of Time, that the Fleet was no sooner in the Road, but the King sent on Board to desire that some of the For∣ces might immediately Land, lest the Town might be lost while they were look∣ing on, for that they expected the Enemy would storm the Breach that very Night.</P>
<P>But the Obligations his Catholick Maje∣sty has to the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> are not yet at an End, and we must follow the farther Course of his Reign through several Vi∣cissitudes of Fortune. The Current of his Good Success carried him a great Way at this Time; he saw his Rival fled, himself surrounded with a gallant Body of <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops, <HI>Catalonia</HI> all his own, part of <HI>Valencia</HI> possessed, and some of <HI>Arragon;</HI> but this not all; immediately News comes to him, that the Earl of <HI>Gall∣way,</HI> with another <HI>English</HI> Army in Con∣junction with the <HI>Portugueze,</HI> had march∣ed into the Heart of <HI>Spain,</HI> and had taken the Capital, the Royal Palace and City of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and he had nothing to do but to go and take Possession. What Difficulty, Disa∣greement, Loss and Disappointment follow∣ed, which lost him all these happy Steps a∣gain, serve only to convince the World that he had no Support, no Supply, no, not A SHOE to his Foot, or Bread to eat, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the Bounty and Generous Hand of He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
<HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, and this is the true De∣sign of these Sheets.</P>
<P>The marching to <HI>Madrid</HI> was of the ut∣most Consequence, and great Strife and Contention there was among the Generals, the Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> Lord <HI>Peterborow,</HI> and others; one why he did not come this Way, the other why he did not come that Way. But Count <HI>Gallas,</HI> the Emperor's Envoy, cleared up the Point, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the E—of <HI>P</HI>—having not supplied his Poor Majesty with Money, as he said he should have done, and he having no other Way in the World to get any, truly he could not stir at all. We have nothing to do with the Quarrel among them at that Time, or to enquire who were, or were not, to blame, the Case seems to be most exactly Stated and Discovered to the World in a late Book, Entituled, <Q>“”An Impartial Enquiry into the Management of the War in <HI>Spain,</HI> by the Ministry at Home, and into the Conduct of those Generals, to whose Care the same has been committed Abroad; collected from many Original Letters, and Councils of War, never pub∣lished before.</Q></P>
<P>Where all the Original Papers on either Side are at large recorded, and where, who∣ever thinks fit to enquire, may see some∣thing of a different Account from what most Men have entertained of that Affair. This is to our Purpose, and for this Reason we
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
mention the Matter, that Count <HI>Gallas</HI> in the said <HI>Memorial,</HI> to be seen also in the said Book, p▪ 153, acquaints Her Majesty of the true Reason why King <HI>Charles</HI> did not go faster on to <HI>Madrid,</HI> in these Words: <Q>“”His Catholick Majesty having from his first coming into that Country, till that Time, received no more from the said Lord than once 10000 Crowns to mount the Regiment of <HI>Zinzendorf,</HI> 15000 <HI>Pistoles</HI> at another Time for the Expence of the Siege of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and 5000 <HI>Dou∣bloons</HI> for the Fortifications of <HI>Gironne;</HI> and being obliged to provide himself all that was necessary in this unhappy Con∣juncture, saw himself reduced to so des∣perate a Condition, that Far from being able to do what was resolved on, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to march to <HI>Madrid</HI> by the Way of <HI>Valencia,</HI> he wanted even what was necessary for the daily supplying his own Table; and found himself so loaded with Debts, that he had Reason to apprehend some Disorders would ensue, if he should depart without paying them.</Q></P>
<P>This is a lively Representation of the Condition of this now so Glorious Monarch, who refuses to treat with the <HI>French</HI> at Her Majesties Invitation. But this is not all, let us go on, and see in what Humble Man∣ner he lays his Case at Her Majesties Feet, and implores Her Assistance; you have it in
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
the same <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Count <HI>Gallas,</HI> just at the close, in the following Words.</P>
<P><Q>“”And as your Majesty will perceive by this Account, that his Catholick Majesties Condition, for want of Means, is brought to this, that he is in Danger every Mo∣ment of seeing himself abandoned not on∣ly by his Troops, but even by the very Servants of his own Houshold, who for this Year and Half have not received the least Payment, which cannot happen with∣out rendering his Royal Person contempti∣ble to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and without his losing the Affection and Respect of those, who hitherto have been the best and fastest Friends, discouraging those whom he farther hoped to bring over to his Interest, and giving the Enemy all the Advantage they can desire.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”His Catholick Majesty therefore flatters himself, that after so many Favours granted him by your Majesty, you will not suffer him to sink under his Misfortunes, but will forthwith assist him with Money, to preserve him from all those Extremities, wherewith both his Person, and the Common Cause of all the Allies are threatned.</Q></P>
<P>We have now brought the Emperor to his first Journey to <HI>Madrid</HI> the latter End of the Year 1707 being a few Months before the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> his Dependance on Her Majesty in all his Distresses, his being
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
frequently relieved and supported, and indeed constantly, whenever he was in any Exigence, by Her Majesties Assistance, and his having no other Help; these are all so clear that we cannot believe his Majesty will forbear to acknowledge it at any Time.</P>
<P>We might trace him through all the Sub∣sequent Variety of his Fortunes, as the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> the Success at <HI>Balaguer,</HI> at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arragossa,</HI> and his Second March to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and his Retreat again after the Affair of <HI>Briheuga</HI> and might swell this little Tract to a great Volume with his own repeated Sollicitations to the Queen for Help, and Acknowledgments when re∣ceiv'd; but the last mention'd may suffice.</P>
<P>We must now salute him Emperor; what Influence Her Majesty and Her Allies have had in his Advancement, he has not yet indeed given us many Verbal Acknow∣ledgments of, at least that are made Pub∣lick; perhaps we may live to see them farther demonstrated in a little Time.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Expence Her Majesty and Her People have been at to support this Prince merit some Considera∣tion in the World, and may not very im∣properly be summ'd up to form this Ac∣count, especially since we are not so much stating an Account of Debtor and Creditor as to Money, but a Debt of Gratitude, and Ingratitude, in which the Money disburst, the Blood and Lives lost, in his Quarrel, and
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
Services done for his Person, stand on the one Side to his Debt in Account, and his Acknow∣ledgments are the Vouchers to prove that Account. The Return, the Behaviour, the Compliance with Things reasonable, &amp;c. are the Credit Part, or Discharge, of the Account, and we shall soon see how they Ballance.</P>
<P>Nor is it any Plea in Bar of this Demand, to say that we carried on the General Quar∣rel of the Confederacy, or that the War was not undertaken on his Account; for tho' that may be true in General, yet as to that Part of it carried on in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and with or about his Person, this cannot be denied to be carried on meerly to serve, oblige, promote, and support, him in parti∣cular, and none else.</P>
<P>How Fruitless the Success, how Ex∣pensive the Particular Service, and how Unhappy to <HI>Britain,</HI> and to all the Confe∣deracy, that War has been; how much more to our Advantage it had been, that the Expence on that Side had been employ'd either in <HI>America, Italy,</HI> or <HI>Flanders;</HI> these Things, tho' all of them very well worth enquiring into, on many other Accounts, yet, as they are not to be plac'd directly to his Account, we purposely omit; but as to the Account above let us enquire a little into the Particulars, and a long Account indeed we shall find it; enough to make any Prince in the World remember the Ob∣ligation
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
as long as he liv'd; an Account of Treasure and Blood, which no Nation but ours perhaps could have disburst for him, and which, to be sure, none but ours would have done in the Manner we have, without any Article or Condition of Repay∣ment or Satisfaction.</P>
<P>And this is a Clause deserves several Kinds of Observation. Well may King <HI>Charles,</HI> and the Emperor, his Father, call Her Majesty Mother; for the Treatment he has receiv'd from hence has gone beyond even the manner of Fathers in this Age; the King of <HI>France</HI> has not acted thus even with his own Flesh and Blood, for he has stopped the Treasure of his Grandson's Galleons more than once, and repaid himself out of them, for the vast Stores of Ammunition, and Arms, and the Payment of Troops, sent to his Assistance; nay, and if the Returns by their Merchants Ships from the <HI>South-Seas</HI> may be reckoned, some say he has been over-paid too: But <HI>England</HI> has acted upon another Foot, meer Care and Concern, truly Maternal, seeking no Reward, articling for no Return, taking no Pledge or Security for Repayment. Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty might have asked the Possession of such Places as should be taken by Her Arms; such as <HI>Barcelona, Gi∣braltar, Port Mahon,</HI> or even <HI>Naples, Mi∣lan,</HI> or the like, to be consign'd over to Her for Payment, when the King should
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e settled in his Dominions by Her Assistance. She might have Capitulated for <HI>Cadiz,</HI> or the <HI>Havana,</HI> or such other Places, as might have been very much the Advantage of Her People, to hold till the immense Sums should be repaid, which were An∣nually disburs'd for his Service. Nor were we so Rich, or so little in Debt to our Mortgaged Funds, that Ten Millions of Bullion in Specie, after the End of the War, would not have been both very useful, and very acceptable to us, to restore our Com∣merce, and recover our Nation, and help lighten the Burthen which these Things have fastened upon the Shoulders of our Posterity for so many Ages to come.</P>
<P>But all these Considerations have been of no Weight with us; the Assistance received from hence has been so generous, so free, as not to give the least Room to say we have imposed the least Conditions upon him; Her Majesty has acted with such Frank∣ness, all has been done with a Paternal Concern for him, neither Capitulating for, or expecting any Payment; all that can be said we ever Conditioned for was that Clause in the VIth <HI>Article</HI> of the Grand Al∣liance, wherein it is said, <HI>It shall be lawful for his Royal Majesty of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>and the Lords the</HI> States-General, <HI>by common Ad∣vice, and for the Benefit and Enlargement of the Navigation and Commerce of their Subjects, to seize by their Forces what Lands and Ci∣ties</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
<HI>they can, belonging to the</HI> Spanish <HI>Domi∣nions in the</HI> Indies; <HI>and whatsoever they so take shall be their own.</HI></P>
<P>In it appears we are to have nothing till we can get it for ourselves, and even that, it seems they never proposed we should do, especially if it be true which an Au∣thor lately Published, that when our Ex∣pedition was fitting out to the River of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and that it was suggested to the last Emperor that we were going to the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI> his Imperial Majesty should say, <Q>“”Sure the <HI>English</HI> could not be so Insolent.</Q> If this be true, (which however probable, yet we will not affirm,) it would but too clearly discover the Temper of the <HI>German</HI> Court to be far enough from the Gratitude which some People think them∣selves secure of.</P>
<P>But that this seeming Demand of Grati∣tude may not appear so unreasonable, it may not be improper to state a little, not what <HI>Britain</HI> may expect, but what <HI>Britain</HI> has done; let others judge what we ought, to expect, and what a Return Gratitude ought to make to a Nation, that has gone such a Length for them, and indeed the Sum in general is so great, that unless the Parti∣culars are a little set down, Posterity will think the Authors hereof spoke by Guess, and that it was impossible any Thing like it could be true.</P>
<P><PB N="$$" REF="42"/>
Wherefore the following Account is set down, that his Imperial Majesty, if he pleases, or any one for him, may Revise, and look back upon the few small Matters that have been done for him, and the tri∣fling Assistance which this Single Nation has given him towards establishing him on the <HI>Spanish</HI> Throne.</P>
<P>And first, for Troops sent to his Assi∣stance, the Expence whereof is such, that as it has been represented to the Parliament; and as it is to be demonstrated in the Au∣thor above recited, in his Book, <HI>The Impar∣tial Enquiry,</HI> &amp;c. every Foot Soldier cost the <HI>English</HI> Nation, before he was set on Shore in <HI>Spain,</HI> 26 <HI>l.</HI> 6 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d. per</HI> Head Sterling, an Expence which would have made a loud Noise in other Countries, and which perhaps few even in this Country will believe till they have read the Parti∣culars.</P>
<P>'Tis an Unhappy Reflection for this Poor Nation to think, that of above Sixty-five Thousand <HI>Englishmen</HI> in particular sent to <HI>Spain</HI> for the assisting this Grateful Prince, not many above the odd Five Thousand are remaining alive at this Time, and how few of them may be likely to see their own Nation again Time may shew us.</P>
<P>Besides, into this Number are not reckon∣ed the Seamen or Marines lost or dead on board the Fleet in this Service: Nor is there reckoned into this any of the Charge
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
of the Navy, which yearly amounts to above Two Millions, and most of which is employed in the Service of the King o <HI>Spain,</HI> even in so Servile a Manner, that our Men of War have been turn'd into meer Transports and Storeships for his Service; a Work we never let them be em∣ployed in at home: But the King's Necessi∣ties urging, so Zealous has Her Majesty and her Officers been to put forward his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesties Service, that they have stuck at nothing, nor made Difficulties, even of Things they are not allowed at other Times to do.</P>
<P>Here follows a Summary Account of the Forces at several Times shipp'd from hence, and paid, rais'd, or hired by Her Majesty for his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesties Service, and of the Money raised at several Times by Par∣liament for that Service.</P>

We could hardly expect these Heads to be received by those who have only enter∣tain'd Common Notions of these Things, and were not the Particulars to be proved and confirm'd by proper Vouchers, as well in the Publick Offices where the Accounts are kept respectively, as in the General Ab∣stracts laid before the Parliament, we should not have presumed to have inserted them here.</P>
<P>We are now to put a Stop to the long Account, tho' <HI>England</HI> is not yet happily at a Stop of the Expence, either of Men or Money.</P>
<P>One would think that his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty being now upon higher Terms with his Al∣lies, and being busie, telling the World what great Efforts he will make against the Com∣mon Enemy, what Powerful Armies he will bring into the Field, and the like, it would have been very Grateful, Honoura∣ble, and perhaps but Reasonable, that he would write One Letter more to Her Ma∣jesty, and after a due Acknowledgment of the great Things done for him, and the great Assistance She has given, as well to maintain him in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> as to influence his Election to the Emperor, to assure Her Majesty he will think now of some Means to repay, or secure, at the End of the War, the Repayment of those immense Sums She has laid out to assist him; and that to save the Expence of the Blood of Her Subjects
<PB N="4$" REF="49"/>
he will now pursue the War in <HI>Spain</HI> at his own Expence, and with his own Troops; and that if Her Majesty pleases to cause Her Fleet to attend for some Time the necessary Service, as aforesaid, His Majesty will also pay Her the Charge thereof, to be adjusted as they shall agree.</P>
<P>This would be something considerable; and from such a Thing as this in the Be∣ginning; we might hope for greater Things in the End; and above all, any One would think that at a Treaty of Peace, whenever that should be, none should be so forward as his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty to see Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty receive suitable Amends and Satisfaction for all these Migh∣ty Things done, and Assistance lent him.</P>
<P>But instead of this, let us look a little into his Conduct, and see what Tendency it has to such Things, and what Appearance of the very Temper of Gratitude there is in those Things he has done, or in what he proposes to himself to do: In the making these Observations we shall treat his Majesty with all that Courtesie and Decency which the Dignity of his Person and Character Com∣mands from Men of Honour, only preserv∣ing that Duty always owing to Truth, which we can by no Means dispence with.</P>
<P>As soon as the News came to these Parts of the Death of the late Emperor <HI>Joseph,</HI> the States-General, who received that News in Course some Time before us, met, and
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
in concert with Her Majesties Envoy at the <HI>Hague,</HI> took Vigorous and Timely Reso∣lutions for advancing and espousing the Interest of King <HI>Charles</HI> III. in the Ensuing Election of an Emperor. These Resoluti∣ons were immediately approved, seconded, and confirm'd, by Her Majesty, and Let∣ters, Envoys, Missions and Exhortations, were dispatch'd immediately by the said States-General and the <HI>British</HI> Court to all the Electors, Princes of the Empire, and others concerned, to press them to adhere to the Interest of King <HI>Charles,</HI> and to unite their Votes and their Forces also: For that End, the Troops appointed to form an Army on the <HI>Oder,</HI> for preserving the Peace of the Empire, commonly known by the Name of the Army of the Neutrality, were ordered to march from <HI>Silesia,</HI> and to draw down towards the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to support the Election; and such Effectual Measures were taken on this Occasion by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> that all the Steps concerted by the <HI>French</HI> to disturb the said Election by Force, as well as all the Intrigues of the Pope, who sent his Nephew <HI>Don Annibal Albani</HI> to <HI>Frankfort</HI> for that Purpose, could not in the least prove Effectual; nor could they prevail to obtain the Admission of the ex∣cluded Electors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Cologne,</HI> or to have their Vote receiv'd in the Electoral College.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51"/>
At the same Time, to assure and encou∣rage the Young Prince himself, a Letter was immediately dispatch'd to him by an Express, in the Name of the States-Gene∣neral, but Countersign'd, as approved by the <HI>English</HI> Embassador there; wherein are so great Expressions of Kindness, Concern, Affection, and Faithful adhering to his In∣terest, as it would be a severe Satyr on his Majesty to say or suggest he should not be in the highest Manner obliged by it; and which it must be impossible he ever can, with any Sence of Gratitude, forget; which Letter is of such Consequence in the present Argument, that we could by no Means omit to incert it, as that upon which his whole Affair at that Time depended; and in Consequence whereof, he was in Spight of <HI>French</HI> Opposition elected Emperor, even before he set his Foot on the Coast of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Here follows the Translation of the Let∣ter, written by the States-General of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> with the Conjunct Ap∣probation of the <HI>British</HI> Embassador at the <HI>Hague</HI> to King <HI>Charles</HI> III. dated 27th of <HI>April,</HI> 1711.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS with an extream Grief that we have been informed of the Death of his Im∣perial Majesty, and we would not defer One Moment to let your Majesty know how much
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
we are sensible of the great Loss you sustain by the Death of a Dear Brother, who was the Chief and Main Support of the Alliances; so dismal and unexpected an Accident cannot but cause some Alteration in the Minds of People, but we hope it will occasion no Change in, or Prejudice to, the Publick Affairs; and that the Prudence of the High Allies will hinder the Enemy from reaping any Advantage thereby; we believe that the best they can do in this Juncture is to continue strictly united, and prosecute the War with Firmness, without any Alteration in the Measures that have been con∣certed, and in particular in those Relative to the Affair of <HI>Spain;</HI> these being our Senti∣ments, we assure your Majesty we will conti∣nue to contribute our utmost Efforts for pro∣moting and supporting the Common Cause, and your Interest in particular; not doubting but your Majesty, according to your great Wisdom and Zeal for the Publick Good, will also do on your Part all that will be in your Power, as well for preserving and augmenting the good Correspondence and Ʋnion between the Allies, as for promoting the Common Cause, and in particular for supporting the Affairs in <HI>Spain,</HI> for which we believe the Efforts ought not to be in the least lessened, desiring your Majesty to take as much Care thereof as possible; we have ordered, and do now order again, our Vice-Admiral <HI>Picterson,</HI> who is at present in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> to concert with your Majesty, and the Commander of the Fleet of Her Maje∣sty
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and the Measures that shall be found necessary in the present Conjuncture, and do whatsoever shall be in common concert thought more useful; mean Time, as the Im∣perial Throne is vacant, we have written to the Princes, Electors of the Empire, to re∣present, that it cannot be more worthily filled than by your Majesty, whose Interest we have recommended to them in the Election, which is to be made according to the Constitutions of the Empire; we hope that this Evidence of our strict Adherences to your Majesty, and our Zeal for your Service, will not be disagreeable to you; and that when Occasion shall offer your Majesty will also have some Regard for the In∣terest of our Republick, and be perswaded that we shall earnestly look for Opportunity to show more and more to your Majesty the great Esteem we put on your Friendship and Affection; as to the rest, we pray God to preserve your Majesty in Good Health, and grant you what∣ever you wish.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Nor was this all, but the subsequent Proceeding, both of the States-General, and of the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> were every way agreeable, and conforming to the sincere Professions of Concern and Re∣spect, mentioned in this Letter.</P>
<P>It would be too long here to Recapitulate the several Steps farther taken in their Inte∣rest of this Prince, and which make up the whole History of his Election. How
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
the Confederates broke all the Measures of the Campaign in <HI>Flanders,</HI> parted with a great Detachment of the Army, and there∣by weakened the rest, so as not to be able to undertake the great Designs they had projected for that Summer, sacrificing the whole Expence of the Campaign to strengthen his Interest, and to make him appear so Formidable on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as that the <HI>French</HI> could offer no Disturbance to the Assembly at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> or in any Mea∣sure Awe or Influence the Election. How, in Pursuance of the aforesaid Letter, the Confederate Fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> were given up wholly to his Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Orders, as well to Transport and Convoy him from <HI>Catalonia</HI> to <HI>Italy,</HI> as to Carry and Convoy the Troops and Sup∣plies he should want to support his Affairs in <HI>Spain;</HI> and in short, how by these Things his Election was secured and effected, his Person Safely Landed, and himself put into that Posture of Power, and that Figure in the Affairs of Christendom, which we see this Day.</P>
<P>These Things, we say, it would be too tedious here to relate, wherefore we chuse to refer the Reader to the Accounts of those Things published in other Tracts, in all which the Share Her Majesty, and Her Allies, have constantly had in the Gran∣deur and Interest of this very Grate∣ful
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
Monarch, have been plainly set down.</P>
<P>Come we next to the Affair of the Trea∣ty of Peace, in which the first Beginnings of the Retribution, and subsequent Behavi∣our of his Majesty, to his aforesaid Friends, is the Thing we are to enquire into.</P>
<P>The Proposals of <HI>France,</HI> of which so much Noise has been made, were in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> or thereabouts, made to Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty by the <HI>French</HI> King, and Sign'd by his Agent here, Mon∣sieur <HI>Mesnager;</HI> a Thing so Publick, no far∣ther Account needs to be given of it here; nor that these Proposals were immediately communicated to the Ministers of all the Allies by the Queen's Order, that they might be sent to their respective Prin∣cipals, and their Answers thereupon be ob∣tain'd.</P>
<P>When the first News of this Matter came to the Knowledge of King <HI>Charles,</HI> a little before his Election, we find him at his Landing near <HI>Genoa,</HI> when he came from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> expressing himself warmly to Her Majesties Ambassador, Mr. <HI>Chetwynd,</HI> when he waited on him on Board the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Fleet, to Compliment him upon his Arrival in <HI>Italy,</HI> in this Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="56"/>
<Q>“”That if the Queen proceeded in this Manner, he should be obliged to take Care of himself, and that the other Allies would do the same after his Example.</Q> <HI>Vide</HI> Observations on the <HI>Hannover</HI> Memorial. P. 16.</P>
<P>This is the first Instance from whence we derive the Title of our Book, and which we think gives us some Idea of what we call IMPERIAL GRATITUDE. This Language sounds a little harsh to the very Pen, after it has been writing so ma∣ny fine, soft, and smooth Things, as have hitherto supplied these Pages; this is some∣thing different from the Expressions of, <HI>Ever bound to remember; Eternal Gratitude; overcome with Her Majesties Goodness;</HI> and the like; so that one would think they could hardly proceed from the same Mouth.</P>
<P>But we are not to stop here, let us go on. The Proposals of <HI>France,</HI> vulgarly and er∣roneously call'd Preliminaries, coming to his Majesties Hands, from his Ambassador Count <HI>Gallas;</HI> and the Proposals of a Treaty at <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> being made, besides that his Majesty thought not fit to expostulate it with the Queen immediately, let us see what Treatment the Queen, and the whole <HI>British</HI> Nation, meets with from him, in his Letter to the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
Princes of the Empire, and in his Letter to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> on the Subject of the said Treaty and Preliminaries; and tho' these Letters are long, we cannot content ourselves to omit them, because of the dif∣ferent Stile from what we have read and quoted before; and because, as we pro∣mised in the Beginning of this Work, we shall all along chuse rather to quote you his Majesties own Words, than to give you the Comments and Explanations thereon, which however just, may be more liable to Exception.</P>
<P>First then, we give you his Imperial Ma∣jesties Letter Circular, directed more imme∣diately to the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> but also sent to all the Electors and Princes of the Em∣pire, concern'd in furnishing their Quota's to the War, as follows.</P>
<P>THAT his Majesty did not question but that his Electoral Highness had been in∣formed of the Preliminaries of Peace proposed in <HI>England,</HI> on the Part of <HI>France,</HI> a Copy of which is here subjoined, and was no less con∣cerned than his Majesty, that at a Time when God had so largely bestowed his Blessing on the Arms of the Allies, and when there was just Grounds to hope to reduce the Enemy within just Bounds, for the securing the Tran∣quility of <HI>Europe,</HI> that Crown should offer such Proposals, which had not only been hear∣kened to at <HI>London,</HI> but had also been com∣municated
<PB N="$$" REF="58"/>
in Form the <HI>9</HI>th of <HI>October</HI> to Count <HI>Gallas,</HI> Minister of his Majesty, by a Secretary of State, and proposed in <HI>Holland</HI> as acceptable, with earnest Instances of entring into a Negotiation thereupon: That hitherto his Majesty had been unwilling to look upon this Precipitation as a departing from the Aim and Intention of the Grand Alliance, seeing the Obligation the Allies are under, not to enter into any Negotiations of a separate Peace, is sufficiently known by all the World, according to the Treaty of Alliance; and there∣fore was rather enclined to believe, that the, had too easily given Credit to the captious Pro∣posals of the Enemy, though they were not so well varnished as others have been; for every one perceived at first Sight that hardly any one Thing in them was clearly expressed, and that the Enemies Design was to gain Time by a long Negotiation, as well for recovering themselves, as for dividing the Allies, which they have endeavoured to do a long Time since; that it was not difficult to foresee the Conse∣quences, if Men would only consider with At∣tention, that since, with so great Effusion of Blood, and unconceivable Expence, the united Forces of the Allies have not yet been able to obtain the Principal End of the War, that is, the common Security and Tranquility of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> what more can be expected from a sepa∣rate Peace, or its Fxecution, than what has happened, in Respect to the Solemn Oaths of the Renunciation at the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> and other En∣gagements,
<PB N="$$" REF="59"/>
which were to be perpetual, and especially when the <HI>French</HI> shall be Masters of the Forces of <HI>Spain, Indies,</HI> and all the Commerce.</P>
<P>As for us, <HI>(continues the Emperor,)</HI> we hope the contrary, and are entirely perswaded that you will be of the same Opinion, insomuch, that you will not only oppose those Designs that are pernicious to the Common Cause, accord∣ing to your Renowned Zeal for your Country, but also that you will powerfully use your great Credit with the Electors and States of the Empire, and also with the States-General of the <HI>United Netherlands,</HI> and other Allies, as we affectionately desire of you, by the near Tie of Blood there is between us, that you may all persevere together in the Engagements of the Alliance, and in the necessary Ʋnion, for obtaining an Advantagious and Solid Peace, and that in <HI>England</HI> they may, following this laudable Example, desist from any Thoughts that are contrary, and entertain such as are conformable thereto.</P>
<P>In the mean Time we have taken an irre∣vocable Resolution to undergo whatever may come of it, and to exert all our Efforts for the Good of the Common Cause, exposing even our own Person, rather than consent to the sending of any one in our Name, to assist in a Partial Negotiation, entirely ruinous to our Dear Country, and the Liberty of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and which we could not answer to our Archdu∣cal House.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="60"/>
We have thought fit to represent to you these Things without Delay, as to an Elector, and an Ally so particularly Interested in this War, to the End you may assist us with your Council and Endeavours, to the strengthning the Grand Alliance, for which we, and our Archducal House, will preserve an Eternal Gratitude, &amp;c.</P>
<P>At the same Time, or near it, his Maje∣sty thought fit to Write to the States-Gene∣ral the following Letter; as to the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> whether it was because the Imperial Envoy, and Resident, Count <HI>Gal∣las,</HI> had affronted the Queen, and been re∣fused here, or for what other Reason, we do not determine; his Imperial Majesty never took any Notice to Her, or of Her, never so much as returned the Acknow∣ledgments, formerly so frequent with him, as to the Assistance received in his Election, or took any Notice of the Preliminaries at all, at least that we have heard of, but in his Letter to the States-General he writes thus.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>High and Mighty Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY Letters that are just come to us from the <HI>Hague</HI> we have received Advice, that the Ambassador of <HI>England</HI> is returned into your Provinces, and has brought with him some New Preliminary Articles of Peace, proposed by the King of <HI>France,</HI> drawn up
<PB N="$$" REF="61"/>
with great Artifice, and altogether such as must be expected from an Enemy, for they con∣tain nothing but what is dubious and equivo∣cal; and if one takes the Pains to examine thoroughly the Sence they impart, instead of the indefinite Terms which appear at the first View, one will clearly find therein the Loss which can never be sufficiently deplored of, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy; for which only, and for preserving it in our Imperial Family, and at the same Time for maintaining the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> this War was underta∣ken; Ten Years have been spent in Fight∣ing, and so much Blood spilt, so that nothing more dismal, and more fatal, could happen in the World.</P>
<P>For who is not sensible, that if this great Augmentation of Power be left in Addition to that of the Enemy, all those in general who are Confederated in this War, and each of them in Particular, can expect nothing but a more shameful Slavery, from which hitherto we have been able to save ourselves; that he thereby renders himself Master of our Liberties, and that he is endeavouring with insupportable Arrogance to impose on us in his Turn the Laws he was of late obliged to receive? Fur∣thermore, should the War continue in such a Manner, that the Enemy, already weakned by his ill Successes, should come at last to be a Victor, yet it would be still unpardonable to consent to such unjust Preliminaries.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62"/>
But at present, when he cannot look in the Face of the Armies of the Allies, when he is not secure anywhere, neither in the Field, nor in his fortified Towns; when having lost part of his Forces, and his Places, he is a∣fraid that very suddenly the War will be carried into the Heart of his Kingdom; can one help being justly irritated against those who have been so often deceived by the Illusion of the <HI>French,</HI> will venture to try once more the good Faith, which they always promise, but never keep, give Assistance to those Enemies, abandon their Allies, renounce their Alliances, and in a Word, make use of their own Victories, to prepare a Yoke for their own Posterity?</P>
<P>Certainly, if it were not visible to the whole World, that the King of <HI>France,</HI> by proposing these Preliminaries, designs, according to his Custom, under pretext of an Assembly for treating of Peace, to divide the Allies, and create a Misunderstanding among them by his usual Artifices, which have always hitherto sup∣plied him with Means to illude what has been agreed, at least a sad Remembrance of what is past ought to be sufficient for rendering the Thing more than Evident, and to have set it continually before our Eyes; this Reason has chiefly induced us to think that there is no other Solid Foundation upon which the Peace to be made can be established, then to fix the Incon∣stancy of <HI>France</HI> by such Preliminary Arti∣cles, that She may no longer surprize others, and extricate Herself by an unjust Treaty of
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
Peace, as She has done on every Occasion hi∣therto.</P>
<P>We do not at all doubt that you will likewise persist in these Sentiments, and join your De∣liberations with ours, to seek Means to induce the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and, if possible, to engage Her to reject those Propositions, and to continue the War or else, if a Negotiation with the Enemy must be entered upon, that it may be on Condition, that the proceeding Pre∣liminaries proposed most of them by the Ene∣my himself, may remain fix'd, and without Alteration; and so that She will not trust the Immortal Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he has acquired, and the certain Welfare of Her People, to the Infidelity of the Promises of the <HI>French,</HI> of what Kind soever they may be.</P>
<P>'Tis for these Reasons that we earnestly in∣treat, and most effectionately exhort you, that, according to your usual Generosity, you will take with us the Resolution to support that Cause, which is now in so great Danger, and not suffer the deceitful Intrigues of <HI>France</HI> to have a successful Issue through our Remissness, and turn our Triumphs to our Shame and Dishonour.</P>
<P>As for us, whatever Consequences may en∣sue from this Affair, we utterly reject these Preliminaries, as well for the present as for the future; and we will not by any Means im∣power our Ambassadors to assist at the Confe∣rences which are proposed for treating upon them, but rather we will exort all our Efforts,
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
as we are actually doing, that our Armies, particularly those in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> may be re∣established and reinforced, that all the World may be convinced that it is in no wise any Fault of ours that the War is not carried on to a Happy Issue; and that a Peace, Firm, Lasting, and Advantageous, to all the Allies is not restored to the whole Ʋniverse. For the rest we are, &amp;c.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Thus far his Imperial Majesties own Words; how oddly they sound, how harsh, how unlike his Letters from <HI>Lisbon</HI> and from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> let the Reader determine; we are loth to Comment upon them, lest in doing Justice to the Queen we should be obliged to handle his Majesty too se∣verely.</P>
<P>We must conclude these Remarks with descending to a brief History of Fact, as it now relates to the Peace, and the Con∣duct of this Grateful Person to Her Majesty, in the Negotiations that are now on Foot: Pursuant to the irrevocable Determination of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> we find him refusing, even before he is ask'd, the First Question, or Proposal, his Great Maternal Benefac∣tress, the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> was like to make to him; and after the Proposal was made to him from the Queen, by an especial Messenger, which carried Her Ma∣jesties
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
Letter, written to all the Allies, his Imperial Majesty's Answer, for he was now Elected Emperor, contain'd a posi∣tive Denial to come to any Treaty, or to send any Plenipotentiaries to the Congress at <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI> The Justice and Equity of the Denial turns upon Two or Three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Reason and Justice of Her Ma∣jesties Request.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Obligation upon his Imperial Majesty, to the Person of the Queen, and to the <HI>British</HI> Court proposing.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Weight of the Reasons alledged against it.</P>
<P>The first of these, <HI>(viz.) the Reason and Justice of Her Majesties Proposal,</HI> is best to be seen by the Proposal itself, and that is exprest in the said Circular Letter, which was sent, as by its Title appears, to all the Princes concern'd in the Grand Alliance, of whom his Imperial Majesty was not only one, but the Chief; the Letter is as fol∣lows.</P>
<P>THE most Christian King having ac∣quainted us with his Desire to see the Quiet and Tranquility of <HI>Furope</HI> restored, by a Safe and Honourable Peace for us, and all our High Allies, and having made some Offers to
<PB N="$$" REF="66"/>
dispose us to the opening of Conferences for that Purpose, (which Offers have been communi∣cated to all the said Allies,) and the States-Ge∣neral having thereupon declared, that they are inclined, and ready to enter into a Negotiation for a Good and General Peace, and to join with us, for inviting the Powers engaged with us in the present War, to send their Ministers and Plenipotentiaries to the Congress; and the Place and Time of which having been concerted with the Minister of the said States-General, we have thought it necessary to let you know, without any Loss of Time, that we have agreed to affix the Opening of the said Congress to the <HI>12</HI>th of <HI>January</HI> next, <HI>N. S.</HI> in the Town of <HI>Utrecht;</HI> as we have no other View than to put an End to this War by a Solid Peace, and in which every one of the Allies may find a reasonable Satisfaction, we doubt not but you will be equally disposed to contribute to the Advancement of so Pious and Benefi∣cial a Work. Wherefore we desire you to send forthwith the Ministers whom you shall appoint for that Purpose, that by the Time a∣bove specified they may appear in the said Town of <HI>Utrecht.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, we think it convenient to acquaint you, that we have resolved, in con∣cert with the States-General, to send our Mi∣nisters to the Congress only in the Quality of Plenipotentiaries, and that they shall not take upon them the Character of Ambassadors, till the Day of the Signing of the Peace, in or∣der
<PB N="$$" REF="67"/>
to avoid, as much as possible, the Diffi¦culties of the <HI>Ceremoniale</HI> and the Delay▪ which might be occasioned thereby.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this Letter, his Impe∣rial Majesty refused peremptorily to send any Ambassadors or Plenipotentiaries to <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI> This we call denying to the Queen the first Request, or Proposal, which Her Majesty made to him, notwithstanding the Kindness and Concern shew'd to him by Her Majesty in other, and on former, Oc∣casions.</P>
<P>As to the Second Head, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Obli∣gation upon his Imperial Majesty to the Person of the Queen, it may relate to the Queen Two Ways; first, the Obligation of Gratitude for former Kindness shewn him, and the Obligation of Justice to the Reasonableness of Her Majesties Proposal, which only signified a Desire in the Queen to have his Imperial Majesty, and all the rest of Her Allies, receive entire Satisfaction in the design'd Treaty; all Her View there∣in being, as She exprest there, to make a Firm and Solid Peace, &amp;c. and that they should meet there to treat thereof, and see if it was possible for them to agree about it.</P>
<P>Now, though the Obligations we speak of upon his Imperial Majesty might not be reasonably expected to be sufficient to influ∣ence him in the Matters of the Peace itself,
<PB N="$$" REF="68"/>
yet sure, to the Ceremony of a Treaty, something might be argued; and it seem'd to many, a Token of small Respect to Her Majesty, that the Emperor should stand out from a Meeting only, when the first Proposal of that Meeting came from a Prince, which he had so good Reason to think had his particular Interest at Heart; and a Prince, who had given him such convincing Proofs of it, by such a Series of Benefaction, as is the Subject of the first Part of this Treatise.</P>
<P>How surprizing then must it be to find, instead of this, such Expressions relating to the <HI>British</HI> Court, such Arguments, im∣plying a Diffidence in, and Resolution to oppose all the Measures taken for a Peace, and particular, a Determination to refuse so much as to oblige the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the trifling Request, of coming together to treat.</P>
<P>Had a Treaty been begun, and any Proposals entred upon there, been contra∣ry to the Interest, Inclination, or other Views of his Imperial Majesty, and he had stood out from a Compliance, he might then indeed have had a Pretence, he had his Reasons, his Interest, and his other Views, to have offered as Reasons, and whether they had been sufficient, or no, the Liberty every one had to determine of that might have left it the Opinion of the World: But the Pretence of, and Right to
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
make Objections, had been Just and Re∣sonable; but to refuse to treat, to refuse so much as to send Plenipotentiaries, or Ambassadors, to hear what should be of∣fered, and to judge whether it was suffici∣cient, or a ground of Satisfaction, yea, or no, this favour'd of too much Disre∣gard to the Proposer, to come from any Prince who had own'd himself under such Engagements and Obligations to the said Proposer, as his Imperial Majesty had done to the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and this the rather, because it was rejecting, not a Ma∣terial Thing, but a Circumstance, a Point of Ceremony, a Thing frequently, and on many occasions, left by one Prince to ano∣ther; and therefore the refusing this to the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> could but signifie some Diffidence, Distrust and Uneasiness in the Refuser of, and at the Proposer; and what Reasons there can be for that in his Majesty, as it respects the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> let any one that has read the former Sheets of this Tract determine; indeed we cannot but think it seems at least to us very disrespectful; as to the Word ungrate∣ful, we are loth to call it by so harsh a Name; perhaps it may be the Manner by which those <HI>Northern</HI> Nations of the World exprest their Gratitude for infinite Obliga∣tions, and for Kindnesses too great for them, by any other Method to requite; and this may the better suit the Terms of our Title,
<PB REF="70"/>
and may be left on Record, as a true Test of what is called <HI>Imperial Gratitude.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the Third Head, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Weight of the Reasons alledged in Be∣half of his Imperial Majesty for his refusing to treat, and these may merit some Consi∣deration.</P>
<P><HI>The first</HI> we meet with in all the foregoing Letters, is that he cannot consent to treat on the Foot of the said Seven Preliminaries; many that strove hard to defend his Impe∣rial Majesty in his standing out, and refusing to come to treat, gave this as a Reason, that he did by no means pretend to object against a Treaty in General, but against a Treaty upon the Foot of those Preliminaries, as Things altogether insufficient, and uncapa∣ble of founding a Safe and Honourable Peace, and as Things which at their very first View seem'd to take it for granted, or at least openly suggest, the giving up the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy to the Enemy. That if a Treaty were set on Foot on the Preliminaries for∣merly adjusted, and upon Conditions suitable to his Imperial Majesties Pretensions, and to that Right he had to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, which was owned by all the Confederates, that then he was ready, in Concert with his Allies, &amp;c. but he could not enter upon such a Treaty as he understood this to be; what Measures Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty took to open his Eyes in this Respect, and to sa∣tisfie him that She did not understand the
<PB N="$$" REF="71"/>
Proposals in such a Manner; that she desired that his Imperial Majesty should, as well as all Her other Allies, receive full Satisfaction in the Treaty, and the like; and how little such a Declaration was of Effect, to alter his Majesties said Resolutions, or to encou∣rage him to have Confidence in Her said Majesty, who had formerly been so zealous for his Interest, and in whom he had ex∣pressed before such entire Confidence, we need not enquire.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next Reason we meet with in his Majesties Representations against this Trea∣ty was the Ambiguity of the Expressions, which being of <HI>double Entendre,</HI> doubtful Construction, and a various Signification, should be Construed in the Execution of them, to the Advantage of the Enemy, and tended manifestly to amuse and divide the Confederates; it may be confessed, that had these Proposals been the only Foundation, and that they were, as before, supposed to be the Heads, to which the Plenipotentiaries were limited in their Treaty, there had been more to be said on this Head, but otherwise it seem'd to argue strongly, that a fair and open Treaty of a Peace was the only Way for all the Confederates to determine the direct Sense of every Article, to oblige <HI>France</HI> to explain herself upon any Point that might seem ambiguous, and to remove all possible Constructions which might be put upon them, to the Prejudice of any
<PB N="$$" REF="72"/>
Part of the Allies; and had his Majesty spo∣ken or thought in this Case, with the same Sentiments that he had appeared to speak and think with before, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of an entire Confidence in, and Dependance upon, Her Majesty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> from whom he had received such frequent and undoubted Evidences of a true and of a deep Con∣cern for him, and for his Interest, we might rather have expected some Expressi∣ons like these; <HI>Having an entire Confidence in Your Majesties good Affection to us, and to our Interest, which You have in so many Occa∣sions, with so generous a Concern, and so much Goodness, so many Ways expressed; and that You will not suffer any Thing to be done, agreed to, or granted, to the Prejudice of our Right, and the Loss or Dammage of our Interest, at the said Treaty,</HI> &amp;c. This, or something like this, had been all of a Piece with the rest; and the Spirit and Vigour of a Mind obliged in the highest Manner, and sensible of the greatest Favours, had appeared here, as it did in the Letters of the same Prince, formerly quoted: But his Majesty was not now Besieged within the Walls of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> he was now Exalted to the Imperial Dig∣nity; he was not now surrounded by a <HI>French</HI> Army, and a Breach of Fifty Paces Wide made in the Fortifications he had to defend; he is now surrounded with the Ac∣clamations of the <HI>Germans,</HI> attended by in∣numerable Crowds, and throng'd with a
<PB REF="73"/>
Concourse of Princes, instead of a Formi∣dable Fleet blocking him up by Sea, and his Rival ready to seize him, and carry him in Triumph to <HI>Madrid;</HI> he is entring in Triumph the Imperial Cities of <HI>Germany;</HI> instead of the roaring of the Cannon from the Batteries in the Enemies Approaches, he hears the thundring of Cannon from the Ramparts of the Towns he passes through; and instead of the Cries of the Assailants at∣tempting to Storm the only City, he hears the Shouts of long Live the Emperor, <HI>Vive il Rey d' Espaign,</HI> and the like; and if these Things have altered his Stile a little, and caused him to forget the Expressions which formerly came with so much Freedom from him in his Distress, we cannot so much Wonder, since nothing is so natural to the Constitution of Man as to resent Injury, and forget Favours.</P>
<P N="3">3. We might in all his Representations abovesaid, observe another Reason why his Imperial Majesty has thus stifly, we had almost said obstinately, rejected a Treaty; and this is the clear View he seems to have, that in such Treaty he may be required by his Allies to part with some Branches of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, either for the Satisfaction of his Allies, for the immense Expences, Losses, and Dammages of the War, or for the more easie inducing the Enemy, by a quiet De∣mission to put him in Possession of the rest, where that we may do Justice to his Impe∣rial
<PB N="$$" REF="74"/>
Majesty; it seems that this Reason has not so little Weight in it as some may think it has; particularly, that his Imperial Ma∣jesty may think he is now vested with new Powers, and placed in a Station able to make a more powerful Figure in the Alli∣ance than he has hitherto done; that the Efforts he shall now make are so considerable as ought to encourage the Allies to push on farther, without Regard to the particular Interests that may otherwise move them. We are loth to say that his Imperial Maje∣sty too soon overlooks the exhausted Cir∣cumstances of most of <HI>Europe,</HI> and particu∣larly some Nations, especially weakened and exhausted by their Zeal for his imme∣diate Assistance, and that they are obliged to have no regard to any Thing but the fair Opportunity that now offers to re-esta∣blish him in the Possession of New King∣doms, not looking at all into their own. We are loth to look back into the Circum∣stances of the War, and give for Reasons, that the Weight of the War lying principal∣ly upon the Confederates, and the Gain of any Conquests, or Acquistion, falling in General into the Hands of the Emperor; and that the Gain to the Emperor, by carry∣ing on the War, is beyond all Comparison, so much greater than the Expence of his Part, that therefore it is not to be expected that such Forwardness for a Peace should appear on his Side, as those States and
<PB N="$$" REF="75"/>
Princes might show who have borne the Weight of that War, and have their Eyes fix'd only on the Native and Settled Advan∣tages attending a Safe and Honourable Peace.</P>
<P>But come we therefore a little to enquire wherein these Reasons seem not insufficient, only but a little unkind, with Respect to the Nations who have with so much Can∣dour and Generosity engaged to assist and carry on his Imperial Majesty, and to whose Influence he owes so much, the Establish∣ment of his Affairs in their present Happy and Flourishing Posture.</P>
<P>Her Majesty had not given the least Oc∣casion for his Imperial Majesty to think She would make a Separate or Disadvantageous Treaty; or that the Loss of <HI>Spain</HI> to his <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Arch-Ducal</HI> House would be the necessary Consequence of such a Treaty; but on the contrary, as well by Her private Assurances to all Her Allies, as in Her Speech to the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, Her Majesty had given all possible Assuran∣ces that She was resolved at the said Treaty to obtain full Satisfaction to all Her Allies; and that She had their Interest at Heart, that She would enter into such Engagements with the Allies as should effectually secure and obtain such Satisfaction; and that She was resolved, if such Satisfaction could not be obtained, to carry on the War with the utmost Vigour. This was so clear a Decla∣ration of the sincere Intentions of Her Maje∣sty
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
in the View of a Peace, that immediate∣ly gave Satisfaction, not only to Her own Subjects at Home, but to all the rest of the Allies Abroad; and upon which imme∣diately the Plenipotentiaries of the other Allies were nominated, and began to move towards the Place of the Treaty, and made ready for the Congress.</P>
<P>Farther than this, Her Majesty failed not to explain Herself upon the Affair of the Pro∣posals of <HI>France,</HI> That they were understood only as Proposals, That it was Her Intention nevertheless that all the Allies should enter into, as well their General as their parti∣cular Demands, at the Treaty, and should Treat upon the Subject of their proper In∣terests and Satisfaction, as if no such Propo∣sals or Preliminaries had been made.</P>
<P>It were too much to enter into all the particular Steps taken by Her Majesty in this Affair, to satisfie, if possible, all the reasonable just Scruples of his Imperial Ma∣jesty; and yet, after all, if we may be∣lieve the Foreign Accounts, we find him still diffident; that he has not yet agreed to send his Plenipotentiaries; and, as those Accounts say, that he expects a Declaration in Writing from Her Majesty, that those Articles shall not be treated on as Prelimi∣naries, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If this be so, tho', as we said before, we shall not charge his Imperial Majesty with Unreasonable Jealousies, Groundless Dis∣trusts, and acting with less Regard to the
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
Honour and Dignity of Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Ma∣jesty, than he has just Occasion given him to do; yet we cannot but represent these diffe∣rent Schemes to the View of every Impartial Reader, and laying one by the other, de∣sire and recommend it to them, to compare them together, and see if it can be imagin'd they can come from the same Hand; or that if they do, whether they are not very Sin∣gular in several Things, and may not be very properly stated to the World, and put into such Form, as the like may always be known by the Title given to this Book, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Imperial Ingratitude.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT has been laid down here needs very little Comment, you have a Scetch of the Conduct of a Confede∣rate of the first Magnitude in his various Changes and Circumstances, and you have it laid down with no Deviation from Fact; the Case, as it lyes before you now, is all History, and the Reader is led to such un∣questioned Vouchers, as it may be suggest∣ed will admit no Debate, <HI>Ex Ore Tuo</HI> is the Word; and truly, in a Case of such Con∣cern as this, it seems that no less Evidence ought to be admitted, for many Reasons, the Subject being of the highest Consequence, and the Person spoken of Supream in Dig∣nity, the first Potentate in <HI>Christendom.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now, by Way of Conclusion, to look a little from the Person we have
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
been speaking of, and to consider our own Circumstances, to look before us, and en∣quire what Measures we ought to take, how the <HI>British</HI> Court stands obliged to act, and how to behave in the Affair of the Treaty, with Respect to a Prince that has acted by our Government, as before related.</P>
<P>It is a Thing Notorious, if we look back to consider this Prince as King of <HI>Spain,</HI> only that he is under Obligations to us, but we are under none to him; if we look back on him as Emperor, then he stands on the Step from which the late Emperor, and his other Ancestors, went off; in which Capa∣city we may do no unnecessary Duty to ask on which Side lyes the Obligation.</P>
<P>In order to this Enquiry, it is not impro∣per to propose to those who are so full of the Emperor's Merit as a Confederate, that they would let us see with what a kind of Concern, for the general Interest of the Al∣lies, the Emperors have carried on the War, how they have supplied their Quota's, how filled their Military Chest, and their Maga∣zines, and in what Posture they have been as to the War; let them give us a Descripti∣on of the Imperial Conduct, and state it with the Obligation which lay on that Court as a Confederate, and what the Al∣lies ought to have expected from them. Let them enquire, and set down for the Peru∣sal of the World, what Share of Diversion to the Enemies Troops the Emperor has ta∣ken upon him; let the Battles, the Sieges,
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
the Armies on the <HI>Ʋpper Rhine,</HI> be reckoned up▪ and above all, let them set down the Times of the Year when those Armies gene∣rally came into the Field, and when they left it, how far they march'd, how long they kept Garrison in their Lines, and how well also they defended them when attack'd also by the <HI>French,</HI> with Forces not Superior to them.</P>
<P>It is much talked here now of what Great Forces the Emperor is preparing to bring in∣to the Field, and those who give reasonable Accounts of them, (as for the extravagant Ac∣counts of others they are worth no Notice in this Place,) make them 90000 Men, but these People forget to look back upon the Quota's, which in Consequence of the Grand Alliance it was agreed the Imperial Court was to bring into the Field, and there it will appear that 91750 Men was the Compliment his Imperial Majesty was obliged to furnish over and above the Troops of the Empire: Now if ever one half of these were brought into the Field, or appeared in Action, if ever these Capitulations were perform'd, let these Gen∣tlemen set down the Names of the Regiments, and where, and when, they serv'd; if they had been in the Field perhaps the Work had not been left to do at this Time of Day; and if they have not been produced, then it re∣mains to ask, whether it is reasonable that we should carry on the War to oblige, and in dependance upon, the Promises o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> SUCH an Ally?</P>
