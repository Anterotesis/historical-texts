<HEAD>TO
The RIGHT HONOURABLE,
HENRY DUNDAS,
of MELVILLE,
ADVOCATE-GENERAL for Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>THough Law has been my
chief employment in a long
and laborious life, I can how∣ever
address my young friend,
without even a blush, requesting
his patronage to this little work.
As in some instances it pretends
to dissent from established practice,
I know few men, young or old,
who have your candour to make
truth welcome against their own
prepossessions; still fewer who
have your talents to make it tri∣umph
over the prepossessions of o∣thers.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NO science affords more opportunity
for exerting the reasoning faculty,
than that of law; and yet, in no other
science is authority so prevalent. What
are our law-books but a mass of naked
propositions, drawn chiefly from the de∣cisions
of our supreme courts, rarely con∣nected
either with premises or consequen∣ces?
Our supreme civil court consists of
many members: can uniformity be ex∣pected
from a fluctuating body, as if all
men were actuated with the same spirit?
Yet in none of our law-books is there the
slightest attempt to separate the chaff from
the wheat. Lord Stair, our capital writer
on law, was an eminent philosopher; but
as he was not educated to the profession
of law, his Institutes consist chiefly of
decisions of the court of session; which
with him are all of equal authority,
though not always concordant: nor are
the works of our later writers much more
systematic. Such a mode of writing is
infectious: Our law-students, trained to
rely upon authority, seldom think of que∣stioning
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>
what they read: they husband
their reasoning faculty, as if it would
rust by exercise.</P>
<P>Nor is the exercise of reasoning promo∣ted
in any degree by public professors.
Our law is grafted on that of old Rome;
which accordingly is properly made the
first stage in law-education. The Roman
law is illustrious for its equitable rules,
affording great scope for acute reason∣ing;
and yet that law is not taught by
any professor, foreign or domestic, with
any view to improve the reasoning facul∣ty.
Its rules of equity ought to be se∣dulously
illustrated, as the corner-stone of
law. Instead of which, nothing is pre∣sented
to the young gentlemen but naked
facts. Nor are even those facts selected
that are more immediately connected with
modern law: all are stated indiscrimi∣nately.
What use, for example, to our
students, is the chapter, <HI>De lege fusia ca∣nidia
tollenda,</HI> for the chapter, <HI>De excusa∣tionibus
tutorum et curatorum,</HI> for the intri∣cate
rules of succession, for the still more
intricate rules that concern pactions, or
for a thousand other particulars that have
<PB N="ix" REF="6"/>
no relation to any modern law, none at
least to the law of Scotland. They load
the weak mind with a heap of uninterest∣ing
facts, without giving any exercise to
the judgement. Is it surprising, that the
Roman law, so taught, is held to be a
dry and fatiguing study<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I should merit censure equal to what I do liberally bestow on others, did I did not except Mr John Millar, Professor of Roman law in the college of Glasgow.</NOTE>? Is there no
cause to fear, that many of our law-stu∣dents,
contracting an aversion to study in
general, will sink into idleness, and prove
no less useless to themselves than to their
country? Are there no traces to be dis∣covered
of this malady? Many, many.</P>
<P>A Scotch professor of Roman law ought
to be well acquainted with the law of his
own country, so as in every lecture to
point where our law differs from that of
old Rome. A course of such lectures,
carried on with spirit and discernment,
would draw great attention: The student
whose immediate object was the Roman
law, would be surprised to find the ad∣vance
he had made in that of his own
<PB N="x" REF="7"/>
country: how much more easy, and even
pleasant, would his future progress be?
Instead of such lectures, he is dismissed
by his professor without a single idea, but
what is strictly Roman; and such ideas
are ignorantly applied by him to the law
of his own country, as chance or conceit
directs. Lamentable must this education
be, when it can be traced in the writings
even of our most celebrated authors. Will
I be forgiven to draw out of my budget
one instance? Sir George Mackenzie, in
his Institutions of the law of Scotland,
follows literally the Roman division of
contracts, into verbal, real, consensual,
and scriptural. Would one require better
authority? And yet there is not the slight∣est
foundation in our law for such a divi∣sion.</P>
<P>In other sciences reason begins to make
a figure: Why should it be excluded
from the science of law? The authority
of men of eminence has deservedly great
weight; for nature gives it weight. But
authority ought to be subservient to rea∣son;
which the God of nature has be∣stowed
on man, as his chief guide in
<PB N="xi" REF="8"/>
thinking as well as in acting. The great
Des Cartes commenced his philosophical
inquiries with doubting of every thing: he
endeavoured not to believe even his own
existence, without an argument. This
indeed was carrying scepticism to an ex∣travagance:
it was however erring on the
safer side; for excess in scepticism is less
unmanly, than excess in deforence to au∣thority:
reason may profit by the former;
it is stifled by the latter. I have ventu∣red
to carry the sceptical spirit into the
present work, wishing, hoping, to roufe
that spirit in others. I have perhaps in∣dulged
it too much. But by whom will
my erroneous opinions be confuted? Not
by blind followers, but by acute reason∣ers:
and such will be indebted to me e∣ven
for my errors; as exercise is the sove∣reign
means for advancing the reasoning
faculty to maturity. We submit impli∣citly
to a work in which there is nothing
to be corrected; and sink imperceptibly in∣to
indolence and inattention. But the de∣tection
of one error, makes the reader
hunt for more; and the game is pursued
with vigour. In that view, I would not
prefer even Aristotle before the author of
<PB N="xii" REF="9"/>
<HI>L'Esprit des Loix.</HI> That celebrated writer
abounds with observations, no less plea∣sing
than solid. But a sprightly genius,
prone to novelty and refinement, has be∣trayed
him into manifold errors; and the
reader is never suffered to fall asleep.</P>
<P>The reasonings of Roman lawyers are
always elegant, and generally correct.
Their arguments however seldom reach to
first principles. These were little thought
of so early, even in the schools of philo∣sophy;
nor is it yet common to trace an
argument so far back. In the present es∣says,
there are some slight attempts to
reach first principles: who knows whe∣ther
this small seed may not produce plen∣ty
of fruit! I expect not approbation in
my own time; no not if my life were to
be prolonged half a century. In law, as
in religion, the student acquires from his
preceptors a number of practical rules;
and in youth these rules make an impres∣sion
so deep, as never to be eradicated. If
this work make any impression, it must
be on the <HI>tabula rasa</HI> of a new generation:
upon them I trust it will make an impres∣sion;
and that prospect is my reward. I
<PB N="xiii" REF="10"/>
wish to be useful: success depends not on
me.</P>
<P>Were law taught as a rational science,
its principles unfolded, and its connection
with manners and politics, it would prove
an enticing study to every person who has
an appetite for knowledge. We might
hope to see our lawyers soaring above their
predecessors; and giving splendor to their
country, by purifying and improving its
laws.</P>
<P>As my intention is only to give ex∣amples
of reasoning, free from the shackles
of authority, I pretend not to say what
our law actually is, but what it ought to
be.</P>

<HEAD>ELUCIDATIONS
RESPECTING
The COMMON and STATUTE
LAW of SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Voluntary obligation by a minor without
consent of curators, and by a married
woman.</HEAD>
<P>A Minor's bond without consent of his
curators, is held to be void by writers
on the Roman law; and also by our
writers, who follow implicitly their
masters. I cannot submit to this doctrine. By
the common law of the Romans, no difference
was made between a major and a minor; and
curators were given by the Pretor to a minor,
in order to protect him from being hurt by his
imbecility. A minor's bond therefore must in
Rome have been effectual at common law, no
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
less than a bond granted by a major; and the
pretor had no power to annul such a bond, in
contradiction to common law. His power reach∣ed
no farther, than to supply defects in common
law, and to correct any wrong that might happen
by a too rigid application of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 3. § 1. De justicia et jure.</NOTE>. Thus, where
a minor was sued for payment of a bond granted
by him to his hurt without consent of his cura∣tors,
it was incumbent on the pretor to sustain
action; but then he rendered the bond ineffec∣tual,
by sustaining an exception in equity. And
by the same equitable power, he afforded a <HI>resti∣tutio
in integrum,</HI> where there was no process
to give opportunity for proponing an exception<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See l. 101. verb. oblig.; l. 43. oblig. act.; Heineccius, tit. Minor, § 495.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A minor's bond in Scotland, though granted
without consent of curators, cannot be null <HI>ipso
jure;</HI> for it may happen to be highly beneficial to
him. If challengeable, it requires in strict form
to be taken out of the way by reduction. But as,
in this country, a ground of reduction instantly
verified, is admitted in the form of an exception,
to save expence and delay; a minor who grants
a bond without consent of curators, is presumed
to be hurt by it; and the presumption is admitted
by way of exception, because it requires no
proof. This form has led our writers inadvert∣ently
<PB N="3" REF="16"/>
to say, that a bond granted by a minor
without consent of ourators, is void and null.
And yet, such a bond is every day sustained a∣gainst
a reduction, upon evidence given that it
is not hurtful to the minor. Now a deed that is
void and null, cannot be supported by any evi∣dence.
Further, though the objection of hurt or
lesion will be admitted in a suspension of such a
bond; yet if evidence be brought of a valuable
consideration, the bond will be sustained, and the
letters be found orderly proceeded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 22d June 1627, Drummond; 11th December 1629, Gordon; 5th February 1631, Inglis. All collect∣ed by Dury.</NOTE>. I add,
that such a bond, if not challenged within forty
years, will stand good against all objections;
though it is clear, that a bond originally null,
cannot become effectual by any length of time.
These considerations make it evident, that a mi∣nor's
bond without consent of curators, is not
void, but voidable only.</P>
<P>In Justinian's Novel 134. cap. 8. an obligation
by a woman for behoof of her husband, is pro∣hibited.
We have taken the hint, and have ex∣tended
it. “By our custom,” says Lord Stair,
a wife's obligation for debt, or personal obli∣gation,
contracted during the marriage, is
null<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Institutions, book 1. tit. 4. § 16.</NOTE>.” That such a bond is voidable, is un∣questionable;
<PB N="4" REF="17"/>
but I cannot admit it to be void,
more than a bond by a minor without consent of
curators. A bond by a married woman produces
undoubtedly an obligation by the law of nature,
or a natural obligation, as termed by Roman
writers; and I find no statute, nor rule at com∣mon
law, prohibiting such a bond, or declaring
it void when granted. The law of Scotland, it is
true, in order to protect a wife from being hurt
by her commercial dealings, affords her an ex∣ception
against such a bond, which she may use
when she thinks herself over-reached. The ex∣ception
protects her from payment; but if she
do not use it, the bond is effectual in law. And
that this is the doctrine of our law, will appear
from the following considerations. First, it is not
<HI>pars judicis</HI> to refuse action upon such a bond;
the judge must sustain action, and pronounce sen∣tence,
if the exception be not stated. Second, if
a married woman become cautioner in a bond for
borrowed money, and obtain a security for her
relief, she may unquestionably operate her relief
by that security; and yet, if the cautionary oblige∣ment
were void in law, the security could not
subsist. Thus a man having granted an assign∣ment
to his wife for relieving her of a debt in
which she was cautioner for him, it was decreed,
that the wife might submit to the cautionary ob∣ligement,
and insist on the assignment for her re∣lief
<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, 18th July 1672, Watson <HI>contra</HI> Bruce.</NOTE>. Third, if a wife have a fund appointed
for her aliment exclusive of the <HI>jus mariti,</HI> her
bond for furnishing will be sustained<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stair, 23d February 1672, Neilson <HI>contra</HI> Arthur.</NOTE>. And in
general, a bond by a married woman for a valu∣able
consideration, will in every case be sustained.
If so, the just notion of such a bond seems to be
what follows. A woman under coverture seldom
has occasion to deal in money-matters. The hus∣band
is the administrator of her effects, and is
bound to provide her with all necessaries. There∣fore
where she grants a bond of borrowed mo∣ney,
her situation affords a presumption of impo∣sition;
which she may state by way of exception,
because it requires no proof. But if the excep∣tion
be removed, by giving evidence of a valuable
consideration, the bond will be effectual. In that
view, the case of a wife resembles that of a mi∣nor,
or of a person interdicted. The only dif∣ference
is, that a bond granted by a minor, or
by an interdicted person, is good in law if the cu∣rators
or interdictors consent; which removes the
presumption of imposition. But a bond granted
by a married woman, is exceptionable though
the husband consent; because his consent removes
not the presumption of imposition.</P>
<P>Here it may be observed, that when a ground
of reduction is cut off by the negative prescrip∣tion,
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
it cannot be urged by way of exception,
more than in a regular process of reduction. As
it is admitted in the form of an exception, mere∣ly
to save the expence and delay of a reduction;
if it be not competent by reduction, as little
ought it to be competent by exception. Hence
the rule in the Roman law, <HI>Temporanea ad a∣gendum
sunt perpetua ad excipiendum,</HI> obtains
not with us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>ART. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What obligations are effectually conveyed
by assignment.</HEAD>
<P>A Debtor cannot relieve himself from his ob∣ligation
by substituting another in his
place, unless the creditor consent. As little can
the creditor substitute another in his place, where
the obligation is to pay to him and not to any o∣ther
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, tit. Assignation, sect. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In order to make obligations more useful, an
indirect method of transmission was invented,
which is a procuratory <HI>in rem suam</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sect. 3. eod.</NOTE>. But a
procuratory <HI>in rem suam</HI> is, from its nature, con∣fined
to money-obligations, extinguishable by
payment. If I give a mandate to receive from
my debtor the money he owes me, he can have
no just objection against paying to the mandata∣ry;
because such payment dissolves the obliga∣tion;
and the mandatary, by my consent, may
retain the money as payment of what I owe him.
An obligation <HI>ad factum praestandum</HI> is very dif∣ferent.
It is the same to me, whether I pay mo∣ney
to my creditor or to his mandatary; but it
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
is not the same to me, whether I perform perso∣nal
service to my superior or to his mandatary.
If I have obliged myself to lend my horse to John,
there is a <HI>delectus personae,</HI> and I am not bound
to lend it to any other. An obligation to dispone
land to James, will not bind me to dispone it to
John. I purchase land under reversion to the
vender, he cannot oblige me to redispone it to a∣ny
other. I accept Alexander for my tenant,
and grant a lease to him: he has no power to in∣troduce
another into the possession of my land in∣stead
of himself. Hence the maxim, That tacks
and reversions are <HI>stricti juris;</HI> and that assig∣nees
are excluded, unless named in the deed.</P>
<P>With respect to tacks in particular, this propo∣sition
appears so clear, as to occasion some degree
of wonder what could influence the court of ses∣sion
to make an exception with respect to liferent∣tacks.
Lord Stair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Institutions, book 2. tit. 9. sect. 26.</NOTE>, on the authority of Craig,
and one or two decisions, lays it down, that life∣rent-tacks
may be assigned, though not mention∣ing
assignees. His Lordship would have been
puzzled for an answer to this plain question, What
intitles a tacksman to give any one a settlement
on land that is not his property? And the same
objection lies with respect to a tack for nineteen
years. A tack is a mere personal right: it was
not made real by the act 18. parl. 1449, which
<PB N="9" REF="22"/>
only declares, “That, for the safety and encou∣ragement
of poor people who labour the
ground, their tacks shall be secure against a
purchaser of the land.” By what means se∣cure?
Not by converting a tack into a real
right, contrary to its nature, and without necessi∣ty;
but by a statutory prohibition, precisely as an
entail is secure against the deeds of the proprie∣tor.
Now, if a tack be only a personal right,
what intitles the tacksman to put any other in his
place? and what is it that binds the proprietor,
to admit any person to possess his land without his
consent? This argument, founded on the nature
of property, appears to me invincible. In short,
I can discover no cause that impowers a tacksman,
more than a reverser, to substitute another in his
place.</P>
<P>A procuratory <HI>in rem suam</HI> is but a precarious
right; for it bars not the cedent from receiving
payment. To give a bond for borrowed money
a more secure currency, a clause has been invent∣ed,
taking the debtor bound to pay the sum to
any person who shall be authorised by the creditor
to receive payment; which is commonly expressed
in the following terms, obliging the borrower to
pay to the lender, or to his assignee. And thus,
with the consent of the debtor himself, the assig∣nee
is intitled to sue for payment. Thus, an as∣signment
of such a bond intimated to the debtor,
makes a complete transmission of the <HI>jus crediti,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="23"/>
divesting the cedent <HI>funditus;</HI> which is a sub∣stantial
improvement in the commerce of money-obligations.
The clause mentioned was too use∣ful
to be confined to money-obligations. It has
been extended to obligations <HI>ad facta praestan∣da;</HI>
and hence a power to assign is frequently ad∣hibited
to tacks and reversions.</P>
<P>Every exception against the cedent is effectual
against his procurator; but where an assignment
is consented to, none but real exceptions, such as
arise from the nature of the right, ought to be ef∣fectual
against the assignee.</P>
<P>There are however assignments that denude
not the cedent. An assignment to rents of land,
will bar the cedent from levying the rents; but it
will not bar the cedent from conveying the land
itself, nor the purchaser from levying the rents
<HI>qua</HI> proprietor of the land. There can be no in∣defeasible
right to rents, otherwise than by dispo∣ning
the property of the land, or by creating a
real right upon it.</P>

<HEAD>ART. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A challenge against the author, in what
cases sustained against the person who
acquires from him.</HEAD>
<P>A Challenge founded on a defect of right in
the author, is essentially different from a
challenge founded on personal circumstances.
The former is made effectual by a declarator of
nullity: the latter, by a reduction. A declara∣tor
of nullity concludes, that the author had no
power to convey the subject; and therefore that
the purchaser has no right: a reduction admits
that the subject was conveyed; but concludes, that
the purchaser did wrong in making the purchase,
and therefore that he ought to be deprived of
the subject. A declarator of nullity is according∣ly
a real action; and it is the nature of a real ac∣tion
to be effectual against every singular succes∣sor:
a reduction is a personal action, which can
only be effectual against the person guilty. The
following examples will illustrate the distinction.
Property is transferred by consent with delivery:
force or fear may produce external expressions of
consent; but the internal act, which is the capi∣tal
part, will not be presumed, unless where a
man is at liberty to act according to his own will.
<PB N="12" REF="25"/>
Therefore, as there is no consent in the case of
force or fear, the property of the subject is not
transferred, though delivery be made; and the
purchaser, though not accessory to the wrong, is
deprived of the possession by a declarator of nul∣lity,
which is in effect the same with the <HI>rei vin∣dicatio</HI>
in the Roman law. Let us suppose now
a subject to have been acquired by fraud. Fraud
is no obstruction to consent, more than error is:
on the contrary, it shews in what manner the dis∣poner
was deluded to consent, and to convey.
Fraud then obstructs not the transmission of pro∣perty;
and has no effect but to found a reduction
against the purchaser, concluding, that he ought
not to hold a subject which he fraudulently acqui∣red.</P>
<P>From these premises it is evident, that a decla∣rator
of nullity is effectual against every acquirer,
not excepting a purchaser for a valuable conside∣ration:
the objection lies, that he purchased <HI>a non
habente potestatem.</HI> A reduction is very differ∣ent:
it is founded on personal circumstances, and
therefore cannot be effectual against a <HI>bona fide</HI>
purchaser for a valuable consideration. To illu∣strate
the latter proposition, I shall give a few ex∣amples.</P>
<P>I begin with a reduction on the head of fraud;
as to which hear Lord Stair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book. 4. tit. 40. sect. 21.</NOTE>. “Fraud being
<PB N="13" REF="26"/>
of a criminal nature, is not relevant against sin∣gular
successors, not partakers of the fraud,
but only against the committers of the fraud,
and those representing them, especially as to
feudal rights. The reason whereof is, to se∣cure
land-rights, and that purchasers be not
disappointed. But in personal rights the fraud
of authors is relevant against singular succes∣sors,
though not partakers nor conscious of the
fraud when they purchased: because assignees
are but procurators, albeit <HI>in rem suam;</HI> and
therefore are in the same case with their ce∣dents.
Yet in moveables, purchasers are not
quarrelable upon the fraud of their authors, if
they did purchase for an onerous equivalent
cause. The reason is, that moveables must
have a current course of traffic; and the buyer
is not to consider how the seller purchased, un∣less
it were by theft or violence, which the law
accounts a <HI>labes realis</HI> following the subject
to all successors; otherwise there would be the
greatest encouragement to theft and robbery.”
The reason here given why the purchaser of
moveables is not affected with the fraud of his
author, is for the sake of commerce. But there
is a better reason, founded on principles of law.
A purchaser of land who completes his right by
infeftment, acquires the indefeasible property;
and it is a rule of justice without a single excep∣tion,
That no man can be deprived of his pro∣perty
<PB N="14" REF="27"/>
without his consent, unless as a punishment
where he has committed a crime. This proposi∣tion
is drived from the very nature of property;
and consequently is equally applicable to the pur∣chase
of a moveable. “But the fraud of the
cedent is relevant against the assignee,” says his
Lordship, “because an assignee is only a procu∣rator.”
An assignment even <HI>in rem suam</HI> did
not transfer the <HI>jus crediti</HI> when his Lordship
composed his Institutions; and as the assignee
could only insist in name of his cedent, every ob∣jection
against the cedent was of course good a∣gainst
him. But as an assignment intimated is
now held to be a <HI>cessio in jure,</HI> this variation
places the purchaser of a <HI>jus crediti</HI> upon the
same footing with the purchaser of a moveable or
of land; and consequently ought to secure him
from being liable for the fraud of his cedent.
Yet to this day, fraud is made to operate against
the assignee, precisely as in the days of Lord
Stair; not adverting, that an assignment is at
present a very different right from what it was for∣merly.
Compensation is in a similar case: it is
by custom made effectual against an assignee for
a valuable consideration, because it was legally
effectual when an assignee was only a procura∣tor
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Principles of Equity, edit. 2. p. 206.</NOTE>. In this manner has our law in many par∣ticulars
become a heap of inconsistencies: rules o∣riginally
<PB N="15" REF="28"/>
well founded, are preserved in practice;
not only after the causes that produced them have
ceased, but causes inconsistent with them have
been introduced.</P>
<P>There are certain grounds in equity, that ex∣tend
a reduction even against parties who had no
accession to the wrong. A reduction on the head
of fraud, though it cannot reach a <HI>bona fide</HI> pur∣chaser
of land or of a moveable who has given a
valuable consideration, will be sustained against a
purchaser who has given no equivalent; on the
following ground of equity, <HI>Quod nemo debet lo∣cupletari
aliena jactura,</HI> which obliges him to
yield the subject to the pursuer, or to pay a just
price<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, 18th December 1667, Auchinleck <HI>contra</HI> Williamson.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though an assignment has now the effect of a
<HI>cessio in jure,</HI> yet where an assignment to a <HI>jus
crediti</HI> has been procured by fraud, a reduction
on that head is effectual against a creditor of the
assignee, arresting in the hands of the debtor.
This proceeds from the nature of an arrestment.
An arrestment, like an inhibition, bars voluntary
deeds only, not what are necessary, <HI>i. e.</HI> what the
common debtor is bound antecedently to perform.
A landholder, for example, sells his farm-victual:
an arrestment laid in the hands of the tenants be∣fore
delivery, but after the sale, will not bar the
<PB N="16" REF="29"/>
common debtor from making delivery. To ap∣ply
this doctrine to the case in hand, a man who
by fraud has procured an assignment to a <HI>jus cre∣diti,</HI>
is bound in conscience to retrocess the ce∣dent,
as the proper reparation of the wrong he
has done; and the retrocession accordingly is a
necessary act, which cannot be prevented by an
arrestment. For the same reason, where a man,
conscious of his insolvency, purchases goods with∣out
any prospect of paying the price, a reduction
on the head of fraud will be sustained against his
creditors, arresting the goods in the hands of the
person to whom they were delivered for his be∣hoof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, Fountainhall, 22d December 1680, Prince <HI>contra</HI> Pallat; Dalrymple, Bruce, 18th January 1715, Main <HI>contra</HI> Maxwell; 8th December 1736, Sir John Inglis <HI>contra</HI> Royal Bank.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is another reason more general, that
makes a reduction on the head of fraud effectual,
not only against an arrestment, but also against
other legal diligence. This reason is fully ex∣plained
in the Principles of Equity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">b. 1. part 1. ch. 7. sect. 2. edit. 2.</NOTE>; and is
shortly what follows. “That the man who by
fraud, or other illegal means, has acquired a
subject, is bound in conscience to restore it to
the person injured; and therefore that a court
of equity will refuse its aid to the creditors of
<PB N="17" REF="30"/>
the acquirer attaching the subject, who ought
not to demand from their debtor what he is
bound in conscience to restore to another.”
Thus, where land is purchased fraudulently, the
vender is intitled to exclude the creditors of the
purchaser from adjudging the subject. And there
is <HI>par ratio</HI> that the vender should exclude the
poinder of moveables purchased by fraud. But
where the execution is completed, and the pro∣perty
transferred, without any obstruction from
the vender, he is left without remedy, except a∣gainst
the fraudulent purchaser himself. For, as
above mentioned, it is an inviolable rule, that
property fairly transferred must remain with the
<HI>bona fide</HI> purchaser: he cannot be deprived of
his property without his consent, as no wrong can
be laid to his charge.</P>
<P>We proceed to other grounds of reduction.
An inhibition prohibits the debtor to sell land, and
others to purchase, in prejudice of the inhibiter.
An inhibition therefore is a <HI>personal</HI> prohibition
only, and is not a <HI>real</HI> impediment to the convey∣ance
of land. The purchaser infeft becomes pro∣prietor,
and is now the vassal in place of his au∣thor.
He is liable indeed to be deprived of his
purchase, having acquired it in contempt of legal
authority. But if, before an action of reduction
be commenced, he have sold the land, the new
purchaser will be secure: he is guilty of no con∣tempt
of authority, because the person from
<PB N="18" REF="31"/>
whom he purchased was not inhibited. In a
word, a reduction <HI>ex capite inhibitionis</HI> is mere∣ly
a personal action, and cannot reach any one
who has not contemned the inhibition. The only
way for making an inhibition operate against sin∣gular
successors, is to insist in a process against
the first purchaser, which, rendering the subject
litigious, prevents any to purchase from him.</P>
<P>If it be held, that the power a man has to a∣lienate
his land is taken from him by law when
on deathbed, a reduction on the head of death∣bed
is upon that supposition a declarator of nul∣lity,
operating against every singular successor;
and this was decreed in a case reported by Foun∣tainhall
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">18th December 1697, Livingston <HI>contra</HI> Burn.</NOTE>. But if it be held, that a man on death∣bed
retains the power of alienation that he had
when in health, and that he is limited from alie∣nating
by the heir's privilege only, which seems to
be the more sound opinion, a deed on deathbed
is effectual against all the world, the heir only ex∣cepted;
and it is effectual also against him if he
bring no challenge within forty years. Accord∣ing
to that opinion, the reduction, being merely
a personal action, reaches the person only who ac∣quired
from the proprietor on deathbed, and not
those who <HI>bona fide</HI> purchase from that person for
a valuable consideration.</P>
<P>Minority and lesion make a ground of reduction
<PB N="19" REF="32"/>
only, and not, like force or fear, a <HI>real</HI> obstruction
to a conveyance. A reduction on minority and
lesion was accordingly sustained against the per∣son
who purchased from the minor, but not a∣gainst
one to whom the purchaser sold the sub∣ject
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">25th January 1728, Gourlay <HI>contra</HI> Gourlay.</NOTE>. Yet, for the reason above given, a re∣duction
on this head of a disposition of land, is
effectual against creditors adjudging the subject.
And in the Dictionary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. p. 581.</NOTE> there are many deci∣sions
where that point is on all hands taken for
granted.</P>
<P>If a purchaser refuse or delay to pay the price,
the vender may either sue him at common law for
the price, or bring a process in equity to reduce
the bargain<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stair, 20th July 1675, Maitland <HI>contra</HI> Gight.</NOTE>. With regard to the latter, justice
will not suffer the vender to be deprived both of
his land and of the price. This bars not the pur∣chaser
from selling the subject, before reduction
be raised against him; in which case the second
purchaser acting <HI>bona fide</HI> will be secure. But
the creditors of the first purchaser will be barred;
because a court of equity will not permit them to
attach by legal execution what their debtor cannot
hold without paying the price. This in effect was
found, December 1721, Selkirk <HI>contra</HI> credi∣tors
of her deceased husband. The case was this.
<PB N="20" REF="33"/>
In a contract of marriage, the bride disponed to
her future husband, in name of tocher, some
houses in the town of Glasgow; and was provi∣ded
by him in a liferent annuity of 1000 merks.
The husband died insolvent; and the widow
brought a reduction of the disposition granted by
her to her husband, because the liferent annuity,
which was the price, was by his insolvency ren∣dered
ineffectual. It was decreed, that the cre∣ditors
were barred from attaching the houses till
the pursuer's liferent should be made effectual.</P>
<P>Hitherto of <HI>bona fide</HI> purchasers. Next of
<HI>mala fide</HI> purchasers, who know of the challenge
or exception that lies against the author. It is
laid down above, that the fraud of the author will
affect those who purchase from him, knowing of
the fraud. For fraud, like other crimes, involves
the accessories in the same punishment with the
principal offender; and the receipter accordingly
is held equally criminal with the thief. But it ap∣pears
doubtful, how far accessories to slighter de∣licts
are punishable by a civil court.</P>
<P>Of such delicts there are various kinds. First,
A delict <HI>contra bonos mores;</HI> an act not wrong in
itself, but wrong with respect to consequences, as
tending to corrupt the morals of a people; such
as, purchases by a tutor, curator, factor, agent, of
debts due by the person for whom they act; pur∣chases
of pleas by members of the college of ju∣stice;
<HI>pacta de quota litis,</HI> and such like. I dis∣cover
<PB N="21" REF="34"/>
not in our practice, that the challenge which
lies against the man who makes such a purchase, is
extended against those who purchase from him,
though privy to the wrong done by their author.
Thus, though an advocate is not suffered to take
any benefit from a purchase made by him of a de∣pending
process; yet the law does not militate a∣gainst
those who purchase from him, though know∣ing
of the wrong.</P>
<P>Second, Wrongs done to the hurt of society,
but not in so tender a point as that of corrupting
morals; a prohibition, for example, to kill sal∣mon
at a certain season. The transgressor is pu∣nished
by statute; but the person who purchases
salmon from him, is not liable. It is only a sta∣tutory
delict; and not so noxious as to affect the
purchaser where the law is silent.</P>
<P>Third, Prohibitions calculated for the good of
certain individuals, that have no bad tendency
with regard to others. A man who purchases
from a person inhibited, is laid open to a reduc∣tion
<HI>ex capite inhibitionis.</HI> But the man who
purchases from him is secure, even though he
knew of the inhibition. He is indeed accessory
to the wrong done by his author; but his con∣science
does not condemn him, because a legal
wrong affects only the person who commits it.
Linton feued to Millar land rented at L. 40
Scots yearly. The charter contains a clause, de∣claring,
that the vassal shall not sell the land, with∣out
<PB N="22" REF="35"/>
first making an offer to sell it to his superior
at the price paid for the feu, with an additional
sum for improvements: and any conveyance
made by the vassal contrary to this provision, is
declared null. The vassal having sold the land
without making an offer to his superior, a reduc∣tion
was brought against the purchaser by the su∣perior,
upon the medium, that he was in the
knowledge of the provision in the feu-charter;
and therefore, that being accessory to the fraud
of his author, his right ought to be reduced.
The purchaser was assoilzied, as not being answer∣able
for the wrong done by his author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">4th January 1757, Sir William Stirling <HI>contra</HI> John∣ston.</NOTE>. An
heir of entail, prohibited to sell, or to contract
debt, is guilty of a breach of engagement by sell∣ing;
and the person who knowingly purchases
from him is accessory to the wrong. But then
the prohibition is hurtful to the public, by re∣straining
the commerce of land; and therefore,
where such a prohibition is transgressed, the
wrong is so slight as not to affect an accessory.
Even where an entail is recorded, and complete
in all its solemnities, yet if an heir entering fail to
engross in his infeftment the clauses of the entail,
it is declared by the statute 1685, that a purcha∣ser
from him is secure, however well acquainted
he be with the entail.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="36"/>
Whether it would not be an improvement in
our law, to subject accessories in the cases men∣tioned
as well as in the case of fraud, merits con∣sideration.
A man of strict honesty will avoid the
tempting an heir of entail to transgress his duty;
and therefore it is not strictly honest to purchase
from him. But our law has not yet acquired so
much purity and refinement, as to bar purchases
where the wrong is only statutory, and not a wrong
by the law of nature.</P>

<HEAD>ART. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Delivery of a deed.</HEAD>
<P>PAper, being a <HI>corpus,</HI> is a subject of proper∣ty;
and not less so for having a writing upon
it. A manuscript must belong to some person;
and none but the proprietor is intitled to hold
the possession, or to avail himself of it. For ex∣ample,
none but the proprietor is intitled to pro∣duce
a deed or obligation in process, in order to
found a claim upon it.</P>
<P>Delivery of a deed respects the manuscript as
a <HI>corpus;</HI> and the use of delivery is the same
here as in other <HI>corpora,</HI> viz. to transfer the pro∣perty.</P>
<P>Writings, as far as law is concerned, are of
two kinds; one that serves to create a right or
obligation; and one that serves for evidence on∣ly.
A writing of the latter kind, whoever be the
proprietor, may be called for as evidence, pre∣cisely
as a witness may be called. This is the
case of a notary's instrument, of a special service,
of a general service, of a missive letter, and of ma∣ny
others.</P>
<P>With respect to writings of the first kind, I
doubt whether any general rule can be given,
for determining what of them require delivery,
<PB N="25" REF="38"/>
what not. But to approach the nearest we can to
a rule, a distinction must be made between cove∣nants
and single deeds; as also between single
deeds binding the granter, and single deeds bind∣ing
the heir only.</P>
<P>A mutual contract or covenant requires no deli∣very
between the parties. Paper bought to write
the convenant upon, requires delivery; and being
delivered to the contractors conjunctly, it be∣comes
their property in common. This super∣sedes
the necessity of any new delivery; for the
paper cannot be more or less their common pro∣perty
by being written upon.</P>
<P>The solemnity of delivery is therefore confined
to single deeds. And the question is, What neces∣sity
there is for that solemnity? A bond by which
I bind myself to pay a sum to any person, is my pro∣perty,
supposing the paper upon which it is written
to have been so. While it remains in my hand, I
can cancel it, or throw it into the fire; having the
same power over it as over any other thing that be∣longs
to me. But delivery transfers the property of
the bond, as a <HI>corpus,</HI> to the creditor; who is
now intitled to use it as he pleases; to make it the
foundation of a process for payment, or to throw it
into the fire. I talk of a deed <HI>inter vivos.</HI> A deed
of a testamentary nature is different: it must, like
other moveables, pass from the dead to the living
without delivery; otherwise it could never pass;
for there is none to make delivery after the pro∣prietor's
<PB N="26" REF="39"/>
death. And hence it is, that by the
granter's death the property of such a deed is <HI>ip∣so
facto</HI> transferred to the person in whose favour
it is conceived. And this holds not only in a te∣stament,
but in every deed that is not intended
to be delivered while the granter is alive, such as
a bond or disposition reserving the granter's life∣rent.
But such a deed differs from a testament
in the following respect, that delivery of it to
the grantee, establishes the right in him, leaving
nothing in the power of the granter but his life∣rent
only.</P>
<P>And this leads to consider a deed <HI>inter vivos</HI>
remaining undelivered at the granter's death,
though intended to be made effectual without de∣lay.
Will it be made effectual by a court of ju∣stice,
or is it void for want of delivery? This
question admits no general rule; because dif∣ferent
circumstances produce different conclu∣sions.
Some distinctions are necessary to put
these circumstances in a proper light. I distin∣guish,
first, a deed purely gratuitous, from a
deed proceeding from a just cause or motive.
And I next distinguish a deed purely gratuitous
containing a clause dispensing with delivery, from
a deed of the same nature without that clause.</P>
<P>I begin with the last case, because it throws
light upon the rest. A gratuitous deed <HI>inter vi∣vos,</HI>
if it have not a clause dispensing with deli∣very,
bears naturally the construction, that the
<PB N="27" REF="40"/>
granter intended to make it instantly effectual by
delivery; and his forbearing to deliver, affords
a presumption of his having altered his intention.
His forbearing to destroy the deed, affords no
argument on the other side; because it may be
fairly accounted for from neglect, or want of me∣mory.</P>
<P>But in a deed <HI>inter vivos,</HI> a clause dispensing
with delivery is a declaration, that the granter in∣tends
not to make the deed presently effectual.
The delay therefore of delivery is no evidence of
change of mind, even though he die in the <HI>inte∣rim.</HI>
And if his mind continued the same to the
hour of his death, the deed must pass to the gran∣tee,
and be effectual against the granter's repre∣sentatives.</P>
<P>A remuneratory deed <HI>inter vivos,</HI> or one pro∣ceeding
from a just cause, requires not a clause
dispensing with delivery. The delay of delivery
will not presume a change of mind; which would
be unjust, or at least unreasonable. Such a deed
therefore will, after the granter's death, be effec∣tual
without delivery: the property of it will pass
to the grantee; and the representatives of the
granter will be liable. A bond of provision to a
child proceeds from a just cause, viz. a natural ob∣ligation
to provide children. And therefore, e∣ven
where the granter binds himself as well as
his heirs, yet the forbearing to deliver will not
presume a change of mind: the bond will be ef∣fectual
<PB N="28" REF="41"/>
upon the granter's death against his repre∣sentatives.</P>
<P>An assignment to a bond, or a conveyance of
any other subject, will be effectual, if there was
any just cause for granting, though the assign∣ment
or conveyance remain with the granter till
his death. It has accordingly been found more
than once, that an assignment to a creditor for
his security or payment, will, after the cedent's
death, be effectual, though never delivered to
the creditor. The case is more doubtful where
the assignment is a pure gratuity. This case lies in
the middle between a gratuitous bond <HI>inter vivos</HI>
binding the granter himself, and a gratuitous bond
<HI>mortis causa,</HI> binding his representatives only.
Though a gratuitous assignment be framed in the
present tense, that circumstance will scarce infer
an intention to make the assignment presently ef∣fectual;
for which reason the forbearing to deli∣ver
will not presume change of mind, at least not
so clearly as the forbearing to deliver a bond
binding the granter. This case appears extreme∣ly
arbitrary, and forces the mind to look about
for some determining circumstance. May it not
be thought, that such an assignment to a near re∣lation
will be effectual without delivery; not
where it is to a stranger, especially if the granter
live long after executing the assignment?</P>

<HEAD>ART. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Form of completing marriage by the law
of Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>FEW branches of our law are handled with
less precision, than what particulars are ne∣cessary
to complete a marriage. There is a dark∣ness
and confusion in our writers, from jumbling
together three points that are clearly distinct.
The first is, What solemnities are necessary to
complete a marriage? The second, What cir∣cumstances
are sufficient to presume, that mar∣riage
has been regularly solemnized? And the
third, What circumstances are sufficient to oblige
a party by a process to solemnize a marriage?</P>
<P>With respect to the first, Marriage required no
solemnity before the time of Pope Innocent III.
The bridegroom went to the house where the
bride lived, and led her home to his own house;
by which simple form, they became husband and
wife. But a ceremony so slight giving occasion
to many questions about marriage, both with re∣gard
to the parties and their issue, marriage in
the church before the priest was established as an
essential solemnity. Thus, though consent may,
<HI>in foro poli,</HI> make a marriage; yet, in all civilized
countries, certain solemnities are requisite to com∣plete
<PB N="30" REF="43"/>
a marriage; and public utility makes these
solemnities indispensable, in order to remove
doubts about lawful issue, and to prevent the
intricacy and uncertainty of parole-evidence. In
England, a marriage must be celebrated <HI>in facie
ecclesiae:</HI> in Holland, there must be proclamation
of bans: in Scotland, this proclamation is useful
for the greater solemnity, and to give opportunity
for objecting to the marriage; but the priest's
blessing appears to be the only solemnity that is
indispensable.</P>
<P>With respect to the second point, Though a
marriage had subsisted twenty, thirty, or forty
years; yet, if called in question, it was necessary,
by the original law of this kingdom, to bring e∣vidence
of the solemnization. To make so im∣portant
a fact as marriage to depend for ever up∣on
oral evidence, was stretching law beyond the
bounds of reason and common sense; and the
hardship was corrected by act 77. parl. 1503, set∣ting
forth, That widows, in prosecuting the brieve
of terce, were often embarrassed by being obli∣ged
to prove their marriage; therefore enacting,
That if the marriage be not objected to in the
man's life, it shall be sufficient to obtain possession
of the terce, that the pursuer was habite and re∣pute
to be the man's lawful wife during his life,
“until it be clearly decerned, and sentence gi∣ven,
that she was not his lawful wife.” This
act of parliament has been justly extended in prac∣tice,
<PB N="31" REF="44"/>
to secure a husband in his courtesy; to pre∣vent
children from being held as bastards; and,
in case of desertion after some years cohabita∣tion,
to save the trouble of proving, that the mar∣riage
was regularly solemnized. This presump∣tion
in favour of marriage obtains in England as
well as here; and from the nature of the thing,
must obtain in every country where law is a
science.</P>
<P>With respect to the third point, viz. What cir∣cumstances
are sufficient to oblige a party by a
process to solemnize a marriage, I observe, that
among the Romans, mutual consent to solemnize
marriage at a time specified, termed <HI>sponsalia,</HI>
did not oblige the parties to complete the mar∣riage;
subjecting only the party who repented to
a claim of damages. Afterward, either party
might draw back, upon forfeiting the arles; and
by a law of the Emperor Leo, it was declared,
that the <HI>sponsalia</HI> might be fortified with a pe∣nal
stipulation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voet De sponsalibus, sect. 12.</NOTE>. We probably borrowed this
law from the Romans. Balfour (Marriage) says,
that a contract to complete the band of marriage
within a day named, under the penalty of a cer∣tain
sum to the King, and another sum as dama∣ges
to the party willing to perform, is lawful and
effectual. And Spottiswood (Marriage) is of
the same opinion. But our later practice admits
<PB N="32" REF="45"/>
change of mind; and action is not sustained for
the penalty. But there is no reason why dama∣ges
should not be due<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dictionary,</HI> Locus poenitentiae, in fine.</NOTE>. The law of Holland is
different. A mutual promise of marriage even
<HI>de futuro,</HI> is a good foundation for an action to
compel the refractory party to complete the mar∣riage,
unless there be a mid-impediment by a
subsequent marriage regularly solemnized. In
England the same law obtains. Though a pri∣vate
contract, without the priest's blessing, makes
not a marriage, yet such contract may be enfor∣ced
in the spiritual court<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">New Abridgement of the law, vol. 3. p. 575.</NOTE>. In the law of Scot∣land,
though a private contract is not binding to
oblige either party to solemnize marriage; yet
such a contract, with a subsequent <HI>copula,</HI> is suf∣ficient.
For though there be <HI>locus poenitentiae</HI>
after such a contract <HI>rebus integris;</HI> yet, where a
<HI>copula</HI> follows upon the faith of such a contract,
it would be unjust to permit either of the parties
to draw back; especially the man, when the wo∣man
has surrendered her person to him. And
accordingly an action is given in the spiritual
court, as in England, to oblige the refractory
person to solemnize the marriage. Craig ex∣plains
the nature of this action, which concludes
against the party drawing back, that he or she
shall be obliged to solemnize the marriage. The
<PB N="33" REF="46"/>
consequence is, that upon refusal, the marriage
is declared complete; and the decree of the com∣missaries
stands in place of the solemnity. “Com∣missarii,
viri acuti, successionem bonorum no∣bilium
concesserunt liberis Edwardi Younger,
licet matrimonium nunquam fuit contractum,
neque banna proclamata; ea ratione, quod
cum Edwardus, sub fide futuri matrimonii, eos
liberos suscepisset, materque apud commissarios
causam obtinuisset, ut Edwardus matrimonium
promissum implere cogeretur, eo recusante,
perinde habuerunt ac si eam in uxorem duxis∣set,
liberisque bonorum mobilium executio sive
hereditas adjudicata est<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Craig, lib. 2. dieg. 18. § 19.</NOTE>” And Lord Stair
observes another case<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Institutes, new edition, p. 26.</NOTE>, where a man was found
obliged to solemnize the marriage, seeing he had
children by the woman under promise of mar∣riage.</P>
<P>From some loose expressions of Lord Stair in
the title of Marriage, an opinion has prevailed of
late years, that a promise of marriage, with a
subsequent <HI>copula,</HI> are alone sufficient to consti∣tute
marriage, without necessity of the minister's
blessing, or of any other solemnity. And what
probably has paved the way to that opinion, is,
that among Protestants marriage is not held to be
a sacrament; from which it has rashly been infer∣red,
<PB N="34" REF="47"/>
that there is no necessity for a minister.
But that this is an erroneous opinion, will appear
from the following consideration. If a promise
of itself be not effectual, the subsequent <HI>copula,</HI>
an unlawful act, can never be considered as a le∣gal
solemnity, sufficient to complete the marriage.
The <HI>copula</HI> cannot regularly have any other ef∣fect
than to bar repentance; and consequently to
oblige the party refractory to perform the promise.
Nor is this opinion consistent with the spirit of
law in any civilized country concerning marriage.
Marriage produces many important consequen∣ces.
It ascertains the condition of the married
couple, of their children, and of the right these
children have to succeed to their relations. It
may have an effect with respect to the succession
to the crown itself, the most important question
of all that concern civil society. Our law, for
these reasons, dissatisfied with the private solem∣nity
of carrying the bride to the bridegroom's
house accompanied with her friends, though a
public act, required the solemnity to be performed
by proclamation of bans, and by mutual consent
given <HI>in facie ecclesiae</HI> before the priest, and
completed with his blessing. Now, to hold a
promise of marriage, <HI>cum copula,</HI> two acts of the
most private nature, and most uncertain proof,
to be equal to a marriage regularly solemnized, is
to overturn the whole system of our law with re∣gard
to marriage, and to render it much more
<PB N="35" REF="48"/>
uncertain, than even the <HI>inductio in domum ma∣riti.</HI>
The pernicious effects of this opinion reach
still farther. For at that rate, the most solemn
marriage will not secure a woman even of the
highest rank, nor her children: a low woman
appears, who succeeds in proving a promise <HI>cum
copula</HI> by witnesses of her own rank, perhaps en∣gaged
privately to partake of the spoil. What
a dismal scene does this produce!</P>
<P>The proclamation of bans proves, to my con∣viction,
that a promise <HI>cum copula</HI> makes not an
actual marriage. The intention of proclamation
is, to invite people to forbid the bans, if they
have any legal objection. A promise of marriage
will not intitle one to forbid the bans, because of
<HI>locus poenitentiae;</HI> and if a promise with <HI>copula</HI>
make an actual marriage, the woman's failure to
appear at the proclamation, to claim the man as
her husband, and to forbid the bans with another
woman, will not annul her marriage. At that rate
proclamation is of no use. An additional argument
may be drawn from the above-mentioned act of
parliament. Cohabitation as man and wife
makes not a marriage; but only infers, that the
marriage was regularly solemnized, unless the
contrary be proved. To disprove the marriage,
there is always access to the oath of party; and
consequently, by that statute, cohabitation is not
sufficient without the established solemnity. But
a promise <HI>cum copula</HI> can never be stronger than
<PB N="36" REF="49"/>
cohabitation as man and wife, which is a mutual
acknowledgement of marriage <HI>robus et factis,</HI>
and often by express words. This is at least e∣quivalent
to a promise: the <HI>copula</HI> is presumed
from cohabitation; and if there be children, is
certain.</P>
<P>It would appear from a case observed by Du∣rie
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Craig <HI>contra</HI> Sinclair, 16th December 1628.</NOTE>, that even a decree of the commissaries is
not sufficient to complete the marriage. Mar∣garet
Craig having obtained a decree of the com∣missaries
of Edinburgh against Oliver Sinclair, to
complete the band of marriage with her before
the face of Holy Kirk, he gave bond to solem∣nize
the marriage within a day specified, and, in
case of failure, to pay her 500 merks. This
bond being put in suit, it was alledged for Oli∣ver,
that by the decree he was the pursuer's hus∣band,
and that she could not have action against
her own husband. This alledgeance was repel∣led,
because till the marriage should be solemni∣zed,
he was not actually her husband. This
judgement was agreeable to the decree of the
commissaries decerning the man to solemnize the
marriage. But as it is not in the power of any
judge to force the will, I should imagine, that a
decree obliging the parties to solemnize, and up∣on
failure, that the marriage should be declared
complete, would make an actual marriage.
<PB N="37" REF="50"/>
However that be, the decision shews the sense of
the nation at that time, that a promise <HI>cum co∣pula</HI>
is not equivalent to an actual marriage.</P>
<P>I conclude this article with a remarkable deci∣sion,
15th December 1752, Alison Pennycook
<HI>contra</HI> John Grinton and Anne Graite, which is
as follows. In February 1748, Alison Penny∣cook
brought a process before the commissaries
of Edinburgh, against John Grinton, setting
forth, That she had born a child to him under
promise of marriage; and concluding for main∣tenance
of the child, and for L. 100 Sterling of
damages for his debauching and leaving her.
The libel being referred to his oath, he acknow∣ledged
the child, and his promise of marriage
before he had carnal dealing with the pursuer.
The process was discontinued till January 1751;
during which interval, John Grinton, finding that
the pursuer had damages only in view, thought
himself at liberty to propose marriage to Anne
Graite; and she and her father having agreed to
the proposal, the marriage was solemnized open∣ly,
but without proclamation of bans. There
was a meeting of friends, a marriage-dinner, and
a formal bedding: the new-married couple went
publicly to church in that quality, continued to
cohabit as husband and wife, in the neighbour∣hood
of Alison Pennycook, without any challenge
from her; and a child was procreated of the mar∣riage.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="51"/>
This moved Alison Pennycook to vary her at∣tack.
Deserting her depending process, she, in
January 1751, brought a new process before the
commissary-court, libelling upon the promise and
<HI>copula;</HI> subsuming, That, notwithstanding thereof,
John Grinton had not only deserted her, but had
committed adultery publicly with another woman;
and therefore concluding, that John Grinton
and she should be declared married persons, and
the child procreated betwixt them a lawful child;
also concluding, that because of his notour adul∣tery,
she should be divorced, and intitled to all
the privileges of a widow, as if he were naturally
dead. In this process, the commissaries found
it proved by the defendant's oath, mentioned a∣bove,
that he had carnal dealings with her under
promise of marriage, and that he had a child by
her: therefore found the marriage proved; de∣clared
the defendant and pursuer husband and
wife, and the child a lawful child. But as to the
conclusion of divorce, they permitted the pursuer,
before answer, to prove the facts and circumstan∣ces
libelled for inferring the same. This process,
with a counter process, at the instance of Anne
Graite, for declaring her marriage with John
Grinton, being brought before the court of ses∣sion
by advocation, it was pleaded for John Grin∣ton
and Anne Graite, that a promise <HI>cum copu∣la</HI>
may, <HI>rebus integris,</HI> found an action to oblige
the party to complete the marriage; but is not
<PB N="39" REF="52"/>
an actual marriage, to void a subsequent mar∣riage
lawfully contracted. The judges were al∣most
unanimous, that a promise <HI>cum copula</HI>
makes a complete marriage; and therefore they
repelled the reason of advocation, and remitted
the cause.</P>
<P>As John Grinton's marriage with Anne Graite
was so far clandestine as that it proceeded with∣out
proclamation of bans, it deserves considera∣tion,
what weight ought to be laid on the omis∣sion
of that solemnity. Had the bans been pro∣claimed,
the pursuer ought to have appeared to
forbid the bans. And supposing her not to have
appeared, the marriage, in my apprehension,
must have been unexceptionable. But since there
was no proclamation of bans to give the pur∣suer
opportunity to appear for her interest, it
may be justly doubted, whether her claim did
not remain entire to operate a dissolution of the
subsequent clandestine marriage, and to compel
John Grinton to solemnize the marriage with
her. I am verily persuaded, that this particular
had weight with the judges, though it entered
not into their reasoning, nor is expressed in the
judgement. If a case of this kind be brought a∣gain
before the court, where the bans have been
regularly proclaimed, and every other solemnity
used, I cannot allow myself to think, that the
judges would be so harsh, as to void the mar∣riage
upon no better ground than a promise of
marriage to another woman <HI>cum copula.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ART. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Provision of conquest in a contract of
marriage.</HEAD>
<P>WHere a man is possessed of an estate suffi∣cient
for providing his wife and children,
there is no occasion for a provision of conquest.
But men of business often marry upon the faith
of future acquisitions, and upon these the wife
depends for a provision to herself and to her is∣sue.
There, a provision of conquest is necessary;
and for that reason, extremely favourable. Some
contracts of marriage have a mixture of both,
as where a man provides the small stock he hath
to his wife or children, and also his future ac∣quisitions.</P>
<P>A subject is not termed conquest merely for
having been purchased during marriage. No∣thing
is held to be conquest, but what is an ac∣cession
to a man's fortune, making him <HI>locuple∣tior.</HI>
A subject purchased with money acquired
by industry or economy, is in the true sense con∣quest.
But land, or any other subject, purchased
with borrowed money, is not conquest; except
as far as the subject may be of greater value than
the price paid for it.</P>
<P>This being the true notion of conquest, even
<PB N="41" REF="54"/>
in the common sense of mankind, it follows, 1st,
That whatever subjects a man may acquire du∣ring
a marriage, yet these are only held to be
conquest as far as they exceed in value what the
man was possessed of at the date of the contract<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Stair, b. 3. tit. 5. § 52.</NOTE>.
2d. They are only held to be conquest, as far as
they exceed in value the debts which the purcha∣ser
found it necessary to contract in order to pay
the price<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stair, ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having settled the meaning of conquest in ge∣neral,
the first particular I begin with is, the im∣port
of the different clauses in common use;
some more extensive, some less, according to a∣greement.
And with respect to every provision
of this sort, one negative rule holds, That being
partly calculated to excite the wife's frugality
and industry, it is not extended to what devolves
on the husband by succession, unless so express∣ed
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stair, 29th January 1678, Stuarts <HI>contra</HI> Stuart; July 1730, Mercer <HI>contra</HI> Mercer.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>What subjects are comprehended under a
clause of conquest, depends on the will of par∣ties,
signified by the words of the clause. A
provision to a wife, “of the liferent of all lands
and annualrents to be conquest during the
marriage,” was found to comprehend a bond
<PB N="42" REF="55"/>
bearing interest, though having no clause for in∣feftment
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dury, 20th February 1629, Douglas.</NOTE>. At that time bonds bearing inte∣rest
were held to be <HI>feoda pecuniae,</HI> and conse∣quently
a sort of annualrent-right. But after
such bonds were rendered moveable by statute,
the court gave a different opinion. A liferent
provided to the wife, “of what lands, teinds,
and annualrents, should be conquest during the
marriage,” was not extended to moveable
bonds bearing interest<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Harcarse, Decis. 342.</NOTE>. But a liferent provi∣ded
to a wife, “of a third part of all lands and
heritages that should be conquest during the
marriage,” was extended to a bond seciuding ex∣ecutors,
as being heritage<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Harcarse, Decis. 343.</NOTE>. A liferent provided
to the wife, “of all lands, annualrents, goods, and
gear, that should be conquest during the mar∣riage,”
was not extended to moveable bonds<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Stair, 15th July 1673, Robison <HI>contra</HI> Robison.</NOTE>.
A provision, “of all goods and gear to be con∣quest
during the marriage, to the children that
should be procreated of that marriage,” was
not extended to houses, because lands and heri∣tages
were not mentioned<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 5th February 1696, Young <HI>contra</HI> Young.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A man bound by contract of marriage to in∣feft
<PB N="43" REF="56"/>
his wife in all future conquests, acquired land
holding burgage, which, by acts of the town,
could only be enjoyed by burgesses, and their
heirs-male. It was decreed, that his heir-male
should make good to her the rents for her life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hadington, 14th March 1623, Skene <HI>contra</HI> Forbes.</NOTE>.
For the land was undoubtedly conquest; and
though she was barred from possessing the land,
there was nothing to bar her from possessing the
rents.</P>
<P>When we consider a clause of conquest with
respect to its import, it is not sufficient to say,
that such and such subjects are comprehended in
it: we must also be able to say, that these sub∣jects
were acquired during the marriage. This
point is sometimes doubtful; as where a pur∣chase,
inchoated before the marriage, is comple∣ted
during it. It is not easy to give a general
rule, for determining a point frequently involved
in circumstances. Questions of this nature com∣monly
occur about land, to which there are ti∣tles
of different kinds. All I can say in general
is, that acquisition of the sovereign title of pro∣perty,
is the determining circumstance. If that
was in the husband before the marriage, the ac∣quisition
of collateral or inferior rights during the
marriage, will not be reputed conquest. And
the property will be reputed conquest, if it be
acquired during the marriage, whatever collate∣ral
<PB N="44" REF="57"/>
or inferior rights were formerly in the hus∣band.
Thus, a provision to the heirs of a se∣cond
marriage, “of lands that should be acquired
during the marriage,” was not extended to
land to which the husband had a title of proper∣ty
before the marriage; though several collateral
rights were purchased during the marriage. For
even supposing these to be preferable titles, yet
the parties certainly did not intend to bring un∣der
such a clause any land to which the husband
had already a title of property. Nor were these
purchases during the marriage brought under
the provision of conquest; because neither could
it be the meaning of parties, to split different
titles to the same subject among near relations,
to produce discord and law-suits among them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harcarse, Decis. 352. See Dury, 30th June 1629, Lady Dunfermline.</NOTE>.
On the other hand, a man, possessed of the life∣rent
of land at the date of his contract, having
afterward made a purchase of the property, the
land, after his death, was decreed to fall under
the provision of conquest<NOTE N="dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 12th December 1707, Fergus <HI>contra</HI> Burrel.</NOTE>. And a man who was
bound to infeft his wife “in all lands and herita∣ges
that should be conquest during the mar∣riage,”
having first acquired tacks of certain
lands, which fell not under the provision, and
afterward the property of the land; the relict
<PB N="45" REF="58"/>
was found intitled to liferent the land. But the
benefit of the tacks was subtracted; because so
far the lands could not be reputed conquest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, 12th March 1628, Lady Dunfermline.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We come next in order to say, with what debts
a provision of conquest is burdened. Supposing
the whole subjects, heritable and moveable, that
shall be conquest during the marriage to be pro∣vided,
this provision must of course be burdened
with all the debts contracted during the marriage.
For, as above laid down, subjects acquired du∣ring
the marriage, are only held to be conquest,
as far as the purchaser is thereby <HI>locupletior;</HI>
and he is not <HI>locupletior,</HI> if he have contracted
debt for paying the price. But supposing the
subjects acquired during the marriage to be suffi∣cient
for all the debts contracted during that pe∣riod,
a provision of heritable subjects will only
be burdened with heritable debts, and a provision
of moveable subjects, with moveable debts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stair, 23d December 1668, Smith <HI>contra</HI> Muir.</NOTE>. If
there be no separate fund for paying the debts, the
provision, were it even of land only, must be bur∣dened
with the whole; for, as observed, nothing
is held to be conquest, but what is free after pay∣ment
of debts.</P>
<P>To prevent mistakes, I must observe, that the
debts I am talking of, are those only where the
money has been applied for making purchases
<PB N="46" REF="59"/>
during the marriage. If a debt be contracted,
and the money be gifted to a relation or friend,
this debt cannot burden a provision of conquest,
if the debtor have any other funds for payment.
Or if, during a second marriage the conquest of
which is provided to the wife or children, the
husband contract debt, and apply the money for
purging incumbrances upon his estate descendible
to the heir of the first marriage, the provision
will not be burdened with that debt. The reason
is, that the subjects falling under the provision,
having been acquired without the aid of this con∣traction,
make a real accession to the man's e∣state;
and are therefore properly conquest. Nor
is there any reason for burdening a provision
with a debt that has not contributed to the ac∣quisition
of the subjects provided.</P>
<P>Where the whole moveables are provided, or
the whole heritable subjects, there can be no dif∣ficulty
about the debts. The provision must be
burdened with debts of its own kind. But what
if a single species only be provided, such as lands,
or bonded debts? The provision, as appears to
me, must be burdened with a proportion only of
the debts. If land for example that shall be
conquest, be provided to the wife in liferent, or
the children in fee; and, at the dissolution of the
marriage, there be not only land, but also heri∣table
bonds; the whole heritable debts must not
be laid upon the land: the other heritable sub∣jects
<PB N="47" REF="60"/>
must bear a proportion. The like when
moveable bonds only are provided: the other
moveables must contribute to pay the moveable
debts.</P>
<P>There is a specialty with respect to a provision
of land. Land acquired during the marriage,
must pass to the wife or children <HI>cum suo onere;</HI>
that is, with the burden of heritable bonds secu∣red
upon it. The wife, provided to the liferent,
must pay the interest; and the children, provi∣ded
to the fee, must pay the principal; without
being intitled to any relief out of the other heri∣table
subjects that have been acquired during the
marriage. The court has gone farther in some
instances: it has found, that land purchased du∣ring
a marriage, must be burdened with what
part of the price remains still due to the vender,
though due by a moveable bond, but specifying
the sum to be part of the price<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, 24th January 1629, Lady Renton; Stair, 20th December 1665, Lady Kilbucho.</NOTE>. It has proba∣bly
been thought, that the land could not be en∣tirely
conquest, while any part of the price re∣mained
unpaid. But this, I think, is too strict.
Supposing the land to be the only subject purcha∣sed
during the marriage, it must no doubt be
burdened, not only with what remains due of the
price, but also with all the other debts. But sup∣posing
other subjects to have been acquired beside
the land, I discover no good reason for laying the
<PB N="48" REF="61"/>
price entirely upon the land. Let it be supposed,
that the husband, soon after the marriage, being
tempted with a beneficial purchase of land, bor∣rows
money to buy it. Being engaged in profit∣able
business, he afterward buys houses, obtains
adjudications, and lends sums upon personal
bonds. Dying in this condition, it must be ad∣mitted,
that the land he acquired is, in the strict∣est
sense, conquest. I am therefore inclined to
think, that the moveable subjects ought, in the
first place, to be applied for paying the price as
a moveable debt; and if these be not sufficient,
that the remainder of the debt be allocated pro∣portionally
upon the land, and upon the other
heritable subjects.</P>
<P>The point of the greatest intricacy, is, How far
the granter is limited in the exercise of his pro∣perty
by a provision of conquest. As to this
point, special regard must be had to the intention
of the parties. A provision of what shall be
acquired during a marriage, to a wife in liferent,
or to children in fee, will not readily be so inter∣preted,
as to deprive the man of his inherent
power, <HI>qua</HI> proprietor, to manage and dispose of
his effects. If he lend money during the mar∣riage,
he may take payment; and if he buy a
horse, or even land, he may dispose of it: a pro∣vision
of conquest will be no impediment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Stair, b. 3. tit. 5. § 52.; Durie, 26th Novem∣ber 1629, Lady Dunfermline.</NOTE>. For,
<PB N="49" REF="62"/>
as such provision respects the dissolution of the
marriage, and operates not till the husband's
death, nothing is held conquest but what remains
in his <HI>hereditas jacens.</HI> There is therefore no∣thing
in the nature of such a provision, to pre∣vent
the husband from aliening by a deed <HI>inter
vivos</HI> any subject acquired by him during the
marriage. The common law accordingly admits
no objection to an alienation divesting the granter,
whatever may have been his motive. But were
such alienations to be countenanced without li∣mitation,
a provision of conquest in a marriage∣settlement,
however salutary, would prove a very
slender security. The husband cannot indeed
counteract his engagement directly; but he may
do the equivalent indirectly, by aliening to his fa∣vourites
all that he hath acquired during the
marriage. A court of equity takes more liberty,
in order to fulfil the rules of justice. It will not bar
deeds done in the course of ordinary administra∣tion:
nor will it even bar deeds done without a valu∣able
consideration, provided they be rational, pro∣ceeding
from an honest motive, with no intention
to disappoint the wife and children. To give
more indulgence, would be to suffer the husband
to do wrong with impunity. Common law re∣gards
only the granter's power when he makes a
deed; but equity regards his intention, and
will reduce every deed that proceeds from a frau∣dulent
or unjust motive. When a man acts indi∣rectly
<PB N="50" REF="63"/>
to evade a contract, or a statute, he is said,
in law-language, <HI>fraudem facere contractui aut
legi;</HI> and it is the province of a court of equi∣ty
to void unjust acts. I give examples. A wo∣man
in her contract of marriage being provided
“to the liferent of what subjects the husband
should conquest, and of what sums he should
receive in payment during the marriage,” was
not intitled to the liferent of sums paid to the
husband during the marriage, which were ap∣ply'd
by him for purging incumbrances upon his
estate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harcarse, Decis. 398.</NOTE>. For here the money was not extant at
the dissolution of the marriage; and the appli∣cation
of the money to purge incumbrances was
a rational act, and not a <HI>fraus facta contractui.</HI>
A man who became bound to provide his wife to
the liferent “of all sums that should be conquest
during the marriage,” lends out sums thus ac∣quired,
and takes the debtors bound to pay the

<P>In considering how far a man is limited by a
<PB N="52" REF="65"/>
provision of conquest, I once thought, that his
powers are more limited with regard to his wife,
than with regard to his children; that the wife,
being, in the strictest sense, a creditor, is intitled,
in all events, to have the obligation fulfilled to
her; but that the children, being only heirs of
provision, are not intitled to bar any deeds but
what are fraudulent. But, upon revolving the
subject more attentively, there appears no ground
for a difference. A provision of conquest intitles
the widow to every subject falling under the pro∣vision
that belonged to the husband at the dissolu∣tion
of the marriage. But with respect to sub∣jects
acquired, and aliened by him, during the
marriage; these, in terms of the provision, fall
not under conquest; and therefore she has no
title to challenge any alienation of that kind, un∣less
she can qualify it to be fraudulent; and the
children evidently have the same privilege. Per∣haps
it may be thought shallow, ever to have en∣tertained
a doubt about this point; but I hazard
the imputation, to prevent others from losing time
in doubting as I did.</P>
<P>A clause of conquest in favour of the wife or
children, limits not the husband with respect to
others. Where the settlement is extended be∣yond

<HEAD>ART. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Seal of Cause.</HEAD>
<P>WHen a village, by a charter from the
crown, is erected into a burgh-royal, a
burgh of regality, or a burgh of barony, the in∣habitants
are <HI>eo ipso</HI> incorporated into a body∣politic,
enjoying all the privileges granted by the
charter; and their right of burgessship is commu∣nicated
to their descendents, with all the privi∣leges
consequent upon it. At the same time,
the increase of the burgh being always in view as
well as its perpetuity, a power is granted in the
charter to the magistrates, to the lord of rega∣lity,
or to the baron, to admit strangers into the
corporation, and to make them burgesses.</P>
<P>As such erections are made for the sake of
commerce, the erecting the inhabitants of a vil∣lage
into a corporation, is understood to imply an
exclusive privilege to the burgesses, of exercising
merchandise and manufactures within the burgh.
The clause commonly is, “That the burgesses
shall have free liberty of commerce; and that
there shall be liberty of admitting bakers, tai∣lors,
shoemakers, &amp;c. with power to the said
artificers to exercise their respective crafts, as
freely as is done in other burghs.” It is ac∣cordingly
<PB N="54" REF="67"/>
laid down in the New Abridgement of
the law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. Corporation, p. 499.</NOTE>, “That a corporation is an artificial
body of men, composed of divers constituent
members, <HI>ad instar corporis humani;</HI> the li∣gaments
of which body-politie, or artificial bo∣dy,
are the franchises and liberties thereof,
which bind and unite all its members together.
And the whole frame and effence of the corpo∣ration
consists therein.”</P>
<P>It is a principle of law, That a corporation, or
body-politic, cannot be created by any but by
the crown. See the book above quoted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. Corporation, p. 501.</NOTE>;
where it is said, “That a corporation created by
the mayor and common council of London,
is not good without the King's charter.” It
is therefore to me clear, that a seal of cause
granted by the magistrates of a royal burgh, by
a lord of regality, or by a baron, to a craft or
trade, the weavers, for example, or the masons,
cannot have the effect of erecting them into a
corporation. Nor do the seals of cause I have per∣used,
appear to have been intended for making
an incorporation. No more is done, but to
delegate to the craft itself, the privilege of
admitting new members; a privilege that the
granters have by the charter of erection; to
impower also the craft to make by-laws; and
to have a box and common good for the use of
<PB N="55" REF="68"/>
their poor. The seal of cause granted 31st of
January 1475, by the magistrates and town-coun∣cil
of Edinburgh, to the weaver-craft, has no
clause erecting them into a corporation. It goes
no farther, than to regulate the common con∣cerns
of the craft, and to bar unfreemen. In the
same strain run the seals of cause granted to the
hammermen, 2d May 1483; to the tailors, 26th
August 1500; to the cordiners, 6th December
1513; and to the goldsmiths, 20th August 1581.
In the seal of cause, <HI>anno</HI> 1505, granted by the
magistrates and town-council of Edinburgh to
the surgeons and barbers, there are no words e∣recting
them into a corporation: a set of by∣laws
proposed by the craft are ratified, and no
more is done. By an act of the town-council of
Edinburgh, the surgeons and apothecaries are e∣rected
into one community. But to supply the
defect of power, the act was confirmed by
Charles II. and ratified in parliament, 22d Au∣gust
1670.</P>
<P>By an act of the same town-council, <HI>anno</HI>
1684, the bonnetmakers and litsters are erected
into one body and incorporation perpetually in all
time coming. If this was intended to create a
legal corporation, it was undoubtedly <HI>ultra vi∣res.</HI>
But probably no more was intended, but
to conjoin two weak crafts into one, in order to
lighten the burden of the common expence.</P>

<HEAD>ART. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Whether the property of goods sold be
transferred to the purchaser by delive∣ry,
though the price be not paid.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Roman law, delivery of the thing sold
presumes not the vender's will to transfer
the property, but only to intitle him to demand
the price; § 41. <HI>Instit. De rerum divisione;
l.</HI> 19. <HI>ff. De contrahenda emptione.</HI> And Vin∣nius,
in his commentary on the Institutes, men∣tions
it to be the opinion of the doctors, that
delivery without receiving the price, will not in∣fer
an intention in the vender to transfer the pro∣perty,
unless evidence be given, that he was
willing to trust the purchaser.</P>
<P>Is this doctrine adopted in our practice? Let
the reader judge for himself. And, first, with
respect to heritable subjects, where delivery is
made by an instrument of feisin, the instrument
infers transference of the property; it being a
rule in our law, That infeftment cannot be qua∣lified
by any presumption, nor with any condition
or provision, but what appears on the face of the
deed.</P>
<P>Next, as to moveables. An agreement to de∣lay
payment of the price to a future time, must
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
be intended for the benefit of the purchaser: but
it would be no benefit, if the use of the subject
were in the interim with-held from him. There∣fore,
where payment is agreed to be delayed, de∣livery
must infer a transference of the property.</P>
<P>Where there is no paction to delay payment,
what if the vender, after delivery, forbear to de∣mand
the price for a considerable time? Such
delay implies, that he was willing to trust the
price till he should have occasion for it; which,
according to what is now said, infers, that he in∣tended
to transfer the property upon delivery.</P>
<P>Where the goods purchased are intended for
immediate use, as corn for seed, delivery can
have no other meaning, but to transfer the pro∣perty;
for the vender cannot mean to retain the
property of a subject that is immediately to be an∣nihilated.</P>
<P>But what shall be said of a sale with delivery,
where the subject is not intended for immediate
use, nor a paction for delay of payment. Can
the vender return next day, or next hour, to de∣mand
the subject as his property, if the price be
not instantly offered? It is natural for the vend∣er
to say on delivery, whether he be willing to
delay payment. Therefore, if he be silent about
what is his own concern, is it not the more natural
construction, that he is willing to transfer the
property, and to delay payment of the price till
<PB N="58" REF="71"/>
he have use for it? This seems to be the proper
construction, even at common law.</P>
<P>But were it a rule at common law, as Vinnius
holds, that delivery, without receiving the price,
will not of itself infer an intention to transfer the
property; yet that rule cannot be admitted in a∣ny
commercial nation, because it would be a
great obstruction to the commerce of moveables.
Suppose a moveable had passed through a hun∣dred
hands, by buying and selling, yet the last
purchaser would lie open to have the subject ta∣ken
from him, if any antecedent purchaser, with∣out
being trusted, had failed to pay the price.
Nor is it any hardship upon the vender that deli∣very
should infer a transference of the property;
for if he be not willing to trust the price, let him
hold the subject till he obtain payment.</P>
<P>Attending to the foregoing reasoning, Lord
Stair appears to be well founded in the following
proposition, laid down by him, tit. Sale, § 2.
“Sale being perfected, and the thing delivered,
the property thereof becomes the buyer's;
and there is no dependence of it till the price
be paid, or secured, as was in the Civil law;
neither hypothecation of it for the price.”</P>

<HEAD>ART. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Division of rent between the fiar and re∣presentatives
of a liferenter, and be∣tween
the heir and executors of a land∣proprietor.</HEAD>
<P>REnts originally were paid in kind. A grass-farm
paid cattle, butter, cheese: a corn-farm
paid wheat, barley, oats. A grass-farm
yields daily profit: the rent however is made
payable at Whitsunday and Martinmas; because
more frequent payments would be troublesome to
the landlord as well as to the tenant. A corn-farm
yields no profit till the corns be reaped; and
therefore the rent, when paid in kind, cannot be
exacted before Martinmas.</P>
<P>When gold and silver came to be so plentiful
as to enable a tenant to pay money-rent, it was
natural to stipulate, that the rent of a corn-farm
should be paid at Whitsunday and Martinmas, as
the rent of a grass-farm had always been. And
thus, Whitsunday and Martinmas, coming to be
the ordinary terms of paying rent, were deno∣minated
the <HI>legal terms.</HI> But as money-rent ad∣mits
any terms of payment as parties can agree,
it came to be frequent in leases o stipulate rent
<PB N="60" REF="73"/>
at the commencement of the lease, before the te∣nant
could reap any profit, termed <HI>fore-hand
rent,</HI> and sometimes long after the crop was
reaped, termed <HI>back-hand rent.</HI> And in oppo∣sition
to the legal terms, such terms of payment
obtained the name of <HI>conventional terms.</HI></P>
<P>Where a yearly annuity is paid to a liferenter,
or to any person, the annuitant is understood to
be intitled to a proportion daily for subsistence;
though, for the sake of convenience, the sum be
made payable but once or twice a-year. There∣fore,
at whatever time of the year the annuitant
dies, his representatives have right to a part of
the annuity corresponding to the number of days
he lived. A liferenter of land is in a different
state. The possession is yielded to him; and he
acts in every respect as proprietor, granting lea∣ses,
and stipulating certain terms for paying the
rent. Every crop accordingly that arises during
his possession, belongs to him, or to his tenant
who pays rent for it. The terms of payment of that
rent concern the liferenter and his tenant only: the
fiar has no right to any crop while the liferent sub∣sists;
nor consequently to the rent payable for such
crop. Hence, in separating the interest of the life∣renter
from that of the fiar, the determining cir∣cumstance
is, for what crop any particular term's
rent is payable: if the crop come under the life∣renter's
right, the rent due for it belongs to him,
<PB N="61" REF="74"/>
or to his executor, whatever be the term of pay∣ment.
I descend to particulars. Where the rent
of a corn-farm is payable in kind, the liferenter
must survive Martinmas, to give him right to the
rent payable for the preceding crop; and if he
decease before Martinmas, though after Whitsun∣day,
he has no share of that year's rent. If the
rent be payable in money at two terms, the life∣renter
surviving Whitsunday has right to the half∣year's
rent payable by the tenant for his posses∣sion
from the Martinmas preceding. And if he
survive Martinmas, he has also right to the rent
for the tenant's possession from the Whitsunday
preceding. The conventional terms of payment
are not regarded, but for what crop the rent is
payable. See <HI>l.</HI> 58. <HI>De usufructu.</HI></P>
<P>It will appear even at first view, that the divi∣sion
of rent between heir and executor ought not
to be governed by that rule. The liferenter
and fiar have opposite interests, the property of
the latter being confined by that of the former.
The rent payable for any crop that falls under
the liferenter's right, must, after his death, go to
his representatives; for the fiar evidently has no
right. But as to heir and executor, both of them
are representatives of the deceased proprietor;
and with respect to any crop that he survived,
his property cannot be pleaded for the executor
against the heir, more than for the heir against
the executor. By what rule, then, is this divi∣sion
<PB N="62" REF="75"/>
to be determined? The heir succeeds to the
land, and has right to whatever arises out of the
land from the time of his predecessor's death.
The executor, who has no interest in the land,
has no claim to any rent but what fell due during
the predecessor's life. Had that rent been paid
to the predecessor, as it ought to have been, it
would have augmented the moveable estate;
and it is a rule in equity, That what ought to
have been done, bestows the same right as
if it had been done: it will not be left in
the power of a tenant, to prefer the executor,
or the heir, by punctual or dilatory payment.
The rule then is, That no rents belong to the ex∣ecutor
but what were in arrear during the prede∣cessor's
life. Between liferenter and fiar the legal
terms are the rule: but the conventional terms,
between heir and executor.</P>
<P>The latter part of this rule shall be illustrated,
by applying it to a particular case. A tenant en∣tering
at Whitsunday 1758, agrees to pay a year's
rent per advance, being for the corn-crop 1759.
The landlord dies a few days after Whitsunday,
and the question is, Whether the year's rent pay∣able
at that term, goes to the heir or executor?
The heir has the plea of property, as the proper∣ty
was his during the growth of crop 1759.
But the plea of property does not rule between
the heir and executor. The rent in question was
an arrear at the landlord's death: had it been
<PB N="63" REF="76"/>
paid, it would have gone to the executor; and
what ought to have been done, is held in equity
as done. Were the plea of property to have a∣ny
effect here, it would have a more extensive
effect than any lawyer will admit. It would
make the executor accountable to the heir for
the rent under consideration, supposing it even
to have been received by the predecessor: it is
the rent of crop 1759, and that crop falls under
the heir's property, &amp;c. Take an opposite case.
The tenant enters to a corn-farm at Whitsunday
1758; and for the crop 1759 pays the rent at
Candlemas and Lammas 1760. The landlord
survives Martinmas 1759, but dies before Candle∣mas
1760. He died, it is true, proprietor of the
crop 1759; but that circumstance benefits not
the executor, who has no claim but to arrears.
And therefore the whole rent payable for crop 1759
belongs to the heir.</P>
<P>With respect to the division of rent between
the fiar and representatives of a liferenter who is
a localist, the rule above laid down is adopted
in our practice. Far otherwise between the heir
and executor; for the rule that justly obtains
between the former, is erroneously applied be∣tween
the latter. If the predecessor survive
Whitsunday, his executor, by our present prac∣tice,
has right to the half of the rent payable for
the crop of that year; and to the whole, if the
predecessor survive Martinmas. This is to be re∣gretted;
<PB N="64" REF="77"/>
because, instead of a rule agreeable to
principles, and easy in the application, one is
substituted, not only erroneous, but intricate.</P>
<P>What it is that has betrayed our lawyers into
this error, may deserve inquiry. One thing we
know, that formerly the rent was payable at
Whitsunday and Martinmas, each for the posses∣sion
of the half-year preceding. While this con∣tinued
to be the custom, the executors drew the
Whitsunday rent when the predecessor survived
that term, and the whole year's rent when the
predecessor survived Martinmas. And thus, as
the conventional and legal terms coincided, it
was the same to hold that the conventional terms
were the rule, or to hold that Whitsunday and
Martinmas were the rule. But mark the conse∣quence.
Had the proposition been expressed
in the former manner, the conventional terms
would have continued to be the rule, as they
ought to be. But the latter expression happening
to be adopted, Whitsunday and Martinmas un∣warily
continued to be the rule, after ceasing to
be the conventional terms. And what mainly
contributed to the illusion, was the case of life∣renter
and fiar, where Whitsunday and Martinmas
are the just rule, without regard to the conventional
terms. Thus, in contradistinction to the conven∣tional
terms, Whitsunday and Martinmas are call∣ed
<HI>legal terms,</HI> because they are made the rule
<PB N="65" REF="78"/>
for dividing rents between heir and executor, as
well as between fiar and liferenter.</P>
<P>To intitle the executor to rents that were not
due at the death of the predecessor, admits
scarcely of an excuse, when it is considered, that
a lease of land is a proper example of a right
having <HI>tractum futuri temporis,</HI> which invaria∣bly
descends to the heir; except with regard to
such portions as became due during the predeces∣sor's
life.</P>
<P>But to whatever objections the rule may lie o∣pen,
as regarding heir and executor, it is how∣ever
adopted in practice, and must be submitted
to. I therefore proceed to illustrate it by ex∣amples.
In a corn-farm, the tenant enters at
Martinmas 1758, or at the separation of the crop
from the ground. The first half of the year's
rent is made payable at Martinmas 1759, and
the other half at Whitsunday 1760, being both
for crop 1759. If the proprietor survive Whit∣sunday
1759, the rent payable at Martinmas
1759 will make part of his moveable estate; and
if he survive Martinmas 1759, the rent payable
at Whitsunday 1760 will also make part. And
though payment of the rent be postponed to
Candlemas and Lammas 1760, or to any later
terms, the division is the same as if made pay∣able
at Martinmas 1759 and Whitsunday 1760;
or even made payable at Whitsunday and Martin∣mas
1759: for whatever the conventional terms
<PB N="66" REF="79"/>
be, the rents are payable for crop 1759. Sup∣pose
again a tenant, who enters to a corn-farm
at Martinmas 1758, is taken bound by the lease
to pay the first half of his year's rent at Candle∣mas
1759, and the other half at the following
Whitsundy. These rents being payable before∣hand
for crop 1759, it follows from the common
rule, that if the landlord die before Whitsunday,
his executor will draw none of the rent for that
crop; not even the half payable at Candlemas
1759, supposing it to be outstanding. Here the
common practice contradicts most direcly the
rule of equity above mentioned, That what ought
to be done, is held as done. If the landlord sur∣vive
Candlemas, which is here supposed, the rent
payable at that term ought to be considered as
received by him, and as making part of his
moveable estate. Let it be next supposed in the
case figured, that the landlord dies between
Whitsunday and Martinmas 1759, his executor,
by the rule in practice, would have no right to
the rent payable at Whitsunday, though due be∣fore
the landlord's death, which is equally ab∣surd.</P>
<P>Where the tenant enters at Martinmas, the di∣vision
of rent between heir and executor will be
the same, whether it be a corn-farm or a grass∣farm.
The first half of the year's rent, at what∣ever
time payable, is due for the tenant's posses∣sion
from his entry to the next Whitsunday; and
<PB N="67" REF="80"/>
consequently it will belong to the executor, if the
landlord survive that term, both in a corn-farm
and grass-farm. But the result will be different
where the tenant's entry is at Whitsunday; which
now prevails in corn-farms in order that the new
tenant may prepare for a crop of oats, by folding
his cattle, and for a crop of wheat, by a summer∣fallow.
A tenant then enters to a corn-farm at
Whitsunday 1758, and is bound by his lease to
pay his rent at Canlemas and Lammas 1760.
The rent being for the crop 1759, belongs whol∣ly
to the heir, if the predecessor die before
Whitsunday 1759; divides between the heir and
executor, if the predecessor die between Whit∣sunday
and Martinmas 1759; and belongs whol∣ly
to the executor, if the predecessor die after
Martinmas 1759. But supposing the same entry
in a grass-farm, and the same terms of payment;
the rent will be understood as payable for the
year's possession from Whitsunday 1758 to Whit∣sunday
1759; consequently, if the landlord sur∣vive
Martinmas 1758, his executor will have the
half-year's rent payable at Candlemas 1760; and
also the other half payable Lammas 1760, if the
landlord survive Whitsunday 1759.</P>
<P>In one case I find it determined, that as the
whole product of a grass-farm, in cheese, wool,
lamb, &amp;c. arises during summer, the year's rent
must be understood as due for the possession from
Whitsunday to Martinmas; and therefore the te∣nant's
<PB N="68" REF="81"/>
entry being at Whitsunday, and the rent
payable at Martinmas and Whitsunday follow∣ing,
that the whole must belong to the executor
where the landlord survived Martinmas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">February 1727, Sir William Johnston <HI>contra</HI> Mar∣quis of Annandale.</NOTE>. The
fixing Whitsunday to the 15th day of May old
style, was probably the occasion of this judge∣ment;
for it makes the summer's possession much
more profitable than that of the winter. But as
this innovation was certainly not intended to make
any alteration in the division of rent between heir
and executor, the common rule was adhered to
in a similar case, lately under consideration; which
is as follows. In a grass-farm, the tenant, whose
entry was at Whitsunday, became bound to pay
the first half of his rent at Martinmas after his
entry, “for the half-year immediately preceding,”
as expressed in the lease, and the remainder at
the next Whitsunday, “in full of the first year's
rent.” The landlord died in February, and
the last half of the year's rent payable at the en∣suing
Whitsunday, was decreed to belong to the
heir<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">14th December 1759, Turnbull <HI>contra</HI> Ker of Hose∣law.</NOTE>. For here, both from the nature of the
subject set in lease, and from the express words of
the lease, the last half of the rent made payable at
Whitsunday, was from the preceding possession
from Martinmas to Whitsunday; and therefore the
<PB N="69" REF="82"/>
landlord having died before Whitsunday, his exe∣cutor
was not intitled to the rent payable at that
term. This interlocutor however was not adhe∣red
to; it was altered, 2d July 1760, by the nar∣rowest
plurality, in favour of the executor. The
judges who voted for the alteration, influenced
by the case first mentioned, were of opinion, that
the whole year's rent was for the summer's posses∣sion,
and that the winter's possession goes for no∣thing;
an opinion repugnant to the terms of the
lease, as well as to the nature of the subject leased.</P>

And consequently, where rent is paid in kind, he
can force payment by a <HI>rei vindicatio</HI> against eve∣ry
one who meddles with the crop, not excepting
a purchaser for a valuable consideration. The te∣nant,
it is true, has by paction right to what re∣mains
of the crop, after making good the land∣lord's
rent; but till that be done, he has not
right to a single sheaf. This <HI>rei vindicatio,</HI> found∣ed
evidently on the landlord being proprietor of
the corn, is erroneously considered as a hypothec
upon the effects of his tenant.</P>
<P>The crop being the landlord's property, and
continuing to be his property till he draw his
rent out of it, it is evident, that he is not intitled
to draw the rent of one crop out of any other
crop. To obtain preference for the rent of any
crop upon any subsequent crop, the landlord
must do diligence; and he will not be preferred
<PB N="71" REF="84"/>
before any other creditor, but according to his
diligence.</P>
<P>Plenty of money has introduced money-rent;
which implies a transference of the crop from the
landlord to his tenant. A landlord whose rent is
payable in money, has no claim to any part of
the product: on the contrary, the product must
be at the disposal of the tenant, in order to raise
money for paying the rent. And therefore, the
security which the landlord has for his money∣rent,
cannot be other than a hypothec in a pro∣per
sense. If it be demanded, upon what authori∣ty
is this hypothec founded, I answer, upon con∣suetude.
And it is not difficult to explain what
gave a beginning to the consuetude. Our fore∣fathers,
far from being sharp-sighted in law-dis∣tinctions,
did not advert to the consequences of
converting corn-rent into money. A real action,
at the instance of the landlord against a purchaser
of the crop, was familiar in the case of corn-rent;
and the same action was blindly sustained for sup∣porting
the claim of money-rent, though the crop
was no longer the landlord's property. It is far
however from my intention to condemn this hy∣pothec,
though introduced by a blunder. It is
expedient and proper, that security should be
provided to the landlord upon the product of
his own land, for making his money-rent effec∣tual.</P>
<P>While rents were payable in kind, there could
<PB N="72" REF="85"/>
be no occasion for hypothecating the cattle of a
corn-farm. But when money came to be stipu∣lated
for rent instead of corn, it was natural to
secure the payment by a hypothec on the cattle
as well as on the corn.</P>
<P>Cattle pasturing on a farm are not more con∣nected
with the rent of one year, than with that
of another; and for that reason they remain suc∣cessively
hypothecated for the rent of every year.
But though the hypothec on corn, with respect
to money-rent, be precisely of the same nature
with that on cattle, yet it is sustained for the rent
only of that precise year of which it is the pro∣duct.
It was so originally when rent was pay∣able
in kind; and our forefathers have inadvert∣ently
apply'd the same rule to the hypothec of
corn for money-rent, though in its nature very
different. After the rent for crop 1759 becomes
due, there happen to be in the yard some corns
of the preceding crop: the landlord cannot claim
these as hypothecated for the rent 1759. This
rule proves extremely inconvenient both in fore∣hand
rent, and in rent payable long after separa∣tion
of the crop from the ground. In the for∣mer,
it is of little or no use to the landlord; and
in the latter, it is oppressive to the tenant, and
sometimes highly oppressive. The first example
I shall give is, where the tenant entering at Mar∣tinmas
1758, pays at his entry a year's rent for
his expected possession of crop 1759. Every
<PB N="73" REF="86"/>
year's rent being thus payable a complete year
beforehand, the landlord cannot use his hypo∣thec
for a year after his rent becomes due. This
however is but a trifling inconvenience, compa∣red
with what the tenant suffers where the terms
of payment are late. The example I shall give is
common. A tenant enters to a corn-farm at
Whitsunday 1758; and for the crop 1759 he pays
the rent at Candlemas and Lammas 1760. If
the crop 1759 be hypothecated for that rent only,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t follows, that at Candlemas 1760, the tenant
must have as much of the crop on hand as to sa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isfy
a year's rent; and as much even at Lam∣mas
as to satisfy half a year's rent. A hardship
more intolerable cannot well be figured: it is by
the sale of corn that the tenant procures money
for paying his rent; and yet the hypothec so in∣terpreted,
instead of promoting payment, is the
very thing that retards it. Consider the thing in
a different view. Late terms of payment are in∣tended
to favour the tenant, that he may have
full time to procure money for paying his rent;
and yet, according to the effect given to the hy∣pothec,
he gets not a moment's delay; or, which
comes to the same, he has no benefit by the de∣lay.</P>
<P>I would not however be understood to plead
for a hypothec on corn, equally permanent with
that on cattle. After the year's rent becomes
due, the landlord has three months for making
<PB N="74" REF="87"/>
the hypothec upon the cattle effectual<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">January 1726, Hepburn <HI>contra</HI> Richardson.</NOTE>; and af∣ter
that year's rent is satisfied, the hypothec up∣on
the cattle commences for the next year's rent.
Nor is there any inconvenience in these successive
hypothecs; because the same horses, horned
cattle, and even sheep, continue upon the land
for years. A corn-crop is in a very different
condition. It suffers by keeping; and, reserving
what is sufficient for maintaining the family, the
only use of the remainder is to convert it into
money for paying the rent. And yet, to hypo∣thecate
the same corn successively for the rent of
different years, would be pernicious equally to
the landlord and to his tenant, by preventing the
latter from paying any rent. Nor is a security
so heteroclete necessary in any degree. Crops of
corn are renewed every year; and with respect
to any single crop, it is sufficient that it be hypo∣thecated
for the rent of a single year; a new
crop will succeed, to be a security for the next
year's rent. And if corn is to be hypothecated
for a single year's rent only, it ought to be the
half-year's rent that is current when the corns are
reaped, and the half-year's rent immediately pre∣ceding.
By that plan, the hypothec is as little
oppressive as possible to the tenant; and no less
beneficial to the landlord, than if any other year's
rent were secured by it.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="88"/>
The hypothec under consideration, whether
affecting corn or cattle, is, in its nature, so sin∣gular,
as to create a doubt, whether such a legal
conception of it can be formed, as to account
for all its avowed consequences. It is admitted,
that a hypothec upon the cattle, bars not the te∣nant
from aliening any particular horse, ox, or
sheep, or even quantities of them; provided suf∣ficiency
be left for the hypothec. It follows clear∣ly,
that no individual is hypothecated; and yet,
upon that supposition, it is difficult to conceive
that the whole flock or herd can be hypothecated.
To avoid that difficulty, one is led to think, that
there is no hypothec here in a proper sense; but
only a preference given to the landlord before the
tenant's other creditors, not as having any real
right, but upon equitable considerations; a pre∣ference
<HI>inter chirographarios,</HI> as termed in the
Roman law. But in avoiding <HI>Scylla,</HI> we are
driven upon <HI>Charibdis.</HI> If the hypothec be re∣duced
to a preference <HI>inter chirographarios,</HI> it
cannot affect <HI>bona fide</HI> purchasers for a valuable
consideration; which however it does by esta∣blished
practice. In short, this hypothec seems
not easily reducible to just principles.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Dominium directum et utile.</HEAD>
<P>THE superior's right to the land is, in its
nature, unlimited, extending over the whole.
The vassal's right, on the contrary, is in its na∣ture
limited, being in effect a burden on the su∣periority.
Accordingly, when the vassal's right
is by any means annihilated, the superior's pro∣perty,
like air formerly compressed, expands it∣self
over the whole, and becomes unlimited,
precisely as before the vassal's right existed. The
vassal's right, on the contrary, being originally
limited, would not turn more extensive by ex∣tinction
of the superior's property, if such a thing
could be.</P>
<P>From this definition, the following consequen∣ces
are derived. First, A resignation <HI>ad rema∣nentiam,</HI>
or even a simple renunciation, is suffi∣cient
to extinguish the vassal's right, and to ren∣der
the superiority unlimited as originally; be∣cause
a simple renunciation is sufficient to extin∣guish
a real burden, though not to convey it.
But a renunciation by the superior in favour of
the vassal, avails nothing: because property cannot
be extinguished like a real burden; nor can one
<PB N="77" REF="90"/>
divest himself of his property, otherwise than by
conveying it to another.</P>
<P>Second, A discharge to the vassal of the future
casualties of superiority, though good against the
granter, has no effect against a purchaser of the
superiority. The reason is, that these casualities,
being inherent in the superiority, cannot be sepa∣rated
from it. They are in reality so many effects
of the original property reserved to the superior;
feu-duties, for example, liferent-escheat, ward,
nonentry.</P>
<P>This affords a satisfactory reason, why casualties
of superiority are not lost by negative prescription.
Being inherent in the property, they must subsist
with it. And as property is not lost by negative
prescription, neither can these casualties be lost,
except as to arrears.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Clause of Return.</HEAD>
<P>THE nature and import of a clause of return,
seem not to be clearly apprehended.</P>
<P>During the vigour of the Feudal law, every
grant of land was limited to the vassal, and to the
heirs named in the grant. When these were ex∣hausted,
the land returned to the superior.</P>
<P>The feudal system was undermined by degrees,
and land was restored to commerce. The forms
however of that system continued in practice, be∣cause
no other forms were known for conveying
the property of land. And hence a blanch hold∣ing,
which has no relation to the feudal system,
but form merely. The purchaser, though no∣minally
a vassal, is absolute proprietor; and in
that quality transmits the land to his heirs of line,
failing the heirs named in the grant. And even
where the nominal vassal leaves no heirs, the
subject returns not to the superior, but belongs to
the King, as <HI>ultimus haeres.</HI></P>
<P>As this alteration in the feudal system was
not instantaneous, there must have been a pe∣riod,
when some lands were governed by the Feu∣dal
law, and others by common law, excepting
<PB N="79" REF="92"/>
always the form of the title-deeds. The former
were distinguished by the name of <HI>feuda vetera,</HI>
the latter by that of <HI>feuda nova.</HI></P>
<P>During that period, where a proper feudal
grant was intended, consining the grant to the
heirs named in the investiture, a proper clause
to that effect became necessary; otherwise it
must have been uncertain whether a <HI>feudum ve∣tus</HI>
or <HI>novum</HI> was intended. The clause was
termed a <HI>Clause of Return,</HI> bearing, that when
the heirs of the investiture were exhausted, the
land should return to the superior. And hence
it came to be understood, that a grant with∣out
that clause was intended to be a <HI>feudum no∣vum.</HI></P>
<P>This clause is imitated in deeds that have no
relation to the seudal holding; signifying the
granter's intention, that the succession shall not
be altered to his prejudice, but that the subject
shall return to him when the heirs named are ex∣hausted.
Our judges accordingly give that sense
to the clause, in the following case. A bond for
borrowed money was taken by the lender to her∣self
in liferent, and to her son in fee, with the
following provision, “That if her son die with∣out
heirs of his body, the sum shall return to
her, and her heirs.” This clause was found to
imply, that the son could not alien gratuitously;

<HI>contra</HI> Mortimer.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="93"/>
In the decisions of the court of session, differ∣ent
effects are given to these clauses of return
contained in bonds. Sometimes, they are held
equivalent to a clause of return in a feudal hold∣ing,
barring both extraneous heirs and gratui∣tous
assignees. Sometimes, they are held to be
no better than a simple destination of succession.
As questions of will are influenced frequently e∣ven
by minute circumstances, it is not surprising
to find little uniformity in the decisions of the
court with relation to clauses of return. The
nearest approach to uniformity that occurs, is to
distinguish a clause of return that a man pro∣vides
in his own favour, from a clause of return
in favour of another. It is rational to give the
most liberal interpretation to the former, and the
most limited interpretation to the latter. A clause
accordingly of the former sort, will bar both ex∣traneous
heirs, and gratuitous assignees. A clause
of the latter sort will be constructed a simple de∣stination
of succession.</P>
<P>I proceed to examples. In the case above quo∣ted,
College of Edinburgh <HI>contra</HI> Mortimer,
the borrower was indeed the granter of the
bond; but the destination of succession and clause
of return were the operation of the creditor,
with which the debtor had no concern. And as
the clause of return was in favour of the credi∣tor,
the court gave it the most liberal meaning.
The following cases are of the same nature. Part
<PB N="81" REF="94"/>
of the family-estate of Douglas being granted “to
the heir of a second marriage, and the heirs
of his body; which failing, to return to the
right heir of the family of Douglas,” it was
judged, That this estate could not be gratuitous∣ly
aliened in prejudice of the family of Douglas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">18th February 1717, Duke of Douglas <HI>contra</HI> Lock∣hart of Lee.</NOTE>.
A man granted bonds of provision “to his two
daughters, and to the heirs of their bodies;
whom failing, to return to the granter.” The
clause of return here was sustained as a prohibi∣tion
to alien gratuitously<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stair, Fountainhall, 31st January 1679, Drummond <HI>contra</HI> Drummond.</NOTE>. In a bond of provi∣sion,
there being a clause, that if the obligee

granter; and she having died unmarried after as∣signing
the bond gratuitously, the assignment was
reduced<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Home, December 1683, Scot <HI>contra</HI> Scot.</NOTE>. But in a settlement of a family-estate
to a long train of heirs, a clause of return, fail∣ing
these heirs, to the granter, and his other
heirs, is understood to have no other meaning, but
the adding one link more to the chain of heirs;
and therefore will not bar a gratuitous alienation:
witness the following case. A man settled his e∣state
on his son and heir, and the heirs-male of
his body; whom failing, to return to himself.

<P>Next, as to a clause of return in favour of a

alterable at pleasure. Thus, in a bond

<P>WHere these belong to the same titular, the

rules seem not consistent with each other. How∣ever

the rent payable for the corn-crop. Nor is this

Suppose next, the titularities being o∣riginally

<P>IT is agreeable to the principles of justice, that

yet, by adopting a fiction of the Roman law, That

unwarily deviated far from justice, particularly in
subjecting the heir universally to the predecessor's

this day, unless the heir enter <HI>cum beneficio in∣ventarii.</HI>
This subject is discussed at large in
Historical Law-Tracts, tract 13.</P>
<P>Laying regard to justice aside, identity of per∣son
may have a colour in subjects of property,
and in obligations that can be performed by one
person or another indifferently. But as the heir is
in reality a different person from his predecessor,
there are certain things purely personal that he
cannot succeed to, and other things equally per∣sonal
that he cannot be liable to perform. An
attempt to regulate such matters by personal iden∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity,
would not only be unjust, but absurd.
<PB N="85" REF="98"/>
These I propose to handle in the present Article.
I begin with the first; which is, to examine how
far the active representation of an heir extends.</P>
<P>Grotius lays down the following rule, “Heres
personam defuncti refert, non in meritis quae
sunt mere personalia, sed in bonis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De jure belli et pacis, lib. 2. cap. 29. § 19.</NOTE>.” This
rule is obscure; but it may be cleared as follows.
Every thing that can be transferred from one to
another, is said to be <HI>in bonis;</HI> and to such the
heir succeeds. But there are certain things which
cannot be transferred from one to another, and
are extinguished with the person who has them:
these are purely personal, and are not capable of
succession. A man's knowledge, his strength,
and his qualities in general, are buried in the
grave with him. Reparation is due to the man
only who is injured: not to his heir. And even
where money is the only reparation that can be
made, termed <HI>assythment,</HI> the claim, being due
<HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olatium</HI> to the person injured, descends not
to the heir; unless a decree have been obtained for
it by the man himself; for by that decree, it is con∣verted
into a proper debt. But where the prede∣cessor
is intitled to damages against a person who
has burnt his house, or killed his horse, the claim
being founded on property, descends to the heir,
as the subject would have done had it not been
destroyed. And where his predecessor has been
<PB N="86" REF="99"/>
wounded, he is intitled to sue for the expence laid
out on the cure; because so far the subject to
which he succeeds is diminished.</P>
<P>A title of honour cannot be classed under <HI>bona</HI>
or effects; and yet, it is not an objection to the
foregoing doctrine, that the heir succeeds to the
peerage of his predecessor. A peerage is a right
purely personal, and dies with the person who
bears it. The heir assumes it in his own right,
being intitled by the patent, not as representing
his predecessor. It is accordingly established,
that the bearing a title of honour belonging to a
family, is not a passive title subjecting the heir to
the debts of his predecessor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harcarse (Airs), 2d February 1682, Bowar <HI>contra</HI> Earl Marischal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All subjects, moveable and immoveable, de∣scend
to representatives. In no civilized country
are subjects left <HI>in medio</HI> without an owner; and
the heir is the person who naturally succeeds to
what is left by his predecessor. But there are
certain powers and faculties respecting subjects of
inheritance, some of which descend to the heir,
some not; and it seems not an easy task to bring
these under any general rule. Some faculties are
created by law upon considerations purely perso∣nal.
For the peace of families, and to prevent a
married couple from robbing one another by un∣due
influence, the law has bestowed both on hus∣band
and wife, a power of revoking donations
<PB N="87" REF="100"/>
made by the one to the other. But as the mo∣tive
here is purely personal, the power of revoca∣tion
descends not to the heir. The act 1669, re∣quiring
consignation in case of suspending a mini∣ster's
stipend, is privilege personal to the mini∣ster;
nor is there any reason for extending it to
his executors.</P>
<P>With respect to faculties created by will, though
heirs are excluded at common law if not provi∣ded
for in the deed, yet in equity the heir suc∣ceeds
where justice or utility interposes in his be∣half.
A power of demanding back land aliened,
termed <HI>a reversion,</HI> will not descend to heirs, if
not named in the deed; for a perpetual reversion
is a burden upon property too severe to be presu∣med,
where heirs are not mentioned. But sup∣pose,
that a disponer stipulates to himself a re∣version
during a limited time, ten years for ex∣ample,
and dies during that period; will his
heir be privileged to redeem within the ten
years? At common law he is not privileged.
But equity suggests the following distinction:
Where the disposition is gratuitous, it will be pre∣sumed
the will of parties, that the land may be
redeemed at any time within ten years by the
disponer, and failing him, by his heir: but there
is not the same presumption where the land is
disponed for a full price.</P>
<P>Whether obligations created by will go to re∣presentatives
where not named in the deed, must
<PB N="88" REF="101"/>
be ruled by equity. An obligation for a valuable
consideration, goes to representatives, unless they
be expressly excluded: a gratuitous obligation
goes not to representatives, unless they be ex∣pressly
included<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Principles of Equity, book 3. ch. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next as to passive representation. There are
obligations, purely personal, that the heir is not
bound to fulfil, as there are rights, purely per∣sonal,
that descend not to him. No obligation
that requires art or talents to fulfil, burdens the
heir. My predecessor became bound to draw a
picture for a man, to build a house for him, or to
serve him as a soldier: I am not bound.</P>
<P>Punishment is purely personal; for to inflict it
upon any but the guilty, would not answer its
end. Therefore if my predecessor have commit∣ted
a crime, I am not bound to submit to the pu∣nishment.
An heir is not liable even for a pecu∣niary
penalty; unless it have been converted by
a decree into an ordinary debt. The penal pas∣sive
title accordingly of vicious intromission, is
not extended against heirs beyond the value of
the subjects unlawfully taken away<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dirleton, 14th July 1666, Cranston <HI>contra</HI> Wilki∣son; Dirleton, 14th December 1676, Wallace <HI>contra</HI> Murray.</NOTE>. In the
Roman law, litiscontestation with the predecessor,
subjects the heir to every penal action. The rea∣son
is, that litiscontestation was originally a con∣tract,
<PB N="89" REF="102"/>
in which the litigants bound their heirs,
as well as themselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historical Law-tracts, tract 9.</NOTE>; and the heir was bound
by his predecessor's contract, not for his delict.
This rule was preserved alive among the Romans,
by force of custom, after jurisdiction was esta∣blished
upon authority of law, and litiscontesta∣tion
ceased to be a contract; which is one ex∣ample
among many, of effects being supported in
practice, after their causes are gone. But how∣ever
excusable an error may be that is sanctified
by long custom, our lawyers cannot be excused
for adopting the foregoing rule from the Roman
law; seeing that litiscontestation never was held
with us to be a contract<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the same tract.</NOTE>. And if the heir be
bound to sustain a penal action litiscontestated
with his predecessor, he is made liable for his
predecessor's delict; which cannot be justified,
as punishment is strictly personal. Strange! that
this should have been overlooked by our writers
on law; who, all of them, without a single excep∣tion,
adhere to the Roman rule. And no less
strange, that it should be overlooked by our
judges, who currently subject the heir to every
penal action that has been litiscontestated with
the predecessor. Thus, an extracted act of li∣tiscontestation,
and a proof of vicious intromis∣sion
taken against the intromitter himself, were
found sufficient to make his representatives liable

delict. It deserves, at the same time, to be ob∣served,
how prone men are to revolt against e∣stablished
rules that are not founded on just prin∣ciples.
Our judges are always disposed to lay
hold of any pretext, for evading the injustice of
the rule under consideration. Thus, a process
on the passive title of vicious intromission being
insisted on against the intromitter, who deceased
after an act of litiscontestation was pronounced by
the Ordinary, the court refused to transfer the
same against his heir; partly because the act was
not extracted, and partly because, after the inter∣locutor,
the pursuer was obliged to amend his li∣bel,
by changing one Christian name for another<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 7.; Fountainhall, 8th February 1712, Stewart <HI>contra</HI> Earl of Bute.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A rule is laid down above, concerning what
obligations go to heirs, when they are not men∣tioned
in the deed. What obligations go against
heirs, is a question to which the same rule is ap∣plicable.
A gratuitous obligation will not subject
the heir, unless he be subjected in the deed.
Thus, a bond of pension granted to an advocate,
was judged to die with the granter, seeing no
<PB N="91" REF="104"/>
mention was made of his heirs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 25th January 1693, Mackenzie <HI>con∣tra</HI> Marquis of Montrose.</NOTE>. The contrary
holds in obligations for a valuable consideration:
the heir is liable, unless it be declared that he
shall not be liable. Thus, a bond for borrowed
money burdens the heir, though he be not men∣tioned
in the bond. It is presumed, that he was
omitted by oversight; and equity supplies the o∣mission.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Special and general service.</HEAD>
<P>TO transfer property <HI>inter vivos,</HI> delivery is
necessary as well as consent. But to trans∣fer
it from the dead to the living, delivery is not
necessary: nor can it be; for after the proprie∣tor's
death, there exists no person who can make
delivery. Will alone is sufficient; and were it
not sufficient, property could not be transferred
from the dead to the living. Thus, the ef∣fects
of the predecessor are, upon his death, trans∣ferred
<HI>ipso facto</HI> to his heir; which is signified in
the law of France and of England by the expres∣sion,
<HI>Mortuus s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sit vivum.</HI></P>
<P>But this rule cannot hold where the heir is sub∣jected
to debts or burdens; for it would be in∣consistent
with justice, that a man, free and in∣dependent
by nature, should be subjected to any
obligation, or to any burden, without his own con∣sent.
In the Roman law, where the heir is held
to be <HI>eadem persona cum defuncto</HI> in burdens as
well as benefits, the heritage was not transferred
to him <HI>sola superviventia,</HI> but needed an ante∣cedent
consent. The consent indeed required no
solemnity: the apprehending possession of the
predecessor's effects, termed <HI>gestio pro herede,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="106"/>
was held a sufficient declaration of consent. In
France and in England there are no remain∣ing
traces of the Feudal law. The heir, by
taking possession, does not subject himself perso∣nally
to the debts or deeds of his predecessor:
no more is incumbent on him, but to abandon
his predecessor's estate to the creditors; and
therefore, in the countries mentioned, <HI>Mortuus
sasit vivum</HI> is the rule even in land-property.</P>
<P>In Scotland, this rule obtains not in the suc∣cession
even of moveables. As every species of
succession with us subjects the heir to his ance∣stor's
debts, <HI>aditio hereditatis</HI> is requisite, as a∣mong
the Romans, to testify the heir's consent
to be liable. But the rule obtains here in every
case where property is transferred without any
debt or burden. Thus, the legacy of a <HI>corpus</HI>
transfers the property to the legatee, the moment
of the testator's death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 80. De legat. 2.; l. 64. De furtis; Stair, b. 3. tit. 4. § 24. b. 3. tit. 8. § 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are two substantial reasons, that prevent
the rule from taking place with us in feudal pro∣perty.
The first coincides with that above men∣tioned:
an heir who succeeds to a land-estate
is liable to his superior in certain duties, and is,
over and above, liable for the debts of his pre∣decessor;
neither of which burdens can be just∣ly
imposed on him without his consent. The o∣ther
reason is, that supposing the heir willing to
<PB N="94" REF="107"/>
undergo every burden, yet such is the nature of
seudal property in Scotland, as not to be transfer∣able
from the dead to the living, more than <HI>in∣ter
vivos,</HI> without delivery: a seisin is equally
necessary in both. In England the rule <HI>Mortuus
sasit vivum</HI> obtains in the succession of land as
well as of moveables; because both pass from
the dead to the living without delivery. Hence
it was an easy step in that kingdom to authorise
the conveyance of land by testament, as move∣ables
always had done. But as to land in Scot∣land
a testament can avail nothing; because it
neither expresses nor implies an obligation on the
heir to make the defunct's will effectual: nor is
it any ground for an adjudication in implement.
Instead of a testament, a disposition is necessary,
with procuratory or precept; or at least an obli∣gation
to grant a disposition, which may be made
effectual by an adjudication in implement. Were
a testamentary deed held sufficient in this country
to transfer land, it would be necessary to new∣mould
our records, by rendering such deeds of
no effect unless recorded.</P>
<P>These particulars premised, we proceed to the
nature and use of the special and general servi∣ces,
beginning with the former. It is observed
above, that the heir in a feudal holding, acquires
the property by a grant from the superior, term∣ed
<HI>renovatio seudi.</HI> The sovereign here acts
<PB N="95" REF="108"/>
differently from a subject-superior. The latter is
supposed to be acquainted with the condition of
his vassals: and upon application of the heir, he
issues a precept for infefting the heir, or, in other
words, for entering him into possession. No
proof is necessary to verify the heir's claim, be∣cause
the facts are known to the superior; and
the precept accordingly is introduced with the
following preamble, <HI>Quia mihi clare constat.</HI>
In order to receive a renovation of the feu from
the sovereign, greater ceremony is necessary.
The King is not supposed to be acquainted with
every one of his numerous vassals; and therefore
it is made a general rule, That the person who
claims as heir, must verify the facts that are ne∣cessary
to support his claim; which is done in the
following manner. A brieve is issued from the
chancery to the sheriff of the shire where the land
lies, requiring him to try, by an inquest, the
facts specified in the brieve. If the facts be ve∣rified,
the sheriff of old gave infestment to the
claimant; and the verdict of the inquest remain∣ed
in the sheriff's court, or was neglected as no
longer of use. This form was altered by James I.
in conformity to the practice of England. The
brieve, with a minute of the court's proceedings
and verdict of the inquest, are returned to the
chancery; and the claim being thus legally sup∣ported,
a precept issues out of chancery to the
sheriff, ordering him to infeft the claimant. The
<PB N="96" REF="109"/>
verdict of the inquest is termed a <HI>service,</HI> which,
in England, expresses what is done in obedience
to a writ. And with us afterward it was called a
<HI>special service,</HI> in opposition to a general service
when that writ was introduced. The process in
the sheriff's court, after the practice was intro∣duced
of returning it to the chancery, obtained
from that circumstance the name of <HI>retornatus,</HI>
or retour.</P>
<P>One can be at no loss, after this deduction,
to comprehend the meaning and purpose of a
special service. The inquest are the witnesses
called to give evidence of the necessary facts;
the verdict is the evidence they give; and the
whole proceedings are returned to the chancery,
as an answer to the questions of fact put in behalf
of the crown.</P>
<P>To explain a general service, a wider compass
is requisite. In Scotland of old, the heir was
not liable personally for the debts of his ancestor;
nor is he even at present liable in England.
Therefore, as to rent-charges, bonds secluding
executors, and other heritable subjects, that may
be termed allodial because not held of a supe∣rior,
these in Scotland, as in England, were <HI>ip∣so
facto</HI> transferred to the heir of blood, upon
the death of his ancestor. Heirs with us were
put on a different footing, by adopting identity
of person from the Roman law. The heir, be∣ing
by that fiction subjected personally to the
<PB N="97" REF="110"/>
debts of his ancestor, must consequently have an
option to claim the succession, or to abandon it,
as it suits his interest. And hence an <HI>aditio he∣reditatis,</HI>
as among the Romans, without which
the heir has no right to his ancestor's effects.
If he use this form, he becomes <HI>eadem persona
cum defuncto</HI> with respect to burdens as well as
benefits: if he abstain from using it, he is un∣derstood
to abandon the succession, and to have
no concern either with burdens or benefits. The
form is simple, adapted to the nature of the
transaction. The laying hold of any allodial sub∣ject,
is held an <HI>aditio hereditatis,</HI> or <HI>gestio pro
herede;</HI> which, on the one hand, completes the
heir's right to all subjects of the kind, and, on
the other, makes him liable to all the debts of
his ancestor. Thus, the taking possession of the
heirship-moveables, makes the heir <HI>eadem perso∣na
cum defuncto;</HI> and the same possession is the
only active title that is necessary. In that respect,
the heir resembles the next of kin after the
act 1690: a service is not requisite to complete
the heir's right to heirship-moveables; and a
confirmation is not requisite to complete the
right of the next of kin to other moveables:
neither of them has right <HI>sola superviventia;</HI>
and the taking possession is the <HI>aditio hereditatis</HI>
in both. A valuable manuscript of great antiqui∣ty,
is bequeathed to a family▪ will it not be con∣sidered
<PB N="98" REF="111"/>
as an heirship-moveable, to pass from the
ancestor to the heir without a service?</P>
<P>There is a stronger analogy between heirship-moveables
and heritable bonds or heritable
dispositions, than is commonly thought. Consi∣dering
an heritable bond as a <HI>jus incorporale,</HI>
there is no analogy. But considering it as a ma∣nuscript,
why may it not be transferred from the
dead to the living, like any other heirship-move∣able?
A general service is not necessary to
transmit heirship-moveables: an heritable bond,
or other deed affecting land, considered as a <HI>cor∣pus,</HI>
is an heirship-moveable. For what purpose
then was a general service introduced? Our au∣thors
are silent upon that head; and we must
grope our way in the dark. The general service
is of no great antiquity: it followed the special
service at a great distance of time; and is an
aukward imitation of it. Every circumstance
proves, that it must have been introduced by ig∣norant
practitioners, without authority of the le∣gislature,
and probably without direction of the
sovereign court. In the first place, there is no
brieve in the chancery for a general service.
This defect could not regularly be supplied but
by a statute. But precision was little minded;
and it was thought, that the brieve for a special
service might answer the purpose, though the
whole clauses in that brieve concern land in which
the predecessor died infeft, and these only. In
<PB N="99" REF="112"/>
the next place, the verdict is no less irregular
than the brieve. One question excepted, viz.
Whether did the predecessor die at the faith and
peace of our Sovereign Lord, the verdict an∣swers
none of the questions put in the brieve;
but answers one that is not put, viz. Whether
the claimant be the heir of line? A minute is
made of the proceedings as is done in the special
service; and is returned to the chancery, though
the sovereign has no concern in the matter.</P>
<P>Considering that the general service is a servile
imitation of the special service, we may conclude,
with reasonable assurance, that to furnish legal e∣vidence
is the purpose of both. This is clear
in a special service, from its form, and from its
contents; and it is equally clear from the form
and contents of a general service: the tenor of a
writ is the strongest evidence of its purpose. But
now supposing this, the question is, What is the
use of the general service? An heir, in order to
continue his predecessor's possession of the heir∣ship-moveables,
has no occasion for any proof.
But heritable bonds are in a different condition.
An heir may take possession of them <HI>via facti.</HI>
But he cannot lay his hand upon the money <HI>via
facti:</HI> he must apply to the debtors; who will
be scrupulous about paying till they have com∣plete
evidence of his being heir. This considera∣tion
unfolds the purpose of the general service.
If in every process against the debtors of the pre∣decessor,
<PB N="100" REF="113"/>
it were incumbent on the pursuer to re∣new
the evidence of his being heir, the expence
would be grievous; and the general service
was certainly invented to prevent that grievance.
A general service accordingly may be considered
as a public proof, which every debtor is bound to
regard.</P>
<P>I observe an error gaining ground daily, as if
it were the special service that produces the iden∣tity
of person between the heir and ancestor. A
special service has no such effect; it being, as de∣monstrated
above, a species merely of evidence.
Subject-superiors, acquainted with the condi∣tion
of their vassals, have no occasion for evi∣dence;
and they accordingly give infeftment, by
means of a precept of <HI>Clare constat,</HI> without the
solemnity of a special service. Nor does there
appear any thing in law to bar the King from
granting such a precept, where the necessary facts
are known to him without a proof. It is pro∣bable,
that he has often granted precepts of that
kind to the heirs of his chief vassals; of which
there is one illustrious instance on record. James
VI. granted a precept of <HI>Clare constat</HI> in favour
of his eldest son Prince Charles, as nearest heir
to his mother Queen Anne in the lordship of
Dunfermline, directing the sheriff of Fife to give
seisin of the said lordship to the said Prince. To
this precept the court of session interposed their
authority, 3d July 1619. Nor could they do o∣therwise;
<PB N="101" REF="114"/>
therwise; for it would have been ridiculous in
the King, to require evidence of a fact, that he
had better access to know than any other person.
It is not therefore the special service that transfers
the heritage to the heir; nor is it the special ser∣vice
that subjects the heir to the debts of his an∣cestor.
It is the infeftment that completes both
the active and passive titles: it transfers the pro∣perty
of the estate to the heir; and consequently
makes him liable for the predecessor's debts. And
indeed so little weight was laid upon the service
after obtaining infeftment, that it was commonly
left in the chancery neglected, without even ta∣king
an extract. But it was unnecessary to say
more than to appeal to an established point,
which is, That if the heir, after expeding a spe∣cial
service, stop short, and neither take in∣feftment,
nor enter into possession, he will not be
liable for his ancestor's debts, nor have right to
his estate.</P>
<P>Neither is it the general service that completes
the active and passive representation of the heir,
with respect to heritable subjects that fall not un∣der
a special service. It is observed above, that
in such subjects <HI>mortuus sasit vivum,</HI> and that
apprehending possession is the circumstance that
completes both active and passive representation.
So true this is, that if, after expeding a general
service, the heir abstain from intermeddling, he
will be liable for none of his predecessor's debts.
<PB N="102" REF="115"/>
That in practice the general service is considered
as evidence only, will appear from the following
considerations. First, A debtor in an heritable
bond, if he be willing to wave a general service,
pays safely to the heir; and though that heir die
without a general service, the heir next in succes∣sion
has no claim against the debtor; which
shews, that the heir has right <HI>sola superviven∣tia;</HI>
and that a general service is only necessary
to ascertain that he is heir. That the court of
session will have no difficulty to sustain such a
payment, there is reason to believe from analogy:
a debtor in a moveable bond, is not bound to
pay to the next of kin without a confirmation;
but if he pass from that formality, a discharge
by the next of kin is always sustained as an ex∣tinction
of the debt.</P>
<P>Second, It has been long an established maxim,
That a special service includes a general service.
Taking a service, general or special, as a title to
the ancestor's effects, the maxim cannot hold.
A special service, as observed above, is not a
title to land, but only a means for obtaining from
the Sovereign a precept for infefting the heir,
which, with seisin upon it, completes his title.
And even supposing a special service to be a
title; it is confined to land in which the predeces∣sor
died infeft, and reaches not any other heri∣table
subject. A special service then, if held to
be a title, cannot include a general service. But
<PB N="103" REF="116"/>
holding a special service, as it truly is, to be evi∣dence
that the claimant is heir, the reason of the
maxim is obvious. A verdict finding me to be
heir of line, intitles me to demand from the sove∣reign
a renovation of my ancestor's feu, provided
to him and his heirs of line. After which, there
is no necessity of a new proof, when I demand
payment of an heritable bond that was due to
my ancestor.</P>
<P>Third, Where in a bond secluding executors,
or containing a clause for infefting the creditor,
there is a nominatim substitute, a general service
is not necessary. Why? because where the heir
is named, there is no occasion for a proof. Were
a general service necessary for transferring heri∣table
subjects from the ancestor to his heir, it
would be no less necessary to a nominatim substi∣tute,
than to any other substitute. And I must
observe in passing, that this is one of the cases
where the maxim holds in Scotland, <HI>Mortuus
sasit vivum:</HI> a nominatim substitute is not sub∣jected
to the predecessor's debts beyond the value
of the subject; and therefore the subject vests in
him <HI>sola superviventia.</HI> An <HI>aditio hereditatis</HI>
is unnecessary where the heir runs no hazard.</P>
<P>It has indeed been doubted, whether a nomi∣natim
substitute in a subject where the institute
was infeft, can take without a special service.
But I can find no ground for the doubt; consider∣ing
especially, that a general service is not requi∣site
<PB N="104" REF="117"/>
to a nominatim substitute in other heritable
subjects. No analogy appears more intimate,
than between a nominatim substitute in an infeft∣ment
of annualrent, and a nominatim substitute
in an heritable bond where infeftment has not
been taken: a proof is not necessary in the one
case more than in the other. I venture, at the
same time, to conjecture the occasion of the
doubt. The practice in chancery, of requiring a
special service before issuing a precept for infeft∣ing
the heir, is so common, that in vain would e∣ven
a nominatim substitute demand such a precept
without a previous service. And it is prudent in
the director of the chancery to adhere to esta∣blished
forms, without taking upon him to judge
how far such forms are essential. But the prac∣tice
of the chancery, whatever doubt it may oc∣casion,
affords certainly no argument for the ne∣cessity
of a special service in this case. At the
same time, there is one noted example, mention∣ed
above, of a precept granted by the sovereign
without a previous service. When King James,
in favour of his son Prince Charles, issued a pre∣cept
of <HI>Clare constat</HI> of his being nearest heir
to his mother Queen Anne, it would have been
ridiculous to have issued a brieve for inquiring
into facts that could not be but well known to
the King; and it is no less ridiculous to demand a∣ny
proof from a nominatim substitute, when his
claim is legally vouched by an authentic writing.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="118"/>
I close this subject with a case that affords a
fair opportunity of applying the principles above
laid down. A purchaser of land having obtained
a disposition with procuratory and precept, dies
in possession, but without being infest. What is
necessary to be done by the heir for completing
his right to the land? It will be answered, that
a general service transfers to the heir the disposi∣tion
granted to his ancestor; which intitles him
to take infeftment, by using the procuratory or
precept, as the ancestor himself might have done.
But is this form necessary in all cases, or in the
present case? About the heir I suppose there is
no doubt. The heir, acknowledged by all to be
so, continues his ancestor's possession of the land,
as well as of the disposition, and of the heirship-moveables.
He levies the rents. These particu∣lars
make a complete <HI>gestio pro herede,</HI> which
transfers to him the property of the disposition, as
well as of the heirship-moveables. What better
right can a general service bestow on him? The
disposition granted to his ancestor is a <HI>corpus,</HI> of
which he is intitled to take possession; and by that
possession, the property of the disposition is trans∣ferred
to him, as well as of the heirship-move∣ables.
What bars him then from using the pro∣curatory
or precept, as his predecessor might have
done? He has no need of a general service, be∣cause
he has no occasion to prove any fact.</P>
<P>But however evident this may be, it is thought,
<PB N="106" REF="119"/>
with respect to land held of the crown, that the
Barons of Exchequer would not receive a resigna∣tion
from the heir upon the ancestor's procurato∣ry,
without a general service. For here, as in a
precept from the chancery, more weight will
probably be laid upon practice than upon prin∣ciple.
Where the land is held of a subject, there
is not the same difficulty. The heir of the dispo∣nee
may use the procuratory of resignation grant∣ed
to his predecessor; and the superior, by that
resignation, is impowered to grant a charter,
which, with seisin, will complete the heir's right
to the land. But there is one way, by which the
heir may obtain a charter from the crown with∣out
a general service. He takes infeftment on the
precept, and becomes vassal to the disponer. The
Barons of Exchequer surely in that case would
make no difficulty to receive a resignation from
him, and to grant him a charter.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Executor.</HEAD>
<P>AN executor is a trustee appointed by a te∣stator
for collecting in his moveable effects
after his decease, and for converting them into
money, to be distributed among the parties con∣cerned.
And where a man dies intestate, the ex∣ecutor
is named by the commissary-court.</P>
<P>Where an executor receives a sum from a debt∣or
of the deceased, the money must become his
property, being delivered to him as a species, not
as a <HI>corpus;</HI> and for this sum, he becomes debtor
to those interested in the executry. But suppo∣sing
an executor, after obtaining a decree against
an executry-debtor, to have died without levying
the money, will the decree fall under his own
executry? Sir Thomas Hope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 88. Minor Practi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</NOTE> lays it down,
that the decree descends not to his next of kin,
but transmits to an executor <HI>ad non executa.</HI>
Lord Stair, on the contrary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Institutes, tit. Executry, sect. 61.</NOTE>, says, “That a te∣stament
is executed when the debt is establish∣ed
in the person of the executor <HI>activè,</HI> and
of the debtor <HI>passivè,</HI> either by new security,
<PB N="108" REF="121"/>
or by decreet.” Sir George Mackenzie deli∣vers
the same opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Institutions, book 3. tit. 9. sect. 16.</NOTE>, in the following words.
“If the executor have not execute the testament
in his own lifetime, that is to say, have not
obtained decreets for the goods belonging to
the defunct, there will be place for a new exe∣cutor
for executing these, who is called execu∣tor
<HI>ad non executa.</HI>” This in effect is hold∣ing,
that a decree at the instance of an executor,
though obtained by him in quality of executor or
trustee, constitutes him creditor in place of the
deceased, subjects him to the hazard of the debt
<HI>qua dominus,</HI> and renders him and his represen∣tatives
accountable for the sum, though the debt∣or
become insolvent.</P>
<P>This point deserves more attention than seems
to have been given it, by the authors last men∣tioned,
or by any writer since their time. I be∣gin
with examining the case of an executor testa∣mentary
or dative, who have no interest but to
collect and distribute the moveable effects of the
deceased. To prevent embezzlement, the exe∣cutor
must, on oath, make an inventory of these
effects, and find caution to make them forthco∣ming:
upon which he is confirmed by the com∣missary;
and the confirmation is his title for inter∣meddling
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie, Instit. book 3. tit. 9. sect. 15.</NOTE>. As it is the duty of this executor
to make the most of the effects, he ought to dis∣pose
<PB N="109" REF="122"/>
of them by public auction, according to
which he must account to the parties concerned;
and for that reason, it is of no use to state any
values in the inventory. This executor, being a
trustee merely, ought to be subjected to no ha∣zard.
If a moveable happen to perish before
sale by any accident, the persons interested in the
executry-fund must suffer the loss: the executor
cannot run the risk of effects that belong not to
him. For the same reason, if a debtor of the
deceased become insolvent after the executor has
obtained a decree against him, the executor can∣not
be burdened with the debt, unless he have
been negligent in demanding payment. Payment
indeed made to him, extinguishes the debt, and
renders him accountable for the sum he has re∣ceived.
It clearly follows, that a decree against
a debtor by an executor testamentary or dative,
is not a complete execution of the testament:
the debt continues to be a part of the executry∣fund;
and upon the executor's death, an execu∣tor
<HI>ad non executa</HI> must be appointed to levy the
sum contained in the decree. In this case, there∣fore,
the opinion of Sir Thomas Hope is un∣doubtedly
well founded, and that of Stair and
Mackenzie erroneous. So far Lord Stair is right,
that the taking a new security instead of pay∣ment,
and discharging the original debt, is a
complete execution of the testament, subjecting
the executor to account for the sum contained in

the discharge. A bond of corroboration is dif∣ferent;
for it may be a prudent act of admini∣stration,
to take such a bond when payment can∣not
be obtained.</P>
<P>I proceed to an executor-creditor. Confirma∣tion
is not to him a <HI>cesio in jure</HI> of the subjects
confirmed: it affords him only a security upon
these subjects, which intitles him to convert them
into money for his payment. In a poinding
there is a just appretiation of the goods; and ju∣stice
is not wounded, when the effects are adjud∣ged
to the creditor for his payment, at the appri∣sed
values. But as in a creditor's confirmation,
there is no rule laid down for a just appretiation,
nor for any appretiation, the law evidently in∣tends,
that the effects should be sold by auction;
and that the creditor should account for what he
receives. According to this plan, the effects con∣tinue
part of the executry-fund till they be sold.
If a moveable be destroyed by accident, or a
debtor become insolvent, the executry-fund is so
far diminished: the creditor loses his security;
but his claim continues entire, to be the founda∣tion
of a new execution. Upon the same plan,
it holds equally, that a decree obtained by an ex∣ecutor-creditor
against a debtor of the deceased,
is only an additional security. He is not bound
to accept of this decree as payment, nor to run
the risk of the debtor's solvency. It would be
unjust to subject him to the risk, when he has
<PB N="111" REF="124"/>
no choice, but must insist against the executry-debtors
such as they are. Hence it follows, that
if an executor-creditor, after obtaining a decree,
die without levying the money, there must be
place for an executor <HI>ad non executa.</HI> But in
that case the representatives of the creditor ought
to be preferred to the office, in order that they
may recover payment of the debt confirmed,
which is now secured to them.</P>
<P>An executor <HI>qua</HI> next in kin, leads to a spe∣culation
of more intricacy. Among the Romans,
there was no distinction of effects with respect to
succession from the dead to the living: the near∣est
male relation succeeded to the whole. In
Britain the predecessor's estate is split into two:
the person who succeeds to the heritable estate, is
termed <HI>heir;</HI> and the next in kin, excepting the
heir, succeed to the moveable estate. The right
of the heir is established by a proper <HI>aditio here∣ditatis;</HI>
and it is natural to think, that some
form similar should establish the right of the next
in kin. In practice, however, the authority the
next in kin have to lay hold of the moveable e∣state,
is derived from the commissary-court: they
are named executors by that court; and they
take possession of the moveables, as trustees, not
as heirs. Why should they not be impowered
to apprehend possession at short hand, as the heir
is impowered with respect to heirship-moveables,
or with respect to the rents of land? The myste∣ry
<PB N="112" REF="125"/>
is explained in the Essays on British Antiqui∣ties
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay 4. toward the close.</NOTE>. The moveables of a person dying inte∣state
were seized by the church, and disposed of
by a trustee named by the church, termed <HI>execu∣tor;</HI>
and nothing was more common than to ap∣ply
the essects <HI>ad pias causas,</HI> as pretended; a∣bandoning
even the wife and children to poverty.
The next in kin, it is true, were, in process of
time, restored to their legal rights: but the form
of their being named executors by the ecclesiasti∣cal
court was continued; as there is nothing
more common than to preserve in practice, modes
and customs, after the introductory cause is at an
end. At the same time, the nature of their right
tended to preserve in vigour the form of naming
them executors. As the fiction of the heir be∣ing
the same person with his ancestor, was never
introduced into the moveable succession; the next
in kin is not liable even for moveable debts far∣ther
than <HI>in valorem.</HI> And to prevent a tedious
count and reckoning, about the extent of the
moveable succession, and of the value, custom
has established an inventory, in which every par∣ticular
subject is entered, similar to what is re∣quired
in the confirmation of other executors;
and according to that inventory, the next in kin
account with the creditors and legatees of the de∣ceased.
But though the ancient form remains,
substance is more regarded than form. Notwith∣standing
<PB N="113" REF="126"/>
the title of executor, the next in kin
are justly held to be heirs <HI>in mobilibus,</HI> as they
truly are; and the confirmation is now considered
in no other light than as the <HI>aditio hereditatis
in mobilibus.</HI> The confirmation accordingly
transfers to the next in kin, the property of the
moveables, and the <HI>jus crediti</HI> of the debts;
whence it follows, that if any subject perish after
confirmation, it perishes to the next in kin <HI>qua
domini.</HI> At the same time, as they are bound
to pay debts and legacies <HI>in valorem</HI> of what
they succeed to, they annex to the inventory the
value of each particular subject, such as they are
willing to account for. If the parties interested
are dissatisfied with these values, any one credi∣tor
or legatee may apply for a confirmation <HI>ad
male appretiata,</HI> stating higher values in his in∣ventory.
By this confirmation he takes the ha∣zard
of the moveables upon himself; and ac∣counts
for his own values. In this case alone, as
far as I can discover, is there any proper ground
for a confirmation <HI>ad male appretiata:</HI> it is un∣necessary
and improper in the case of an execu∣tor-dative,
or executor-creditor, where the effects
ought to be disposed of by public auction. This
contrivance against a low appretiation, is not a
little awkward, and is not much in use; for what
creditor, to obtain payment perhaps of a small
debt, will undertake the hazard of a large fund
of executry? A more simple method, attended
<PB N="114" REF="127"/>
with no hazard, is to apply for a sale of the ef∣fects,
as is done by creditors where an heir enters
<HI>cum beneficio inventarii.</HI> I take it for granted,
that the next in kin may take possession of the
moveables at short hand, without confirmation,
which will transfer to them the property of the
moveables: the heirship-moveables are transfer∣red
to the heir by the same means. But then the
next in kin must, in that case, reckon on the
whole bent of the law against them: if the con∣trary
be not made clearly appear, it will be pre∣sumed,
that they have got sufficient to pay every
debt of the ancestor. So far only they will be
eased, that the presumption will not be extended
in favour of legatees. At the same time, to pre∣vent,
as much as possible, the next in kin from
intermeddling hiddenly, every debtor of the de∣ceased
is authorised to refuse payment, till he see
a confirmation, and his debt inserted in the inven∣tory.</P>
<P>From this long excursion, we return to the
proposition stated at the beginning. I have en∣deavoured
to make out, that the opinion of Hope
is well founded, with respect to an executor-da∣tive,
and executor-creditor; and consequently
that the opposite opinion of Stair and Mackenzie
is erroneous. But, as far as I can judge, none
of them are right with respect to an executor <HI>qua</HI>
next in kin. They succeed to the moveable e∣state,
as the heir does to the immoveable. Con∣firmation
<PB N="115" REF="128"/>
is the <HI>aditio hereditatis</HI> in the former,
as service is in the latter. A service with infeft∣ment
completes the heir's right to the land-estate:
confirmation completes the next in kin's right to
the debts, and <HI>ipsa corpora</HI> of the moveables.
The next in kin confirmed are, in every view,
similar to an heir <HI>cum beneficio</HI> infeft. The pro∣perty
is theirs, and they are only bound to ac∣count
for the value.</P>
<P>If now the confirmation of an executor <HI>qua</HI>
next in kin be a title of property, as it undoubt∣edly
is, the two following propositions are neces∣sary
consequences. The first is, That as the move∣ables
are vested in the next in kin, any acciden∣tal
loss rests upon them, and they still remain ac∣countable
for the apprised values. A fall in the
market-price of the goods, will not defend them
from paying these values: nor will a sudden start
in the market, make them liable beyond these
values. Nay, should a barn full of corn be burnt
<HI>casu fortuitu</HI> the instant after confirmation, they
must notwithstanding account for these values.
The next proposition is, That even with respect to
debts, there is no place for an executor <HI>ad non
executa.</HI> The confirmation transfers to the next
in kin the right that their ancestor had when a∣live:
the <HI>jus crediti,</HI> being established in them,
transmits of course to their representatives; and
there is no place for an executor <HI>ad non executa.</HI>
This was found in a deliberate decision, 24th June
<PB N="116" REF="129"/>
1737, Mitchell <HI>contra</HI> Mitchell of Blairgots;
which is the best authority, next to an act of par∣liament,
for maintaining, that confirmation is the
<HI>aditio hereditatis in mobilibus</HI> with respect to
the next in kin; that the moveable estate is
thereby vested in them as formerly in the decea∣sed;
and consequently, that they run the hazard
of the goods confirmed, and transmit the same to
their representatives.</P>
<P>In many particulars there is a strong analogy
between the heir <HI>cum beneficio,</HI> and the next in
kin confirmed executors. If the creditors be
content with the value, the accidental destruction
of any subject contained in the inventory, will
not relieve either of them from being accountable
for its value. The heir may avoid all hazards,
whether of subjects or of debts, by using for his
title a trust-adjudication; and the next in kin may
avoid all such hazards, by obtaining themselves
to be confirmed executors-dative. In that quali∣ty,
they run no risk: they levy the debts that
can be recovered, sell the moveables that exist,
make a dividend among the creditors, &amp;c. and
retain the surplus to themselves. If the creditors,
declining to accept of the value, insist to bring
the effects to a public sale, this step relieves the
heir <HI>cum beneficio,</HI> as well as the next in kin,
from any risk: it would be against conscience to
force a sale of the subjects that exist, and, at the
<PB N="117" REF="130"/>
same time, to make them liable for the value of
the subjects that do not exist.</P>
<P>To sum up the whole: It appears, that Sir
Thomas Hope's opinion holds only with respect
to an executor-dative and executor-creditor, the
only cases he probably had in view; and that
the opinion of Lord Stair, and Sir George Mac∣kenzie,
holds not in any case. A decree obtain∣ed
against an executry-debtor, by an executor-dative
or executor-creditor, is but an inchoated
execution, which, after their death, must be com∣pleted
by an executor <HI>ad non executa.</HI> Very
different is the case of an executor <HI>qua</HI> next in
kin. His confirmation is complete execution,
because it transfers to him the property of the
moveables, and the <HI>jus crediti</HI> of the debts, lea∣ving
nothing <HI>in hereditate</HI> of the deceased. Con∣firmation
accordingly subjects the executor <HI>qua</HI>
next in kin to the risk of the subjects confirmed,
and after his death transmits them to his repre∣sentatives.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Whether arrestment or confirmation can
proceed upon an infeftment of annual∣rent.</HEAD>
<P>AN infeftment of annualrent was originally a
wadset. It was invented when, by a fool∣ish
regulation of the Canon law, interest was
prohibited to be taken for the loan of money.
The law was evaded by purchasing an incumbrance
upon land, intitling the lender to levy rents e∣quivalent
to the interest of his money; and the
money was delivered to the borrower, not as a
sum to bear interest, but as the price of the in∣cumbrance.
The borrower could redeem his land
by repayment of the money; and the lender could
demand his money upon renouncing the incum∣brance.
While the incumbrance subsisted, there
was no debt; and the lender had no claim against
the borrower personally, till the incumbrance
was renounced. This was a cumbersome mode
for making money bear interest; and after inte∣rest
for money became lawful commerce, a more
simple and commodious mode was introduced.
The borrower is taken bound personally to pay
the money with interest; and to secure the pay∣ment,
he infefts the creditor in his land. Here
<PB N="119" REF="132"/>
the personal obligation is the principal; and the
infeftment is accessory only.</P>
<P>As an heritable bond is not a moveable subject
to be carried by confirmation, it is commonly
thought, that neither can it be used as a title for
confirming a moveable subject. But this appears
to be erroneous. In the old form, indeed, of
an infeftment of annualrent, no debt existed to
be the foundation either of an arrestment or of a
confirmation. But, in its present form, there is
a personal obligation for paying the sum borrow∣ed,
upon which arrestment and confirmation may
be founded, as well as upon a moveable bond.
Now as a real creditor may demand payment
from the executor; and a personal creditor may
demand payment from the heir; there is nothing
to bar a creditor, by an infeftment of annualrent,
from confirming as executor-creditor, nor from
arresting a sum due to his debtor.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What degree of mora deprives an adjudger
of the benefit of litigiosity.</HEAD>
<P>LAW is reasonably jealous of a debtor, that
when vexed with execution, he may be
tempted to alien his subject, in order to disap∣point
the creditor. Law therefore bestows on
inchoated execution, the privilege of an inhibi∣tion,
to bar the debtor from disappointing the ex∣ecution
by alienting the subject; and this is the
meaning of the expression, that inchoated execu∣tion
renders the subject litigious. But the cre∣ditor
is justly deprived of this privilege, if he
make any unusual delay in completing his execu∣tion;
which leads to the question, What degree
of diligence is necessary to preserve the privilege?
An arrestment is an inchoated execution, that
renders the subject litigious. The creditor is <HI>in
cursu diligentiae,</HI> till he obtain a decree of forth∣coming;
and any unusual <HI>mora</HI> or delay in ob∣taining
that decree, will take off the litigiosity,
and give preference to any voluntary right grant∣ed
by the common debtor after the arrestment.
An adjudication is completed by infeftment,
which, by its own nature, bestows a preference,
without the privilege of litigiosity. But while the
<PB N="122" REF="135"/>
adjudger is <HI>in cursu diligentiae</HI> to obtain infeft∣ment,
the privilege of litigiosity secures the land
contained in the adjudication from being aliened
by the debtor. And here the question arises,
What degree of diligence is necessary to preserve
the privilege of litigiosity entire. The first
step for obtaining infeftment, is to charge the
superior; after which the adjudger must stop,
till the superior find leisure to infeft him. So far
clear. But, in order to preserve the privilege, is
it necessary that the adjudger proceed to a charge
against the superior? It is universally held, that
the charge is necessary. This is the opinion of
Lord Stair: “And generally voluntary rights are
excluded, being granted after the denunciation
of lands to be apprised, until infeftment be ob∣tained,
or a charge against the superior; all
which is the creditor's being <HI>in cursu diligen∣tis;</HI>
and after a competent time for obtaining
infeftment, or charging the superior, any po∣sterior
or voluntary right is preferable to the
apprising; as was found in the competition of
the creditors of Langton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 3. tit. 2. sect. 20.</NOTE>.” And again<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">sect. 29. of the same title.</NOTE>,
“But since the act of parliament, bringing in
apprisers <HI>pari passu,</HI> the first effectual appri∣sing
is declared to be either by infeftment, or
charge against the superior to grant infeftment,
which is ordinarily sustained without further
<PB N="123" REF="136"/>
insisting.” This opinion has been followed by
the court of session in every decision. Thus it
was found, “That denunciation of apprising
makes the subject litigious; after which the
debtor cannot make any voluntary alienation
in prejudice of the apprising, provided the ap∣priser
proceed in diligence to obtain infeft∣ment,
or charge the superior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair. 23d July 1674, Johnston <HI>contra</HI> Johnston.</NOTE>.” Again, “A
compriser being <HI>in mora</HI> for twelve or thirteen
years, not obtaining infeftment, not charging
the superior, nor using diligence to recover
mails and duties, a voluntary disposition for a
price paid granted after the comprising, with
infeftment upon it, was preferred<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 25th February 1680, Earls of South∣esk and Northesk <HI>contra</HI> Laird Powrie.</NOTE>” Again,
“Denunciation of apprising renders the subject
litigious; after which every voluntary aliena∣tion
by the debtor, even for a price told down,
to prevent the appriser <HI>in cursu diligentiae,</HI> is
ineffectual: but where the appriser was silent
and negligent by the space of ten years with∣out
infeftment or charge, and without pursuing
fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mails and duties, he was not allowed to
plead the litigiosity, since it could not be said
that he was <HI>in cursu diligentiae</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stair, 8th February 1681, Nielson <HI>contra</HI> Ross.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>These great authorities notwithstanding, I can∣not
help doubting, whether a charge against the
<PB N="124" REF="137"/>
superior be necessary. Whatever necessity there
may have been originally for infeftment or a
charge, to preserve the privilege, I see not, as
our law stands at present, that an adjudger du∣ring
the legal is bound to do any sort of dili∣gence.
I see not that <HI>mora</HI> can be imputed to
him, for not proceeding to charge the superior,
or to apprehend possession. While an appri∣sing
was a judicial sale of the land, an appriser
could not possess without infeftment: the supe∣rior
was intitled to have a vassal.; and he had an
interest to insist for payment of a year's rent for
change of the vassal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, 22d July 1665, Johnston <HI>contra</HI> tenants of Auchincorse.</NOTE>. But an apprising, during
the legal, having degenerated to be a <HI>pignus
praetorium</HI> only, it was thought hard upon the
debtor, to oblige the appriser, during the legal,
to pay a year's rent to the superior. The court
accordingly came to a resolution to permit the
appriser to possess during the legal, without de∣manding
infeftment, and consequently without
paying a year's rent to the superior<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stair, 3d December 1672, Hay <HI>contra</HI> Earlston.</NOTE>. And this
has been the constant practice ever since<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Stair, book 2. tit. 3. sect. 30.</NOTE>.
Now, if an adjudger be not bound to take in∣feftment
during the legal, he cannot be bound to
charge the superior to give him infeftment. It
would indeed be absurd to make such a charge
<PB N="125" REF="138"/>
a necessary step of diligence, when the adjudger
is neither willing nor obliged to accept of infeft∣ment.
Neither can the forbearing to take posses∣sion,
be imputed to the adjudger as a <HI>mora;</HI> be∣cause
his right, which is a security only, leaves
him at liberty to levy the rents or not, as he finds
it convenient. Adjudgers are commonly unwil∣ling
to subject themselves to a count and reckon∣ing:
they will have their money in a lump, or
the land, instead of their money, when the le∣gal
expires. Weighing these particulars, there
appears not any foundation for the imputation of
<HI>mora</HI> during the legal, though the adjudger nei∣ther
charge the superior, nor enter into possession.
And with respect to the decisions above men∣tioned,
in two of them the legal is mentioned as
expired; after which undoubtedly an adjudger is
<HI>in mora,</HI> if he neither take possession, nor charge
the superior to infeft him.</P>
<P>It may possibly be objected, that as, during
the legal, an adjudication is not an effectual dili∣gence
without a charge against the superior, an
adjudger is really <HI>in mora</HI> if he stop short, and
make not his diligence effectual. It is true, that
the act 1661 declares an adjudication to be effec∣tual
upon which infeftment has followed, or the
first exact diligence for obtaining infeftment;
and it has been found by the court of session,
that a simple charge against the superior is exact
diligence in the sense of the statute. But re∣mark,
<PB N="126" REF="139"/>
that this act passed while both law and cu∣stom
obliged apprisers to take infeftment, with∣out
which their apprisings were reckoned incom∣plete,
even during the legal. Our present prac∣tice
differs widely. As adjudgers are thought to
be rigorous who take infeftment during the legal,
the legislature, I am convinced, would not re∣quire,
during the legal, either infeftment, or a
charge against the superior. However this be,
the statute had laid down a rule for ranking com∣peting
apprisers; and the statute must be obeyed.
But there is no statute upon the present point.
An adjudger, in order to exclude other creditors
who adjudge after year and day, must charge the
superior; but though he forbear to charge during
the legal, the subject continues to be litigious, so
as to exclude every voluntary conveyance by the
debtor done during the legal.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">What title necessary in a process.</HEAD>
<P>TItle, in popular language, is used as synony∣mous
with right; as, for example, <HI>I have
right to reap the fruits of a certain field,</HI> and,
<HI>I am intitled to reap the fruits of a certain

title is distinguished from right: it means
the evidence of a right. I have right to a le∣gacy
by a testament; and the testament is my
title for demanding payment. A bargain of
wheat is vouched by mutual missive letters; and
when I sue for performance, the defendant's mis∣sive

is the pursuer's title, and also the <HI>means</HI> by
which he acquires his right. Example: My fa∣ther

of infeftment, or by a clause excluding execu∣tors.
The debt is vouched by the bond: a ge∣neral
service is the <HI>means</HI> by which I acquire
right to the debt; and it is also my <HI>title</HI> in a
process against a debtor for payment. A special
service, with infeftment, are the <HI>means</HI> by which
the property of the predecessor's estate is vested
in the heir; and it is also the heir's <HI>title</HI> in every
process relative to the estate.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="141"/>
<HI>Title</HI> is defined by Lord Coke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke upon Littleton, sect. 649.</NOTE> to be the
<HI>means</HI> by which a right is established. This de∣finition
is imperfect: consent is a <HI>means</HI> by
which many rights are established, and money is
another; yet neither of these is held to be a title.
On the other hand, there are many <HI>titles</HI> that
are not the <HI>means</HI> of establishing a right. A
minute of sale is evidence of the bargain, and is
also the vender's title in an action against the
buyer for the price; but consent, and not the
minute of sale, is the means by which the right
is established. Sometimes, indeed, as above
mentioned, the means by which a right is esta∣blished
is, at the same time, the pursuer's title;
but this is far from being always so.</P>
<P>The pursuer's right is, in several instances, no∣torious,
requiring no evidence. A young man,
bred up in his father's family, claims the rents
of his father's estate as his son and heir: his
right arises from his apparency; and his appa∣rency,
being notorious, requires no evidence.
This, in law-language, is expressed by saying,
that the pursuer requires no title for carrying on
such process.</P>
<P>Lord Stair divides titles into two kinds; origi∣nal,
and by progress<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Institutes, book 4. tit. 38. sect. 19.</NOTE>. The evidence of an o∣riginal
right, is an original title. A bond for a
sum of money, is a proper example: a right is
<PB N="129" REF="142"/>
created to the creditor against the debtor by con∣sent;
and the bond, being the evidence of the
right, is the creditor's title in an action for pay∣ment.
When a right is conveyed from one per∣son
to another, the evidence of the conveyance
is the purchaser's title in every process for ma∣king
the right effectual. Infeftment on a re∣tour,
confirmation of an executor, an assign∣ment,
a disposition, an adjudication, are titles by
progress.</P>
<P>The title necessary in a reduction on the head
of deathbed, is original. A deed, though grant∣ed
on deathbed, is effectual against the granter;
and as it cannot be challenged by him, neither
can it be challenged by any in his right. But as
an heir is protected by law against the deathbed-deeds
of his predecessor, such a deed is chal∣lengeable
by the heir in his own right. Accor∣dingly,
to found the reduction, the only evidence
required is, that the pursuer is heir; and when
that is notorious, as it commonly is, we say,
that the pursuer requires no title. But when the
relation is so distant, as to require evidence, the
evidence, whether by writ or by witnesses, is the
pursuer's title. As the title here is original, the
heir's serving to his predecessor will not bar the
reduction; for he represents not his predecessor
with respect to a deathbed-deed, against which
he is privileged by law. He resembles an heir
of entail, who represents not his predecessor as to
<PB N="130" REF="143"/>
any alienation of the entailed estate. But in re∣ducing
the deathbed-deed, the heir's service can∣not
be his title; for the reduction is founded on
his own right, not upon his being <HI>eadem persona
cum defuncto.</HI></P>
<P>Next in order come titles by progress. A
special service, with infeftment, is the heir's title
in every action relative to the subjects thus con∣veyed
to him; and a general service is his title in
every action relative to subjects conveyed to him
by the general service. An heir, claiming upon
a disposition to land made to his predecessor,
must have a general service for his title. The
general service answers two purposes: it is, first,
the <HI>means</HI> of transferring the subject to the heir;
and is, next, his title in every action relative to
the subject.</P>
<P>The right a man has to reduce a disposition of
land unduly obtained from him, is transferred to
his heir by a general service, which consequently
is the heir's title to carry on the reduction. Ex∣ample:
A man is, by fraud, induced to grant a
disposition of his land, and the disponce is infeft
on the procuratory. The question is, What
title is necessary to the heir, after the disponer's
death, in a reduction on fraud and circumven∣tion?
He cannot serve heir in special to land
which did not belong to his predecessor at his
death. For the same reason, he cannot be char∣ged
to enter to it upon a trust-bond, granted in
<PB N="131" REF="144"/>
order to lead an adjudication. Neither will his
apparency serve him as a title, because he cannot
specify himself to be heir-apparent in the land.
A general service is the title, because it conveys
to him his predecessor's right to challenge the dis∣position
elicited from him by fraud and circum∣vention.
But may not the heir sue in his own
right, without necessity of a general service;
which ought to be avoided, if possible, because it
subjects him to all his predecessor's debts? The
following argument may be urged in his fa∣vour.
Justice forbids the fraudulent acquirer to
retain the subject. He is bound, in conscience,
to restore it to the disponer; and, after his death,
to the heir. The heir consequently has right to
demand a conveyance by a process, if not done
voluntarily. The argument appears well found∣ed,
supposing the fraud and circumvention to
be admitted. And upon that medium it was
found, that the heir-apparent who could challenge
the disposition, might ratify it; and that his rati∣fication
did, after his death, exclude all the dis∣poner's
other heirs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">17th February 1761, Gordon <HI>contra</HI> Ogilvie.</NOTE>. But what if the fraud and
circumvention be denied? Will it be sufficient
for the heir to bring a proof of it in his process
of reduction; which proof will be his title, and,
at the same time, found the reduction? If the
pursuer succeed in his proof, the desendant has
no just cause of complaint. But he may sail in
<PB N="132" REF="145"/>
his proof; and it would be unjust to oblige the
purchaser to sustain a process which could not af∣ford
him an absolvitor but against the pursuer on∣ly,
leaving him open to other heirs after the pur∣suer's
death. At that rate, he might be subject∣ed
to processes without end. The law will never
permit such a grievance. And yet, on the other
hand, it would be equally grievous, to tie up the
hands of an heir from challenging a gross impo∣sition
upon his predecessor, unless the heir will
run the risk of being reduced to beggary by his
ancestor's creditors. In my apprehension, the
grievance on both sides may be removed, by the
heir's taking out a general service, limited, in ex∣press
terms, to the right his predecessor had to
challenge the disposition on fraud and circumven∣tion.
This mode will secure the acquirer, if he
obtain an absolvitor, from being liable to any o∣ther
heir: And it will secure the heir from being
liable to his predecessor's debts, beyond the pro∣fit
he makes by the process.</P>
<P>Suppose now the fraudulent acquirer not to be
infeft. The heir, in that case, is at no loss for a
title. He may complete his right to the estate,
by a special service, by an adjudication upon a
trust-bond, or by a general service in the form a∣bove
mentioned. Any of these will be a good
title for reduction.</P>
<P>Take another example: A disposition of land
is obtained from a minor under the value, and
<PB N="133" REF="146"/>
the disponee is infeft. The disponer, in his own
right, may insist in a reduction on the head of
minority and lesion; and his heir may insist, in
the same process, upon the title of a general ser∣vice,
qualified as above mentioned, if he be a∣fraid
of debts. Supposing the disponee not to be
infeft, the heir has the same titles to chuse upon,
that he has in reducing a disposition obtained from
his predecessor by fraud.</P>
<P>An action of improbation is of two kinds.
One challenges deeds affecting the pursuer's land;
the other challenges deeds affecting his predeces∣sor
personally. To carry on the former, the pur∣suer
must instruct that he is proprietor: to carry
on the latter, he must instruct, that he is perso∣nally
liable to the debts of his predecessor. For
if he be neither proprietor, nor be personally
liable, he has no interest to raise a process of ei∣ther
kind. An heir accordingly, in order to car∣ry
on an improbation of deeds affecting the fa∣mily-estate,
must first enter heir, and complete
his right to the estate by infeftment. And in or∣der
to carry on an improbation of debts affecting
his predecessor personally, a general service is ne∣cessary
as a title; because it subjects him to all
the debts and deeds of his predecessor.</P>
<P>With respect to a purchaser of land, it is a rule,
That, in order to challenge any infeftment on the
land, he must be infeft; because none but the
proprietor has right to challenge any deed affect∣ing
<PB N="134" REF="147"/>
his land. An adjudger, it is true, even with∣out
infeftment, has right to the rents; and con∣sequently
may challenge any deed, not excepting
an infeftment, so far as it obstructs his levying the
rents. But as his right carries him no farther,
an action will not be sustained at his instance, to
reduce the infeftment <HI>funditus.</HI> Whether a de∣cree
of adjudication may not be sustained as a
title to carry on a tentative process, shall be exa∣mined
afterward.</P>
<P>What is said upon the titles necessary for challen∣ging
real rights, is applicable to what are necessa∣ry
for challenging personal rights. If an assign∣ment
to a bond for borrowed money, procured
by unlawful means, be completed by intimation,
the ced<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt may, in his own right, challenge the
assignment; and so may his next in kin, upon
confirming his predecessor's right of challenge.
Confirmation is necessary, because it protects the
assignee, if he obtain an absolvitor, against any
future challenge. If there be no intimation, the
next in kin may confirm the bond itself, which
confirmation will be their title in a reduction of
the assignment.</P>
<P>Having discussed titles by progress in the per∣son
of an heir, we proceed to titles necessary to
creditors. There is no occasion to take under
consideration an action against the debtor himself,
the title of which is obvious. What we have in
view, are actions that a creditor may carry on
<PB N="135" REF="148"/>
in his debtor's name. With respect to a reduc∣tion
on minority and lesion, on inhibition, or on
deathbed, which the person directly interested
declines to carry on, it is a matter of some nicety,
whether his creditors can carry it on. I give,
for an example, an alienation on deathbed, which
the heir, who is bankrupt, refuses to challenge.
His creditors have not right, at common law, to
bring the reduction; for as the privilege is perso∣nal
to the heir, it cannot be exercised by his cre∣ditors,
unless upon a mandate from him. But it
being unjust in a debtor, to with-hold from his
creditors any subject, or any privilege, that may
contribute to their payment, it is his duty to in∣sist
in the reduction; and if he be refractory, a
court of equity will impower his creditors to car∣ry
it on in his name. This is the only remedy,
where the purchaser from the predecessor stands
infeft. But where he is not infeft, the creditors
have no occasion for an extraordinary remedy:
they may adjudge the land, after charging their
debtor to enter heir. This adjudication will
transfer the land to the creditors; and their right
to the land intitles them to reduce the deathbed-deed.</P>
<P>The following is an example of the same kind.
A man, from whom a disposition of land has been
obtained by fraud, becoming bankrupt, finds no
benefit to himself in bringing a reduction. His
creditors, if the purchaser be infeft, cannot ad∣judge
<PB N="136" REF="149"/>
the land: but they are authorised in equi∣ty
to bring a reduction in name of the disponer,
their debtor; and the court of session, as a court
of equity, will sustain the reduction, upon the
creditors producing their vouchers of debt, which
is their title.</P>
<P>But what if the debtor die before raising the
process, or before it be concluded? The credi∣tors
must charge the debtor's heir to enter heir
in general; and having, by that means, subject∣ed
him to their debts, they must proceed to what
is termed <HI>a general special charge,</HI> charging
the heir to enter to all heritable subjects which
the predecessor died possessed of without being
infeft. The creditors will thus obtain an adjudi∣cation
of all subjects that are carried by a general
service, including the predecessor's right to re∣duce
the disposition obtained from him by fraud;
and this adjudication is a title to carry on the re∣duction.
If the heir renounce, an adjudication
<HI>contra hereditatem jacentem</HI> will be the title.
Suppose next, that infeftment has not passed up∣on
the fraudulent disposition. In that case, the
debtor remaining proprietor, a special charge a∣gainst
his heir will impower the creditors to ad∣judge
the estate itself; and the adjudication will
to them be a good title to reduce the fraudulent
disposition.</P>
<P>To save a tedious and expensive circuit of di∣ligence
against the heir, when the debtor dies
<PB N="137" REF="150"/>
before the process of reduction is completed, it
will be a prudent step, to begin with adjudging
the land from the debtor himself, where the frau∣dulent
disponee is not infeft; or with adjudging
their debtor's right of challenge, where the frau∣dulent
disponee is infeft. Upon that title, they
may carry on the process of reduction, even after
the death of their debtor.</P>
<P>The same rules are applicable to a reduction car∣ried
on by creditors founded on their debtor's mi∣nority
and lesion, or carried on by them on the
ground of interdiction. With respect to a reduction
on the ground of inhibition, which the creditors of
the inhibiter desire to carry on, they may arrest
the debt on which the inhibition is founded: a
decree of forthcoming will transfer to them from
their debtor the <HI>jus crediti;</HI> which of course will
intitle them, as judicial assignees, to carry on the
process of reduction.</P>
<P>With respect to a process of removing, it is e∣vident
in the first place, that the proprietor's
charter and seisin make an effectual title, to re∣move
every man from his land who has not a
current lease to defend his possession. In the
next place, though a man who has a disposition
to land without infeftment, is not proprietor;
yet if he grant a lease, and take from the lessee
an obligation to remove at a term specified, the
obligation conveyed to a new lessee, will intitle
him to bring a removing in his own name. His
<PB N="138" REF="151"/>
lease gives him an interest to carry on the pro∣cess;
and the obligation is his title. In the third
place, with regard to a tenant who possesses by
a lease from a former proprietor, the infeftment
of the present proprietor is a good title for remo∣ving
that tenant when the lease is at an end:
but he cannot impower his own lessee to carry on
the removing in the lessee's own name, otherwise
than by conveying the property to him. A man∣date
to carry on the removing in the proprietor's
name, will be effectual; but a mandate to carry
on the removing in the lessee's own name, is <HI>ul∣tra
vires</HI> of the proprietor.</P>
<P>I close this essay with examining what title is
necessary in a tentative process, such as paves the
way to what is ultimately intended. An exhi∣bition
<HI>ad deliberandum,</HI> is a proper example of
a tentative process: it is of no benefit to the pur∣suer,
but as affording him means to deliberate
whether it be his interest to enter heir or not.
An heir-apparent has a year for this deliberation;
and the law gives him inspection of all writings
that may enable him to form a prudent resolution.
This action then is founded on the pursuer's per∣sonal
privilege; and the notoriety of being heir∣apparent
is his title.</P>
<P>I proceed to other examples. Before an in∣hibiter
can challenge a disposition granted by his
debtor, common law requires, that he adjudge
the subject aliened; because, if he have no right
<PB N="139" REF="152"/>
to the land, he has no interest to challenge any
deed affecting it. An adjudication, therefore, is
the inhibiter's title to carry on the process of re∣duction;
and it is beside the pursuer's title to the
land, if he prevail in the reduction. But what if
he do not prevail? In that case, both parties suf∣fer
by the adjudication: the pursuer loses the ex∣pence
he was at in adjudging; and the defend∣ant's
property is burdened with an adjudication,
which, though rendered ineffectual by the absol∣vitor,
makes however an obstruction in a sale.
Upon that account, it has been for many years
the practice, to sustain a reduction on the ground
of inhibition, as a tentative process, without a
preparatory adjudication. If the pursuer succeed
in his reduction, he then proceeds to adjudge:
if the defendant be assoilzied, his land is free
from the adjudication. The absolvitor, at the
same time, secures the defendant against all future
challenge: it is effectual against the pursuer;
and it must be equally effectual against those who
derive right from him to the bond upon which the
inhibition proceeded, whether heirs or singular
successors.</P>
<P>There was occasion above to observe, that a
decree of adjudication is not a legal title to chal∣lenge
any infeftment upon the land adjudged;
but whether it may not be sustained as a tentative
title, shall now be considered. It is hard to ob∣lige
the adjudger to be at the expence of an in∣feftment,
<PB N="140" REF="153"/>
while the success of his reduction re∣mains
uncertain: and it is hard upon the defend∣ant
to submit to the pursuer's infeftment, when
he is ready to shew, that the land belongs to him,
and that the pursuer has no right. At the same
time, where a decree of adjudication is the pur∣suer's
title, an absolvitor is not less effectual a∣gainst
him and his heirs, than if he had been in∣feft.
A decree of adjudication accordingly has
been sustained of late years, as an equitable title
for challenging every infeftment of the land ad∣judged.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Arrestment jurisdictionis fundandae gratia.</HEAD>
<P>IN a process for payment against an English∣man
resient in England, who was cited at
the market-cross of Edinburgh, pier and shore of
Leith, it was in his behalf pleaded, That he was
not subjected to the jurisdiction of the court, and
therefore that the process could not be compe∣tent
against him. Answered, The person cited
has, or may have, effects in Scotland; and an
action must be competent against him, in order
to attach such effects. Replied, Whatever be the
consequence, no inconvenience will support a pro∣cess
before an incompetent court. At the same
time there is no occasion to proceed so irregu∣larly:
foreign effects locally in Scotland, are
subjected to the courts of Scotland, though the
proprietor be not; and by a real action, may be
adjudged, or made forthcoming to a creditor for
his payment.</P>
<P>More particularly, moveables locally in Scotland,
to whomever belonging, are subject to our courts
of law, and at their disposal. A court will listen
to a claimant setting forth, “That his debtor is a
foreigner, not within the jurisdiction of the
court; but that certain effects of his, specified,
<PB N="142" REF="155"/>
happen to be within the jurisdiction; and pray∣ing,
that these effects may be adjudged to him
for his payment.” To that end, the claimant
is admitted to prove the debt, whether by writ or
witnesses. He may even have the benefit of the
foreigner's oath, upon proper notice being given;
and if the foreigner neither appear personally,
nor grant a mandate to enter an appearance for
him, he is justly held as confessing the verity
of the debt. The debt being thus ascertained,
a decree is pronounced, not against the debtor,
but against the effects specified in the claim, or∣dering
them to be sold for the claimant's pay∣ment;
the surplus, if any be, to remain <HI>in ma∣nibus
curiae</HI> for the use of the debtor. Very
different is a process for payment against a per∣son
subject to the jurisdiction of the court. The
jurisdiction supports the personal citation: the ci∣tation
supports the decree against the defend∣ant;
and the decree supports execution, whe∣ther
against the defendant himself or against his
effects.</P>
<P>With respect to a process to make forthcoming
foreign moveables to a creditor, an arrestment of
the moveables is commonly the first step; because it
detains the moveables within the jurisdiction of the
court from which the arrestment issues; and upon
that circumstance all depends. The process of ad∣judication
or forthcoming follows; and if the judge
upon evidence be satisfied that the claim is just,
<PB N="143" REF="156"/>
he decrees these moveables to be made forthcoming
to the claimant for his payment. And this con∣cludes
the process; for there can be no decree a∣gainst
a man who is not subjected to the jurisdic∣tion
of the court.</P>
<P>It remains only to be observed, that the arrest∣ment,
though termed <HI>arrestum jurisdictionis
fundandae gratia,</HI> is not the foundation of the
jurisdiction: on the contrary, it implies a juris∣diction
already founded; as neither an arrestment
nor any other diligence can proceed but by autho∣rity
of a court having jurisdiction. The local si∣tuation
of the effects within the territory of the
judge, founds his jurisdiction over the effects,
though not over the person of the proprietor. It
is by virtue of his jurisdiction, that he grants
warrant for the arrestment; and the arrestment is
of no other use but to detain the goods within the
territory. It is indeed a step that a cautious man
will not omit; but the claim is well founded with∣out
it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Litiscontestation.</HEAD>
<P>WHile judges were arbiters merely, which
was their condition originally, litisconte∣station
was in reality a judicial contract; and the
decree differed not from a decreet-arbitral<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historical Law-tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>.
Jurisdiction arrived at greater perfection in course
of time: Judges were established by the sove∣reign,
to determine differences between parties,
with power to compel obedience. Consent was
no longer necessary; and litiscontestation ceased
to be a judicial contract. Lawyers call it now a
<HI>quasi-contract;</HI> a term approaching to a contract
in sound, but far distant from it in meaning, if it
have any meaning.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common in law, than effects
kept up after their causes have ceased. There
are accordingly regulations both in England and
Scotland, built evidently on the supposition of li∣tiscontestation
being a contract, as it was origi∣nally.
In the English form of process, if issue be
joined even on the slightest dilatory defence, it
concludes the cause. The defendant, succeeding
in his proof, is absolved: if he fail in his proof,
sentence passes against him, without permitting
<PB N="145" REF="158"/>
him to plead any other defence, peremptory or
dilatory. This cannot be explained upon any
principle, other than that litiscontestation is a con∣tract,
binding the parties that the proof shall de∣termine
the cause.</P>
<P>There are regulations of the same kind in Scot∣land.
Take the following instance. In a process
on the passive titles for payment of debt, the de∣fendant,
aware that the stating peremptory defen∣ces
would be a virtual acknowledgement of the
passive titles, keeps these in reserve, and betakes
himself to a denial of the passive titles. The pur∣suer
offers a proof of them: issue is joined, the
passive titles are proved; and a decree for pay∣ment
passes of course. The defendant applies to
the court against the judgement of the Ordinary,
and prays to be reponed to his peremptory de∣fences.
The answer commonly made, is, “That
the decree is regular; because litiscontestation
is a judicial contract, implying the defendant's
consent to pay the debt, if the passive titles
shall be proved against him; that the defend∣ant
may in equity be reponed, upon paying
the expence of the act; but that he must be
confined to an instant verification of his per∣emptory
defences, without being allowed a
new term for proving, as there cannot be two
acts of litiscontestation in the same cause.”
The practice accordingly is, to repone the de∣fendant
to his peremptory defences, con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining
<PB N="146" REF="159"/>
him to an instant verification of them, and ma∣king
him pay the expence of the act. This is
obviously a remnant of our old law, and a regu∣lar
proceeding when litiscontestation was really
a contract. But now that it has ceased to be a
contract, the defendant ought not to be barred,
either at common law or equity, from proving his
defences one after another. Why should he be
reduced to the necessity of joining issue on the
passive titles, and of losing his cause if the pas∣sive
titles be proved? Why not permit him to
plead, that though he is found liable for his pre∣decessor's
debts, yet that he has certain good
exceptions against the debt claimed? What has
he done to bar him from insisting on any excep∣tions
that he cannot instantly verify? And why
should he be subjected to the expence of the act?
Here is obviously a hovering between the old and
the new law; the former not totally laid aside,
nor the latter totally adopted.</P>
<P>With regard to form, there could not indeed
be two acts of litiscontestation, when the joining
issue on any fact implied a mutual consent that
the proof should conclude the cause. But as ju∣risdiction
at present requires no consent, I see no
absurdity in a plurality of litiscontestations. They
are hurtful, it is true, by swelling the expence,
and prolonging the process; but these inconve∣niencies
may be prevented, by a regulation that
all the defences shall be stated at the beginning of
<PB N="147" REF="160"/>
the cause, and that one act of litiscontestation
shall be pronounced upon such of them as require
proof. And where the defendant states his per∣emptory
defences by order of the court, his obe∣dience
to that order cannot infer an acknowledge∣ment
of the passive titles.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Whether action can be sustained to make
effectual a smuggling-contract.</HEAD>
<P>BY 11th George I. cap. 30. sect. 8. “No tea
shall be imported into this kingdom from
any place but that of its growth, on pain of
forfeiture.”</P>
<P>If it be unlawful to import tea except from
the place of its growth, no man can be bound
by a contract to import it. The contract is null
and void, as all contracts are that bind one to
transgress the law. There is another objection,
arising from the very nature of a court of justice.
Courts of justice are instituted, to enforce laws
natural and municipal, not to overturn them.
But to sustain action on such a contract, would be
to act in defiance of law: it would be a breach of
trust, of the same nature, though not the same in
degree, as to sustain action for a bribe to commit
murder or robbery.</P>
<P>This reasoning has prevailed on the judges of
the court of session, to deny action to natives up∣on
smuggling-contracts. But with respect to fo∣reigners,
who are not bound by the laws of Bri∣tain,
it continues to be a doubt, whether action
can justly be denied to them. For removing
<PB N="149" REF="162"/>
that doubt, the following considerations are sug∣gested.</P>
<P>In the first place, It is the privilege of every
state to regulate matters within its own territory.
The legislature may, in particular, prohibit cer∣tain
goods to be imported, whether by natives or
by foreigners, under certain penalties; which ob∣liges
every merchant to inform himself of the
commercial laws of the foreign countries in which
he traffics. If he go personally into a foreign
country, he is subjected to its laws; and if he
send goods there, they are equally subjected. Fo∣reigners
undoubtedly must submit themselves to
the laws of this country, as far as they act within
it.</P>
<P>Secondly, The law of nations, respecting the
municipal laws of every country, declares it an
act of injustice in a foreigner to attempt any vio∣lation
of them. It is wrong in a foreigner to fo∣ment
a rebellion in Britain, though he never set
foot in it; and it is equally wrong in him to hire
a person to commit murder in Britain. What
should be his punishment when found in this
kingdom, is not clearly established by the law of
nations; but that he merits some punishment,
will not be controverted. And it clearly follows,
that action ought not to be sustained to him here,
if he should think of claiming performance of a∣ny
covenant relative to the wrong done. This
must also hold, where he knowingly transgresses
<PB N="150" REF="163"/>
any law purely municipal, such as the smuggling
prohibited goods into Britain, or the being acces∣sory
to the smuggling.</P>
<P>And now more directly to the statute under
consideration. It is impersonally conceived, “That
no tea shall be imported into this kingdom but
from the place of its growth.” Here no dis∣tinction
of persons is made: the prohibition
reaches every person, native of foreigner. If a
Gottenburg merchant send a cargo of tea to his
correspondent in Britain, to be sold for his behoof,
the cargo is lawful seizure by statute; and is ac∣cordingly
condemned in exchequer, of which we
have daily instances. The cargo, till it be sold,
continues to be the property of the Gottenburg
merchant; and as no man can be forfeited of
his property who has committed no delict, it
must be admitted, if our law be just, that the fo∣reign
merchant has been guilty of a delict in land∣ing
his prohibited goods here. And that it is a
delict by the law of nations, is made evident a∣bove.</P>
<P>If the actual landing the cargo here be crimi∣nal,
a commission by the foreign merchant to his
factor here for smuggling the cargo, cannot be
innocent. It is wrong in several views: first, as
a means to an unlawful end; and, next, as an
accession to a crime, intended to be committed by
a native; for that the native is criminal, no per∣son
doubts. It follows, that the factor is not
<PB N="151" REF="164"/>
bound to fulfil the unlawful commission; and
that no action ought to be sustained against him
for damages.</P>
<P>I put another case. A merchant in Scotland
commissions a quantity of tea from a merchant in
Gottenburg. Ought action to be sustained to the
latter against the former, for the price of the tea
sent and received? This question will receive
different answers in different circumstances. A
commission for tea to be delivered to a shipmaster
named, without specifying the destination of the
vessel, is lawful; and the foreign merchant ought
to have action here, without being obliged to say
or to know what has become of the cargo. If it
have been smuggled into Scotland by the Scotch
merchant, his Gottenburg correspondent, who
had no accession to the wrong, is not answerable.
But where the Gottenburg merchant is informed
of his correspondent's intention to smuggle, and
takes measures accordingly for concealment, the
contract is unlawful on both sides. It is admitted
to be unlawful as to the Scotch merchant; and it
is unlawful as to the other in a double respect;
first, as violating the laws of Britain; and, next,
as an accession to the crime of the Scotch mer∣chant.
And our judges would be accessory to the
crime, if they should sustain action upon it. Here
the rule is applicable, That <HI>in turpi causa potior
est conditio possidentis.</HI> The case is in effect the
same, where the goods are commissioned to be
<PB N="152" REF="165"/>
imported into Britain, without mentioning that
they are intended to be smuggled. For the fo∣reign
merchant knows, or ought to know, that they
cannot be imported otherwise than by smuggling.</P>
<P>For illustrating this doctrine, I put a similar
case. In the year 1745, a number of Scotch re∣bels
commission from a merchant in Rotterdam a
cargo of powder, ball, and other warlike stores,
which he furnishes, knowing of the rebellion;
and after the rebellion is quashed, he brings his
action in the court of session for the price. Would
a British court sustain such an action? They
would be accessory to the wrong, if they did.
Common sense must suggest to the foreign mer∣chant,
that he who knowingly transgresses the law
of Britain, cannot expect the aid of that law to
make his transgression beneficial to him. We de∣ny
the benefit of our courts of justice to a nation
at war with us, however innocent the person may
be who brings the action. Is it not still more rea∣sonable
to deny that benefit to a foreigner, who
is not innocent, but has knowingly contemned
our law?</P>
<P>Suppose now the foreigner to have been igno∣rant
of the law prohibiting tea to be imported but
from the place of its growth. Will this intitle
him to an action for the price? I answer, that it
will not intitle him, more than it will intitle him
to the tea itself seized in Scotland. It was his
duty to have been better informed; and no man
<PB N="153" REF="166"/>
can avail himself of culpable ignorance. But
supposing his ignorance to be excusable, yet such
ignorance can only relieve from punishment: it
will not relieve a man even from damages; far
less will it intitle him to an action in contradiction
to the law of the land. To reward ignorance
with a privilege that knowledge is not intitled to,
would indeed be extremely Gothic.</P>
<P>I conclude with a separate consideration. For
performance of a smuggling-contract, action is
not sustained to a native against a foreigner; and
it would be inconsistent with the rules of equity,
to sustain action to the latter against the former.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How far writs are probative.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of promises and convenants makes
a branch of Historical Law-tracts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tract 2.</NOTE>; parti∣cularly,
the history of the writ termed in England
a <HI>bond in judgement,</HI> and in Scotland a <HI>regi∣strable
bond.</HI> Some few gleanings only remain,
chiefly with regard to the noted exception, <HI>Non
est factum.</HI></P>
<P>In the tract quoted, it is laid down, that before
the art of writing was common, a writ was vouch∣ed
by the seal of the granter; and that if he ac∣knowledged
the seal to be his, the writ was good
evidence against him. Thus, Glanvil, “Ubi si∣gillum
suum esse publice recognoverit in curia,
cartam illam precise tenetur warrantizare, et
conventionem in ipsa carta expressam, omnino
servare sine contradictione<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">l. 10. cap. 12.; Reg. Maj. l. 3. cap. 8.</NOTE>.” But if the de∣fendant
denied the seal to be his, or <HI>quod non
est factum,</HI> as expressed in England; the plain∣tiff
was burdened with proving, that it was the
defendant's seal. This fact being proved, the
sealing was presumed to be the operation of the
defendant; unless he could bring positive evi∣dence,
<PB N="155" REF="168"/>
that the seal was stolen from him, and ap∣plied
by another hand.</P>
<P>The statute 117. parl. 1540, on a preamble
that a seal may be lost or forged, enacts, “That
in time coming, no faith be given to any wri∣ting
under seal, without subscription of the par∣ty.”
Here, the acknowledging the subscrip∣tion
vouches the deed, as the acknowledging the
seal did formerly. And it also banishes all suspi∣cion
of falsehood, as a man's suscription cannot
be stolen, though his seal may.</P>
<P>An explicit acknowledgement of the seal or
subscription, is not requisite to found a decree.
An implied acknowledgement is sufficient, im∣plied
from pleading other defences, and forbear∣ing
to plead <HI>quod non est factum.</HI> But as a seal
at a writ is no evidence that the impression was
made by the seal of the defendant; so the letters
of the defendant's name at the foot make not e∣vidence
that the subscription is his: the objection
<HI>quod non est factum</HI> is competent equally in both
cases; and the objection is a negative, which
burdens the plaintiff with proving the subscription
to be the defendant's. Thus in a process against
me for payment of the sum in a bill of exchange
or promissory note, the letters of my name at the
foot afford not evidence that the subscription is
mine; and for that reason, I am admitted to
plead <HI>quod non est factum.</HI> So far the law of
England and of Scotland are the same.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="169"/>
The law of England admits not a decree in ab∣sence.
In Scotland, a decree in absence is effec∣tual;
and such a decree, founded even on a bill
of exchange, or on a promissory note, may be
carried to execution. From the defendant's de∣clining
to appear, the subscription at the bill or
promissory note, is presumed to be his.</P>
<P>The law of England continues the same to this
day, with respect to every sort of writ, excepting
a bond in judgement, where it is a rule, That
matters of record prove themselves, and admit not
any averment against them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Abridgement of the law, vol. 2. p. 306.</NOTE>. But in Scotland,
the act 1681, requiring witnesses to subscribe, has
produced an alteration. The subscriptions of the
witnesses vouch the subscription of the party;
which bars him from pleading, <HI>Non est factum,</HI>
and obliges him to undertake a proof that the
writ is forged. But this alteration takes place on∣ly
in writs that require witnesses. Other writs,
such as bills and promissory notes, stand on their
original footing.</P>
<P>A difference takes place in our practice, be∣tween
a writ having a clause of registration, and
a writ requiring witnesses, but not having a clause
of registration. The former cannot be challen∣ged
but in a regular process of improbation; but
against the latter improbation may be proponed
as an exception<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stair, book 4. tit. 4. sect. 39. 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="170"/>
Of writs that require not witnesses, several are
probative <HI>per se;</HI> and admit not the defence of
<HI>Non est factum,</HI> more than when there are subscri∣bing
witnesses. A holograph writ is one of these:
it is presumed to be genuine from the difficulty
of forging a writ of any length; and to overturn
that presumption, a proof of forgery is required.
The party's subscription to an account of furnish∣ings
is another instance; the subscription being
fortified by the account. A receipt of rent by a
landlord to his tenant, is a third instance. That
it is the landlord's subscription, is vouched by
several collateral circumstances, the extent of the
rent due, the known term of payment, and the
practice of paying regularly. I shall add but one
instance more, which is, a missive letter, especially
<HI>in re mercatoria.</HI> Merchants have not leisure for
holograph missives; and yet missives are essential
in commerce.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Qualified oath.</HEAD>
<P>WHen in a process a fact is referred to the
oath of the pursuer or defendant, he who
gives the oath may have occasion to qualify it by
the addition of circumstances. Where the cir∣cumstances
added are intimately connected with
the fact acknowledged, so as to require no proof
but the oath itself, they are termed <HI>intrinsic qua∣lities:</HI>
where they require other proof, they are
termed <HI>extrinsic qualities.</HI> The following consi∣derations
may tend to explain the difference.</P>
<P>First, Where the libel is referred to the oath
of the defendant, every fact or circumstance men∣tioned
in the oath that resolves into a denial of the
libel, is intrinsic; because, if the libel be not pro∣ved,
an absolvitor follows.</P>
<P>Second, Whatever is a proper cross interroga∣tory
to a witness, may be added by the defend∣ant
to his oath. For had the pursuer taken a
proof by witnesses, it would have been compe∣tent
to the defendant to put cross interrogatories;
and he must not be cut out of his privilege by
being chosen as the only witness.</P>
<P>Third, If an agreement be referred to the oath
of the defendant, every circumstance is intrin∣sic
<PB N="159" REF="172"/>
that imports it to have been altered, or passed
from; for such circumstance is in effect <HI>pars e∣jusdem
negotii.</HI> But where the agreement is
fulfilled, and brought to its final conclusion, no
after alteration adjected to the oath is intrinsic.
Thus, where a bargain for a horse, with delivery,
is referred to the defendant's oath, in order to
recover the price, if the bargain and delivery be
acknowledged, which fulfil the bargain on the
pursuer's part, an addition to the oath, that the
bargain was afterward passed from, and the horse
redelivered, is not <HI>pars ejusdem negotii,</HI> but
must be proved otherwise than by the oath.</P>
<P>Fourth, If the libel be not relevant as laid, the
defendant may either object to the relevancy, and
refuse to depone; or he may add circumstances
to his oath, that resolve in a denial of the libel as
it ought to have been laid; and these circumstan∣ces
will be intrinsic.</P>
<P>Fifth, Where a defendant has exceptions a∣gainst
a relevant libel referred to his oath, he
ought to state these exceptions before deponing,
in order that the pursuer may take another mean
of proof, if he be unwilling that the exception
should be proved by the defendant's oath, as well
as the libel. See act of sederunt, 7th Decem∣ber
1613. From this act we learn, that if the
defendant be permitted to depone after stating
his exceptions, and insert these exceptions in his
oath, they will be held as intrinsic. But if <HI>rest∣ing
<PB N="160" REF="173"/>
owing</HI> simply be referred to oath, there is no
need beforehand to state any exception subversive
of the debt, payment, for example, or innova∣tion.
For as the defendant is at liberty to deny
<HI>resting owing</HI> simply, he is at liberty to mention
in his oath, the facts that prove the debt not to
be <HI>resting owing.</HI> Here a difference is made in
our dicisions, between extinguishing the debt by
payment in money, and extinguishing it by deli∣vering
goods in satisfaction. The latter is not
sustained as intrinsic; for what good reason, I have
not discovered.</P>
<P>Sixth, If the defendant add to his oath an ex∣ception
that is not competent to be proved by
witnesses, it will be rejected as extrinsic. Ex∣ample:
A bond of borrowed money being lost,
the debt is referred to the defendant's oath. An
addition to the oath, That the debt was paid, is
not intrinsic. For he cannot prove, by his own
oath, what is not competent for him to prove by
witnesses; and if he neglected to take a written
document of the payment, he has nothing left
for proof but the pursuer's oath. But the fol∣lowing
addition will be intrinsic, That the bond
was not lost, but delivered up to him the defend∣ant
upon payment. The like in a forthcoming at
the instance of an arrester, who refers the debt to
the oath of the arrestee, because he is not possess∣ed
of the bond.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="174"/>
The foregoing rules are also, in a good mea∣sure,
applicable for determining the difference be∣tween
intrinsic and extrinsic qualities, in an oath
emitted by the pursuer upon a reference by the
defendant.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evidence with respect to deathbed.</HEAD>
<P>PRoperty originally included not a power to a∣lien,
but only to use and enjoy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historical Law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>. But as
this was a restraint against nature, it crept in gra∣dually,
that a man might dispose upon small por∣tions
of his heritage for necessary causes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. l. 2. cap. 18.</NOTE>. At
the same time, this innovation was permitted with
so great reserve, that such a deed was not sus∣tained,
if executed in deadly sickness, as the law
expresses it, or on deathbed. “Where a man
in deadly sickness makes an alienation, which
in health he did not think of, the same is pre∣sumed
to be done through trouble of mind,
and not deliberately<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">§ 9. of the law above quoted.</NOTE>.” Liberty to dispose
of a part for necessary causes, was enlarged
by degrees, till it became law, that property
includes a power of alienation, and that it may
be disposed of without any cause but the will
of the proprietor. In every step however that
extended property, the prohibition of aliening in
deadly sickness, or on deathbed, continued inva∣riable.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="176"/>
It may be doubted here, whether it be the in∣tention
of the law, to bind up the hands of a
man on deathbed from making any deed, how∣ever
sound of mind, or however rational the deed
may be; or whether it be only the intention of
the law, to infer a presumption, that the deed was
done <HI>through trouble of mind, and not delibe∣rately.</HI>
Upon the first supposition, the deed is
<HI>ipso jure</HI> null, as if done by an infant, or by a
man in a delirium. Upon the other supposition,
the deed being granted by one who has power of
alienation, must be effectual against all the world,
except against the heir, who can challenge the
deed as done through trouble of mind, and not
deliberately.</P>
<P>That the law of deathbed infers only a ground
of reduction, will be evident from the following
considerations. 1st, That no person is intitled to
challenge a deathbed-deed except the heir, is an
established rule; and it is equally established,
that the heir is barred from the challenge by the
negative prescription of forty years. My next
authority is drawn from a case observed by Had∣dington,
3d December 1608, Gilbert Supplicant.
The case was this: A man bedfast with the gout,
finding it necessary to sell land for payment of
debt, and fearing that people would scruple to
deal with him in that condition; the court, on
his supplication, directed some of their number
to visit him; and they reporting, that though he
<PB N="164" REF="177"/>
could not use his limbs, his memory and judge∣ment
were entire; the judges declared, that the
alienation to be made by him should not be redu∣cible
<HI>ex capite lecti.</HI> This was a singular case,
which showed the sense of the court in the strong∣est
manner, that deathbed infers only a presump∣tion
of weakness of mind, which must yield to a
direct proof of the contrary; and the proof in
this case satisfied all the judges.</P>
<P>It is extremely right, that a man on deathbed,
like a minor, or a person fatuous, should be under
the protection of the law, to secure him against
designing persons, who would lay hold of his
weakness to make him do what he would abhor
in found health; but if this protection were car∣ried
so far, as to cut down every deed done on
deathbed, without regard to circumstances, it
might occasion much wrong, without any sub∣stantial
good. I instance intermitting diseases,
where a man is well and ill by turns, the ague,
the gravel, the gout, the asthma, &amp;c. In the
course of an ague, a man makes a deed in the
intermitting day, in perfect health, and soundness
of mind. But the ague wears him out, and he
dies unexpectedly within threescore days. He
happens not to go to kirk or market; but in his
intermitting days, he goes abroad, is accessible
to all the world, and follows out his ordinary oc∣cupations,
as before he was seized with the dis∣ease.
It would be unreasonable to forbid a proof
<PB N="165" REF="178"/>
by unsuspected witnesses, that he was of found
judgement when he made the deed. This rea∣soning
is equally applicable to the other diseases
mentioned.</P>
<P>Taking it now for granted, that the law of
deathbed infers a presumption only, which may
be redargued by a proof to the contrary, the
next question is, What proof is sufficient? I ob∣serve
with satisfaction, that our law is justly sus∣picious
of acts of reconvalescence alledged to be
done <HI>intra parietes,</HI> offered to be proved by no
witnesses but those that are chosen by the grant∣er,
or by those having undue influence over him,
all other persons being kept at a distance. Craig<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 1. dieg. 13. § 36.</NOTE>
handles this point with accuracy. After obser∣ving,
that it is only called <HI>lectus aegritudinis</HI>
where the disease proves mortal; he lays it
down, that if the granters recover so as to go to
church, to market, or to other public place, he
is held not to have been <HI>in lecto aegritudinis.</HI>
But what, says he, if the granter be in such a
condition as not to be able to go abroad? He
informs us, that some were of opinion, that a
proof of the granter's being in sound judgement
would support the deed; and adds, that different
judgements had been given upon that point in
the court of session. He gives his opinion against
such a proof; because, says he, where a man
<PB N="166" REF="179"/>
confined to the house makes an irrational deed,
it is presumed to have been the effect of undue
influence, which men are subject to at the last
stage of life, though they may otherwise be <HI>sanae
mentis;</HI> and that it would be unsafe to trust wit∣nesses
who are chosen by the man himself, or by his
advisers. This opinion has justly prevailed in our
practice: Durie, 1st February 1622, Robertson
<HI>contra</HI> Fleming; Durie, 7th January 1724,
Shaw <HI>contra</HI> Gray; Durie, penult July 1636,
Richardson <HI>contra</HI> Sinclair; Stair, 25th Februa∣ry
1668, Dun <HI>contra</HI> Dun; Harcus, (<HI>Lectus ae∣gritudinis</HI>),
February 1683, Daughters of Moun∣tainhall.
In this last case, it is observed by the
Collector, that “equipollent acts are not to be
sustained, unless having the essential qualities
of being at kirk and market, viz. their being
performed before many indifferent witnesses.”</P>
<P>But where acts are done publicly, in presence
of unsuspected witnesses, a proof of reconvales∣cence
is always admitted. Craig, in the passage
above cited, is of that opinion; and that opinion is
followed in our practice. The following qualifica∣tions
to bar a reduction <HI>ex capite lecti</HI> were admit∣ted
to proof, viz. That the disponer, several weeks
after the disposition, had sitten in his shop, and
sold his goods; and that he had walked before his
shop-door, and bought a suit of cloaths in the
next shop; seeing that, being a Quaker, he did
not go to church: Harcus (<HI>Lectus aegritudinis</HI>),
<PB N="167" REF="180"/>
February 1683, Livingston <HI>contra</HI> Goodale. The
following acts to prove reconvalescence, were sus∣tained
equivalent to the going to kirk or market,
viz. the going from Edinburgh to Inverkeithing
to assist at the election of a commissioner to par∣liament,
spending the whole day in a boat at sea
for diversion, walking in the Lady Home's gar∣den,
and visiting prisoners in the tolbooth; Foun∣tainhall,
21st February 1694, Tillicheuen <HI>contra</HI>
Innermaith.</P>
<P>It will illustrate this doctrine, to compare a dis∣position
of moveables upon deathbed, with that
of land in the same circumstances. Excepting
arms and horses for war, our moveables in an∣cient
times were of very little value; and men
were permitted to dispose of them at pleasure.
A disposition therefore of moveables on death∣bed
is sustained: no objection lies against it, ex∣cept
that the granter was not <HI>compos mentis.</HI>
A disposition of land on deathbed is very differ∣ent.
It is presumed, that the granter was not of
a disposing mind; and reduction follows, un∣less
it can be proved, that he was of sound judge∣ment.</P>
<P>Most of the cases that belong to the law of
deathbed, terminate in presumptions that can be
redargued by a proof to the contrary. In our
old practice, the law of deathbed was frequently
applied to cut down deeds granted years before
death. This latitude was corrected by act 4.
<PB N="168" REF="181"/>
parl. 1696, barring reduction where a man lives
threescore days after the deed challenged, though
he neither go to church nor market. The in∣tendment
of this statute, is to infer a presumption
of reconvalescence, if the maker of the deed live
sixty days after it. But it admits this presump∣tion
to be redargued, by a proof that the man
was not sound in judgement when he made the
deed. Does it not follow from these premises,
that though he die within sixty days, yet the deed
ought to be sustained, if it can be proved by un∣suspected
witnesses, that he was of sound judge∣ment
when it was made? It would be a strange
partiality, to admit a proof for redarguing the
presumption of reconvalescence, where the grant∣er
lives threescore days; and yet to forbid a proof
for redarguing the presumption of the granter's
being unsound in judgement, where he dies with∣in
the threescore days. The presumption of re∣convalescence
from going to kirk or market, falls
under the same plan of evidence. Lunatics are
attacked with fits of delirium at intervals. An
irrational deed is made in one of these fits; and
when the granter returns to his senses, he has no
memory of what he has done. In his intervals
he goes both to kirk and market as usual, but
dies withing threescore days. The going to kirk
or market supports the irrational deed, upon the
presumption of reconvalescence. It will however
not be doubted, that this presumption may be
<PB N="169" REF="182"/>
redargued by an offer to prove, that the man
was actually in a delirium when the deed was
made.</P>
<P>A singular case of deathbed is a gradual decay
of nature from old age, where a man, without
any disease, turns weaker and weaker, till the
lamp of life be extinguished. This case may be
attended with various circumstances. Sometimes
the mind wears out before the body, which was
the case of the great Duke of Marlborough: they
often wear out together. But the most ordinary
case is, that the bodily faculties are at the lowest
state, while those of the mind are entire, though
less vigorous than in the meridian of life. A man
in this condition makes a rational deed, and dies
within threescore days. It cannot be said, that
he was on deathbed; for it is supposed that he
was going about, and attending his affairs, as
usual, spending no more time in bed than neces∣sary
for the ordinary recruit of sleep. A decay
of nature commences commonly years before it
end in death: where shall we fix the commence∣ment
of deathbed? But without going nicely or
strictly to work, it must be admitted, that a man
in the last stage of life, though afflicted with no
disease, is more liable to seduction than in vigour
of mind; and upon that account deserves, like a
minor at least, to be taken under the protection
of law. In this condition, the presumption that
he was not of a disposing mind when the deed
<PB N="170" REF="183"/>
was granted, takes place; to redargue which, a
proof to the contrary ought to be admitted. And
considering how little influence, in many instan∣ces,
old age has on the mental faculties, there is
not another case, where a proof ought more
chearfully to be admitted by unsuspected witnesses,
for redarguing the presumption of weakness of
mind. A decay in a young man seldom disables
him to go to kirk or market; which will defeat
a challenge on deathbed, though he die within
sixty days. Now, the going to a kirk or a mar∣ket,
is not, in common sense, so pregnant evi∣dence
of the granter's being entire in judgement,
as a proof by physicians, surgeons, or other un∣suspected
witnesses.</P>
<P>The case last mentioned is that of Faichney.
He died of old age after a gradual decline, like a
lamp after the oil is spent. Nor was his life a∣bridged
a moment by any disease. His physician
depones, indeed, that he was apprehensive of a
palsy; but he was in a mistake, for there was no
palsy. Faichney was not beset by any designing
persons, to bias him against what he thought
right. He was accessible to all the world, none
being refused access to him. He went both to
church and market; perhaps supported, for the
proof of that circumstance is not clear. But his
going to kirk and market, is however evidence of
his not shunning to show himself publicly. He
certainly did not keep at home, in order that
<PB N="171" REF="184"/>
there might be no witness but of his own chusing.
The proof by his physician and surgeon, of his
being sound in judgement when he granted the
deed challenged, is satisfactory. Nor is their evi∣dence
redargued by the witnesses who depone,
that he looked pale and weakly, like a dying
man; because that is frequently the case of the
body, when the mind is entire. And lastly, the
settlement challenged was a rational and pru∣dent
deed, perhaps the most prudent that could
be devised by any man in Faichney's circumstan∣ces.
The deed, notwithstanding, was, in July 1776,
reduced, as granted on deathbed. The judges
were averse to any argument that might weaken
the salutary law of deathbed.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Original form of a suspension.</HEAD>
<P>IN our present practice, a suspension stays per∣sonal
execution till it be discussed. But for
many years after a suspension was introduced, the
effect was different. It contained originally a
warrant for citing the creditor to appear in the
court of sesson the fifteenth day after its date,
suspending and discharging personal execution for
ten days more. If the suspension was not
brought into court withing that time, personal ex∣ecution
proceeded. In that view, when a suspen∣sion
was obtained in vacation, or at the end of a ses∣sion,
the warrant was granted for citing the cre∣ditor
to the first day of the following term, sus∣pending
and discharching personal execution for
ten days more, as in the other case.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Res judicata.</HEAD>
<P>IT belongs to the legislature to announce what
is right and wrong; what ought to be done,
and what ought not to be done: and the acts of
the legislature bind every member of the state.
The power of courts of law, is far from being so
extensive. A judge can declare what is right
and wrong, in every process brought before him.
His opinion so far makes law; but in every other
respect, it is no better than the opinion of a pri∣vate
person. Hence the maxim in the Roman
law, <HI>Res inter alios judicata, aliis nec obest nec
prodest.</HI> This maxim shall be illustrated in va∣rious
cases.</P>
<P>I begin with a decree-condemnatory. This de∣cree,
as observed, makes law between the liti∣gants,
both as to relevancy and proof; but has
no authority in a new process, not even between
the same parties. A proof by witnesses is com∣plete
evidence in the process where it is taken;
but in no other process. Thus, a decree hold∣ing
the defendant confessed on the passive titles,
was not sustained as probative of the passive
titles in another process against him, though
<PB N="174" REF="187"/>
the same person was pursuer in both processes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, 20th November 1629, Lundie <HI>contra</HI> Lundie.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But though at common law, a proof in a pro∣cess-condemnatory,
is not held <HI>pro veritate</HI> in any
other process; yet, for the ease of the witnesses
and for saving expence, the court of session, as a
court of equity, permits the proof to be trans∣mitted
into a new process, and to be founded on
<HI>per modum probationis;</HI> provided the new pro∣cess
be between the same parties; but with liber∣ty
to the defendant to move every objection a∣gainst
the depositions, that would be relevant a∣gainst
the witnesses, were they called into court
to depone a second time. A sentence of banish∣ment
in a criminal trial at the instance of a pri∣vate
party, with concourse of the King's Advo∣cate,
having been pronounced in the court of ju∣sticiary
against a criminal, upon a clear proof of
theft and robbery; the proof, by authority of
the court of session, was transmitted into a new
process between the same parties, for reparation
and damages<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">January 1731, Bunten <HI>contra</HI> Buchanan.</NOTE>. And it being objected, That a
witness who had deponed in the court of justiciary
was rendered infamous after emitting his deposi∣tion,
the objection was sustained to render it in∣valid
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">19th December 1737, <HI>inter eosdem.</HI></NOTE>. For as, in strict law, no proof is sus∣tained
but what is taken in presence of the judge,
<PB N="175" REF="188"/>
equity will not relax so far from this rule, as to
give faith to a deposition when the witness him∣self
would not be listened to. In the same man∣ner,
a process of count and reckoning, which had
depended before arbiters but without a final
sentence, being brought before the court of ses∣sion,
a proof taken in the submission was admit∣ted
as evidence; reserving all objections against
the same, and reserving also to both parties a re∣examination
of the witnesses that were alive. They
were also allowed to bring an additional proof, if
necessary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">15th December 1733, Captain Chalmers <HI>contra</HI> Sir James Cuningham.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But such a proof is not commonly sustained in
a new process, where either the pursuer or de∣fendant
is different. And accordingly it is a rule,
That a proof by witnesses of the passive title
<HI>gestio pro herede,</HI> or vicious intromission, is not
evidence in another process at the instance of a
different pursuer. Yet the transmission of depo∣sitions
in this case, seems no less rational than
where both pursuer and defendant are the same.
For if the pursuer be satisfied to join issue upon
depositions taken in a process where he was not
a party, the defendant, who was a party, ought
to have no objection; provided he be allowed to
object against the depositions, as against the wit∣nesses
themselves. And from a case reported
<PB N="176" REF="189"/>
by Lord Stair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">13th January 1675, Glendinning <HI>contra</HI> Earl Niths∣dale.</NOTE>, it appears, that this had been
frequently practised. But the practice ought not
to be indulged, where the defendant is different;
it would be too wide a stretch, to sustain deposi∣tions
against a party who had no opportunity to
put cross interrogatories to the witnesses. Thus,
a decree proving the tenor of a bond against one
of the obligants, being produced as proof in a
process of proving the tenor against the other obli∣gant,
the pursuer was not permitted to found up∣on
his decree as evidence; which obliged him
to take a new proof<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Newbyth, 1st February 1665, Broomhall <HI>contra</HI> Marquis of Douglas; Stair; Dirleton, 13th January 1675, Glendinning <HI>contra</HI> Earl Nithsdale.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I observe with regret, that the court has not al∣ways
been so chaste. In a train of decisions it
has been found, that where the superior's right
is reduced, the decree is <HI>res judicata</HI> against his
vassals, though not made parties in the process.
And that a decreet of reduction of a tack, is e∣qually
<HI>res judicata</HI> against subtenants<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Dict. of Dec. <HI>Res inter alios,</HI> sect. <HI>Res judicata.</HI></NOTE>. Where
a tacksman removes after his tack expires, whe∣ther
voluntarily, or by a decree of removing, his
subtenants, who can have no pretext to continue
possession, may be removed at short hand. But
supposing a tack to be reduced at the instance of
<PB N="177" REF="190"/>
the landlord upon fraud or other ground of re∣duction,
<HI>Quaeritur,</HI> Can subtenants be removed at
short hand? If the tacksman had no power to
subset, they may be so removed; because they
have no right to continue possession of another
man's property against his will. But if the tacks∣man
had a power to subset, they cannot be so re∣moved:
they have a title to possess derived from
the landlord himself. The judgement against the
tacksman is <HI>res inter alios</HI> as to them. There must
therefore be a new process against the subtenants;
in which they will be admitted to support the
tacksman's right, notwithstanding the <HI>res judica∣ta</HI>
against him. And in this particular, subvassals
are precisely similar to subtenants. Upon re∣demption
of a wadset, the wadsetter's tenants,
and also his feuers, may be removed <HI>brevi manu</HI>
at the next term. But supposing, that a man in
possession upon a title of property, has created
feus, or other subaltern rights; a reduction of
his right by a person producing what appears to
be a preferable title, will not intitle that person
to turn out <HI>brevi manu</HI> those who have subaltern
rights. A process is necessary against them, in
which they will be admitted to support the right
of their author. But is a reduction of the au∣thor's
right effectual against a purchaser, who has
only a disposition, or a minute of sale? The
doubt is, that a subtenant or subvassal in possession
is known, and may be made a party in the reduc∣tion;
<PB N="178" REF="191"/>
which is not the case of a disponee without
infeftment. But even here the maxim stands
good, That a <HI>res judicata</HI> cannot affect third
parties. Nor is there any hardship: for the re∣ducer,
by taking infeftment, acquires the civil pos∣session
of the land; which will force the dispo∣nee
to become pursuer, if he have any prospect
to support his author's right.</P>
<P>A decree against the principal debtor, was of
old held to be <HI>res judicata</HI> against the cautioner;
as if <HI>res judicata</HI> were effectual against all the
world, like an act of parliament. But that opi∣nion
wore away; and at present it is established,
that a decree against the principal debtor, is not
<HI>res judicata</HI> against the cautioner, either as to re∣levancy
or proof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 28th December 1709, Hamilton <HI>contra</HI> Calder.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next in order come the effects of a decreet-absolvitor;
first, with respect to a new process be∣tween
the same parties; and, next, where the
pursuer or defendant is different. With respect
to a new process between the same parties, an
absolvitor from defect of proof, must be distinguish∣ed
from an absolvitor from defect of relevan∣cy.
Where the pursuer fails in proving, it was
a rule in the Roman law, That he is not per∣mitted
to renew the action, even on production of
a writ <HI>noviter veniens ad notitiam</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">l. 35. De re judicata.</NOTE>. This
<PB N="179" REF="192"/>
rule is evidently a remnant of the old law, which
held a decree to be equivalent to a decreet-arbi∣tral,
or a transaction <HI>de re dubia,</HI> putting a
final end to the claim. But as a decree in our
present practice depends on the authority of the
judge, his authority is confined to the evidence
produced in the process; and therefore cannot
bar a new production upon which the judge had
no opportunity to give an opinion. For that
reason, the court, in a new process having the
same conclusion, admit writs <HI>noviter venientia ad
notitiam</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, 22d June 1681, Paton <HI>contra</HI> Stirling.</NOTE>. The same reason, it is true, would
admit a new proof by witnesses: but a more
weighty reason on the opposite side excludes such
a proof, viz. the danger of subornation and per∣jury.
Such a proof is not permitted even in the
same process, except in very favourable circum∣stances
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Dictionary, <HI>Process,</HI> sect. <HI>Incident diligence.</HI></NOTE>. As there is not the same danger,
where the facts offered to be proved are different
from what were formerly the subject of proof,
the court frequently gives way to a proof of such
facts in the same process<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dictionary, <HI>Process,</HI> sect. <HI>Competent and omitted.</HI></NOTE>. But I know no
example of admitting such proof in a new process.</P>
<P>We proceed to an absolvitor from a process as
irrelevant. Such absolvitor will not bar a new
process between the same parties, inferring the
<PB N="180" REF="193"/>
same conclusion from a different medium. Thus,
in a reduction of a disposition on the act 1621,
the defence was, That an absolvitor had formerly
been pronounced against the pursuer in a process
for reducing the disposition on the head of inhi∣bition;
and that it would make law-suits endless
to admit a new ground of reduction. The court
was of opinion, that <HI>competent and omitted</HI> bars
only the defendant, not the pursuer, against
whom no suspicion lies of willingly protracting
his cause; and therefore, that a pursuer may in∣sist
upon any new ground of law that was omit∣ted
in a former process<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 27th December 1692, Kinloch <HI>con∣tra</HI> Oliphant.</NOTE>. This opinion is clear∣ly
founded on the doctrine above laid down:
<HI>res judicata</HI> has no authority except with re∣spect
to the points determined; for so far only
did the judge interpose his authority.</P>
<P>If the conclusion be also different, there can
be no reason for sustaining the <HI>exceptio rei judi∣catae.</HI>
“Si quis interdicto egerit de possessione,
postea in rem agens, non repellitur per excep∣tionem;
quoniam in interdicto, possessio, in
actione, proprietas vertitur<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">l. 14. § 3. De except. rei jud.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Having discussed a new process having the
same conclusion, but upon a different medium,
and also a new process with a different con∣clusion;
there remains only a third variety;
<PB N="181" REF="194"/>
which is, that the new process is the same
with the former, except as to the pursuer's title.
Take the following example. Being served heir
in general to my father and subjected to all his
debts, I bring a reduction, on the head of fraud
and circumvention, of an heritable bond granted
by him; and an absolvitor goes against me for
want of sufficient proof. I afterward complete
my right by infeftment to the land upon which
the heritable bond is secured: and in order to
disburden my estate of the bond, I bring a fresh
reduction, upon the same medium, but without
offering any additional proof, either by writ or
witnesses. Will the <HI>exceptio rei judicatae</HI> be
sustained against me? The present process is
founded on my right of property; my former,
upon my right to be relieved from payment of
an unjust debt; and therefore, in strict law, the
exception militates not. But upon the principle
of expediency it ought to be sustained: a regu∣lar
sentence stands against me, finding there is no
evidence of the fraud and circumvention. I have
no reason to expect an alteration; and I ought
not to distress my party by a new process, when
I have no rational prospect of success.</P>
<P>So much where the process is between the same
parties. What remains is the effect of an absol∣vitor,
where the new process is carried on by a
different pursuer, or against a different defendant.
I consider not representatives to be different per∣sons:
<PB N="182" REF="195"/>
an <HI>exceptio rei judicatae,</HI> if available a∣gainst
the pursuer himself, must be equally so a∣gainst
his representatives. I can think but of
one exception; and that is, where the decree is
founded on a curcumstance personal to the pursuer
or to the defendant. For example, if the absol∣vitor
proceed upon a promise made by the pur∣suer,
that he himself shall not demand payment,
the <HI>exceptio rei judicatae</HI> will not bar his repre∣sentatives.
And if the absolvitor proceed on a
promise made to the defendant, that the sum shall
not be demanded while he is alive, the <HI>exceptio
rei judicatae</HI> will not benefit his heirs or caution∣ers.</P>
<P>Instances are not rare, of a process being re∣newed
by others than the pursuer of the first pro∣cess,
or his representatives. Against such the
<HI>exceptio rei judicatae</HI> will not operate; because,
as observed above, the opinion of a judge makes
law between the litigants only, and their heirs.
Thus, in a suit upon the passive titles by a credi∣tor
of the predecessor against his representatives,
and absolvitor will not bar another creditor insist∣ing
in a process of the same kind. Nor will an
absolvitor in a process of usury by a private party,
bar the King's Advocate insisting <HI>ad vindictam
publicam</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, 8th March 1623, King's Advocate <HI>contra</HI> Morison.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="196"/>
Though from the nature of a process, the <HI>ex∣ceptio
rei judicatae</HI> cannot operate in a pro∣cess
of the same kind carried on by a differ∣ent
pursuer; it deserves consideration, whether,
in some cases, it ought not to operate in equity.
I give, for example, a reduction on the head of
deathbed, in which an absolvitor goes against the
heir-apparent, who is the pursuer. After his
death, the same process is competent at the in∣stance
of the heir-apparent next in order; and as
he represents not the former pursuer, the absolvi∣tor
will not avail against him. And though the
disponee prevail also in this process, yet he lies o∣pen
to new processes while any person ramains
who can claim as heir to the disponer. One thing
is evident, that in this reduction there can lie no
suspicion of collusion to bar an equitable remedy;
for it cannot be the intention of the heir who
brings the reduction, to secure the disponee by a
simulate process, when he can secure him openly
by a ratification, without needing to put on a
mask. Two reasons concur in equity to support
the <HI>exceptio rei judicatae</HI> against every subse∣quent
heir. First, the hazard of bribery and
perjury, where the same facts are admitted to
probation a second time; and, next, the insup∣portable
hardship of subjecting the disponee to re∣ductions
without end.</P>
<P>An absolvitor in a process of irritancy carried
on against a tenant in tail by the immediate sub∣stitute,
<PB N="184" REF="197"/>
will not, after that substitute's death, bar
a new process upon the same facts carried on by
the substitute next in order. The new process
is not barred at common law, because an absol∣vitor
has no effect but against the parties engaged
in the process; nor is it barred in equity, be∣cause
the former process may have been collusive.
This is one of many hardships that a tenant in
tail is subjected to.</P>
<P>The defendant, in a reduction upon either of
the bankrupt statutes, is in a still worse condition.
Any one creditor may bring a reduction of an
alienation made by the debtor, on the medium of
his insolvency; and an absolvitor against one cre∣ditor,
avails not against any other. Against this
hardship, which may be intolerable, law knows
no remedy.</P>
<P>In a former article<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article 21.</NOTE>, mention is made of ac∣tions
founded on personal privileges, such as, a
reduction on the head of deathbed, on that of
minority and lesion, on interdiction, &amp;c.; and it
is there observed, that if the privileged person re∣fuse
to insist, a court of equity will authorise his
creditors to insist in his name. And now, with
respect to an absolvitor in such a process, I in∣quire
whether an action of that kind ought to be
sustained to every single creditor, or whether it
be necessary that all who are known must join in
<PB N="185" REF="198"/>
the process. To sustain action at the instance of
a single creditor, may subject the defendant to
an action at the instance of every creditor; which
a court of equity will never countenance. There∣fore,
to secure the defendant as much as possible,
without forfeiting the creditors, the court may
justly refuse to sustain the action, till all the cre∣ditors
be advertised edictally, to concur. And if
an absolvitor be obtained, the <HI>exceptio rei judi∣catae</HI>
ought to be sustained even against those who
did not concur.</P>
<P>If the next in kin, instead of confirming, take
out a licence to pursue, and upon that title insist
in a process against a party supposed to be debtor
to the deceased; will an absolvitor in that process
secure the defendant, when the pursuer dies with∣out
confirmation? It will not: the debt lies still
open to be confirmed by the succeeding next in
kin; and against him the absolvitor does not o∣perate.
The commissaries therefore ought to a∣void
giving a licence, if the circumstances be not
highly favourable. It is hard indeed to oblige the
pursuer to confirm a doubtful claim, which, after
an expensive process, may produce nothing: on
the other hand, it is no less hard to oblige a
man, contrary to common law, to sustain a pro∣cess
where he cannot have the benefit of a <HI>res
judicata.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto the effects of a standing decree have
been under consideration. But a decree may
<PB N="186" REF="199"/>
be reversed, in a reduction, or upon an appeal,
after having, received execution in whole or in
part; and we now proceed to examine, how far
such execution ought to be supported against the
reversal. Some decrees proceeding on errors in
fact or in law, are voided as unjust. Some, in
themselves just, are voided by means of facts
afterward discovered. I need scarce add decrees
that are voided as <HI>ultra vires:</HI> when a judge
transgresses his powers, he is no better than a pri∣vate
person.</P>
<P>With respect to a decree erroneous in law, a
judge has legal authority to determine controver∣sies
regularly brought before him. But his o∣pinion
is not, like that of an arbiter, the determi∣ning
rule: he is tied down to make law his rule.
And therefore, if the decree he pronounces be
not founded on law, it is void, as destitute of le∣gal
authority. Every decree, it is true, is pre∣sumed
to be according to law; but the presump∣tion
flies off, if the decree be reversed in a su∣perior
court. I put the case, that a certain sub∣ject,
the property of which is controverted, is
decreed to belong to the pursuer, who, accor∣dingly,
is put in possession by execution on the
decree. The decree is reversed in a superior
court, as erroneous in law: is the property trans∣ferred,
yea, or no? The answer is, that a judge
cannot transfer property without a just cause.
The superior court pronounces, that the proper∣ty
<PB N="187" REF="200"/>
belongs not to the pursuer, but to the defend∣ant.
And accordingly, we find not in the law of
any civilized country, that an unjust decree is
one of the modes of transferring property.</P>
<P>To illustrate this doctrine, figure a settlement
of a land-estate upon a long series of heirs, and
a controversy between John and James about the
succession, after the death of a predecessor who
left no issue. James being preferred by the court
of session, is served and infeft; and aliens the e∣state
for a valuable consideration. The decree is
reversed in the House of Lords, and John is found
to be the righteous heir. According to that
judgement, the service and infeftment of James
are void; and the alienation made by him is also
void, as proceeding <HI>a non habente potestatem.</HI>
The subject consequently remains <HI>in hereditate
jacente</HI> of the predecessor; and John may take
possession, by making up a title as heir. All
that James gains by the decree of the court of
session, is to be a <HI>bona fide possessor, qui fruc∣tus
perceptos et consumptos facit suos.</HI></P>
<P>Money is singular: the property of it is trans∣ferred
by possession, not even excepting robbery.
The person however who has unjustly acquired
the property of money, is bound to pay the equi∣valent;
and a decree erroneous in law, will af∣ford
no protection; witness the case of payment
made to a putative creditor, by authority of a de∣cree.
The decree will protect the debtor from
<PB N="188" REF="201"/>
the true creditor; but will it also protect the pu∣tative
creditor who has received the money?
No. The putative creditor holds the sum <HI>sine
justa causa;</HI> and he is bound in conscience to
pay it to the true creditor; and that payment sets
all to rights.</P>
<P>Supposing now a decree to be affirmed, instead
of being reversed, it is effectual from its date, as
if it never had been challenged. One exception
there is, which merits attention. A parish-mini∣ster
is deposed by the presbytery; and the sen∣tence
is affirmed by the synod and general assem∣bly.
He undoubtedly stands deposed from the
date of the presbytery's sentence; but must he
restore the stipend bestowed by him on his pro∣cess,
and on maintenance of his family? He
cannot urge a <HI>bona fide</HI> possession after the first
sentence; and he has no defence at common law.
Upon these grounds it once was found, that the
sentence of the assembly operates <HI>retro</HI> to the date
of the sentence affirmed, which bars the minister
from the stipend falling due in the interim<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">July 1723, Muir <HI>contra</HI> Hepburn.</NOTE>.
But this judgement seems to rest upon common
law, contrary to equity: while a minister expects
to have the sentence reversed, it would be rigo∣rous
to deprive him of the only fund he has
for prosecuting the appeal, not to talk of subsist∣ence
to himself and family. Equity therefore
continues him in possession of the stipend, till the
sentence be affirmed in the last resort. And if he
<PB N="189" REF="202"/>
be litigious, he may be subjected to the expence
of the process. Here then is a case, where the
ultimate sentence only is effectual, though the
first sentence be just. And this must always hap∣pen,
where the subject in controversy is alimenta∣ry,
such as the stipend of a minister.</P>
<P>The other branch of unjust decrees is, where
they are founded upon an error in fact. All con∣troversies
that can be brought before a court of
justice, arise from facts; and if judgement be gi∣ven
upon en error in fact, it is set aside as not
being a judgement upon the case in controversy.</P>
<P>We proceed now to the other kind of decrees,
which, though not unjust, are rendered ineffec∣tual
by facts afterward discovered. The follow∣ing
case is a proper example. The estate of Bal∣quhain
was possessed many years under a strict
entail. Upon the death of Ernest Lesly without
issue, a competition arose between Sir James Les∣ly
and Count Antonius Lesly, a German; each
claiming to be served as next heir of entail.
Count Antonius was preferred by judgement of
the court of session, affirmed in the last resort,
finding him to be the next heir of entail in terms
of the settlement. Having completed his title to
the estate by service and infeftment, he conti∣nued
in possession several years, as undoubted
proprietor. At last Peter Lesly-Grant entered
the lists as next substitute to Count Antonius,
insisting in a reduction of the Count's right, as
<PB N="190" REF="203"/>
being an alien, and therefore incapable to inhe∣rit
land in Britain. The pursuer prevailed in
his reduction before the court of session; and
this judgement was affirmed in the House of
Lords.</P>
<P>The judgement preferring Count Antonius
before Sir James, lay not open to any challenge.
But it was rendered ineffectual by the later
judgement finding Count Antonius an alien.
Nor are the two judgements inconsistent with
each other; their import in conjunction being,
that Count Antonius was next heir of entail,
but that he was personally disqualified. Thus
standing the case, the question is, Whether the
estate of Balquhain was transferred to Count An∣tonius
by his infeftment proceeding on the first
judgement? or, Whether the judgement was
null and void, with all its consequences, being
in favour of an alien? Supposing the former,
all acts done by him preceding Lesly-Grant's
challenge, must be effectual: supposing the latter,
these acts are void, as flowing <HI>a non habente po∣testatem.</HI>
In order to resolve this intricate que∣stion,
we assume a proposition that will not be
controverted; which is, That a judgement cannot
operate beyond the intention of the judge, more
than a convenant beyond the intention of the con∣tractors.
Now, no more was decreed, nor in∣tended
to be decreed, but that Count Antonius
was called to the succession before Sir James Les∣ly;

and the objection of alienage remained entire.
Hence it is evident, that Count Antonius was on∣ly
a putative proprietor, never really vested in
the estate. Suppose the Count, without opposi∣tion,
to have been infeft as heir of entail, this
infeftment could not transfer the property to him,
an alien; and the opposition he met with, could
not supply the defect of his right.</P>
<P>To conclude, when a just decree is rendered
ineffectual by facts afterward discovered, every
consequent act must be equally ineffectual. Thus,
in the instance given, the judgement finding
Count Antonius next heir of entail being render∣ed
ineffectual by his alienage, the consequent ser∣vice
and infeftment were equally so. A service in
such a case confers no right; and it is an esta∣blished
maxim, That a title without right is of no
significancy.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mutual relief among co-obligants.</HEAD>
<P>DEbtors bound together, whether as co-prin∣cipals
or as co-cautioners, are held by law
to be, as in a society, bound to act for the com∣mon
behoof; and consequently that every right
relative to the common bond, must accrue to the
whole, though purchased by one of them in his
own name.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that a cautioner paying the debt,
and taking assignment to himself, is not at liberty
to lay aside his character of cautioner, in order
to put himself in the creditor's place. The as∣signment
accresces to the whole cautioners, and
cannot be extended farther than the claim of re∣lief
would go without it.</P>
<P>Hence, also, a cautioner demanding relief must
communicate eases: which is saying only, that
he can claim no more from his co-cautioners but
what he has paid ultimately above his proportion
of the debt.</P>
<P>Suppose six <HI>correi debendi,</HI> or co-obligants.
If one pay the debt, and take an assignment, what
method is he to follow for operating his relief?
Can he, in virtue of his assignment, claim the
whole from any one of his co-obligants, subtract∣ing
<PB N="193" REF="206"/>
only his own share? Or must he be content∣ed
with a sixth part from each co-obligant; re∣serving
action for a further demand, in case any
of them prove insolvent? The first is, in effect,
giving to the assignee the benefit of the assignment,
to draw more than he would be intitled to by an
action of relief; which is contrary to the equality
that ought to be preserved among co-obligants.
The other is not less unequal on the other side;
for the obligant who has been compelled to pay
the whole debt, is in a worse condition than the
other co-obligants, each of whom advances the
sixth part only.</P>
<P>The rule therefore ought to be, That every
single obligant must bear an equal proportion with
the assignee. For example, Six cautioners are
bound in a bond for L. 600; A, paying the debt,
ought to be relieved of the one half by B; and
each of them is intitled to draw L. 100 from C;
which puts the three upon an equal footing; and
so on, till each of the six be brought in for his
share. Now, as this produces a perfect equality
among the co-cautioners, it avoids, at the same
time, an after reckoning, in case of insolvency.</P>
<P>But what if the cautioner who takes an assign∣ment
upon paying the debt, be laid under the ne∣cessity
of adjudging the estates of such of his co∣cautioners
as happen to be insolvent. I see not
that this varies the case. He may attack any of
his co-cautioners, and draw out of his effects the
<PB N="194" REF="207"/>
one half of the sum contained in the adjudication.
And having recovered that sum, he must com∣municate
his adjudication to the competing credi∣tors;
so as that he and they may recover from
the other co-cautioners what remains of the debt.
I think indeed, that the cautioner-assignee may ad∣judge
for the whole debt, without subtracting e∣ven
his own share; because it is a benefit to the
solvent creditors to have the adjudication as exten∣sive
as possible, in order to draw the greater sum
in competition with the other creditors of such of
the cautioners as happen to be insolvent.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Heir entering cum beneficio inventarii.</HEAD>
<P>FEW branches of our law have made a slow∣er
progress toward perfection, than that
concerning heirs entering by an inventory; and
yet no branch deserves more the attention of the
court of session, considering what influence it has
on payment of debts, and circulation of money,
matters of great importance in a commercial coun∣try.</P>
<P>In order to improve our law in this particular,
it is necessary to state the articles that require rec∣tification.
I begin with the hardship that the cre∣ditors
lie under. The creditors, it is true, can
bring the estate to a sale, a salutary regulation
authorised in the later practice of the court of
session. But then, it is in the power of every
heir who takes the benefit of an inventory, to de∣prive
the creditors of that privilege. If before a
process of sale be raised, the heir enter into pay∣ment
of his predecessor's debts, the other credi∣tors
are barred from a process of sale; for after
paying the value, or any part of the value, the e∣state
cannot be wrested from the heir.</P>
<P>2<HI>do,</HI> As it is admitted, that the heir may le∣gally
pay <HI>primo venienti,</HI> favourite creditors will
<PB N="196" REF="209"/>
be preferred, or such as give the largest composi∣tion.
A power so arbitrary, which opens a wide
door to injustice, and even to fraud, is a re∣proach
to the law of a civilized country. And
yet the court of session, far from repressing the
evil, have countenanced it; finding, that an heir
<HI>cum inventario,</HI> may not only pay <HI>primo venien∣ti,</HI>
but may also prefer what creditors he pleases,
by granting heritable bonds of corroboration.
Nay, farther, if the creditors allow a year to e∣lapse,
there is nothing to bar the heir from a∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning
the whole estate, which effectually prevents
a sale at their instance.</P>
<P>3<HI>tio,</HI> It may readily happen, that a personal
action for payment is carried on against the
heir by one creditor, and a sale of the land by
another. What shall be done in that case?
Both actions cannot proceed; and yet no rule
appears for giving a preference to either. A fa∣vourite
creditor will never be wanting to car∣ry
on the personal action, with a view to serve
the heir, in contradiction to all the other credi∣tors.</P>
<P>As our law stands at present, the heir is also
subjected to many hardships. If, apprehending
the debts to exceed or equal the value of the e∣state,
he make no opposition to a sale at their in∣stance,
the whole may soon be brought to a fair
conclusion. The price is divided among the cre∣ditors;
and the surpi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, if any, goes to the heir.
<PB N="197" REF="210"/>
But if all the debts that he can discover do not
exceed the value of the estate, his affection for
his paternal inheritance makes him pay the whole,
fearing no further disturbance. I see not however,
that the possession of the estate is secured to him.
A new creditor starting up any time within forty
years, can relevantly alledge, that the debts paid
amount not to the value of the estate. This
brings on an intricate, tedious, and expensive
law-suit; and the decree, supposing it to be in
favour of the heir, protects him not against the
same distressing course with other creditors who
afterward appear; for they are not bound by a
judgement to which they were not parties. And
so the heir lies open to perpetual harassment,
without prospect of an end.</P>
<P>In these unhappy circumstances, the heir's
hands are effectually tied up from making any
improvements. For it is a rule established by
the court, That the heir must account to credi∣tors
according to the present value of the inven∣tory.</P>
<P>Luckily, a remedy to these evils falls under the
<HI>nobile officium</HI> of the court; and our judges
cannot be more usefully employed than in esta∣blishing
a proper remedy. In that view, the fol∣lowing
hints are suggested to be corrected or im∣proved.</P>
<P>1. That within a month after the inventory
is recorded in the books of session, advertisements
<PB N="198" REF="211"/>
must be put in the news-papers, calling the cre∣ditors
to produce their grounds of debt with∣in
six months, in the hands of the keeper of the
said record; of which a list shall be made, sub∣scribed
by the keeper and witnesses.</P>
<P>2. That the heir shall have forty days for exa∣mining
the lists and vouchers, in order finally to
resolve, either to abandon the estate to the cre∣ditors,
or to hold the estate and subject himself
to the claims contained in the list. And till that
term be elapsed, the creditors shall be barred from
doing any diligence.</P>
<P>3. If the heir suffer the forty days to elapse,
without delaring his resolution as aforesaid, the
creditors are impowered forthwith to bring the
estate to a sale, as a bankrupt-estate; the price
to be divided among the creditors, the surplus
to the heir, if there be any surplus.</P>
<P>4. If the heir come to a resolution to hold the
estate, he must, before commencement of a pro∣cess
of sale, deliver to the keeper a formal deed,
binding himself to pay all the claims contained in
the list; reserving to him, as to any other heir,
objections and defences that may be competent a∣gainst
particular claims.</P>
<P>5. In that case, he shall be intitled to apply to
the court of session, praying, that the just value
of the lands and other subjects contained in
the inventory, be ascertained by a proof. And
the value thus ascertained by the court shall be
<PB N="199" REF="212"/>
held the just value, to bind the heir, and all the
creditors who may afterward appear.</P>
<P>6. After the value is thus ascertained, and
the objections and defences against particular
claims are discussed; the court, upon a second
application by the heir, shall take inspection of
the claims sustained. If these be found to equal
the ascertained value of the inventory, the heir
shall be declared free from being further liable
to any debts or deeds of his predecessors. If
they fall short of the ascertained value, the ba∣lance,
with its interest, shall be declared a sum
in the hands of the heir, ready for creditors who
may afterward appear.</P>
<P>7. If the heir neglect to apply to the court
for ascertaining the value as aforesaid, he shall be
bound to account to the creditors who afterward
appear, for the subjects inventoried according to
the value at the time of the demand. When
this value is ascertained by a proof, and from it
is subtracted the sums paid to the creditors who
appeared in due time, the remainder shall be a
fund in the hands of the heir, for satisfying the
present creditors; and if there be a surplus, it
shall remain for other creditors who may after∣ward
appear, or who have appeared after the six
months allowed to creditors to produce their
grounds of debt in the keeper's hands.</P>
<P>8. If the heir, without signifying his resolution
of keeping or abandoning the estate, shall dispose
<PB N="200" REF="213"/>
of it, or of any part, he shall be subjected univer∣sally,
as if he had entered without inventory. And
justly; because he has prevented the creditors
from bringing the estate to a sale.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Rules for ranking creditors and dispo∣nees
on a bankrupt estate.</HEAD>
<P>EArly in life some of my leisure-hours were
employed to frame essays on particular heads
of Scotch law; and these essays, intended for
private use merely, found however their way into
the public. Against frequent solicitations, I re∣solved,
that that juvenile performance should never
again see the light; being sensible, that in a young
author imperfections are pardoned, which will
not be indulged in later editions, when the ex∣cuse
of youth no longer subsists. At the same
time, I thought it would be serving the public
better, to incorporate in my later works the sub∣stance
of these essays. The substance accordingly
of the essay termed <HI>Beneficium cedendarum ac∣tionum,</HI>
is taken into <HI>Principles of Equity;</HI> the
essay on Prescription, enlarged and improved,
makes a chapter in the present work; and I have
here added the essays <HI>Vinco vincentem</HI> and <HI>Jus
tertii,</HI> without any material alteration, but of a
neater form. It was indeed proper, that these
technical titles should be converted into others
more expressive of the subject. The first I term
“Rules for ranking creditors and disponees on
<PB N="202" REF="215"/>
a bankrupt estate;” I term the other, “What
interest is sufficient to intitle one to sue or to
defend.”</P>
<P>In a competition among rights burdening land,
priority of time determines the preference. A
land-proprietor who burdens his land with an he∣ricable
bond completed by infeftment, yields pre∣ference
to the creditor in a competition about
the rents. And as he himself is postponed to the
creditor, every subsequent right he grants must
equally be postponed. For the same reason,
where the estate is sold, the infeftment of annual-rent
is preferable on the price, as formerly on
the land. Hence in a competition among real
rights, the rule is, <HI>Prior tempore, potior jure.</HI></P>
<P>Certain objections, or grounds of reduction,
disturb the operation of this rule, by setting a∣side
a prior creditor in competition with one po∣sterior;
an inhibition, for example, a consent
by one creditor to the preference of another, and
many others that occur in rankings.</P>
<P>No rule is more easy in its application, than
that of ranking real debts according to their dates.
But it is not always easy to determine the effect
of objections, or grounds of reduction. The
way is, to begin with computing what each should
draw by the general rule, <HI>Prior tempore, potior
jure;</HI> and this will be the ultimate draught of
the creditors who are not subjected to any ob∣jection
or ground of reduction. Proceed next
<PB N="203" REF="216"/>
to consider what a posterior creditor is intitled to
draw from a prior, against whose right he has
an objection of ground of reduction. As every
relevant ground of reduction is, in a competition,
considered as equivalent to a decree of reduc∣tion;
the prior creditor may be laid aside, as sup∣posed
to be cut down by a decree of reduction;
and whatever sum the posterior creditor would
draw out of the common fund upon that suppo∣sition,
he is intitled to demand from the prior
creditor: there is no reason for confining him to
a less sum; and he can have no pretext for de∣manding
more. This operation requires to be
explained; and the best explanation will be ex∣amples.
Let three real creditors be supposed in
the order of time, John, James, and William.
William lent his money upon a consent from
John to his preference. The fund is 6, each
of the debts 4. Ranking the three creditors ac∣cording
to the order of time, which is the first
step, John draws 4, James the remaining 2, and
nothing is left to William. We then proceed to
consider the effect of John's consent to William's
preference; which imports no more but that
John shall make no opposition to William, lea∣ving
him to draw as if he John were not in the
field. To give the consent any further effect,
would make it the same with a conveyance of
John's claim to William; which is not the in∣tendment
of a naked consent to a preference.
<PB N="204" REF="217"/>
Laying then John aside, William can draw but
2; because James, as prior in time, excludes him
from the other 4; and this sum of 2, William is
intitled to draw from John. The result of the whole
is, that John draws 2, James 2, and William 2.
I state another case. Suppose the fund to be 8,
and each of the debts 6. By the rule of time,
John draws 6, and James the remaining 2, lea∣ving
nothing to William. Taking next the con∣sent
under consideration, William can draw but
2, because James covers from him the other 6
by the rule of time; and that sum he draws from
John. The result is, that John draws 4, James
2, and William 2. Cases may be figured where
consent has the same effect with a conveyance.
The fund is 12: each of the debts 6. By the
rule of time, William draws nothing; but by
laying John aside, he will draw 6; and that sum
he takes from John. In this case, William draws
from John all that John is intitled to by the rule
of time. But this proceeds from the proportion
of figures, not from the nature of consent. On
the other hand, cases may be figured, where the
consent has no effect; as where James covers the
whole fund from William. In that case, Wil∣liam
has nothing to draw from John; because he
would draw nothing, supposing John to be out of
the field.</P>
<P>The double ranking may be avoided, by laying
John, the consenter, aside, in computing what
<PB N="205" REF="218"/>
William, the person consented to, is intitled to
draw; and his draught will always be what is
left of the fund by the preferable creditors. Thus,
in the first example, James being preferable to Wil∣liam
for his whole debt, the remainder, which
is only 2, falls to William's share. The follow∣ing
illustration will make this method clear. Wil∣liam,
proposing to lend his money on heritable
security, finds the subject preoccupied by two
real creditors, John and James. The former, in
order to accommodate the proprietor, his rela∣tion,
is willing to give preference to William;
who, upon that condition, lends his money, and
obtains an infeftment of annualrent. According
to this transaction, what remains of the fund un∣occupied
by James, is all that William has to de∣pend
on for his payment; and the price of that
remainder he is intitled to draw as far as his debt
extends.</P>
<P>The same method holds, where, instead of a
consent, William has an inhibition that strikes
out John's debt. The inhibition, like consent,
has only the effect of giving a preference; and
puts not the inhibiter in place of the person in∣hibited,
which would require an assignment.
James, in all events, is preferable to William,
because William's inhibition strikes not against
him: William can draw nothing but what re∣mains
unoccupied by James; and that remainder
he draws from John; or, by the more simple
<PB N="206" REF="219"/>
method, he draws it directly out of the price of
the land.</P>
<P>The same method is equally applicable to every
ground of reduction, that affords a preference
only, and is not equivalent to an assignment. I
give an example from the Roman law. By that
law, a conventional hypothec recorded, is prefer∣red
before one not recorded; but a legal hypo∣thec
requires not to be recorded. One borrows
a sum upon a hypothec, which the creditor ne∣glects
to put on record. The debtor afterward
is made a tutor; and by the Roman law, all his
effects are hypothecated to the pupil. Last of
all, he borrows another sum upon a hypothec,
which is put on record. According to the rule
of time, the claims must be ranked in the order
here mentioned. But what disturbs this order,
is the law preferring a conventional hypothec re∣corded
before one not recorded; which intitles
the former to draw as if the latter were not in the
field. And this case accordingly is similar to those
above mentioned, where a posterior real creditor
is preferred before a prior, by consent or by in∣hibition.</P>
<P>Thus stands the law where the ground of re∣duction
operates a total preference. Next in or∣der
are cases where it operates only a partial pre∣serence,
as in adjudications within year and day.
John, for example, is an adjudger infeft; James
has an heritable bond and infeftment of a lat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="207" REF="220"/>
date; after whom comes William, a second ad∣judger
within year and day of the first. All
that William has to depend on, is what remains
of the fund after James obtains payment. As
to that remainder, he is ranked <HI>pari pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
with John; which comes to the same with pre∣ferring
him before John as to the half of the re∣mainder.
John, the first adjudger, is preferred
before James, the annualrenter; and James be∣fore
William, the second adjudger; both by pri∣ority
of time. William, by act 1661, is prefer∣red
before John for half of the remainder; and
that half he draws, as if John were not in the
field. Suppose the fund to be 6, and each of
the debts 4. John draws 4, in competition with
James, leaving the remaining 2 to James, which
he retains ultimately. William can never draw
more than 2, the rest of the fund being preoc∣cupied
by James; for the half of which William
is preferred before John. Upon the whole,
John draws 3, James 2, and William 1. Here
it is taken for granted, that the act 1661 does
not intitle the second adjudger to draw as much
as the first; but only that it bars the preference
given by common law to the first adjudger. See
another example of the same kind at the close of
the 36th article.</P>
<P>Having laid down the method of determining
what a posterior creditor ought to draw from a
prior, by virtue of a ground of reduction, par∣tial
<PB N="208" REF="221"/>
or total; my next care shall be, to render the
subject familiar, by adding other examples. John
is an annualrenter, first in time; after him come
James and William, adjudgers <HI>pari passu.</HI> Wil∣liam
lent his money, trusting to a consent obtain∣ed
from John; but after an inhibition by James.
The fund is 6: each of the debts 4. By the
general rule, <HI>Prior tempore,</HI> John draws 4;
James and William each of them 1. Consider∣ing
next the grounds of reduction, James, by his
inhibition, strikes William out of the field; and
draws all that is left by John, which is 2; and
that sum he retains ultimately. William, by
John's consent, strikes him out of the field: all
however that he can draw after yielding prefer∣ence
to James the inhibiter, is 2. Upon the ul∣timate
division, each of the competitors draws 2.
Supposing the fund to be 6, as before, and each
of the debts to be 5; John draws 4, James 1,
and William 1. Supposing the fund to continue
6, and each of the debts to be 6; John draws the
whole. I intreat the reader's peculiar attention
to the following example. First, an assignment
duly intimated; second, an arrestment interve∣ning
between the assignment and intimation;
third, and adjudication proceeding upon a citation,
posterior in date to the assignment, but prior to
the arrestment. The subject is land-rent; and
the parties are all convened in a multiple-poind∣ing.
The arrestment is preferable to the assign∣ment
<PB N="209" REF="222"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, tit. Assignation, sect. 44.</NOTE>. The assignment is preferable to the ad∣judication
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Durie, 2d March 1637, Smith <HI>contra</HI> Hepburn.</NOTE> And the adjudication is preferable
to the arrestment<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 26th June 1705, Stewart <HI>contra</HI> Stewart.</NOTE>. Here priority of time is
the ground of preference in all: which is a con∣tradiction;
for if A be preferred before B upon
any ground, B cannot be preferred before A up∣pon
the same ground. The circles that have hi∣therto
occurred, proceed upon different grounds
of preference; and there is nothing more simple,
than that A should be preferred before B upon
one ground, and B before A on another. But
in the case given, there must lurk somewhere a
fundamental error; for to prefer a number of
persons in a circle upon the same ground, is a
slat contradiction. Nor is it difficult to discover
the error: in preferring the arrestment before the
assignment, the arrestment is supposed to make a
<HI>nexus realis</HI> on the subject; which an assignment,
without intimation, certainly does not: in prefer∣ring
the adjudication before the arrestment, an
arrestment is held to be simply a personal prohi∣bition;
for if it made a <HI>nexus realis,</HI> it ought to
be preferred before the adjudication. If either
supposition be adopted, the ranking will be easily
adjusted. If an arrestment make a <HI>nexus <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealis,</HI>
it is preferable before both the assignment and de∣creet
<PB N="210" REF="223"/>
of adjudication: if it be a personal prohibi∣tion
only, both are preferred before it. And
that the purpose of an arrestment is only to
prohibit the arrestee from making payment to
the common debtor, will be evident, first, from
the tenor of the writ; next, from its giving way
to a poinding of the goods arrested; and, last,
from its giving way to a posterior adjudication.</P>
<P>Having discussed the ranking of creditors, we
proceed to that of different disponees, each claim∣ing
the property. Among disponees, as among
creditors, the general rule of ranking from prio∣rity
of time takes place; and there may be
grounds of reduction, by which a posterior dis∣ponee
prevails over one that is prior. There is
no difference, but that a disponee claims the sub∣ject
itself, upon which a creditor has only a secu∣rity.
And when the claim of creditor is so
great as to cover the whole subject, even that
distinction vanishes. The foregoing method
therefore of determining the effect of grounds
of reduction between creditors, is equally appli∣cable
to disponees. Take the following exam∣ples;
in which the competing rights shall be sta∣ted
in the order of time, to save the embarrass∣ment
of many words.</P>
<P>Example 1. A deathbed-deed completed,
but reducible by the heir. A second deathbed-deed
of the same subject, consented to by the
heir. The first deed excludes the second: the
<PB N="211" REF="224"/>
second excludes the heir: and the heir excludes
the first. In determining this competition, I
take it for granted, that the heir's consent to the
second deed, operates not a conveyance of his
privilege, but barely a <HI>non repugnantia.</HI> Upon
that supposition, the first disponee prevails. The
heir may be laid aside as having no interest in
the question; for in no event can he draw a
shilling by his reduction. This case is singular,
a consent intended to benefit one, benefiting an
antagonist without intention. But though singu∣lar,
it is not sole: the following is of the same
kind. A base infeftment of ward-lands. A se∣cond
infeftment of the same made public by the
superior's confirmation. The first infeftment
will prevail by means of the superior's consent,
though intended to benefit the other infeftment;
because the superior, by that consent, has now no
interest to insist in a declarator of recognition a∣gainst
the first infeftment.</P>
<P>Example 2. An adjudication with a charge a∣gainst
the superior. A disposition of the same
land with infeftment. A second adjudication with∣in
year and day of the first. The first adjudica∣tion
excludes the voluntary right: the voluntary
right excludes the second adjudication: and that
adjudication is ranked <HI>pari passu</HI> with the first.
By the general rule of time, the first adjudger
draws his whole sum; leaving the remainder of
the fund of the voluntary right. This concludes
<PB N="212" REF="225"/>
the ranking; for the second adjudger, being to∣tally
excluded by the voluntary right, has no
claim against the first adjudger.</P>

<P>I conclude with the following observation. There
is not much intricacy in computing what creditors

considerable degree of sagacity, to reduce to such
simplicity the endless varieties that occur in rank∣ings.
The operation requires the same sort of sa∣gacity

<HEAD>ART. XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What interest is sufficient to entitle one to
sue or to defend.</HEAD>
<P>NO rational man ever acts unless with an
intention to produce some effect. There∣fore,
in a court of justice, however well found∣ed
an action or a defence may be in itself, it will
be rejected as idle and foolish, if the person who
acts can draw no benefit from it, or have no <HI>in∣terest</HI>
in it, as expressed in law-terms. Hence a
rule, That <HI>right</HI> without <HI>interest</HI> will not be sus∣tained
in a process, either by way of action or
objection: and as little will <HI>interest</HI> without <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P>But mark, that in a process no person's in∣terest
will be regarded, but that of the person
who acts. The social nature of man moves him
to exert many actions for the good of others;
but there is a substantial reason that consines a
judge to the interest of the litigants, without re∣garding
the interest of others; which is, that a
decree is effectual between the litigants only;
and a court will give no countenance to an action
or to a defence that cannot be effectual. If a de∣cree
could have any effect against a third party,
it would be easy, by artful management, to pro∣cure
a judgement against persons who all the
<PB N="214" REF="227"/>
while are ignorant of what is going on against
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Principles of Equity, edit. 2. p. 60.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Because, where a man goes out of his road to
urge a point he has no interest in, the plead∣ing
frequently respects the right of some third
person; therefore the objection against a man
who pleads what is not his own interest, is term∣ed
<HI>jus tertii;</HI> and that term is carelessly applied
to every case where the person pleading has no
interest, whether it regard the interest of any third
person, or not.</P>
<P>With respect to the subject of this article, there
is one general rule, That no interest is regarded
in a process but what is pecuniary: a court of
law concerns itself with nothing but what tends to
augment or lessen a man's estate. The interest
of ambition, of revenge, or of any other passion
that is not lucrative, is totally disregarded.</P>
<P>When we descend to particulars, I can discover
no rules for determining, in every case, what in∣terest
is sufficient to carry on a process, or to de∣fend
against it. The only way I have to give in∣struction,
is to quote examples; which shall be
classed in the best order that occurs.</P>
<P>I begin with examining what interest is suffi∣cient
to enable a pursuer to carry on his process.
A contract between two apprisers, that neither of
them should alien under pain of forfeiting his
<PB N="215" REF="228"/>
right, being transgressed by one of them, the o∣ther
brought a process of forfeiture. The court
refused to sustain action; because the pursuer had
no pecuniary interest to bar the defendant from
aliening<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, 11th February 1630, Ker <HI>contra</HI> Lempitlaw.</NOTE>. Sir Robert Hepburn settled his e∣state
upon Congalton younger, proviso, That he
should marry Cockburn of Pilton's eldest daugh∣ter;
otherwise that the estate should go to his
younger brother. After Sir Robert's death, the
young lady raised a process against Congalton,
concluding, that he had lost the estate by refu∣sing
to marry her. Objected, That the pursuer
had no interest to insist in a process that did not
benefit her, but the defendant's brother. The
court sustained process<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Home, December 1684, Harcarse (Alienation), Fe∣bruary 1685, Jean Cockburn <HI>contra</HI> Congalton.</NOTE>. I cannot assent to this
judgement. The pursuer had no interest but
that of revenge, to which law gives no counte∣nance.
There is beside an invincible objection to
the judgement, which appears to have been to∣tally
overlooked, which is, that the pursuer had no
right to carry on the process: she was <HI>posita in
conditione</HI> only, and no right was given her by
the settlement, to found an action upon. A su∣perior
has a sufficient interest to reduce the re∣tour
of his vassal; because the reduction inti∣tles
him by a process of nonentry to levy the
<PB N="216" REF="229"/>
rents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, ult. February 1628, Earl Nithsdale <HI>contra</HI> Westraw.</NOTE>. Land being comprised by an assignee,
the proprietor, in order to set aside the compri∣sing,
has interest to insist in an improbation of
the assignment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Haddington, 19th January 1610, Ross <HI>contra</HI> Stewart.</NOTE>. An old feu-right having gone
through many hands, and several of the mid-couples,
or mesne-conveyances, being lost, the
superior brought a reduction against the latest
purchaser, who was in possession. The original
charte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of feu having been produced, it was de∣creed,
“That the pursuer could not object the
want of the mid-couples, because he was liable,
as representing the granter, to warrant the
charter; and that it was <HI>jus tertii</HI> for him to
object to any right derived from the original
feuer<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 31st January; Fountainhall, 1st Februa∣ry 1712, Earl Forfar <HI>contra</HI> Gilhagie.</NOTE>.” The first branch of the interlocu∣tor,
finding the action excluded by the charter,
is well founded. But not so the other branch,
finding, that the pursuer had no interest to chal∣lenge
any right derived from the original feuer.
It was evidently his interest to show, that a null
or defective title gave the defendant no right to
the subject; and consequently that he the pursuer
was intitled to the possession. But as the action was
<PB N="217" REF="230"/>
ill founded in point of right, it was justly dismiss∣ed,
as interest without right avails nothing.</P>
<P>The defendant comes next in order. And as
every defendant finds his account in an absolvitor,
it is obviously his interest to desend himself a∣gainst
a claim that is not founded on law. A she∣riff
having disobeyed a charge to take a debtor
who was denounced rebel upon a horning, was
sued by the creditor for payment of the debt.
Objected, That the denunciation was informal;
that the debtor could not regularly be imprison∣ed
as a rebel; and therefore that he the defendant
was not liable to pay the debt. The objection was
sustained<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haddington, ult. January 1611, Caddel <HI>contra</HI> Vanse.</NOTE>. A debtor, imprisoned on a caption,
being suffered to escape, the creditor insisted in a
process against the magistrates for payment of the
debt. Their objection was sustained, That the
horning was null; and as the debtor was not a re∣bel,
that they were not bound to detain him in
prison<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Durie, 14th July 1626, Adam <HI>contra</HI> Bailies of Air.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next of objections against the pursuer's title,
supposing the claim to be well founded in law.
Such objections are either what appear from the
production, or what require to be verified by e∣vidence.
With respect to the former, the de∣fendant
can never be barred by a <HI>jus tertii</HI> from
<PB N="218" REF="231"/>
stating them. For it is the duty of the judge
himself, to take notice of such objections; and if
he overlook them, they may be suggested by the
defendant, or by any one as <HI>amicus curiae.</HI> Take
the following examples. In a suit for teind be∣longing
to the lordship of Dunfermline, founded
on a lease granted by King William, the pur∣suer's
title was objected to, as flowing <HI>a non ha∣bente
potestatem;</HI> because the lordship of Dun∣fermline
did not belong to King William, but to
James VII. heir to Queen Anne of Denmark.
Answered, It is <HI>jus tertii</HI> for the defendant to
plead on Queen Anne's right, seeing he derived
no right from her. The objection was repelled,
because the defendant derived no right from
Queen Anne of Denmark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 26th January 1699, Marquis of Tweed∣dale <HI>contra</HI> Sir David Thoirs.</NOTE>. The objection
here to the pursuer's title was notorious:
James VII. never was forfeited; and his abdica∣ting
the crown deprived him not of his private e∣state.
As this objection was verified by the pro∣duction
itself, it was the duty of the court to dis∣miss
the process, as the pursuer had no title to
carry it on; and the defendant's right could not
regularly come under consideration. In a pro∣cess
for arrears of teind founded on a charter of
adjudication of the teind, with infeftment; this
was not sustained as a sufficient title to force pay∣ment
from the proprietor of the land, who had
<PB N="219" REF="232"/>
levied the teind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 29th November 1710, Mitchell <HI>contra</HI> Baillie.</NOTE>. It was thought, that the ad∣judication
itself ought to have been produced,
with the title of the person against whom it was
led. The pursuer's production might have been
sufficient in a possessory action; but in a petitory
action, which was the case in question, a com∣plete
progress is necessary for teind, as well as for
land. As the defect of the pursuer's title was
obvious from his production, the court justly de∣nied
action. And even supposing the title to
have been good <HI>ex facie,</HI> to make it necessary for
the defendant to verify some legal objection a∣gainst
it; such an objection, moved by the pro∣prietor
of the land, ought to have been admitted
to proof; for he obviously had an interest to de∣mand
the teind from the patron at six years pur∣chase,
rather than from the titular at nine years
purchase. Yet in a declarator of the property of
teind, an adjudication both of land and teind,
proceeding on a special charge to enter heir, was
sustained as a good title, without obliging the
pursuer to give evidence that the person to whom
his debtor was charged to enter heir was titular
of the teind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Earl Home <HI>contra</HI> Heritors of the parish of Eccles, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th January 1729.</NOTE>. Here the pursuer's title was evi∣dently
defective; and though it had been <HI>ex fa∣cie</HI>
complete, the defendants had interest to
<PB N="220" REF="233"/>
object to it, and to verify their objection. In
the redemption of a wadset by an appriser of the
reversion, it was objected by the defendant, that
the apprising was cut down by the negative pre∣scription.
The court sustained process, and
found it <HI>jus tertii</HI> for the wadsetter to object pre∣scription
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 7th November 1704, Nicol <HI>contra</HI> Park.</NOTE>. Taking this judgement literally, it
is ill founded; for a wadsetter, in a process of
redemption against him, has an evident interest
to object to the title of the pursuer, in order to
retain a lucrative possession. But though he has
an interest, yet he has no title to make the ob∣jection.
Negative prescription operates in favour
of the debtor only, and not in favour of any third
party. It was competent to the reverser to ob∣ject
the negative prescription to the apprising led
against him, but not to the wadsetter against
whom the apprising was not led. And probably
this is what was intended by the court. Against
a declarator of the jurisdiction of a constabulary,
the negative prescription being objected; the ob∣jection
was sustained, and found not to be <HI>jus
tertii;</HI> for though no person can have interest to
plead exemption from the jurisdiction of the
King's judges, every one is interested to plead ex∣emption
from a private jurisdiction, which is a
<PB N="221" REF="234"/>
severe burden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">7th December 1731, Lord Dun <HI>contra</HI> Town of Montrose.</NOTE>. In this case, the distinction
between public and private jurisdiction is well
founded, but it did not regularly enter into the
cause. Negative prescription was an objection to
the pursuer's claim that required no proof; and
as it was not controverted on the pursuer's part,
no more was incumbent on the court, but to sus∣tain
the objection, and to dismiss the process.</P>
<P>We proceed to objections against a title <HI>ex fa∣cie</HI>
good. The defendant will not be admitted
to verify such an objection, either by writ or wit∣nesses,
unless it appear, that he has a sufficient
interest to defend against the process. The fol∣lowing
cases tend to clear what interest is suffi∣cient.
In a forthcoming on an arrestment, it was
objected by the arrestee, That the debt which
founded the arrestment was paid. The objection
was relevant; but it was found <HI>jus tertii</HI> in the
arrestee to move it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Durie, 21st December 1621, Hamilton <HI>contra</HI> Dur∣ham.</NOTE>. The arrestee had no in∣terest
but to pay safely; and as here he had the
authority of the court to make payment to the
pursuer of the forthcoming, payment could not
be demanded from him a second time, by the
common debtor, or by any other. In a suit for
arrears of teind, by a donatar of single escheat
of a person who had right to that teind by tack,
<PB N="222" REF="235"/>
the defendant objected, That the horning was
informal, and that escheat could not fall upon it.
As the title appeared <HI>ex facie</HI> good, the objec∣tion
was repelled, because the defendant was
liable for the teind; and the obtaining a delay of
payment, was not a sufficient interest to intitle
him to vex the pursuer, by attempting to prove
his horning informal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haddington, 23d June 1612, Earl Mar <HI>contra</HI> Ewing.</NOTE>. A woman having paid
a tocher with her daughter, who died within the

of the daughter's means, and that the claim be∣longed
to her representatives<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Durie, 13th July 1627, King <HI>contra</HI> Ker.</NOTE>. A better me∣thod

have been an order to bring the representatives
of the daughter into the field. James Ballan∣tyne
took a bond payable to himself, and after
his decease to Ballantyne, his son. The
blank was filled up with the name John, though
John Ballantyne was not borne till after the date
of the bond. Action however was sustained to
him, after his father's death, against the debtor,
who had no interest but to pay safely; and John's
name was probably inserted by his father<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stair; Dirletion, 5th January 1675, Ballantyne <HI>contra</HI> Edgar.</NOTE> A

haver of writs was decreed to deliver them to a
tutor-dative, who had found caution; though
the haver offered to prove, that there was a tutor

For the haver had no interest to detain
papers that did not belong to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spottiswoode (Tutor), 11th July 1628, Skelton <HI>contra</HI> Brown.</NOTE>. In an ex∣hibition
<HI>ad deliberandum,</HI> the following objec∣tion
was sustained against the pursuer, that he
was not the nearest heir; of which proof was of∣fered
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Forbes, MS. 10th February 1714, Crawford <HI>contra</HI> Crawford.</NOTE>. This appears a doubtful case. The
defendant had an interest to keep his charter-chest
from inspection. But in such a process, is
that interest sufficient to oblige the pursuer to
prove his propinquity? If the proof be easy, the
hardship is not great: but in an exhibition <HI>ad de∣liberandum,</HI>
it is a great hardship to force the
pursuer into an intricate and expensive proof,
which, after prevailing, is of no benefit to him,
except against the defendant only.</P>
<P>Whether bare possession be a sufficient interest,
will appear from the following cases. A lady,
who was infeft in a liferent of land by her hus∣band,
now deceased, sued the tenants to remove.
They objected, That she had no right, her hus∣band
being a liferenter only, and his son fiar.
Her title being <HI>ex facie</HI> good, the objection was
<PB N="224" REF="237"/>
repelled as <HI>jus tertii</HI> to the defendants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colvill, December 1582, Countess of Errol <HI>contra</HI> Tenants.</NOTE>. The
tenants here, possessing without a lease, were
thought to have no sufficient interest to intitle
them to challenge the pursuer's right. In a de∣clarator
of property, the defendant, though in
possession, was not permitted to object against the
pursuer's title, as he did not pretend to have
any right to possess.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stair, 18th July 1662, Lord Fraser <HI>contra</HI> Philorth.</NOTE>. In a removing from
ward-lands, the tenant was found interested to
alledge, that his deceased landlord had been de∣nuded

that the land did not fall in ward by
his death<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hope (Ward), 22d July 1625, Ld Ley <HI>contra</HI> Bar.</NOTE>. Supposing the defendant to have
been in possession by a current lease, which pro∣bably
was the case, he had a substantial interest
to object to the pursuer's title.</P>
<P>Next of <HI>jus tertii</HI> between competitors. One
thing is clear, that each competitor, in order to
obtain preference, is interested to state every re∣levant
objection against his competitors. Thus,
the nullity of a gift of escheat, as having been
taken for behoof of the rebel, stated by a poste∣rior
donatar, was sustained<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Haddington, penult May 1605, Douglas <HI>contra</HI> Spalding.</NOTE>. One served and
<PB N="225" REF="238"/>
retoured heir having brought a reduction against

competent to the defendant to challenge the pur∣suer's
right, as not being the nearest heir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie; Spottiswoode (Interest,) 23d July 1630, Lord Pitsligo <HI>contra</HI> Davidson.</NOTE>.
The interest of the defendant was clear; for a
<HI>res judicata</HI> in his favour would have been no
protection to him against the true heir. In a
competition between two apprisers, it was object∣ed
by the posterior appriser infeft, that the in∣feftment
on the prior apprising was null, being
taken by an assignee to the apprising, who ap∣peared
to have no right, as the assignment was
not produced. The objection was sustained as
not being <HI>jus tertii</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stair, 22d July 1668, Johnston <HI>contra</HI> Arnold.</NOTE>. A party infeft in land,
was permitted to object against a competing ad∣judication,
that it was led on a bond extinguish∣ed
by payment, though he derived no right from
the person against whom the adjudication was
deduced<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 18th December 1708, Eskine <HI>contra</HI> Ha∣milton.</NOTE>. In mutual declarators of right to a
salmon-fishing, one of the parties produced a
right from a subject of an old date, but the pro∣gress
was not well connected. The other pro∣duced
a charter from the crown, of a later
date. Each of them had been in possession at
different times; but neither of them had acqui∣red
<PB N="226" REF="239"/>
right by positive prescription. It was found
<HI>jus tertii</HI> for the party who derived right from
the crown, to insist upon the defect of his compe∣titor's
progress; seeing he did not connect with
his competitor's author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall; Dalrymple, 3d December 1701, Forbes <HI>contra</HI> Udny.</NOTE>. I am not satsfied
with this judgement. A salmon-fishing, like
land, requires a charter from the crown, or posi∣tive
prescription on a charter from a subject. If
so, a charter from the crown is preferable to any
right derived from a subject that is not fortified
by positive prescription. And therefore the par∣ty
who derived right from the crown, ought to
have been preferred, even though his competi∣tor's
progress had been complete. In a remo∣ving
at the instance of an adjudger the legal of
whose adjudication was expired, another adjud∣ger,
not within year and day, objected a nullity

posterior adjudger had no interest to keep the te∣nant

<P>Hitherto of objections to the pursuer's title.
Exceptions stand on a different ground. I have
no occasion to plead an exception, such as com∣pensation
or <HI>bona fide</HI> payment, till the pursuer's
title be sustained. And as the purpose of an ex∣ception

<HEAD>ART. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Commentary on the acts of parliament
concerning negative and positive pre∣scriptions
of forty years.</HEAD>
<P>PRoperty is a relation between men and
things, that is not attended with any visi∣ble
mark. I buy a horse, and pay for him upon
delivery. This fact establishes the relation be∣tween
me and the horse; but as the purchase
makes no visible alteration, either in me or in the
horse, the relation of property established thereby,
is merely a mental conception<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elements of Criticism, vol. 1. p. 336. edit. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such conceptions are not familiar among sava∣ges
or barbarians. Something visible is necessa∣ry
to give them a notion of property: they con∣sider
a man to be proprietor, who possesses and
uses a subject at will; and, independent of pos∣session,
they have no conception of property.
In the laws accordingly of many nations, posses∣sion
is understood to be so essential to property,
that the loss of the former always infers the loss
of the latter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Historical Law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="242"/>
In the progress of nations toward maturity of
understanding, abstract ideas become familiar:
property is abstracted from possession; and in
our conceptions it is now firmly established, that
the want of possession deprives not a man of his
property. If my horse be stolen from me, or
be lost any other way, I am understood notwith∣standing
to retain the property <HI>animo,</HI> or men∣tally.</P>
<P>But how long can the property of a subject be
retained mentally, when separated from posses∣sion?
Is the sense of property so vigorous, as to
carry on the relation for ever? This is a knot∣ty
question, that leads back to the very founda∣tion
of property. As man requires food, rai∣ment,
habitation, and other necessaries; the ma∣terials
from which these are formed, are placed
within his reach, for his industry to work upon.
And to favour his industry, he is endued with a
sense of property, which protects every one's pos∣sessions
from the rapacity of others. I lay hold
of a field, never formerly occupied, and culti∣vate
it for my own use: the perception I have of
its being my property, is clear and complete;
and it is equally so, where I purchase a field from
a person whom I know to have been the first oc∣cupant.
This perception continues equally clear
and complete while I retain possession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sketches of the history of man, book 1. sketch 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="243"/>
Connected with the perception of property, is
an affection of which property is the object, and
which every man feels with respect to what he
possesses as his own. This affection, weak at
first, becomes more vigorous by time: the use
of living in a certain house, or cultivating a cer∣tain
field, enlivens gradually my affection for the
subject as my property, even to extreme old age.</P>
<P>Let us examine the operation of these princi∣ples,
where one has lost possession of a subject.
It is mentioned above, that a man recently de∣prived
of a subject against his will, retains the
property <HI>animo;</HI> and it is evident, that his affec∣tion
for the subject continue as vivid as before.
But do matters continue in that state for ever?
The answer must be in the negative. The man
retains his property <HI>animo,</HI> and his affection for
it, as long as he has any hope of recovery; but
they turn fainter and fainter by length of time.
Hope at last vanishes; the subject wears out
of remembrance, and is absolutely forgotten.
The loss of a moveable soon wears out of me∣mory,
if it be not of great value. Land, which
is a permanent subject and produces a stronger
affection, continues longer in memory. But
where the subject has been long lost and no re∣membrance
of it remaining, the relation of pro∣perty
is dissolved: the sense of property does not
support the relation in that case; but leaves the
<PB N="231" REF="244"/>
subject open to a new occupant, precisely as be∣fore
it was first appropriated.</P>
<P>But whatever may happen to a moveable, land
seldom remains long unoccupied. It frequently hap∣pens,
that while I yet keep my subject in remem∣brance
with some remaining affection for it, an∣other
has purchased the subject <HI>bona fide</HI> from
one who behaved as proprietor. This is the ni∣cest
case that can happen with respect to proper∣perty:
let us carefully examine what the moral
sense dictates upon it. If recently after the pur∣chase,
it be discovered, that the person who sold
had no right; the purchaser, upon consulting his
conscience, will find himself bound to restore the
subject to the true proprietor, provided he still
retain his affection for it, and have kept it all
along in view. But supposing the <HI>bona fide</HI> pur∣chaser
to have been long in possession, and to
have acquired a strong affection for the subject;
the moral sense will determine in his favour, a∣gainst
an antagonist, whose affection for the sub∣ject
must by this time be weak, and his remem∣brance
faint. This antagonist and his heirs have
had time to digest their loss; and by this deci∣sion
of the moral sense, their condition is not ren∣dered
worse than it has been many years. Nor
need any one be alarmed; for care and attention
will secure every proprietor from suffering in that
manner.</P>
<P>How wisely is this matter ordered! The na∣ture
<PB N="232" REF="245"/>
of man would be imperfect with respect to
the goods of fortune, were a subject passing
from a man without his consent, exempted from
commerce as long as it is preserved in memory.
At that rate, property would rest upon a very
crazy foundation: no man could be secure of a
subject, though purchased by him in the fairest
manner: he would always be in dread of latent
claims; and he would never think of improve∣ments.
And yet, upon land depend all the ne∣cessaries,
and most of the conveniences, of li∣ving.
The goods of fortune are bestowed on
man for his well-being; and it would contradict
the designs of Providence, to withdraw any
subject from commerce, so as to be useful to
no person. Consent therefore is not the only
means for transferring property: the law of na∣ture
sustains a <HI>bona fide</HI> purchase with long pos∣session,
as a good title; though it was derived <HI>a
non domino.</HI> There is perhaps at this day, not
a single foot of land possessed upon a better title;
for who is it that can show a chain of uninter∣rupted
conveyances from the first occupant?</P>
<P>The time necessary for transferring pro∣perty
without consent, depends on circumstan∣ces,
which are different in different cases. But
utility requires, that a precise time be fixed to
take place in every case, otherwise law-suits in
matters of prescription would be endless. As this
cannot be done by the law of nature, which gives
<PB N="233" REF="246"/>
to every circumstance its due weight, it is left to
municipal law. All that can be said in general is,
that for the sake of peace, the interest of the pre∣sent
possessor ought to be chiefly regarded in six∣ing
the time. If the former possessor be cut out
when he still retains hope of recovering the sub∣ject,
it seldom happens without negligence on his
part.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>bona fide</HI> possession of a subject, whe∣ther
moveable or immoveable, continued so long
as to produce in the possessor an affection for it
as his own, is, in the law of nature, one mode of
acquiring property. And as property is in this
case acquired without deriving right from the for∣mer
proprietor, the present possessor is consequent∣ly
secure against every claim of property. He
may safely admit, that the claimant was formerly
proprietor; but he urges it as a principle of the
law of nature, and as essential to the well-being of
society, that men be secure in their possessions, ho∣nestly
acquired. The right of an individual yields
here to public utility, as every such right ought
to do.</P>
<P>That the sense of property is finely tempered,
to produce all the good possible with the least hurt,
will appear as follows. In the first place, as pos∣session
of land or of moveables in common is un∣friendly
to industry and improvement, man is dis∣posed
by nature to appropriation; and every man
is protected in his lawful possession by the sense
<PB N="234" REF="247"/>
of property, and by the moral sense. In the
next place, as land and its product are destined
for the use of men, every man is intitled to lay
hold of what is necessary for supplying his wants.
But as all men are by nature equal, no man is
intitled to cut out others, by occupying more
than he has use for If he could justly occupy
more, avarice would have no bounds: the first
savage who landed in Britain, might claim the
whole island as his pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems to be an established law among European nations, That new land belongs to the state by whose subjects it is discovered; and that to ascertain the pro∣perty, no more is necessary but a cross, or some other memorial of the occupation. I am at a loss to compre∣hend upon what principle this law is founded. A man who settles upon a field that belongs to none, becomes proprietor; but symbolical possession will confer no right, either on the person who uses the symbol, or on the state whose subject he is. To acquire the property, and to exclude others, there must be real occupation. Nor will real occupation appropriate more than what may be sufficient for the man and his family: the re∣mainder lies open to new adventurers.</NOTE>. In the third
place, as transference of property by permuta∣tion,
buying and selling, and other covenants, is
essential in society, consent with delivery are the
ordinary means for producing that effect. But if
consent were indispensable for dissolving the rela∣tion
of property, subjects would be often left <HI>in
medio,</HI> abandoned by the proprietor, and yet
<PB N="235" REF="248"/>
<HI>extra commercium</HI> as to others. The law of na∣ture
has more wisely regulated property for the
public good. A man loses his property, when
his hope of recovery is at an end; and the sub∣ject
lies open to the first occupant. And even
where he retains his property <HI>animo,</HI> it is how∣ever
transferred to the person who attains pos∣session
<HI>bona fide</HI> upon a title of property, and
who has contracted an affection for the subject
by long possession. The laws of property are
thus calculated, to produce the greatest good pos∣sible
with the least hurt. Without prescription,
property would often prove a snare to entrap the
innocent.</P>
<P>We proceed to examine, whether, by the
law of nature, other rights be lost by time, as
well as a right of property. An obligation is a
relation between two persons, one who has a
right to claim, termed <HI>obligee,</HI> and one who is
subjected to the claim, termed <HI>obligor.</HI> When
the relation of property wears out of memory,
it is dissolved, and is at an end as if it never had
existed. The same holds naturally with respect
to an obligation. Let us next suppose, that the
obligee retains some faint memory of the obliga∣tion.
Even in this case, if he have negligently
been long silent, he will find it against con∣science,
to give disturbance to the obligor who
lias acquired a conviction of freedom. A pro∣prietor
is deprived of his subject, by suffer∣ing
<PB N="236" REF="249"/>
another to possess it <HI>bona fide</HI> for a long
course of time; and the conviction of freedom
ought to have the same effect in law with the con∣viction
of property. The obligee indeed is in that
case deprived of his claim; but it is a less hardship
that he should suffer by his negligence, than that
his party should suffer who has been in no degree
culpable. A man, diving into the charter-chest
of his ancestor, finds evidence of an obligation
which he is sensible the obligor is ignorant of.
If not more ancient than forty or fifty years, he
will probably think his claim not unjust, even
supposing the obligor to be in straitened circum∣stances.
But every year beyond, he will find it
more and more against conscience to distress a
family, who for many years have had not the
least suspicion of such a claim.</P>
<P>In thus limiting the endurance of obligations,
the moral sense is wisely adjusted to our exter∣nal
circumstances. A man of prudence regulates
his expence by his fortune; and is approved by
all, if he exceed not his annual income. But
were he laid open to debts contracted by a re∣mote
predecessor, and long neglected, it would
often prove a severe forfeiture, reducing him
from ease and affluence to bitter misery. He
would have a feeling of injustice, and be provo∣ked
to exclaim against the oppression of law. If
the obligation be revived, the benefit to the cre∣ditor
will bear no proportion to the suffering of
<PB N="237" REF="250"/>
the debtor; for pain pierces deeper than plea∣sure,
and its impression is of longer endurance.
A man who suffers by his own negligence, has
no just cause of complaint.</P>
<P>As negligence is thus a capital circumstance in
the dissolving obligations by length of time, it
ought carefully to be distinguished from delay.
What if the creditor be reduced to a situation
that disables him to make a demand, till the
debtor, or his heirs, have acquired a conviction
of freedom? He has been a slave in Algiers
many years; or has been long in hiding, to pre∣vent
a criminal prosecution for his life. In such
cases, there is delay, but not negligence. It is
hard indeed on the debtor to have his effects
torn from him for payment of a sum he never rec∣koned
on: but in a competition between two
individuals, where the public is not concerned,
justice ought always to prevail over hardship.</P>
<P>But now supposing negligence on the creditor's
part, what will be the result where the claim is
retained in memory by the debtor? This case
coincides with that of a <HI>mala fide</HI> possessor, who
never can acquire the property by any length of
time. The creditor's negligence will not excuse
the debtor, who ought to have prevented that ne∣gligence
by payment. Nor would it be excusable
in a court of law, to sustain a defence made a∣gainst
conscience.</P>
<P>The obligations that are cut down by the law
<PB N="238" REF="251"/>
of nature, are those only which are intended to
be made instantly effectual, or within a time spe∣cified.
In such, every hour's delay in demand∣ing
performance, is a loss to the obligee; and
consequently a proof of his negligence. Alter∣native
obligations are in a different predicament.
Where a man provides to himself an option of
demanding one thing or another, and is not by
the covenant confined as to time; his delay may
proceed from difficulty in making a choice, and
therefore is no proof of negligence. Nor can
the obligor ever acquire from such delay a con∣viction
of freedom. It is hard indeed for an ob∣ligor
to be kept in suspense for ever; but he has
himself only to blame, for he might have limited
a time for the option.</P>
<P>A conditional obligation is nearly allied to one
that is alternative. It may not always be in the
power of the obligee to perform the condition;
or it may not always be his interest: and there∣fore,
delay in demanding performance, does not
necessarily infer negligence. Take the following
example. A lucrative office in the King's court,
makes me think of erecting a magnificent house
near the palace; but not being perfectly resolved,
the proprietor of a piece of ground agrees to let
me have it at a certain sum, whenever I shall
find it convenient to build. Perceiving a decli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
in favour, I hesitate, and delay building till <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
how matters will turn out. As there is here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="239" REF="252"/>
negligence on my part, my hesitation and delay
can afford no conviction of freedom to my party,
or to his representatives.</P>
<P>A right acquired by convenant over the person
or over the property of another, to be exercised
or not according to my fancy or my interest,
comes under the same predicament. A reversion
in a sale of land is a proper example. It is not
always in my power to repay the price; and it
may sometimes not be my interest. Therefore,
the longest delay in demanding back my land,
will be no proof of negligence on my part,
nor afford to the purchaser any rational convic∣tion
that I am never to make the demand. A
power to revoke a donation between husband and
wife, a power to burden, a power to alter a set∣tlement,
are of the same nature. A man can
never be deprived of such a power, unless he be
limited within a time certain.</P>
<P>In order to give a just notion of our acts con∣cerning
the prescription of forty years, I found
it indispensable to examine with attention what
the law of nature, or, in other words, common
law, dictates upon that subject. And having
thus paved the way, I proceed to a commentary
on these acts.</P>
<P>Prescription is of two kinds; one that relates
to property, and one that relates to obligations.
The former is termed by our writers <HI>Positive
Prescription,</HI> the latter <HI>Negative Prescription.</HI>
<PB N="240" REF="253"/>
These terms are intelligible; and may pass in
law-writings, though scarce agreeable to the ana∣logy
of language. Negative prescription is justly
defined to be the dissolution of an obligation by
length of time. Positive prescription is defined,
the acquisition of a subject by length of time.
The latter definition holds with respect to a move∣able
subject; but we shall soon see, that in the
law of Scotland positive prescription has a very
different meaning with respect to land. I begin
with Negative Prescription, as in some measure
preparatory to the other.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Negative Prescription.</HEAD>
<P>THE time necessary for completing negative
prescription, varies according to circumstances,
some regarding the persons interested, some the
nature of the obligation; and therefore is left by
the law of nature of judges, whose province it
would be, in every particular case, to proportion
the time to the circumstances. But as such lati∣tude
would render judges arbitrary and law∣suits
endless, it was wisely done by our legisla∣ture,
to fix a time that should be a rule in every
case; and accordingly forty years is made the
rule by act 28. parl. 1469. A shorter time would
cramp people in the management of their affairs:
a longer time is unnecessary; for as forty years
<PB N="241" REF="254"/>
exceed the ordinary remembrance of man, they
are in effect equivalent to the longest duration.
The act declares, “That if an obligation be al∣lowed
to lie over forty years without a pursuit,
it shall be of no avail.” The law of nature li∣berates
a debtor, who, by his creditor's negli∣gence,
has acquired a conviction of freedom.
Nothing was left to our legislature, but to accom∣modate
the law of nature to practice, by fixing
the time of presumed remembrance, within which
an obligation must be put in suit.</P>
<P>Little acquainted with the law of nature are
they, who hold prescription to be a creature of
municipal law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grotius <HI>De jure belli ac pacis,</HI> lib. 2. cap. 4. sect. 1.</NOTE>: which leads to another error,
that negative prescription is a punishment inflict∣ed
by municipal law on a creditor for neglecting
to prosecute his claim. Negligence is not a sub∣ject
of punishment; nor is it the intention of the
act 1469, to inflict a punishment on the creditor
for his negligence. It favours indeed a debtor,
who, by the forbearance, or perhaps negligence,
of his creditor, has acquired a conviction of free∣dom;
which consequently renders the obligation
of no avail. But if this be a punishment, every
man is punished who suffers another to take the
start of him in diligence.</P>
<P>I dare not affirm, that the decisions of the
court of session have no taint of these errors.
<PB N="242" REF="255"/>
Though the act 1469, adhering to the law of
nature, has no view but to fix a time for ne∣gative
prescription, our judges, holding erro∣neously
the act to be correctory of the law of na∣ture
and not a confirmation of it, did not ven∣ture
at first to go a single step beyond the precise
letter of the law. From the words, “That an
obligation shall prescribe within forty years,”
it was held, that monolateral obligations only are
comprehended, and that a mutual contract is
not<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, 26th February 1622, Hamilton <HI>contra</HI> Lord Sinclair.</NOTE>. The same error led the court to judge,
that after prescription of forty years, the defend∣ant
is not bound to give his oath whether the
debt be resting owing; and though he should
confess it, that he is not <HI>in foro humano</HI> li∣able
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 7th December 1703, Napier <HI>contra</HI> Campbell.</NOTE> Was it the opinion of the judges, that
forbearance or negligence is declared a crime
by the act, and punished accordingly? Was
it their opinion, that they were tied down by the
act to commit injustice, by sustaining a de∣fence
insisted on against conscience? Was it
their opinion, that the creditor's negligence will
justify the debtor for refusing to pay a sum he
knows to be due? The court of session came in
time to entertain more correct views with respect
to this statute. Discovering that it is founded on
common law, or, which is the same, on the law
<PB N="243" REF="256"/>
of nature; they extended it to every case that
falls under its spirit and intendment. They
extended it to testaments: they extended it
to a reduction on the head of deathbed, and
to every reduction; to tacks, and to servi∣tudes
real and personal: they extended it to
contracts, not excepting contracts of marriage,
where there is a mutual delay of performance.
But what it a contract be kept alive by the mino∣rity
of one of the parties? He may demand per∣formance,
but not unless he perform what is in∣cumbent
on him; for interruption of the negative
prescription on his part, cannot have the effect to
change a mutual contract into a monolateral obli∣gation.
It would have been too great a stretch
to extend the act to heritable bonds; consider∣ing,
that at the period of the act, they were a
species of wadset, and not obligations for pay∣ment
of money. It required therefore another
statute to make heritable bonds, and other land∣securities,
fall by the negative prescription. And
this was done in the second head of the act 12.
parl. 1617. The words are, “And sicklike his
Majesty statutes and ordains, That all actions
upon heritable bonds, reversions, contracts, or
others whatsomever, shall be pursued within
the space of forty years after the date of the
same.” The contracts here mentioned must
be understood to be contracts concerning land;
one of which is mentioned, viz. a reversion:
<PB N="244" REF="257"/>
with respect to other contracts, there was no oc∣casion
for a new statute. A right of property,
whether of land, or of a moveable, differs so
widely from a <HI>jus crediti,</HI> and even from a right
burdening land, that it was never understood to
be comprehended in either of the two statutes
establishing negative prescription. And there∣fore,
though a right of property cannot subsist
for ever without possession; yet the time of its
endurance is limited by the law of nature only
as above mentioned, nor by either of these sta∣tutes.</P>
<P>As the debtor's conviction of freedom arising
from the creditor's forbearing to make a demand,
is the foundation of the negative prescription, the
act 1469 requires a document to be taken by the
creditor, in order to awaken the debtor out of
his dream of security. No activity on the cre∣ditor's
part will be sufficient, but what has the
effect of an interpellation to the debtor. An ob∣ligation
may be the subject of conveyances from
hand to hand, and may be brought into a sum∣mons,
or even into letters of horning: yet if the
debtor have not been interpelled, he is free after
forty years. It has accordingly been found oft∣ener
than once, that registration alone does not
interrupt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spottiswoode, <HI>Prescription,</HI> 27th November 1630, Lord Borthwick <HI>contra</HI> Smeiton; Stair, 12th January 1672, Johnston <HI>Contra</HI> Lord Belhaven.</NOTE>. Nor was even registration with let∣ters
<PB N="245" REF="258"/>
to horning, found sufficient, because it re∣quires
a charge to interpel the debtor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, 11th December 1717, Wright <HI>contra</HI> Wright of Kerse.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is implied in the act 1469, that the negative
prescription should not begin to run but from the
term of payment; because till that term be elap∣sed,
a demand cannot be made, nor a document
be taken on the obligation, as expressed in the
statute. For the same reason, the negative prescrip∣tion
of an action of warrandice, is, in the statute
1617, declared not to commence from the date of
the obligation of warrandice, but from the time
of the distress. Yet with respect to an heritable
bond, the negative prescription is declared, in the
same statute, to commence from the date. Why
this difference? An heritable bond was at that
time a species of wadset: it contained no obliga∣tion
for payment, and consequently no term of
payment. But as an heritable bond contains
now an obligation to pay, and a term of pay∣ment,
the negative prescription will not begin to
run against it before that term.</P>
<P>It is observed above, in tracing the law of na∣ture,
that if the creditor have been prevented
from doing diligence, prescription will not run a∣gainst
him. Negligence cannot be imputed to a
creditor during the time of his slavery in Tunis
or Algiers. Hence <HI>Non valens agere</HI> is a fact that
interrupts the negative prescription. For a simi∣lar
<PB N="246" REF="259"/>
reason, minority is and interruption: a minor
is not understood to be acquainted with his own
affairs; and therefore his silence will not be im∣puted
to him for a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ault.</P>
<P>Neither by the law of nature, nor by statute,
do any obligations fall by negative prescription,
unless where the creditor must blame himself for
negligence in delaying to make a demand. Of that
nature are pure obligations, intended to be made
instantly effectual, or within a time specified;
where delay is a loss to the obligee, and conse∣quently
a proof of his negligence. But there are
obligations which it may be the interest of the
creditor to delay for a long or a short time. Three
kinds of these are mentioned above, alternative
obligations that give an option to the obligee,
conditional obligations, and obligations that be∣stow
a privilege on the obligee to act, or not to
act, at this pleasure. And as with respect to
these our statutes differ not from the law of na∣ture,
all that remains for me, is to illustrate this
doctrine by a few additional examples. A man
lends L. 1000 to bear interest, and stipulates to
himself an option, to demand back the sum, or
a farm belonging to the debtor, reckoned of e∣qual
value. This is an example of the first kind.
Here delay in making the option is not a proof
of negligence, for it may proceed from irresolu∣tion;
and therefore an obligation of this kind
falls not by the negative prescription. Take the
<PB N="247" REF="260"/>
following examples of a conditional obligation.
I take an obligation from a neighbour, to allow
me the use of his water for a bleachfield that I
intend to erect. Being in expectation of a coal∣mine,
I take an obligation from a neighbour, to
allow me a road through his ground for my coal∣waggons.
With respect to such obligations, it is
not always my interest to demand immediate per∣formance.
The bleachfield may require more
money than I have to spare at present: it may be
prudent to delay an expensive operation on my
coal, till the coal about me become scarce. De∣lay
in these cases is not the effect of negligence,
but of prudence. A sale of land under reversion,
is a proper example of the third kind. If the re∣verser
be not limited as to time by covenant,
he may demand back his land at any time, up∣on
offering to restore the price. It is implied in
the very nature of the bargain, that the right of re∣version
should not fall by the negative prescription;
and accordingly it is expressly excepted from that
prescription in the second head of the act 1617.
But shall it be in the power of the reverser to keep
the purchaser in suspense for ever? Equity af∣fords
a remedy. It is against the public interest,
as well as against the interest of the purchaser,
that his land should be put <HI>extra commercium.</HI>
After the reversion has subsisted forty or fifty
years, why should not a declarator be competent
to the purchaser; concluding, that the court
<PB N="248" REF="261"/>
ought to name a time for claiming upon the re∣version,
after which the reversion shall be at an
end? And there is great equity for applying the
same remedy to the other cases mentioned. A
power to revoke a donation between husband and
wife, a power to burden, a power to alter a set∣tlement,
are also examples of the third kind.
But as these powers are personal, they die with
the person who has them; and a court of equity,
therefore, will not interpose to limit them to a
shorter time. Such powers are distinguished in
our law by the appellation of <HI>Res merae faculta∣tis.</HI></P>
<P>There is another species of rights and privile∣ges
more properly termed <HI>res merae facultatis,</HI>
because they concern the privileged person only,
and affect not others; such as my chusing a spot
for a kitchen-garden, planting a tree, or building
a house at my march. It is the purpose of the
negative prescription to relive the obligor from a
burden; but here no person is burdened. Such
rights therefore may be exercised <HI>quandocunque.</HI>
Thus, I can take up a title of honour, or serve
heir to a predecessor, at any distance of time.
Others may be affected consequentially; but no
person suffers directly.</P>
<P>There are certain duties and restraints imposed
upon individuals, not for behoof of other indivi∣duals,
but for behoof of the public. The public
there stands as the obligee; and prescription o∣perates
<PB N="249" REF="262"/>
not against the public. Such restraints
however do not always answer the end proposed;
and though they fall not by the forty years pre∣scription,
yet if there be a total forbearance for a
very long time, they fall into disuse, and cease to
bind.</P>
<P>Having discussed the subjects that fall not under
negative prescription, we proceed to its opera∣tions
on subjects that fall under it. I begin with
annual prestations; of which the interest payable
yearly on a bond of borrowed money, is an ex∣ample.
After forty years the bond falls as to
the principal sum; but does it also fall as to the
interest that became due within the forty years?
The purpose of the negative prescription is to
quiet the minds to people, by securing them a∣gainst
antiquanted claims. As no document has
been taken on the bond for forty years, the sta∣tute
declares, that it shall be of no avail. Now
if the bond be of no avail, it cannot be the foun∣dation
of an action for any of its provisions or ar∣ticles.
Add a separate argument, That the bond
may have been forged, or liable to some other
total objection, the evidence of which is lost by
length of time. In the Roman law accordingly
the interest, as well as the principal, were cut
down by the negative prescription. “Eos qui
principali actione per exceptionem triginta vel
quadraginta annorum, five personali, five hy∣pothecaria,
ceciderunt, (jubemus), non posse
<PB N="250" REF="263"/>
super usuris vel fructibus praeteriti temporis a∣liquam
movere quaestionem, dicendo ex iisdem
temporibus eas velle sibi persolvi, quae non ad
triginta vel quadraginta praeteritos annos refe∣runtur,
asserendo singulis annis earum actio∣nes
nasci: principali enim actione non sub∣sistente,
satis supervacuum est super usuris vel
fructibus adhuc judicem cognoscere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 26. Cod. De usuris.</NOTE>.” To
vary the case a little, we shall suppose, that the
debtor becomes bound to pay the sum borrowed,
not at one term, but at two terms. The credi∣tor
makes a demand, in less than forty years af∣ter
the second moiety became due. The doubt
here is, that prescription begins not to run but
from the term of payment. Here there are two
terms of payment; and if we compute the forty
years from the latter, prescription has not run,
at least of the moiety last payable. On the o∣ther
hand, there has been a delay of forty years
from the time that action was competent for pay∣ment
of the first moiety; and the bond may
have been kept latent to prevent objections. Mo∣ved
by these reasons, it seems the safer side to
sustain the prescription. And the court appears
to have been of the same opinion in the follow∣ing
case. A widow having lived forty years af∣ter
her husband, without demanding her annuity,
her representatives insisted for the annuities that
<PB N="251" REF="264"/>
arose within the forty years. The right of liferent
itself was found to be prescribed; and the defence
of prescription was sustained with respect to the
annuities claimed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 6th July 1711, Stewart <HI>contra</HI> Children of Cummin of Pitoulie.</NOTE> They gave a different judge∣ment
in the following case. Though a bond of
pension granted to an advocate had lain over for∣ty
years, without any document being taken
on it; yet a claim for the yearly pensions that
fell due within the forty years was sustained to
the advocate's representatives<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">July 1730, Lockhart <HI>contra</HI> Duke of Gordon.</NOTE>. This would
have been right, had every year's pension been
contained in a bond by itself. Thus, as to the
negative prescription of annual prestations, the fol∣lowing
conclusions appear well founded. First,
That if the obligation itself be cut off by prescrip∣tion,
none of its accessories can subsist. Second,
That a document taken upon the obligation,
preserves it entire with all its accessories.</P>
<P>As a right to tithes is a right of property, it
falls not by negative prescription. But arrears
beyond forty years fall under it. A claim for feu∣duties
is precisely similar.</P>
<P>The cases of negative prescription that are the
most intricate, arise from obligations where there
are more than one creditor, or more than one
debtor. As the purpose of the statue is mere∣ly
<PB N="252" REF="265"/>
to fix the time of prescription, such cases are
left to common law. The following examples re∣late
to co-creditors. An assignment to a bond of
borrowed money lies over forty years without
being intimated to the debtor; but during part
of the time, the cedent's heir was minor. If
the assignee insist for payment in his own name,
the negative prescription will meet him: but he
may insist in name of the cedent's heir; and up∣on
a proof of the minority, the defence of nega∣tive
prescription must be repelled. The result
will be different where the assignment is intima∣ted.
By that intimation the cedent is complete∣ly
denuded: the assignee must insist in his own
name; and if forty years have elapsed since the
intimation, the debtor is free. In a competition
for mails and duties between two real creditors,
one had right to an apprising by a disposition,
and the other had right to the same apprising
by an adjudication. The disponee was prefer∣able;
but had done no diligence for forty years:
the adjudger had preserved his right entire by di∣ligence.
The adjudger was preferred to the
mails and duties *. This is a case <HI>in apicibus
juris.</HI> One thing is clear, that the debtor, if
left at liberty, has it in his power to prefer either
of the competitors at his pleasure. He can put
the disponee out of the field, by pleading the ne∣gative<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">26th November 1728, Fraser <HI>contra</HI> Mackenzie.</NOTE>
<PB N="253" REF="266"/>
prescription; and then the adjudger, left
without a competitor, can levy the mails and du∣ties:
or he may forbear to plead the negative pre∣scription
against the disponee; who consequently
will levy the mails and duties upon his prefer∣able
right. But equity will not suffer such game
to be played. The debtor has no interest to
plead the negative prescription, because, in all e∣vents,
the mails and duties must be paid to one
or other of the competitors: he may therefore
be justly set aside as having no concern in the
question; and when he is out of the field, the
disponee must be preferred, as having the prefer∣able
right. This is one of many cases that is bet∣ter
fitted for the silence of a study, than for the
bustle of a court of law.</P>
<P>An infeftment of annualrent is conveyed, in
one deed, to John and James, equally betwixt
them. John's right is saved from the negative
prescription, by drawing payment of interest, or
by a process of mails and duties. James has done
nothing for forty years. John's diligence will
not save James, who has taken no document on
his claim. But then can the debtor have acqui∣red
any conviction of freedom with respect to the
claim of James, which he sees established in the
same deed with that of John? This is a difficult
case. James, it is true, has been negligent;
but negligence alone is not a sufficient ground
for the negative prescription. I incline to distin∣guish
<PB N="254" REF="267"/>
the original debtor from his heir or suc∣cessor.
When the original debtor is sued by
James for payment after the forty years, he ought
not to be suffered to plead the negative prescrip∣tion,
when he must be conscious, that he has not
paid a shilling to James, principal or interest.
His heir or successor is in a different condition.
He is warranted to plead, from the silence of
forty years, that the debt has been paid, or dis∣charged.
This reasoning is also applicable to an
adjudication disponed to two persons equally.</P>
<P>Next as to co-obligants. It must be yielded,
that a co obligant cannot reasonably entertain the
same conviction of freedom from the creditor's
delay, that a single obligant may have: the cre∣ditor
may have been abundantly diligent against
the other co-obligants. But at that rate, a co-obligant
may be kept bound for ever, without e∣ver
hearing of the debt, contrary to the spirit of
the law of nature, or of common law. The
hardship is great, and calls for a remedy. The
remedy is easy; which is, to oblige the creditor
to take a document against each of the co-obli∣gants.
Between two persons so intimately con∣nected
as creditor and debtor, equity certainly
rules, that the one should be relieved from a ve∣ry
great hardship, imposing a very slight bur∣den
on the other. Our decisions however, I
am sorry to say, square not with this conclusion.
It has frequently been found, that prescription
<PB N="255" REF="268"/>
is interrupted as to every co-obligant by diligence
done against any one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair; Dirleton, 18th December 1667, Nicolson <HI>contra</HI> Laird of Philorth; Forbes, 23d February 1714, Earl of Marchmont <HI>contra</HI> Home.</NOTE>. And an infeftment of
annualrent having been constituted upon two te∣nements
by two different seisins, a poinding of
the ground of one of the tenements, was found
to preserve the right alive upon the other tene∣ment,
though they belonged to different proprie∣tors
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stair, 22d June 1671, Lord Balmerino <HI>contra</HI> Ha∣milton.</NOTE>. The court in these cases seem to have
formed a notion, as if the negative prescription
were only intended to punish the negligence of
creditors; and consequently that it cannot ope∣rate
against a creditor who has in any degree
been active. It ought to have been considered,
as above mentioned, that negligence is not a
subject of punishment; and that the intendment
of negative prescription, is to quiet the minds
of people who have acquired a conviction of free∣dom,
from being left undisturbed forty years.
The court judged more correctly in the following
cases. A party was exempted from the jurisdic∣tion
of a regality, having more than forty years
answered to the sheriff's court only, and never
once to the regality-court; though the juris∣diction
of regality was in constant exercise as to
<PB N="256" REF="269"/>
others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, 23d November 1671, Rolland <HI>contra</HI> Laird of Craigyvar.</NOTE>. The whole barony of Musselburgh,
comprehending the tenement of Coldcoats, was,
by a constitution in writ, thirled to the mill of
the barony, belonging to the town of Mussel∣burgh;
and the town had been in the uninter∣rupted
possession of the whole multures, those of
Coldcoats excepted. In a declarator of thirlage,
the town of Musselburgh against Wauchope of
Edmonstone, proprietor of Coldcoats, negative
prescription was pleaded. Answered, That the
town's possession of the multures of the rest of the
barony, preserves their right entire as to the
whole. But the court, justly considering that the
defendant had acquired a conviction of freedom
by the lapse of forty years, sustained his defence
of prescription. The nature of the subject in
controversy, paved the way to this judgement:
the several tenements that compose a barony are
separate subjects, and frequently not contermi∣nous,
being connected only by a common char∣ter;
which makes it easy to conceive, that some
of the tenements may be free, while others are
thirled. The case is fundamentally the same in a
thirlage of <HI>omnia grana crescentia.</HI> And yet,
in that thirlage the defence of prescription was
repelled with respect to the multure of bear;
because the thirlage was preserved alive as to all
<PB N="257" REF="270"/>
other grain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">25th July 1727, Macleod <HI>contra</HI> Vassals of Muira∣venside.</NOTE>. What seems to have misled the
court in this particular is, that the several species
of grain comprehended under a thirlage of <HI>omnia
grana cresc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntia,</HI> are more intimately connect∣ed,
than the several tenements that are subjected
to it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Positive Prescription.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper to premise a short sketch of
the Roman <HI>usucapio;</HI> because our positive pre∣scription
is held to be of the same nature, by eve∣ry
writer on the law of Scotland; though erro∣neously,
as shall be made appear, with respect to
land. <HI>Usucapio</HI> is defined, “adjectio dominii
per continuationem possessionis temporis lege
definiti<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">l. 3. De usurpationibus et usucapionibus.</NOTE>.” <HI>Usucapio</HI> accordingly is one of
the modes of acquiring dominion or property.
The time was at first a year in a moveable, and
two years in land; a pregnant evidence, that the
sense of property, separately from possession, was
but in its infancy when <HI>usucapio</HI> was introduced.
Property originally was lost with the possession, as
above hinted; and by this regulation it appears
to have been the opinion of the Romans, that
<PB N="258" REF="271"/>
property could not have any long endurance in∣dependent
of possession. In the days of Justi∣nian,
when abstract ideas had become familiar, and
property was clearly distinguished from possession,
three years were declared necessary for <HI>usucapio</HI>
in moveables, and ten, or twenty, in different ca∣ses,
for <HI>usucapio</HI> in land.</P>
<P>How far the Roman <HI>usucapio</HI> obtains with us
in moveables, will appear from what follows.
First, With respect to a moveable found by ac∣cident,
that appears to have passed through the
hand of art, and which therefore must have
been appropriated, occupancy will not transfer
the property to the finder. If the moveable have
not been lost forty years, the proprietor is presu∣med
to have retained the possession <HI>animo,</HI> and
he will be pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erred to all the world. If forty
years have elapsed from the time of his loss, he
is cut out, and the moveable goes to the fise.
<HI>A fortiori,</HI> it will go to the fise if no proprietor
appear; which is the case of waith and stray
goods, of wreck, of a treasure found in the
ground, &amp;c. But any of these particulars acqui∣red
from a putative proprietor, will go to the ac∣quirer,
upon possesing forty years, which com∣pletes
<HI>usucapio.</HI> The former proprietor may
have retained the hope of recovery; but his right
yields to that of his competitor, who by long pos∣session
has acquired an affection for the subject.</P>
<P>A moveable never formerly appropriated, be∣longs
<PB N="259" REF="272"/>
to the sinder as the first occupant. If it be
uncertain whether the moveable have been for∣merly
appropriated or not, the finder may lay
hold of it, and the property will be his, unless
some person appear, and prove that it was for∣merly
his property. If he appear soon after the
new occupancy, the subject must be restored to
him. But if the sinder have continued forty
years in possession upon the <HI>bona fide</HI> title of first
occupant, the property will be transferred to him
by <HI>usucapio.</HI></P>
<P>With respect to land, our positive prescription
differs widely from the Roman <HI>usucapio.</HI> All
the lands in Scotland are understood to have flow∣ed
from the sovereign originally; and every por∣tion
of land that is abandoned by the proprietor
returns to the sovereign, and is not left open to
the first occupant. If a portion of deserted land
be laid hold of by a private person, no length of
time will transfer the property to him; because
he ought to know that it belongs to the crown,
and that he can have no right.</P>
<P>Thus, before the act 12. parl. 1617, fixing
forty years for completing positive prescription,
it was necessary, in a competition about the pro∣perty
of land, that each of the competitors should
connect with the crown. The longest possession,
without a crown-charter, yielded to such a char∣ter
of the latest date. For some time after wri∣ting
was employed in land-property, this was no
<PB N="260" REF="273"/>
hardship; because title-deeds were few, and easily
preserved. But in a long progress from the King,
where the land has passed through many hands,
title-deeds multiply greatly; and great must have
been the difficulty of preserving them entire du∣ring
the feudal anarchy, when even the nearest
neighbours entertained deadly feud against each
other. The loss however of any one connecting
title was fatal. Suppose a family-estate to have
been possessed two or three centuries by connect∣ed
services; yet if the charter from the crown
was missing, the family had no defence against a
charter of yesterday obtained by another from
the crown. Or suppose the original charter to
have been preserved, yet any gap in the progress
might be fatal, the loss of a disposition to a sin∣gular
successor, of a procuratory of resignation,
of a precept of <HI>Clare conflat,</HI> or of any other
midcouple. Nor was this all. At the period of
the act 1469, fixing the course of the negative
prescription, writing was rare; it was confined to
notaries: and forgery was unknown. But when
writing became common, and yet not brought to
such perfection as that different hands could be
clearly distinguished, the easiness of committing a
forgery was a strong temptation to designing
men. Before the seventeenth century according∣ly,
forgery became frequent, dangerous above
all to proprietors of land.</P>
<P>Wonderful it is, that, even among a rude
<PB N="261" REF="274"/>
people, a law so replete with mischief to land-proprietors,
was so long submitted to. The first
attempt to a remedy was act 214. parl. 1594, ha∣ving
the following preamble: “That sundry of
the lieges, and their predecessors and authors,
have bruiked their lands by infeftment for the
space of forty years: notwithstanding whereof
the said infeftments are sundry times drawn in
question for lack of procuratories or instru∣ments
of resignation, precepts of <HI>Clare con∣stat,</HI>
or other precepts of seisin, which are not
extant, to be produced and used, in respect
the same are tynt and amitted, partly by ini∣quity
of time, partly by perishing of proto∣cols,”
&amp;c. For these reasons it is enacted,
That where parties, and their predecessors and
authors, have had a continued possession forty
years on charter and seisin, they shall not be
bound to produce procuratories, or instru∣ments
of resignation, precepts of <HI>Clare con∣stat,</HI>
or other precepts of seisin; provided the
charter bear, that resignation was duly made,
and the instrument of seisin make mention of
the precept.” Improvements that have inve∣terate
practice to struggle with, are faint in their
commencement, and slow at first in their pro∣gress.
The remedy here was extremely faint,
as it removed but a very small part of the evils
specified above. It was however a lucky attempt,
as it paved the way to the illustrious statute 1617,
<PB N="262" REF="275"/>
which may justly be considered as the palladium
of our land-proprietors: its rationality and ex∣pedience
have been confirmed by the practice of
more than a century and a half.</P>
<P>This statute consists of two heads. The pur∣pose
of the first, is to secure proprietors against
every person claiming the property. The pur∣pose
of the other, is to protect them against real
debts and claims affecting property. Upon the
first head, the preamble is in effect the same with
that of the act 1594: “Our Sovereign Lord
considering the great prejudice his lieges sus∣tain
in their lands and heritages, not only by
the abstracting, corrupting, and concealing
their true evidents in their minority, and by
the amission thereof through war, plague, fire,
&amp;c.; but also by the forging of false evidents,
and concealing the same for for so long a time,
as that all means of improving thereof is taken
away; whereby his lieges are constitute in a
great uncertainty of their heritable rights,”
&amp;c.: Therefore enacted, That possession for forty
years without interruption upon a title of proper∣ty
shall give an unquarrelable right, good against
all mortals, and against all objections, falsehood
only excepted. And to that end, it is declared
sufficient, that the possessor produce for his title,
either a charter and seisin of the land, or instru∣ments
of seisin, one or more, continued, and
standing together, for the said space of forty years,
<PB N="263" REF="276"/>
proceeding either upon retours, or upon precepts
of <HI>Clare constat.</HI></P>
<P>There are two evils to which every proprietor
of land is liable. One is the hazard of losing
title-deeds, which increases with the time of pos∣session;
the other is the hazard of false deeds,
keept latent till all means of detection are gone.
The same remedy is provided for both; which
is, that possession forty years upon a title of pro∣perty,
shall be held a complete right to the land,
effectual against every competitor. This not on∣ly
frees the possessor from the necessity of produ∣cing
more ancient titles, but secures him against
antiquated claims of property, upon the statutory
presumption, that they are not true and honest
claims.</P>
<P>The security of land-property is the purpose
of the act 1594; and to make it still more secure,
is the purpose of the first head of the act under
consideration. In neither of the acts is there
the slightest hint of depriving a man of his pro∣perty
by neglect, and of transferring it to ano∣ther
by peaceable possession. The are founded
on the most liberal principles of justice: they se∣cure
property, after long possession, against the
loss of ancient title-deeds; and they secure it a∣gainst
latent claims of property that may justly be
presumed ill founded when suffered to lie long
dormant. Our positive prescription of land-pro∣perty,
ought to be carefully distinguished from
<PB N="264" REF="277"/>
the Roman <HI>usucapio;</HI> for there is no resemblance
between them.</P>
<P>An inclination to differ from others is not a∣greeable;
but I stand not single with respect to
the doctrine here inclucated. I am supported
by Lord Dirleton, who breathed the true spirit
of law, if any ever did. He observes, “That
the positive prescription is introduced, not so
much <HI>odio et negligentia non petentis,</HI> as <HI>fa∣vore
possidentis</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dirleton's doubts,</HI> Prescription against the King.</NOTE>.” How comes it then that
the statute 1617 is treated by all our writers,
Lord Dirleton only excepted, as an odious reme∣dy,
depriving a man of his property without his
consent? Our law-authors were educated abroad
by professors of the Roman law; and having had
no professors at home, they were left to gather the
law of their own country by hints, scraps, and
occasional practice. As in several articles out
law resembled that of the Romans, prepossession
for the Roman law led our authors insensibly to
adopt that law, and to pass it for our own,
where-ever they could discover any appearance of
a resemblance.</P>
<P>But to return to the statute. With respect to
the first head, it is enacted, That those who have
possessed forty years on a title of property “shall
never be troubled, pursued, nor inquieted, by
his Majesty, nor by any other superior or au∣thor,
<PB N="265" REF="278"/>
nor by any other person pretending right
to the land by prior infeftments, public or pri∣vate,
nor upon any other ground, reason, or
argument, except upon falsehood.” These
words are plain and peremptory, admitting no
objection to the statutory title but singly that of
falsehood; an exception that scarce needed to
have been mentioned, because a false title is no
title: it is a title in appearance only, not in rea∣lity.
We are authorised by the statute to pre∣sume
every thing in favour of long possession.
The possessor's ancient titles connecting him with
the crown, may have been lost: his competitor's
titles may have been forged; or supposing them
true deeds, he may have been denuded, forty
years ago, in favour of the possessor, or of those
he connects with. In a word, possession forty
years on a title of property, is declared, by the
statute, to be a complete title to land, that must
prevail in every competition. The possessor has
no occasion to plead negative prescription, or a∣ny
other ground, against his competitor's right;
he need say no more but that his own title is pre∣ferable.
The law of prescription is in every part
consistent with itself. Land-property, as obser∣ved
above, is not subjected to negative prescrip∣tion
by our statutes; and if after forty years a
claim of property could be sustained against the
party in possession, the positive prescription would
afford no security: the act 1617 would be an idle
<PB N="266" REF="279"/>
attempt, without success. The statute is guilty of
no blunder: it secures the possessor against every
claim of property, public or private, without
needing the assistance of the negative prescription.
And it makes no difference, whether the compe∣ting
title be proof against the negative prescrip∣tion
<HI>sua natura,</HI> or be kept alive by a <HI>non va∣lentia
agendi,</HI> or by minority, or by any other
means. If it be urged, that an innocent person
ought not to be forfeited of a just claim; I an∣swer,
that a claim latent forty years is justly sus∣pected
of having been kept in the dark in order
to evade detection; and therefore is not a just
claim. But possibly the claimant may have been
<HI>non valens agere</HI> the whole forty years, or part
of them. This case is extremely favourable for
the claimant; and yet even here, the right of
an individual ought to yield to public utility.
The statute, in preferring the possessor, has acted
by an equitable rule, That where public utility is
at variance with the interest of an individual, the
former ought to prevail. Nor is more done in
the statute, than is commonly practised even by a
court of equity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Principles of Equity, conclusion of book 2.</NOTE>. The public utility here is ob∣vious.
Were any excuse to be sustained to one
who claims the property for not appearing with∣in
the forty years, the salutary purpose of the
statute would, in a great measure, be frustrated.
<PB N="267" REF="280"/>
The possessor might be troubled, pursued, and
inquieted, not for forty years only, but for four
hundred. And as there can be no record of a
<HI>non valentia agendi,</HI> of minority, nor of many
other interruptions, the record could be little de∣pended
on in making a purchase of land. It is
hard indeed to make the positive prescription o∣perate
in such cases: but it is a maxim in law,
as well as in politics, That a small evil ought to
be submitted to for preventing a greater; and
there cannot be a greater evil than uncertainty a∣bout
the property of land, which would bar all
improvements.</P>
<P>With respect to minority, in particular, it is
justly protected against the negative prescription;
the declared purpose of which is, to render a
claim suspicious, and to cut it down, because it
is not prosecuted in time: now such neglect can∣not
be attributed to a minor, who is not suppo∣sed
to have any knowledge of his own affaris.
In the court of session accordingly, minority is
sustained as an interruption of the negative pre∣scription;
though the act 1469 declares in gene∣ral,
that obligations shall be of no avail after for∣ty
years, unless a document be taken upon them;
without any mention of minority as an excep∣tion.
The positive prescription is very different.
In a competition among creditors, minority af∣fords
no privilege: the slightest defect of form is
available against a minor, as well as against one
<PB N="268" REF="281"/>
of full age, to postone him to other creditors.
And the same rule ought to hold in a competi∣tion
about the property of land.</P>
<P>I give peculiar attention to the case of minori∣ty,
as I reckon upon strong prepossession against
me from the decisions of the court of session;
though all of them, as far as I know, are of a
late date. The first case where minority was
found to be privileged against the positive pre∣scription,
is Hamilton-Blair of that Ilk <HI>contra</HI>
Feuers of Kerseland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">6th December 1754.</NOTE>. Hamilton-Blair having
right as patron to the teinds of the parish of Dal∣ry,
brought a process against the feuers of Kerse∣land,
for payment of the teinds of their lands.
The defendants produced charters and seisins
from Ker of Kerseland containing an heritable right
to the teinds of the lands, upon which possession
was continued forty years without interruption.
The pursuer answered, That the positive pre∣scription
was interrupted by his minority; and
the reply was, That minority interrupts not the
positive prescription. The question was thought
worty of a solemn pleading; and the following
judgement was the result. “The Lords find,
That the years of minority must be deducted
from the years of positive prescription.” The
pursuer's counsel pleaded the case, as if our po∣sitive
prescription were the same with the Ro∣man
<PB N="269" REF="282"/>
<HI>usucapio,</HI> where one man loses his right
<HI>non utendo,</HI> and another acquires it <HI>utendo.</HI>
Were our positive prescription of that kind, mi∣nority
would be an effectual interruption; for,
in the Roman <HI>usucapio,</HI> one cannot acquire a
subject by possession till the former proprietor
have lost it by dereliction, resembling our nega∣tive
prescription, which runs not against a minor.
But it is cleared above, that positive prescription
in Scotland, is entirely independent of the nega∣tive;
and that positive prescription, being a com∣plete
title, is exclusive of every other title. The
judges divided on this question. Such of them
as were for the judgement, did not enter into the
distinction between positive and negative prescrip∣tion
with respect to minority: they suffered them∣selves
to be led by the authority of Stair and
Mackenzie, and by the prepossession of common
opinion. This judgement paved the way to an∣other,
given lately, in the case of Campbell of
Ottar, where a title of property to a land-estate,
kept alive by successive minorities, was found
good against the positive prescription; though
possession had been continued more than four∣score
years, upon an unexceptionable title of pro∣perty.</P>
<P>With respect to both cases, the last especially,
it puzzles me to conceive what occasion there could
be for bringing minority into the question. The
claimant had no occasion for minority: he had a
<PB N="270" REF="283"/>
more simple proposition to maintain, viz. That a
right of property falls not by the negative pre∣scription;
and consequently requires not the sup∣port
of minority, nor of any other interruption.
And it is observed above, that if the positive pre∣scription
could not take place without the nega∣tive,
it could never take place.</P>
<P>With respect to interruptions in general, the
act 1617 declares in effect, that no interruptions
shall avail against the positive prescription, but
what disturb peaceable possession of the land;
and it is of great importance to the public, that
the law should stand so. We have seen how
precarious land-rights were originally. The po∣sitive
prescription was introduced, when the art
of husbandry was in its infancy: and but for that
prescription, it never could have arrived to any
maturity; because no man who is not secure in
his possession, will bestow skill or labour in ferti∣lising
his land. But if a claim to land without
possession could be kept alive by minority, by a
<HI>non valentia agendi,</HI> or by other particulars that
interrupt the negative prescription, a land-holder,
even after a forty-years possession, would have
little encouragement to lay out his money upon
building, inclosing, planting, or other costly
improvements: the ground would yield scanty
crops, and the public would suffer. The salutary
effects of negative prescription are far from being
so extensive: it concerns only two individuals,
<PB N="271" REF="284"/>
an obligee and an obligor; and it is of little con∣cern
to the public, whether the obligor be pro∣tected
from performance by negative prescription,
or whether the obligee make his claim effectual
by proving interruptions. It is a matter of pri∣vate
right; and justice rules, that the creditor
should not suffer, seeing he is not blameable for
his delay.</P>
<P>To illustrate the doctrine above laid down, that
positive prescription is entirely independent of ne∣gative
prescription, I lay hold of a point, more
than once determined in the court of session;
which is, Whether a deed of ential can be cut
down by prescription? In order to talk intelli∣gibly,
I state a simple case. A land-estate stands
entailed upon heirs-male, with clauses irritant
and resolutive; and the entail is completed accor∣ding
to the directions of the act 1685. The
eldest son of the entailer, neglecting the entail,
makes up his title to the estate as heir of line;
by which the estate becomes a fee-simple in him;
and he and his male descendents continue in
possession upon that title more than forty years.
The succession at length opens to a female,
the only child of the last possessor; and she, as
heir of line, makes up her title to the estate.
By her succession, an interest arises to a collateral
heir-male, who claims as heir of entail. This
claim is not cut down by negative prescription;
for an evident reason, that till the heir-female ap∣peared,
<PB N="272" REF="285"/>
the claimant had no interest upon which
to found an action; and therefore could not be
guilty of negligence in forbearing. Nay, a case
can be put where he would have a better chance
for the estate as heir of line, than as heir of en∣tail;
which is, that he had a number of daugh∣ters
without a son, while the heir in possession
had neither son nor daughter for many years that
he lived with his first wife; and came only at the
close of life to have a son by a second wife. But
still further, his claim as heir of entail against
an heir-female in possession, is a claim to the pro∣perty
of the estate; and it is laid down above,
that negative prescription cannot be objected to
such a claim. But it is clear from the act 1617,
that the claim of the heir of entail is cut down
by positive prescription. The female heir who,
by completing her title as heir of line, has be∣come
proprietor of the estate, pleads, in the very
words of the statute, that she and her predeces∣sors
having possessed forty years on a title of pro∣perty,
“she is secure against every other person
pretending right to the estate, upon any
ground, reason, or argument, except upon
falsehood.” The deed of entail may have
been forged: it may have been altered or dis∣charged.
In a word, every possible supposition is
admitted as true, that tends to support the right
of the present possessor. And justly; for if
the possessor be protected by positive prescription
<PB N="273" REF="286"/>
against a stranger, whose title to the estate must
have been sustained had it been produced with∣in
the forty years; much more ought she to be
protected against the heir of an antiquated entail.
To cut down the stranger may in reality be a for∣feiture
of his right to the estate; to cut down the
heir of entail, is no greater stretch than to deprive
him of a hope of succession, which may often be
both distant and uncertain. Such a trifling interest
ought not to weigh against the interest of every
landholder; and still less against the interest of
the society in general, as improvements can ne∣ver
go on in a country where the property of
land remains in any degree uncertain. And ac∣cordingly
where an estate has been possessed for
forty years as a fee-simple, the positive prescrip∣tion
has been sustained against the heir of entail,
in every case brought before the court; particu∣larly
with respect to the estate of Achluncart,
31st December 1693; with respect to the estate
of Mackerston, 10th July 1739; with respect to
the estate of Kirkness, 3d February 1753; and
lately, 17th December 1776, in the important
cause between Douglas of Douglas and the Duke
of Hamilton.</P>
<P>We proceed to the second head of the act
1617, extending negative prescription to heri∣table
bonds, and to other heritable securities.
Forty years possession on a title of property, is
exclusive of every other title of property; be∣cause
<PB N="274" REF="287"/>
the same subject cannot belong to two per∣sons
at the same time: but as a right of proper∣ty
is consistent with a real security for debt, pos∣session
<HI>qua</HI> proprietor is not exclusive of a real
security. What protection then have land-pro∣prietors
against a real security that has lain dor∣mant
above forty years? I answer, that by the
law of nature, and by common law, a man who
has acquired a conviction of freedom is protect∣ed
from antiquated claims. The act 1469 was
made to enforce the law of nature, and common
law, with respect to personal obligations; and the
second head of the statute 1617 was made to en∣force
them with respect to real obligations. The
words are, “And sicklike, his Majesty statutes
and ordains, That all actions competent of the
law upon heritable bonds, reversions, con∣tracts,
or others whatsomever, shall be pur∣sued
within the space of forty years after the
date of the same.” As here the negative
prescription is extended to real claims, and as
that prescription is founded on negligence, it fol∣lows,
that every circumstance which purges ne∣gligence
must be admitted here, as well as with
respect to personal obligations. The statute ac∣cordingly
declares minority in this case to be an
interruption; and from parity of reason, <HI>non
valens agere</HI> must also be an interruption. Here,
by the by, a very strong argument can be drawn
from the statute itself, that minority does not
<PB N="275" REF="288"/>
interrupt the positive prescription. When an ex∣press
exception of minority from the negative
prescription of real securities, was thought neces∣sary;
can any man believe, that it was left to
be implied as an exception from positive prescrip∣tion?
It is not naturally an exception; and had
the legislature intended to make it an exception,
there was much more reason for speaking out,
than in the case of negative prescription.</P>
<P>The statutes of this island are not illustrious
for profound knowledge. The exceptions are
few, and the present act 1617 is one of the most
illustrious. It is strictly agreeably to the com∣mon
law, and to the law of nature, not only in
the principal parts above displayed, but in every
minute particular. Take for example a right of
reversion, which is mentioned above in the class
of <HI>res merae facultatis,</HI> where a man provides
to himself a power to exercise the faculty or not,
as he finds it convenient; and where therefore
delay is no evidence of dereliction, nor even of
negligence. Conformable to this definition, the
statute provides, That an action upon a right of
reversion shall be perpetual; provided the rever∣sion
be ingrossed in the infeftment, or be record∣ed,
which remove all suspicion of forgery or false∣hood.
But a letter of reversion distinct from the
infeftment, and not recorded, falls by the nega∣tive
prescription. Why? Not from dereliction
or negligence; but from suspicion of falsehood,
<PB N="276" REF="289"/>
or other defect, the evidence of which is lost by
length of time. Advert to another particular.
The negative prescription of an action of war∣randice,
is declared not to commence from the
date of the obligation of warrandice, but from
the time of distress. The reason is good: before
distress, no action of warrandice lies; and till
warrandice be competent, no length of time can
infer a suspicion of negligence or of falsehood.
Why then is it enacted, that a pursuit on an
heritable bond must be commenced within forty
years of its date? This is explained above. An
heritable bond, a species of wadset originally,
was not an obligation for payment of money,
and consequently could not have a term of pay∣ment.
In its present form, it is an obligation
for payment of money, and has a term of pay∣ment;
from which term prescription will com∣mence
as in other obligations.</P>
<P>Thus, heritable bonds, and other heritable
securities, preserved alive against negative pre∣scription,
must, for the reason above given, pre∣vail
also against positive prescription. But these
must be distinguished from a process of redemp∣tion
founded on a letter of reversion. For
though the reversion be recorded, which secures
it against negative prescription, it is not however
effectual against positive prescription. It is a
claim to the property of the land, clogged only
with a condition of paying a certain sum; and as
<PB N="277" REF="290"/>
positive prescription makes a complete title to the
property, it excludes, of necessary consequence, a
claim of redemption, no less effectually than it
excludes every other claim of property.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Analysis of act 39. parl. 1555, about the
warning of tenants.</HEAD>
<P>AS far back as our law can be traced histori∣cally,
Martinmas appears to have been the
term of the entry and removing of tenants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See article 17.</NOTE>.
But in the sixteenth century, and perhaps more
early, Whitsunday had become the term of en∣try
and of removing; whether from the difficul∣ty
of transporting household-furniture, and other
goods, through bad roads, in the dead of winter,
or from other causes, our authors give us no in∣formation.
Craig, setting forth the form of
warning before the statute under consideration
was made, mentions Whitsunday as the only
term of removing. “Dominus ante fores colo∣ni,
cui verbo denunciaret ut ad proximam Pen∣tecosten
migret, lancem ligneam, sive discum
escarium, in duas partes frangebat, eo symbo∣lo
diremptum jus foederis et locationis signifi∣cans
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. dieg. 9. sect. 4.</NOTE>.” And he adds, “Secundo post Pen∣tecosten
die, nisi colonus volens migrave∣rit,
vi eum ex aedibus pellebat, pecora sive
boves ex bovilibus ejiciens, suas pecudes ad
<PB N="279" REF="292"/>
pascendum inducens.” Lord Stair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 2. tit. 9. sect. 39.</NOTE> joins
his authority to that of Craig. “The order of re∣moving
of old (says he) was thus. The ma∣ster
of the ground did only verbally intimate to
the tenant to remove at the next Whitsunday;
and the only solemnity requisite was, that be∣fore
the said term he appeared before the door
of the tenant, and broke a lance there, as a
symbol of his braking the tacit relocation be∣tween
them; whereupon, the second day af∣ter
Whitsunday, he came <HI>brevi manu,</HI> and
expelled the tenant.” At the same time, the
authority of these writers is little necessary, when
we have the authority of the statute itself, men∣tioning
Whitsunday as the only term of remo∣ving.
It appoints, “That the master of the
ground give a precept of warning in writ,
commanding his officer to go, forty days prece∣ding
Whitsunday, and intimate to the tenant,
that he remove himself, his family, subtenants,
&amp;c. at the said term.” This fact I wish to be
kept in view; for it will contribute greatly to
a just analysis of the statute under consideration.</P>
<P>It appears not that the legislature intended to
alter the practice at that time established, con∣cerning
either the time of warning, or the term
of removing; but only to introduce regularity
and order in the form of removing; instead of
<PB N="280" REF="293"/>
a removing <HI>via facti,</HI> which, is those rude times,
commonly produced riots, and braches of the peace.
Listen to Craig in the place above quoted. “At
cum saepe fieret, ut colonus, suis amicis fretus,
migrare nollet, et vi domini vim opponeret,
factum est saepe, ut qui viribus plus posset, is
in possessione effet potior; tantumque de vi, et
violentis fructibus, domino, si pellere colonum
non potuisset, superesset actio; inde cum gra∣vissimae
saepe contentiones procederent, saepe
etiam ad manus perveniretur.” In that view
it is enacted, that if the party warned, removed
not at the term, the warner shall apply to a pro∣per
court for a decree of removing; to which
succeeds a precept of ejection. And to secure
access to a proper court, it is ordained, “That
shiriffs and other judges ordinair hold courts
all the lawful fifteen days immediately after
Trinity Sunday, for doing justice in the said
causes.”</P>
<P>This was a remedy for the evil in view; but
it generated a greater evil of a different kind.
Every process that has a personal conclusion, is
in effect a complaint against a party, for doing
what he ought not to have done, or for omitting
what he ought to have done. At the time of
this statute, accordingly, and for many years af∣ter,
there could be no process, till the party had
done what was wrong, or omitted to do what
was right. A process, for example, could not
<PB N="281" REF="294"/>
be raised against a debtor before the term of pay∣ment;
because till that term was elapsed, it could
not be subsumed, that he had omitted what he
ought to have done. Nor could a process of re∣moving
be raised against a tenant, till the term
of removing was passed. The statute accordingly
does not direct a court of removing to be held
before Whitsunday, the term of removing; but
as soon after as possible, viz. immediately after
Trinity Sunday, which is the first Sunday after
Whitsunday. It is amazing, that, even in an
age of darkness, the insufficiency of this re∣gulation
was not foreseen. A landlord, after
warning his tenant to remove at Whitsunday, en∣gages
another to enter at that term. He cannot
eject the possessor, as formerly, to make way for
his new tenant. He must apply to a judge, and
cannot bring his complaint till the term of remo∣ving
be past. The possessor, assisted by his pro∣curator,
invents many defences, sufficient to pro∣long
the process perhaps for a year. The new
tenant is left without resource, not a house to
protect him from the cold, nor a mouthful of
grass to preserve his cattle from famine. The
condition of landlords was deplorable. They
could not with safety engage a new tenant, till
the possessor was actually ejected; and the land
must have lain waste the rest of that year.</P>
<P>Violent diseases operate frequently their own
cure. Necessity introduced a salutary deviation
<PB N="282" REF="295"/>
from common law; which is, to sustain a process
of removing before the term of removing. The
commissioners for administration of justice ap∣pointed
by Oliver Cromwell, appear to be the
first who thought of a remedy for this disease.
In the record of their proceedings, is found the
following regulation: “That summons of remo∣ving
before the supreme judges, may be raised
at any time after the warning, to be execute
on twenty-one days; providing the day of com∣pearance
be six days after the term.” Lord
Stair saw the necessity of some such measure.
“Legal execution,” says his Lordship, “is not
competent ordinarily till delay, because none
should be pursued till he have failed; yet in
some cases the debtor may be pursued before
the term, to pay at the term, as <HI>si vergat ad
inopiam.</HI> Yea, in removing, it seems very
expedient to pursue the party warned, even
before the term, to remove at the term; o∣therwise
the lands cannot be safely s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, the
tenant not knowing if others will remove wil∣lingly:
and there ought to be no uncertain∣ty
in that point, which is a public interest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 1. tit. 17. sect. 15.</NOTE>”
Reformers in religion differ widely from those in
law. The former, enthusiastically zealous, over∣turn
every established form, and stop not till not
a vestige be left of the national creed, or the na∣tional
<PB N="283" REF="296"/>
ceremonies. The latter, cool and cautious,
proceed with circumspection: being afraid of con∣sequences,
they seldom reach perfection; nor do
they always venture so far as even their judge∣ment
would lead them. In the present case, the
commissioners, sensible of the imperfection of
common law, ventured to allow a summons of
removing to be raised before the term of remo∣ving;
and yet they adhered so far to the old law,
as to appoint the day of compearance to be six
days after that term: which was but half a re∣medy,
or rather no remedy at all; for a process
commenced before the term of removing may be
protracted for months; and what is the new te∣nant
to do in the mean time? Lord Stair, sen∣sible
of the insufficiency of this improvement,
gives his opinion, that the process of removing
may be carried on and concluded before the
term, decreeing the tenant to remove at the
term, ready for execution if the tenant should
prove refractory. And such processes are now
frequent and familiar.</P>
<P>Beside requiring a process of removing in or∣der
to prevent private violence, which was the
chief purpose of the statute; another alteration
was introduced, which is, to require the warn∣ing,
and service thereof, to be in writing. In all
other respects, the usual from was preserved.
Whitsunday was the usual term of removing;
and warning accordingly is appointed to be
<PB N="284" REF="297"/>
forty days before that term. With respect to
any other term of removing, the act is silent: it
is not provided for in the act, but left to com∣mon
law. There is nothing said in the act, nor
insinuated, that the warning must be forty days
before Whitsunday, whatever be the term of re∣moving.
And if so, may it not fairly be inferred
from the act itself, that if forty days be sufficient
where Whitsunday is the term of removing, the
same number is sufficient whatever be the term?
There can be no reason assigned, for privileging
a tenant who removes at Martinmas, with a
more early warning, than when the removing is
at Whitsunday. But we are not left entirely to
an argument from analogy. Balfour, in his
chapter intitled, <HI>Anent removing,</HI> reports a case,
Lord Borthwick <HI>contra</HI> Sym, 19th May 1565,
in the following words. “In actions of remo∣ving
of tenants, the warning is not sufficient
except there be forty days free between the
warning and the term of Whitsunday or Mar∣tinmas,
excluding not only the day of warn∣ing,
but also the day of Whitsunday or Mar∣tinmas.”
In this case, but ten years after the
statute, we have the greatest lawyer of his time
laying it down as a rule, That the warning must
be forty days before the term of removing, whe∣ther
Whitsunday or Martinmas; and he is far
from understanding the act as appointing the
warning to precede Whitsunday whatever be
<PB N="285" REF="298"/>
the term of removing. That learned author
could not mistake the meaning of a statute, which
probably was framed by himself, undoubtedly
with his concurrence.</P>
<P>Sir George Mackenzie, however, in his obser∣vations
on this statute, lays it down, “That
warning must be made before Whitsunday,
though the person warned be not obliged to
remove by his tack till the Martinmas.” And
this erroneous opinion has been blindly follow∣ed,
not only by later writers, but even by the
court of session, which is much more to be re∣greted.</P>
<P>I term this an erroneous opinion, because it
is clear beyond a cavil, that the time of warn∣ing
is not regulated by the statute, except where
the removing is at Whitsunday. And Sir George
had no authority, either from the statute or from
analogy, to say, that warning must be made be∣fore
Whitsunday, even where Martinmas is the
term of removing. The statute begins with re∣quiring
warning to be made forty days before
the feast of Whitsunday. The precept of warn∣ing
must be read at the parish-church, and a
copy must be affixed on the most patent door,
forty days before the term, i. e. the term of
Whitsunday, the only term mentioned in the
act. Then comes the following clause: “And
if the party warned in manner foresaid remove
not at the term, (i. e the said term), in that
<PB N="286" REF="299"/>
case the warner shall apply to the judge,”
&amp;c. Every article here points at Whitsunday as
the term of removing. But what makes it cer∣tain,
that Whitsunday was here understood to be
the term of removing, is the clause appoiting
judges to hold courts for processes of removing
immediately after Trinity Sunday, being the first
Sunday after Whitsunday. At the time of the
statute, as mentioned above, a process of remo∣ving
was not competent before the term of re∣moving.
And to appoint courts for process of
removing to be held immediately after Whitsun∣day,
necessarily implies, that Whitsunday was the
term of removing.</P>
<P>Our present practice, in several cases that may
be figured, will be found inconsistent with an
express clause in the statute, “requiring that the
warning be given within a year of the term
of removing.” Such a case was lately brought
before the court. The term of entry and of re∣moving
was Beltan, which is the first day of May.
Here is an evident dilemma. Warning, it is
said, must here be given before the preceding
Whitsunday; and yet, if so given, it is null by
the clause now mentioned, being more than a
year before the term of removing. A warning
farther back than a year, may render the tenant
negligent about another farm, hoping a change
of mind in his landlord. Thus, according to the
meaning of the act adopted in practice, one part
<PB N="287" REF="300"/>
of it is made to contradict another. Does not
this shew, that the adopted meaning is erro∣neous?
If the warning must always be given
within a year of the term of removing, does it
not necessarily follow, that warning must not al∣ways
precede Whitsunday? And if it must vary
in some cases, what reason can be given why it
ought not always to be forty days before the
term of removing?</P>
<P>The opinion of Sir George Mackenzie, upon
which our present practice is founded, deserves
little regard, considering, that he quotes for his
authority three decisions of the court of session,
two of them not to the purpose, and the third a
very lame authority. The first is in Durie<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">8th July 1626, Foulis.</NOTE>.
A tack being to expire in September, the land∣lord
executed a warning before Whitsunday;
and subsequent to that term, raised a process of
removing, concluding, that the tenant should re∣move
at the expiry of his tack in the September
following. The defence was, That neither the
warning, nor action of removing, could be sus∣tained
while the tack was current. The court
sustained the warning; but found, that the ac∣tion
of removing could not proceed before ex∣piration
of the tack. Here we find the old law
in vigour, That a process of removing cannot
proceed till the term of removing be past: which
<PB N="288" REF="301"/>
is all that is material in the judgement; for as
to the warniug, it was childish to make the ob∣jection,
when the very purpose of a warning is
to notify to the tenant, that he must remove at
the term. But what I am only concerned to ob∣serve
here is, that the court did not find, that
the warning must be before Whitsunday, where
removing is in September or at Martinmas: they
did not even insinuate, that such was their opi∣nion.
The second decision, reported also by
Durie<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">16th December 1628, English <HI>contra</HI> Tenants.</NOTE>, is not more to the purpose than the
first. Nothing is determined, but that a warn∣ing
before the term of removing is proper; which
no mortal ever doubted of. The third decision,
quoted by Sir George, is also from Durie<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">15th June 1631, Ramsay <HI>contra</HI> Weir.</NOTE>.
The subject was a kail-yard, the entry to which
is commonly at Candlemas, the time for digging
and manuring. The possessor being warned for∣ty
days before Candlemas to remove at that term,
it was objected, That the act 1555 requires the
warning to precede Whitsunday. The court re∣fused
to sustain the warning, “seeing it was not
made before the ordinary term of Whitsunday,
to remove at Whitsunday, as use is in other
warnings and removings.” There is here un∣doubtedly
an error, either in the report, or in
<PB N="289" REF="302"/>
the printing; for the court was incapable to give
an opinion that did not touch the point in dis∣pute.
But supposing that opinion to have been
given, the meaning of the court must have been,
that Whitsunday removings only are regulated by
the act 1555, and that removings at other terms
are to be regulated by practice. Beside that a
kail-yard seems not to be comprehended under
the act. It is this very opinion however that
moved Lord Stair to lay down, that all warnings
must precede Whitsunday. His words are,
“This order must be used, though the term
of the tack be not at Whitsunday, but at Mar∣tinmas
or Candlemas; and it will not suffice
to be made forty days before these terms;
15th June 1631, Ramsay <HI>contra</HI> Weir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. tit. 9. sect. 40.</NOTE>.”
He adds the following very insufficient reason.
“The warning before Whitsunday is appointed,
that tenants may timeously provide for them∣selves;
which cannot be but before Whitsun∣day,
the ordinary time lands use to be set.”
<HI>Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus.</HI> A warn∣ing
before Whitsunday avails nothing to a tenant
who cannot remove till Martinmas, whatever
number of farms be open at Whitsunday. Mar∣tinmas,
at the same time, is a term of removing
frequent in Scotland; and when a tenant re∣moves
at that term, he may have a farm as rea∣dily
<PB N="290" REF="303"/>
as when he removes at Whitsunday. It is
unlucky that this obvious reflection did not oc∣cur
to his Lordship; for his authority, influen∣cing
the court, has embarrassed removings, and
established a practice inconvenient both to land∣lord
and tenant. The landlord must warn be∣tween
seven or eight months before Martinmas,
where that is the term of removing. Many
things may occur to make him change his mind;
and forty days before Martinmas, he notifies to the
tenant, that he may continue where he is. But,
unluckily for both, the tenant has engaged him∣self
to another landlord. The inconvenience to
the tenant is still greater. A warning very long
before the term is no indication of what the
landlord's mind will be when the term of remo∣ving
approaches; and hoping a change of mind,
he forbears to seek for another farm. Much ex∣perience
has taught us, that forty days is a pro∣per

for another possession; and there is no pro∣spect,
that in so short a space the landlord will
change his mind. A warning ten or eleven
months before the term, instead of directing the
tenant's conduct, puzzles him with uncertainty.
Fond of his possession, he would gladly hope fa∣vour
from his landlord: he is irresolute; and
finds too late, that he must remove without ha∣ving
secured another farm.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Analysis of act 16. parl. 1617, appointing
registration of seisins, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE act has the following preamble: “Con∣sidering
the fraudulent dealing of par∣ties,
who, by their unjust concealing of some
private right made by them, render the sub∣sequent
alienation done for great sums of mo∣ney
altogether unprofitable.” To remedy
such fraud, a public register is appointed, in
which all reversions, &amp;c. and all instruments of
seisin shall be recorded within threescore days of
the date; under certification, that the said writs,
not being recorded within the said space, “shall
make no faith in judgement, by way of action
or exception, in prejudice of a third party who
hath acquired a perfect and complete right to
the land.” But it is declared, “That the
said writs shall be effectual against the granter,
his heirs and successors.”</P>
<P>To analyse this act, we begin with examining
what are the deeds that are secured by it; and next,
against what hazards such deeds are protected.
With regard to the former, the legislature evidently
had nothing in view, but to secure <HI>bona fide</HI> pur∣chasers
for a valuable consideration. The statute
<PB N="292" REF="305"/>
is in favour of purchasers, not creditors: an ap∣prising,
an adjudication, an infeftment of annual∣rent,
are all of them left to common law. With
respect to the other head, the security granted is
against latent voluntary rights only. So says the
statute; and all the deeds specified required to
be recorded, are voluntary deeds, reversions,
regresses, bonds of reversion, assignations there∣to,
discharges of the same, renunciations of wad∣sets,
&amp;c. These deeds admit not possession or
infeftment, and are by their nature real, and
consequently effectual against singular successors.
It was therefore a most salutary regulation, to
appoint these to be recorded. The act stops
there; and makes no provision against any la∣tent
right but what is voluntary; and against
such latent right, if such can be figured, a pur∣chaser
is not secure, if the right be in its nature
real.</P>
<P>The statute has afforded an additional security
to purchasers, by appointing all instruments of
seisin to be recorded. It might seem at first view,
that the regulation should only comprehend seisins
that proceed upon voluntary deeds; as such deeds
are the only deeds that are appointed to be re∣corded.
But the enactment is general; and
justly so: with respect to a seisin on an adjudica∣tion,
to mention no other, there is the utmost ex∣pediency
that it should be recorded; for otherwise
no purchaser would be secure.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="306"/>
It is a matter of greater doubt, what the legisla∣ture
intended with respect to a seisin on a retour,
or on a precept of <HI>Clare constat.</HI> The certifica∣tion
in the act is not applicable to that case: it
would be nonsense to say, that the seisin of an
heir, unless recorded within threescore days,
shall make no faith in judgement against a third
party who hath acquired a complete right to the
land. An heir, whether his title be recorded or
not, cannot enter the lists against any person de∣riving
right from the ancestor. Neither do the
other clauses reach this case. The words of the
preamble, “the unjust concealing of some pri∣vate
right made by them,” do not compre∣hend
the heir; and as little the concluding words,
“that the said writs shall be effectual against the
granter, his heirs and successors.”</P>
<P>On the other hand, the words are precise and
peremptory, That all instruments of seisin shall be
recorded. And if, for securing purchasers, it
appear, that no seisin requires more to be record∣ed
than that of an heir, there can remain no
doubt of the will of the legislature as expressed in
the words. This will appear from a common
and familiar example. An heir serves to his pre∣decessor,
is infeft, but thinks not of putting his
seisin upon record. After his death, the next
heir, perhaps a distant collateral, believing the
former heir to have died in apparency, serves to
the remoter predecessor as the last infeft; and af∣ter
<PB N="292" REF="307"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="293" REF="308"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="294" REF="309"/>
possessing some years, sells the land for a full
price. After his death, a third heir, discovering
that the first heir, who was supposed to have died
in apparency, had been infeft, makes up his title
as heir to him; and within the years of prescrip∣tion
brings a process against the purchaser, con∣cluding,
that his author's service to a wrong pre∣decessor
was erroneous; and therefore that he
the purchaser has no right to the land. Suppo∣sing
the infeftment of an heir to be good in law
without recording, the pursuer must prevail;
which would render every purchase from an heir
not a little perilous. But what puts this matter
beyond doubt, is cotemporary evidence of the
meaning of the legislature. The register appoint∣ed
by the act begins 19th August 1617; and the
very next day a seisin is recorded, proceeding on
a precept of <HI>Clare constat</HI> by Ludovick Duke of
Lennox to John Lord Lindsay; and other seisins
of the same kind are from time to time recorded
in great plenty. Had the court of session ordered
a search in the record, they would not have found,
as they once did, that the seisin of an heir without
being recorded, is good against a singular succes∣sor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, 17th December 1703, Keith <HI>contra</HI> Sinclair.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The act 1695, concerning the three years pos∣session
of an heir-apparent, gives indeed some re∣lief
to a purchaser for a valuable consideration.
<PB N="295" REF="310"/>
But beside the hazard of the heir's death who
sells within the three years, many deeds highly
favoured in law are left unsupported by that act;
a bond of provision, for example, a settlement of
an estate, and other deeds highly rational.</P>
<P>But now admitting, that the seisin of an heir
ought to be recorded, what certification is provi∣ded
against an heir who neglects to record his sei∣sin?
and what is to be the consequence? It is
but too evident, that the certification in the fta∣tute
is not applicable to an heir; and that with
impunity he may transgress the statute, if no o∣ther
compulsion be provided. To say what shall
be the effect of a statutory injunction, ordering or
prohibiting a thing to be done, without adding
any penalty, would require much discussion.
What at present is only incumbent upon me, is to
examine what is to be the consequence of an
heir's neglect in this case, where no certification
is added. The recording is made necessary by the
act; and the recording must be held an essential
solemnity, like designing the writer and witnesses
in a bond, made necessary by act 1681. The
neglect is a nullity; and the seisin, by that ne∣glect,
is no better than if the solemnity of deli∣vering
earth and stone were omitted. A purcha∣ser
ought to see the seisin on record, without
which he can have no reliance on it.</P>
<P>In the foregoing analysis, I have adhered strict∣ly
to the words of the act. I now proceed to
<PB N="296" REF="311"/>
view the act in the light of equity and expediency,
in order to fulfil the purpose of the legislature,
without regarding the defect of words. It was
undoubtedly the purpose of the legislature, to sa∣cilitate
the commerce of land, by securing <HI>bona
fide</HI> purchasers, for a valuable consideration, a∣gainst
such latent rights as are real, and conse∣quently
are effectual against purchasers; and the
means employed, are the requiring such rights
to be recorded, in order to put purchasers on their
guard. The only rights mentioned are reversions,
and other voluntary rights; because probably such
only occurred to the legislature. But as no cause
can be assigned, why a purchaser should not be
secure against other latent rights as well as against
what are voluntary, it deserves consideration,
whether it be not the duty of the court of session,
to complete the purpose of the legislature, by se∣curing
purchasers against every latent right, vo∣luntary
or not. A reversion is, by act 27. parl.
1469, made effectual against singular successors.
And if a reversion must be recorded under certifi∣cation
of losing its privilege, no other right what∣ever
ought to be exempted.</P>
<P>That the court of session will proceed to com∣plete
the security intended for purchasers, may
be hoped, but cannot with certainty be foretold.
But which-ever of the systems be adopted, that
of strict law, or that of expediency, the common
law continues in force as to every particular, pur∣chasers
<PB N="297" REF="312"/>
only excepted. A seisin, for example,
upon a precept of <HI>Clare constat,</HI> requires not
recording as a solemnity, except as to purchasers:
in all questions among heirs or gratuitous dispo∣nees,
it continues to be a title of property, though
it be not recorded; precisely as a reversion not re∣corded
continues to be effectual against heirs and
gratuitous disponees. All that the statute requires,
is only that it must be recorded, to secure it a∣gainst
a purchaser for a valuable consideration.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Analysis of act 32. parl. 1661, concerning
heritable and moveable bonds.</HEAD>
<P>A Bond containing a clause for payment of in∣terest,
was of old held to be an heritable
subject. The heir of the creditor made up his
title to it by a general service; and the heir of
the debtor, not the executor, was ultimately
liable. Such bonds were rendered moveable by
act 57. parl. 1641; and that act having been re∣scinded
by a general clause along with the o∣ther
acts of that period, such bonds were again
rendered moveable by the act under considera∣tion.</P>
<P>The meaning of the act is in practice held to be,
That a bond bearing interest is rendered move∣able
in every respect, so as to belong to the next
in kin of the creditor, and to burden ultimately
the next in kin of the debtor. This is laid down
by Lord Stair in the following words. “There
is another considerable difference betwixt the
condition of the wife and children, introduced
by the act of parliament 1641, revived parl.
1661, cap. 32. whereby bonds and provisions
bearing clauses of annualrent, which before
<PB N="299" REF="314"/>
were heritable, are now moveable as to the
bairns, nearest of kin, executors, and lega∣tars;
and are at the defunct's disposal by testa∣ment,
or any deed on deathbed. And they
are exhaustible by debts of the same nature,
which debts do not exhaust the relict's part<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. <HI>Executry,</HI> sect. 47.</NOTE>.”
And the rule here laid down is constantly follow∣ed
in practice.</P>
<P>I find not that this construction of the act has
any support, either from its words or its intend∣ment.
There is not the least appearance of any
intention but to revive the act 1641. It was in∣deed
not revived in express terms, because it
was thought improper to honour so far any sta∣tute
of that period: but it was revived in effect;
not only by renewing what was there enacted,
but by a retrospect in order to validate every
thing that had been done under its authority.
And so fully was its preamble in view, that it
was not thought necessary to give any pre∣amble
to the reviving act. Therefore the best
comment on the statute under consideration,
will be the rescinded statute, which gave
birth to it. That statute expresses clearly the
purpose of the legislature. It begins with ob∣serving,
that younger children are but scan∣tily
<PB N="300" REF="315"/>
provided by law; that creditors, in stipula∣ting
interest for their money, have no intention
to disappoint their younger children; that the
heir profits by their ignorance; “and that a
number of orphans, and fatherless children,
disappointed of their natural portion, are
brought to poverty and misery, and forced to
become beggars; which is often found by pi∣tiful
experience.” Here the words are ex∣press,
that the statute was made to increase the
fund for younger children. And the enacting
clause corresponds accurately to the intention of
the legislature, statuting and ordaining, “That
all contracts or bonds for sums of money, with
condition of payment of annualrent or profit,
shall pertain to the bairns and nearest of kin
of the defunct; and that the said sums shall
be confirmed by the executor, without pay∣ment
of any quot for the same.” The words
of the reviving act, though not altogether so ex∣plicit,
are to the same purpose: “That all con∣tracts
and obligations for sums of money, con∣taining
clauses for payment of annualrent or
profit, made since the 16th November 1641,
or to be made in time coming, shall be holden
to be moveable, to be confirmed by the exe∣tor,
and to appertain to the neare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of kin and
legatars, according to the law and practique of
moveables.” Let it be remarked, that these
<PB N="301" REF="316"/>
words are applicable to the next in kin of the
creditor only.</P>
<P>So far the matter is clear; and if a bond bear∣ing
interest be rendered moveable <HI>quoad debito∣rem,</HI>
it is surely not by appointment of the sta∣tute,
but by some inference from it; and we
shall see anon whether there be any ground for
drawing such an inference.</P>
<P>What then has led Lord Stair, and all our
lawyers after him, to think, that the act under
consideration has rendered bonds bearing interest
moveable both as to creditor and debtor? This
opinion has nothing to rest on, but a principle of
common law unwarily applied to this case, That
as far as an heir represents <HI>activè,</HI> as far he must
also represent <HI>passivè;</HI> and that to whatever
species of debts he succeeds by a general service,
he must be liable to debts of the same kind.
Were I reduced to the necessity of pleading nice
or doubtful points, I might with a good grace
deny, that a principle regarding the representa∣tion
of an heir, is applicable to an executor,
who is a trustee or factor, and in no sense a re∣presentative.
But the point here is neither nice
nor doubtful. It certainly will not be contend∣ed,
that the foregoing principle must be applied
to an executor or next in kin, in spite of the sta∣tute.
And the first reflection will make it clear,
that to subject the next in kin of the debtor in
this case, goes not only beyond the words of
<PB N="302" REF="317"/>
the statute, but is fundamentally subversive of
its purpose and intendment. The declared pur∣pose
of the statute, is to benefit younger chil∣dren,
by augmenting the fund of their legal pro∣vision;
which is done by adding to that fund
bonds bearing interest, formerly heritable. But
it would be a matter of chance, whether young∣er
children would be benefited, were they at the
same time made liable to pay such bonds. A man
may leave bonds bearing interest, and be due
double the sum by bonds of the same kind.
The statute in that case, according to the construc∣tion
given it, would have the effect to lessen
the fund appointed by law for younger chil∣dren.
But we need not go to particular cases:
in every bond there is a debtor, as well as a cre∣ditor;
and if bonds bearing interest be render∣ed
simply moveable, it follows necessarily, that
as far as the children or next in kin of the cre∣ditor
are profited, so far precisely are the chil∣dren
or next in kin of the debtor burdened.
Instead of providing for younger children, this
construction enriches some, and reduces others
to poverty, without predilection, or cause of pre∣ference.
What is this better, than giving with
one hand, and taking back with the other?
Where then is the remeid for the “hard condi∣tion
of a great number of orphans and father∣less
children, who being disappointed of their
natural portion, are brought to great misery,”
<PB N="303" REF="318"/>
&amp;c.? The plain purpose of the statute, which is
to enlarge the legal provision of younger children,
can only be fulfilled, by enlarging the provision
of the creditor's children; leaving the debtor's
children to common law as formerly. And
therefore, upon the whole, it may with certainty
be concluded, that bonds bearing interest are
moveable <HI>quoad creditorem,</HI> but heritable <HI>quoad
debitorem.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ART. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Analysis of act of sederunt 28th Februa∣ry
1662, concerning executors-credi∣tors.</HEAD>
<P>THE heir who represents his predecessor,
and is held to be <HI>eadem persona</HI> with him,
succeeds to every heritable subject. But with re∣spect
to moveable subjects, there is no heir:
these are managed by an executor appointed by
the proprietor himself; and failing his nomina∣tion,
they are managed by an executor whom
the commissary-court appoints. It is the office
of the executor to convert the effects into mo∣ney,
and to distribute the money among the per∣sons
interested, the creditors, relict, next in kin,
legatees, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As personal debts are not ordained to be re∣corded,
it is implied in the very nature of an ex∣ecutor's
office, that distribution be delayed till
the persons interested have time to put in their
claims; for it would be gross injustice, that an ho∣nest
creditor should be cut out because he can∣not
run so fast as another. By our law the heir
was not subjected to personal debts till the
moveables were exhausted; and by act 76.
parl. 1503, the heir's defence, That the moveables
<PB N="305" REF="320"/>
must first be discussed, is restricted to a year after
the predecessor's death. A year was thought
sufficient for the executor, to convert the effects
into money, and to distribute the same among
the creditors; after which they had access to the
heir. Whence it became the executor's duty,
to appoint a time within the year for the credi∣tors
to receive payment, and to distribute among
them the funds collected. This salutary form of
management came to be neglected, through the
ignorance of executors, or their partiality; and
for many years payment made to the first comer
has been sustained.</P>
<P>This irregular practice, productive of much
injustice, was taken under consideration by the
commissioners for administration of justice in
Scotland appointed by Oliver Cromwell. In their
regulations 1654, article 16. it is enacted, “That
hereafter there be no executors-creditors de∣cerned
and confirmed to any defunct, until
half a year be past after the defunct's de∣cease.”
“And in the 18th article it is enacted,
That no decreet for payment be extracted a∣gainst
any executor, for six months after the
defunct's decease; and that all creditors who
shall use diligence against the executor within
the said six months, shall come in <HI>pari passu</HI>
with others that have decreets ready to ex∣tract.”
The first of these articles seems in∣tended
to give time to the commissaries to chuse
<PB N="306" REF="321"/>
a proper person for managing the effects, termed
<HI>executor-dative,</HI> preferring always the next in
kin, if they apply. The other is intended for a
still more salutary purpose; which is, to prevent
personal creditors from taking the start of one
another, by what is termed <HI>nimious diligence;</HI>
instead of having the moveable effects of their
deceased debtor divided equally among them.
As these regulations fell to the ground on the
Restoration the court of session interposed by
the act of sederunt under consideration. I see
not clearly why the article first mentioned was
rejected: perhaps it was thought, that there was
no harm in allowing creditors to confirm within
the six months, when it gave them no preference.
But the other article was completely adopted;
the act of sederunt in effect declaring, “That no
diligence done within six months of the pro∣prietor's
death shall give a preference; but
that all creditors doing diligence within that
time shall come in <HI>pari passu.</HI>” If no dili∣gence
done within the six months give a preference,
it follows necessarily, that the executor is with∣held
from making payment within the six months.
It was probably thought, that a year was too
long a delay; especially as creditors who appear
after the six months, and after the moveables are
discussed, have access to the heir.</P>
<P>It seems to be an inference from the act of se∣derunt,
that a personal creditor who obtains not
<PB N="307" REF="322"/>
payment from the executor, may, after the six
months, betake himself to the heir; and as the
statute 1503 was now in disuse, it is probable that
creditors were early indulged with this privilege.
Personal creditors, grudging even this short delay
of six months, have acquired, by a further in∣dulgence
of the court, a still greater privilege;
which is, to attack the heir without any delay.
And yet, as the heir with respect to moveable
debts is cautioner only, there is neither law nor
equity for making him liable, till the executor be
discussed. So cautious was the statute 1503 in
this particular, that the heir was not bound to
pay even after the year, till the executor found
caution to relieve him to the extent of the move∣able
effects. In our present practice, he is made
liable even before the executor himself is liable;
for however extensive the moveables may be, an
executor is not bound to pay any debt within
six months of the debtor's death. Whether this
practice can be justified upon any rational prin∣ciple,
is left to be examined by our ablest
lawyers.</P>
<P>The act of parliament 1661, to prevent ni∣mious
diligence, ranks <HI>pari passu</HI> upon the he∣ritable
estate, all creditors who adjudge within
year and day of the first effectual adjudication:
and the act of sederunt under consideration, to
prevent nimious diligence upon the personal e∣state,
ranks <HI>pari passu</HI> all creditors who do dili∣gence
<PB N="308" REF="323"/>
within six months after the death of the
debtor. Other competitions among personal cre∣ditors
are left to common law; and to these we
proceed. The case of an executor-nominate,
of an executor-dative, and of an executor next
in kin, shall take the lead. The office of the
two first named is purely ministerial: with respect
to creditors, the office of the last is the same:
they retain indeed the free residue; but that cir∣cumstance
has no influence in a competition a∣mong
creditors. It is the duty of these execu∣tors
to convert the effects into money, and to dis∣tribute
the money among the creditors and o∣thers
interested. If a process be commenced a∣gainst
any of them before the effects are convert∣ed
into money, no decree can pass against him
for payment: the decree can only be declarato∣ry,
“that he shall be bound to pay to the pursuer
a proportion of the money arising from a sale
of the effects;” which means no more but to
secure to the creditor his share in the distribution.
Though a process be commenced against him,
after the effects are converted into money, but
before distribution, he is not however bound to
pay within the six months. But when these are
elapsed, and no interpellation by any other cre∣ditor,
he is bound to make payment; and a de∣cree
against him for payment will afford a prefer∣ence
to the pursuer against all other creditors ap∣pearing
afterward; for it would be unjust, that
<PB N="309" REF="324"/>
the creditor should suffer by the executor's fault,
who ought to have made payment instead of al∣lowing
a decree to go against him. If there be
an interpellation by other creditors, before the
pursuer has obtained his decree for payment,
it is the duty of the executor to call all of them
in a multiple-poinding; and in that process the
creditors will be ranked <HI>pari passu,</HI> if no ob∣jection
lie against any particular debt.</P>
<P>Next of the case where a creditor is confirmed.
His confirmation, which is a species of legal di∣ligence,
intitles him, at common law, to retain
such a proportion of the subjects confirmed as
will satisfy his claim; and to that extent he must
be preferred. The surplus, if any be, is divided
among the other creditors, according to the rule
above laid down: if there be but one creditor to
claim the surplus, he must have it; if a plurality,
it must be divided among them in a multiple∣poinding.</P>
<P>Hitherto the rules of competition are simple.
Cases may be figured more complex, where the
competition is regulated, partly by common law,
and partly by the act of sederunt; as where some
creditors have cited the executor within the six
months, and some after. The former are rank∣ed
<HI>pari passu</HI> by the act of sederunt. But the
act does not prefer them before creditors whose
citations are after the six months. The competi∣tion
in that case is lest to common law; and
<PB N="310" REF="325"/>
at common law all creditors are ranked <HI>pari
passu</HI> who have not obtained a decree for pay∣ment
against the executor. This may occasion
an intricate competition. Suppose the follow∣ing.
A creditor confirms within the six months;
and processes are raised against him by two o∣ther
creditors, John within the six months, James
after. Let the fund be 12, and each of the
debts 8. I begin with computing what each cre∣ditor
ought to receive at common law, laying a∣side
the act of sederunt; and then proceed to
examine what alteration is made by the act. At
common law, the creditor confirmed would draw
his whole sum, leaving 4, the remainder of the
fund, to John and James. By this computation,
James is intitled to 2, which is all that he can
ultimately draw, being neither hurt nor benefited
by the act. We shall next examine what John
is intitled to draw by virtue of the act. The de∣claration,
that he shall come in <HI>pari passu</HI> with
the creditor confirmed, means not, that he shall
draw equally with the creditor confirmed, but
only that the confirmation shall give no prefer∣ence.
Now, laying aside the confirmation, John
can draw but 4, being the third part of the
fund; for it is not the intention of the act of
sederunt, that any creditor should draw more than
a just proportion. The result of the whole is,
that the executor confirmed draws 6, John 4,
James 2. This is a specimen of many intri∣cate
<PB N="311" REF="326"/>
competitions that may occur upon the act
of sederunt. And upon trial, it will be found no
less fruitful of such competitions among personal
creditors, than the statute 1661 is among real
creditors.</P>

executed in the form of a lease granted by
the presentee to the patron. The patron's right
to the surplus teind, is countenanced by several
acts of parliament; particularly by act 1. parl.
1612, declaring it lawful for the patron to make
an agreement with the presentee, provided a com∣petent
maintenance be reserved to him. And in
the act 1649, abolishing the patron's power of
presentation, his right to the teinds is there de∣clared
to be good and valid. Again, upon the
restitution of Episcopacy ann. 1662, when the
act 1649 was rescinded, the patron's right to en∣joy
the surplus teinds is admitted. See particu∣larly
act 9. parl. 1661, at the end. Lastly, when
by the act under consideration the power of pre∣sentation
was taken from the patron, and be∣stowed
on the heritors, it is declared, that the
<PB N="313" REF="328"/>
teinds shall belong to the patron, with the burden
of the minister's stipend. And now, by this sta∣tute,
the patron has a direct right to the teinds,
instead of the indirect right he formerly had by
a tack of the teinds procured from the presentee.</P>
<P>This short sketch paves the way for examining
what teinds were given to the patron by the act
under consideration, in lieu of his power of pre∣sentation.
The question occurred in a memora∣ble
case determined in the court of session, the
particulars of which follow. James VI. by char∣ter
dated 7th March 1593, granted the abbey of
Dunfermline, including the teinds, to his consort
Queen Anne, and to the heirs procreated betwixt
them; whom failing, to his heirs and successors
in the crown of Scotland. By virtue of that grant,
ratified in parliament ann. 1612, the teinds of the
abbey of Dunfermline are now in the crown.</P>
<P>The teinds of the parish of Kirkmichael, part
of the said abbey, were claimed by the patron
upon the said act 1690, as free teinds in the
crown. It was answered, That the teinds of the
abbey having been heritably disponed as above
mentioned, belong not to the patron; because,
by the act 1690, no teinds are bestowed on the
patron, but free teinds not heritably disponed.
Several other objections being made to the pa∣tron's
claim, a judgement was given on the
whole, rejecting the claim; and there was no
judgement given on the present point in particu∣lar.
<PB N="314" REF="329"/>
But it occurred at advising, that the le∣gislature,
in making the act 1690, intended no
more but to preserve entire to the patron such
right to the teinds, as he enjoyed before by means
of a tack procured from the presentee, having
now no opportunity to procure such a tack. But
as the ministers of the parishes belonging to the
abbey of Dunfermline are not titulars of the
teinds of these parishes, they could not grant a
tack of them to the patron. This was illustrated
from the case of teinds that belonged to bishops
during Episcopacy. These teinds are now in the
crown, and may in one view be considered as
free teinds. Yet no patron ever pretended right
to these; and the patron is no better founded in
his claim to the teinds under consideration.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Commentary on act 35. parl. 1693, con∣cerning
procuratories of resignation and
precepts of seisin.</HEAD>
<P>MAN, a voluntary agent, governs himself
and his concerns by his own will; and,
in order to fulfil it, he exerts external acts. I
deliver an ox that I sold, or a purse of money
that I promised: no person ever doubted, but
that the property is transferred by delivery pur∣suant
to my will. But it requires a habit of abs∣traction,
to separate a man's will from himself,
so as to conceive it operating after his death.
Such abstraction is above the power of a sa∣vage;
and probably was not thought of before
writing was introduced in legal acts. A writ ex∣pressing
a man's will, is visible and tangible:
the will adhering to the paper, is preserved in ex∣istence
even after the man's death. Hence the
efficacy of a latter-will or testament in writ, to
give right to a legatee, and to direct things to
be done after death; the nomination, for ex∣ample,
of tutors and curators, of trustees to sell
land for payment of debt, and such like<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Principles of Equity, edit. 2. p. 239.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="331"/>
Seeing, by the law of nature, a man's will is
effectual after his death, I am at a loss to discover
upon what ground it is laid down in general,
<HI>Quod morte mandantis perit mandatum,</HI> unless
that it has been established before writing was
used in law-proceedings. That a mandate for be∣hoof
of the mandant should fall by the death of the
mandatary, is rational: I employ an architect to
build a house for me; and he dies before a stone
is laid: I am not bound to employ the heir, who
perhaps is a weaver; and if I be not bound to
employ him, he cannot be bound to serve me.
Another reason concurs, drawn from the nature
of representation: An heir represents not his pre∣decessor
with respect to things purely personal,
<HI>quae inhaerent ossibus,</HI> as expressed by a Roman
writer. Supposing the architect to die after per∣forming
part of his work, the heir is not bound
to complete it, nor am I bound to employ the
heir. But neither of these reasons conclude for
making a mandate depend on the life of the man∣dant.
His will, we have seen, operates after his
death in his testament, and in a settlement of his
estate. Why should it not equally operate in a
mandate given by him to do something for him
after his death?</P>
<P>At the same time, I am far from insisting, that
every mandate must subsist after the death of the
mandant. The proposition I maintain is only,
that there is nothing in the nature of a mandate
<PB N="317" REF="332"/>
or commission, to make it fall with the mandant;
but that its subsistence or not subsistence after his
death, depends on what is purposed to be done
by it. To explain this proposition, a mandate
created for behoof of the mandant himself, must
be distinguished from a mandate created for be∣hoof
of another person. A mandate in the for∣mer
case must fall with the mandant; because
the end for which it was created, cannot now be
fulfilled. Take, for example, a commission to
buy a horse for my riding: my death must put
an end to this commission, which cannot now be
fulfilled. But where the mandate is of such a
nature as not to depend on my life, why ought
it not to stand as well as a testament or latter-will?
The person who undertakes, at my re∣quest,
to erect a monument for me after my
death, is bound both in law and conscience.
The like where a person undertakes to lay out
my money at interest after my death, or to pur∣chase
land with it, or to give some part in cha∣rity.
By what authority does an executor nomi∣nate
exercise his office after the testator's death,
other than his mandate? Those who maintain
the general rule, must admit the cases mentioned
to be so many exceptions. But they do not
advert, that the reason upon which these excep∣tions
are founded, prove that the rule is not ge∣neral,
but that the purpose of the mandate is the
rule.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="333"/>
With respect to a mandate given for behoof of
the mandatary, or of a third person, it may be
laid down as a general rule, That the mandate
dies not with the mandant. I commission a friend
to buy a horse for himself, intending it as a pre∣sent.
The mandate will be effectual, even where
it is executed after my death; and my heir will
be liable for the price. I give a commission to
buy a horse for my son, or for my brother; but
die suddenly, without affording time for execu∣tion.
Does my death put an end to the commis∣sion,
without evidence or probablity of change of
mind? Adhering to the general rule above laid
down, a special assignment, containing a power
to take possession of the moveables specified there∣in,
will intitle the assignee, even after the ce∣dent's
death, to lay hold of these moveables at
short hand, if not obstructed by the possession of
another. Such power in a general assignment
cannot indeed be exercised after the cedent's
death: not that the power has fallen; but that
our law permits not intromission with the goods
of a person deceased, but by inventory, which
renders confirmation necessary.</P>
<P>There is one sort of mandate that necessarily
falls by the death of the mandant, whether given
for his own behoof, or for behoof of any other;
and that is a mandate to act for him, and in his
name. A procuratory of resignation and pre∣cept
of seisin are of that sort. The constituent's
<PB N="319" REF="334"/>
death puts an end to such mandates; because he
cannot be represented after his death, nor can a∣ny
one act in his name. A procurator, after the
proprietor's death, cannot in his name surrender
the land to the superior; and for the same reason,
the proprietor's death must put an end to a pre∣cept
of seisin. <HI>Procurator</HI> and <HI>bailie</HI> are rela∣lative
terms; and there cannot be a procurator
or bailie without a constituent, more than there
can be a shadow without a substance.</P>
<P>An obligation for a sum of money, without
mentioning assignees, is not assignable. To sup∣ply
that want, a method was invented to assign
it indirectly, by giving a procuratory to the assig∣nee
to use the cedent's name in demanding pay∣ment.
But this was an imperfect method: if
the cedent died before intimation, the procura∣tory
died with him; and the assignee's only re∣source
was a process against the cedent's repre∣sentatives,
to make up a title to the subject as∣signed,
and to grant a new assignment. Intima∣tion
during the cedent's life, was indeed held suf∣ficient
to transfer the <HI>jus crediti</HI> to the assignee,
intitling him to drop his character of procurator,
and to act in his own name. But for what rea∣son,
I have not yet discovered: the intimation
must be in the cedent's name, as the assignee
has nothing to say to the debtor, but <HI>qua pro∣curator;</HI>
and his process against the debtor for
<PB N="320" REF="335"/>
payment, ought to be carried on in the same
character. Does it not follow, that after the
cedent's death, his only resource, notwithstand∣ing
the intimation, is the process above mention∣ed?
But principles make little impression on
the illiterate; and are little regarded, provided
the end can be accomplished in whatever man∣ner.</P>
<P>Thus stood the law down to the year 1693,
when the act of parliament under consideration
was made, authorising procuratories of resigna∣tion,
and precepts of seisin, to be executed after
the granter's death; and also authorising special
assignments to be intimated after the cedent's
death. The privilege was not extended to gene∣ral
assignments; which, as observed above, re∣quire
confirmation. To make this statute accord
with principles, has not been attempted by any
writer: nor does it seem to be an easy task; for
surely the legislature could not mean to impower
one to act <HI>procuratorio nomine,</HI> without a consti∣tuent.
I understand the statute as impowering
these several acts to be done, not <HI>procuratorio
nomine,</HI> but by express authority of the statute.
By that authority, the land is surrendered into
the hands of the superior, infeftment is given on
the precept, and intimation is made of the assign∣ment.</P>
<P>There seems to have been no occasion for a
<PB N="321" REF="336"/>
statute with respect to the case last mentioned.
The simple addition of the word <HI>assignees</HI> in a
money-obligation, removes all difficulties. Were
our forefathers so defective in invention, as to
overlook an improvement so obvious? If I bind
myself to pay a sum to John, I am not bound
to pay it to James: but if I bind myself to pay
to John, or to his assignee, the bond has a free
circulation. The assignee can insist against me
in his own name, without needing a procura∣tory:
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can intimate in his own name, whe∣ther
the cedent be dead or alive; and his dis∣charge
to me in his own name extinguishes
the debt. All money-obligations are now made
payable to the creditor's heirs and assignees; and if
assignees happen to be omitted in a bond for bor∣rowed
money, the omission, which is understood
the effect of oversight, will be supplied in equity,
without needing the authority of an act of parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>Procuratories and precepts concerning land-rights,
may, I think, be so worded, as to be ef∣fectual
after the death of the granter. It is made
out above, that a power granted by me to take
possession of a moveable after my death, is effec∣tual
at common law: why not also, where the
power is to take possession of land? Having sold
land to be held of myself, I grant a precept to
my bailie, impowering him to deliver possession to
the purchaser, whether I be dead or alive. I see
<PB N="322" REF="337"/>
not, that an instrument of seisin taken on the de∣livery,
should be less effectual than an instrument
of seisin taken in common form. The statute
declares it equally effectual; and if the powers
of a bailie can be enlarged by statute for the
benefit of all concerned, why not, by private au∣thority?
Upon the same plan of reasoning, a
statute is as little necessary for surrendering land
into the hands of the superior after the dispo∣ner's
death. It appears to me, that this rea∣soning
must hold while the land remains <HI>in here∣ditate
jacente</HI> of the disponer. Widely differ∣ent
is the scene, after the heir is served and in∣feft.
By the rules that govern the transmission
of property, no procuratory nor precept can
avail, but what is given by the present pro∣prietor;
and for that reason, the moment an
heir is infeft, his predecessor's procuratory or
precept falls to the ground. And if it was in∣tended
by the legislature, that they should be
effectual in this case, it was undoubtedly right to
make a statute.</P>
<P>But that this was the intention of the statute,
is far from being clear. Like most of the sta∣tutes
of that period, it is extremely imperfect.
The enactment is, “That procuratories and
precepts shall subsist after the death of the
granters:” how long, and in what cases,
is not said. They must subsist while the subject
is <HI>in hereditate jacente</HI> of the disponer; for
<PB N="323" REF="338"/>
if the statute have not that effect, it has no ef∣fect.
But was it also intended, that they should
subsist after the subject is vested in the heir? If
we can draw any light, it must be from the pre∣amble:
there is not a word of it in the body of
the statute; though an effect so contradictory to
common law, ought not to have been left upon
conjecture. The preamble complains of “the
great and unnecessary expence occasioned by
obtaining procuratories and precepts to be
renewed.” This complaint refers to the heir
infeft, the only person who can renew them.
An heir infeft is bound indeed at common law
to renew a procuratory or precept granted by
his predecessor: but seldom is this obtained with∣out
a process; and the intention of the legisla∣ture
probably was to save the expence and delay
of that process. In short, it seems to be the pur∣pose
of the statute, to enable a disponee, at short
hand, to execute his procuratory or precept, in
every case where the representative is bound to
renew it.</P>
<P>It may then safely be concluded, that procu∣ratories
and precepts stand good even after the
heir is infeft. There the privilege stops; for
surely it was not intended, that a procuratory or
precept should stand good against a purchaser
infeft, even supposing him to be a gratuitous
purchaser. A man dispones his land twice; and
after the second purchaser is infeft, the disponer
<PB N="324" REF="339"/>
dies. The first purchaser can take no benefit
by executing his procuratory or precept; because
his taking infeftment will not deprive the second
purchaser of the property. And therefore, it
must not be presumed, that the privilege was
meant to be extended to this case. During the
disponer's life, the first purchaser can execute
his procuratory or precept, without needing an
act of parliament; but in vain would he take
infeftment, which would give him no hold of
the land in competition with the second pur∣chaser
first infeft. And after the disponer's
death, why should the first purchaser be autho∣rised
by a statute to do what would be idle to do?</P>
<P>The same reasoning is applicable to an herita∣ble
bond with procuratory and precept. After
granting such a bond, the debtor sells the land,
and the purchaser immediately takes infeftment.
From what is said above, it is evident, that the
statute gives no aid to the creditor. But did
not the court of session teach a very different
doctrine in a decision July 1758; where it was
found, that infeftment taken by the creditor
after his debtor's decease, and after the land
was vested in the crown by the debtor's forfei∣ture,
did however prefer him before all the per∣sonal
creditors of the forfeiting person? I an∣swer,
No. This decision differs not from the
doctrine above laid down; because, with re∣spect
to forfeiture for high treason, the crown
<PB N="325" REF="340"/>
is in effect an heir, liable to all the forfeiting
person's debts and deeds <HI>in valorem.</HI> And we
have seen above, that infeftment taken by a pur∣chaser
or creditor after the heir is infeft, stands
good by force of the statute.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Analysis of article 25. regulations 1695,
concerning decreets-arbitral.</HEAD>
<P>JUdges originally were no less limited in their
powers than arbiters are. Their authority
was derived from the consent of the litigants:
litiscontestation was in reality a contract; and
the decree of a judge had precisely the same ef∣fect
with an award pronounced by an arbiter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historical Law-tracts, tract 9.</NOTE>.
When judges, in the maturity of government,
were invested with authority to make their de∣crees
effectual, the consent of litigants ceased to
be necessary. But as impressions seldom wear
out with the causes that produced them, the ori∣ginal
resemblance between the decree of a judge
and that of an arbiter, was kept up in superficial
reasoning, and in law-language, even so far as
to infer, that a decreet-arbitral, like the decree
of a judge, may be reversed in a court of law.
This was an inference wonderfully gross: what can
be more obvious, than that to reduce a decreet-arbitral
for iniquity, is in effect to hold, that a
submission is not binding? To correct this er∣ror,
it is enacted in the 25th article of the regu∣lations
<PB N="327" REF="342"/>
1695, “That for the cutting off ground∣less
and expensive pleas and processes in time
coming, the Lords of Council and Session sus∣tain
no reduction of any decreet-arbitral that
shall be pronounced hereafter upon a subscri∣bed
submission, at the instance of any of the
parties submitters, upon any cause or reason
whatsoever, unless that of corruption, bribery,
or falsehood, to be alledged against the judges∣arbitrators
who pronounced the same.” By
this regulation, a decreet-arbitral obtains its pro∣per
effect; for when parties agree to be bound
by the opinion of an arbiter, his opinion, even
where erroneous, must be the rule. But then
it must be his opinion: if an arbiter, from what∣ever
motive, pronounce contrary to his opinion,
the parties are not bound; because the agree∣ment
is to submit to his opinion, not to what
he shall pronounce contrary to his opinion.</P>
<P>Upon this the question occurs, What rule
have we to judge whether a decreet-arbitral be
the opinion of the arbiter or not? The article
under consideration, answers that question. An
arbiter is presumed to pronounce his decree ac∣cording
to conscience, unless corruption, bribery,
or falsehood, be proved against him.</P>
<P>In supporting a decreet-arbitral against an ob∣jection
of error in judgement, it is taken for
granted, that the submission is complete in all its
formalities, and that the arbiter acts according
<PB N="328" REF="343"/>
to the powers given him by the submission.
There was no occasion for any regulation as to
points that belong to common law. If an arbi∣ter
act <HI>ultra vires,</HI> his decreet is void at com∣mon
law, at least as far as it is <HI>ultra vires.</HI> And
if the submission be reduced upon a legal objec∣tion,
the decreet-arbitral must fall with it: If a
man, for example, be fraudulently induced to
enter into a submission, the submission will be
voided in a reduction, and the parties be decla∣red
free. And if one be compelled by force or
fear to subscribe a submission, he is not bound
either by the submission or decreet-arbitral. In
this manner, a party may be loosed from the fet∣ters
of a decreet-arbitral, without any violence
done to the article under consideration.</P>
<P>I go one step further. By the regulations un∣der
consideration, “the Lords of Session shall
sustain no reduction of a decreet-arbitral upon
any cause or reason whatever, except corrup∣tion,”
&amp;c. But they are not prohibited to
sustain grounds of nullity that require not a pro∣cess
of reduction, especially if instantly verified.
Nor do I rest upon words. I found upon inten∣tion
chiefly; and urge, that it could not be the
intention of the legislature, to support a decreet∣arbitral
that is <HI>ipso jure</HI> null, and no better than
a piece of waste paper. I proceed to examples;
and the first is, that the decreet-arbitral is found∣ed
on an error in fact; as where John, debtor
<PB N="329" REF="344"/>
in L. 100 to William deceased, is ordained to
pay that sum to James, as the only child of Wil∣liam,
when in fact there are several other chil∣dren
of William. The decreet-arbitral is void,
because it determines a case that is not, and
leaves the real case undetermined. But here
the error must appear on the face of the writing:
considerations or reasonings passing in the mind
of a judge, or of an arbiter, are not the subject
of proof independent of the writing. An error
in fact that is not the foundation of the award,
will not be regarded. A piece of ground, com∣puted
to be ten acres, being controverted be∣tween
John and James; the arbiter determines
the ten acres to belong to the former. The
decreet-arbitral will be effectual though the
ground is found to be twenty acres; for if it be
possible that the arbiter might have given the
same award though he had known the real
fact, the presumption must lie for the decreet-arbitral.
See <HI>Instit. De legatis,</HI> § 31. Another
nullity is, that the premisses are inconsistent
with the conclusion: “Because John owes
L. 500 to James, I ordain James to pay that
sum to John.” Take a third example: It
is implied in every submission, that the arbi∣ter
shall pronounce an award upon every article
submitted, and leave no point open to future
controversy. It is accordingly a nullity in a de∣creet-arbitral
<PB N="330" REF="345"/>
that there is a point left open which
ought to have been determined. These particu∣lars
are sufficient for a specimen: nullities may
be figured without end.</P>

concerning entails.</HEAD>
<P>THat no man can name a successor to his
heir, is a maxim in the Roman law,
founded on the very nature of property; which
accordingly is also a maxim in the law of Scot∣land.
Land, or any subject belonging to me,
is at my disposal: but when my heir succeeds, it
belongs to him, and is at his disposal. My will
cannot regulate the succession to an estate that
now belongs to my heir, more than it can regu∣late
the succession to an estate that never belong∣ed
to me. The only means in my power for
making my will effectual in this case, is the ta∣king
my heir bound to make the person named
by me his heir; which, in the Roman law, is
termed <HI>fide commissum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historical Law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This maxim holds in property only, not in
rights grafted on property. If a man make a grant
burdening his land-property, and in the grant
name a series of heirs to succeed to the grantee;
neither the grantee, nor any of his heirs named, can,
without consent of the granter, or his heirs, al∣ter
<PB N="333" REF="348"/>
the order of succession. A proprietor cannot
limit his own heirs, who have the power of dispo∣sal
as amply as he had; but a proprietor is not
bound to suffer any to possess his land, but those
he has consented to. Even in Rome, where the
maxim was inviolable, it was never doubted, but
that in a perpetual lease, termed <HI>emphyteusis,</HI> or
in any lease, the proprietor and lessee in conjunc∣tion
can name the persons who shall succeed in
the lease. For the same reason, the nomination
of heirs in a feudal grant, is consistent with the
strictest principles of property: the superior con∣tinues
proprietor; and he is not bound to admit
as his vassal or tenant, any but the persons he
has consented to. Thus it came to be establish∣ed
by means of the feudal system, not that a man
singly can regulate the succession of his heir, but
that a vassal, with consent of his superior, can sub∣stitute
heirs without end, to enjoy his estate one
after another.</P>
<P>In the feudal system, the land is the superior's
property; and the vassal has the usufruct only,
differing little in substance from a liferent. The
vassal may dispose of what belongs to himself;
but as the land is not his property, no deed
done by him can affect either the superior, or
the heirs of investiture. And thus, by the feu∣dal
system, every land-estate was in effect en∣tailed.</P>
<P>But the feudal system was a violent encroach∣ment
<PB N="334" REF="349"/>
on the natural rights of men: nature at last
prevailed, and overturned the tottering edifice.
Even in Scotland, it is reduced to a shadow: the
substance is gone, and little left but its formali∣ties.
The property, which originally was reser∣ved
by the superior, is transferred to the vassal;
and his will governs, not that of the superior.
Land is now restored to commerce, and is bought
and sold like other merchandise. That this in
England was the condition of land-property as
early as Edward I. appears from the statute <HI>Quia
emptores terrarum,</HI> enacting, “That a vassal
may sell his land without consent of the supe∣rior,
and that the superior shall receive the
purchaser as his vassal.” Here was an end to
entails, as far as founded on the feudal system.</P>
<P>But men, who in peaceable times found leisure
to think of perpetuating their name and family,
took dislike at the free commerce of land; and
wished for the feudal law as far as it answered
their views. When a grant of land is made to a
family, conditioned to return to the granter and
his heirs after extinction of that family, it was
thought hard, that the grantee, or any of his
heirs, should have it in their power to disappoint
the donor by aliening the land. To relieve from
that hardship, the English statute, <HI>De donis con∣ditionalibus,</HI>
was made<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">13. Edward I. cap. 1.</NOTE>. It proceeds on the
<PB N="335" REF="350"/>
recital, first, of land given to a man and his wife,
and their issue, conditionally, that if they die
without issue, the land shall revert to the giver,
and his heirs. Next, of land given in free mar∣riage,
which implies a condition, that if the hus∣band
and wife die without issue, the land shall
revert to the giver, and his heirs. And, third,
of land given to a man, and the heirs of his bo∣dy,
conditionally, that it shall in like manner re∣vert,
failing issue. It subsumes, that, contrary to
the conditions expressed or implied in such grants,
the feoffees had power to alien the land, to the
disappointment, not only of the heirs as to their
right of succession, but also of the donor as to
his right of reversion. Therefore enacts, “That
the will of the donor shall from henceforth be
observed; so that the donees shall have no
power to alien the land, but that it shall re∣main
to the issue chosen in the deed; and when
they fail, shall revert to the donor, or his
heirs.” This statute, in a style very different
from the present mode, is laconic, but not the
less perspicuous, as it leaves no doubt about the
intention of the legislature. It resembles, how∣ever,
not a little, the will of a despotic prince:
it pronounces a <HI>fiat,</HI> but deigns not to prescribe
the means for making the <HI>fiat</HI> effectual. It is
left to judges and to men learned in the law, to
contrive means the best they can. From the
whole tenor of the act, it appears, that the land
<PB N="336" REF="351"/>
is understood to be conveyed to the donee; and
accordingly all writers agree, that the donee is
restrained from aliening, not from defect of right,
but by force of the statute; consequently, that
his deed of alienation is not void, but only void∣able
as a transgression of the statute. They fur∣ther
agree, that the debts of the donee are not
effectual, more than his alienations, against his
heirs, nor against the donor. And lastly, it is
held in general, that every act by which the will
of the donor can be disappointed, is barred by
the statute, not even excepting high treason.
These inferences are derived, all of them, from
the declared will of the legislature: “Ordering,
That the will of the donor be observed; and
that the land shall remain to the issue chosen
in the deed; and when they fail, shall revert to
the donor, or his heirs.” The donor accor∣dingly
is, by English writers, said to have an e∣state
in the land, which is a fee-simple on ex∣pectancy.
The donee, commonly called <HI>tenant
in tail,</HI> is said to have another estate in the land,
termed an <HI>estate-tail;</HI> which is an estate of inhe∣ritance,
i. e. an estate that descends to heirs, but
which his debts and deeds cannot affect, more
than if he were a naked liferenter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke, 2d inst. p. 335.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Did the property remain with the donor, this
statute would be conformable to the strictest prin∣ciples
<PB N="337" REF="352"/>
of the Feudal law; for, as observed above,
no deed done by a vassal can hurt the superior.
But the fact which the statute has in view, is a
grant of the land to the donee; which vests the
property in him, and reserves nothing to the do∣nor
but a reversion. Such a reversion, which is
founded on a covenant merely, and has no lien
on the land, or, as we express it, is not a real
right, does not bar the donee from aliening the
land; and consequently, is not at common law
effectual against a purchaser. It binds indeed
the donee and his heirs, by virtue of the cove∣nant;
but it binds none who are not parties in
the covenant. The statute however declares it
effectual against all the world, in spite of prin∣ciples;
and the statute must be obeyed. The
commerce of land is thus rendered extremely ha∣zardous;
for, after the utmost precaution, a
purchaser of land must for ever remain uncertain,
whether the vender may not have been bar∣red
by an entail from aliening. Such obstruc∣tion
to commerce, we have the charity to believe,
was not early foreseen. While an entail is re∣cent,
it must be produced by the vender as his
title for aliening: but after a family has been
long in possession, perhaps a century or two, it
will not readily enter into the thoughts of a pur∣chaser
to demand a title so far back. English
entails became a public nuisance; and the cir∣cumstance
<PB N="338" REF="353"/>
mentioned, contributed probably more
than any other to their downfal.</P>
<P>A bolder attack on the principles of justice, e∣ven
the most sacred, is not to be found in the
laws of any country;—the transactions of credi∣tors
and purchasers, upon which their bread may
depend, trampled under foot; and sacrificed, not
to the living solely, but to heirs coming into ex∣istence
perhaps a thousand years after. If a land∣holder
must be humoured in rendering his estate
a sort of mortmain, why not put an indelible mark
upon it? Why not publish to the world, Here
lies a snake, touch it not? This metaphorical
snake, more poisonous than any that really exist,
is not provided even with a rattle to warn pas∣sengers.
Such violent encroachments on justice,
confound legal principles, and reduce law to be
a chaos. Legal principles ought to be held sa∣cred
by the legislature, as well as by individuals,
never to be infringed upon any account whate∣ver.
But the thirteenth century was a period of
gross ignorance through all Europe, the northern
parts especially; and in those dark times, prin∣ciples,
whether of religion, law, or morality,
were very little understood. Nor is the statute
under consideration singular in that respect.
There is a similar instance in Scotland; and ma∣ny
such may be found in the laws of every coun∣try.
Where a man sells land, and takes the
purchaser bound, upon receiving back the price,
<PB N="339" REF="354"/>
to restore the land to him, such an obligation,
which is merely personal, cannot bar the pur∣chaser
from aliening the land for a valuable consi∣deration;
though it may subject him to damages
for transgressing his obligation. Yet the act 27.
of our parliament 1469, declares, “That the re∣version
provided to the disponer shall be effec∣tual
to him against all singular successors, e∣qually
as against the granter of the reversion.”
Neither necessity nor utility are here urged: the
act is put entirely upon law and conscience. How
cloudy must have been the notions of our lawgi∣vers
at that period, not to perceive that both law
and conscience are deeply wounded by this act;
especially as no provision is made for publishing
such a reversion, more than for publishing an
English entail?</P>
<P>The curious reader, before he enter upon the
act 1685, will not be satisfied with an account of
English entails, but will wish to be made ac∣quainted
also with entails made in Scotland up∣on
the foundation of common law, prior to the
act 1685. By our common law, the property of
land vests in the heir upon completing his title
by infeftment; which impowers him to alien, to
contract debt, and to exercise every other act of
property. Now, to bar an heir infeft from ex∣ercising
such acts, prohibitive and irritant clau∣ses
are the only means known at common
<PB N="340" REF="355"/>
law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Bacon's history of the nature, use, and pro∣ceedings of the law of England, sect. 4. par. 13. we learn, that what are called perpetuities were introduced into England, after the invention of docking an entail by a fine and recovery. These perpetuities were sup∣ported by clauses prohibitory and resolutive, precisely as our entails are. And it is likely, that the form of our entails was borrowed from the English perpetuities.</NOTE>; and yet that they are ineffectual, is de∣monstrated
in Historical Law-tracts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tract 3.</NOTE>. A man
may bind his heirs, by prohibiting them to alien,
or contract debt; but he cannot prohibit one to
purchase from his heir, or to lend money to him,
because a purchaser or creditor is not subjected
to his authority. A penalty annexed to the pro∣hibition,
such as a forfeiture of the heir's right,
will affect him; and upon a declarator of irri∣tancy,
will deprive him of the estate. And yet,
as he continues proprietor till a decree be pro∣nounced
in the declarator, his alienations must
be effectual, as well as debts contracted by him.
Thus, an entailed estate is protected against the
deeds of the possessor, as one is against being
robbed or murdered: the terror of punishment
is in both cases the only protection. If a tenant
in tail boldly risk a forfeiture, he can put an end
to the firmest entail that can be made at common
law.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="356"/>
We are now prepared for the act 1685, the
subject of the present article. The act is no less
perplexed than obscure: it expresses an intention
to make entails effectual; but that intention is
the only thing which is clearly expressed. Such
a statute resembles an ancient oracle: the dark∣er,
the more revered. Singularly unlucky it is
for this nation, that the obscurity of this statute,
has led our judges, to extend entails beyond
what the words import, and probably beyond
what was intended by the legislature.</P>
<P>In commenting upon this statute, the leading
point is, Upon whom has the statute bestowed
the privilege, of making an entail that shall be
secure against creditors and purchasers? The re∣markable
case of Stormont<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">26th February 1662, in the first volume of Deci∣sions collected by Lord Stair.</NOTE> paved the way to
the statute. The entail upon which the debate
arose in that case, was made by a proprietor in∣feft.
At that period, and for a long time after
the statute, an heir-apparent had no hold of the
land, nor any authority over it; and to think of
his making an entail would have been a gross ab∣surdity.
We may therefore with certainty con∣clude,
that no person was in the eye of the le∣gislature,
but one regularly infeft as proprietor.
And if an heir-apparent be excluded, a disponee,
whose right is personal only, cannot be included.
<PB N="342" REF="357"/>
There is not a single clause in the statute, that
can be stretched to comprehend either: in eve∣ry
clause it is taken for granted, that the persons
authorised to make an entail are infeft in the e∣state;
witness the following clause in particular,
“Such tailzies shall only be allowed, in which
the foresaid irritant and resolutive clauses are
insert in the procuratories of resignation, char∣ters,
precepts, and instruments of seisin.” The
deeds and writs here named imply clearly, that
the maker of an entail must be infeft; because
such deeds and writs cannot be made by an heir∣apparent,
or by a disponee.</P>
<P>To have a just notion of a statutory entail,
another point is no less necessary to be known;
and that is, the means employed by the statute to
secure the estate against creditors and purchasers.
The case of Stormont, mentioned above, led the
way to the statute. The point debated in that
case was, Whether an heir infeft is effectually
barred, by prohibitive and irritant clauses, from
aliening, and contracting debt? The affirmative
was decided, upon the following ground, That
prohibitions and irritancies in an entail, ought to
have the same effect to bar persons from bar∣gaining
with a tenant in tail, that an interdic∣tion
has to bar persons from bargaining with
one interdicted. And upon authority of that
judgement, many entails were made before the
statute had a being. A prevailing bias for en∣tails,
<PB N="343" REF="358"/>
rendered our judges blind to the principles
of common law concerning property. Doubts
arose; and the following train of reasoning made
an impression. To take advantage of the weak
and facile, is contrary to justice and humanity;
and yet it requires an interdiction, which is an
act of sovereign authority, to prevent such ad∣vantage
to be taken. Nor is the sovereign's au∣thority
alone sufficient: the interdiction must be
published, to put all on their guard. Now it is
not in the power of the sovereign, to protect an
estate against creditors and purchasers; and if
so, how can it be imagined, that a private pro∣prietor
should have such a power; especially
without publishing his deed of entail<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this point more fully handled in Historical Law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>? The
legislature, sensible that the argument from in∣terdiction
is inconclusive, made the act 1685, in
order to bestow upon entails the force of an in∣terdiction.
The words are, “It is statuted and
declared, That it shall be lawful to his Maje∣sty's
subjects to tailzie their lands, to substitute
heirs in their tailzies, with such provisions and
conditions as they shall think fit, and to affect
the saids tailzies with irritant and resolutive
clauses; whereby it shall not be lawful to the
heirs of tailzie to sell, contract debt, or do
any other deed, whereby the same may be ad∣judged
<PB N="344" REF="359"/>
or evicted from the substitutes, or the
succession frustrate or interrupted. And his
Majesty declares these clauses to be real and
effectual, not only against the contraveners
and their heirs, but also against their credi∣tors-adjudgers,
and other singular successors,
whether by legal or conventional titles.” Thus,
by force of the statute, prohibitive and irritant
clauses are made effectual, to bar people from
purchasing from a tenant in tail, or from lending
him money, as they are barred from purchasing
or lending to a person interdicted. But as ju∣stice
requires, that an entail be published, as well
as an interdiction, in order to put all men on
their guard, the greatest anxiety is shown to have
it published in such a manner as to leave no per∣son
in ignorance. In the first place, it must be
ingrossed in every writ necessary for infeftment.
In the next place, the original tailzie must judi∣cially
be produced before the Lords of Session,
who are ordained to interpose their authority
thereto. In the third place, the tailzie must be
recorded in a register-book kept for that purpose.
And there is a fourth provision, which shows still
more clearly, that publication is what is chiefly
relied on for making an entail effectual. The
provision is, “That the prohibitory and irritant
clauses must be repeated in the rights and con∣veyances
of the heirs of tailzie by which they
bruik or enjoy the estate.” And it is decla∣red,
<PB N="345" REF="360"/>
“That if these clauses be omitted in the
heir's infeftment, creditors, and other singu∣lar
successors who contract with him <HI>bona fide,</HI>
shall be secure.” Our legislature acted wisely
in requiring these various notifications. They
had been taught by experience, that the ingross∣ing
the clauses in the original infeftment of en∣tail,
is far from being sufficient. Such an infeft∣ment
may have been executed a century back;
and as time advances, becomes more and more
distant. But even where recent, every person has
not access to it: a man agreeing to lend a great
sum on heritable security, may boldly call for the
title-deeds: but a shopkeeper must not disoblige
his customers; and ought therefore to have some
means more public for discovering whether he be
in safety to deal with them.</P>
<P>The nature and extent of the security afforded
to entails by the statute 1685, will be clearly un∣derstood,
upon considering, that it makes no al∣teration
in our common law with respect to the
transmission of land-property. The estate de∣scends
from the entailer to the heirs named in the
deed of entail; and each heir connects with his
predecessor by a special service and infeftment,
precisely as where there is no entail. And to e∣vince,
that the property is completely vested in
each heir, we have the authority of the statute
itself; which, taking that proposition for grant∣ed,
employs prohibitive and irritant clauses to
<PB N="346" REF="361"/>
bar alienation. Such clauses would be super∣fluous
and absurd, were a tenant in tail so limited
from the nature of his right, as to make it <HI>ultra
vires</HI> in him to alien, or contract debt: they
would resemble a prohibition to walk on the sea,
or to visit the inhabitants of the moon. In the
subsequent observations, this proposition will be
taken for granted as fundamental. It was not
thought adviseable to make any alteration in the
nature or transmission of land-property; and the
only means left for securing entails, were prohi∣bitions
and forfeitures. A tenant in tail is sub∣jected,
by his own consent, to the prohibitive
and irritant clauses: he accepts of the estate un∣der
these conditions. All others are subjected by
the statute, discharging them to lend money to a
tenant in tail, or to purchase his land. Hence,
no deed done contrary to these prohibitions, is
available in law: with respect to the tenant in
tail, it is voidable as a transgression of his en∣gagement;
and with respect both to him and to
the person he contracts with, it is voidable as a
contempt of legal authority.</P>
<P>Next in order come the essential solemnities of
an entail, such as intitle it to the privileges of
the statute 1685. I enquire, in the first place,
whether it be necessary to a statutory entail that
infeftment pass on it. That point is determined
by a clause mentioned above, “That such tail∣zies
shall only be allowed, in which the irri∣tant
<PB N="347" REF="362"/>
and resolutive clauses are insert in the pro∣curatories
of resignation, charters, precepts
and instruments of seisin.” Therefore an en∣tail
cannot have the privileges of the statute, un∣less
it be engrossed in a procuratory of resignation,
in the charter granted by the superior in pur∣suance
of that procuratory, in the precept of seisin,
and in the instrument of seisin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As by act 7. parl. 1672, it is enjoined, that the pre∣cept of seisin be inserted at the end of every charter from the crown; I do not readily see why the irritant and resolutive clauses should be twice ingrossed in every such charter. Did our legislature overlook the said act 1672? However this be, one thing is clear, that an entail can have no support from the act 1685, unless the irritant and resolutive clauses be ingrossed in the precept of seisin, as well as in the procuratory of resignation, in the charter, and in the instrument of seisin. Upon in∣spection of the record, it will be found, that this solem∣nity has not always been completely fulfilled.</NOTE>. As an entail
deviates far from common law, and has no foun∣dation
in equity, it must be executed precisely as
the statute directs, otherwise it is not a statutory
entail. Therefore a deed of entail left by the
entailer without completing it by infeftment, is
not a statutory entail. Holding strictly to the
statute, I cannot admit, that an entail ingrossed in
a disposition of land to be held of the granter, is
a statutory entail, even though it be completed
by infeftment. There is no mention of such an
entail in the statute; and supposing it to have
<PB N="348" REF="363"/>
been omitted by oversight, which however can∣not
be made evident, a court, whether of law
or of equity, is not impowered to supply the
defect. The first essential solemnity then of an
entail that is intitled to the privileges of the sta∣tute,
is, that it be ingrossed in a new settle∣ment
of the estate, completed by a procuratory
of resignation, a charter from the superior, and
seisin upon it. A second essential solemnity is,
that the authority of the court of session be given
to the entail. And a third, that it be recorded
in the register of tailzies. These three particu∣lars
are united in the statute, which enacts,
“That such tailzies only shall be allowed (i. e.
have the privileges of the statute) where the
foresaid irritant and resolutive clauses are in∣sert
in the procuratories of resignation, char∣ters,
precepts, and instruments of seisin; and
where the original tailzie is produced before
the court of session, and recorded in a parti∣cular
register.” Without any of these solem∣nities,
an entail may be effectual to regulate
the succession of heirs, and to regulate every o∣ther
point that depends on common law: but
unless these solemnities, all of them, be adhibi∣ted,
an entail can draw no support from the act
1685, more than it can draw from the act 1681,
where it wants the name of the writer, or desig∣nation
of the witnesses. The three solemnities
mentioned must be performed in their order.
<PB N="349" REF="364"/>
The clauses of the entail must, in the first place,
be ingrossed in the infeftmemt. The entail must
next be produced before the Lords of Session
for their approbation. And the final step is, to
record it in the register of tailzies. If a deed of
entail, without infeftment, be produced in the
court of session, the judges are not bound to in∣terpose
their authority: nay they cannot interpose,
without contradicting the statute, which expressly
enacts, that a tailzie shall not be allowed, unless
the irritant and resolutive clauses be ingrossed in
the infeftment. And if an entail be presented to
the register, without authority of the court of
session, the clerk-register and his deputes ought
not to record it.</P>
<P>Upon the plan of the statute it follows, that no
person is intitled to produce an entail before the
court of session, in order to have it recorded, but
the maker himself, or his heir infeft, who, were
there need for it, could make it <HI>de novo.</HI> Any
one of the substitutes is indeed intitled to have
the entail recorded for preservation; but it is the
right of the maker only, or of his heir infeft, to
complete the entail, by adhibiting the solemni∣ties
required by the statute. This is obvious with
respect to the solemnity of inserting in the infeft∣ment
the prohibitive and irritant clauses; which
depends entirely on the will of the person who
makes the entail: he is not bound to make an
entail; nor, after taking some steps, is he bound
<PB N="350" REF="365"/>
to complete it: he may throw it iuto the fire if
he please. And with respect to every one of the
solemnities, a deed of entail, as a <HI>corpus</HI> or
moveable, follows the land, and appertains to the
heir infeft, who has the same power over it that
the maker had. No substitute is intitled to pro∣duce
it in the court of session, or to record it in
the register of entails. Suppose a man leaves his
testament imperfect, subscribed by himself, but not
by the witnesses. After his death, a legatee ap∣plies
to the court of session, praying their autho∣rity
to make the witnesses subscribe, in order to
validate the testament. Would the court listen
to this prayer? Certainly not. No person is in∣titled
to complete a deed but the maker, or his
heir who has right to it by succession. This holds
in a testament, and it must equally hold in a deed
of entail.</P>
<P>View the matter in a different light. The
maker of an entail is not bound to adhibit the
statutory solemnities, nor consequently his heir.
If so, no action can be sustained at the instance of
a substitute, either against the maker, or his heir,
to oblige them to complete the entail. Now sup∣posing
the deed of entail to fall accidentally in∣to
the hands of a substitute, can his accidental
possession give him any right over it that he had
not formerly? So far from acquiring any new
right, he is bound to deliver it to the person to
<PB N="351" REF="366"/>
whom it belongs; and can, if he refuse, be com∣pelled
by an action of exhibition.</P>
<P>It may possibly be urged for a substitute, That
a man who makes a deed of entail, surely intends
to make it effectual; otherwise why so many an∣xious
clauses <HI>de non alienando, et non contra∣hendo
debitum?</HI> and that the heir ought to
obey the will of his predecessor. It is obvious
to answer, first, That nothing is more common
than change of mind: a man probably, at the
time of making an entail, intends to complete it;
but if he stop short, and leave it in its imperfect
state till he dies, may not change of mind be
justly inferred? Answered, next, The heir is
not bound to supply any defect in his predeces∣sor's
deed, unless he be taken bound by an ex∣press
clause so to do. And supposing an inten∣tion
in the predecessor to have his will completed,
a court of equity will indeed lay hold of inten∣tion,
where justice requires their interposition;
but no court will give force to presumed intention,
in order to deprive a man of his birthright, by
subjecting him to the fetters of an entail.</P>
<P>The following question arises from what is now
said. An entail is left by the maker complete
in every point, except as to recording: Are the
tutors of his infant-heir bound to apply for ha∣ving
it recorded in the register of entails? It
would be an act directly against the interest of
their pupil; and consequently inconsistent with
<PB N="352" REF="367"/>
their duty. And it would be unjust in the court
of session to countenance the application.</P>
<P>Supposing now an entail to be complete in all
its solemnities; the great points to be consider∣ed
are, What are the effects of it; Against
what heirs it operates; and, Against what deeds.
Of these in their order. The English statute en∣ables
a proprietor to withdraw his estate from
commerce, and to secure it entire to the heirs
of entail. Our statute is very different. What
gave rise to it, as mentioned above, is the re∣markable
case of Stormont, in which the debate
was, Whether an heir infeft can be barred by
prohibitive and irritant clauses from aliening and
contracting debt. The court gave their opinion
for the affirmative; but as that opinion had
no foundation at common law, the statute was
made, enabling proprietors to fetter their heirs
infeft, beyond what can be done at common law.
The prohibitions accordingly and irritancies of
the statute, regard none but heirs of entail infeft,
and those who contract with them. Observe, first,
that these clauses are directed against heirs who can
sell the estate; and no heir has that power but who
is infeft. Observe, next, the clause intitling the
substitute who obtains a declarator of irritancy,
to serve to a remoter predecessor infeft, passing
by the contravener. Here evidently the contra∣vening
heir is understood to be infeft: for surely
it requires not a statute to enable the substitute
<PB N="353" REF="368"/>
to pass by an heir not infeft: nay, he must pass
by him, as there is no such thing in law as ser∣ving
to an heir-apparent. Scrutinize the statute
from beginning to end, there is not a single
word in it to create even a suspicion that any heirs
were in view but heirs infeft, and in possession.
Debts contracted by a substitute were not in
view; nor is there any provision against such
debts. Nay more, I say affirmatively, that such
debts were intended not to be prohibited; which
is evident from the following clause: “That
creditors, and other singular successors, shall
be secure who contract <HI>bona fide</HI> with the per∣son
standing infeft in the estate, unless the ir∣ritant
and resolutive clauses be in the body of
his right.” Here it is declared lawful to lend
money knowingly to an heir of entail, though
the entail be on record, if the resolutive and ir∣ritant
clauses be omitted in the heir's infeftment.
It could not therefore be the intention of the le∣gislature,
to forfeit a man who lends money to a
substitute in an entail, even though he know
him to be a substitute; and less, if possible, where
he lends money <HI>bona fide</HI> without knowing his
debtor to be a substitute. An absurdity so gross
is not supposeable. A merchant turns bankrupt
after borrowing from me a thousand pounds.
He succeeds to an entailed estate by the death
of many intervening substitutes; and I lay hold
of that opportunity to adjudge the estate on a
<PB N="354" REF="369"/>
charge against him to enter heir. An act of in∣justice
so flagrant as to cut down my adjudication
without any wrong on my part, could not be in∣tended.
And with respect to the substitute, my
debtor, what crime has he committed? A sub∣stitute
is a free man; nor is even an heir-appa∣rent
subjected to the provisions of an entail, till
he enter, and be infeft: before that step be ta∣ken,
he is as free and independent as the remo∣test
substitute. At the same time, his declining
to enter, will not protect the estate from his cre∣ditors,
more than if it were a fee-simple: their
adjudications on a charge to enter must be effec∣tual.
Nor will his entering heir hurt his credi∣tors.
The statute prohibits not any person to
lend money to a substitute in an entail; and a
debt once lawfully contracted, cannot be cut
down by the debtor's chusing to enter heir. No
entail can be contrived to prevent that conse∣quence.
A clause, it is true, may be contrived,
excluding from the succession every heir who is
in debt. Such a clause may be effectual against
the heir; but it will not hurt his creditors,
who are not prohibited, either by the statute or
at common law, to adjudge the estate for their
payment.</P>
<P>Thus, every heir-apparent is left free, by the
statute, to annihilate the firmest entail that can
be devised. Instead of entering, he contracts
debt: his creditors acquire right to the estate
<PB N="355" REF="370"/>
by adjudication; and he has got the value in
money. Nor can I admit this to be a defect in
the statute. It was a great stretch in our legisla∣ture,
to indulge a few individuals, against the
common interest, to bar their heirs infeft from a∣liening,
or contracting debt. It would have been
a still greater stretch, and also more hurtful to
the commerce of land, to bar every one of a
long train of substitutes from making such trans∣actions.
Our legislature must have been short∣sighted
indeed, to have overlooked this particu∣lar;
and if it was under deliberation, their si∣lence
is a demonstration that they had no inten∣tion
to bar any deeds but those of the heir infeft.</P>
<P>The only doubt that can arise upon this point,
is, Whether an heir-apparent who suffers the en∣tailed
estate to be adjudged for debt contracted
by himself, be not accountable to the substitutes
for the money he received, considered as the
price of the estate. This doubt is easily remo∣ved.
A substitute has no claim to the estate,
nor consequently to the price, while the heir-ap∣parent
is alive: nor, after the death of the heir∣apparent,
can his representatives or executors be
made liable; because the money received by
him was borrowed money, and cannot be reckon∣ed
the price of an estate that never belonged to
him. If it be urged, That the heir-apparent
ought to be subjected to damages, for permit∣ting
the entailed estate to be carried off by his
<PB N="356" REF="371"/>
creditors; I answer, That a claim of damages
supposes a wrong done which ought to be repair∣ed;
and I see not that a man commits any wrong
in borrowing money, though he happens to be a
substitute in an entail. A tentant in tail, who,
by forbearing to insert in his infeftment the pro∣hibitory
and irritant clauses, lays the estate open
to his creditors, is guilty of a wrong in neglect∣ing
what he is enjoined to do by the deed of en∣tail;
and that wrong intitles the substitutes to
reparation. But an heir-apparent is not bound
by the entail; and therefore is not guilty of any
wrong in contracting debt, and suffering the e∣state
to be attached by his creditors.</P>
<P>So much as to the persons who are subjected
by the statute to the provisions of an entail. We
next take under consideration what debts and
deeds are prohibited. The obscurity of the sta∣tute
may occasion a doubt, what prohibitions
are made effectual against strangers, whether e∣very
prohibition that can be devised by an en∣tailer,
or only the prohibitions of purchasing, and
lending money. A landholder, without needing
the aid of a statute, can fetter his heirs at his
pleasure: they cannot stand in opposition; be∣cause
they inherit the estate on condition of ful∣filling
his will. But no prohibition, except what
is authorised by the statute, can be effectual a∣gainst
those who represent him not. Now, when
the statute is examined with the most critical eye,
<PB N="357" REF="372"/>
there is not found in it any prohibition against
strangers, but that of lending money to a tenant
in tail, and that of purchasing land from him.
If it be urged, That it seems intended by the sta∣tute,
to make effectual against all the world eve∣ry
provision that can be invented by an entailer;
it is answered, first, That such intention cannot
be gathered from the statute, not even by the
most distant implication: and, next, That sup∣posing
the intention to be implied; yet, in a
matter repugnant to utility, as well as to the
principles of property, equity authorises not jud∣ges
to supply any defect, whether of words or of
intention. Thus it appears, that strangers, in
bargaining with a tenant in tail, are subjected to
no prohibition but of lending money, and pur∣chasing
land. They can straight marches with
him; and land may be exchanged for the bene∣fit
of both estates: such deeds only are prohibi∣ted
by the statute as are hurtful to the entailed
estate, not what are beneficial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the act 10<SUP>0</SUP> Geo. III. cap. 51. a tenant in tail is permitted to exchange land with a neighbour, to the extent of thirty acres; which indeed supposes, that the exchanging land is barred by the act 1685. But an erroneous supposition, though in an act of parlia∣ment, does not overturn law. It cannot be overturned but by a positive enactment.</NOTE>. Churlish en∣tailers
put their heirs under a prohibition of grant∣ing
long leases, though no less prejudicial to the
<PB N="358" REF="373"/>
heirs, and even to the estate, than to the public.
But there is no authority in the statute for such
a prohibition: a lease is not a sale; nor can it
be made the ground of an adjudication for evict∣ing
the estate. An entailer may prohibit his heir
from granting a long lease; but that bars not
the lessee, over whom he has no power. The
lessee is indeed accessory to the wrong done by
the lessor, in transgressing a prohibition in the en∣tail;
but such wrongs, which are not criminal
<HI>sua natura,</HI> operate not against accessories<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See before, article 3. how far a challenge against the author is effectual against the person who acquires from him.</NOTE>.
I would not however be understood, to plead
for a lease beyond what is necessary for promo∣ting
industry and improvements, a lease, for ex∣ample,
of two or three nineteen years. A lease
of ninety or a hundred years may justly be held
a species of alienation, to fall under the statuto∣ry
prohibition. A lease of a moderate endurance
for an elusory rent, will not fall under that pro∣hibition:
but it will be reducible at common
law; because the slightest wrong by a tenant in
tail, will affect such accessories as are <HI>in lucro
captando.</HI> Neither is a liferent-locality to a
bride in her contract of marriage prohibited by
the statute: it is not a loan; it is not a purchase
of any part of the property; and an adjudication
cannot proceed upon it. The same holds with
<PB N="359" REF="374"/>
respect to an annuity for life; provided it be
granted under a condition, that the annuitant
shall not be intitled to adjudge for payment of
arrears.</P>
<P>Taking it now for granted, that no act nor
deed is prohibited by the statute, but what tends
directly or indirectly to carry off land from the
heirs of entail; the next inquiry is, Whether all
acts and deeds by which land may be carried off
from these heirs, are prohibited by the statute.
In prosecution of this inquiry, I begin with con∣sidering,
that as the means employed in the sta∣tute
for securing entails, are prohibitive and ir∣ritant
clauses, it clearly follows, that if there be
any debts or deeds that cannot fall under a pro∣hibition,
these must have their effect at common
law; for they are not barred by the statute.
Whether there be any debts or deeds of that
kind, will appear from the nature of a prohibi∣tion.
An order requiring any person to perform
a certain act, or to forbear performing, supposes
that person to be a voluntary agent: to order a
man to jump over a mountain, or to restrain his
pulse from beating, is an absurdity. Voluntary
acts may be prohibited; but there is not a single
word in the statute, that points at such an absur∣dity
as the prohibiting involuntary acts. So far
from it, that feu-duties, and other casualties of
superiority, which are involuntary with respect
to every heir of entail, are declared to be effec∣tual.
<PB N="360" REF="375"/>
And there are debts and deeds of various
kinds that cannot fall under a prohibition, as be∣ing
altogether involuntary with respect to the
claimant. A merchant who bargains for ready
money, and is disappointed of his payment, is
not guilty of contemning the authority of the sta∣tute:
he lent no sum to the tenant in tail, nor
intended to give him trust. The hands of a te∣nant
in tail are not tied up from doing mischief:
if he burn my house, or rob me of my goods,
he is subjected to reparation, without my fault on
my part; and his estate must be liable, as well
as his person: it would be gross injustice to pro∣tect
the estate against such a claim. A tenant
in tail grants a lease to me; but breaks his en∣gagement,
and puts another in possession. With∣out
any fault on my part, or any breach of legal
authority, I become his creditor for a great sum
of damages. A tenant in tail is required by a
neighbouring heritor to concur in erecting a
march-fence: he fails; and a decree passes a∣gainst
him for fifty or sixty pounds. A tenant in
tail has levied the rents, stock, and teind, near
forty years: the titular obtains a decree against
him for a large sum as the value of the teind.
Debts of the nature mentioned, being altogether
involuntary on the creditor's part, must be ef∣fectual
against the strictest entail. The terce and
courtesy, being founded on the law of the land,
are not voluntary deeds to be brought under
<PB N="361" REF="376"/>
a prohibition. A stipend to a minister, a salary
to a schoolmaster, wages to a servant, an account
due to an apothecary, to an agent, and a thou∣sand
such, were certainly not intended to be pro∣hibited
by the statute; and consequently will be
effectual against the estate.</P>
<P>Worldly-minded men, who are fonder of their
estates than of their heirs, will be apt to think,
that it was the intention of the legislature, though
not expressed, to secure an entailed estate against
claims of every kind; and that it is incumbent
on a court of equity to enforce the intention of
the legislature, whether expressed or implied.
But, in the first place, these gentlemen have no
encouragement from the statute, to say that
more was intended but to prohibit purchasing
and lending money; especially as it would be
grossly unjust to forfeit involuntary debts, where
there is no contempt of authority. Such gross
injustice, it is true, may be the fruit of the Eng∣lish
statute, which declares in general, that the
will of the donor shall be observed, and that the
land shall remain to the issue chosen in the deed.
But that statute, the production of an ignorant
age, was not copied by us; nor will ever be
copied in any civilized country. In the next
place, supposing more to have been intended by
the legislature than expressed, yet equity will not
permit a judge to give force to any implied inten∣tion
that is productive of injustice.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="377"/>
Having said what occurred upon debts, we
proceed to purchases. And here another rule
occurs, founded on the very nature of a prohi∣bition.
To make a prohibition effectual, it is not
alone sufficient that the deed prohibited be vo∣luntary:
it is necessary that it be also known to
the party who transgresses it; for without know∣ledge,
there can be no contempt of authority.
This requires explanation. A purchase from one
who has no right, is void, whether the purchaser
be <HI>in bona</HI> or <HI>mala fide;</HI> because a conveyance
from one who has no right, can give no right to
the acquirer. But I have had more than one oc∣casion
to mention, that a tenant in tail in Scot∣land,
has the property of the estate completely
vested in him; and consequently, that if he be
barred from aliening, the restraint arises, not
from defect of right, but from the statutory pro∣hibition.
It follows, as will appear more fully
afterward, that a sale by a tenant in tail trans∣fers
the property to a purchaser; and that
the prohibitive clause can only found a re∣duction
against the purchaser, the result of which
is, to deprive him of his right, as a punish∣ment
for his contempt of legal authority. But if
the purchaser happen to be ignorant that the sub∣ject
is entailed, he acts <HI>bona fide,</HI> and cannot
be reached by a reduction; for it is an inviolable
rule of law, That a man cannot be deprived of
his property against his consent, unless as a pu∣nishment
<PB N="363" REF="378"/>
for wrong done by him. Now, a pur∣chase
may be made <HI>bona fide</HI> from a tenant in
tail, though the entail has been published accor∣ding
to the injunctions of the statute. In record∣ing
an entail, all that the statute requires, is a
general designation of the lordships and baronies.
The particular farms have names that enter not the
record; beside that farms are every day split into
parts, and moulded into different farms with new
names. I purchase one of these farms from a te∣nant
in tail, having no suspicion that it makes a
part of the entailed estate. The property is fair∣ly
transferred to me; and I cannot be reached
by a reduction, because though I have transgress∣ed
the prohibition by purchasing, yet as the trans∣gression
is innocent, I have not been guilty of
contemning the statute. I put another case still
more clear. After possessing this new farm some
years without challenge, a purchaser from me is
undoubtedly secure; for if a purchase from a
tenant in tail who has neglected to insert in his
infeftment the prohibitive and irritant clauses, be
lawful, though known by the purchaser to be
part of the entailed estate; a purchase from me,
who have no entailed estate, is <HI>a fortiori</HI> lawful.
I make a bolder supposition, that a man, pur∣chasing
knowingly from a tenant in tail, lies o∣pen
to a reduction as a contemner of the statute.
Having possessed years without challenge, he dis∣poses
of the subject for a valuable consideration.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="379"/>
I affirm, that the second purchaser is secure, e∣ven
supposing him to have known that the sub∣ject
was entailed. There is no prohibition in the
statute but against that person only who purcha∣ses
from a tenant in tail; and there is no <HI>labes
realis</HI> in that purchase to operate against singular
successors without end. This case I acknowledge
comes under the spirit of the statute, and pro∣bably
would have been guarded against, had it
been foreseen; but in points that affect proper∣ty
and run cross to common law, a <HI>casus omis∣sus</HI>
cannot be supplied by any court. The case
here supposed, is analogous to a reduction <HI>ex ca∣pite
inhibitionis.</HI> A man who purchases from a
person inhibited, is subjected to that reduction;
but the reduction reaches not those who derive
right from that man.</P>
<P>We proceed to consider, whether a statutory
entail be secure against a fine or a forfeiture in∣flicted
on a tenant in tail. With respect to a fine,
the point is not intricate: it must be effectual a∣gainst
the estate; because there can be no fine
but by an act of parliament, or by the decree of
a court; and therefore is none of the acts or
deeds that are prohibited; in which respect, it
resembles a claim of damages mentioned above.
The statute accordingly declares, “That a fine
shall not import a contravention of the irritant
clause,” i. e. shall not be held to be a deed
prohibited by the statute.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="380"/>
Whether an entailed estate be secure against
forfeiture for high treason, is a question that
made a figure in the court of session, and also in
the House of Lords. It was held to be a subtile
question, and puzzled the most learned in our
law; and yet, by a just analysis of our act 1685,
it may be reduced to a very simple point. If a
tenant in tail be proprietor, which is undoubted,
the forfeiture of his lands for high treason is a
necessary consequence, as much as a forfeiture of
his moveables. The statutory prohibitions are
directed against voluntary deeds only, purchasing
from a tenant in tail, and lending him money.
The King, to whom the forfeiture accrues, has
transgressed neither of these prohibitions; and
therefore the statute does not militate against
him. And we have the best authority to support
this argument: it is declared in the statute itself,
“That nothing in this act shall prejudice his
Majesty as to confiscations and fines.” Whence
it appears, that the security afforded by act 33.
parl. 1690, to substitutes against the forfeiture of
a tenant in tail, is a privilege which they are not
intitled to from the nature of a Scotch entail.
This privilege is indeed considered in the act as
a matter of justice merely; but our legislature
was misled by a maxim applicable to an English
entail only, That a man ought not to forfeit by
his crime, what he cannot alien by his will. A
man whose right bestows on him no power of a∣lienation,
<PB N="366" REF="381"/>
cannot alien either by his will or by
his crime. But a man who has the property ab∣solutely
vested in him, can alien; and while he
remains proprietor, his estate may be affected by
adjudication; which will stand effectual, provided
it proceed upon claims that are not prohibited by
the act 1685.</P>
<P>Upon the union of the two kingdoms, the pro∣tection
against forfeiture given to substitutes by
act 1690, was withdrawn; in order to make the
punishment of treason the same in both king∣doms.
English entails are in their nature secure
against forfeiture; “which,” says Lord Bacon,
“made the owners less fearful to commit mur∣ders,
felonies, treason; for that they knew
none of these acts could hurt the heir of his in∣heritance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Use of the law, ch. On property.</NOTE>.” To this evil a remedy was pro∣vided
by 26<SUP>o</SUP> Henry VIII. cap. 13. having the fol∣lowing
preamble: “And to the intent that all
treason should be the more dreaded, hated,
and detested to be done, by any person or per∣sons;
and also because it is a great boldness,
and an occasion to ill-disposed persons to ad∣venture,
and embrace their malicious intents
and enterprises, which all true subjects ought
to study to eschew.” Therefore enacting,
“That such offender shall forfeit all such lands,
tenements, and hereditaments, which he shall
<PB N="367" REF="382"/>
have of any estate of inheritance in use or
possession, by any right, title, or means.” By
force of this statute, the treason of a tenant in
tail, not only forfeits his own right, but also the
expectancy of his heirs; because an estate-tail is
an estate of inheritance. But remainder-men,
who are not heirs, but conditional institutes, are
not hurt by the statute: they are understood to
have an estate in the land separate and distinct
from that of the forfeiting person and his heirs.</P>
<P>So stands the law of England; and in order
that the same acts might be treason in both coun∣tries,
and receive the same punishment, the act
7<SUP>o</SUP> Anne, cap. 20. was made, enacting, “That
such crimes and offences as are high treason,
or misprision of high treason, in England, and
none others, shall, after the first of July 1709,
be high treason and misprision of high treason
in Scotland; and that all persons convicted or
attainted of high treason, or misprision of high
treason, in Scotland, shall be subject and liable
to the same corruption of blood, pains, pe∣nalties,
and forfeitures, with persons convict∣ed
or attainted of these crimes in England:
excepting heirs of entail committing treason
before the said time, and married, who shall
forfeit for themselves only, and not for the
issue of the marriage, being heirs of entail.”
In order to make the treason-laws the same in
both kingdoms, it was no stretch, to forfeit land
<PB N="368" REF="383"/>
entailed in Scotland. An English entail is, in
its nature, secure against forfeiture; and yet is
subjected to forfeiture by the act above mention∣ed
of Henry VIII. A Scotch entail affords no se∣curity
against forfeiture; and to declare this to
be law, was no hardship. In repealing our act
1690, the British legislature made no wider step
than to deprive heirs of entail of a privilege that
had been conferred on them beyond the nature
of their right.</P>
<P>But in making the act 7̄0 of the Queen, it was
not adverted to, that forfeiture must have a more
extensive effect against a Scotch entail, than by
the statute of Henry VIII. it hath against an en∣tail
in England. There, forfeiture operates only
against the criminal and his heirs, not against re∣mainder-men.
But as in Scotch settlements, e∣very
person called to the succession is an heir;
the treason of a tenant in tail in Scotland, must
destroy the entail, root and branch. This ine∣quality
was perceived by the House of Lords,
and rectified by a judgement given on an appeal
from the court of session. The case was this.
Sir James Gordon of Park, <HI>anno</HI> 1713, execu∣ted
a procuratory for resigning his barony of
Park into the hands of his superior, for new in∣feftment
to himself, and after his decease, to
William Gordon his eldest son, and the heirs∣male
of his body; whom failing, to the heirs∣male
of Sir James's own body of his then pre∣sent
<PB N="369" REF="384"/>
marriage, or of any subsequent marriage;
with divers other substitutions. The usual pro∣hibitory
and irritant clauses are ingrossed, and
particularly an irritant clause upon committing
treason. A charter from the crown and seisin
proceeded upon this procuratory, in which these
clauses were also ingrossed. Upon the death of
Sir James, William his eldest son succeeded.
He was forfeited for his accession to the rebellion
1745; and the estate was seized for behoof of the
crown. As Sir William at that time had no
children, the estate was claimed by his brother
Captain John Gordon, as the next heir of entail.
It was judged here, “That Sir William Gor∣don,
the person attainted, being by the entail
disabled from aliening the estate, charging the
same with debt, or altering the course of suc∣cession
in prejudice of the claimant and the o∣ther
heirs of tailzie, or from otherwise hurt∣ing
or impairing their right to the said estate
after his death; therefore the barony of Park
is, by Sir William's attainder, forfeited, to
the crown during his life only; and that after
his decease, John Gordon, the claimant, hath
right to the said barony.” But the House of
Lords, on an appeal, were clear to reverse this
decree, and to find, That the estate, as forfeited,
did remain with the crown as long as any issue∣male
should exist of Sir William's body. At the
same time, it was considered, that according to
<PB N="370" REF="385"/>
the tenor of the settlement, Captain Gordon
would, by the law of England, not be an heir
of entail to his brother Sir William, but a re∣mainder-man,
having a separate estate in the
land, conditionally on the extinction of Sir Wil∣liam
and his issue-male; therefore “it was ad∣judged
and declared, That Sir William Gor∣don,
the person attainted, being, under the
settlement made by his father Sir James Gor∣don,
seised of an estate-tail in the barony of
Park; the said barony, notwithstanding the en∣tail
with prohibitive, irritant, and resolutive
clauses, did, by virtue of the statute 7̄0. <HI>Annae,</HI>
become forfeited to the crown by the said
Sir William Gordon's attainder, during his
life and the continuance of such issue-male of
his body as would have been inheritable to
the estate in case he had not been attainted;
and also such estate and interest as was ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed
in, or might have been claimed by, the said
Sir William Gordon, by virtue of the last li∣mitation
in the settlement to the heirs and as∣signees
whatsoever of the said Sir James Gor∣don,
after all the substitutions therein contain∣ed
shall be expired and determined: and that
by virtue of the substitution to the heirs-male
of the said Sir James Gordon's body of his
then present marriage, the respondent John
Gordon hath right to succeed to the said barony
of Park, after the death of the said Sir William
<PB N="371" REF="386"/>
Gordon, and failure of the issue-male of his
body, according to the limitations in the said
settlement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">21st May 1751.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>By this judgement a <HI>rëmainder</HI> with respect to
forfeiture is introduced into our law, hitherto un∣known
in Scotland. We must not however ima∣gine,
that this judgement proceeded from igno∣rance
of the law of Scotland. The innovation
was necessary, in order to make a perfect equali∣ty
between the two nations, with respect to the
punishment of treason. A remainder-man in
England is not hurt by the treason of the tenant
in tail; and in order to communicate that privi∣lege
to Scotland, it was necessary to hold Cap∣tain
Gordon to be a remainder-man. It cannot
but be acceptable to the reader to hear the emi∣nent
lawyer who presided in the House of Lords
at that time, giving his reasons in support of the
judgement. These are contained in a letter with
which he honoured the author of these Elucida∣tions;
and a copy of the letter, as far as relative
to the judgement, is added at the end; together
with a copy of Lord Chief Baron Parker's argu∣ment
with respect to this case; and the judge∣ment
of the House of Lords upon it.</P>
<P>It has been much controverted, whether in
the act 1685 prior entails be comprehended.
Had it been the opinion of the legislature, that
<PB N="372" REF="387"/>
entails are secure at common law, they certainly
would not have thought a statute necessary for se∣curing
an entailed estate against creditors and
purchasers. Now, supposing it to have been the
opinion of the legislature, that debts contracted
by a tenant in tail before 1685 were effectual a∣gainst
his estate, it would have been grossly un∣just
to withdraw from the creditors the chief fund
of payment, perhaps the only fund. The legis∣lature
could never intend to forfeit innocent cre∣ditors,
who lent their money on the faith that an
entail was no bar to their payment: every law∣yer
would have told them, that they were secure.
Hence it may fairly be concluded, that prior en∣tails
were left to stand or fall by their own merit;
and that there was no intention, in making the
act 1685, to wound creditors and purchasers at
that time existing. There is accordingly not a
single retrospective clause in the statute. It is
declared only, “That it shall be lawful to tailzie
lands and estates,” i. e. lawful in time coming.
I do not rigidly insist, that an entail, to have the
benefit of the statute, must be framed after it.
The court of session probably would make no
difficulty to interpose their authority to an entail
dated before the 1685, provided the prohibitive
and irritant clauses be ingrossed in the infeft∣ment;
and would sustain that entail upon being
recorded, as effectual by the statute; saving al∣ways
debts contracted and purchases made be∣fore
<PB N="373" REF="388"/>
recording. And this seems to have been
the sense of the House of Lords, in an appeal
between the Earl of Rothes and his creditors, de∣claring,
that entails prior to the 1685 ought to
be recorded according to the statute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">16th January 1761.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From general views we descend to the irritan∣cies
of the statute. In an entail before the 1685,
irritancies were necessary; because a prohibition
by a man against his heir, avails not at common
law, unless a penalty be annexed. But in a sta∣tutory
entail, I see no necessity or expedience for
irritating the right of a tenant in tail who aliens
or contracts debt, when without it the legal pro∣hibition
is effectual against all the world. For∣feitures
without necessity or expedience, are
highly repugnant to the mild laws that ought to
govern a free people; and therefore highly ab∣surd.
An alienation by a debtor inhibited, pro∣duces
no forfeiture: it is only declared ineffec∣tual
against the inhibiter. An alienation by a te∣nant
in tail, is equally ineffectual against his sub∣stitutes.
To afford them over and above a de∣clarator
of irritancy, is to favour an heir, who is
<HI>in lucro captando,</HI> more than an inhibiting cre∣ditor,
who is <HI>in damno vitando.</HI> Had this consi∣deration
occurred to the legislature, no counte∣nance,
I am persuaded, would have been given
to such an irritancy. But in the entails at that
<PB N="374" REF="389"/>
time existing, irritancies were common, because
they were necessary; and our legislature inad∣vertently
authorised them without necessity. It
deserves consideration, whether such irritancies
ought to have any support from the court of ses∣sion:
equity declares strongly against them.
May it not rationally be urged, That here the
words of the statute reach inadvertently beyond
intention, and that action ought not to be sustain∣ed
on words without intention?</P>
<P>There is one clause in the statute that de∣serves
particular animadversion. The words are,
“Which provisions and irritant clauses shall be
repeated in all the subsequent conveyances of
the said tailzied estate to any of the heirs of
tailzie; declaring, that the omission shall im∣port
a contravention of the irritant and reso∣lutive
clauses against the person and his heirs
who shall omit to insert the same; but shall
not militate against creditors and other singu∣lar
successors, who have contracted <HI>bona fide</HI>
with the person infeft without the said irritant
and resolutive clauses in the body of his right.”
A contravention or transgression of a prohibition,
is intelligible; but what sense is there in a con∣travention
or transgression of an irritant or resolu∣tive
clause? I have no excuse for such jargon,
but that the sword has always been a greater fa∣vourite
with my countrymen than the pen. A∣gain,
the omission, it is said, shall not militate a∣gainst
<PB N="375" REF="390"/>
creditors, &amp;c. Did it require a statute to
protect creditors against the omission of a tenant
in tail? Can an omission have any effect except
against the person who is guilty of it, or against
his representatives? One who favours entails,
will probably attempt to cut a Gordian knot that
he cannot untie: neglecting the words, he will
give a meaning to the clause, such as he thinks
it ought to have, that the omission shall be a for∣feiture
of the heir's right to the estate. But sup∣posing
this to be the meaning, will judges of e∣quity
take upon them to enforce a penalty
or forfeiture that is not expressed in the sta∣tute?
And if judges cannot interpose, here is
another safe method for defeating an entail: cre∣ditors
and purchasers are secure, if the irritancies
be not ingrossed in the infeftment; and the in∣tended
irritancy of the heir's right for his omis∣sion,
cannot be made effectual by a court of e∣quity;
which, in a matter of punishment, will
not venture to supply any defect in words. This
clause suggests another doubt. It is enacted, or
supposed to be enacted, That the heir who ne∣glects
to ingross the irritant clauses in his infeft∣ment,
shall forfeit for himself and his heirs.
What heirs? The words import his heirs of en∣tail;
and yet this sense would put an end to the
entail altogether, which surely was not intended.
But it avails not to examine critically a blunder∣ing
clause. Nothing else probably was intended,
<PB N="376" REF="391"/>
but to compel every heir to ingross in his infeft∣ment
the prohibitive and irritant clauses, by ma∣king
the omission a cause for forfeiting him and
the heirs of his body.</P>
<P>The clause under consideration is fruitful of
doubts. Is the irritancy mentioned in it effectual
by force of the statute, though not contained in
the entail? The words seem to favour the affir∣mative;
but are opposed by the following consi∣deration,
That it is not the intendment of the sta∣tute
to make an entail, but only to make entails
effectual <HI>secundum formam doni,</HI> or according
to the intention of the entailer. A man who, af∣ter
the date of the statute, makes an entail, knows,
that to secure the estate against creditors and
purchasers, the prohibitive and irritant clauses
must be ingrossed in the successive title-deeds.
He ought to provide accordingly by proper clau∣ses;
for if these be omitted, the presumption is,
that he intended to leave his heirs free. The
best interpreters of will are a man's actions: if
he do the thing, he must have willed it; if he
leave it undone, he probably did not will it. Let
it be supposed, that an entailer expressly relieves
his heirs from that solemnity: it will not be
thought, that the statutory irritancy must not∣withstanding
take effect; and does he not virtual∣ly
declare his heirs to be free, when he does not
bind them to use the solemnity? The statute
therefore is not to be understood literally, as re∣quiring
<PB N="377" REF="392"/>
quiring the heir under an irritancy to engross in
his infeftment the irritant and resolutive clauses;
but only as declaring, that if that solemnity be o∣mitted,
the ential shall not be effectual against
creditors or purchasers; leaving to entailers at
their pleasure to enjoin that solemnity or not.
Hence it may be held as undoubted law, that
the clause in question was contrived for the safe∣ty
of creditors and purchasers, not for benefiting
the substitutes.</P>
<P>Viewing the irritancies enacted in the statute, a
declarator with respect to some is made necessary:
others are appointed to take effect <HI>ipso facto</HI> with∣out
a declarator. But such difference of expres∣sion
in a statute eminently defective in composi∣tion,
ought not to be regarded; for the spirit of
the statute requires a declarator in every case.
The irritancy against the heir for omitting in his
infeftment the prohibitive and irritant clauses, is
declared “to have the effect of an <HI>ipso facto</HI> de∣volution
of the estate to the next heir of en∣tail.”
Let any man who is fond of this sta∣tute
say, whether such devolution be consistent
with what is declared in the same clause, viz.
That purchasers and creditors shall be secure.
To make the estate devolve <HI>ipso facto</HI> on the
next heir, is, in other words, to forfeit the heir
in possession the moment he takes infeftment
without ingrossing the prohibitive and irritant
clauses, and to annul his right to the estate. At
<PB N="378" REF="393"/>
that rate, every sale he makes is void, as flowing
<HI>a non habente potestatem:</HI> nor can his creditors
affect the entailed estate, which belongs not now
to him. How then can purchasers and creditors
be secure? It is a glaring inconsistency in the sta∣tute
to make the devolution take place <HI>ipso fac∣to</HI>
without a declarator. Till that declarator be
obtained, the heir continues proprietor; and his
deeds must operate against the estate, as declared
in the statute.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this subject more fully handled, Principles of E∣quity, edit. 2. p. 152.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Taking it now for granted, that a declarator
is necessary in every case, the question is, to
whom is it competent; whether to every substi∣tute,
or to the immediate substitute only. A de∣clarator
for annulling debts and deeds of a tenant
in tail, is by the statute given to the immediate
substitute, without mentioning any other. But
in this instance, the words of the statute are short
of the intendment. Every substitute is interested
to have the estate purged of such debts and
deeds as are prohibited by the entail; and an ac∣tion
ought of course to have been afforded to eve∣ry
substitute, for making his interest effectual.
But as none but the immediate substitute is men∣tioned,
the defect cannot be supplied even by a
court of equity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, English and Scotch entails
<PB N="379" REF="394"/>
differ widely from each other. The English sta∣tute
has broken through every legal obstruction
to make an entail impregnable. And as the sta∣tute
continues in force to this day, English entails
must have subsisted as long as the family, had
not their ruinous consequences encouraged jud∣ges
to plot their destruction. Our entails, on the
contrary, are so loosely guarded, that they may
be attacked with success from several quarters.
In the next place, English entails give opportu∣nity
for the most flagrant injustice, by want of
publication; the omission of which admits no ex∣cuse.
This defect is amply supplied by our sta∣tute:
the notifications required are so many and
various, as to afford little room for pleading ig∣norance.
Thirdly, English entails are of one
form, extremely simple. Our entails are ex∣tremely
complex, and of very different kinds:
in some, the heirs are strictly settered; in others,
less strictly: some contain prohibitions without
irritancies; nor has every entail the same irritan∣cies.
The statute 1685 has left these differences
to entailers: it is not the purpose of the statute,
to make an entail where the proprietor made
none; nor to add fetters to those contained in
the entail. Prohibitions against purchasers and
creditors bargaining with an heir infeft, are sup∣ported
by the statute: there it rests, and goes
not a single step farther.</P>
<P>In attempting a commentary on a statute so
<PB N="380" REF="395"/>
impolitic in its views, so crude in its conceptions,
and so imperfect in its language, it appeared to
me indispensable to shake off all bias from authori∣ty,
and to begin with extracting, if possible, the
true spirit and purpose of the statute; resolving
to take next under consideration, the opinions of
writers, and the decisions of our supreme court.
But upon discovering the former to be little a∣greeable,
in my apprehension, to the spirit of the
statute, and the latter to be far from uniform; I
stopt short, utterly at a loss how to proceed.
And now, after a long interval, I have come to
a resolution not to proceed. It afflicts me to va∣ry
from most respectable authorities; especially
as, in opposition to these, I have little expecta∣tion
that my notions will be relished. May I
venture only to hint, that from one who pores
days and nights on a subject, and who finds lei∣sure
for general views, a more correct system may
be expected, than from the decisions of a court
consisting of many members, who must attend to
a variety of causes almost at the same instant,
without having leisure to meditate deeply upon
every one; not to mention, that the nicest points
are not always explained to them by the most a∣cute
pleaders?</P>

<HEAD>Papers referred to in this article.</HEAD>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. Part of a letter from the Earl of Hardwicke
to the author.</HEAD>
<P>—That you should conceive some dissatis∣faction
at the judgement of the House of Lords,
in the case of Gordon of Park, gives me no sur∣prise.
Notwithstanding the part I had in that de∣cision,
and my thorough conviction of the justice
of it, founded upon the most mature deliberation,
I always feared that it would be of difficult di∣gestion
with the professors of the law of Scotland.
But I cannot sufficiently admire and applaud your
great candour in so readily owning a conversion,
which does much honour to that judgement, and
will, I doubt not, have great weight in removing
such doubts as may remain with any of your bre∣thren.</P>
<P>That you may the more clearly see the grounds
whereupon the House of Lords proceeded, I take
the liberty to inclose a copy of my Lord Chief
Baron Parker's argument in delivering the opi∣nion
of the judges in the House of Lords upon
the question proposed to them, together with a
copy of their Lordships order, taken from the
journal. I found some difficulty in stating my
question, so as to avoid making the English jud∣ges
judges of the Scotch law, (which would have
<PB N="382" REF="397"/>
been highly improper), and simply to refer to
them the main point arising upon the construction
of the act 7<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>Annae.</HI> For this reason I was for∣ced
to frame the question hypothetically, and to
insert two suppositions of points merely of your
law reserved for the determination of the House,
and which were determined by the opinion of the
Lords, given in the debate, after the judges had
been heard. All the Lords concurred, that by
the law of Scotland, an estate-tailzie, with prohi∣bitive,
irritant, and resolutive clauses, is an estate
of inheritance; and that by the same law no e∣state
or interest in the lands was vested in Sir
William Gordon by virtue of the limitation in
the settlement of 19th October 1713 to the heirs-male
of the body of Sir James Gordon; though
that would have been clearly otherwise by the
rules of the law of England.</P>
<P>Your discernment has already shown you, that
by this method, the question put to the English
judges was reduced, purely and simply, to the
construction of a statute of the parliament of
Great Britain, which it is equally the office of
the King's courts in both parts of the united
kingdom to expound; and every thing that could
make a point in the Scotch law, was kept apart
for the decision of the Lords, the proper judges
of it.</P>
<P>To repeat the several reasons of the judgement
in the cause of Park, would swell my letter too
<PB N="383" REF="398"/>
much. But I will just fling out to you two or
three ideas, which had weight with me, though
they do not fully appear in the opinion of the
judges.</P>
<P>1. My foundation was the express declaration
of the legislature in the preamble of the act
7<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>Annae,</HI> which is the basis of the subsequent en∣acting
clause, “That nothing can more conduce
to the improving the union of the two king∣doms,
than that the laws of both parts of
Great Britain should agree <HI>as near as may be,</HI>
especially those laws which relate to high trea∣son,
and the proceedings thereupon, as to
the nature of the crime, the method of pro∣ceeding
and trial, <HI>and also the forfeitures
and punishment for that offence,</HI> which are
of the greatest concern both to the crown and
to the subjects.”</P>
<P>2. The enacting clause relative to this subject,
is penned in words still more general; and there∣fore
the question must be a question of construc∣tion
and exposition; wherein, though the provi∣so
immediately following cannot extend or super-add
to the enacting clause, it must be allowed
to explain and illustrate and meaning of the
words.</P>
<P>3. That judges are obliged to make that con∣struction
which will best attain the declared in∣tent
of the legislators, provided the words of the
law will bear it; and therefore that such a con∣struction
<PB N="384" REF="399"/>
as would produce the greatest equality
between England and Scotland in forfeitures for
treason, must be the true construction.</P>
<P>4. In this I felt the force of the difficulty ari∣sing
from the difference between the nature of
your strict Scotch tailzies with substitutions, and
our English entails with remainders over, which
you have so clearly explained, viz. That in the
former every person called to the succession is
considered as an heir, and has the fee in him;
in the latter, the fee or estate in the land is bro∣ken
and divided into distinct parts. But then I
considered what was to be allowed as the conse∣quence
of this diversity between the two laws.
Was a tenant in tail, although admitted to have
an estate of inheritance descendible to his issue,
to forfeit only for his life? Or was every tenant
in tail, by reason of being invested in the ideal
fee, to forfeit not only for himself and his issue,
but also for all the substitutes?</P>
<P>Either of these would plainly destroy the equa∣lity
in forfeitures professed to be established by
the legislature, and not only contradict the in∣tent
of the act, but also the express words of the
preamble.</P>
<P>The knot lay here:—To avoid forfeiting the
whole fee; for as your law places that fee in e∣very
tenant in tail, and don't admit of a division
of it into particular estates and remainders, there
was more colour from legal reasoning to carry it
<PB N="385" REF="400"/>
to <HI>that large extent,</HI> than to make a man who
had a fee in him, to forfeit for his life only.</P>
<P>But I could not satisfy my own mind, that this
<HI>large extent</HI> was either agreeable to the inten∣tion
of the legislature, or a just and equitable mea∣sure
between the two nations.</P>
<P>5. How was this to be avoided? By expound∣ing
the act by <HI>analogy;</HI> and if you will apply
your usual penetration to this point, you will
find, that there is often no other possible way of
making a consistent sensible construction upon
statutes conceived in <HI>general words,</HI> which are
to have their operation upon the respective laws
of two countries, the rules and forms whereof
are different.</P>
<P>These general words will probably always be
taken from the language or style of one of these
countries more than from the other, and not
correspond equally with the genius or terms of
both laws. You must then, as in other sciences,
reason by <HI>analogy,</HI> or leave at least one half of
the statute without effect.</P>
<P>This head of argument from <HI>analogy</HI> is not
unknown in the law of England. It was long
since established, upon the statute, <HI>De donis con∣ditionalibus,</HI>
13<SUP>o</SUP> Ed. I. which enacts, That a
fine levied by tenant in tail shall be <HI>ipso jure
nullus.</HI> Stronger words could not be found, in
the concise words of those ancient laws, to ren∣der
such a fine an absolute nullity. But what said
<PB N="386" REF="401"/>
the judges when they came to construe this act?
They said, it should be construed by the reason
of the common law, (i. e. by <HI>analogy</HI> to that
law): That the question was, to create a disabili∣ty
in some persons to alien to the prejudice of o∣thers,
and the common law took notice of such
disabilities; and for that reason a tenant in tail
ought to be ranked with ecclesiastical persons sei∣sed
in right of their wives, who, by the common
law, were disabled to alien to the prejudice of
their successors or their wives: That therefore
the fine should not be a nullity, and merely void;
but should work a discontinuance, take away the
entry of the issue, and drive him to his proper
action to recover the land.</P>
<P>There are other instances of the like nature
in our law. But I am aware, that to these it may
be objected, That it was reasoning by <HI>analogy</HI>
from one part of the law of England to another
part of the law of the same country, which is
not the present case. I think that doth not
weaken the weight of the example; but I will
put a nearer case. In our English courts, wills
have frequently come in question, either made
by foreigners, or in parts beyond the seas, rela∣ting
to property proper in England, and expressed
in the language and terms of the law of some fo∣reign
country. In construing such wills, the
constant method has been, first, to enquire and
<PB N="387" REF="402"/>
settle what would be the operation and effect of
these terms according to the law of that country
from which the terms are taken; and, then, to
allow them the like effect here, as near as the
law of England will admit. It has seldom hap∣pened,
that this could be done precisely and spe∣cifically.
Some such difference has often appear∣ed
as exists in the present case, between our re∣mainders
and your substitutions; but the court
has always allowed these terms their force and
effect, as near as might be, in support of right,
<HI>ut res magis valeat quam pereat.</HI></P>
<P>The rules of construction upon acts of parlia∣ment,
are, in many respects, the same with those
upon wills; and by the construction made in the
case of <HI>Park,</HI> the words of the preamble of the
act 7<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>Annae,</HI> which is the key to the meaning
of the legislators, are strictly complied with, viz.
“That the laws of both parts of Great Britain
should (<HI>as to forfeitures for treason</HI>) agree
as near as may be.” And the world must al∣low,
that the favourable side for Scotland was
chosen.</P>
<P>But though by this decision the like force is
given to such substitutions in your tailzies as to
English remainders, yet they are by no means
turned into remainders to any other purpose, but
are to be governed by the rules of the law of
Scotland to every others effect; and therefore you
express yourself with strict propriety when you
<PB N="388" REF="403"/>
say, that <HI>by this judgement a remainder is in∣troduced
into our law with respect to forfei∣ture
only.</HI></P>
<P>As to the general mischief of your strict en∣tails,
and the evil consequences of locking up
the land of a country <HI>extra commercium,</HI> I have
long been convinced of them, and rejoice to find
a person of your knowledge and experience in
the law and constitution of Scotland in the same
way of thinking. It gives me the better hopes,
that it will not be long before some proper re∣medy
is applied; but the discussion of that sub∣ject,
being political as well as legal, would add
too much to the tediousness of a letter which
already stands in need of great excuse. I am, &amp;c.</P>

case of Gordon of Park.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lord Advocate for Scotland Appellant,
John Gordon, Es{que} Respondent.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT common law, estates in fee-simple, whe∣ther
absolute or conditional, were forfeit∣ed
for treason.</P>
<P>By the statute of the 13th Ed. I. (commonly
called the statute <HI>De donis</HI>), the forfeiture of
<PB N="389" REF="404"/>
lands entailed, even in case of treason, was taken
away; the reason of which will be best collected
from the words of the statute.</P>
<P>“Quod voluntas donatoris, secundum formam
in charta doni sui, de cetero observetur; ita
quod non habeant illi, quibus tenementum sic
fuerit datum sub conditione, potestatem alie∣nandi
tenementum sic datum, quo minus ad
exitum illorum quibus tenementum sic fuerit
datum, remaneat post eorum obitum, vel ad
donatorem, vel ad ejus heredem, (si exitus de∣ficiat),
revertatur.”</P>
<P>Therefore, my Lords, the will of the donor,
according to the form expressed in the deed
of gift, was to be observed; so that they to
whom the land was given under such conditions,
should have no power to alien it, but that it
should remain to their issue after their death,
or should revert to the donor for want of issue.</P>
<P>By the express words of the statute they could
not alien, by construction they could not forfeit
or charge; and the express and constructive re∣straints
stood upon one and the same reason,
which was, That either alienation, forfeiture,
or charge, was inconsistent with, and would
have defeated the provision and intent of the sta∣tute.</P>
<P>And the reason given by the counsel for the
respondents in the original appeal, That entailed
lands were not forfeitable for treason, because
<PB N="390" REF="405"/>
they were unalienable, is not well founded; be∣cause
they were alienable when they were not
forfeitable for treason.</P>
<P>For notwithstanding the strong words in the
statute <HI>De donis,</HI> in Taltarum's case, in the
12th Ed. IV. an alienation of entailed lands by
a common recovery, obtained judicial allowance,
and has been so practised ever since; and by the
4th Henry VII. they might be aliened by fine
with proclamations; and yet the statute <HI>De donis</HI>
protected them from forfeiture for treason, till
the making of the statute of the 26th Henry VIII.
cap. 13.</P>
<P>By that statute, lands entailed became forfeited
for treason, under these words, <HI>all such lands,
tenements, and hereditaments, which any such
offender shall have of any estate of inheritance;</HI>
and the reason was, because this statute, being
subsequent to the statute <HI>De donis,</HI> repealed it
in this case: and the construction, that these
words should operate upon entails, was extreme∣ly
right, as they otherwise could have no opera∣tion
at all, because all other estates of inheritance
(as I have shown already) were forfeited for trea∣son
by the common law.</P>
<P>I will now show your Lordships, that entailed
lands, though unalienable beyond all question,
were yet forfeited to the crown for treason.</P>
<P>If the King made a gift in tail, saving the re∣version
to himself, the attainder of treason of
<PB N="391" REF="406"/>
such tenant in tail did not bar his issue; because
the statute of the 34th Henry VIII. cap. 20. en∣acts,
That the heir in tail in such case shall
have the lands; any recovery, or any other
thing or things hereafter to be had, done, or
suffered, by or against such tenant in tail, to the
contrary notwithstanding.</P>
<P>Which act coming after the 26th Henry VIII.
that gave the forfeiture of lands entailed, was a
repeal of that statute, and a restitution of the sta∣tute
<HI>De donis</HI> in this special case.</P>
<P>But the statute of the 5th and 6th Ed. VI.
cap. 11. enacts, That every offender, being law∣fully
convicted of any manner of high treason,
according to the course and custom of the com∣mon
law, shall lose and forfeit to the King's High∣ness,
his heirs and successors, all such lands, te∣nements,
and hereditaments, which any such of∣fender
or offenders shall have of any estate of
inheritance in his own right, in use or possession,
within this realm of England, or elsewhere with∣in
the King's dominions, at the time of such
treason committed, or at any time after.</P>
<P>This act coming after 34th Henry VIII. has
repealed it <HI>pro tanto,</HI> and made lands of the
gift of the crown in tail, subject to forfeiture for
treason, as well as other lands entailed.</P>
<P>This has been taken to be law from the time
of making the act; and there is no colour for
the observation made at the bar, That it depend∣ed
<PB N="392" REF="407"/>
singly on Lord Hales's opinion; though, if
it had done so, the authority would have been
very great.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the most material act for your
Lordships consideration on this occasion, the act
of the 7th of Queen Anne, cap. 21. for impro∣ving
the union of the two kingdoms.</P>
<P>This act recites the benefit that would accrue
to the united kingdom from the provisions of it.</P>
<P>Enacts, That such crimes and offences which
are high treason or misprision of high treason
within England, shall be the same in Scotland,
and no other.</P>
<P>And that offenders shall be indicted and tried
in the same manner as in England; and that all
persons convicted or attainted of high treason or
misprision of high treason in Scotland, shall be
subject and liable to the same corruption of blood,
pains, penalties, and <HI>forfeitures,</HI> as persons con∣victed
or attainted of high treason, or misprision
of high treason, in England: Provided always,
that where any person now is, or shall be before
the 1st of July 1709, seised of any lands, &amp;c.
in Scotland of an estate-tail, that is to say, an
estate-tailzie affected with irritant and resolutive
or prohibitive clauses, and is, or before the 1st
day of July shall be married, if any issue of that
marriage be living, or there be possibility of such
issue at the time of the high treason committed;
that then, and in such case, the said lands, &amp;c.
<PB N="393" REF="408"/>
shall not be forfeited upon the attainder of such
person for high treason, but during the life of
the person so attainted only; so that the issue and
heirs in tail of such marriage shall inherit the
same, the said attainder notwithstanding.</P>
<P>This act, by reference, re-enacted, and extend∣ed
to Scotland, all the laws of England concern∣ing
treason which were then in force, as strong∣ly
and effectually as if they had been transcri∣bed
into the body of it; and as, at the time of
making the act, all estates of inheritance were
and still are forfeited for treason, we think, upon
the supposition in your question, that an estate-tailzie,
with prohibitive, irritant, and resolutive
clauses, is an estate of inheritance, and that such
an estate of inheritance is forfeited; for otherwise
the forfeitures in England and Scotland would
not be the same, though the act expressly requires
they should be so.</P>
<P>But it was objected by the learned counsel for
the respondent, That by the Scotch act of 1685,
estates-tailzie, with prohibitive, irritant, and reso∣lutive
clauses, were unalienable; and by the
Scotch act of 1690, it is provided, That no for∣feiture
should prejudge the heirs of entail therein
mentioned, provided the right of entail was du∣ly
registered; from whence it was inferred, that
Sir William Gordon could only forfeit for his life.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, we are humbly of opinion,
that the act 7<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>Annae,</HI> being subsequent to these
<PB N="394" REF="409"/>
Scotch acts, has repealed them <HI>pro tanto,</HI> in the
same manner as the 5th and 6th of Ed. VI. re∣pealed
34th Henry VIII. which made lands of
the gift of the crown in tail unalienable; and
that this estate-tailzie is therefore subjected to for∣feiture,
that the forfeitures throughout the uni∣ted
kingdom may be the same.</P>
<P>But it was objected by one of the learned gen∣tlemen,
That the third clause, which gives the for∣feiture,
would not have induced a forfeiture of
this estate-tailzie, without the aid of the proviso;
and that the proviso, which only imports and ex∣ception,
ought not to extend the construction of
the foregoing clause.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, we are humbly of opinion,
that the clause which gives the forfeiture, would
have induced a forfeiture of this estate-tailzie
though the proviso had been omitted out of the
act; and we agree, that the proviso ought not
to extend the construction of the foregoing
clause.</P>
<P>But as the proviso is in the act, and the re∣spondent's
case is not the case described in the
proviso, <HI>Exceptio firmat regulam in casibus non
exceptis,</HI> and greatly strengthens the construc∣tion
we put upon the act.</P>
<P>As to the reversion in fee, or clause of return,
supposing that by the law of Scotland it was in
Sir William Gordon at the time of his attainder,
we think that to be so clearly forfeited, that it
<PB N="395" REF="410"/>
would be wasting your Lordships time to attempt
to prove it.</P>
<P>But as to the substitution or limitation to the
heirs-male of Sir James Gordon, and the inter∣mediate
substitutions or limitations between that
and the reversion in fee, upon the supposition in
your Lordships question, that no estate or inte∣rest
was thereby vested in Sir William Gordon,
we are humbly of opinion, that no estate or in∣terest
derived under any of these intermediate
substitutions or limitations is forfeited to the
crown by the attainder of Sir William Gordon;
because the substitutes claim as persons described,
and their estate or interest successively is to be
considered as a new acquisition, which can be no
more forfeited by the attainder of Sir William
Gordon, than a remainder limited after an estate-tail
in England can be forfeited by the attainder
of the tenant in tail for treason.</P>
<P>Besides, there is a saving in the act of 26th
Henry VIII. to all persons, (other than the offend∣ers,
their heirs and successors, and such persons
as claim to any of their uses) of all such <HI>right,</HI>
title interest, &amp;c. as they might have had if the
act had not been made.</P>
<P>And in the vesting act of the 20th of his Ma∣jesty's
reign, there is a saving to all persons (ex∣cept
the forfeiting persons, their heirs, executors,
administrators, and assigns, and persons claiming
to their use, or in trust for them) of their estate,
<PB N="396" REF="411"/>
right, title, interest, use, trust, possession, rever∣sion,
remainder, and so on.</P>
<P>And we are humbly of opinion, that the saving
words in these acts, and particularly the word
<HI>right,</HI> are sufficient to preserve the several estates
or interests of the substitutes in this settlement
from forfeiture.</P>

<HEAD>3. Judgement of the House of Lords in the
case of Gordon of Park.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Die Martis 21<SUP>0</SUP> Maii 1751.</HEAD>
<P>THE order of the day being read, for taking
into further consideration the cause upon the
original appeal of his Majesty's Advocate for Scot∣land,
on behalf of his Majesty, complaining of the
former part of an interlocutor of the Lords of Ses∣sion
in Scotland of the 16th of November 1750,
to which appeal John Gordon Esq, second son of
Sir James Gordon of Park deceased, is respon∣dent;
as likewise of the cross appeal of the said
John Gordon, complaining of the latter part of
the said interlocutor, to which appeal his Maje∣sty's
said Advocate is respondent; and for the
judges to deliver their opinion upon the follow∣ing
question, (viz.), “Supposing, that, by the
law of Scotland, an estate-tailzie, with prohi∣bitive,
irritant, and resolutive clauses, is an e∣state
of inheritance; and supposing also, that,
<PB N="397" REF="412"/>
by the law of Scotland, no estate or interest
was vested in Sir William Gordon by virtue of
the limitations in the settlement of the 19th
October 1713, to the heirs-male of the body
of Sir James Gordon; what estate or interest
in the barony and lands in question was for∣feited
to the crown, under the limitations of the
said settlement, by the attainder of Sir Wil∣liam
Gordon?” Whereupon</P>
<P>The Lord Chief Baron of the court of Exche∣quer
accordingly delivered the unanimous opinion
of the judges as follows, (viz.), “That the estate
and interest in the barony and lands in que∣stion,
which was forfeited to the crown, under
the limitations of the said settlement, by the
attainder of Sir William Gordon, was not on∣ly
during the life of Sir William Gordon,
but so long as there shall be any issue-male of
his body which would be inheritable to the
estate-tailzie in case he had not been attainted;
and that the reversionary interest in the fee
thereof, limited by the settlement to the heirs
and assigns whatsoever of Sir James Gordon,
on failure of the heirs-male of the body of the
said Sir James Gordon, and the determination
of the several estates by the other substitutions
therein contained, was also forfeited; suppo∣sing
that, by the law of Scotland, such rever∣sionary
interest was in Sir William Gordon at
the time of his attainder.”</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="413"/>
And after debate, and due consideration had of
what was offered by the counsel on both sides in this
cause at the bar on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs∣day
last, it is ordered and adjudged by the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled,
That the first part of the said interlocutor, where∣by
the Lords of Session found, “That Sir Wil∣liam
Gordon, the person attainted, being, by
the entail, disabled from alienating the estate,
charging the same with debts, or altering the
course of succession, in prejudice of the claim∣ant,
and the other heirs of tailzie; or from o∣therwise
hurting or impairing their right or title
to the said estate after his death, in any man∣ner
of way whatsoever; that therefore the e∣state
and barony of Park is, by Sir William's
attainder, forfeited to the crown only during
his life; and find, That the said John Gordon
the claimant hath right to the said estate and
barony of Park after the death of the said Sir
William Gordon,” be, and the same is here∣by
reversed. And it is further ordered and ad∣judged,
That the latter part of the said interlo∣cutor,
whereby the Lords of Session found, “That
the irritancy alledged to be incurred by Sir
William Gordon, the attainted person, not
having been declared, nor no advantage taken
of it before the forfeiture, the forfeiture can∣not
be over-reached or excluded on pretence
of that irritancy,” be, and the same is hereby
<PB N="399" REF="414"/>
affirmed. And it is also hereby declared and ad∣judged,
That Sir William Gordon, the person
attainted, being under the settlement made by his
father Sir James Gordon, dated the 19th of Oc∣tober
1713, seised of an estate-tailzie in the baro∣ny
and estate of Park, notwithstanding such tail∣zie
was affected with prohibitive, irritant, and re∣solutive
clauses, the said barony and estate of
Park did, by virtue of the statute of the seventh
year of the reign of Queen Anne, chap. 21. be∣come
forfeited to the crown, by the said Sir Wil∣liam
Gordon's attainder, during his life, and the
continuance of such issue-male of his body as
would have been inheritable to the said estate-tailzie
in case he had not been attainted; and al∣so
for such estate and interest as was vested in, or
might have been claimed by, the said Sir William
Gordon, by virtue of the last limitation in the
said settlement to the heirs and assignees whatso∣ever
of the said Sir James Gordon, after all the
substitutions therein contained shall be expired or
determined: And that, by virtue of the substitu∣tion
to the heirs-male of the said Sir James Gor∣don's
body of his then present marriage, the re∣spondent
John Gordon hath right to succeed to
the said barony and estate of Park after the death
of the said Sir William Gordon, and failure of
such issue-male of his body as aforesaid, accor∣ding
to the limitations in the said settlement. And
it is further ordered, That liberty be reserved to
<PB N="400" REF="415"/>
the crown, and also to the said John Gordon,
and any other person who may become intitled to
the said barony and estate of Park by virtue of
any of the said substitutions, to apply to the court
of session for such further order or direction in the
premisses, as shall be just, as often as any new
right shall accrue to them respectively in conse∣quence
of any of the substitutions or limitations
in the said settlement.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Regulations of the commissioners for ad∣ministration
of justice in the years 1652
and 1654.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarkable, that any important object
which concerns the whole society, such as, a
struggle for liberty, or for religion, never fails to
raise a patriotic spirit, which spreads itself upon
every interesting subject. During the civil war
in the reign of Charles I. many improvements in
law were introduced into Scotland, by parlia∣ments
held without authority from the sovereign.
At the restoration, these parliaments were decla∣red
illegal, and their proceedings annulled by the
lump. Many acts, however, of these illegal par∣liaments,
were of too great importance to be sup∣pressed:
they were adopted after the restoration
and made part of our law. From the same spirit
of patriotism, many salutary regulations were also
introduced by the high court of justice, acting by
<PB N="402" REF="417"/>
the authority of Oliver Cromwell; some of which
were moulded into acts of parliament at different
times after the restoration. But the whole de∣serve
to be kept in memory, as making so many
links in the history of our law. Some of them
have been mentioned formerly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">British Antiquities, essay 4. part. 2.; Article 35. of the present work.</NOTE>. Others fol∣low.</P>
<P>Regulations concerning the abridging expence
or trouble in matters of law, shall take the lead.
Originally, a precept of seisin was contained in a
writing different from the charter; which multi∣plied
title-deeds, beside swelling the expence.
Therefore, in the regulations 1652 it is enacted,
“That all charters whereupon seisin is to follow,
shall contain precepts of seisin ingrossed, or on
the back thereof.” This regulation is copied
in the act 7. parl. 1672, so far as to “discharge
the passing or writing of any precept of seisin to
or under the quarter-seal; and ordaining, that
in lieu thereof, every charter shall towards the
end contain a precept of seisin of all the
lands.” And this act was extended in practice
to charters from subjects. In the regulations 1654
enacted, “That every decreet to be pronounced
by the sheriff or commissary, shall contain in
the close thereof these words, <HI>Ordains execu∣tion
to pass hereupon in due and competent
<PB N="403" REF="418"/>
form, after the charge hereby warranted to
be given is orderly given and expired.</HI> Which
is hereby declared to be as valid and effectual
as precepts formerly were; and that all execu∣tion
shall follow accordingly. Wherefore there
shall be no precepts hereafter given out nor ex∣tracted
to any party upon their decreet, but
allenarly the decreet itself.” As this salutary
regulation was put in practice during the usurpa∣tion,
the general interest has kept it in force to this
day; for it never received the sanction of an act
of parliament. In the same view, the following
article is contained in the regulations 1654:
“That licences be granted both before and after
confirmation <HI>excludendo sententiam,</HI> upon
consignation of half of the ordinary price of
confirmation for the sums contained in the li∣cence,
which shall be allowed at confirmation;
these licences to be recorded for the use of all
parties having interest.” It was a barbarous
practice, to debar a party from insisting upon a
doubtful claim, till he should purchase the privi∣lege
from the commissary. The high court of
justice was sensible that a remedy was necessary;
but their regulation, like other reformations in
law, is imperfect. For why pay the half of the
ordinary dues for confirming a doubtful claim
that may produce nothing to the pursuer but
trouble and expence? But the commissaries,
whose interest it is to facilitate suits of this kind,
<PB N="404" REF="419"/>
completed the remedy, by granting licences with∣out
payment of any part of the dues of confirma∣tion,
reserving to draw the full dues in case of
success. I add one instance more. As the dues
of the privy seal are much higher than those of the
signet, there is in the regulations 1652 and order,
“That writs heretofore wrote by the writers to
the privy seal, shall and may hereafter be writ∣ten
by writers to the signet.” This made
law, while the high court of justice subsisted:
the practice was kept in force after the restora∣tion,
by tacit consent of the nation; and the
writers to the privy seal had not sufficient autho∣rity
to stand in opposition. With the same spirit
of frugality, summons of error were appointed
to be drawn in English, by the writers to the sig∣net;
and to pass the signet as an ordinary sum∣mons,
without passing any other seal.</P>
<P>This court was equally solicitous to abridge the
tedious delay of bringing defendants into court.
By the regulations 1652, summons of improba∣tion
are appointed to be executed on twenty-one
days; and summons of exhibition, on six days,
omitting the alternative in the old style. Such re∣gulations
cannot be effectual against defendants,
but by force of law. The court of session renew∣ed
both by act of sederunt 29th June 1672.</P>
<P>The commissioners went still further in abrid∣ging
judicial proceedings. In all processes of old,
it was necessary to summon the defendant four
<PB N="405" REF="420"/>
different times before he was bound to appear.
These summons were reduced to three, as ap∣pears
from parl. 1449, cap. 30.; and afterward
to two. This was made still more easy by the re∣gulations
1652, enacting, “That there be no con∣tinuation
of the principal summons bear
two diets of compearance; to both which
diets the defender may be summoned by a she∣riff
in that part, albeit the summons for the se∣cond
diet be directed to messengers at arms;
except where the pursuer intends to refer the
libel to the oath of party; in which case,
the second citation to be given by a messenger
at arms.” This regulation, which fell to the
ground upon the restoration, was renewed in the
6th act, parl. 1672; and improved by act
12th, parl. 1693, authorising one citation for both
diets of compearance. Here all summons before
the court of session are reduced to a single cita∣tion;
and yet, such is the influence of custom,
that the two diets of compearance are kept up in
words, though abolished in reality.</P>
<P>In the same regulations it is enacted, “That
there be only one term granted for probation
by witnesses, of libel, exception, or reply:
And that there be only two diligences granted
against the witnesses cited to that term; the
first to bear certification, that if they compear
not, certification shall be directed against them;
<PB N="406" REF="421"/>
and the second to bear caption, with a penal∣ty
<HI>ad arbitrium judicis.</HI>” This regulation is
also renewed parl. 1672, act 16.</P>
<P>Active and passive transferences did of old oc∣casion
both expence and delay. It crept into
our practice from the Roman law, that a repre∣sentative
could not even carry on a process com∣menced
by his predecessor, without entering heir
to it. This produced an active transference;
which is, a sentence by a judge transferring the
process from the deceased to his heir. In the li∣bel,
and decreet of transference, the original pro∣cess
was <HI>verbatim</HI> ingrossed. This Lord Stair
complains of as an imposition on the lieges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Institutes, book 4. tit. 34.</NOTE>;
and says, that it is now well altered, the process
being only expressed by a breviate. But he does
not say, that this was owing to the high court
of justice ordaining, in their regulations 1652,
“That in summons of transferring there be no
necessity to ingross <HI>ad longum</HI> the bonds, con∣tracts,
decreets, and others to be transferred,
but only to express the date and substance
thereof in a summary way.” There could be
but one further improvement of an active trans∣ference;
which is, to intitle the heir to carry on
the process without it; which was done, parl.
1693, act 15.</P>
<P>When the defendant in a process died, a de∣cree
<PB N="407" REF="422"/>
was also thought necessary transferring the
process against his representatives. And this was
termed a transference <HI>passivè.</HI> This form was
thought unnecessary by the high court of justice.
It is enacted in the regulations 1652, “That there
be no necessity of summons of transferring of
process; but that a wakening be raised, con∣cluding
against the defenders upon the passive
titles.” <HI>N. B.</HI> A wakening is necessary, be∣cause
an heir has a year to deliberate. This was
reducing the matter to its simplest form, so as
to need no further improvement. And a trans∣ference
<HI>passivè,</HI> according to the form then used,
was confirmed by the said act 15. parl. 1693.</P>
<P>A very irregular practice having crept in, of
poinding on decrees and registrate bonds, with∣out
giving a debtor time to prepar for payment;
“by which,” says Sir George Mackenzie, “no∣blemen
and persons of quality were oft times
affronted, and merchants ruined;” this prac∣tice
was corrected by the high court of justice,
enacting in their regulations 1654, “That no
poinding be used upon any decreet till the par∣ty
be charged upon fifteen days on ordinary
decreets, or upon the days contained in the
clause of registration in writs; and until the
said days be expired.” This regulation was
renewed parl. 1669, act 4.</P>
<P>While writing was rare, several judicial acts
were sustained without being tested; which bred
<PB N="408" REF="423"/>
confusion, and frequently made a proof by wit∣nesses
necessary. To remedy that evil, it was
appointed in the regulations 1652, “That all ex∣ecutions
of summons and letters be subscribed
by the parties executors, conform to act 141.
parl. 1592.” And in the regulations 1654,
“That he who is to be cautioner in the testament
be made to subscribe the act of cautionry,
either with his own hand, or by notars before
witnesses; otherwise that the same shall make
no faith.” This regulation is of such a nature
as to be kept in force by the interest that par∣ties
have in it; without necessity of being re∣newed
by an act of parliament.</P>
<P>The commissioners were no less solicitous to
mitigate severe penalties; such especially as the
nature of the offence cannot justify. Vitious in∣tromission
is a flagrant instance: the man who
intermeddles irregularly with moveables that be∣longed
to a person deceased, is subjected to that
person's whole debts, without regard to their ex∣tent.
Our authors do not say how that barba∣rous
practice was introduced; and we must be
satisfied with a conjecture. <HI>Gestio pro herede</HI> is
a passive title early adopted by us from the Ro∣man
law. An heir cannot justly be bound for
his predecessor's debts without his consent. But
that consent requires not a formal writing: it is
sufficient to infer consent, that he behaves as heir,
and lays hold of his predecessor's effects. The
<PB N="409" REF="424"/>
case of a stranger who purloins the moveables of
a person deceased, without pretending to have
any right, differs widely from the <HI>gestio pro he∣rede,</HI>
which is an indication of the heir's will to
represent his predecessor, and is in no degree pe∣nal.
And yet a circumstance common to both,
viz. That the effects intermeddled with belonged
to a deceased person, has unwarily led our forefa∣thers
to consider vitious intromission as a sort of
<HI>gestio pro herede.</HI> The penalty of vitious in∣tromission
cannot possibly have another foun∣dation:
and to put the matter past doubt, vi∣tious
intromission is handled as one of the pas∣sive
titles, by Lord Stair, and by every wri∣ter
after him. This shows in our forefathers
great cloudiness in conceptions of law; consider∣ing
especially a regulation in the Roman law
strictly apposite to this case. The person who
purloined any moveables in the calamity of a
conflagration or of a shipwreck, was made liable
in double: what pretext could there be for pu∣nishing
more severely the delict under considera∣tion?
The penalty here, at the same time, may
be very great or very small; and a penalty of
that kind always gives hope of impunity. If the
person died <HI>obaeratus,</HI> vitious intromission may be
a total forfeiture. If, on the other hand, the
person left sufficient to pay his debts, vitious in∣tromission
will not even infer the double; for
the intermeddler, who is compelled to pay the
debts, is entitled to be relieved by the heir or
<PB N="410" REF="425"/>
executor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Craig, lib. 2. dieg. 17. sect. 16.</NOTE>. If the person deceased had no debts
at all, the vitious intromitter runs no risk but
simply of restitution. In days of ignorance, I am
not surprised at crude and indistinct notions of
law. But I am surprised, that vitious intromis∣sion
should have subsisted in vigour, perhaps
two centuries, without ever having been found
fault with before the time of Cromwell's judges.
They saw through the thin veil of a passive title;
and in their regulations 1654, article 12. they
enact, “That the certification of all vitious in∣tromission
shall be no farther extended than
for what the double value thereof shall be pro∣ven
to extend to.” And what greatly surpri∣ses
me is, that even after this regulation, the veil
remained still impenetrable by the judges who suc∣ceeded.
The regulation, however just and pro∣per,
could not be supported but by legal authori∣ty.
People are more swayed by interest than
by moderation; and creditors are commonly in∣tent
to have their claims made effectual, by
whatever means. Vitious intromission, accor∣dingly,
after the restoration, was held to be a
passive title as originally. And it continued in
force till it was undermined by our present mild
manners; moderation prevailing among our
judges, and regularity among our people. At
present, it is never heard of in a court of justice,
more than if it did not make a branch of our
municipal law.</P>
