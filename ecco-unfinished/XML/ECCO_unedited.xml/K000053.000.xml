<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>TIS love, Jeffery—I have an intrigue here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jeff.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>An intrigue!—with whom sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>With pretty Mrs. Brittle, the glassman's wife, the landlord of yonder house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jeff.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Give you good fortune, sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Damaris, her chambermaid, I have al∣ready won, who gives me all the encouragement I can wish for: she says, the husband's jealous to distraction, and that his wife loves company and courtship most extremely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jeff.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have ground enough to work on, I think, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have a letter ready, which I must get conveyed to Damaris; she'll give it to her mistress, and send me an answer instantly:—thou can'st con∣vey it very privately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jeff.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think this life will last for ever, sir? shall no condition 'scape you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Good wise Jeffery, spare your counsel and deliver my letter for me—Take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jeff.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do not trust me, sir; I say do not trust me. I have a very squeamish stomach, and I shall spoil this business; therefore do not trust me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>What ails the fellow,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jeff.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have a mind to marry, myself, and have no mind to be a cuckold, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, thou a cuckold, fool?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jeff.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If I carry this letter, sir, and you dishon∣our this honest citizen, then I am partly the occa∣sion on't; and ought not I in conscience to expect the same return when I am marry'd, sir? If I, by accident, should see a brisk young gallant with my wife, I should presently conclude that he has done the same for me; therefore, I say again, do not trust me.
<STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Jeffery.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What's to be done now? Which way shall I get this letter convey'd to Damaris? Eh! is not that Clodpole, my tenant?—Egad a lucky thought; he's a simple, honest fellow, and will be glad to serve me.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Clodpole.</STAGE>
<P>He shall do it.—Ha! Clodpole, how dost thou?</P>

<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clod.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know, sir, I came only to see a sweetheart of mine, one Damaris, that lives there at that house, whom I have had a kindness for some time; but she's plaguy cross and ill-natur'd to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And does she live there, at that house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clod.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then, honest Clodpole, I must beg you to do me a small kindness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clod.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That I will, measter—what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Only to deliver this letter to Damaris your mistress—she knows what to do with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clod.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Troth will I, and that dirctly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But be sure to keep this secret, and don't let any one know you have brought any letter or message from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clod.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O measter, never fear Clodpole. Icod I'm no fool—they must be develish cunning that gets any thing out of me—I can tell un that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lovem.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go then—and if you perform this discreetly, I shall leave a couple of guineas with my servant for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clod.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you kindly, measter: I warrant you. Icod, this is a good morning's work.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Brit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>These gallants flock about my house that it is grown as common as the Exchange or the Playhouses, where all sorts of company meet to laugh and talk nonsense; it makes me mad, stark mad, to think on't: I must marry a gentlewoman, with a murrain to me; and fill my house with her proud,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
vain kindred. Well, Barnaby Brittle, you have nobody to thank but yourself for this: you must marry above your quality, and now you see the effect on't.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Mrs. Brittle.</STAGE>
<P>How now, wife, whither away so fast?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Wife.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am going to Ranelagh Gardens with my cousin Philadelphia.</P>

<P>To Ranelagh Gardens!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Wife.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and thence to the play, where we shall have such sport!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Brit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How! Sport! Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Wife</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the pleansantest thing in the whole world, to have a flock of wild gallants fluttering about two or three ladies. 'Tis a better entertain∣ment than any part of the play can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Brit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray stay a little; why, now, is this a dress for Barnaby Brittle's wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Wife.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: but 'tis a dress for a gentlewoman, for Sir Peter Pride's daughhter, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Brit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O citizens! citizens! How are the times alter'd since your wives wore high crown'd hats, Farendin gowns, red cloth petticoats, good leather shoes, and troop'd the streets in pattens!—Now your feet must be furnish'd at one pound one a pair. Your silks must be bought in Pall-Mall: Ludgate Hill, and the Minories have no choice. Well may we decay when our wives, like French mistresses, send our money abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Wife.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If the times are alter'd with the wives, so they are with the husbands, since they wore their own thin lank hair, that look'd like the fringe of a blanket, or the strings of a bunch of leeks: you can now wear the best and richest cloaths. The times
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
are chang'd since I was married too; did not you promise me that I shou'd keep my coach, and live like what I was.</P>

<P>The best of quality—but that my parents preferr'd you.—You said you were able to keep a coach, and you wou'd do it, that I might outshine the best of all the city.—Every tradesman keeps his wife a carriage even tho' he break at the year's end for't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Brit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No coach—exercise is wholeseme—ever go on foot, wife</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Wife.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Pestle the apothecary keeps his wife a coach, and is not worth half so much as you are; besides hav'nt you fin'd for alderman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Brit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and if I had not fin'd for fool, in giving your relations a thousand pounds, you might have had a coach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Wife.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well let me have it and I'll save it in other things. I'll catch cold else every winter, and it shall cost you more in slops; but I must not stay any longer, my cousin waits.

<SPEAKER><HI>Wife.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do your worst, I defy you: I am a gen∣tlewoman on both sides, by my father and mother, and shall I suffer an under citizen, a pitiful glassman, to make a slave of me? I might have wedded a nobleman, and have mov'd in my proper sphere: and did I lose this and marry a sneaking glassman that will not allow me christian liberty? My comfort is I have parents who will not see me wrong'd—I'll send for them directly, and let them know how I am used by you.

<P>What shall I do?—I shall be damnably tor∣mented with this father and mother of her's— Well, gentlefolks of birth and quality, may be fine people for ought I know; but I wish it had been high treason to marry any body but one another:— My own house is a hell to me; I never come home, but the Devil, in the shape of some vexation or other, is got hither before me—Why, look, there he is now.</P>
