<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE seemingly whimsical Name in the Title Page of this Poem may with good Reason make the Reader curious to know, on what account We take it upon us: Which We intend to do with all the Brevity that's pos∣sible.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>The OLD THREE (call'd so from their coming into the World together at a Birth) are the Sons of <HI>Gregory Pickle,</HI> Yeoman of <HI>Taun∣ton</HI> in <HI>Somerset-Shire;</HI> and were born <HI>Oct. 14th. 1688.</HI> Our Mo∣ther, who was the only Daughter of <HI>Abraham Muzzer,</HI> an eminent Bar∣ber in those Parts, dy'd in Child-bed of us. Our Father was soon after unfortunately crushed to pieces in Har∣vest-time, by the overturning of his own Waggon: and leaving us very Young, and without any Thing to subsist upon, We became a Burthen to the Parish. But after some Time, a worthy Neighbouring Gentleman; who shall be nameless, and whom We desire to accept of this small publick Acknowledgment for all his Favours,
<PB REF="4"/>
compassionated our Condition, and very hospitably receiv'd us into his Family. When we were about Ten Years of Age, he sent us all <HI>Three</HI> to an eminent School in <HI>London;</HI> where (in our own Opinion) we soon made a great Proficiency in Classical Learning: and being puff'd up with Youthful Vanity, we resolv'd to leave School, and seek our Fortunes; which accordingly We did, <HI>Nov. 26, 1706.</HI> About this Time, after a long and warm Controversy between our selves, and one <HI>Aminadab Zeal,</HI> an eminent Teacher among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> we were forc'd to give up the Point, and accordingly chang'd our <HI>Habits. A∣minadab</HI> was a Man of admirable good Sense, and so well vers'd in all parts of Learning, that we began to suspect, He was not really, what He
<PB REF="5"/>
appear'd to be; and we were con∣firm'd in it, by accidentally surprizing him one Morning, fumbling over his <HI>Beads,</HI> and paying his Devotion to an <HI>old, rusty Ten-penny Nail.</HI> At our Entrance into the Room, He was in some Confusion; but after He had pretty well recover'd Himself, He plainly told us, That He was a <HI>Ro∣mish Emissary, Superiour</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> that himself and some others of that Order in the same <HI>Disguise</HI> had lately made several <HI>Proselites;</HI> but enjoin'd us Secrecy, with a Purse of <HI>500 Guinea's.</HI> With this Money we made several Attempts to settle our selves in the World; but meeting with frequent Disappointments, We, at last, by the Advice of some of our Friends, furnish'd our selves with
<PB REF="6"/>
Three <HI>Horses,</HI> a pair of <HI>Baggs,</HI> a <HI>Portmanteau,</HI> and a <HI>Trumpet:</HI> Our <HI>Remedies</HI> and our <HI>Letters Patent</HI> were of our own Preparation. Being thus equipp'd, We set out from <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and did incredible Service to all, who apply'd themselves to Us: By this means We contracted a vast Correspondence in all Parts of the Kingdom; which put us to such Expence, that having squander'd a∣way a great Part of what We had got by our Practice, We judg'd it our best Way to sell our Horses, retire, and pass the Remainder of our Days in a private Life.</P>
<P>It woud be needless to give the Reader any farther Trouble at pre∣sent, designing in a short Time to print Proposals for publishing by Sub∣scription
<PB REF="7"/>
a full and impartial History of our whole Lives, and all our Ad∣ventures, since our Father's Death, in two Volumes in Folio; Which is already in great Forwardness.</P>

<HEAD>Congratulatory VERSES TO <HI>Edward Biddle,</HI> Gent.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FROM <HI>Isis</HI> Banks THREE kindred Bards unknown</L>
<L>Greet thee in Numbers, artless as thy own;</L>
<L>Resolv'd, like thee, to publish what they write,</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Mr. <HI>Biddle</HI>'s Preface.</NOTE> Nor yet expect to get a Farthing by't:</L>
<L>Unshaken in Their <HI>Loyalty,</HI> the same,</L>
<L>Fondly, like Thee, they hunger after Fame,</L>
<L>Their Bosoms glowing with an equal Flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<L>Let others stain with letter'd Pride the Bays,</L>
<L>And trick with labour'd Charms their gorgeous Lays;</L>
<L>To strength of Thought let others make Pretence:</L>
<L>WE shine in Dulness, unallay'd with Sense.</L>
<L>So <HI>Glow-worms</HI> take their Lustre from the Night,</L>
<L>Which disappears with the first dawning Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once on a Time the Youthful God of Song,</L>
<L><HI>Apollo,</HI> thus bespoke his menial Throng:</L>
<L>"Let no dull Mediums e're debase your Theme,</L>
<L>"Aspire, in all you write, to one Extreme;</L>
<L>"Thro' all your Numbers this great Precept keep,</L>
<L>"Or let them boldly soar, or humbly creep:</L>
<L>But both Extremes in BIDDLE'S Verse are found—</L>
<L>Hark! how He creeps in SENSE, and soars in SOUND!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
<L><HI>Sound, sound, ye blessed</HI> Britains, <HI>sing aloud,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And send</HI> Io Paeans <HI>far above the Cloud:</HI></L>
<L><HI>To us this Day is born, a Son is given;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Strike on your Harps, ye Sons of Earth and Heaven,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Royal little One, a beauteous Boy:</HI></L>
<L><HI>O sound, sound forth your everlasting Joy.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hark! 'tis the roaring Guns from th'</HI> Tower <HI>sent,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ha! look, look up, see here, the Firmament</HI></L>
<L><HI>In spreading Colours from the Flames proclaim,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Peoples New-born Joy, and</HI> England<HI>'s Fame.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sweet are the Hollows and melodious Cries:</HI></L>
<L><HI>O Gods! the sounding Bells will rend the Skies.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor with less Lustre does thy <HI>Drama</HI> shine,</L>
<L><HI>D'urfey</HI> and <HI>Settle</HI> breath in ev'ry Line:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11"/>Inly we mourn'd the vicious, tasteless Age,</L>
<L>And curs'd the deaf, inhospitable <HI>Stage:</HI></L>
<L>No kind <HI>Maecena's</HI> the starv'd Muse requites</L>
<L>For all Her foodless Days, and sleepless Nights;</L>
<L>No <HI>Brother-Wit</HI> applauds thy loyal Strains,</L>
<L>But Infamy alas! rewards thy Pains!</L>
<L>Ev'n ADDISON, for Candour known so long,</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide M. <HI>Biddle</HI>'s Preface.</NOTE> Rejects thy <HI>hapless, helpless, hopeless</HI> Song;</L>
<L>And TICKELL, if the Muse aright presage,</L>
<L>Will grudge, unrighteous Bard! His Patronage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Could Father <HI>Maevius</HI> quit the frosty Urn,</L>
<L>And <HI>Bavius</HI> for a while to Life return;</L>
<L>Could <HI>Ogleby</HI> his icy Fetters break,</L>
<L>And <HI>Withers</HI> from the Tyrant Dust awake:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="12"/>How would the good old Bards rejoice to fee</L>
<L>Their <HI>Genius</HI> and their <HI>Art</HI> reviv'd in THEE?</L>
<L>How would They Smile, when wond'ring They beheld</L>
<L>Their own <HI>divine</HI> Stupidity excell'd?</L>
<L>And see! methinks the laurel'd <HI>Shades</HI> arise!</L>
<L>(Death's iron Slumber shaking from their Eyes)</L>
<L>Immortal Dulness on each Brow appears,</L>
<L>And these faint Accents seem to reach our Ears.</L>

<L>"Thou last, and dearest of our num'rous Race,</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Biddle</HI>'s Poem being the first of the Sort, that ever yet appear'd in Publick, in our humble Opinion it seems to require a farther Illus∣tration, than those few References He has made at the Bottom of each Page: Which References being only explanatory of the Sense, (where, in His Judgment, it seems obscure;) We hope, he'll pardon us, if for the Far∣ther
<PB REF="22" MS="y"/>
