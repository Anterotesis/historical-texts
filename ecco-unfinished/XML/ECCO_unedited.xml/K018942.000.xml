<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ONE might venture to pass a Judgment upon the Bill of Commerce, in so far as it relates to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by compa∣ring the several Memorials and Representations given in to the Lords Commissioners of Trade by the Royal Bur∣rows (who are the Representatives of the Trading People in <HI>Scotland)</HI> with the Articles of the Treaty, by which it will appear, that all they desired or was material for their Trade, was granted. Yet the Interest of <HI>Scotland</HI> in this Matter, will more distinctly appear, by com∣paring the Circumstances of the Trade of that Country after the Peace of <HI>Ryswick,</HI> in which it must still continue, with the Circumstances it would have been in, if the Bill had passed.</P>
<P>It is certain and undeniable, that most of the <HI>French</HI> Goods and Mer∣chandizes used in <HI>Scotland,</HI> will be Imported there, notwithstanding our Trade remains actually Prohibited, or in effect so, by the heavy Duties in <HI>France;</HI> for in <HI>Scotland</HI> little other Wines or Brandies but <HI>French</HI> are drunk, and their Salt is so necessary for our Fishing, that even in the time of War, we were supplied with those Commodities directly from <HI>France,</HI> or from <HI>Holland</HI> and other Places, and either entered them as coming from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> or smuggled them upon the Coast.</P>
<P>As the Trade now stands, we must export Specie to purchase the Wines, Brandies, Salt, Paper,&amp;amp;c. which are the principal Commo∣dities Imported from <HI>France</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> for our Woollen Manufac∣tures, particularly our Serges, Fingrims, Stockings, Plaidens, Says, Stuffs, &amp;amp;c. and in general all Manufactures made or mixt with Wooll, Silk, Hair, Thread or Cotton, are now intirely Prohibited, all which might have been carried into <HI>France</HI> upon the easie Duties in the Tariff of 1664, if the Bill had passed. For as to Broad-Cloth, Mill'd Serges and Ratins, which were put upon the Tariff of 1699. it is our Misfortune to have little of that Species of Woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
As Matters stand now, our Leather dress'd, curried or tanned Gloves, &amp;c. our Lead, and indeed all the Merchandizes made of Iron, Brass or Copper, are in like manner Prohibited in <HI>France,</HI> which might have been Imported upon reasonable Duties, if the Bill had pass'd.</P>
<P>Our Hertings, had the Treaty taken Effect, might have been Impor∣ted into <HI>France,</HI> paying the same Duty that the Dutch pay, (viz.) Six∣teen Livres per Last, which was secured by the Eighth Article of the Treaty, and all possible Objections obviated by a Clause in the Bill; whereas now by the Arrest of the <HI>French</HI> King, Anno 1701. we must pay 80 Livres per Last, which is five times more than the Dutch pay, and is equal to a Prohibition.</P>
<P>Our Salmon, which had the Treaty been made Effectual, would have paid by the Tariff of 1664. Six-Livres per Eight Barrels, must now pay by the Arrest of 1701. Forty Livres, which is five times as much.</P>
<P>Our Cod-Fish in Barrel, before the Tariff of 1664. paid a very in∣considerable Duty, and by the Tariff of 1699. they are to pay Sixty Li∣vres per Last; whereas had this Treaty taken Effect, we were to have paid only Forty Livres per Last, of 12 Barrel, weighing 300 l. weight each, over and above the small Duties payable before the Tariff of 1664. both which are considerably less than the aforesaid Duties in the Tariff of 1699. which we are now subject to.</P>
<P>Our Coal, which by the Tariff of 1664. would have paid Eight Sols per Barrel, must now by the Arrest of 1701. pay 30 Sols, which is near four times as much.</P>
<P>Our Green and Salted Hides, by the Tariff of 1664. would have only paid Ten Sols each; whereas by the Arrest of 1701. they must pay now Thirty Livres per Dozen, which is three times as much.</P>
<P>Calves Skins, by the Tariff of 1664. would have paid only four Sols per Dozen; whereas now by the Arrest of 1701. they must pay twelve Livres, which is Sixty times as much.</P>
<P>Our Glew, which is the Produce of our Skins, by the Tariff of 1664. would have paid Eighteen Sols per Hundred weight, which now by the Arrest of 1701, must pay twenty Livres, which is above twenty two times as much.</P>
<P>Our Butter, sent from <HI>Kintire</HI> and other places of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whereof there were considerable quantities Exported, paid only by the Tariff of 1664. twelve Sols per Hundred weight, and by subsequent Arrests since 1664. it must pay six Livres per Hundred weight, which is more than twelve times as much.</P>
<P>Our Beef, Pork, Tallow, Cow-Hair, Glass-Bottles, and several other
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Merchandizes from <HI>Scotland,</HI> will now by the heavy Duties imposed by the Edict of 1701. stand in Effect Prohibited; which might have been Imported into <HI>France</HI> to good Advantage, had the Treaty been made Effectual.</P>
<P>And it is to be observed, that before the present Treaty of Commerce, several kinds of Goods, packed in Casks, Chests or Cases, paid Duty by weight, without deduction of the weight of the Cases or Imbalages, such as Butter, Tallow, Copperas, &amp;c. and which was computed near a fifth part of the Duty: Whereas had this Treaty taken Effect, we had in all probability been eased of that extraordinary Burden, which now we must be still subject to.</P>
<P>Before the Treaty of Commerce, there was 50 Sols, or rather 70 Sols, upon the Ton of British Ships, which was a great Discouragement to our Navigation, and a great Advantage to the Dutch, who by the Treaty of <HI>Ryswick</HI> obtained an Exemption from that heavy Duty, by which their Ships and Seamen were employed (being in a Condition to serve upon cheaper Freights) while our Ships were laid up, and our Seamen left to starve at home, or seek Employment abroad, which must still be the Case now that Article in the Treaty of Commerce, which exemp∣ted us from that heavy Duty of Tonage, by our not being able to send out any Goods, in effect is set aside. And it is observable, that tho' <HI>Scotland</HI> was of old free both from the Tonage in <HI>France,</HI> and of the Droit Aubein, by which the King of <HI>France</HI> succeeds to the Estates and Effects of Strangers dying in <HI>France,</HI> (which severe Law the Dutch, by the Treaty of <HI>Ryswick,</HI> were exempted from) yet since the Year 1688, the Duty of Tonnage has been exacted from the <HI>Scots:</HI> and no doubt the Droit Aubein will likewise be executed so soon as there is an Oppor∣tunity; for in the Year 1701, a <HI>Scots</HI> Factor having lest <HI>Paris,</HI> and gone to <HI>Italy</HI> upon the breaking out of the War, upon a Report of his being dead, his Effects were seized, which obliged him to return to <HI>France</HI> to recover his Effects, by proving he was alive.</P>
<P>The Advantages <HI>Scotland</HI> would have had by the
Accession of the Plan∣tation-Trade, and the Exporting of Tobacco, Sugar, Cotton, Dying Woods, &amp;c. into <HI>France</HI> upon reasonable Duties, had the Treaty taken effect, are likewise very considerable.</P>
<P>The Encouragement we perceive by the Votes was intended for out Linnen Manufacture, by taking off the Duties upon Flax and Linsced Imported, and upon <HI>British</HI> Linnen Exported, would have been very beneficial to our Country; which, with the many Advantages above∣mentioned, we have forfeited by flinging out this Bill.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
To conclude: As all who pretend to know any thing of the Trade of this Country, are much concern'd at the Throwing-out of a Bill so beneficial to <HI>Scotland,</HI> so they can't but admire the Conduct of some who appear'd so warmly against our Interest. Those who did it igno∣rantly, ought to be forgiven; but if any, upon the account of Party, <HI>or personal Disappointment,</HI> have thus sacrific'd their Nation's Interest, they cannot fail of suitable Thanks from their Country.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING read your Papers upon the Subject of the <HI>French</HI> Trade, I could not refrain giving you some few Hints, from these Parts, relating to the ill Share our Part of the Country is like to have in it: And this I conceived might be useful to you, when you should come to speak of our Trade to <HI>France,</HI> as I understood by some of your <HI>MERCATORS</HI> you purposed to do.</P>
<P>There are severals of our Gentlemen now with you in <HI>England,</HI> who know well, That at the Treaty of Union, particularly when the Sixth Article of the Union came to be read in the Parliament on the 27th of <HI>November</HI> 1706, a very long Debate was had in the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament; anent the <HI>Scots</HI> being obliged to enter into the same Prohibitions as the <HI>English,</HI> and particularly the Wooll, several Speeches were then made in the House, representing the Advantage of the <HI>French</HI> Trade to the Peo∣ple of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and particularly those Advantages were said to consist in the <HI>French</HI> taking off from <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Fish and the Wooll. This was esteemed so great an Advantage to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that certain Gentlemen, some of them the same who are now actually against the present Treaty of Commerce, and making the Articles thereof Effectual, were then so zealous for the Trade from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> that they brought the Proposal into the Parliament the said 27th of <HI>November</HI> 1706, for esta∣blishing the Liberty of Exporting our Wooll into <HI>France,</HI> in these Words, as per the Minute of that Day.</P>
<P>Thereafter there was a Clause offer'd to be added to the said Sixth Ar∣ticle, in these Terms: (Viz.) But <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the space of Years after
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
the first Day of <HI>May</HI> next, shall be free from, and no ways subject to, the Prohibition and Restrictions made against Exporting Wooll, Skins with Wooll upon them, and Woollen Yarn, which by the Oaths of the Sel∣lers and Buyers shall be made appear to be the proper Growth and Pro∣duct of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and spun within the same, which shall no ways be com∣prehended under any of the Laws already made in <HI>England,</HI> or to be made during the space aforesaid.</P>
<P>The several Speeches made in Parliament upon the Occasion of this Proposal, signified, That <HI>Scotland</HI> having not a large Quantity of Ma∣nufactures to answer the Imports from abroad, were obliged to Export their Wooll unmanufactur'd; and whereas by the Treaty of Union they would come under the same Denomination with the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and have those few Woollen Manufactures which they did make Prohi∣bited in <HI>France,</HI> their whole Trade would be ruin'd, unless the Wooll was allow'd to be Imported: and especially it was said, That the Wooll-Masters, such we call in <HI>Scotland</HI> those Gentlemen of the Shires of <HI>Gal∣laway, Dumfries, Roxburgshire,</HI> &amp;c. who take their Rents in Wooll, would be impoverish'd in their Estates.</P>
<P>Upon the refusing this Vote by the Parliament, another Vote follow'd on the 12th of <HI>November</HI> 1706. upon another Proposal, (Viz.) That all Encouragement be provided for the Heretors in the Wooll Counties, in case the Prohibition of the Exportation of Wooll be approved. This was the only Expedient which could be found out to appease the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Loss which they supposed the preventing the Exporta∣tion of their Wooll and their Woollen Manufactures into <HI>France,</HI> would be to them by the Union. It is very strange, any of the same Gentle∣men should now be of the Opinion, that the laying open their Trade to <HI>France</HI> for all their Woollen Manufactures again, should now be of no Advantage to them.</P>
<P>In consequence of the last mentioned Vote, you will find it in the Ar∣ticles, that out of the equivalent Money to be given to <HI>Scotland</HI> for Loss by the Union, the Sum of 14000 l. was set apart to be paid to the said Wooll-Masters, after the Rate of 2000 l. per An. for seven Years, which is said to be appointed to encourage the Manufacturing the said Wooll in the Country, that so the Stop of its Exportation might be no Loss to the Country.</P>
<P>Again, upon the farther Debating the said sixth Article, and the eighth Article, several long Speeches were made in Parliament, particularly by the late Lord <HI>Beilhaven,</HI> the Laird <HI>Saltown,</HI> and others, setting forth, That the <HI>French</HI> Trade was much more to the Advantage of <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
than the Trade to <HI>England</HI> could be, or than <HI>England</HI> could any way make us amends for. These Speeches may be seen in the 37th, 38th, and 39th Vote of Parliament, Published and Printed by Authority of the same.</P>
<P>Not that the Exportation of Wooll was always free in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> se∣veral Prohibitions having intervened, and so also it might have been, had the Union not been concluded; but that those Gentlemen who have since Argued against the Treaty for an open Trade with <HI>France,</HI> and admit∣ting the <HI>British</HI> Manufactures into <HI>France</HI> upon the low Duties of 1664 were the same who Proposed and Voted for the abovesaid Clause for Exporting the <HI>Scots</HI> Wooll Unmanufactured into <HI>France,</HI> is very plainly proven, from the Lists of those who Voted APPROVE or not AP∣PROVE, in the Minutes on the 6th and 8th Article of the Treaty, whose Names also are Printed here, and are Entred in the Rolls or Re∣gisters of Parliament.</P>
<P>Nor was this Point easily parted with, but many Reflexions were made here on those Members who were against the Clause for Exporting our Wooll; as what their Country lost a very great Advantage by.</P>
<P>In the Debates of the 16th of <HI>December,</HI> 1706. on the Eighth Report of the Committee appointed to Examine the 6th and 8th Articles of the Union, there were divers Speeches made to prove the <HI>French</HI> Trade much more to the Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> than the Trade to <HI>England</HI> could be; where the Four chief Articles of the Exportation from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> were said to be Wooll, Leather, Lead and Fish; and upon the whole, it was offered in Parliament under two Heads, especially by my Lord <HI>Beilbaven,</HI> 1. That <HI>Scotland</HI> got nothing by the <HI>English</HI> Trade. 2. That <HI>Scotland</HI> were considerable Gainers by the <HI>French</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>I shall give you some farther Account of these Things in a Post or two. But by this you will see, that the same <HI>French</HI> Trade, which some of our People exclaim against now in <HI>England</HI> as advantageous to the <HI>French,</HI> and a Loss to their own Country, they could openly push at when it serv'd a Turn, and acknowledge to be so advantageous to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> that they were willing to have a Law made to Export our Wooll to <HI>France</HI> unmanufactured, rather than not enjoy that <HI>French</HI> Trade which they acknowledged <HI>Scotland</HI> gain'd so much Money by.</P>
<P>I shall give you a larger Account of these Practices in a short while, if this proves of Use to your Undertaking.</P>
