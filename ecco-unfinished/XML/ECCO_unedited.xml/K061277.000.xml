<HEAD>TO THE
QUEEN,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is the Glory of Your <HI>Majesties Reign,</HI>
that all Your Great <HI>Actions,</HI> and all
Your great <HI>Designs,</HI> whether Abroad
in <HI>Arms,</HI> or at Home in <HI>Council,</HI> have
a Manifest, Visible and Profest <HI>Tendency</HI> to
the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> of all Your Subjects.</P>
<P>And <HI>Madam,</HI> as Heaven delights in the
upright Desires of his <HI>Creatures,</HI> when they
seek to answer the End of His <HI>Providence,</HI>
in exalting them to their respective <HI>Stations
in the World;</HI> So we may without Pre∣sumption
infer, That the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of
your <HI>Majesties Intentions</HI> for the Glory of
<HI>Eternal Wisdom,</HI> and the Happiness of
your <HI>People,</HI> tho' it may not be called the
Cause of our <HI>Blessings,</HI> yet it may be part
of the Reason why we have those Blessings
in Your Reign.</P>
<P>How else shall we account for the just Dis∣appointments
of former Attempts of this
kind, which God in his <HI>inextricable Coun∣sel</HI>
has not thought fit to bless; but as
was said of his own People of old, <HI>Because</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>their Hearts were not right with Him, nei∣ther
were they stedfast in his Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>It was without Doubt on very good
<HI>Grounds</HI> that Your Majesty so often exprest
your earnest Desires to see this <HI>Great Affair
of the Union finished</HI>—The <HI>Felicity</HI> of a
<HI>Nation United,</HI> that had been so long and
so often at the greatest Distance as to <HI>Inte∣rest</HI>
and <HI>Affection,</HI> could not but Recom∣mend
it self to <HI>Your Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>It would be worth their while who op∣posed
this <HI>Union,</HI> and still refuse to owne
the <HI>Advantage of it,</HI> to look back upon
the Years of <HI>Blood,</HI> and the terrible <HI>Deva∣stations
these two Sister Nations suffered in
the Days of their Separation,</HI> let them ex∣amine
the History of the past <HI>Ages,</HI> let
them Enquire there for the particulars of
Three hundred and fourteen <HI>Battels,</HI> and
calculate the <HI>Blood</HI> of a Million of the
bravest Men in <HI>Europe,</HI> lost in the sence∣less
<HI>Feuds</HI> of these two Nations.</P>
<P>Let them view the Spoils of the <HI>Bor∣ders,</HI>
not yet repaired, the Monuments
of the <HI>Nobility</HI> slain in the <HI>Field,</HI> which yet
remain, let them visit the ruined <HI>Castles,</HI>
the demolished <HI>Fortifications,</HI> the depo∣pulated
<HI>Towns,</HI> the Gentlemens Seats left
in <HI>Heaps,</HI> which yet appear—were all the
<HI>Inconveniencies of the Union, which the most
uneasy People can suggest</HI> to be allowed, yet,
<PB REF="5"/>
that <HI>an end is put</HI> to Blood and Rapine,
that the Sword <HI>is taken out of the Hand of
the Spoiler,</HI> that we shall no more be <HI>cut∣ting
the Throats of our Brethren,</HI> is worth
giving their Blessing to <HI>Your Majesty and
the Union</HI> for, and must be acknowledg∣ed
to the happy Period of this Treaty.</P>
<P><HI>Nor is this all,</HI> But whatever <HI>Loss</HI> some
may alleadge <HI>Scotland</HI> suffers in this <HI>Union,</HI>
in Matters of <HI>Commerce,</HI> in removing her
<HI>Parliaments,</HI> in lessening the <HI>Conflux</HI> of her
<HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in <HI>Taxes,</HI>
and in carrying away her <HI>People,</HI> Things
which Time may <HI>Remedy</HI> and <HI>Repay</HI> her
for with <HI>Interest;</HI> Yet <HI>this</HI> the most preju∣dic'd
Man in <HI>Scotland must acknowledge they
have in Exchange,</HI> and which <HI>if they know
how to value it,</HI> is worth all they have
paid, or can pay for it; I mean <HI>Liberty,</HI>
in its due and best Extent, Religious and
Civil.</P>
<P>I doubt not <HI>Madam,</HI> but as <HI>Liberty</HI> is se∣cured
to <HI>Scotland</HI> by the <HI>Union,</HI> so the
good People of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall in Time arrive
to a differing Taste of <HI>Liberty</HI> by the same
<HI>Union,</HI> &amp; shall learn to know how to prize it;
&amp; as they learn to value <HI>Liberty</HI> more, so they
will more and more bless God and <HI>your
Majesty</HI> for <HI>the Union,</HI> which has removed
them at once from a State of <HI>Bondage</HI>
to their Governours, and from the petty
<HI>Tyranny</HI> of their <HI>own Constitution,</HI> to be
<PB REF="6"/>
made ONE with the freest Nation in the
World.</P>
<P>Those that complain of this <HI>Union</HI> in the
little Articles of Commerce, and on Pre∣tence
of Inequalities, in which they never
fail of Redress in Parliament, as often as
they apply themselves for it—should do
well to look back upon the Days of Cruel∣ty
and Persecution, when the Goals were fil∣led
with their Citizens, and the Places of
Execution covered with the Blood of
their Ministers, when their Church was
trampled under Foot, and they had no Li∣berty
to worship GOD according to their
Consciences: Even in the Felicity of a Re∣volution
Establishment, they had no Secu∣rity,
that these Times should not return u∣pon
them—; <HI>But by the Union,</HI> they
see themselves unalterably established, their
<HI>Church-Government</HI> made a Fundamental
of the Constitution, and the very <HI>Church
of England</HI> engaged to preserve it intire.</P>
<P>If their Eyes are open, they may read
their Safety in the <HI>Rage</HI> and <HI>Desperation</HI> of
their <HI>Enemies,</HI> who have no Room to invade
them, but in Rebellion against Your <HI>Maje∣sty:</HI>
Who insult the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> and
Your Majesty's Authority together; and
none are found daring to open their Mouths
against them, but those that <HI>with the same
Breath</HI> blaspheme Your Royal Establish∣ment,
and wickedly worship an Invad∣ing
<HI>Usurper.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
It ought to be the <HI>Comfort</HI> as it is the
<HI>Honour</HI> of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that
her <HI>Safety,</HI> and Your <HI>Majesty</HI> 's, <HI>Authority,</HI>
have the same Establishment, are link't to∣gether
by the indissolvable <HI>Bonds</HI> of the
same <HI>Union,</HI> have the same Enemies, and
the same Friends, and in all Probability
must have the same <HI>Duration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No humane Power can alter the</HI> Esta∣blishment
of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but
they must dissolve the <HI>Union</HI> of the Two
Kingdoms; <HI>and in such</HI> Dissolution <HI>would
of Course follow</HI> the unravelling the Prote∣stant
Succession, and Overthrowing the Revo∣lution
upon which the present Constitution
and Your Majesties Royal Dignity is Esta∣blished.</P>
<P>This alone, if rightly Considered, would
stop the Complaints of all those <HI>People</HI> in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> who however they may be other∣wise
Dissatisfied <HI>with the Union,</HI> have yet
a true <HI>Value</HI> for the <HI>Safety of their Religion,</HI>
the <HI>Establishment of their Church,</HI> and their
<HI>Deliverance from Persecution.</HI></P>
<P>And there is no Question but in Time
the just Reflection on these Things will
prevail upon Men of Honesty in all Parts
of <HI>Your Majesties Dominions,</HI> to acknow∣ledge
the Happiness and Advantages of the
<HI>Union,</HI> tho' at present the Artifice of their E∣nemies
<HI>rather than any real Mischiefs felt by
<PB REF="8"/>
it,</HI> have filled their Mouths with Com∣plaint.</P>
<P>As their Religious <HI>Liberty</HI> is thus secur'd,
so <HI>Civil Liberty</HI> is an immediate and visible
<HI>Effect</HI> of this Great <HI>Transaction:</HI> All the In∣vasions
of ignorant <HI>Magistrates,</HI> Privy
Council <HI>Usurpations,</HI> abusing the <HI>Roy∣al
Authority,</HI> and the persnal Tyranny of
the <HI>Gentry</HI> over the <HI>Commonality,</HI> is, <HI>if they
please,</HI> deposed by this <HI>UNION</HI>—:
<HI>Scotland</HI> is now inno <HI>Bondage</HI> but what
is meerly <HI>Voluntary;</HI> owing to their Want
of a <HI>Taste</HI> of <HI>Liberty,</HI> and their Ignorance of
the Advantages of it; <HI>Things,</HI> which <HI>Time</HI> and
<HI>Experience</HI> will not fail to remove, and <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
shall hereafter be reckoned, amongst
these <HI>free People</HI> that all the World envyes.</P>
<P><HI>Posterity,</HI> Madam, must own to Your <HI>Ma∣jesties
Memory,</HI> all that they meet with in
the <HI>Union,</HI> that is <HI>Peaceable, Easy</HI> and
<HI>Advantageous,</HI> and the <HI>Nations</HI> that are
yet to be born will bless your very <HI>Name,</HI>
when they see the <HI>Effects</HI> of it to them and
their Children.</P>
<P>That <HI>Faction</HI> will be ever <HI>Heaving</HI> and
<HI>Struggling, Envy</HI> rageing, <HI>Slander</HI> barking,
and <HI>Hell</HI> plotting against this <HI>Union,</HI> and a∣gainst
every happy <HI>Event</HI> that proceeds
from it, is rather a Testimony for, than an
Argument against it—. It could not be
expected that any Kind of <HI>People</HI> whose
<PB REF="9"/>
Hopes, or Gain, or Interest, or Party sub∣sisted
in the <HI>Disorders</HI> and <HI>Convulsions</HI> of
their <HI>Native Country,</HI> should smile upon
this Undertaking: The Interests of <HI>Popery,
Tyranny, French Usurpations</HI> and <HI>Spurious
Succession,</HI> received a mortal <HI>Stab</HI> by this
<HI>Union;</HI> And therefore cannot but make
<HI>War</HI> against upon all Occasions.</P>
<P>If <HI>Protestants,</HI> if Men of honest <HI>Designs,</HI>
and good <HI>Principles,</HI> are found Complain∣ing
of or Regreting the <HI>Union,</HI> it is only such
whose private Prejudices are built upon the
<HI>Errors</HI> of their <HI>Judgment;</HI> Or whose Eyes
it has not yet pleased GOD to open to the
true <HI>Intent</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of Your <HI>Majesty</HI> in
bringing it to pass.</P>
<P>But as it is to be hoped, those Prejudices
shall in Time be removed, and all Honest
Men shall see the <HI>Publick Good</HI> in the <HI>Union;</HI>
so there has always been this happy Diffe∣rence,
even in the Dislike of these Men to
the <HI>Union,</HI> and that of other People—That
<HI>these</HI> objected against Circumstcances,
<HI>those</HI> against Essentails—<HI>these</HI> have
their little Scruples as they fear the <HI>Union</HI>
may interfere with their Civil or Religious
<HI>Interests, those</HI> abhor the very Thing
UNION, and oppose it <HI>as such,</HI> and <HI>as</HI> it
tends to the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Prosperity</HI> of both
<HI>Nations.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth of this Distinction appeared
<PB REF="10"/>
most evidently in the Affair of the late <HI>In∣vasion;</HI>
when Joy and Satisfaction appeared
in the very Countenances of the <HI>Jacobite</HI>
Opposers of the <HI>Union,</HI> from the View they
had of the Overthrow of the <HI>Constitution</HI>
by a <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Popish Usurpation;</HI> while
the other, like Faithful Subjects to Your
<HI>Majesty,</HI> prepared to defend even that very
<HI>Union</HI> they disliked, honestly laying aside
their private <HI>Prejudices,</HI> to joyn in the <HI>Pub∣lick
Defence</HI> of <HI>Your Majesty and their
Country,</HI> and thereby approved them∣selves
both <HI>good Christians,</HI> and <HI>good Sub∣jects,</HI>
to the Glory of Your <HI>Majesty's Go∣vernment,</HI>
and to the <HI>Confusion</HI> and <HI>Disap∣pointment
of your Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>May it please Your Majesty,</P>
<P>As the <HI>Union</HI> bears Your Royal Cha∣racter
to <HI>Posterity,</HI> so no History of it can
be perfect without Your <HI>Name</HI> in its <HI>Front∣piece;</HI>
The World must have Your <HI>Ma∣jesties
Zeal</HI> for, and <HI>Concern</HI> in this great
Tranfaction of <HI>Union</HI> made particularly
known: Or no <HI>Historian</HI> can be just in
the Relation, nor can Posterity form any
<HI>Ideas</HI> in their Minds, of the Manner how it
came to pass.</P>
<P>Your wise and faithful Counsellors As∣sisted,

<HI>Embrio</HI>—But the Conception, the
<PB REF="11"/>
Thought of <HI>Union,</HI> the Passion for its com∣pleating,

Complyance of Your <HI>Parliaments,</HI> and
the general Strain of <HI>Popular Inclinatior,</HI>

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN</HI> writing a History of the <HI>Union,</HI> it could not be reasonably ex∣pected,
that I should go any farther than the Finishing, Ratify∣ing
and Exchanging the Treaty in the Respective Parliaments
of the two Nations to be United—and this I think I have
Finished in the following Sheets.</P>
<P>However, since the Work, has lyen longer in the Press than I at
first Expected; and some Remarkable things have in Consequence of,
and very much Depending upon the <HI>UNION</HI> happened since, I could
not Satisfy my self, without giving a short Abridgement of the State of
Things, between the Time of Finishing the Treaty, and the Publica∣tion
of this Work, which tho it be rather a Kind of Summary Reca∣pitulation
of things, than a Historical Narration, may yet be Equally
Profitable to him that shall Enquire into the Affairs of the United
Kingdoms at that Time.</P>
<P>The Union took Place, as has been Noted the Ist of <HI>May</HI> 1707,
The Management of the Revenue, the Trials in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> and
<HI>Admirality,</HI> were all Settled on a New Foot, Commissioners of the
<HI>Customs, Excise</HI> and <HI>Equivalent,</HI> were appointed; Judges of the Court
of <HI>Exchequer;</HI> a New <HI>Admirality,</HI> and their respective Offices were all
fix'd; the Coin was Reformed, and entirely Reduc'd to the <HI>English</HI>
Standard (<HI>the small Copper Money only Excepted</HI>) Weights and
Measures were Regulated in part, and the respective Alterations and
Models, whether in Government, or Commerce, Enacted by the
<HI>Union,</HI> began every where to be put in Practice.</P>
<P>The <HI>British Parliament</HI> had been Assembled at <HI>Westminster,</HI> ac∣cording
to the Treaty, and had been Concluded with a General Satis∣faction;
And Her Majesty began to see the Compleat End of Her
Wishes, in the <HI>Union</HI> being actually Consummated; The <HI>Northern
Peers</HI> and <HI>Commons Sitting,</HI> and that too with a General Satisfaction
and Applause in that <HI>First parliament</HI> of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>In this <HI>Parliament,</HI> several Things were done for the <HI>better Improv∣ing,</HI>
and as it was Called then, <HI>Rendring more Effectual,</HI> the <HI>UNION,</HI>
particularly that of Dissolving the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> Re-establishing the
<PB N="ii" REF="14"/>
<HI>Sessions</HI> of the <HI>Peace</HI> by <HI>Justices,</HI> &amp;c. Settling the <HI>Militia,</HI> and mak∣ing
<HI>Lord Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants,</HI> &amp;c. in every County as
in <HI>England;</HI> of all which particular Mention is made in the fol∣lowing
Sheets—, several Regulations also in <HI>Trade</HI> were made here;
for the Ease of <HI>North Britain;</HI> particularly the Removing the Difficul∣ties
of bringing Foreign Imported <HI>Goods</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and
the great Debate about the <HI>Wine, Brandy,</HI> &amp;c. brought into <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
in the Interval between the Finishing, and Effectual taking Place of
the <HI>Union,</HI> was put to an End, entirely in the Favour of <HI>Scotland,</HI> every
thing being Cleared at once, and all Interruptions of <HI>Commerce</HI> thereby
Removed.</P>
<P>But in the Middle of all this <HI>Harmony,</HI> an Accident interveen'd
which if it had not been Mercifully prevented by the immediate Inter∣position
of a <HI>Divine Power,</HI> had at once Unravelled all this happily
finished <HI>Constitution,</HI> and that in a manner that the most Violent <HI>Op∣poser</HI>
of the <HI>Union,</HI> could not in his warmest Thoughts have honestly
wished to have seen.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>French Invasion;</HI> which Endangered not the <HI>Union</HI>
only, but bid fair for Overturning the whole Frame of the present
<HI>Establishment</HI> in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> tearing up the very Foundation of
our <HI>Constitution,</HI> I mean the <HI>Revolution;</HI> and Restoring, not only
<HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Government,</HI> but even <HI>Popery</HI> it self, that
had so many Years since, and at such Expence of Blood and Treasure
been Dethroned in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I shall need to bring very few Arguments to prove this, to have
been the immediate Consequence of the Success of this Expedition, after
I have given a Summary Account of the Matter of Fact, which is
briefly as follows.</P>
<P>About <HI>January</HI> 1707, frequent Advices from <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI>
gave the <HI>Government</HI> Notice, That the <HI>French</HI> were making great
Preparations at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> for some secret Expedition; upon far∣ther
Search into the Matter of Fact, it appeared that several Men of
War were fitting out there with the utmost Expedition, and unusual
Quantities of Arms and Ammunition providing, with a large Train of
Artillery; which were all to be Shipped forthwith on Board the Ships
fitting up as above.</P>
<P>These Advices were still Seconded with others, till at last the <HI>French</HI>
themselves making it no longer a Secret, and some of the Men of War
being ready, they Ordered the Stores, Arms and Ammunition to be
actually Shipped on Board, drew their Troops down to the Shore, and
Openly Declared that this Expedition was Designed for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to
Re-instate the King of <HI>Great Britain, So they Stiled the Pretender,</HI>
in the Possession of his Lawful <HI>Dominions,</HI> as <HI>they Called them,</HI> and
this they said was done at the Earnest Request of his Subjects in that
Kingdom.</P>
<P>It is true, and <HI>most People thought it reasonable to judge,</HI> that it was
not probable, the King of <HI>France</HI> would Embark in a Design of so Great
Consequence, had he not received Invitations from <HI>Scotland:</HI> Howe∣ver,
The Design not Succeedong, those Correspondences never came to
<PB N="iii" REF="15"/>
be effectually discover'd; And therefore the <HI>House of Lords</HI> in their
Address to <HI>Her Majesty</HI> take Notice, That the King of <HI>France</HI> making
an Attempt to invade <HI>Her Majesties</HI> Dominions with such a contemptible
Force, was a sufficient Evidence that be must have Encouragment from some
Person in <HI>Scotland</HI> disaffected to <HI>Her Majesties Government.</HI></P>
<P>However, The strictest Inquisition after these Correspondencies could
never make any considerable Discovery, the many Persons were taken up,
which seemed to be owing rather to the Miscarriage of the Design, the
<HI>French</HI> never coming on Shore with any <HI>Forces,</HI> and their Friends on
Shore being too politick to show themselves till they saw their Troops on
Shore, and in some Posture and Condition to protect them;—There
were several Gentlemen taken up upon general Suspicions, which however
it gave some Offence to the People, yet was thought necessary at that time,
<HI>of which by and by.</HI></P>
<P>About the End of <HI>February,</HI> these Preparations of the <HI>French</HI> were
come to such a Height, and the Design of invading <HI>Scotland so out of
doubt,</HI> that the <HI>Government</HI> here thought it high Time to prepare for the
Defence of <HI>Scotland:</HI> And to that Purpose, <HI>Her Majesty</HI> wrote a Letter
to the <HI>Privy Council</HI> in <HI>Scotland (which, tho determined to expire
by an Act of Parliament, yet was in Being, and had Power to act,
till the first Day of</HI> May <HI>following.)</HI> In this Letter, <HI>Her Majesty</HI> gave
them Notice that she had received Information of an <HI>Intended Invasion</HI>
back'd with a <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Popish Power,</HI> design'd against <HI>Scotland</HI> in
Favour of the Pretender;—And therefore recommended to them
the Security of the Kingdom, the Preservation of the publick Peace, and
that they would use all possible Means to that Effect.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, Vigorous Preparations were made in <HI>England</HI> for
preventing the Designs of the <HI>French,</HI> as well by equipping a Fleet to inter∣cept
them at Sea, and so prevent their Landing; as by providing Forces to
give them a warm Reception, in case they should land in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I know there were Complaints made, and Endeavours used to expose the
Conduct of the <HI>Government</HI> in their Preparations; suggesting, That due
Care was not taken to put <HI>Scotland</HI> in a Posture of Defence in case the
<HI>French</HI> had landed: and a certain <HI>Noble Person</HI> caused the Letters
of the <HI>E.</HI> of <HI>Leven</HI> the <HI>General</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were written in
the midst of that <HI>Hurry,</HI> and in which his <HI>Lordship</HI> wrote in pressing
Terms for Assistance, to be Printed;—But when these Things came to
be Examin'd in <HI>Parliament,</HI> it appeared otherwise than those Gentlemen
represented, and the <HI>Parliament,</HI> receiv'd full Satisfaction, that all the
Diligence was used which the Nature of the Thing would admit,—<HI>But be
that as it will,</HI> by the Event we found that <HI>Providence</HI> blessed the Measures
taken, so as that they not only prevented the Execution of the Design at
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but dispirited the Party in such a Manner, that they durst
not make the Attempt any where else, which they might have done with too
much Effect, and might but too well have made themselves Amends for the
Disappointment, by ruining the Country, and keeping the Affairs of <HI>Britain</HI>
in longer Suspence.</P>
<P>I shall however, without meddling with these Disputes which are dead
with the Thing, show by the meer Relation of Fact, That <HI>England</HI> was in no
<PB N="iv" REF="16"/>
Condition to have made any Preparation that could have been effectual to
prevent the Landing of the French;—And thus all they had done,
as to Stores, Magazines, or Arms, as the Thing then stood, had been only
leaving the greater Booty to the Enemy, and furnishing them with Weapons
to use against our selves,—Since the Number of Troops, or the Condi∣tion
of the Fortifications of <HI>Scotland</HI> were such as could make no tolerable
Resistance, nor so much as protect the Magazines, if any had been E∣rected.</P>
<P>But to return to the Preparations made in <HI>England:</HI>—First, with
<HI>Incredible Celerity,</HI> all the Men of War that could be found in any Con∣dition
were fitted out, mann'd, and victualled in Order to put to Sea, and
wait for the Enemies Fleet;—And the Expedition in this Case
was so surprising, That the <HI>French</HI> who had been inform'd that the <HI>English</HI>
Navy was in no Condition to offer them any Disturbance in their Design,
and upon which Presumption, they own'd afterward they made their Design
publick; found to their Disappointment sixteen <HI>English</HI> Men of War cruising
before <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> before they (the <HI>French</HI>) were in any Condition to put to
Sea—This however did not put a Stop to their Design,—but they went on
with their Equipment; And their Fleet being ready, they embark'd their
Troops about the fifth of <HI>March,</HI> their whole Force consisting of <HI>Twenty
eight Sail</HI> of <HI>Ships,</HI> whereof sixteen were <HI>Men of War,</HI> and twelve were
large <HI>Friggots</HI> or <HI>Privateers;</HI>—Their <HI>Land-Forces</HI> consisted of 15
<HI>French Battalions,</HI> and about 300 <HI>Volunteers,</HI> the most part <HI>Irish,</HI> being
to serve as <HI>Officers</HI> for the raising <HI>New Regiments</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI>—These
Forces being on Board with the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and some few Scots
Gentlemen, particularly, the two Sons of the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Middletoun,</HI> with
the Old Lord <HI>Griffin, &amp;c.</HI> They came out of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> about the sixth of
<HI>March,</HI> commanded by the <HI>French</HI> Admiral <HI>Monsieur Fourbin.</HI></P>
<P>In this Time the Diligence of our <HI>Admiralty</HI> was such, tho <HI>England</HI>
was at that Time very bare of Ships, that the <HI>English Squadron</HI> before
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> was made up to 36 Sail, including some <HI>Dutch Men of War,</HI>
that had also joined them; And as the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay in <HI>Newport
Pits,</HI> watching an Opportunity to sail, so the <HI>English</HI> lay off of <HI>Graveline,</HI>
ready to start with them, and resolv'd, <HI>if possible,</HI> to engage them in
their <HI>Passage.</HI></P>
<P>However, The <HI>French</HI> trusting to their <HI>Canvas,</HI> the Cleanness of their
<HI>Bottoms,</HI> and their <HI>Nimble Sailing,</HI> resolved to put to Sea; tho, as it
were, in Ʋiew of a superior Force; And accordingly, the Wind blowing
fresh at <HI>North-west,</HI> they weighed and set Sail;—The various
Course of the Fleets, and the Success, as to the sailing part, was the Sub∣ject
of much Discourse: I shall therefore be the Exacter in it, since
it was wondred very much how the <HI>French</HI> who lay in View of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Fleet could so get the Start of them, as to be at the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI>
about two Days before them; By which, had they not overshot
their <HI>Port,</HI> they might have fairly put their Design in Execution, not∣withstanding
all the Power of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet at their
Heels.</P>
<P>The Wind, as I noted before, blew at <HI>North-west,</HI> a fresh Gale, and
the <HI>French</HI> weighing upon the Top of High Water, went away with the
<PB N="v" REF="17"/>
Tide of Ebb to the <HI>North</HI> -ward, keeping the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coast on Board, which
was then the Weather-Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> lying in <HI>Gravling-Pits,</HI> had the following Disadvantages
in the Pursuit; <HI>First,</HI> That it was about <HI>Eight Hours</HI> after the <HI>French</HI>
were sailed, before they could get Notice of it, and be under Sail.</P>
<P>It was indeed wondred at by some, why the <HI>English</HI> Fleet
knowing very well that the <HI>French</HI> were designed for <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which was <HI>North:</HI> and that they lay in <HI>Newport</HI> Road, should
<HI>themselvesly</HI> in <HI>Graveling,</HI> which was at least 25 Miles to the
<HI>South;</HI>—By which Means, when ever the <HI>French</HI> should sail, they
would necessarily be behind them a considerable Way.</P>
<P>But this is Answered by the Sailers, and which I shall not un∣dertake
to confute, <HI>viz.</HI> that it blew very hard, the Wind at
<HI>North,</HI> and <HI>North</HI> -west: And there was no other Place where
the <HI>English</HI> Fleet could ride with Safety.</P>
<P>I shall leave this Dispute as I find it, and content my self
with only naming it, as I shall others that came after it.—</P>
<P>Be it as it will, the Matter of Fact was so;—The <HI>French</HI>
Fleet being sailed about Eight Hours before,—Advice was brought to
Sir <HI>George Bing,</HI> who weigh'd with all Expedition, and followed with
all the Sail he could make.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> had also another Disadvantage, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>French</HI>
sailing with the first of the Ebb, he lost a Tide of them—So
that in their first Starting, the <HI>French</HI> had the Advantage of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Fleet, as follows.—Eight Hours in Time,
<Q><L>Twenty five Miles in Space,</L>
<L>And the Ebb of the Tide.</L></Q></P>
<P>With these Helps, and having first left out the lower Tire of their Guns
to make them Light for sailing, their Ships being clean, and new fitted,
the <HI>French</HI> Ships also being really better Sailers, generally speaking, than
ours: with these Helps, I say, they got a very great Start of the <HI>English</HI>
in their first setting out.</P>
<P>When they came to Sea, another Thing happened, which gave them a
yet farther Advantage of the <HI>English;</HI>—The <HI>French</HI> Fleet kept a
large <HI>Offing,</HI> as they call it, keeping to <HI>Windward</HI> all the Way rather
nearer the <HI>German</HI> Coast than the <HI>British.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Fleet bore away for their own Coast, and were seen off
of <HI>Loestof</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and from the Shore of <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P>The Reasons for this different shaping their Course seem these;—The
<HI>French</HI> were by all means possible to avoid the <HI>English</HI> Shore, lest
they should be taken short by the Wind, and might be Embay'd, and con∣sequently
Overtaken, having a Superior Force behind them. Also it was
not fit for them to be seen before they came to the <HI>Firth,</HI> that they might
not give the <HI>Alarm</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> to be ready for them.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the <HI>English</HI> made their own Coast, lest the <HI>French</HI>
should fall in there with their <HI>Merchants,</HI> and sweep the Coast of their
Ships: Which had they done, they might indeed have made great
<HI>Havock.</HI></P>
<P>However it was, these Disadvantages gave the <HI>French</HI> such a Start of
<PB N="vi" REF="18"/>
the <HI>English,</HI> that they were on the Coast of <HI>Scotland</HI> two Days before the
<HI>English</HI> Fleet, and had not <HI>Heaven</HI> blinded their <HI>Pilots,</HI> so as to miss
their Port, they might have put their Design in Execution in Spight of all
our Forces.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday March</HI> the <HI>12th,</HI> they made the Coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but
found themselves the Hight of <HI>Montross,</HI> about fifteen Leagues to
the North of the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>—Here they
made Signals, and some Boats going off to them, they were Informed
where they were,—then they stood away Southward, and spent
all that Day before they got to the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>Now they sent one Ship, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Salisbury,</HI> up the <HI>Firth,</HI> whether
it was to make any Signal to their Party, to give Notice of their
Coming, Or to get any Intelligence, remains yet Undetermined;—they
made the <HI>Firth</HI> just as the Tide was spent, and were therefore
Obliged to spend six Hours more at Anchor, under the Isle of <HI>Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in
the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth,</HI> and here, on the fourteenth early in the
Morning, they find themselves Overtaken, their <HI>Scouts</HI> Discovering the
<HI>English</HI> Fleet standing in for the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>Here then, they find their <HI>Enterprise</HI> at an End, their Moments
are gone, in which they might have put their Errand in Execution,—and
now they have no more to do, but to make the best of their Way
to Sea.</P>
<P>Upon this, therefore they Weigh, and stand away for the <HI>North,</HI>
with all the Sail they can make, and the <HI>English Fleet</HI> after them.</P>
<P>The Foremost of the <HI>English</HI> Ships came often within Gunshot of
them, but not so many as could stop their <HI>Fleet,</HI> or bring them to
Engage,—but they maintained a Kind of a Runing <HI>Fight</HI> with
those of the <HI>English</HI> that Pursued, in which little Harm was done on
either Side, save that in the Night, one of their Ships being the
<HI>Salisbury,</HI> formerly taken from the <HI>English,</HI> fell in among the <HI>English
Fleet,</HI> and being Surrounded was Taken.</P>
<P>With this Booty, and the <HI>French</HI> Out-sailing the <HI>English,</HI> Sir
<HI>George Bing</HI> having Pursued them to the North-east Point of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
Called <HI>Buchan-ness,</HI> seen them several Leagues to the North of
that, and at last lost Sight of them, be returned to the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edin∣burgh;</HI>
And keeping his <HI>Fleet</HI> in a Sailing Posture, with his <HI>Scouts</HI>
continually Abroad to gain Intelligence of the <HI>Enemy,</HI> he continued in
the <HI>Firth</HI> till the Begining of <HI>April;</HI> When the Government having
intelligence that the <HI>French</HI> were Returned into <HI>Dunkirk</HI> with their
<HI>Fleet,</HI> Sir <HI>George Bing</HI> was also Ordered Southward with the <HI>Eng∣lish,
Fleet,</HI> and so the whole War on that Side ended.</P>
<P>I come now to speak a little of the <HI>Preparations</HI> made by the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
by Land, in Order to Meet this New Eruption; supposing the
<HI>French</HI> had Landed,—which indeed was not without Hazard.</P>
<P>In Order to this, such Troops as were at Hand, were immediately
Ordered to March Northward, particularly they sent away two Troops
of the Queens Horse Guards, the Duke of <HI>Northumberland's</HI> Regi∣ment
of Horse, with the three Regiments of Dragoons of <HI>Essex, Raby</HI>
and <HI>Carpenter; besides which,</HI> two Regiments of Dragoons, and one
<PB N="vii" REF="19"/>
Regiment of Horse were Ordered to March to the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
to ly ready there, to be Embark'd on the first Orders.</P>
<P>Of Foot there were Thirteen Battalions then in <HI>England</HI> sent for∣wards,
including the Queens Guards, and some new Raised not quite
Compleat, and Ten Battalions from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be Noted, That as soon as ever the Certainty of the Design∣ed
<HI>Invasion</HI> came to the Knowledge of the <HI>States,</HI> they Ordered
Transports immediately to Carry Ten Battalions of <HI>British</HI> Troops to
<HI>England,</HI> to Assist the Queens Troops there; and when Sir <HI>George
Bing</HI> Pursued the <HI>French Fleet,</HI> as above, he sent <HI>Admiral Baker,</HI>
with Twelve Men of War into <HI>Holland,</HI> to bring those Troops away
to <HI>New Castle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> that so being Landed there, they might be
ready to joyn the Land Army, and the Ships to joyn the Fleet.</P>
<P>The Forces being thus Appointed, Marched all Northward, but the
Rendezvous was Appointed at <HI>York;</HI> For the Generals knowing the
Troops in <HI>Scotland</HI> to be Weak, and not assured how the People there
would behave themselves in general, had Resolved not to March
any Troops into <HI>Scotland,</HI> till the whole Army was Assembled, that
they might March in a Body—and to this Purpose the Earl of
<HI>Leven,</HI> with these few Forces he had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was Ordered, if he
could not Prevent their Landing, to make his Retreat to <HI>Berwick.</HI></P>
<P>The Forces when all together, would have Amounted by Computati∣on
as follows,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Horse,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Troops of Guards and <HI>Horse</HI> Grenadiers 500</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Northumberland</HI> 's Horse—450</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="20"/>
So that the whole Army when brought to a Body, was supposed to
Amount together as follows,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Horse</HI> and <HI>Dragoons,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>England—1850</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ireland—1000</ITEM>
<ITEM>Scotland—650</ITEM>

<ITEM>In all—17500.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Beside which, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had prepared a Second Convoy to send
Over Twelve Battalions more, if there had been any Occasion.</P>
<P>A Train of <HI>Artillery</HI> was preparing at the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and
was in a Good Forwardness, so as it might probably have been at the
Rendezvous as soon as the Troops could have well been Drawn toge∣ther.</P>
<P>I have been the more Particular in this, because I am Drawing
every thing to the <HI>Reader's</HI> View, that he may judge of some Con∣jectures,
I shall make concerning the Probabilities of the Success of this
<HI>Enterprise,</HI> and what might reasonably be supposed to have been the
Issue of it, since some People have been so Weak, as to say, It had been
Better for us to have let them come on <HI>Shore,</HI> and that we should
immediately have Crusht and Defeated them.</P>
<P>It remains now, to Enquire how the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> behaved
themselves in this Critical Juncture, and what Condition they were in
there, to have Received the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Condition of <HI>Scotland</HI> at that Time; it is to be Confest,
the French had all the Encouragement imaginable, to make such an
Attempt from the Circumstances of the Place, and the Temper of the
People: As to the Circumstances of the Place, 'tis Evident that the
Country was intirely Naked, and in a manner Defenceless.</P>
<P>The <HI>standing</HI> Forces were few.</P>
<P>The <HI>Militia</HI> just in the Middle, between Dissolving the Old
Model, and Erecting a New, so as they were absolutely Dis∣banded
without Commissions, without Officers, and without
any Form.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fortifications</HI> out of Repair.</P>
<P>The <HI>Magazins</HI> Empty.</P>
<P>The <HI>New Government</HI> Unform'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>People</HI> Divided.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="21"/>
It must be Confest, <HI>Never was Nation in such a Condition to be
Invaded;</HI> And there is no Doubt, but had the <HI>French</HI> Landed their
<HI>Forces,</HI> and got their Stores of <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Ammunition</HI> on <HI>Shore,</HI> as
<HI>they might easily have done, if they had not Overshot their Port</HI>—They
would with very little Opposition have been <HI>Masters</HI> of the whole
<HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P>It may be thought by some remote to my Purpose to Demon∣strate
this; But when I consider, what Differing Notions
the People in <HI>England</HI> have of the Attempt of the <HI>French,</HI>
and of their Success in it; I can not think it an Useless La∣bour
to give you a Brief Essay, at what the Event of that
Enterprize might probably have been,—that so we may see
what we have to be thankful for.</P>
<P>I am now to suppose the <HI>French</HI> Safe on Shore, their Magazine
and Train of Artillery Landed, and the Earl of <HI>Leven</HI> the <HI>General
for Her Majesty,</HI> Retreating towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> as he must undoubt∣edly
have done,—and as his Orders directed him to do—, without
which his Retreat being Cut off, be must have been Surrounded and
Taken, or have been Cut in Pieces, having no Place of Strength to
Retreat to.</P>
<P>Had they been thus on <HI>Shore,</HI> there is no Doubt, but in two Hours
they had been Masters of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> an open City, and without De∣fence;
the Castle indeed might have Held Out some Time, but the
<HI>City</HI> could have made no Resistance.—But that which was worse,
the Circumstances of the Time was such, and the People were so Di∣vided,
that the <HI>City</HI> must have sent down to <HI>Leith</HI> to have sought
Protection from the <HI>French</HI> against their own Rabbles, and they must
have Desired the <HI>French</HI> to have Come and Taken them into their
Protection, to have Preserved them from Plunder and Confusion.</P>
<P>I think <HI>whatever the Reasons of this were,</HI> which I desire to bury in
Silence, the Fact will be readily granted; and indeed all Men owned
at that Time, that if the <HI>French</HI> Landed their Forces, they must be
Master of the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> without any Opposition.</P>
<P>It is true that I am now but upon Suggestion and meer Supposition,
and I do not Affirm positively; But I leave it to any Man to judge of
Probabilities, and whether what I Suggest is Rational or no;—When
the <HI>French</HI> were thus Possest of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it is very
reasonable to Imagine that the first Thing they would have done,
was to <HI>Proclaim</HI> their <HI>King:</HI> If the Magistrates of the <HI>City</HI> would not
have Agreed to have Performed the Ceremony, the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
near at Hand, and the <HI>Citizens</HI> being Assembled, could soon have
Chosen New <HI>Magistrates,</HI> who would Chearfully have done it—.</P>
<P>Their King being Proclaimed, it seems Rational to Suppose, they
should next Summon the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> to take an <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>delity to
him;</HI> Such as Refused would have their <HI>Estates Confiscated,</HI> and
perhaps be Imprisoned; and if they got Room to Flee, would have
their Houses Plundred.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="22"/>
Being thus Masters of the <HI>Capital,</HI> and the <HI>Queens</HI> Troops having
Fled or Retreated towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> the Country exposed to their
Power; I think I make no Trespass on good Manners or Justice, if I
say, The Northern <HI>High-landers</HI> would have been soon Raised by the
Influence of their <HI>Superiors,</HI> who are for the most part <HI>Jacobites,</HI>—These
being in Arms, the <HI>Low-Lands</HI> are at their Mercy, and they
had soon Possest themselves of the whole <HI>Country,</HI> the <HI>Militia</HI> being
entirely without a <HI>Head,</HI> and without Order, Unlockt from the former
Settlement; and Unfixt in a New.</P>
<P>Being thus Possest of the <HI>Low-Lands,</HI> they soon would have been
<HI>Master</HI> of the whole <HI>Country;</HI> and indeed there was very Few that
Durst show their Faces against them, the Forwardness of One Party,
and the Divisions and Disorders of the Other making Way for it,—when
they had thus Reduc'd the <HI>Low-Lands,</HI> they had no more to do,
than to call a <HI>Convention</HI> of <HI>Estates,</HI> as at the <HI>Revolution;</HI> and
finding these Fast to their <HI>Interest;</HI> The first <HI>Laws</HI> should be to Re∣scind
the <HI>Revolution,</HI> Declare the <HI>Limited Succession</HI> a <HI>Visible Re∣bellion,</HI>
and an <HI>Invasion</HI> of the <HI>Right</HI> of another—, and thus a
compleat National Turn should have pass'd upon us—, and the <HI>Revo∣lution</HI>
should suffer a <HI>Re-revolution</HI> in a few Weeks, <HI>for these things
would require but little Time:</HI> Neither is it Presumption to Sup∣pose,
they should have gotten a <HI>Representative</HI> returned, that would
have come into such Measures, since they having the Absolute Posses∣sion
of the <HI>Country,</HI> the Influencing them under such Circumstances,
to the Choosing such Persons as they should think fit to put upon them
was easie enough,—Instances of which have been but too Common in
this <HI>Island,</HI> under a less Tyrannical Power than a <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>While they were thus Settling their <HI>Civil Government</HI>—, Their
<HI>Military Affairs</HI> could not have failed; the Inclination of the Common
People about <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Influence of the <HI>Chiefs</HI> and <HI>Heads
of Clans</HI> in the <HI>High-Lands,</HI> would have soon furnished Men for
New <HI>Revolutions,</HI>—The <HI>sixteen</HI> Regiments which they brought with
them, (so it seems they had determined) should have had <HI>two hundred</HI>
Men added to every Regiment, by way of filling up—five Regi∣ments
of <HI>Dragoons,</HI> and <HI>fourty</HI> Battalions of <HI>Foot</HI> was to have been
Raised immediately—; The Command of these Troops was to be gi∣ven
to <HI>Irish</HI> Officers, and of such, they brought great Numbers with
them; save only that the <HI>Colonels</HI> and some <HI>Captains,</HI> were to be Cho∣sen
of the <HI>Superiors</HI> or <HI>Chiefs</HI> where they were Raised, to Encourage
the Raising them.</P>
<P>Thus in less than six Weeks, they should have had 30000 Men
added to the Troops they brought with them—; The Money they
would have given the <HI>High-Land Gentlemen,</HI> would Effectual∣ly
have brought these <HI>Gentlemen</HI> to Forsake their Party, and Joyn with
them, and then the Design would have gone on beyond Expectation.</P>
<P>We are next to Enquire what was to become of the <HI>English</HI> Prepa∣ration
all this while? You have heard what <HI>Strength</HI> they were of
when come together; But it could not be possible that they could be all
brought together, their <HI>Magazines</HI> furnished, <HI>For the</HI> French <HI>would have
taken Care, they should have Subsisted ill enough in</HI> Scotland, <HI>Their</HI>
<PB N="xi" REF="23"/>
Train of <HI>Artillery</HI> have been come up, and they in Condition to have
Marched into <HI>Scotland</HI> in Battalia, as they must have done, under six
Weeks or two Months—; the Difficulties of the Roads, the <HI>Country
being at that Time very Deep,</HI> and the Carriages Heavy, would have
made it very bad, Marching an <HI>Army</HI>—; and the Want of <HI>For∣rage
would have made it Impracticable to have done it sooner.</HI></P>
<P>All this Time the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Jacobites</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would have
had, to have Strengthned their <HI>New Settlement,</HI> form'd their <HI>Army,</HI>
Fortified <HI>Leith,</HI> and other Places, and have prepared for War.</P>
<P>I shall readily Grant as any Body can desire, That when the <HI>Eng∣lish
Army</HI> came to be ready, and to enter <HI>Scotland,</HI> they should Beat
these <HI>New Invaders</HI> out of all; and that they should in Time pay Dear
for the Attempt; But it must be granted, this would have these
Consequences withal, 1. That it would have Ruin'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> 2.
Brought the <HI>Seat</HI> of <HI>War</HI> home to our own Doors. 3. Cause a Di∣version
of our <HI>Forces,</HI> and be an Occasion of withdrawing our <HI>Troops</HI> from
<HI>Flanders,</HI> where the <HI>Enemy</HI> felt the greatest Weight of the <HI>War</HI>—.
And 4. Have exceedingly protracted the <HI>War:</HI> Those Gentlemen
that were for having them Land, may Consut these probable Conse∣quences,
and they will see whether they have not very good Reason
to be sensible of the <HI>Happiness</HI> of the Disappointment.</P>
<P>I can not but take Notice here, of the <HI>Temper</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> of
<HI>Scotland</HI> at this Time; none will Doubt, but the Minds of Men were
variously agitated as their several <HI>Tempers, Interest</HI> and <HI>Party</HI> guid∣ed
them—, <HI>Hope</HI> on one Side, and <HI>Fear</HI> on the other Discovered it
self in a manner which both Sides would fain have Concealed; nor was
there wanting a <HI>Party</HI> who openly and avowedly, profest their Desires
to have the <HI>French</HI> Land, and their <HI>Resolution</HI> to joyn with them, and
this in so Open, so Rude, and so Threatning a Manner, as gave just
Cause of <HI>Terror</HI> to the Honest Loyal <HI>Party</HI> on the other Hand,
who saw themselves inevitably Ruin'd, <HI>if the</HI> French <HI>Landed,</HI> by their
own Rabbles—, The other <HI>Party</HI> having openly Threatned and Mark'd
out the <HI>Houses</HI> of such <HI>Families</HI> as were most Eminent for their <HI>Zeal</HI>
to the Establish't <HI>Goverment.</HI></P>
<P>It was Expected, and indeed Apprehended very much in <HI>England,</HI>
that those of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> who had before Vigorously Appeared
against the <HI>Union,</HI> and profest their Dislike of it upon all Occasions,
would have Appeared against the <HI>Government,</HI> at this Juncture,
and either have joyn'd with the <HI>Invaders,</HI> or have formed a Third
<HI>Party,</HI> and so have made a Division, which had in its Kind been equal∣ly
Patal.</P>
<P>But in this also they were disappointed, for the People who were most
warm against the <HI>Union,</HI> nay even the <HI>Western Men</HI> who do not own or
join with the <HI>Church,</HI> yet all as one Man declared against joining with
French <HI>Invaders, Papists,</HI> and a <HI>Retunrning I yranny,</HI> which they easi∣ly
foresaw must be the Consequence of an <HI>Invasion;</HI> And therefore lay∣ing
aside all their Old Animosities, private Grudges, and Cavils at the
<HI>Union, &amp;c.</HI> They unanimously declared their Resolution to stand toge∣ther,
<PB N="xii" REF="24"/>
and with their Lives and Estates to defend the <HI>Government</HI> and
their <HI>Country</HI> against all the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Pretender;</HI> And
to this End, they began to form Associations, the Burghers of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>
listed <HI>Men,</HI> and subscribed, for their Maintenance, some 10, some 20,
some more, and in other Places they were apreparing to do the like;
—the <HI>Western Men</HI> sent them Word they would come and join with
them, <HI>if there was Occasion;</HI> And in the mean time some of the People
called <HI>Cameronians</HI> made their open Protestation against it.</P>
<P>This was a very great Encouragement to the <HI>Government</HI> at that Time,
when the Vaunts of the other Party run high, and their Hopes were great;
But <HI>GOD</HI> in his <HI>Providence</HI> prevented the evil Consequences of this
Affair, as you have heard: and the good People who had made great Ap∣pearances
of <HI>Unanimity,</HI> found themselves delivered another and an easier
Way.</P>
<P>It happened very well at this Time, That the <HI>Commission</HI> of the
<HI>General Assembly</HI> was just set down, and the <HI>Ministers</HI> seeing the
<HI>Storm</HI> coming, both on the <HI>Ecclesiastick,</HI> as well as <HI>Civil Liberties</HI>
of the Nation, <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> being visibly struck at together
in the <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Foreign Destruction,</HI> plainly Threatning to swallow
up both—appointed a <HI>Solemn Fast</HI> to be kept over the whole Coun∣try.</P>
<P>I shall make no <HI>Comments</HI> on the Subject Matter of this <HI>Fast,</HI> the
<HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Commission</HI> does sufficiently show the Sense of the <HI>Mini∣sters,</HI>
and in what Manner the <HI>Invasion</HI> was like to relish among
them; and therefore I have Inserted it in this Place to Record the
<HI>Temper</HI> that appear'd at that Time; and what Hope the <HI>Pretender,</HI>
or his <HI>Party</HI> had Ground to raise upon the supposed <HI>Divisions</HI> of the
<HI>Presbyterians</HI> about the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>An Abstract of the said Act of the General Assembly is as follows.</P>
<P>At <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the Fifth of <HI>March</HI> One Thousand Seven Hun∣dred
and Eight Years.</P>
<P>THe <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>General Assembly,</HI> being sensible of the
great Wickedness, and crying Sins of all Sorts, abounding a∣mongst
us in this Church; and being in the just Judgment
of GOD, Threatned with an <HI>Invasion</HI> by an Enemy, that hath Im∣ployed
his Power for the Ruine of that Holy Religion which we
Profess, and the Enslaving of <HI>Europe;</HI> and who designs to set a <HI>Popish
Pretender</HI> upon the Throue of these Nations, to the utter Overthrow
of the True Reformed Religion, all our Interests Sacred and Civil,
and all that GOD hath graciously wrought for us by the late happy
<HI>Revolution,</HI> and hitherto Preserved to us; and being Sensible of
what we owe in Gratitude, to our only Rightful and Lawful SO∣VEREIGN
QUEEN <HI>ANNE,</HI> do look upon it as our Duty, with a
Regard to the Honour of GOD, the Preservation of our Religion,
the Quiet of Her Majestics Government, and the Good of our Coun∣try,
<PB N="xiii" REF="25"/>
to Humble our selves before the LORD; and to call all Per∣sons
in this National Church, to Humiliation, Fasting and Prayer,
to turn to GOD in CHRIST our only Propitiation, and to Cry
Mightily to Him, that for the Blood of his Son, he would forgive
our Grievous Sins, give us a Sound and Understanding Heart, re∣move
our Spiritual Plagues, and to Unite us to GOD, and to one
another in him, that he would avert the deserved Wrath from these
sinful Lands, in Disappointing the Designs of our Bloody and Cruel
Enemies, defeat the threatned <HI>Invasion,</HI> maintain Peace and Truth
amongst us, bless the Gospel with Success, by the Effusion of his
Spirit, preserve Her Majesties Person; direct Her Councils, prosper
Her Arms by Sea and Land, and bring these Wars to so happy an
Issue, as may be for the Relief of our Oppressed Brethren abroad,
and the Security of the <HI>Protestant Churches.</HI></P>
<P>And the said <HI>Commission</HI> hereby Appoints the first <HI>Thursday</HI> of
<HI>April</HI> next, to be Religiously Observed in all the Congregations of
this National Church, as a Day of Solemn Fasting, Humiliation and
Prayer for the Causes above-mentioned; and Appoints the Ministers
of this Church to make Intimation of the Premisses, publickly from
their Pulpits upon the LORD's Day, immediately preceeding the
foresaid Day of Humiliation, and to be more particular in specifying
the Sins of these Lands, as they shall see Cause.</P>
<P>This <HI>Fast</HI> was Approv'd of by the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> and their Civil
Sanction given thereto.</P>
<P>And the Queen in Her <HI>Letter</HI> to the <HI>General Assembly</HI> 1708, did
shew Her Satisfaction with the <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Affection</HI> the <HI>Ministers</HI> of
this <HI>Church</HI> had shown at that Juncture.</P>
<P>The greatest Part of all the <HI>Presbyteries</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Synods,</HI>
Addressed the <HI>Queen</HI> also on the Subject of the <HI>Invasion;</HI> and the
<HI>General Assembly</HI> declared their Sentiments thereof, <HI>1st.</HI> In their
<HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Queens Letter. 2ly.</HI> In their <HI>Address</HI> to <HI>Her Maje∣sty.</HI>
And <HI>3ly.</HI> In their <HI>National Thanksgiving</HI> inserted in their
Printed Acts, pages 6, 8, 10, 12, 13.</P>
<P>Besides all this, many <HI>Parishes</HI> drew up <HI>Addresses</HI> to the <HI>Privy
Council,</HI> shewing their <HI>Resolution</HI> to venture their <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>For∣tunes</HI>
in Defence of <HI>Her Majesties Person</HI> and <HI>Government;</HI> and
Craving Leave to put themselves in a <HI>Posture</HI> of <HI>Defence;</HI> and in
many Places the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> did Subscribe for considerable <HI>Sums,</HI> to
be payed when called for, in order to buy <HI>Arms,</HI> and to maintain
<HI>Men</HI> for the Ends foresaid: Some Burgers in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Subscrib∣ed
to Maintain 50 <HI>Men,</HI> some 40, some 30, some 30, some 20, and some
who were Poorer Subscribed for Fewer, and all this was done by the
Advice, and with the Allowance of Persons Intrusted in the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI>
by <HI>Her Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not all, the Seasonableness of this <HI>Solemn Fast</HI> was
<PB N="xiv" REF="26"/>
such, and so Serviceable to the <HI>Government,</HI> being brought out at
the very Juncture of Time, when the <HI>Eyes</HI> both of <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Enemies
were upon them,</HI> that it must be acknowledged, it shewed not only the
<HI>Zeal</HI> of the <HI>Presbyterian Ministers</HI> for the <HI>Queen,</HI> the <HI>Government</HI>
and their Establisht Interest; but it shewed their <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Pru∣dence</HI>
in so happily timing an Action of that Determining Conse∣quence,
and taking the very Moment of its being most Effectual, as
well to Convince the <HI>Enemy,</HI> that they had nothing to expect that
Way, but the whole United Force of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> against them—To
satisfy the <HI>Government</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Nation, among <HI>whom
Jealousies of the Contrary had been Industriously spread</HI>—, that
the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> one and all would Declare against the <HI>Invaders;</HI>
—<HI>as also,</HI> to Settle and Determin such among themselves, <HI>if any
such were,</HI> who might be otherwise unfix'd in their <HI>Resolutions,</HI>
and doubtful what <HI>Course</HI> to take.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but the <HI>Ministers</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in their respective
<HI>Parishes,</HI> upon the Occasion of the said <HI>Fast,</HI> applyed themselves to
the Informing their <HI>People,</HI> what the real Views, and probable Con∣sequences
of this <HI>Attempt</HI> were, what was Threatned to their <HI>Church,</HI>
to their <HI>Establisht Religion,</HI> to their <HI>Liberties,</HI> to their <HI>Protestant
Succession,</HI> and to the <HI>Revolution;</HI> How, whatever the specious Pre∣tences
of Preserving the <HI>Establisht Church</HI> might be, <HI>Popery</HI> in Prin∣ciple,
and <HI>Tyranny</HI> in Practice were certainly Incompatible with the
<HI>Protestant Establishment</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was Founded in <HI>Liberty,</HI>
Depended upon <HI>Law,</HI> and could not Subsist, humanely speaking, but
upon the supported Basis of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> together; That the <HI>In∣vasion</HI>
was a Visible Appearance of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Popish Tyranny,</HI> the
same that for <HI>twenty eight</HI> Years, had Influenced the <HI>Councils</HI> and
<HI>Governments</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> while they Trampled on the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> Silenc'd their preaching <HI>Ministry,</HI> Persecuted and barba∣rously
Murthered their <HI>Innocent Brethren,</HI> and bid Defiance to the
<HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> and the <HI>Liberties</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> that these <HI>Days</HI> would
inevitably return upon them, and that all the <HI>Miseries</HI> they had for∣merly
felt, were Effectually contain'd in the Womb of an <HI>Invasion.</HI></P>
<P>By this Method the <HI>Ministers</HI> opened the Eyes of the whole <HI>Nation,</HI>
and the <HI>People,</HI> Rous'd by this happy Vigour in their <HI>Clergy,</HI> began to
stir every where; Immediately a new Face appear'd upon the <HI>Publick
Affairs,</HI> the General Dejection and Hesitation, which seemed before to
make the <HI>People</HI> look Dark and Unresolved, was quite Removed, and
nothing was to be seen among the <HI>Presbyterian Party</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI>
—but <HI>Associations, Addresses, Preparations</HI> for Fighting, fitting up
their <HI>Arms,</HI> and a Chearful resolved <HI>Temper</HI> of <HI>Fighting</HI> the <HI>French</HI>
where-ever they were to be found.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Ministers</HI> themselves were so Vigorous in this, that
they Caused their whole <HI>Parishes</HI> to Associate and Bind themselves,
One to another, and all together to the <HI>Government,</HI> to stand as one
Man against the <HI>Invaders.</HI></P>
<P>The Service this did the <HI>Government,</HI> the Encouragement it gave
<PB N="xv" REF="27"/>
<HI>in</HI> England, <HI>and the Discouragement it gave to the</HI> Jacobite Party <HI>at
that Juncture, was such, as the last especially will not easily forget;
—and I thought it very Useful to Transmit the</HI> Memory <HI>of it thus
to</HI> Posterity, <HI>that they may know how their</HI> Ancestors <HI>Acted in this</HI>
Great Affair, <HI>and how they ought to Act on the like Occasions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In</HI> this Posture the Affairs of this Island <HI>stood, when the</HI> French baf∣fled
by the immediate Hand of GOD's Providence, in missing their
Port, <HI>were pursued by the</HI> English <HI>Fleet, and made their Escape</HI> by the
Goodness of their Sails <HI>to</HI> Dunkirk, <HI>where their</HI> Troops <HI>were put on
Shore,</HI> and so the Expedition ended.</P>
<P><HI>The ten</HI> Battalions <HI>which came from</HI> Holland <HI>to</HI> New-Castle <HI>were not
at all landed, but went immediately back, and were in the Field again
Time enough to show themselves in the</HI> First of the Campaign—<HI>The</HI>
English Troops <HI>march'd back without entring into</HI> Scotland; <HI>The
Prisoners taken on Board the</HI> Salisbury <HI>were brought to</HI> Hull, <HI>and treated
as</HI> Prisoners of War, <HI>in Order to be sent over to</HI> Holland for
<HI>Exchange.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Lord</HI> Griffin, <HI>with the two Sons of the Earl of</HI> Middletoun, <HI>and</HI>
15 Irish reform'd Officers <HI>were carry'd to</HI> London; <HI>The three first were
committed to the</HI> Tower, <HI>and the</HI> Irish <HI>to</HI> Newgate, <HI>being to be Tryed,</HI>
as Traitors, <HI>against</HI> the Q U E E N, <HI>whose natural born Subjects they
appeared to be.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Lord</HI> Griffin <HI>having been formerly attainted and outlaw'd it need∣ed
not that he should be brought to any Tryal: but,</HI> being carryed up
to the QUEEN's Bench Bar <HI>he received</HI> Sentence of Death <HI>on the
Foot of the said Outlawry,</HI> without any Tryal;—<HI>However, the</HI>
Dauphin of France <HI>having wrot a particular Letter in his Behalf,</HI> to
the Duke of Marlborough <HI>to intreat the</HI> QUEEN's Mercy to him, <HI>and
that he</HI> (the Dauphin) <HI>made it his Request to the</HI> Queen, the Lord
<HI>Griffin</HI> being his Servant;—<HI>The said Lard</HI> Griffin <HI>was reprived
from Time to Time, and is yet living</HI> in the Tower, <HI>at the publishing
these Sheets.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Irish Officers <HI>also, and the Lord</HI> Middletoun's <HI>Sons remain yet</HI>
Prisoners.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, Great Heats and Disputes happened about the
Gentlemen who were taken up upon Suspition.—</P>
<P><HI>The Parliament,</HI> in the Heat of the Alarm, <HI>had passed a Bill suspen∣ding
the</HI> Habeas Corpus Act <HI>for a Time, so far as should concern the
Persons apprehended on this Account, and empowering the</HI> Queen <HI>to take
up, and keep in Prison, such Persons as there should be Ground to
suspect, were guilty of Confederating with, or Encouraging the</HI> In∣vaders.</P>
<P>Had the Gentlemen concerned, been apprehended in any other Juncture,
they would perhaps have had no other Trouble than to have lyen still, and
when the Thing had been over, have been released again, as was done at
that Time in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the Fury of our Divisions on either Hand run so high, that this
could not be: Some thought the Persons taken up had more Hand in the</HI>
Invasiou <HI>than appeared, and that they ought not too lightly to be let go,
<PB N="xvi" REF="28"/>
lest it might encourage both them and others to make the like Attempt a∣gain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And these were very warm for Prosecutions, and for proposing Rewards
to encourage Persons to come in to charge the</HI> Prisoners:—<HI>And would
have all Manner of</HI> Methods tryed to fasten something upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Others again</HI> Inveighed against the Ministry <HI>in</HI> Scotland, <HI>as having
partial and Party-Regards in the picking out</HI> such or such Persons <HI>to put
in Prison,</HI> on Pretence of this Suspicion, <HI>as might gratifie the private
Designs of particular Persons, either as to</HI> Private Picks and Personal
<HI>Revenge,</HI> or to prejudice their Interests in Elections, <HI>there being a new
Parliament then to be chosen.</HI></P>
<P>These Contentions, <HI>however grounded on either Side,</HI> had certainly
this Effect, that they gave a great deal of Trouble to the <HI>Prisoners,</HI>
which otherwise might have been avoided; For the <HI>Ministry</HI> seeing such
pointing at probable Guilt on one Hand, and such Complaints of Injustice
on the other, found it necessari to make the <HI>Proceedings more
formal,</HI>
and to have all the Gentlemen up to <HI>London,</HI>—That they might
either be prosecuted, or let out upon <HI>Bail:</HI> as the Council should di∣rect.</P>
<P>Ʋpon their corning up to <HI>London,</HI> they were all admitted to Bail, ex∣cept
<HI>Four</HI> who were committed to Prison, and mere after sent to <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
to be Tried; but these however were acquitted, <HI>the Lords of the
Justiciary</HI> and <HI>Her Majesties Advocate</HI> differing upon some Forms; par∣ticularly,
the Lords refusing to admit the <HI>Lord Advocate</HI> to produce
more Witnesses—after the first Day of <HI>Tryal.</HI></P>
<P>It is not my Business to enter into this Dispute, <HI>otherwise I could be
more large on this Head:</HI>—But the <HI>Government was so sen∣sible</HI>
of the Inconveniencies of the old Method of prosecuting upon <HI>Trea∣son,
from this Nicety,</HI> that presently upon this the <HI>Parliament</HI> resol∣ved
to bring in a Bill to make the Laws for <HI>Tryals, in Cases of Treason,</HI>
the same in <HI>Scotland</HI> as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>From this Period is also to be dated the Distractions which followed in
the Affair of Religion, <HI>and of which I think it is very material to speak,</HI>
because they have made a great Noise in the World, <HI>and every one is
not rightly apprised of the Thing</HI>—particularly many have enter∣tained
Prejudices against the good People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if they had been
Acted by a <HI>Spirit of Fassion and Persecution,</HI> when indeed, upon a full
and clear Examination of the Matter of Fact the contrary will evident∣ly
appear; And therefore I could not satisfie my self without do∣ing
this Piece of Justice to the Church and People of <HI>Scotland,</HI>—as
to give an impartial Relation of the Fact, as it is attested out of the pub∣lick
Registers, by the proper Officers: and being myself an Eye and Ear-Witness
to every part of the <HI>Proceeding.</HI></P>
<P>About the and of <HI>February 1707-08,</HI> Her Majesty by Her Letter
to the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> gave Notice of the intended In∣vasion,
back'd with a <HI>French</HI> Power, design'd against <HI>Scotland;</HI> recom∣mending
to them the Security of the Kingdom, the Preservation of the
Publick Peace, and that they would use all possible Means to that Effect.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="29"/>
The Privy Council taking this Affair into their ConsIderation, it natu∣rally
occur'd; That to discourage the Enemies of the Government at
Home, Was <HI>among others,</HI> one of the hest Steps to prevent the mischiev∣ous
Consequences of an <HI>Invasion</HI> from Abroad; and in order to this, that
it rvas reasonable to suppress the publick Meetings of those, who under
pretence of Divine Worship, admitted such Ministers to officiate, as the
Law in that Case had prohibited, having not qualifyed themselves by tak∣ing
the Oaths, praying for the QUJEEN, &amp;c. by which the Publick
Disaffection was upheld and encourag'd.</P>
<P>It was then agreed to <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> in the Privy-Council;
<HI>and for the Truth of which we refer our Reader to the Minutes of
the Council for Proof;</HI> That Orders should be Issued out to all inferiour
Magistrates, to put this Resolve in Execution; and Orders were accord∣ingly
Issued out to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> far that Purpose, who
thereupon Legally called before them several Ministers or Preachers, who
were known to keep Publick Meeting-Houses within their Bounds—Asking
them plainly in Terms of Law, If they prayed for Her
Majesty
NOMINATIM, in their Publick Meeting-Houses; and if they had qua∣lifyed
themselves by taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and subscribing the
same with the <HI>Assurance,</HI> as the law requir'd?</P>
<P>Some of them answer'd directly, but others avoiding the Question,
re∣quir'd
a Legal Tryat, by way of Libel and Proof; which was accordingly
Appointed, and whereof the precise Points were, their not taking the
<HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and subscribing the same with the <HI>Assrance;</HI> their
not praying for Her Hajesty NOMINATIM, as the Law requires; and
their not observing <HI>Publick Fasts</HI> and <HI>Thanksgivings;</HI> all which were
Notour, and being <HI>Negatives</HI> proved themselves.</P>
<P>To this Libel the foresaid Preachers made Answers, and also took a
Protest, That they were not legally cited, not being catl'd either on fifteen
Days as the old Law requires, or on ten Days, as the late Act of Parlia∣ment
against <HI>Intruders</HI> prescribes.</P>
<P>To which it was Answered, That as to the fifteen Days, the known and
perpetual Custom within Burgh had over-ruled it to <HI>twenty four</HI> Hours;
and as to the ten Days, they were only appointed in the Tryal of <HI>Intruders.</HI>
But the Preachers call'd, being conveen'd for notour Disaffection by not
Praying, and by not taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> nor keeping <HI>Fasts</HI>
and <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> the <HI>Citations</HI> were good, and the <HI>Procedure</HI> un∣questionable;
and yet the <HI>Magistrates</HI> thought fit to give them a farther
<HI>Indulgence,</HI> and to allow them to give in all their <HI>Defences.</HI></P>
<P>The Sum of which <HI>Defences,</HI> as contain'd in a <HI>Representation</HI> exhibit
by the said Preachers, being first the foresaid <HI>Dilators</HI> to this, they added,
That by the Act of <HI>Parliament</HI> 1693, Requiring all <HI>Ministers</HI> and
<HI>Preachers</HI> to take the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> It is provided, that the
<HI>Contraveener</HI> shall be Punish'd by Banishment, or otherways as the <HI>Privy∣Council</HI>
should think sit, and therefore the <HI>Libel</HI> was imprtperly tabled
before the <HI>Magistrates.</HI></P>
<P>It was Answer'd, To the <HI>first Dilators,</HI> that the former Answers
were repeated; And to the second. That the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> having
<PB N="xviii" REF="30"/>
refer'd the Execution to the <HI>Magistrates,</HI> there could he no more <HI>De∣bate</HI>
about their <HI>Competency</HI> on that <HI>Head.</HI></P>
<P>But then they went on to Object against the Relevancy. And
as to the Act of the <HI>Convenion,</HI> Ordaining all <HI>Ministers</HI> to Pray
for the KING and QUEEN <HI>Nomination,</HI> They Answer'd, That that
Act did die and expire with King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY.</HI>
And as to the Act 1693, Ordaining all <HI>Preachers</HI> to take the <HI>Oath</HI> of
<HI>Allegiance,</HI> and Sign the same with the <HI>Assurance;</HI> They Answer'd
<HI>First,</HI> That that <HI>Act</HI> did only concern <HI>Ministers</HI> provided to Benefices
and Stipends; and could net be extended to suck <HI>Preachers,</HI> as enjoy
no Benefice under the <HI>Government;</HI> And <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Act Recog∣nizing
Her Majesty Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI> enjoyns the Taking of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> &amp;c. to such as are in publick Trust, and <HI>Preachers</HI>
not benefie'd cannot be said to be in any publick Trust; And <HI>Thirdly,</HI>
The <HI>Act Parliament</HI> 1693, limited to the Persons of King <HI>WILLI∣AM</HI>
and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> is out of Doors with them.</P>
<P>To which it was Reply'd, That the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Convention,</HI> Ordaining
all <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI> to Pray for the KING and QUEEN <HI>No∣minatim,</HI>
certainly to be understood likeways, of all their Royal Suc∣cessors,
specially since it is so plainly founded upon the Command of the
<HI>Apostle,</HI> and the Duties of all <HI>Subjects. Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> 1693,
expresly relates to all <HI>Preachers,</HI> whether Benefie'd or not, and withal
Defines all <HI>Preachers</HI> to be Persons in publick Trust; so that the <HI>Act</HI>
recognizing Her Majesty did exactly fall within it, and affords no
Relief to the <HI>Defenders.</HI> And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> 1693, tho' it men∣tion
King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> yet is not limited to them,
but being a perpetual Law extends to all their Royal <HI>Succellors;</HI>
Likeas by the said <HI>Act</HI> recognizing Her Majesty it is <HI>de facto</HI> so ex∣tended.</P>
<P>Which <HI>Defences</HI> and <HI>Replies</HI> being Read and Considered by the
<HI>Magistrates,</HI> they repell'd the <HI>Dilators,</HI> as also all the other <HI>Defences</HI>
proponed for the <HI>Defenders,</HI> and found, that since they had not Pray'd
for Her Majesty Queen <HI>ANNE, Nominatim,</HI> and taken the <HI>Oath</HI> of
<HI>Allegiance,</HI> &amp;c. they had incur'd the Pains of Law, and therefore
Ordain'd them, and every one of them, to desist from keeping of any
Meeting-Houses within the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Liberties thereof,
and from Preaching or Exercising any Part of the <HI>Ministerial Functi∣on</HI>
within the same in Time coming, under the Pain of Imprisonment,
and to find Caution for that Effect betwixt and the 30th Day of
<HI>March</HI> then instant, and in the mean Time that their <HI>Meeting-Houses,</HI>
be forthwith shut up. But tho' this <HI>Sentence</HI> was then past, yet nothing
follow'd upon it, until that the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> being de∣termin'd
by an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> after the 1st of <HI>May,</HI> these Dis∣affected
<HI>People</HI> judging, that the <HI>Councils</HI> Orders were also ex∣pir'd
with the <HI>Council</HI> that gave them, did about the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>June</HI>
fall again to their <HI>Preaching,</HI> and enter'd their <HI>Meeting-Houses.</HI> And
further they resolv'd among themselves, that they would continue to
Preach and not Desist; which mov'd the <HI>Magistrates</HI> to renew the
former <HI>Prohibition</HI> about the said <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> last, which they still
<PB N="xix" REF="31"/>
Neglecting and Despising, they were again call'd before the <HI>Magistrates</HI>
about the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> and requir'd to find <HI>Caution</HI> or <HI>Bail</HI> to Desist,
as being the known legal Execution upon such prohibitory Sentences,
or otherways to go to <HI>Prison.</HI> But they still refusing to obey, the
Magistrates thought sit on the <HI>13th</HI> to send Five only to <HI>Prison,</HI> which
Five were also at length reliev'd; so indulgent were the <HI>Magistrates</HI>
in this Matter.</P>
<P>This whale <HI>Trial,</HI> and all the Steps thereof, being transmitted to
<HI>Her Majesty,</HI> it pleased <HI>Her Majesty</HI> by Her Royal Letters under Her
Hand and Seal of the 18th of <HI>September</HI> last, to approve what was
done by the <HI>Magistrates</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the said Matter, as ac∣ceptable
Service; and further to judge it necessary for the Safety of
Her <HI>Royal Person</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> that all such <HI>Meeting-Houses</HI> in
every other Place Jboztld be shut up.</P>
<P>Thus far the Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>It is most true, that in this first <HI>Prosecutiot,</HI> there was no other
or further <HI>Design,</HI> than the giving a <HI>Check</HI> to the <HI>Invasion,</HI> and to the
<HI>Insolence</HI> of some of the <HI>non jurant Party,</HI> who at that Time began to
be more formidable in <HI>Scotland</HI> than in <HI>England;</HI> and this is apparent
in the Lenity and Forbearance of the <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Justices</HI> of the
<HI>Peace</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who as soon as the <HI>Invasion</HI> was over, and the
<HI>Danger</HI> from abroad seem'd at an <HI>End,</HI> were very easy with them
again, the <HI>Ministers</HI> who bad been Confined were silently let go, and
their former <HI>Liberty</HI> canniv'd at again; so that their <HI>Meetings</HI>
became as frequent as they were before, notwithstanding they still re∣fused
to take the <HI>Oaths,</HI> or Pray for the QUEEN.</P>
<P>But here it began to appear, that there were some among those
<HI>People,</HI> who had other <HI>Aims</HI> in these things, than meerly the <HI>Liberty</HI>
of their <HI>Consciences,</HI> and the <HI>Worshiping</HI> GOD—; and that some∣thing
ought to be attempted to make the <HI>People Uneasy,</HI> and to bring
them by <HI>Force</HI> to Prosecute and Attack them.</P>
<P>And to this End, since refusing the <HI>Oaths,</HI> since refusing to Pray for
the QUEEN, nay actually praying for the PRETENDER, would not
provoke the <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Magistrates</HI> in Scotland to Persecute
—; They find out another <HI>Expedient,</HI> which they are assured
will not fail, being what they know the <HI>Scots</HI> will not bear, what
ever it Cost them; and this was Erecting the <HI>Common Prayer</HI> or
<HI>English Liturgy</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>People</HI> that made this <HI>Attempt,</HI> behoved to get some Body to
do it; that however <HI>Jacobite</HI> he might be in <HI>Principle,</HI> was yet La∣titudinarian
enough in Conscience, that he could swallow all the <HI>Oaths</HI>
which should be offered to him—; Indeed some of the <HI>Jacobite
Clergy</HI> were so honest, that as they would not take the <HI>Oaths,</HI> so
they did not approve of this <HI>Attempt,</HI> but openly Disavowed it—;
Nor had the <HI>Episcopal People</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> ever set up the <HI>English Li∣turgy,</HI>
altgo they had Reign'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> for <HI>twenty eight</HI> Years to∣gether,
before the <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>But the Design being concerted, they found a Tool; a <HI>poor Curate</HI>
of 15 lib. a Year in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but born in <HI>Scotland,</HI> comes over to
<PB N="xx" REF="32"/>
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> to mend his <HI>Commons;</HI> and having taken the <HI>Oaths,</HI> he
falls in with this <HI>Party,</HI> who finding him a Person of prostituted
<HI>Morals,</HI> a large Stock in the face, and ready, if well-paid, to do their
Work, they promise him <HI>Fourscore Pound</HI> a Year, and accordingly
begin a <HI>Subscription</HI> for it.</P>
<P>Some <HI>English Gentlemen</HI> had, it seems, promised him some <HI>En∣couragement</HI>
towards that <HI>Sum</HI> to be raised—, and this they make
a Handle of presently, and Reported that this was set up to Accom∣modate
the <HI>English Strangers</HI> who could not Conform to the <HI>Presby∣terian
Church.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>English Gentlemen</HI> seeing into the Design, and that they
were to be made a Property to Embroil the <HI>Government,</HI> and soment a
<HI>Division</HI> between the Two lately <HI>United Nations;</HI> They soon aban∣doned
him and his <HI>Design</HI>—; However, be resolved to put his <HI>Project</HI>
in Execution, and accordingly takes a <HI>House</HI> just at the <HI>Cross</HI> in
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> sits it put for a <HI>Chapel,</HI> and begins to Read the <HI>English
Service.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>People,</HI> as every Body knew they would, immediately took Fire
at the thing—; But not doing him the Honour to Rabble him, <HI>which
seem'd to be what his Party expected;</HI> they Complain to the <HI>Magi∣strates</HI>—;
The Person that had let him the <HI>House,</HI> finding what
Use he was putting it to, began with him, and <HI>on Pretence of his
having made some Spoil in pulling down. Partitions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>not Autho∣rized
by his Contract</HI>—, Gets him Turn'd out of the <HI>House,</HI> and
so he betakes himself to a Place less publick, but still goes on with his
Service-Book Worship; However it gave less Offence here, the other
seeming to be a Defyance of the <HI>Laws;</HI> It happened at this Time, or
in a few Days after, that the <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>General Assembly</HI>
was to meet—, as soon as they sat down, a <HI>Representation</HI> or
<HI>Address</HI> is made to them by the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and other
Places against this thing; The <HI>Paper</HI> mentions other <HI>Complaints</HI>
indeed, but this was the Main Thing aim'd at—: The <HI>Address</HI> is
as follows.</P>
<P>Unto the very Reverend and Honourable, The <HI>Commission</HI>
of the late <HI>General Assembly</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>We the Neighbourhood of the Town of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and
<HI>Suburbs</HI> Under-Subscribers, Do most Humbly Represent,</P>
<P>THAT notwithstanding the many Good <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI>
and Particularly the <HI>Act</HI> 6 and 7 <HI>Par.</HI> 1707, made
for the <HI>Settlement</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> of this <HI>National Church,</HI> and against
all <HI>Incroachments</HI> upon her <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Privileges,</HI> or <HI>Innovations</HI> in her
<HI>Doctrine, Worship, Discipline</HI> or <HI>Government;</HI> And of Her Majesties
repeated Assurances in Her <HI>Royal Proclamations, Letters</HI> to Her <HI>Privy
Council,</HI> and the <HI>General Astemblies</HI> of this Church, to Maintain and
Defend the same in its present Establishment, against all such unlawful
Intrusions, Incroachments, and <HI>Innovations,</HI> particularly Her Maje∣sties
<PB N="xxi" REF="33"/>
Proclamations against unlawful <HI>Intruders</HI> into <HI>Churches</HI> and
<HI>Manses</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Dated <HI>Sept.</HI> 20th 1708.</P>
<P>Yet to our very great <HI>Surprise,</HI> severai of the <HI>Episcopal Clergy,</HI> Promp∣ted
and Instigate thereunto by the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, who are equally Disaf∣fected
to the <HI>Civil</HI> at to the <HI>Ecclesiastical Constitution,</HI> have of late, not
only Erected <HI>Meeting Houses</HI> in this <HI>City</HI> after the <HI>Scots Episcopal Way,</HI>
But also in several Places here, have set up the <HI>English Service,</HI> which
as it is Contrair to our <HI>Establishment,</HI> and very Grievous and Offensive to
us, and all others who are wed Affected to <HI>Her Majesty,</HI> and the <HI>Present
Establishment,</HI> so it will prove of Fatal and Dangerous <HI>Consequence</HI> to
the <HI>Church,</HI> if not speedily Remeeded.</P>
<P>It would be Considered in the first Place, That several of such as preach
in these <HI>Meeting Houses,</HI> are known not only to be <HI>Unfound</HI> in their
<HI>Judgments;</HI> But also <HI>Scandalous</HI> and <HI>Immoral</HI> in their <HI>Lives</HI> and
<HI>Practices:</HI> And however they may pretend to be <HI>Qualified</HI> according to
<HI>Law;</HI> Yet if they were not <HI>Secret</HI> and <HI>Heart Enemies</HI> to <HI>Her Majesty,</HI>
and the <HI>present Government,</HI> they would never Yield themselves Tools to
a <HI>Jacobite Party,</HI> for carying on their wicked and pernicious <HI>Designs.</HI></P>
<P>2ly. They cannot pretend it to be a <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> in setting
up of the <HI>English Service</HI> here, for Abstracting from <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> even
the <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Bulk</HI> of the <HI>Episcopal Perswasion</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> have never
been Fond of the <HI>English Way of Worship;</HI> But upon many Occasions
have Testified their <HI>Dislike</HI> of same, and none of them Scruple to Joyn
in <HI>Communion</HI> with this <HI>Church,</HI> but such as are either openly <HI>prophane,</HI>
and will not Subject to <HI>Church Discipline,</HI> or avowed <HI>Jacobites.</HI> And
therefore,</P>
<P>3ly. We conceive, that by these Illegal and Unwarrantable <HI>Incroach∣ments,
Intrusions</HI> and <HI>Innovations,</HI> they design no less than the Ruine of
both <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State;</HI> for as the sitting up of the <HI>English Service</HI> here,
did in former Times breed much <HI>Trouble</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> in this <HI>Church</HI>
and <HI>Nation,</HI> so at present it does Raise and Foment <HI>Jealousies</HI> and
<HI>Heart-burnings</HI> in the Minds of People, otherwise Zealously Affected to
<HI>Her Majesties Person</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> and exceedingly Widens the
<HI>Breach</HI> betwixt us, and the separating Parties on both Hands; And the
Instigators to, and <HI>Abbettors</HI> of these Practices are in big Hopes, and
not without too good and evident Grounds, that this will prove an effectual
Mean of Alienating the <HI>Hearts</HI> and <HI>Affections</HI> of many of our <HI>Queens</HI> best
and most Loyal <HI>Subjects</HI> from <HI>Her Majesties</HI> Person, and the <HI>present Esta∣blishment,</HI>
and that by this Means they shall effectually Wound &amp; Weaken
the <HI>Church</HI> on both Sides, and also Ruine the <HI>Civil Government.</HI></P>
<P>We Must also humbly <HI>Represent,</HI> That albeit we have many Good and
laudable <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> against Popery and Ppists,
Their Trafficking and Preaching in <HI>Scotland,</HI> particularly against their
Teaching of any <HI>Science, Art</HI> and Exercise within the same, and against
all <HI>Irreligion</HI> and <HI>Blasphemies,</HI> yet Papists do Openly and Avowedly
<HI>Teach</HI> and Practise even within the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Suburbs;
And now also, a Prophane and Deluded <HI>Crew</HI> of <HI>Enthusiasts</HI> are set up
in this Place, who under Pretence to the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Prophecy, do utter most
borrid Blasphemies against the <HI>Ever Glorious TRINITY,</HI> such as ought
not to be Suffered in any <HI>Christian Church,</HI> or <HI>Nation,</HI> seing this strikes
at the very Root and Vitals of all <HI>Religion,</HI> and is set on Foot of <HI>Satan</HI>
to Confound (if possible) all solid Thoughts of a <HI>DEITIE</HI> amongst us.</P>
<P>We have for <HI>Brevities</HI> sake, <HI>Represented</HI> but Few of the Many In∣conveniencies,
that will certainly follow the Suffering of such Practices;
And do judge it our <HI>Duty,</HI> in all Humility to lay them before <HI>Reve∣rend
Commission,</HI> seing you are set by the <HI>Church of Scorland,</HI> upon
<PB N="xxii" REF="34"/>
the <HI>Watch Tower</HI> to Advert, that the <HI>Interest</HI> of <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> and
the <HI>present Establishment</HI> of this <HI>Church,</HI> do not Suffer or Sustain any
Prejudice which you can Prevent; Particularly to take special Care to
Keep and Maintain <HI>Unity</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> upon all <HI>Emergent;</HI> And to
see the due <HI>Execution</HI> of the <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Assembly,</HI> which are very plain and
Express against such <HI>Innovations</HI> in the <HI>Worship</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> Particularly
tbe Act 15 <HI>General Assembly</HI> 1707. And therefore, humbly and ear∣nestly
Beg and Entreat, That as you Tender the <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> the
Peace and <HI>Unity</HI> of this <HI>Church,</HI> and the <HI>Quiet</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> of <HI>Her Ma∣jesties
Government,</HI> you would use your <HI>Outmost Endeavours</HI> for Sup∣pressing
and Crushing such Intolerable and Pernicious Practices and <HI>Designs</HI>
in the <HI>Bud.</HI></P>
<CLOSER>And your <HI>Supplicants</HI> shall ever Pray, &amp;c.</CLOSER>

<DIV1>
<P>This <HI>Address</HI> was Signed in less than three Hours, by between
<HI>Two</HI>
and <HI>Three Hundred</HI> People; the like <HI>Address</HI> came from <HI>Hadding∣toun,</HI>
and the like were preparing almost all over the <HI>Kingdom</HI>—,
but this having an immediate <HI>Answer</HI> in the <HI>Application</HI> of the <HI>Com∣mission</HI>
of the <HI>Assembly</HI> to the <HI>Remedy,</HI> the other <HI>Addresses</HI> were laid by.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>Assembly</HI> immediately fell upon the <HI>Work,</HI>
and past an <HI>Act,</HI> in which among other things, they Asserted the
<HI>Legal Establishment</HI> of their <HI>Church</HI> by the <HI>Revolution,</HI> by subsequent
<HI>Laws,</HI> and those <HI>Laws,</HI> receiving the <HI>General Sanction</HI> of the <HI>Union</HI>
—, against all Manner of <HI>Innovation;</HI> in just Execution of which
<HI>Laws,</HI> they referr'd it to the Respective <HI>Judicatories</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI>
such as <HI>Kirk Sessions,</HI> or <HI>Presbyteries,</HI> to Proceed forthwith against
such <HI>Innovations,</HI> or <HI>Innovators</HI> as should be found in their Respective
<HI>Bounds.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Consequence</HI> of this <HI>Act,</HI> the <HI>Kirk Session</HI> of the North∣cast
<HI>Parish</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> called commonly the <HI>College Kirk,</HI> presented
this <HI>New come Innovator</HI> to the <HI>Presbytery</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who ac∣cordingly
Cited him before them.</P>
<P>I shall only give a Summary of their <HI>Proceedings</HI> against him, for
it is not their Form of <HI>Proceeding,</HI> but the Nature of the Thing that
seems to call for this prefatory <HI>Narration.</HI> It is to be Qbserved, that
the <HI>Presbytery</HI> did not Proceed against him upon the Subject of <HI>In∣novation,</HI>
or his having set up the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI>—at all, nor
was it once Mentioned to him, or in the <HI>Sentence</HI> of the <HI>Presbytery</HI>
—; But they first Demanded <HI>Who he Was, whence he Came,</HI> and
what <HI>Authority</HI> he had to Execute the <HI>Office</HI> of a <HI>Minister,</HI> and not
being able to produce any <HI>Legal Ordination,</HI> or <HI>Ministerial Induction,</HI>
Except from, the <HI>Exauctorate Deposed Bishops,</HI> to whom neither by
the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland's Constitution,</HI> or by the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> of
<HI>England's Constitution,</HI> any such <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Office</HI> remained—; they
Proceeded to their <HI>Sentence</HI> against him, Declaring him <HI>Uncapable</HI> to
Exercise any Part of the <HI>Ministerial Function</HI> in their <HI>Bounds.</HI>
He Declined their <HI>Authority,</HI> Treated them with <HI>Contempt,</HI> Re∣fused
to <HI>Appear</HI> at their <HI>Subsequent Citation</HI>—, they took no far∣ther
Notice of him, but sent a <HI>Copy</HI> of their <HI>Sentence</HI> to the Magistrates
<PB N="xxiii" REF="35"/>
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in order to the <HI>Civil Power</HI> putting it in
<HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P>In Pursuance of this <HI>Sentence,</HI> the Magistrates send for him, and gi∣ving
him <HI>Intimation</HI> of the Sentence of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> they give Notice
that he do not presume to Preach any more within the Bounds of the City,
on Pain of <HI>Imprisonment,</HI> &amp; gave him time to show his <HI>Obedience</HI> to their
<HI>Order:</HI> He carries himself with the same <HI>Haughtiness</HI> to the <HI>Magistrates,</HI>
tells them positively, That be would not obey them, and accordingly the
next <HI>Sabbath</HI> he Preaches openly in the City; nor yet would the <HI>Magistrates</HI>
have <HI>Committed</HI> him, had he not insolently triumphed in his
<HI>Contempt</HI> of their <HI>Authority,</HI> appeared openly at the Cross, to let them.
see that <HI>Contempt,</HI> and by all the Methods possible to him, insulted
them in the Affair of their <HI>Sentence.</HI></P>
<P>This brought the <HI>Magistrates</HI> to an absolute Necessity to <HI>Commits him,</HI>
in Vindication of their <HI>Authority,</HI> and that they might not give their
own <HI>Consent</HI> to be Trampled on by the whole Party; accordingly they
sent for him again, and still offering him his <HI>Liberty,</HI> upon <HI>Obedience</HI>
to their former <HI>Order,</HI> and the <HI>Sentence</HI> of the <HI>Presbytery</HI> which he ins∣ultingly
refused, they <HI>committed</HI> him to the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>It were very little worth while, to fill this <HI>Preface</HI> with the Story of
this Person, were it not the Occasion of bringing upon the <HI>Stage
Debates</HI> of several kinds, which it seems necessary to set in a clear Light
to the World; in the Misrepresenting which, the <HI>Church</HI> as well as <HI>People</HI>
of <HI>Scotland</HI> really receive much Wrongs, to whom, I think, it is the Duty
of an honest <HI>Man,</HI> as well as of a faithful <HI>Historian,</HI> to do justice.</P>
<P>The Cases are such as these.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>Scots</HI> in these <HI>Prosecutions</HI> are not <HI>Persecutors for
Conscience?</HI></P>
<P>Whether the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Deposed <HI>Clergy,</HI> have yet a Right to
Ondain Ministers?</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the establish't
<HI>Church of England</HI> are at all of Kin, or no?</P>
<P>Whether <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and the <HI>English Liturgy</HI>
can be established in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or no?</P>
<P>I shall say something to all these, so far as Matter of <HI>Fact</HI> and a
Historical <HI>Narration</HI> requires, and something by <HI>Observation,</HI> as far as
the <HI>Civil Rights</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> are concerned, and thus far I think they
are proper to be spoken to by Way of <HI>Preface:</HI> As to the <HI>Theological</HI> part
of the Dispute, I shall have occasion to handle it elsewhere, neither can it
be reasonable to expect it here.</P>
<P>In taking Notice of the first of these <HI>Queries,</HI> Whether the <HI>Scots</HI> in
these <HI>Prosecutions</HI> are not <HI>Persecutors</HI> for <HI>Conscience?</HI></P>
<P>It may be alledged, That all <HI>Prosecutions</HI> of <HI>Law,</HI> where
the <HI>Offender</HI> pleads <HI>Conscience</HI> against his <HI>Obedience,</HI> are <HI>Pers∣ecutions</HI>
for <HI>Conscience—;</HI> And if this be brought by Way of
<HI>Argument</HI> in this Case, then my <HI>Answer</HI> is very brief; The
<HI>Scots,</HI> and with them all the <HI>Christian0 Nations</HI> in the World;
<PB N="xxiv" REF="36"/>
but especially the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> are <HI>Persecutors,</HI> and with∣out
Question ought to be so.</P>
<P>But if you will restrict the Term <HI>Persecution,</HI> to the generally
received <HI>Sense</HI> of it, <HI>vix.</HI> Disturbing, Prosecuting, and Pur∣suing
the peaceable <HI>Exercise</HI> of <HI>Religious Worship,</HI> perform'd
meerly in Obedience to the <HI>Dictates</HI> and <HI>Commands</HI> of <HI>Con∣science</HI>
—: Then I may safely challenge all the World in
Behalf of the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to shew the least Vestige or
Appearance of <HI>Persecution</HI> among them.</P>
<P>I think, while I am in this <HI>Argument,</HI> Addressing my self prin∣cipally
to the People of <HI>England,</HI> and among them to the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>England—,</HI> I can do nothing better, than bring their oven Practice
to a Parallel with the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as a strong and convincing
Way of arguing, <HI>to them especially,</HI> in the Case I am upon; <HI>And
First,</HI> I take the Authority of the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>England</HI> against <HI>Perse∣cution,</HI>
in the great <HI>Act</HI> for Settlement of the <HI>Toleration,</HI> where it is
said, <HI>Whereas it is reasonable, that all just Tenderness should be
shown to Tender</HI> Consciences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then in the <HI>Preamble</HI> of the late
famous <HI>Occasional Bill,</HI> are these words, “<HI>Whereas</HI> Persecution for Con∣science
<HI>sake, is contrary to the Principles of the</HI> Christian Religion,
<HI>and the</HI> Doctrine <HI>of the</HI> Church <HI>of</HI> England. Take these two, and
compare them with the <HI>Act I. WILLIAM</HI> and <HI>MARY Cap.</HI>—. By
which all those <HI>Ecclesiasticks</HI> who would not take the Oaths, are Deposed,
and Deprived <HI>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio;</HI> and it will necessarily follow,
at least in my Opinion, that either the <HI>Church of England</HI> in Deposing
the <HI>Non Jurant Clergy</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> acts <HI>contrary to her own</HI>
Doctrine <HI>and the Principles of the</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>ut</HI> supra: <HI>OR,
That Deposing</HI> and Depriving the <HI>Non Jurant Bishops,</HI> &amp;c. Is not Pers∣ecutian
<HI>for</HI> Conscience.</P>
<P>I humbly refer this to the <HI>Determination</HI> of all that shall Read im∣partially
if it be not clear and fairly stated.</P>
<P>If then Deposing and Depriving the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI> who refuse to take the <HI>Oaths</HI> to the <HI>Government,</HI> be not
<HI>Persecutions;</HI> it remains for the other Party to prove, that the same thing
in <HI>Scotland</HI> can be called <HI>Persecution,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> no <HI>Persecution.</HI></P>
<P>The Deposing <HI>Episcopacy</HI> it self in <HI>Scotland,</HI> seems to come in Que}stion
here, and would require a long Discourse—; But as I am
speaking chiefly to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in this Case, I am very wil∣ling
to make her a Judge—, and I presume it will be arguing ad ho∣minem,
to say, tho' I do not lay the Stress here neither.</P>
<P>That Deposing <HI>Episcopacy</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Deposing <HI>Popery</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
stand in many Cases upon the same Foot—, and the <HI>Church</HI>
of <HI>Scotland</HI> has offered little or no <HI>Violence</HI> to the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> in
<HI>Scotland;</HI> But what the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> has offered to the <HI>Roman
Catholicks</HI> in <HI>England—:</HI> Now tho' in General this would be
no Argument, yet 'tis a Reason in this Case, why the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>England,</HI> above all other, ought not to charge the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>
with <HI>Persecution</HI> in that particular—. But to go further, the
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> did not immediately pull down Episcopacy—,
<PB N="xxv" REF="37"/>
I mean, the <HI>Church</HI> abstractly considered in her <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Circum∣stances—;
But it was done by the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Body
of the People, I mean the <HI>Parliament</HI> before the <HI>Presbyterian Church</HI> was
Established—. And it is evident <HI>by the Claim of Right,</HI> that <HI>Episco∣pacy</HI>
was turn'd out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> not as a thing Establisht, but as an <HI>Intrud∣er</HI>
upon the Established <HI>Religion,</HI> which <HI>Scotland</HI> had from the very <HI>Re∣formation</HI>
Embrac't, which they had Sworn in their <HI>National Cove∣nant
to maintain,</HI> and which by <HI>Law</HI> it was their Right to restore; in
short <HI>Episcopacy</HI> was turn'd out as a Man who has had his Estate ta∣ken
from him by <HI>Oppression,</HI> recovers his <HI>Right</HI> by <HI>Law,</HI> and then Disf∣possesses
the wrongful <HI>Incroacher</HI> or <HI>Invader,</HI> and enters upon his oven.</P>
<P>Universal <HI>History</HI> will allow, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Reform'd first into the
<HI>Geneva</HI> Model, by the Agency of the famous <HI>John Knox</HI> and others,
and that they had no <HI>Episcopacy</HI> in their first Establishment at all; nor
can all the Labour that has been spent to make the <HI>Superintendents,</HI> who
were sent into the several Parts of the Kingdom, to settle <HI>Ecclesiastick</HI>
Affairs, <HI>look like Bishops</HI>—, for this will for ever supercede that
Suggestion, <HI>viz.</HI> That these <HI>Superintendents,</HI> tho' Vested with <HI>Power</HI>
over the <HI>Ministers</HI> they went to Visit—, yet received that <HI>Power</HI>
from, and exercised it in Subordination to the <HI>General Assembly</HI> of the
<HI>Presbyterian Church</HI>—, and were often called to an Account,
Censured, and Removed by the <HI>Synods,</HI> nay and some say, even by pri∣vate
<HI>Presbyteries,</HI> See <HI>Calderwood's History of the Church of</HI> Scotland
Fol.</P>
<P><HI>Episcopacy</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> being thus supposed an <HI>Invader</HI> and <HI>Spoiler,</HI>
the <HI>Revolution</HI> did no more than take from them their usurped <HI>Authority,</HI>
cause them to Disgorge what they had most unjustly devoured, and the In∣vader
having thus been turned out, the right <HI>Owners</HI> of the <HI>House</HI>
came again, and took Possession of their own; <HI>And this can by no means
be called</HI> Persecution.</P>
<P>My second Enquiry is upon <HI>a new Dispute,</HI> and I think admits of no
Difficulties in Matters of <HI>Law,</HI> whatever it may in Matters of <HI>Cons∣cience</HI>
—viz. <HI>Whether the Deposed Exauctorate</HI> Bishops <HI>have</HI>
Power <HI>left to Ordain</HI> Ministers—? Indeed the Question seems
rather to ly here, Whether such <HI>Preachers</HI> as shall be Licensed or Ordain∣ed
by the Exauctorate <HI>Bishops,</HI> ought to be esteeem'd as Ministers, espe∣cially
in that <HI>Church</HI> which has so Deposed them—? This being
the present Debate, it rather respects the <HI>Civil</HI> than <HI>Ecclcsiastick</HI> Part of
the Question.</P>
<P>It seems to me highly absurd, that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> should
receive as a <HI>Minister</HI> among then, a Man Qrdain'd <HI>BY HIM WHOM</HI>
they will not owne or receive as a <HI>Minister</HI> of their <HI>Church;</HI> for if the
<HI>Bishops</HI> after Deprivation shall Ordain Ministers, how then is that <HI>Bishop</HI>
Deprived <HI>AB OFFICIO</HI>—? Nor indeed do I know that the <HI>Church</HI>
of <HI>England</HI> has at all admitted this Absurdity among them—; The
thing is only started in <HI>Scotland</HI> to beget new Broils on that Head, and
it seems still wore absurd, that the <HI>Non Jurant Bishops</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>
should have <HI>Power</HI> to Ordain a <HI>Minister</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But to support this Absurdity, a worse is started among us, viz. That
the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is Incorporated into the <HI>Church</HI> of
<PB N="xxvi" REF="38"/>
<HI>England</HI> by the <HI>UNION,</HI> and this is the <HI>Reason</HI> of my Third En∣quiry.</P>
<P>3. Whether the <HI>Episcopal Church of Scotland,</HI> and the present
<HI>Establisht Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> are at all of <HI>Kin,</HI> or no?</P>
<P>This <HI>Enquiry,</HI> if it be directly Trac'd, will lead to a New <HI>Questi∣on,
viz.</HI> What is to be Meant by the <HI>Church of</HI> England? <HI>I mean in
this Quefsion onely</HI>—, and therefore I shall <HI>Answer</HI> it both Ways
very briefly.</P>
<P>If by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> we mean, The <HI>Church</HI> as now Establish'd,
or rather Recognized by the <HI>Revolution</HI>—, and now <HI>Re∣ceiv'd</HI>
and <HI>Acknowledged</HI> by the <HI>QUEEN</HI> and <HI>Parliament;</HI> Then
indeed this pretended <HI>Incorporation,</HI> is an <HI>Absurdity</HI>—, and there
is no more any such things, than there is an <HI>Incorporation</HI> between
<HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>Baal;</HI> for the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> so <HI>Understood</HI> has spued
the other out as <HI>Illegal,</HI> has Rejected Her as <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and has joyn'd
in and Consented to <HI>by the UNION,</HI> the <HI>Establishment</HI> of the <HI>Pres∣byterian
Church</HI> in her Stead, and upon her Ruines, as the <HI>True Pro∣testant
Religion,</HI> and <HI>Establisht National Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland, vide</HI>
the Act of <HI>UNION,</HI> and from this Stipulation, she (the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>England</HI>) her self, can not go back—; But if on the other Hand,
by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> is to be understood the <HI>Dodwellian-Jaco∣bite
-Faction</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> who refuse to own either the <HI>Religous</HI> or
<HI>Civil Establishment</HI> now Reigning in <HI>Britain,</HI> esteeming the QUEEN
an <HI>Usurper,</HI> the <HI>Revolutions a Rebellion,</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England
Schismatical—,</HI> if <HI>thus they Understand</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI>
then they and the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> may for ought I
know, be <HI>Incorporated</HI> into each other, and may be esteemed <HI>One
Body</HI>—; and <HI>they are welcome to be so accounted:</HI> But how
this is done by the <HI>Union,</HI> remains for those <HI>Gentlemen</HI> who pretend
to it to make <HI>Out.</HI></P>
<P>I think, I need not Descend to many <HI>Arguments</HI> in this Case, the
Case is evident, the <HI>Episecopal Church</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> being entirely <HI>Ja∣cobite</HI>
at this Time can not be said to <HI>Incorporate</HI> with the <HI>Church</HI>
of <HI>England,</HI> who Acknowledge <HI>Queen ANNE,</HI> because they <HI>Reject</HI>
Her as <HI>Schismatical</HI> and <HI>Apostate—,</HI> and that they can <HI>Reject</HI> Her,
and be <HI>Incorporated</HI> into Her at the same Time, seems <HI>Impracticable</HI>
and <HI>Absurd.</HI></P>
<P>It remains to Enquire, <HI>whether</HI> Episcopacy <HI>and the</HI> English Liturgy
<HI>may not be Tolerated in</HI> Scotland—; and here I shall wave the
various <HI>Arguments</HI> about the <HI>Necessity</HI> and <HI>Obligation</HI> which lyes on
all <HI>Christians</HI> to pay <HI>Reverence</HI> to <HI>Conscience,</HI> and in Order to give
all possbe <HI>Liberty</HI> to <HI>Religious Opinions</HI>—; but I shall lay the
Stress of my present <HI>Arguing</HI> another way.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Speaking of <HI>Scotland,</HI> we are to Distinguish between Tolerat∣ing
of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and Tolerating of <HI>Jacobitism</HI>—, and if this be
Distinguisht right here, we shall have little need of the <HI>Question at
all—;</HI> And in the Name of the <HI>Scots,</HI> I may very well say to the
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England—, Gentlemen,</HI> when you please to Tolerate
<HI>Jacobitism</HI> by <HI>Law</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> we will Consider of Tolerating E∣piscopacy
<PB N="xxvii" REF="39"/>
in <HI>Scotland—,</HI> and ibis way of <HI>Arguing</HI> seems very just,
because if you please to Abstract <HI>Jacobitism</HI> from <HI>Episcopacy</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
you will leave no <HI>Episcopacy</HI> there, but what is already To∣lerated
by <HI>Law—, viz.</HI> by the Act the first <HI>Perliament</HI> WIL∣LIAM
<HI>and</HI> MARY, which Ordained that all those <HI>Episecopal Ministers</HI>
who would take the Oaths should Continue in their <HI>Churches—, and
there they remain to this Day,</HI> a kind of <HI>Toleration</HI> much Superior
to that in <HI>England,</HI> for these Enjoy the <HI>Presbyterian Stipends</HI> and
<HI>Manfes—,</HI> and in same of their <HI>Parishes</HI> the <HI>Establisht Church Mi∣nisters</HI>
Preach by them in <HI>Meeting Houses</HI> to this Hour, as Mr. <HI>Ponton</HI>
in <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> and others, if the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> -will not call this
<HI>Toleration,</HI> they will find it hard to tell us what is <HI>Toleration.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Champions</HI> of this <HI>Toleration Project,</HI> finding this <HI>Argument</HI>
turned too Hard upon them—, have set up a New One—, and which
therefore I have added in the <HI>Question,</HI> and this is about Tolerat∣ing
the <HI>Common-Prayer Book</HI> in <HI>Scotland—,</HI> and this brings a New
<HI>Dispute</HI> upon the <HI>Stage—,</HI> a <HI>Dispute</HI> that seems to have more <HI>Policy</HI>
than <HI>Religion</HI> in it, and I doubt not but it will soon be <HI>Detected.</HI></P>
<P>That this is not a <HI>Case</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> but a <HI>Party Trick</HI> to Em∣broil,
will appear, if we Consider two or three Things.</P>
<P>1. That for <HI>twenty eight</HI> Years preceeding the <HI>Revolution</HI>
when the <HI>Episecopal Church</HI> was (humanely speaking) Tri∣umphant
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they never admitted of the <HI>English Liturgy</HI>
among them; nor was it ever Attempted for 100 Years before,
but once by Arch-bishop <HI>Laud</HI> and his <HI>Party,</HI> which <HI>Attempt</HI>
was the <HI>Overthrow</HI> of all the <HI>Contrivers,</HI> and it is more than
Probable may be so again, if they go on with it; This proves
it is not any part of the <HI>Profession</HI> of the <HI>Episecopal Church</HI> of
<HI>Scotland—,</HI> and therefore can not be said to be Demanded in
behalf of <HI>Conscience.</HI></P>
<P>2. From the <HI>Revolution</HI> to the Time of the <HI>Union,</HI> during
which Time the <HI>Episecopal non-jurant Clergy in Scotland,</HI> have
Erected several <HI>Meetings</HI> or <HI>Conventicles</HI> of their Party for <HI>Re∣ligious
Worship—,</HI> they have had very little Thought of the
<HI>English Liturey,</HI>—but what of it is come among them, is a
meer <HI>Innovation thrust</HI> in upon them by the Artifice of a <HI>Party,</HI>
in part to claim <HI>Kindred</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and partly
to Inflame and Enrage the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who they know
are <HI>Averse to it.</HI></P>
<P>3. At this is Time, while the <HI>Leaders</HI> of the <HI>Party</HI> are Impo∣sing
this upon the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>—; They
have some Difficulty to make their own <HI>People</HI> Agree to, and
Espouse it—, the thing is so far from being Desired by the
<HI>People</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that even these who frequent their <HI>Meetings,</HI>
that are Episcopal in <HI>Religious Principles,</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI> in <HI>Politick
Principles,</HI> yet Shun the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> Dislike it—, and are with
<HI>Difficulty</HI> and <HI>Reluctance</HI> brought to bear it; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nay in most Parts
they will not <HI>Comply</HI> with it, but <HI>Abandon</HI> those that Read it,
and Throng after those <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> that Decline it.</P>
<P><PB N="xxviii" REF="40"/>
These are Sufficient to make it appear, that the <HI>Attempt</HI> of Erecting
the <HI>Common Prayer-Book</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is not founded in the <HI>Consci∣ences</HI>
of the <HI>People—,</HI> That it is a <HI>Politck Design</HI> to carry on a <HI>Par∣ty</HI>
Interest among us in <HI>England,</HI> and Embroil, if possible, the <HI>People</HI>
Of <HI>Scotland</HI> with the <HI>Government,</HI> is evident from, the last <HI>Head,</HI>
that they are at Pains to bring their own <HI>People</HI> to Espouse it, which
if it were not to Serve their <HI>Civil Interest,</HI> it will be hard to Suggest
on what <HI>foundation</HI> they make the <HI>Attempt.</HI></P>
<P>But I come next to <HI>Enquire</HI> into the <HI>Civil Rights</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> as
they stand, either <HI>Supported</HI> or <HI>Invaded</HI> by this <HI>Attempt—;</HI> if
they the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has a <HI>Civil Right</HI> to the <HI>Ecclesiastick
Immunity</HI> she Enjoys, and that the <HI>Union</HI> had <HI>Confirmed</HI> these <HI>Rights,</HI>
then nothing can be Imposed upon her, against her present <HI>Settlement,</HI>
without Breach of the <HI>Union:</HI> And this I presume to say, No <HI>Hu∣mane
Authority</HI> now Establisht in <HI>Britain,</HI> can so much as attempt
without <HI>Dissolving</HI> the very <HI>Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>By the <HI>UNION</HI> then, and the sederal Acts of Parliament for the
<HI>Security</HI> of the <HI>Presbyterian Church,</HI> which are Confirmed by, and
made <HI>Part</HI> of that <HI>Union—;</HI> The <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> of the
<HI>Worship, Discipline</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is
to be Preserved to the <HI>People of</HI> Scotland WITHOUT ANY AL∣TERATION,
Mark these <HI>Words,</HI> I Repeat them again, WITHOUT
ARY ALTERATION to all <HI>Succeeding Generations.</HI></P>
<P>If any Man will say, That Tolerating the <HI>Common Prayer</HI> can
Consist with <HI>Preserving</HI> the <HI>Uniformity</HI> of the <HI>Worship—,</HI> or the
Tolerating <HI>Episcopacy</HI> can Consist with the preserving the <HI>Government</HI>
Of the <HI>Church,</HI> or either of them with Preserving the <HI>Discipline;</HI> then
I may be ready to Enquire further.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if they are not, then they cannot be offered to
the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> nor can even the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> Erect
such a <HI>Toleration</HI> without <HI>Invading</HI> the <HI>UNION,</HI> which I hum∣bly
conceive they have not <HI>Power</HI> to do.</P>
<P>Nor can the <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> legally give their <HI>Consent</HI>
to any such <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Toleration;</HI> because this <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> is
to be <HI>Preserved</HI> to all <HI>Succeeding Generations;</HI> and the present <HI>Ge∣neration</HI>
has no more <HI>Power</HI> to give up what by the <HI>Union</HI> is thus En∣tailed
on their <HI>Postcrity,</HI> than the <HI>Parliament</HI> can give up what is
Conceded to the said Present <HI>Generation.</HI></P>
<P>By this it seems, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is so Established,
that neither can her <HI>Enemies</HI> impose <HI>Toleration</HI> upon her; neither
can her Treacherous or Negligent <HI>Friends,</HI> too many of whomn she may
have in <HI>Power,</HI> give up her <HI>Claim</HI> to her Establishment; neither
can she her self Abandon her <HI>Right</HI> to, or her Possession of her <HI>Esta∣blishment,</HI>
Exclusive of all manner of <HI>Innovations</HI> or <HI>Invasions</HI> on the
<HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> of her <HI>Worship, Discipline</HI> or <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>This I think is the prsent State of the <HI>Question</HI> about <HI>Toleration.</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> what Gloss the Artifice of <HI>Enemies,</HI> and the Craft of
<HI>Parties</HI> may put upon the <HI>Attempts</HI> now making, of Invading the Pri∣vileges
of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I have nothing to do with in
<PB N="xxix" REF="41"/>
this <HI>Treatise;</HI> I am sure if the <HI>Representatives</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> are <HI>Faith∣ful</HI>
and <HI>Vigilant,</HI> she is in no <HI>Danger</HI>—; nor can Her <HI>Church Pri∣vileges</HI>
be Invaded by a <HI>Toleration,</HI> without Destroying the <HI>Civil</HI> as
well as <HI>Ecclesiastick Constitution,</HI> upon which whole <HI>Britain</HI> is at this
Time Establisht by the <HI>UNION.</HI></P>
<P>Two Things I find fall naturally in our Way as <HI>Objections</HI> (in <HI>England
especially,</HI>) when we <HI>argue</HI> against Tolerating the <HI>English Liturgy</HI>
in <HI>Scotland; First,</HI> That this is falling upon the <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI>
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Insulting the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>—; And <HI>Secondly,</HI> That this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word be Injurious to the <HI>Toleration</HI> which the <HI>Dissenters Enjoy in
England.</HI></P>
<P>It is most certain in strict justice, That tho' both these were true,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word takes nothing to the <HI>Argument.</HI> The <HI>Question</HI> is not of Civility
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> or of Prudentials to the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in
England, but of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Jostice</HI> to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>—, We
are here in a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Property</HI> Capitulated for by the <HI>UNION,</HI> Sti∣pulated
for, and Agreed to by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>no Alte∣ration
shall be made;</HI> that the <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity shall be Pre∣se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rved:</HI>
Either it is Preserved, or it is not—; If the <HI>Common
Prayer</HI> be Imposed on them; If <HI>Episcopacy</HI> be Tolerated, their <HI>Wor∣ship</HI>
and <HI>Government</HI> is Altered, or it is not—; if it be, then the
<HI>Union</HI> is Invaded, or it is not; the <HI>Questions</HI> are short, and need
no Cavilling—, tho' speaking of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and of the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI> may be Civil to one, and Careful
of the other; yet they must not give up their <HI>Establisht Rights</HI> on that
Sore this were to Complement them at too great an <HI>Expence—;</HI>
Would the <HI>Conscientious Episecopal People</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> be Easy, no
<HI>Body</HI> Molested them, they Enjoyed their <HI>Liberty</HI> Unmolested enough,
and in a manner which the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for many Tears would
have Rejoye'd at—; but when nothing will Satisfy, but <HI>Encroach∣ing</HI>
upon <HI>Declared</HI> and <HI>Establisht Righrs,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is
then bound to Assert her own <HI>Property,</HI> and neither the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>England</HI> or the <HI>Dissenters</HI> ought to take it ill from them.</P>
<P>But alter all, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> have no Reason to <HI>take it ill,</HI>
that the <HI>Scots</HI> do not make Use of the <HI>Common Prayer,</HI> any more
than the <HI>Scots</HI> have to <HI>take it ill,</HI> that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> do
not make Use of the <HI>Presbyterian Discipline;</HI> They are two <HI>National
Churches;</HI> Either of them have their respective <HI>Kingdom</HI> to which
they belong, <HI>Constitution on which they are built,</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> by which
they are Establisht; They are perfectly <HI>Independent</HI> one of another,
and have no <HI>Superiority</HI> over, or <HI>Subjection</HI> to one another—, They
are <HI>Consederated</HI> by the <HI>UNION,</HI> and the <HI>Butts</HI> and <HI>Bounds</HI> of their
respective <HI>Influence,</HI> are <HI>Stated</HI> and Irreversibly <HI>Determined,</HI> I say,
they are but Consederated, for it is no more, the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> are <HI>In∣corporated,</HI>
but the <HI>Churches</HI> are but <HI>Consederated;</HI> but the <HI>Links</HI>
of this <HI>Chain</HI> are so nicely Twisted together, that the <HI>Consederacy</HI>
can not be <HI>Broken</HI> without<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout <HI>Destroying</HI> the <HI>Incorporation,</HI> and
the One n the <HI>Bond</HI> of the Other—; It can then be no <HI>Affront</HI> to the
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to have the <HI>Scots</HI> say, We will have nothing to
<PB N="xxx" REF="42"/>
do with your <HI>Common Prayer</HI>—, Nor to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to
have the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> say, We will have nothing, to do with your
<HI>Presbyterian Discipline</HI>—: It was the Great <HI>Preliminary</HI> of the
<HI>Treaty,</HI> That the <HI>Churches</HI> of either <HI>Kingdom,</HI> should have nothing
to do with One Another—; And therefore the <HI>Treaters</HI> on both
Hands, were expresly forbid to Meddle with the <HI>Affair</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI>
—, whose <HI>Establsfhments,</HI> it was found absolutely Necessary should not in
the least Interfere with One Another—, nor their respective <HI>Jurisdiction</HI>
be Suffered to <HI>Incroach</HI> upon, or <HI>Invade</HI> One the Other. If any have
Reason therefore, to, <HI>take ill</HI> any thing from the Other, the <HI>Church</HI>
of <HI>Scotland</HI> has the first <HI>Offence</HI> given her, by this <HI>Attempt</HI> of <HI>In∣vading</HI>
her <HI>Uniformity;</HI> Only this is to be said for it, That it is
the <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Deed</HI> of a <HI>Party,</HI> not of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> Consi∣dered
as a <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Danger</HI> to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> with Respect to the <HI>Tolerati∣on</HI>
they now Enjoy in <HI>England</HI>—; The <HI>Fears</HI> of that seem to be
altogether Groundless, to any Man that Rightly <HI>Understands,</HI>
either the Nature of the <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> or the State of the
<HI>Question</HI> concerning <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>Scotland—,</HI> in which it is Mani∣fest,
that the <HI>Difference</HI> is so Wide, that no <HI>Argument</HI> can be drawn
from the One to the Other, either to <HI>Strengthen</HI> or <HI>Destroy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Oppose a <HI>Toleration</HI> by a <HI>Claim</HI> of <HI>Right,</HI> stipulated be∣tween
the Two <HI>Nations,</HI> and it is evident—, when the <HI>Act</HI> for Se∣curity
of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> was past in <HI>Scotland</HI>—, this very
Matter of <HI>Toleration</HI> was not a little Debated, and the <HI>Presbyterian
Opposers</HI> of the <HI>UNION</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> were not Backward to express
their Apprehensions of a <HI>Toleration</HI> being Brought upon them by the
<HI>UNION</HI>—, They were <HI>Answered</HI> by the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Security,</HI> which was
supposed, believed, and intended to be Effectual against <HI>such a Thing—,</HI>
and had they not thought it Sufficient, but insisted in <HI>Words</HI> at
length, That <HI>the</HI> Englsh Liturgy <HI>should not have been Tolerated,</HI> or
at all Used in <HI>Scotland</HI> in Publick. I may Appeal to all the <HI>Gentle∣men</HI>
Concern'd, either in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or here in <HI>England,</HI> That it would
not have been Denyed—; And the <HI>Author</HI> of this is Witness to
<HI>Large</HI> Assurances given to this Purpose; but it was thought Modester
to set it down in less pointed Terms—, no Man Doubting but that
an <HI>Article</HI> to Preserve the <HI>Uniformity</HI> of <HI>Worship</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> WITHOUT ANY ALTERATION in all <HI>Succeeding Genera∣tions,</HI>
must be supposed to contain a Sufficient <HI>Security</HI> against the
<HI>English Liturgy.</HI></P>
<P>Now it would seem a very Gross <HI>Suggestion,</HI> and Reproach the
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> with strange <HI>Injustice,</HI> to allege that they should
Discontinue their <HI>Toleration</HI> to <HI>Protestant Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI>
because they themselves, having Consented to the Exclusion of <HI>Episco∣pacy</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> hold them to their <HI>Bargain.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> would the Dissenters <HI>see their
own Right to it,</HI> has a Legal <HI>Claim,</HI> and a Capitulation also on
which it is Founded, and can not without Manifest <HI>Injustice</HI> be Invaded
by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> but to Invade it, because the- <HI>Scots</HI> will
not Tolerate <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> which they (the <HI>English</HI>) Consented should
<PB N="xxxi" REF="43"/>
not be Tolerated, would he a double <HI>Injustice,</HI> and is a <HI>Reproach</HI> to
the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> so much as to imagine.</P>
<P>I think this Argument needs no further Discourse—; The <HI>Scots</HI>
do insist upon it, that by the <HI>UNION</HI> they ought not, and by tha
<HI>Constitution</HI> of their <HI>Church</HI> they can not admit the <HI>Common-Prayer
Book</HI> to be publickly used in <HI>Scotland</HI>—; and those that offer it to
them, know the People there will by no means bear it—, I am loath
to say that's the chief <HI>Motive</HI> of the <HI>Attempt.</HI></P>
<P>Several other <HI>Disputts</HI> happned in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the <HI>UNION,</HI> which can
not be brought into the Compass of a <HI>Preface</HI> and must be refer'd to the fur∣ther
<HI>Histories</HI> of those <HI>Times</HI>—; As the <HI>Act</HI> for making the <HI>Trials</HI>
in Cases of <HI>High Treason,</HI> the same in both <HI>Countries—;</HI> Occa∣sioned,
as is Noted before, by the <HI>Disputes</HI> which happened at the <HI>Trials</HI>
of the four <HI>Gentlemen</HI> brought from <HI>England</HI> on the <HI>Invasion.</HI></P>
<P>The Case of the <HI>Drawbacks</HI> on <HI>Fish</HI> Cured with Foreign Salt Im∣ported
between the making the <HI>UNION,</HI> and the first of <HI>May,</HI> which
being a <HI>Debate</HI> that can never happen again, not Material;only to Note,
that tho' the <HI>Intent</HI> and <HI>Meaning</HI> of the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>UNION,</HI> was not for
them, nor indeed the <HI>Equity</HI> of the Case—; For they could not be sup∣posed
to <HI>Drawback</HI> what they never paid, yet the Letter of the <HI>UNION</HI>
being for them, the <HI>Parliament</HI> Voted them their <HI>Money,</HI> which was a
<HI>Testimony</HI> of the Regard the <HI>British Parliament</HI> always have, and must
always have to the <HI>UNION;</HI> The Case in short teas this,</P>
<P>By the Eighth Article of the <HI>UNION,</HI> several <HI>Allowances</HI> are made,
as <HI>Drawbacks</HI> upon Fish Cured in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Exported</HI> again
—; The reason of this <HI>Allowance,</HI> was because the Salt with which
they are Cured paying a great Duty—, that Duty ought to be drawn
back upon <HI>Exportation</HI>—; Now between the Ratifying the Freaty
and the first of <HI>May,</HI> when it was to take Place, a very great Quantity
of Foreign Salt (<HI>French</HI>) was <HI>Imported,</HI> which by the passing all the
<HI>Goods</HI> so <HI>Imported</HI> as before, paid none of the <HI>English Duties—.</HI>
Now it was alledged, that as the <HI>Duty</HI> did not <HI>Commence</HI> upon the
<HI>Salt,</HI> so the <HI>Drawback</HI> ought not to <HI>Commence,</HI> which was the <HI>Effect</HI>
of that <HI>Duty</HI>—; But the Letter of the <HI>Avt</HI> being express <HI>Article</HI>
the <HI>VIII. That all</HI> Fish <HI>Cured</HI> with <HI>Foreign</HI> Salt <HI>shall Drawback,</HI> &amp;c.
The <HI>Parliament</HI> Voted it, and <HI>Scotland</HI> got about Twenty Seven Thousand
pound <HI>Sterling Drawback,</HI> where they paid little or nothing of <HI>Duty.</HI></P>
<P>I do not remember any thing Material that happened in this <HI>Inter∣val,</HI>
more than what has been hinted at here—; The Parliament
of <HI>BRITAIN</HI> went on to Ease the Scots in every Thing that came be∣fore
them, and except the Act above-mentioned about <HI>Treason,</HI> I know
nothing that past against the <HI>Joynt Opinion</HI> of the <HI>Scots Mem∣bers</HI>
in Two <HI>Sessions</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> which have sat before the writing,
these <HI>Sheets.</HI></P>
<P>I have now, only a few things to take notice of here, relating to the
<HI>Performance</HI> of the <HI>Work</HI>—, which I must make some <HI>Apology</HI>
for, and which shall close this Preface.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxii" REF="44"/>
<HI>First,</HI> That there are some <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament, which</HI> in the
<HI>Book,</HI> are refer'd to, as Printed in the <HI>Appendix, but are not
there</HI>—; As the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Security</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> formerly past
there—; The <HI>Act</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An</HI> Act for <HI>pre∣venting
Dangers arising from the said</HI> Act of Security in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>—;
The several <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> for Naming <HI>Com∣missioners</HI>
or the <HI>Treaties</HI>—; And the <HI>Act</HI> for <HI>Plantation of
Kirks and Valuation of Teinds</HI>—. These <HI>Acts</HI> being all
Publick, and to be found in the several <HI>Volumes</HI> of <HI>Acts</HI> of
<HI>Parliament</HI> of the respective <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> I have Omitted in the
<HI>Appendix, as needless,</HI> tho' refer'd to in the <HI>Book</HI>—; The
<HI>Appendix</HI> also swelling beyond my Expectation.</P>
<P>A <HI>Note</HI> also of the Difference of the several <HI>Duties</HI> on <HI>Goods Ex∣ported</HI>
and <HI>Imported</HI> before, and after the <HI>UNION,</HI> and of the Sta∣tions
ef the <HI>Custom House Cruizers</HI> mentioned Fol. 12. of the <HI>first
Appendix,</HI> and refer'd to N. R. S. T. V. Xxx. of the <HI>second Ap∣pendix,</HI>
are Omitted, the first, as needless,, a Book of Rates of both
being afterward Published in <HI>Scotland</HI>—: The second as void by the
Course of things, the said <HI>Cruizers</HI> having never been built.</P>
<P>Fol 5. of the first <HI>Appendix,</HI> the last <HI>Paragraph</HI> but one, mention
as made of a <HI>Calculation</HI> of the Damages done to the <HI>Revenue,</HI> by the
<HI>Importation</HI> of <HI>French Goods</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> between the End of the
<HI>Treaty</HI> and the first of <HI>May</HI>—; But I find my self obliged to ac∣knowledge
ingenuously, that after many <HI>Essays</HI> to obtain <HI>such</HI> a <HI>Compu∣tation,</HI>
I could never come to any <HI>Account</HI> so exact as I could depend
Upon, or venture to Publish.</P>
<P>The <HI>Irregularity</HI> of the <HI>Appendix,</HI> may deserve some Excuse, but the
various <HI>Times</HI> in which the several Parts were wrote, even some before
others were Acted, were the true Reason of the <HI>Irregular</HI> placing of the
Pieces; And 'tis hoped the <HI>Reader</HI> will accept that for a Reason.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Work</HI> it self—, I shall say nothing, but leave it to the
<HI>Charity</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> which in this <HI>Age</HI> indeed runs very low It has
many Difficulties in its Way many <HI>Factions</HI> and <HI>Parties</HI> to please—,
and must be Censur'd by some; I have endeavoured to speak <HI>Truth</HI> and
relate fact Impartially in all that is Matter of History; As to my own
<HI>Observations,</HI> they are but my <HI>Opinions,</HI> and they must abide the
Ficrcest <HI>Attacks</HI> of <HI>Parties,</HI> as the <HI>Passions</HI> and <HI>Interests</HI> of <HI>Men</HI>

<P>WHEN Posterity shall look back on the great Transacti∣on
of the <HI>UNION</HI> of these Kingdoms,—when
by just Reflection on the <HI>Temper,</HI> the <HI>Conduct</HI> and
the <HI>Constitution</HI> of the People, the Circumstances of the <HI>Times,</HI>
with the <HI>Inrerest</HI> and <HI>State</HI> of other <HI>Nations</HI> at that Time,
they shall see into some of the <HI>Difficulties</HI> which necessarly at∣tended
so stupendious a <HI>Work;</HI> it will be most Natural to En∣quire,
by wbose <HI>Management,</HI> and under whose <HI>Conduct</HI> it
was carryed on.</P>
<P>When Her <HI>MAJESTY</HI> in Her Speech to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> at
the Conclusion of the <HI>UNION,</HI> was pleased to say, <HI>That it
should be mentioned hereafter to the Honour of those who
were concern'd in bringing it to pass;</HI> It cannot be doubt∣ed,
But your Grace had the first Place in Her <HI>Majesty's</HI> Thought.</P>
<P>The Particulars of the <HI>UNION</HI> cannot be discoursed of, much
less can any <HI>History</HI> of it be Transmitted to Posterity; But
Mention must be made of your <HI>Grace's Part</HI> in it: All our Ac∣counts
will be full of the <HI>Hazards</HI> you run, the <HI>Insults</HI> and
<HI>Affronts</HI> you received, the <HI>Dangers</HI> your Person was exposed
<PB REF="46"/>
to in the Faithful Discharge of the <HI>High Trust</HI> your <HI>Royal

<P>The Compassion your Grace shew'd for the Poor Enraged
<HI>People,</HI> who by their <HI>Warmth</HI> and <HI>Fury</HI> against the
<HI>UNION</HI> exposed themselves to the Law, and to your just
Resentment, are Testimonies of a <HI>Moderation</HI> and <HI>Temper</HI> par∣ticularly
fitted for a Work of <HI>UNION</HI>—a Mind qualified
for <HI>Peace,</HI> and that first having made an absolute Conquest of
your own <HI>Passion,</HI> was not to be moved by the Extremes of
others.</P>
<P>This My <HI>Lord,</HI> is a Testimony, not only of your Grace's
Capacity for the Greatest and Nicest Concern of this <HI>Age;</HI>
But of Her <HI>Majesties</HI> singular <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Penetration</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Sing∣ling
out <HI>your Grace</HI> from among the whole Body of the Nobili∣ty,
far a <HI>Trust</HI> on which the <HI>Essential Article</HI> of Her Majesty's
Glory, and all <HI>Britains</HI> Safety so much depended.</P>
<P>If <HI>Triumphs</HI> were allowed to those Generals who subdued by
Force of <HI>Arms</HI> the Barbarous <HI>Nations</HI> to the Obedience of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Empire, if their Victories which were Impres't with
Blood, and which at best Consisted in Devastation of <HI>King∣doms,</HI>
and destiroying <HI>Nations,</HI> were the Subject of the flourish∣ing
<HI>Orations,</HI> and <HI>Heroick Poems</HI> of the Learned Men of that
<HI>Age;</HI> How much more just are the <HI>Triumphs of Peace,</HI> and
the <HI>Praises of such Victories</HI> which prevent <HI>Destructive Wars,</HI>
and lay solid Foundations for the lasting Tranquility of <HI>Na∣tion?</HI></P>
<P>Here are no <HI>Widows</HI> and <HI>Orphans,</HI> whose private Tears
lessen the Publick <HI>Joy,</HI> and whose Sighs for the Loss of their near∣est
<HI>Relations</HI> stain in the <HI>Dear-bought Victory,</HI> shall drown the
<HI>Acclamations</HI> they should make for the Prosperity of their
<HI>Country. Peace and Union</HI> Challenge every Mans <HI>Joy,</HI>
their Nature is suited to every thing that's Safe and Calm, and
their Consequences never fail to be seen in <HI>Plenty</HI> and <HI>Prosperi∣ty,</HI>
if the Fault be not their own.</P>
<P>There is no Question, but that among that Illustrionu Body,
the <HI>Nobility of SCOTLAND,</HI> there were many to be found,
whose Zeal for Her Majesty's Service, whose <HI>Good-will</HI> to the
<HI>UNION,</HI> whose sincere Aim at the Service of their <HI>Country,</HI>
should justly Recommend them in such a Choice—But bad the
<PB REF="47"/>

yet without the most Self-Denying <HI>Moderation,</HI> the coolest <HI>Cou∣rage,</HI>
and the most passive <HI>Resolution,</HI> it bad been all to no Pur∣pose.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express, tho I was an Eye-Witness
to it all, thro' what Difficulties <HI>Your Grace</HI> pass'd in this
nice Affair, between what Rocks you steer'd, what Pre∣cipices
you trod on, what Contraries you reconciled,
the least Deviation in any of which had pusht <HI>your Grace</HI>
and the whole Nation upon irrecoverable <HI>Ship-wrack</HI> &amp; Disaster
—More <HI>Courage</HI> on one Hand had precipitated all and yet the
least Grain of <HI>Fcar</HI> bad suk the -very Foundation: <HI>To be An∣gry,</HI>
even when no Man Irving could be pleased, to be in the
least moved by the most violent Extremes, to shun the most ap∣parent
Mischiefs, to decline the greatest Difficulties, any of these
had ruin'd the whole Prospect.</P>
<P>Even those People who pretended to <HI>oppose</HI> your Grace in the
Matter of the Treaty, confess the Honour of finshing the Uni∣on
to be your Grace's Due; Since they look on the Choice of
<HI>your Grace</HI> to that <HI>Work</HI> as their chief Disaster, Declaring what
they hate to hear repeated, viz. <HI>That no Man in</HI> Scotland
<HI>but your self could have done it.</HI></P>
<P>Those that pursuing differing <HI>Schemes,</HI> and having remote
<HI>Views,</HI> pretended to carry on <HI>Principles of Union,</HI> but of o∣ther
and imperfect <HI>Natures,</HI> came into this, not upon <HI>Con∣viction</HI>
of it's being better lay'd than their own; But because
when they found your Grace had espoused it, they forsaw it
would be done without them.</P>
<P>The most violent Enemies of <HI>Union as such,</HI> and whose
particular <HI>Aversion</HI> to the <HI>Prosperity</HI> of <HI>Britain,</HI> the <HI>Revo∣lution</HI>

<HI>Opposition</HI> to the Treaty; who boasted always of its being Im∣practicable;
who had successfully broken all the <HI>Measures</HI> for∣merly
taken in order to a <HI>Treaty,</HI> and particularly had Insult∣ed
<HI>Her Majesty</HI> in bassling the last—<HI>Took the Allarm</HI>
at your Graces first Appearance in this Affair—This
taught them to double their Endeavouvs, to call in the Assis∣tance
of all their Friends, to stirr up their <HI>Polticks,</HI> and use
all the Force of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Artifice</HI> in Management of <HI>Parties to

<HEAD>A
GENERAL HISTORY
OF
UNIONS
IN
BRITAIN</HEAD>
<P>IN order to come to a clear Understanding in the whole Frame
of this wonderful Transaction, THE UNION, 'tis ne∣cessary
to let the Reader into the very Original of it, and
Enquire where the first Springs are to be found, from whence
this mighty Transaction has been Form'd.</P>
<P>And tho' this will of course lead us back a great way into History,
yet it will carry this Advantage along with it, that we shall see
all the several Steps which have been taken, how Providence has
led the Nations, as it were, by the Hand, and brought them by
the Hints of their mutual Disasters, to seek this Treaty, as the
only Harbour the Ship of the State could safely come to an Anchor in.</P>
<P>Nor is it unworthy Observation, especially to those who love to
remark the Connection of Providences in the Affairs of this World,
and the various Turns the island of <HI>Britain</HI> has had in the Compass
of a few past Years; All which have had their direct Tendency to
this great Event, tho' perfectly Unforeseen, either by the Actors or
the Lookers on in those Ages.</P>
<P>The Animositics between these two Nations, would require a
great deal of Time and Art to Describe, they are not so remarkable
fot their Antiquity and Original, as for their Nature and Circum∣stances.</P>
<P>Never two Nations that had so much Affinity in Circumstanccs,
have had such Inveteracy and Aversion to one another in their
Blood.</P>
<P>They have been both the Inhabitants of the Richest, the Beauti∣fullest
&amp; most populous Island in the World. And by frequent mutual
<PB N="2" REF="50"/>
Invasions made upon them, by the same Foreign Nations, who
have left their Race behind them, it is not at all an Excursion to say,
They are the same in Blood, of the same Off-spring, and became
Inhabitants the same way.</P>
<P>If it be Objected, That the North and North-West Parts of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
are <HI>Irish,</HI> and retain both the Sirnames, Manners, and
Language of the lrijhy or the Ancient Scoti, from whence the whole
Kingdom had its Name; It is also Answered, so has <HI>England</HI> in
<HI>Wales, Cornwal, &amp; Westmorland</HI> the Ancient <HI>Britain,</HI> who retain their
Sirnames, Manners and Languages, as distinctly as the Highlanders
in the North, or the <HI>Irish</HI> in the Islands of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But take the South Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> on this fide the <HI>Tay,</HI> the In∣habitants,
<HI>tho' very Ancient,</HI> must be allowed to be the Remains of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Cclonies, afterwards of the <HI>Danes,</HI> some <HI>Saxons;</HI> and
among all these, the <HI>Picts,</HI> who we suppose, to have been the An∣cient
Inhabitants.</P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>England</HI> is much more mixt in Blood, and the Reason
of this is plain, in that, being a Nation powerful in Wealth, Fruit∣ful
in Soil, and above all, increasing in Commerce, more Nations
have sought to settle among them, numbers of People have flowed
in upon them, from all Parts of the World, and blending their
Blood with the most ancient Families, have destroyed all that can
be called National, as to Antiquity among them, and they do not
pretend to it.</P>
<P>Whereas in <HI>Scotland,</HI> under all the Mixtures they have suffered,
their ancient Families seem to have been preserved, and Foreign
Nations have only seemed to increase their Number.</P>
<P>However this be, there is Nearness of Blood enough, I mean
as to Originals, to have occasioned some P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ropensity to Coalition,
and mutual Neighbourhood between the Nations; &amp; one would have
thought, some happy Accident might have fallen our, some Lucid
Interval, some convenient Crisis of Circumstances, or Juncture of
Inclination, to have brought them together, made them fast
Friends, and so have joyn'd their victorious Arms, to the Terrour
of their Neighbours.</P>
<P>But the Rancor has run in the Blood, the Hatred between the
Nations, has look like a meer Original, a fort of Antipathy, Here∣detary
from Generation, Born with the very Nations, and has long
Threatned us with being too fast rooted there, ever to be remov'd,
but <HI>like a malignant rank Leposfie,</HI> by pulling up Foundations.</P>
<P>Nor will all the History which I shall Trace in the pursuit of this
Affair, Illustrate it more than the very Story of <HI>the Union it self;</HI>
The strange Opposition made to the Treaty, and to the Parliament
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> against all manner of Reasoning against Nature, against
Interest, the Aversion to it among those very People that are now
made Happy by it, with what Convulsions this evil Spirit was cast
out, what Struggles it made at parting, how the poor Enslaved
People sought against their approaching Freedom, Insulted the Pa∣triots
of their Liberty, and with inexpressible Uneasiness, received
<PB N="3" REF="51"/>
the Blessing of Universal Peace. These things, I say, will be lasting
Testimonies to that Original Aversion that was planted in the
Minds of the People, notwithstanding the Nearness of their Cir∣cumstances
in other Cases.</P>
<P>I shall not go back to the Wars here, between the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI>
and the <HI>Britains,</HI> in the Time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and how afterwards
in the declining of their Empire, the <HI>Britains fatally to them,</HI> called
in the <HI>Saxons</HI> to support them against the Fury of the <HI>Scots;</HI> The
Famous <HI>Picts</HI> Wall built in the Time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Remains
whereof are visible to this day, are sad Tokens of the Ancient
Quarrels, Wars, and Devastations that were carried on between
the two Kingdoms, even beyond our Accounts of Time.</P>
<P>Nor does it appear to me, That there was in all those Times,
any Propensity between the Nations to such a thing as Peace, no
not for many Ages after those Times, but it either Side found it
convenient to Treat, even those Treaties were carried on with a
kind of a professed Resolution of renew'd War on the first occasion;
and I think History gives us no Account of any firm resolv'd Peace
ever made among them, but only short Truces of Peace for a Term
of Years, very often for One year, Two or Three, at the end of
which, the War was supposed to break out again of course.</P>
<P>Nor were these Wars carried on like the Wars between other
Nations, with Policy, Temper, and Points of Honour, but all that
could be expected, when two Terrible and War-like Nations, pro∣voked
to all possible Extreams, shall meet, have been to be found
here—; These unhappy Wars have therefore been all Devasta∣tion
and Blood, the Invasions on either Side have always been Fire
and Death, the Land laid waste with Burnings and Plunder, and
then the Armies Fighting with Fury and Desperation, no Nations
that ever Fought, <HI>since what we are told of in the old Eastern and</HI>
Roman <HI>Empires,</HI> have killed so many in Fight; And if I should
enter into proportions of Land &amp; People, I need not make Exceptions
for them either, Sixty Thousand, Thirty Thousand, Twenty and
Fifteen Thousand slain of a Side, have been the frequent Numbers,
of which History gives Account in the Wars between these two
miserable-Nations, and that not seldom, but very often, and some
very lately.</P>
<P>I forbear to enter into a further Description of the ancient Feuds
of these Nations, as what is but a Melancholly Retrospect, to any
that have but common Compassion for their Countrey; this may
serve to Illustrate the present Subject, and make the Peace we now
enjoy, the more valuable to Posterity.</P>
<P>The first Entrance I shall make on the Matter of Coalition seems
to begin with <HI>Edward</HI> the first King of <HI>England,</HI> and this as it was
on a wrong Foot, so its Continuance was accordingly—; That
Victorious Monarch possest the whole Island of <HI>Britain,</HI> for he
pierced <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>Orcades,</HI> and Traversed all the Mountains
of <HI>Wales,</HI> subdued all the petty Princes of the <HI>Britains,</HI> and had
projected to call himself King of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="52"/>
But Providence had better Things in Store for this Island, his
projected Empire, founded on Conquest, Ended ere it began, all
his Victories were Unravelled in his Effeminate Luxuriant Son, and
he that had Torn the Crown from his Neighbours, had in his
Posterity his own Crown laid at the Foot of Justice, and taken
from the Head of a Thoughtless young Tyrant his Son, whose Life
was made to pay for the Oppressions of his own Subjects.</P>
<P>It was in this Kings Reign, the first Project of Uniting the two
Kingdoms was laid, and tho' it proved Abortive in its most Early
Execution, yet it is very useful to the present purpose, and to the
Readers Information, to give the World a Scheme of this designed
Union, and to let those Gentlemen who have Opposed it now as a
Novelty, know, that it was the Opinion of both the Nations in
all Ages, for this was in 1286, that a Union would be for the ge∣neral
Good of the whole—; See English <HI>Buchan. fol.</HI> 245.</P>
<P>'Tis true, we find one of the Kings of <HI>Scotland, viz. Robert Bruce,</HI>
who was really one of the Greatest Kings <HI>Scotland</HI> ever had, among
the Instructions left for the Conduct of his Succesfor, leaving this
stated Rule, <HI>viz.</HI> Never to make a perpetual Amity with the <HI>English,
Buchan. Lib. 8. Fol.</HI> 86.</P>
<P>But the Reasons given for it, will not at all be brought in pre∣judice
of a Union, or Incorporation of the two Nations, for as to
long Recesses which that Prince argued, to prove, that the <HI>Scots</HI> by
Disuse would be rendred unfit for Arms, and so be the more easily
worsted by the <HI>English,</HI> who by foreign Wars were always kept
Active and Vigorous, and by that means were likely to have Ad∣vantages
of them; that can be no Argument, the Nations now ha∣ving
no more occasion for that Emulation.</P>
<P>Nor does it seem to me but the same principle of Care for his Na∣tive
Countrey, which led King <HI>Robert</HI> to be so Thoughtful for Time
to come, <HI>Could he have seen what these Ages have been brought to
know,</HI> would by the same Reasoning, have led him vigorously to
have pursued a Conjunction of the two Kingdoms, into one Incor∣porated
Body; If he had seen the least Prospect of such an Attempt,
being Feasible: and I believe this not from the Nature of the Thing
only, and its Correspondence with his General Interest—; But
from this Note, That in his Succssors Times—, when
the first proper Season seemed to offer, it was not Thought of on∣ly,
but pursued with all possible Diligence, as shall appear in its
proper place.</P>
<P>But to go back to the State of the Wars in his Reign, and a little
before.</P>
<P>Who ever will give himself leave to Read the History of the
Wars at that Time, will wonder how <HI>Scotland</HI> was able to Struggle
with such Terrible Losses, and may reckon up above 200000 <HI>Scots∣men</HI>
slain in Fight, only against King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, besides all the
other Havock, five several Invasions of a Conquering Enemy must
be attended with.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="53"/>
And yet with what Vigour they shook off the Yoke, how they were
to his Death, I mean King <HI>Edward the first,</HI> preparing new Armies,
and in the space of but two years after it, ventured a Battle with
his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the second, at the Head of 100000 <HI>Englishmen</HI> at
<HI>Bannockburn,</HI> and beat him out of the Field with the greatest
Slaughter that was ever made in <HI>Britain,</HI> since the Fight between
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror and King <HI>Harold,</HI> there being, as some
Histories say, 60000 Men slain on the <HI>English</HI> Side.</P>
<P>Thus ended the Union of Conquest between the Nations, <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
recovered her Liberty, and <HI>England</HI> paid very dear for the
Experiment.</P>
<P>But this is not the Rcason why I begin at this Period, but as
the first Sense of the Blessings of Union began to touch the People
of this Age, it can not but be acknowledged the great, and in∣deed
the only Point of Time, to' take the Rise of this Voluminous
Story from.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> the Third King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was one of the greatest
Instances of the Vicissitudes and precarious Condition of a Royal
State in the World, in the space of about three Years, he had two
Wives, and a flourishing Off-spring, was left first a Widower, then
Childless, and at last Lifeless, and the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> in a mann∣er
Hopeless.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the Second King of <HI>England</HI> Dying, King <HI>Alexander</HI> his
Queen takes a Journey to <HI>England,</HI> in Complement to King <HI>Edward</HI>
the First, and to be present at his Coronation; I shall avoid Dis∣putting
here any thing of the so much controverted Article of
Homage, let it be how it will, 'tis not to the present purpose, to
me it seems not at all the Business of that Journey, if it had, there
had been no need of the Queens going too, nor do I Read of any
Thing but a Visit of Complement, or a Journey of Curiosity, to
see the Pomp and Grandeur of the <HI>English</HI> Court, which was then
very great.</P>
<P>In this Journey, Fatal to the Family as well as to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
Queen Sickned, and soon after Dyed; She was followed in a few
Months by both her Sons, <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> the latter being
but just Married to the Daughter of <HI>Baldwin</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all, Disasters seldom come alone, <HI>Margaret</HI> the
Kings only Daughter Married to the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> Dyed the
same year, leaving one Daughter only, Named also <HI>Margaret;</HI> Of
whom presently.</P>
<P>The King surprized with this general Sheek of Mortality upon
his Family, finding himself Childless, and Unmarried, <HI>but being</HI>
in his Prime of Age and Strength, &amp;c Resolves upon Marriage to Restore
his Family, and accordingly he Marries <HI>Joletta</HI> Daughter of the
Earl of <HI>Dreux in Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>But Heaven had yet further Judgments for <HI>Scotland,</HI> for before
any Children were born of this Marriage, the King himself tell
from his Horse, and his Kingdom, both at once, for he Broke his
<PB N="6" REF="54"/>
Neck in the Fall at or near <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> a little Town in <HI>Fife,</HI> on the
North-side of the Firth over a gainsst <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The only Heir to the Crown, was now <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of
<HI>Hangonanus</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> by <HI>Margaret</HI> aforesaid, the only Daugh∣ter
of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third King of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>And here is the first Demonstration of what I shall all along in∣sist
on in this History, <HI>viz.</HI> That never any rational Prospect of
Uniting these Kingdoms appeared in the World, but both the Na∣tions
unanimously agreed, that Union was for the mutual Advan∣tage
of both, and that it never was Opposed by either Nation, <HI>as
a Nation,</HI> but only as Private Interest, Strength of <HI>Parties,</HI> Court
Intrigues, and the Enemies of both the Nations have prevailed,
to prevent their Happiness.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> Dyed in the year 1285, without Issue, Vid. <HI>Buchan.</HI>
De <HI>Rerum,</HI> Scoticarum <HI>Lib. 7. Fol. 71. Edward</HI> the First King of
<HI>England,</HI> a Powerful and Politick Prince, saw himself in a Con∣dition
to Manage <HI>Scotland</HI> by Force, as afterwards too sadly ap∣peared,
but a better Prospect at that Time being in View, he falls
immediately upon a Scheme, which, f Providence had permitted it to
have taken Effect, would have secured the Peace of these Kingdoms
from that Time, and prevented the terrible Effusion of Blood,
which happened that very same Age, as well as for many Ages
since between both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>And this Project was UNION, the King had one Son <HI>Edward,</HI>
Heir to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> who afterwards proved the most
Unfortunate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Prince that ever Reigned in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Grown of <HI>Scotland</HI> had but one Heir, <HI>viz. Margaret</HI> of Nor∣way
Grandchild to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third, by <HI>Margaret</HI> his Daugh∣ter
Married to the King of <HI>Norway.</HI> It presently Occurs to the King
and his Council, That a Marriage between <HI>Edward</HI> his Son and this
young Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> then commonly called, <HI>The Maid of Nor∣way,</HI>
would necessarily Devolve both the Crowns upon his <HI>Posteri∣ty,</HI>
and immediately Establish the Peace of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Nor was the Relation very Remote, for <HI>Margaret</HI> was, as above
said, the Daughter of <HI>Margaret,</HI> only Daughter of King <HI>Alexander,</HI>
by King <HI>Edwards</HI> own Sifter; and therefore the Dispensations from
the Pope, were then thought necessary to be obtained, as will ap∣pear
presently.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of King <HI>Alexander,</HI> says <HI>Buchanan</HI> in the 8th.
Book, of History, <HI>a Convention of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;ates was held at</HI> Scoon,
<HI>to Treat about Creating a new King.</HI> These are <HI>Buchanans</HI> Words;
<HI>Alexandra cum tota stirpe (prater unam ex silia Neptem) Extincto,
Conventus Ordinum</HI> Sconam <HI>indicitur, in quo de novo Rege Creando &amp;
stain Regni interim Componendo ageretur.</HI> Buch. Lib. 8. Fol. 72.</P>
<P>I contess considering the Character and Authority of <HI>Buchanan,</HI>
I much wonder how he could say, They Met about <HI>Creating a new
King,</HI> when in the ssme Paragraph, he says, <HI>The whole Linage of</HI>
Alexander, <HI>except one Grandchild by his Daughter,</HI> being Extinct
—; Now it one Grandchild was in Being, the Convention of
Estates could not be Met to Create a new King.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="55"/>
Nor does it appear that their Business was to Create anew King,
but to Settle the Government of the Kingdom in such Hands, as
might secure the publick Peace, during the Absence of their young
Queen, and till she could Arrive from <HI>Norway</HI>—; And that this
was their Busness, is also evident from <HI>Buchanans</HI> own Relation,
in the same Chapter Quoted above, where he says, That when
most of the Nobility were come to the said Convention, in the First
place, they appointed Vicegerents to Govern Matters, <HI>Bo cum Fre∣quens
Nobilitas Venisset, primum Om<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>num Sex Creat, qui summa Re∣rum
praessent,</HI> Buch. Lib. 8. Fol. 72. for the present, That is, till
their Queen should Arrive.</P>
<P>To this Assembly <HI>Edward</HI> the First King of <HI>England,</HI> sends his
Ambassadors to Treat with them, to desire their Queen, says Bu∣chanan,
as a Wife to his Son.</P>
<P>The Historical part of this Affair, is not so significant to the pre∣sent
purpose, as the Substance and Intention, the Opinion and No∣tion
the Nobility, Princes and People of both Nations had of the
Thing they were then doing, in which it will appear,</P>
<P>1. That an intire Incorporation of Countries, a Coalition of
Inrerests and Affection, as well as Commerce and Constitution,
was Designed, even at that distance of Time, as the only Means
to Settle the Peace and Happiness of both Nations.</P>
<P>2. That it was the best Juncture that ever had happened, or
could happen for such a Coalition, and nothing but the imme∣diate
Hand of Providence, who reserv'd it for a more happy
Time, and for more happy Instruments to Finish, could have
Prevented.</P>
<P><HI>And therefore</HI> Buchanan <HI>says of it,</HI> Hi, cum in Conventu publico
Multa de Utilitate publica, que hoc Matrimonium esset secutura, Dis∣sruissent,
<HI>Scotorum</HI> animos ab ca Affinitate non alienos Invenerunt.

Populus honestis &amp; aqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Conditionbus, in unum Coiret. <HI>Buch. de Rer.
Scot. Lib. 8. Fol. 73. Which his homely Translator has</HI> Englished <HI>thus;</HI>
thus;</P>
<P>“The Ambassadors in this Session, Discoursed much of the
publick Utility like to accrue to both Kingdoms by this Mar∣riage,
neither did they find the <HI>Scots</HI> Averse therefrom, for <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
was a Man of great Courage and Power, yet he desired to increase it; and his Valour highly appeared in the Holy War,
in his Fathers Lifetime, and after his Death in his subduing of
<HI>Wales,</HI> neither were there ever more Endearments past between
the <HI>Scots</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> than under the last Kings; yea the
<PB N="8" REF="56"/>
ancient Hatred seemed no way more likely to be Abolished,
than if both Nations on just and equal Terms might be United
into one.”</P>
<P>Here is the very substance of the Queens late Letter to the Par∣liament
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> about the Union now made; only here, the
People unhappily seem'd Blind to their own Happiness, and so
long ago they were able to see it their mutual Interest.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors Discoursed with the Nobility in the Conven∣tion,
about the publick Utility like to accrue to both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>What is this but mutual Stipulations, Regulations, and in
short, a Treaty between them how to make a Union between the
Nations, such as might be for the publick Advantage of both King∣doms.</P>
<P>And this was done with General Endearments between the
Kingdoms, mutual Civilities passed between the Gentlemen con∣cerned
on both Sides, for the Good of both; we read of no Jea∣lousies,
no Prejudices, no radicated Antipathies, but the publick
Good convinced both Sides, that nothing could Contribute more to
the Rooting out and Abolishing the ancient Hatred, than to have
both Nations on just and equal Terms be UNITED INTO ONE.</P>
<P>Nor is it remote to this purpose, to enter a little into the Ar∣ticles
of this Union, for tho' History is very silent in this Matter,
yet, as I have promised to search every Thing in this History to
the Bottom, I find among the Records in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> an
Ancient Instrument or Form of this Union or Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>federacy, which
in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, you will have Printed at large, and
is Numbred 1.</P>
<P>And <HI>Ferst,</HI> to let the World be satisfied, that even in so remote
a Time, things of this nature were Transacted with the same due
Caution and Regard to the Liberties and Good of the People, as
they are now, and that it was a National not a private Act, not an
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word of a few, Over-awed by the Power of King <HI>Edward,</HI> tho' seve∣ral
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Sides taken in it, will be very necessary to be Noted, for I take
this to be the most exact Pattern of the present Treaty, of any that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>has ever gone before it, as it was a Treaty seriously set about by both
Nations, with a real Design for the general Utility, and with a
Design on both Sides to bring it to pass, which is more than can
Be said of all the Treaties which have been set on Foot since.</P>
<P>The first Step the King took after his sending Ambassadors to
Treat with the Convention, seems to me to be the obtaining a
Dispensation from the Pope; the Queen and the young Prince
being nearly Allyed; and such was the subjection of the Princes of
the World to the <HI>Roman</HI> Tyranny, that nothing could go on of this
Nature, without the Sanction of the Church, where, by the way
may be observed;</P>
<P>That the Pope, as in all Ages Popes have done, made his Ad∣vantage
of the Occasion, and takes this Opportunity, to Demand
of the King an old Arrear of an annual Pension of 1000 Merks,
<PB N="9" REF="57"/>
Granted by King <HI>John</HI> to the Holy See, and which King <HI>Edward</HI>
had left five years unpaid.</P>
<P>The King, who knew well enough the Influence ready Money
had in such Cases, readily answers the Popes Demands, and Issued
his Writ for payment of the Money.</P>
<P>The true Copy of the Original Warrant to the Treasurer, is
added in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, which being very sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert, I
thought not Improper to insert there, as a Thing the Curious may
be very well pleased to Read, and is marked N<SUP>o</SUP> (8.)</P>
<P>It is to be Noted the End of King <HI>Edward</HI> in payment of this
Money, was plainly to get the Dispensation Expedited, for he never
paid any more that I read of, nor his Successors either, I mean, on
account of that old Pension or Grant of King <HI>John's.</HI></P>
<P>His Holiness was so exceedingly obliged by this payment of 5000
Merks, that he immediately dispatched the Dispensation for the
Marriage of Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> with the Heiress of the Crown of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
tho' within the prohibited Degrees of Consanguinity; which
Dispensation is Enrolled in the patent Roll of 17. <HI>Ed.</HI> Ift. nd may
be found in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2.</P>
<P>The next Step the King takes is, to send Ambassadors and Letters
to the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> giving his Proxie to the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI>
one of the said Ambassadors, to Espouse the Lady in the Name of
his Son <HI>Edward,</HI> wherein the Dispensation obtained from the Pope,
is Repeated; This Letter and Proxie is added in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 3.</P>
<P>At the same Time he sends Letters to the Keepers or Guardians
of the Realm of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to the King of <HI>Norway</HI> in Answer to
Letters received from them, containing all the Articles and Agree∣ments
on which it was that he proposed this Marriage, which were
Published by the King, for the Satisfaction of the Subjects of both
Nations, in which you will find all possible Care taken of the Ge∣neral
Good, and sincere Protestations, that the End of this Mar∣riage,
was, as is expressed in one of the Letters, <HI>Ad Honorem Dei &amp;
Tranquitatem Totius Communitatis ejusdem Regni.</HI></P>
<P>These Testimonials are too significant nor to deserve a Place in
this History, and therefore are placed in their Order in, the Col∣lection,
and Numbred 4, 5, 6, 7.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but I find a large Charter or Grant made by
the Agreement of special Commissioners on both Sides, and Rati∣fied
by the King himself, to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>In short, it is a meer Treaty of Union between the Kingdoms,
tho' not much Collateral, but rather particularly to <HI>Scotland,</HI> this
has the Great Seal affixed to it, and the King took an Oath to ob∣serve
it, under the Penalty of One Hundred Thousand Pounds
<HI>Sterling, an immense Sum in those days,</HI> to be paid to the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> towards carrying on the Wars in the Holy Land, and on the
farther Penalty of Excommunication, and subjecting his whole
Kingdom to an Interdict; Things very Terrible in those Days.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="58"/>
This Instrument also is at large found among the Records in the
Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and is Re-printed in <HI>Prynnes</HI> Collection <HI>Fol.</HI> 395.
396, 397. and added in the <HI>Appendix</HI> or <HI>Collection</HI> to this Work,
N<SUP>o</SUP> 9.</P>
<P>Another Instrument is also Recorded in old <HI>French,</HI> wherein the
Security to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for Surrendring her forts and Strengths to
the <HI>English</HI> on this Marriage, is Settled, and which you will find
in the <HI>Collection</HI> also, N<SUP>o</SUP> 10.</P>
<P>Thus the Affair of an Union was finished above Four Hundred
and Twenty Years ago, and these Nations had Flourished under its
Consequences no doubt—; But Heaven Frown'd on so great
a Work, and the Sins of both Nations permitted not that Blessing
to come in their Day' for the Lady Dyed in her Voyage from
<HI>Norway</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> having a Rough Passage, and being not able
to bear the Fatigues of the Sea; And thus all this fair Fabrick
came to nothing, was Dash'd in a Moment, to the inexpressible
Loss and Regret of both the Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanan</HI> says, She Dyed in <HI>Norway</HI> before the Commissioners
Arrived, but our <HI>English</HI> Historians, &amp; Mr. <HI>Tyrrel</HI> in particular, whom
in this I follow, <HI>Lib. 9. Vol. 3. Fol.</HI> 6. says positively, she Dyed
in Her Voyage between <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot omit to Remind the Reader of these Sheets, what were
the Dismal Consequences of this Disappointment to both these
Kingdoms, and as it was nothing but the immediate Hand of Pro∣vidence
that brought it to pass, so it may, without any Charge of
<HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> or Over-straining the Case, be allowed, to be one of
the severest Judgments that ever Heaven Inflicted on this Island.</P>
<P>And I insist on this, not so much as it relates to the present
History, but as it may be needful for such People to Reflect upon, who
have, <HI>at the same Time that they pretended to be Lovers of their Coun∣trey,</HI>
yet vigorously Opposed the Uniting these Nations in this last
Treaty.</P>
<P>The breaking of the happy Prospect of Union between the two
Kingdoms, was attended with strange Confusions, all which serve
to Euhance the Value of their present United State, the hopes of
a prosperous Peace were not greater on one Hand, than the prospect
of Dismal Confusions was Horrid on the other; And tho' it be a
Digression, I shall venture the Trespass to give a short Abridgement
of the History of those Times, as in the Course of these Sheers it
shall be needful to form a due Connexion, and I promise my self,
the Diversion will be as pleasant as profitable, and that no body
will think it lost Labour to Read over, what in those Ages was
Transacted on the Stage of their Native Countrey.</P>
<P>With the Death of this Princess, all the Thoughts of Union be∣tween
the Kingdoms Dyed also, each Party began to Examine their
separate Interest, not Consulting what was fit to be done for the
carrying on their National and General Advantages.</P>

at large to be found in <HI>Buchanans</HI> History <HI>Lib.</HI> 8. their Titles were
remote, and not only pretty equally founded, but their Interest
among the Nobility was so equal, and either way so powerful, that
nothing but an immediate and Bloody War was apprehended, as
the Consequence of their Pretensions.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>England</HI> disappointed in his Hopes of bringing
the Kingdoms to a lasting Peace, by Uniting them into one, as
before, applyed himself no more to Consult their General Good.</P>
<P>But considering them in their separate Capacity, as two Nations
that could not long Agree, made it his whole Study, either first
to subject <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> so as that making her Dependent on
<HI>England,</HI> she should not be able to Break with him; or so to di∣vide
the <HI>Scots</HI> among themselves, as that they should be in no Con∣dition
to Hurt him.</P>
<P>Both his Ends seemed easie to Answer in the Occasion that now
offered it selt; for the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility being, <HI>as I have Noted,</HI> so
equally divided in the Interests of <HI>Baliol</HI> and <HI>Bruce,</HI> that they knew
not what Course to take, they resolved, in order to avoid the
Confusions of a War, and consequently the Ruin of their Countrey,
to refer it to the Arbitriment of the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This was a full Testimony of the Harmony and good Under∣standing
which was then between the Nations, and what a happy
Juncture it had been for a Union, if Heaven had thought fit to
bless the Design with Success, any body may observe; for the King
of <HI>England</HI> was looked upon as such a Disinterested Friend to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and one that would willingly concern himself for their Good,
that they leave the Determination of the weightiest Thing in the
World, <HI>to their Nation,</HI> wholly to his Sentence.</P>
<P>But I can not say the King Acted with equal Candor to the <HI>Scots,</HI>
if what the Histories of those Times say, may be depended upon;
For being a politick Prince, and having along View of the Effcts
of Things before him, he resolved to keep his Eye upon the two
Particulars Noted above, in his Determining this Affair, and rather
to regard his own Interest than the Good of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or than the
Justice of the Claim; he resolved to Sound the Inclinations of
the two Canditates for the Crown, and so to give the Kingdom to
him, that would conform himself most to his Measures.</P>
<P>Upon this he Treats first with the Nobility, and appoints a Meet∣ing
at <HI>Berwick,</HI> then he Exacts an Outh of the Competitors, to stand
intirely to and be Determined by his Award; Then he orders a
Select Number out of the Nobility or each Nation, as a Council in
this Case, Twelve of a Side, Mr. <HI>Tyrrel</HI> says, Fourty of a Side, and
<PB N="12" REF="60"/>
Exacts an Oath of them, to Advise, Judge, and Determine Rightly
and Truly according to their Consciences.</P>
<P>These were the Politick Appearances of his Management, the
better to cover his true Design; for all this while he causes the
two Competitors to be Sounded Under-hand, to find out which
was most likely to Comply with his Demands.</P>
<P>At last, the publick Debates beginning to draw near a Period, it
was easie to see, That <HI>Baliols</HI> Title was like to be Approved by the
Twenty Four, as the best Claim, and that <HI>Bruce</HI> would lose it, this
the King thought, was the Juncture to put it home in, and there∣fore
causes' it to be proposed to <HI>Bruce</HI> That tho' it was plain he
would lose the Crown, yet if he would subject himself and the
Crown, to the Authority of the King of <HI>England,</HI> he should be im∣mediately
Declared.</P>
<P>All Men must Allow it was Politickly Managed, <HI>but all the Cra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft of
Hell is lost upon an honest Man, Bruce</HI> like a Man of Honour, Re∣jects
the Proposal with Contempt, and told them that proposed it,
That <HI>he scorned to enjoy the Crown at the Price of his Countries
Bondage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Baliol,</HI> whole Principle was worse, tho' his Title was better, Ac∣cepts
the base Conditions, and obtains the Crown, Swears Fealty
to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and makes all the Nobility that were in
his Interest, do the same.</P>
<P>All our Historians do not agree in this Account, and Mr. <HI>Tyrrel,</HI>
who is very particular in relating the Proceedings, <HI>Vol. 3. Lib.</HI> 9.
<HI>Fol.</HI> 70, 71, 72. takes no Notice of this, but others, and parti∣cularly
<HI>Buchanan</HI> being very positive, <HI>Lib. 8. Fol.</HI> 24. I put it
down as Fact, giving my Authors Authority for it, and leave the
Reader to believe as much as he thinks sit of the Fact, the Subject I
am upon, not depending upon it at all.</P>
<P>But he that basely yields to a Dishonsft Yoke, in order to Gratifie
his Ambition, is much more likely to break the Conditions he
makes, than he that adheres to Honourable Articles, and insists on
what Justice gives him a Claim to, and thus it was here, for on the
first Affront offered to <HI>Baliol</HI> by the <HI>English,</HI> in consequence of his
Subjection he threw off the Yoke, and Renounced that Subjection;
The Case in short was as follows.</P>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Maceduss</HI> Earl of Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sc beingt Injured, as he conceives, in a Suit
Depending between him and the <HI>Abernethians,</HI> for the Murder of his
elder Brother, <HI>The King having Determined in Favour of the Murde∣rere,</HI>
Appeals to the the King of <HI>England</HI> agaist <HI>Baliol</HI>—; When
the Cause came to be heard, <HI>John Babiol</HI> was then at the <HI>English</HI>
Court, and being present when he was Called to Answer, offers to
Pleat by a Proxy, <HI>or as we say to be heard by his Council,</HI> but was
refused, and obliged to come down, and stand at the Bar like a
Criminal, and plead for himself.</P>
<P>This broke off all his Subjection, fills him with Indignation; and
from this Time he Studies nothing but Revenge; an Opportunity
soon offered to his Mind, for a War breaking out between the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="61"/>
and the <HI>French,</HI> and both Soliciting <HI>Scotland</HI> for Aid, the Estates
of <HI>Scotland</HI> Determine, <HI>Tho' in an ill Hour for Scotland,</HI> to Assist the
<HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Thus all the good Temper of both Nations one towards another
Vanished at once, and the most Bloody Wars that ever this Island
felt, happened between them.</P>
<P><HI>Baliol</HI> by a solemn Embassy, Renounces his Submission to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
as Extorted by unjust Methods, and his Friendship also—;
And <HI>Edward</HI> in Return, suriously Invades <HI>Scotland</HI> both by Sea
and Land.</P>
<P>Tis not at all my Design, nor to my Purpose, to enter here in∣to
the History of these Wars, or the Battels, Ravages, Fire and
Blood, which the two Nations felt during the whole Reign of the
three <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> with but small Intermission; the par∣ticulars
whereof would ot themselves make a large Volume—;
The true Reason of my mentioning these Things, will appear in
my further prosecuting this Story: The short Use of it is this, That
these two unhappy Nations were always in Extremes with one
another; Nothing but the <HI>closest Union,</HI> or the most destructive
<HI>War,</HI> can be the State they must live in together; And this I shall
but too often make evident in these Sheets.</P>
<P>From this Breach, the War between the Nations came to a strange
height, <HI>Edward</HI> proved Victorious over the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Conse∣quences
of that are easie to Guess, <HI>Baliol</HI> was Crusht, his Armies
Overthrown, the Countrey Pierc't, even to the Extremest part by
the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> calls <HI>Bruce</HI> to his Side, <HI>Baliol</HI> is taken Prisoner and Sur∣renders
the Kingdom, then the Famous <HI>Wallace</HI> gets up, and carries
on the War on the Subject of meer National Liberty, Overthrows
the <HI>English in several Encounters,</HI> and is made Regent: But is again
Overthrown by <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Bruce</HI> at the great Battel of <HI>Falkirk,</HI>
and <HI>Scotland</HI> then intirely submits to <HI>Edward,</HI> whose Tyrannical
Government makes the very <HI>Scots</HI> who had taken part with him
against <HI>Baliol,</HI> Conspire together to Recover their Liberty and
one <HI>Cuming</HI> Leaguing with <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> Son to that <HI>Bruce</HI> who
was to have been King; These, tho' Enemies before, joyn together
to free their Countrey. But <HI>Cuming</HI> designing to Betray <HI>Bruce,</HI> is
Killed by him with his own Hands in the very Church at <HI>Drum∣fries.</HI></P>
<P>How <HI>Bruce</HI> after this Recovered the Kingdom from that Subjecti∣on
to the <HI>English;</HI> How he was often Overthrown by Edward and
several times reduced to hide himself in the Mountains, and most
secret Places of the Kingdom, and sometimes so long, that he was
supposed to be Dead;—How yet at last by innumerable Attempts
Unwearied Pains, and Invincible Courage lie retrived his fortune,
Drove the <HI>English</HI> out of his Countrey, Overthrew them with a
terrible Slaughter at <HI>Bannockburn</HI> near <HI>Stirling,</HI> and after a Reign of
Twenty Four Years full of continual War, against the most power∣ful
Princes <HI>England</HI> had in these Ages of the World; he Died in
<PB N="14" REF="62"/>
Peace, his Countrey being Recovered out of their Hands; These
Things would be too long a Story here to relate.</P>
<P>In this War, by the best Calculations I can make, of Armies
Raised, and Battels Fought, no less than Six Hundered Thousand
People of both Nations perished, and all for want of that happy
UNION, so near persected, and so disastruously lost. A good
Looking glass for those Gentlemen (<HI>who have openly wished these
Nations might make a Breach either on one Side or another</HI>) to look
into, and for them to see, <HI>if their Designs had succeeded,</HI> what their
Posterity might have had cause to Thank them for.</P>
<P><HI>If it be Objected,</HI> that it does not follow, That on a Breach of
this last Treaty of <HI>Union</HI> a War must necessarily have happened, I
shall take the Liberty to enter upon that Head by it self, and believe
these Sheets will prove, That a War must have been the inevitable
Consequence of breaking up this last Treaty, especially if broken
up according to the Project of those People that appeared to Op∣pose
it, who, we all know, acted on Principles, both as to Trade,
Civil Government, and Succession, Incompatible with the Interest
of both the present Establishments, and as much as can be said
perfectly impracticable, as the Kingdoms were thus Constituted;
But of this more hereafter.</P>
<P>From this Time, we meet with no Overtures of settled Tran∣quillity
between the Kingdoms, till the Days of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. of
<HI>England,</HI> whose Daughter <HI>Margaret</HI> was Married to James IV. King
of <HI>Scotland</HI>—; And tho' this Marriage was the Mother of Uni∣on
(as I may Term it) and laid the foundation of almost all
the Projects that have happened since, and from whence at last the
Crown of <HI>England</HI> Devolved upon the Royal Line of <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet
in his Time there were no immediate Steps taken towards it. The
outmost Effect of this Marriage, was an immediate Peace between
the Nations, which, however, did not last long, but King <HI>James</HI>
falling in with the <HI>French</HI> Interest, fell out with his Father-in-law
King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and after with his Brother King Henry VIII. and
lost his Life in that War.</P>
<P>The first Attempt subsequent to this, was a Proposal of <HI>Henry</HI>
VIII. who, after this great Quarrel was ended, tho' he was Victor,
offered to <HI>Match his Daughter</HI> Mary (<HI>Prince</HI> Edward, <HI>afterwards
King</HI> Edward VI. <HI>being then not Born</HI>) to <HI>James</HI> the 5th. King of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and to secure the Possession of the Crown after himself to
them Joyntly; And the design of this Match, <HI>it was evident,</HI> could
be nothing <HI>else, but a firm, lasting,</HI> and established Peace between
the two Nations; For having himself no Sons, and expecting none,
(<HI>For the business of the Divorce of his Wife Queen</HI> Katharine <HI>was not
then come into his Head</HI>) He foresaw this was the only Step to
Unite the Nations, and put an End to these Bloody Contentions,
that for so many Ages had been between them, for that the Heirs
of that Match would by consequence be possest of both, and so the
whole Island would become one Happy and most powerful People,
United in Interest, in Government, and in every Thing that would
make them Great.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="63"/>
This Proposal was so Rational, and so visibly tending to the
general Advantage of both Kingdoms, That it Could not be sup∣posed
to meet with any Opposition from such, as were in the least
concerned for the Good of their Native Country on either Hand.</P>
<P><HI>On the</HI> English <HI>Side</HI> it met with an immediate good Reception
for King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, contrary to the general Conduct of that Prince,
whose Temper was (generally speaking) Bloody, Fierce, Haugh∣ty,
and too apt to Insult such as fell into his Hands; Yet here
changing his Temper, he caused the <HI>Scots</HI> Prisoners, taken at the
late Battel, to be very well Treated, and Committed to the several
Keepings of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, who used them Honourably and
according to their Quality.</P>
<P>I know it is said, That the King, who had this Project first in
his Head, distributed the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen in the Houses of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Lords, That these might, according to his private Instructions,
deal with them apart, and strive, by Promises, and such like Ar∣guments,
to bring them to hearken to such a Proposal, and to be∣gin
the Treaty—; And that the said <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen were by
this Artifice, prompted, and brought to make the first Offer of this
Marriage, as from <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But let this be as it will, let the Honour of the Proposal ly where
it will, it is manifest, both Parties were well pleased with it and
look'd upon it as the best Method, to bring both Nations to a State
of Prosperous and Durable Peace. But <HI>Satan hindered.</HI></P>
<P>It was evident, That both Kingdoms had a fixed Inclination at
this time, for the Union: <HI>Henry</HI> shewed his Good Will, in that
he offered to heap up unusual Honours upon the King of <HI>Scotland</HI>
upon the first project of the Match, as upon his undoubted Successor
to the Crown, such as making him a Peer of Britain by the Royal
Title of Duke of <HI>York,</HI> a Title Vested in the Crown, and since the
Father of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, reckoned the next Step to the Throne;
But this was not all, he offered to declare him Lord Lieutenant or
Deputy Governour of <HI>England,</HI> immediately upon the Match; This
was to put the Government, as it were, in his actual Possession and
make him King by the Consequence of the Thing—; There it
no doubt, but, had this Match succeeded, there would have been
mutual Stipulations of a compleat Coalition entred into by the
respective Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>But <HI>French</HI> and Popish Counsls <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ented this Happy Conjuncti∣on,
as they have several others fini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word <HI>and would have done the last;</HI>
For the Clergy of <HI>Scotland</HI> finding <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. of <HI>England</HI> had
crusht the Power of the Clergy in <HI>England,</HI> and was suppressing
the Abbeys and Monasteries, curbing the extended Authority of the
Pope, and as they apprehended destroing their Church, they set
themselves by all possibly Artifice, to prevent this Proposals taking
Effect; And getting the <HI>French</HI> King to joyn his Interest with their,
they wrought the King of <HI>Scotland</HI> to such a Dislike of the Match,
That he rejected King <HI>Henry's</HI> Proposal with some Indec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eucies, re∣fused
him an Interview at <HI>York,</HI> tho' he had given his Word to
<PB N="16" REF="64"/>
meet him there—; This King <HI>Henry</HI> so resented, That a War
immediately followed, (as upon a Defeat of an Union has gene∣rally
happened) in which War, the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility were so sensible
of the wrong Measures of their Prince, and the Advantages to their
Country, which he had rashly rejected, That they followed him
very unwillingly, and at last wholly abandoned him at <HI>Solen-Moss,</HI>
Declaring, They thought it was not their Duty to mine their
Country, to gratifie the Passion of their Deluded Monarch, and the
Blinded Fury of the Clergy: This cost King <HI>James</HI> his Life, who
died of Grief, as <HI>Buchanan</HI> relates, <HI>Rerum Scoticarum, Lib. 7. Fol.</HI> 76.</P>
<P>Its true, had this Match gone forward, it had not had the de∣signed
Effect, at least not immediately, because King <HI>Henry</HI> the
VIII. afterwards had a Son born, who succeeded to the Crown (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>Edward</HI> the VI—; But this is not to the present Case, the
Design was the same, nor did it die with the respective Kings—;
Nay, after the Birth of the Young Prince, King <HI>Henry</HI> the VJII. made
a second Proposal of an Union, <HI>viz.</HI> Of a Match between his Son
Edward, and the Daughter of the late King of Scots 5 And this went
so far, as to be Approved in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as may be
seen in the Registers of that Time; But this was again interrupted,
as the former had been, by the Death of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. who
left the Crown to his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the VI.</P>
<P>In this Reign, the Project of Uniting the Kingdoms revived im∣mediately,
for the <HI>English</HI> Council saw clearly the Advantages ac∣cruing
to both Nations by an Union, and could not flip that Happy
Juncture: Their King was a Child not above Nine Years of Age,
the Queen of <HI>Scotland</HI> was the like, left by her Father at Five Days
old, and Crowned in her Cradle: The Regency of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
the Council of Governours of the Young King, revive the Treaty,
and propose a Match between the King of <HI>England</HI> and the Queen of
<HI>Scotland</HI>—, and built it upon the late Agreement made be∣tween
King <HI>Henry</HI> and the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>French</HI> and Poplish Party, who, as I have noted already,
opposed Uniting the Kingdoms before, on the pretence of the Dan∣ger
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, had now much more Reason to do so
Since King <HI>Edward</HI> had declared himself, <HI>as they esteemed it,</HI> an
Heretick, had disowned the Pope, and had erected a Protestant
Church on the Ruine of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Remish;</HI> And on these Arguments they
rejected the Proposal, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their former Agreement.</P>
<P>And here happened, <HI>who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have all along observed to be the Conse∣quence
of breaking up a Treaty, between the Two Nations, viz.</HI> A Bloody
War, like as certainly must have happened again, had not this last
Happy Treaty interveeened, of which I am to Discourse in these
Sheets.</P>
<P>It is not my Busness to enter upon the Particulars of the War on
this Occasion, but two Things it will be necessary to observe, 1st
That this War issued in the Defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Popish Army at the
Battel at <HI>Pinkie,</HI> after which it was expected the Young Queen should
have been delivered to the <HI>English,</HI> and Marryed to their King:
<PB N="17" REF="65"/>
And truly, if the Frank and Generous Offer of the Conquerors had
been in the least regarded, it had been so, who, alter the Victory
made no Spoil or Havock in <HI>Scotland</HI> but, as Friends, made a Fair De∣mand
of their (<HI>the Scots</HI>) Queen to be Married to their (<HI>the English</HI>)
King, That so the Nations being United, might for ever remain
One—; And this is to be seen in that Famous Declaration
of the Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI> the <HI>English</HI> General, which, as it is in a Stile
peculiar, and not usual in the World among Conquerors, I could not
omit, and is in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><SUP>o</SUP>. 11.</P>
<P>But, 1. It was in Vain to Talk Reason to a People resolved; The
Popish Party, who saw evidently the Ruine of their Church, and
the <HI>French,</HI> who saw the Destruction of their Ancient League
wrapt up in the projected Union of the Kingdoms, frustrated all
the Design, by Conveying the Young Princess into <HI>France;</HI> And
so this Scheme came also to nothing.</P>
<P>This had several had Effects, which <HI>Scotland</HI> afterwards Regret∣ed,
<HI>First,</HI> That it delayed the Reformation in <HI>Scotland</HI> for near
Thirty Years after that in <HI>England,</HI> and made it both Difficult,
Bloody, Tedious, and for a long Time Imperfect, of which I have
Treated elsewhere. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It brought her under a <HI>French</HI> Yoke,
and for a long Time she Groaned under the Tyranny of <HI>French</HI> In∣fluence,
till the Nation threw off Tyranny and Popery together,
and Reformation came on Hand in Hand with Liberty.</P>
<P>And now the Notion of Union between the Two Kingdoms be∣gan
to wear out, as a Thing, That, <HI>tho' both Nations had Inclinati∣on
enough to engage in,</HI> yet there was no Juncture to make it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Peasible,
till the Death or Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who dying without Issue, the
<HI>English</HI> Crown devolved upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Line; And this produced
<HI>a kind of Union,</HI> I mean an Union of the Crowns, bur nor an Uni∣on
of the Kingdoms; Of the Imperfection, Deficiency and Incon∣veniency
of which to both Kingdoms, I shall make some brief
Observations, as they have been the Motives to the frequent At∣tempts
for a more near Conjunction in the succeeding Times.</P>
<P>The Inconveniencies to <HI>Scotland</HI> in this partial Union were
<HI>First,</HI> their removing their Court to <HI>England,</HI> their King, accord∣ing
to the Prophetick Saying of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII, removing his Seat
of Government from the less to the greater—; This was natu∣rally
attended with the Decay of Trade in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by removing
the Concouse of Strangers from <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Consumption of
Provisions and Manufactures, which arc the Foundation of Com∣merce,
was a great Loss to Trade—; With the Exporting their
ready Money our of the Kingdom, by the constant Attendance of
their Gentry and Nobility at the <HI>English</HI> Court, where they spent
their Estates, and suck'd out the Blood of their Country, to support
their Luxury and Magnificence—; With the continued empty∣ing
their Nation of their People, who all flocked to <HI>England,</HI> ei∣ther
for publick or private Employment, and Depopulated, as well
as impoverished, their Native Country; <HI>But above all,</HI> the bringing
<HI>Scotland</HI> under <HI>English</HI> Influence, both as to Civil and Religious
<PB N="18" REF="66"/>
Government, was a manifest Token of the Deficiency of this partial
Union; For <HI>Scotland</HI> was after this, in a Political Sense, tho' not
in a Legal Sense, always under the Management of the <HI>English</HI> Court:
It had the Subjection without the Advantages—; Her Sea∣men
were press'd into the <HI>English</HI> Service as Subjects, yet, at the
same time, excluded the Merchants Service as Foreigners, an <HI>English</HI>
Ship Sailed with above one Third <HI>Scots</HI> Men would be seized, as
not being Sailed by <HI>English</HI> Men, and the Colonies of <HI>England</HI> were
at last all barred from them, as much as from the <HI>French or Dutch;</HI>
It would be too long a Digression, to recite here the various Incon∣veniencies
<HI>Scotland</HI> laboured under, from the Deficiency of this
partial, or meerly Regal Union, and which made all the Well∣Wishers
to <HI>Scotland</HI> desire, either that there were a more intire
Union, or that there were no Union at all—</P>
<P>Nor was this unforeseen by either Nation, and therefore, no
sooner was King <HI>James</HI> the VI. of <HI>Scotland</HI> come to the Crown of
<HI>English,</HI> but he began (before he had lear'd quite to forget his
own Country) to project a more near Union of the Nations, as the
only way to make them both compleatly Happy; This was in the
Year 604—, when, <HI>after several Projects of Uniting by his
own Absolute Authority, a Thing then newly taken up in the World,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>finding all other Methods fail, he proposed it to the Parliament of
<HI>England, that,</HI> to use his own Words, <HI>as they were made One in the
Head, they might be inseparably Conjoined, and all Memory of past Di∣visions
Be Extinguished;</HI> At the same time he proposed it in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and both Nations were so sensible of the mutual Advantages
of Union, That they readily agreed to it, and Commissioners were
appointed on both Sides to Treat. The Names of the Commissio∣ners
were as follows,</P>
<Q>For Scotland.</Q>

<P>We do not find among our Authors any particular of the Debates
of these Commissioners: <HI>Spotswood</HI> in his History <HI>Fol.</HI> 481. gives in
a Draught of the Articles they agreed on, which for want to Room
I only refer the Reader to, but having obtained from good hands
a Manuscript of <HI>Six George Mackenzies,</HI> being a little like a Journal
of their Proceedings, I could not but think it very much to the
purpose, to insert it in the Appendix to this Work, where may be
seen the true Ground Plat of the present Union, and the Interest
of both Kingdoms, clearly stated—as it stood then, and saving
in matters of Religion remains still, see Appendix N 12.</P>
<P>These Articles thus mutually agreed, were Engrossed and Signed
by the Commissioners on both Sides, and presented to the King the
<HI>6th. of December</HI> 1604—; But it was observed That the Earl
of <HI>Salisburry</HI> at the presenting the Draught to the King, expressed
it to be the meaning of the Commissioners. That these Articles were
but an imperfect Agreement, and that they were willing to finish
and go through the same when ever he plessed.</P>
<P>However, the King offered it to the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and
as <HI>Spotswood</HI> says, Recommended it Earnestly to them; But the
more secret History of that Affair, was, That the King himself fal∣ling
in at that Time with the <HI>English</HI> Clergy, and Opposing the Pros∣perity
of his own Countrey, upon the Score of Religion and abso∣lute
Will, found Ways and Means to puzzle this Cause in Parliament;
and <HI>First,</HI> The difficulty of the <HI>Post-Nati, a Thing, which had the</HI> Eng∣lish
<HI>at that Time purposed a Hearty Union,</HI> would never have stuck with
them, occasioned long Struggle, and at last the Parliament referr'd
it to the Common Law; While this was doing; the National
Aversion, particularly in <HI>England,</HI> seemed to revive, and the pub∣lick
<PB N="20" REF="68"/>
Appearances in <HI>England</HI> of a Spirit of Division, were such, <HI>as
one observes,</HI> That very well discover'd the King was become <HI>an
English Man,</HI> otherwise he would never have born with those In∣vectives
and Railings at <HI>Scotland,</HI> which Sir <HI>Thomas Craig</HI> in his
Book De <HI>Unione Regnorum,</HI> says, were then publickly used in the
Pulpits and in Printed Books, while their King was a Scotsman.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but the King in stead of forwarding the Union
of the two Kingdoms, or promoting the particular Advantage of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> fell in with the arbitrary Projects of that Time, to make
himself Absolute in <HI>Scotland—,</HI> as he was also doing in <HI>England.</HI>
This would lead me into a vast Ocean of National Confusions,
which received their Rise and Conception in the Tyrannical Tem∣per
of this Prince, in which he laid the Foundation of the Ruine of
his Posterity, which as remote to my present Business, purposely I
Omit.</P>
<P>As to Union, nothing further was done till the year 1660—,
and till that Time, which was about 56 years, the Subjects of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
enjoyed a Freedom of Commerce in Common with the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
to all the <HI>English,</HI> Colonies; But then some Acts in England
passing in prejudice of that Freedom of Commerce, the <HI>Scots</HI> re∣newed
their Complaints, and a Commission says, Sir <HI>George Mac∣kenzie</HI>
was granted in the 3<HI>d.</HI> Session ot the first Parliament of
<HI>Charles</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by an Act at the same time in England,
Nominating Commissioners to Adjust these Differences; This was in
1666.</P>
<P>These Commissioners met the 21<HI>st. January</HI> 1667, and the <HI>Scots</HI>
Commissioners gave in a Proposal to the <HI>English,</HI> for settling the
Differences about Trade, which Paper I have also given you from
an Original Manuscript ol the said Sir <HI>George Mackenzie,</HI> and which
you will find in the Appendix No. 13.</P>
<P>The Debates which followed this Paper, says Sir <HI>George,</HI> served
only to shew the King the Necessity of Commencing a further Treaty,
<HI>viz.</HI> Of a Union, and how Ineffectual all other Treaties would be
to bring about the publick Peace of the two Nations.</P>
<P>To this End, a Parliament being called in <HI>Scotland</HI> the 19<HI>th.</HI> of
<HI>October</HI> 1667, and the <HI>English</HI> Parliament meeting the same Day,
he caused the great Affair of an Union to be proposed to both at
the same time; The Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by their Letter to the
King, expressed their Readiness to concur with the Poposal; And
that they would grant Commission to such, as His Majesty should
Nominate for that Purpose, to Treat as their Representatives; And
left it to the King to Name the Time, Place, and Quorum of their
Meetings—; This being the Substance of the Letter, I have
omitted the Letter it self, which is to be seen in the Registers in
<HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England, by what Affairs obstructed I shall not
determine,</HI> did nothing in it that Session, but reca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llumed it in 1670,
and Impowered the King by an Act 22.<HI>Carol.</HI> 2. almost in the Terms
the <HI>Scots</HI> had done before.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="69"/>
The Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> pursuant to this, granted a Com∣mission
for a Treaty, which was almost <HI>Verbatim</HI> the same with that
granted In <HI>England;</HI> that no Debates might arise between the
Commissioners of both Kingdoms, about the Difference of their
Commissions, as had fallen out in the year 1604.</P>
<P>And because I shall endeavour to relate Matter of Fact, Abstracted
from my own Observations in this History, I have with some Diffi∣culty,
obtained an Original Manuscript of the Minutes of this
short Treaty—; Which are as follows.</P>

<HEAD>Wednesday the 14 of September 1670.</HEAD>
<P>“In the two and twentieth year of the Reign of our Sove∣reign
Lord <HI>Charles</HI> the second, by the Grace of GOD, of <HI>Eng∣land,
Scotland, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> King, Defender of the

An, Act authorizing certain Commissioners of the Realm
Of <HI>England,</HI> to Treat with the Commissioners of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the
Well of both Kingdoms; And in the same year, an Act passed
in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the same Effect.”</P>
<P>“In pursuance of which Acts, and His Majesties Commissi∣ons
under the Great Seals of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Com∣missioners
in the said Commissions named, are all this day in
the Exchequer Chamber at <HI>Westiminster,</HI> where His Majesties

by the Clerk attending the Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI>
and also His Majesties Commission under the Great Seal of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Clerk attending the Commissioners for <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
Which being done, The Lord Keeper of the Great
Seal of <HI>England,</HI> did let their Lordships know, That His
Majesty had appointed <HI>Somerset-House</HI> for their future Sitting
in this Affair, and (by consent of all their Lordships) Ad∣journed
their next Meeting to be at <HI>Somerset-House</HI> on <HI>Satur∣day</HI>

<P>“This day the Commissioners of both Kingdoms being met,
the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> delivered to
the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> Lord High Commissioner for <HI>Scotland,</HI>
a Copy in Parchment of His Majesties Commission under the
Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> Attested by the Clerk attending the
<PB N="22" REF="70"/>
<HI>English</HI> Commissioners, and received from his Lordship the
like Copy of the Commission under the Great Seal of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
Then their Lordships received a Message from His Ma∣jesty
in Writing, and Heads therein proposed to be Treated
of; which being Read, the Commissioners of both King∣doms
agreed, to consider against their next Meeting, in
what Method to proceed upon His Majesties Message, and
also in what manner their Lordships shall deliver their Opi∣nions
at their General Meetings, upon which the next Ge∣neral
Meeting of the Commissioners was Adjourned to <HI>Thurs∣day</HI>
the as of <HI>September</HI> instant, at Nine a Clock in the Fore∣noon.
After this Adjournment, the Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
withdrew into their own Chamber, among themselves,
to consider of the Method of their Proceedings in this Trea∣ty.</P>
<P>“Where first the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and the
Lord <HI>Ailingtoun</HI> acquainted the rest of the Commissioners
then present. That His Majesty had appointed Mr. <HI>John
Walker</HI> to attend their Lordships as their Clerk, which their
Lordships approved of, and ordered that he should subscribe
their Orders and Papers; (By Order of the Commissioners
for the Kingdom of <HI>England, John Walker</HI> Clerk.”</P>
<P>“Then upon Debate, it was resolved, That nothing which
shall be in Debate or Assented, shall be taken as the Opinion
or Resolution of the Commissioners of either Kingdom, or
drawn into consequence, or any way made use of, un∣less
the whole be mutually Agreed to: Also, that their
Lordships would not Treat by Papers, (as in the Treaty of
1667,) but that the joynt Resolutions of the Commissioners
at their General Meetings only, be reduced into Writing,
and Entred by both their Clerks. <HI>Next,</HI> It was resolved, That
these two Propositions be offered to the Commissioners for
<HI>Scotland,</HI> at their Lordships next General Meeting, as Pre∣luminaries
to be joyntly Agreed and Resolved on.”</P>
<P>“Then were Read the several Heads offered to their Lord∣ships
Consideration, in His Majesties Message, and upon De∣bate,
it was Agreed, That the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal
let the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> (at the next General Meet∣ing)
know, That upon due consderation had, their Lord∣ships
offered the third Head proposed in His Mas∣sage
(<HI>viz.</HI> The Uniting both Kingdoms into one Monarchy
under His Majesty, his Heirs and Successors inspstsnly) to
be the First Point to be Debated, and then, That his Lordship
desire the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to propose on which
of the two first Heads to proceed next; But that their Lord∣ships
were of Opinion, not to proceed on the fourth or fifth
Heads, till the others be agreed to.</P>

<HEAD>Thursday the 22d. of September 1670.</HEAD>
<P>“Before the General Meeting of the Commissioners of both
Kingdoms, this day the Commissioners for England met in their
own Chamber, and it was agreed, That what the Lord Keeper
shall propose at the General Meeting, be done in the Name
of the Commissioners.</P>
<P>“Then the Commissioners of both Kingdoms being met, the
Lord Keeper of the Great Seal offered to the Board what the
Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> had agreed on, on <HI>Saturday</HI> last, as
Preliminaries for the better proceeding in this Treaty, the
Substance whereof being assented to by the Commissioners for
<HI>Scotland,</HI> it was agreed, the Committee of the Commissioners
of both Kingdoms should be appointed for the Wording of
what was agreed to, and to Report unto the Board.</P>
<P>“Also his Lordship proposed the Third Head in His Maje∣sties
Message to be the First Article to be debated, which was
assented to by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland;</HI> But some
Objection being made against the Words (<HI>And Successors</HI>) in
that Head, the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> withdrew to their
Chamber to consider thereof, and what Words were sit to be
assented to; Where, after some Debate, their Lordships re∣solved.
That, if che Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> at their
Lordships Return, should insist upon leaving out these Words,
(<HI>And Successors</HI>) to yield to them therein.</P>
<P>“While the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> were in their Cham∣ber,
a Message was brought from the Commissioners for <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
by their Clerk, to know whether their Lordships would
Name their Committee there, or at the Board; Upon which
their Lordships Named the Earl of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> Matter Attourney
General, and Sir <HI>Leoline Jenkins,</HI> and returned Answer, That
they had Named a Committee of their Commissioners.</P>
<P>“Then the Commissioners returning to the General Meeting,
after some Debate upon the Third Head, agreed to leave out
the Words (<HI>And Successors</HI>), and that the Monarchy be Stiled
by the Name of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Then the Lords Commssio∣ners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> let their Lordships know, That they had ap∣pointed
the Earl of <HI>Kincardine,</HI> the Lord Advocate, and Sir

to the Consideration of the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> Whe∣ther

<Q>And never met more.</Q>
<P>Any one that peruses this short Treaty, or rather Conference,
may see, That these Times were not Tempered for an Effectual
Union; And those that know any Thing of the Secret History of
that Day, will also know, there were private Designs then on
Foot, which made a nearer Union, inconsistent with the Views of
the Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> insisted on a Conjunction of Parliaments, not an In∣corporation
of Foundations, <HI>as has now been proposed; England</HI>
durst never hear of such a Conjunction of Parliaments, on Account
of Church Matters; Knowing, That, tho' Episcopacy was then
Established in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet, that the Secret Bent o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Nation
was Presbyterian; and they durst not think of a Conjunction of
Houses on that Score.</P>
<P>And here I would ask leave of the Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who
have Opposed the present Union, in regard of its Hazard to the
Presbyterian Church, <HI>to Re-mind them,</HI> what reason they have to
look back to the Days of this Treaty, <HI>and be Thankful,</HI> That the
Union was not Compassed at this Time; and to consider why they
should have ventured putting it off to a further Time, sinice, had
it happned in that Time, when Episcopacy had the Face of a legal
Establishment in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Presbyterian Church had for ever
sunk under its Weight, and been Exploded by the Laws of both
Kingdoms; both Kingdoms had been obliged to keep it down,
and it could never, <HI>Miracles excepted,</HI> have recovered it self in that
Nation.</P>
<P>Ami thus I have Traced the several Endeavours to Unite these
Kingdoms in former Times, in which I have been as Breif as I can:
I shall conclude this with only one Remark, which I believe will
appear to be just; Thro' the whole Course of the several Treaties
hithe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> anmed, the firs excepted, which was disappointed by
a meer Judgment from Heaven, <HI>I mean the death of the Maid of</HI>
Norway; All the rest of the Proposals for Union between these
Kingdoms, met with their particular Obstructions from Popery,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Interest, Hence Tyranny or Court-Intrigues; These were
<PB N="31" REF="79"/>
the only Enemies of Union, and I believe it may, without Partia∣lity
be added, <HI>AND SO IT IS NOW.</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to the present Times, King <HI>James</HI> the II: in
<HI>England,</HI> or VII. in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had no other Union in View, but
that of Uniting all his Kingdoms, to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and
this put him upon Measures perfectly distinct tram all that had gone
before him, from whence we have had Two Famous <HI>Revolutions</HI> in
<HI>Britain,</HI> one in the Regal State of both Kingdoms, the other in the
Ecclesiastick State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from Episcopal to Presbyterian:
—This was no sooner brought to pass, but <HI>Scotland</HI> put the
King in mind of their Desires to Unite, in their Letter to King <HI>Wil∣liam;</HI>
Of which presently—. But all that Prince's Reign, this
good Design met with Obstructions, of which I shall be some∣thing
particular in its place. And thus we are brought down to
Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> in whose Reign this great Work was once Attempted,
but proved Abortive, and at the second Essay was brought to
Perfection, as will be seen in the Sequel of this Story.</P>

<HEAD>OF
AFFAIRS
IN BOTH
KINGDOMS,
INTRODUCTORY OF
A TREATY of UNION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon the Proceedings in the Reign of Queen
<HI>ANNE,</HI> towards a General Union of these Kingdoms, it is
absolutely necessary to the right Understanding of Things, to
take a short View of the Posture of Publick Affairs in the respective
Kingdoms, and what it was that rendred the Union so absolutely
Necessary at this Time, that to all Considering People, who made
any tolerable Judgment of Things, it was plain, there was no
other way left, to prevent the most Bloody War that ever had been
between the two Nations.</P>
<P>At the Revolution, as has been already Noted, and several times
during the Reign of the late King <HI>William,</HI> Motions had been
made frequently both on the King's Side and on the Peoples also, to
come to a Treaty; But that Prince had always one Thing or other
cast in his Way, to prevent his good Design.</P>
<P>The King was often heard to say. That this Island could never
be Easie without a Union, and if either of them understood their
own Happiness, they would never rest till it was brought to pass.
And, as I had the Honour to mention it once among other
Things, in a Scheme of General Peace among the Protestant In∣terests
in <HI>Europe, I ran not forget,</HI> That His Majesty Expressing
some Concern at it, Returned, <HI>I have done all I can in that Affair,
but I do not see a Temper in either Nation that looks tike it</HI>—;
And added, after some other Discourse, <HI>It may be done, but not
yet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="81"/>
During the whole Reign of this Prince, the Breaches between
the two Kindgdoms rather Widened and Increased, than tended
to a Close, and several National Unkindnesses past between them,
which prepared both Sides as it were to Reflect upon, and Re∣proach
the other; There wanted not also a Set of wicked Instru∣ments
always to blow the Coals of Discord between the Kingdoms
into a Flame, and if possible, to bring the Nations to a Rupture.</P>
<P>Some of these Passages which, I say, tended to Estrange the Na∣tions,
and as it were prepare them fot a Breach, rather than for
an Union, were these,</P>
<P>The settling an <HI>African or Indian</HI> Company in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
the several Clashings of Interest between the two Nations on
that Head.</P>
<P>The Affairs of <HI>Glenco.</HI></P>
<P>The Difficulties about the Succession and Limitations.</P>
<P>The Act of Security there.</P>
<P>The Act in <HI>England</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act for preventing Dangers
arising from the Act of Security in</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>The Seizing the Ship the <HI>Worcester,</HI> and Execution of Cap∣tain
<HI>Green,</HI> and several others—.</P>
<P>All these Things concurred, to convince those that had the least
Knowledge of Affairs in both Kingdoms, that nothing but an Uni∣on
could prevent the Nations falling all to pieces, as soon as ever
the Queen should Die, if not sooner; and that therefore it was
immediately and heartily to be set about, as the only way to pre∣serve
the publick Tranquillity, and prevent the certain Mischiefs
that threatned the whole Body.</P>
<P>I shall not enter into a particular History of these several Cases,
as being too tedious for this Tract, but as 'tis necessary to say some∣thing
to convey the right Understanding of these Matters
to Posterity, and that more regularly to introduce the General Thing
I am upon, <HI>viz.</HI> The Union, I cannot wholly Omit them.</P>
<P>And <HI>First, For the African Company,</HI> the large Commission that
Company obtained, by which they seem'd to Rival the <HI>English,</HI> both
in their <HI>Guinca, East-India,</HI> and <HI>West-India</HI> Trade, was ill relish'd
who at that Time were in an Odd and Unsettled
Posture, as to those Trades at Home. And as this is not rightly un∣derstood
by a great many, that run round about for Reasons of the
<HI>English</HI> Parliament's falling upon that Affair, it may not be a miss to
set it in a clearer Light.</P>
<P>The <HI>English East India</HI> Trade, being for a long time Prescrib'd
in the narrow Limits of an exclusive Company, who Tyrannized
not a little in their absolute Management of that Trade, and be∣came
came Gricvous to the rest of the Merchants, many Attempts were
made to lay open their Stock, and Increase so great, and so Benc∣ficial
a Trade; But the Company withstood all the Attempts that
way, and kept all Invaders off; till at last by the mighty Advance
os Two Millions to the Government, the <HI>New East-Indian</HI> Company
got a Charter, and set up against them—; How they Rival'd
<PB N="34" REF="82"/>
one another, and with mighty Struggles, too much Embarrassed
the whole Nation; till the King himself was obliged to concern
himself in Uniting them, and how he brought that great Work to
pass, are Things not so much to my present purpose; But at this
time, <HI>viz. 26 June</HI> 1695, the <HI>Scots</HI> Company obtained their Settle∣ment.</P>
<P>What ever Prospects the Projectors of that Company had in their
View, some of which will, <HI>I doubt,</HI> hardly bear a History, I
never heard one of them pretend, That either the Stock to carry it
on, or the Market for their Trade, could be found in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
from hence, with other particular Objections, which I believe they
never Debated, I pretend to say, They could never really pro∣pose
any rational probability of Success.</P>
<P>If they imagined to obtain Help from Abroad, they indeed were
in the right, for they could not but know, That the Merchants in
<HI>England</HI> would leap at a Proposal to get into the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade,
free from the Bondage of the Company mentioned before—;
But if they imagined also, That this could do less than Embark
the <HI>English</HI> Government against them, and bring the Publick to
concern themselves about it, they were exceeding Short-sighted, or
must at the same Time believe, the other very Ignorant in the
Affairs before them.</P>
<P>The first Step the Company took, was to open Books for Sub∣scriptions
at <HI>London,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and this was
no sooner done, but the <HI>English</HI> Company took the Alarm at both;
and obtained by their Interest with the Government, Instructions
to the <HI>English</HI> Resident at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> to Oppose it there, which
was done most effectually. The <HI>English</HI> Resident, as it was said, ta∣citely
Threatning the <HI>Hamburghers,</HI> That the <HI>English</HI> should remove
their Staple of Cloth to the City of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and ruine the Trade
of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> whether he did actually Threaten them so or no, I do
not Affirm, but 'tis certain, he so managed Affairs, that the
Subscriptions begun there, were stopt, and the Design on that Side
effectually ruined; Then they, <HI>I mean the</HI> English East-India <HI>Com∣pany,</HI>
Applyed themselves to the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, and by offer∣ing
plausible Reasons there, soon obtained their Votes against it,
also, and against any of the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> Subscribing to it,
and the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants who had subscribed in <HI>England,</HI> were or∣dered
to be Impeacht of a Misdemcanour, tho' the Parliament
being near a Close, those Impeachments dropt of course.</P>
<P>These things had the desired Effect, for they crushed the Attempt
of raising a <HI>New</HI> East-India <HI>Company</HI> in these Parts of the World,
and the Projectors then played their other Game of <HI>Darien,</HI> in
which they had the same Unhappiness, <HI>viz.</HI> To put the <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion
under a Necessity of Opposing them.</P>
<P>I do readily allow, the first Scheme of a Trade to the <HI>East-Indies</HI>
had a Probability of Success in it, a Thing I can not grant to the
Affair of <HI>Daricn;</HI> which, I think, had not one Branch belonging
to its Contrivance, but what was Big with necessary Abortions,
<PB N="35" REF="83"/>
such as remote Mines of Gold to be gained and maintained by
Force against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in which <HI>England</HI> could not without
Breach of Faith assist, such as a Trade for <HI>European</HI> Goods with the
Spanish Colonies, which must always have been by Force or by
Stealth, and neither of these had any Rational Probability.</P>
<P>As to their Trade over Land to the South Seas, and thence to
the <HI>Indies,</HI> tho' much boasted of, it answers for it self, and seems
a too Impracticable Whimsy to merit and Reply, much like that
other Dream of making a Navigation, or Communication between
the South Seas and the Gulph os <HI>Mexico,</HI> by the River of <HI>Darien</HI>
—; Which, if all were done, and the Distance measured to
that Part of <HI>India,</HI> to which we chiesly Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> The Coast of
<HI>Coromondel, Surrat,</HI> Bay of <HI>Bengal, &amp;c.</HI> I think any Body will de∣termine
the Voyage by the <HI>Cape de Bon Esperance,</HI> the better Passage
by much, and very little if any thing longer.</P>
<P>But to come to the Case, the Company, or rather the Projectors,
who had now embark'd the Gentlemen in a Subscription of 400000
Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> carried on their Design, and with Two Ships.</P>
<P>Men and a Cargo perfectly unqualified for any kind of Trade, ei∣ther
with <HI>English,</HI> or <HI>Spaniards,</HI> set Sail, and landing at <HI>Darien,</HI>
made a Settlement there, fortified themselves, and prepared to
maintain it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who claim a Right there, and whether that Right
be disputeable or no, is not the Question here, immediately pro∣ceed
by a double Method, first, To prepare to dislodge them by
Force, and secondly, Apply themselves to the King of <HI>England,</HI>
claiming, <HI>by virtue of the Treaty made with</HI> England, <HI>Ratified and
Exchanged,</HI> That no Succour should be given to the <HI>Scots</HI> from any
of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>This, as an express Stipulation, could not be denyed by the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Court, and accordingly a Proclamation was exhibited by the
King of <HI>England,</HI> and sent to all the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, forbidding
Trade or Correspondence with them.</P>
<P>I cannot help saying, had the Managers of the Companies Af∣fairs
had the least Forecast of Things, they could not but have
expected all that happened here; And also might have known,
That, had they Acted right, thoso Proclamations could have done
them no manner of Damage.</P>
<P>Whover has the least Knowledge of the Affairs of that Country,
and os the Trade of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, must needs know, That,
had the <HI>Scots</HI> Company, who had plac'd themselves at <HI>Darien,</HI> been
furnish'd either with Money, or Letters of Credit, they had never
wanted Provisions, or come to any other Disaster, notwithstand∣ing
the Proclamations of the <HI>English</HI> against Correspon∣dence.</P>
<P>Nor will any Man be so vain to say, That they ought to have
ventured on such a Settlement, depending on Supplies from the
<HI>English,</HI> especially when, in their Affairs of <HI>Hamburgh and London,</HI>
which were before all this, they had seen the <HI>English</HI> concerning
<PB N="36" REF="84"/>
themselves against their Company; Much less should they have
gone to Plant themselves in a Climate unsit for Product it self,
with neither Cash, nor Credit, to Buy in other Places.</P>
<P>At last 'tis apparent, That, notwithstanding the Proclamations,
and after all the Officious Care of the Governours of the <HI>English</HI>
Colonies, yet several Sloops of provisions came to them, but found
them on the other Hand unfurnish'd to purchase, except with such
Goods as were fit for no Market, nor could they give Bills any
where to make Good the Value.</P>
<P>The Trade to the <HI>Spanish West Indies</HI> is forbidden in those Parts,
under the severest Penalties of Loss of Goods, Confiscation of the
Ship, and Death of the People; And yet we see, That, at <HI>Ja∣maica</HI>
for the <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Curasoe</HI> for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they carry on a
prodigious Trade encouraged by the Gain of it.</P>
<P>Had the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Darien</HI> had any thing sufficient to encoutage
the Traders thither, they had never wanted Provisions; And as
they were unprovided that way, they must have starved, had there
been no Prohibitions at all, for they would have found few of the
Planters, or Merchants of the Colonies, inclined to have furnish'd
them without Money.</P>
<P>This I think clears up the Case sufficiently, and therefore I shall
say no more to it here; 'Tis thus far to the present Purpose, <HI>That,</HI>
This Disaster of the <HI>Scots, be the Fault where it will,</HI> was one of the
great Occasions of Ill Blood between the Nations, while those that
took all Opportunities to widen our Breaches on both Sides, con∣tinually
cryed out in <HI>England,</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> were encroaching
upon our Trade, and setting up a <HI>New East-India</HI> Trade—;
And, on the other Hand, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they complained of the Un∣natural
and Barbarous Treatment of the <HI>English</HI>—; Both
which took with the Common People of either Nations, to the Un∣speakable
Disquieting of their Minds, and raising continual Re∣proaches
against one another, without giving themselves leave to
enquire into the Grounds and Reasons of Things.</P>
<P>I have been the larger on this Head, because I think this to be
the first Handle that our Quarrelsome People took Hold of to Ob∣ject
against one another, and on which the future Jealousies between
the Nations were pretended to be built.</P>
<P>The Affair of <HI>Glenco</HI> was another Step to National Breaches; And
tho' every Body tells me, I must handle this very gently, perhaps
they may see, there is not so much Cause for it, as they imagine.</P>
<P>And having the Honour to have had something of this from
Persons very near the King, and perhaps from His Majesties own
Mouth; I shall only state the General so far as it has been report∣ed
to the Injury of that Glorious Prince, and to the exciting Natio∣nal
Animosities between us.</P>
<P>In doing this, I shall only avoid Naming of Persons, let the Guilt
dye in their Graves, we are not now calling up the Persons to
Judgment, but setting the Matter in a clear Light.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="85"/>
That the <HI>Glenco-men</HI> among several other <HI>Clans</HI> of the <HI>High∣landers,</HI>
were Enemies to the Government at that time, had been in
Arms under <HI>Dundee,</HI> and had on all occasions shown their impla∣cable
Aversion to King <HI>William,</HI> and all the Interest of the Revolu∣tion,
needs no Proof, and is own'd even by the greatest Friends to
the Cause.</P>
<P>That these People were not only very troublesome, bu <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dange∣rous,
and had committed several Hostilities, Murders, Robberies
and Depredations, on boch the Innocent Country People their Neigh∣bours,
as well as on the Garrisons of Souldiers plac'd on that side
to suppress them, is also out of dispute.</P>
<P>The Defence made for this is short, That they were fair Enomies
and had profess't open War.</P>
<P>It is Answered thus, That</P>
<P>1. They cannot be own'd as open Enomies, because they
really had no Commissions from King <HI>James.</HI> And <HI>2ly,</HI> The
War was as it were supprest; the Generality had laid down
their Arms, and submitted; and these as a few Desperado's
kept up the Quarrel rather as an advantage of Rapine and
Plunder, than a Service to their pretended Master, or his
Cause.</P>
<P>2. Suppose them at open War, It has been the known Prac∣tice
in War, when a Governour of a Garrison holds out with∣out
Expectation of Relief, without any prospect but meer Des∣peration
and Mischief, to give such no Quarter; no Conditions
at all, but even after taking the Place to hang them up in cold
Blood, as wild Beasts, that make no fair War, and deserve no
fair Treatment.</P>
<P>As His Majesty had this Account given him of these People, and
I do not find but it was a true Account too, it was the Advice of
the General and Officers imployed at that time, that it was a Mis∣chief
which as Times then went might be very dangerous to the Pub∣lick;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
that therefore it behoved them to take some immediateCourse
with them; And since desperate Mischiefs require Remedies of the
same kind, they thought the first Force the best, and proposed to
march immediately with a Body of Troops into the Place, and in∣tirely
root them out as a Den of Thieves and Destroyers, without
which the peaceable Subjects could never be sase, nor the Govern∣ment
be easie; That the Charge of maintaining Troops there, was an in∣tolerable
Burden to the Countrey, and as there was no other way
could prevail to preserve the Peace, it was absolutely necessary to
come to Extremity.</P>
<P>His Majesty, who by his Experience in Military Affairs, was soon
convinc'd both of the Justice in Point of War, &amp; Necessity in Point of
Government of this Advice; yet out of His meer Goodness of Disposition
&amp; general Clemency, answered, <HI>He agreed to tbeir Reasons,</HI> but requi∣red
that before any such Extremities should be used with them, a
Proclamation should be published, offering Pardon, or Remission for
all Violences, and Villanics past, to all these People without Excep∣tion,
who within a certain time should come in, lay down their
<PB N="38" REF="86"/>
Arms, and submit to the Government, and take the Oaths as peace∣able
Subjects.</P>
<P>'Tis here visible that His Majefties Intentions were not only Just
and Honourable to these People, <HI>tbo bis implacable Enemies,</HI> but
that he resolved like a mercisul Prince, to try all reasonable Me∣thods
of Tenderness, and Goodness, is possible, to keep the Peace,
and save the Offenders too.</P>
<P>With this Proclamation, Commission was given to the Military
Power, if this merciful Method could not prevail, they should
proceed to Extremities; and by Force of Arms destroy all those
that should stand out, and not comply with the Proclamation. And
His Majesties Orders were, as far as relates to this part, as follows.</P>
<P>The Instructions were to Sir <HI>Thomas Livingstoun,</HI> dated <HI>Jan.</HI> 11.
1692. the first Clause is thus,</P>
<P>Tou are hereby <HI>Ordered</HI> and Authorized to march our Troops
which are now posted at <HI>Innerlochic</HI> and <HI>Innerness</HI> to act against
those Highland Rebels who have not taken the benefite of Our Indem∣nity,
by Fire and Sword, and all manner of Hostilities, to burn their
Houses, seize or destroy their Goods, Cattel, Plenisbing or Clothes,
and to cut off the Men.</P>
<P>The Fourth Articleruns thus.</P>
<P>That the Rebels may not think themselves absolutely desperate, we
allow you to give Terms and Quarters, but we are so convine'd of the
Necessity of Severity, and that they cannot be reclaim'd, that we will
not allow you to give any other Terms to Chiftains, Heretors, or
Leaders, but to be Prisoners of War, where by their Lives are saved,
but for all other things they must surrender on Mercy, and take the
Oath of Alledgeance.</P>
<P>In Additional Instructions, one Clause is thus dated 16 <HI>Jan.</HI> 1692
If that <HI>Mackean</HI> of <HI>Glenco</HI> and his Tribe can be well separated from
the rest, it will be a proper Vindication of the publick Justice to ex∣tirpate
that Sect of Thieves.</P>
<P>Thus far I think I may undertake to say His Majesty proceeded,
by the known Custom of all the most just Governments in the World,
and it would be needless to Examine Histories to bring Precedents
here to justifie the Method.</P>
<P>It is certain, and all Men allow that the <HI>Glenco-men</HI> had not com∣plyed
with the Proclamation; Nay they had rejected two Indemni∣ties.</P>
<P>I know 'tis objected, that <HI>Glenco</HI> came and took the Oath six days
after the time, made a legal and just Excuse, and sent word of his
willingness to comply with it, and that it was only a Trespass of
Time, which they supposed he had repaired, that the end of the
Proclamation was answered, and that the King who was mercifully
inclin'd, would never have taken the Lives of People resolved to
submit for a Trespass of days.</P>
<P>To this I answer, as His Majesty himself did in that Case, that
indeed had he been in the Field, and on the Spot, and that Excuse
had been sent to him, he might have accepted it—; But that as
<PB N="39" REF="87"/>
Commissions in Cases of War, are to be punctually Executed, he
could not require it of the Officers to accept it, as an Excuse against
a positive Proclamation, and an express Order; Besides, I do not
find any, but the Chief had gone thus far, the rest not having come
in at all.</P>
<P>It is alledged, That the Execution was from private Malice—;
but none could ever yet have the Face to charge His Majesty with
that, and I could never hear of any Reason given why the Com∣manders
of the Forces should have any, much less those at whom
the Scandal of it was pointed, upon pretence of giving Unwar∣rantable
Orders.</P>
<P>But the Case chiefly lyes here, the Men fell under the Misfortune
of a Crisis in War, they brought themselves into it by an Omission
of Time, to say, They could not avoid it, does not reach the Case,
if the Officers can be charged with any private Revenge in this Case,
I have only this to say.</P>
<P>1. I never yet saw any Reason to think so, no Personal
Grudge or Quarrel ever appeared, that I ever met with, or was
so much as—; alledged in it, or Gain pretended to be made
by it, if the E. of B.—had any private Game, it nei∣ther
affected the King, nor the other Persons Charged with
the Thing.</P>
<P>2. If it were so, it no way affects the King, against whom
the Reproach of this Affair is since pointed, who acted no∣thing
but what was agreeable to the Laws of War, and mixt
it with that General Blessing of his Temper, an unusual Cle∣mency.</P>
<P>If the Commission given was Executed with Barbarity, and
Blood, Killing People in what we call cold Blood, surprizing them
in Peace, and Dependence on Safety, all this will turn upon the
Merits of the first Cause; For if they were by the Laws of War to
be Destroyed, all manner of Surprizes become Justisied by the same
Law; As to the Cruelties and Excesses of the Furious Soldiers, no
Man can have the Face to Reproach His Majesty with that.</P>
<P>The Grand Question remains yet behind, Why did not the King
cause the Offenders to be made Examples, and severely punish the
Murderers.</P>
<P>I shall Answer,</P>
<P>1: If His Majesties Peculiar was too much Clemency, I think
some of those that make loudest Exclamations on this Article
ought to be silent, since, had Exemplar Justice been His Ma∣jesties
Employment from his sirst Landing, we should have no
Reason to have said, It was a Bloodless Revolution, nor they
perhaps have been alive to Complain.</P>
<P>2. For the Reasons aforesaid, His Majesty often said, it was
a <HI>Moot-point</HI> in War, whether they had broke Orders or no,
and tho' I have the Honour to know, that His Majesty ex∣ceedingly
'resented the Manner, yet it did not appear at all,
that they had laid themselves open to Military Justice in it,
<PB N="40" REF="88"/>
or so much as given ground to call them to account before a
Council of War.</P>
<P>As to National or Civil Justice, the Memory of the King can
never be Reflected upon in that, unless some Persons had pursued
them at Law, obtained Sentence against them, and His Majesty
had Protected them from the Prosecution or Execution of such Sen∣tences.</P>
<P>Thus far, I think, the King himself is intirely clear of this Mat∣ter,
who else may have been Guilty, and how, either of breaking
Orders, going beyond them on Niceties, and Executing them with
Barbarities, I have no Occasion to enter upon here; I shall be far
from Desending such Things, and I am sure His Majesty was far
from Approving it.</P>
<P>But this is more compleatly Answered, by putting the World in
mind, That His Majesty did refer the Prosecution of that Affair
wholly to the Parliament, as more particularly appears by the Par∣liaments
Address of Thanks to His Majesty for so doing.</P>
<P>And that in their Prosecution, they found no room for legal Pro∣cess,
except against the Officer who Executed the Orders in a man∣ner
so Barbarous, which Officer fled from Justice, and was Pro∣scribed
for not Compearing.</P>
<P>So that here was no legal Process interrupted, but all was Frank∣ly
remitted by His Majesty to the severest Methods of Justice, which
if it would not reach the Persons concerned, 'tis very hard the
Slander should reach the King.</P>
<P>It might be said here, You have no Occasion to Defend the
King's Memory in this Case, since the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> clear'd
His Majesty, by their Unanimous Vote os <HI>14th. of June, viz.</HI> That
His Majesties Instructions contained no Warrant for the Execution
of the <HI>Glenco</HI> Men.</P>
<P>I shall only Note, That it is true the Parliament past such a Vote,
and 'tis as true, the King resented very ill their Usage of him, as
he had great Reason to do, frequently repeating, That he Thank∣ed
the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> they had used him better than <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
had done his Grandfather, for they had Tryed him for his
Life, and brought him in <HI>NOT GUILTY.</HI> I must confess, it was
very Unaccountable the House should pass such a Vote upon their
Sovereign, whom no Man had had the Impudence to owne a Re∣flection
upon in the Case, tho' they did it Clandestinely; and it
had much better have become them, to have Searched after, and
Punished those that Slandered the King on that Account.</P>
<P>But the Reproaching the King, and those imployed by him, and
who under him gave Orders in it, had its Party Uses; what End it
answered at that Time, is very well known, and would make a
very good History, to the Reproach of some Pretenders to Revolu∣tion
Principles; But I choose to bury these Things in Silence, nei∣ther
are they any part of this Design.</P>
<P>I have Assign'd this as a second Ground of National Animosity,
not that it was Acted by any of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, but as the
<PB N="41" REF="89"/>
Gentlemen who improved it, turned it all against the King, it was
still furnishing matter of Railry against the Revolution, and Suc∣cession,
which both turned upon one Point, and was now sup∣ported
and pusht on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Interest and Insluence of
the <HI>English</HI> Court.</P>
<P>I have Digrest upon the Subject on no other Ground, than to
clear up the Reproaches which Envy would fain fix on the King and
his Memory, which, I think, not at all accountable for it.</P>
<P>3. The next General Head, on which our National Discontents
have been Revived, and indeed which has been strangely Islued, has
been the Succession of the Crown.</P>
<P>This has a long Chain of Derivations to fetch it from, but I'll
Contract them into as small a Compass as I can.</P>
<P>The Original of the whole Debate is to be placed, if we will do
Justice, in His late Majesties sincere and constant Care for the Peace
and Security of these Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The King had seen the Prospects of an <HI>Union</HI> fly like a remote
Shadow, as it were out of Ken, and finding reason to lay aside the
Thoughts of that blessed Conjunction, he found the next Step needful
was, to preserve the Publick Peace, and hand down our Liberties to
posterity, under the same Security he had so happily Fixt them in;
in order to this, His Majesty began to set himsels seriously to Work,
to settle the Succession of the Crown in the Protestant Line.</P>
<P>Before I enter into this large Field, I must take one Opportunity
more to Exalt the Memory of the King, and put these Nations in
mind of the Care that Prince took, abstracted from his own In∣terest
to settle both the Liberties and Religion of this Island, in
spight of all the ill Treatment he met with here.</P>
<P>Upon the Revolution, a great deal of Clamour and Reproach had
been Level'd at the King, as is he pursued his own Interest in the
taking the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> tho' I must acknowledge I am at a Loss,
to find out what he Gain'd by it, tho' I have had Opportunities
to know something of His Majesties Affairs; But sure, no Body could
Charge His Majesty with having an Eye to his Interest, in what
should happen after his Death; He could have nothing to propose
to himself beyond the Grave; It could be of no Moment to him,
who should Enjoy the Crown after him, since he had no Children
of his own, nor could he expect the Succession should come to any
Branch of his Family.</P>
<P>Covetousness and Ambition may guide Princes in their Pursuit of
Honours and Possessions, to themselves and their Families, but
when a Prince has no Family, no Relations that can Enjoy after
him, it can not be Rational to talk of Ambition or Interest in that
Case.</P>
<P>His Majesties Memory is therefore Untainted, and even the Ene∣mies
of his Fame are Defeated <HI>here; for the very pretence fails them,</HI>
his Anxiety for the Settlement of the Succession, could savour of
nothing but a meer Concern and Respect for the Interest, Safcty,
<PB N="42" REF="90"/>
and Liberty of the Countrey, and let any Man give any other ra∣tional
Account of it, if he can; <HI>But this is by the way.</HI></P>
<P>In pursuit of this Original Design, His Majesty laid the Ground∣Plot
of the Succession to the House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> went himsels to
<HI>Hannover,</HI> and thence to <HI>Zell,</HI> to Concert the Measures of it on that
Side, Master'd some Difficulties there too, and then proposed it to
the <HI>English</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>How it passed in the <HI>English</HI> Nation, what Opposition was made
to it <HI>there, and by whom,</HI> what subsequent Laws were made to
strengthen and support it, is not much to the present Purpose to
Examine, Histories are full of the particular Circumstances, and no
Body that knows any thing of what past in those Times, can be
ignorant of it.</P>
<P>It remained only to make the same Provision for <HI>Scotland;</HI> and
the King began to turn his Eyes thither, when he was taken off
by Death; And Queen <HI>ANNE</HI> Succeeded not to his Crown only,
but to the same Care and Concern for the Publick Peace, and for
the Settlement of the Nations, by securing the Succession of the
Crown.</P>
<P>But to look into <HI>Scotland</HI> a little, the <HI>Scots</HI> receiv'd the Proposal of
the Succession, with more Coldness &amp; Diffidence than was expected;
and the Heats occasioned by the Debates on both Sides, were Ex∣traordinary;
The Opposition made to the Continuation of their
United State in a Successor, had a specious and most unanswerable
Pretence to be made for it, tho' it was made Use of by two sorts
of People, with a quite different Prospect.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> had been very sensible of the visible Decay of Trade,
Wealth, and Inhabitants in their Country, even from the first giving
away their Kings to the <HI>English</HI> Succession, and as the Sinking
Condition of their Nation, was plainly owing to the Loss of their
Court, Concourse os People, the Disadvantages of Trade, and the
Insluence the <HI>English</HI> had over their Kings; So it was as plain,
there was no way to Recover themselves, but either better Terms of
Union and Alliance, or a Returning back to their separate Sels∣Exiting
State.</P>
<P>The most Considering and Disinterested People, Reflected back
upon their Easie Complying with the <HI>English,</HI> and Joyning with the
Revolution, without any Conditions made for themselves with
<HI>England</HI> as a Nation; <HI>And plainy said,</HI> If they had demanded better
Terms, they might have had them, since their Joyning at that
Time was a Thing of such Consequence, and upon which so much
did Depend, that <HI>England</HI> could not have denied them, and what
they had to ask was so reasonable, that nothing in reason could
have been objected.</P>
<P>The People who were of this Opinion, being some of them at
the same Time, as sar srom Embarking in the wrong Interest,
Mov'd Strennously for a Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> to aseertain the Con∣ditions,
<HI>Chiesly respecting Commerce,</HI> on which they were willing to
little
<PB N="43" REF="91"/>
fettle the Crown; but were Unanimously for refusing to settle it at
all, <HI>but with sch a Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>As these Gentlemen insisted upon a Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> in case
they settled the Succested with them, To they confidered in the
next place of Limitations, both in case of failing of such Treaty,
or in case of its being Concluded, in order to preserve the Liberties
of the People, and to Assert the Right and Power of Parliaments 5
And one of these Limitations was, That in case the Treaty did not
succeed then in the settling the Crown, it was Provided, the Suc∣cessor
should not be King or Queen of <HI>England;</HI></P>
<P>And yet I confess it seems plain to me, the Design of these Peo∣ple
wasnot against having the Succession settled even in Conjuncti∣on
with <HI>England,</HI> as it now is, and their General Behaviour since,
Consirms this Opinion, besides the General Character of the Men
themslves, but their Design appeared plainly to bring <HI>England</HI> over
to sueh Terms in Matters of Commerce, as really it appeared <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
wanted, and as <HI>England</HI> ought to Grant.</P>
<P>'Tis true, a Party Joyn'd in this, that were against any Conjuncti∣on
at all, that were against any Succession but that of King <HI>James,</HI>
and whose real Design was against the General Correspondence of
the Nations, and both Sides had People among them who made
use of these Things, further and further to Divide the Nation.</P>
<P>Nor did they fail of Success for this was taken very Hainously in
<HI>England,</HI> especially by the ignorant kind of People, and they began
in <HI>England</HI> to Treat the <HI>Scots</HI> very Coursely; The Writers of the Age
began to Discuss the separate Sovereignties, and Exalt the Titles of
either Side.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> one Doctor <HI>Drake</HI> Writes a Preface to an Abridge∣ment
of the <HI>Scots</HI> History, wherein speaking something Reflecting
upon the Freedom and Independency of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Parlia∣ment
caused it to be Burnt by the Hangman at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> Another
<HI>English</HI> Author Writes of the Abslute Dominion of the <HI>English</HI>
Crown over the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but he received the just Pu∣nishment
of being little regarded; Another Writes of the Easiness of
Reducing <HI>Scotland</HI> by Arms—. Against these Mr. <HI>Anderson
Hodges,</HI> and others, Write of the Antiquity, Freedom, and Inde∣pendency
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Asserting it in the Face of the World, for
which Books the Parliament Rewarded them publickly.</P>
<P>Thus, on both Sides, the Case stood between the Nations, a Pen
and Ink War made a daily Noise in either Kingdom, and this ser∣ved
to Exasperate the People in such a manner, one against ano∣ther,
ther, that never have two Nations Run upon one another in such
a manner, and come off without Blows.</P>
<P>The Heats on both Sides being thus strangely blown up, and the
People of either Kingdom beginning to run into Excesses—, just
in this Juncture, as it the Nature and Nccessity of the Thing had
driven both Nations to it, the Queen proposcs to the respective
Parliaments, a Treaty of Union to be begun between the two King∣doms;
This was in the year 1702, the Well-Wishers to the Na∣tions
<PB N="44" REF="92"/>
Peace earnestly longed for this Union on both Sides; But I
cannot fay that they had equal Expectations of it, as Times then
went.
It was the first year of HerMajesty's Reign, and the Administrati∣on
of things being then in <HI>bands</HI> in both Kingdoms, which Her
Majesty afterward thought fit to change, there is not so much won∣der
why this Treaty came to nothing.</P>
<P>There had been Obstructions to the Design in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where
Things were yet carried with more Jealousie of the <HI>English</HI> Court
than afterwards they faw Reascn to do; This occasioned a Protest
from one fort of Gentlemen against the Queens Naming the Com∣missioners
to Treat—; But even the very Gentlemen who protest∣ed,
thought fit afterwards to come in to the Union as it was pro∣posed,
and had no small Insluence in the Success of it.</P>
<P>The Success of the Union no doubt depended upon the Choice
of the Persons appointed to Treat, and this depended very much on
the Representation of the Minislry in either Nation to the Queen.
As to the Ministry in <HI>Scotland</HI> I shallfay nothing, the Gentlemen
nominated there might perhaps have come into Measures for a Trea∣ty
well enough, most of the former Treaters being the fame as as∣terwards
finished it—; But the Design of the Minisry in <HI>England</HI>
seemed to act upon Measures not so consistent with the true Intent
and Meaning of the Treaty as could have been wisht.</P>
<P>Again the Jealousies on both sdes about Church Affairs, in re∣spect
to the Union, were the ground of such Difficulties as no Body
could surmount, and lay as a Secret Mine, with which that Party
who designed to keep the Nation divided, were sure to blow it up
at last, and theresore knew that all they did till that Point was dis∣cust
signified nothing, and that when ever they pleased to put an
end to it, they had an immediate Opportunity.</P>
<P>Without therefore entring upon such just Reslections as I might
very well be allowed to make upon the several Persons, and Parts
acting and acted in that, <HI>I bad almost said sham Treaty,</HI> I may
place the whole Miscarriages of it very justly upon <HI>this one Parti∣cular,
vig,</HI> That the Affairs of Religion were left to the absolute
Determination and Appointment of the Trcatcrs, and this might
have instructed any Body that this Treaty would come to nothing,
since it was morally. impracticable that the Nice Article of Religion,
as it particularly then stood between the two Churches, could have
been settled to the mutual Satisfaction of both Kingdoms by a Com∣mission,
in which there was not one Person deputed or named by the
Church, or instructed by them to enter upon the sveral Articles of
a Treaty on either Hand.</P>
<P>I know it has been faid, <HI>and perbaps there may have been some
Truth in it,</HI> That the Article of Religion was to have lien passivc
and dormant, and neither Side was to have concerned themselves a∣bout
it, by which some would have had it understood, that either
Side was to remain in the Condition they were then in—, and that
this was the Meaning of the world of a certain Perfon, who when
<PB N="45" REF="93"/>
he was ask't, what Care 'was taken of the Church in that Treaty,
Replyed, <HI>For GOD's Sake, let Us have no more of that Jargon.</HI></P>
<P>I confess, It's a charitable Construction of the Words, to say, The
Author only meant that Things should be left to stand as they were,
and the Treaters should have no other Concern about it,—but I
presume those People hardly consdered that then the Eitablishment
of either Church had been left intirely to the future Disposition of a
<HI>Britisb</HI> Parliament, who, whenever they were governed by a Majority
on this or that Side might haveOver-whelmed intirely the <HI>Scots</HI> Set∣tlement,
and erected Episcopacy upon them, or <HI>Vice verja</HI> with the
Church of <HI>England:</HI> And I presume neither Church would have
thought themselvessafe upon such aFoundation, I am sure, they would
not have had Reason to have thought so.</P>
<P>Such a Precarious Union Must needs have begot future Convulsi∣ons
in both Kingdoms; And <HI>if We may judge by what has happned
since,</HI> the Treaters would have met with but very Ordinary Recep∣tion
in <HI>Scotland</HI> when they came Home, and the abandoning the
Church to the Mercy of the Parliament, which was in Effect, giving
Her up to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> would certainly have Inslamed
the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>It is therefore the much kinder Reflection to fay these Gentlemen
never designed any Union at all, since to suppose the other, would be
to suggesst that they designed to give up their Native Countrey to a
Bondage in Matters Religious, which they knew was Intolerable to
their Countrey, and to lead them by the Hand to an Inevitable Breach
between the Nations.</P>
<P>For this Reason I say, that Treaty was never sincerely desgn'd;
if it was, it must reflect either upon the Understandings, or upon the
Integrity of the Persons concern'd</P>
<P>However, as I am here upon Matters of History, and collecting
together all that has been done with relation to uniting the King∣doms,
as well what was Abortive as what came to Perfection; I
think this Work cannot be compleat without giving you the
Minutes of this Treaty also, as far as it proceeded—; But because
I would not interrupt the Threed of History, I have adjourned it to
the <HI>Appendix,</HI> where you have it at large, as I received it from the hand
of a Person of Honour and undoubted Integrity, who was one of the
Commissioners to that Treaty, and wrote it down with his own
Hand. The Minutes arr marked in the <HI>Appendix</HI> (N 14.)</P>
<P>Upon the breaking up of this Treaty, three things happend to
the further widening the unhappy Breaches between the Nations,
which however they discovcred the furious Temper of a Party of
Men in both Kingdoms, ready and forward to inslame us and in∣volve
both Nations in Blood, yet their cvil Design had this happy
issue, that it brought the Nations to the <HI>Crisis</HI> which inevitably
brought on the great Treaty; it put us all into such a Condition,
that nothing but a Treaty; for a nearer Union, or a Bloody and lr∣reconcilable
Rupture could be the Consequence—. And this I
<PB N="46" REF="94"/>
take to be moving Argument, which in the Judgment of the Mi∣nistry
made the Treaty of Union absolutely necessary, and thus the
greatest Good came out of the greatest designed Evil.</P>
<P>The first of these was the Affair of Captain <HI>Green</HI> and the Ship
<HI>Worcester.</HI> About the an <HI>English</HI> Ship called the
<HI>Worcester of London, Captain Thomas Green</HI> Commander, Home∣ward-bound
from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> put into <HI>Scotland,</HI> whether by
contrary Winds, or for Convoy, or on What other occasion is not to
the purpose.</P>
<P>The <HI>African</HI> Company there having a Ship formerly feized by
the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> Company in <HI>London,</HI> as she was fitting out in the
River of <HI>Thames;</HI> And for which they had in vain solicited Resti∣tution,
they obtain of the Government a Power to Seize and Stop
this Ship by way of Reprisal.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Ship was seized on, and brough into <HI>Brunt-island,</HI>
and some time passed while the Ship lay under such Circumstances.</P>
<P>During this Time, some of the Ships Crew, whether in their
Drink, or otherwise, let fall some Words, implying that they had
been Pirating, and particularly some very suspicious Discourses, in∣timating
that there had been Blood in the Case.</P>
<P>This prompted further Enquiries, and at last a plain and particu∣lar
Information was procured, that this Captain <HI>Green</HI> with this Ship
<HI>Worcester</HI> had met with a <HI>Scots</HI> Ship commanded by one <HI>Drummond</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> had made Prize of the Ship, and
Murthered <HI>Drummond</HI> and all his Crew.</P>
<P>These suspicious and dark Speeches were so taken hold of, and
tract, that at last it came upon the Stage, and brought <HI>Green</HI> and
his Ships Crew into the Course of publick Jusice, and
after a very long Tryal, they were found guilty of <HI>Piracy, Robbe∣ry</HI>
and <HI>Murder;</HI> And particularly the Captain and five more were
condemned to Dye for it, and the Captain with two more were ac∣cordingly
executed.</P>
<P>It is not the work of this Book to relate that Story at its full
length, but I can not pass it here without a short Abridgement of the
Proceedings; Because as <HI>Scotland</HI> lyes under much Scandal on this
Account, which, as to the Methods of publick Justice, I think she
does not deserve, so the clearing up that Point, and the Relation it
has to the present Subject I am upon, I think will come out Hand
in Hand; and for that Reason I ingage in it.</P>
<P>Some of <HI>Green's</HI> Men, either in their Anger, or their Cups, or
both, having let fall Words that rendred him very much suspected
of having been guilty of great Villanies, they were further watch∣ed
in their Discourse by some that had taken hold of their Words,
particularly two Negroes, one <HI>Haines,</HI> and another, who, it seems,
being disgusted at the Captain, frequently let fall such Expressions
as gave the Hearers Reason to suspect there had been great Villanies
among them. These Speeches are all to be see in the Depositions
of the Witnesses, too long to repeat here, and particularly in the
Printed Tryal, to which I refer.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="95"/>
I shall not take upon mehere, either to Condemn or Acquit either
Side, I know the World is divided on the Subject, some will have
<HI>Green</HI> and his Crew, to be Guily of all that is Charged on them;
others say, The Company carried all against them, that they might
have a good Pretence for Consiscating the Ship. But be that as it
will, it is most certain, the Folly and Imprudence of the Men Hang∣ed
them, <HI>to say no more.</HI></P>
<P>From a little to more, from dark Expressions, they fell to down∣right
Quarrelling, and calling one another Names, which there
seems to be good reason to believe, might in part be true on both
Sides, <HI>For some of them, however innocent of this Matter, had been,
it seems, Guilty of Wickednesses of other sts, black enough.</HI></P>
<P>This Folly of theirs, came at last to such a Hight, that it could
be no longer Concealed, for it became the publick Discourse, That
they had been Guilty not of Murder and Piracy only, but of Un∣common
Barbarities, and not that only, but that it was particular∣ly
on a <HI>Scots</HI> Ship, and <HI>Scots</HI> Men, <HI>viz.</HI> Captain <HI>Drummond,</HI> as
aforesaid.</P>
<P>At length it was brought to the Ears of the Government, and as
the publick Justice of all Nations is obliged to take Cognisance of
such Horrid Things as were here suggested, the Fellows were Exa∣mined,
and they frankly Confessing, <HI>Green</HI> and five of his Men
were taken up; The positive Evidence were only two <HI>Negroes,</HI>
but others so Corroborated what they said, and Circumstances con∣curring,
to make almost every Body believe the Fact, at least in that
Hurry, they were upon a long Hearing severally found Guilty of
Piracy and Murder.</P>
<P>There are sometimes such Crisis, such Junctures in Matters,
when all Things shall concur to possess, not a Man, but even
a Nation with a Belies, of what at another Time they would
not believe, even upon the same Evidence; And, <HI>in this,</HI> Man
seems acted by a kind of supernaturarl Insluence, as if invisibly
directed, to bring to pass some particular Thing pointed out
by Providence to be done, for Reasons of his own, and
known only to his Inscrutable Wisdom.</P>
<P>Just such a Case this seemed to be; the Circumstances of <HI>Green</HI>
and his Crew, were very Unhappy for them; Their being put into
<HI>Scotland,</HI> where they had no manner of Business, no Distress to
Force them in; Their being Seized by the Company, the Mens fal∣ling
out among themselves, and being the open Instrumnts of De∣tecting,
what no one ever could ha' Charged them with, their stay∣ing
there when they might have gone, and had no more Business
there, from whence some alledge, they had no power to depart;
These, and more concurring Circumstances which were observed
by the Most curious, and some of which were Noted upon the
Trial, seem'd to Jump together so visibly, that all People seem'd
to acknowledge a wonderful and invisible Hand in it, directing
and pointing out the Detecting some Horrible Crime, which Ven∣geance
fuffered not to go Unpunished.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="96"/>
Nor was this the sense of a few, but Generally speaking of the
whole Nation, I mean of considering People, and such as usually
notice such Things, and particularly of many of those who cried
out loudest of the matter, when it was too late to apply any Re∣medy,
in which, I cannot but think, they act Unkindly to their
Country, and indeed very Unjustly, since, when the Conviction of
such circumstances was on the minds of the People, It is no wonder
the Men were found Guilty by the Jury; and I perswade my self,
they themselves would have done the same.</P>
<P>On their being found Guilty, they were not immediately Executed,
but feveral Applications were made to <HI>England</HI> for their Reprive;
the Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> Reprived them for some Days; And as
some People began then to object, That the Evidence was but too
slight, and that there was but one Witness to matter of Fact, and
that the one Witness was but a <HI>Negroe,</HI> That he was not capable of the
Imprestions of the Solemnity of an Oath, That there was Malice in
it, and the like; On these, and other Considertions, the Govern∣ment
was so Tender of the Blood of the Men, that some have
thought they had not Died, but for the Rage of the Common
People, who hearing that they were further to be Reprived, got
together in an unusual Multitude, on the Day appointed for their
Execution, crying out for Justice.</P>
<P>And this part of the Story, is the Occasion of my relating much
of it, since the Tendency it had to Inflame the Nations one against
another, bagan here.</P>
<P>On the Day appointed for Execution, the Privy Council was Set,
and the Magistraies of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were called to Assist—, where
the Point was Debated, Wherher the Condemned Persons sould be
Executed, or no; I will not say the Rabble influenc'd the Council
in their Determinations that way—; But this is certain, That
the Discontent of the Common People was very well known, and
that they were Furiously bent upon some Violent Methods, was
very much feared—; That a vast Concourse of People was ga∣thered
at that Instant in the Parliament Closs, at the Cross, at the
Prison, and throughout the whole City, that they publickly Threat∣ned
the Magistrates, and even the Council it self, in case they
were not brought out that Day, and some talked of pulling down
the Tolbooth, which if they had Attempted, they would have Sa∣crisied
them in a way more like that of <HI>De Wit,</HI> than an Executi∣on
of Justice.</P>
<P>However, it was the Council Determined the matter. that Three
of them, <HI>viz.</HI> The Captain <HI>Thomas Green, John Mather, and James
Simpson,</HI> who were thought to be Principals in the Murder, should
be put to Death that Day.</P>
<P>When the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> came out, they astured the
People, That they were Ordered to be Executed, and that if they
would have a little patience, they would see them brought out;
and this pacisied them for the presciu.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="97"/>
Soon after the Council breaking up, My Lord Chancellor came
out, and driving down the Street in his Coach, as he past by the
Cross, some Body said aloud, <HI>The Magistrates had but cheated them,
and that the Council bad repriv'd the Criminals—;</HI> This run∣ning
like Wild-fire was spread in a Moment among the People;
immediately they ran in a Fury down the Street after the Chancellor,
stopt his Coach just at the <HI>Trone-Church,</HI> broke the Glasles, abused
his Servants, and forc't him out of the Coach; some Friends that
were concerned for the Hazard he was in, got him into a House, so
that he had no personal Hurt: 'twas in Vain for his Lordship to
protest to them that the Men were ordered to be executed, they were
then past Hearing of any Thing, the whole Town was in an Up∣roar,
and not the Mob of the City, but even from all the Adjacent
Countrey was come together, Nothing, but the Blood of the Prison∣ers
could appease them: and had not the Execution followed imme∣diately,
it cannot be express'd, what Mischief <HI>might</HI> have hap∣pened.</P>
<P>At last the Prisoners were brought out, and led through the
Streets down to <HI>Leith,</HI> the Place of Execution, being by the Laws
appointed there for Crimes committed upon the Sea—; The
Fury and Rage of the People was such, that it is not to be exprest,
and hardly did they suffer them to pass, or keep their Hands off
from them as they went, but throw a thousand Insults, Taunts and
Revilings; they were at last brought to the Gibbet erected at the
Sea-Mark, and there hang'd.</P>
<P>Nor can I forget to Note, that no sooner was the Sacrifice made,
and the Men dead, but even the same Rabble, so fickle is the Multi∣tude,
exclaim'd at their own Madness, and openly regrated what they
had done, and were ready to tear one another to pieces for the
Excess.</P>
<P>This was not acted there with more Fury, than it was with the
outinost Indignation resented in <HI>England</HI>—, still I am to be un∣derstood
of the common People; For the Government of neither
Side had any Resentment or Dispute, all things having been carried
on by legal Methods, Process and Tryal, according to the Form of
Law and Usage of the Country.</P>
<P>But here was new Matter for the Enomies of both Nations to work
upon, and too much Fewel was thrown into the Fire of National
Contention on both Sides.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scotland</HI> it was said the Court of <HI>England</HI> would protect
them, and they would be pardon'd, <HI>only because they were Scots∣Men
that were murdered;</HI> And the like.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> it was said, the Rabble had cry'd out to hang them, be∣cause
they were <HI>English-men,</HI> that they had said they wisht they
could hang the whole Nation so, and that they insulted them as
they went to Execution with the Name of <HI>English</HI> Dogs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Never was such an unfortunate Circumstance to exasperate the
common People on both, Sides, and to fill them with irreconcile∣able
<PB N="50" REF="98"/>
Aversions that might prepare them for Blood, and if in <HI>England</HI>
it had gone a little higher, it would not have been safe for a <HI>Scots</HI>
Man to have walk't the Street.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that tho the Men had been innocent, <HI>for that was
now alleded,</HI> yet as they were condemned by a due Course of Law,
Tryed and Executed by the common Form of Justice in that Coun∣try,
and in the same manner by which their own Subjects were
tryed and executed, the Fault mustly in the Witnestes and the
Jury that believe'd them; But there could be no pretence to make
it a National Quarrel at all.</P>
<P>That in <HI>England</HI> it had been but too frequent to Try and Con∣demn
innocent Men, and that if Evidences swore the Fact, it might
be the Misfortune of any innocent Man to fall under such a Disast∣er,
the Crime lay in the Villany and Perjury of Witnesses, but the
Nation could not be quarrelled on that Account.</P>
<P>But stll these Things lest a Corroded Mass of ill Blood in the
Minds of the People on either Side, &amp; as Improved by the Malitious
Fomenters of our Divisions, they were very Unhappy at that Time.</P>
<P>To Exasperate the People yet more, it was reported, That Cap∣tain
<HI>Drummond</HI> was yet Living, that neither he, nor any of his
Men was ever Touch't by <HI>Green</HI> or his Crew, and some Seamen
who Landed in <HI>England,</HI> made <HI>Affidavit</HI> directly contrary to the
Evidence that Hang'd them.</P>
<P>I shall no further enter into the Merits of the Case, than serves
to the matter of National Heats—; The Thing was Generally,
thought to be a hasty Execution, but the Argument, That it ought
to be no Ground of a National Quarrel, prevailed in <HI>England,</HI>
and the rest of the Prisoners in <HI>Scotland</HI> were Reprived from Time
to Time, and at last let go.</P>
<P>In both, these Cases, the Mischiefs of Tumult and Rabbles is to
be observed, and how easie it is to set Nations on a slame, by the
Violent Fomenting the Passions and Humours of the People, and
how much those fort of Men are to be Detested, who blow the
Coals of Strife and Dissention in a Nation, prompt the Fury of an
Enraged Multitude to Fly in one anothers Faces, and Insult the Laws
and Governments of both Countrys at once.</P>
<P>The End of this Account, is to make out what I at sirst Noted.
concerning the Causes which wrought these two Nations up to
such a Necessity of a Union, that either it must have been a Union
or a War, the Animosities on both Sides being raised to such a
pitch, that they could no longer have remained in the usual <HI>Me.
dium</HI> of Peace—; Nor was this Unhappy Story, the Jcast cause
of the growing Aversion between us, which was now come to a
very great Hight.</P>
<P>The second Head, to which I ascribe the growing Alienation be∣tween
these two Kingdoms, was the Act of Security in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Act made a great Noise in the World, and was magnisied in
<HI>Engalnd,</HI> to such a Hight, that it was look'd upon as in effect a
Declaration of War, to Commence at the Queen's Demise, and
<PB N="51" REF="99"/>
designed, was effectually made so, by what after hap∣pened.</P>
<P>The Marquiss of <HI>Tweeddale</HI> was High Commissioner to this Par∣liament,
a Person of Extraordinary Temper, Candor and Mo∣desty
—; The matter of the Succession had in the preceeding
Parliament been rejected, on this Suppositon, That it was not Pru∣dent
for <HI>Scotland</HI> to Joyn with <HI>England,</HI> except such Conditions of
Commerce and Navigation were sirst obtained by Treaty with
<HI>England,</HI> as were Just and Honourable for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and abundance
of Honest Gentlemen, who were far enough from so much as being
fuspected of Favouring the Jacobite Interest, joyned together in
this Demand; They were willing to come into the Succession, pro∣vided
they had such and such Conditions, as they thought were
reasonable to be insisted on in behals of <HI>Scotland,</HI> among which the
Liberty and Freedom of Trade to the <HI>English</HI> Plantations was
one—.</P>
<P>There were many very Learned Debates in the prcceeding Par∣liament
upon this Head; Great and Popular Specches made on the
Subject—, and the Act of Security was offered, and Voted, but could
not then be past, for Things began to run high in the Parliament,
which occasioned a Recess.</P>
<P>This was taken in <HI>England</HI> in a most Hainous manner, and no∣thing
was now talked of there, but the <HI>Scots</HI> Buying Arms and Am∣munition,
Training and Exercising their Men. and Mighty Things
were suggested in <HI>England,</HI> which the <HI>Scots might do,</HI> and some∣times
which they <HI>would do;</HI> The Printed News Papers gave a most
Formidable Journal of the Duke of <HI>Athole</HI> drawing out his High∣landers,
Encamping three Days with Seven Thousand Men, how
Armed, how well Officer'd, and the like; Another Paper told the
World of Sixty Thousand Men in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Arm'd and Train'd,
and ready to take the Field.</P>
<P>However absurd these Things were, and that Wiser Men who
knew the State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> saw there was nothing in it, but what
every Nation in the World would have done in the like case, that
it was neither more nor less than Arming their Militia, and put∣ting
them into some Order, which, for several years past had been
intirely neglected, yet I say, However absurd the Suggestions were,
they were Improved in <HI>England</HI> to all manner of Extremes, and some
most ridiculous Excesses were run into, both publick and private.</P>
<P>It is, no doubt, but as <HI>Scotland</HI> was acknowledged to be Inde∣pendent,
whatever the forward Pens of our Politicians would have
pretended, yet I say, being acknowledged Independent even by
the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, it was a very material Thing to have Her
Concur in Esablishing the Succesion of the Crown, on the same
person, as <HI>England</HI> had done.</P>
<P>Two Things mov'd in this Assair on the <HI>English</HI> Side.</P>
<P>1. Some would not have it done at all, and theresore were
for Irritating the <HI>English</HI> against the <HI>Scots,</HI> that it might come
to a Rupture in stead of a Settlement, and this by putting it
<PB N="52" REF="100"/>
upon <HI>Scotland</HI> to Declare, without a previous Treaty, which
they knew would never be accepted.</P>
<P>2. Others would gladly have had the <HI>Scots</HI> come into the suc∣cestion,
but were willing to have them do it without any Con∣ditions,
thinking that <HI>Scotland</HI> ought still be kept Low, for
fear of their Principles, which lead them to be no Friends to
the <HI>English</HI> Church Establisment.</P>
<P>Both these cried out, and Exclaim'd at this Act of Security, and
represented it to the World, as if the <HI>Scots</HI> were going actually to
separate from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There was one Clause in the Act of Security, which intirely Ex∣cluded
the Succestor to the Crown from Governing both Kingdoms
together.</P>
<P>This the Enemies of <HI>Scotland</HI> presently Represented in <HI>England.</HI>
as a Design to Restore King <HI>James,</HI> and a great many Honest People
were brought in to believe, that the <HI>Scots</HI> even the Presbterians
themselves, were so aliented from <HI>England,</HI> and so obstinately
bent against joyning with her on any account, that they would ne∣ver
again be under the same Head, nay that they would rather
League themselves with <HI>France,</HI> and restore King <HI>James,</HI> than come
to any Terms with her. And this was as it were confirmed when
the <HI>Scots</HI> subsequent to these things passed an Act for Trading with
<HI>France,</HI> tho's as their Circumstances then stood, it was very
necessary to them.</P>
<P>Nor was this run to any thing lest in <HI>England,</HI> and they began
to talk loudly there of <HI>Forcing the</HI> Scots to <HI>the Succession;</HI> But this
was by such as either coveted a Breach between the two Nations u∣pon
any Terms, or really did not understand what they said. The latter
appeared by their printing some Pieces to prove the Right of the
House of <HI>Hannover</HI> to the Crown by Succession, a Thing all People
that kno' any thing of the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> kno' it was the Foun∣dation
upon which the present Establishmt pretends to be built
—, But on that much saser, and much more Divine Right of, the
<HI>English</HI> Constiution, and <HI>Scots,</HI> also, I mean Parliamentary Limita∣tion.</P>
<P>Things ran very high now in both Nations, the Measures ta∣ken
in <HI>Scotland</HI> seem'd to be very well grounded, and their Aim
well taken, for either <HI>England</HI> must comply with <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to
such Treaties as were reasonable, or else might have the Satisf∣action
to see clearly <HI>Scotland</HI> by this Act was plac't in an intire
separate State from her, who she wou'd joyn with, what Prince she
wou'd bring in, where she would bestow her Crown, was not to the
purpose; Two Things she had made plain.</P>
<P>1. That she was resolved to have it wholly in her own
Hands, to bestow as she thought fit.</P>
<P>2. That wherever the <HI>English</HI> Crown was bestowed, the <HI>Scots</HI>
Crown should not without Conditions be obtain'd.</P>
<P>This effectually Settled and Declar'd the Independency of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="101"/>
and put her into a Posture fit to be treated with, either by
<HI>England,</HI> or by any other Nation.</P>
<P>Nor did the Apprehensions which this gave the World of the
<HI>Scots</HI> designing to restore King <HI>James</HI> do her any Disservice, for tho'
nothing is more certain than that the <HI>Jacobites as they are called,</HI>
conceived great Hopes from these Things, and flattered themselves
exceedingly, that the Return of their King, <HI>as they called him,</HI>
would be the Effect of all these Breaches; And therefore fell in
heartily with all these Things, and <HI>as far as possible</HI> carried on the A∣version
to a Settlement with <HI>England,</HI> Yet it is as certain, that the
Gentlemen who mainly carried on this Project, had no more Eye
that way than to the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> but were sincerely bent to the
Prosperity of their Country, and the Establishment both Religious
and Civil, as fully appeared afterwards by their heartily pursuing the
Treaty that followed.</P>
<P>The Drift of the whole Matter was, the bringing <HI>England</HI> to
Terms, bringing the <HI>English</HI> Nation to a Treaty, and tho' it is co∣fest
that the Prospect was Remote and Melancholly, <HI>England</HI> at the
time being averse to any such thing; yet as these Gentlemen saw
there was no other way to redeem <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Discourage∣ment
she then lay under, with respect to the Absence of her Court,
the Dependance of her Gentry and Nobility, the Limitations and
Restrictions of Trade, which by the Act of Navigation she was fet∣tered
with, and several Disadvantages her present Conjunction, <HI>which
was made without any Treaty</HI> laid her under—, d therefore they
stood strictly and resolutely to their Measures, and the more the
Court in <HI>England</HI> pusht at her joyning in the Settlement, and used
all possible means to bring it to pass, the more averse they appeared,
and the farther they went off from it.</P>
<P>Thus I say this Act of Security being only attempted in the first
Session of Parliament, was perfected in the next, and every day fur∣ther
and further Advances were made seemingly to an entire and
lasting Separation of the Kingdoms from one another.</P>
<P>There were other Steps made to this on both Sides as to Matters
of Trade, as shall appear immediately.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> who was all this while under a very unhappy Conduct, and
acted upon quite different Foundations, from what we have seen her
happily brought over to since, took the worst Measures upon the <HI>Scots</HI>
Proceedings then, that ever a wise People could have taken; For
the <HI>English</HI> Parliament sitting soon after, <HI>viz.</HI> 1704. the <HI>Scots</HI> Act
of Security came to be considered, and however influenc't by a pre∣cipitant
Party, <HI>God only knows,</HI> they past an Act in my Opinion the
most Impolitick, I had almost said unjust, that ever past that
great Assembly.</P>
<P>This was that Act of Parliament, Intituled, <HI>An Act to prevent the
Mischiefs arising to</HI> England <HI>from the Act of Security in</HI> Scotland. In
which they in a manner declar'd open War with <HI>Scotland,</HI> unless by
the 24th of <HI>Decemb.</HI> the next year they should settle the Crown in the
<PB N="54" REF="102"/>
same Person as now settled in <HI>England—;</HI> For they appointed
24 Men of War to be fitted out, to prevent the, <HI>Scots</HI> Trading with
<HI>France,</HI> declared the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>England</HI> Aliens, and several other Ar∣ticles,
as in the Act it self may more at large appear.</P>
<P>This was done in that famous Parliament, called, <HI>The Tacking
Parliament,</HI> and it was the less to be wondred at, Because, <HI>which is
the Subject I am at present upon,</HI> the Heats between the Nations,
which were at this time improv'd by the Parties on both Sides, were
risen to very great Hight, all things tended to Exasperations and
Provocations, no Man of Temper seemed to show himself on either
Hand, and those who bore the least Regard to the general Good of
both Kingdoms, foresaw nothing but an unavoidable War between
us; And indeed had Matters stood thus but a very little longer, it
had been impossible to have avoided it, and that in a most unscason∣able
time for <HI>Europe,</HI> which was then engaged in the most furious
and most critical Juncture of the War with <HI>France,</HI> being the year
before the Battle at <HI>Blenheim.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> who had laid their Scheme, in hopes
that <HI>England</HI> would have come into Measures for the general Good,
saw themselves disappointed; and tho' its true, that had <HI>England</HI>
then seen with the Eyes of her National Understanding, and had she
not been ridden by a Party who openly pursued the Ruine of her ve∣ry
Constitution, I mean as establish't on the Revolution Principle, I
say, had she not been under that unhappy Influence, she had taken
other Measures, yet as it was, nothing was to be expected.</P>
<P>However, the Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland</HI> happily resolved to wait for
the Issue of Things, and firmly adhered to their new Scheme; <HI>Scotland</HI>
began to be talk't up in the World a little, and these very Enemies
who, <HI>as they thought,</HI> wounded her by talking up the mighty
formidable Things this Act of Security might produce, really rais∣ed
her Reputation; nothing was more absurd, than their allarming
<HI>England</HI> at the <HI>Chimeras</HI> of their own Heads, such as <HI>Scotlands</HI> buying
30000 stand of Arms in <HI>Holland,</HI> laying in 10000 Barrels of Pow∣der,
arming 60000 Men, and the like, all which in Reality was no∣thing
at all but mustering their Train'd-bands, <HI>as they call them in</HI>
England, and buying about 500 Barrels of Powder for the Castle of
<HI>Edinburgh.</HI> In their allarming <HI>England</HI> I say, at these mighty things,
they really raised the Reputation of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the World, and
made her begin to make a different Figure in the Eyes of other Nati∣ons,
and there is no doubt had things gone on to a Rupture, as wic∣ked
Men on both Sides wished, and good Men began to fear, <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
might have found some powerful Princes willing to have accep∣ted
her Crown, and to have in the mean time Supported, Supplyed
and Encourag'd her to stand upon her own Feet.</P>
<P>But I'll do the Gentlemen who Managed this Affair, this Justice,
that I believe they had it not at all in their Design, to fly to the
Protection of any Foreign Power, no not to any Protestant Power
<PB N="55" REF="103"/>
in <HI>Europe,</HI> unless Forc'd to it by the precipitant Measures <HI>England</HI>
was then in all probability going into; and if they had done it
then, I can not see how they could have been blam'd—. But as
to the present State of Things, the Gentlemen who Managed this
Part, seem'd to me, always to aim at obliging <HI>England</HI> to give
them good Terms, and to put themselves in such a Posture in the
World, as should make <HI>England</HI> see, it was worth their while to do
so, as well as that they ought to do so; And this was so just a Step,
and the Aim so well taken, as by the Consequence appeared, that
I think, 'tis the greatest Panegyrick that can be made on those
Gentlemen, to say, They brought to pass by it, all the great Things
which GOD in his Providence has thought fit to do towards our
Peace and Happiness in this Island.</P>
<P>If they did not design this, or had not this Honest Aim in View,
they less deserve the Praise; but it is evident, Providence made
their Measures Instrumental to bring it to pass.</P>
<P>Thus stood the Affairs of this Island, at the End of the Year 1705,
when the Aversions between the two Kingdoms, by the several
Steps I have noticed, was come to a great Hight, the People seem'd Ex∣asperated
against one another to the highest Degree, the Governments
seem'd bent to act Counter to one another in all their Councils;
Trade Clash't between them in all its Circumstances, and every Par∣liament
run further and further into the most disobliging Things
that could be: <HI>England</HI> laid a new Impost upon <HI>Scots</HI> Cloth; <HI>Scotland</HI>
Prohibited all the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Manufacture in General, and
Erected Manufacturies among themselves, which, had they been
prudently Managed too, might have been very Advantageous to
them; But, <HI>of that by the way. Scotland</HI> freely and openly Ex∣ported
their Wool to <HI>France, Germany</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> to the irre∣parable
Loss of the <HI>English</HI> Manufactures, having great Quantities
of <HI>English</HI> Wool brought into <HI>Scotland</HI> over the Borders, which, it
was impossible for <HI>England</HI> to prevent; So that the Famous Trade
for Wool to <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Rumney Marsh, commonly called Owling,</HI> was
intirely Dropt, and <HI>France</HI> not Supplyed only, but Glutted with
Wool.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>England</HI> was proceeding to Prohibite the
Importation of <HI>Scots</HI> Cattel, and to interrupt by Force their Trade
with <HI>France,</HI> and had this last proceeded to Practice, all the
World could not have prevented a War between both Nations.</P>
<P>But more prudent Counsels prevailed, and GOD's Providence
Unravelled all these Schemes of Destruction, which mad Men had
drawn for the Ruine of their Native Country; And as many times
Things evil in their Design, are Over-ruled by an Invisible Hand,
and bring to pass that very Good, which they were prepar'd to De∣stroy;
Even so it was here, for these Confusions were the very
Things that brought both the Nations to their Senses, I mean,
brought them both to better Temper—; The consequences of a
Bloody War just breaking out in the Bowels of their Native Coun∣trey,
in the Ruine and certain Desolation of which they must ne∣cessarily
<PB N="56" REF="104"/>
have a great Share, opened the Eyes of the most thinking
People on both Sides, even of those who in themselves had no real
inclination to the Conjunction of the Kingdoms, and thus the Ne∣cessity
of taking new Measures began to appear both ways.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> the Weight of the present War which every Day
rather Increased than Decreased; In <HI>Scotland,</HI> their declining Con∣dition
and Disunited Circumstances; in <HI>England,</HI> the matter of Se∣curity
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the prospect of Advantage, all concurred to sway
the Inclination of Wise-men to heal these Breaches.</P>
<P>I have now shown by what Steps these two Nations were
brought to the very Brink of mutual Destruction, and the Sequel of
the Story will tell any body, who were the Parties that prompted
both Nations to these Unhappy Extremes. I shall in the next place
a little Examine how all this Tide of Mischief and Folly turned,
and how they began to come to themselves in both Kingdoms, and
this will so naturally lead us to the History of the Union, that I
can not think of a more proper Introduction.</P>
<P>The Party in <HI>England</HI> who had the Reins of the Administrtion
in their Hands, had given other Testimonies than this of their
precipitant Measures, and as they had made not this Nation only
Uneasie, but their own too, so as Things Generally take new
Turns, when they come to Extremes, the <HI>English</HI> Nation began to
be Allarm'd at the Proceedings, as tending to the subversion of all
the Fabrick of Government erected by the Revolution.</P>
<P>The occasion of all this, is too long to relate here, and the History
of the Tacking the Occasional-Bill to the Money-Bill in that Par∣liament
in <HI>England,</HI> is too well known, to need any Recital.
It is enough to say here. That pushing at such Hot Measures in
<HI>England,</HI> as is usual in all Precipitations, like an Ax struck upon a
hard Stone, the Blow rebounded, and the Weapon flew out of the
Hand of the Unskilful Workman—; the Project fail'd, the
Party Overthrew themselves, and never Recover'd.</P>
<P>The Queen, far from approving the Extravagancies they were
running, Things to, and awakned by the Danger of her Peoples Li∣berties,
which were as dear to her self as to them, finding to what
Mischiefs these Warm Gentlemen were leading her, and being by
the goodness of her Disposition, as well as Experience in the <HI>English</HI>
Affairs, particularly Averse to Things Hard or Severe upon her
People, much more so to all manner of illegal Severities—, put
a full stop to this Career of Mischief—. And tho' indeed they
had brought Things to the very Edge of Destruction both in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
on their own Business, as well as in the Affairs of the two
Kingdoms, yet the Queen immediately shifting Hands, and Ap∣plying
with her usual Wisdom, to the Establishing the Minds of
her People, Retriv'd his whole Affair, restor'd <HI>England</HI> to the
Tranquillity so much desired, filled up her Ministry, and all Offices
of Trust, with Men of the same Candor and Moderation with her
self, openly Abandoned and Discouraged the Measures of those
People, who had run Things to such Excesses, and Re-settled the
<PB N="57" REF="105"/>
Minds of her People, Distracted with Apprehensions of Ruine and
Party-Confusion.</P>
<P>Thus the Ministry in <HI>England</HI> was intirely Changed, the Lord
Keeper, Sir <HI>Nathan Wright</HI> Deposed, Sir <HI>Edward Seymour</HI> Compt∣roller
of the Houshold put out of Her Family, the Earl of <HI>Not∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hame</HI>
Secretary of State, and several others laid aside; the Props
of the High-flying Party, <HI>as they were called,</HI> were left out of the
Council, and removed from their Places in the Government.</P>
<P>In the several Countries, the Peoples Approbation of Her Majesties
Proceedings, and their Joy at this Change of Instruments, was testi∣fied
by the Universal Contempt put upon the Affair of the Tacking,
and of the Occasional-Bill, as well as of all Hot Men and Hot-Measures;
and this testified by the Change in their Elections of
Parliament men, a new Parliament being then to be Chosen, in
which so General an Aversion to the Occasional Bill, or any thing
Invading the Toleration, and particularly to the Affair of the
Tack appeared, that in spight of all Oppositions a great number of
the Tacking Members were thrown out, and such a Change of Men
appeared in the next Parliament, that whereas in the other Parlia∣ment,
the High-Party had a Majority of Sixty Two or there about,
for every Thing they joyn'd in; On the first Tryal of the Strength
of the House, which was perhaps the Greatest that has been known
of late Years, it appear'd the Whig-Party had the Majority by
above Seventy Voices, and these by the turning out severals on the
Trials of Elections, and other Circumstances, rose up to be above a
Hundred, tho' after they seem'd to lose some Ground again, but it
did not last.</P>
<P>Things being thus happily turned in <HI>England,</HI> and the first Step
for the Establishing and Settling this new Party in their Seats of
Management taken, it was wonderful to see the Change it made in
all the Affairs of the Nation, how every Thing succeeded, unheard
of Victories Abroad, unusual Chearfulness at Home, and a new
Face of Prosperity seem'd to Guid the Affairs of the Nation, the
Feuds of Parties died in every place; Peace, Union, and Temper
began to be the Companion of every Society, and the Ancient
Animosities between Neighbour and Neighbour, between Friend
and Friend, which formerly crept, <HI>not into Society only,</HI> but even
into our Families, and our very Beds, declined a pace; The
Queen Encouraged Peace and Love, and Unity among her People,
and pressed the Nation to it upon all Occasions, and all Good Men
began to Encourage it by their Examples.</P>
<P>In this General Felicity of Affairs in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> came
into Remembrance; Her Majesty as having an equal Regard to the
Good of all Her Subjects, and as being justly Concerned, not for the
Change of the Temper and Condition of Her People only, but for
the Continuance of it to them in Ages to come, could not but be
Solicitous for the removing the Obstructions which lay in the way
on either Side.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="106"/>
When the Wisest Heads in both Nations had been Consulted
with on this Article, tho' Opinions differ'd, yet no <HI>Medium</HI> could
ever be found so Effectual to secure this Peace, and remove all
possibility of a Fracture, like renewing the Treaty of Union.</P>
<P>And thus I am brought down to the General Article of the Trea∣ty,
by the meer Threed of the Story, the Feuds of Parties, the
Folly of Statesmen, the Fury of Rabbles, and the General Revi∣ving
of the old Animosities between the People, had been Screwed
up to a dangerous Hight, as is Noted already, by that very Party,
who had on all Occasions, shown themselves Enemies to the present
Establishment, and future Peace even of both Nations, and by this
Method, they thought they had rendred the Succession to both
Crowns Impracticable for the House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and secured an
inevitable Rupture between the Nations, when ever it should please
GOD to Remove Her Majesty out of this World.</P>
<P>But great are the Wonders of Inscrutable Providence, these very
Schemes contrived in the Deeps of Infernal Malice, Brooded on
by that Party who ever Envied the Liberty of Protestants, and the
Tranquility as well as Privileges Enjoy'd by the People of this
whole Island, and Hatch'd by the warm Influence of a reigning
Party, by which they Flattered themselves. They had effectually
Overthrown the Project of a Union of the Kingdoms, made their
Coalition Impossible, and all Schemes projected for it Impracti∣cable;
I say, these very Things made way for that same Union,
they were Calculated to Destroy.</P>
<P>The Hight those Measures I have been speaking of, was brought
to, made, as it were, a Force upon both Nations to come to this
Treaty.</P>
<P>It was now but a few Months to come, when the Nations must di∣rectly
fall out, <HI>English</HI> Men of War must be fitted out to cruise upon
the <HI>Scots,</HI> and we that consented, or at least did not scruple to have
the <HI>Dutch</HI> carry on a free Trade with <HI>France,</HI> must go &amp; fight with our
own Brethren for it—; Whereas, had we been in our Trading Sen∣ses,
we would have done it our selves.</P>
<P>The Crisis things were come to now, was such, that they could
no longer stand at a Stay, but we must fall out with the <HI>Scots,</HI> or
unite with them, all Methods to bring them to settle the Succession
without a Treaty had been in vain used by the Party before, who
would gladly have Tricked them into it, but the <HI>Scots</HI> were too wise
to fall into that Snare.</P>
<P>The present Ministry were for fairer Dealings with them at the
same time, wisely concluding, that to gain of the <HI>Scots</HI> what they
ought to grant, it was reasonable to grant to the <HI>Scots</HI> what they
ought to have—, and that a Treaty with them might be made ef∣fectual,
the only way was to set about it, upon an honest
Foot, and then pursue it sincerely, and not upon Sharping and
Tricking on either Side as before.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="107"/>
But there yet seemed to ly one invincible Obstruction in the way of
this Treaty, and that was the Act of Parliament passed in <HI>England</HI>
the last Session, which, as before noted, had declared a kind of War
against the <HI>Scots,</HI> in case they did nor come into the Succession by
such a Day; And upon the first Motion to a Treaty, the <HI>Scots</HI> de∣clared
they could not enter into any Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> till that
Act was Repealed.</P>
<P>This had indeed a great deal of Reason in it, and such as could
not be withstood, for the Honour of the <HI>Scots</HI> seemed very much
impaired in that Act, and that they could not come to a Treaty u∣pon
equal Terms while such a Law stood in force upon them, which
seem'd as if it had been a Sword over their Heads drawn to awe
them into a Treaty.</P>
<P>The Queen, who was resolved if possible to bring this great Event
to pass, and who strove to do it so, as might give all Her Subjects
Satisfaction, undertook to clear up this Difficulty, and at the next
Parliament which met in <HI>England, Octob.</HI> 23. 1706, in Her Speech
to both Houses, Recommended the taking away of this Obstruction,
by Repealing that Act, in order to introduce a Treaty of Union,
which Her Majesty saw now more clearly in view than ever be∣fore.</P>
<P>I know there were strong Struggles in <HI>England</HI> against Repealing
this Act, and that chiefly without Doors, the Party foreseeing, that
if this Step was taken in Parliament, the Union which they really
dreaded would of course come upon the Stage, to this end it was re∣presented
as Dishonourable to make such an Advance to the <HI>Scots:</HI>
That it was an Insulting of <HI>England</HI> to have the <HI>Scots</HI> say, they
would not Treat with her till such and such Conditions were per∣formed—;
That this was letting the <HI>Scots</HI> prescribe Prelimi∣naries
upon <HI>England,</HI> and if <HI>England</HI> complyed, it would make them
more Encroaching.</P>
<P>But the Temper in the Parliament was quite different from this,
it was plain there that the <HI>Scots</HI> were in the Right to ask this as a
Preliminary, that the Treaty would for ever be subject to this Ob∣jection,
that it was not free, but done under the Terror or Force
of that Act of Parliament, that as it was not Honourable for the
<HI>Scots</HI> to have a Treaty forced upon them under such Circumstances;
So neither was it Honourable for <HI>England</HI> to force a Treaty upon
them, that the Act was unreasonable in its own Nature, that <HI>En∣gland</HI>
could have no pretence but meer Violence to intermeddle
with the <HI>Scots</HI> Commerce, who were a free Nation, and ought to
be at Liberty to Trade with any Nation that they thought fit to
Trade with, that their Trade with <HI>France</HI> was done by their own
Act of Parliament passed by the Queen, and was not inconsistent
with, or contraveening any Treaty or Contract with <HI>England,</HI>
that <HI>Scotland</HI> was under no Treaty or Commerce, or under no Ob∣ligation
to Trade, or not to Trade as <HI>England</HI> did; That as to the
Confederacy, and the War in which they were embark't with <HI>Eng∣glland,</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="108"/>
that laid them under no Obligation, since the <HI>Dutch</HI> were in
the same Confederacy, and yet openly proclaimed a free Trade with
<HI>France;</HI> Nor did the <HI>English</HI> pretend to obstruct them in it; That
<HI>Scotland</HI> was as Independent of the <HI>English</HI> Government as the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and ought to be at liberty to Trade unmolested as well as
they.</P>
<P>These Arguments back't with an Administration of Government
now quite recovered from the Tyrannical Principles of those former∣ly
in Power, soon influenc't the Parliament to Repeal the Act, and
take this Step by way of advance to the Scots, by which they let
the <HI>Scots</HI> see they were in the hands of their Friends, that now they
might expect fair Dealings, and had Room to Treat with Freedom
and Honour.</P>
<P>This was a great Mortification to those Gentlemen who had pro∣moted
that Act, who now together with their whole Party, set them∣selves
with all their Artifice to oppose the Treaty in all its Parts in
both Kingdoms; to raise Scruples, imprint Jealousies, Misrepresent
Persons and Things, embroil Councils, raise Scandals, and in short
to do every manner of thing they could to embarrass and obstruct the
Treaty: And in the first place to prejudice the Minds of the com∣mon
People against the Union as such. What fatal Success they had,
how they carryed it on, even beyond the Conclusion of the Treaty,
with what Difficulties it was encountred, how begun, how carried
on, how finished, and how since assaulted, and with difficulty enough
preserved, will be the Subject of the ensuing Sheets.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Last TREATY,
PROPERLY CALLED
THE UNION;
And, first, Of the Treaty in London.</HEAD>
<P>I Am now come to the Great and Capital Treaty, which has at
last, by the Blessing of GOD, been brought to a Happy Con∣clusion.—</P>
<P>I am not Insensible, That, in the strange Variety of Circumstan∣ces,
Changes of Prospects, the Turns of Management, the Acci∣dents
and Niceties, with which it has been carryed on, the Infinite
Difficulties the Zealous Promoters of it met with, the Restless At∣tacks
of a Strong Party to Disappoint it, who never gave over their
Struggle, no not even after it was done: In this Labyrinth of
Untrode Paths, I may easily misplace some things, and omit others:
and I cannot but Introduce my Account of it with this Cau∣tion,
that tho' I believe no Man can have Collected with more
Care, nor has had the Opportunity to Remark things with more
Advantage, having been Eye Witness to much of the General
Transaction, and furnish'd by the best Hands with every most se∣cret
Affair in the Carrying it on; yet many Minute Things may
have past my Pen, which it is impossible for me to Attone for, but
by making this <HI>Proviso,</HI> That the Reader may be assured, nothing
Material can have slipp'd me; and I have used all necessary Cauti∣on
to furnish my self with the whole Truth of Fact, whatever Omis∣sion
of Circumstances I may make an Apology for.</P>
<P>I have already related the Issue of the Treaty begun the first Year
of the Queen, and made my Observations of the Reason of its Mis∣carriage:
It may be observed, That Her Majesty understaiding the
true Reasons of the Disappointment, which 'twas thought lay in the
Persons Treating, particularly on the <HI>English</HI> Side, whose Disposition
to finish it for the Publick Good, it was supposed, did not appear
at all to Her Satisfaction, <HI>in which I have further already Explain'd my
self,</HI> Obtain'd a New Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> and the like in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> Impowering the Queen to Appoint Commissioners on ei∣ther
Hand, to Treat of an Union between the Two Nations.—</P>
<P>And here 'tis necessary to observe, how well the Ground Plot of
this Work was laid, that all Obstacles might be removed, which
might threaten it with another Abortion; It had been noted,
that the most Dangerous Rock of Difference, on which this
Union could Split, and which could now render it Ineffectual, was
that of Religion: Here it was certain they could never Unite, and
<PB N="2" REF="110"/>
the Breach therefore being Irreconcileable, the best Course that could
be taken with it, was to let it quite alone as a thing neither side
should meddle with at all, and consequently the Jealousies and Sus∣picions
on both sides must vanish, and the great Obstructions which
the Enemies of the Treaty relyed on for its Miscarriage were at once
removed.</P>
<P>This was a Master-Piece of Policy, and shewed, that Her Maje∣sty
had other Persons to Consult with, and had taken other Mea∣sures
than before, and gave People very early Impressions of the
Success which has since appear'd.</P>
<P>But there was yet some Political Difficulty to pass, and here be∣ing
to Tread Truth almost on the Heels, those Readers that are
willing to have it told plainest, must excuse me for naming Peoples
Names: I have avoided, on all Occasions, the Mixing Satyr and
Reflection in this Relation, as much as possible.</P>
<P>The Political Difficulties I speak of here, and which I think gave
the greatest Shock to this Affair, consist of two Parts,
1. Succession. 2. Nobility.</P>
<P>The Vehemence with which the several Parties, who managed
these Topicks, acted their respective and exceedingly remote Pros∣pects;
and by what strange Mystery, concurring Providence,
like the Wheel within all their Wheels, center'd them all, in Unit∣ing
the Nations; as it is a secret History few understood, and may
be as Necessary as Diverting, so the Heads of it may be view'd in
the following Scheme.</P>
<P>1. The Succession being the main thing that lay at the Bot∣tom
of every ones Project, I shall first speak to the Particulars
of that.</P>
<P>There was a Party in both Kingdoms, but most Powerful
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Design was principally and directly against
the Protestant Succession as such; These we must allow to
be setting every Wheel at Work, and Acting with all their
Power and Policy against every thing which look'd that way.</P>
<P>When they saw it convenient, they acted against an Union in its
general Term, and frequently some of the less Politick of that Par∣ty
let fall the Excrescence of their Principles in direct Terms, and
Pamphlets were wrote upon that Scheme, such as one shewing the
Necessities of a War with <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c, another showing the Ad∣vantages
of an Union with other Nations, and <HI>France</HI> in particu∣lar;
others argued continually the mighty Terms, and the Advan∣tages
of Commerce <HI>Scotland</HI> might obtain from France, and not
only proposed them as Equivalent to the Trade with <HI>England,</HI> but
run on to such weak Extremes, as to say, that <HI>Scotland</HI> made no
Advantage of her Commerce with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But these may well be said to be the less Politick Part of these
Gentlemen who were in the Design above, for they lost Ground
even against the Union in self by it; and when the Committee of
Parliament, Appointed to Examine the Exports and Imports, Re∣ported,
That <HI>Scotland</HI> Exported to <HI>England</HI> above 200000 Pounds
<PB N="3" REF="111"/>
<HI>Sterling per Annum</HI> in Linen, Cattel, &amp;c. the Imports from thence
appear'd so small, that the Objectors dropp'd their Arguments upon
that Head, and learn'd to talk with more Caution.</P>
<P>But the more Subtile Managers of this Design against the Successi∣on,
went on by different Measures, and with great Policy they acted
every Party, as far as they thought they could be brought in to be
subservient to their Design.</P>
<P>Thus first seeming to quit their direct Opposition to the Successi∣on,
as a Thing too open, and too much Clashing with the Temper
of the Time, they fall in with that Party, who were for the Succes∣sion
with Limitations; Not that they would have concurr'd with
she Event, had these Limitations been never so great, but that, in
their Debating the Limitations, they might find Room to Clog the
Succession it self, in such manner as the other Party could by no
Means accept of it.</P>
<P>From the same Principle proceeded that Famous Resolve in their
Act of Security, by which the Succession met with two Invincible
Obstacles, from whence they knew, some time or other, new Dis∣putes
must arise, 1. That no Successor at all should be Named, till
after the Queen. 2. That when it was Named, it should be with
this Limitation, that it should not be the same that should Succeed
to the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This was a Master-Piece of Policy, and had the most Specious
Pretence in the World, <HI>viz.</HI> The Hardships which <HI>Scotland</HI> had
suffered under the Influence of <HI>England</HI> in Matters of Commerce and
Sovereignty; and therefore it was added immediately upon the
said Clause, <HI>Ʋnless that in this Present Session of Parliament, or any
other Session of this, or any ensuing Parliament, there be such Conditions
of Government Settled and Enacted, as may Secure the Honour and So∣vereignty
of this Crown and Kingdom, the Freedom, Frequency and
Power of Parliament, the Religion, Liberty and Trade of the Nation
from English, or any Forreign Influence.</HI> See the Act of Security Print∣ed
in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> (1)</P>
<P>The running things to this Height in <HI>Scotland,</HI> put every Parties
Measures to a full Stop; The Gentlemen who were against the Suc∣cession
in general, and of whom I am now Treating, had most ef∣fectually
carryed their Point; for as they presumed <HI>England</HI> could
never come in to such a Treaty as they demanded, so they had effec∣tually
foreclosed the Succession of <HI>Hannover,</HI> by Determining, that
the Successor of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> should not be the same.</P>
<P>And 'tis remarkable to note here, how universally all those Gentle∣men,
whose Aim was, <HI>Against</HI> the Succession, fell in with those
whose Design was only to have Advantageous Terms from <HI>England</HI>
for it.</P>
<P>But this very Point gain'd, brought about the main Work, and
the Contraries that concurr'd in this Act, tho' from Clashing in∣terests,
by the strange Circulation of Causes, work'd all together
into another Extreme, which none of them design'd, and that was
the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="112"/>
Upon the passing the Act of Security, <HI>England</HI> grew very uneasy,
and not to mention the common Apprehensions of the People, nor
how, and by whom they were encreased and fomented, the Act of
Parliament past, Intituted, <HI>An Act to prevent the Dangers arising from
the Act of Security in Scotland, &amp;c.</HI> is a Demonstration of what the
Tendency of these Things would be; For this Act, which I have also,
for the better understanding of the Story, Abridg'd and Printed in
the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> (2.) brought both Nations under the Necessity
of a War by the <HI>Christmass</HI> following; the <HI>English</HI> being then obliged
to fit out a Fleet, to interrupt the <HI>Scots</HI> Commerce, if their Act of
Security was not Repealed.</P>
<P>Things being brought to this Extremity, the only Remedy that
those who wished well to both Nations could contrive, was to re∣vive
a Treaty of Union, and set heartily about it,—and the
first Step the Queen took towards it, was to propose it to the <HI>Scots</HI>
Parliament, who Voted,—<HI>That they could enter into no Treaty
of Ʋnion, till that Act of Parliament mentioned above was Repeated
in England.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' this was a very bold Resolve, yet the Queen, who saw some
Reasonableness in it, managed Things with so much Wisdom and
Moderation; and the Parliament, who saw with differing Eyes
from the other, and was of a quite differing Temper, found some∣thing
so severe and so hard upon <HI>Scotland</HI> in that Act of Parlia∣ment,
that they made no Difficulty to make that Step in Advance
to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Foot turn'd the first Appearance of the Union; Now
let us see how the Parties managed themselves on all sides.</P>
<P>The Inclination on both sides to an Union, <HI>however afterwards
manag'd,</HI> seem'd so universal, That the Party I am speaking of,
thought it was not proper to appear against it directly; but acting still
under Disguise, they puzzle the Cause, <HI>first,</HI> With the wild Debate
of a Federal Union, or an Union Partial and Imperfect;—and
thus they fell in with the Party who were for the Union, not that
they had the Union in their Design; but because they thought the
Thing Impracticable in it self, That it would make the People
Sceptick in Government; and that so it would certainly miscarry,
and the Succession would be lost that way.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Limitations were by secret Influence opposed,
and the Scheme of Succession laid aside to go upon the <HI>Chimera</HI> of
an Union, <HI>as they thought it to be;</HI> and I could be very Merry with
some Gentlemen here, upon the Banters and Jests they always
Treated the Scheme of an Union with, as a Thing they little
thought would ever be licked into any Shape, or ever obtain up∣on
the Nations to pass into a Law.</P>
<P>Thus I have brought the remotest Party, who were downright
Enemies of the Union, to fall into it;—From whence, let
their Design be what it will, I must tell them, they did it this
Service, that it made the Union <HI>very Popular,</HI> however it came to
be otherways afterward.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="113"/>
I come next to the Difficulty about Nobility, and this work'd in
to an Union, by, as it were a Natural Consequence; For the
Antient Nobility finding their Sway with the People lessen'd, and
their Power, as well as their Honour, eclips'd, by the Crown day-ly
Creating Numbers of what <HI>they</HI> called Upstart Lords, were ea∣sily
engaged in Limitations, to prevent their Future Monarch's en∣creasing
the Numbers of their Rank, to the Diminution, as they
took it, of the Antient Families.</P>
<P>But when they came to consider the Scheme of Distinction made
for the Representing the Nobility in a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, they
were the more easily brought into the Union, as an effectual Step
to prevent the Reducing their Honour, by Multiplying their Num∣bers,
and as a thing which would seem to distinguish them from
such of the Modern Nobility, which they reckon'd already a Burthen
to them.</P>
<P>Next, among the <HI>Whig</HI> Interest, and who were really Honest in
their Designs for the General Good, were yet two Parties.</P>
<P>One Party, without Reflection on any, had taken a just Umbrage
at the Growing Power of a certain Great Man; and as they had
Reason to Ward off Personal Resentments, in case their Figure was
diminished; and having their true Interest in View, together with
the Publick Good, esteem'd it their Good Fortune, to have them
both stand upon one Bottom;—And these Gentlemen came hear∣tily
and honestly into the Measures of the Union.</P>
<P>Another Party were for the Succession <HI>Limited, &amp;c.</HI> but not for the
Union; These brought the former first to them, thinking they would
rather be for the Succession, and lay by the Thoughts of the Union;
but finding them intirely for the Union, they fell in together.</P>
<P>The View of the Court in <HI>England</HI> was plain, <HI>viz. For the Suc∣cession
at any Rate;</HI> and therefore, till this Juncture, they had
Espoused that Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were for the Succession, tho'
with Limitations; and this the more easily brought those Gentle∣men
into the Union, since there they secured the Succession, and
had the <HI>English</HI> Limitations Confirm'd, which they knew and ac∣knowledg'd
were better than their own.</P>
<P>Thus the two <HI>Whig</HI> Parties joyn'd, and the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI>
who had, in Concert with Her Majesty and the <HI>English</HI> Court, re∣moved
all the seeming Difficulties on the part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> appearing
publickly for it, the Union, as I have already noted, grew very
Popular, the Court and the <HI>Whig</HI> Lords concurr'd in the General
Good, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest were abandon'd, and the Union grew
up between all the Extremes as a Consequence; and it was mee∣ly
Formed by the Nature of Things, rather than by the Designs of
the Parties.</P>
<P>Things being brought to this Pass, the Acts of Parliament passed,
and the Queen Impowered to Name Commissioners; I shall pur∣sue
the Proceedings in Order as they ly before me, and make the
needful Observations as I go.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="114"/>
The respective Acts of Parliament for this Nomination, as abso∣lutely
necessary to the better understanding of the Case, and laying
a Regular Scheme of the whole Matter before the Eye of the Read∣er,
I have annexed in the Collection herewith marked.</P>
<P>They that had so wisely contrived the Beginning of this Work,
could not be at a Loss to find out proper Persons for the Managing
the Treaty in both Kingdoms; And therefore it was not long be∣fore
Her Majesty Named the Commissioners for both Kingdom,
whose Names we shall presently come to.</P>
<P>I shall not descend to Encomiums on the Persons of the Treaters;
For I am not about to write Panegyricks here, but an Impartial
and Unbyast History of Fact. But since the Gentlemen have been
ill treated, especially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon this very Head, Charg'd
with strange Things, and Exposed in Print by some, who had no∣thing
but their Aversion to the Treaty to move them to Maletreat
them: I must be allowed, on all Occasions, to do them Justice in
the Process of this Story.—And as I must owne, That, generally
speaking, they were Persons of the greatest Probity, the best Cha∣racters,
and the steadiest Adherence to the true Interest of their
Countrey; so, their Abilities will appear in every Step
taken in so great a Work, the bringing it to so short a Con∣clusion,
and that, in so little Time, the Reducing it to so Concise
a Form, and so Fixing it, That, when all the Obstruction imagi∣nable
was made to it afterward in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
Mountains of Objection, which at first Amused the World proved
such Mole-hills, were so easily Removed, Raised so much Noise,
and Amounted to so little in Substance, That, after all was granted,
that in Reason could be Demanded, the Amendments were so few,
and of so little Weight, that there was not one Thing Material e∣nough,
to obtain a Negative in the <HI>English</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>I cannot but note here, That even those Amendments were
not made, by Reason of any Omission in the Treaters; But the
Parliament found the Opposing Party to the Succession had two
Handles to lay hold on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore in Prudence gave
way to such Amendments, as they had the least Reason to Justify;
These two Heads, which I call Handles against the Succession, were,</P>
<P>1. Strength of Party, by which they hop'd to Carry it at once,
and Throw out the Treaty <HI>Brevi Manu;</HI> and this they endeavour'd
to Form upon a General Dislike, they having Blacken'd it with the
Mark of a Thing Dishonourable to the Sovereignty and the Inde∣pendence
of the Nation.</P>
<P>2. If they found that would not do, then to load it with such
Ridiculous Amendments, as they knew would cause it to miscarry
in the <HI>English</HI> Parliament; which they also thought would give
<HI>Scotland</HI> great Advantage, and Encrease the Animosities in <HI>Scotland</HI>
against the <HI>English,</HI> when the Rupture should appear to be from
<HI>England,</HI> and the most Reasonable Concessions of <HI>Scotland</HI> be Re∣jected
by them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="115"/>
But both these Projects failed them; The first was effectually
Answer'd by the Nature of the Thing; and their Strength fail∣ing
them, they found they had cast up their Account false,
their Motion being thrown out by a great Majority in Voting the
first Article, as will appear presently.</P>
<P>The second, when they came to Examine Particulars, had not
sufficient Strength of Reason to support it; all the Amend∣ments
they could pretend to, were so small, That, <HI>as above,</HI> the
Parliament of <HI>England</HI> never thought it worth their while to Dis∣pute
them; and the Treaters themselves, for the most part, went
into those Amendments, as they were offered.</P>
<P>Indeed this was a Disappointment to some People, who made
no Question, at least, to puzzle the Cause, and raise such Difficul∣ties,
as should Require a Remitting the Treaty back to <HI>Scotland;</HI>
and so spin it out in Length, that the Nations might have Leisure
to Form the separate parties into some Order; and raising their
tFriends on both Sides, if possible, bring it to a Breach—; And
that I do not pass an unjust Censure, I refer the Reader, among
Infinite Pamphlets publish'd against this Affair, to one very plain
and bare-fac'd Author mentioned before, Entituled, The Necessity
of a War with <HI>England,</HI> in Order to Cure the present Distempers of
the Times.</P>
<P>I should do the Fomenters of the Nations Divisions too much
Credit, to Trouble the Reader of this with any of their Print∣ed
Oratory against this Union, much less enter into any Disquisiti∣ons
upon the Subject of their Glamours;—But I may, perhaps,
touch upon the principal Heads of their Objections, and let the
World know also, who were some of the Objectors.</P>
<P>When the Acts were thus pass'd, and Her Majesty had Nam'd
Commissioners on both Sides, and the Work seemed to be going
about in Earnest; The Learned Scriblers of the Age began to
Harrass the World with their Schemes, and all the Mountebank
Statesmen of the Times set to Work, to propose their Wondrous
Methods for Curing this Antient Distemper of the Nations, and
striving to have it said of themselves, who was Forwardest in the
Great Work.</P>
<P>The Industry they discover'd had, in nothing, a greater Concur∣rence,
than in this, That the whole Croud of Writers, with an
Universal Agreement, had the Honour to be intirely mistaken; and
not one of them had Eyes to see to the true Interest of the Nations;
every Man, as, in such Cases is usual, Eyed the respective Interests
or Advantages, as he thought, of the Nation to which he belong'd,
and set himself to Work to Answer the Objections of the other,
Defending, Arguing, and Fatiguing their own Heads, and their
Readers, with the Confused Labyrinths of their own Projects; but
not once touching the true String, which, with a National Unison,
would have immediately Sounded out the Harmony of General
Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="116"/>
Nor am I at all Arrogant, in saying, they were all so generally
mistaken in their Notions of what this Union should be; Since,
as I have said, every one fell to Arguing the single and separate Ad∣vantages
of the Nation they belong'd to; Insisting on their Politick
Notions, and Wise Schemes for their respective Advantages: But,
not one, that I met with, ever Entered into the True and Only
Notion Essential to the Union; I mean the Principle of Self-Denial,
how far either Nation was to Condescend and Advance to one ano∣ther,
How the present Union Consisted not, in Gaining Advantages
on either Haud of one and other; but in Abatements, in giving each
other Advantages, in yielding up Privileges, opening the Treasures
and Strength of either Nation, to the Good and Benefit of the whole.</P>
<P>They never dream'd, That, to Unite, was, in it self, a full and
a general Retribution for every Step taken from one Side to the
other; That a New National Interest was to be Erected; and
that giving or Conceding Rights, Advantages and Interests, whe∣ther
in Commerce or in Privileges, was losing nothing at all; but
was like a Man giving Presents to a Lady, whom he designs to
make his Wife; which is but taking his Money out of one Pocket,
and putting it into another; or like a Man settling his Estate in
Joynture on his Wife, which is still his own, and is effectually se∣cured
for his Posterity.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen must pardon me, if I tell them, That, for want
of this True and Original Notion of Union, they took but too
much Pains to Inform us all, they had neither the Spirit of Union
in their Minds, nor the Knowlege of it in their Heads—; And
this run them upon Wild <HI>Dilemmas</HI> and Dark Schemes of Federati∣ons
and Confederations; This sent them to <HI>Belgia, Helvetia, Po∣lonia,</HI>
and I know not whither, for Examples for Schemes, Prece∣dents,
and I know not what strange Systems of National Unions;
all which, I must take the Liberty to say, were as Wide from the
only Step, that could make these Nations happy, as the East is from
the West, tended to nothing, but Confusion of Interests, National
Jealousies, and in the end War and Destruction.</P>
<P>These Gentlemen were for making Bargains between the Nations,
not for bringing two Great and Mighty Kingdoms into one Vast
United Body, the same in Interest, the same in Prospect, the same
in every Substantial Constituting Part; The Advocates of either
People talk'd like Counsellors Pleading for their Clients, not like
two Friends, that were Striving, who should part with most, for
the Interest and Engagement of the Love of each other.</P>
<P>In short, the Union has been brought to pass, not by gaining
from, but by yielding to one another; Not by making Conditions
and Advantages of one another, but by Conceding to one another;
One part opens the Treasures of their Trade, the other struggles to
bear their Share of the Weight and Burden of Expensive and Bloody
Wars; This part yields up one thing, that abates another, and
Mutual Condescensions, not Mutual Encroachments, have brought
this Work to pass.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="117"/>
And here lyes the great Mystery of the Union; They that think
strange of the Circumlocutions the Wisest Heads have taken, may
find them here; They that Enquire into the Reasons of former
Miscarriages, may find them all here; If there was any want of
Temper, any mutual Distrusts, any secret Murmurs of Parties, any
Jealousies of Consequences, it was all to be found here; That the
People, who Debated these Points, never Look'd beyond the pre∣sent
State, never Considered the Conjunct Capacity of the Nations,
never drew the Ballance of Interests, or stated the Affairs of both
Nations into one Account Current.</P>
<P>Had they ever done this, they would have seen that Monster, as
they call'd the Union, a most Beautiful Creature, Admirable in its
Contexture, Agreeable in its Figure, Squar'd like a most Exquisite
Piece of Architect, both for Ornament, Strength, and Usefulness;
They would have seen it a Compleat Circle, all the Lines of which
were drawn from, and depended upon one General Centre, the Pub∣lick
Good, a Mighty Arch every Stone of which mutually contribut∣ed,
not to its Private Support only, but to the Strength of the whole:
Here is the True Original of the Union, and the Wisdom of the
Treaters on both sides, was in nothing more Conspicuous, than
that they came to this Treaty furnished with the true Notions of
what they were to do, and consequently the properest and only
Method for the doing it could not be Concealed from them; and
we cannot but observe, That, thro' all the Course of the Treaty,
the Gentlemen kept themselves closs to this Principle, to yield to
one another in every thing, which the Nature of the Union they
aim'd at requir'd, and the Nature of the Thing before them would
possibly permit.</P>
<P>I must confess, to me, all the Notions of Federal Unions, Gua∣rantees,
and Everlasting Peace, which our several Writers fill'd our
Heads with, while the Treaty was appointed, but not yet begun;
appear'd to me as imperfect <HI>Embrious,</HI> False Conceptions, and Births
that must end in Abortions and Disappointments; I will not say,
I had Foresight of Events enough to prescribe what Methods should
be taken, or what Issue would be produced from the Treaty then in
View; but this I took the Freedom always to tell the World, That
it must be a general, compleat, intire and indissolvable Union of In∣terests
and Parties, depending upon Equalities of Privileges, and
Equalities of Burdens, Equalities of Prospects, and Equalities, if
possible, in Desires, or that it would be Imperfect in its Parts, and
Confused in its Whole.</P>
<P>I know one Reason why this sort of Union was less thought on,
than perhaps it would have been, was, because the Gentlemen, when
they come to Examine what had ever been Attempted this way, found
nothing of a full and intire Union, but that under the Conquest of
the Parliament Times—; And, <HI>Alas! SAYS ONE,</HI> This must
be rendered so Odious, because 'twas the Work of a Tyrant, an
Usurper, and what not, that no Body could bear to Recommend
it; and if at any time a Man was driven by the Necessity of his
<PB N="10" REF="118"/>
Judgment, the Convictions of his Reason, and the Consequences of
Argument, to come to the Borders of that Scheme, he would Start
at the Hint, as if he had seen a <HI>Spectrum,</HI> and fly even from his
own Reason, because it concurr'd with what was hit upon
by the Man and the People he did not Approve.</P>
<P>And why will you go by <HI>Whiteball</HI> Gentlemen, where so many
wicked Rebels Triumph'd over their Monarch? Why will you use
the Navy, nay some of the very Ships, with which the same <HI>Oliver
Cromwel</HI> Beat your Neighbours?</P>
<P>If <HI>Oliver</HI> had not been a Master of Politicks, he had never been
<HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> in the Terms we are now Talking of him; and
because he hit upon the only Step that could be taken to Fix the
Union of the two Nations, must we Reject it, and rather Destroy
the Kingdoms, than close with his Unhallowed Method?</P>
<P>Reason and the Nature of Things guides all Men, whose Eyes
are open, to the same Methods, when they are pursuing the same
Designs, let <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> be what he will, and who he will, 'tis
no part of my Business here, take him in all the Blackest Figures he
can be Represented—; What was the End he pursued in his
Uniting <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI>—? It was so to joyn them, that both
Parties being made intirely easy, might, without Hesitation, sub∣mit
themselves to his otherwise precarious Authority; and was
he right in this, That, to give the two Nations a free and full
Communication, both of Trade, Privileges and Advantages, was
the true and only way to make all People easie—? So far his
Project may be good for us, without so much as touching upon the
Parallel.</P>
<P>The Business of the Union was, to make the Nations casie, to put
them in a State of Mutual Advantage; If fourty Tyrants have
pursued the Method for it, tho' with Wicked Designs, it was for us
to take the Method, and mend the Design, as much as we could.</P>
<P><HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> made a Conquest of <HI>Scotland</HI>—, well, and what
then—? Let those People, who have Talk'd so much of an
Union of Subjection, and Conquering <HI>Scotland,</HI> go back hither for
a Precedent; <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> knew as well what belong'd to
Conquest, as any Body in this Age will pretend to; Nor was he
less Politick in Keeping, than Terrible in Obtaining; and what
did heresolve all his Northern Conquest into—? Nothing but
Union, the best Concerted, the best Executed, the best Approved,
that ever this Island saw till now; Nor could all the Heads in
Christendom have Formed the present Happy Union, but from the
Schemes of those Times.</P>
<P>If ever Nation gain'd by being Conquer'd, it was here; They
were Subdued first, and then made I Happy; and <HI>Scotland</HI> Flourished,
Justice had its Uninterrupted Course, Trade Increas'd, Money
plentifully Flowed in, and all under what they call'd Tyranny and
Usurpation, all under a Standing Army, Government, and with all
the Disadvantages that can be imagined from such a Consitution,
as tended to Subjection, not Liberty, Poverty and Misery, not
Peace and Plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="119"/>
And what was the Foundation of all this? Nothing but the Na∣tural
Product of Common Reasoning, he found, that the only way
to preserve the Conquest he had made on the Powers of the Nations,
was to make a Conquest of their Affections; That the only way
to do this, was to let them see their Interest and Happiness in his
Government; and that this could only be brought to pass, by
Uniting and intirely Incorporating the Nations into one; Commu∣nicating
Peace, Privileges, and all possible Advantages to them
—; And thereby letting them see the true way to their prosperity.</P>
<P>No Man will say, this was not the most Politick Step he could
take; and must we Contemn the Method, because we cannot be
Reconcil'd to the Man—? Certainly if Union and Incorporati∣on
of Interests was able to make the Nation Happy under a stand∣ing
Army, and an Absolute Government, as that was; Things in
their Nature, Inconsistent with Liberty and National Prosperity; it
must be much more Capable under a Just and Limited Government,
where Law Governs the very Actions of the Sovereign, and all the
Branches of Power are squar'd by, and sincerely Imploy'd for the
Publick Good: And it can be no Lessening the Value of any True
Scheme of National Management, that a Person Used or Contriv'd
it, that we call a Tyrant or an Usurper; Let him be never so
much a Tyrant, he show'd he had the True Spirit of Government
in him by this, that he knew the only way to make his Government
safe, was to make it easy; and to have the People quiet, was to
make them Happy—; And this he did by <HI>Union,</HI> an intire in∣corporated
Union—; And the Event proved, his Measures were
rightly taken:</P>
<P>Our End is now the same, tho' our Views are differing, to
make the People Happy is the End—; If <HI>Union</HI> be the way,
why is it to be liked the worse, because <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> drew the
Scheme?</P>
<P>I have made this Digression, not purely to show, how our Writ∣ers
came to be mistaken in their Schemes, and why they never hit
upon this Draught in all their Proposals, tho' that introduc'd it;
but also to prove, that this Intire incoporating Union has in it self
the Seed of National Felicity, in that it wrought then that Wonder
which the World can rarely produce, <HI>viz.</HI> Liberty in Tyranny,
Prosperity in Conquest, and a Nation Saved even in being Sub∣dued.</P>
<P>Could it produce this Wonderful Effect, much more must it be
supposed Capable now? And I am perswaded, no Man in his
Senses will like the Effect of the present Union the worse, for its
receiving any of its parts from the Politicks of these Times, if the
Happiness of the present Time may be seen in it.</P>
<P>And here I must own, That the present Union has some Ad∣vantage,
<HI>tho' the Nations have paid dear for the Experiment,</HI> in that
it has been Formed upon the Foot of all the most Politick Schemes
of former Times; and all the Miscarriages of former Treaties have
been as Warnings to Furnish the Experience of these Times
<PB N="12" REF="120"/>
to make them wary, and instruct them how to avoid the Rocks
that others Split on.</P>
<P>I have now brought the Treaters to <HI>London;</HI> Their Names, and
the Commission for them respectively to Treat, I have Inserted in
the Minutes of the Treaty, as it was laid before the Parliament of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> immediately following this Part.</P>
<P>When they first met, they hardly knew what Measures they should
take; They knew what Business they came to do, but I dare say,
the Gentlemen will bear with me, in saying, they could not fore∣see
the Manner and Management that follow'd; and it was a pleas∣ing
Surprize, to find all Sides and Parties to agree, in leaving all
Politick Methods formerly studied, rather to Delay and Defeat the
Design of an Union, than to Compleat it; and to fall in heartily
to Consider, as the General <HI>Thesis,</HI> what could Conduce most to
the Main Design of their Meeting, <HI>THE UNION;</HI> And in Or∣der
to this, they Resolved not to Study Advantages against one
another; nor to Demand on either Side any Thing, but what was
agreeable to both Kingdoms, in their United Capacity; This was
a Happy Indication, That both Sides came together with a True Spi∣rit
of the Union among them; That they sincerely intended to apply
themselves to it with the utmost Diligence, and to pursue it by all
the most proper Methods to bring it to pass—; The very contrary
Extreme of which, is what, as I have already noted, has been the
principal Occasion of the Miscarriage of all the former Treaties, and
which Good Men were very much afraid of now—.</P>
<P>Before they met in Publick, some of the Commissioners on both
Sides had a Meeting among themselves, privately to Consider of the
Method of Proceeding.</P>
<P>And here it was first Debated, in what Manner Proposals should
be Delivered and Receiv'd; Some were for having Conferences of
every Thing that should be proposed, for the Convenience of Free
Reasoning; Others Objected against that as Tedious, and Offered
as the most Expeditious Method, That every Thing should be De∣livered
in Writing, and then the Commissioners respectively Meeting
apart, might Reason among themselves, and give in their Resolutions
the more perfect—; And this was agreed on by both parties.</P>
<P>This is the Cause, That, in the Minutes of this Treaty, we have
little of their private Reasonings Recorded; since, their having
been thus by themselves, they have not been noticed so, as to come
to Light in any Regular Manner.</P>
<P>There was but one Publick Conference, which was Desir'd by the
Commissioners for <HI>Scotland;</HI> and this was about the Number of
the <HI>Scots Representatives in Parliament;</HI> and in this 'tis impossible
to get the particular Arguments used on both Sides. The par∣ticular
Persons on either Side were as follows,</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> the Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> who Opened the Thing, and
Desir'd the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> to propose their Reasons,
why the <HI>English</HI> should give a greater Number than was mentioned.</P>
<P>Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> spoke next, and gave Reasons why
they Insisted upon a greater Number.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="121"/>
Mr. Secretary <HI>Harley</HI> Replyed to Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland.
The Lord Chancellor</HI> Spoke a Second Time, in Answer to Mr.
Secretary <HI>Harley.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> Spoke after, to what the Lord Chancellor
had offered.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> Replyed to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke's</HI> Speech.</P>
<P>The Lord Keeper spoke next.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>David Dalrymple</HI> Follow'd the Lord Keeper.</P>
<P>Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI> to Sir <HI>David.</HI>
And Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> Concluded.</P>
<P>The great Design of the Arguments on the part of the <HI>Scots</HI> Com∣missioners,
were summ'd up in this;</P>
<P>That they could have no Precedent, as to Number of Represen∣tatives,
Argued from <HI>Oliver Cromwel's</HI> Division; because he was Ar∣bitrary,
and neither gave a just Representation to <HI>England,</HI> or to
<HI>Ireland;</HI></P>
<P>That the present Scheme of Taxes could not be the Rule; but,
if the Representative was to be Measur'd by the Proportion of Taxes
it was on their Side; since, immediately upon the Union, those
Taxes would be greater;</P>
<P>That, if any Rule could be laid down, it ought to be an Arith∣metical
Proportion, between the Number of People and the Taxes
paid, Considered on both Sides respectively; In which Case, the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> were brought as an Example, where, if you take the
People, without their Circumstances of Wealth, they Bear no Pro∣portion,
because their Riches are vastly greater than their Num∣bers;
If their Riches are taken without their People, the Dispro∣portion
would be as great the other way.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it was Concluded, there could be no certain
Rule, to Direct their Lordships the Commissioners, but the
present Circumstances of the Nations should be Judg'd of by both
Sides, and such a Representative to be Allow'd, as should be Agree∣able
to Justice in both;</P>
<P>Upon this Debate, their Lordships Retired on either Hand; and
the next Day, the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> brought in a Proposal
for a Representative for <HI>Scotland,</HI> Augmented to Fourty Five Com∣moners,
and Sixteen Lords, which the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners acqui∣ese'd
in, as will more particularly appear by the Minutes of the
Treaty, which are inserted at large, as they were Extracted out of
the Books of the Commissioners, and beginning with the Com∣missions
respectively given to the Persons Appointed to Treat, as

in the Person of Our Royal Great Grandfather King <HI>James</HI>
the First, since which happy Conjunction, it hath been very much
Endeavoured that a nearer and more compleat Union might be sett∣led
between both Kingdoms, and some Progress towards the Attain∣ment
thereof was made, not only in the time of Our said late Royal
Great Grandfather, but also in the time of Our late Royal Uncle
<PB N="18" REF="126"/>
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second. <HI>And whereas.</HI> We out of Our princely
Zeal and Care for the Welfare and Happiness of Our Subjects, being
also desirous of a nearer and more compleat Union between Our Two
said Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> did Recommend to Our Par∣liament
of <HI>England</HI> from the Throne, to Consider of proper Methods
for obtaining the same: And whereas, In Our Parliament held at
<HI>Westminster</HI> the Third and Fourth Years of Our Reign, an Act pass'd,
Intituled, An Act for the effectual Securing the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI>
from the apparent Dangers that may arise from several Acts pass'd in the
Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI> In and by which Act of Parliament, it was
Enacted, That such Persons as should be Nominated by Us, under
Our Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> or such and so many of them as should
in that behalf be Appointed by Us to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> should by
Force of the same Act, have full Power, Commission and Authority,
at such Time and Times, and in such Place or Places as We should
Please to Appoint to Assemble and Meet; and thereupon to Treat and
Consult according to the Tenor, or Purport of their Authority or
Commission in that behalf, with certain Commissioners as should be
Authorized by Authority of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of and con∣cerning
such an Union of the said Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and of and concerning such other Matters, Clauses and Things as
upon mature Deliberation of the greatest part of the said Commis∣sioners
Assembled as aforesaid, and the Commissioners to be Autho∣riz'd
by the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to the Tenor or Pur∣port
of their Commission in that behalf, should in their Wisdoms think
Convenient and Necessary for Our Honour, and the Common Good
of both Our said Kingdoms for ever: And that the Commissioners
of both Our said Kingdoms should according to the Tenor or Pur∣port
of their said Authority and Commissions in that behalf, Reduce
their Doings and Proceedings therein into Writings or Instruments
Quadrupartite, every Part to be Subscrib'd and Seal'd by them, to
the end, that one part thereof may in all Humbleness be presented
to Us, two other parts thereof to be Offered to the Consideration
of the Parliament for the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and another part
thereof to be Offered to the Consideration of the Parliament for the
Realm of <HI>Scotland</HI> at their next Sessions, which should be held in
each Kingdom respectively after such Writings or Instruments should
be Subscrib'd and Seal'd by the said Commissioners, that thereupon
such further Proceedings might be had as We, and both the said
Parliaments should think Fit and Necessary, for the Well and Com∣mon
Good of both the said Kingdoms, to whom the Entire Con∣sideration
of the whole, and the Allowing or Disallowing of the
whole, or any part thereof as they shall think fit, is wholly Reserv'd
as in and by the said Act, Relation being thereunto had, may more
at learge appear. And whereas, in the Fourth Year of Our Reign,
an Act was made and pass'd in our Parliament of our Kingdom of

Commissioners for Our Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> of and concerning an

give any verbal Assurances of their Zeal to Promote and compleat
(so far as in their Power) the great and good Design we are met

us the same Sentiments, which so lately appeared in the Parliament

prevent all Misunderstandings, to cherish and Improve the Good
Dispositions to one another we meet with, to have the General and
Joynt Good of both Kingdoms, solely in our View, and not the
separate of either; but to Act, as if we were already United in In∣terest,
and had nothing left to Consider, but what Settlements and
Provisions are most likely to conduce to the common Safety and
Happiness of this whole Island of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Which Measures, if pursued on both Parts, we hope may enable
us to prepare such Terms of Union, as may prove satisfactory to
Her Majesty, and the Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P>

<DIV1>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> have desired me to As∣sure
your Lordships, that they meet you on this Occasion,
with great Willingness and Satisfaction, to Treat of an
Union between the two Kingdoms, and of such other Matters and
Concerns, as may be for Her Majesties Honour, and the maintain∣ing
a Good Understanding between the two Nations.</P>
<P>We are convinced that an Union will be of a great Advantage to
both; the Protestant Religion will be thereby the more Firmly Se∣cured;
the Designs of our Enemies effectually Disappointed; and
the Riches and Trade of the whole Island Advanced.</P>
<P>This Union has been often Endeavour'd, both before, and since
the Kingdoms were United in Allegiance under one Sovereign; and
several Treaties have been set on foot for that End, tho without
the desired Success; But now we are hopeful that this shall be the
Happy Opportunity of Accomplishing it; Her Majesty hath fre∣quently
signify'd Her Good Inclinations towards it; And we are
the more Encouraged to expect Success in this Treaty, by the Good
Disposition appeared in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> for it, and by
the Friendly proceedings in the last Session of the Parliament of
<HI>England,</HI> which gave general satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="131"/>
We have great Confidence in your Lordships Good Intentions,
and we shall be ready on our parts, to enter into such Measures with
you, as may bring the Treaty to such a Conclusion, as may be ac∣ceptable
to Her Majesty, and to the Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Ordered that Copies of the Two Commissions be prepared and
Sign'd by the respective Secretaries, and Interchang'd against the
next Meeting.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> acquainted the Board, That the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do agree to the Preliminary Ar∣ticles
propos'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> at the last

Meeting, for Regulating the Methods of Proceedings in this
Treaty.</P>
<P>The following Proposals were also delivered to the Board by the
Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and were Read.</P>
<P>1. That the Succession to the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in case of Failure
of Heirs of Her Majesties Body, shall be Established upon the same
Persons mentioned in an Act of Parliament made in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
in the <HI>12th</HI> and <HI>13th</HI> Year of the Reign of the late King
<HI>William,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act for the further Limitation of the Crown,

of <HI>England</HI> shall enjoy the like Rights and Priviledges in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>3. That there be free Communication and Intercourse of Trade
and Navigation between the two Kingdoms, and Plantations there∣unto
belonging, under such Regulations, as in the Progress of this
Treaty, shall be found most for the Advantages of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>4. That all Laws and Statutes in either Kingdom contrary to the
Terms of this Union be Repealed.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> withdrew, and being Re∣turn'd,
The Lord Keeper, in their Lordships Names, Delivered to
the Board the following Answer, which was Read.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> are so fully convinced
that nothing but an Entire Union of the two Kingdoms, will settle
perfect and lasting Friendship between them; That they therefore
think fit to decline entring into any further Consideration of the
Proposal now made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
not tending to that End and Desire; That the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> would be pleased to give in their Answer, to the Pro∣posal
delivered on <HI>Munday</HI> the 22d instant by the Lords Commis∣sioners
for <HI>England,</HI> in order to an entire Union of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Adjourn'd to <HI>Thursday</HI> the 25th instant 5 in the Evening.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS on the MINUTS of the three first Days.</HEAD>
<P>The Ceremonies on either Hand being over, <HI>Wednesday</HI> was the
first Day in which it may be said, any thing of Business was entred
upon.</P>
<P>The Commissioners on the <HI>English</HI> side presented a Summary,
as it may be call'd, of an Union in General, by which it is plain,
a compleat Incorporation of the two Kingdoms was proposed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Proposal was less General, and yet readily agreeing
to the Succession, to a Communication of Privileges, and an Inter∣course
of Trade.</P>
<P>I mention this here, because it was afterwatds objected to
the Treaters on the <HI>Scots</HI> side in the following Parliament, That
<PB N="25" REF="133"/>
they had given up their Countrey to the <HI>English,</HI> coming into
an Incorporating Union immediately, without proposing any
Terms which might have been more Advantageous to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It is manifest the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners did make Proposals
of Uniting, which were not Incorporating; or at least, which
being restricted to their own Countrey only, were signisicant of
a Concern for <HI>Scotland,</HI> leaving the Proposal on the behalf of
<HI>England,</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners.</P>
<P>But, as will appear in the subsequent Minuts, the <HI>English</HI>
Commssioners were come to a Resolution previous to this Treaty,
<HI>viz.</HI> That nothing could compleat the Felicity of either King∣dom,
and for ever remove all possible Difficulties, Breaches, and
Separation of Interests from among them for the future, but an
entire and Incorporating Union, by which the two Nations
should be formed into one Government, be under one Sove∣reign
Head, in one Represented Body, standing upon one Foun∣dation,
enjoying equal Privileges, and in common bearing one ge∣neral
proportion of Burdens, the same in End and Mean, having
but one Common Interest, one Name, and being for ever here∣after
but one People.</P>
<P>This therefore they laid down as the <HI>Thesis</HI> of their future
Conferences, and pursuant to this, the first General they delive∣red
in, contain'd the Three and most Essential Articles of the
following Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> The Uniting the Two Kingdoms into
One, the settling the Representation in one Assembly of Par∣liament,
and the settling the Succession in the same Line.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Scots</HI> Proposals being short in the General Incorpo∣rating
Part, the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners insisted upon it, as above, de∣clining
to Treat upon Particulars till that was first Determin'd,
all Debate of Particulars being not so directly tending to a Con∣clusion,
till the great and main Question was Agreed to, Whe∣ther
the Union should be Entire or no, in the sense as above.</P>
<P>The prosecuting this Question will effectually Defend the
<HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners, who tho they were afterward convinc'd
of the main Point in Debate, <HI>viz.</HI> That nothing but an Entire
Union would be effectual to settle a lasting Friendship between
the two Nations, yet did not so easily give up their other Pro∣posals,
as was suggested; nor did they give them up at all
meerly upon the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners refusing to Treat on any
other Foot—. For the directest Answer to a Resolution so posi∣tive
as that might have been thought to have been an equal
Stiffness, and refusing to resolve upon so general a Clause, till
other Heads had been Adjusted.</P>
<P>But the Commissioners on the <HI>Scots</HI> side found themselves
convinc'd, <HI>First,</HI> Of the Sincerity and candid Intentions of the
Commissioners on the <HI>English</HI> Part, to pursue such a Treaty, and
in such a manner, as might most conduce to the mutual Hap∣piness
<PB N="26" REF="134"/>
of both Kingdoms, and to make the Union both Lasting
and Effectual.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They found themselves convinc'd upon serious De∣bate
and further Enquiry into Particulars, that nothing but this
Incorporation of Interests, Privileges, and Circumstances, could
make an Effectual, Lasting, Indissolvable Union, and so they
came unto it with the same Sincerity, and from the same candid
Design of settling the whole, and of Acting to the advantage
of Either Party—. Not being at all Over-ruled, Awed, or Drawn
in, as was objected afterwards against them—. And this would
appear at large, if the long Debates, Speeches, and Arguments
on both Sides could have been recover'd.</P>

<P>THE Lord Chancellor, in the Name of the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>Scotland,</HI> delivered to the Board an Answer to the Proposal made
on the 22d instant, by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> with
a Provision therein-mentioned, which was Read.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> have considered the
Proposal given in to them by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI>
on <HI>Monday</HI> the 22d instant, and do agree, that the two Kingdoms
of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> be for ever United into one Kingdom, by
the Name of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> That the United Kingdom of <HI>Great∣Britain,</HI>
be Represented by one and the same Parliament, and that
the Succession to the Monarchy of the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> (in
case of Failure of Heirs of Her Majesties Body) shall Descend upon
the most excellent Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> Electoress and Dutchess Dowager
of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and remain to her and the Heirs of her Body, being
Protestants, to whom the Succession to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> is pro∣vided,
by an Act made in the 12th and 13th year of the Reign of
the late King <HI>William,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act for the further Limitation of
the Crown, and better securing the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects,
and excluding all Papists, and who shall Marry Papists in the Terms of
the said Act;</HI> With this provision, That all the Subjects of the Uni∣ted
Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> shall have full Freedom and Inter∣course
of Trade and Navigation, to, and from any Part or Place
within the said United Kingdom, and Plantations thereunto be∣longing;
and there be a Communication of all other Privileges and
Advantages, which do, or may belong to the Subjects of either
Kingdom.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> withdrew, and being re∣turned,
the Lord Keeper did in the Name of the Lords Commissio∣ners
for <HI>England,</HI> deliver to the Board the following Reply, which
was Read.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> are of opinion, that the
Provision added by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the
Proposal made by the Lords, Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> upon the
22d instant, is a necessary Consequence for an entire Union; And
<PB N="27" REF="135"/>
therefore their Lordships do Agree to the said Provision, under such
Terms as in the further Progress of this Treaty, shall be found to
be for the common Advantage of both Kingdoms.</P>

<P>The Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Debates and
Reasonings on the last Day about the general Proposal of the
Union, as an Incorporating Entire Union, had also a Meeting
among themselves, in which it was Determined after a long
Consideration, to Agree to the proposal made by the <HI>English</HI>
Commissioners, of a full and entire Incorporation.</P>
<P>This is what was afterwards reflected on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which
the opposing Party called <HI>A Betraying their Countrey;</HI> and as
far as possible incensed the People against them, who punning
on the word <HI>Treaters,</HI> called them <HI>the Traitors;</HI> and on this
Foot it was, that when the Rabble in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> first took a
Head, they pretended to Insult the <HI>Treaters,</HI> as the Persons that
had given them up to the <HI>English,</HI> and accordingly began with
Sir <HI>Patrick Johnstoun,</HI> a Person who was otherwise universally
beloved among them, and had merited the Esteem he had with
them, by a Sober, Discrect, and Gentlemanlike Behaviour, as

the End for which they were propos'd; for which Reason they
were directed to be drawn in another method, and hop'd they
would be got ready to lay before the Board next <HI>Munday.</HI></P>
<P>Adjourn'd to <HI>Munday</HI> the 6th intiant.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION III.</HEAD>
<P>The main Points of Union being thus settled, as above, and
all the Federal Provincial and Consederating Schemes, which
the World without Doors had filled their Heads with, being va∣nish'd,
the Commissioners fell closs to their Work; and the
first Article proposed by the <HI>England</HI> Commissioners laid the Scheme
of the whole Affair, <HI>viz. Customs,</HI> Excises, and Temporary
Taxes, Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Regulations of Trade.</P>
<P>The great Question now before them was, how to fix a Center in
all these, or a great Standart of Equalities, so as every part might
bear its equal Share of the Burdens, of the War, in Proportion to
its Capacity, and every part enjoy its equal share of the Advan∣tages
of Commerce, each bear an equal part of the Weight
of the Government, and reap an equal part of its Protection.
This Scale of Equalities had a great Variety of Discording Parts
in its To bring together the Difficulties of whichwas the Business
now before them, and the Method of Reconciling them, will
appear in the further Observations on these Proceedings.</P>
<P>The first thing requisit to bring this Matter into a way of De∣bate,
was for either side to give in a True State of the ordinary
Revenue, the Debts and the Extraordinary Taxes of either King∣dom,
that a Scale of Proportions might be formed.</P>
<P>I mention it here, to note how naturally every thing occurr'd,
in order to the main End; and how, alter the first Concession
of an entire Incorporation, every thing, that might rend to
Completing that Design, came in of Course; For, without
doubt, Equalities and Proportion of Texes, Privileges and Ad∣vantages,
was, must be the only Method, to bring about a
compleat entire Union of Interests, and it was impossible to be
done without it</P>
<P>The Undertaking indeed Amazed the World, and when People
began to look into it with but a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rausient View, it appeared a
<PB N="30" REF="138"/>
perfect <HI>Chaos,</HI> a Mass of Absurdities, which it would be impos∣sible
to Reconcile; The People, who had proposed their Fede∣ral
Schemes, laugh'd at this Project, and talk'd of it as impracti∣cable,
called it a <HI>Chimera,</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> Ministery, and pretended
to Prophesy its Dwindling into Nothing, and bringing the
Treaty to the same Issue, as was done in the last Commission.</P>
<P>But when Abler Heads began to look into it, and take it to
Pieces, the Parts all appear'd capable of Reduction into Form,
and the Presages of the Gentlemen who had so Banter'd it, ap∣pear'd
groundless, the Mass began to move, and every thing re∣tiring
to its proper place, guided by the Temper, Moderation,
and Application of the Commissioners, the Beautiful Thing, cal∣led
Union, began to shew it self, and the Nation began to con∣ceive
Hopes of its being perfected, in spight of all the seeming
Difficulties, with which the Enemies to the Design had clog'd
Mens Expectation—, as will appear hereafter.</P>
<P>To bring the Ballance of Circumstances upon the Stage, it was
absolutely necestary to enter into the several Inequalities, in which
the two Kingdoms then stood; These Inequalities, as they lay
particularly before the Treaters, consisted in Matters of Taxes,
Customs, Excises and Commerce.</P>
<P>In order to state these, the several Debts and Revenue of the
respective Nations were stated; Abstracts of which are annexed
to these Observations, as they were given in to the Commission∣ners
of both Kingdoms.</P>

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do agree, That all parts

and Duties for Export and Import; but in regard several of the
Funds relating to the Customs, are already appropriated for the
payment of Debts properly belonging to <HI>England,</HI> It's propos'd that
an Equivalent be allowed for them.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do also Agree, That all
the Subjects of the United Kingdom shall be lyable to equal Land
Taxes, or Taxes upon the Pound-rent, Providing the Proportion
for <HI>Scotland</HI> shall only be <HI>l.</HI> 12000, when one Shilling is impos'd on

apprehended something here too difficult to be Mastered,
and that would render all the rest Abortive.</P>
<P>The State of the Affairs of either Nation was in short thus,</P>
<P>1. <HI>England</HI> had very large Incomes or Revenues, and their
Customs and Excise brought in vast Sums, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Customs, 1341559 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></L>
<L>Excises, - 947602 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></L></Q>
<P>But, on the other Hand, <HI>England</HI> had vast Debts lay upon
them to discharge; and so the Discharge of which, these Re∣venues,
and almost all their other Taxes, the Land Tax and
Malt Tax excepted, were Appropriated.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Scotland</HI> had but small Revenues, her Customs and Excise
producing but the following Sums, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Customs let out in Tack or Farm from Year to
Year only at 30000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>The Excise, Farmed also, at 35000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>But then the Revenue of <HI>Scotland</HI> was entirely free from Anti∣cipations,
or Appropriations on any Account of Debt; Not,
but that there were Publick Debts too, but the Revenue was not
Charged with them.</P>
<P>Now, upon the Uniting the Revenues of both Kingdoms, under
these differing Circumstances, there were but two possible Me∣thods
that could be proposed;</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="140"/>
Either, 1. That each Kingdom coming to a full Point in
Matters of Revenue, should, like two Tradsmen coming
into Partnership, pay off their own respective Debts, and
bring in their several Proportions of Stock clear of all in∣cumberances.</P>
<P>Or, 2. That, putting the General Accounts of <HI>Debts</HI> and
Stock together, the <HI>English</HI> should make good the Ineqna∣lities
to the <HI>Scots</HI> some other way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners wisely proposed, for the Ease of
their own Country, That the Revenues of <HI>Scotland</HI> should not be
at all Chargeable with the <HI>English</HI> Debts—; And this was
thought to be a very good Argument, to Excuse <HI>Scotland</HI> from
some Duties, which, notwithstanding the General Article of pay∣ing
Equal Taxes, <HI>Scotland</HI> could by no means bear; Of these,
as they respect Customs or Excises, Foreign or Home Trade, I
shall speak as they come in Order.</P>
<P>But the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners adhering to the first Principle
of the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> Of its being an intire Incorporating Union,
were on that Account obliged to insist upon this also, which
formed afterward the Sixth Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That there be an E∣quality
of <HI>Customs,</HI> Excises, and all other Taxes thro'out the
United Kingdom, as that without which the Union could not
be entire.</P>
<P>This being laid down as a general <HI>Thesis</HI> in the whole Debate,
two things came in Course to be Examined as <HI>Mediums.</HI></P>
<P>1. A Scale of Proportions to form the Equalities.</P>
<P>2. An Equivalent to be given for supplying unavoidable In∣equalities.</P>
<P>And this will be found to run thro'the whole Series of the Trea∣ty,
as the Foundation of the whole; and however after Ridi∣cul'd
and Reflected on by the Opposers of the Treaty, it ap∣pears
to be the only Foundation they could have gone upon, and
which was the only <HI>Medium</HI> to bring the Treaty into a possibi∣lity
of coming to a happy Conclusion.</P>
<P>No Man could deny but all Equalities consisted in Proporti∣ons,
and to have extended the thing called Equality of Taxes, to
a Numerical Equality, as some pretend in <HI>England,</HI> was saying
nothing, the Customs, manner of Valuation of Land, and innu∣merable
Circumstances of <HI>Scotland,</HI> rendering it Impracticable.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Commissioners therefore when they insisted upon
an Equality of Taxes, readily agreed to the giving <HI>Scotland</HI> an
Equivalent for the payment of their own Debts, so far as their
Customs and Excises should come into the Appropriations of the
<HI>English</HI> Revenue.</P>
<P>What Alterations, <HI>Exceptions,</HI> and Abatements were made as
to Equalities of Taxes, will be spoken to in the Minutes of the
<HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, where the Exceptions were made, and those
Calculations Adjusted.</P>

<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> did take into their Con∣sideration
the Proposal offered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England
the 29th April,</HI> &amp; found it comprehended so many Particulars, That
they judg'd it most proper to answer it Point by Point; Accordingly
on the <HI>29th</HI> instant, they gave an Answer as to the Customs &amp; Land∣tax,
and did not mention any thing therein of the Excises, be∣cause
the Consideration of these was depending before the Com∣mittee
of the Commissioners of both sides; but to satisfie the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> That nothing shall be
wanting on the part of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> that
is necessary for the attaining an entire Union, they do agree to the
Equality of Excises on Ale, Beer, Mum, Cyder, Sweets, Perry,
Low-Wines, Aquavitae and Spirits; But they do propose an Ex∣emption
from all other Burthens and Excises within <HI>Scotland</HI> for a
competent Time, to be adjusted in the course of this Treaty, That
the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> may (by the benefit arising from the Com∣munication
of Trade) be put in a (apacity to bear a Proportion of
other Burthens and Excises, being willing at the Commencement of
the Union, to bear equal Excises on all that is Exported from <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
to <HI>England</HI> or the Plantations; And the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> do hope, that the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> will
be convinced that the Immunitie from these other Burthens and Ex∣cises
for a term of Years, is consistent with an entire Union, and
<PB N="34" REF="142"/>
will not put the Trade on an unequal Foot, when the present Cir∣cumstances
of both Kingdoms are duly considered.</P>
<P>And whereas the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> did, by their
Proposal, declare they were ready to agree to an Equivalent for
what <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be Taxed in towards the payment of the Debts
of <HI>England</HI> in all particulars whatsoever, the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> are ready to enter with their Lordships into the consi∣deration

Effect; They are willing to enter into the consideration of the par∣ticular
Excyses and Burthens Point by Point, which beingof several
Natures, so that they will require to be distinctly considered, The
Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> find it necessary to desire a little

THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> taking into considerati∣on

<P>II. The Duty on Births, Marriages and Burials, which being to
expire the first of <HI>August</HI> next, and therefore before the desireable
Union can take place. The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do
conceive it to be wholly Unnecessary to enter further into the
Consideration of that Duty.</P>
<P>III. The Duty payable on Windows and Lights till the first of

Exemption for some competent time, from all other Excises
and Burthens, than those already agreed to, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> since the last General
Meeting, have again considered the Proposition made by the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the <HI>29th April</HI> last, <HI>viz.</HI> That
there be the same Customs, Excises and all other Taxes; and the
same Prohibitions, Restrictions and Regulations of Trade thro'-out
the United Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with the Papers which have
been since delivered by the Commiissioners of both Kingdoms upon
that Subject, and do with great Satisfaction Observe, that the diffe∣rence,
as to that Important Proposal, is brought to a very narrow
Compass. And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> take this Oc∣casion
to Acknowledge the Sense they have of the Regard shown by
the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> for the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI>
after the desir'd Union; And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI>
having, by their several Proposals and An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wers, agreed to the same
Regulations of Trade, and to an Equality of Customs and Excises
upon all Exciseable <HI>Liquors,</HI> and a <HI>Quota</HI> of Land Tax, all to com∣mence
from the Union; As also to an Equality of all other Taxes
after some Years, They do conceive, that they have fully comply∣ed
with the said Proposal of the <HI>29th April,</HI> excepting only, that
they have propos'd an Exemption for sometime from all further
Burthens, than those expresly consented to, And as to the Exemp∣tion
desired, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Sctoland</HI> are very sen∣sible,
That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have not only,
by their Paper of the <HI>13th</HI> Instant, declared, That they were en∣clin'd
to consent in General to an Exemption of Excises and Bur∣thens,
as proposed in such Cases, where it might be done, with∣out
prejudice to the Trade and Manufactures of <HI>England;</HI> But
that, in pursuance of that Good Disposition. Their Lordships,
by their Paper the 15<HI>th</HI> Instant, have consented to an Exemption
<PB N="37" REF="145"/>
in Favour of the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the several Duties, and
for the particular Terms therein mentioned, whereby the Immuni∣ty
desired is so far Granted; But the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
from their Consideration of the present Circumstances of that
Kingdom, find themselves under a Necessity to renew their Proposal
of a General Exemption, for some competent time, from all other
Excises and Burthens, Besides those great Duties and Taxes already
consented to, That the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> may, by the Benefite of
Trade, be enabled Cheerfully to bear an Equality of all other Bur∣thens,
which will greatly Advance a firm Union and Coalition of
Affection and Interest betwixt the two Kingdoms.</P>

<HEAD>OVERVATION V.</HEAD>
<P>”The Commissioners were now entered upon the great Enqui∣ry
about Equalities, and the first Matter relating to Taxes was
that of the Land Tax; The Land Tax in <HI>England</HI> was a For∣midable
Thing, being called a Tax of Four Shillings in the
Pound of the Rent of Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the People who were
Fond of Throwing a Tangled Skein in the Hands of the Treat∣ers,
that might Shock them at the beginning, would have gone
upon that Foot, alledging, That tho' the Rents in <HI>Scotland</HI>
were dissering from those in <HI>England;</HI> yet that 20 <HI>sh.sterl.</HI> Re∣venue
being the same thing any where, it could as well afford
to pay 4 <HI>sh.</HI> out of it in <HI>Scotland</HI> as any where else; and upon
this Foot, it seems, were for bringing the Rents of Land in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
to a true Estimate, and so they would call this way of
Taxing an Equality.</P>
<P>“But to this it was Answer'd, <HI>First,</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> way of
Collecting their Taxes, being rigorous and exact, if 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI>
were laid by Parliament upon the whole Island, their Assess∣ments
would <HI>bona fide</HI> be 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> upon the Rack Rent of all
their Lands.</P>
<P>“Whereas 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> in <HI>England</HI> never puts the Assessors out of
their old Road, but every County being Rated in the very Bo∣dy
of the Act, the Title is <HI>Ipso Facto</HI> Repeal'd, since if the
Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of that Country will raise the Money by an Assess∣ment
of I <HI>s.</HI> 6 d. <HI>per</HI> Pound, and 'tis known some do for less,
the Law is satisfied, and the End answered.</P>
<P>“Now to Tax <HI>Scotland</HI> at 4 <HI>s. per I.</HI> upon her Nett Rent, and
Tax the Northern and Western Counties of <HI>England</HI> but at so
much Money, which they can raise by a Proportion of 16 <HI>d.</HI> to
20 <HI>d.</HI> at most <HI>per I.</HI> would be unreasonable.</P>
<P>“So that it was plain, <HI>Scotland</HI> could not be Taxed at a
Pound Rate, but at a Proportioned Summ, leaving them to
the Division of it, to raise it as they see fit.</P>
<P>“II. The Sum charg'd upon Lands in <HI>England,</HI> after it is le∣vied
and raised from the Tenant, stands charg'd with large De∣ductions
<PB N="38" REF="146"/>
and Charges, upon the Levying, Collecting, and Re∣ceiving;
and those Charges, if some Calculations are right,
amount to little less than 9 <HI>d. per I.</HI> upon the Money receiv'd,
besides publick Losses by the Insolvency of Receivers and their
Securities, which oftentimes runs deep into the Money; and
which tho' they cannot be brought into an exact Account, yet
put all together, 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound may at least very well be
Charg'd upon the whole, as an Off-Reckoning or Discount-up∣on
the Money, between the Collection and Exchequer.</P>
<P>This 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound upon the Money Collected is 2 <HI>d.</HI> 8/20 <HI>per</HI>
Pound upon all the Rents in <HI>England,</HI> and amounts in every
Land Tax to near a Hundred Thousand Pound <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>“Now as on the other hand, the <HI>Scots</HI> Collect all their Tax at
their own Charges, clear of all Losses, Deficiencies or Defalca∣tions,
and pay it in Nett to the Exchequer or Publick Trea∣sure,
to Charge them by the same Numerical Equality with <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
would be to make them pay their Taxes clear of Charge,
and bear part of the Experence and Loss in Collecting ours.</P>
<P>“III. <HI>Differing</HI> Customs and Manners of paying Rent, and
letting out Lands in the two Kingdoms, make a Numerical
Equality Impracticable.</P>
<P>“In <HI>England</HI> the Rents are paid in Mony, in <HI>Scotland</HI> they are,
generally speaking, paid in Kind, or Victual, as they call it:
Now tho' 'tis true this may, and is, in some respect, brought
to a Head by a General Valuation, yet, with this Difference,
against a <HI>Scots</HI> Landlord to an <HI>English, viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Land∣lord
stays two Terms, and runs two Risques in his receiving the
Rent of his Land.</P>
<P>“First he stays the Term agreed to receive of his Tenant, and
secondly he trusts the Merchant a second Term, to whom he sells
the Produce he receives of his Tenant; in the same Sense he
runs two Hazards; one in the Solvency of the Tenant, and the
other of the Merchant; which makes a considerable Difference
in the Essential Value of the Rent, and consequently of the Pur∣chase
of such an Estate; and tho' the Purchase or Real Va∣lue
of Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI> may not come into this Dispute; yet
were an Estate let in <HI>England</HI> to pay the Rent in Kind, it would
sell for much less than an Estate of the same Value paid in Spe∣cie:
Nor would it be Tax'd at near so much in our Commo
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>“IV. The Difference in letting Lands in <HI>England,</HI> which are
in many Places fin'd down, and the stated Rents reduc'd, makes
another Variation: Whereas in <HI>Scotland</HI> Lands are let without
Leates, or but on short Terms, and at a Rack Rent; any Man
that knows what belongs to Letting or Taking Lands in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
cannot be ignorant—, That the Landlord, letting a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Leafe to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nant, Consining him to such and such Im∣provement,
makes frequent Considerations in the Rent, and so
the Land being Taxed by the Rent, is Taxed under the Value.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="147"/>
“On the other hand, should this Article of 4 <HI>s. per I.</HI> be insist∣ed
on in the literal Sence, and the <HI>Scots</HI> come to consider how
to avoid it, by Fining down Rents and other Advantageous
Methods, which they may easily find out, they might soon e∣vade
the Act, and pay little or nothing; and this would be
an Evil hard to discover; and if found out, almost impossible
to cure.</P>
<P>“From these Reasons it was plain, a Numerical or Arithmetical
Equality could not be the Foundation of those Debates—; But
as it was very well Stiled, it behoved to be a Geometrical
Equality, founded on a Scale of Proportions, and that Scale for∣med
upon due Considerations, not of real Value only, but of
Circumstances and Prospects of either Kingdom.</P>
<P>“A second Calculate was then proposed from the Proportion
which <HI>Scotland</HI> was oblig'd to pay under <HI>Oliver <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>romwel,</HI> who
having reduc'd <HI>Scotland</HI> by Arms, Incorporated them into one
Body with this Nation; and by this Incorporation they were
Rated at 6000 <HI>I. per</HI> Month in their Land Tax, when <HI>England</HI>
was Rated at 70000 <HI>I. per</HI> Month.</P>
<P>“It also appears by the same Calculation, that <HI>Scotland</HI> paid
this 6000 <HI>I. per</HI> Month, when <HI>England</HI> paid but 35000 <HI>l. per</HI>
Month.</P>
<P>“Now to apply this Calculation to the present case, the Land
Tax in <HI>England</HI> in time of War, at 4 <HI>s. per I.</HI> is suppos'd to raise
two Millions <HI>sterling.</HI></P>
<P>“The <HI>Scots</HI> paying 60000 to <HI>Englands 35000 per</HI> Month, which is
something sess than a sixth part; By the same Rule in two Mil∣lions
<HI>per annum,</HI> which the said Land Tax raises, they must be
chargeable with 333333.6. 8. <HI>per Annum,</HI> Land Tax.</P>
<P>“But this Arbitrary difference which <HI>Oliver <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>romwel</HI> and his
Parliament made, as is observ'd, was, <HI>In consideration that</HI> Eng∣land
<HI>had, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivers years past, been at almost all the Expence of</HI>
War; Yet still, at the former Calculation, <HI>Scotland</HI> would in a

to One Million, Six Hundred, Sixty Six thousand, Six Hundred,
Sixty Six Pound, Thirteen and Four Pence Sterling, <HI>per Annum,</HI>
and by the last Calculation just half the Money.</P>
<P>“Both which Sums it was alleged are far wide of an Equality,

why these Calculations were made, and have the Arguments
preserved for their use, if it be Disputed hereafter, why <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
should pay so small a Proportion in the Land Taxes or four
Shilling Aid, and which may help others to Defend <HI>Scotland</HI>
against future Attempts, to enlarge their Expences.</P>
<P>“The next thing was to Examine what was, or what might
be counted a due Equality; and here it will be necessary to enter
<PB N="40" REF="148"/>
a little into the short History of Taxes in <HI>Scotland,</HI> since the Re∣storation;
which, bringing it down to the present Time, may
serve as a Rule to this Matter.</P>
<P>“Anciently the levying Money upon Land in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was
called in General <HI>the Taxation;</HI> and the manner of levying it
was by Rules altogether obsolete and now grown out of Use, as
the Custom of Tenths, Fifteenths, Subsidies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“The now Method of Taxing Land has its beginning, as to
Practice, in the Assessment of 6000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month, settled in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
in <HI>Cromwel's</HI> time, when an Union was actually form'd and
settled between the Nations; of which, however deficient in it
self, without doubt this may be said, that it had in it the Essen∣tial
Parts, and might be modell'd into a compleat Coalition.</P>
<P>“This is the Tax they now go by in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is called
there THE CESS, by which is understood <HI>a Month's Assessment;</HI>
'tis raised upon Land by a Method peculiarly exact, and I have
never heard any one complain of the Inequality.</P>
<P>“'Tis raised, as is before noted, without any Charge, Deducti∣on,
or Desalcation, and is paid <HI>Nett</HI> into the Treasury.</P>
<P>“According as the Occasions of the Government require, this
Tax is encreased; but then not the Sum <HI>per</HI> Month is encreased,
but the number of Months are encreased, which by the help of
time encreases the Sum.</P>
<P>“The Original of the Demand was as before, and of the Me∣thod,
but the Continuance of it was thus introduced;</P>
<P>“In former times, the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> contented themselves
with the ancient Demesnes, Crown-Lands, Customs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
on extraordinary Cases <HI>the Taxation, as above,</HI> was their Supply,
Excises of any sort were altogether unknown, till the Days of
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>“King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second in the Year 1661, obtained of the
<HI>Scots</HI> to give him a settled Sum of 40000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling during his
Life, in consideration whereof, he promised never to demand
any Cess or <HI>Taxation,</HI> except in time of War, as by the Words of

<P>The Estates of Parliament taking to their Consideration the great Hap∣piness
this Kingdom hath enjoy'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that the Kings Majesty
hath been graciously pleas'd, notwithstanding all the Provocations
given to himself and his Royal Father, to evidence his Affection and
Favour to this his antient Kindom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do with all humble Duty
acknowledge his Majesties unparallel'd Grace and Goodness, <HI>&amp;c..</HI></P>
<P>And seeing for the due Establishment of his Majesties Authority,
and settling and securing the Peace of the Kingdom, his Majesty may
have occasion to raise and keep some Forces within this Kindgom, and
his Majesty has signified his Resolution, not to raise any more Cess.
Therefore and from the due Sense of their Duty and Obligations, the
Estates of Parliament do in the Name of the Kingdom make an hum∣ble
and chearful Offer to his Majesty, of a yearly Annuity of 40000 l.
Sterl. during all the Days of his Majesties Life time.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="149"/>

Importations, and 32000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> on Malt, brewed
into Liquor for Sale; but as this was a Novelty and uncertain
in its Produce, a Cess was granted to make good the Deficiency,
which Deficiency generally amounted to a Months Cess more
or less, and other Cess than this <HI>Scotland</HI> knew none till the
Convention 1666, which being a Time of War, a Cess was
imposed, but not exceeding 3 Months.</P>
<P>“Here it may be observ'd, That in these times the Excises and

Price to oblige the Sovereign in giving up their Priviledges and
Liberties to be trampled on by Arbitrary Designs. The
first Fruits of this Courting the Prince, appear'd in that they
brought a Tax 5 Months Cess upon the Country, to be continued

<HEAD>12th Act of Parliament, Jan, 7.</HEAD>
<P>The Estates of Parliament calling to mind the many great Blessings
they have, and do enjoy under the Protection of the Royal Go∣vernment,
and especially by the many Deliverances from the re∣bellions
Insurrections and Designs of Fanatical Traytors; from
whom they could expect no less than Confusion in Religion, Op∣pression,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that the Terror of his Majesties Forces hathbeen
very instrumental for procuring our present Security, but considering,
that not only these Enemies continne their inveterate Hatred against
King and People; but that their frequent Disappointments have
heightn'd their Malice to Despair, and that the present Forces
may be too few to undergoe all the Fatigue which his Majesties
Service, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may require, and to demonstrate to all seditious men,
that this Nation is resolved to bestow all they have in the Kings
service, rather than to bear the least of their Insults; Do there∣fore,
for themselves and the Nation represented by them, make 4
hearty and dutiful Offer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Over and above the 5 Months
already imposed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Where by there will be 4 Months Cess
payable at each Term hearafter, and as a farther Evidence of their
entire Affection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they humbly and heartily offer a Continua∣tion
of the said 4 Months Cess, <HI>TERMLY,</HI> during all the Terms
of his Majesties Life time, which God Almighty long preserve.</P>
<P>“In this Taxation or Cess the several Court Parties struggled,
who should give their Country away fastest, the Bishops got in∣to
every part of the Civil Jurisdiction; the Severities against
the People first drove them into Desparations and Rebellions,
and then such Advantages were taken, and such use made of
the said Insurrections to ruine others, that the poor People were
brought to the Brink of general Ruinethe: Nation being brought
to that pass, that a Man might be sin'd or <HI>for faulted;</HI> that is, his
Estate taken from him, for his Wives giving a Half-penny at his
Door to a common Beggar, on pretence it was relieving a Rebel</P>
<P>“Thus poor <HI>Scotland</HI> was bought and sold, and the Example is
useful for our Observation a great many ways; for thus shall
every Nation be used, that is divided into contending Parties
and expos'd to an encroaching Government.</P>
<P>“But that I may not have said all this foreign to the presem
Purpose, it is very observable, and this is the Reason of the <HI>Quo∣tation,</HI>
that this will make one PERIOD for Taxation, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<PB N="43" REF="151"/>
highest that an Arbitrary Prince back'd with a Mercenary Nobi∣lity,
and a Governing Clergy, even in the greatest Extream of
Absolute Tyranny, ever impos'd upon this Nation, which at
that time 'tis evident they desir'd to squeeze, and car'd not if
they entirely ruin'd.</P>
<P>“Come we now to the Revolution, which these Exorbitances
had no little Influence upon; the first thing Transacted upon
the Meeting of the Estates or Convention of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was to
break these Chains; re-assume the Power of raising Taxes by
Parliament, and make themselves Judges both of the Occasion,
and of the Sum.</P>
<P>“However as in <HI>England</HI> since the Revolution, greater Occasions
have call'd for immense Sums to carry on the War; and
such Taxes have been rais'd as were never heard of before; so
in <HI>Scotland</HI> the Parliament have agreed to such Taxes, as, the
aforesaid Time of Tyranny excepted, were never known in
<HI>Scotland</HI> before.</P>
<P>“Yet, in the carrying on this War, six or seven Months Cess,
has, one time with another, been thought <HI>Scotland's</HI> full Pro∣portion,
and the late KING, excepting one or two Years on ex∣traordinary
Occasions, always contented himself with it, and
this at the same time that <HI>England</HI> rais'd 4 <HI>s. per I.</HI> upon their
Land; Nor did Queen <HI>Anne</HI> ever demand more of her Subjects
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' the Weight of the War was as great as ever,
and this was called another PERIOD of Taxation.</P>
<P>“Now, what was mean't by a Geometrical Scale, or Equali∣ty
in Taxes, is drawn from these Proportions.</P>
<P>“That, since exact Valuation of Rents cannot be made on both
sides, and least of all in <HI>England,</HI> it seems as good a way to
come at this Equality, as any could be proposed.</P>
<P>“That the highest Period of Taxes that ever <HI>Scotland</HI> bore
since the Restoration, may be taken on one hand, and set a∣gainst
the highest Period of Taxes that ever <HI>England</HI> bore, <HI>that
is,</HI> of a Land Tax on both sides; and put these together as
the Scale of Equality.</P>
<P>“Thus suppose the <HI>Scots</HI> 8 Months Cess, tho' that was the
heighth of Tyrannick Imposition, and tho' 'tis allowed the <HI>Scots</HI>
are manifestly impoverish'd, and less able to bear it than they
were; yet say, it be full 8 Months Cess, and set this
against the <HI>English 4. s. per I.</HI> it could not be found, that any
more just Calculation could be made; And the Proportion
seem'd so clear, that every side appeared content with it.</P>
<P>“Thus when ever a Tax upon Land for 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound is grant∣ed,
the <HI>Scots</HI> pay 8 Months Cess, if of 2 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
4 Months Cess, and so in Proportion.</P>
<P>“There were other Calculations offered about that time, but
none seemed so rationally and so exactly stated to the Circum∣stances
of the Nations, or built on so just a Foundation; and
therefore it met with less Difficulty than was expected, as will
appear hereafter.</P>

<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> on the <HI>9th</HI> instant, pro∣posed
a Quota of a Land Tax, and agreed to the same Regulations
of Trade, and to an Equality of Customs; and on the 13th agreed
to an Equality of Excises on all Exciseable Liquors; but, at the
same time, their Lordships propos'd an Exemption from all other
Burthens and Excises, for a competent time.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> did the same Day return
Answer, That their Lordships would enter into the Consideration of
the particular Excises and Burthens, Point by Point, and on the
15th Instant did return their Answer distinctly, to the particular
Excises and Burthens payable by virtue of several Acts of Par∣liament
in <HI>England,</HI> in such manner, as their Lordships had reason
to hope, would have been to the entire Satisfaction of the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>Scotland;</HI> But the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
finding, by the Paper delivered in on the 17th Instant by the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> that tho' they do take notice of
the said Answer of the 15th; yet their Lordships have thought fit
to renew their Proposal of a general Exemption for some competent
time, from all other Excises and Burthens, besides these their Lord.
ships had already consented to: The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
did understand that Proposal of the 13th, to extend only to
such other Burthens and Excises, as are now subsisting in <HI>England,</HI>
to every one of which their Lordships think they have given a full
and distinct Answer; and if it shall appear, that any Particulars have
been omitted in that Answer, the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI>
will enter into the Consideration of them, and return their Opinion
thereupon; But if the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> would ex∣tend
their Proposal of the 13th to an Exemption from all Burthens
and Excises, which the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> may hereafter
find necessary to Impose on the United Kingdom; The Lords Com∣missioners
for <HI>England</HI> are of Opinion, that it cannot be suppos'd,
the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will ever lay any sort of Burthens up∣on
the United Kingdom, but what they shall find of necessiry at that
time, for the Preservation and Good of the whole, and with due Re∣gard
to the Circumstances and Abilities of every part of the United

the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> would take into their Conside∣ration,
the several Particulars in that Paper delivered to them by the
Lords Commissioners for England on the 15th Instant, and return

<HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver'd to the Board their Lordships Answer to the Papers
deliver'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the 15th and 18th
Instant, which was Read.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> have taken into their
Consideration, the Papers delivered by the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>England</HI> on the 15th and 18th Instant, and do understand that
the First contains all the several kind of Burthens and Excises now
in use in <HI>England,</HI> besides those to which the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> have already agreed.</P>
<P>And as to the several particulars contain'd in the said Papers.</P>
<P>1. As to Duties on Stampt Paper, Vellom and Parchment, seing
the Exemption from that Imposition can have no Influence on Trade
or Manufacturies, and that the said Duty does affect the Securities
of the Subjects Estates, adding like wise a new Condition, which
being omitted may make their Rights and Titles void: And further
considering, that the said Duty will be uneasie to the People,
chargeable in collecting, and of small value; The Lords Commis∣sioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be
wholly exempted from the same, or at least that the Exemption from
the said Duties, agreed to by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI>
in the said Paper of the 15th Instant, be prolong'd beyond the Year
1710, to a certain Period, as to that Moiety which is imposed for
Perpetuity.</P>
<P>2. As to the other particular Duties which expire in the Year 1710
or sooner, from which the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have
agreed, that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be exempted: The Lords
Commissioners for Scotland do understand, that it was the Meaning
of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> to extend that Exemption
to the Duty laid on Cynders.</P>
<P>3. As to the Duty on Salt; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI>
having consented, that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall, for a compe∣tent
time after the Union, remain Exempted from the payment of
that Duty, for all Salt spent in kind, or used in Provisions, within
the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> provided that the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> should propose effectual Methods for securing, that the
like Duties as are now payable in <HI>England,</HI> be Paid and Collected
in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, as to all Salt Exported
from that Kingdom, either in Kind or Provisions: The Lords Com∣missioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> have herewith given in a Scheme of such Re∣gulations
as have occurr'd to them, for securing, that the Duty pro∣pos'd
be collected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to all Salt Exported from: that
Kingdom in Kind or Provisions, and are willing to agree to what
other Methods shall be propos'd on that behalf by the Lords Com∣missioners
for <HI>England;</HI> And their Lordships are ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
with the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> on the Consideration of
the time to which the said Exemption shall be limited; And the
<PB N="46" REF="154"/>
Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> doubt not, but as the Lords Com∣missioners
for <HI>England</HI> have agreed to the Exemption propos'd from
all Burthens or Excises now in use, but those consented to by the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>England</HI> will also agree, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> remain Ex∣empted
from any Duties (except these agreed to) which may be
laid on by the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> before the Union.</P>
<P>AND as to the General Exemption formerly propos'd on the part
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from all other Burthens than those consented to for a com∣petent
time. The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> considering
what the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have observ'd, that it
cannot be suppos'd the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will ever lay
any sort of Burthens upon the United Kingdom, but what they
shall find of necessity at that time, for the Preservation and Good
of the whole, and with due Regard to the Circumstances and Abili∣ties
of every part of the United Kingdom. therefore the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to avoid the <HI>Difficulty</HI> that may arise
in that Matter, do agree, not to insist further at present, but to
leave the Continuation of the said Exemption to be determin'd by
the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI></P>
<P>AND the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having, by this and
their former Papers, Answer'd the Proposal made by the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 29th <HI>April,</HI> concerning the Equa∣lity
of Taxes, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> take this oc∣casion
to put the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> in mind of a Pro∣posal
given in to their Lordships the 9th Instant, concerning the
<HI>Quota</HI> of Land Tax for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> not doubting, but
that the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> will agree to the same.</P>
<P>THE Lord Chancellor did also, in Name of the Lords Commis∣sioners
for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver to the Board the following Proposal,
which was read.</P>
<P>PROPOSAL for the effectual preventing the Exportation of <HI>Scots</HI>
Salt to <HI>England,</HI> or the Plantations, without paying the same Ex∣cises,
with which <HI>English</HI> Salt is charg'd, during the Exemption al∣lowed
to <HI>Scotland</HI> from the said Duty.</P>
<P>1. THAT no Salt be Trasperted from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by
Land, under the Penalty of Forseiting the Salt and the Horses used
in Transporting it, and pay ten Shillings for every Bushel of Salt so
Transported, for which the Carrier, as well as the Owner, shall be
lyable Conjunctly and Severally, and the Carriers to be Imprison'd
until the said Penalty be paid.</P>
<P>2. That all Salt Water-born be enter'd at a Custom Office, and
that before Shipping there be a Report made, expressing to what
Port the Ship or Vessel is bound, and if bound to any Port within
<HI>Scotland,</HI> there shall be sufficient Security given for the Duty payable
in six Moneths, with this condition, that in case a Certificate be re∣turned
from the Collector or Collectors where the Ship or Vestel is
bound, that the same Quantity was truly and without Fraud found
Loaded at the saids Port or Ports, reasonable Allowance being made
<PB N="47" REF="155"/>
for Waste since the Embarkation; Then and in that Case the Bond
for the Duty to be come void: And in case the Ship or Vessel be
bound for <HI>England</HI> or the Plantations, The Excise or Duty chargeable
on the like Salt in <HI>England</HI> shall be presently paid in Money, and a
Transire or Certificate Subscribed by the Collector, expressing the
quantity of Salt Enter'd and the Duty paid; and if any Ship or Vessel
Load Salt on Board, and Export the same without duly Reporting,
Entring and carrying the said Transire or Certificate along with him,
to be produced at the Port of Discharge; The Ship or Vessel unload∣ing
shall be confiscated, and the Master Imprison'd for three Months,
and in case of any Fraud or Connivance in the Collector or other Of∣ficers
of the Custom-house, the said Collector or other Officer shall be
Iyable to pay a years Sallary, and be deprived of his Office.</P>
<P>3. As to Provisions; All Fishes and Flesh Barrel'd for Exportation,
are appointed to be Packt and Cured with Forreign Salt without any
Mixture of <HI>Scotch</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Salt, by the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which
Forreign Salt falls under the Regulation of Forreign Trade, and
there are no other valuable Provisions that can be Imported from
<HI>Scotland;</HI> and the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are willing to
agree to any further Proposal that shall be made for preventing Fraud,
in Importing <HI>Scotch</HI> Salt or salted Provisions.</P>

these had sundry Difficulties.</P>
<P>“Some were grievous to <HI>Scotland</HI> with respect to their Magni∣tude

pay the same Sums with <HI>England,</HI> but that it must be reduced to
a proportioned Equality as in the Land Tax, and this respected
the Excise and several Branches of the Customs.</P>
<P>“Others were grievous to <HI>Scotland</HI> in the kind, and were thought
Impracticable, at least for a time, the Trade, Poverty, and other
Circumstances of <HI>Scotland</HI> not admitting them, these were the
Tax upon Malt, and the Excise, or Duty on Salt.</P>
<P>“Others again were such as were altogether Impracticable, as
having none of the Materials to work on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or such as
could not rationally be expected from them, such as the Taxes
upon Coals, Culm, Hawkers and Pedlars, Hakney-Coach-Men,
Births, Burials, and Marriages, Glass-Windows, Stampt-Paper,
and the like.</P>
<P>“In the beginning of the Debate on these Heads, the Equality
of Customs, Export and Import, with the same Restrictions and
Regulations of Trade was Agreed to by the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners;
for the necessity of Commerce made it plain, there could be no
adjusting Trade without that. An open free uninterrupted Com∣merce
by Land being the Consequence of an Union, they would
otherwise ruine the <HI>English</HI> Trade, by supplying the <HI>English</HI> Markets
with all sorts of Imported Goods, cheaperthan the <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chants
could do; and this would be a most destructive Article in
Trade, especially in fine Goods. For Example, in Linens from <HI>Ham∣borough</HI>
or <HI>Holland,</HI> or in Tobacco, Coffee, Tea, Chacolate, and
such other things as were then under large Duty and small Car∣riage;
these would all be spread over <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and
make unspeakable Confusions in Trade.</P>
<P>“It was the sooner concluded therefore, that the Customs, Pro∣hibitions,
and Charges of all foreign Importations, must be nu∣merically
and literally the same in both Nations. But as the
<HI>English</HI> Customs were already Impropriated to pay the <HI>English</HI>
Debts, and the <HI>Scots</HI> had before proposed, that neither Kingdom
be burthened with the Debts of the other Contracted before the
Union; this Equality was found very difficult; and next to
Impracticable, and this brought on the affair of an Equivalent;
of which hereafter.</P>
<P>“This now run thro' all the Heads of Taxes, for there remained
no Question, but that an Equivalent was a full Compensation for
any Difficulty proposed; and yet the settling an Equivalent here
seem'd no Satisfaction. It was alleged an Equivalent was a Na∣tional
Satisfaction indeed, but not a personal, that it could
not relieve the particular People in Oppressed, no, nor make
good the Damage of the particular Trade it would injure; and
<PB N="49" REF="157"/>
therefore the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners strove hard to avoid the Taxes
wholly, rather than to come into them tho' with an Equiva∣lent—,
but it was not to be done; there could be no other
Method that could make both sides equally Easy.</P>
<P>“After this had therefore been long Discours'd, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners
came in to the Article of Equality of Excites on Liquors, &amp; the
Customs on Exported and Imported Goods, the Debate of what
that Equality was did not ly before them, but seem'd referr'd on
both sides to the respective Parliaments, and there we shall meet
with it again at large.</P>
<P>“The Customs &amp; Excises on Liquors being thus settled, the <HI>Scots</HI>
Commissioners Excepted against: all other Excises be Burthens, and
insisted upon it as a Thing <HI>Scotland</HI> was not then in a Condition
to come into, at least for the present, as you see it expressed in the
Minuts of <HI>May</HI> 13. And it is observable the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners
made this Proposal with a great deal of Candor and Regard to
the <HI>English,</HI> as appears by their obviating the Objection which
they knew would be made of the Carrying Salt and Malt into <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
for it was the particular Duties on Salt and Malt which
they had an Eye to in this Proposal, in which they desired Ex∣emption
for so much only as should be consumed in <HI>Scotland.</HI> ”</P>
<P>“Upon this occasion the Committee was appointed to Examine
and State the Nature of the Equivalent, and on which particu∣lar
Articles it was to be allowed; And as this was doing, the
Commissioners in their Meetings went upon the particular Points
of Excises, or Taxes which were to be objected against.”</P>
<P>“The Stampt Paper, the Birth, Burials, Window?, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were
without much Difficulty conceded to the <HI>Scots;</HI> for as the Cir∣cumstances
of those Duties made them improper, so the Stampt
Duties could not have been extended to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Methods
and Customs of which would have made it Impracticable in some
Cases, and Intolerable in others.</P>
<P>“The Duties on Coals, Culm, and Cinders, also occasioned very
small Debates, the <HI>Scots</HI> being no othr wise Exempted from those
Duties, than a great part of <HI>England</HI> is, who pay no Duty for all
their River-born Coals; and the Quantity of Coals carried by
Sea in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is so very small as not to deserve any notice;
Howbeit all the Coal Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Scots</HI> Coal Ex∣pended
in <HI>England,</HI> paysas in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“The Births and Burial Act expired, and having been grievous
`in <HI>England,</HI> it was not probable it should be Renewed.</P>
<P>“The Hakney-Coach-Mens Act could not concern <HI>Scotland,</HI> there
'being so few Hakney-Coaches in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as not to make
it worth notice.</P>
<P>“The Malt and Salt Tax occasioned the greatest Debate, the
Circumstances of <HI>Scotland</HI> were argued, tho' with great Modesty
and Decency, on either side; and the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners
were soon made sensible, That, in the present Circumstances of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> those Duties could not be born there.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="158"/>
“And indeed they would have been intolerable to the Poor,
`and not only as to the Magnitude, but as the manner of Taxing
them had been particularly Oppressive to the Scots in their
Trade.</P>
<P>“1. Because they are Exorbitant in their Rate, being Charg'd
`not upon the Value, but upon the Bulk of the Commodity; and
the Goods bearing so different a Value in <HI>Scotland</HI> and in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
to put the Duty equal, would be to Tax the <HI>Scots</HI> in three
times the Sum they are Tax'd at in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“For Example, the Duty upon Salt is charg'd by Weight in
general, and this being Calculated in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would amount
to 16 s 4 <HI>d.</HI> Sterling, upon 3 <HI>s.</HI> value, and in <HI>England</HI> to but
16 <HI>s. 4 d.</HI> Sterling, upon 10 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI> Value, or thereabout; let
any Man state the Proportion, here they will easily allow the
Tax to be intolerable to the <HI>Scots;</HI> since by the same Proporti∣on
the <HI>English</HI> ought to pay 1 <HI>l. 17 s. 4 d.</HI> for the same quantity
of Salt, or the <HI>Scots</HI> ought to pay but 4 <HI>s. 8 d.</HI> for that which by
this Tax is rated at 16 <HI>s. 4 d.</HI> and the like, tho not in so great
a Difference, for the Malt.</P>
<P>“2. Ths Weight of the Salt Tax lyes especially on the Poor,
who in <HI>Scotland</HI> live very much on Salt Meats, and whose dif∣fering
Condition from the <HI>English</HI> does not permir, nor cannot
bear being Tax'd at all, much less equal to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>“These Arguments brought the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners to agree
to an Exemption for a time, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners insisted
upon an Exemption to perpetuity, but the Answer of the <HI>English</HI>
Commissioners stated in the Minuts of the <HI>13th May</HI> is very
clear, and obliged the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners to Acquiesce.</P>
<P>“For it could not be thought reasonable to tye up the Hands
of the United Kingdom for ever, not to lay on such Duties or
Taxes as the Circumstances of Trade and of the Nation, might
make reasonable.</P>
<P>“The Treaters on both sides therefore Acquiesced in the Ex∣emption
from the other several Duties during the respective
Terms they were given for; leaving the Consideration of further
Exemptions to the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, what Alteration this part
received, and upon what Consideration in the Parliament ensu∣ing
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall appear in its place—.</P>
<P>“There was an Objection offered here about what Duties might
be laid on by the very next Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> which being
to fit almost at the same time with the Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and consequeutly before the Union could Commence, might
alter the state of the present Duties; And so the Conclusions
might be all to be made over again.</P>
<P>“But this was after some Debate Regulated as <HI>per</HI> the Minuts
by obliging <HI>Scotland</HI> to raise her part of the Charge of the Year
1707, as usual, and <HI>England</HI> her part, each separately and a part,
and the several Duties and Funds mentioned, were to remain
just as they stood at the time of the Treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="159"/>
“This, and the <HI>Quota</HI> of Land-Tax being brought in together,
was readily Agreed to on both sides.</P>
<P>“And thus this great Difficulty, which was thought the most
dangerous in the whole Treaty, was brought into a very narrow
Compass; For the Business was now, only to state the matter of
the Equivalent, what it should be, and how to be disposed.</P>
<P>“What it should be, admitted no long Debate; For, as it
was a payment of Money, nothing but Money could be an E∣quivalent
to it.</P>
<P>“How much it was to be, depended upon Matter of Fact, and
was reserv'd to exact Calculation from the Foot of the Customs
and Excise.</P>
<P>“As to the manner how it should be disposed, the Commis∣soners
did not adjust it at all, save in Generals, of which here∣after
in its Course.</P>
<P>“It has been objected indeed, as an Omission in the Commis∣sioners,
That they did not adjust the Application of the Equi∣valent
in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But their Reasons were, 1. Because they
had a Respect to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> were to come
after them, and who perhaps might enter farther into that part,
and indeed might claim a tvight exclusive of all others to dis∣pose
of it.</P>
<P>“2. They were not willing to enter upon a thing, in which
the Determination of Properties might be entangled, conceiv∣ing
it did not ly before them to conclude private Interests, or
exclude any, <HI>as they might have done,</HI> who had Reason to claim
upon old Debts, some in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time, and some in
King <HI>Charles'</HI> s Time, and the like.</P>
<P>“3. It was thought, this might raise Objections against the
Union in People, who, being byass'd by their Interest, would
oppose the General Interest on their own particular Accounts.</P>
<P>“It was now that the Union appear'd hopeful, and People be∣gan
to be surprized at the Success; The Queen Her self, pleas∣ed
with the Prospect, came to the Meeting, and hearing the
Minuts Read, Expresied an Extraordinary Satisfaction in the
Steps taken by the Commissioners, and the Hopes conceived of
bringing this Great Matter to a Happy Conclusion.</P>

<P>The Lord Keeper, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
deliver'd to the Board ihc followng Answer to the Paper de∣livered
by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> the a 21<HI>st</HI> Instant,
which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> having considered the
Papers deliver'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the
21<HI>st</HI> Elnstant, and being desirous to remove all Difficulties in this
Treaty, return this Answer.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="160"/>
That whereas the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have already
consented, That the Kingdom of Scotland be exempted from the
whole Duty on stampt Paper, Vellom and Parchment till the 1<HI>st</HI> of
<HI>August</HI> 1710, at which time one pare thereof expires; The Lords
Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do now cousent, That the Kingdom of
<HI>Scotland</HI> shall not be charged with the other part of that Duty dur∣ing
the continuance of that Duty by any Act now in Force.</P>
<P>And do Agree, It was and is the Intent of the Lords Commissio∣ners
for <HI>England,</HI> That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be exempted from
the payment of the Duty laid on Cynders, in such manner as the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have before agreed. That the
Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be exempted from the payment of the Duty on
Coal and Culm.</P>
<P>And as to the Scheme proposed by the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>Scotland,</HI> for securing. that the Duty on Salt now payable in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
be collected in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, as to all Salt export∣ed
from that Kingdom in Kind, or Provisions; The Lords Commis∣sioners
for <HI>England</HI> have thought it necessary to receive some Infor∣mation
concerning that Matter, from the Officers principally concern'd
in the Management of that Duty; and until the Lords Commissio∣ners
for <HI>England</HI> can be satissyed concerning the Sufficiency of these
or other Methods for the end propos'd, They conceive they cannot
properly enter with the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> on the
Considerarion of the time, to which the Exemption of <HI>Scotland</HI>
from that Duty shall be Limited.</P>
<P>And as to the Duty which may be laid on by the Parliament of
<HI>England,</HI> before the Meeting of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for
the Service of the Year 1707: The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
do agree, that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall not be charged
with those Duties, upon this Consideration, that the Parliament of
<HI>Scotland</HI> do make the necessary Provision for the publick Charge and
Service of the Year 1707 in that Kingdom, provided, that if the
Parliament of <HI>England</HI> shall think fit to lay a further Charge on the
Customs, or those Excises, of which the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>Scotland</HI> have agreed to bear equal Burthens in such cases; The Lords
Commissioners tor <HI>England</HI> propose the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be ly∣able
to the same Customs and Excises, having an Equivalent to be
settled by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> And as to the <HI>Quta</HI>
of a Land Tax for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> propos'd by the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI>
do agree, that whenever the Summe of 1997763 <HI>lib. 8 sh.</HI> 4 1/2<HI>d.</HI> shall
be enacted by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to be rais'd in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
on Land, and other things usually charg'd in Acts of Parlia∣ment,
for granting an Aid to the Crown by Land-Tax, the King∣dom
of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be charged by the same Act with the further
Summe of <HI>lib.</HI> 48000 as the <HI>Quota</HI> of that Kingdom to such Tax,
and so proportionably for any greater or leffer Simime rais'd on the
Kingdom of <HI>Enland</HI> by any Tax upon Land, and other tilings usu∣ally

<HEAD>OBSERJTAriON VII.</HEAD>
<P>“It is very remarkable here, That, in the Exemptions from several
Duties in this Treaty, there is a certain Limitation only to the
Act then in Force, and to the Time for which these Duties were
then laid on; From whence some afterward took Occasion against
the Treaters on the <HI>Scots</HI> side, as if they had thereby tacitly con∣sented,
that those Duties should be charged upon <HI>Scotland</HI> after
the Expiration of the Time Limited.</P>
<P>“But they that please to Examine more Nicely into this Mat∣ter,
will find it quite otherwise: The <HI>English</HI> Commissioners con∣senting
to an Exemption from Taxes to the <HI>Scots,</HI> For, as far
as the several Duties debated were laid, seem'd as much as could
reasonably be expected they should agree to; since, to have
gone farther, had been to abridge the United Parliament that
was to follow, and tacitly to acknowledge that was but too
frequently suggested, that they would be Partial to the <HI>English,</HI>
and consequently might oppress the <HI>Scots;</HI> This was the true Mean∣ing
of that part of the Answer the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners gave to
the <HI>Scots</HI> Paper, May 18, <HI>viz. But if the Lords, Commissioners
for</HI> Scotland <HI>would extend their Proposal of the</HI> 13th <HI>to an Exempti∣on
from all Burthens and Excises, which the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain
<HI>may hereafter find necessary to Impose on the United King∣dom;
The Lords Commissioners for</HI> England <HI>are of Opinion, That
it cannot be suppos'd, the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>will ever
lay any sort of Burthens upon the United Kingdom, but what they
shall find of necessity at that time, for the Preservation and Good
of the whole, and with due Regard to the Circumstances and Abilities
of every part of the United Kingdom, and to allow of any Supposi∣tion
to the contrary, would be to form and set up an unanswerable
Argument against the Union it self</HI></P>
<P>“This was very happily foreseen, and by this Method pre∣vented;
For nothing was more certain, than that this very
Argument would be raised. and in the debating this Treaty in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Parliament there, it was one of the great Pleas, and
thought to be an Unanswerable Argument against the Union,
<HI>viz. That the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>might and would,</HI> be∣ing
byass'd by the Majority of Votes on the <HI>Eanglish</HI> side, <HI>lay
Burthens on</HI> Scotland, <HI>without Regard to the Circumstansces and A∣bitity
of that part of the United Kingdom;</HI> And it would indeed
have been an Unanswerable Argument, if the Lords Commissio∣ners
had extended ihcir Limitations of Taxes beyond the Ex∣piration
of the Acts which were then in being.</P>
<P>“Therefore they resolved to leave it indefinite, only with their
Concessions, as Reasons for, and Precedents of future Abate∣ments
to <HI>Scotland;</HI> And this the Commissioners of <HI>Scotland</HI>
found so rceasonable, as that they could not indeed object against it,

as to any Duties which the Parliament then in being in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and which were at hand to sit, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>October</HI> next follow∣ing,
it was but just to ty them up, and the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners
came readily into that; and thus they went on hand in hand,
yielding tct one another in every thing which might without
Injury be granted, and which might in the leaft contribute to
the great and main End ot the Treaty <HI>THE UNION.</HI></P>
<P>“And now they having Clerks appointed to assist ihem in the
Calculations of the Equivalent, which took up a great deal of
Time, they were obliged to adjourn the Affair of Funds, Taxes,

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are very sensible of the

Taxes and Impositions; And their Lordships doubt not, that the
Joynt Desires and Endeavours of the Lords Commissioners for both
Kingdoms, will bring this Treaty to a good and speedy Conclusion
ia every Point.</P>
<P>And as to the Particulars contain'd in the Answer, given in by the

for <HI>Scotland</HI> do accept the said Answer as satissying, as to
the Exemption of the Kingdom ot <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Duties upon

other Laws in Use within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> do after the
Union, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in the same Force as
before, but alterable by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with this
difference betwixt the Laws concerning publick Right, Policy and
Government, and those which concern private Right; That the
Laws which concern publick Right, Policy and Government may
be made the same thro-out the whole United Kingdom; But that
no alteration be made in the Laws which concern private Right, ex∣cept
for evident utility of the Subjects within that part of the United
Kingdom now called <HI>Scotland.</HI> And as to the Judicatures within
<HI>Scotland,</HI> The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose as fol∣loweth.</P>
<P>That the Court of Session or College of Justice do after the Union,

<HI>Scotland,</HI> as 'tis now constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and
with the same Authority and Priviledges as before the Union;
subject nevertheless, to such Regulations ior the better Administra∣tion
of Justice as shall be made by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>That the Court of Justiciary do also after the Union, and not∣withstanding
thereof, remain in all time coming within <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
'tis now constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the
same Authority and Priviledges as before the Union; subject never∣theless,
to such Regulations as shall be made by the Parliament of
<HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and without prejudice of other Rights of Justiciary.</P>
<P>That all other Courts presently in Being within the Kingdom of
<HI>Scotland</HI> do remain, but subject to Alterations by the Parliament of
<HI>Great-Britain;</HI> And that all Inferior Courts within the said Limits
do remain subordinar, as they now are to the Supreme Courts of
Justice within the same, in all time coming.</P>
<P>That no Causes in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be Cognoscible by the

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Reserve of Judicatories in <HI>Scotland</HI> being now the De∣bate,
it is needful only to Explain a few things for the Informa∣tion
of the Reader, as to the Nature of those Judicatories and
Reserves.</P>
<P>“It was absolutely necessary to Reserve the Laws, Courts of
justice, and Civil or Criminal Judicatories, because the re∣specive
Kingdoms being Govern'd by differing Customs, Rites,
Laws, and Methods of Justice, it would have infinitely Embar∣rast
the Treaty now, and the Kingdoms afterward to have
made any Alteration. It would have perfectly put a stop to all
publick Justice for a time, and all the Persons bred to the Law
in that Kingdom who had changed their Laws, would have
been rendred Unable to Practise or Discharge their Duty to their
Clients,&amp;c. and have been by consequence divested of their
Livelyhoods; These Difficulties appearing so great, the <HI>English</HI>
commissioners came readily into it, only with a few Restricti∣ons;
As</P>
<P>I, That all Laws for the Regulating Trade, Customs and
Excises, be the same in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union as In <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
This was absolutely necessary to be done, <HI>tho</HI>
if they should extend the word, to all Laws for Regulation of
Trade it might be run out to difficult Extremes.&amp; occasion
an unanswerable Dispute; but moderately speaking, it
was absolutely necessary to prevent the confusion among
Officers in Collecting the Revenue, stating and settling
<PB N="58" REF="166"/>
the Customs and Excises, which were now to be extend∣ed
to both Countries.</P>
<P>2. “Again, it was most, necessary that their other Laws
should <HI>be alterable by the Parliament of Great Britain,</HI>
otherwise this had been to tye up the Hands of the fu∣ture
Constitution from making necessary Provision against;
Whatever Inconveniencies might happen in the Govern∣ment;
And I mention this here, because in the tumultu∣ary
Clamours raised afterwards against the Treaty, and
against the Treaters, this was one of the great Quarrels,
That they had given up the Laws and Constitution of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and had subjected them to the arbitrary Votes
of a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, in which it was alledged, the
Majority being so much <HI>English,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> could expect
nothing but Disadvantage. But it is apparent, and was
at the time of the Treaty considered, that the leaving the
Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> subjct to Alteration by the <HI>British</HI>
Parliament, signified no more than leaving room for
the, Parliament in Cases of Necessity, or indeed on all oc∣casions,
to make <HI>Laws for Scotland,</HI> as should appear need∣ful]
for the publick Advantage, always reserving their
general Form of Law and Proceedings of Justice, as be∣fore;
And without this, <HI>Scotland,</HI> must have been mise∣rably
left without a <HI>Legislature,</HI> and have had no oppor∣tunity
to have helped her self in Cases contingent, or
have obtained any more or other Laws for the Rectifica∣tion
of any of the common Abuses of her Government,
which it seems these Objectors did not think it worth
their while to consider.”</P>
<P>“And that this alone was the meaning of this word. <HI>Alterable</HI>
by the Parliament of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> and that it was understood so
on both Hands, is evident from the very words of the Proposal
of the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners, when they propose the Alternative
between publick and private Right—, With this difference be∣twixt
the Laws concerning publick Right, Policy and Government,
and those which concern privat Right; That the Laws which con∣cern
publick Right, Policy and Government may be made the same
thro-out the whole United Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made
in the Laws which conern privat Right, except for evident utility of
the Subjects within that part of the United Kingdom now called
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“The three next Articles do also still more evidently Con∣firm
this, viz. That the Court of Session, or College of Justice, do, af∣ter
the Union, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in all time com∣ing
within <HI>Scotland,</HI> as 'tis now constituted by the Law of that
Kingdom, and with the same Authority and Priviledges as before the
Union; SubjeCt nevertheless, to such Regulations for the better Ad∣ministration
Of justice, as shall be made by the Parliament of Great∣Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="167"/>
“That the Court of Justiciary do also, after the Union, and not∣withstanding
thereof, remain in all time coming within <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
'tis now Constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the
same Authority and Priviledges as before the Union; Subject never∣thelss,
to such Regulations as shall be made by the Parliament of
<HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and without prejudice of other Rights of Justiciary.</P>
<P>That all other Courts presently in Being within the Kingdom of
<HI>Scotland</HI> do remain, but subject to Alterations by the Parliament of
<HI>Great-Britain;</HI> And that all Inferior Courts within the said Limits do
remain Subordinate as they now are, to the Supreme Courts of Justice
within the same, in all time coming.</P>
<P>“Now It was thought most Irrational to argue, That the Laws
and Constitution of Justice in <HI>Scotland</HI> was in this Treaty, gi∣ven
up to the <HI>English;</HI> When as, by these Articles, the Courts
of Justice, and the General form of Administration, such as the
Session, Justiciary, and all other Courts, were to remain in
Force for ever, or in all time coming.</P>
<P>And yet, as if this had not been enough to secure the <HI>Scots</HI>
from this Fear, the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> Form the Ne∣gative,
and in it enter on the Particulars, viz. That no Causes
in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be Cognoscible by the Court of Chancery,
Queens Bench, Common Pleas, or any other Courts in <HI>Westminster</HI>
Hall, and that the said Courts, or any other of the like Natur, af∣ter
the Union, shall have no Power to Cognosce, Review, or Alter
the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures within Scotland, or stop the
Execution of the same.</P>
<P>“The Privy Council indeed was left to the Queen to Dissolve
or Continue, as Her Majesty might see Cause—; But that
was by the Treaty subject to Parliamentary Determination, and
how the Queen referr'd it to the Parliament, will appear in its
Course.</P>
<P>“Nay the Treaters were so tender of this General Invading the
Particulars, That they took Care to Exempt Private Jurisdicti∣ons
and Properties from the Power or Cognizance of Parliament,
which is what is not done in <HI>England,</HI> and which, it has been
thought even in <HI>Scotland</HI> too, had been better left to the Parlia∣ment
in time, to have Dissolved, giving Satisfaction to the Par∣ties
concerned, <HI>I mean,</HI> such as Heretable Offices. Jurisdictions
for Life, &amp;</P>
<P>“All these Provisions were so exactly stated, and so forcible in
themselves, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners had so shown both
their Capacity in the Affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Candor in
respect to Union, in the Great Affair before them, That the
<HI>English</HI> Commissioners made no Objection, but agreed to it, as
they, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners had brought it in, without any
Amendment.</P>
<P>“And this Formed the 18, 19, 20, 21 Articles of the Uni∣on,
which were so clearly digested, that they admitted little
or no Debate afterwards in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where
<PB N="60" REF="168"/>
all the rest past the strictest Scrutiny, and almost a Fiery Trial.</P>

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> having taken into Conside∣ration
the proposals deliver'd in to them the a <HI>21st</HI> day of <HI>May</HI> last
by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the effectual prevent∣ing
the Exportation of <HI>Scots</HI> Salt to <HI>England</HI> or the Plantations,
without paying the same Excises with which <HI>English</HI> Salt is charged,
during the Exemption allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> from the said Duty, do
give the following Answer to the several Proposals therein.</P>
<P>1. As to the First Article of the said Proposal, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Salt
be Transported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by Land under the Penalty
of forfeiting the Salt, and the Horses used in Transporting it, and
paying ten shillings for every Bushel of Salt so Transported, for which
the Carriers, as well as the Owner shall be lyable conjunctly and se∣verally,
and the Carrier be imprisoned until the said Penalty be
paid.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree to the same with
the Alterations following, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Salt be Transported from
<HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by Land in any manner whatsoever, under the
Penalty of forfeiting the Salt, and the Cattle and Carriages made
<PB N="61" REF="169"/>
use of in Transporting it, and paying ao shillings for every Bushel
of such Salt, and proportionable for a greater or lesser Quantity, for
which the Carrier, as well as the Owner shall be lyable conjunctly
and severally, and the Persons carrying the same, to be Imprisoned
by any one Justice of the Peace by the space of six Months, without
Baill or Main-prize, and until the Penalty be paid.</P>
<P>2. As to the second Article relating to Salt Water-born, to be
carried from Port to Port in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Salt Exported from <HI>Scot∣land
to England</HI> or the Plantations.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> as to that part of it which
relates to Salt Water-born to be carried from Port to Port in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
do agree to the same.</P>
<P>And as to that part of the said Proposal which relates to Salt Ex∣ported
from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by Sea; The Lords Commissoners
for <HI>England</HI> do Propose, That there shall be paid in
<HI>England</HI> for
all Salt made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Imported from thence into <HI>England,</HI>
the same Duty upon the Importation as shall be paid for Salt made
in <HI>England,</HI> to be levied and secured in the same manner as the
Duties on Forreign Salt, are to be levied and secured in <HI>England,</HI>
and if any other Salt which is not made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be Im∣ported
from thence into <HI>England,</HI> the same to be charg'd with the
Duties on Forreign Salt Imported into <HI>England</HI> to be levied and se∣cured
in the same manner.</P>
<P>And as to the last part of the said Article relating to Salt Expor∣ted
from <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Plantations.
The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do not insist that any Duty
ought to be paid for the same, or for Salt Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI>
to any other Forreign Place whatsoever, in regard, that upon the
Exportation of Salt from <HI>England</HI> to the Plantations, or any other
Forreign Parts, the Duty before paid for the same, is to be Re∣paid.</P>
<P>3. And as to that part of the last Article of the said Proposal,
which relates to salted Fish Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords Commissioner for <HI>England</HI> do propose, That for all
such Fish, there shall be paid in <HI>England</HI> upon the Importation there∣of,
such Sums of Money as by the Law relating to the Duties upon
Salt in <HI>England</HI> are allowed, and Re-paid to the Exporter there of
upon Exportation of the like Fish from <HI>England</HI> to Forreign Parts, in
regard all Salt used in Fish Cured and Consum'd in <HI>England,</HI> is lyable
to Duties of the same value, and in case the said Fish shall be
Re-exported from <HI>England,</HI> the Duties paid for the same, upon Im∣portation
thereof, shall be Re-paid.</P>
<P>And as to all salted Fish Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to any other
place; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do not insist that any
Duty shall be paid in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Salt used therein, in Regard
upon the Exportation of such Fish from <HI>England</HI> to any Forreign
Parts, the Exporter thereof hath an Allowance out of the Duties on
Salt of the much Money as the Duty of the Sale used in Curing such
Fish amounts to.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="170"/>
And as to that part of the said Article which Relates to selted
Flesh Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Regard all salted Flesh consutn'd
in <HI>England</HI> or made ufe of for Victualling of Ships there, or Expor∣ted
from <HI>England</HI> to parts beyond the Seas, is Cured with Salt, for
which the Duty on Salt is paid in <HI>England,</HI> and not Re-paid upon
Exportation of any such Flesh. from <HI>England,</HI> and there being so
much Salt used in the Curing one Hundred Weight of Flesh (each
Hundred Weight being computed at one Hundred and Twelve
Pound weight) as the Duty thereof payable in <HI>England,</HI> amounts
to Two shillings.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do propose, That
there be paid in <HI>England,</HI> upon the Importation of every such Hun∣dred
Weight of Flesh from <HI>Scotland,</HI> two shillings; And that, be∣fore
such Flesh is so Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> an Entry be made at
the custom-House of the Port of Exportation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of the
Quantity of Flesh so to be Exported, and the Port in <HI>England,</HI> for
which the same is bound, and Security given by Bond to Her Ma∣jesty,
at the said Port of Exportation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the said
Flesh shall be Landed at the Port in <HI>England,</HI> for which the same
shall be so Enter'd, or at some other Port in <HI>England,</HI> the Danger of
the Seas and Enemies excepted: Which Bond shall be delivered
up, upon producing a Certificate from the Collectors, or Officers of
the Customs of the Port of Importaticn in <HI>England,</HI> That such Flesh
was Landed, and left at the said Port; And that the Duty of two
shillings be paid in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for all salted Flesh made use of for
Victualling of Ships there, or Exported from thence to any other
parts besides <HI>England;</HI> And that no failed Flesh be brought into
<HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> by Land, under the penalty of Forfeiting the
same, or the Value thereof, and the Cattle and Carriages imploy'd
in carrying thereof, and of the like Imprisonment as they have be∣fore
propos'd, in case of salt brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by
Land.</P>
<P>And if any Frauds shall hereafter appear, which are not suffie∣ently
provided against by the Foregoing Proposals; The Lords
Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do propose, the same shall be subject to
such further Provisions, as shall be thought fit by the Parliament of
Great-Britain.</P>
<P>And whereas the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> did, in their
Paper delivered the <HI>15 May</HI> last part, Consent, That the Kingdom
of <HI>Scotland</HI> should, for a competent time, remain exempted from
payment of the Duty on Salt, for all the Salt spent in Kind, or us'd
in Provisions spent within that Kingdom, The Lords Commissio∣ners
for <HI>England</HI> do now propose. That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI>
shall remain exempt from payment of that Duty for all Salt spent
in Kind, or used in Provisions within the said Kingdom, for the
Term of seven Years after the Union, upon the Lords commissio∣ners

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do agreee to the Proposal
contain'd in the Answer delivered by the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>England</HI> the 5 Instant, concerning the effectual preventing the Ex∣portation
of <HI>Scots</HI> Salt from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> without paying
the tame Excises with which the <HI>English</HI> Salt is charg'd, during the
Exemption allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> from the said Duty, with the Fol∣lowing
Alterations.</P>
<P>1. As to that part of the second Article,<HI>viz.</HI> That if any Salt
which is not made in <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be Imported to <HI>England</HI> from
thence, the same to be charg'd with the Duties of Forreign Salrt Im∣ported
into <HI>England,</HI> to be levied and secured in the same manner;
The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do understand, That it is not
the Meaning of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> by the said
Proposal, to lay a double Duty on Forreign Salt, Exported from
<HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> once to be exacted at Importation of the said
Salt into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the like Duty at the Importation into Eng∣land
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> but that the Forreign Salt Imported into <HI>Scot∣and,</HI>
be charg'd at the Importation there, with the same Duties
after the UNION, as the like Salt is charg'd with, being Imported
into <HI>England,</HI> to be levied and secured in the same manner; And
for further security in that case, The Lords Commissioners for
<HI>Scotland</HI> do propose, that Certificates be sent with Forreign Salt, Ex∣ported
from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> from the Custom Office in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
where the said Forreign Salt was sirst Imported, to the Cu∣stom
Office in <HI>England,</HI> where the said Salt shall happen to be Trans∣ported,
bearing the payment of, or security given for the Duties
at the said Port, under this Penalty, that Forreign Salt Exported
from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England</HI> without such Certificates, shall be con∣fiscated.</P>
<P>2. As to the Third Article relating to Salted Fish or Flesh, Ex∣ported
from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,0</HI> and Salted Flesh made use of
tor Victualling of Ships in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI>
to parts beyond the Seas; The Lords Commissioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> do apprehend, that the said Articles do only
<PB N="64" REF="172"/>
concern such Fish and Flesh as is cured in whole or in part with <HI>Scott</HI>
Salt, there being an obvious Difference betwixt the Case of these,
and of such Fish and Flesh, Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> as
is wholly cur'd with Forreign Salt, in regard that foreign Salt is
to pay the like Duty as in <HI>England</HI> at Importation into <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and therefore ought not to pay a second Duty.</P>
<P>And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do proposc, That if
the Duty on Salt take place in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Expiration of se∣ven
Years, during which time the Exemption is agreed to, That
then the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall have an Equivalent.</P>

<P>THE Lord Keeper, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for

<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> having considered the

<P>Adjoarn'd to <HI>Saturday</HI> the I 15th Instant, one a Clock.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION IX.</HEAD>
<P>“There were some Debates and a little time spent about the
Matter of the Admiralty, but it was soon adjusted, and needs
no Remark on it, only as to the Matter of Appeals to <HI>England,</HI>
which however were sound nccesiary, and agreed to with some
little Trouble.</P>
<P>“But here had like to have happened a Difficulty about Ap∣peals
in Causes of private Right in <HI>Scoyland</HI>—; Before the
Union, Appeals in Law lay from the Lords of the Session to the
Parliament; and the House of Peers of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> being now
to be the Sovereign Judicature of <HI>Britain,</HI> there could be no Ap∣peals
but to them in Parliament: This it was thought would
be a Grievance, by Reason of the Distancc of Place, the Expence
of Travelling, and the Charge of Prosecuting those Tryals at the
Bar of the House of Peers.</P>
<P>“It was Objected, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers could not be allowed
to Vote in Matters of Judicature, either in Civil or Criminal case
in <HI>England;</HI> and they gave a seeming substanrtial Reason of
it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> reserving their Judicature, Scssion ant
Justiciary to themselves, in which the <HI>Eng4lish</HI> have no Voice
it would be unreasonable to desire the <HI>Scots</HI> should be let into
that in <HI>England,</HI> which is reserv'd from the English in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="175"/>
“But to this it was Answered,</P>
<P>“The Lords in <HI>England,</HI> as Peers Assembled in Parliament,
as they were before the Sovereign Judicature of <HI>England,</HI>
would after the Union be to gether with the sixteen <HI>Scots</HI>
Peers, the only Sovereign Judicature of <HI>Britain,</HI> and have
their Voices in the Judicature of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as of
<HI>England</HI>—; If this be made out, then the Objection
against the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen Voting in Judicial Matters in
<HI>England,</HI> would by Consequence fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>“The Judicature of the Lords consists in their trying their own
Members for Life, and in Determining the Proceedings of all
the other Courts of Justicc in the Nation; an Appeal going to
them from all other Judicatures whatsoever, whether before or
after Judgment.</P>
<P>“In Tryals of Peers, 'tis plain by this Union, the <HI>English</HI>
Lords will have a Vote in the Seats Judicature, since they will
have the Power to try all the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers for their Lives orother∣wise,
in any Case wherein they shall become Obnoxious to the
Law.</P>
<P>“And as to Appeals, it was therefore absolutely necessary they
should ly before the House of Lords, they being the only Supreme
Judicature; and to have had Appeals before any other, had
been to have two Supremes, unless Commissioned by them; And if
Commissioned by them and made certain, they had been too Infe∣riour,
and also not to be depended upon in Matters of such Mo∣ment.
To solve this Difficulty, a short Scheme was handed about
for theRegulating that Point, so as to Vest the whole Authority of
the Law judicially in the <HI>British</HI> Peers in Parliament, and settle
the Essential Part in them, without nevertheless imposmg the
Trouble upon the <HI>Scots</HI> of coming up with their Causes to the
Lords Bar, which would be intolerable.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Scheme was as follows.</HEAD>
<P>“The <HI>Scots</HI> have now an Appeal from the Lords of Session,
which are their Judges of Assize, or whatever else they may call
them.</P>
<P>“This Right of Appeal must not dy tho' the Parliament be∣fore
whom it lyes is Dissolved, but must Devolve upon that
Power to which as the Center of the whole their Parliament Dc∣volves,
<HI>viz. The Parliament of Britain;</HI> Other wise should the
Right of Appeal dy, which is one Article of the <HI>Scots</HI> Claim of
Right, they endanger their property, and may upon a Thou∣sand
not unlikely Circumstances Revert to Tyrrannick Power,
and even a Parliament may not help them.</P>
<P>“The Right of Appeal being not Dissolv'd, but Transfer'd to
the general Center of Power, where, or on which Branch of that
Power must it reside? Not in the Commons, that would be to
make them a Court of Judicature, which they to not pretend
to, and can not by their Constitution accept.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="176"/>
“Not to the select Number of <HI>Scots</HI> Representatives, that would
be to give them more power than the <HI>English</HI> Representatives;
one having a judicial Authority, the other not.</P>
<P>“Not to a Number chosen by the <HI>Scots,</HI> that would be a new
Creation, and be a Reserve of some Power superior even to the
general supreme power of Parliament, and many ways give
Umbrage of a possibility of Return to a separate Constitution,
which would be really inconsistent with a National Incorporated
Union, and capable of keeping on foot continual Jealousics,
Complaints, and Discontents among us, and might sometime
or other break out into a Rupture again, and Unravel the very
Union it self.</P>
<P>“To regulate this, we must fly to one general Maxime, which
we must adhere clossly to in all Matters of this Dispute, <HI>viz.</HI> That
the great Center of Power whether Civil or Criminal is, and is
to be lodg'd in the Parliament then to be called, <HI>The Parliament
of Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>“The Judicial Power in <HI>Scotland</HI> is immediately in the Session,
as it is <HI>England</HI> in the judges; the Lords of the Session in <HI>Scotland</HI>
as the Judges in <HI>England,</HI> receive their Commissioners from the
Sovereign, and in Her Name, and by Her Authority, tho' by
special Law obtained in both Kingdoms, they are so fixed as that
they can not be turn'd out but upon Misbehaviour.</P>
<P>“From the Session in <HI>ScotIand,</HI> and all Acts, Sentences or <HI>Decreets</HI>
there, lyes an Appeal to the parliament, who sitting in one Hoase
are the fovereign Judicature of the Nation, as well Commons as
Lords; From the Judges in <HI>England</HI> Appeals ly to the Chancery,
and from thence to the House of Lords as the supreme Judicature
of this Nation.</P>
<P>“But both parliaments being to be Incorporated into one as
both Nations by consequence will be one, so the publick Justice
must run in the same Channel, and the Appeals of both Kingdoms
ly before the <HI>British</HI> Peers only, as that sovereign Ocean of
Justice into which all the Streams must slow.</P>
<P>“But to the end that <HI>Scotland</HI> may, as far as may be, Eas'd in
that Inconveiency, which her distance from the Capital may
bring upon Her, &amp; in which the suffers otherways deeply enough,
Appeals from the Courts of Justice in <HI>Scotland,</HI> may be tryed in
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“A Court of Appeals may be Erected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> delegated
Form the Peers of <HI>Britain</HI> assembled in Parliament, to be named
Annually or Triennialjy, or every Scssion, or otherwise, as in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Union shall be agreed.</P>
<P>“These Delegates to be Nam'd out of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility and
County to chosen by Ballot, or by the usual way of Voting in
The House of Peers.</P>
<P>“That they should be <HI>Scots</HI> is but equal, as they are only to
Judege of causes in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is agreeable to the Constit∣tion
of <HI>England,</HI> which causes all Tryals at Law to be tryed in
<PB N="69" REF="177"/>
the County where the Party dwells, and to be Determined by a
Jury of the Freeholders or Inhabitants of that particular County,
and of no other.</P>
<P>“And yet this does no way lessen the Authority of the Parlia∣ment,
but preserves the Title of the Lords here to a Voice even
in the Supreme Judicature of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“This Scheme as it Entitules the Parliament of United <HI>Britain</HI>
to its full and compleat Jurisdiction; so it preserves the Right
of Appeal to the <HI>Scots,</HI> prevents the Expensive proceeding of
carrying their Appeals to <HI>England,</HI> and takes may all the force
of the Objection against the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen having a Voice in
the English Judicature.</P>
<P>“Thus the Union in point of Judicature may still be compleat,
and the general Incorporation not at all Obstructed, the Course
of Justice left free and open, and both Nations equally concern'd
in it.</P>
<P>“The <HI>English</HI> Peers are let into the Sovereignty of the <HI>Scots</HI>
Judicature as well as of their own; and the <HI>Scots</HI> let into all the
necessary Privileges which the Right of their Peerage, and the
nature of an Incorporated Equality requires.</P>
<P>“There were Reasons to be given why this Proposal was
not further entred upon, tho' both sides approved of the
Method, some of which were perhaps such as These.</P>
<P>“1. That one side were willing enough to have all Appeals
come to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“1. Others willing to have as few as possible made at all,
and supposing that the Inconveniencies of pursuing an
Appeal to <HI>England,</HI> would incline People rather to acqui∣esce.
and make the Judgment of the Session more De∣finitive—.
But These things by the way.</P>

by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the <HI>14th</HI> Instant,
which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> having considered the
Paper deliver'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI>
on the <HI>14th</HI>

<P>The Lord Keeper, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
delivered to the Board the following Paper, which was
Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> having taken into Con∣sideration,
the Reply delivered the 7th Instant, by the Lords Com∣missioners
for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Answer of the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>England,</HI> to the Proposal made by the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>Scotland</HI> the <HI>21st of May</HI> last, for the effectual preventing the Expor∣tation
of <HI>Scotch</HI> Salt to <HI>England,</HI> or the Plantations, without paying
<PB N="70" REF="178"/>
the same Excises with which <HI>English</HI> Salt is charg'd, during the Ex∣emption
allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> from the said Dutys, and as to sailed
Provisions.</P>
<P>As to that part of the Reply which relates to the second Article
in the said Answer, concerning Salt not made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Impor∣ted
from thence into <HI>England,</HI> The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
did not intend, that a double Duty should be laid on Forreign
Salt Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> and therefore the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> do agree to the Proposal in the said
Reply, that all Forreign Salt Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> be charg'd at
the Importation there with, the same Dutys after the Union, as the
like Salt is charg'd with, being Imported into <HI>England,</HI> to be levied
and secured in the same manner, and to the further security, by
Certificate there in propos'd, to be sent with Forreign Salt Expor∣ted
from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And as to that part of the said Reply, which relates to the third
Article in the said Answer, touching saired Fish cr Flesh Exported
from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and falted Flesh made use offer Victual∣ling
of Ships in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to Parts be∣yond
the Seas; It appearing by the said Proposal deliver'd by the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> the <HI>21st May</HI> last, That all Fish
and Flesh Barrelled in <HI>Scotland</HI> for Exportation, are by the Law of
<HI>Scotland</HI> appointed to be Pack'd and Cured with Forreign Salt, with∣out
any mixture of <HI>Scotch</HI> Salt; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
do not insist on the said third Article in their said Answer, Provid∣ed
it be agreed, that all Salted Fish or Flesh Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI>
to <HI>England,</HI> and all falted Flesh made use of for Victualling of Ships
in<HI>Scotland,</HI> or put on Board to be Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to Parts
beyond the Seas, that shall appear to be falted with <HI>Scots</HI> Salt, or
a mixture of such Salt, shall be Forfeited, and as such may be feiz'd
n <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>As to the last part of the Proposal of the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>Scotland,</HI> That if the Duty on Salt take place in <HI>ScotLand</HI> alter the
expiration of seven years, that then the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI>
shall have an Equivalent; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI>
do understand, that the Equivalent is only to be extended to such
part of the Outlet as shall be applyed to the payment of the Debts
of <HI>England.</HI></P>

was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> being allured by the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> that there will be sound insupcrable Dif∣ficulties

Numbur Formerly propos'd by the Lords Commissioners tor <HI>England;</HI>

That Fourty five Members, and no more be the Number of the Re∣presentatives
for that Part of the United Kingdom, now called <HI>Scol∣and,</HI>

<P>And there being an absolute Necessity, that the Number of Peers
to be admitted into the House of Lords of the United Kingdom,
for that Part of the United Kingdom, now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> be re∣gulated
in Proportion to the Number to be admitted into the House

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having considered the Paper

<HEAD>OBSERVATION X.</HEAD>
<P>“There was now the only remaining Difficulty of the Union
before them, and this was the Consequence of the Third Article,
<HI>viz.</HI> The Uniting the Parliament, and how to state the Propor∣tioan
of Representative was the present Case.</P>
<P>“The Difficulty was double, not only how to draw the
Proportion so, as might consist with the Equalities spoken of
before, which were the foot or Rule of the Treaty, but how
to draw it so, as that either Parliament, who were to Confirm
this Work, should be rationally supposed to come into it.</P>
<P>“Abundance of Schemes were proposed for this, as Mens Fan∣cies
guided them, and the Debates without Doors were much
warmer, than those within, However, as it was a Thing re∣quired
particular Application, so it was the bestStep that could
have been taken, by way of preliminary, to propose a Confe∣rence,
wherein both sides had full Scope to deliver their Argu∣ments
and Reasons in the Case; since, to have gone on by
Proposals and Answers in Writing, would have taken up more
time than was needful to be spent in such an Affair, and have
kept it depending; where as both sides were pleased with the
Hopes, and both the Kingdoms big with Expectation of the
Success of this Treaty, and the Conclusion of the long expected
Union.</P>
<P>“There was no Occasion to look far back into Former Years
for Help in this Calculation; There was but one Precedent in
the whole World, from which any Scheme could be drawn, and
that was in the trausient Union made by <HI>Oliver</HI> Cromwel; in
which, as I have noted before, he brought everything by a Scale
of Proportions to a Point, as things then slood.</P>
<P>“This Model of a Represenative was taken from the Scheme
of Proportions, upon which he had formed his Taxation, in
Which <HI>Scotland</HI> being Rated at about a <HI>13th</HI> part of the Land
Tax, had also allowed her about a 13th part of the Representa∣tive,
as follows;</P>
<P>“<HI>England</HI> was Taxed at <HI>70000 l. per Mensem,</HI> and was Re∣prcsented
in Parliament by <HI>400</HI> Members.</P>
<P>“<HI>Scotland</HI> was Tax'd at <HI>6000 l. per Mensem,</HI> and was Re∣prcsented
in Parliament by <HI>30</HI> Members.</P>
<P>“Now abating a few Fractions, which, in dividing Persons,
cannot be exactly observed, it is plain, <HI>30</HI> to <HI>400</HI> is very near
what <HI>6000 l.</HI> is to <HI>70000 l,</HI> as follows;</P>
<P>“<HI>13</HI> times <HI>30</HI> is <HI>390</HI> Members, and <HI>13</HI> times <HI>6000 l.</HI> is <HI>78000
l.</HI> whereas one is <HI>8000 l.</HI> over in the Money, so the other is <HI>10</HI>
under in the Representative.</P>
<P>“I will not say, this was the most. equal Judgment that ever
was made of this kind as to <HI>Scotland,</HI> but. I may be allowed to
say, that, with Respect to <HI>England,</HI> it was certainly the most
<PB N="73" REF="181"/>
equal Distribution of Elections that ever was, and much beyond
our prcsent Method; for, in this Scheme, the Disproportion
of Numbers was taken away, and the Election of Members to
Represent Ruin'd Heaps, Decayed Castles and Depopulated
Towns, was let fall: But of this by the way.</P>
<P>“The present Calculation was not very remote from this in Effect,
tho' not built upon the same foot; and it was very rational∣ly
argued here, That the Proportion could not be taken barely
from the Share of Taxes paid, which was the Scheme which most:
of the Politicians of that time pretended to go upon; but that
the Proportion must be doubly caleulared, which if it be Exa∣min'd,
and were to be Applyed in <HI>Holland,</HI> and other parts of
the World, must have been done.</P>
<P>For Instance the Share in Taxes.</P>
<P>And the Number of the People.</P>
<P>“If, on one Hand, the Share of Taxes may be low, yet the
Number of People great; or, on the other Hand, the Share
of Taxes high, and the People few the Extremes are to bear
their Weight in the Proportion.</P>
<P>“Thus, tho, the <HI>Scots,</HI> by this Union, paid but <HI>48000l.</HI> for
<HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>1997000 l. English,</HI> which was about 1/40 part,
forthy times <HI>48000 l.</HI> being <HI>1920000 l.</HI> to have argued
from thence, That they should have but <HI>13</HI> Members,
which, to the House of Commons, is 1/39 6/13 part of <HI>513;</HI>
This would appear ridiculous.</P>
<P>“Again, if you take an Estimate of the People of both Na∣tions,
we shall find <HI>Scotland</HI> Esteemed to contain Two
Millions, and <HI>England,</HI> at the highest Calculation, under
Six; and this brings <HI>Scotland</HI> to a Third Part of the
Members, which would be Extravagant the other way,
and oblige them to send 171 Members to the House.</P>
<P>“But, if you set These Extremes against one another, it will
appear, That a Tenth of the Representative Answer'd as
nigh to an Equality, as such a Thing could well be reduced
to; and on this foot, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners were sup∣posed
to be near the Matter, when they desired <HI>50</HI>
Members might be the Representative for <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“However this was, the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners having propos∣ed
<HI>38, as by the Minutes,</HI> a Conference was agreed to;</P>
<P>“And here the Commissioners sincerely and candidly applyed
themselves to one another, debating not only the Reasons and
Proportions on either Hand, but the Temper and Circumstances
of either Nation; so if possible, to Accommodate them selves
to both, and to consider not only what was equal, but also what
was likely to take place in the Minds of the respective Parlia∣ments,
which were to debate it after them; of which none
knew the Difficulties better than themselves, neither were These
things sit to have been the Subject of Minutes, which, in time,
were to be supposed, would be made publick, and be canvas'd
<PB N="74" REF="182"/>
on either side by the most Critical Heads of Two Nations, and
particularly by those in both the Nations, whose Study it
would be to oppose and obstruct the Union.</P>
<P>“And indeed, in this Prudence of the Commissioners, consist∣ed
the best Prospect of bringing this Treaty to a Happy Con∣clusion.</P>
<P>“The Conference was Happy In its Success, the <HI>English</HI> com∣missioners
were convinced by the Reasons given on the other
side, they saw the Difficulties which the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners Re∣presented
lay before them; and regarding the End of their
Meeting, which was to contribute, as much as in them lay, to
Unite the Two Kingdoms, they advanced their Number to <HI>45,</HI>
and gave their Reasons and Difficulties on the other Hand, po∣sitively
determining the Point, that they could go no further;
Upon which the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioner, from the same Zeal for
bringing the Treaty, which was now in so Happy a forward∣ness,
to a Conclusion, acquiesced.</P>
<P>“As for the Number of the Peers, there was no Room to de∣bate,
since the Number proposed, which was <HI>16,</HI> was a full Pro∣ortion
to the other, &amp; had more of an Equality in it a great deal,
than any other part off the Treaty; Especially considering, That se∣veral
of the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers then were Peers of <HI>England,</HI> and hereaf∣ter
might become Peers of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> by Creation.</P>
<P>“And thus this great Difficulty was also happily got over,
and now the Union began to Chew it self, and People on every
Hand began to Expect, it should be Compleated in a few Days.</P>

<P>The Lord Treasurer in Name of the Lords Commissioners for Eng∣land,
delivered to the Board the following Paper, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for England having considered the Paper
concerning Salt, deliver'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI>
21st Instant, think, themselves oblig'd to Inform their Lordships,
that the whole Duties on Salt, are not appropriated for payment of
the Debts of <HI>England;</HI> The Duty of 12 <HI>d.</HI> a Bushel on Halt tho'
granted to the Crown in perpetuity, is appropriated to the pay∣ment
of Debts no longer than till the 1st. August 1710.</P>
<P>That the remaining part of the Duty on Salt, <HI>viz.</HI> 2 sh. 4 d. a
Bushel is granted to the Crown in perpetuity, and is with other
Duties appropriated for payment of 160000 lib. <HI>per annum</HI> to the
East India Company Redeemable by Parliament, and the super∣plusage
above that Annual summe is not appropriated to the pay∣ment
of the Debts of England; And therefore the Lords Commis∣sioners
for <HI>England</HI> do think it necessary for them, to insist upon
what was exprest in their Paper deliver'd by them the 15th Instant;
that when the Duty on Salt shall take place in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Equiva∣lent
<PB N="78" REF="186"/>
lent which the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> is to have, ought to be exten∣ded
only to such part of the Dutys on Salt, as shall be applyed to
the payment of the Debts of England.</P>
<P>The Lord Treasurer did likewise in Name of the Lords Commis∣sioners
for England, deliver to the Board the following Paper,
which was Read.</P>
<P>It appearing by a Paper given in by the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>Scotland</HI> the 21st Instant, that the Lords Commissioners for Eng∣land
had not fully expressed themselves in some part of a Paper de∣liver'd
by them on the 19th Instant, to the satisfaction of the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and being desirous upon this, and all
other occasions, to proceed with all possible clearness, do make the
following Explanation of their meaning in that part of the said
Paper.</P>
<P>They agree, That all Peers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Successors to
their Honours &amp; Dignities, shall from and after the Union be reckon∣ed
and declared Peers of Great-Britain, and shall be Tryed
as Peers of Great-Britain, and shall enjoy the Priviledges
of Peers, as fully as the Peers of <HI>England</HI> do now enjoy the
same, or as they or any other Peers of Britain may hereafter enjoy
the same, except the Right and Priviledge of sitting in the House of
Lords, and the priviledges depending thereon, and particularly the
Right of sitting upon the Tryals of Peers.</P>
<P>They agree, That the sixteen Peers who are to sit in the House of
Lords of Great-Britain, for that part of the United Kingdom called
<HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Union shall have all Priviledges of Parliament,
which the Peers of <HI>England</HI> now have, and which they or any Peers
of Britain shall have after the Union, and particularly the Right of
sitting upon the Tryals of Peers.</P>
<P>They agree, That in Case of the Tryal of any Peer in time of Ad∣journment
or Prorogation of Parliament, the said sixteen Peers shall
be summon'd in the same manner, and have the same powers and
priviledges at such Tryals, as any other Peers of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>And they do further agree, That in case any Tryals of Peers shall
hereafter happen, when there is no Parliament in Being, the sixteen
Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> who fat in the last proceeding Parliament, shall be
summon'd in the same manner, and have the same Powers and Pri∣viledges
at such Tryals, as any other Peers of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The Lord Treasurer did also in Name of the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>England,</HI> deliver to the Board the following Paper, which was
Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree to the Proposal

touching Ships belonging to Her Majesties Subjects in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with
the Alterations following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That all Ships belonging to Her Majestics Subjects in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at
the time of sighing the Treaty for the Union of the said Kingdoms,
tho Forreign Build, shall be deem'd and pass as Ships of the Built
of Great-Britain; the Owner or Owners within twelve Moneths
after the Union, making Oath that the same did belong to him or
<PB N="79" REF="187"/>
them at the signing the said Treaty, and doth then belong to
him or them; and that no Forreigner directly nor indirectly hath
any share or part, or interst therein; Which Oath shall be made
before the chief Officer or Officers of the Customs iu the Port next the
Abode of the said Owner or Owners; and the said Officer or Officers
shall be Impowr'd to Administer the said Oath, and the Oath being
so Administred, shall be Attested by the Officer or Officers who Ad∣ministred
the same, and being Registred by the said Officer or Of∣ficers,

and from thence to be sent to the Port of <HI>London</HI> to be there enter'd
in the general Register of all the Trading Ships belonging to Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The Lord Treasurer, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>England,</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Proposal, which was
Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do propose to the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> That, from and after the Union, there
be one Great-Seal for the United Kingdom of Great-Britain, to be
used for sealing Writs to elect and summon the Parliament of Great-Britain,
and for sealing other Publick and Mandatory Writes,
Publick Acts or Orders of State, and Grants, and such Internments
relating to publick Justice, Policy and Government, as are proper
to be seal'd with a Great-Seal; yet nevertheless a Seal in <HI>Scotland</HI>
shall, after the Union, be always kept, and made use of in all
things relating to Privat Rights and Justice, in the same manner as
the Great-Seal is at this time us'd, but subject to such Regula∣tions
as the Parliament of Great- Britain may hereafter make, and
until such Seal shall be provided, the Great-S al of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall
be used, as at this time, in all things relating to privat Rights and
Justice.</P>

Great-Britain, mid that the same Eases, Pro: mi urns and Draw-backs
be allowed, after the Union, for Encouragement of such as shall Ex∣port
Fishes from <HI>Scotland</HI> beyond Seas, as is now allowed by the
Laws of England, to such as Export the like fishes from Eng∣land.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XI.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debates about the 16 Peers are so clear, and the Que∣stions
and Answers in themselves so direct, That they require
no Explanation; Nor was there any thing considerable pass'd
upon those Heads, which is not express'd in the Minute.</P>
<P>“The settling the different Privileges between the Sitting
Peers for the Time being, and the other Peers, seem'd to be the
main Difficulty, and was quickly Regulated.</P>
<P>“I know it was alledged in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the Privilege of
Peerage being, by this Treaty, extended to the Nobility of Scot∣land,
I mean, as to Protection of their Persons and Estates, was
both a Dishonour and a Disadvantage to them; A Dishonour,
as if they were stooping to accept of an Exemption from an Ho∣nest
Discharge or their Debts, and a Disadvantage, since now,
they being not lyable to Prosecutions for Debt, would obtain no
Personal Credit, whatever their Occasions might be—; And
that a private Gentlemans Bond would now be more Valuable
than a Noblemans, since it could be Sued and made Heretable,
whereby his Estate should become lyable, as well after his Death,
as in his Lifetime, whereas a Noblemans Bond could no way
be pur in Suit.</P>
<P>“However this was, there was no making a Distinction, at a
time when a Treaty was Transacting, to bring all, if possible,
to an Equality of Circumstances, unless the <HI>English</HI> Nobility,
should have laid themselves and their Estates open, to the com∣mon
Process of the Law, which had been Inconsistent with their
Constitution, and much more with their Convenience.</P>
<P>“I have not meddled with the frequent Proposals, Answers
and Replyes about the Salt Tax, as a Thing I shall speak more
at large to, when I shall observe upon the Minutes of Parlia∣ment,
where that Matter received a New Turn, and all these
Scruples were effectually settled under one Head of Limitation,
and so are needless to be Repeated here.</P>
<P>“It may be needful to Explain something here, of the Debate
and Restriction about Shipping; The English Commissioners
had in their View the Act of Navigation, which, in <HI>England,</HI>
obliges all the Ships Employed to and from England, except
only such Ships as Import any Thing of the Growth or Manu∣facture
of their own Country, to which those Ships belong, to
be English built Ships, and the Mariners, or Sailers Navigating
the same, to be Two Thirds, at least, Natural Born Subjects
of England.</P>
<P>“Now as <HI>Scotland</HI> of Life Years wanting Timber, or other Ma∣terials
for Building, had but very few Ships of their own Build∣ing,
they carryed on the greatest part or their Forreign Trade
in ships built in Holland, Hamburgh, the Baltick, or other For∣reign
Parts; Wherefore the English Commissioners, in order
<PB N="82" REF="190"/>
to set Bounds to the Introducing of Forreign Bottoms into our
Trade as Free Ships, offered the Clause as in the Minute.</P>
<P>“It was moved in the <HI>Scots</HI> Behalf, to give a certain time for
the clearing up this Point, and that a Ship should be deemed
Free at the time of the Union, if part of her was owned by
<HI>Scots</HI> Men at the time of the Union, because as the <HI>Scots</HI> Traded
much to Holland, so the Merchants of Amsterdam, Camphere,
&amp;c. were in part Owners, in Company with the <HI>Scots</HI> Mer∣chants,
of many of their Ships; And therefore it was thought
hard, That if the Major Part of the Owners were Scots Men,
yet the Ship should be deemed forreign, which would either
oblige the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant to buy the Remainder, at what Price
the Forreign Owner pleased to Exact, or oblige him to sell and
cast off the Ship, which he could not carry on his Trade with∣out.</P>
<P>“But as this would have clashed directly with the Act of Navi∣gation,
and created innumerable Inconveniencies in Trade, it
was lest out; for then forreigners had had no more to do, but
to Interest <HI>Scots</HI> Men in a Moiety of their Ships, and so have
made great Numbers of Forreign built Bottoms have pass'd for
Free Ships in Britain, to an Inexpressible Damage of the English
Trade.</P>
<P>“This Point therefore being given up, it remained only to
dispure the time, at which any Vestel belonging entirely to Scots
Owners should be deemed Free; The English Commissioners put it,
to be at the time of Signing the Treaty, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners
insisted on the time of the Commencement of the Union; But
the Reasons given against that Latitude were so Convincing,
that the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners Complyed with it.</P>
<P>“The principal Reason was, That, in that Interval of time,
the Merchants of either Kingdom might furnish themselves with
great Numbers of Forreign Ships, which being built cheaper
than the English, and becoming Free by this Clause, would be
a great Prejudice to Trade; And seing it was the known Inte∣rest
of both Kingdoms, to Encourage the Building of Merchants
Ships among themselves, it could not but be the interest of both
to prevent the Crowding in of Forreign Ships among them.</P>
<P>“This was Debated again in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and,
after long Discourse, obtain'd to pass with this small Alterati∣on,
the Time of Ratifying, instead of the Time of Signing the
Union, as shall appear in its place.</P>
<P>“The Affairs of the Standards, Weights and Measures, were
Things admitted no Debate in either Kingdom, so need no Ob∣servation;
I shall give a Scale of the Difference hereafter, be∣cause
it may be useful in Matters of Trade.</P>
<P>“The Affair of the Coin made somu Noise Abroad among the
People, but the Answering the Loss of private Persons out of
the Equivalent put a Stop to it, and it was also Adjusted with∣out
any Hesitation.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="191"/>
“Neither was there any Difficultie before them about the Affair
of the Great-Seal of Britain, or of any Regulations with respect
to a Seal in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the passing such Acts, either relating to
private Rights or publick Justice; but it appeared so equal, that
it made no Difficulties, even at the time of the Parliament in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> when most of the other Heads admitted such strong
Debates.</P>
<P>“But the next thing proceeded upon, was the Calculation of
the Equivalent, which a Committee had been busy in settling,
with Clerks appointed to Examine the Calculations, and State
them for the Commissioners, the Result of which was now be∣fore
them.</P>
<P>The Lord Treasurer in Name of the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>England</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Proposal, which was
Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners of the two Kingdoms having appointed
a Committee consisting of a like Number of each Commission for
adjusting the Equivalent to be allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> for what that
Kingdom should become lyable to Answer towards payment of the
Debts of England, by Reason of their having agreed to bear the
same Duties of Customs and Excsfes upon all Exciseable Liquors;
and the said Committee having frequently met, and after a full en∣quiry
having agreed amongst themselves, and severally Reported to
their respective Commissions, that the Sum of lib. 398085, 10 sh.
was the Equivalent to be Answer ed to <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to the
proportion which the present Customs and Excises in <HI>Scotland</HI> do
bear to the Customs and Excises upon Exciseable Liquors in <HI>England;</HI>
and the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> having considered and
Examined the said Report, Do agree to the said Sum.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having also insisted, That
after the Union the Kindgom of <HI>Scotland</HI> becoming lyable to the
English Duties of Customs and Excises upon exciseable Liquors, as
well upon that account as upon the account of the increase of Trade
and People, which will be the happy consequence of the said Uni∣on,
the said two Revenues will much improve, of which no present
Valuation can be made, Yet nevertheless for the Reasons aforesaid
there ought to be a proportionable Equivalent allowed to <HI>Scotland;</HI>
The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree that after the Union
there shall be an Accompt kept of the said Duties arising in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
to the end it may appear what ought to be allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> as a
proportionable Equivalent for such proportion of the said Increase,
according to the calculation aforesaid, as shall be applicable to the
payment of the Debts of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for Scotland having also by their Paper
delivered the 21st Instant, propos'd that the Rights and Priviledges
of the Company in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Trading to Affrica and the Indies, do
continue after the UNION, or if the Privileges of that Company
be judg'd inconvenient for the Trade of the United Kingdom. That
<PB N="84" REF="192"/>
the private Rights of the said Company in <HI>Scotland</HI> be purchas'd
from the said Proprietors; The Lords Commissioners for England
in Answer thereto, say they are of opinion, That the continuance
of that Company is inconsistent with the Good of Trade in the U∣nited
Kingdom and consequently against the interest of Great-Britain;
And therefore, they insist that it ought to be determined;
But the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> being sensible that the Mis∣fortunes
of that Company have been the occasion of Mis-understand∣ings,
and Unkindnesles between the two Kingdoms, and thinking
it to be above all things desireable, that upon the Union of the
Kingdoms, the Subjects of both may be entirely United in affection;
Do therefore with that regard may be had to the Expences and
Losses of the particular Members of the said Company, in the man∣ner
hereafter-mentioned, and they hope when the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> have considered how Generally that underraking
was enter'd upon in <HI>Scotland</HI> and consequently how universal that
Loss was they will readily agree to the Proposal.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for England also think it of much con∣sequence
to England, that it mould be agreed in this Treaty after
what manner the Equivalent (which will amount to a great Sum
payable upon and after the Union) is to be paid and applyed, and
being extremely desirous to bring the Treaty to a speedy Conclusion,
and in order to that, as soon as may be, to settle and six the mat∣ter
of the Equivalent, and the Application thereof; Do agree as fol∣lows,
and do also make the following Proposals to the Lords Com∣missioners
for <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree, That upon com∣pleating
the Union, the said Sum of Lib. 398085 10sh. being agreed
upon as the Equivalent for <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be granted to Her Majesty
for that use.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do also agree, that upon
the Account to be kept as aforesaid of the Improvement of the Re∣venue
of Customs and Excises upon Exciscable Liquors in <HI>Scotland</HI>
after the Union, there shall be answered to <HI>Scotland</HI> an Equivalent
in proportion to such part of the said increase as shall be applicable
to the payment of the Debts of England.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do also agree, That an
Equivalent shall be Answer ed to <HI>Scotland</HI> for such other parts of the
English Debts as that Kingdom may hereafter become lyable to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
by reason of the Union.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do propose for the further,
and more effectual Answering the several ends hereafter mention'd
and propos'd. That from and after the Union, the whole increase of
the Revenue of Customs and Excises upon Exciseable Liquors in Scot∣land,
over and above what the said Revenues do now yeeld, shall
go and be applyed for the Term of seven years, to the uses hereafter
mentioned.</P>
<P>And Upon the said Agreements and Proposal, The Lords Com∣missioners
for <HI>England</HI> do further propose, That Her Majesty be Im∣powr'd
<PB N="85" REF="193"/>
to appoint Commissioners, who shall be accomptable to the
parliament of Great-Britain, for disposing the said Sum of 398085
Lib. 10. to be granted as afresaid, and also of all other Moneys
which shall arise upon the Agreements and Proposal aforesaid to the
purposes following. 1. That out of the said Sum of 398085 Lib.
10. all the publick Debts of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and also the
Capital Stock or Fund of the <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Company of Scot∣land
together with the interest for the said Capital Stock, after the
rate of 5 p. cent. p. Annum from the respective times of payment
thereof shall be payed, and that immediately upon such payment of
the said Capital Stock and Inrerest, the said Company shall be
Dissolved and shall cease; Provided nevertheless that from
the time of passing the Act, for raising the said Summe of 398085
Lib. 10. The said Company shall neither Trade nor give licence
to Trade.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do further propose, That
after payment of the said publick Debts, and Refounding the said
Capital Stock in manner aforesaid, the overplus of the said Sum of
39085 Lib. 10 sh. And also the whole improvement of the Re∣venue
of Customs and Excites upon Exciseable Liquors (above the
present value) which shall arise during the Term of seven years,
from the commencement of the Union as aforesaid, together with
the Equivalent which shall become due upon account of the Im∣provement
of the Customs and Excises on Liquors in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after
the said seven years, and all other Sums, which according to the
Agreement aforesaid may become payable to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by way of
Equivalent, for what that Kingdom shall hereafter become lyable to
Answer for the Debts of England, may be applyed in the manner
following.</P>
<P>That out of the same what consideration shall be sound necessary
to be had for any Losses which privat Persons may sustain in Re∣duceing
the Coyn of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Standard of <HI>England</HI> (menti∣on
whereof is made in another Paper delivered by the Lords Com∣missioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> the 21st Instant) may be made good, and
afterwards the same shall be wholly Employed towards encouraging
and promoting the Fisherys, and such other Manufacturys and Im∣provements
in that part of Britain called <HI>Scotland,</HI> as may most
conduce to the general Good of the United Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XII.</HEAD>
<P>“In making Observations on the Affair of the <HI>Affrican</HI> Compa∣ny,
it may be necessary to state that Part of the <HI>African</HI> Affair,
as belongs to this immediate Debate.</P>
<P>“The African Company having, as has been related in the
beginning of this Work, met with several Disasters and Mis∣fortunes,
in some of which, the National Interests of <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Scotland,</HI> had but too much clashed, and which had been
the Occasion of a great deal of ill Blood between them, it was
<PB N="86" REF="194"/>
absolutely necessary, in the bringing to pass an Union between
the Kingdoms, to remove every Occasion of Discontent; and
particularly every Interfering Interest, being Inconsistent with a
compleat entire Union, the Thing now aim'd at, there was
therefore an absolute Necessity to Remove or Reconcile every
Thing of that Nature, as tar as possible, before such an Union
could be made.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners were in the right to propose, That
their <HI>African</HI> Company should be supported and defended as a
private Right, all Rights-and Privileges of Corporations and
Companies being to be Reserved; And this having been a
National Concern, in which they had but made an Essay, and
miscarrying in their first Attempt, had let it rest for a while,
but had Various Prospects of Future Projects and Attempts;
It could not be equal, to oblige them to quit These Prospects,
and their Legal Right to a Trade to the Indies, which was so
Valuable in other Countries, and which might in Time Restore
their Losses; and therefore they proposed the Reserving to
themselves the Charters, Rights and Privileges of their African
and Indian Company.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Case of <HI>England</HI> made this Impracti∣cables
for, whereas there was already a Company Establish∣ed
in England, formed, and, with great Difficulty United in∣to
One, from two Contending and Powerful Companies, And
that These were entirely supported, and depended upon their
Exclusive Charters, by which no other Persons could Trade to
the Indies but themselves, of by their Permission: If this
Company Established in <HI>Scotland</HI> had continued after the Union,
the Article far a Free Intercourse of Trade between the Nations,
had immediately open'd to them all the Ports of England, for
their Ships and Goods; And it had been, in Event, a perfect
laying open the East-India Trade, or at lead; Erecting a New
East-India. Company in Britain, which, whoever knows the Diffi∣culty
of Uniting the last Contending Companies, and the Injury
they did both their Trade in particular, and the whole Nation
of <HI>England</HI> in general, before they could be brought together,
will acknowledge, is not to be born within Britain.</P>
<P>“This the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners foresaw, and therefore very
frankly proposed the Alternative, <HI>viz.</HI> That if the Priviledges of
that Company shall be judg'd Inconvenient for the Trade of the Rest
of the United Kingdom, that the private Rights of the said Com∣pany
in <HI>Scotland</HI> be purchas'd from the Proprietors.</P>
<P>“This was the least that could be demanded; for, if <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
found it Impracticable to suffer, or Intolerable to their
Two Companies to bear, it was but reasonable, that the
Company, who. was to quit its Right, should have Satisfaction
for parting with that Right. And the next Question was there∣fore,
what must this Purchase be, and who must pay it, and
this was no small Point.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="195"/>
“<HI>England</HI> was so clear and fair in all their Offers as to the
Equivalent, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners were, in a manner, pre∣vented
in every thing they had to ask; The Offers of a full Recom∣pence
in Money, advanc'd for all the Money which <HI>Scotland</HI> should
be charged to pay towards the English Debts, and of applying
the whole remaining Revenue of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Encouraging
Trade, and Employing the Poor, had in it so much Evidence of
the hearty Design of the English Commissioners, to consider every
Thing for the Good of the Community after the Union. That it
could bear but little Objection: It seem'd therefore but reasonable,
That the <HI>Scots</HI> should, at their own Charge, put themselves in
Condition of Uniting. That is That, if they had any National
Obstruction, which was Inconsistent with the design'd Union,
and without Removing which it could not be made, that then
the Removing that Difficulty should ly at their Door.</P>
<P>“It was this kind of Reasoning, which directed the Purchase
of the private Rights of the African Company in Scotland to be
made out of the Equivalent Money; And to which, after very
little Debate, as you may see, both Parties agreed.</P>
<P>Then the Question was, What Price should These private
Rights be purchased at; And this would have met with threat
Difficulties, some magnifying the Prospects of their Company
in Trade, as a Thing not to be Valued, and which alone was
able to Enrich their Nation; Others lessening it in the most
contemptible manner, as a Thing that not only had now, but
never had any Prospect or Possibility of Success, as it had been
managed. Of which by it self—.</P>
<P>“But the Method proposed appeared so fair, That it left no
Room for Objection, it being a Valuation from the True Origi∣nal,
<HI>viz.</HI> That every private Adventurer should be put in the
same Condition as he was in at first, supposing his Money put
out to Interest—; So that every Man was to receive his full
Original Capital Stock which he had at first: advanced, and 5
per Cent. Interest to the Time of Payment.</P>
<P>“Nor can I forbear saying. That the Surprize of this Offer had
Various Effects upon the People; for (his Stock was a dead
Weight upon a great many Families, who wanted vary much
the Return of so much Money: It had not only been long dis∣burs'd,
but it was, generally speaking, abandoned to Despair,
and the Money given over for loft; Nay, so entirely had People
given up all Hopes, That a Man might even, after this Con∣clusion
of the Treaty, have bought the Stock at 10 Pound for an
Hundred; And after all this, to find the whole Money should
come in again with Interest for the Time, was a Happy Surprize
to a great many Families, and took off the Edge of the Oppo∣sition,
which some People would otherwise have made to the
Union in general.</P>

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having considered the

<P>The Lords Commissioners who are on the part of <HI>England</HI> of the

last, to consider Matters to them referr'd, having Reported to us
the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> That the said Committee
had referred to Six Persons the Stating, in what Proportion the pre∣sent
Customs of <HI>Scotland</HI> as now lett, do bear to the several
Branches of that Revenue in <HI>England,</HI> and also in what proportion
the present Excise upon Liquors in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as now lett, do bear to
the several Branches of that Revenue in <HI>England,</HI> in order to the
<PB N="95" REF="203"/>
stating of the Equivalent, that would become due to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for
so much of the said two Revenues as should be apply'd towards the
payment of the Debts of <HI>England,</HI> which was accordingly done as
in N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. And that the said Six Persons had also by their Lordships
directions prepared a Calculation, what so much of the said two Re∣venues
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as should be applyed towards payment of the
Debts of <HI>England,</HI> would produce of ready Money as in N 2. The
said six Persons had also calculated, that in case the said two Re∣venues
should encrease (above what they are now Let for) 1000
<HI>Lib.</HI> on the Customs, and 1000 <HI>Lib.</HI> on the Excise, how much there∣of
would contribute towards the payment of the Debts of <HI>England,</HI>
and for which <HI>Scotland</HI> is to have an Equivalent, as in N<SUP>o</SUP> 3. All
which Papers their Lordships having now laid before us; We the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree to the same, and that all
the said Papers be enter'd by the respective Secretarys in the Journals
of this Treaty.</P>
<P>Adjourn'd to <HI>Tuesday</HI> the <HI>9th</HI> Instant <HI>5</HI> in the Evening.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>“I might make Observations here upon the manner of stating
the Equivalent; for in a Matter of that Moment it is not to be
doubted but there were various Judgments past, Projects found∣ed,
and Proposals made on every side, for the bringing this
difficult Thing to bear, in which every body spoke according
to their several Judgments, and as I noted before, every Man
supposed this such an insuperable Difficulty, that it would
never have been mastered in the Treaty, and therefore various
Schemes were made.”</P>
<P>“The main Difficulty, as I have hinted already, was the Proposal
it self of an Equivalent, and indeed without this it had been
impossible to bring this Union to a Conclusion; Nor was the
way ever seen clear towards a Union till the project of an Equi∣valent
was thought of; The Manner of it therefore might con∣sequently
be supposed to introduce equal Difficulty, some pro∣posed
it in an Annual payment of Interest to <HI>Scotland</HI> of <HI>lib.
30000 per Annum,</HI> or <HI>600000 lib.</HI> in Money, to be stated at <HI>5
lib. per Cent.</HI> ”</P>
<P>“But the People that made these Proposals, built upon the
Supposition, of the <HI>Scots</HI> Revenues paying a far greater share of
the <HI>English</HI> Debt, than upon a further search into the several
Articles, appeared probable; and at best built upon imaginary
Encreases on one side, and imaginary Expences on the other, as
will appear by the following Schemes of the improved Taxes of
<HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union.”</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="204"/>

<P>“I should not Record this Imaginary and Erroneous Scheme,
but to illustrate and shew the Necessity and Original of the
True; perhaps the Author of this Scheme had as near a View as
any body at that time of Day could come at.”</P>
<P>“But when the Commissioners on both sides came to Form
themselves into a Committee to state this so, as that neither
Kingdom might object, they found themselves under a Necessity
of keeping a <HI>Medium</HI> between two dangerous Extremes, That
the <HI>Scots</HI> on one Hand might not plead a Disparity of Allow∣ance,
and consequently deny its being an Equivalent, which
would overthro' the Foundation; And the <HI>English</HI> might not
complain they were wrong'd in the Calculation, and paid more
for the Proportion than it was worth.”</P>
<P>“To bring this therefore to a Head, they went back to the
Principles, which was an infallible Rule to Judge by, and taking
the Customs and Excises of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were the only Taxes
which Could be appropriated to the payment of <HI>English</HI> Debts,
and stating them at the present produce as they were then
Farmed out, they advance to the <HI>Scots</HI> as much Money as the
annual Produce of those Sums appropriated as above comes
to—. This was capable of a most exact Calculation to the
least Fraction, and was exactly cast up as in the Tables an∣nexed
to the Minutes, which I have also Printed, that Posterity
may see how exactly this Matter was carry'd between both, and
may for ever be satisfied with the Justice which was done them
in either Nation.”</P>
<P>“The Calculation being made exactly for the present Revenue
of <HI>Scotland;</HI> It was not for the Commissioners to attempt a real
Advance upon imaginary Encreases, which might or might not
come to pass, as Trade might or might not be Enlarged by <HI>the
Union.</HI> But to remove all possible Objections, they first State
how much shall be appropriate to the payment of the <HI>English</HI>
Debts, upon every Thousand Pound that any of the Revenues
of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall thereafter advance, and then appointing an
exact Account to be kept of such Advance; Agree, that <HI>Scotland</HI>
shall be Re-imbursed by way of Equivalent, as much as shall be
paid out of such advanced Revenues, and that Commissioners be
<PB N="97" REF="205"/>
appointed both to see the Calculations made and Accompts kept,
and also to pay the said Equivalent as it becomes due.”</P>
<P>“This was so clear, so just, and so unexception'd a Method,
that it could admit of no Dispute, and brought the most in∣tricate
part of the whole Treaty to a happy conclusion.”</P>
<P>“The Question about the manner of payment was now all that
remained, and the Proposal for an <HI>Annual</HI> Interest found no room;
for this had been but the same thing with letting the Revenues
of <HI>Scotland</HI> pay themselves as it came in; Nor could it enable
<HI>Scotland</HI> to answer the Incumbrances which were then upon
her, and which it behoved her to clear her self of to make way
for the Union, such as the paying of, or purchasing the Capital
Stock of the <HI>African</HI> Company, &amp;c. making good the deficien∣cy
of the Coin, paying the publick Debts, &amp;c.”</P>
<P>“To solve this, the Calculation being made, they proposed
to Estimate the Value of the Proportions which <HI>Scotland</HI> would
so pay of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, and reduce them to a Rate in pre∣sent
Money, according to the common Estimates then current
for advanced payment to the Government; and that then <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
should pay the full Sum down in ready Money, the payment
to become due upon the signing the Union.”</P>
<P>“This was thought not only Just, but Advantageous to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and indeed Necessary to her, to supply the Stagnation
which might be upon the current Cash of that Kingdom on the
Alteration of the Coyn, and to cause Money to circulate among
them, which was then much wanted.”</P>
<P>“This part of the Calculation I have therefore caused to be
Printed here as it stands in the Books of the Commissioners, to
clear up the Particulars, and to convince the nicest Objectors
with what Exactness and equal proportion every part of this
Transaction was carried on.”</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIV.</HEAD>
<P>“The Affair of the <HI>African</HI> Company and the Equivalent being
thus settled, there was nothing now before them, but things of
small Moment, and easily a adjusted, such as the Quartering of
the Arm, Uniting the Crosses and Settling the Banners,
Ensigns and Trophies of the United Kingdoms, Regulating
Weights and Measures, the Methods of Calling and Regulat∣ing
the Parliament, and the Summoning the Members, and the
like; In all which, the Commissioners on both sides had little
<PB N="102" REF="210"/>
more to do, than to propose and Agree, so all things proceed∣ed
Smoothly and Easily; And the Articles, being finished, were,
with all possible Speed, Engrossed, Signed, and Presented to
the Queen, in manner, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute, the Treaty having
continued from the 16th <HI>of</HI> April to the 23d of July inclu∣sive,
being so happily Finished, as gave an Universal Satisfac∣tion
to all the Kingdom, and at first, to all Appearance, was
received with equal Joy in either part of the Island.”</P>

Speech, and presented to Her Majesty one of the Sign'd and Seal'd
Instruments or Writings, containing the Articles of Union on the
part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<OPENER>May it please Your Majesty,</OPENER>
<P>WE the Commissioners Appointed by Your Majesty, in pursu∣ance
of the Act of Parliament pass'd in Your Kingdom of
<HI>England,</HI> to Treat concerning an Union of the Two Kingdoms, with
the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> do (according to our Duty) Hum∣bly
beg Leave to present to Your Majesty these the Effects of our
Continued and Faithful Endeavours towards that End.</P>
<P>They are the Articles agreed upon between Your Commissioners
of both Kingdoms, as the Terms or Conditions, upon which the
intended Union is to take place, if Your Majesty, and the Parlia∣ments
of both Kingdoms shall think sit to Approve and Confirm
the same.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="211"/>
In these we have come to an Agreement on every point, we Judg'd
Necessary to Effect a compleat and lasting Union, and we have En∣deavoured
not to stir into any Matter we had Reason to think was
not so.</P>
<P>And altho' we have Unanimously carried this Treaty thus far,
purely from a Conviction, that we have done therein to GOD,
Your Majesty, and our Countries Good Service; Yet we are far
from thinking, that what we have done will or ought to be of any
Weight or Authority elsewhere; but do most entirely submit these
our Labours to the High Wisdom of Your Majesty, and both Your
Parliaments, to stand or fall by the Reason, Justice, and publick
Utility on which they are founded.</P>
<P>Your MAJESTIES Royal Presence and Seasonable Admoni∣tions
to us at the fittest Junctures were (we most Thankfully
Acknowledge) a very great Encouragement and Assistance to us in
the Difficulties we met with.</P>
<P>Your Majesties Glory is already perfect, and the finishing this
Work is all that is wanting to compleat as well as secure the
Happiness of so great a People, as Your Subjects may now without
any arrogance pretend to be.</P>
<P>May Your Majesty Live not only to give a Sanction of this Uni∣versal
Blessing to all Your People, but also to see in a long and
prosperous Reign over us the many Immediat (or near) Good
Effects of it; But as for that great and main Consequence of it, for
which Your Majesty is making by a most Gracious and Charitable
Foresight, this only Effectual Provision, I mean the continuance of
Peace and Tranquility in this Island, upon a descent of the Crown
instead of that Blood shed and Distraction which would probably
follow upon the fatal Division of it.</P>
<P>May we be so happy, as never in our days, to Experiment the
fitness of these Measures your Majesty is now taking for that end?
But may late, very late Posterity only in that respect reap the Ad∣vantage
of them.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Name of the Lords Commis∣sioners
for <HI>Scotland,</HI> made the following Speech, and presented to
Her Majesty one of the Sign'd and Scal'd Instruments or Writings,
containing the Articles of Union on the part of Scotland.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<OPENER>May it please Your Majesty,</OPENER>
<P>THE Commissioners appointed by Your Majesty for the King∣dom
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to Treat of an Union of Your two King∣doms
of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> have Commanded me to re∣turn
Your Majesty their most humble and dutyful Acknowledgments,
for the Honour Your Majesty has Conferr'd on them, in Employing
them to Negotiat this most important Affair, which is of the greatest
Consequence to all Your Majesties Subjects.</P>
<P>We have endeavoured to discharge this Trust with all Fidelity,
and are now come humbly to lay before Your Majesty, the Articles
and Conditions of Union which we have Treated of, and agreed
<PB N="104" REF="212"/>
upon, and do submit them to Your Majesties Royal Considerati∣on.</P>
<P>It is a great satisfaction to us, that what we have concluded in
this Matter, has been done with Unanimity; and we must own,
that the knowledge we had of Your Majesties great Concern for
Uniting Your two Kingdoms, and the Earnestness with which Your
Majesty has been most Graciously pleased to Recomend it, hath en∣abled
us to bring this Treaty to a happy and speedy Conclusion, to
the mutual Satisfaction of the Commissioners on both sides; and we
shall esteem it our greatest Happiness, if what we have prepared be
acceptable to Your Majesty, and Ratified by the Parliaments of both
Kingdoms, without which, what we have done can be of no Au∣thority.</P>
<P>An Union of the two Kingdoms has been long wish'd for, it be∣ing
so necessary for Establishing the lasting Peace, Happiness and
Prosperity of both Nations; And tho it has been frequently Endea∣voured
by Your Majesties Royal Predecessors without the desir'd Suc∣cess;
Yet the Glorious Successes, with which GOD has Bless'd Your
Majesties Endeavours for the Happiness of Your People, make us
Hope that this Great Work is Reserv'd to be accomplished in Your
Majesties Reign.</P>
<P>After which, Her Majesty was Graciously pleased to make
the following Speech.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Give you many Thanks for the great Pains you have taken in
this Treaty, and am very well pleas'd to find your Endeavours and
Applications have brought it to so Good a Conclusion. The Par∣ticulars
of it seem so Reasonable, That I hope they will meet with
Approbation in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms. I wish there∣fore,
That my Servants of <HI>Scotland</HI> may lose no time in going down
to propose it to my Subjects of that Kingdom; And I shall always
look upon it as a particular Happiness, if this Union (which will
be so great a Security, and Advantage to both Kingdoms) can be
Accomplish'd in my Reign.</P>

What Difficultys it met with afterwards, how it became the

Or which Duties, an Account shall be kept, to the end it

And generally, That an Equivalent shall be Answered to
<HI>Scotland</HI> for such Parts of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, as <HI>Scotland</HI> may hereaf∣ter

<HEAD>OF THE
Carrying on of the TREATY in
SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>AND thus the Treaty at <HI>London</HI> ended, which, tho' it
seemed very perfect in all its, parts, and as abundance of
People thought, could not want any Corrections, yet as by
the sequel appeared, the moll difficult Work was yet to do.</P>
<P>I know some were of the Opinion, that this Treaty could admit
of no Additions, Amendments or Alterations, and that the Words
in the respective Acts of Parliament previous to it, (which said,
Provided that nothing in this Treaty should be binding to either Nation,
unless it shall be Ratified in the respective Parliaments of both Kingdoms)
Implyed that the respective Parliaments had no Power to enter into
the Articles separately and apart, but only debating on the whole,
to Approve or Disapprove, Ratifie or Reject it as a Treaty.</P>
<P>I shall hot Trouble the Reader with any of the Reasons given
for this Notion, nor make any other Remark upon it than this,—That
the People who were for this Opinion were of two forts,
and both such as the Nations on either side, were very little behol∣ding
to.</P>
<P>1. They were such, who having no great Concern for the
essential part of the Treaty, <HI>viz. The Good of their Country,</HI> were for
taking all upon Trust, and concerned not themselves either with the
Event, or with the Circumstances, and therefore without any Dif∣faculty
were willing to put all upon a meer plurality of Voices, not
much regarding whether it went this way or that. I shall be
Kinder to these Gentlemen than to Record their Names, or leave
them (so eminent in Folly) to be known by Posterity, lest their
Children should be told hereafter how little their Country was obliged
to them.</P>
<P>2. The other fort, whose Follies ought equally to be concealed,
I mean as to Naming them, were such who were willing to have
them put to the Question in Gross; Presuming,</P>
<P>1. That either their being so Voted, would hand them down
Clogg'd with so many Inconveniencies as would in Time force
the Nations to break the Articles, or bringing them to the
necessity of tailing to pieces, the Treaty should Dissolve of
Course. Or,</P>
<P>2. That being Voted in general, with so many apparent Dif∣faculties
as they pretended to see in them, they would infallibly
be lost in this Parliament and so as formerly, the whole Treaty
come to nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="226"/>
That these People aim'd not at shortning the Labour, but at
cutting off the Union it self, is manifest, and it was but too appa∣rent
afterwards; since generally speaking, they were all against the
Treaty in its future Debates, and that in every Article; by which
they plainly made it appear, that they did not argue to much to
Rectify and Amend as to Destroy, not so much to make the Articles
more Perfect, or more Explicit, more Advantageous, or more
Satisfying, but to annihilate them as Articles, and dissolve the very
Life and Being of the Treaty: And this appeared in that, thro' all
the Debates that happened afterwards, they shew'd themselves equal∣ly
against every Article, and at the same time that they Objected
against things, very seldome concern'd themselves, to propose the
Alternatives, but rather pusht at overthrowing the substance of the
Thing; and if possible, to Urge the most Necessary Articles as im∣practicable
and Inconsistent.</P>
<P>As on the one Hand, this discovered the Design of the Persons to
be <HI>not Amending,</HI> but Destroying the Articles: So it manifestly
exposed their Ignorance, either of their own Strength in <HI>Scottland,</HI> or
of the Strength of their Friends in the South, in both which parts,
(had their weak Politicks prevailed to have put the Treaty in
general to a Vote) they would have lost it by a Majority of Voices,
the generality of both Nations being fully Convinc'd of the absolute
Necessity of a Union, and would rather have Voted it without the
Amendments than have lost it.</P>
<P>If I am ask'd how I prove this, I think I have a very good
Foundation for it.</P>
<P>1. In the Motions first made in the Parliament House in <HI>Scot∣land,
November</HI> 1. 1706, when the Strength of the House, as
they call it, was effectually Tryed.</P>
<P>1. It was Moved that the Parliament now proceed to the
farther and more particular Consederation of the Articles of
the Union, in order to Approve them or not.</P>
<P><HI>Nota,</HI> The Articles had been Read and Discoursed en
severally in the House, and had taken up sixteen Days, barely
Reading them one by one, to hear what one another could say
and to give the Members Light into the particular, <HI>viz.</HI> from
the fifteenth <HI>October,</HI> to the first of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>2. “Upon this first Motion another followed, <HI>viz.</HI> That
the farther Consideration of the Union be yet delayed for some
considerable Time, that the Sentiments of the Parliament of
<HI>England</HI> thereanent be known, and that the Members of
Parliament may Consult those they Represent.”—<HI>Vide</HI> the
Minuts of Parliament, <HI>Numb.</HI> 13. But neither of these Attempts
could be Carried in the House, nor could they bring the Moti∣on
to a Vote in the Terms the Proposal was made, <HI>viz.</HI> Of
Consulting Constituents, or waiting till the <HI>English</HI> Parliament
should Sit.—To both which I shall speak in their Turn.—I
only mention it here, to (how that it was apparent these
Motions proceeded only from a desire to gain Time, which they
<PB N="3" REF="227"/>
thought might furnish a variety of Accidents to disappoint the
whole.—And the many weak Attempts and low Steps some
Gentlemen took, if possible, to delay the proceedings, plainly
shew'd the very juncture of Time when this was doing, was one
of the greatest Unhappinesses, <HI>as they thought it,</HI> which befell
the Party.</P>
<P>2. But I prove this further by the Unanimity of the <HI>English</HI> Par∣liament
in passing the Treaty, and Ratifying without any Amend∣ment,
what they thought they had Clogg'd with so many Inequa∣lities,
on the other side, that it could never go down with them.</P>
<P>I shall further convince the Reader of the manifest Design of
the Party against the Union, at such,—from their
frequent Attempts to Clog the Articles with such Things as
they knew it was impossible the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> could
grant—as a Liberty to Export Wool, &amp;c. different
Draw-backs, and different inhibitions in Trade, differing
and disproportioned Excises, Customs and Taxes, &amp;c. of
which I shall take the Freedom to speak in their Turn.</P>
<P>But being disappointed in these, they found the Parliament of
<HI>England</HI> so Unanimous that they past all their Amendments, some
of which were such, as the Party having meerly Clamour'd the
House into, were really past, not so much for any Respect to their
true Signification, as for the sake of giving some Satisfaction to
Uneasie People.</P>
<P>How much more then the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would have past
the whole Treaty Unaltered, is very evident, and consequenrly 'tis
as plain that these People had taken no aim in their offering to Vote
the Articles in the gross, upon a Presumption that it would be a
mean to make the whole miscarry.</P>
<P>The Treaty being concluded in <HI>England,</HI> and the Commissioners
separated; The next thing was the Meeting of the respective Par∣liaments
of the two Kingdoms for Ratification of the Articles.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> was first, being to meet the third of
<HI>October</HI> 1706.—The Queen was Represented in this Parliament by
the Duke of <HI>Queensberry.</HI>—I know 'tis not the part of a Historian
to make Panegericks, and I think I have given Demonstrations to
the World, as to my self, that I will slatter no Man—But I cannot
but give this Testimony here, that the Prudence, Calmness, Temper
and Moderation of this Noble Person had these two visible Effects.</P>
<P>1. It gave a wonderful Testimony to the Queens Judgment,
and the right Notions she had entertained of the true state,
not of Her Affairs only, but of Her People s that Her Majesty
knew this Work must be carried on, not by too much Fire or
too much Water, neither by want of Zeal or too much Zeal,
That here was an insolent Party to deal with, who must be born
with, not Exasperated, Calm'd not Enraged; That here
would be as much Difficulty required to deal with Friends as with
Enemies, to Reconcile Jarring Interests, Clashing Parties, and
keep all in Temper.—Here was a strong Party for the Union,
<PB N="4" REF="228"/>
but they were made up of several Parties, just come together as
for the Occasion; They were like <HI>Epicurus's</HI> Attoms by a strange
fortuitous Chance of concurring Circumstances brought to joyn
in this, who were perfect Antipodes in all their former measures
and could never agree to act together before; It was not a
Matter of the least Consequence to bring together and keep to
gether, strong and differing Parties, who acted even in this very
Thing, from different Views, and some with directly contrary
Designs,—and it was all the way as Fatiguing to keep some
Gentlemen in suited Temper, for this great Work, as to oppose
the Fire and Fury of those that set themselves against it.—Under
the solid Consideration of all this, and with a full view
of the Difficulties, at least in general, Her Majesty pitches upon
the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> as a Person of Temper, Prudence and
Moderation, unexceptionable in Knowledge of what was before
him, resolute in pursuing it thro' all Difficulties, and of a calm
Courage in all the passive part of it, of which I shall speak
more at large hereafter.</P>
<P>2. It had this particular Advantage, that it was in a great
Measure the only thing that carried this difficult Work on, That
the Duke in all the Heats and Animosities of the Party, in
all the Convulsions of the Kingdom, carried on the Treaty
with Easiness, Temper and extraordinary Conduct, not taking
Advantages of the Rashness and Rudeness of the People, Pity∣ing
rather than apprehending Danger from their Folly, he
kept his hand upon the Work, his Eye upon the principals of
the Opposite Party, he disappointed all their Measures, he let
himself into the Darkest of their Counsels,—he putsued the
main and great Work in hand,—and with a Contempt,
above my power to express, received all their Insults, laught
at their Threatning, Treated them Courteously and Calmly,
under the most intollerable Carriage,—and this under the
supream Conduct, was the only Step by which this great Work
could have been brought to pass.</P>
<P>Had warmer Heads been listned to, had Resentment been pre∣vailing,
had Provocations, almost beyond the power of Flesh and
Blood to bear, been prevailing,—<HI>and I</HI> must own, who was an
Eye Witness to it all, that I often wondred how it was possible to bear
such things; I say, had the Gentlemen of Warmer Heads been
listned to, nay even with strong Reasonings, and from Men of found
Judgments too,—all had been undone, and the Nation had been
in a Flame, we had been destroyed not delivered, the Government
had been dissolved, not United, and Britain had by this time
been the Seat of Blood, not an United and prospering Nation.</P>
<P>But this by the way, the Parliament being to meet, Her Majesties
high Commissioner hastned down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Queen on all
Occasions, expressing Her Hopes that this Treaty would come to a
happy Issue.—It was generally expected it would be received with
the same Chearfulness and Alacrity in scotland, and all our Eyes
were bent upon the Meeting of the Approaching Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="229"/>
In this general Expectation, I cannot forbear hinting here, that
curiosity prest me to take a Journey thither, and being by all
my Friends, to whom I communicated my Design, encouraged, to
I might be useful there to prompt a Work that I was fully
conviced was for the general Good of the whole Island; and
particularly necessary for the strengthning the Protestant Intrest,
I was moved purely on these Accounts to undertake a long Winter, a
Chargeable, and as it proved, a Hazardous Journey.—</P>
<P>I contemn, as not worth mentioning, the Suggestions of
some People, of my being imployed thither, to carry on the In∣terest
of a <HI>Party.</HI>—I have never loved any <HI>Parties,</HI> but,
with my utmost Zeal have sincerely Espouted the Great and Original
Interest of this Nation, and of all Nations, I mean Truth and
Liberty,—and who ever are of that Party, I desire to be with
them.</P>
<P>However, by this Journey, I had the Opportunity of Seeing and
Hearing all the Particulars of the following Transactions, and of
using my best Endeavours to Answer the many, many, and I must
say of some of them, the most srivolous and ridiculous Objections,
formed and improved there with great Industry, against every Article
of the Unions and this is my Reason for mentioning it here, that I
may acquaint Posterity how I came to the Knowledge of what I
Write, and for no Oftentation at all: And as I had the Honour to
be frequently sent for into the several Committees of Parliament,
which were appointed to state Come difficult Points relating to
Equalities, Taxes, Prohibitious, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis for those Gentlemen to
say whether I was useful or not, that's none of my Business here;
but by this means I have the greater Assurance to relate the Circum∣stances
and Fact as it stood before them, and can not be afraid of
being detected in any material Mistake.</P>
<P>And as this is the Reason of my making any mention of my self,
so the Reader cannot but be content to know, from what Foundation
this Relation is handed down to Posterity, and what assurance he
has that the Author he Reads was Capable of giving him a light state
of the Matter.</P>
<P>I have hinted already with what Freedom the Scriblers of the
Age if I may give them that Title, took upon them in the begin∣ing
of this Affair, to Determine what sort of Union was proper to
be Treated of, and every one having vented his Politicks this way
and that way, as his Interest or Party, or particular Imployer
Dictated we thought that Storm had been over; when the
Parliament first Sat down in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the generality of People
seem'd very easy and forward for a Union in general, as what had
long indeed been the desire of the whole Nation; and therefore
the strange Alienation of the Humours of the People, on the general
part of it was the more Wonderful, and the more Unexpected: Of
which, and its Causes, I am now to speak; of the Effects I shall be
more particular hereafter.</P>
<P>On the third of <HI>October</HI> the Parliament met, his Grace Her
Majesties High Commissioner opened the Session according to the
usual Forms.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="230"/>
First Her Majesties Letter to the Parliament was presented to the
House by the High Commissioner, and being received, was Read by
the <HI>Lord Clerk Register,</HI> and is as follows.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ANNE R.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE your Last Meeting, We did Nominat Commissioners
“to Treat of an Union betwixt Our two Kingdoms of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
and <HI>England,</HI> and by their great Care and Diligence,
a Treaty, is happily concluded and laid before Us.”</P>
<P>“We have called You together as soon as Our Affairs could Per∣mit,
That the Treaty may be under Your Consideration, in Pur∣suance
of the Act made in the last Session of Our Parliament
there; and We hope the Terms will be acceptable to You.”</P>
<P>“The Union has been long Desired by both Nations, and We
shall Esteem it as the greatest Glory of Our Reign to have it
now Perfected, being fully perswaded, That it must prove the
greatest Happiness of Our People.”</P>
<P>“An intire and perfect Union will be the solid Foundation of
lasting Peace; It will secure Your Religion, Liberty and Proper∣ty,
remove the Animosities amongst Your Selves, and the Jea∣lousies
and Differences betwixt Our two Kingdoms: It must in∣crease
Your Strength, Riches and Trade, and by this Union the
whole Island being joyned in Affection, and free from all Ap∣prehension
of different Interests, will be enabled to Resist all its
Enemies, support the Protestant Interest every where, and main∣tain
the Liberties of Europe.”</P>
<P>“We do upon this Occasion Renew the Assurances We have
formerly given You, of Our Resolution to maintain the Govern∣ment
of the Church, as by Law Established in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the
Acts of both Parliaments, upon which this Treaty proceeded,
having reserved their respective Governments of the Church in
each Kingdom; the Commissioners have lest that Matter Entire;
and you have now an Opportunity for doing what may be
necessary for Security of Your present Church Government after
the Union within the Limits of SCOTLAND.”</P>
<P>“The support of our Government, and your Own Safety does Re∣quire.
That You do make necessary Provision for Maintaining
the Forces, Ships and Garisons, until the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
shall provide for these Ends in the United King∣dom.”</P>
<P>“We have made choice of our Right Trustie, and Right Entirely
Beloved Cousin and Counsellor, <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> be
Our Commissioner, and Represent Our Royal Person, being well
satisfyed with his Fitness for that Trust, from the Experience
We have of his Capacity, Zeal and Fidelity to Our Service, and
<PB N="7" REF="231"/>
the Good of his Countrey; which, as it hat determined Us in
the Choice, We doubt not but will make him acceptable to
You.”</P>
<P>“We have fully Instructed him in all things We think may fall
under Tour Consideration, and seems to be necessary at pre∣sent:
Therefore We desire that you may give entire Trust and
Credit to him.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“It cannot but be an Encouragement to You to Finish the Union
at this Time, That GOD Almighty has blessed Our Arms,
and those of Our Allies with so great Success, which gives Us the
nearer Prospect of a happy Peace, and with it You will have
the full Possession of all the Advantages of this Union; and
You have no Reason to doubt but the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> will
do what is necessary on their part, after the Readness they have
shown to remove what might obstruct the entering on the Treaty.
We most earnestly Recommend to You Calmness and Unanimity
in this Great and Weighty Affair, That the Union may be
brought to a happy Conclusion, being the only effectual Way to
secure your present and future Happiness, and to Disappoint the
Designs of Our and Your Enemies, who will doubtless on this
Occasion, use their outmost Endeavours to Prevent or Delay this
Union, which must so much Contribute to our Glory, and the
Happiness of Our People; And so We <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id You heartily Fare∣well.

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>This Letter having been twice Read, the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI>
seconded the Queens Letter with the following Speech.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“HER Majesty, by Her Gracious Letter, has acquainted
You, That the Treaty of Union, between the King∣doms
of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> (pursuant to an Act
made in your last Session) has been happily agreed on, which
is now in my Lord Registers Hands, ready to be laid before
You.”</P>
<P>“The Lords Commissioners for this Kingdom, have been Dili∣gent
and Zealous in concerting Just and Reasonable Terms;
and, it must be acknowledged, We met with a very Fair and
Friendly Disposition in the Lords Commissioners on the other
Part.”</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="232"/>
“The Treaty has, with all Humility, been presented to the
Queen, and was most Graciously received; and tho' no Reign
was ever so truly Great, for Wife and Steady Councils, and so
many Important Successes, as that of Her Majesty; yet, you
see, She is pleased to Esteem the Perfecting of this Union, as
the greatest Glory of Her Reign, being the most solid Founda∣tion
of a lasting Security to the Protestant Religion, and the
Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and of Peace and Happiness to Her People.”</P>
<P>“These Reasons, I doubt not, will make the Treaty acceptable
to You; And I perswade my self that you will proceed with
such Calmness and Impartiality, as the Weight of the Subject
Requires, and as becomes so great an Assembly.”</P>
<P>“The Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms were Limited in
the Matter of Church Government; For the Security of Pres∣byterian
Government in this Church, you have the Laws already
made for its Establishment, the Queens Repeated Assurances to
preserve it, and I am Impowered to Consent to what may be
further necessary after the Union.”</P>
<P>“Her Majesty has been pleased to Recommend to You to make
Provision for the Forces, Ships and Garisons, which is very
necessary, the Subsidies granted at Your last Meeting being run
out; so, I doubt not, You will speedily Renew them.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I am not insensible of the Difficulties that attend the Weighty
Character, it has pleased Her Majesty to Honour me with, but
with your favourable Assistance, (upon which I very much
Rely) I hope, by my Zeal and Fidelity for Her Majesties
Service, and the Good of my Countrey, which are inseparable,
to Discharge my Duty on this extraordinary Occasion.”</P>
<P>And this was followed with another Speech by the Earl of <HI>Sea∣field</HI>
Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which I have also inserted
here, as follows</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“IT hath been, and is the great Happiness of this Nation, That
the Queen Our Sovereign, hath always made it the chief
Design of Her Reign, to protect Her Subjects, in the Enjoy∣ment
of all their Rights and Privileges, to Promove their Good,
and to Establish their Peace and Prosperity, upon sure and
lasting Foundations.”</P>
<P>“For these Ends, Her Majesty, in Her most Gracious Letter,
doth, with great Earnestness, Recommend to You the Conclu∣ding
of the Union of the Two Kingdoms, and has plainly and
<PB N="9" REF="233"/>
fully laid before You the great Advantages that this Union must
bring with it to all <HI>BRITAIN,</HI> and in particular to this King∣dom.”</P>
<P>“The Lords Commissioners Named by Her Majesty for this
Kingdom to Treat of this Union, have endeavoured to Dis∣charge
this great Trust, with all Fidelity, and have Agreed to
such Terms and Conditions, as, I hope, shall be found Just,
Honourable and Advantageous: The Treaty has been already
received very Graciously by Her Majesty, and is now ready to be
Reported to you for your Consideration.”</P>
<P>“I do not think it proper at this time to descend into the
particular Articles of the Treaty; I shall only beg leave to say
in general, That it must be of great Advantage to have this
whole Island Unite under one Government, and Conjoyned
Intirely in Interest and Affection, having Equality of all Rights
and Privileges, with a free Communication and Intercourse of
Trade, which must certainly Establish Our Security, Augment
Our Strength, and Increase Our Trade and Riches.”</P>
<P>“We can never expect a more favourable Juncture for Com∣pleating
this Union, than at present, when Her Majesty has not
only Recommended it but Declared, That She will Esteem it
the greatest Glory of Her Reign, to have it perfected; And
when the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> has shown their Inclinations for
it, by Removing all these Obstacles that did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in the way of
the Treaty: And it must also be acknowledged, that the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> did Testify their good Disposition all
along in this Affair: And the Great and Glorious Successes
wherewith GOD has Blessed Her Majesties Arms, and those of
Her Allies, give us the Hope of a Near and Advantageous Peace,
whereby we will be put in the Possession, and attain to the full
Enjoyment of all the Liberties and Privileges of Trade, now
offered by the Treaty.”</P>
<P>“The Commissioners of both Sides, have only Treated of such
Things as concern the Civil Government, Liberties, Privileges,
Trade, and Taxes; but found themselves Limited as to the
Church-Government, that being Reserved to each Kingdom by
the respective Acts of Parliament, upon which the Treaty pro∣ceded:
And you have now not only the Laws already made,
with Her Majesties most Gracious Repeated Assurances, for
maintaining and continuing Presbyterian Church Government
within this Kingdom; But this further Opportunity of making
such Conditions and Provisions, as sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be found Necessary for
its Security, after the Conclusion of this Union, within the Li∣mits
of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> ”</P>
<P>“Her Majesty Recommends to You to provide the necessary Sup∣plies
for the Troops, Carisons and Ships; The Funds formerly
given are expired: And therefore I doubt not, but you will
easily comply with what is so plainly Necessary for the Preserva∣tion
of the publick Safety, and preventing the Designs of Ene∣mies
now in time of War.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="10" REF="234"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“Since We have now the Opportunity of Establishing for Our
Selves and Our Posterity, by this Union with <HI>England,</HI> all that
concerns Our Religion and Liberties, together with the most
valuable Privileges of Trade; I am hopeful, that You will
proceed to the Consideration of the Articles of the Treaty, in
such manner as shall bring it to the desired Conclusion, and it
cannot but tend to the lasting Honour of this Session of Parlia∣ment,
to have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o happily finished this most Important and Weigh∣ty
Matter.”</P>
<P>I choose to place these Speeches here, rather than in the <HI>Appen∣dix,</HI>
because they so immediatly relate to the Story, and to the Con∣tinuance
of the Thread of the Story, which now comes to be Dis∣coursed
of, that I thought they could not be so properly Transposed.</P>
<P>I shall not enter here into the particular Vote of every Day, hav∣ing
Abstracted those things by way of Journal, in another part of the
Work, with Notes upon them, drawn from my own Observation,
and from the generous Assistance of many Honourable Gentlemen
present in the very Occurrences of every Day, and of Impartial Un∣byassed
Judgment in the Affair it self;—But one thing I must
remark here, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The first thing the House did, after the Speeches above, was to
call for the Treaty of the Union, as it was drawn up and signed by
the Commissioners,—and having caused it to be Read in
the House.—Upon some general Debate, which lasted not long,
it was Ordered to be Printed, and Copies to be Delivered to the
Members of Parliament, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>Till this very Day all things had gone on well, and the Peo∣ple
in general were very well pleased with the Thoughts of the
Union—They had not yet had Subject for the Turbulent Spirits
to work upon, and having in general only Discoursed upon the
Advantages of both sides, which were indeed in themselves visible
enough,—the Clamorous Party which followed had not
Concerted their Measures, from what Topicks to work upon the
Humours of the People.</P>
<P>No sooner then were the Articles printed, and put into the
Hands of the People,—but the Gentlemen, who set themselves
up against them, began to Preach upon the general Heads, as
their Humour and Talent instructed them, in order to possess the
People against the Particulars.</P>
<P>I cannot but distinguish here between the several Parties that now
opposed the Union: In my Observation there were Four several sorts
of People, who were against this Treaty, and who, either within
Doors, or without, either in Parliament, in Commission, or in Conver∣sation,
joyned to Oppose, Clamour at, or Object against the Union;
<PB N="11" REF="235"/>
and 'tis really necessary here to distinguish of them, that when I
talk, <HI>as I shall have frequent Occasion in the Process of this Story,</HI> of
the Opposers, and the Parties Opposing, it may, by the man∣ner
of their Opposing, be distinguisht who is mean't; For I
shall not name Persons in my Discourse of those things, not think∣ing
it necessary to make this History a Satyr upon any one Family,
or Record to Posterity the Steps they took in particular, or their
Reasons for it in this Affair.</P>
<P>Where particular Actions, more than ordinary publick, have di∣stinguished
Persons, that is their own Act and Deed, and lyes not
at my Door; But to come to the Heads of Parties.</P>
<P>1. There was the profest <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party who Opposed the Treaty,
purely on the Account of the Succession, which they saw evidently
was struck at, and would be effectually fixt, contrary to their Prin∣ciples,
and Eternally Exclusive of the Family they Adhered to;
And these Declared their Aversion to the Union, upon all Occasi∣ons,
publickly and fairly, and, for ought I know, were some of
the honestest of the Enemies to the Treaty.</P>
<P>2. There was the Dissenters from the Church, or the Episcopal
Party, these Opposed the Union also publickly, as it tended in its
Consequences, entirely to settle the Presbyterian Establishment, for
ever to fore-close them, and bar the Door against all possibility of
their Recovering the Government of the Church in the manner they
desired; Since they saw but coo plainly, however blind others
were to it, that this Treaty would so settle the Presbyterian Esta∣blishment
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and so fortify it by Law, that if ever they
should attempt to Recover the Hierarchy of Episcopacy here, even
the very Episcopal Church, their own Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> would
be obliged to Oppose and Suppress them.—And these, so far as
they acted fairly, were honest and open Enemies also to the Union.</P>
<P>3. There was a mistaken People, <HI>I hope I may say so much of my
own Opinion without Offence, for truly I think them mistaken,</HI> who, tho
this Union was calculated entirely for their Safety, and tended to
their indissoluble Establishment, as by the Alarm of their Enemies
was very visibly demonstrated, yet were drawn in by their Fears,
and, I doubt, those Fears too much inflam'd by the Policy and wick∣ed
Artifice of Whisperers and disguised Enemies, to Oppose the U∣nion,
as dangerous to the Church, and as interfereing with the se∣veral
publick Engagements the Nation had entered into.—These,
or most of them, were Honest, Well-meaning, and some of them most
pious and valuable People; However some of them might sin a∣gainst
Moderation in the manner of their Dissenting, and a little
too warmly push on their private Opinions.</P>
<P>Of these People I shall be far from saying any thing severe, for
indeed I cannot think any thing ill of them, I mean as to Inten∣tional
Evil. The Weakness any of them might discover in for∣warding,
countenancing, or giving a Name to the Disorders of the
Times, was rather the Artifice of a Party, who eneavoured to En∣flame
the Nation, and put the Appearance of it upon them, Writ∣ing
<PB N="12" REF="236"/>
their Names upon every Action, and Intituling every Tumult
to their Protection.</P>
<P>But descending to particulars, we shall find, that however forward,
and if their Enemies desire it, I'll venture to say, Indiscreet some
of them might be, in discovering their Sentiments with Warmth in
Conversation, yet upon all publick Occasions their whole Oppositi∣on
of the Treaty was confin'd to legal Applications and peaceable
Endeavours, the Tumult at <HI>Dumfries</HI> only excepted; For as to
that of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> it was wholly <HI>Jacobite,</HI> meer Rabble and Tumult
of that Party, and the poor Blinded Commonality Deluded and
Imposed upon by them, contrary to the Opinions, and without the
Assistance of the People I am speaking of, as will appear hereaf∣ter.</P>
<P>4. But lastly, There was a Party, who Vigorously and Violently,
by all manner of Arti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, Trick, and Underhand Dealing, Opposed
this Union, meerly upon Politick <HI>Enigmas,</HI> Reasons of Party, found∣ed
upon State Principles, Ambition, Emulation, Party-Pick, Pre∣judices,
and a vast variety of unhappy Conjunctions, as serv'd to
Enflame and Agitate their Spirits against it.—And as these were
many of them Gentlemen of the first Rank, and some of them other∣wise
even well enough Affected to both the Succession, and to the
Church; So I shall show more Respect to their Persons, than to
Record them in a Case which I promise my self, they will some
time or other reckon it their Misfortune to have Opposed, and per∣haps
be as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealous now its finished to preserve, as they were before
it was finished, to prevent.</P>
<P>Yet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>must Confess, it was to these Gentlemen we owe the Amu∣sing
the Nation with so many unhappy prejudices, the Alarming
them with such ungrounded Apprehensions, and the Embarking
the Common People against it, meerly on the appearing of such
Men in it, on whose Judgments, and on whole Quality they had
so much Dependence.</P>
<P>These were the Fatal People against this Treaty, these struggled
within Doors and without, these brought to pass that monstrous
Conjunction of Opposite and Discording Parties, and brought the
<HI>Jacobites</HI> to cry out for the Succession, the Episcopal People to
want Security for the Presbyterian Church, the Tory to cry out,
Breach of Covenant, and the well Minded Presbyterian ignorantly
excite the People to a Rabble.</P>
<P>These went about Preaching Opposition in every Shape, just as it
suited the People they had to do with, they undertook to join <HI>Came∣ronian</HI>
and Persecutor; Presbyterian and Papist; Protestant Succession
and <HI>Jacobitism;</HI> Parties as Opposite as the Elements, as Distant as
the <HI>Peles;</HI> And these are the People I desire to be understood of,
when in this Book I talk in general of the Opposers of this Uni∣on,
I Name no Body, whoever the Coat fits, they are Welcome to
wear it.</P>
<P>Having thus described the Parties, it would be endless to enter
into their several Methods, by which they Concurr'd together, <HI>I do
<PB N="13" REF="237"/>
not say Confederated,</HI> for that was Impracticable, their several Aims
consider'd; But all concurr'd nevertheless, to put the Manage∣ment
of this Affair into the following Confusions.</P>
<P>Till the Printing Of these Articles, as I have already noted, the
people were generally very desirous of the Union, as a thing which
tended to the putting an end to all former Animosities, bury∣ing
the ancient Feuds between the Nations, and removing the Ap∣prehensions
good People on both sides had justly entertain'd of
a new Rupture, in case of the Queens Demise.</P>
<P>But no sooner were these Articles printed and dispers'd, but as if
every Body had set themselves to raise Objections, form Scruples, and
find Faults in them, the whole Nation fell into a general kind of
Labour, in Canvassing, Banding, and Cavilling at the Conditions.</P>
<P>1. The poor People were terrifyed with the Apprehensions of
insupportable Taxes, Loss of Imployment, Want of all Things, and
large Payments upon their Salt and Malt.</P>
<P>They were again filled with strange Stories of being sold to the
<HI>English;</HI> their Parliament, Crown, Scepter, and even their Name as
a Nation to be lost, and all carryed to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>2. The Merchants were frighted with printed Schemes of Exces∣sive
Customs and Impositions, and the strangest Projects of Trade
were spread about the Kingdom that ever were seen, which being
gotten into the Heads of those People, who yet, by their Concern
in Trade, one would have thought, in common Charity, should
have known better, were so managed, that it is hardly possible to
believe, such preposterous Notions could prevail upon People, o∣therwise
Knowing enough; Such as, 1. The Profitableness of a
Trade to <HI>France,</HI> tho all the Returns from thence was in perishable
Goods, such as Wines, Brandy, and Trifles for Consumption at
Home.</P>
<P>2. The Unprofitableness of a Trade to <HI>England,</HI> whither their
Export of Cattle and Linen, amounting to above Two Hundred
Thousand Pound <HI>Sterling per Annum,</HI> brought back very little but
ready Money.</P>
<P>Those were strange things, but so popularly push'd on, that they
amused the whole Nation, and the poor People were told, the Uni∣on
would beggar the Country, and starve the Nation; And this
talk'd up to an Extravagant Height, made the poor perfectly di∣stracted.—Taxes
were calculated, without allowing for the Ad∣vantages
of the Customs, in other Cases taken off, without conside∣ring
the Taxes on Malt and Salt were remote, and probable never
to be laid, without considering Proportions, Equalities, and the
Reasons, Nature, or Necessity of things, that the poor People were
Exasperated to the highest Degree, and fill'd with Apprehensions,
that they should have neither Food to eat, nor Beer to drink, that
they were just to be sacrificed to the <HI>English,</HI> be subdu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, ruin'd
and destroy'd.</P>
<P>3. Those Articles, which left some things Contingent to the Par∣liamentary
Jurisdiction, were improved to perswade the People, that
<PB N="14" REF="238"/>
all their Laws, Liberties, Estates, and whatever was near and dear
to them, was left intirely to the Determination and absolute Dis∣posal
of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament; In which, they being to have but
a small Representation, supposing their own Members to be always
Unbyass'd and Impartial, they should always be Over-ruled, Out∣voted,
Oppress'd and Subjected: To talk to them, in this Case, of
the Words <HI>Unalterable</HI> and <HI>Perpetual,</HI> was to say nothing; To say,
the <HI>British</HI> Parliament could make no Alterations, was to say
nothing. These things had so filled the Heads of the People, that
nothing could pacify them.</P>
<P>4. But above all this, and which was yet most unhappy, as it
tended to an universal Alarm, and to Embark a great many Sober
and well Affected People against it, it was carefully represented to
be Dangerous to the Church Government, That all the Establish∣ment
would be subjected to a Vote of Parliament, and a Parliament,
where the Prelates had a Voice against them; that if the Bishops
should please to Vote Episcopacy into <HI>Scotland,</HI> they getting a Majo∣rity
in the Parliament, it would be done; that the Church would
be ruin'd; that if she obtain'd a Tolleration, it was the most that
could be expected in this Case, and that was precarious and uncer∣tain,
and what they must come a begging to the Bishops for. This
made an unspeakable Disorder in the Minds of the People, and all
the Methods taken to convince them, that the Parliament could not
encroach upon the Church, or any ways concern themselves about it,
were to no purpose; they declared the Act of Security to be insufficient,
railed at the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliaments consenting in blank to the Establish∣ment
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and inveighed against a Tolleration
of Episcopacy here, which they said would be the Consequence.</P>
<P>5. And last of all came an Universal Cry, that this was a plain
Breach of the National Covenant and Solemn League, by which the
Nation had bound themselves by Oath to GOD Almighty, among
other things, to endeavour the pulling down the Episcopal Hierar∣chy,
and to Reform, to the utmost of their Power, the Church of
<HI>England</HI> also.—All these things were not only brought as Argu∣ments,
but push'd with so much Heat, so much want of Charity and
Courtesy, that really it began to break all good Neighbourhood, it
sowred all Societies, and the National Quarrel broke into Families,
who were ever jangling, divided, and opposite one among another.—Nor
was there any offering the Expositions, no not of their own Di∣vines,
who had declared, that the Obligations of the Covenant intitul∣ed
them to no other Endeavour of Reforming the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
but such as consisted in Prayers, Exhortations, Christian Arguments
and Examples, <HI>Vide</HI> Doctor <HI>Rule</HI> 's <HI>Vindication of the Church of</HI> Scot∣land,
<HI>P.</HI> 16. However there was no talking to the People at this
Time, nothing but Patience and Time could be expected to remedy it.</P>
<P>In this Juncture, and if possible to compleat the Distracti∣ous
of the People, one Gentleman, by Name Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> and who
had formerly been supposed to write for the Common Good of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
was rewarded for it by Parliament, by what Fate, Party,
<PB N="15" REF="239"/>
Passion or Prejudice, remains to this day a Doubt,—writes a
large Book against an Incorporate Union; In which he abuses and
reproaches <HI>England,</HI> as a Faithless, Wicked, Treacherous and Abo∣minable
Nation, and that to Unite with her, was to Entail GODs
Judgment on <HI>Scotland</HI> for her National Sins. A sad Instance of the
Temper of these Times.</P>
<P>In this Book he sets down Two and Thirty Interfering Interests
between the Nations, which he pretends 'tis impossible to re∣concile:
'Tis writ with Infinite Scandal and Falsity; and
among the rest, and as a Test of the Sincerity of the Party, he
affirms these palpable Untruths.</P>
<P>1<HI>st</HI> That in Commerce, the <HI>English</HI> Trade to the <HI>West Indies</HI> is
carryed on in Exclusive Companies, by which, the letting the
<HI>Scots</HI> into that Trade, was an <HI>English</HI> Cheat.</P>
<P>2. That all the Ecclesiastical State of the Church was left at the
Mercy of a <HI>British</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>3. That the Members of Parliament in <HI>England</HI> were obliged
to take the Sacrament of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before they
were admitted to sit in the House.</P>
<P>This is not a place to confute these things, they did not
want their Answer in their Season, and the People in time did be∣gin
to see their Error, and how this Author had, by manifest For∣gery,
imposed upon them.—But still this did the Mischief it was
calculated for, before any Answer could take place; for this Book
was eagerly espoused by the Party, and there was no room to que∣estion
it was writ at their private Appointment: It was industriously
spread over all the Kingdom in a few days, and no Body of any Con∣sideration
but had a sight of it; nay, it was handed about among the
poor People, to stir them up and enflame them, and it had all the Suc∣cess
the wickedest Creature could wish for; It confounded and amaz∣ed
the People, the dark Side of every thing was shown them, and the
true Sense of things concealed, and who can but think the People
thus abused should run out into Extravagancies.</P>
<P>It is not so much, that a Book fraught with Absurdities, Falsi∣ties
and Contradictions, merits a Note in this Work: But I think
'tis absolutely necessary, to shew where the general Disaffection at
the Union began, since it was manifest, that, till this time, the
People were, in general, very well satisfyed, and the prospect of
an Union was very grateful to them.</P>
<P>It cannot but be some Satisfaction to all those who have heartily
espoused this Union, that the Opposition had such a beginning;
that its Foundation was laid in the Party-Prejudices of a few, whose
Refuge and Support was the meer Assistance of Falsities and unpa∣rallel'd
Forgeries, by which the poor ignorant People were amused,
imposed upon, and led blindly on, even to the Brink of their own
Destruction; from whence, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the good Providence of GOD res∣cued
them, yet they were so possess'd, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew in the Face of
every Body that attempted to open their Eyes, and in insulted their
Deliverers.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="240"/>
It was at least a Fortnight, that the Heats of the People, on Ac∣count
of these Articles, continued, before they produced any extra∣vagant
Effects, and this time was generally spent in the Parliament,
in reading over, discoursing upon, and preparing to Debate the
Articles.</P>
<P>For it may be noted, as will appear by the Minuts, that the Ar∣ticles
were read over one by one in the House, before the main read∣ing
of them, and the Members were admitted to speak freely their
Opinions on every Head, but to put nothing to the Vote.</P>
<P>During this Work, which was from the third of <HI>October</HI> to the
first of <HI>November,</HI> the Ferment increased, and the whole Kingdom
seemed to be in a Disorder, some Accounts of which may be very
proper here.</P>
<P>There had always been a strong Opposition in this Country to
the present Settlement, both Ecclesiastical and Civil, and the Revo∣lution
was not establish'd without a Civil War, which, tho it was
but short, came to a Decisive Battel, which had this particular
seeming Contradiction in it, that the Kings Army lost the Battel,
and got the Victory.</P>
<P>The Viscount of <HI>Dundee,</HI> formerly <HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Claverhouse,</HI> headed
the Malecontent Party, the Kings Forces were routed, but <HI>Dundee,</HI>
unhappily for his Party, was found among the Slain: His Victo∣rious
Party, by his Death, not only lost the Advantage of their
Victory, but having lost the Chief of their Army, they soon dispersed
for want of a Head, and the present Establishment prevailed.</P>
<P>But still they left the North Highlands full of Disaffection to the
present Government, never submitting, but, as it were, by meer
Force, even to this Day.</P>
<P>All the Remains of this Party, called particularly the <HI>Jacobite,</HI>
were unanimously against the Union, as they were against the Suc∣cession.</P>
<P>2. The Episcopal Party were against it as before, because they fore∣saw,
that the Presbyterian Church would strengthen their Settlement,
by the Addition of <HI>England,</HI> who by this Treaty, would on all
Occasions, be obliged to support and defeud them, and so the
Party would of Course be finally excluded.</P>
<P>These two Parties saw themselves abandoned by those who for∣merly
opposed the Succession on different Reasons, and that those
Gentlemen had fallen into the Union, as is before hinted; And
tho I will not say, that they and the Papists and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party were
all in an Interest before, yet it was manifest they fell in together now,
unanimously to oppose the Union.</P>
<P>What Opposition they had formerly made was under Hand,
partly by Solicitation of Friends, and Clashing of Parties; they al∣ways
look'd on it as a thing remote and impracticable, and a thing
which the constant Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, they industriously promoted among
the People, and particularly the National Antipathy would always
prevent.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="241"/>
But when, contrary to their Expectation, they found. That the
Union was brought to a Head in <HI>England;</HI> That the Court push'd
heartily to bring it to a Conclusion; and to their great Surprise
found the several Opposing Parties joyn'd together; and that every
one, from what different Prospects soever, concurr'd in the Union,
and seem'd to make their Court to the Times on the Foot of the
Zeal they should show for this new Prospect of Settlement.</P>
<P>This exceedingly alarm'd them; and they found, That now or
never was the time to oppose it; That if it obtain'd now upon the
Humour of the People, it was certain to be finished, and they and
their Cause effectually fore-closed, from all Hopes of ever retrieving
their Interest.</P>
<P>No sooner therefore was the Parliament met, and the Eyes of al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Nation fix'd upon the Event of this great Affair, but all the
Engines of the several Parties were set to Work: Some to Expose,
some to Defend both the Proceedings that were already perfected
in <HI>England,</HI> and those that were now entring upon.</P>
<P>Innumerable Pamphlets were printed and dispers'd over the whole
Kingdom; and industriously Harrangu'd upon by the Engines of the
respective Parties, as their Interests led them.</P>
<P>The next Step was to find out popular Arguments to gratify the
Humours of the several Orders or Divisions of the People; and to
alarm them with those things in particular, which their several
Tempers, Parties, or Designs led them most to apprehend.</P>
<P>Thus they spread all possible Scandals and Satyrs against the Trea∣ty
in general, as well in Print as in Discourse.</P>
<P>As that it was Dishonourable to <HI>Scotland;</HI> Surrendering her Sove∣reignity
and Constitution, Subjecting her to her Ancient and Im∣placable
Enemies.—That it was Depressing the Honour and Dig∣nity
of a Kingdom, that had Defended her Liberty against <HI>England</HI>
with such Gallantry and Bravery, for so many Hundred Years, as if
she was less able to Fight now than ever, her Sons less Bold, her
Gentry less Daring, or less willing to Die for their Country; That
now they were to be Slaves, and must run to <HI>Westminster</HI> to Vote
with a Handful of Members, who would never be able to carry a
Question, or to make any Weight there, but just for Forms sake sit
in the House, and be laugh'd at.</P>
<P>That the Figure <HI>Scotland</HI> would make in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament,
would not be like a Kingdom but like a Province; That one County
in <HI>England, viz.</HI> of <HI>Cornwall</HI> sent up as many Members, one ex∣cepted,
as the whole Kingdom; and that this was an Eternal Badge
of their Subjection, and the like.</P>
<P>This was a general Cry, and began to be very popular: The Peo∣ple
cryed out they were <HI>Scots</HI> Men, and they would be <HI>Scots</HI> Men
still; They contemn'd the Name of <HI>Britains,</HI> fit for the <HI>Welsh</HI> Men,
who were made the Scoff of the <HI>English</HI> after they had reduc'd them.—<HI>Scotland</HI>
had always had a Name and a Fame in Forreign Courts;
They were Naturalized in <HI>France,</HI> Enjoy'd for many Years great Pri∣vileges
there, and Honours bought with the Blood of their Ancestors;
<PB N="18" REF="242"/>
and they would never give away their Birthright, tho some of
their Nation had been driving a Bargain for themselves, at the
Price of Selling their Country.—Thus they fill'd the Mouths of
the common People, who would go about the Street crying, No
Union, and call the Treaters Traitors, and soon after began to
threaten them openly to their Faces.</P>
<P>The Success the Party obtain'd here to incense the common People
was too much, not to encourage them to proceed; And the next
Step was, to infuse like Prejudices into the Heads of the several Par∣ties
and Perswasions of People. And this was divided into two.</P>
<P>1. To perswade the Honest Presbyterian, that the Church
would be subjected to the votes, the Power and the Oppression
of the Episcopal Hierarchy in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I will not positively assert, that this was meer <HI>Jacobite</HI> Chime∣ra,
Or had its pure Original in Plot and Design; The Fears and Ap∣prehensions
Of Honest People might at first lead them a great way in
that Case: But I believe no Body will take Offence if I say those
Fears and Apprensions were soon made a Handle by this Party,
who sat ready to take all Occasions, and they immediately raised a
Cry; That the Church was betray'd; That Episcopacy was coming in
upon them; That in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament they should be subjected
to the Plurality of Voices, in which the <HI>English</HI> Bishops, beside their
Influence on the Nobility and Gentry, had also their own voices:
And that, if the Union ever went forward, they should be certainly
suppressed by the Prelates, and reduced to a Tolleration at best, if
perhaps that should be obtained.</P>
<P>I cannot be censur'd by any Body, in this Conclusion of mine, if
it be remembred, what strange Advocats the Church had at this
Time,—when those that never came to the Church, never owned
The Jurisdiction of the Church; but on the contrary, were always
Known to maltreat her, reject her Establishment, and never joined
with her, either in Doctrine or Discipline, Worship or Government
went up and down, Exclaiming at the Designs of the <HI>English</HI> Bishops,
to overthrow the Established Church.</P>
<P>Nor will it be remote to the purpose to observe, that when the Act
for the Security of the Church came to be Debated in Parliament,
those very Gentlemen appear'd Zealous to obtain larger Condi∣tions,
and Voted the Overture insufficient for the Churches Safety,
who were never supposed to owe the Church so much good Will<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or
ever before were observed to make her Security any part of their Con∣cern:
Nay, nor were ever known so much as to joyn with the Church,
Owne her Discipline, or call themselves Members.—But this
ceasd, to be a Mystery, when some of those Gentlemen honestly de∣clared,
this was only done to strengthen their Interest against the U∣nion,
and openly began to draw their Arguments into a Chain of
Successive Necessities; That, from the very <HI>Papist</HI> to the <HI>Jacobite,</HI> the
<HI>Prelatist,</HI> the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> the <HI>Cameronian,</HI> every one might find Reasons
to Act together against the Union, as a Common and a National
Evil. But of this I shall find Occasion to speak again presently.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="243"/>
The early spreading these Prejudices had but too much Success;
the Party applyed themselves, as they found it suit the <HI>Genius</HI> and
Tempers of the People.</P>
<P>To some it was Fatal to the Church, and they would be subject∣ed
to Prelacy, and the Plurality of Votes in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>To others it was Dangerous to the State, and the Independency,
Honour and Sovereignity of the Kingdom was betray'd and given up.</P>
<P>Nay to the very Children and most ignorant People, they had
their Arguments; such as, That the Honours, as they call them, the
Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Sword and Scepter, should be carryed away to
<HI>England;</HI> And the Boys and Mob were invited by a great Person,
in a Melancholly Tone, to go in and see the Ancient Crown of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> for that it would soon be carryed away, and they might
never see it any more.</P>
<P>To others they had a more subtil Argument; which tho it was
perhaps begun among those that had no ill in their Design, <HI>as is
said of the first,</HI> yet they carefully improved this, as they did all
other things, to the general Confusion of the Times: And this
was a Notion, that it was absolutely against the National Cove∣nant,
in which the People had Sworn to two Things, which this
Treaty directly would contraveen and render impossible.</P>
<P>1<HI>st,</HI>—That <HI>Scotland</HI> had Sworn in the National Covenant,
to support the Sovereignity of the Kingdom, which they said
was now to be given up.</P>
<P>2. That <HI>Scotland</HI> had engaged to pull down Episcopacy in
<HI>England,</HI> to the utmost of their Power.</P>
<P>The starting these two things had two fatal Prospects; which
indeed, had they not been both over-ruled by that Secret Hand,
which had singularly appeared in the carrying this Treaty on thro
so many seemingly insuperable Difficulties, might have involved
both Nations in Confusion.</P>
<P>From the first of these, they pretended to be bound to preserve
the State in its immediate separate Condition; as if Confederating
with, and Joyning to a more powerful Nation, on Terms Honourable,
and tending to support the Sovereignity and Power of the whole,
was not consisting with that part of the Covenant; which could no
otherwise be understood there, than to signify the Supporting and
Defending the Constitution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it was or should be legal∣ly
Establish'd.</P>
<P>As to the other Suggestion, it was effectually Answer'd by one of
the most Learned Divines of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Doctor <HI>Rule;</HI>
where he Explains the Meaning of the Covenant to be in that Case,
no Attempt by Force to reduce the Church of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> but
<HI>what we are bound to by</HI> the Covenant, <HI>is not to Reform them, but to
Concur with them, when lawfully called, to Advance Reformation either
there, or any where else: And it is far from our Thoughts to go beyond
that Boundary,</HI> Vindication of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Pag. 16.</P>
<P>But this Clamour had another Effect, which might have been as
Fatal in its Consequence, had not the Scene of Affair, been very
<PB N="20" REF="244"/>
much changed in <HI>England:</HI> For this very Pretence, which the E∣piscopal
Party prompted as much as in them lay here, and drew a∣bundance
of Good and Well meaning People into, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as an
Objection against the Union, they immediately turned upon them
in <HI>England,</HI> and set some of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Clergy, espe∣cially
those warm Gentlemen who were against the Union; They set
them, <HI>I say,</HI> upon raising of the old Alarm again, of the Danger of
the Church, arising from the Union; even from this very Argument,
that the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> were Sworn by the Covenant, to
do their utmost to pull down Episcopacy in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I shall, as little as possible, concern this History with Debates of
any of our Party Quarrels; but the Contradiction which these Peo∣ple
fell into, was remarkable; and could it have been considered,
might have very much Exposed them.</P>
<P>For if it was true, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had Sworn to De∣throne
Episcopacy, and that the Presbyterians were against the Uni∣on,
because it would deprive them of that Power, and for ever ty
their Hands from that Work,—Then they were but ill Friends to
the Church of <HI>England</HI> among her own Clergy, who were for that
Reason against the Union.—And it was an Argument of the
strongest Nature to prove, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> should have
been with all her Heart for the Union, if she had the least Know∣ledge
of her own Interest.</P>
<P>It is plain from Doctor R<HI>ule,</HI> that the Obligation of the Cove∣nant
extended no further, than to oblige them to concur with <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
when lawfully called to a General Reformation.</P>
<P>But the Party in <HI>England</HI> run these things a great deal higher, and
plyed the warm Addresses of the People; and especially one of the
<HI>Cameronians,</HI> and of their Leader Mr. <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> against the Uni∣on;
calling what those weak People pot into their Addresses, the
Act and Deed of the whole Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland:</HI> When
'tis known, <HI>First,</HI> That Mr. <HI>Hepburn's</HI> Address had but seven Hands
to it. 2. Those People, tho in other things many of them are good
People, yet do neither owne the Church nor the State; neither the
Civil Government nor the Ecclesiastick. Of which I shall be larger
hereafter.</P>
<P>By these Artifices 'tis hardly credible, what Aversions they raised
in the People against the Union in general, even before the Articles
were made publick, or at all Debated in the House.</P>
<P>But when the Articles were printed, and every one began to read
Lectures upon them, according as their several Fancies guided them,
or their Interest seem'd to clash with them, I want Words to express
what a Clamour was raised on all Hands, and what Feuds began to
appear in every Corner of the Nation.</P>
<P>Parties and People, whose Interests and Principles differed as much
as Light and Darkness:, who were as contrary in Opinion, and as
far a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>under in every thing, as the <HI>Poles,</HI> seemed to draw together
here.—'Twas the most monstrous Sight in the World, to see the
<HI>Jacobite</HI> and the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> the persecuting Prelatic <HI>Non-juror</HI> and
<PB N="21" REF="245"/>
the <HI>Cameronian,</HI> the <HI>Papist</HI> and the Reformed <HI>Protestant,</HI> Parle toge∣ther,
Joyn Interest, and Concert Measures together.</P>
<P>To see the <HI>Jacobites</HI> at <HI>Glasgow</HI> Huzzaing the Mob, and Encou∣raging
them to have a Care of the Church; The High-flying Epis∣copal
Dissenter crying out, the Overture was not a sufficient Securi∣ty
for the Church.</P>
<P>Such Convulsions as these Agitated the whole Kingdom; And
it was the Unaccountablest Thing that ever was known, to find a
Nation, That, but a few Months before, were earnestly crying out
for an Union, and the nearer the better; and that were fully con∣vinc'd
of the Necessity they had of this Union, now fly in the Face
of their Masters, and upbraid the Gentlemen, who managed it,
with Selling and Betraying their Country, and Surrendering their
Constitution, Sovereignity and Independency to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>And such was the Clamour against the Treaters, that I verily be∣lieve,
and I assure you, I do not give my private Opinion in it,—had
the Articles of the Treaty been published before the Treaters
came home; and the Feuds been the same against them as were af∣terwards,
there was not many of them would dared to have gone
home, without a Guard to protect them.</P>
<P>The Merchants, the Burghs, the Country People, all cryed out
of Oppression, and of Ruine and Destruction in Trade.—And
yet, the Amendments that were offered by that Party to the Articles,
in the Time of their Debate, were so small and so trifling, tho
they had a free Debate on every Head, that their own Friends cry∣ed
out upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for demanding so little; and used this as an Ar∣gument
against <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> afterwards, that they might have had more,
if they had asked it.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be forgotten, that those very Gentlemen, who raised
most Noise at the General of the Treaty, had least to say to the
Particulars; had fewest Objections to make, and least of all con∣cern'd
themselves in the Amendments.—The Reason was plain,
the Design was not to Amend the Treaty, but to Destroy it; They
were not Sollicitous to have a good Treaty, but to have no Treaty;
The Drift was to Confound it with Infinite Objections, and to Cla∣mour
the People out of their Wits, that they might, if possible,
Clamour the Parliament out of the House: And of this, such evi∣dent
Proofs will appear in the Process of this Story, as no Body, I
believe, will make any Doubt, but that there is Reason for such an
Objection.</P>
<P>The Parliament was now met, and the Party who opposed the
Treaty diligently, made up their greatest Strength within Doors in
order to it.—I will not say, that several took the Oath of Par∣liament,
on purpose to be able to do Service against it, who never
took the said Oath before,—but I know it was so understood of
several Gentlemen,—and they were reported to be advised by
their Friends to do so.</P>
<P>The first Step they took without Doors, <HI>for the Matters within
Door, I refer o the Abstract I shall make of the Minuts in the end of
<PB N="22" REF="246"/>
this Work:</HI> But the first Step they took without Doors, as to Par∣ticulars,
was to set on Foot a Notion, that the Members of Parlia∣ment
had <HI>no Right to</HI> alter the Constitution, without the particular
Consent of their <HI>Constituents;</HI> And that therefore the Parliament
ought to have an Adjournment for some time, that the Members
might go down into the several and respective Countries, which
they Represented, and know the Mind of their Constitueuts.</P>
<P>And tho, this seem'd to be many ways confuted by Strength of Ar∣gument;
wherein it was alledged, that this was not an Altering or
Giving up the Constitution; And therefore, suppose it were true,
that the Members were not impowered to Act, without the Consent
of their Constituents, in Giving up the Constitution, yet this did
not reach here.</P>
<P>2. It was alledged, that this Parliament was Summoned by Her
Majesty, with an express Signification in the Proclamation, that it
was to Treat of, Consult about, and Conclude an Union with <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
And being sent up, for that declared purpose, by their Con∣stituents,
there remain'd no Occasion to demand any further, or
other Instructions from them; but they became Plenipotentiaries
from that particular Circumstance.</P>
<P>3. That, by the Constitution, it was not required, that the Con∣stituents
should be consulted on any such Occasion; That the Con∣vention
of Estates Transposed the Crown, Altered the Succession,
and Settled the Revolution; which, in all Circumstances, was as
Essential to the Constitution as this; and that they never Consult∣ed
their Constituents in that Case at all; nor did the Opposers of
the Revolution demand it; but Protested, and went out of the
House.</P>
<P>And, in this Case, their Champion Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> also was against
them, who owned, that their Commissioners to the Parliament had
full Power to Act for them in this Case.</P>
<P><HI>However,</HI> As things began to run very high, and the People,
prompted by these Popular Arguments, Assum'd every thing they
thought fit to call their Right; several Burghs wrote Letters to their
Representatives, in their own Names, and by their own Authori∣ties,
Requiring them not to give their Votes, or Assents to an In∣corporating
Union;—<HI>Or, in short,</HI> not to the Union as now
coming on, in the Terms of the Treaty.</P>
<P><HI>But this was not all;</HI> For, finding that this was not much regard∣ded
by the Members; and that Precedents in like Cases, would not
support the Practice; They turn'd their private Letters into Pub∣lick
Addresses, and those introduc'd Mobs, Tumults, Insultings of
Magistrates, Flight of Gentlemen from their Houses, and all man∣ner
of Popular Disorders; Till, at last, it came to downright In∣surrection
and Rebellion: Which, had not Circumstances, and the
Season particularly prevented, had risen up to Blood, Civil War,
and all the Terrible Consequences of an Inrag'd and Divided Nati∣on,
as shall more at large be related in its course.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="247"/>
But to return to the Party who opposed the Treaty; at first they
strove to carry on their Opposition by wiser Methods; and, by their
Force of Arguments, to possess the Peoples Minds with such Aver∣sious,
as might convince the Parliament, they were Acting against
the general Current of the Nation.</P>
<P>And having not at <HI>first</HI> appear'd against the thing in general, it
behoved them to descend to particular Objections; For, to say,
they would have no Union at all, would have been Impolitick,
and have formed too great a Party against them: It was necessary
therefore, to form themselves into a Body of Objectors, that had
some Reason on their Side, and could descend to Particulars to en∣force
their Opinion.</P>
<P>Nor could they, in good Manners to the Queen, object against
an Union in general, who, in Her Letters to the Parliament, had
so earnestely recommended, upon all Occasions, the Union of Her
People, as what Her Majesty esteem'd so much for their mutual
Good; That she would count it Her singular Happiness, to have it
compleated in Her Reign: On this Score, I say, should they have
rejected all manner of Union, or Treaty of Union, it would have
been so directly flying in the Face of the Queens Recommendation,
that it would have not only appeared rude, but have lost them a
considerable Party, whole Assistance they found very great Occasion
for.</P>
<P>This brought all the several Parties, who were against the Treaty,
as well those that were against it, on the Account of the Succession,
as those that were against it in general, to fall in with those, who on∣ly
objected against the Circumstances of it; <HI>I mean,</HI> the Conditions,
and Stipulations published in the Articles.</P>
<P>Thus the great Variety of Objectors, to make themselves perfect∣ly
Formidable, however different in Notion or Design, made up
one Body; and turn'd their Arguments from being pointed against
the Union in general, to be pointed against the Terms of it, <HI>An
Incorporating Union.</HI></P>
<P>This brought them back to the several Schemes of Forreign Uni∣ons
of Nations, such as <HI>Switzerland,</HI> the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and the
like: And some proposed one thing, some another, not foreseeing,
that, had even any of their proposals come to have been the real
Treaty; yet this Party, who were against the Union <HI>as such,</HI> would
have been as much against that, as they were against this; and so
at last they must have divided, broke their Interest, and lost the
whole, which was the main thing aim'd at.</P>
<P><HI>And thus now stood the Debate,</HI>—No Incorporating Union <HI>was
the Word,</HI>—Let us have an Union with <HI>England</HI> with all our
Hearts,—but no Incorporation; Let us keep our Parliament, keep our
Sover<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignity, <HI>keep</HI> our Independency, keep our Constitution, <HI>and for all
the rest,</HI> we are ready to Unite with yon, as firmly as you can De∣vise.</P>
<P>This was thought, by most, to be just reviving the former Notions
of a Federal Union,—with so many inconsistent Noun-Substan∣tives
<PB N="24" REF="248"/>
in their Government, that had upon all Occasions been found
Impracticable; and which would so intirely have left both Na∣tions
Exposed to the Possibility of a Relapsing into a divided Con∣dition,
that it could not be expected, <HI>England, whose Considerations
for Uniting, were Peace, Strength, and shutting a back Door of conti∣nual
War, and Confusion from the North,</HI> should communicate Trade,
Freedom of Customs in all her Ports, and Plantations, with the
Egress and Regress of Manufactures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and leave the main things
yet precarious and uncertain.</P>
<P>It would be endless to trouble the Reader here with the Argu∣ments
on both sides,—which came resolved at last to this short
Head.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Commis∣sioners
had refused to Treat, but upon an intire and Incorporating
Union,—and had given such Reasons, why all other Propo∣sals,
would not only be insufficient, but impracticable; That the
<HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners were convinc'd of it, and satisfyed to enter up∣on
a Treaty of an intire Union, as the only way to establish the
lasting Peace and Prosperity of both Nations.</P>
<P>To talk then of a Federal Union at this time, seem'd only to put
the Question, whether the Parliament should take the Articles into
Consideration, or no.—And this run all the Opposers back to
the Schemes of those, that were against the Union in general, and
by this they lost Ground; For tho they made a strong Opposition
against the very Reading the Articles at all, and would gladly have
rejected them in the Gross; yet <HI>there</HI> several of their Friends left
them, and so they lost the first Question, <HI>Whether the Articles should
be read,</HI> which was carryed in the Affirmative <HI>October 3d,</HI> the first
Day of the Meeting of the Parliament, as will appear by the Mi∣nutes.</P>
<P>This was the first Strait they were brought to; And therefore,
to back these two Principles, they set to Work to procure a Throng
of Addresses from the several Towns,—and which 'tis visible they
attempted to back with Force, to awe the Parliament into a Com∣plyance,
as will hereafter appear.</P>
<P>Most of these Addresses were worded to the same purpose, and
in Substance contain'd a Claim of the Constituents Right, to limit
and instruct their Commissioners,—and a Direction to avoid an
Incorporating Union; Some of them were decently prefac'd with
Expressions of Courtesy to <HI>England,</HI> and Willingness to Confede∣rate,
or Unite with them on other Terms; but Protested against an
Incorporation of Government, as contrary to their Liberties, and
destructive to their Sovereignty and Independency, the Glory of
their Ancestors, the Honour of the Ancient Kingdom, and a great
many such plausible Allegations, in order to make the Ground of
their Addressing seem the more Specious, and to please the People:
Others less Courteous, spoke higher Words and rougher Language,
talk'd of their Defending their Constitution against the Invasion of
Strangers, reflected on their Treaters, and their being wheedled and
<PB N="25" REF="249"/>
drawn in to give up their Country, their Liberties, &amp;c. We shall
come to them presently.</P>
<P>As the Parliament was now sitting so was the Commission,—this
is a Deputation from the General Assembly, being a certain
Number of Ministers, Impowered by an Act of the Assembly,
to meet in the Intervals of their Session, to take Care of the Affairs
of the Church.</P>
<P>The Transactions within the Parliament, I refer to the Abstract
of the Minutes, with Observations immediately sollowing this Ac∣count,
<HI>Folio</HI> But that this Account, which contains
things done without Doors, may run Hand in Hand with the sad
Abstract, it is necessary to give an Account what was Transacting
in the Commission at the same time, at least so far as it relates to
the present Affair.</P>
<P>It is observ'd in the Minutes of the 12<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> that a Moti∣on
was made in Parliament for a Publick Fast; which, however,
was opposed by those, that some thought, had more Inclination to
the Work of a Publick Fast, than those that proposed it; How∣ever,
as the Commission had been several days met, the Gentlemen
in Parliament, who were against the having a Publick Fast appoint∣ed
by Parliament, seemed to refer it to the Commission.</P>
<P>It was indeed opposed in the Commission of the Assembly, for
the same Reasons that it was in Parliament, to <HI>viz.</HI> Not for
any Dislike of Fasting and Praying, but to prevent the Alarming
and Amusing the People, which was the principal Work on Foot at
that Time; However, not to neglect the Work, or be sound op∣osing
such a thing, as Praying to GOD, on whatsoever Account;
It was moved in the Commission, That they should set apart
a Time for themselves to Fast and Pray, as Minisfters assembled
on so great an Occasion; and that a Circular Letter should be sent
to the several Presbyteries, to do the same in their several Districts.</P>
<P>The Act of the Commission, for this Day of Prayer, neither Con∣sin'd
them to a Day, or prescrib'd the Manner; The Act it self is
to be sound in the <HI>Appendix, N. A x,</HI> as Copied from the Original
in the Register.</P>
<P>There had been strong Rumours spread abroad, That the Com∣mission
would not Act, <HI>in this Case,</HI> without the General Assembly;
but that they should Protest against the Union's being Concluded,
till a General Assembly was Called; and Address the Parliament to
Adjourn the Debate of it, till the Assembly should meet, which was
not to be till <HI>April.</HI>—Or, that the Lords of Her Majesties Council
should procure from Her Majesty, that the Assembly might be Cal∣led
sooner.</P>
<P>But, as this was the Contrivance of a Party, only to gain Time;
and of a piece with the Delays offered at in the House, at the same
time; so it met with no Incouragement in the Commission: Not,
but that there was too strong a Party willing to have Befriended it,
at that time, even in the Commission self.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="250"/>
<HI>However,</HI> a very Moderate and well Temper'd Address was drawn
up in the Commission; it was Agreed to in the Commission the
11<HI>th</HI> but not presented till the 17<HI>th:</HI> In which, they recommend
to the Parliament, the Security of the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and its Doctrine, Discipline, Worship and Government, to
be secured by the Treaty, as you may see by the Address it self,
which is printed, in the <HI>Appendix, N B x.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Commission was again pressed about the Fast;
and more Ministers being come to Town, than were at the first;
and coming with the Sense of the Country People fresh in their
Minds, who were, by this time, every where rendered very uneasy,
the Motion of a Fast was renewed; And tho some were against
a Fast as National, yet, as no Body was against Praying to GOD,
on so Solemn Occasion, so the Commission began with themselves
as follows.</P>
<P><HI>October 17th,</HI> It was Agreed, That the Members of the Com∣mission,
with such as pleased to joyn with them, should Con∣veen
in the High Church of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for <HI>Prayer</HI> the Day fol∣lowing;
That the Moderator should begin with a short Discourse
from the Pulpit, concerning the Occasion and Reason of that
Meeting, and the Ministers to Pray, and the Orders of the Ex∣ercise
were settled by the Commission.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the 18<HI>th,</HI> there was a very great Congrega∣tion,
where was present many Members of Parliament, and the
Work continued till two of the Clock, very Publick and Solemn;
but without any of the Excesses, which some People flattered
themselves to find there.</P>
<P><HI>However,</HI> after this, the Motion for a Fast was brought on a∣gain,
and carryed in the Commission on the 21st of <HI>October,</HI> as
from the Register follows.</P>
<P>There having formerly been a Motion made, for Application
to the Parliament for a Publick National Fast; The Matter was
this Day resumed, and much Debate about it; The Commis∣sion
being pretty full, it took longer time; Some were for Ap∣plying
to the Parliament, for their Civil Sanction to it; Others,
that Presbyteries should be wrote to, to Appoint a Fast, without
Applying to the Parliament; because it was feared, the Parlia∣ment
might not be Unanimous in that Matter; and the men∣tioning
of a Fast there might, perhaps, in the present Circumstances,
be Occasion of Strife: And after long Deliberation, it was Unani∣mously
Agreed unto, that Application should not be made to
the Parliament; and a Committee was Named to bring in a
Draught of the Paper about that Fast; which Committee brought
in the same, in Form of an Act, upon the 22d of <HI>October;</HI> and af∣ter
some few Amendments, the same was Unanimously Approven.</P>
<P>This Fast was observed in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> very Solemnly, His Grace
Her Majesties Commissioner, the Lord Chancellor, the Great
Officers of State, and many Members of Parliament appear'd at
Church, and joyn'd in it, tho the Appointment had not the Sancti∣on
<PB N="27" REF="251"/>
on of the Civil Authority to support it.—A clear Proof, by the
way, oft the Parliaments owning the Power of Appointing Fasts, to
be in the Church.</P>
<P>Yet was nor this such a General National Fast, as some People de∣sired;
hoping to obtain upon the People, by the Solemnity of
the Thing; and by the Warmth of the Ministers, who, they vain∣ly
expected, would, in the Pulpit, run out against the Treaty; Bring
the People to a general Aversion against it; and, by Consequence,
to some violent Measures for preventing it.</P>
<P>But the Prudence of the Ministers prevented all this designed Mis∣schief;
and tho the Day was, as I have said, observ'd with great
Solemnity, and Affection; yet it was to their great Disappoint∣ment,
that the Ministers generally, <HI>as well those who were against the
Union,</HI> as those <HI>who were for it,</HI> in their respective Parishes, applyed
themselves only summarily to the Substance, nay, to the very Words
of the Assemblies Act, <HI>viz.</HI> That all the Determinations of the E∣states
of Parliament, with respect to an Union with <HI>England,</HI> might be
Influenced and Directed by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Divine Wisdom, to the Glory of GOD, the
Good of Religion, and particularly of the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Thing was carryed thro', except as hereafter, without
the Mischievous Effect, which some expected from it; who now
begun to turn their Expectations another way, <HI>viz.</HI> To <HI>THE
PEOPLE,</HI> who, they had, by various Arts, screw'd up to an Un∣expected
Fermentation; as, in the ensuing Tumults, appear'd.</P>
<P>I am sorry, that, in the Process of this Story, especially in this,
which I count the fowlest and blackest part of it that could have
been Acted, I shall be obliged to mention some Persons of great Ho∣nour,
and Ancient Families; who were pleased, for Reasons of their
own, to Act against the Union, and to appear so publickly in the
Opposition of it, that <HI>the People,</HI> I do not say, by their own Appro∣bation,
<HI>I hope not,</HI> singled them out as the Patriots of their Country
against this Transaction; and, by their Shouts and Huzzas after
them, as they went and came to and from the Parliament, made them,
as it were, the Heads of the Party, who opposed the Union.</P>
<P>The Dukes of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Athole</HI> were the Chief of these, and
were almost every day in Parliament, strenuously Arguing against
the Articles, and pressing for other Measures, as by the Observations
on the Minutes will appear.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> being Indisposed by some Lameness, I
cannot describe the Occasion, was generally carryed to and from
the House in his Chair.</P>
<P>The common People now screw'd up to a Pitch, and Ripe for the
Mischief desigin, and prompted by the particular Agents of a wick∣ed
Party, began to be very Insolent: It had been whispered about
several Days, that the Rabble would rise, and come up to the
Parliament House, and cry out, <HI>No Unions;</HI> That they would take a∣way
the Honours <HI>as they call them, viz.</HI> The Crown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
carry them to the Castle and a long Variety of Foolish Reports of
this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="252"/>
But the first Appearance of any thing Mobish was, that every
day, when the Duke went up, but principally as he came down in
his Chair from the House, the Mob follow'd him, shouting and
crying out, GOD bless his Grace, for standing up against the Uni∣on,
and appearing for his Country, and the like.</P>
<P>And as Extremes are generally accompanied with their Contra∣ries;
so, while his Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> had these fancied
Honours paid him, the Queens Representative, the High Commis∣sioner,
had all the Insults, Reproaches and Indignities offered him,
that they durst, for fear of publick Justice, shew him. As will by and
by appear.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to say, the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> desired or encou∣raged
this Tumultuary kind of Congratulation; That fort of Popula∣rity
must be too much below a Person of his Character; and
his Grace knows the World too well, and is too Wise a Man, not
to know, that such things always <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tend to Confusion, and to the De∣struction
of Civil Peace in the World.</P>
<P>Nor do I doubt, but his Grace did what he could, to prevent their
singling him our, to show their Mob Courtesie to; but there was
no Crushing a Rabble, that had so many Wheels to set it in Motion;
and the seeming Causes of which encreased every day, <HI>as the Union
began to draw forward,</HI> and as the Members appeared resolved to go
forward with it seriously, in order to a Conclusion.</P>
<P>On the 22<HI>d of October,</HI> they follow'd the Dukes Chair quite thro'
the City down to the Abbey Gate; The Guards prevented their go∣ing
further; But all the way as they came back, they were heard to
threaten what they would do the next day; That then they would
be a thousand times as many; That they would pull the Traitors,
<HI>so they call'd the Treaters of the Union at</HI> London, out of their Hou∣ses,
and they would soon put an end to the Union.</P>
<P>On the a 23d they made part of their Words good indeed; for, as the
Parliament sat something late, the People gather'd in the Streets, and
about the Doors of the Parliament House, and particularly the Par∣liament
Closs was almost full, that the Members could not go in or
out without Difficulty; when Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> coming out of the
House, the Mob Huzza'd as formerly, and follow'd his Chair in a very
great Number; The Duke, instead ot going down to <HI>the Abbey</HI> as
usual, went up the High-Street to the Land to the <HI>Land Market,</HI> as they call it,
and so to the Lodgings of the Duke of <HI>Athole;</HI> Some said, he went
to avoid the Mob; Others maliciously said, he went to point them
to their Work.</P>
<P>While he went in to the Duke of <HI>Athole's</HI> Lodgings, the Rabble at∣tended
at the Door; and, by Shouting and Noise, having increas∣ed
their Numbers to several thousands, they began with Sir <HI>Patrick
Johnston,</HI> who was one of the Treaters, and the Year before had been
Lord Provost; First they assaulted his Lodgings with Stones and
Sticks, <HI>and Curses not a fem;</HI> but his Windows being too high, they
came up the Stairs to his Door, and fell to Work at it with Sledges,
or great Hammers; And, had they broke it open in their first Fury,
<PB N="29" REF="253"/>
he had, without doubt, been Torn in Pieces without Mercy; and
thus only, because he was a Treater in the Cemmission to <HI>England;</HI>
For, before that, no Man was so well Belov'd, as he, over the
whole City.</P>
<P>His Lady, in the utmost Despair with this Fright, comes to the
Window, with two Candles in her Hand, that she might be known;
and cryed out, <HI>for</HI> GOD<HI>s Sake,</HI> to call the Guards: An Honest
Apothecary in the Town, who knew her Voice, and saw the Di∣stress
she was in, and to whom the Family, under GOD, is obliged,
for their Deliverance, ran immediately down to the Town Guard; but
they would not stir, without the Lord Provosts Order;—but
that being soon obtain'd, one Captain <HI>Richardson,</HI> who Command∣ed,
taking about thirty Men with him, March'd bravely up to them;
and making his way with great Resolution thro' the Croud, they
Flying, but Throwing Stones, and Hallowing at him, and his Men,
he seized the Foot of the Stair Case; and then boldly went up,
clear'd the Stair, and took fix of the Rabble in the very Act; and
so delivered the Gentleman and his Family.—</P>
<P>But this did not put a Stop to the general Tumult, tho it deliver∣ed
this particular Family; For the Rabble, by this time, were
prodigiously increased, and went Roving up and down the Town,
Breaking the Windows of the Members of Parliament, and Insult∣ing
them in their Coaches, in the Streets; They put out all the
Lights, that they might not be discovered; and the Author of
this had one great Stone thrown at him, for but looking out of a
Window; for they suffered no Body to look out, especially with
any Lights left they should know Faces, and Inform against them
afterwards.</P>
<P>By this time, it was about eight or nine a Clock at Night, and
now they were absolute Matters of the City; and it was Reported, they
were going to shut up all the Ports;—The Lord Commissioner,
being Int rm'd of that, sent a Party of the Foot Guards, and took
Possession of the <HI>Nether-Bow,</HI> which is a Gate in the Middle of the
High-Street, as <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> between the City of <HI>London</HI> and the
Court.</P>
<P>The City was now in a Terrible Fright, and every Body was
under Concern for their Friends; The Rabble went Raving
about the Streets till Midnight, frequently Beating Drums, and rai∣sing
more People; when my Lord Commissioner being Inform'd,
there were a Thousand of the Seamen and Rabble come up from
<HI>Leith;</HI> and Apprehending, if it were suffered to go on, it might
come to a Dangerous Head, and be out of his Power to suppress,—he
sent for the Lord Provost, and Demanded, that the Guards
should March into the City.</P>
<P>The Lord Provost, after some Difficulty, tho it was alledg∣ed,
that it was what was never known in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> before—About
one a Clock in the Morning, a Battallion of the Guards entred the
Town, Marched up to the Parliament Closs, and took Post in all
<PB N="30" REF="254"/>
the Avenues of the City, which prevented the Resolutions taken to
Insult the Houses of the rest of the Treaters.</P>
<P>The Rabble were intirely reduc'd by this, and gradually dispers'd
and so the Tumult ended.</P>
<P>It is not easy to describe here, the Consternation all Good Peo∣ple
were in at the Rising of this Tumult' and had not such Re∣solutions
been at last taken, as is above-mentioned, <HI>which the other
Party did not expect,</HI> it had been the fatalest Rabble the Nation
had ever seen.</P>
<P>In this Case my Lord Commissioner greatly disappointed the Par∣ty,
who, having Insulted his Graces Lenity before, as a Faintness
of Resolution, had spread about Scandalous Reports, That the
Government durst not look the Rabble in the Face; That the
High Commissioner was afraid of being Rabbled in his Palace;
and that, if they once rose in a Mob,, all would fly before them;
That the Parliament would run away, and dissolve themselves, or
fly to the Castle; and another worse thing than all, <HI>viz.</HI> That
the Souldiers were on their side, and would not fight against their
Country, as they called it.</P>
<P>But the Resolution of the Lord Commissioner disappointed them
all, who now shew'd them, he had as much cheerful Bravery in the
Action, as he had Calmness and Temper in the Parliament; This
broke all their Measures; and when they saw the Guards, led by
Brave and Faithful Officers, stand firm to their Duty, and shew
themselves resolutely forward to defend the Government, they lost
all their Courage; it defeated all their Expectations, and they
began to lay aside that sort of violent Proceedings, and apply
themselves to the Artifice of Words, and the Managry of Parties
in the House.</P>
<P>It is to be observed also, That this Rabble was a Mine sprung
before its Time, which blew backwards, and destroyed the Engi∣neers,
rather than the Enemies; <HI>The Plot</HI> being otherwise laid, <HI>viz.</HI>
That it should not have broken out, till some Days sollowing;
when, as was said, all would have been in readiness, to have fini∣shed
the Work at one Blow, <HI>viz.</HI> To have blown up the Govern∣ment
at once.</P>
<P>They had been Tampering with the Souldiery, in order to De∣bauch
them from their Duty; and some People talk'd of retiring
from the Parliament, and of some Great Men Heading the People;
which, had their Patience been more, and their Conduct a little more
secret, they had, without Doubt, effectually brought it to pass;
But they blew their own Project up by their Precipitation, and so
saved their Country by their very Attempt to destroy it.</P>
<P>The Author of this had his Share of the Danger in this Tumult,
and tho unknown to him, was watch'd and set by the Mob, in or∣der
to know where to find him, had his Chamber Windows In∣sulted,
and the Windows below him broken by Mistake.—But,
by the Prudence of his Friends, the Shortness of its Continuance,
and GODs Providence, he escaped.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="255"/>
Several of the Rabble were seized upon, and apprehended; and
there was a Discourse of making Examples of some of them; but
the Mercy of the High Commissioner, <HI>however provoked and abused,</HI>
prevail'd to Compassionate, rather than Punish their Follies; They
were only kept some time in Prison, and afterwards let go,
without any other Punishment.</P>
<P>And thus ended the most dangerous Juncture of the whose Trea∣ty,
and a Tumult, which ended to the Advantage of the Govern∣ment,
and the Disheartning the Party, who, before that, carryed
it with such an unheard of Insolence; That, had they not been,
as they thought, sure of their Cause, they would never have An∣swer'd
it to their own Discretion, to have Acted in so Open and
Insulting a Manner.</P>
<P>The Foot Guards, and two other Regiments of Foot, did now
constant Duty in the City, <HI>viz.</HI> The Regiments of <HI>Strathnaver</HI> and
<HI>Grant;</HI> The Horse Guards attended the Commissioner, the other
Battallion of Guards at the Palace, and the Garison at the Castle.</P>
<P>And all was little enough; For the Regiments were thin, and
few; and all the Forces then in the Kingdom, <HI>some Independent
Companies in the Highlands excepted,</HI> did not exceed three thousand
Men; and great Endeavours were used, as I have said, to De∣bauch
the Souldiers, tho in vain; they appearing Faithful and
Forward, to do their Duty on all Occasions.</P>
<P>The next day the Parliament did not sit; but a great Council was
assembled, where the Measures the Lord Commissioner had taken,
as to bringing the Guards into the City, was Ratified and Approv∣ed;
and a Proclamation published for suppressing the Rabble;
which being something particular, is inserted in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI>
C <HI>x.</HI></P>
<P>I have printed this Proclamation, tho this Work could very ill
spare Room for it; both because it recites the Acts of Parliament
in <HI>Scotland</HI> in Force against Rabbles; as also, for that the Method
is particular to that place, and very good to prevent Tumults, <HI>viz.</HI>
1. Of obliging the Deacons of Crafts, <HI>that is, as in</HI> London, <HI>the
Masters of Companies,</HI> to Summon the Inhabitants, and make them
give Security for the Behaviour of their Servants, Apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
2. Giving an Indemnity to the Souldiers, either of the Regiments,
or Town-Guards, in case they should wound or kill any Person, af∣ter
a Command given for all to retire from the Streets.—</P>
<P>Indeed there was Occasion enough for such a Proclamation; and,
had not the Party been broken, <HI>as before,</HI> all would have been little
enough, to have suppress'd the Fury of this Enraged Multitude.</P>
<P>No Body would undertake; to justify the Rabble, <HI>especially after
they had been defeated in the Design.</HI>—Every Body cryed out, it
was a Dangerous Thing; and the whose City might have been ex∣posed
to Plunder, Riot, and all manner of Disorder.</P>
<P>But, as the Party could not justify the Rabble, so they began a
new Clamour; and now they exclaim'd, That the Privileges of
<PB N="32" REF="256"/>
the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were invaded, and Souldiers brought in, to
awe and oppress the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>That this had not been done in sixty Years before, nor ever, but
in the Time of War and Tyrannick Government; and that it was
a Fore-runner of the Slavery of the Nation.</P>
<P>Then they cryed out, this was an Invasion of the Freedoms of
Parliament, and an Awe upon the Members, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See the Minuts
of the a 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> where that Matter was urged very warmly.</P>
<P>'Tis true, it had been to be wished, the Affair could have been
carryed on, without any Jealousies and Insults; But, on the other
side, it was alledged, That the Force put on the Government by the
Rabble, was an Invasion of the Publick Peace; and that the Mob
were the Aggressors, and the Parliament was much more likely
to be Awed by the Ungovern'd Rabbles of the Streets, if they had
gotten a Head, than by the Forces brought in for their Security;
who being at their Command, did nothing but secure them from the
Insults of the Mob, and keep that Peace which the Civil Authority
had not Power to preserve.</P>
<P>That the Military Power is always supposed to be assisting to the
Civil, when opprest by Rabbles and Tumults; and while in Sub∣servience
to the Civil Peace, and Subordinate to the Civil Powers,
the proper Safe Guard of a State;—and as the Force of these Ar∣guments
carryed all things before them in the House, all the legal
Pretences were overthrown, by the Reason and Nature of the Thing,
and the Parliament approved of all that had been done.</P>
<P>Nor did they Approve it only; but Ordered the Guards to be
Continued, or recommended it to the Lord High Commissioner,
and the Privy Council, to continue their Care for the Safety and
Security of the Parliament. <HI>Vide the Minuts of October</HI> 25<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>However, by this Method, the Appearance of the Rabbles, and
the Fury of the Streets, were, in some Measure, Abated; yet the
People appeared Exasperated to the last Degree; The Huzzaing and
Crouding about Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> continued, notwithstanding all his
Endeavours to prevent it; and unusual Threatnings and dark
Speeches were heard among the People.</P>
<P>The Lords, and others, who opposed the placing Guards in the
Streets, made Protests against it, as Infringing the Liberties of the
Parliament; tho it was very plain, that there was nothing Imposed
in Parliament, nothing offered to be Carryed, but by Reasoning
and fair Voting.</P>
<P>From this Time, they began to talk of Country Tumults; and
that, since the Commissioner had suppress'd the Mob in the Town,
the whose Country should rise, and come up to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and
remove the Guards by Force from Imprisoning the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Pretence was Specious; They pretended, the Guards were
a Force upon the Members of Parliament; That this was Craming
the Union down their Throats; That the Country was Unanimous∣ly
against it, and would not bear, that a few People in the House,
because they had the Majority within Doors, and a Band of Souldi∣ers
<PB N="33" REF="257"/>
to back them, should Impose a Conjunction with <HI>England</HI> upon
them, whether they would or no:—Any body may judge what
a Time this was, when every day the Town was alarm'd; To
Day the North was up in Arms, to Morrow the West; To Day
such a Shire, to Morrow another, the next Day a Third; <HI>Glasgow,
Dumfries, Hamilton, Perth,</HI> all the places which the imagination of
the People dictated, and the Fears of others apprehended.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express the Consternation of the People:
Those that wished well to the Publick Peace, and who saw, that
a Commotion at this Time, must immediately involve the Nation
in War, and Blood, not with <HI>England</HI> only, but with one, another;
these Trembled for Fear of the Desolation of their Country, the
Blood and Ruine that always attends a Civil War, and the Danger
of the Lives of themselves and their Relations.</P>
<P>Those who look'd seriously into the Drift of some of that
Party, who most eagerly push'd on these Divisions, who saw how
the Interest of a Popish, a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and a Persecuting Bloody Ge∣neration
<HI>lately extinguish'd, and now full of Hopes,</HI> was Twisted, and
all joyn'd in Anti-Union Principles, could not but be heartily con∣cern'd
for the Establish'd Religion, and Protestant Church; which
they must have been wilfully blind, who could not see was plainly
struck at, by the Opposers of this Treaty.</P>
<P>To see others, whose Designs could not be suspected of any thing,
to the Detriment of either Religion, or their Native Country, yet
joyning blindly with a Wicked and Degenerate Race, and seeming
to approve the Steps which were taken, to the Ruine and Destructi∣on
or both; To see the these shut their Eyes against the plain Disco∣veries
of a stated Resolution against both Liberty and Religion,
and encourage, <HI>nay, in too much</HI> with them, who were known
Enemies both to the National Church, and Protestant Succession;
These, I say, were very Melancholly Things, when the Prospect of
them was so near to those, who were sincerely concerned for the
Peace of the Country, and the Safety of the Reformed Religion;—And
People went up and down wandering and amazed, expecting
every day strange Events; afraid of Peace, and afraid of War;
Many knew not which way to fix their Resolutions; They could
not be clear for the Union; yet they saw Death at the Door, in
its breaking off; Death to their Liberty, to their Religion, and to
their Country.</P>
<P>Here were good People of all Opinions, as well as others; Some
were against the Union, on a Principle of Justice and Honesty, as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>carnestly as others were against it, on a Principle of Treachery to
their Country; Some were firmly possess'd, that they were under
National Engagements, which, in the Nature of them, clash'd with
the Union; and that therefore, however it might be necessary for
the Safety, and peace of either Church, or Nation, they could not
get over those Obligations, or consent to this Evil, that the other
Good might come;—And however these might, in the Conse∣quence
of the Thing, Countenance the wicked Foundation, on which
<PB N="34" REF="258"/>
the other acted; yet I cannot but do them that Justice, that I be∣lieve,
they were far from the least Intention, to encourage the
strengthening a Party, whose Principle was <HI>French</HI> Government,
and a Popish Sovereign. I will not answer for Indiscretion, or
Errors in Temper in some; neither will I be so unjust, as to call
every wrong Step an Error of Principle, and every mistaken Man a
Plotter against his Country.</P>
<P>This was the unhappy divided Condition of this People, at the
beginning of the Treaty. The Division was so general, that it
spread thro' every part; The Gentry were divided, the Common
People divided, nay, the very Ministers were divided; Parliament,
Assembly, Court, City, Counties, Towns, nay, almost every Fa∣mily
were divided; and as the Event began to be feared on every
side, People stood strangely doubtful of one another.</P>
<P>The Commission of the Assembly hitherto carryed, <HI>as before noted,</HI>
with a great deal of Prudence and Moderation; and tho there were
some unhappy Struggles there, which perhaps were pointed, by the
same Party, at making a Breach; yet as they came to no Head, and
were soon crush'd by the Wisdom and Conduct of the rest, I shall not
preserve the Memory of them to Posterity; The general Proceed∣ings
of that Reverend Body being always Tempered with Modesty,
Calmness, and Discretion, at the same time that they were anxi∣ously
concerned for the Security of the Foundation on which they
stood, and had the whose Weight of the Church of <HI>Scotlands</HI> Safety
upon their Hands.</P>
<P>They had Address'd the Parliament, That Care might be taken
of the Church in the Treaty; and had been assured, they should
have their Expectation fully Answer'd.</P>
<P>And I cannot but remark here, That the Foundation of this Trea∣ty
herein appeared to have been wisely laid; The Understandings
and well poised Judgments of its first Contrivers was very Conspicu∣ous,
in leaving the respective Parliaments a full Liberty, so to Esta∣blish
the several Churches, as that all the Security they could de∣mand,
one against the other, should be granted them; That every
Root of Jealousy might be pull'd up, and there might be no Room
for the Sowers of Discord to begin here, where they always used to
begins; and from whence all the Mischiefs of former Dissention
used to flow.</P>
<P>The Parliament had also been Encouraged by the Queen, in Her
Majesties Letter, <HI>Vide Folio 3d. of this Part,</HI> at the Opening this
Session, to Form such Security for the Church Government, as
might fully Establish the National Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI>—For the
Queen having, by long Experience, and the former Contention on
both sides, seen, that an I Union of Principles was no more to be
expected,—but plainly seeing also, that, with the Assistance of
Mutual Charity, that Difference in Principle might be Consisting
with an Union of Interest, and Affection, among Her People, saw,
at the same time, that the only way to Establish this Peace, was,
to Form such Securities to both Churches, as might, for ever, re∣move
<PB N="35" REF="259"/>
remove all just Ground of Jealousies, from among them, take away
the Suspicions, and shut all the Doors against, the Fears, which ei∣ther
had entertain'd of each other; and which wicked Men daily
took hold of, as Handles of Contention, to keep open an Eternal
Breach, and keep us always divided, <HI>Ephraim</HI> against <HI>Judah,</HI> and
<HI>Judah</HI> against <HI>Ephraim;</HI> ever vexing and envying one another.</P>
<P>In this Posture, I say, stood the Affairs of the Church; when,
in the Interval of Time, between the first Address to the Parliament,
and the second Reading of the Articles, <HI>Vide Minuts, Folio</HI>
An Overture, or Draught of an Act for the Church, was conceived,
and on the of was presented to the House.</P>
<P>I shall not enter into a long Debate which arose here, both with∣out
Doors and within. 1. As to the Sufficiency and Insufficiency
of the Overture, which, in some part, may be Answer'd, by say∣ing,
it received some Amendments or Additions afterwards, at the
passing into an Act. Or, 2. As to any Act of Parliament being a
sufficient Security for the Church; That Objection being raised at
first, not by such as designed a better Security, but by such as real∣ly
designed no Security at all, for the Ecclesiastical Establishment in
this Nation: It is hard, That we must be forced to distinguish the
Disputes in this Case, by distinguishing the Persons; for there be∣ing
several Parties here, and of several Principles, who all seem'd to
make but one Party against the Union, it was absolutely necessary to
Examine who was for this, or that Argument; and, by the Man,
The Reason of his Argument, was to be distinguished.</P>
<P>This Unriddled the Mystery, which appear'd in the Debates of
this Time; when those that had really least Kindness for the
Church, were the loudest, and appear'd the most Zealous for her Se∣curity:
Nay, those that never owned, or acknowleged either her
Discipline, or Government, never submitted to her Judicatories, or
joyn'd with her Worship, were now every day crying out of want
of Security, Exposing the Church to the Votes of the Bishops in the
<HI>British</HI> Parliament, and giving the Episcopal Church of <HI>England</HI> the
Ascendant over the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Language could be no otherwise uuderstood, but by distin∣guishing
the People that spoke it; The very Party were Hierogly∣phicks
to the Dialect; and he must be blinder than most People
are, in this Intelligent Age, that could imagine, these People spoke
this from a true Design to obtain for the Church a farther or bet∣ter
Security, so much as to embarras the Church and the State, em∣broil
the Parliament with the Commission; and either prevent its
being finished at all, or obtain what they generally drove at, in all
their Managements now in the Affair; and, which was the only
thing they could hope in, <HI>I mean, A DELAY.</HI></P>
<P>But to leave this Matter a while, the Parliament was all this time
Reading over the Articles, and Discoursing or Reasoning upon
them, but had not yet come to any Vote; The Tumult at <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI>
was blown over, without the expected Event; we shall now
see, that it was not in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> alone, that a Tumult was designed,
<PB N="36" REF="260"/>
but Steps were taken, <HI>and indeed Politickly enough,</HI> to have the
general Sense of the Kingdom to run in the same Channel.</P>
<P>To this End, Addresses were set on Foot, in several parts of the
Kingdom, against the Union: I shall not pretend to croud this
Book with the particular Addresses, tho some of them are remarkable
enough; However, I shall give <HI>Specimens</HI> of some of them to judge
from, and to make the Matter, as I go along, the plainer.</P>
<P>And, among them, I cannot omit one from the Convention of the
Royal Burghs; because some Gentlemen, especially in <HI>England,</HI>
having valued their Opinion from thence, as if it were the Sense of
the whole Nation: It is a little necessary, towards clearing up this
Point, That, tho the People were screw'd up to a most Un∣expected,
and indeed Unaccountable Aversion; yet that, in the
whole, the main Body of the Nation did not run the length which
some of their Leaders desir'd of them, and which they would have
had pass'd as their Act and Deed.</P>
<P>The Royal Burghs have a Custom in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they act in a
Body, and have a Convention, or Representative of their own,
which meets upon Occasion at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and are conveened by the
Lord Provost of <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> To this Convention, every Burgh
sends one Member, and the Burgh of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> two; Their
whole Representative is sixty six in Number.—Now the Calcu∣lation
which was observable here, was in the Number and Quality
of the Burghs, which Voted in the Convention, The Address was
carryed by four Voices indeed, but the State of the Case is thus; Of
sixty six Burghs, twenty Voted against Addressing, and twenty four
for it, the rest were absent. But take the Quality of the Burghs, to
make the Calculation by, and there the thing will discover it self as
follows;</P>
<P>Take the Burghs that refused to Address, and these that did not
think it worth while to appear; and the Majority against the Ad∣dressers,
is, by the Proportion of <HI>their Cess,</HI> as eighty six to four∣teen.
Nay, suppose all those that did not appear to be Affirmatives,
tho that be altogether improbable, and that they would have been
for the Address, yet the Proportion had been, as thirty one to six∣ty
nine.—</P>
<P>But if <HI>the Rate of the Cess</HI> be not a just Estimate of the Value of
the Burghs, <HI>tho I can prove it was the Original of their Right of
being Burghs;</HI> then I refer to any Man to calculate the Inhabitants
and Number of Free-men in each Burgh, and he will find the twenty
Burghs that refused to Address, have more Inhabitants in them,
than both the twenty four that Address'd, and the twenty two that
were absent, the City of Edinburgh excepted.</P>
<P>So that, upon the Foot of this Calcul, tho the Address may legal∣ly
be called the Address of the Burrows; yet it did not follow, that
the Trading Part of the Nation had Addressed, or were against the
Union; for that, in an Arithmetical Calculation, or a Calculation
upon Value and Payment of Taxes, the far greater Number opposed
the very Addressing at all.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="261"/>
This is observed here, in order to clear up a Point hereafter,
which will require a like kind of Calculating, on the Foot of the
whole Nation.</P>
<P>The Burghs however, by this seeming Majority, did Address;
and because the said Address is very particular, and contains in it
all the Popular Arguments, which the Enemies of the Treaty had
blinded the People with, <HI>as before;</HI> particularly of the Surrender∣ing
the Sovereignity, and Independency of the Nation, and Sub∣jecting
their Religion, Church Government, Claim of Right,
Laws, Liberties, and Trade, to be Altered or Subverted by the
<HI>English</HI> in <HI>British</HI> Parliament; For this Reason, I have given you
the Address it self at large in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. D x.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot, I <HI>confess, but wonder,</HI> how it was possible to impose
things so absurd upon a whole Nation! And how so Great a
People, so clear Sighted, and Wary in all other Cases, came, at
this Time, to run so apparently upon a plain Mistake! Since, as
nothing is more plain, than that the Articles of the Treaty, and
consequently the Great Heads mentioned in the above Address, can∣not
be touch'd by the Parliament of <HI>Britain;</HI> and that the Moment
they Attempt it, they Dissolve their own Constitution; so it is an
Union upon no other Terms, and is expresly Stipulate, what shall,
and what shall not be Alterable by the subsequent Parliaments;—And
as the Parliaments of <HI>Britain</HI> are founded, not upon the Ori∣ginal
Right of the People, as the separate Parliaments of <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Scotland</HI> were before, but upon the Treaty, which is prior to
the said Parliament, and consequently superior;—So, for that
Reason, it cannot have Power to Alter its own Foundation, or Act
against the Power which formed it; since all Constituted Power
is Subordinate, and Inferior to the Power Constituting.</P>
<P>This is so clear, and has been so often Inculcated in this
very Case, and is so Unanswerably Stated in the very Acts of Par∣liament
themselves, <HI>Ratifying the Treaty,</HI> that I need say no more
to it here.</P>
<P>But it was a strange Time now, and there was no making the
least Impression upon the Minds of the People, <HI>already prepossess'd;</HI>—Nothing
was to be heard now, but of Slavery to the <HI>English,</HI>
running away with the Crown, taking away their Nation, and the
like:—And it was impossible to Stem this Tide of Distraction
for a Time;—It is true, that the Generality of the People came
off from this Delusion at last, and the Unalterableness of the Uni∣on
if finish'd, began to obtain a little upon the Senses of the Peo∣ple;—The
Truth is, the Demonstration of the Thing was so
visible, that it could not but prevail; and the Best, and most Ju∣dicious,
beginning to see into it, the rest of the People began, to
sink under the Power of the Conviction, and so by Degrees the
Scrup<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te began to wear off.</P>
<P>Nay the same People, who first argued against this Truth, <HI>viz.
Of the Parliament of</HI> Britains <HI>not being able to Invade the Treaty,</HI> took it
up themselves afterward, when it served their Turn, and strongly
<PB N="38" REF="262"/>
urged it against Consenting to the Church Establishment on the
<HI>English</HI> Side; since it was a Confirming the Episcopal Power, and
setting it up above the Power of a Parliament to pull down; <HI>So
freely will Men accept of an Argument,</HI> when it serves their Occasion, which
they will reject, while it seems to oppose their Interest.</P>
<P>In the Ruines of this Suggestion, another started up; which
as it was capable of being Embarass'd with greater Doubts, and
with some, had Insuperable Difficulties; so, had not the Mode∣ration
of the Ministers Interposed, it might have been of far worse
Consequence in this Case; and this was a Scruple against the Uni∣on
in Gross, as being directly against, and inconsistent with the
Covenant; and that therefore it could not be entred into, with∣out
incurring the Guilt of National Perjury.</P>
<P>This brought the Church into the General Appearance against
the Treaty;—Nor will I say, but that great Means were used,
if possible, to bring the Commission then sitting, to declare against
the Union, upon this Account.</P>
<P>This was a great Tryal of Skill; and I say, this rose out of the
Ruines of the other Scruple, because it was forcibly enough alledg∣ed,
That, if the Constitution of this Treaty was such, that no Al∣teration
could be suffered; and that not the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI>
could infringe one Article of it; Then this for ever shut the Door
against the Possibility of their Assisting, to Reform the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> which they alledged, by their Covenant, they were bound
to use all lawful Endeavours to perform.</P>
<P>This, and submitting to the Jurisdiction of the Bishops in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and who were to sit still in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, and there∣by
owning the Agency of Spiritual Men in Civil Imployments, they
also alledged was against the Covenant: And consequently, if the
Nation went into this Union, they incurred directly the Guilt of
National Perjury; and I allow, that a great many Good and Va∣luable
People were very Melancholly upon this Head, and some are
not easy in it to this Hour.</P>
<P>I cannot pass this thing here, without speaking to it; because I
foresee dayly Disputes do still arise upon this Head, and are like to
do so every day, and I shall not interrupt the Thread of the Story
by it at all; rather it will seem necessary to be considered, in or∣der
to carry on the Course of the Story, some of which, particular∣ly
<HI>at this very juncture,</HI> very much depends upon it.</P>
<P>I am not at all entring here, upon the Obligation of the several
Covenants, engaged in by the People of <HI>Scotland;</HI> 'Tis necessary
here, for Argument sake, to allow them to be Obligatory, in as
large a Sense as can be desired.</P>
<P>As to the being Obliged to Reform the Church of CHRIST in
the whole Island;—It is granted here, by the most severe Assertors
of the Covenants Obligation.</P>
<P>1. That, <HI>as is express'd,</HI> they are use all lawful Means only;
and that they are not to use any such thing as Force.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="263"/>
And the Reverend Doctor <HI>Rule,</HI> a Divine of great Candor and
Learning, and Principal of the College of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> has stated. this
Obligation very distinctly, as follows,</P>
<P>What we are bound to by the Covenant, is not to Reform them, but to
concur with them, when lawfully called, to advance Reformation; And
it is far from our Thought, to go beyond that Boundary, in being con∣cern'd
in their Affairs, wee wish their Reformation, but leave the Mana∣ging
of it to themselves. <HI>Doctor</HI> Rule's second Vindication of the
Church of <HI>Scotland, P.</HI> 16.</P>
<P>Now I think nothing is more clear, than that there is all the
Room in the World for the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to concur in a Na∣tional
Reformation, notwithstanding the Union; Nay, they will
be better Qualifyed for it, now than ever; in so far as they will,
I hope, always have the Assistance of all Good Men in the South,
both Dissenters, and Church Men, to Encourage them.</P>
<P>As to the Civil Power of Church Men, or in <HI>English,</HI> the Bishops
Voting in the Parliament, and its being declared against in the Co∣venant;
I will not Dispute the Suggestion, whether it be against
the Covenant or no, the Discord lyes here.</P>
<P>One Party says, it is expresly against the Covenant; and that
the yielding to it, and yielding to have the Church of <HI>England</HI> e∣stablished
by the Treaty, is setting up that very Power they were
sworn to Reform, to the utmost of their Power, in all lawful Means;
and these are the particulars, in which, they say, the Union is a
Breach upon the Covenant, and has brought the Nation into the
dreadful Sin of publick Perjury.</P>
<P>The other say,</P>
<P>1. They are not guilty of National Perjury; for that they con∣ceive,
the Union does no way oblige them further, than as before,
in the Sense of Doctor <HI>Rule,</HI> to concur with all lawful Methods for
Reformation, and to close with all Opportunities, which shall be
put into their Hands for the Purpose; and this they are yet as
free to do as before.</P>
<P>2. As to their Consenting to the Act for the Security, <HI>&amp;c</HI> of
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> it is not against the Covenant, since it is
not an Erecting a Church; Nay, it is not, in the least, a Recog∣nizing
or Acknowledging them that are Erected;—but 'tis a
letting <HI>that he,</HI> which <HI>was before,</HI> and which they had no lawful Call,
<HI>the Thing expresly mentioned in the Covenant,</HI> to concern themselves in
Altering; They were not legally called to it, for they were legal∣ly,
at this time, excluded on either side, from meddling in the res∣pective
Settlements of the Church, by the Queens Power.</P>
<P>And, at last, they alledge, that, in so far as the Covenant en∣gages
them against the Civil Power of Church Men, they did ex∣onerate
themselves fairly, in their publick Protest against the Votes
of the Bishops, <HI>viz.</HI> The Representation and Petition, Rejecting,
as far as in them lyes, all Submission to their said Power; and
that they conceive, being not called to any other Opposition, they
<PB N="40" REF="264"/>
have fully discharged their Duty as a Nation, and have, to the ut∣most
of their Power, opposed it.</P>
<P>I think, this is a clear, tho' a short State of the Question; And
some of the most Conscientious and Pious, of both Ministers and
People, on one side, thought the Case of the Covenant clear in
this Point.</P>
<P>I know, there are others dissatisfied still, of whom I have only
this to say, If they are certain it is a National Crime, I wish they
would apply themselves to National Humiliation, and be found of
them that stand in the Gap, to prevent GOD'S Judgments, rather
than forgetting that part, fill the Days with their Complaint of the
Sin,—and only apply it, to make the People uneasy at the Occa∣sion.</P>
<P>The Union is finisht: Even breaking it again, it that were in
their Power, would not undo the Crime, if it be one; and would,
at the same time, involve their Country in a Thousand Calamities,
Blood and Distresses.</P>
<P>I cannot be so Uncharitable, as to think, any Man that raises the
Scruple we are now upon, would be willing to be thought to be
moving the Nation, to break this New, and most Solemn Conjunc∣tion,
and fall all to pieces again: I would then ask, To what end
are publick Exclamations, and Excursions of the Tongue about it?
They can tend to nothing, but to keep the People in a continual
Alarm, keep their Minds in a constant Perturbation and Uneasi∣ness;
And 'tis a sad Work for any Man to be employed in, meerly
to disturb and distract his Country.</P>
<P>While these things were debating at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Affair grew
still darker and darker all over the Kingdom; and they were far
from carrying it with equal Temper and Moderation in other
Places.</P>
<P>In the West, the People, called <HI>Cameronians,</HI> began to be appre∣hended
as Dangerous, and that Cloud was diligently represented as
very Black; That, according to the Rash Wishes of some People,
<HI>whose Endeavours too had not been wanting,</HI> they would fall into some
Desperate Action or other on this Account;—The Prejudices a∣gainst
the Union had rcach'd them very early: Nor was it to be
supposed, that those People, who were so diligent to Alarm the
Country every where against the Union, and possess'd them with
Fears and Jealousies of their Liberties, Trade, Crown, and Religi∣on,
would fail to fall to Work in these Parts, where they must needs
know, the general Character of the People, was to be Tenacious
of their Opinions; and far from being always prescribed by the
most Prudent and Moderate Councils;—As to other Places,
the Arguments were suited ro the People, as to some, the Loss of
Trade, to others Taxes, to these the Liberty, to those the Sovereign∣ty
of the Nation, so to these the great Pretence used, was Religion,
the Danger of. not the Church, <HI>for that many of them did not sub∣mit
to or acknowledge;</HI>—But Religion in general, and these two
Heads in particular, the Return of Prelacy, and the Breach of the
<PB N="41" REF="265"/>
Covenant; However, they had all the very same things in their
Allegations.</P>
<P>In carrying on the Design of Enslaving these poor People, great
Artifice was used;—And, as if they had been prepared for the
Design before hand,—they waited till the Articles were p inted,
which were formed by the Treaters in <HI>England,</HI> and the several Mi∣nuts
of the Treaty.</P>
<P>When these were seen, a Number of these People got together;
And tho they were not the Number by far, as was diligently re∣ported,
in order to make them Formidable; yet the Beginning
might have been Dangerous enough, if it had been push'd on far∣ther;
what Number they might really be in other places, I could ne∣ver
learn so particularly, as to venture asserting it: But about
Two Hundred Men, in a Tumultuous Manner, came to the Town
<HI>of Dumfreis,</HI> a Sea-port on the West side of <HI>Scotland,</HI> about Twen∣ty
Eight Miles from <HI>Carlisle;</HI>—They came into the Town in the
Middle of the Day on the Twentieth of <HI>November,</HI> made a Fire in
the Market Place, burnt the Articles of the Union, and burnt a
Paper with the Names of the Commissioners of the Treaty, and fix∣ed
another Paper of their own upon the Cross; and having done
thus, they marchc'd off, and dispers'd themselves peaceably.</P>
<P>This Paper indeed was no less Seditious in its Nature, than the
Attempt was Insolent and Daring.</P>
<P>When the Report came to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> of this Tumult, the Concern
of those, who wish'd well to their Country, was very great, and
Wise Men began to give the Design of the Treaty for lost; They
knew the unhappy Temper of those Honest People; for such, how∣ever,
I must call them, because I believe their Intention is Religious
and Honest, tho they may be mistaken, and, no doubt, are mista∣ken,
in their Principles, about Government and Obediences; But,
as they knew, I say, the Temper of these People, how Tenacious
of their own Sentiments, and how Precipitant in their Prosecution,
it bred no small Concern in the Minds of all People, who wore in∣clin'd
to Peace; Concluding, That the Party, who opposed the
Union from worse Principles, had gain'd their Point, <HI>viz.</HI> To im∣ploy
the Hands of Protestants, one against another, in this Dispute,
and make the Honest Meaning, but Warm People, the Tools to
Ruine both themselves, and their Country.</P>
<P>There were not wanting, it the same time, People, who dili∣gently
spread Extravagant Rumours of the Numbers of these People;
Some said, that there were Six Thousand Men in Arms at the Place;
others, that Two Thousand Horse only came into the Town; and.
that Five Thousand Foot stood ready, in the Hill Country, to March
with them, as Occasion should require: Others, that the whole Bo∣dy
of them were up; and that the whole West was in Arms, and
at least Twelve Thousand of them were to March for <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to
raise the Parliament; and that they had publickly declared, they
would Sacrifice the Treaters, as Betrayers of their Country, and Sel∣lers
of her Liberty and Sovereignty.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="266"/>
To back these Reports, the Paper they fix'd up at <HI>Dumfreis</HI> was
officiously printed; and at the End of it, a Postscript, <HI>signifying,
That this Paper was publickly read from the Market Cross at</HI> Dumfreis,
<HI>about one of the Clock Afternoon, on the Twentieth of</HI> November <HI>One
Thousand Seven Hundred and Six with great Solemnity, in the Audi∣ence
of many Thousand; the Fire being, surrounded with double Squa∣drons
of Horse and Foot in Martial Order.</HI></P>
<P>The printing of this Paper was resented by the Government, and
the Printer fled from their Hands for the present; but this, as all
other Insults of this Nature, were no farther prosecuted, the Govern∣ment
choosing rather to pity and overlook the Follies of the People,
on this Occasion, as what they saw was politickly Enflamed by a
Party, who only sought to Embroil the Nation, and bring the best
of the People to fall out with one another, that the Game might be
made up out of the Destruction of both.</P>
<P>By this Postscript above, may appear to any Unbyass'd Person,
the Artifice made use of, to magnify every Story, to encrease the
Terror of the People, and, if possible, to encourage the like Confu∣sions
in other Places; For, as to the Fact, 'tis true, there were a
Rabble of Country People, to the Number, as above, of about
Two Hundred; I could never find, that they deserved to be called
More;—That there was any such thing, as Squadrons or Com∣panies,
either of Horse or Foot, or any Martial Order, such as Offi∣cers
or Commanders, or any thing like Troops, was a manifest For∣gery,
on purpose to Amuse the Nation, and make the People Be∣lieve,
what they really had some Ground to Fear.</P>
<P>I must also do those People in the West this Justice, that, tho
great Endeavours had been used to Exasperate them, and they were
heartily against the Union, as appear'd, upon all Occasions;—But
when they came to see a little into the Hands that were at Work
against it, and with whom they were like to joyn, even the Hottest
among them came to themselves, and to give them their Due, they
behaved with great Calmness and Discretion; nor could they be
brought into any Precipitations or Extravagancies, as was dayly
threatned;—Mr. <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> their chief Leader and Minister,
had been Reflected on, as one that had Inflamed and Animated
them to rise and take Arms, and that had been said to threaten
the Parliament;—when he was Discoursed with by some, who
were under Concern for the publick Peace, it discovered the Frauds
and Falsities of those Suggestions, and how they were spread about
to several great end of the publick Disorders, and only amuse the
World; for he declared himself readily, that indeed, they had Ap∣prensions,
that the Union would be prejudicial to them' that they
did not like the Articles, and thought the Treaters had not done
their Duty, and the like; but that, as to their having any Design
to disturb the Government, or to appear in Arms, it was an Abuse
upon them; They had no such Thought, nor should they do any
thing, but in a National Way; much less would they adhere to,
<PB N="43" REF="267"/>
or encourage the Designs of a <HI>Jacobite French</HI> Party, whom, he de,
clared they abhorred, and would never joyn with.</P>
<P>I chink this is a plain Demonstration of the Truth of what I have
alledged all along this Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That there was a busy Party,
who run thro' the whole Country, by all possible Artifice, to Agi∣tate
and Disturb the Minds of the peaceable People; and, if pos∣sible,
to bring them first to mistaken Notions about, and Aversions
to the Union in general; and then, to pursue those Aversions, by
all possible Methods of Distraction and Confusion; and that this
might bring the Honest and Well-meaning People of the Nation,
either by their Numbers and Interest, to overthrow the Treaty;
or, by their Folly and Miscarriage, to overthrow themselves, and
so to weaken both.</P>
<P>But GOD'S Goodness to this Innocent People disappointed them
here, and we never found the least Tumult or Disorder on this side
afterward, to the particular Mortification of the Party that hoped
for worse things from them.</P>
<P>The Declaration therefore, or Protest, which they posted up at
<HI>Dumsries,</HI> and which the Party handed about at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as a great
Instance of what they hoped for from them, is rather published
here, as an Example of the Notions they had poisoned the Minds
of the People with, than as the Sense of the Nation, in the Case of
the Union, and a Sketch of what they endeavoured to obtain from
all the rest, <HI>Appendix,</HI> N. E x.</P>
<P>We are now, in the Process of this Affair, come on to the middle
of November;—I must desire the Reader, to go back a little to
the Parliament; They had begun to read the Articles the second
time, in order to Vote on them; The beginning was a remarkable
Debate, and held for several days, as will appear in the Minuts.</P>
<P>The first Article was like putting the previous Question. <HI>viz.</HI>
Whether there should be an Union with <HI>England,</HI> in the Sense of
the present Articles, or no: That is, whether there should be an
Incorporate Union of the Nation into one Kingdom, to have but
one Name, Head, Signature, Constitution and Parliament, Yea or
No.</P>
<P>The Manner of this Question, and the Difficulty with which it
was carried in the House, I refer to the Minuts, <HI>Folio</HI> But I
cannot but observe one significant <HI>Omen</HI> of the future good Success
of this Treaty, and which, I must owne, very much encouraged me to
think it would go on, notwithstatiding all the vigorous Opposition
it met with, was. That it was Voted on the most remarkable Day
for Publick Deliverance, that ever happened to this Island. I am
as far from laying any Stress on such insignificant Circumstances, as
any Man; and I know, they can have no Efficiency in the bring∣ing
to pass the mighty Events, which may be usher'd so into the
World; and therefore I bespeak the Reader to note this, not as a
thing I lay any real Weight upon.</P>
<P>And yet it was impossible to observe, without some Emotion of the
Mind, and without some Presage of the good Issue of this Matter;
<PB N="44" REF="268"/>
That the first Article, being the Great and Essential Part of the U∣nion,
was Voted and Approved on that remarkable 4<HI>th</HI> Day of <HI>No∣vember,</HI>
which was made happy to <HI>Britain; First,</HI> By the Birth of
the Great and Immortal King <HI>William,</HI> to whom these Nations owe
so much, that they cannot look on their Church Restored, the
Bloody Persecuting Race of Tyrants Abdicated and Fled, Cruelty
and Prelacy Dethroned, and all the Mischiefs of a Ruin'd Nation
Vanished, and not Bless the Memory of that Great Agent of GOD's
Goodness to them, without remarkable Ingratitude both to GOD's
Himself the Original, and to that Glorious Instrument of our Feli∣city
the King,—Nor was It this alone, which rendered this Day
remarkable to us, but also, that the great and remarkable Revolu∣tion
of <HI>Britain</HI> formed in, and founded upon the Expedition of the
same King <HI>William,</HI> bears Date from this Time, being the Day
which he first Landed on at <HI>Torbay</HI> in the West of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It could not but be a pleasant Reflection to those, who remem∣bred
the particulars of these things, to find, that, without any pre∣vious
Calculation, or Direction of Men, the Concurrence of Causes
should so effectually jump, for the bringing to pass the most remar∣kable
Transactions of Britain's Establishment on the same <HI>Day;</HI>
That her Deliverance from Tyranny, and the many many Oppressi∣ons
of a most Cruel and Barbarous Generation, that Aim'd at sup∣pressing
the Foundations of Liberty, and Overthrowing the Consti∣tution
of both Kingdoms;—And her Deliverance from private
Antipathies, the Peace of her Inhabitants, and the great Conjuncti∣on
WE HOPE, of the Hearts and Affections of Two Nations, which,
for many Years, had been filled with the most Fatal and Inveterat
Aversions, should take their Rise together, and Date their Beginning
both on the same Fourth of <HI>November;</HI> and both on that very Day,
when the Great Instrument other Deliverance, by whom she was
put in a Condition to bring all the rest to pass, was born into the
World. Happy Day! Hippy to <HI>Britain!</HI> Happy to all <HI>Europe!</HI>
Since the Events of this Birth, the Actions of Heaven in the Hand of
this Prince, have been the Foundation of all the Glorious Things,
which have since happened in Europe, and of the Humbling the Great
Thunderer of this Age, who had Established his Kingdom in the
Destruction of the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and in a View of the Subver∣version
of the Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>It was, on this Happy Day, that the first Article of the Union
was pass'd in the Parliament, after Infinite Strug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les, Clamour,
Railing, and Tumult of a Party; who, however they endeavour∣ed
to Engage the Honest Scrupulous Part of the People with them,
yet gave this Eminent Discovery of the Principles of their own
Actings, in that, there was an Entire Conjunction of the <HI>Jacobite,</HI>
the <HI>Prelatick,</HI> and the <HI>Popish</HI> Interest, in this particular; and the
very Discovery of this, opened the Eyes of a great many People,
who, in the Simplicity of their Hearts, had joyo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in general
Opposition to the Union; but, when they saw the Tendency of
Things, and whither it all led, when I hey saw the Society they
<PB N="45" REF="269"/>
were going to Embark with; when they saw the Enemies of the
Protestant Settlement all Engag'd, and these very People, who had
filled the Land with the G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oans of Oppression, and the Cries of
Blood,—coming to Joyn Hands with them, against an Union
with <HI>England;</HI> when they saw, that, to shun an Union with Chri∣stians,
they were, of Necessity, to come into an Union with De∣vils;
Men that had Transformed themselves into the very In∣fernal
Nature, and visibly Acted from Principles, in this particular
Diabolical, in that they Tended to Erect the Absolute Subjection
of Nations to the Lust, and Unbounded Appetites of Lawless Ty∣rants;
when they saw these things so plainly, we then found an Alte∣ration,
and the best, the must thinking, and most Judicious People,
began first to stop, and consider, and afterward wholly to withdraw
from the Party; and the Clamour of the People, as if come to a
<HI>Crisis,</HI> began not to be so universal, but to abate; and the more it did
so, the more the secret Party, who lay at the Bottom of all the rest,
began to appear, and distinguish themselves.</P>
<P>The first Article being past, the Hopes of the Party depended
upon Debating the Matters of Taxes, Excises, Customs; and, as
far as possible, setting up the Popular Arguments of Care for the
poor,—the Impossibility of paying Duties, the Incapacity at
the Trade to support Excises and Customs, and the like; and
here they had Recourse from one Shift to another, and, like True
Souldiers, tho in a Bad Cause, they fought their Ground by Inches.</P>
<P>From Article to Article, they Disputed every Word, every Clause,
Casting Difficulties and Doubts in the way of every Argument,
Twisting and Turning every Question, and continually Starting
Objections to gain Time; and, it possible, to throw some Un∣surmountable
Obstacle in the way.</P>
<P>The Consequence of this was, making Amendments to the Ar∣ticles;
Nor was it a small Disappointment to them, when they
law the Parliament willing to come into Amendments; and when,
by the Prudence of the Committee, Appointed to make Calculati∣ons,
and Examine those already made, it appeared, that their Ob∣jections
were either Answer'd and Confuted, or the Clauses so Recti∣fied
and Amended, as that they had no more Room to fasten any
of their Cavils They were intirely Defeated, and the Disaster was
particular in this, that it shew'd still the more plainly to the World,
that their Design was not to be satisfied in the Amendment, and
Alteration of what they Objected against; but, in having something
to demand, that would not, or could not have been reconciled.</P>
<P>This caused a great many Trisling Emendations to pals, which,
in themselves, had not Signification enough, either to deserve the
Name of Objections, or to need any Disputing.</P>
<P>“`Tis evident, the Design was to load the Treaty with a Multitude
of Amendments; Among which, it was to be hoped, some might
be found, which the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would Scruple; or, at
least, that it would be a Precedent for the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> to
Consider the Treaty, and make more Amendments; which being
<PB N="46" REF="270"/>
to come down to <HI>Scotland</HI> again, to be considered here, would
another Sitting on of Course; when, by Delays, the Time fix'd
to the First of <HI>May</HI> might be elapsed, the Season of the Year ad∣vance,
which hitherto had not favour'd them for the Riots and
Tumults of the Country, and, in this Delay, they might find fur∣ther
Advantages.</P>
<P>How their future Actions conformed to this Suggestion, and how
they were, in every Step, disappointed, is the next thing to be dis∣cours'd
on;—But I must Adjourn it a little, and Return to the Affairs
of the Church, which were, at this time, in equal Agitation,
proportionably considered, and the Party who opposed the Union,
used all possible Artifice to bring things into Confusion there, in
which they discovered a double Mischief in their Design, 1. To
bring to pass the grand Design of Obstructing the Treaty. And, 2.
if possible, to make the Disorders they aim'd at, take their Rise in
the Churches Dissatisfactions; by which last Thing, two other
Ends would have been obtain'd.</P>
<P>1. They would have fix'd the Scandal of all the Consequences,
even of their own rashest Actions, upon the Church.</P>
<P>2. they would have drawn in Multitudes of Zealous, but In∣nocent
People, to have push'd on their Designs blindly, imagi∣ning
they had been Acting for the Church.</P>
<P>But, as before, so even now, the Prudence and Steadiness of
the Ministers, in the Commission of the Assembly, defeated all the
wicked Designs of this Party;—For tho there were, in the Com∣mission,
a great many Ministers, who were sincerely and heartily a∣gainst
the Union,—yet they were not to be drawn in to Act
with so much Imprudence, as the Projects of that Party designed;
and therefore, what ever of Heat, or unhappy Warmth, at several
times, happen'd there; and which, at one time, was feared,
would have gone higher, yet the Temper and Sincerity of the main
Body, both Ministers and Elders, always over-ruled, and, in good
time, suppress'd it.</P>
<P>I have already given you the Address, which the Commission of
the Assembly gave in to the Parliament, in order to obtain a Securi∣ty
for the Church.—This Address effectually Answer'd the End
of the Ministers, in that it obtain'd a Vote in Parliament, <HI>Novem∣ber
2dm, viz. That, immediatly after the first Article of the Union was
Voted, the Parliament will proceed to an Act for the Security of the Do∣ctine.
Discipline, Worship and Government of the Churchy, as now by
Law Established within this Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All this Time an Overture, or a Draught of an Act, Intituled,</HI> An
Act for Security of the True Protestant Religion, and the Government of
the Church, as by Law Established within this kingdom, was Read, and
Ordered to be Printed.</P>
<P>While this Overture was preparing in the Parliament; and after
it was printed, there was no small Endeavours used to possess the
Mind of the People, that it was nut a sufficient Security for the
Church.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="271"/>
There had been some Suggestions spread, that the Parliament
would put them oil, without effectually securing the Church; and
all possible Care was taken to improve this Notion, and the People
were agitated on that Head, as much as possible: Some said, the
Overture ought to have been drawn up by the Commission, not by
the Parliament; and that it was leading them on in the Dark,
with a general Vote, that an Act mould be pass'd, without letting
the Church judge, what was sufficient for her Security, and what
not.</P>
<P>It was urg'd against this, That the Commission had mentioned
in their Address, the Heads in which they ought to be secured;
and there was no doubt, but the Parliament would make that Ad∣dress
the Foundation of the Act of Security;, That, if there was
any thing wanting, they would have time enough to renew their
Address, for the adding such things, as they judged reasonable;
and that therefore they ought to stay, and not Interfere with the
Proceedings of the Parliament whose proper Work it was, to pre∣pare
their own Acts.</P>
<P>But this did not satisfy some People, who insisting on the Com∣missions
concerning themselves in it; The Committee for Publick
Affairs moved, <HI>October</HI> 25. in the Commission, that some Members
might be appointed, to see what the Parliament Men had prepar'd
for the Security of the Church.</P>
<P>This was the Time, in which the Debates in the Commission run
highest, and when some of the Elders, taking Offence at the
Warmth of some of the Ministers, withdrew themselves from the
Commission;—But wiser and more moderate Heads interposed,
and prevented the ill Consequences of these things, as will after∣wards
appear.</P>
<P>Upon Inspecting the Overture for Security of the Church, and
Viewing the Provision made there for such Security, the Members
of the Commission, who were appointed as above, Reported, That
there were some Difficulties remaining, which they desired might
be Considered.</P>
<P>These Difficulties began a warm Debate in the Committee of the
Commission, which were Reported as Considered by the Commit∣tee;
and are as follows,</P>
<P>1st That it would seem, That the Sovereign of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the
Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onation Oath, is to be Sworn to Maintain the Rights, and Pri∣vileges
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as by Law Established, without
any Respect to the Church of <HI>Scotland, 2ly,</HI> That, by the Oath of
Abjuration taken in <HI>England,</HI> obliging to Maintain the Limitations
of the Succession, and Qualification of the Successor to the Crown,
the Taker seems to be obliged to endeavour, to the outmost, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>clusion even of such Protestants from the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are not of the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as now
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word Established there. <HI>3ly,</HI> Several Difficulties being proposed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Oaths, it was discours'd, how a Bar may be put to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parliaments Imposing Oaths upon the Ministry and Peo∣ple
<PB N="48" REF="272"/>
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Inconsistent with the Principles of this Church.
4<HI>ly,</HI> That the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be exempted from the Sacra∣mental
Test, in Use in <HI>England,</HI> which secludes all from any Office
in <HI>Britain,</HI> or Benefit from the Crown thereof, who are of the Com∣munion
of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and some other things, which
was thought, might be uneasy, and of Dangerous Consequence to
this Church, if not provided against in the Conclusion of the Uni∣on
And these things being Discours'd upon at great length, were
again Referred to the Committee for the Publick Affairs of the
Church, to be further Considered, and they to Report.</P>
<P>The Committee, to whom this Affair was Referred, Reported,
That they have had several Meetings, and Discours'd at great length
upon the Four Particulars relating to the Union, and heard several
Ministers and others upon their Scruples thereanent; and likeways
upon a Fifth Particular, That the Constitution of the <HI>British</HI> Parlia∣ment,
where Twenty Six Bishops do Sit as Members, seems to be
Inconsistent both with the Principles of Presbyterians, and the Co∣venants
and Engagements of this Church and Nation.</P>
<P>It would be too long to set down here, how the Commission was
dayly Besieg'd with Clamours and Cryes, raised upon the Jealousies
of the People;—And how they were urged to all manner of im∣proper
Resentment, upon the Allegations now raised against the
Security of the Church, as it was offered in the Overture: This De∣bate
rising Co high, I think it not improper to print the Overture it
self, as it was first drawn up, as well as when it was with Amend∣ments
Engrossed; The first Draught therefore you will find in the
Appendix, N'. F x.</P>
<P>I shall forbear entring here into any of the Heats and Indecencies
which passed upon this Debate, since they came to no Extraordinary
Height; and the Wisdom and Forbearance on both sides, prevent∣ed
the Evil Consequences which some hoped for from them.</P>
<P>The second Address of the Commission had its Birth in these De∣putes;
and tho the Enemies of the Union expected great Things
from it, yet, as it came out quite another Thing than they designed,
having been reduc'd to Shape, and strip'd of all its Monstrous Figure,
in which it was expected to come into the World, it had two Con∣sequences,
which serv'd to assist even against the Party, that pro∣mised
themselves so much Good from it.</P>
<P><HI>Ist,</HI> It convinced the World, That however it was spread abroad,
that the Com million would violently oppose the palling the Act of
Security, as a Thing of no Consequence, and so put a full Stop to
the Work; it was evident, the Commission was not to be Blinded
by Out-sides, nor Screwed up by Parties; but that, Calm and
clear sighted, they would goon, in all Cases, with the same Gravi∣ty,
Consideration and Temper, which they had shown from the
Beginning.</P>
<P><HI>2ly,</HI> It obviated the great Debate about the Church here submit∣ting
to the Episcopal Jurisdiction of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or to
the Votes and Suffrages of the Bishops in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, in
<PB N="49" REF="273"/>
that, tho they did not Interfere, or Prescribe to the Parliament, yet
they Exonerated their Consciences, and the whole Church of Scot∣land,
by making, as it were, a Protest against it, as what they
would not be understood to Comply with, either now, or by any
Action in time coming, which mould be the Consequence of the
Union.</P>
<P>Thus the Difficulties, tho resolv'd to be presented to the Parlia∣ment,
yet came out in a Modest aud Humble Dress, suitable to the
Dignity, as well as Pittance, of the Assembly, to which, and from
which, it was presented; and yet it came out in a Dress, which
some Gentlemen of the Commission, particularly of the Ruling El∣ders,
did not Approve of.</P>
<P>Some would have had this Address been called a Protest, but the
Moderation of that Reverend Assembly crush'd that Motion; and
after some Debate, it obtain'd the Title of the Representation and
Petition,—and was Resolved on in the Commission the 8<HI>th</HI> of
November, and the same Day presented to the Parliament. The
exact Copy of this Paper, you will find in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> No. G x.</P>
<P>When this Paper was Agreed on in the Commission, the Earls of
<HI>Rothes</HI> and <HI>Marchmont,</HI> Lords <HI>Polwarth</HI> and <HI>Forglen,</HI> Sir <HI>James Camp∣bell,</HI>
the Lairds of <HI>Jerviswood</HI> and <HI>Ardkinlass</HI> younger, and several
other of the Gentlemen, who Sat there as Ruling Elders, Declared
their Dissent, and Entered their Protest against it, taking Instru∣ments
in the Hands of the Clerk of the Commission; and promised
to give in the Reasons of their Dissenting, which accordingly they
gave in on the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the giving in these Reasons by the Elders, the Commission
appointed a Committee to wait upon the Elders; and to know, if
they insisted upon having their Reasons for Protesting Recorded;
and to signify to them, That, if they did, the Commission would
be obliged to draw up their Answer to those Reasons, and to Re∣cord
the same likewise.</P>
<P>The Committee never obtain'd an Answer from the Gentlemen,
in a Body; but as many as they met with, gave for Answer, That
they did not insist positively on it, but left it to the Commission,
either to Record it, and Form Answers to it, of not, as they saw
most proper.</P>
<P>The Committee having Reported this, the Commission did, at
last, think fit to Record the Protests, and the Reasons annexed, and
drew up their Answers to them, tho they waited two Months be∣fore
they entered it; which, because they arc very material to a
right Understanding of the present Debate, I have annexed to this
Work, in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. H x I x.</P>
<P>I think the Reasons and Answer are a sufficient Comment upon
this Text; and whoever pleases to peruse them, will see, that tho
the Designs of wicked Men pointed much farther, yet the Commis∣sion,
both Ministers and Elders, were wholly insluenc'd by prin∣ciples
of Peace, Honour, Conscience, and the Good of the
Church.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="274"/>
I know, some thought the Church went too far in this Affair,
and especially in the Matter of the Sacramental Test, which seem'd
a Thing perfectly remote to them, and what they could have no
Concern at all in; And the Gentlemen, in particular, were yet
more willing than the Ministers, to have let both that, and the Mat∣ter
of the Civil Power of the Bishops quite alone.</P>
<P>But if we shall consider, how the Ministers were dayly besieg'd,
at before, with the Importunate Violences of the People; How
many among them really, thought this part in particular directly
against the Covenant; and how, by false Reports, many had been
so Imposed upon, as to Believe the Sacramental Test in <HI>England.</HI>
extended even to the Members of Parliament, which should be sent
from <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>When, I say, they consider the Fears and Jealousies, which over∣spread
all forts of People; and how far the Artifices of a wicked
Party were, at this time, in their Meridian, and had inexpressible
Influences on all sorts of People, they will, with me, admire, that
the Commission was able to maintain their steady Resolution;
How they Work't thro' those Flouds, and kept the middle way with
Temper and Moderation, to preserve themselves from the Snares
laid for them.</P>
<P>All these things considered, it was, in most Peoples Opinion, a
Victory gain'd, and the Party received a manifest Disappointment,
even in this Representation, in that the Commission could be
brought to no Precipitations, as some People flattered themselves
they should.</P>
<P>However this may be the general Opinion, I know some People
took ill the Length they went in this Affair, and thought they ex∣ceeded
their proper Sphere,—But, I believe, those Gentlemen
are very well satisfied with the Unanswerable Arguments drawn from
hence against those, <HI>who, not content with this Length,</HI> thought to
Upbraid them with Forgetting the National Obligation of the Co∣venant,
which they fairly quitted themselves of by that Article, in
which they declare Civil Places of Church Men to be not submitted
to by them, but against both their Covenant and Consciences, and
to have fairly Exonerated the Church from that Affair, which stuck
so near her.</P>
<P>The Representation was presented to the House, just when the
Overture for the Security of the Church was under their Considerati∣on;
and however it did nor, at present, meet with a very savou∣rable
Reception, even by those who were the Churches very Good
Friends, who thought, <HI>as before,</HI> they run it too high, and also ill
tim'd it; yet neither did the Gentlemen wholly omit the things
requested therein, tho they seem'd to sleep for some time; but par∣ticularly
the Clause about the Valuation of Teinds and Plantation of
Kirks, which they pass'd an Act for by it self: The Matter of
Oaths seems also settled in the Amendments to the Overture: The
other, as the Matter of the Sacramental Test, and the Suffrages of
<PB N="51" REF="275"/>
Bishops in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, was silently let fall, as things they
could, by no means, meddle with in the Treaty.</P>
<P>Here the Opposers of the Union met with another Disappoint∣ment;
For, had these Two Articles been insisted on, they knew
the Event would have been a Rupture of the Treaty, and their
great End had been Answer'd, <HI>viz.</HI> To obtain the Parliament to
demand something, which they knew <HI>England</HI> could never grant.</P>
<P>Thus this Storm blew over, the Act of Security for the Church
was Voted, and laid by to be annexed to the Articles, and made
part of the Union, as shall afterwards appear.</P>
<P>As this had made a great Noise in the Assembly, so it had been
no less canvassed all over the Nation: Some condemned the As∣sembly
in the main, and pretended to censure them publickly, for
engaging themselves in Matters, that had so plain a Tendency to
breaking up the Union, and desiring the Parliament to concern them∣selves
in those Affairs in England, which could really admit of no
Debate in this Case.</P>
<P>But, as if the Commission wanted the Authority of their Consti∣tuents
to back them in their Proceedings, and to justify their Con∣duct
the respective Presbyteries in the Country began to come in
with Letters, or a sort of Addresses, testifying their Approbation of
what the Commission had done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Commission diligent∣ly
avoiding every thing that was Tumultuary or Popular, gave a,
cold Answer to them; as particularly, to that of <HI>Dumfermling,</HI>
who subjoyning to their Approbation of the Petition their Desire a∣bout
Fasts Publick and Private, as in a Time of Impending Dan∣gers;
The Commission Resolved, That their <HI>Act about Fasts past be∣fore,
did sufficiently Answer the Presbyteries Desire,</HI> and so took no
notice of the rest; which prudent way of Proceeding stopt that
Design, which seem'd to be only to make the Representation as Po∣pular
as they could, that it might, on the one Hand, encourage
further Petitions, and secondly oblige the Parliament to come into
their Measures.</P>
<P>While this was thus carrying on in the Commission, the Country
began to be very Uneasy, and Threatnings came in every day, of
coming up in Armies and Rabbles, to raise the Parliament, and to
desire, that the Church might be secured.</P>
<P>The Presbyteries of <HI>Glasgow</HI> and of <HI>Stirling</HI> sent Letters to the
Commission, containing Heads of Grievances, and representing se∣veral
things, which they desired the Commissian to demand of the
Parliament, for the Churches Security.</P>
<P>To this the Commission of the Assembly answer'd, That they had
done, or were now doing, all that was desir'd in their Letters.</P>
<P>An ill natur'd Motion was made in the Commission also, to send
Circular Letters to all the Presbyteries, to fend up their Members to
the Commission, and a Committee was appointed to consider of it;—But
this occasioned such Variety of Debates, That the Com∣mittee
could come to no Resolution, but referred it back to the
and there it dropped.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="276"/>
This was a plain Design to renew the Debates; and, if possible,
to bring the Com million to protest, or declare themselves against
the Union.</P>
<P>The Representation was now before the Parliament, but, as yet,
they took no notice of it; and it was apparent, That they pursu∣ed
their Treaty, for some time, without any respect to the said
Representation; and indeed it was foreseen they would do so, the
Gentlemen easily seeing, that, if these things were insisted, it was
just a Resolution to break off the Union.</P>
<P>The other Party eagerly Reported about Town, That it was a
Disrespect to the Church, not to regard her Solemn Representation;
and then the Consequences of the Bishops Voting in Parliament
were laid forth, and the Danger of the Church was now their general
Discourse: Some were alarm'd with this Chimera, That the Par∣liament
had not a sincere Respect for the Churches Safety; That
the Gentlemen had no great Concern about the Matter, and so the
Church would be Exposed to her Enemies, by the Negligence of her
Friends.</P>
<P>But the Commission law thro' all this; and having done what
they thought their Duty, both for the Churches Security, and for
the Exonerating their Consciences in the Cases they could not com∣ply
with, they resolved to stand still, and leave the Consequences
of Things to Divine Providence, without pushing at Things Im∣practicable,
or such Things as tended only to Division.</P>
<P>This Steadiness of the Ministers broke all the Measures of the Par∣ty;
Their Hopes to Embroil the Ministers with the Parliament va∣nished;—And
the Discourse of the Representation or Petition
began to grow old and die.</P>
<P>The Commission had their Hands full of their Representations of
another fort, about the Growth of Popery, the ill Practices of some
of the Deposed Ministers, and the like, and so it wore off by Degrees.
I mention, in this Account, the Prudence and Moderation of the
Ministers so often, not that I design to write Panegyricks here, much
less to flatter the Persons of the Ministers but who ever knew
the Management of that Time, and reflects back on the Particulars,
will easily joyn with me in this,—That there were several parts
of Management practised upon the Ministers, in order to ruine
their Counsels, besides what the Open Debates of the Commission
discovered, and particularly such as follows,</P>
<P>1. There was a Design, if possible, to bring the Ministers into a
general Declaration against the Union, as dangerous to their Li∣berties,
inconsistent with their Principles, and contrary to the Obli∣gation
of the National Covenant; <HI>Of this I have spoken in the
Course of the Story.</HI></P>
<P>2. There was a manifest Design to bring them to a Rupture a∣mong
themselves; and that, if possible, supposing the Union
should proceed, or not proceed, the disagreeing Party might be
brought to a breaking off, or dividing from the rest, and so form a
settled stated Dissent, or Breach in the Churchy—Nor was this
<PB N="53" REF="277"/>
a thing of small Consequence For it was really big with a large
Variety of Mischiefs, and very cunningly contriv'd; Snares were
laid for the whole Body, not of the Assembled Ministers only, but
the Constitution of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Destruction was
almost visible in the Project, had it met with Success.</P>
<P>Had the Union been compleated without the Concurrence of the
Ministers in Commission,—either the Church Affair must have
been left out, or the Enemies of it would have always said, it had
been settled without her Approbation, and consequently the Settle∣ment
been both Imperfect and illegal.</P>
<P>Had one Party declared for the Union, and another against it,
and, had both those Parties adhered to their respective Declarati∣on,
by any publick Separation as a Party, the House had been di∣vided
against it self, and the Consequence would have been hoped
for with but too much probability.</P>
<P>In this very Case, the Prudence of the Ministers, I say, was re∣markable,
and next to the Wisdom of Providence directing, was
the only means of preventing the Mischief contrived: It is not to
be doubted, bur, in the Commission of the Assembly, and among the
Ministers without, there were men of various Sentiments, some a∣gainst,
and some for the Union; But their Wisdom was particu∣larly
seen in this, that however they differed in the debating things,
they always concurr'd in every publick Act of the Commission, and
made no Division for nor against it.</P>
<P>We find but one Protest in the whole Affair, which was in the
Case of the Representation and Petition; and this began among
the Ruling Elders, and continued there; for none of the Mi∣nisters
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adhered to that Protest, but even those that were against
some parts of the Representation, yet, seeing themselves out-voted,
acquiesc'd Nor was all she Representation objected against by any
Body;—It was a Paper, I doubt not, some hoped to draw
Mischief from, yet that Mischief had its Disappointment effectual∣ly
tho the Paper had its Success, in being carryed on; for it ap∣peased
the Minds of many, who, being satisfied of having Exone∣rated
their Conscience, acquiesc'd in other Cases with the more Free∣dom;
Nor was the Representation in general without: its
Particular Reasons to be assigned for it, as is further express'd
in the Sequel of the Story: As to the Ministers in all other Cases,
how warmly soever they debated, and with whatsoever Firmness
the several Ministers adhered to their Opinions, yet they submitted
their Votes to the Plurality, and all things were carryed in a regu∣lar
and orderly way, to the great Disappointment of their Enemies,
and to the great Ease and Satisfactions of all good Men of every
Opinion.</P>
<P>Nor should I do Justice here to particular Persons, if I did not
acknowledge, and record it to his Honour, That much of this is
justly due to the Prudence, Patience and Temper of the Reverend
Moderator Mr. <HI>William Wishart,</HI> then Minister of <HI>Leith,</HI> who was
Moderator of the Assembly, and also of the Commission, and who
<PB N="54" REF="278"/>
acted the true Moderator in all these Disputes wisely, Calming,
Tempering, and with Difficulty enough. Reducing the warmest
Debates to a Method of Conclusion;—And I must owne, he
had a Task of no small Difficulty, tho he had, no doubt, the Con∣currence
and Assistance at the Men of most Candor, Temper and
Judgment on either side, since it could not but be visible to every
Thinking Man, who had any Concern for the Good of the Church,
that, to run any Differences up to a Head, could issue in nothing
but the in most Confusion, gratifie the Enemy, grieve all Good Chri∣stians,
and in the end ruine the Peace of the Church.</P>
<P>And this Remark of mine is the more just, in that I could not
but observe, that the Debates on these Affairs had sometimes that
unhappy Warmth, that they seem'd to tend necessarily to a Breach;
and to come to the very point, and Lookers on, of whom I was
one <HI>with a sad Hearty,</HI> expected something Fatal, not to the Union
only, but to the whole Church, must unavoidably have follow'd
every Debate;—and yet we always found cooler Thoughts pre∣vailed,
and wise Men yielding this way and that, continually main∣tained
a Harmony, in concluding what ever there was in debating.</P>
<P>Another piece of Conduct was very Instrumental to preserving
the publick Tranquillity, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Ministers generally speak∣ing,
kept these Debates our of the Pulpit; For tho all manner of
Society was taken up with Disputes of the grand Affair, the Pulpit
was very free of it; I say, generally speaking, what Indiscretions
there were, had not Influence enough on the rest, to recommend the
Example;—Particularly, I think it was a very great Wisdom
in those Ministers, who were for the Union, and who had many
Prompters to it, had the Government to countenance them in it,
and Enemies enough to catch at it, if they had I say, it was their
Wisdom that they forbore it;—And I think these happy Conse∣quences
followed to prove it so.</P>
<P>1. It took away all pretence from those People, who designed, in
this unhappy Game, to play one part of the Church against the other,
and set up one side against the other more effectually.</P>
<P>2. It took away the Ground of Pulpit Clamour, and kept those
People silent, who, had it once begun there, would have been
loudest: by tar in the Exclamation;—For, had one Party first
preached for it, the other would, of Course, have preached against
it, and so the Pulpit been made a meer Stage of Contention.</P>
<P>But, on both sides, the Ministers, as well on private as publick
Days, let it generally alone; They prayed for Direction and Bles∣sing
on the Parliament, and on the Meeting of the Ministers, as
transacting difficult and doubtful Cases, but avoided entring into
Debates.</P>
<P>I think I do them nothing but Justice therefore, in hinting, that
the Temper and Calmness, with which the Generality of the Mini∣sters
behaved in this nice Occasion, was very great, and contribut∣ed
very much to the quiet carrying on the great Work.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="279"/>
Soon after this, the Country Tumults came upon the Stage; and,
as it was <HI>a Peculiar</HI> to this Treaty, that the very Methods taken to
ruine it, concurred to press it forward; so these Tumults served
to open the Eyes, and calm the Spirits of abundance of those honest
people, who were prejudiced before; who, tho they were willing
to oppose the Union, as what did not correspond with their Opi∣nions,
and as they thought with the publick Good; yet, when
they saw it going to Arms, Rebellion, and Blood; and when they
saw <HI>this farther,</HI> that, in order to oppose this National Conjuncti∣on,
they were to joyn in a Civil War against their Governours, with
their and the Nations known Enemies; Their Eyes began to open,
and they slackned very much, from that time, their Appearance
against the Treaty.</P>
<P>This manisestly shewed the difference between the Men, who, in
the Singleness of their Hearts, opposed it, as apprehending it un∣safe
for the establish'd Church, and inconsistent with their National
Engagements; and those, on the other Hand, who opposed it, as
contrary and fatal to the Popish Succession of <HI>James</HI> VIII, as they
called him, and the Episcopal Hierarchy:—And these differed
just as the <HI>Two Harlots in Solomons time;</HI>—The true Mother of
the Child chose to lose her Possession of him, rather than that the
Child should be murthered; so these faithful Friends to their Coun∣try,
however possessed against the Union by the publick Clamour;
yet they would choose to suffer the Inconveniencies they feared, ra∣ther
than see their Country involved in Blood, a Civil War break∣ing
cut in the Bowels of the Kingdom, and Forreign Popish, or Ty∣rannical
Powers invading their Privileges, and pulling down all
before chem.</P>
<P>This will appear to be the Case, in the farther pursuit of the Sto∣ry;
and the sight of this affected the Hearts of a great many of
those, who had any Compassion for their Country; and from this
time forward, the Commission met with less Disturbance from the
hot People on these Heads, but went on calmly, and with all the
Temper and Moderation that could be expected.</P>
<P>The Letter from the Presbytery of Hamilton gave them some little
Disturbance, but it was soon over; and their Circular Letter to
Presbyteries, to endeavour to preserve the publick Peace, not only
shewed their own Resolution to keep all quiet and peaceable, but
discouraged all Endeavours afterward to disorder them: Of which
by it self.—</P>
<P>But things were now grown to a strange Height; and the same
Engines, who so boasted of the Effects of the Representation and
Petition above-said, shewed themselves not idle in their Manage∣ment
ot Affairs abroad for they carryed on the Discontents of
the People to all possible Height.</P>
<P>And indeed the Case of the poor common People of <HI>Scotland</HI> was
very hard, in respect to their Share in these Matters; They are
not the only common People in the World, who take Things by
whole Sale; and who being inflamed with the Clamours and Ar∣guments
<PB N="56" REF="280"/>
of the more knowing sort, their Land-Lords, Leaders,
Heads of Families, and, <HI>as they too properly call them, MASTERS,</HI>
and alarmed with Out-cries of Dangers, and Distresses; which
were to come upon them by the Union <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Things which they could
not Answer, nor had any Reason to Question the Truth of, seeing
their great Men possessed with the Belief of them: 'Tis no wonder
they were exasperated to the highest Degree, and ready to attempt
any thing, to save themselves from the Destruction at Hand.</P>
<P>Again, they were not altogether the People, that were disagree∣able
to them neither, from whom these Discontents began; Had
they been only the Episcopal, or <HI>Jacobite,</HI> or Popish <HI>Party,</HI> that
had started these Things, a short Answer would have opened the
Eyes of the common People and it had sufficed to tell them, from
whom their Objections came.</P>
<P>But when, by the Subtilty and Artifice of these Men, they had
drawn in a great many of the Honest Well-meaning People of the
Country, who were known to be well affected to the present Civil
Establishment of the Nation, and zealous for its Religious Establish∣ment;
when these were seen among the Number of the Warm Op∣posers
of the Union, shaking their Heads at the Articles, and fright∣ed
ed at the terrible Consequences, which were talk'd of;—Who can
wonder, that the rest of the People began to be uneasy, and that
those Uneasinesses, at last, broke out into Excesses, Madnets, and
Distraction.</P>
<P>The People of Scotland, I say, are not the first Instance; How
easily it is to be imposed upon and how readily a Mob is raised
by a Rumour, How soon did the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Afia</HI> pur all <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in
an Uproar, when they made them believe their Worship was in
Danger by Paul's Preaching; and that he not only invaded their
Worship, but had actually defiled she Temple. How readily did
they lay hold of the Blessed Apostle, and had certainly Murdered
him, if the Civil Authority had nor, <HI>assisted by the Military,</HI> rescu∣ed
him our of the Hands of the Mob, and put the Case in the way
of a fair Hearing.</P>
<P>It was not for the poor People, to distinguish the Original of
Causes and Things, nor who was at the Bottom of these Rumours;
it was not for them to distinguish the Hand of Joab in all this;
whether <HI>jacobite</HI> or Papist was the Original of this Matter, was not
for them to examine They saw their Superiors joyning in the same
Complaint, and every Parry saw some of their respective Chiefs
embark'd.</P>
<P>The common People could look no further; The Episcopal
Poor saw their Curates Tooth and Nail against it; The Ignorant
and Indifferent Poor, saw their <HI>Jacobite</HI> Land-Lords and Masters
Railing at it; and which was worse still, the Honest Presbyterian
poor People saw some of their Gentlemen, and such as they had
remarked and noticed <HI>to be Hearty Presbyterians,</HI> yet appearing a∣gainst
it;—Who then can censure the poor depending, uninfor∣med
and abused People?</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="281"/>
And how, but by these concurring, Accidents, was it possible;
the poor deluded People of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> the West, could be drawn in∣to
Mobs and Tumults, in Gratification of that very Party, to whom
they have been the very Antipodes, the Reverse, even in all the
Ages of the Reformation: By whom they had been Plundered;
Rifled, Butchered, and Persecuted, in the most Barbarous Manner,
with Cruelties and Extravagancies innumerable; Will any Man
say, the Men of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> Famous for their Zeal in Religion, and
the Liberties of their Country, even from the very Infancy of the
Reformation, were now turned Enemies to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and ready to Fight against her, in the Quarrel of their Bloody and
Inveterate Enemies, the Papists and <HI>Jacobites?</HI> It could not be.</P>
<P>Will any Man suggest, That <HI>Glasgow</HI> had forgotten her self so
much, that the Blood of her Citizens and inhabitants, shed in the
old Articles of <HI>Pentland,</HI> and <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and the Ravages made up∣on
her, and the Countries round her, after those Unhappy Times,
even to the Confines of the Revolution, were forgotten?—Will
any Body think, the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Men had so far forgot the History of
Twenty Years ago only, that they could now joyn with the Mur∣derers
of their Brethren and Fathers, and take up Arms in favour
of their Mortal Enemies? No, No, Nothing less, It was all Delu∣sion
and meer Artifice, the Party played the Presbyterian against
the Presbyterian, the <HI>Williamite</HI> against the <HI>Williamite;</HI> and hav∣ing
subtilly possess'd a few Honest, but Deluded People, with the
Frenzy of the Time, made them the Tools of their Projects, if pos∣sible,
to bring them to pull down one another, that they might af∣terwards,
with the more Ease, devour them both.—</P>
<P>And this leads me of Course into the Story of the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Rabble,
which now came upon the Stage; and which, in its Turn, tho
raised with a differing Design, was one of the Proofs of GODs
Providence, working every thing, <HI>howsoever pointed at the Union,</HI>
to Act for it, and further its Conclusion.</P>
<P>They had had in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> continual Alarms of the Rising of
the People in the West and North parts, in order, by Force, to
put an end to the Treaty, tho the People themselves knew nothing
of it, nor had any such Design: To day it was in <HI>Angus,</HI> to mor∣row
in <HI>Galloway,</HI> now at <HI>Stirling,</HI> then at <HI>Lanerk,</HI> then at <HI>Hamil∣ton,</HI>
then at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> but nothing yet appeared; and some began
to mock these Fears as groundless:—The Party made their
different Uses of the Reports, to day enlarge them to terrify and
amuse, to morrow lessen them again as meer Rumours, to lssen
the Watchfulness of the Government, and make them secure; but
the Design was manifettly to procure the Tumults they expected, by
reporting they were begun.</P>
<P>Hint these Fears were not groundless, or those Alarms meer <HI>Chi∣mera's,</HI>
may be seen by the Commission of the Kirks Circular Letters
to the several Presbyteries, to desire them to keep the Peace, and to
be carnest to prevent such Tumults; To which the Presbytery of <HI>Ha∣Milton</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="282"/>
gave an Answer, which seemed to object against those Fears
as unjust, tho it did not afterwards appear so. <HI>Vide</HI> the <HI>Appendix,

<P>And now, tho in the Story of the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Rabble, I shall be
obliged to mention the unhappy Slip in those Prudentials, which,
as I have observed, the Ministers, <HI>generally speaking,</HI> behaved with;—I
shall not, however, offend any Person of common Charity,
since I shall be far from saying, the Gentleman here did this with a
Design to raise the Tumult that followed; much less would I so
much as suspect, that he could, in the least, have it in his Thoughts,
to gratify the Folly and projected Destruction of the Kirk of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
which, in all these things, was apparent enough in the se∣cret
Party that pushed on these things.</P>
<P>As to the Rashness and Intemperate Zeal, or <HI>whatever other mista∣ken
Foundation it had,</HI> producing the Heat and Warmth of the Ex∣pression,
I have the Charity to believe, he is convinced of the Er∣ror
of that; and so, while I am obliged to repeat the Circumstance,
I shall, as little as possible, reflect upon the Person, being desirous,
in all Cases, rather to Cover than Expose the Undesigning Failures
of all Honest Men, as what they may be led into by Mistake, but
never prosecute, when their Judgments are better Informed.</P>
<P>But to come to the particulars of this Unhappy Story at <HI>Glasgow,</HI>
which I shall relate with all the Impartiality possible, and without
Respect of Persons, both for the sake of the History, which 'tis ne∣cessary
to Transmit faithfully to Posterity; as also, for setting things
in a true Light, and placing the Guilt where it is justly due, which,
at present, is understood to the prejudice of that City in general;
and of those Honest Gentlemen among the Inhabitants, who had
no Concern in it, unless it were to be Insulted and made Uneasy
by it.</P>
<P>The first Uneasiness that I meet with among the People here, I
mean that was particular, <HI>for the general Uneastnesses about the Treaty
mere uisible every where, as I have hinted already,</HI> was about Addressing.</P>
<P>Great had been the Endeavours of a Party of Men, all over the
Kingdom, to bring in numerous Addresses to the Parliament against
the Treaty, in order to fortity that Argument, which was now
brought in, as a strong Bar against the immediat Proceeding, <HI>viz.</HI>
That it was against the general Inclination of the People; which
you will find Moved in the House, upon the second Reading of the
first Article, as <HI>per</HI> the Minuts.</P>
<P>The Party at <HI>Glasgom</HI> had been very busy to perswade the Magistrates
to Address, as the other Royal Burghs had <HI>many of them</HI> done;
but the Magistrates shewing no Inclination to it, they found there
was no way to bring it about, but by the common People.</P>
<P>Nor could all their Credit with the common People bring it to pass;
the Instruments being chiefly <HI>Jacobites,</HI> Papists, and Episcopal Peo∣ple,
whose Reputation and Interest in the City of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and
parts adjacent, had always been but very low, and now lower than
<PB N="59" REF="283"/>
ever; so that, to effect their Design, they had Recourse to the Po∣licy
of the Times, <HI>viz.</HI> Deluding and Imposing upon others, and
this did their Work; for, had they not made use of some weaker
Brethren, who had more Influence upon the People, they had never
brought it to pass.</P>
<P>To bring some of these, all the Popular Arguments mention∣ed
before were Improved; among others, the Danger of the Kirk
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I believe I may say <HI>in their favour,</HI> was not the least.</P>
<P>Drawn in by these specious Pretences, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party had the
Pleasure to ly by; and see their Work done to their Hand; and
the People being sufficiently Enstamed, they waited the Issue, when
one Unhappy Indiscretion, <HI>to say no worse of it,</HI> finished all their
Hopes, and brought to pass the Mischief they designed, in the best
manner for them they could have wished for.</P>
<P>Some of the Elders of the Church had privatly waited on the
Provost, whether moved by their Minister, or by the common People,
or of their own Heads, I shall not determine, tho 'tis not very diffi∣cult
to Trace it to its beginning; but 'tis apparent, the Minister we
are to mention, as well as some others in the Town, were very ear∣nest
for the thing; Their Business was, it seems, to move the Pro∣vost,
that an Address might be presented to the Parliament against
the Union; They might have commanded a Popular Address among
themselves, but that was not what they desired, but an Address in
the Name of the City by the Provost, Baillies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Provost answered <HI>to this purpose,</HI> That he did not think it
would be prudent for them to Address at this time, that he had been
at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and had consulted the Lord Advocat, and some of the
City of <HI>Glasgows</HI> best Friends, and all unanimously advised them a∣gainst
it, and gave it as their Opinion, it was not their Interest to
do it: Particularly he reminded them, the Parliament had but, the
last Session, granted them the Tax of Two Pennies the Pint; and
if they should now appear as a Town in this Address, it might urge
them to Repeal their Grant, and the City might be a great Sufferer.</P>
<P>This was a very good Reason, why he should decline the Address,
if the Gentlemen had been in a Condition to hearken to Reason; for
if the Magistrates had Addressed, they must also have followed it
with Reasons and Arguments openly as a Body, which, in such Case,
would have been, in all Probability, ill taken by the Parliament,
if, <HI>as is very likely,</HI> those Reasons had been such, as came in from
other places, premptorily Inhibiting their Proceedings, and Im∣peaching
<HI>their Power to Act,</HI> without Leave from their Constituents,
which indeed was the thing now insisted upon, and generally aimed
at in the Project of Addressing.</P>
<P>The Provost having thus, tho very calmly and respectfully, de∣clined
the Matter, the People appeared very uneasy, and some hot
Expressions had been let fall in Discourse about the Town, That
they would have an Address one way or other; But one Unhap∣py
Accident soon discovered the Meaning of the Whole.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="284"/>
On <HI>Thursday</HI> the day of the Fast appointed
by the Commission of the Assembly was kept in <HI>Glasgow,</HI> Mr. C—k
Minister of the Trone Kirk Preached from the Words in <HI>Ezra</HI> 8.21.
<HI>And I proclaimed a Fast at the River of</HI> AHAVA, <HI>that we might afflict
our selves before our GOD, to seek of Him a right Way for us, and for
our little Ones, and for all our Substance.</HI></P>
<P>I shall convince the Gentleman concerned, that this Account is
not made for a Satyr upon him, 'tis too serious a Subject; and
when both he, and those who heard him, reflects on, how much
more his Unhappy Temper, at that time, forc'd from him, than I
set down here, all which I have by me <HI>verbatim,</HI> as he spoke it,
he will, I say, be convinced, that I talk no more, than, in the
Obligation of a Historian to Truth of Fact, I am bound to do.</P>
<P>In the Conclusion of his Sermon, after telling his Hearers the sad
Condition they were brought to, and how forward <HI>Glasgow</HI> used
to be in the Honest Cause, he added to this purpose,</P>
<P><HI>Addresses would not do, And Prayers would not do, there must be
other Methods; 'tis true Prayer was a Duty, but we must not rest
there,—</HI> and closed it with these Words, <HI>Wherefore up, and be
Valiant for the City of our GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I am not at all apprehensive of having the Truth of these Words
questioned, having received them from the Mouths of more than
two or three of the principal Inhabitants of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> who heard
them spoken; and it the misplacing a Word should be snatch at,
<HI>I venture to say,</HI> that this was the full Purport of the Expression,
without the least Variation; as to the Weak Good Man that spoke
them, I will not suggest, that he foresaw the Consequence of them,
or had any such thing in his Design, tho it calls for some Charity
to guess his Meaning; The kindest thing I can say of them, is, that
he did not mean at all what followed, but spoke in his Haste; for
Good forbid I should suggsest he mean'd to raise a Rebellion, and to
bring his Country into all that Blood and Confusion, which, if
GODs Goodness had not prevented it, had certainly followed.</P>
<P>The Sermon ended about eleven a Clock, and the People were so
Enflamed before, that, by one of the Clock, the Mob were gotten
together, their Drum was Beat in the Back-streets, and all the Con∣fusions
we are now to speak of followed.</P>
<P>The next day, the Deacons of the Trades, <HI>which is the same as in</HI>
Londons, <HI>the Masters of the Companies,</HI> followed with a meddling
Number of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">By Tradesmen in <HI>Scotland</HI> is understood none but the meaner sort of People, such as Shoemakers, Smiths, Butchers, Weavers, and the like, as in England are called Handycrafts, the Shop-Keepers, such as Mercers, Drapers, Grocers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all calld Merchants.</NOTE> Tradesmen, came to<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">A Chamber in the Tolbooth, where the Magistrates sit, and where the City Council assembles, and where the Provost generally is every Morning.</NOTE> The Council-House, and
<PB N="61" REF="285"/>
leaving the People below, the Deacons of Trades and some few
went up to the Provost, and demanded of him very rudely, if he
would Address.</P>
<P>The Provost, tho surprized with their manner, composed himself,
and, according to his known Calmness and Steadiness of Temper,
told them, that he was not satisfied to Address; and an Eminent
Inhabitant of the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> The Laird of <HI>Blackhouse,</HI> used a great
many Arguments with them, civilly to perswade them to be easy
and satisfied, and not to promote any Disorders in the City.</P>
<P>While they were thus Discoursing in the Town-House, the Num∣ber
of the People encreased without, and began to be Tumultuous;
but as soon as the Deacons came out, and Reported to them in
short, that the Provost had refused to Address, the People fell a
Shouting, and Raging, and Throwing Stones, and Raised a very
great Uproar.</P>
<P>And here the Deacons deservedly obtain the Title of the Raisers
of this Rabble; for, had they related the Calmness, the Reason∣ings,
and the Manner, with which the Provost very discreetly An∣swered
them, the People might very easily have been quietly dis∣missed,
but now it was too late, the Answer, as it was given to
them, was only in gross, that the Provost was Resolute, and would
not Address.</P>
<P>Enraged thus, they slung Stones at the Windows, and, as much
as they could, Insulted the Provost; but he found Means to with∣draw,
so that they could not hurt him for that time.</P>
<P>In this Rage, they went directly to the Provosts House, got into
it, took away all his Arms, which were about twenty five Musquets,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some few things were stollen in the Throng, but that was
not much: From thence they went to the Laird of <HI>Blackhouse's</HI>
Dwelling, broke his Windows, and shewed their Teeth, and thus
the first Tumult ended.</P>
<P>The Provost retired for a while out of Town, and the Laird of
<HI>Blackhouse</HI> also, not knowing what the Issue of these things might
be.</P>
<P>I pay no Complement at all here, but a Debt to Truth, in not∣ing,
that the Provost of <HI>Glasgow</HI> for that time, <HI>Aird</HI> Esquire,
was an Honest, Sober, Discreet Gentleman, one that had always
been exceedingly Beloved, even by the common People, particular∣ly
for his Care of, and Charity to the Poor of the Town; and, at
another time, would have been the last Man in the Town they
would have Insulted.</P>
<P>I mention this to obviate the Supposition, that the Rabble took
this Occasion to Insult him, upon former Resentments, as has been
usual in like Cases.</P>
<P>The Provost being withdrawn, and the Address they designed
thus baulk'd.</P>
<P>They set it on Foot without him, and indeed they effectually An∣swered
the Magistrates Desire, who resolved, if there was an Ad∣dress,
it should be a meer Mob Address.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="286"/>
Many a mean Step they took to get Hands, by Threatning, Af∣frighting,
and Hurrying People into it, Taking Youths and meer
Childrens Hands to it.</P>
<P>Every Man that refused to sign it, was Threatned to be Rabbled,
and have his House Plundered, which made a great many Timorous
People sign it that did not approve of it.</P>
<P>This being the Method, it may easily be imagined, the Address
was not many days a finishing; and such as it was, they sent it
away by four of the Townsmen, whereof the first two<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Robert Scot <HI>Decon of the Taylors,</HI> Stevenson <HI>Deacon of the Shoemkers,</HI> John Bowman <HI>Dean of Guild, and</HI> John Hamilton <HI>Gentleman,</HI> were the Four that went up to the Parliament with the Address.</NOTE> were
the Deacon of the Taylors, and the Deacon of the Shoemakers;
The other two that went with it were Gentlemen, too well known
to be suspected of desiring any such kind of Tumultuous Proceed∣ings,
but complyed with their Desire, in order to prevent worse
Consequences.</P>
<P>If the Multitude of Addresses, which have been boasted of, as a
Declaration of the Aversion of the People to the Union, may be
guess'd at by this, those Gentlemen, who bring this as an Argu∣ment,
have small Reason to Boast, and need not be very Forward,
to have the Particulars Examined into.</P>
<P>The Address having thus been signed, and sent away, the Peo∣ple
begun to be quiet again, and the Tumults seemed to have an
end; The Provost, who had fled to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> came home again,
and every one went quietly about their Business, till, a little while
after, a new Occasion set all in a Flame again, worse than it was
before, and made it appear, who was at the Bottom of it all.</P>
<P>And here the Warm Gentleman, who, from the Pulpit put the
Match to this Gun Powder, may see who laid the Train;—The
Triflle of Addressing was the least thing they sought for, tho
that served a purpose also;—And these good People, who were
drawn in to begin it, saw no farther; but now it appeared to be
all <HI>Jacobite</HI> and Papist at the Bottom; That Blood and Confusion
was the thing they drove at, and King <HI>James,</HI> Prelacy, Tyranny,
Popery, and all the Mischiefs this Nation has to fear from them, lay
hid in the Design, as will presently appear, and the poor Thought∣less
Multitude were only Hurryed into it, by a Conjunction of Mi∣stakes.</P>
<P>The second Rabble had a Beginning as small as the first, tho not
so soon laid, because the first had only the Address in View, and
was managed by a few, that the Contrivers of those Disorders had
Imposed upon, and Deluded; but this part was under the more
immediat Conduct of the very Party themselves, and was intro∣duced
as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="287"/>
One of the Magistrates<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It was Baillie Hamilton.</NOTE> of the City, had committed a<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Fellows Name was <HI>Parker,</HI> a Loose, Vagabond, Profligate Fellow of a very ill Character, a Spinner of Tabacco by Impolyment, but a very Scandalous Person.</NOTE>
Fellow to the Tolbooth for Thest;—He had, it seems, been
taken offering to Sale a Musquet, or some other things, which, it
was made appear, belonged to the Provost of the City, and which
was taken out of his House in the time of the Rabble above-men∣tioned.</P>
<P>This Fellow lay in the Tolbooth for some time; but it was obs∣served,
that, in an Evening, there would be several of the common
People at the Window, talking to him thro' the Grates of the Pri∣son;—The
Provost apprehending, that the Imprisonment of
this Fellow, might be a Pretence for a new Disturbance, resolved to
discharge him; but, that it might not seem to be done for Fear,
took a<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">This is called there a Bond of Presentation, and is all one with a simple Recognizance without Bail.</NOTE> Bond of him, to appear again, when called for, and,
among the rest of the People, who came to talk with him at the
Grate, was one <HI>Finlay,</HI> a loose sort of a Fellow, who had formerly
been a Sergeant in <HI>Dumbartons</HI> Regiment in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and who
openly profssed himself a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> a Fellow that followed no Em∣ploy,
but his Mother kept a little<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The common Name for an Ale House, or Inn, in that Country.</NOTE> Change House at the re∣motest
part of the Town on the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> side.</P>
<P>The Fellow had given his Comrades an Account, that the Magi∣strates
had taken a Bond of him; and the next Morning, this <HI>Fin∣lay,</HI>
and a Rabble with him, comes up to the Clerks Chamber, another
Office in the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The Town House, in which is their Offices, and also the Prison for the City; It is generally like the Guild Hall of a City, or the Town House in <HI>England,</HI> saving that the Prison is generally in the same House in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> where the Magistrates meet, and there they
demand this Bond of the Clerk, it being put into his Hands.</P>
<P>The Magistrates willing to take away all Occasions, of Tumult,
and to leave them no Excuse, ordered the Bond to be delivered up,
for the Gentlemen Rabble had now the full Command of the Town.</P>
<P>But to let it be seen, that these were but seeking Occasions, not∣withstanding
the Provost had told them, they should have the Bond
delivered up; and they had now no Reason but to be satisfied, the
Clerk having Orders to deliver it; They continued together, re∣solving
to Insult the Provost, at his coming out.</P>
<P>The Provost not imagining any Danger, having granted their
Request, comes innocently out of the Tolbooth, and went toward
his own House; The Rabble immediatly gathered about him,
<PB N="64" REF="288"/>
Thrusting and Abusing him, and not with Villainous Language only,
but with Stones and Dirt, and such like thrown at him.</P>
<P>He would have made to his own House, but the Multitude increas∣ing,
and growing Furious, he took Sanctuary in a House, and run∣ning
up a Stair Case, lost the Rabble for some time, they pursuing
him into a wrong House; However, they searched every Apart∣ment
to the Top of the Stair, and came into the very Room where
he was; But the same Hand that smote the Men of <HI>Sodom</HI> with
Blindness, when they would have Rabbled the Angels, protected
him from this many Headed Monster, and so Blinded them, that
they could not find him: It is the Opinion of many of the Sober∣est
and most Judicious of the Citizens, that, if they had found him,
their Fury was, at that time, so past all Government, that they
would have Murdered him, and that in a manner Barbarous enough;
and if they had, as we say of a Bull Dog, once but Tasted Blood,
who knows where they would have ended?</P>
<P>The Provost was hid in a Bed, which folded up against the Wall,
and which they never thought of taking down;—Having escap∣ed
this eminent Danger, he was conveyed out of Town the next
day by his Friends, and went for the second time to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Rabble was now fully Master of the Town, they ranged the
Streets, and did what they pleased; No Magistrate durst show his
Face to them, they challenged People as they walk'd the Streets
with this Question, <HI>Are you for the Union?</HI> And no Man durst
owne it, but at their extremest Hazard.</P>
<P>The next thing they did, was to search for Arms in all the Hou∣ses
of those, that had appeared for the Union; And first they
went to the Dean of Guild, and, upon his refusing to give them
his Arms, they took them away by Force; They stopt here a little,
but having given out, that they would search the Houses of all
that were for the Union, the Magistrates Assembled, and Consider∣ing,
that, if the Citizens were Disarmed, and the Rabble postest
of their Weapons, they might, in the next place, possess their
Houses, Wives and Wealth, at their Command; and that it was
better to Defend themselves now, than be Murdered and Plunder∣ed
in cold Blood; They resolved therefore to raise some Strength,
to oppose this Violence, and accordingly ordered the Town Guards
to be doubled that Night, and removed the place of Arms from
the usual Guard House to the Tolbooth;—And that this Guard
should be of Select Persons, such as they knew.</P>
<P>Accordingly Orders were sent to all the Captains of the City
Militia, that each of them should bring twelve Men with them,
such as, they could depend upon, would stand by them, to
secure the Peace of the City; and this was besides the ordinary
Guard.</P>
<P>This was done readily, and with great Secrecy and Celerity, the
Captains of the Militia being Faithful Honest Gentlemen, brought
their Men without any Noise, Beat of Drum, or the like, and leav∣ing
<PB N="65" REF="289"/>
the ordinary Guard at the usual<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The usual Place for the Guard of the Town is in the Trone-Gate Street.</NOTE> place, and were that Night
encreased to a whole Company, and this Select Guard was plac'd
in the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In the Tolbooth one Pair of Stairs high.</NOTE> Council-Chamber.</P>
<P>The Rabble, who had resolved to be as good as their Words,
were now gotten together; and whether they thought the Magi∣strates
were met in the Council-Chamber, and so they resolved to
begin with them; or whether they had Intelligence, that they
were upon their Guard, is not certain; but about nine a Clock at
Night they gathered about the Tolbooth, and seeing a Centinel
plac'd at the Top of the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Stone Steps on the Out side where the Iron Rails are and where the Officers stand to read Proclamations or any Publick Acts.</NOTE> Stair, <HI>Finlay,</HI> of whom before, is or∣dered
to go up, and see what they were a doing, as he called it.</P>
<P>When he came to the Top of the Stair, the Centinel challeng'd
him and thrust him back; but he comes on again, and thrusts
in with the Centinel, and gets by him.</P>
<P>At this Juncture, one of the Citizens, who was privately appoint∣ed
to meet as above, was just coming up; and having pass'd as
privately as he could thro' the Mob, who were at the Stair Foot to
the Number of about 100, being a Select Party only, for the rest
were not then got together, was going up the Stairs; This Gentle∣man
seeing a Fellow assault the Centinel, boldly stept up to him,
and knockt him down on the Stair Head with the Butt End of his
Musquet, and immediately calls the Guard.</P>
<P>The Guard immediately took to their Arms, and headed by one
Lieutenant <HI>Lindsay</HI> an old Soldier of King <HI>William's,</HI> but now a
Burgess and Inhabitant of the City, they came down and drew up
at the Foot of the Stair.</P>
<P>Some Pieces were Fired in the Street, but whether at the Guard
or no, was not known; The Multitude was great by this Time,
and being late at Night, it could not well be discern'd: But as
they had all the Reason in the World to expect it, they fell reso∣lutely
to Work with them, and Sallying upon the Rabble, they im∣mediately
fled and dispers'd.</P>
<P>Having thus broke the first Body of them, it was observ'd, that
they only fled from the immediate Shock, but stood in Throngs
under the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The new Buildings at the Cross have small Piazzas of Stone and both Sides, under which the Shops are, and the People may walk in well Weather.</NOTE> Piazzas, and in the Heads of Closses<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Closses are the same with By Lanes or Alleys.</NOTE>, to see
what the Guard would do; and that, with one Hallow, they could
all be together again in a Moment, whereupon a Party was ordered
down<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">There are but four principal Streets which all meet at the Cross, and lead to the four Gates of the City.</NOTE> every Street to clear the Pizzas and Closses, and see
<PB N="66" REF="290"/>
the Rabble effectually dispers'd, which they did, but were all the
way assaulted from the Houses and out of the Closses with Curses
and Stones; The former did not much Hurt except to the Givers,
but the latter Wounded several of the Inhabitants, and some were
very much hurt.</P>
<P>Had they been able to have renew'd this Guard, the Publick Peace
had been maintain'd, and the whole Design of this Rabble disap∣pointed:
But it is to be noted, these Gentlemen were all Citizens,
Heads of Families, and of the principal Inhabitants; The Com∣monalty
was universally debauch'd, and not to be trusted, and
the Gentlemen could not do Duty every Night, neither had all
that were Zealous enough against the Tumults, either Bodies to
bear the Fatigue of Soldiers, or Hearts to adventure; and those
that were Forwardest, could not be always in Arms;—This
first Piece of Work was on <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, the next Night they re∣liev'd
the Guard by the like Select Number, and all was quiet; for,
while these Men appear'd, the Rabble durst not stir.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday,</HI> the Magistrates Summoned the Town Council, and,
sending for the Deacons of the Tradesmen, the thing proposed was,
What Course should be taken to secure the Peace of the City, and
keep the Magistrates and Inhabitants from Plunder and Insult.</P>
<P>The Deacons of Trades, subtilly, and as appear'd, designedly, at
least such of them as were in the Design, proposed, That this Select
Guard should be omitted, and pretended to promise, That, if any
Tumult happened, they would come to the Town Guard with their
Men to defend the City; which, whoever observes how well they
performed, will think it no Breach of Charity, to say they never de∣signed
it:—However, for this Week, there was no more Tumult,
but the Mob reign'd Masters, and <HI>Finlay,</HI> who now had made himself
one of their Leaders, set up a Guard at the Upper End of the Town
near the Cathedral, as it were in Opposition to the Town Guard.</P>
<P>This whole Week was spent in Amusements, and raising Reports
of the Rising of the People at <HI>Stirling,</HI> at <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and in <HI>Angus;</HI>
and that a great Army of them was to <HI>Rendezvous</HI> at <HI>Hamilton,</HI>
from whence they were to March to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to raise the Parlia∣ment:
<HI>Finlay</HI> gives out, That he will March with all the Men of
<HI>Glasgow</HI> to meet their Brethren at <HI>Hamilton</HI> on the same Design;—by
whose Assistance all this was done, the Government was
too Merciful to make a narrow Enquiry, and so I must leave it as they
did in the dark: Having brought the Folly and Madness of the poor
People to such a Height, <HI>Finlay</HI> actually gets together about 45 <HI>Men,</HI>
or that was the most of the great Army he raised; and on the <HI>Friday</HI>
following, this Contemptible Wretch having made himself their Gene∣ral,
Marches out of the City with them for <HI>Hamilton;</HI> they were Armed
with Musquets and Swords, such as they had taken out of the Ma∣gistrates
Houses; and (wherever he procur'd it, for every one knows
he had it not of his own) he Distributed to every Man a Dollar;—And
thus in Arms against their Native Country, and the Pro∣testant
Religion, these poor Deluded People March'd away, under
the Command of an Abject Secondrel Wretch, that openly profess'd

himself a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and that, with his Good Will, would have seen
all the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> ruin'd.</P>
<P>But to such a Pass were Things now come, and who can Account
for some Critical Junctures, in which Men may be brought to ruine
themselves with their own Hands, and never suffer themselves to
listen to the Cautions of their Friends.</P>
<P>The Town, tho' rid of <HI>Finlay</HI> and his Vanguard, enjoy 'd not the
more Peace, or were in less Danger, for the Mob that remain'd kept
up their Guard, threaten'd yet worse things 'than had been, done,
and were afterward as good as their Words to a Title.</P>
<P>The Government, it may be supposed, were constantly acquaint∣ed
with those things, and their Forbearance had not a little hearten∣ed
up the Party that push'd these Mischiefs on; However, being
loth to come to Extremities, they tryed Gentler Methods first, and
the Lord High Commissioner having laid it before the Parliament,
they immediately pass'd an Act, Discharging the Mustering of
Troops in the Country during this Session, and a, Proclamation was
published against Tumults, and both these were sent to <HI>Glasgow</HI> to
be published.</P>
<P>If should be noted here, That, by the Act of Security, any of the
Nobility, Gentry, or Towns, might meet in Arms, Muster and Ex∣ercise
their Fencible Men, and the like, upon any Occasion of which
they were Judges; which was done in order to make the Militia of
<HI>Scotland</HI> more Serviceable, or as some think <HI>in Terrorem</HI> to Serve a
Cause; but be that as it will, it may remain undetermined; but,
at this Juncture, the Parliament foresaw, it might be a Handle for the
drawing together any Number of Men at such a Time as this, and
might be dangerous to the Peace, wherefore they caused an Act to
be brought in to Repeal that part of the Act of Security, for so long
only as the present Parliament was sitting.</P>
<P>When this Act of Parliament and Proclamation came to Town,
which was on the <HI>Monday</HI> After <HI>Finlay's</HI> March, the Magistrates as∣sembled
about ten in the Morning, and caused the Messenger that
brought it to read it at the Cross; Accordingly the Messenger goes
up to the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Head of the Stone Stair on the Outside of the Tolbooth just fronting the Cross, the same mentioned before where the Centinel stood.</NOTE>
usual place, and read first the Act of Parliament, the
Magistrates were below, and the Officers attending as usual, and a
vast Multitude of People were got together to hear what it was, be∣fore
the Officer had done, the People began to make a Noise, and
throw Stones at him; but however, the Man went on, and read
out the Act, and began the Proclamation against Tumults; but he
had hardly read the Title of the Proclamation, when the Stones
came so thick, there was no standing it, and the poor Follow not
a little Bruised was driven off the Stair.</P>
<P>Upon this the Magistrates ordered one of the Town Officers to go
up and Read, which he did as far as he could but was in like manner
<PB N="68" REF="292"/>
driven off by the Fury of the Stoning: In the <HI>Interim</HI> of this, the
Magistrates had sent for the Town Guard to protect the second Officer
in Reading; The Officer of the Guard seeing the other Officer abused
thus before their Faces, commands his Men to fall upon the Rabble
with the Clubs of their Musquets, which they did, and knockt down
some of them; but the Tradesmen that were upon the Guard, in
the very Action deserted, and refused to obey the Command of
their Officers, which so encouraged the Rabble, that they came on
again with Shouts and Huzza's, and with Volleys of Stones they
fell upon the few of the Guard that were Faithful, and drove them
off from the Street.</P>
<P>The Officer that commanded them Retreated them into the Guard
House, but this was not a place to be defended against such a Mul∣titude,
so in short they broke in upon them and disarm'd them,
and well it was they came off without Blood,—some of them
were very much Bruised with Stones.</P>
<P>The Rabble now flusht with Victory, were in a terrible Fury,
and this was die most Outragious Part of the whole Tran∣saction;
having disarm'd the Guard, the next thing was to Storm
the Tolbooth, immediately they get Ladders to the Windows, and
breaking in, they seize upon 250 Halberts which are the Towns
Arms; with these upon their Shoulders in Rank and File they
Rov'd about the Streets, and made their Rendezvous at the Old
Castle where their Guard was kept; Here they gave out, That, in
the Afternoon, they would come down and Plunder the Mer∣chants
Houses, nay, and threatened their Lives too, which put the
whole City in an Unspeakable Consternation.</P>
<P>Nor were they wanting in some part of their Threatened Execu∣tion,
for about three in the Afternoon they Detach'd a Party of
about twenty Men Arm'd, some with Musquets, some with Halberts,
these, with a Drum before them, came to the Cross, and from
thence took their March down the High Streets, breaking open the
Doors and Houses of who ever they pleased, pretending to scarch
for Arms, but Stole and Plundered whatever came in their way, and
thus they continued till ten a Clock at Night.</P>
<P>They got not above thirty Musquets, with some Pistrols and
Swords, but the Terror of the Inhabitants is nor to be express'd,
who were oblig'd so bear this Violence without Complaint; This
sinall Party was follow'd by a vast Throng of Boys and Idle Fellows
like themselves, which encreased the Fright of the Citizens.—</P>
<P>Having thus Ranged the City at Pleasure till about ten a Clock
at Night, they March'd away with the Spoil of their Masters up to
their Main Guard, from thence they Beat their Tatoo round the
Town like a Garison; and indeed they were no less, for they had
the City in their full Possion, and every Bodies Life and Goods
at their Mercy.</P>
<P>Their Ruideness in this pretended Search for Arms is not to be de∣seribed,
and had they met with any Opposition, do doubt it would
have been world; They came into the Rooms where Persons that
lay Sick were jusst Dying, and put all things into inexpressible Con∣fusion,
<PB N="69" REF="293"/>
They came into Chambers, where Women were Lying in,
and Barbarously made them Rise, pretending to Search under their
Beds for Arms: In short, except that there was no Blood shed,
they acted the exact part of an Enraged Ungoverned Multitude.</P>
<P>But, to return to their Army of Fourty Five, which was all this
while on its March; And were advanc'd as far as <HI>Kilsyth,</HI> on
their Way to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Government, who had an exact Account of all these things,
and who had tried all the Gentle Methods of Proclamations, Acts
of Parliament, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Finding to what Height Things were brought,
and that nothing bur Force Could Remedy Them, prepar'd to be
before-hand with these Forward Gentlemen; And having an
Account both of their March and Number, The Lord Commissio∣ner
ordered a Detachment of Dragoons, joyn'd with some Horse
Granadeers of the Guard, under the Command of Colonel <HI>Campbell,</HI>
Uncle to the Duke of <HI>Argyll,</HI> to March with all Expedition for
<HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Finlay,</HI> in the mean time being at <HI>Kilsyth,</HI> has Notice of the
March of these Dragoons, within a few Hours After his Arrival
There; And hearing no News of the great Parties of
5 and 6000, which he had perswaded his Men would meet
him there; And being alarm'd at the News of the Dragoons
he sends back—<HI>Campbell,</HI> another of the Ring-Leaders of his
Rabble, to bring up the second Body which was to be ready to fol∣low,
and which were Reported to be 400, <HI>but they Thank'd him,
and Stay'd at Home;</HI> And with the rest he March'd to <HI>Hamilton,</HI>
where he Arriv'd on <HI>Sunday</HI> about Noon, the third day after his
March from <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P>Here he Quartered his Army that Night, and finding, as before,
none of the Friends that were to Assemble from all Parts, nor no
News of them, he bestow'd a Volley of Curses upon them, and
Marches directly back to <HI>Glasgow,</HI> where he Arriv'd, to the no
small Mortification of his Fellows, on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the next day but
one After the Plunderings I have related before; They had Halted
at <HI>Rungland,</HI> a Burgh about two Miles from <HI>Glasgow,</HI> where, as I suppose,
they called a Council of War among themselves; but, being all Voters, they Agreed upon nothing, but to March Home,
which accordingly they did; and, in Order of Battel enter'd the
City, and March'd directly up to their Main Guard aforesaid: Here
they made, <HI>say my Author,</HI> their Rendezvous, having not thought
fit to keep the Field any longer.</P>
<P>And now they began to think a little, for I cannot allow my self to
say they had done it before, Their Danger began now to show it self,
and to stare in their Faces a little; They began to consider what
they had been doing with others, and what was now like to be do∣ing
with them; They had no more Protection from the Act about
Muttering, and the proclamation began to work with them; And
now they did the only Rational Act of their whole Management,
and which indeed saved all their Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="294"/>
On <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning, having maturely weighed their Affairs, they
resolved to separate, and lay down their Arms, which accordingly
they did very quietly and calmly, and carryed their Arms, not to
the Magistrates, where they had them, but to the Deacons of their
Trades, who they knew were their Friends.</P>
<P>How it came to pass, That Providence, whom they had so far
provoked, Inspir'd them with this Prudence, so seasonably for their
own Safety, none, but that Infinite Goodness, that punishes less
than Crimes deserve, can say; 'Tis most certain, they had no par∣ticular
Intelligence of the March of the Queens Troops, for the City;
it self knew nothing of them more than in general; But it was not
full two Hours After they had separated, delivered their Arms, and
all was quiet, but the Dragoons enter'd the Town, not a Magi∣strate,
nor an Inhabitant knew of them, till they saw them upon
the Street, to their no small Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The whole Party was about 220 Men; They had march'd with
great Secrecy all Night, and suffered no Body to pass by them, to
carry Notice before of their Coming—; When they came near
the City, Colonel <HI>Campbell</HI> detach'd an Advanc'd Party of twenty
five Dragoons, under the Command of Lieutenant <HI>Pollock</HI> who knew
the Town, and knew where <HI>Finlay</HI> liv'd, the whole Body following
at a small Distance.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant entering the Town, stopt, and Allighted just at
<HI>Finlay's</HI> Door, and rushning immediately in with two or three Dra∣goons,
they find <HI>Finlay</HI> and one <HI>Montgomery,</HI> another of the Knot,
but Famous for nothing that ever I heard of, but his being taken
with him, sitting by the Fire, They seiz'd them immediately, and
by this time the whole Body was entered the City, March'd down
to the Cross, and Drew up there on the Street, where they sate
still upon their Horses, it Raining very hard all the time, which was
about three Hours.</P>
<P>The Mob of the City were in no small Consternation, as may
well be supposed, at this Appearance; And several, whose Guilt
gave them Ground to think of the Gallows, made the best of their
way out of the Town; There was no Appearance of any Rescue,
and the Dragoons Commanded the People off of the Street, and to
keep their Houses—; Two Fellows had the Boldness to Beat a
Drum in two several parts of the City, but the Gentlemen they
call'd for, had more Wit than to come, and the Drummers, with
very much Difficulty, narrowly escap'd being killed.</P>
<P>The Dragoons having secur'd their Prisoners, and mounted
them on Horse-back, with their Legs tyed under the Horeses Bellys;
Never so much as Allighted or Baited their Horses, but Marched
away the same Afternoon to <HI>Kilyth,</HI></P>
<P>As they were going away, they had Tome Stones Thrown at
them tram the Tops of Houses, and some that were stragling be,
hind had like to have been Knock'd off of their Horses, but Six or
Seven Dragoons coming back, they were fetched off without Hurt.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="295"/>
No sooner were they gone out of the Town, but the Drums beat
again in all the Streets, and the Rable got together with all the
Rage and Venome imaginable, and coming to the Magistrates, they
told them in so many words, that they should send some of their
Number to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> immediately, for that if they had not their
two Men delivered to them, they would pull their Houses down
about their Ears. Some have blam'd the Magistrates for sending to
<HI>Edinburgh;</HI> But it such would consider Circumstances, how the
Dragoons were gone, they had an Enrag'd Mob to deal with, and
no strength to Defend themselves, it can not but be thought the
Gentlemen were in the right to comply with the juncture of the Time,
and Gratifie rather than Exasperate them, when they were abso∣lurely
in their Power;</P>
<P>The Magistrates, however, according to the Command of their
Masters the Mobb, (for such at this time they were,) sent away two
of the Baillies of the Town, and same of the Deacons of Trades
went with them, but they soon came back again as wise as they
went, having received a severe Check from the Council by the
Mouth of the Lord Chancellor; and it was once within a little of
their being committed to Prison with the other.</P>
<P>Thus ended, this petty War, being the only Violence we meet
with in the whole Transaction. I had not been so large in the Re∣lation
of so triffling an Affair, but that it serves to clear up several
other Cases to the World, which otherwise there are several Mistakes
about.</P>
<P>I And principally indeed for the sake of the City of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> a
City which in all Ages since the Reformation, and in the very Re∣formation
it self, has been particularly Famous for Honesty, Zeal,
and Bravery in a constant Opposition to the Enemies either of the
Religion or Liberties of their Countrey—, a City Eminent for the
True and Sincere Profession of the Reformed Religion, and forward
upon all Occasions to spend their Blood and Treasure in Defence of
it: And as nothing can be more Untrue than to suggest, this Tu∣mult
was the Act and Deed of the City of <HI>Glasgow:</HI> So to clear her
of that Scandal, I thought my self oblig'd to do her Justice, by set∣ting
the Case in its true Light; nothing clears up the Innocence of
a Person or Party like bare matter of Fact, and therefore I have Im∣partially
related this Story just as I receiv'd it upon the Spot from se∣veral
of the principal Inhabitants of the City, whose Integrity in the
Relation I have no Reason to question.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain, than that the Tumult at <HI>Glasgow</HI> had its
Rise and Beginning among the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party: In all the Rabble and
Riots, they were secured as they past the Streets, they were Carrest
by the Mob, they Huzza'd them to the Work, their Houses were never
search'd for Arms, nor the least offered to their Persons; The
very Leaders of the Rabble were of their Party, and indeed their
Friends mixt themselves with the Rabbles on all Occasions, to prompt
them to Insult the Citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="296"/>
The Rabblers themselves on the other hand were a sort of Peo∣ple
ignorantly Inflam'd by this Party, and unhappily set on Fire by an
Accident which had its beginning rather in an Ignorance of the Plot
of that Party, than Design to serve them in it.</P>
<P>But for the City of <HI>Glasgow</HI> it is clear, not a Citizen of any Note,
not a Magistrate, not a Merchant, not any thing that can be cal∣led
Denominating to a Place, but what Abhorr'd it, and as far as
they durst Opposed it; and I think 'tis hard they should first sall
under the Misfortune, and then under the Scandal of it too;
And for that Reason I have been thus particular in the Story.</P>
<P>Again, here may be seen a small Scetch of the Petitioners and
Addressers against the Union, &amp; of their Original, who they are that
were moved, and who moved them; not a Papist, not a Jacobite,
not a Prelatist in <HI>Scotland</HI> but what Declar'd themselves against the
Union, and those honest Men that un happily Approve them in
that, may see what Blessed Company they were yoked with, which is
a Hint I cannot avoid leaving upon Record for their Instruction.</P>
<P>I should have told you that the <HI>Sunday</HI> After being the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>De∣cember,</HI>
the Dragoons returned to <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and in stead of return∣ing
the two Prisoners they had taken, carried away three mere,
and had Directions for others, but it seems they were fled.</P>
<P>They went to <HI>Hamilton</HI> also, and seiz'd two Gentlemen &amp; a Lady,
who belong'd to the Dutchess—, and who, they said, <HI>Finlay</HI>
Accused, but both these, and all the rest, were, After the Union
was sinished, Discharged with out Punishment; the Merciful Go∣vernment
of Her Majesty rather delighting to Pity, than to Punish
the Follies of the poor deluded people; shewing them the Difference
between the legally Establish'd Power, which they blindly
Opposed, and the past Implacable and Merciless Tyrrany, which
they as blindly Espoused.</P>
<P>And thus happily Ended the Tumult at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> which put the
Honest People of both Nations in no small Apprchciisions; and
which, if the Party had obtain'd their Design; in getting the poor
People into Arms in other Places, might have been Fatal enough.</P>
<P>Mean time, the Queen was not Unconcerned at these Disorders,
and Troops were sent from <HI>England</HI> to the Borders, to be ready to
Assist the <HI>Scots</HI> Forces, and to support the Government, if there had
been Occasion; having Orders given them to Quarter in the most
Northerly Towns of <HI>England,</HI> and to take their tardier Orders from
the Lord High Commissinoner of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as there should be Oc∣casion.
But the Success of Things beginning to change a little After
thesc Hurreys, there was no Occasion for them.</P>
<P>The Parliament was now entered upon the closs Debate of the
Articles, and the first and chief Points being past in the House, it
was plain to every body, that the House was resolved to go thorow
the Work; And it is no wonder if the last Struggles of all the
Parties Opposing it, were now seen.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="297"/>
All the Attempts to raise Tumults, and to Rabble the Parliament
out of it, had proved Abortive; And it was found impossible to
bring the Common People into any thing Extraordinary, while
few or none of the Gentry thought fit to appear with them; All that
had hitherto been done, was, by an underhand kind of Management
of the <HI>jacobite</HI> Party, <HI>as they called them,</HI> to see, if possible, they could
push the Presbyterians, or the meet Rabble of the Common People
upon making some Disturbance, that so they might pull down their
Enemies, by the Hands of-one another, and see their Work done
for them; This was apparent from the manner of Proceedings,
which was by dropping Papers, and sending about private Mes∣sages
from no particular Person, but as from their Brethren in this
or that Shire, Inviting, Directing, and Encouraging the People
to Meet and Assembe, to surnish themselves with Arms and Amu∣nition,
aud Narneing Place and Day where to Meet and Assmble,
in order to March to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and to Raise the Parliament, and
prevent the Ruine, <HI>such they then called the Union,</HI> of their Coun∣trey,
and their being given up to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>They took all these Courses to Raise and Excite the People, but
still they sound it Ineffectual as to Meetings and Rendezvouzes, ex∣cept
as you have seen; however, the Parliament took some notice
of it, the Lord Commissioner laid it before them on the 29 No∣vember,
and they immediately caused a Proclamation to be publish∣ed,
to prevent Tumultary and Irregular Convocations of the Liedges;
This was the same which was Read in <HI>Glasgow</HI> at the Time of the
Tumult, as aforesaid, when the People Stoned the Messenger that
Read it, off from the Head of the Stairs of the Town Hall or Tol∣booth.</P>
<P>It had been considered, that there was a Clause in the Act of Se∣curity,
which Impowered the People to Meet, or Conveen in Arms,
under pretence of Exercising the Fencible Men—; The Clause was
as follows.</P>
<P>And for a further Security to this Realm, Her Majesty with
Advice and Consent aforesaid, Statutes and Enacts, That the
whole Protestant Heretors and all the Burghs mithin the same,
shall forthwith provide themselves with Fire Arms for all the
fencible Men Who are Protestants within their respectiveiv Bounds,
and those of the Bore proportioned to a Bullet of 14 Drop weight
running, And the said Here Heretors and Burghs are hereby Im∣porwered
and Ordained to Disciplin and Exetrcise their Fenciple
men once in the Month at least.</P>
<P>Now the first Rumours of Country Tumults had been pretended
to be founded upon this Clause, and that under pretence of this
Exercising and Disciplining the Funcible Men, any number of Men
might appear together in Arms without Breach of the Law—.
This was indeed a wide Gap in the publick Peace, at which there
was Room for a whole Army to enter. for any of the Gentry, No∣bility,
<PB N="74" REF="298"/>
or Heretors, who were Disaffected to the Affair now in hand
under the protection of this Clause, pretending only Exercising and
Disciplining the Fencible Men, might Assemble together, and keep
To gether without any Limitation of Number or Time, still they had
formed a sufficient Force, and then March'd, to the Destrucion of
the Government, the Laws, and all the Defences of the publick
Peace.</P>
<P>It was time now to stop this Breach, and therefore an Act
was past in the House, to Repeal the above-said Clause, so far
forth as is extended to the Meeting, Musteri'ng, and Conveening
together of the People during the sitting of the Parliament; which
Act being a very plain Evidence to the Truth of what I am upon, I
have Added here, as being not long enough to interrupt the Thread
of this Discourse.</P>
<P>OUR SOVEREIGN LADY Considering, That, by the 3d
Act of the 2d Session of this Parliament, Intituled, Act for Se∣curity
of the Kingdom, It is Statute and Enacted, That the
whole Protestant Heretors, And all the Burghs within the same, shall furthwith provide themselves with Fire Arms for all the
Fencible Men, who are Protestants, within their respective Bounds,
and the said Heretors and Burghs are thereby Impowered and Or∣dained
to Discipline and Exercise their Fencible Men once in
the Month at least; And also Consderirig, That the Disorderly
and Seditious Meetings and Tumults in some Places in the Coun∣trey,
do make it necessary, at this Occasion, to Sispend the Effect
of the foresaid Clause, during this Session of Parliament allen∣narly.
Therefore Her Majesty with Advice and Consent of
the Estates of Parliament, doth bereby Suspend the Effect of the
foresaid clause, and that during this Session of Parliament at∣lennarly.
And further, Her Majesty, With Advice and
Consent foresaid. Discharges and strietly Prohibites the Subject
of this Kingdom to Meet and Assemble together in Arms, After
the Publication hereof, upon any Pretence Whatsover, daring the
Space foresaid, without Her Majesties special Command, or express
Licence had or obtained there to And Requires and Command;
all the Subjcts of this Kingdom, to Retire to their own Habi∣tations
and lawful Employments, Certifying such, as shall do
in the contrary, That they shall be lyable to the Pains of High
Treason conform to the Laws and Ails of Parliament wade
against Unlawful Convocations and Rising in Arms.</P>
<P>This was a most Effectual Step to Check the Riots and Tumults
of the People, for After this, no Man of any Consderation durst
show him self; And sindig the Government Resblved to punish
whoever should make any Attempt of that Nature, they began to
give over the0 Thought or taking Arns.</P>
<P>Thus the Afair without Doors seem' to attend the parliament of
the Parliament, and all we meet from Abroad, amounted to no
more
<PB N="75" REF="299"/>
more than Addresses without Number from the Towns and Coun∣treys,
and some from the Presbyteries, against the Union in the
Terms of the Articles, with Disputes about Amendments to the se∣veral
Articles, as they came before them: The particular Cases of
which will come of Course, in the Observations on the Minutes of
Parliament.—</P>
<P>Mean time it may be noted, the Parliament enter'd upon the De∣bate
ot the Articles, Stating the Duties, Settling the Equivalent
that was to be paid to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Considerarion of the <HI>English</HI>
Debts, Proportioning the Excise,&amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>This Affair of the <HI>English</HI> Debts has been such an Occasion of
Clamour in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that I cannot but think it very necessary to
give a State ot it in short, as it lay before the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Treaters in <HI>England,</HI> as has been noted in the Observations
on the Minutes of the Treaty in London, had been convinced of
the Necessity of having the Customs and Excises of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when
they came to an Union, run in the same Channel with the Excises
and Customs in <HI>England,</HI> and this, by Consequence, engaged them
in the same Appropriations and Incumberances, that the same Du∣ties
in <HI>England</HI> were lyable to.</P>
<P>This created an Objection, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Scotland</HI> was under no
Incumberance of Debt, at lest none that those Duties were appro∣priated
To; and therefore, to bring her into Taxes of any sort,
other than such as were to bear the Burthen of the War, was not
confident with the Equalities of Burthens, which were allowed to
be the only Foundation of an Union.</P>
<P>The Equity of this was not to be withstood, and therefore the
Etift Commiflkmers readily agreed, there was no Reafou 1 he Re∣venue
of <HI>Scotland</HI> should be applyed to the <HI>English</HI> Debt without
Conditions—; But as the Circumstauces of the Nations require∣ed
an Equality of Taxes, and those Tasxes in <HI>Scotland</HI> must run in
the Channel of the taxes of the same Kinds in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>English</HI>
mutt pay to <HI>Scotland</HI> an Equivalent in Money; This was settled
by the Treaty, as in the Minutes appears at large.</P>
<P>Now the Equivalent being determin'd, the Parliament was for a
long; while imployed in debating what Taxes 4whatcustoms and what
Excises should bees paid by <HI>Scotland</HI>—, It is needless to enter up∣on
the particular Reasonings on the several Heads as they were de∣bated
in the Parliament, since the Minutes of the Parliament will
particularly discuss those Points, but it may be needful to note a.
little the Reasons of all those Disputes.</P>
<P>I have often noted, there was a Party who were busy, not
so much in Arguing for Regulating, as Destroying the articles;
that Argued against the Union in general, not against the Articles
in particular; these having in vain strugled against the main Ar∣tieles
of the treaty, such is Union in as union in general, Suceession, com∣muatercationit
and first they would have it that <HI>Scotland</HI>
should
not pay any of the customs or Excises in Use <HI>England,</HI> but when
<PB N="76" REF="300"/>
convinced of the Injustice of those Pretences, they could no longer
object against an Equality of Taxes; Then they began new De∣bates
upon the Circumstances of the said customs and Excises, and
push'd at all sorts of Exemptions, Inequalities of Payments, Re∣stractions
and Latitudes they could imagine, if possible to bring on
some Amendments upon the Articles, which they knew would per∣plex
the Union in the <HI>Einglish</HI> Parliament, such were the Liberty of
Exporting Wooll, the Exemption from the Duties on Salt for ever
the Reducing their Ale to the Excise of Small Beer in <HI>England,</HI>
and the like; And this makes it appear, that I have not wronged
them, in saying, that their Design was at the Union in gene∣ral.</P>
<P>It would be too much to enter upon the Discourse here of the
several Objections against the Equivalent, the Taxes, the Excises, &amp;<HI>c.</HI>
and innumerable Cavils at the several Duties on Export or Im∣port—.
These things occupied the whole Town, and all the
People, as their several Fancies and Informers led them, spent the
time in Canvassing and Disputing the Articles of Commerce, Im∣port,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> what could be paid, and what not.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be wondred, that these Debates were Warm, for as
the prospect of Tumult began to abate, the People took the more
liberty in Speech, and the Government being very backward to
Punish the Exorbitances of the Tongue, at a Time when they were
Inviting all the People to Unite, all the Gall and ill Humour of the
Party vented it self at the Mouth. This filled the Country with
innumerable Raitry and Reproach, all Companies were divided;
nay, even Families, Relations, and the nearest in Affection, divided;
upon this Subject.</P>
<P>The Scruples of Religion also revived now, and a great many
finding the Treaty was like to go on, began to set up their Foun∣dations
for Opposition, and revive the Scruples of the Union in
terfeiring with the National Covenant, the Danger of the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the Suffrages of the <HI>English</HI> Bishops, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>All these things helped to raise Heats among the People, and some
went up to a strange height of Jealousie and Discontent, and what
<HI>they could do,</HI> they did; As for Tumults and Rebellions, that time
began to be over with them, but Parties and Feuds encreased every
Day: And so they went on till the Parliament went thro' the
whole Treaty, and how they behaved then, will follow to be spo∣ken
to in its Course.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION 1st.</HEAD>
<P>“It might be noticed here. That several Gentlemen take
the Oath of Parliament, who had not done the same before;
I observe it, because it was said, that some did so particularly
to Qualifi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves to be Serviceable in this Cause, to the
respetive Interests they Espoused, I do not say it was so, nor
do I care to distinguish Persons so much, as to put any Mark
upon Names from Common same, every one is to Judge of
that as they think fit.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="303"/>
“The Party against the Union finding the Articles, as they
were concluded at <HI>London,</HI> were concealed, or at least not
made publick, gave out in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissio∣ners
having had it in their Power to obtain must Advantage∣ous
Conditions from <HI>England,</HI> but having been brought basely
to submit to the Arbitrary Designs of some Leading Men im∣ployed
in the Treaty in <HI>England,</HI> they had been very supper∣ficial
in their Demands, and therefore durst not publish their
proceedings, till the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> met, and then
the whole Treaty would be rejected, which would be agreeable
to others of the Commissioners of both Nations: This
groundless Opinion being diffused, and believed by many of
their Party of best Sense, made them easie and unactive, till
too late they perceived the Queen, Her Ministers, and all
Persons concerned in Adjusting that Treaty, to be in earnest,
and then they turn'd the same Notion to another Use, <HI>viz.</HI>
To Calumniate and Reproach the Commissioners.</P>
<P>“The Printing the Articles also, which the Opposers
of the Union afterwards boasted of as their Act and
Deed, was introduced against their Design; For, at
the private Meetings of those against the Union, the
Question was, how to delay the Printing of the Articles,
or any thing else, whereby to gain Time, till the Parliament
of <HI>England</HI> should meet, which was then Prorogued to the
twenty third of <HI>October;</HI> So that both Parliaments sitting
together, they expected to confound the Measures for carry∣ing
on the Treaty by mutual Proposals, Doubts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this
Project of delaying the Printing of the Articles was prevented,
for the Articles being presented and read, after a long
Silence in the House, Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> rose up, and told
the Lord Chancellor, That he found himself obliged to pro∣pose
the Printing the Articles, which had been read in
the House, to the end the Curiosity and Judgment of all
sorts of People might be satisfied, and that the not Printing
might be no Argument, in time coining, for a Delay to the
Ratifying of the Treaty. Which Proposal was resumed by
the Lord Chancellor, and no Member opposing or seconding
it, he looked upon it as Accquiesced to, and Ordered the
Articles to be Printed.</P>
<P>“<HI>Nota,</HI> The Minutes of the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI>
and the Articles agreed on there, should have been insert∣ed
here, but they are already brought in at large,
and need not be repeated. The Speech of the Lard Com∣missioner
also, and the Lord Chancellor, together with the
Queens Letter, are Inserted in the Part immediately preceed∣ing
this, to which I refer; And therefore, and to avoid
Repetition, they are left out here, tho' they properly belong
to this Days Minute.</P>

<P>The Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> Protested against the Calling any Earlbefore

<P><HI>Alexander Abercrombie</HI> of <HI>Glassoch,</HI> Commissioner for the Shire of

<HI>Admit:</HI> (Reserving to Lady <HI>Mary Bruce,</HI> and her Husband

<P>“The Earls of <HI>Sutherland</HI> and <HI>Crawford,</HI> in the Process of this

<P>The Lord <HI>Oliphant</HI> Swore the Oath of Allegiance, Subscribed the

<P>Moved, That the Articles of Union, agreed on by the Commis∣sioners
Nominated on Behalf of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
be again Read; And also Moved, That the Minutes of the
Proceedings of the said Commissioners be likeways Read; And
after some Reasoning, It was agreed, That the said Articles of U∣nion
should be Read; Ane Ordered, That all Records relating
to former Treaties, betwixt the two Kingdoms, be laid on the
Table, and in the Intervals of Parliament they be to be seen in the
Laigh Parliament House, where some of my Lord Registers Ser∣vants
are to attend.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="305"/>
And the Articles of Union being accordingly again Read, It was
agreed, That the Parliament should proceed to the Consideration
of the said Articles of Union the next <HI>Sederunt.</HI></P>
<P>Adjourned till <HI>Tuesday</HI> next at 10 a Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION III.</HEAD>
<P>“Great Opposition was made in Parliament this Day a∣gainst
Reading the Articles—, and several Arguments
brought by the Gentlemen on that side for Delays—, a∣mong
which this was one, and this the first time it was start∣ed
in the House; <HI>viz.</HI> The Consulting Principals or Consti∣tuents,
and same Gentlemen went so far, as to acknowlege
the Power of a Member of Parliament was Limited by their
Constituents; and that the Parliament could nor lawfullly De∣bate,
much less Determine an Affair of such a Nature as this,
<HI>viz.</HI> Of Destroying the Constitution without, as afore∣said,
Consulting and Obtaining the Consent of their Con∣stituents.</P>
<P>It was Replyed that,</P>
<P>1. This was not a destroying the Constitution.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Parliament</HI> was particularly Called by Her Majesty
for this End; and the Work expressed in the <HI>Proclamation</HI>
for their Election, and that therefore they were particularly
Elected by their Constituents for this Work, and thereby Im∣powered
to Debate and Conclude it, without farther <HI>Powers.</HI></P>
<P>3. Others Argued the <HI>Positive,</HI> and Affirmed the <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI>
had full Power to Act on this Matter, tho' there had been
no such Expression in the Proclamation.</P>
<P>“The Debate was long, and warm enough, and began to
Inform us what was to be expected; but on the whole it was
carried to Read the Articles, by a great Majority: The other
being taken as an Attempt to gain Time.</P>
<P>“A Proposal was made this Day for a General Fast—,
which occasioned some Debates, but was Adjourned.</P>
<P>“And here it was very publickly observed, from what
Hands the Motion of a Fast came: Some maliciously enough,
tho' merrily, Noted, That the Motion of a Fast came first
from those, who were very rarely observ'd either to Fast or
Pray, and that now began to Talk so Religiously, that it
was taken for a meer Banter.</P>
<P>“On the other Hand it was observed, That the most Sober
and Religious Members, both of the Nobility and Gentry,
opposed this Motion in the House; But the Reason was
evident.</P>
<P>“The great Project just then carrying on in the Kingdom,
was to Amuse; the People, Possess them with Fears of some
Strange Thing then Transacting, and of Impending Dangers
dreadful to the Kingdom, and which they had no Remedy
<PB N="6" REF="306"/>
to prevent, but as in great Distress, to fly to their Prayers as
Mariners in a Storm—: This they thought would, of
Course, be made the more Terrible by the Ministers in gene∣ral,
exciting the People to extraordinary Humiliations,
which, <HI>whether ill design'd or no,</HI> might be ill enough Impro∣ved,
and the People thereby made the more Uneasy.</P>
<P>“Perhaps also they might hope for some Indiscretion and
undue Warmth in the Pulpit, especially from some Men,
which they were willing to think they could influence to so
much Weakness, but in this also they were disappointed.</P>
<P>For the same Reasons, those Gentlemen who were of the
most Religious Conversation, and known to be well Affected
to the Church, and to any thing that had but an Aspect of
sincere Piety, were nevertheless against this Fast, as Unsea∣sonable
and Dangerous, and as a thing they foresaw was de∣sign'd
particularly to make the People Uneasy with these Prof∣pects;
The Debate was urged warmly enough on both sides,
but at last was Adjourn'd; and so the designed Fast was put
off for the present, tho' it was afterwards introduced piece
meal, and all the use made of it that could be to raise the
Spirits of the People, if possible, to the Disorders aimed at, as
we shall see in the Sequel of this History.</P>

<HEAD>MINUTE IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tuesday 15. October 1706.</HEAD>
<P>Warrant Granted to the Barons and Freeholders of the Shire of
Fife, to meet on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the Twenty Ninth instant, to elect a Com∣missioner
in place of Sir <HI>Archibald Hope</HI> of <HI>Rankeillor</HI> deceast.</P>
<P>Moved, That according to the last Minutes, the Parliament
should now proceed to the Consideration of the Articles of the Uni∣on.</P>
<P>Moved, That the Members of Parliament may yet be allowed
Eight Days further to consider more deliberatly the Articles and
Minutes; and after some Reasoning, it was put to the Vote, <HI>Pro∣ceed
presently to the Consideration of the Articles of Union,</HI> Or, <HI>Con∣tinue
the Consideration thereof till the first</HI> Sederunt <HI>next Weak,</HI> and it
carried <HI>Proceed.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the first Article of Union was Read; as also the Minutes
of the Proceedings of the Commissioners for the Treaty, relative
thereto, and Her Majesties Commission to the Commissioners for the
Treaty on behalf of this Kingdom, were likeways Read; and
after some Reasoning and Discoursing thereupon, the further Con∣sideration
thereof was Delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament.</P>
<P>Adjourned till <HI>Thursday</HI> next at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="7" REF="307"/>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION IV.</HEAD>
<P>“Here, the Gentlemen who appeared against the Union,
finding they could not carry the Point, as Debated the last
Day, Moved for a Delay of but Eight Days; and several Ar∣guments
were offered, to obtain so short a Delay.</P>
<P>But in this; they lost several of those who Voted with
them before, and who seeing the Vote of Consulting Consti∣tuents
Rejected, could not be convinced of the Advantage of
eight days Delay; and this made it seem more particularly
a Design only to Delay.</P>
<P>“Whereupon the Question being put, it was carried by a
great Majority; And this was the first Tryal of the Strength of
the Parties, and the first encouraging Proof that the Union
would go on: The Majority on this Vote was sixty four,
but the Names having not yet been Ordered to be made pub∣lick,
it was not known who were on one side or the other.</P>
<P>“Before this Vote was put, it was also Debated, whether
this Reading of the Article, should be in order to proceed
upon them to a Vote. And here again the Gentlemen had
their Turn of Advantage, nor was there any great Oppositi∣on;
for those who were for the Union, were yet willing to
have it fully Debated, and all things for its better Explana∣tion
understood, and were content to have it as thorowly Ex∣amined
as they pleased, and therefore gave their Votes freely
for a general Reading.</P>
<P>“The other Gentlemen who were only pushing at Delays,
and striving to gain Time, thought they gain'd a great Point
in this, and therefore with all their Interest they push'd at a
general Reading only, which was presently agreed to, <HI>viz.
That the Articles should be Read and</HI> Discoursed of in this
Parliament, but that none of them should he Voted, till all was
Read over and Considered.</P>
<P>Upon the above Debate, and concluding only to Read and
Discourse, the first Article of the Treaty was Read publickly,
but the Reading of the Commissions and Minutes, taking up
a great deal of Time, there was not much Discourse in the
House at that time, for the great Affair now in Agitation,
was to stir up the People without Door?, and bring them ei∣ther
by Clamour, Tumult, or Tumultuous Addresses, to de∣clare
a general Dislike both of the Union in General, and of
the Articles in Particular; And at this time they began to
Threaten from without Doors.</P>
<P>“The Streets and Doors were exceedingly Throng'd this
Day in expectation of the Event, the People expecting igno∣rantly
to hear whether the first Article was Voted and Ap∣proved,
or Rejected; and when some Body came out and
<PB N="8" REF="308"/>
said Unwarrily the first Article was not Voted, it run thro'
the Town, that h was Rejected; And the Mob, who ap∣peared
now to be Managed by some Gentlemen, began
to Shout, and People apprehended the Union had been Voted
against in the General, but they were Discovered too soon
by this, and it was presently understood, that the Article was
only Discoursed of and the Discourse Adjourned too.</P>
<P>“The next day the Minutes being Printed, the Minds of the
People were a little Cool'd, when they saw the House went
On so deliberately, and that nothing was to be Voted, while
all the Articles were Read over and Considered.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MINUTE V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Thursday 17. October, 1706.</HEAD>
<P>Address of the Commission of the late General Assembly of the
Church of this Kingdom, for Establishing and Confirming the true
Protestant Religion, and Government of the Church, as by Law,
Established therein. Read; And thereupon the Parliament De∣clared,
That, before Concluding the Union, They would take the
said Address to their Consideration, and would do every thing Ne∣cessary
for Securing the true Protestant Religion and Church-Go∣vernment,
presently by Law Established in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Dispensation granted to Inferior Courts to sit, notwithstanding
of the sitting of the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Parliament proceeded to the further Consideratton of the
Articles of Union, and the second Article thereof was Read; As
also the Minutes of the Treaty relative thereto; and the Act of
the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> in the first Year of the Reign of Their
late Majesties King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act De∣claring
the Rights and Privileges of the Subjects, and Settling the Suc∣cession
of the Crown,</HI> were likeways Read, and were thereafter Rea∣soned
and Discoursed upon.</P>
<P>The Third Article Read.</P>
<P>And thereafter the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Ar∣ticles
were all severally Read, with the Minutes relative thereto,
and were all Reasoned and Discoursed upon.</P>
<P>Adjourned till <HI>Saturday</HI> next at ten a Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION V.</HEAD>
<P>“The Commission of the General Assembly having fate from
the <HI>9th</HI> Instant, had been ill several warm Debates about the
Matter, in what manner they should behave themselves
in this Juncture: Some Hot Gentlemen had given them Di∣sturbance
<PB N="9" REF="309"/>
enough about the Matter of the Fast, and with∣out
Doors it was Reported, they would Protest against the
Union.</P>
<P>But the Generality being Governed by more Temper and
Moderation than some People hoped for, all things went on
there peaceably, <HI>I mean,</HI> as to their publick Resolutions;
And the Address to the Parliament was conceived in as Mo∣derate
Terms as could be expected, and is at large Printed
in the <HI>Appendix, N. B.</HI> *</P>
<P>“The Answer to it was also satisfactory enough—, in
that they declared, they would go upon the Address, before
any thing was concluded; It was however warmly pressed
in the Parliament, That the said Address should be immediately
entered upon, before they went on upon the Union—; But
this, as another Advantage design'd for Delay, was check'd
and the Answer in the Minute agreed upon.</P>
<P>“Great Pains was taken also at this time, to make the
Commission of the Assembly uneasy at this Answer, as not
satisfactory; Jealousies were fomented, and Suggestions whil∣pered
about from one to another, as if the Parliament de∣sign'd
to postpone the Affairs of the Church to the las, and so
perhaps drop them at once: This obtained but too much,
and being put forward by warm and uneasy People, grew
higher and higher and help'd on the Inflammations which
unhappily follow'd.</P>
<P>“The subject of the Firs Article, tho' not Named in the Minutes
was also re-assumed in the Discourses of this Day, and several
Arguments against the Union it self, as an Incorporating Uni∣on,
were brought, in order to prove it Impracticable, Incon∣venient,
and Disadvantageous to <HI>Scotland;</HI> And therefore,
that they ought rather to proceed upon the Consideration of
the general, before they went on to the particular Articles.</P>
<P>“This however was only Discoursed, and the Reading the
several Articles having been already Approven, they pro∣ceded
to the Reading the rest of the Articles, as in the
Minutes.</P>
<P>“In the Reading the Second Article, the <HI>English</HI> Act of
Parliament for Limiting the Succession, &amp;c. was Discoursed
on, and much was said about the <HI>English</HI> Limitations; and
some People that had been of another Mind formerly, seem∣ed
to discover an Inclination of coming into the Succession
with Limitations, and began to enter into the Matter of Li∣mitations;
But this being remote to the Work was dropt
for the present, and we shall meet with it again in its place.</P>
<P>“The Third Article also relating to Uniting the Parlia∣ments
of both Kingdoms was Read, an I some took the Li∣berty
to Jes with it as a Chymerical Calculation, and that
they had no Power to Alter the Representative of the Nati∣on
that <HI>Scotland</HI> could not Content to be Govern'd by any
<PB N="10" REF="310"/>
other Representative, than they were now; And that, if
the Parliaments were to be made one, <HI>Scotland</HI> whole Par∣liament
ought to be joyned to the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, and
that <HI>Scotland</HI> ought no more to Abridge her Representative
than <HI>England,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>“But the Unreasonableness of this was urged from the Dis∣parity,
in Extent of the Country, Number oi People, and
Proportion of Taxes, of which hereafter.</P>
<P>“The Five Ensuing Articles being all upon Privileges of
Trade, Excises and Customs, the Discourses were very gene∣ral
on both sides, and those things seem'd referr'd to more
Debates afterwards. All that was said of those things now,
seem'd rather to tend, if possible, to perswade the People in
general, that the Union was Impracticable, that <HI>Scotland</HI>
could not come into the Taxes, and that the Equalities talk'd
of, would ruine their Trade and starve their Poor.</P>
<P>“Without Doors, strange Use was made of these Articles
of Taxes, and the People were made to believe, their Salt,
their Malt, their Beer, their Fish, would all be Loaded with
Insupporrable Taxes, and their whole Trade should be ruin'd,
their Houses plunder'd for Taxes, and their People starv'd;
And no Man that shall see, with what Frightful Apprehensi∣ons
the poor People were postest, will any more wonder,
they were so easily brought into Tumults and Disorders—.</P>
<P>“<HI>Nota,</HI> This Day there were strong Rumours about the
Town, of the Mob coming up to the Parliament, to demand,
That the Crown and Scepter of <HI>Scotland</HI> should not he given
up, and carryed away to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“This was the Effect, of some Popular Speeches let fall by
those Gentlemen who opposed the Treaty, and industriously
spread about the Town a Report, That the Sovereignty of
<HI>Scotland</HI> was to be Subjected to the <HI>English;</HI> And the poor∣er
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort that understood less, had the same Thing in other
Words, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> was Betray'd;
That it was to be carryed to <HI>England,</HI> and never to be seen
here more. Of which see at large in its place.</P>
<P>“The House, however, took no Notice of this yet, as being
a Rumour only, tho' the Members were not without Apprehen∣sions,
That it might rise to a greater Height; And that
they might come to be Insulted, even in the House, as indeed

<HEAD>MINUTE VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Saturday 19. October 1706.</HEAD>
<P>Minutes of the last Sederunt Read.</P>
<P>The Parliament proceeded to the further Consideration of the Ar∣ticles
of Union, and the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Thir∣teenth
and Fourteenth Articles were all severally Read, with the
Minutes of Treaty relating thereto, and were all Discoursed on.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth Article of Union was likeways twice Read, and
Discoursed and Reasoned on; as also, the Minutes relative there∣to:
And after some Reasoning thereon, there arose a Debate about
the Calculation of the Equivalent of Three Hundred Ninety Eight
Thousand Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings therein-mentioned
which was adjourned till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament.</P>
<P>Adjourned till <HI>Tuesday</HI> next at Ten a Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION VI.</HEAD>
<P>“The Calculations of the Ninth Article were a little Exa∣mined,
but appeared so Just, and the Equalities so well Stat∣ed,
That there was no Room to object; For the Cess being
but the same upon <HI>Scotland</HI> as before, there could nothing be
said, why they should not go into Measures for carrying on
any joynt Expence, which, in Time to come, the United
Body should see Cause to put the Whole to.</P>
<P>“And this was the first Visible Explication of the Doctrine
of Equalities, and a Proof that Equalities consided in Pro∣portions,
<HI>of which more hereafter:</HI> Some People, to serve the
Designs now on Foot, had made the Ignorant People be∣lieve,
That, by Equalities, would be uderstood a Numerical
Equality, and that <HI>Scotland</HI> should pay in every Thing just
as the <HI>English</HI> did—; This did therefore a little serve to
open the Eyes of Considering People and let them see,
that the Treaty had been founded upon something of Justice;
For, by this time, it had been Represented as a Strange many∣Headed
Monster, that had nothing but Mouths and Teeth,
and Unfathomable Gulphs to Devour and Destroy the
People.</P>
<P>The Five Articles between the Ninth and Fifteenth re∣quir'd
little Debate, since they consisted only of Negatives,
and Provision made for <HI>Scotland</HI> against payment of any of
the Duties then Levyed in <HI>England</HI> by the Stamp-Office Tax,
Glass-Window Tax, and the several Duties on Coals and
Malt, together with Exemption from any tit the Proportions
of Cess as above for the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Year—; Only, from these Ar¦ticles,
<PB N="12" REF="312"/>
some Gentlemen took Occasion to remind them of the
Necessary Care taken by the Treaters, to Exempt <HI>Scotland</HI> in all
Cases from such Burdens, as they found them unable to bear,
and which absolute Necessity did not oblige them to subject
her to, and in such Cases to receive Equivalents, for what
ever they were oblig'd to come into by the Necessity of
Trade.</P>
<P>“But the Ferment was now grown high, and these Dis∣courses
had little Signification, the People being Unhappily
Prepossess'st beyond the power of Convictions.</P>
<P>“The 14<HI>th</HI> Article occasioned long Discourses, both within
Doors and without, and a great many ill natur'd Things
were said on both sides, the Matter of an Equivalent had not
yet been Examined much into, and the Reason, Nature, and
Nccessity of it, had gone but a very little way into the Un∣derstandings,
even of the Gentlemen themselves. The Trea∣ters
also here met with some Indecencies, and the Reflections
made on them, had such an Effect in publick, as had they not
met with some Check, might have been personally Mischie∣vous
to them, as to the partacted Abroad see Fol. 28 <HI>of the next
precedent part.</HI> Within Doors they met with some very unkind
Reproaches, as if they had not made due Provisions for their
Countries Necessities, had contented to Intolerable and Un∣just
Burthens, and had Mock'd them with the Notion of an
Equivalent, which did not lessen the Burthens upon the Na∣tion
their payment being to be Levied where it could not be
paid; and then repaid again where it was not Levied.</P>
<P>“To make good these Charges, they pretended to make
Calculations upon the Proportions of the said Equivalent, and
some indeed brought in their own rough Draughts of Dis∣proportions,
whereupon it was Moved, That the House should
enter upon more exact Calculations, and Examine the matters
of Fact. Of which see the next Minute.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MINUTE VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tuesday 22. October 1706.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate anent the Calculation of the Equivalent of Three
Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings
mentioned in the Fifteenth Article of Union, resumed; and after
some time spent thereupon. It was agreed to Nominate a Committee
of Three Persons of each State to Proceed and Examine the Calcu∣lation
of the said Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Eighty
Five Pounds Ten Shillings, and to Report to the Parliament, and
the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament appointed for Nominating the said
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommittee.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="313"/>
Thereafter several Paragraphs of the said Fifteenth Article were
again Read, and further Reasoned and Discoursed on.</P>
<P>The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Articles were also Read, and the
Minutes relative thereto, and were Reasoned upon.</P>
<P>The Eighteenth Article and the Minutes relative thereto were
likeways Read, and after some Discourse and Reasoning thereon.
The further Consideration of the said Article was delayed till next
<HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament.</P>
<P>Adjournd till Wednesday 23 October 1706.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION VII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debate of the Equivalent grew higher this day than
before, and the Fifteenth Article was the Subject of a great
Deal of ill natur'd Discourse in the House; From without
there was a very Terrible Clamour, and the Humours of the
People being brought as it were to a pitch, but too much
appeared to Correspond with some thing visible within Doors.
Several very unkind Reflections were made upon the Theaters,
not upon their Judgments only, but upon their Integrity, as
if they had been less just to their Countrey, than consisted with
the Trust Reposed in them.</P>
<P>“The Gentlemen on the other hand defended them∣selves
as calmly as they could, and endeavour'd to
clear up the Objections made to the Justice of
their Proceedings, offered to Examine the Calculations,
and Answer any thing that could be objected;: But the House
grew too much out of Temper to talk, much of it then, and
the Prudence of the High Commissioner, in order to Calm
Things and keep them as Easy as possible, prevented its running
Higher at that time—. The former Proposal was Reassumed,
<HI>viz.</HI> To refer it to the Examination of a Committee; And the
House was Moved to Name the Committee.</P>
<P>“Upon this Motion, it was again Moved, That none of
the Treaters should be capable of being Named to the said
Committee—. This, tho' it look'd, as if the Committee
were to be a Jury upon the Treasers, to Examine their Con∣duct,
yet the Gentlemen unanimously agreed to; And the
Choosing a Committee was Approven, who went thorow the
Calculations, and gave in such exact Accounts of Things, as
abundantly cleared up the Reputation of the Commissioners.</P>
<P>“It was also Moved, that to Assist the said Committee, Two
very able Accomptants, or Arithmeticians should be found,
to Examine the Calculations; one of which was Dr. <HI>James
Gregory,</HI> Professor of the Mathematicks in the College of <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI>
The other was Dr. <HI>Thomas Bowar,</HI> Professor of the Ma∣thematicks
in the College of Aberdeen.</P>
<P>“The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Articles about the Coin,
and about Weights and Measures, occasioned little or no De∣bate.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="314"/>
“The Eighteenth Article had indeed some Discourse upon
if, as what should, or should not be Alterable by the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and some Gentlemen were for Establish∣ing
all the present Laws without Alteration; A thing no
Nation in the World practises, since Circumstances of Nations
Altering, may always make it Necessary to Alter, Amend, Re∣new,
or Repeal the Laws and Usages of a Nation.</P>
<P>And the Distinction in the Article it self, was such, as few
could object, viz. <HI>That no Alteration should be made in the
Laws, respecting private Rights, except for the evident Utility of
the Subject within</HI> Scotland. This therefore, seemed to Ex∣plain
the true Meaning of the Article in that Point; yet the
other part of the Article about the Laws of Publick Right,
Policy, and Civil Government, being made the same thro'
out the whole United Kingdom;, this occasioned long Dis∣courses,
and held the House so late, that they thought fit to
Adjourn it till the next <HI>Sederunt.</HI></P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>MINUTE VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Wednesday 23 October 1706.</HEAD>
<P>The Parliament conform to the Minute of the last <HI>Sederunt,</HI> Pro∣ceded
to Elect the Committee for Examination of the Calculation
of the Equivalent of Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand
Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings. And the Three Estates Sepa∣rated
to their usual Places, Returned and Reported their respective
Elections, and the List of the Committee is as follows; Of the No∣bility,
The Marquess of <HI>Montrose</HI> Lord President of the Privy Coun∣cil,
the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> and the Marquess of <HI>Tweeddale;</HI> Of the Commis∣sioners
for Shires, Sir <HI>Alexander Campbell</HI> of <HI>Cesnock, George Baillie</HI> of
<HI>Jerviswood</HI> and <HI>John Hadden</HI> of <HI>Glenagies;</HI> Of the Commissioners for
Burghs; <HI>Robert Inglis,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel <HI>John Areskine</HI> and <HI>Hugh
Montgomery,</HI> and the Committee was appointed to meet in the Inner∣Session
House the first Interval day of Parliament, at Ten of the
Clock in the Forenoon.</P>
<P>Thereafter the Eighteenth Article of Union was again Read, and
upon Reasoning thereon, It was Moved, That the <HI>Enlish</HI> Laws
concerning Regulation of Trade, Customs and such Excises, to
which this Kingdom by virtue of the Treaty, is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yable, be
Printed for Information. Moved likeways that it be Remitted to a
Committee to Consider the several Branches of Our Trade as to Ex∣port
and Import, with the <HI>English</HI> Laws and Book of Rates in Re∣lation
thereto, with the Customs and Excises thereof, for the Satis∣faction
of the Members of Parliament thereanent, and to cause Print
such of the Acts of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament concerning the same as
<PB N="15" REF="315"/>
they find expedient, or to Report to the Parliament; and after
some Debate on these Motions, The further Consideration thereof
was delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament.</P>
<P>Adjourned till <HI>Friday</HI> 25 October <HI>1706.</HI></P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>“This was the Fatal Day of the Tumult in the Streets, and
the House was no less warm within, proportionally speak∣ing,
than the Gentlemen were without, all which had its
Share in Agitating the publick Confusions: I am far from
saying, That the Arguments used within Doors, occasioned
the Rabbles, but the Improvement a Party without Doors
made of them, and the manner in which things now said
in the Parliament were Represented without, concurr'd to
encrease the Ferment of the Nation.</P>
<P>“The Discourses on the Eighteenth Article were now car∣ryed
on with great Warmth; Many long Speeches were
made this Day, too long to be set down here, but tending
all to this, That <HI>Scotland</HI> ought not to subject themselves to
Duties of any sort, before it should be known what such
Duties were; That no Laws of Customs or Excises
should take place, and that it could not be proper to allow the
several Laws of Excise or Customs in <HI>England,</HI> till it, was
first calculated and agreed, what Customs and Excises <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
was to pay—; Then the Discourses on the paying
Equalities of Taxes being re-assumed, some took Occasion to
make Reflections again on the Treaters, for subjecting their
Country to Taxes, which first they alledged they did not
understand, and secondly they were not able to pay.</P>
<P>“The Reproaches cast upon the Treaters, the ill Behaviour
of some Members, and the Indecencies shown in these Cases,
were so Universal, that even Her Majesties High Commissio∣ner
did not escape, but was very ill used, which neverthe∣less
His Grace with a great deal of Temper suffered,
without any Disorder, preserring the publick Peace to all
his private Resentments; And by this Prudence pre∣vented
those who desired to have things Exasperated, and
hoped to see the Resentment of the Government runup first,
that they might have something to pretend for the Irregula∣rities
which follow'd.</P>
<P>“It may also be observed here, That the Printing the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Laws, Books of Rates, Excises and Customs, which it
was very certain would not be understood here, and from
which a thousand false Suggestions would every day be raised,
whence few People could Answer was a Design calculated for
a great many Ends, which were to be Answer'd in the future
Proceedings, and of which we shall hear more hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="316"/>
“A Committee was Nominated also for this Work, and
thousands of Difficulties were continually raised in the Mouths
of the People, to Expose the Treaty, and Exasperate the
People, such as, That the Tax upon Salt was Intolerable,
and that it would Destroy the Fishery, and the Poor were
Represented to Subsist so much upon Salt, as if it had been
one of the greatest parts of their Food.</P>
<P>“The Excise on Beer, Ale, &amp;c. was Represented as Insup∣portable,
and great Pains were taken to prove, that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
paid 4<HI>sh. 9 d. per</HI> Barrel upon their Table Beer, and that
the <HI>Scots</HI> Small Ale must pay equal Excise to the <HI>English</HI> Strong
Beer; And this was publickly Printed in the Streets, on
purpose to E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rage the People.</P>
<P>“It was in vain to offer Calculations on these Heads—;
And tho' it was, by the Author of this Work, proved by di∣rest
and positive Demonstration, that the Excise of their Ale
could, in Proportion, pay no more than it did now, even
by the Calculation of the <HI>English</HI> Excises; And that the
Expence of Salt, in any House in the Kingdom, could not
rise to above 20 <HI>d. per</HI> Head <HI>per Annum,</HI> yet it was in vain;
all Calculations of this sort were ridiculed and exposed as false
and partial, and the Author maltreated in Print for his Essays
on those things, as an Enemy to the Country, and in order
to expose him to the Fury of the Rabble, which had particu∣larly
mark'd him out for Destruction, in the general Commo∣tions
which follow'd.</P>
<P>“But all these Calculations appeared afterward to be right,
as in their place will more particularly appear.</P>
<P>“However, the whole Debate of this Day could not bring
them over the Eighteenth Article, the farther Discourse of
which was, as per the Minute, adjourned, and what inter∣rupted
it further, you will see in the next Days Work.</P>
<P>“The Salt was an Argument People stuck very closs to, and
strove to make it Popular; For the Poor seemed to be con∣cerned
in it, and those that espoused it, whatever their Ends
were in espousing it, they always made the Relief and Ease
of the Poor the main Argument: This was Taking and En∣gaging
with the Common People, and as much Use was made
of it, as if the Salt had been a principal part of their Food,
and the Duty so great, that the Poor must have been starved,
if they had payed it—; The Debate, however, had this
Effect, that it brought the Parliament to enter into the
Consideration of Amendments and Exemptions, which they
particularly settled in this Affair, and which the Parliament
of <HI>England</HI> easily came into, as will appear in its place.</P>

<HEAD>MINUTE IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Friday 25. October 1706.</HEAD>
<P>The Lord high Chancellor Represented to the Parliament, That
he was directed by the Lords of Her Majesties Privy Council, to
Acquaint the Parliament, That upon occasion of a Rabble and Tu∣mult
that happened in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> upon <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night last, by
which several Members of Parliament were Threatned and Insulted;
The Privy Council had, for the Security of the Members of Parlia∣ment
and Peace of the Town, brought in a part of the Foot Guards
to the Town of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and had issued forth a Proclamation
against such Tumultary Meetings, in the Terms of several As of
Parliament.</P>
<P>Whereupon, and after some Reasoning, a Proposition was made
in thir Terms, That the Estates of Parliament being sensible of the
Care and Concern of the Lords of Privy Council, to Suppress the late
Tumult and Mob, and to secure the Safety and Quiet of the Parlia∣ment,
That therefore they should Return to their Lordships the
Thanks of the Parliament, and should Recommend to my Lord high
Commissioner and the Privy Council to continue their Care for the
Safety and Security of the Parliament, and the Peace and Quiet of
the Town; which being Read,</P>
<P><HI>After some Discourse thereupon, It was Moved, That the Procla∣mation
of Privy Council should be Read, and the samen being ac∣cordingly
Read, the Earl of</HI> Errol <HI>Lord high Constable gave in a
Protestation in the following Terms,</HI> That he for himself, and in
Name of such as should Adhere to his Protestation, protested, That the
continuing of standing Forces within the Town of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and keep∣ing
Guard with them in the Parliament Closs, and other places within
the Town the time of Parliament, (as at present is done) it contrary
to the Right of his Office as high Constable; by which he has the only
Privilege of Guarding the Parliament without Doors, as the Karl of
<HI>Marischal</HI> has within Doors, and is an Incroachment on the Rights and
Privileges of Parliament, and on the particular Rights and Privileges
of the Town of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and if any shall pass contrair to his
said Right, or the Right of the Earl <HI>Marischal,</HI> or Rights and Privi∣leges

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION IX.</HEAD>
<P>“This whole day was a meer Interruption to the Reading
of the Articles, and the House was employed wholly on the
Affair of the Rabbles.”</P>
<P>“The Lord Commissioner having found the encrease of the
Mob come to such a Degree, as that the whole City was in
Danger, and indeed the whole Constitution would otherwise
have been Exposed; His Grace ordered the Guards to enter
the City about One of the Clock in the Morning, to assist the
Magistrates, by which means the Tumult was Appeasd, and the
Rabble dispes'd; some of the Rioters had been seized and
secured, and the Souldiers kept Post in the City all that
Night, the ensuing Day and the Night, and part of this Day,
without being Relieved, tho the Weather was exceeding
Cold.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="319"/>
“The Council had the Day before, Ratified what the Lord
Commissioner had done, and it was not doubted bur the Par∣liament
would do the same; the absolute Necessity of such a
proceeding, being, as was thought, enough to satisfie any
Body who was not for having the Civil Authority subjected
to the Insolencies of the Rabble.</P>
<P>“But People were strangely surprized, when they saw this
strenuously opposed in the Parliament; and had it not been
carryed by a Majority in the House, the Consequences must
have terminated in a second Rabble, more Fatal and Furi∣ous
than the first.</P>
<P>“The Marquess of A—<HI>le</HI> was the first Man who made
Objection against it, and pleaded, That it was an Encroach∣ment
upon the Liberty of Parliament, and taking away their
freedom of Speech; That it was Awing the House with
Souldiers, and bringing upon them Arbitrary Government;
and several Speeches were made to this purpose, in which
one Noble Person said, He could perceive the Difference al∣ready
in the Votes of the House, and that the Influence of
the Souldiers had Altered the Matter.</P>
<P>“These were hard Sayings indeed, and it was thoughts hard
Point, that People should call the being subjected to an Un∣govern'd
Rabble, Liberty of Parliament, and the Clamours
of the Mob, Freedom of Speech; It was plain, if the
Guards were not brought up, the Members of Parliament
would be Aw'd, and the Treaters Massacred by the Mob;
and to place Guards to Suppress Tumults, and Restrain the
Head-strong Multitude, was very far from Awing the Parlia∣ment;
it being also apparent, that this Guard was intirely
Subordinate to the Commands of the Parliament, and were
placed to Maintain, not Infringe the Liberty of Speech they
spoke of; That no Man could be Influenc'd by Men set on∣ly
to keep the Peace, and disperse Rabbles, and in a Case
when it was apparent to all the World, the Necessity was
such, That, unless those Rabbles were suppress'd, the Par∣liament
could not sit at all, nor the Business they were
Assembled for be Debated.</P>
<P>“The Opposers, however, maintain'd the Dispute a long
time; but when they came to the Question, it was appa∣rent,
a great many of their Friends, in other Cases yet,
were so convinc'd of the Necessity of this, That they
Voted against them, and so the Actings of the Lord Com∣missioner,
and also of the Council, were Approved, and
the Thanks of the House Ordered, as in the Vote.</P>
<P>“The Protesters are Named in the Minute, as above; And
this, I think, was the first Protest made in Parliament, upon
the Affair of the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="320"/>
“This Debate, of Course, put off the further Consideration
of the Eighteenth Article of the Union, which was the
Work of the Day.</P>
<P>“There was great Struggling in the House, on Pretence of
the Infringing the Privileges of the City of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> But
the Magistrates having declared themselves satisfied in the
Necessity of the Case, and the Impossibility of Keeping the
Peace without this Method, that Debate was also couch'd in
the Protest as above, and every Body acquiesc'd; The
Guards continued in their Posts, and the respective Regi∣ments
Reliev'd one another with Beat of Drum, as is usual,
but the Effect was only Keeping the Peace; No Violence
was offered to the Parliament, neither were any Souldiers
plac'd at the Door to Awe the Members, much less was any
denyed Enterance, or any other Person Access to them, as
on other Occasions—; But the Parliament was perfectly
Free, Open and Uninterrupted, the Souldiers were a Guard
to them, but not a Guard against them, and it was not in
the Power of any Person to say, he received the least Affront
from them: Indeed the Souldiers appeared wholly Uncon∣cerned
in any part of the Affair, they only Executed the Office
of a Guard to preserve the Peace, and keep the Government
from being Insulted.</P>
<P>“And in this peaceable Behaviour of the Souldiery,
consisted a great deal of the Success of the Treaty, for this
took away all pretence from a party of Men, who aim'd at,
and sought for some such Irregularity to complain of, in or∣der
to have Protested against the Parliament, as under Re∣straint,
and so having a legal Objection against the Proceed∣ings
as not Acted in a Free Parliament.</P>
<P>“This was a Disappointment to a certain great Person, who
proposed a Protest against this very Thing, as an Act of Vio∣lence,
and so leaving the House as a Body, pretending they
were under the power of the Army; But the Souldiers being
so Ordered, as to behave themselves quietly, and only taking
Post as a Guard to the City, to preserve the publick Peace;
the Doors of Parliament being always free and Uninterrupted,
those People were Defeated; and even their own Friends,
whom they proposed it to, refused them, acknowledging
they could not sustain the Allegation.</P>
<P>“I think it is very necessary to be particular in this case, be∣cause
I know great Clamours were made, as well in <HI>England</HI> as
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it the Souldiers, who upon this extraordinary
Occasion, were brought into the City, and who did indeed

that the Members of Parliament may Consult these whom they Re∣present;
And after some Debate on these Motions, The follow∣ing
Petitions and Addresses were presented, <HI>viz.</HI> One by some of

whom the Members Represent, and of knowing the Sentiments of
the Nation, and the Procedure of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> was
let fall, and agreed, that the First Article of Union should be Read,
but that it should be intire, next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament, to Debate,
whether or not the first Article be Concluded, by Approving there∣of,
or not, Or, if the Parliament may not, before Concluding there∣of,
Begin with and Conclude any other of the Articles, and ac∣cordingly
the First Article was Read.</P>
<P>Adjourned till the Morrow at Ten a Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The great Question came now to be Determined—,
Whether they should go upon the Treaty, or no.</P>
<P>“Those that opposed if, would not directly Argue against
Reading the Articles at all, &amp; so at once Reject the Treaty; But
they began to start anew Scruple, <HI>viz.</HI> Why should it be put upon
the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to Determine first upon the Treaty?
Why should not <HI>England,</HI> where the Treaty had been Form∣ed,
and where their Parliament was now to Sit in a few Days;
Why should not they first Signify their Consent to the Treaty,
and then the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> might Consider, whether
they could joyn with them upon the Terms, YEA or NO?</P>
<P>“This occasioned great Disputes, and many Speeches were
made, endeavouring to shew the Reasonableness of having
this Matter first Deiermin'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“It was among other things offered as a sufficient Argu∣ment,
That, as it was the Queens Prerogative to Call
Parliaments, to Appoint and Limit their Sittings, and to pro∣pose
to them any Matters as the Subject of their Meeting,
which they should Consult about, not Exclusive of what
they should think fit to Debate themselves, Her Majesty had
Determined which Parliament should begin upon the Ar∣ticles,
by Appointing this Parliament for that End, and had
particularly Recommended this Matter to them, and that
therefore they ought to go about it.</P>
<P>“That the Priority was a Dispute of no Consequence at all,
and that they had all the Liberty in the World to Pass or
not Pass, Approve or not Approve of the Treaty now, as
they should have then; That, if there was any Difference,
the Honour was done to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in putting the Treaty
first into their Hands, as the Principal Persons, who were
supposed to have Objections to make, and that they might
<PB N="24" REF="324"/>
be made intirely easy, in every Thing that was Material
to their Satisfaction.</P>
<P>“Notwithstanding all this, they renewed the Debate, and
brought it to a Motion in the Parliament, as appears by the
Vote, in which they alto added the former Suggestion of
Consulting their Constituents; And some Members alledg∣ed,
they had express Directions from their Principals, and
the Countries they Represented, Restraining, and positively
Obliging them, not to banter upon the Treaty.</P>
<P>“This brought Things to a great Height, and some Mem∣bers,
<HI>as was said,</HI> began to Talk of Protecting, and Leaving
the Parliament, but they had more Wisdom than that came
to—; They indeed very earnestly press'd this Motion,
which was in short to Obtain a Delay, and that made them
fly from one Argument to another.</P>
<P>“Together with their Arguments, and to Second their Pro∣posal
of Consulting Principals, they brought in Addresses
from the several Places mentioned above, and vehemently
urged, That it appeared by them, that it was the Sense of
the People, that the whole Nation was against it, and that
they ought not to Poceed without their Assent.</P>
<P>“Here it was Noted, That the Address from <HI>Mid-Lothian</HI>
was Signed by not above Twelve of the Gentlemen, or there∣about,
tho' there were above Two Hundred Gentlemen in
that County; And that therefore it seemed the Argument,
of its being the Sense of the Nation, must be very ill Grounded.</P>
<P>“At length they dropt the Debate, and obtained the pre∣vious
Question, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Parliament should immediately
proceed to Reading the Articles.</P>
<P>“But then a new Project was set on Foot; and it was an odd
thing to see, that after a long Debate whether the Articles
should be Read <HI>at all</HI> or no, it occasioned another Question,
and no small Debate upon it, which End of them they should
begin at.</P>
<P>“When they had gotten over the Question as before,
for Reading, they fell out which Article they should Read
first the Party which had at first opposed Reading them all,
now struggled to begin in the middle of the Treaty, the Rea∣son
was, as they alt edged, they were for Examining the
Particulars before they Voted the General. The first Article con∣tain'd,
That from and after the first Day of <HI>May,</HI> the two
Kingdoms should be United, <HI>&amp;c. This they would have de∣layed;</HI>
and then followed the Conditions which they would
have be agreed first of all.</P>
<P>“Others a Hedged, that it would be needless to enter in∣to
the Particulars till it was agreed, whether they should he
UNITED or No; and therefore it was necessary to Examine
the first Article in its order, not only because it was the first,
but because it was most rational to Determine, whether there
<PB N="25" REF="325"/>
should be an Union or no, before they descended to the Par∣ticulars,
because, if all the Articles were agreed to, yet if it
should be so precarious as to state the Question afterwards,
whether there should be a Union or no, it might at once ren∣der
all their Labour Fruitless.</P>
<P>“Upon this Debate, they resolved, it was first necessary to
get over the main Article, Whether there should be a Union
or not, before they entred into the Merits of the Particulars,
or Examined the Conditions; and they only Read the Ar∣ticle
to finish the Debate, and prevent any more Difficulty.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Saturday 2. November 1706.</HEAD>
<P>The first Article of Union was again Read, and thereupon a
Motion was offered in thir Terms, That it be agreed to, in the first
place, To proceed to take the first Article of the Union to Conside∣ration,
with this Provision, That if the other Articles of Union be
not adjusted by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to, and Appro∣ving
of the First, shall be of no Effect; And that immediately after
the said first Article, the Parliament will proceed to an Act <HI>For
security of the Doctrine, Discipline, Worship and Government of the
Church, as now by Law Established within this Kingdom: A</HI> nd after
some Debate thereon, there was a state of a Vote offered, Approve
of the Motion, <HI>Yea</HI> or <HI>No.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon there was a Resolve offered in thir Terms, <HI>That be∣fore
this House proceed to Vote any of the Articles of the Treaty, they will
hear what Security be Commission of the Church is to offer for the Church
Government, and that before any Incorporating Union be voted; A</HI> nd
after some further Debate upon the said Motion and Resolve, a se∣cond
State a Vote was offered. That the Church Government be
taken into Consideration before the Articles of Treaty, <HI>Yes</HI> or No.</P>
<P>And after some Debate, Which of the Two should be the State of
the Vote, it was put to the Vote, Whether the First or Second should
be the State of the Vote, and it carried the First; Thereafter it was
put to the Vote, <HI>Approve</HI> of the Motion or <HI>Not,</HI> and it carried <HI>Ap∣prove.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the first Article of Union was again Read, and after
some Reasoning thereon, it being objected, That an Incorporating
Union of the two Kingdoms, was contrair to, and inconsistent
with the <HI>the Claim of Right;</HI> The <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> and the third Act
of the first Parliament of Her Majesty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> Entituled, <HI>Act
for approving the turning the Meeting of the Estates into a Parliament,</HI>
and the Letter of the Meeting of the Estates to King <HI>William</HI> the
twenty fourth of <HI>April</HI> One thousand six hundred eighty nine were
all Read.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="326"/>
And and Address by the Barons, Freeholders, Heretors and other
Gentlemen in the Shire of <HI>Forfar</HI> Subscribers of the same, against al∣lowing
of an Incorporating Union with <HI>England,</HI> being given in,
was also Read.</P>
<P>And after long Reasoning and Debate on the said first Article of
Union, and Objection, it was of Consent agreed, That the same
should be delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament.</P>
<P>Adhourn'd till <HI>Monday</HI> next at Ten a Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIV.</HEAD>
<P>“The first Article was now Read, and all the Opposition
hitherto made, had been over. But two plausible Things re∣main'd;
one was, To Debate whether it should be so settled
that it all the Articles were not Concluded, none of them
which were Considered, should be of any Force; this was so
plausible, no Body could withstand it.</P>
<P>“Then they Objected in the Name of the Church, on the
Occasion brought before them formerly, <HI>viz.</HI> The Act of Se∣curity.
Unhappy was the Conditional this time of the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> if what seem'd to appear, had been her real Case,
<HI>viz.</HI> To have her greatest Enemies be her best Solicitors, as if
she had been so desperate, that even those that formerly Assist∣ed
to pull her down, were the only seeming Advocates for her
present Establishment.</P>
<P>“Or else surely Her Case was very happy, on the other hand,
that Her Establishment was so visibly necessary at this time,
that even Her apparent Enemies were careful to support Her.</P>
<P>“I shall enter no further into the Mystery of it here, the Parlia∣ment
had Voted to consider the Address of the Commission,
before any thing was Concluded, and whether that word,
<HI>Concluded,</HI> was to signifie before they Voted any Article, or
before the whole Union was Concluded, was now Immateri∣al;
and tho' it was expresly said in the Vote of <HI>October</HI> 17,
That it should he before the Union was Concluded, yet it was
Moved now, and the Parliament was so willing to do every
thing for she Satisfaction of the Nation, that they Resolved
to go upon it immediately after the pairing the first Article.</P>
<P>“The Party that still Opposed, were for going on the Affair
of the: Church, before any of the Articles were Concluded on,
alledging, That if the Security of the Church could not be
agreed on, the Union could not entered upon; but it was
returned to that, That just on the contrary, it was necessary
first to Vote the General, Whether there should be a Union or
in the firs Terms of the Treaty, which General was included
in the first Article, and it was casie to be seen, that if that Ar∣ticle
was Voted against, the Union was Rejected; and if the
Union was Rejected, there was then no need for Discoursing
on the Act of Security for the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="327"/>
“This was too strong a way of Reasoning to be Resisted,
and therefore when it came to the Question, it past, as <HI>per</HI> the
Minute.</P>
<P>“That it be agreed to, in the first place, To proceed to
take the first Article of Union to Consideration, with this
Provision, That if the other Articles of Union be not ad∣justed
by the Parliament, then the Agreeing, to. Mud Appro∣ving
of the First, shall be of no Effect; And that imme∣diately
after the said first Article, the Parliament will pro∣ceed
to an Act for Security of the Doctrine, Discipline, Wor∣ship
and Government of the Church, as now by Law Established
within this Kingdom.</P>
<P>“And now the first Article came upon the Stage, and the
first Brush it met with was, That it was against the Claim
of Right, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>“This was a Surprizing Blow indeed, and made the House
immediately Call for the Claim of Right, but that which
was Remarkable upon Reading the Claim of Right was, it
became necessary to Read the Letter of the Convention at
that time sent to King <HI>William,</HI> in which, the Estates then
met, humbly desired His Majesty, to set on Foot an Union
in the very Sense and Meaning of this Incorporation of the
Kingdoms, as the only Happiness the Kingdom desired.</P>
<P>“We are most sensible of Your Majesties Kindness, and
Fatherly Care to both Your Kingdoms, in promoving their
Union, which we hope hath been Reserved to be Accomplish∣ed
by You; That as both Kingdoms are United in one Head
and Soveraign, so they may become one Body Politick, one
Nation, to be Represented in one Parliament. And to te∣stifie
our Readiness to Comply with Your Majesty in that Mat∣ter;
We have Nominated Commissioners to Treat the Terms
of an Entire and Perpetual Union betwixt the Two King∣doms,
with Reservation to us of our Church Government, as
it shall be Established at the Time of the Union. These
Commissioners do wait Your Majesties Approbation and Call,
That they may Meet and Treat with the Commissioners to
be Appointed for <HI>England,</HI> at what Time and Place Your
Majesty shall Appoint. And if any Difficulty shall arise in
The Treaty, We do, upon our Part, Refer the Determination
thereof to Your Majesty. And we do Assure our selves, from
Your Majesties Prudence and Goodness, of a Happy Conclu∣sion
to that Important Affair, so as the same may be Agreed
to, and Ratified by Your Majesty in Your first Parliament.</P>
<P>“This indeed occasioned a long Debate and much Warmth
on both sides, which held the House very late; And after
Reading all the Papers, the Inconsistency of the Union with
the Claim of Right was thorowly Examin'd, where it could
not but be very remarkable to observe some Gentlemen giv∣ing
a Sanction to the Claim of Right, who never before ac∣knowledg'd
<PB N="28" REF="328"/>
knowleg'd it, owning it now as a Sacred Foundation, in or∣der
to oppose it to the Scheme of Union now drawn; which
being of more Fatal Consequence to their Real Design, as
well as Party, they were brought to the Necessity of Closing
with the first to Confront the last, so Playing one against
another, Recognizing the Revolution as the lesser Evil to
Repulse the Union, which they saw plainly Aim'd at the
Foundation, Struck at the Root, and must for ever Foreclose
<HI>Jacobitism</HI> and <HI>Prelacy,</HI> the two Columes which supported
their Cause—. The Reasonings here in the House began
with much Calmness; Immediately after Reading the Ar∣ticle,
Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> took the Opportunity to say,
That, having had the Honour to be one of the Commissio∣ners
for the Treaty, he thought it his Duty to give some Re∣sons,
which mov'd him to Approve that Article at <HI>Londen;</HI>
That he was perswaded there were several Members so Pre∣judiced
against all the Articles, that he could not hope from
them a Favourable Audience. And that what he had to say
to the present Subject of Debate, had been thought upon
when he Signed the Treaty; therefore he would presume to
make Use of his Papers, hoping, tho' his Reasons could not
convince any Member, yet they might serve to Vindicate his
Conduct to Posterity. Then he proceeded, and the Second
of <HI>November</HI> 1706, made the following Speech.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord Chancellor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“THis Honourable House has heard the several <HI>Articles of the
Treaty of Union</HI> twice Read, has spent a considerable time
in Discoursing to each of them, and after much Debate is
come to Examine and Determine upon the First: Notwithstand∣ing
all the Arguments offered against it, I cannot find the least Mo∣tive
for Altering the Opinion I had at Signing this Article,
having had the Honour to be one of the Commissioners Appointed
by Her Majesty for that End; but that I may give all Satisfaction
to every Member, I shall humbly offer in a plain manner my
Thoughts in relation to it.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> This Article is the Foundation of the whole Treaty,
and the Approving or Rejecting of it must Determine Union or no
Union betwixt both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>“How far the Approving this Article conduces to our Happiness,
appears evidently, by considering the three different Ways propo∣sed
for Retriving the Languishing Condition of this Nation;
which are, That we continue under the same Sovereign with
<HI>England,</HI> with Limitations on his Prerogative as King of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
That the two Kingdoms be Incorporated into one, or
that they be entirely separated.</P>
<P>“Thai the Union of Crowns with Limitations on the Successoris
not sufficient to Rectifie the bad State of this Nation, appears from
these Positions founded on Reason and Experience.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="329"/>
“Two Kingdoms subject to one Sovereign, having different Inte∣rests,
the nearer these are one to another, the greater Jealousie
and Emulation will be betwixt 'em.</P>
<P>“Every Monarch, having two or more Kingdoms, will be obliged
to prefer the Counsel and Interest of the Stronger to that of the
Weaker: And the greater Disparity of Power and Riches there is
betwixt these Kingdoms, the greater influence the more powerful
Nation will have on the Sovereign. Notwithstanding these Positi∣ons,
I shall suppose the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> is Vested with the
Power of making Peace and War, of Rewarding and Punishing
Persons of all Ranks, of Levying Troops, and of the <HI>Negative</HI> it
self.</P>
<P>“I cou'd show the Inconveniencies that must attend such a State
of Government, in Disposal of Places and Managing Publick
Affairs; I cou'd likewise show the Improbability of Attaining
such Conditions, or keeping 'em if attained; but laying aside
such Considerations, my humble Opinion is, That we cannot reap
any Benefit from these Conditions of Government, without the
Assistance of <HI>England:</HI> And the People thereof will never be
convinced to promote the Interest of <HI>Scotland,</HI> 'till both King∣doms
are Incorporated into One: So that I conceive such a State
of Limitations to be no better for <HI>Scotland,</HI> than if it were intire∣ly
separated from <HI>England,</HI> in which State there's little Appearance
of procuring any Remedy to our present Circumstances, which
appears from these uncontraverted Positions.</P>
<P>“The people and Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> must be Richer or
Poorer, as they have Plenty or Scarcity of Money, the common
Measure of Trade.</P>
<P>“No Money or Things of Value can be purchased in the Course
of Commerce: but where there's a Force to protect it.</P>
<P>“This Nation is behind all other Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> for many
year, with respect to the Effects of an extended Trade.</P>
<P>“This Nation being Poor, and without Force to protect it's
Commerce, cannot reap great Advantages by it, till it partake of
the Trade and Protection of some powerful Neighbour Nation,
that can Communicate both these.</P>
<P>“To Illustrate this last Position, I shall give a short View of
the State of Commerce we must needs be in, with respect to our
Neighbour Nations, supposing an entire Separation from <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>“I he ordinary Mean, whereby we can flourish in Wealth, is
That Ballance which arises from the Exchange of our Natural or
Artificial Product with other Places: But we have no Valuable
Branch of Export, which does not Interfere with the like Com∣modity,
in some more powerful Neighbour Nation, who's Inte∣rest
it is to Suppress or Discourage our Commodity, for Raising the
Value of its own; so that there's no Demonstrable Security for
the Vent and Encouragement of any Branch of our Export.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="330"/>
“Can it be expected, That <HI>Holland</HI> will suffer us to Improve our
Fishery, which is to them a Nursery for Seamen, a Livelyhood
to many Families, and an immense Treasure to the Publick?</P>
<P>“If we Traffick with <HI>England;</HI> our Linnen-Cloth, Cattle, and
Coals will be Discouraged, at least, after the same manner that we
discourage Export from thence. If we Traffick with <HI>Muscovy,
Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy,</HI>
the Sale of our Commodities will be of small Value in these
Places; seing the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>English,</HI> by their Increase of Trade
are capable to serve them with most of the like Goods, cheaper
and better than we.</P>
<P>“Let us look to any other Part of the World, for Vent to our
Product, and we'll find other Nations have prevented us.</P>
<P>“If we attempt the <HI>East India</HI> -Trade, that is already Enhansed
by the <HI>Dutch, English, French, Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Portuguese,</HI> from
whom we must expect Opposition, they themselves Opposing one
another daily; and we of no Force to Debate the same, with
the most Inconsiderable of them.</P>
<P>“The Trade of <HI>Africa</HI> is, for the most part, of small Value; and
every Province of <HI>America</HI> is claimed as Property, by some
powerful <HI>European</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>“It it be said, That <HI>Scotland</HI> may make Alliance with one of its
Neighbour Nations for Protection; that Alliance must be with
<HI>Holland, England</HI> or <HI>France:</HI> Other Countries being so Remote
or Poor, that their Friendships can be of little Use to us.</P>
<P>“With <HI>Holland,</HI> we can have no Advantageous Alliance, because
its chief Branch of Trade is the same with ours; with the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
we can expect no profitable Friendship, for they being our
near Neighbours, will be Jealous of our Increase in Power; and
from <HI>France,</HI> few Advantages can be reap'd, till the old Offensive and
Defensive <HI>League</HI> be revived betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> which
wou'd give Umbrage to the <HI>English,</HI> and occasion a War betwixt
them and us. And allowing the <HI>Scots,</HI> in such a Juncture, with
the Assistance of <HI>France,</HI> to Conquer <HI>England; Scotland,</HI> by that
Conquest, cou'd not hope to better its present State; for 'tis more
than probable, the Conquerour wou'd make his Residence in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
as formerly the Northern People used to do in their Southern
Expeditions.</P>
<P>“From these Considerations I conceive, That this Nation, by an
entire Separation from <HI>England,</HI> cannot extend it's Trade, so as to
raise its Power in Proportion to other Trafficking Nations in <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI>
but that hereby we may be in Danger of returning to that
<HI>Gothick</HI> Constitution of Government, wherein our Forefathers
were, which was frequently attended with Feuds, Murders, De∣predations
and Rebellions.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> I'm sorry, That, in place of Things, we Amuse our¦selves
with Words; for my part, I comprehend no durable Uni∣on
betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> but that expressed in this Ar∣ticle
<PB N="31" REF="331"/>
by <HI>One Kingdom,</HI> that is to say, One People, One Civil Go∣vernment
and One Interest.</P>
<P>“'Tis true, the Words, <HI>Federal Union,</HI> are become very Fashion∣able,
and may be handsomely fitted to delude unthinking People;
But if any Member of this House will give himself the Trouble, to
examine what Conditions or Articles are understood by these words,
and reduce them into any kind of Federal Compacts, whereby distinct
Nations have been United: I'll presume to say, These will be found
Impracticable, or of very little Use to us.</P>
<P>“But to put that Matter in a clear Light, these <HI>Queries</HI> ought to
be duly Examined, Whether a Federal Union be Practicable be∣twixt
two Nations accustomed to a Monarchical Government? Whe∣ther
there can be any sure Guaranty projected for the Observance
of the Articles of a Federal Compact, stipulated betwixt two
Nations; whereof the one is much Superior to the other in Riches,
Numbers of People, and an extended Commerce? Whether the Ad∣vantages
of a Federal Union do Ballance its Disadvantages? Whe∣ther
the <HI>English</HI> will accept a Federal Union, supposing it to be for
the true Interest of both Nations? Whether any Federal Compact
betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> is sufficient to secure the Peace of
this Island, or Fortify it against the Intrigues and Invasions of its
Foreign Enemies? And whether <HI>England</HI> in Prudence, ought to
Communicate its Trade and Protection to this Nation, till both
Kingdoms are Incorporated in one?</P>
<P>“To clear this last <HI>Querie,</HI> I shall offer a Remark from History.</P>
<P>“Of two Independent and distinct Kingdoms United by a Federal
Compact under one Sovereign, the Weaker to preserve its Interest,
has some times separated from the Stronger, unless prevented by
open Force, or secret Influence on its Government.</P>
<P>“<HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> were subject to the same Sovereign, <HI>Philip</HI> II.
And notwithstanding the <HI>Portuguese</HI> got most Advantagious Conditi∣ons
from <HI>Spain,</HI> the no sooner found a favourable Opportunity in
the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> IV. than they revolted from their Allegiance,
and Elected the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> for their King.</P>
<P>“<HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> were United by a Federal Compact under
one Monarch, but the <HI>Swedes</HI> judging a Separation more for their
Interest, broke off, and chose <HI>Gustavus</HI> the I. for their King.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> I should now consider an Incorporating Union, as it
is expressed in this Article by <HI>One Kingdom;</HI> but that I may not
take up the time of the House, I shall only give one Historical Re∣mark
with Relation to if.</P>
<P>“Two or more distinct Kingdoms or States, by incorporating in∣to
one Kingdom, have continued under the same Sovereign, en∣joying
equally the Protection of his Government, and every part
of the Body Politick, tho never so far remov'd from the Seat of
Government, has Flourished in Wealth in proportion to the Value
of it's Natural Product, or the Industry of its Inhabitants. To prove
this Remark there are many Examples.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="332"/>
“<HI>Spain</HI> was formerly divided into several Kingdoms, ten where∣of
are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>France</HI> was formerly divided into 12 States, which are Incorpo∣rated
into the one Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>“<HI>England</HI> was formerly divided into seven Kingdoms, which are
Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <HI>England; Scotland</HI> it self
was formerly divided into two Kingdoms, which at present are
Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“I cou'd give some Account of the particular Advantages we'll
obtain by an Incorporating Union with <HI>England,</HI> but there will
be occasions to Discourse of these, as the other Articles fall under
the Consideration of this Parliament. In general, I may affert,
That by this Union, we'll have Access to all the Advantages in
Commerce, the <HI>English</HI> enjoy; we'll be capable, by a good Go∣vernment,
to improve our National Product, for the benefit of the
whole Island; and we'll have our Liberty, Property and Religion,
secured under the Protection of one Sovereign, and one Parliament
of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>“Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> If Limitations on the Successor can be of
little or no Use to us; if an entire Separation from <HI>England</HI> brings
no Advantage to this Nation: and if all Federal Compacts, as we
are stated, have insuperable Difficulties, which in some measure I
have cleared, there is but one of two left to our Choise, <HI>to wit,</HI>
That both Kingdoms be United into one, or that we continue un∣der
the same Sovereign with <HI>England</HI> as we have done these 100
years past. This last I conceive to be a very ill State, for by it (if
Experience be convincing) we cannot expect any of the Advantages
of an Incorporating Union; but on the contrair, Our Sovereignty
and Independency will be eclipsed, the number of our Nobility
will Encrease, Our Commons will be Oppressed, Our Parliaments
will be influenced by <HI>England,</HI> the Execution of our Laws will be
neglected; Our Peace will be interrupted by Factions for Places
and Pensions; Luxury together with Poverty (tho' strange) will
invade us; Numbers of <HI>Scots</HI> will withdraw themselves to Foreign
Countries; and all the other Effects of Bad Government must necessa∣rily
attend us.</P>
<P>“Let us therefore, <HI>My Lord,</HI> after all these Considerations ap∣prove
this Article: and when the whole Treaty shall be duly Exa∣mined
and Ratified, I'm hopeful, this Parliament will return their
most Dutiful Acknowledgments to Her Majesty, for Her Royal En∣deavours
in promoting a Lasting Union betwixt both Nations.</P>
<P>Next spoke the Lord <HI>Beilhaven,</HI> but without answering what
had been said by M. <HI>Seton,</HI> he made a long premeditate Speech,
the Nature of which will be best understood by Reading it at
length, which being so much talk'd of in the World, I have
also inferred here, tho' I shall not trouble the Reader with
many more Speeches in this whole History.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord Chancellor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“WHEN I consider this Affair of an UNION betwixt the Two
Nations, as it is express'd in the several <HI>Articles</HI> thereof,
and now the Subject of our Deliberation at this time; I find
my Mind crowded with variety of very Melancholy Thoughts, and
I think it my Duty to disburden my self of some of them, by lay∣ing
them before, and exposing them to the serious Consideration
of this Honourable House.</P>
<P>“I think, I see <HI>a Free and Independent Kingdom</HI> delivering up
That, which all the World hath been fighting for, since the days
of <HI>Nimrod;</HI> yea, that for which most of all the Empires, King∣doms,
States, Principalities and Dukedoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> are at this
very time engaged in the most Bloody and Cruel Wars that ever
were, <HI>to wit,</HI> A Power to Manage their own Affairs by themselves,
without the Assistance and Counsel of any other.</P>
<P>“I think, I see <HI>a National Church,</HI> founded upon a Rock, secured
by a <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> hedged and fenced about by the strictest and
pointedest Legal Sanction that Sovereignty could contrive, volun∣tarily
descending into a Plain, upon an equal level with <HI>Jews,
Papists, Socinians, Arminians, Anabaptists,</HI> and Other Sectaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>“I think I see <HI>the Noble and Honourable Peerage of Scotland,</HI> whose
Valiant Predecessors led Armies against their Enemies upon their
own proper Charges and Expenses, now diverted of their Followers
and Vassalages, and put upon such an Equal Foot with their Vas∣sals,
that I think I see a petty <HI>English</HI> Excise-man receive more
Homage and Respect, than what was paid formerly to their
<HI>quondam Maccallanmores.</HI></P>
<P>“I think I see the present Peers of Scotland, whose Noble Ancestors
conquered Provinces, over-run Countries, reduc'd and subjected
Towns and fortify'd Places, exacted Tribute through the greatest
part of <HI>England,</HI> now walking in the Court of Requests like so many
<HI>English</HI> Attornies, laying aside their Walking Swords when in Com∣pany
with the <HI>English</HI> Peers, left their Self-defence should be found
Murder.</P>
<P>“I think I see <HI>the Honourable Estate of Barons,</HI> the bold Asserters
of the Nation's Rights and Liberties in the worst of Times, now
setting a Watch upon their Lips and a Guard upon their Tongues,
left they be found guilty of <HI>Scandalum Magnatum.</HI></P>
<P>“I think I see <HI>the Royal State of Burrows</HI> walking their desolate
Streets, hanging down their Heads under Disappointments; wormed
out of all the Branches of their old Trade, uncertain what hand
to turn to, necessitate to become Prentices to their unkind Neigh∣bours;
and yet after all finding their Trade so fortified by Com∣panies,
and secured by Prescriptions, that they despair of any
success therein.</P>
<P>“I think I <HI>see our Learned Judges</HI> laying aside their Practiques
and Decisions, studying the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> gravelled
with Certioraries, <HI>Nisi prius's,</HI> Writs of Error, Verdicts indovar,
<PB N="34" REF="334"/>
<HI>Ejectione firmoe,</HI> Injunctions, Demurrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and frighted with Ap∣peals
and Avocations, because of the new Regulations and Recti∣fications
they may meet with.</P>
<P>“I think I see <HI>the Valiant and Gallant Soldiery</HI> either sent to learn
the Plantation Trade Abroad; or at Home Petitioning, for a small
Subsistance as the Reward of their honourable Exploits, while
their old Gores are broken, the common Soldiers left to Beg, and
the youngest <HI>English</HI> Corps kept standing.</P>
<P>“I think I see <HI>the Honest Industrious Tradesman</HI> loaded with new
Taxes, and Impositions, disappointed of the Equivalents, drink∣ing
Water in place of Ale, eating his sat-less Pottage, Petitioning
for Encouragement to his Manufacturies, and Answered by counter
Petitions.</P>
<P>“In short, I think I see <HI>the Laborious Plew-man,</HI> with his Corns
spoiling upon his Hands, for want of Sale, Cursing the day of his
Birth, dreading the Expense of his Burial, and uncertain whether
to Marry or do worse.</P>
<P>“I think I see the Incureable Difficulties of the <HI>Landedmen,</HI> fet∣tered
under the Golden Chain of Equivalents, their pretty Daugh∣ters
Petitioning for want of Husbands, and their Sons for want
of Imployments.</P>
<P>“I think I see our Mariners, delivering up their Ships to their
<HI>Dutch</HI> Partners; and what through Presses and Necessity, earning
their Bread as Underlings in the Royal <HI>English</HI> Navy.</P>
<P>“But above all, <HI>My Lord,</HI> I think I see <HI>our Ancient Mother</HI>
CALEDONIA, like <HI>Caesar</HI> sitting in the midst of our Senate,
Rufully looking round about her, Covering her self with her
Royal Garment, attending the Fatal Blow, and breathing out her
last with a <HI>Et tu quoque mi fili.</HI></P>
<P>“Are not these, <HI>My Lord,</HI> very afflicting Thoughts? And yet
they are but the least part Suggested to me by these Dishonourable
Articles; should not the Consideration of these things vivifie these
<HI>dry Bones</HI> of ours? Should not the Memory of our Noble Prede∣cessors
<HI>Valour and Constancie,</HI> rouse up our drouping Spirits? Are
our Noble Predecessors Souls got so far into the <HI>English Cabbage∣Stock
and Colliflowers,</HI> that we should shew the least Inclination
that way? Are our Eyes so Blinded? Are our Ears so Deafned?
Are our Hearts so Hardned? Are our Tongues so Faltered? Are
our Hands so Fettered, that in this our day, I say, <HI>My Lord, That
in this our day, that we should not mind the things, that concern the
very Being and Well-being of our Ancient Kingdom, before the day be
hid from our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>“<HI>No,</HI> My Lord, <HI>GOD</HI> forbid, Man's Extremity is <HI>GOD'S</HI> Oppor∣tunity:
He is a present Help in time of need, and a Deliverer, and
that right early. <HI>Some unforeseen Providence will fall out, that
may cast the Balance; some</HI> Joseph <HI>or other will say,</HI> Why do ye
strive together, since yon are Brethren? <HI>None can Destroy</HI> Scotland,
<HI>save</HI> Scotland's <HI>self; hold your Hands from the Pen, you are Se∣cure.
Some</HI> Judah <HI>or other will say,</HI> Let not our hands be upon
<PB N="35" REF="335"/>
the Lad, he is our Brother. <HI>There will be a</HI> JEHOVAH-JIREH
<HI>and</HI> some Ram will be caught in the Thicket, <HI>when the bloody Knife
is at our Mothers Throat; Let us up then,</HI> My Lord, <HI>and let our
Noble Patriots behave themselves like Men, and we know not
how son, a Blessing may come.</HI></P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> I wish from my Heart, that this my Vision prove not
as true, as my Reasons for it are probable; design not at this time
to enter into the merits of any one particular Article, I intend
this Discourse, as an Introduction to what I may afterwards say
upon the whole Debate, as it falls in before this Honourable
House; and therefore, in the further Prosecution of what I have
to say, I shall insist upon some few particulars, very necessary to
be understood before we enter unto the Detail of so Important a
Matter.</P>
<P>“I shall therefore in the <HI>first place,</HI> Endeavour to Encourage a
free and full Deliberation, without Animosities and Hears; in the
<HI>next place,</HI> I shall Endeavour to make an Enquiry into the Nature
and Source of the Unnatural and Dangerous Divisions that are
now on Foot within this Isle, with some Motives shewing,
that it is our Interest to lay them aside, at this time.
Then I shall Enquire into the Reasons which have induced the
two Nations to enter into a Treaty of Union at this time, with
some Considerations and Meditations, with Relation to the Beha∣viour
of the Lords Commissioners of the two Kingdoms, in the
Management of this Great Concern. And lafrly, I shall propose
a Method, by which we shall most distinctly, and without Confu∣fusion,
go through the several Articles of this Treaty, without un∣necessary
Repetitions or Loss of Time. And all this with all De∣ference,
and under the Correction of this Honourable House.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> The greatest Honour that was done unto
<HI>a Roman,</HI> was to allow him the Glory of a Triumph; the great∣est
and most dishonourable Punishment was that of <HI>Paricide:</HI> He
that was Guilty of <HI>Paricide,</HI> was beaten with Rods upon his naked
Body, till the Blood gusht out of all the Veins of his Body; then
he was sowed up in a Leathern Sack called a <HI>Culeus,</HI> with a Cock,
a Viper, and an Ape, and thrown Headlong into the Sea.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord, Patricide</HI> is a greater Crime than <HI>Paricide,</HI> all the
World over.</P>
<P>“In a Triumph, <HI>My Lord,</HI> when the Conqueror was Riding in
his Triumphal Chariot, Crowned with Lawrels, Adorned with
Trophies, and Applauded with Huzza's, there was a Monitor ap∣pointed
to stand behind him, to warn, Not to be High-minded,
nor Pussed up with Overveening Thoughts of himself; and to
his Chariot were tied a Whip and a Bell, to mind him, That, for
all his Glory and Grandeur, he was Accountable to the People
for his Administration, and would be Punished as other Men, if
found Guilty.</P>
<P>“The greatest Honour amongst us, <HI>My Lord,</HI> is to Represent the
Sovereign's Sacred Person in Parliament; and, in one particular,
<PB N="36" REF="336"/>
it appears to be greater than that of a Triumph; because the whole
Legislative Power seems to be wholly Intrusted with him: If he
give the Royal Assent to an Act of the Estates, it becomes a Law
Obligatory upon the Subject, tho' contrary or without any Instructi∣ons
from the Sovereign: If he refuse the Royal Assent to a Vote
in Parliament, it cannot be a Law, tho' he has the Sovereign's
particular and positive Instructions for it.</P>
<P>“His Grace the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> who now Represents Her
<HI>Majesty</HI> in this Session of Parliament, hath had the Honour of that
Great Trust, as often, if not more than any <HI>Scots</HI> Man ever had;
He hath been the Favorite of two Successive Sovereigns; and
I cannot but commend his Constancy and Perseverance, that,
notwithstanding his former Difficulties and unsuccessful Attempts,
and maugre some other Specialities not yet determined, that his
Grace has yet had the Resolution, to undertake the most unpopu∣lar
Measures last: If his Grace succeed in this Affair of an Union,
and that it prove for the Happiness and Welfare of the Nation,
then he justly Merits to have a Statue of Gold erected for himself:
but if it shall tend to the intire Destruction &amp; Abolition of our Na∣tion;
and that we the Nation's Trustees shall go into it; then
I must say. That a Whip and a Bell, a Cock, a Viper, and an
Ape, are but too small Punishments for any such bold unnatural
Undertaking and Complaisance.</P>
<P>“That I may path a way, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to a full, calm and free
Reasoning upon this Affair, which is of the last Consequence un∣to
this Nation; I shall mind this Honourable House, that we
are the Successors of our Noble Predecessors who founded our Mo∣narchy,
framed our Laws, amended, altered and corrected them
from time to time, as the Affairs and Circumstances of the Nation
did require, without the Assistance or Advice of any Foreign
Power or Potentate, and who, during the time of 2000 Years,
have handed them down to us a free Independent Nation, with
the Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes;5 Shall not we then ar∣gue
for that, which our Progenitors have purchased for us at so
dear a Rate, and with so much Immortal Honour and Glory?
GOD forbid. Shall the Hazard of a Father unbind the Ligaments
of a Dumb Son's Tongue; and shall we hold our Peace, when
our <HI>Patria</HI> is in Danger? I speak this, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That I may
incourage every Individual Member of this House, to speak their
Mind freely. There are many Wise and Prudent Men amongst
us, who think it not worth their while to open their Mouths;
there are others, who can speak very well, and to good Purpose,
who shelter themselves under the shameful Cloak of Silence, from
a Fear of the Frowns of Great Men and Parties. I have observed,
<HI>My Lord,</HI> by my Experience, the greatest Number of Speakers in
the most Trivial Affairs; and it will always prove so, while we
come not to the right Understanding of our Oath <HI>de fideli,</HI> where∣by
we are bound not only to give our Vote, but our Faithful
Advice in Parliament, as we should <HI>Answer to GOD;</HI> and in our
<PB N="37" REF="337"/>
Ancient Laws, the Representatives of the Honourable Barons and
the Royal Burrows are termed Spokesmen: It lyes upon your
Lordships therefore, particularly to take notice of such, whose
Modesty makes them Bashful to Speak. Therefore I shall leave it
upon you, and conclude this Point, with a very Memorable Say∣ing,
of an Honest private Gentleman, to a great <HI>Queen,</HI> upon
Occasion of a State Project, contrived by an able Statesman, and
the Favorite to a great <HI>King,</HI> against a Peaceable Obedient
People, because of the Diversity of their Laws and Constitutions.
<HI>If at this time thou hold thy Peace, Salvation shall come to the People
from another place, but than and thy House shall perish.</HI> I leave the
Application to each particular Member of this House.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> I come now to consider our <HI>Divisions.</HI> We are under
the Happy Reign (Blessed be GOD) of the <HI>Best of Queens,</HI> Who
has no Evil Design against the meanest of Her Subjects, Who
Loves all Her People, and is equally Beloved by them again;
and yet, that, under the Happy Influence of our most Excellent
<HI>Queen,</HI> there should be such Divisions and Factions, more dange∣rous
and threatning to Her Dominions, than if we were under an
Arbitrary Government, is most strange and unaccountable. Un∣der
an Arbitrary Prince, all are willing to Serve, because all are
under a Necessity to Obey, whether they will or not. He chooses
therefore whom he will, without respect to either Parties or Facti∣ons;
and it he think fit to take the Advices of his Councils or
Parliaments, every Man speaks his Mind freely, and the Prince re∣ceives
the Faithful Advice of his People, without the Mixture of
Self-designs: If he prove a Good Prince, the Government is
easy; it Bad, either Death or a Revolution brings a Deliverance.
Whereas here, <HI>My Lord,</HI> there appears no End of our Misery, if
not prevented in time; Factions are now become Independent,
and have got Footing in Councils, in Parliaments, in Treaties, in
Armies, in Incorporations, in Families, among Kindred, yea Man
and Wife are not free from their Political Jarrs.</P>
<P>“It remains therefore, <HI>My Lord,</HI> that I enquire into the Nature
of these things, and since the Names give us not the Right Idea
of the thing, I am afraid I will have Difficulty to make my self
well understood.</P>
<P>“The Names generally used to denote the Factions, are <HI>Whig</HI>
and <HI>Torie,</HI> as obscure as that of the <HI>Guelfs</HI> and <HI>Gibelins:</HI> Yea,
<HI>My Lord,</HI> they have different Significations, as they are applyed
to Factions in each Kingdom, a <HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>England</HI> is a Heterogene∣cus
Creature, in <HI>Scotland</HI> he is all of a pieces a <HI>Tory</HI> in <HI>England</HI> is
all of a piece and a <HI>Statesmen,</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> he is quite other∣ways,
an Anti-courteour and Anti-statesman.</P>
<P>“A <HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> appears to be somewhat like <HI>Nebuchadnez∣zar's</HI>
Image of different Mettals, different Classes, different Prin∣ciples
and different Designs; yet take them all together, they
are like a piece of fine mixed Droggat of different Threeds, some
Finer, some Courser, which after all make a comely Appearance,
<PB N="38" REF="338"/>
and an agreeable Suit. A <HI>Tory</HI> is like a piece of Loyal-made <HI>English</HI>
Cloath, the true Staple of the Nation, all of a Threed; yet it we
look narrowly into it, we shall perceive Diversity of Colours
which, according to the Various Situations and Positions, makes
Various Appearances; sometimes <HI>Tory</HI> is like the Moon in its Full
as appeared in the Affair of the <HI>Bill of the Occasional Conformity;</HI>
upon other occasions it appears to be under Cloud, and as if it
were Eclipsed by a greater body, as it did in the Design of the
Calling over the Illustrious Princess <HI>Sophia.</HI> However, by this we
May see their designs are to outshoot <HI>Whig</HI> in his own Bow.</P>
<P>“<HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> is a true blew <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> who, without Con∣sidering
Time or Power, Will <HI>venture their All for the Kirk:</HI> but
something less for the State. <HI>The greatest Difficulty</HI> is, how to
describe a <HI>Scots Tory:</HI> Of old, when I knew them first, <HI>Tory</HI> was
an Honest Hearted Comradish Fellow, who, provided he were
Maintain'd and Protected in his Benefices, Titles and Dignities by
the State, he was the less anxious who had the Government and
Management of the Church: but now, what he is since <HI>Jure∣Divinity</HI>
came in Fashon; and that Christianity, and by Conse∣quence,
Sa vation, comes to depend upon Episcopal Ordination, I
profess I know not what to make of him; only this I must say
for him, That he endeavours to do, by Opposition, that, which
his Brother in <HI>England</HI> endeavours, by a more Prudent and less
Scrupulous Method.</P>
<P>“Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> from these Divisions there has got up a kind
of <HI>Aristocrary,</HI> something like the Famous Triumvirate at <HI>Rome,</HI>
they are a kind of Undertakers and Pragmatick Statesmen, who
finding their Power and Strength great, and answerable to their
Designs, will make Bargains with our Gracious Sovereign, they
will serve Her faithfully, but upon their own Terms: they must
have their own Instruments, their own Measures, this Man must be
turned out, and that Man put in, and then they'll make Her the
most <HI>glorious Queen</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>“Where will this end, <HI>My Lord?</HI> Is not Her Majesty in Danger
by such a Method: Is not the Monarchy in Danger? Is not
the Nation's Peace and Tranquillity in Danger? Will a Chance
of Parties make the Nation more Happy? No, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the
Seed is sowen, that is like to afford us a perpetual Increase; it's
not an Annual Herb, it takes deep Root, it Seeds and Breeds;
and, if not timeously prevented by Her Majesty's Royal Endea∣vours,
will split the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in two.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> I think, considering our present Circumstances at
this time, the Almighty GOD has reserved this great Work for
us: We may Bruise this <HI>Hydra</HI> of Division, and Crush this <HI>Cocka∣trice's</HI>
Egg; our Neighbours in <HI>England</HI> are not yet fitted for any
such thing, they are not under the A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>licting Hand of Providence,

are pra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ently <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anaged both at Home and Abroad, their Generals
Brave and Valorous, their Armies Successful and Victorious, their
<PB N="39" REF="339"/>
Trophies and Lawrels Memorable and Surprising; Their Enemies,
Subbued and Routed, their Strong Holds Besieged and Taken,
Sieges Relieved, Marishals Killed and Taken Prisoners, Provinces
and Kingdoms are the Results of their Victories; the Royal Navy
is the Terror of <HI>Europe,</HI> their Trade and Commerce Extended
through the Universe, Incircling the whole Habitable World,
and Rendering their own Capital City the <HI>Emporium</HI> for the whole
Inhabitants of the Earthy; and which is yet more than all these
things, the Subjects freely bestowing their Treasuty upon their So∣vereign;
and above all, these vast Riches, the Sinews of War,
and without which all the Glorious Success had proven abortive;
these Treasures are managed with such Faithsulness and Nicety,
that they Answer seasonably all their Demands, tho at never so
great a distance. Upon these Considerations, <HI>My Lord,</HI> how hard
and difficult a thing will it prove, to perswade our Neighbours to
a sels denyal Bill.</P>
<P>“It's quite otherways with us, <HI>My Lord,</HI> we are an Obscure poor
People, tho' formerly of better account; removed to a remote cer∣net
of the World, without Name and without Alliances, our Posts
mean and precarious; so that I prosess, I don't think any one Post
of the Kingdom worth the Briguing after, save that of being Com∣missioner
to a long Session of a Factious <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, with an
antedated Commission, and that yet renders the rest of the Ministers
more Miserable: What hinders us then, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to lay aside our
Divisions to unite Cordially and heartily together in our present
Circumstances, when <HI>our All is at the Stake; Hannibal, My Lord,</HI>
is at our Gates, <HI>Hannibal</HI> is come within our Gates, <HI>Hannibal</HI> is
come the length of this Table, he is at the Foot of this Throne,
he will demolisli this Throne, it we take not Notice he'll seie upon
these <HI>Regalia,</HI> he'll take them as our <HI>spolia opima,</HI> and whip us out

<HEAD>No Answer.</HEAD>
<P>“<HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> I am sorry, that I must pursue the Threed
of my Sad and Melancholy Story: what remains, I am afraid,
prove as afflicting as what I have said I shall therefore Consider
the Motive, which have ingaged the two Nations to enter upon
a Treaty of Union at this time: in general, <HI>My Lord,</HI> I think both
of them had in their View to better themselves by the Treaty;
but before I enter upon the Particular Motives of each Nation,
I must inform this Honourable House, that since I can Remember,
the two Nations have altered their Sentiments upon that Affair,
even almost to Downright Contradiction, they have changed
Headbands, as we say, for <HI>England</HI> till of late never thought it
worth their pains of Treating with us; the good Bargain they made
at the Beginning, they resoive to keep, and that which we call an
Incorporating Union was not so much as in their thoughts. The first
Notice they seem'd to take of us, was in our Affair of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> when
they had most effectually broke off that defign in a manner very
well known to the World, and unnecessary to be repeated here, they
kept themselves quiet during the time of our Complaints upon that
Head. In which time our Sovereign, to satisfie the Nation and
allay their Heats, did condescend to give us some good Laws, and
amongst others that of Personal Liberties and of Peace and War;
but <HI>England</HI> having declared their Succession and extended their
Intail without ever taking Notice of us; our Gracious Sovereign
QUEEN ANNE was Graciously pleased to give the Royal Assent
to our <HI>Act of Security,</HI> and to give us a hedge to all our Sacred and
Civil Interests, by Declaring it High Treason to endeavour the Al∣teration
of them, as they were then Established. Thereupon did
follow the Threatning and Minatory Laws against us by the Parli∣ament
of <HI>England</HI> and the unjust and unequal Character of what
Her Majesty had so Graciously Condescended to in our Favours: Now
<HI>My Lord</HI> whether the desire they had to have us ingaged in the
same Succesion with them; Or whether that they found us like a
free and independent People breathing after more Liberty than
what formerly was lookt after; Or whether they were afraid of our
<HI>Act of Security</HI> in case of Her Majesties Decease: which of all these
Motives has induced them to a Treaty I leave it to themselves,
this I must say only, they have made a good Bargain this time
also.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="341"/>
“For the particular Motives that induced us, I think, they are
Obvious to be known; we found by sad Experience, that every
Man hath advanced in Power and Riches, as they have done in
Trade, and at the same time considerig that no where through
the World, Slaves are found to be Rich, though they should be
adorned with Chains of Gold, we thereupon changed our Nation
of an Incorporating Union to that of a Federal one; and being
resolved to take this Opportunity to make Demands upon them,
besore we enter into the Succession, we were content to impower
Her Majesty to Authorise and Appoint Commissioners to Treat
with the Commissioners of <HI>England,</HI> with as ample Powers as the
Lords Commissioners from <HI>England</HI> had from their Constituents,
that we might not appear to have less Considence in Her Majesty,
nor more narrow hearted in our Act than our Neighbours of <HI>Eng∣land:</HI>
and thereupon last Parliament, after Her Majesty's Gracious
Letter was Read, Desiring us to declare the Succession in the first
place, and afterwards to appoint Commissioners to Treat; we
found it necessary to renew our former <HI>Resolve,</HI> which I shall Read
to this Honourable House.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Resolve presented by the Duke of Hamilton
last Session of Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>“That this Parliament will not proceed to the Nomination of a
Successor, till we have had a previous Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> in Re∣lation
to our Commerce and other Concerns with that Nation. And
furder, it is <HI>Resolved,</HI> That this Parliament will proceed to make
such Limitations and Conditions of Government, for the Rectifica∣tion
of our Constitution, as may secure the Liberty, Religion and In∣dependency
of this Kingdom, before they proceed to the said Nomi∣nation:</P>
<P>“Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the last Session of Parliament having, before
they would enter upon any Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> by a Vote os
the House, past both an Act for Limitations, and an Act for
Rectification of our Constitution. What mortal Man has reason
to doub; the Design of this Treaty was only Federal
<HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> It remains now, that we consider the Be∣haviour
of the Lords Commissioners at the opening of this Treaty.
And before I enter upon that, allow me to make this Meditati∣on,
that if our Posterity, after we are all dead and gone, shall
sind themsclves under an ill made Bargair, and shall have a re∣course
unto our Records, and see who have been the Managers of
that Treaty, by which they have suffered so much; when they
read the Names, they will certainly conclude and say. Ah! our
Nation has been reduced to the last Extremity, at the time of this
Treaty; all our great Chieftains, all our great Peers and conside∣rable
Met; who used formerly to defend the Rights and Liber∣ties
<PB N="42" REF="342"/>
of the Nation, have been all Killed and Dead in the Bed of
Honour, before ever the Nation was necessitate to Condescend to
such Mean and Contemptible Terms; Where are the Names of the
chief Men, of the Noble Families of <HI>Stewarts, Hamiltons, Grahams,
Camphells, Gordons, Johnstons, Homes, Murrays, Kers, &amp;c.</HI> Where
are the two great Officers of the Crown, the <HI>Constable</HI> and the
<HI>Marischal of Scotland?</HI> They have certainly all been extinguished,
and now we are Slaves for ever.</P>
<P>“Whereas the <HI>English</HI> Records will make their Posterity, Reve∣rence
the Memory of the Honourable. Names who have brought
under, their Fierce, Warlike and Troublesome Neighbours, who
had Struggled so long for Independency, shed the best Blood of their
Nation, and reduced a considerable Part of their Country to be∣come
Waste and Desolate.</P>
<P>“I am Informed, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That our Commissioners did indeed
frankly tell the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> That the In∣clination
of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> were much altered of late, in
relation to an Incorporating Union, and that therefore since the
Entail was to end with Her Majesty's Life, whom GOD long pre∣serve,
it was proper to begin the Treaty upon the Foot of the
Treaty the 1604 year of GOD, the time when we came first un∣der
one Sovereign: but this the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners would not
agree to, and our Commissioners, that they might not seem ob∣stinate,
were willing to Treat and Conclude in the Terms laid be∣fore
this Honourable House, and subjected to their Determinati∣on.</P>
<P>“If the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> had been as Civil and
Complaisanr, they should certainly have sinished a Federal Treaty
likeways, that both Nations might have the Choice, which of
them to have gone into as they thought fit; but they would hear
of nothing but of an intire and compleat Union, a Name which
comprehends an Union, either by Incorporation, Surrender or Con∣quest,
whereas our Commissioners thought of nothing but a fair
equal Incorporating Union; whether this be so or no, I leave it
to every Man's Judgment; but as for my sesf, I must beg liberty
to think it no such thing. For I take an Incorporating Union to
be, where there is a change both in the material and formal Points
of Government, as if two Pieces of Mettal were melted down into
one Mase, it can neither be said to retain its former Form or Sub∣stance,
as it did before the mixture. But now when I consider this
Treaty, as it hath been Explained and Spoke to besore us these
three Weeks by past, I see the <HI>English</HI> Constitution remaining srom,
the same two Houses of Parliament, the same Taxes, the same
Customs, two same Excises, the same Trade in Companies, the same
Municipal Laws and Courts of Judicature, and all ours either sub∣ject
to Regulations, or Annihilations: only we have the Honour
to pay their old Debts, and to have some few Persons present sor
Witnelles to the Validity os the Deed, when they are plesed to
contract more.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="343"/>
“Good GOD! What is this an intire Surrender?</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> I find my Heart so full of Grief and Indignation, That
I must beg Pardon, not to finish the last part of my Discourse,
that I may drop a Tear as the Prelude to so sad a Story.</P>
<P>After having sit down, and some Discourses by other Mem∣bers
interveening, he continued his Discourse thus,</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> What I am now to say, relates to the Me∣thod
of Proceeding in this Weighty Affair: I hear it proposed
by a Noble Member of the other side, that we should proceed in the
same Order, as the Lords Commissioners Treaters did. In my humble
Opinion, <HI>My Lord,</HI> It is neither the natural Method, nor can it be
done without great Consusion and Repetition. To say, You'l
agree to the Union of the two Kingdoms, before you agree in
the Terms upon which they are to be United, seems like <HI>driving
the Plough before the Oxen:</HI> The Articles, which narrate the Con∣ditions,
seem to be the Premisses, upon which the Conclusion is
inserred; and, according as they are found good or bad, the
Success will follow. When a Man is Married to a Fortune in <HI>England.</HI>
as they call it, I suppose he is satisfied with the thing be∣fore
he determines himself to Marry; and the Proposal I have
heard of agreeing to the first Article with a <HI>Proviso,</HI> That, if the
rest of the Articles shall be found Satisfactory, and no otherwife,
is of a Piece with the rest, and looks like Beating the Air, and no∣ways
Consistent with fair and square Dealings. Besides, <HI>My Lord,</HI>
if we were to go upon the first Article, are not all the rest os the
Articles, besides many others not contained in the Ar∣ticles,
valid Arguments either, <HI>Pro or Con,</HI> against Concluding,
or not Concluding the first Article? And no Vote in this House,
can hinder a Man, from making use of what Arguments he thinks
fit. Morcover, the Searching the Records, and the Revising the
<HI>Statute Books,</HI> Comparing the Books of Rates, Customs, Excise, Taxes,
of both Nations, with one another, must all be previously consi∣dered,
ere we determine our selves in one single Article; Add to
this, That the Prohibitory Clause, with Relation to the Trade of
both Nations, must be Adjusted, lest, like <HI>Esop's</HI> Dog, we lose the
Old, in Grasping at the New; the State of the <HI>English</HI> Compa∣nies
must also be Exposed, how far we shall have Liberty into
them, and what Advantage we may propose to our selvcs, by
Trading to these Places, where they are seeured; and above all,
<HI>My Lord,</HI> the Security of our National Church, and of all that's
dear unto us, must be previously Established to us, if practicable,
before we Conclude the sirst Article. Therefore, <HI>My Lord,</HI> tho
my particular Opinion be, tho we had a <HI>Cari Blanch</HI> from <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
yet the Delivery up of our Sovereignty, gives back with
one Hand, what we receive with the other, and that there can
be no Security, without the Guarrantee of a Distinct Independen∣ey
betwixt the Parties Treating: Yet, <HI>My Lord,</HI> for further Sa∣tisfaction
<PB N="44" REF="344"/>
to this Honourable House, That every Member may
fully satisfie himself, I humbly propose, That, passing by the first
three Articles, which appear to be much of a Piece, we begin at
the fourth Article of the Treaty, and is I be seconded in this, I
desire it may be put to the Question.”</P>
<P>“I shall make no Remarks upon this last and famous Speech,
the Noble Person that spoke it, however he happened to
mistake in some things, was a Person of extraordinary Parts
and Capacity; And as he was very warm against the Uni∣on,
it made that Opposition the more considerable.</P>
<P>“This Speech, the Reader may see, was pointed directly
against the Union, and in the first part of it argues against
the Whole, in the last against the Parts—; but concludes
to move against the immediate Proceedings.</P>
<P>“The first Speech was from a Person no less capable in the
Matter of the Treaty, and that had been a Commissioner in
the Treaty at <HI>London;</HI> The Speeches are directly opposite,
and are lest thus upon Record to argue against one another.</P>
<P>“The time had been taken up with their length, and the
House, as well as the Nation, was, at this time, in an Un∣usual
Ferment, so not many Replies were made. Mr. <HI>Seton,</HI>
who made the first Speech, stood up to Answer the Lord
<HI>Beilhaven,</HI> but, as he had already spoken, the Orders of the
House, <HI>viz. That the same Member could not speak twice in the
same Canse,</HI> were urged against his speaking, and the Earl of
<HI>Ma—mont</HI> standing up to speak at the same time, the
Lord Chancellor gave place to him; who indeed made a
very short Return to so long a Speech, and which Answer
occasioned some Laughter in the House: The Earl of
<HI>Ma—monts</HI> Speech was to this Purpose, <HI>viz. He had heard
a long Speech and a very terrible one, but he was of Opinion, it
required a short Answer,</HI> which he gave in these Words, <HI>Behold
he Dream'd, but, to! when he awoke, he found it was a Dream;</HI>
This Answer, some said, was as Satisfactory to the Members,
who understood the Design of that Speech, as if it had been
Answered Vision by Vision.</P>
<P>“After these two Speeches, several Members spoke <HI>Pro</HI> and
<HI>Con;</HI> But the Debate, in Close of the Day, turned so Warm,
That, at the Desire of the House, it was Adjourned to the
next <HI>Sederunt.</HI></P>

of the Town and Paroch of <HI>Dysert,</HI> Subscribers of the same, all
against an Incorporating Union with <HI>England,</HI> and were Read.</P>
<P>Thereaster the First Article of Union was again Read, as also the
Motion mentioned in the last Minute relating thereto, <HI>viz.</HI> That it
be agreed to, in the first place, to proceed to take the First Article
os the Union to Consideration, with this Provision, That if the
other Articles of Union be not Adjusted by the Parliament, then
the Agreeing to and Approving of the First shall be of no Effect,
and that immediately after the said First Article, The Parliament
will proceed to an Act for Security of the Doctrine, Discipline,
Worship and Government of the Church, as now by Law Establish∣ed
within this Kingdom; And after some further Debate upon
the said Article, a Resolve was offered in thir Terms, viz. <HI>Where∣a
it evidently appears since the Printing, Publishing and Considering of
the Articles of Treaty, now before this House; This Nation seems gene∣rally
averse to this Incorporating Union in the Terms now before us, as
Subversive of the Sovereignty, Fundamental Constitution and Claim of
Right of this Kingdom, and as threatning Ruine to this Church as by
Law Established.</HI></P>
<P>And since it is plain, That if an Union were Agreed to in these Terms
by this Parliament, and Accepted of by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI>
it would in no sort Answer the Peaceable and Friendly Ends proposed
by an Union; But would on the centrair Create such Dismal Distrac∣tions
and Animosities amongst our selves, and such Jealousies and Mi∣stakes
betwixt us and our Neighbours, as would involve these Nations
into Fatal Breaches and Confusions.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore, Resolved,</HI> That we are willing to enter into such an Uni∣on
with our Neighbours of <HI>England,</HI> as shall Unite us intirely, and af∣ter
the most strict manner, in all their and our Interests of Succelsion
Wars, Alliances and Trade, Reserving to Us the Sovereignty and In∣dependency
of Our Crown and Monarchy, and Immunities of the King∣dom,
and the Constitution and Frame of the Government both of Church
and State, as they stand now Established by our Fundamental Constitu∣tion,
<PB N="46" REF="346"/>
by our Claim of Right, and by the Laws following thereupon; Or,
<HI>Resolved,</HI> That we will proceed to settle the same Succession with <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
upon such Conditions and Regulations of Government within our
selves, as shall effectually secure the Sovereignty and Independency of this
Crown and Kingdom, and the Indissolvable Society of the same, with
the Fundamental Rights and Constitntions of the Government both of
Church and State, as the same stands Established by the <HI>Claim of Right,</HI>

<HI>Scotland,</HI> with the Crown and Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and, that both

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XV.</HEAD>
<P>“It is very remarkable, That the Addresses now began to
Throng upon the House, and we find them at the beginning
of every Vote; The Debates of this Day visibly discovered
the Reason and Design of procuring these Addresses, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That they might form an Argument from the general Aver∣sions
of the Nation, and from thence, &amp; the bringing the Soul∣diers
into the City, it was called a Cramming the Union
down their Throats.</P>
<P>“At the same time it was visible, there were such Methods
made use of to procure Addresses, such want of Hands, such
kinds of People who signed, such a Paucity of Gentry, where
the Counties were full of Gentlemen, and such Varieties of
Circumstances concurring, to make it appear, that it was the
labour'd performance of a Party, that, <HI>it was thought,</HI> they
met with the less regard.</P>
<P>“There were indeed in several places Addresses prepared
from the Gentry of the Country for the Encouragement of
the Treaty, but it was concluded to be needless, since that
would have been a kind os telling Noses without Doors, and
the Party would have been pleased, to have had it past for
a sort of Polling the Nation, in which, they having before
dissatisfied and allarm'd the common People, they had the
most Hopes of Success—; This therefore was laid aside,
as a Step that would be of no use, and would put the Uni∣on
upon a Tryal altogether inconsistent with the Constitution,
and, as it were, debate it <HI>a-la-Mob.</HI></P>
<P>“And therefore none of the Addresses on the other side
were presented, tho I have the Originals of some by me,
which were actually sign'd by the Country Gentlemen, and
which were highly Expressive of their Assent to the I reaty,
and os their Reasons for it, some of which were particularly
the Danger of Popery, and of Introducing the old Tyranny
in the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="348"/>
“Nor' can it but be reasonably supposed, That had the
Noblemen and Gentlemen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well in the Parli∣ament
as without, who were Hearty in the Business of the
Union, gone Home, and raised their Tenants, Vassals, and
Dependencies, to have appeared for the Union, either in the
Addresses, or in the Field, they would, taking it at sirst, as
much have Overpowered the other Party without Doors, as
they Outvoted them within, since it was known, that except
the Duke of <HI>At—le,</HI> the principal Number of the Opposers,
were not Men of the greatest Interest in their Country, I mean
as to the Command of their Vassals and Attendants.</P>
<P>“But they never brought it to the Extremity of that Tryal,
and therefore the Motions of the Party as to General Aver∣sions,
being laid aside, they found themselves under a
Necessity of Struggling in Parliament only.</P>
<P>“The Endeavours of Mobbing the Parliament were supprest,
and the Addresses obtained only a Reading, but had no direct
Answer given them, other than the Proceedings of the House
of Course, made out; the Thing now to be carried on within
Doors was, to load the Treaty with Impracticable Amendments,
while the Party without Doors endeavoured on the one
Hand, to raise Tumults in the Country, bring up popular
Addresses, and at last, down-right Rebellion, as in its place
will appear: And on the other Hand, to Displease and
Dissatisfie the Ministers, and bring them to appear publickly
Uneasy; Of which we shall see further in its place.</P>
<P>“The Debates of this day were very Warm, and several
long Speeches were made, but it was impossible to obtain
Abstracts of Speeches, which we could but just hear, and I
shall not venture to Injure, either the Speaker or Hearer, by
imposing my Language upon them, to Express what others
said.</P>
<P>“Long Debates were offered to the second part of the Vote
above, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Union was Impracticable, that the
Joyning of Nations could not be, would tend to Con∣fusion,
and be necessarily broken, as in the Vote. This was
raised upon the aforesaid Book of Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> and proved evi∣dently,
that it was not his Hypothesis, but a Concert of
Heads—, and his interfeiring Interests were here discoursd
of.</P>
<P>“I am not willing, to Examine into the Inconsistencies of
some peoples Notions, started here in Matters of Interests,
and how they raised Objections, which were not Grounded
on Fact, Especially in Matters of Trade, I bury them in
Silence, in respect to the Gentlemen; But it was next to
Miraculous, to hear Men of sense alledge, That <HI>England</HI> got
nothing by her <HI>West-India</HI> Trade, that most of her Forreign
Trade was Engrossed by exclusive Companies, that <HI>Scotland</HI>

got nothing by Trading with <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>Scotland</HI> could
Gain by any Foreign Trade but <HI>England,</HI> and the like; these
things will more evidently be detected hereafter.</P>
<P>“In short, a Federal Union was offered, <HI>That was understood,</HI> any
thing but the Right, any thing but the Treaty now begun, be∣anduse,
could they have obtain'd a Vote against the present
Teaty, the gaining Time for another Parliament had followed,
and the Design of putting off, or delaying Time; had taken
Effect.</P>
<P>“Some Gentlemen, with extraordinary Reason and Force
of Argument, endeavoured to Explain them the Absurdities and
Inconsistencies of that Project &amp; put the House in mind, that it
was not a Federal Union, or a better Union that those
Gentlemen desired, but really no Union at all; And that the
Design was to Defeat the Endeavours of the Union only, in
order to bring in <HI>French</HI> Bondage, and King <HI>James</HI> VIII upon
them.</P>
<P>“Upon the whole, the other Party soon saw in the House, it
would go against them, &amp; therefore, before it was put to the Vote,
the Duke of <HI>A—ole</HI> gave in his Protest, as in the Vote, toge∣ther
with the whole Party of Opposers, on whatsoever prin∣ciple
they Opposed; which Protest they had ready Concerted
before, expecting, as was supposed, Things would go as they
did, and that they should be Overpowered in the House.</P>
<P>“I can not but Note here, that this great Debate, and on
which the whole Weight of the Matter depended, happened
on that Famous Day to <HI>Britain,</HI> I mean the very Day on
which the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> afterward King <HI>William</HI> came to
<HI>England,</HI> and was also the Birth-day of that Glorious Mo∣narch.</P>
<P>“On the same day, now a second time, the Fate of <HI>Britain</HI>
had a new Turn, and the success of that gave a pleasanc
presage to many observing People of the future happy Issue of
the Thing now in hand.</P>
<P>“The Gentlemen, who let slip no occasion to puzzle the
Debates of this Matter, had now conceiv'd great hopes of a
Broil among the Ministers, and were exceeding busie, to sill
the Heads os some of the Gentlemen of the Clergy with Jea∣lousies
and Dissatissactions—, and yet I can not say, they
brought in the Overture at this time, tho' they were always
forward to push on that side too.</P>
<P>“I can not say neither, that they met with no Encouragement
here, or that there were no WarmHeads to befound in the Com∣mission,
who apter to take Fire than was to be wished, were
more easily gain'd, but if there were any such, the Prudence
and Moderation of the rest of the Commission, so Over-ruled
them, as kept them from any Precipitations, and Contributed
greatly to the General Sasety; Of which I have spoken more
largely in its place.</P>

<P>“I have already given an account of the Birth of this Paper
called, <HI>The Representation and Petition,</HI> and the several Diffi∣culties
it met with in the Commission of the Assembly, and
which, some have said, was a Reason, why it met with less
Encouragement in the Parliament, than was expected, but it
may be worth Notice, that not with standing it did not meet
with a very kind Reception, some of the Gentlemen having
been disobliged in the Case of their Protest, yet the House
did not wholly Omit the Things desired in it.</P>
<P>“Some of the Gentlemen, who, as Ruling Elders, had pro∣tested
in the Commission, had it seems met with some Per∣sonal
Reflections from the Rashness of some Members; that was
disobliging enough, and upon which they had withdrawn
themselves from the Commission, and seldom, if at all,
came there any more during the whole Sitting; And tho
the Rashness of the Persons who gave those Reflections, was
not Approved by the Commission, yet it stuck a little too
closs with some People, and it was thought, made them less
careful of the Application made by the Ministers in this Case.</P>
<P>“Upon the receiving the Representation or Petition into
the House, there were no Debates of any Consequence, it was
only Read, and the Act of Security being as per the Minutes
Adjourned, the other lay by of Course.</P>
<P>“The Money Bill now came on, and as the other Party
thought the speeding of it might be a Step, to put an End to
the Session, they all came into it, and gave it all the dispatch
possible.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="353"/>
“It was apparent, that in order to break up this Treaty,
the Gentlemen studied all possible Methods to raise the Par∣liament
—, this they could never have done while the
Funds remained Unsettled, because it being a Thing of such
Consequence to the Kingdom, the whole Countrey would
have laid it at their Door, and the Queen would have had
the highest Affront put upon both Her Person and Govern∣ment
imaginable; And therefore this was one of the first
Things they pusht at, and that made it pass immediately with
no Opposition at all, those Gentlemen complying with it as
it was removing an Obstruction to their General Design.</P>

<P>Thereafter the following Addresses were given in and read, <HI>viz.</HI>

made of all the Acts in favours of the Kirk; And after some Rea∣soning
thereon, the Vote was stated, <HI>Approve of the Clause as it

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Amendments here made to the Act for Security of the
Church, make it evident, that the Parliament did not slight∣ly
pass over that Affair, as some people pretended they would
do, tho' they did not enter into the debate of the Insufficien∣cy
which some offered, as Things which tended not to Amend∣ments
of the Act as it was offered, but to a Rupture of the
Debate; for the People who offered at the Insufficiency of
the Act, went upon this Foot; Not that this Overture or
Act was an Insufficient Security, but that really the Union
with <HI>England</HI> as an Episcopal Nation, was Inconsistent with
the Safety of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that not this Act
only was, but any other Act that could be made, would be
Insufficient to secure the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“This appeared to be the plain Design, in that
as I have already noted, the Gentlemen that spoke
Loudest for the Insufficiency of the Act of Security,
were not of those People, who really were most concerned
for the Safety of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Objections also
were not Calculated for Amendments or Additions, but for De∣stroying
the Bill it self, as Built on the supposition of a Union,
which, they said, Was a Foundation that would not bear
such a Superstructure—. And tho' some well meaning
Men too were of Opinion, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> could
not really be safe in a Union within <HI>England;</HI> yet these
Gentleman, as is noted, applyed it purely as an Obstacle
to the Union, and as a Thing by which means, they
hoped, to render the Union Universally Odious and Terrible
to the People.</P>
<P>“And this will be more apparent from the Protest entered
into, after all the Clauses were Read, and after all Amend∣ments,
that could be reasonably desired, were agreed to, as
will appear in the next days Minute.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIX.</HEAD>
<P>“The reading of the Act of Security having been begun last
day, several Amendments were offered, such as first the Enu∣merating
the Acts of Parliament upon which it was grounded;
This admitted no long Debates, if it had had any Significa∣tion,
it would have been granted, but it was generally esteemed
a thing of no value, meerly unnecessary and trifling, and as
such was rejected: The Reason given was, because one Act
is particularly specified to be ratified by this Treaty, <HI>to wit,</HI>
The 4<HI>th Act</HI> of the 1<HI>st Parliament</HI> of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen
<HI>Mary,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act Ratifying the Confession of Faith, and
Settling Presbyterian Church Government,</HI> and then it mentions
<HI>With the hail other Acts relating, thereunto,</HI> which was thought
sufficient and full enough.</P>
<P>“The next Amendment was for the Colleges, which was
found reasonable, and was hinted by some, who had, not
without just Cause observed, how much the Schools of the
Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> are regretted by some People, who en∣vy
the Encrease of their Number; And this therefore, as a
most reasonable Demand, was immediately agreed to by the
the Parliament and is made part of the Act, as will appear
by the Draught of the Bill.</P>
<P>“The Fourth Clause had an Objection of greater Moment
depending on it, which caused long Debates, and was built
on a Foundation, however plausible and just in it self, had
yet such a known Impossibility before it, <HI>morally speaking,</HI> as
that no small Hopes were conceived from it, that it would
shock the whole Treaty.</P>
<P>“All Men know. That, in <HI>England,</HI> by the <HI>TEST ACT, as
it is called,</HI> all Persons that obtain any Office, Civil or Mili∣tary,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are obliged to take the Sacrament, according to
the Usage of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to bring Certifi∣cates,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the same, under pain of Incapacity, among
<PB N="57" REF="357"/>
other Penalties: Now it was a most plausible Argument,
Thar, it the Subjects of both Kingdoms were to enjoy equal
Privileges, the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> taking the Sacrament in
the National Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> ought to be as capable of
Places or Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> taking the
Sacrament in the National Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“Nor was this Matter carried a little Way, but became the
Subject of infinite Discontents without Doors, and of long
Disputes within—; It was suggested <HI>and printed too, by
the same Author, of whom mention is already made, at Writing
against the Union,</HI> That all the Members of Parliament in
<HI>England</HI> were obliged to take the Sacrament before they could
sit in the House, but this, <HI>as false in Fact,</HI> was crush'd at first,
several Accounts being given of its being quite otherways
—; But then this Clause coming in upon the Neck of that
Surmise, it was thought a Popular Argument, and indeed was
so: And the People began to be very uneasy about it, said
the Parliament would give up all to the <HI>English;</HI> That this
was so fair a Thing, it could not be argued against, and in∣deed
a great many People looked upon the Thing, <HI>viz.
taking of the English TEST,</HI> as what they wished earnestly
enough to have done; but the more penetrating Judg∣ments
saw further into the Depth of this, and finding it a De∣sign
purely strikeing at the Root of the Union, they were the
rather inclined to drop it, tho' they at the same time desired it
—, the Difficulty lying in this, That the Sacramen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
being a thing the <HI>English</HI> Parliament have been very Tenacious us
of, upon all Occasions, this would be to ask something which
they knew would not be granted, and consequently pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the
Treaty to a Stop.</P>
<P>“Others again proposed a Reciprocal Test to be placed in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> to secure <HI>or exclude all such of the</HI> English <HI>Nation, as
would not acknowlege this Church, &amp;c.</HI> The Tenor of this was
according to the lotto wing Copy, which they called a <HI>For<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ula.</HI></P>
<P>“I <HI>A. B.</HI> do Swear and Declare, That the Presbyterian Go∣vernment
of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurch is a lawful Government, and that I shall
neither, directly nor indirectly, do any thing to the Alt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration
thereof.</P>
<P>“But this also dropped of it self, for some People that were
nevertheless against the Union; yet were against this sort of
Reciprocal Oath, as a thing they did not approve oil any Ac∣count
one or other.</P>
<P>“there were some small Amendments to the Fifth and Sixth
Clause, but not of Consequence, and thus this difficult Mat∣ter
was past into a Law.</P>
<P>“There were some who clamour'd very much on this Heat,
and a great many personal Reflections were made, I will not
say, altogether without Cause, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Church was aban∣doned
by her own Friends, <HI>or at least by those who pretended
to be so;</HI> That, if they had asked more, it might have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="58" REF="358"/>
obtained; and that the Demands the Ministers made, were
not duly weighed, <HI>much less answered;</HI> but yet it seems, on
the whole, that the main Foundation Article, <HI>viz.</HI> The E∣stablishment
of the Church Government unalterable, was effect∣tually
secured; and tho' some particulars might be omitted,
the Church has no open place left, at which her Enemies
can wound her Constitution.</P>
<P>“There were great Clamours raised, both within and
without the House, about the Insufficiency of this Act of Se∣curity,
as that it was <HI>lessening the Security the Church already
had by the Claim of Right,</HI> and not providing an Equivalent
Security in the Room of it; That the very Treating of it, im∣plyed
a further Security was needful, and yet no further Secu∣rity
was provided, than alone confirming the Claim of Right.</P>
<P>“This was the Foundation of the Proposal of the Reciprocal
Test, or an Oath to secure the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in like
manner, as the Test Act is for the Security of the Church of
<HI>England.</HI> Of which above.</P>
<P>“ Another Objection was, That tho' indeed the Act of <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
and Mary was confirmed, yet, that the Act declaring it
to be High Treason to Impugn the Claim of Right was not
confirmed, nor the other Acts relating thereto specified—;
Nor some Ancient obsolete Acts taken away, which stand
unrepealed, and which are inconsistent with Presbyterian
Government.</P>
<P>“This was Answered, particularly as to Enumerating the Acts
<HI>as above</HI> and as to Repealing the Acts, the Twenty Fifth Ar∣ticle
of the Union declares all Acts contraveening this Trea∣ty
to be so far, as they do so contraveen this Treaty, <HI>ipso
facto</HI> Repealed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>“Again it was objected, That here was no Provision made
for Prevention of Mischief to the Church, for want of a Com∣mission
or Court for Plantation of Kirks, and Valuation of
Teinds, which is what the Church will be in great want of.</P>
<P>“This was effectually Answered, by settling an Act of Par∣liament,
previous to the Union, for the Plantation of Kirks
and Valuation of Teinds, <HI>Impowering</HI> the Lords of Council and
Session to Judge, Cognosce and Determine in all Affairs and Causes
whatsoever, which, by the Laws and Acts of Parliament of this
Kingdom, were formerly referred to, and did pertain and belong
to the Jurisdiction and Cognizance of the Commissioners formerly
appointed for that Effect, as fully and freely in all respects, at the
said Lords do or may in other Civil Causes.</P>
<P>“The great and main Objections were against the Possibility
of either Church or State being secured so by this Treaty, as
that a <HI>British</HI> Parliament might not overwhelm it again by
Plurality of Voices, which is a supposed Content.</P>
<P>“This, as the same, with the general Objection against the
Union, was answered in the general Terms of the Union,
<PB N="59" REF="359"/>
<HI>viz.</HI> That this was to remain Unalterable for ever, and there∣fore
could not be supposed to be Temporary.</P>
<P>“Upon the Debate of these Things its plain, what I have
so often alledged on these Gentlemen, and which therefore is
not putting it as my Opinion, which I am not at all forward
to offer to the World; but it appears. That the Objection
of the Gentlemen did not so much ly against particular Clau∣ses,
tho' they thought fit to dispute their Ground by Inches
there too, but this Objection lay against the general Head,
<HI>The Union,</HI> and they brought every Head, as they went thro'
them, to shock directly with the whole Treaty.</P>
<P>“ Thus in the Prorest given in here by the Lords Dissenting,
it is expresly said. That the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> can have no
real and solid Security by any manner of Union, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—as
<HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>“Also it is to be noted here, That the Gentlemen <HI>of the side</HI>
were the first who Moved to Print the Names of all those that
Voted to the first Article, <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con,</HI> which was thought at
that time a day, an Exposing the Persons to the popular
Resentment, the Tumults of the People beginning to be at
that time very high.</P>
<P>“But the other Party, who had agreed voluntarily to the,
said Printing of Names, took the Advantage now, and Mov'd,
That the fame might be done also, in the Vote about the Church,
by which the Episcopal Party were brought in, protesting
in behalf of the Church: The Gentlemen would have avoid∣ed
if, but having been the first in putting the like upon the
other, they could not shun it: This Exposed them very much,
and opened the Eyes of many of the People, when they saw
such People Voting for the Church, who never own'd the
Church in their Lives; and others Voting against the Thing,
who were constant Members of the Church, and had given
constant proof of their Zeal for the Churches advantage.</P>
<P>“And thus the Act of Security was past, and after Engrossed
into the Body of the Articles, as will appear by the Act of
Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXI.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debates of this Day made yet a larger Discovery of
the Affair, and the Gentlemen who were against the Union,
struggling on all Occasions against the going on of the Ar∣ticles,
took now a new measure.</P>
<P>“The Marquess of <HI>An—dale</HI> made this Motion for the Suc∣cession,
as appeared by the Lord s <HI>Beilhavens</HI> Speech; There
had been a Party of Gentlemen, as was before observed,
who were always for the Succession with Limitations, but
were opposed by others who were intirely against the Succes∣sion
at all, as it respected the House of <HI>Hannover:</HI> But as
several People differing in their other Sentiments, yet joyned
in their opposing the Union, so here the strongest Opposers
of the Succession came now into the Thing they had so long
opposed, and moved now for the Succession with Limitations,
in order to avoid the Union.</P>
<P>“My Lord <HI>Beilhaven</HI> seconded this with another Speech,
which was afterward printed, in which his Lordship moved for
settling the Succession upon the Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> of <HI>Hannover &amp;c.</HI>
I have printed this Speech the rather, because it is really the
Subsrance or Recital of three Speeches, as will be seen in the
particulars of it, and shews plainer than I can otherways ex∣press,
how that part was acted.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<OPENER>My Lord Chancellor.</OPENER>
<P>“Your Lordship may remember the last day, when we
had under Consideration, whether to proceed to the
<HI>Fourth</HI> or <HI>Second Article,</HI> That I did Witness my Con∣cern
and Resentment, to find so many Honourable and
Worthy Members of this House, so forward to sinish
the Demands of <HI>England,</HI> in this Treaty; without tak∣ing
Notice of any one Article, that could be properly
said to relate to the Demands of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“Now, that we are entered upon the <HI>Second Article,</HI>
I desire to be resolved in one QUESTION, <HI>what are
the Motives, that should engage us to take</HI> England's <HI>Succes∣for
upon their own Terms?</HI> Is it not strange, that no
<PB N="64" REF="364"/>
ANSWER should be given to this Question, save that,
<HI>When yen come to consider the rest of the Articles, you shall
be satisfied on that Demand?</HI> This is a new way of Ar∣guing,
<HI>My Lord,</HI> a Method without Precedent, ranver∣sing
Nature; and looks more like Design than Fair-Dealing.
I profess, I think the Huge and Prodigious
Rains, that we have had of late, have either drowned
out, or found out another Channel for <HI>Reasoning,</HI> than
what was formerly; for by what I can see by this <HI>New
Method,</HI> the Agreeing to the First Article, shall be found
a sufficient Reason why we should agree to the <HI>Second,</HI> and
the Agreeing to the <HI>Second</HI> for the Thirds and so for all.</P>
<P>“If there was ever such a Farce acted; if ever Reason
was Hudibras'd, this is the time: Consult all the Treaties
since the beginning of the World to this day, and if you
can find any one Precedent, I shall yield the Cause.</P>
<P>“I shall Instance, <HI>My Lord,</HI> one for all, and that is,
The first and worst Treaty that ever was set on Foot for
Mankind; and jyet, I am sorry to say it, there appears
more Ingenuity in if, than in our Procedure: When
the <HI>Serpent</HI> did Deceive our Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> he proposed
three Advantages, before he presum'd to Advise her to
to <HI>Eat the Forbidden Fruit:</HI> The <HI>First</HI> was taken from
the <HI>Sight,</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> from the Taste, and the <HI>Third</HI> from
the <HI>Advantage</HI> following thereupon. That from the
<HI>Sight,</HI> was inforced by a <HI>Behold, how lovely and comely a
thing it is, it's pleasant to the Eye.</HI> That from the Taste,
from a Perswasion, that it was Good for Nourishment,
<HI>it's good for Food.</HI> That from the <HI>Advantage,</HI> it will
make yon wife, ye shall he as the <HI>Gods;</HI> therefore, upon
all these Considerations, <HI>Eat.</HI></P>
<P>“Allow me, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to run the Parallel of this, with
Relation to our Procedure in this <HI>Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>“Upon the first Account that our Nation had, of the
Treaty's being finished betwixt the two Nations, People
appeared all generally very well satisfied, as a thing
that would tend to the Removal of all Jealousies, and
the settling a good Understanding betwixt the two
Kingdoms. But, so soon as the <HI>Articles of the Treaty</HI> ap∣pcared
in Print, the very Sight of them made such a
Change, as is almost inconceivable; they were so far
from being pleasant to the Eye, <HI>My Lord,</HI> that the Na∣tion
appears to abhor them.</P>
<P>“One would think, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That it had been the
Interest of those, who arc satisfied with the Thing, to
have gone immediately into the Merits of these particu∣lar
Articles which relate to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to have said,
<HI>Gentlemen, be not affrighted with their ugly Shape, they
are better than they arc bonny; Come, Taste, come make a</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="365"/>
narrow Search and Inquiry, they are good for <HI>Scotland,</HI>
the wholesomest Food that a Decaying Nation can take:
You shall find, the Advantages, you shall find a Change of
Condition, you shall become Rich immediately; you shall be
like the English, the most Flourishring and Richest People of
the Universe.</P>
<P>“But our Procedure, <HI>My Lord,</HI> hath been very far
from the Prudence of the <HI>Serpent;</HI> for all our Arguments
have run upon this blunt Topick, <HI>Eat, swallow down
this Incorporating Union,</HI> tho it please neither Eye nor
Taste, it must go over: You must believe your Physicians, and
we shall confider the Reasons for it afterwards.</P>
<P>I wish, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That our Loss be not in some small
manner Proportionable to that of our first Parents, they
thought to have been Incorporate with the Gods: But
in place of that, they were justly Expelled Paradise, Lost
their Sovereignty over the Creatures, and were forced
to Earn their Bread with the Sweat of their Brows.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> I have heard a Proposal, made
from the other Side by the Marquis of <HI>Annandale;</HI>
That, in place of Agreeing to this <HI>Second Article,</HI> where∣in
the Succession is to be Declared, as a Consequence
of our being United to <HI>England</HI> in one Kingdom, we
should immediately go to Intail our Crown upon the
Illustrious Family of <HI>Hannover,</HI> upon such Conditions
and Limitations as are in our own Power to make, for
the Security of our Sacred and Civil Concerns. I
think, This is the Import of what his Lordship gave in,
by a Resolve formerly, and hath told this Honourable
House, That he thinks, he acts Consequentially to his
Former declared Principles, and that this is now the on∣ly
Measure, which can fettle and secure the Peace and
Quiet of this Nation, and six a firm Security for the Pro∣testant
Interest, and a perfect Understanding betwixt
the two Nations.</P>
<P>“I have also heard a Discourse, by his Grace the Duke
of Hamilton, shewing, That ever since his Grace had
the Honour to be a Member of this Honourable House,
he had made it his Business to serve the Sovereign and
his Nation faithfully and honestly, without any By-Ends,
By-Views, or Self-Interests; That before the
Affair of the Succession was Tabled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he had
endeavoured to promote the Interest of his Nation, by
Good Laws, and by the best Counsels he was capable
to give, for rectifying Things amiss, and advancing
the solid Interest of his Country; That since the Affair
of the Succession came to be Considered, he could never
give himself the Liberty to believe, but chat previous
to any Settlement we ought to have had such Condle∣seensions
<PB N="66" REF="366"/>
scensions with Relation to Trade and Commerce from
<HI>England,</HI> as might Retrieve the Losses the, Nation hath
sustained from them, ever since the Union of the Two
Crowns under one Sovereign; and that thereupon, to
prevent all Faction and Party in the Treating of an Affair
of such Importance, he had freely left the Nomination
of the Lords Commissioners to Her Majesty, and wishes
the Choice had been Answerable to his Design. But
none can accuse him as Bargaining for himself, since he
has no Reason to Complain of the Breach of any Sti∣pulation
upon that Head; That now having Consider∣ed
the Articles of this Treaty lying before us, and the
Fatal Consequences that may follow upon the Finishing
of an Incorporating Union with <HI>England,</HI> with the ge∣neral
<HI>Aversation</HI> that <HI>appears by the Addresses from the
several Shires of the Kingdom,</HI> and particularly from <HI>the
Address of the Commission of the General Assembly, and of
the Royal Burrows of</HI> Scotland; he finds it necessary to al∣ter
his Thoughts of that Matter, That he was none of
these who loved to keep Things Loose and in Confusion;
He had an Estate in both Kingdoms, and therefore it was
not to be supposed, he would make use only of a Treaty,
to throw out the Succession one time; and of the Succes∣sion,
to throw off the Treaty another time. Therefore to
prevent worse Consequences he is content, That in this
Parliament, the Succession be Declared and Settled upon
the Illustrious Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> Electoress of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and
the Heirs of Her Body, upon such Conditions and Limi∣tations
as shall be found necessary by this Parliament, to
secure our Civil Rights and Liberties, the Independency
and Sovereignty of the Nation, &amp; the Presbyterian Govern∣ment
of this Church, as it is Founded upon the <HI>Claim of
Right,</HI> and Established by Law, and whose Privileges
and Settlement he Resolves to Support with the Outmost
of his Power.</P>
<P>“And therefore, his Grace thinks himself Obliged
with all Humility in this present Juncture of Affairs, to
Address himself particularly to His Grace My Lord Com∣missioner,
and to beg of his Grace, That he would be
pleased to acquaint Her Mujesty with the True State of the
Nation, and with the Proposal made for Allaying the
present Ferment and Settling a Solid Peace and Good Un∣derstanding
betwixt Her Two Kingdoms, and that a small
Recess may be granted in the mean time, till Her Maje∣sty's
Gracious Answer come, which, with all Submission,
he conceives, will prevent these Bad Consequences that
the further Pushing on of this Treaty may occasion. I
I think, <HI>My Lord,</HI> this is materially what his Grace said,
Tho' not so fully nor so well expressed.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="367"/>
Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> it remains, that I give Account of
`my self and of my own Opinion of this Affair. All who
know me, <HI>My Lord,</HI> know that I have been from the
beginning on a Revolution; foot; I ventured my 'Life
and Fortune with the First, and I have ever since acted
Consequentially to my Principle. It's true I was never
a good Courtier under any Reign; because I had a Rule
for my Obedience, and never made Obedience my Rule;
my Reputation was never stained, Nor had I ever any
Reproach laid upon me, save when I was brought in,
Head over Ears, in a SCOTS PLOT, <HI>A Plot, very well
known, design'd to blast the Reputation of a Set of People,
the best affected to the Sovereign, and to the trite Interest of
their Nation, that ever</HI> Scotland <HI>bred.</HI> What my Opinion
was with Relation to the Succession is very well known
also, I lookt upon Limitations with another Eye, than
some others were pleased to do, I was far from Treat∣ing
them in Ridicule; Because as all Human
Affairs, they are lyable to Alterations, and might be
taken off: that Argument proves too much, and Con∣sequently
proves nothing at all. Should a Man refuse
to have a good Estate settled upon him, because he
may squander it away, and become Bankrupt? Must a
Good Law be refused, because it may afterwards be Re∣pealed?
No, <HI>My Lord,</HI> Where the Power is lodged in
our selves, we have all Human Security Imaginable for
the Thing; It is not so, where the Power is lodged in
others: therefore I shall alwise Choose that Security,
which depends upon my self, preferable to any other.</P>
<P>“This, <HI>My Lord,</HI> hath Confirmed me. That Limitati∣ons
of our own making is the best Security; tho I alwise
thought them not the Full, of what we merited, for the
going into the <HI>English</HI> Succession. For Confidering the
Injuries, that we have received from them, we ought to
have Reparation upon this Emergent: and I think with
out Incorporating with them, they might have given us
some small Incouragement in our Trade with them,
which would have been profitable unto us, and no man∣ner
of way prejudicial unto them, as I can clearly Demon∣strate,
if there be Occasion for it; But since this is not
the proper Place nor Season for such Proposals, I shall go
in with the Proposal made by the Marquis of <HI>Annan∣dale</HI>
and fortified by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton:</HI>
because I think, it is the best that we can make of it at
this time, the fittest Measure to prevent Civil Wars, a allay
the Ferment of the Nation, and far preferable to <HI>this In∣corporating
Union,</HI> which <HI>as to us in all it's Clanses ap∣pears
to be most Unreasonable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="368"/>
“This was a Politick Speech, there appeared some ill Nature
in it, &amp; a great deal of Satyre upon the Union, but that was the
Temper of the Times, and must be past over on that account;
nor mail I say any thing to it here, the Noble Person that
made it, acquiesced in the Union freely enough when it was
made; as shall appear in its place.</P>
<P>“But I can not pass it over without observing, That
—this Speech gives Light into several Things; <HI>First,</HI> It
gives a hint at the Suggestion that had been made of D—H—s,
aiming at his own Title in all his former Oppositi∣on
made against the Succession, as well formerly as now, and
clears that Noble Person from all supposition of such a thing,
by his having offered now to come into the Succession.</P>
<P>“Secondly, It gives a true sight of the genuine Reason of all
this sudden Complyance with the Succession, a Thing which
had something very surprizing in if, and which, some
thought, must have presently carried abundance of People
from the other Party, the Design being, as was afterward
publickly own'd, <HI>if possible, to Evade the passing this Article, as
a Branch of the Union.</HI> The Case was, They were content
with the Succession, as an Act of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
settled and Established in the Form, necessary in that Cafe;
but they would not have the Succession brought upon them
as the Consequence of the Union.</P>
<P>“And at last, they had this at the Bottom of it all, That if
the Succession had been taken, <HI>as it was now offered,</HI> it must
have been taken in stead of the Union, and that bad answe∣red
the present Occasion, <HI>viz. Diverting the Grand Affair</HI> of
the Union.</P>
<P>“But they met with a double Disappointment in this, First,
As to offering the Succession in stead of the Union, they came
too late, since the Party who were for the Succession formerly
with Limitations, were now come into the Union, as the
best Scheme of Limitations they could ever hope to attain,
and would not go back, finding the Union a better Scheme
of Limitation than their own, because it Entitled them to
all the Limitations already settled in <HI>England,</HI> which they
could not but allow, were more and better than any they had
proposed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or than indeed they could expect to
obtain.</P>
<P>“<HI>Secondly,</HI> They were disappointed in <HI>the way,</HI> for the
<HI>Jacobites who held with them before</HI> in Opposing the Union,
<HI>broke with them here,</HI> since they found themselves abandon'd
by them in the main Article for which they opposed the Uni∣on,
<HI>viz.</HI> The Transposing the Crown, as they called if, from
the Son of the late King <HI>James;</HI> and if they were obliged to
quite the Article of the Succession, the rest was indifferent to
than.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="369"/>
“And therefore you find the Protest at the End of the Vote of
this Day, was directly against the Union, tho' it was put <HI>in the
usual form,</HI> of the former Article of Limita ions; so these things
did bur increase the Division, and weaken the Party that Op∣posed
the Union, and by that means gave the more Room
for those who were for the Onion, to carry it; And <HI>thus the
Second Article past,</HI> which concluded the Settlement of the
Protestant Succession. And it was to be observed, that the
settling this Article was very satisfactory to abundance of
People, who were otherwise not very well reconciled to the
Treaty, and gave a Handle to the Friends of the Union, to
bring some People to a clearer sight of their Interest, since
they might see the Union was the readiest way, <HI>and perhaps
the only way,</HI> to obtain the Protestant Succession, and to se∣cure
it upon the firmest Foundation, and on the best Limi∣tations,
a Thing which had been long wish'd, and very much
struggled for before.</P>

<P>Whereupon it was moved that the agreeing to the third Article

not be binding or have any effect, unless Terms 2nd Conditions of
an Union of the two Kingdoms, and particularly the Constitution

<P>Moved also to proceed to the confederation of the fourth and
other Articles of Union before the third.</P>
<P>And after some Reasoning thereupon, It was put to the Vote,
proceed to the Consideration of the third Article in the Terms of
the above Motion relating thereto, or proceed to the fourth Ar∣ticle;
and it carried, proceed to the third.</P>
<P>And accordingly the Parliament proceeded to the confederation
of the third Article; And after long Debate thereupon, a Vole was
stated, Approve of the third Article in the Terms of the above
Motion relating thereto, <HI>yea or not.</HI></P>
<P>But before Voting, the Marquess of <HI>Annandale</HI> gave in a Protest,
upon the Foot of his former Resolve presented to this House, and
contained in the Minute of the 4th of <HI>November</HI> instant, and craved
that the Narrative thereof might be prefixed thereto, and which
Narrative and Protest, is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> “Whereas it evidently
appears, since the Printing, Publishing and Considering of the Ar∣ticles
of Treaty now before this House. This Nation, seems Ge∣nerally
averse to this Incorporating Union, in the Terms now be∣fore
us, as subversive of the Sovereignty, Fundamental Constituti∣on
and Claim of Right of this Kingdom, and as threatening Ruine
to this Church as by Law Established.</P>
<P>“And since it is plain, that if an Union were agreed to in those
Terms by this Parliament, and accepted of by the Parliament of
England' it would in no fort answer the peaceable and friendly
ends proposed by an Union; But would on the contrair create
such dismal Distractions and Animosities amongst our selves, and
such Jealousies and Mistakes betwixt us and our Neighbours, as
would involve these Nations into fatal Breaches and Confusions.</P>
<P>“Therefore I do protest for my self, and in Name of all those
who shall adhere to this my Protestation, That an Incorporating
Union of the Crown and Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the Crown
and Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and that both Nations shall be Repre∣sented
by one and the same Parliament, as contained in the Articles
of the Treaty of Union, is contrair to the Honour, Interest, Fun∣damental
Laws and Constitutions of this Kingdom, is a giving up
of the Sovereignty, the Birth-Right of the Peers, the Rights and
Privileges of the Barons and Burrows, at is contrair to the <HI>Claim of
Right,</HI> Property and Liberty at the Subjects, and third Act of Her
Majesties Parliament 1703, by which it is declared high Treason
in any of the Subjects of this Kingdom, to Quarrel, or endeavour
by Writing, Malicious and advised Speaking, or other open Act
or Deed, to alter or innovate the <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> or any Article
thereof: As also, That the Subjects of this Kingdom, by surren∣dering
their Parliaments and Sovereignty, are deprived of all Se∣curity,
both with respect to such Rights, as are by the intended
Treaty stipulated and agreed, and with respect to such other Rights,
both Ecclesiastick and Civil, as are by the same Treaty pretended
<PB N="71" REF="371"/>
to be reserved to them. And therefore I do protest, that this shall
not prejudge the Beeing of future <HI>Scots</HI> Parliaments and Conventi∣ons
within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> at no time coming.</P>
<P>After Reading whereof, he took Instruments thereupon, and it
was agreed, That, at calling the Rolls, the Adherers to the above
Protest should be so marked; And also, That the hail Members be
marked as they shall Vote. <HI>Approve</HI> or <HI>Not,</HI> and that a List of their
Names, as they shall Vote <HI>Pro or Con,</HI> shall be printed. And the
Lord Chancellor was allowed to have his Name Printed and Record∣ed
as an Approver.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Parliament were all this while Debating the Gene∣rals
of the Treaty, and therefore the Debates were also in
general: The Work of this Day was not at all debating
what Number of Members should be the Proportion of the
Parliament, or how, or in what manner they should be cho∣sen,
and the like; but whether <HI>Britain,</HI> as now to be Unit∣ed
should be Represented by one and the same parliament,
yea or no.</P>
<P>“The Debates were very long upon this Head; And as,
in other Cases, it had, for some Days, taken up part of their
Time, in Reading the long Addresses of Shires, Burghs and
<PB N="72" REF="372"/>
Parishes against the Union; so, on this Day, there were,
some very particular ones reserved, and which seemed to be
calculated for the Day, in which, according to the Popular
Arguments of the Time, the Union was called a Surrendering
the Sovereignty of Scotland to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>“I could never indeed see any Schemes offered, or learn
that there was any such Proposal, in what manner those that
were for reserving the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would have
formed two separate Parliaments in an United Kingdom;
so that the Debates of this Day were not of what should be,
but of what should not be; and the Uniting the Parliament
was objected against, but without offering an Alternative of
what they would have in the Room of it.</P>
<P>“The principal Arguments made use of in this Days Debate
were,</P>
<P>1. That Uniting the Parliament, was actually giving
up the Constitution of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>2. That it was subjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>3. That it was dangerous to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
whose Government was to be subjected to a Parliament of
Episcopal Members.</P>
<P>4. That it was contrary to the National Oath or Cove∣nant.</P>
<P>“It is not my Design to make Arguments of my own, in
order to answer them, or to make this History a Dispute,
instead of a Relation of Fact—: But there having been
such loud Clamours against the Union in general, and such
Violent Struggles against it in Parliament, it may not be in∣consistent
with an History, to relate the Foundation on either
side which they acted upon, and as much of the Argument
on both side?, either <HI>within</HI> the House or <HI>without,</HI> as is useful
to let the Reader into a true Understanding of the Transcti∣ons
of this Critical Time; and for this Reason I have divid∣ed
this Part into the Minutes and Observations, the one is
perfectly Historical, the other Explanatory of the Particulars,
and I hope I need make no more Apology for the Method.</P>
<P>“Ist, It was alledged, That this Conjunction of Par∣liaments
was a giving up the Constitution; Or, as it
was frequently Worded in their printed Addresses, sur∣rendering
the Sovereignty and Independency of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P>“It was answered, This was from a Defect in the com∣mon
Acceptation of the Word UNION, as it was now
Treating of, and of its full Extent—of the Unions
being CENTERAL and UNIVERSAL; in which it
was alledged, That the Union now Treating of was, in
the utmost possible Meaning of the Word, comprehen∣five
of every Good to both; exclusive of all manner of
Preference or Disparity of Parts, abhorring all things In∣jurious
<PB N="73" REF="373"/>
or Diminishing to either; a full Coalition, a
general Incorporation of Nations, of Interests, of
Power, and of Safety:—A Sameness of Circumstan∣ces
and of Sympathies; becoming one and the same
Body, with one and the same Head, Life, Soul, Nutri∣ment,
Point and Period; an Union of the very SOUL
OF THE NATION, all its Constitution, Customs,
Trade and Manners, must be blended together, digest∣ed
and concocted, for the mutual United, Undistinguish'd
Good, Growth and Health of the one whole United
Body; and that all the Suggestions of subjecting
or surrendering one part to another, were owing
to the want of a right Conception, both of the Terms
and of the Thing designed by the Term UNION.</P>
<P>“It was urged further That this extended Signification
of the Union excluded all possibility of a Separation of
Interests, or Claming of Properties, and that mutual
Protection, mutual Increase, mutual Improvements were
the Consequences to be expected, not from this or that
Circumstance, Policy or Management, but from the
Nature of the Thing.</P>
<P>“One may be sure these things were warmly argued within
Doors, when without, the People were an the utmost Fermen∣tation,
and the whole Nation seemed as in an Agony, the
Enemies of the Union went about Bemoaning <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
Sighing, as they called it, for the Dying Constitution, and
a Noble Lord within, standing up to make a Speech on this
Occasion, but being stop'd by the Order of the Day, said
Mournfully, It was hard he could not be allowed to speak
one Word for their Dying Country—; These and the like
Speeches had put the People in the last Degree of Concern.</P>
<P>“The Capital Arguments made use of on this Occasion,
and made Popular against the Uniting the Parliaments,
were such as these,</P>
<P>1. That whatever Agreement is now concluded between
the two Kingdoms, will never he binding to the New
Parliament.</P>
<P>2. That the two Kingdoms effectually subject them∣selves
to the New Parliament, all the Conditions stipu∣lated
on either side to the contrary in any wise notwith∣standing.</P>
<P>“To this it was Answered, That the <HI>British</HI> Parliament were
absolutely bound up by the Stipulations of this Treaty, that
they being a subsequent Power to the two respective Parlia∣ments
of cither Kingdom, had no other or further Power to
act, than was Limited them by the Stipulations of both King∣doms;
That all subsequent Power is inferior in its Extent to
the Power which it derives from; That the Parliament of
<HI>Britain</HI> being the Creature of the. Union, formed by ex∣press
<PB N="74" REF="374"/>
Stipulations between the two separate Parliaments of <HI>En∣gland
&amp; Scotland</HI> cannot bat be unalterably bound by the Con∣ditions
so stipulated, and upon which it received its Beeing,
Name and Authority; The Foundation of a British Parlia∣ment,
is this Treaty; to say, They will <HI>not</HI> be bound by it, is to
say, they will pull themselves up by the Roots: they dye when
the Union receives any mortal Wound; they cannot infringe
one Article of the Union; they cannot put a Question in the
House upon any one Article.</P>
<P>“As to the Objection, That there was a Surrender of So∣vereignty
and Constitution, and delivering <HI>Scotland</HI> bound
Hand and Foot into the absolute Dispose of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>“This was Answered by way of Question and Answer, a∣mong
other Things thus,</P>
<P>“Q. What is it constitutes the Parliament of <HI>Britain?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>The Union.</HI> Let any Man give another Answer to it,
if he can.</P>
<P>“Q. Bow is it constituted?</P>
<P>A. <HI>By Treaty</HI> between two Nations by their Heads and
Representatives, <HI>viz.</HI> the Queen and Parliament of each
Kingdom.</P>
<P>“Q. How do they bring it to pass?</P>
<P>“A. By mutual altering their respective Constitutions,
and forming one general Constitution upon a Treaty of
Equalities and Equivalents; the Stipulations of which Trea∣ty
are agreed to by the Constituent Parts of the subsequent
Body.</P>
<P>Q. Upon what Right doth the present respective Parliaments
depend?</P>
<P>A. The Natural Right of the Free-holders of both King∣doms
which entitles them by the Possession of their Lands,
to have the free Exercise and Power of making the Laws by
which they are to be governed.</P>
<P>Q. Does this new Constitution destroy that Right?</P>
<P>A. Not at all, but reserving that Right, which indeed
it cannot destroy, agrees to limit the Exercise of it by such
and such Forms, and on such and such Conditions, which
Conditions are the Limitations of the Power of the new Par∣liament,
as being the Aft and Deed of the old Parliaments,
whose Coustitution was founded on Original Right.</P>
<P><HI>The next Popular Argument, &amp; which took up much of
the Debates at this Day, was, That</HI> the Parliament bad not a Power
to go into this Union; <HI>Or, as it was Worded in the publick Ad∣dresses,</HI>
That 'tis not in the Power of the <HI>Scots</HI> Government to con∣clued
such an Union, without a manitest Violation of Trust, and With∣out
doing a manifest Act of Injustice, Qppression and Usurpation a∣gainst
the Fundamental Rights and Liberties of this Free Kingdom;
and this was the Substance of most of the Addresses present.
ed to the Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="375"/>
“This was Answered by Enquiring into the Right Parlia∣ments
had to Lessen, Enlarge, or Limit the Representative; of
which when the Number of Members comes to be Treated of.</P>
<P>“The last Argument, and which indeed was made more use
of without Doors than within, was the Danger to the Church
Government of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Uniting the Representative;
in which it was argued,</P>
<P>1. That the <HI>British</HI> Parliament being chiefly Com∣posed
of Persons of another Communion, might, when
ever they pleased, by a Majority of Votes overpowering
the <HI>Scots,</HI> Overthrow their Church, introduce Episco∣pacy,
and reduce the Presbyterians to a Toleration, or
perhaps worse.</P>
<P>2. That there being twenty six <HI>English</HI> Bishops sitting
in the House of Peers, and who were by this Treaty to
continue sitting there; this was subjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> in
all its future Laws, to the suffrage of Bishops, and by
consenting to the Treaty in which they were Established,
it was Recognizing and Establishing Episcopacy, which
was to involve the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> in National
Perjury, they being obliged by the National Covenant,
never to subject themselves to Episcopacy, but to their
power to Reform the Churches of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>“These Suggestions indeed had but too much Success
Abroad, and were the principal Subject of the several Ad∣dresses,
some of which the Reader may fee in the Appendix,
as a Sample of the rest.</P>
<P>“The Arguments had their particular Answers, too long to
insert here, and are Touch'd in another part of this Work, the
general Answer is contained in the former Paragraphs, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Obligation of the future Parliament to the exact Observation
of the Treaty, in which the Security of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>
was particularly provided for, and left Unalterable for ever
—A Security so firm as the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> never
enjoyed before from any Civil Government, or Humane Au∣thority
in the Worlds.</P>
<P>“As to the Objection about the Covenant, it was indeed
mentioned in most of the Addresses, but it was never menti∣oned
in Parliament at all; or at least, not so as to come to
any Debate, or to put any Question upon it; and therefore
I refer it to its proper place.</P>
<P>“There were several long Speeches made on this Article,
someto shew, that it was nor in their power to Vote upon
it at all, without Consulting Constituents, that the Parliament
was a Fundamental of Government, and could not be so
much as altered, much less given up—, and that this
Treay was an entire Surrender of the Constitution. It would
take up too much Room in this Work, to repeat all the Argu∣ments
brought on this Head or to insert the Speeches that were
<PB N="76" REF="376"/>
made much more to Collect the Arguments brought by way
of Answer—; But as the following Speech was made on this
day, and seems to be a full Answer to the Main of these Ob∣jections,
I could not omit it, as it was spoken by a Gentle∣man
eminently concerned, both in the present Debate, and
in the Treaty at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>A Speech in Parliament spoken Ly Mr. Seton
junior of Pitmedden November 18 1706,
upon the Subject of the third Article then
being in Debate in the Honse.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord Chancellor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“Having heard with much Attention the third Ar∣ticle
Debated; I find it lyable with the other Articles of
this Treaty, to be put in a false or true Light by the
Speakers to it, in proportion to those Notions they have
of the Nature of this Union: What I am to say con∣cerning
it, shall be to remove some Objections, which
in my Opinion is the proper Method to smooth the way
for approving it.</P>
<P>“The principal Objections are; That the Representa∣tives
for Shires and Burghs, cannot legally approve this
'Article, without the Assent of their Constituments; and
that by the approbation of it, the Sovereignty and In∣dependency
of this Kingdom, will be surreudered to
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“My Lord, To give a distinct and convincing Answer
to the first Objection, let us look a little to the Nature
of our Constitution of Government</P>
<P>“Our Government is not a Polish Aristocracy, founded
on <HI>Pacta Conventa,</HI> whereby all the Gentry are Im∣powered
in their particular Meetings, to prescribe Rules
to their Representatives in a General Dyet.</P>
<P>Our Government is not a common Democracy, where-by
every Subject of <HI>Scotland</HI> may claim a Vote in the
Legislature.</P>
<P>“Our Government is and has been many Ages past,
a Limited Monarchy, wherein the Sovereign and Re∣presentative
are the only Judges of every thing which
does contribute to the Happiness of the Body Politick,
and from whom no Appeal can legally be made; and
this Des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iption is agreeable to Reason, to our Law, and
to our History.</P>
<P>“Reason teaches us, that <HI>Anarchy</HI> is destructive to
Mankind, and that no Society of People can be well
<PB N="77" REF="377"/>
Governed without a Supreme Power, whose proceedings
are only alterable by it selt; <HI>Grotius</HI> says (L. I. C. 3.
§. 7.) That we call the Supreme Power, whose Acts are
not subject to the Power of another.</P>
<P>Our Law is positive, that this Supreme Court is subjesct
to no Humane Authority, <HI>Act 130. P.</HI> 8. J. &amp; &amp; we learn
from our History, that the greatest Alterations have been
made in the Constitution of our Government, without
Coasulting the People: out of which I humbly offer a
sew Examples: In the Reign of <HI>Kenneth</HI> the 3d the
Monarchy that Originally was Elective, became Heredi∣tary:
In the Reign of <HI>James</HI> 6th the Representation of
the Clergy in Parliament was restored: In the Reign of
<HI>Charles</HI> the ad the Prerogative was exalted above its
natural Level; and in she year 1698, the King was
Dethroned, and the Clergy Expelled this House.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> I have heard asserred, that there are Fundamen∣tals
of Government which cannot be altered by this House,
without the Consent of every <HI>Scotsman:</HI> But where
were these stipulated? Where are they Recorded? Were
these made by our Forefathers' at the first Institution of
their Government, and have all succeeding Parliaments
Sworn to their Observance? These Questions, Methinks,
deserve our Consideration, before it be asserted what is
an unalterable Fundamental by this House.</P>
<P>“As to the Arguments of Sir <HI>Gevrge Mackenzie,</HI> and
other eminent Lawyers, brought upon the Stage to sup∣port
this Notion of Fundamentals; I think they require
no particular Answer, because any Member who under∣stands
the Nature of Government may see clearly, that
these Arguments are founded on Roman Laws Cal∣culated
for People, as Members of private Societies, and
not for perpetual Rules to the Supreme Power of any
Nation.</P>
<P>In fine, I believe there are no Fundamentals of Go∣verment
in any Nation, which are not alterable by its
Supreme Power, when the Circumstances of Times re∣quire;
and whoever is acquainted with History may
learn, that there are no People at present in <HI>Europe,</HI>
which in different Ages have not suffred variety of
Changes in Government. I do indeed acknowledge, there
are Fundamentals in Nature to wit Liberty and Property,
which this House can never destroy, without exceeding
its outmost Bounds of Power, that are always limited to
the Publick Good Nevertheless this Honourable House
is only capable to Judge of the; most proper Means of
securing these Fundamentals: And for my part I sin∣cerely
believe that no judicious Man will say, There is
the least danger of our Liberty and property by an Uni∣on
<PB N="78" REF="378"/>
of Parliaments, when he Reflects that the People of
England, have been in all Ages Noble Asserters of the
Rights of the Subject have spent much Blood and Trea∣sure
in Desence of the Liberties of their Neighbours, and
that after this Union, Encroachments on the Rights of
the Subjects of any part of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> must endanger
the Liberty of the whole.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> I come now to the next Objection, That by
the Approbation of this Article, we Surrender the So∣vereignty
and Independency of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>“These words 1 acknowledge are very long, and may
found Harmoniusly in the Ears of the Populace: for my
part, I would be sorry just now to have occasion to say,
that in Fad our Supremacy and Independency were Sur∣rendered
the day King <HI>James</HI> got possession of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Throne, if at the same time I could not affirm, that
these are again restored to us by this Treaty, which was
managed with a Decorum &amp; Equality, that became two In∣dependent
and distinct Nations; and not after such a Clan∣destine
manner as was used by Queen <HI>Mary &amp;</HI> the <HI>French,</HI>
the 4th of <HI>April</HI> 1554, on which day our Sovereignty
was indeed surrendered, as may be seen in the <HI>Recueil de
Traitez,</HI> Sec. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 510.</P>
<P>“But to put this Question above Controversie, I con∣ceive
two ways only whereby a Free Nation loses its
Sovereignty and Independency, which are Conquest,
and a voluntar Surrender of its Rights to another Nation,
without any Reservation.</P>
<P>“I am sure no person in right Judgment will alledge,
That this intended Union is a Conquest; Nor can it be
called a Surrender, seeing the Treaty contains certain and
distinct Reservations to both Kingdoms: Nor can I
comprehend how cither of two Nations, by an entire
Union, surrenders its Privileges: on the contrair, I agree
with the learned <HI>Grotius</HI> (L. 2. C. 9. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 9—.) who's
Opinion is, That the Rights and Privileges of two distinct
Nations United, ate consolidated into one, by a mutual
Communication of them.</P>
<P>“Another Objection, <HI>My Lord,</HI> has been moved against
this Article, which belongs more properly to the 22d
Article, and that's concerning the Number of the Repre∣sentatives
from Scotland, to a Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI>
This Objection I'll endeavour to Answer in as sew words
as the Nature of it will allow.</P>
<P>“If both Nations are to be represented by one Parlia∣ment,
there must be Members from both Nations, and
their Numbers must he adjusted by Ionic Rule, which can
be no other than that Fundamental in the Union of all
Societies, whereby Suffrage arc computed to wit, the
<PB N="79" REF="379"/>
Proportion each Society contributes for the support of the
whole: Now, the Union of Scotland and <HI>England</HI> is but
the Union of two great Societies of People, into one Body
Politick; So that we have nothing to direct our Forming
a true Notion about the Number of the Representative
agreed to by this Treaty, on the part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but
the Proportion we are able to contribute for the support
of the Government of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that has respect
to the Numbers of our People, to the Extent of our
Taxes, or to an Arithmetical proportion betwixt these,
and those of <HI>England;</HI> All which being duly considered,
I may be bold to Affirm, that the Representative agreed
to by the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> is more than falls
to our Share.</P>
<P>“Several Authors, who have wrote about the Nature
of Society, or the Union of two or more Societies, a∣gree
to this Fundamental; and <HI>Grotius</HI> (L. 2. C. 5. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
22.) has two Examples out of <HI>Strabo</HI> relating to it;
One is, When <HI>Lybica</HI> United with Three Neighbouring
Cities, It was stipulated, That each of the Three was
to have one Voice, but <HI>Lybica</HI> Two, because it contri∣buted
much more to the common Benefits, than any of
the rest: The other Example is, That there were 23
Cities in Licia United, whereof some had three Voices,
some two, and some but one.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> By the Representative of Sixteen for the
Nobility, there's no greater Hardship put upon them, than
was put upon the small Barons in the Reign of King
<HI>James</HI> the First, who then were of the same State with
the Nobility, and subinitted to the Law for Conveni∣ency.</P>
<P>“By the Representative of Fourty Five for the Commons,
no prejudice is done to the State of Barons in respect of
Representation; for if they be Represented from every
Shire, or at least from the most considerable Shires, 'tis
of no Import, whether every Shire be Represented by
one or more: And as to the Stare of Burrows, I'll pre∣sume
to say, That the Retrenchment of their Repre∣sentation
is a Piece of Justice done to this Nation, if
Property or Taxes be the Rule of Representation.</P>
<P>“<HI>My Lord,</HI> So far have I endeavoured to Answer the
material Objections against this Article, not out of any
Prospect to convince the Members against this Union,
as to fortifie the Judgments of those for it; And I wish
heartily. That the Constituents for Shires and Burghs
may have a true Confidence in their Representatives,
while they are Accomplishing this Great and Noble
Work of an Union of both Kingdoms, especially consi∣dering.
That they are bound by Oath to give their best
<PB N="80" REF="380"/>
Advices and Suffrages; That they were chosen by
themselves in a tree Election; That they have their
Families and Estates among 'em; That the same Li∣berty,
Property and Religion are common to 'em both;
And that the Good or Bad Consequences of this Uni∣on,
mull equally affect Representatives and Conistitu∣ents.</P>
<P>“THIS SPEECH was received with great Satisfaction and
Applause, and the Arguments in it were so clear, especially
as to the Proportions of the Representative, that it was very
useful, when that Head came to be debated; and I cannot
bat think the Reader will think his Time well bestowed in
Reading it, in that he will see by it, whether the Union
was carryed by Strength of Reasoning, or, as some alledged,
cram'd down their Throats by meet Number of Voices.</P>
<P>“The Debates held very long, but at length the Question
being proposed, the Vote was carried with the usual <HI>Provi∣so,
viz. That it be of no Force if all be not Concluded;</HI> and the
dissenting Members protested, as you will see in the Minutes.
And so this mighty Case was also Determined.</P>

<HEAD>MINUTE XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tuesday 19. November 1706.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Prayer Said;
Rolls Called,</OPENER>
<P>The Lord Chancellor acquainted the Parliament, that last Night
his Grace Her Majesties High Commissioner, in his Return to the
Palace, was Insulted by a Number of People of the meanest Degree
with Stones, which was an high Affront both to Her Majesties High
Commissioner, and to the Parliament; And therefore moved, that
the Parliament may give the necessary Orders, not only to find out
such as have been guilty as Actors or Abettors therein, but to pre∣vent
the like in time coming; and alter some Reasoning on the
said Representation and Motion:</P>
<P>It was agreed, to Remit to the Committee Nominate for Examin∣ing
the Calculation of the Equivalent, to enquire into the Matter of
this Intuit; And to endeavour to find out the Actors and Abettors,
if any be, with Power to the said Committee to promise Indemnities
and Rewards for Discoveries, and to Seize and Imprison any Person
whom they shall have ground to suspect to be guilty, as Actors or Abet∣tors,
&amp; to call for the Magistrates &amp; Neighbours of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for In∣formation,
and to Report to the Parliament, what Information and
Discovery they shall make of the said Insult, or of any former. As
<PB N="81" REF="381"/>
also, to Report their Opinion, what Measures may be proper for
preventing the like in time coming, and the Committee appointed
to meet the first Interval Day of Parliament at nine of the Clock.</P>
<P>The Parliament did like ways Recommend to the Cord High Con∣stable
to prosecute forthwith these Persons, who were Imprisoned
on Account of a former Tumult, and ordained the Magistrates of
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> to furnish what Probation they can, to she Fiscal of the
Constables Court, against such as were so Imprisoned.</P>
<P>Address of the Baillie?, Counsellours and Citizens of Sr. <HI>Andrews,</HI>
Subscribers of the same, against: an Union with <HI>England,</HI> in the Terms
of the Article?, given in and Read.</P>
<P>Thereafter it was moved. That the Parliament proceed to the
Fourth Article of Union.</P>
<P>Moved also, That, before proceeding to the Consideration of the
Fourth Article, a Clause be added to the Third Article in thir Terms,
And that the said Parliament of Great-Britain <HI>shall meet and sit once
in Three Tears at least, in that Part of Great-Britain nave called</HI>
Scotland.</P>
<P>And after some Debate thereupon, the Consideration of the said
Additional Clause delayed, till the Parliament come to the Twenty
Second Article.</P>
<P>Then the Fourth Article of Union was Read, and after some
Discourse thereupon, the further Consideration thereof was delayed
till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament, and the Consideration thereof
to be then resumed previous to all other Business.</P>
<P>Adjourned till Thursday next at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Affairs of Tumult and Clamour from the Street, I have
related in its proper place; yet, as far as it came to be con∣sidered
in Parliament, I must take notice of it here, but Shall
be the briefer, referring to what is said elsewhere.</P>
<P>“The first Rabble had been crush'd for some time, <HI>as bas
been observed already,</HI> and the Vigilance of the Government
had secured the Parliament hitherto; But the Inveterate Fu∣ry
of the poor ignorant People, imposed upon by the Popu∣lar
Arguments of the Times, and these enlarged upon by the
various Pamphlets and Speeches against the Union, which
were spread amongst them, was very hard to be restrained.</P>
<P>“The Duke of Queensberry, the Queens High Commissioner,
received divers Affronts in his going to and from the Parlia∣ment,
tho' his Grace did not think worth his while to trouble
the Parliament with it, while it was any thing tolerable;
But it was now grown to that Height, That not only the
Commissioners Life was in Danger, but the Publick l'cace
seemed manifestly aimed at, and it was very necessary to put
a Check to Such Intuits, left the whole might be endangered.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="382"/>
The High Commissioner had received several private
Intimations of Designs to assasinate him, and several Letters,
some abusive and threatning, others pretending to give him
Caution to preserve his Person, others directly pretending to
inform of the Designs, the Time when, Manner how, and
Weapons by which he was to be Murdered; whether these
were real Designs or only Attempts to amuse, and perhaps
discourage his Grace in the Discharge of his Duty in so
weighty a Work, was, I believe, never certainly known: But
whoever will calmly confider the Temper of the People at
that time, how inslamed by the Artifice of a Party, and how
frequently they shew'd their Readiness to have undertaken
any Thing, tho' never so desperate, to have broken off this
Affair, will wonder, That no Agent of Satan was found
hardned enough to have committed that, or any like sort of
Villany.</P>
<P>Nor did it seem that there was any thing wanting, but
the meet Courage to venture their Lives in such a Bloody
Action, since, in the Occasion which was now brought be∣fore
the House, it appeared there were Stones thrown at the
Commissioners Coach from the Tops of Houses, sufficient to
have Murdered him, if Providence had not more especially
protected both his Person, and the Affair in Hand; which,
had any such Villany been perpetrated, would, most certainly,
have all been lost in the necessary Confusions that must have
followed.</P>
<P>“For the Readers particular Information of the Temper and
Humour of the People at that time, some of the Threatning
Letters sent to his Grace the High Gommissioner, are Printed
in the Appendix N. G xx. faithfully Transcribed from the
Original.</P>
<P>“As to the manner of the present Insult offered the Com∣missioner
—, it was thus, Opportunity was taken, upon the
length of the Debates that Day, which keeping the House late
—, and the Lord Commissioner being to pass the Streets in
the Night, the whole length of the City from the Parliament
House to the Palace, the Mob took the opportunity of the
Darkness, a Time proper for such Villanies; First they affronted
the Guards, and followed them with Curses and Opprobri∣ous
Words, and their Numbers increasing as they went on,
they began to throw Stones at them, which occasioned some
little Disorder among the Horses, and this at last encreased to
the throwing Stones at the Commissioner himself, one of
which narrowly miss'd his Person.</P>
<P>“The Coachman and Postilion, whether <HI>frighted themselves,</HI>
or that the Horses were unruly, drove a little faster than
usual down the Street, which put the Guards to a full Trot;
and that heartening the Rabble, as it the Guards had fled
from them, they Shouted and continued pursuing them with
<PB N="83" REF="383"/>
Dirt, Stones, and such sort of Violence, till they came to the
Palace, where the Foot Guards received them, and kept Off
the Croud.</P>
<P>“Every Body will allow, that considers these Circumstances,
which I was an Eye Witness to, That it was time to put a
Stop to this Violence, and to restrain a Head-strong Multi∣tude
thus made; Bold and Furious, lest they should, <HI>as in such
Cases is hot uncommon,</HI> run on to more violent Extremes;
and therefore the Lord Commissioner ordered the Lord Chan∣cellor
to Represent it to the House, as in the Vote.</P>
<P>“The Motion for the Parliament sitting once in Three Years
was needless, for that indeed it was settled in the Twenty
Second Article for the First Parliament, and established in
<HI>England</HI> by other Laws made there, which were to continue
in Force by the Treaty.</P>

<HI>England</HI> in the Terms of the Articles, given in and Read.</P>
<P>The Fourth Article of Union again Read.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was moved to take the several Branches of Trade;
to be communicate, into Consideration, that it may thereby appear
how far the Communication of Trade shall be advantageous; And
after Reasoning thereupon,</P>
<P>The Vote was stated, Approve of the Fourth Article, Reserving
the Consideration of the several Branches of Trade, till the Parlia∣ment
come to the subsequent Articles, <HI>yea or not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And it was agreed,</HI> That the Members shall be Marked, as they

<P>Then the Vote was put <HI>Approve or not,</HI> and it carried <HI>Approve.</HI></P>
<P>Thereafter the Fifth Article of Union was Read, whereupon a
Proposal was given in for Explaining and Inlarging the same in
these Term, <HI>That all Ships or Vessels belonging to Her Majesties Sub∣jects
of</HI> Scotland, at the time of Ratifying the Treaty of Union of the Two
Kingdoms in the Parliament of Scotland, though Foreign Built, shall
be deemed and pass as Ships of the Build of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the Owner,
or where there are more Owners, one or moe of the Owners, within twelve
Months after the Union, making Oath, I hat, at the time of Ratifying
the Treaty of Union in the Parliament of Scotland, the same did, in
hail, or in part, belong to him or them, or to same other Subject or Sub∣jects
<PB N="84" REF="384"/>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be particularly named with the place of their re∣spective
Abodes, and that the same doth them, at the time of the said De∣position,
wholly belong to him or them, and that no Foreigner directly or
indirectly bath any Share, Part or Interest therein.</P>
<P>Which being Read, it was moved, that six Months more time be
added to the time allowed by the Proposal, for purchasing Ships
or Vessels: And after some Reasoning thereupon, the further con∣sideradon
thereof was delayed till next Sederuut of Parliament, to
be then Returned, previous to all other Business.</P>
<P>Adjourned till Saturday next at ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>“This Article being General, but containing several Parti∣culars,
it was judged proper to pass it in the gross first, with
a Reserve for such Clauses and Branches of Trade, as should
come into Consideration afterward; for otherwise these
Branches of Trade would have been foreclosed, by agreeing
to this Article in the full Extent of the Words.</P>
<P>“These Branches came all to be Considered in the Debating
other Articles, as particularly, when they came to Examine
the Affairs of Drawbacks, Bounties on Exportation, Prohibi∣tions,
and Restrictions in Trade, the several Customs, Duties,
Equalities and Proportions of Trade; Of which in their
Course.</P>
<P>“This Reserve, however, made the Article it self pass the
more readily at this Time, for it was the first Article after
Voting the Generals, that was Branched out into Particulars,
and therefore the Adjourning these Particulars was the more
acceptable.</P>
<P>“The Debate of the Fifth Article lay only here, the Treaters
had Debated about the Time limited for allowing the Ships
then in the Hands of the <HI>Scots,</HI> to be free Ships, the <HI>Scott</HI>
Commissioners would have had it been the Time of Ratify∣ing
the Union; The <HI>English</HI> Commissioners insisted on it, that
it should be the Time of Signing the Treaty; and the Reasons
were good, that otherwise People might buy multitudes of
Foreign Ships, and have time to furnish themselves, and pass
these Foreign Built Ships as free Bottoms, in the Terms of
the Act of Navigation, to the infinite Damage of the whole
Island; And this had the more Force with it, in that it could
not but be allowed, that it was the great Advantage of this
whole: Island, to encourage the Building, and consequently
the Employing our own Ships—. However, many popular
Arguments were used to lengthen out the Time, such as, That
<HI>Scotland</HI> was not yet in a Condition to Build, and that this
would check her Trade, to leave her naked of Ships till she
could furnish her selt with Materials for Building; that for
<PB N="85" REF="385"/>
the Fishing and East-Country Trade, it was absolutely neces∣sary
to furnish Foreign Built Ships, till <HI>Scotland</HI> could Build
for her self.</P>
<P>It was alledged, <HI>England</HI> could furnish Ships, and it was
so material a Thing to Encourage the Building, and Increase
of our own Shipping, that <HI>England</HI> would insist upon it, and
had reason so to do.</P>
<P>However, after long Debating, it was agreed, to lengthen
the Term to the Ratifying the Treaty; and this was the first
Alteration made in the Articles—; But it was referred to
the next day.</P>

Burgh of <HI>Innerkeithing subscribers of the same;</HI> all against an Uni∣on

<P>Thereafter the Fifth Article of Union again Read, with the Pro∣posal
for Amending, Explaining and Inlarging the same, insert in
the former Days Minutes, and altered thus, <HI>viz.</HI> That all Ships or
Vessels belonging to Her Majesties Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> at the time of
Ratifying the Treaty of Union of the two Kingdoms, in the Parliament
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho Foreign Built, be deemed and pass as Ships of the
Build of Great Britain, the Owners, or where there are more Owners, one
or more of the Owners within twelve Months after the first day of May
next, making Oath that at the time of Ratifying the Treaty of Union
in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the same did in hail or in part belong to
him or them, or to some other Subject or Subject of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to he par∣ticularly
Named, with the place of their respective Abodes, and that the
same doth then, at the time of the said Deposition, wholly belong to him
<PB N="86" REF="386"/>
or them, and that no Foreigner directly or indirectly bath any share,
part or interest therein.</P>
<P>And after some Reasoning thereon, there was a second Proposal
given in for the amending the Article in these Terms, <HI>That all Ships
and Vessels belonging to Her Majesties Subjects of</HI> Scotland <HI>at the time
of Ratifying the Treaty of Union of the two Kingdoms, in the Parlia∣ments
of both Kingdoms.</HI></P>
<P>And after some Debate the Vote was stated, Approve of the first
Paragraph of the Fifth Article, with the first Amendment or second;
And it carried Approve with the first Amendment.</P>
<P>Thereafter the rest of the said Fifth Article of Union was Read,
and a Proposal given in for adding a Clause in these Terms, “That
for the space of seven years from and after the Concluding the
Treaty of Union in both Kingdoms; It is expresly agreed, that
none of the Seamen or Mariners Aboard any of the Ships belong∣ing
to the Subjects of that part of United Britain, now called
<HI>Scotland,</HI> shall either at Home or Abroad be pressed from aboard
their said Ships, to serve in any of Her Majesties Ships of War or
Friggots; And in case after the said seven years, it shall happen
that there be a Levy of Seamen in United <HI>Britain,</HI> for serviitg in
the <HI>British</HI> Fleet, That the said part of United <HI>Britain,</HI> now cal∣led
<HI>Scotland</HI> shall only be burdened with such a proportion as our
Taxes bear, in proportion to that part of United Britain, now
called <HI>England,</HI> but prejudice to the Officers of Her Majesties Ships
or Fleet to engage as many Voluntar Seamen in their service as
they can agree with, in this part of United Britain, and this Ar∣ticle
to be unalterable by any subsequent <HI>British</HI> Parliament.”</P>
<P>Which being Read, after some reasoning thereupon, it was put
to the Vote, Add the second Clause or nor, and it carried not.</P>
<P>Thereafter the rest of the said fifth Article being again Read, the
Vote was put, Approve thereof or not, and it carried <HI>Approve.</HI></P>
<P>Adjourned till <HI>Tuesday</HI> next at ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXV.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debate about the admitting the <HI>Scots</HI> Ships as free
Bottoms, was now reassumed, and the Time limited for the
Properties to be made our, was altered from the Time of
Signing the Articles, to the Time of Ratifying the Treaty.</P>
<P>“The present Dispute was, Whether it should be the Time
of Ratifying the Treaty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the Ratification in both
Kingdoms—, this Article was Disputed by Inches, and some
thought, there was more Nicety used here, than was of any
Signification; and that therefore it seem'd the effect of a Ge∣neral
Struggle against the Union, where every thing was laid
hold on, that either might bring on some Alteration they
thought <HI>England</HI> could not comply with, or that at least
might but cause a Dispute in <HI>England,</HI> or that might so gain
<PB N="87" REF="387"/>
time, as to avoid having the thing Compleated in the then
sitting Parliament.</P>
<P>“It was well known, the <HI>English would be very tender of
their Act of Navigation,</HI> which is the Security of their Trade,
and the main Encourager of their Shipping, and the longer
this Liberty of purchasing Ships from the <HI>Dutch</HI> was extend∣ed,
the more Room there would be for Exceptions in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
their Trade being the more exposed to the bringing
in Foreign Bottoms among them.</P>
<P>And if it be true, as I have seen a Minute made of it in
Writing—, That the Party had prepared Schemes of Ob∣jections
to be offered in the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> against
the very Alterations which they themselves had procured to
be made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> If this be true, it will abundantly
justifie the general Supposition I have so often hinted at, <HI>viz.</HI>
That these Objections were rather calculated to delay the
Treaty, and overthrow the Union it self, than from any
particular Regard had to the Reason and Nature of the Thing
objected.</P>
<P>Nothing else could be the Occasion of such strong Struggles
for things in themselves not of any great Advantage to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
as in this Case of the Ships, of which, it may be noted,
That, after that Matter was settled, it was hardly known,
that one Ship was bought, either in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>England,</HI>
with the Design of making it Free, as was suggested.</P>
<P>“However, after long Debate, the middle Course was
taken, and the Time was extended from the Time of Signing
the Articles, as it was Agreed in <HI>London,</HI> to the Time of
Ratification in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland—,</HI> but not to
the Time of Ratification in both Parliaments, as was pro∣posed.</P>
<P>“The last Proposal against Pressing of Seamen, was a mani∣sest
Attempt of the kind above mentioned, and a seeking an
Occasion to interrupt the main Treaty, since no Body could
imagine, That such a Clause could have passed in <HI>England,</HI>
all their own Seamen having been lyable to be press'd into
the Service of the Navy; And both Nations being to enjoy
equal Privileges, this had been to put such a Disadvantage,
and such Inequalities upon the <HI>English;</HI> as would have made
just Complaints in England, and have been a sufficient Ob∣stacle
to the whole, especially when it was remembred, that
in <HI>Scotland</HI> there was no want of Seamen, but that on the
contrary many Thousands of their Seamen, for want of Em∣ployment,
entered themselves on Board the Men of War in
Foreign Service, with the <HI>Danes, Swedes,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders;</HI>
And it would be hard, That they should seek a Liberty from
the <HI>English</HI> Service, which would now be their own; and at
the same time, for want of Business, seek Service among
foreigners; it being alledged, That, at this time, there were
<PB N="88" REF="388"/>
16000 <HI>Scott</HI> Sailers in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Service—; This was
so plain a Case, that the Proposal was rejected, and the Ar∣ticle
pass'd with only the first Amendment.</P>

Union.</P>

<P><PB N="89" REF="389"/>
Then the Sixth Article of Union was Read, and after some Rea∣soning
thereon, there was a Proposal given in for adding the fol∣lowing
Clause to the cud of the Sixth Article, viz. <HI>Except in so
far as shall be Rectified by this Parliament,</HI> upon the Consideration of the
subsequent Articles.</P>
<P>Which being Read and Discoursed upon. There was another
Proposal given in, for Enlarging and Explaining the said Sixth
Article in these Terms, viz. <HI>And seing by the Laws of</HI> England now
<HI>standing, there are Rewards granted upon the Exportation of certain kinds
of Grain,</HI> wherein Oats is not specified, That, from and after the Uni∣on
when Oats shall be at Fifteen shillings per Quarter, or under, There
shall be paid Two Shillings and Six <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sence for every Quarter of Oat Neal
Exported in the Terms of the Laws, whereby Rewards are granted for
Exportation of other Grains. And in respect there is a Duty upon Oats
Imported into England, but no Duty upon Oat Meal, I he Importing
of which is a Prejudice and Discouragement to Tillage: Therefore, That
from and after the Union, the Quarter of Oat Meal be deemed equal to
three Quarters of Oats, and pay Duty accordingly, when imported to
<HI>Scotland</HI> from any place whatever beyond the Sea;</P>
<P>Which being likeways Read, alter some further Reasoning, it was
moved, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Observations (in relation to she Balance of the
Trade of this Nation made by the Council of Trade should be
laid before the Parliament.</P>
<P>And alter Debate thereupon, the further Consideration of the
said Sixth Article and Motions was delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of
Parliament, to be then resumed previous to all other Business: And
<HI>Ordered,</HI> That the Observations made by the Council of Trade be
then laid before the Parliament.</P>
<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>“The Sixth Article of Course began the Debates about Al∣lowances,
Drawbacks, Prohibitions and Restrictions, which,
as has been observed, were to be equal to all the Subjects
—; But <HI>Scotland</HI> finding some Difference in the Value
and Frequency of Import or Export of Grain, they found a
Necessity to come into some Amendments here too: The
Case was thus,</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> allowed a Bounty to the Exporter of Corn at all
times, when the Plenty of Grain kept the Price under such
a stated Rate; But it was observed there was no Bounty on
the Exportation of Oats, the Reason was, because <HI>England</HI>
rather wanted Oats than had them to spare, one Season with
another.</P>
<P>“On the other Hand, <HI>Scotland</HI> producing vast Quantities
of Oats, and having a large srade for the Exporting the
same to <HI>Norway,</HI> and other Parts, the <HI>Scots</HI> Members insisted
<PB N="90" REF="390"/>
That a Drawback should be allowed on Oats and Oat Meal
Exported.</P>
<P>Another Case also required an Alteration, and this respect∣ed
<HI>Ireland,</HI> which Bordering on <HI>Scotland,</HI> could and might
easily throw in great Quantities of Oats or Oat Meal into
<HI>Scotland,</HI> which being cheap in <HI>Ireland,</HI> would less n the
Consumption of the Growth of <HI>Scotland;</HI> There was, it
seems, a Prohibition formerly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laid on the Importation of
Oats or Oat Meal, but this being taken off by the Union,
it was requisite to make some Provision, where the <HI>English</HI>
Law was defective, which was thus,</P>
<P>The English had, by Act of Parliament, a Duty of Five
Shillings Six Pence per Quarter laid upon all Oats Import∣ed,
and that they thought was sufficient; But there being
no more Duty cm Oar Meal than on Oats, it was alledged,
That the <HI>Irish</HI> might Import the Oat Meal, and afford to
pay the Duty, since it was not above half the Value of
the Duty Oats, the Value of the Meal reducing thy Du∣ty.</P>
<P>“This therefore was provided against by this Additional
Clause, which doubled the Duty upon Oat Meal Imported,
by reckoning every Quarter of Oat Meal as two Quarters of
Oats.</P>
<P>The Acts in Favours of the respective Burghs were in order
to continue to them the several Impositions on Ale and Wine
customary in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or granting them anew, being gene∣rally
granted for the publick Uses of the Towns, such as build∣ing
or maintaining publick Edifices, Harbour, &amp;c. Just as
has been practised in <HI>England</HI> in the Duties on Coals as at
<HI>London</HI> for building the Churches, at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> for their Pier;
or on Ships, as at <HI>Dover</HI> for the Repair of their Harbour,
and the like: And this being the last Parliament to sit in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> if the Union succeeded, and all private Rights be∣ing
made perpetual, or to continue to the Times they were
Entailed for, this made the Towns the more solicitous to
have Acts passed m their Favours at this time; The Excise
upon Liquors, <HI>payable to private Hands,</HI> indeed was a No∣velty
in <HI>England,</HI> and seemed to be a very odd Re∣quest
at this time, This while, on one Hand, they
should be pleading, that <HI>Scotland</HI> could not pay more
Excise on their Liquor than they did before, at the
same time they should, on the other Hand, be seeking an
Additional Duty to be paid to the Burghs—; But the
Duty being so small as two Pennies <HI>Scots,</HI> which is but; of
a Penny on the Pint <HI>Scott,</HI> which is two Quarts <HI>English,</HI>
it was generally agreed to, and principally forth at
it was nut extended all over the Kingdom, but only in the few
Town, that having pubilck Trade to support, and chargeable
<PB N="91" REF="391"/>
Works to maintain, seem'd to have extraordinary Reasons to
demand it.</P>

<P>Address of Barons, Freeholders and others within the Shire of
<HI>Mid Lothian,</HI> subscribing the same, against an Union with <HI>England</HI>
in the Terms of the Articles, given in and Read.</P>
<P>The Sixth Articles, of Union again Read, and a Proposal given in
for adding the Word (<HI>Drawbacks</HI>) to both Clauses of the said Ar∣ticle,
which was agreed to.</P>
<P>And the said Article as so amended was again Read, as also the
Proposal mentioned in the Minutes of the last <HI>Sederunt,</HI> in relation
to Oats and Oat-Meal, with the Addition of a further Clause, in these
Terms, <HI>And that the Beer of</HI> Scotland <HI>have the like Rewards and Draw∣backs
as Barley.</HI></P>
<P>And it was likeways moved that another Clause should be added
thereto, allowing the like <HI>Praemium</HI> or <HI>Drawback</HI> on the Exportation
of Oat-Meal, as is allowed on the Exportation of Rye in <HI>England,</HI>
and after Debate thereupon, It was agreed that the sixth Article with
the Proposal for Amendments should be remitted to a Committee.</P>
<P>Thereafter there was a Clause offered to be added to the said sixth
Article in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> “But <HI>Scotland</HI> for the space of
years after the first Day of <HI>May</HI> next, shall be free from, and no ways
subject to the Prohibition and Restrictions made against Exporting
of Wool I, Skins with Wooll upon them, and Woollen Yarn, which
by the Oaths of the Sellers and Buyers shall be made appear to be
the proper growth and product of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Spun within the
same, which shall no ways be comprehended under any of the
Laws already made in <HI>England,</HI> or to be made during the space fore∣said.”</P>
<P>As also, a Clause in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> “Excepting and Reserving
the Duties upon Export and Import of such particular Commodi∣ties
from which any Persons the Subjects of either Kingdom are
specially Liberated and Exempted by their private Rights, which
alter the Union are to remain safe and intire to them in all Re∣spects.”</P>
<P>And sicklike, another Clause in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> “That after
the Union all sorts of <HI>Scots</HI> Lining, or any kind of Cloth made of
Plax or Hemp, be Exported out of the I United Kingdom, free of all
Customs or other Impositions what somever.”</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="392"/>
And another in these Terms, “That before the Union we may
have such a Drawback adjusted as may enable us to Export Beef and
Pork and Butter to the West <HI>Indies</HI> and other Foreign Parts which
will be a considerable Branch of our Trade after the Union.”</P>
<P>And like ways another Clause in these Terms, “That from and
after the Union all Duties or Bounty Tolls, or other Exactions
upon black Cattle, or any other Product of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when carried
into <HI>England,</HI> or Product of <HI>England</HI> when carried into Scotland,
payable either to the publick or private Persons, shall in all time
coming be void and null.”</P>
<P>And another Clause in these Terms, “That from and after the
Union, the Kingdom or <HI>Scotland</HI> shall have Liberty for ever to
Manufacture Plaiding, Fingrams, Galloway-whites, Sarges, Stock∣ings,
and all sorts of Lining, as they have been in use to do, con∣form
to the Regulations contained in their own Laws, and to Ex∣port
the same to <HI>England</HI> or Dominions and Plantations thereto
belonging, or to any other Place beyond Seas, free of any Duty or
Imposition whatsomever to be said thereon, but in case any of
the Subjects of that part of United <HI>Britain</HI> now called <HI>Scotland,</HI>
shall Export any other sort of Woollen Manufactory than what is
above-mentioned, They are to be lyable to the Regulations and
Taxes of <HI>England</HI> imposed before the Union, or to be imposed by
the British Parliament after the Union.”</P>
<P>And it was agreed that all the Clauses above insert should be
likeways Remitted to a Committee.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was Moved, That the Sixth Article and Proposals
and Additional Clauses relating thereto, should be Remitted to
the Committee for examining the Calculation of the <HI>Equivalent,</HI>
which was agreed to.</P>
<P>Thereafter it was also moved that a further Number of the Mem∣bers
of each State should be added to the said Committee, and
thereupon a Vote was put, <HI>Add or not,</HI> and it carried <HI>add.</HI></P>
<P>Then it was moved, that two of each State be the Number to be
added, and likeways moved, that the Number of four of each State
be added, and after some Reasoning, it was put to the Vote <HI>Two</HI> s or
<HI>four,</HI> and it carried Two, and the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament ap∣pointed
for choising the Additional Members.</P>
<P>Then the Seventh Article of Union was Read, and the Reasoning
thereupon delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament, to be then
proceeded upon previous 10 all other Business, after choising of the
Additional Members for the Committee.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Observations upon this days Minutes, will be more
properly referred to the time when the Committee to whom
the sixth Article was referred, make their Report.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="393"/>
“The Amendment of (<HI>Drawbacks</HI>) was not scrupled, it
was included before in the word <HI>Allowances,</HI> but it was such a
Triffle, that no Body would Dispute it, seing it contained
nothing but what was intended in the Article it self.</P>
<P>The Amendments offered were many, and the refering them
to a Committee was, <HI>no Question,</HI> the best Method to come
to a Settlement in the several Particulars:, but this may be
observed, and it was remarkable, that such was the Igno∣rance
of the Objectors in these Cases, and so much had they
been imposed upon in Matters of Trade, that they De∣manded
inconsistent and impracticable Things, they deman∣ded
Exemption from Imposts which no Body paid, they De∣manded
Liberty where there were no Prohibitions, and Equa∣lities
which were already agreed to.</P>
<P>For Example, Liberty of Exporting Wooll, a Thing on
which the whole <HI>English</HI> Commerce depended, and without
a Restraint upon which, all their Manufactures would have
been Ruin'd, a Thing impracticable in the Nature of their
Trade, and which it was inconsistent with Reason to expect.</P>
<P>“Then they required Liberty of Exporting Linen Duty free,
whereas it was evident, had they consulted the <HI>English</HI> Affairs,
they would have found, the <HI>English</HI> gave that Liberty to all the
World; And if any Linen was Imported into <HI>England,</HI> what∣ever
Duty it paid there, was allowed back again, upon Ex∣portation
by Certificate.</P>
<P>Next, They demanded Liberty to Export their Woollen
Goods free of all Duties and Customs, whereas it was known,
<HI>England</HI> had, long since, taken off all Duty or Custom upon
their Woollen Manufactures for several Reasons of Trade, and
for the Encouragement of the Poor.</P>
<P>“Again they asked Freedom of carrying their Goods &amp; Cattel
into England without Customs and Toll, which it was evident,
without any Provision, was the Consequence of the Union;
And there could no more remain any Toll, Custom or Duty,
On Passing and Repassing of Cattel or Goods between <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and <HI>Scotland,</HI> than there could in either Kingdom, from
one County to another.</P>
<P>But this will further appear, when the Report of the
Committee comes to be under Consideration.</P>

<HEAD>MINUTE XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Thursday 28. November 1706.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Prayers Said,
Rolls Called,</OPENER>
<P>Then the following Addresses were given in and Read, <HI>viz.</HI> Ad∣dress
of Heretors and others Inhabitants of the Paroch of St. <HI>Ninians,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="394"/>
Subscribers of the same, and Address of the Magistrates,
Council, Burgesses and other Inhabitants of the Burgh of <HI>Dumbar,</HI>
subscribing the same, both against an Union with <HI>England</HI> in the
Terms of the Articles.</P>
<P>Thereafter the Parliament (conform to the Minutes of the last
<HI>Sederunt</HI>) proceeded to Elect the Additional Members to the Com∣mittee,
to whom the Sixth Article, and Clauses and Proposals re∣lative
thereto, are Remitted; And the Three Estates having se∣parated
to their usual Places, They Returned, and Reported their
respective Elections of the said Additional Members, as follows
<HI>viz.</HI> Of the Nobility, the Earls of <HI>Haddingtonn</HI> and <HI>Cremarty;</HI> Of
the Commissioners for Shires, Sir <HI>Gilbert Eliot of Minto</HI> and sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Burnet of Leyes;</HI> Of the Commissioners for Burghs, Sir <HI>John
Areskine</HI> and Sir <HI>Peter Halket,</HI> and the Committee was appointed to
meet in the Inner-Session House to Morrow at Nine of the Clock in
the Forenoon.</P>
<P>Then the Seventh Article of Union was again Read, and after
some Reasoning, a Proposal was made, for an Explanation and
Addition, whereby this Nation would be secured against paying
more Excise for the Two Penny Ale than they now do, in these
Terms, <HI>That the Thirty Four Gallons</HI> English <HI>Barrel of Beer or Ale,
amounting, to, Twelve Gallons</HI> Scots <HI>present Measure, sold in</HI> Scotland
<HI>by the Brewer at Nine Shillings Six Pence</HI> Sterling, <HI>excluding all Du∣ties,
and Retailed, including Duties, and the Retailers Prosite at two
Pence the</HI> Scots <HI>Pint, or Eight Part of the</HI> Scots <HI>Gallon,</HI> Be not, after
the Union, lyable on Account of the present Excise upon Exciseable Li∣quors
in <HI>England,</HI> To any higher Imposition than Two Shillings <HI>Ster∣ling</HI>
upon the foresaid Thirty Four Gallons <HI>English</HI> Barrel, being
Twelve ddllqns the present Scots Measure.</P>
<P>And another Clause being likeways offered in these Terms, And
it is hereby Specially provided, That the Two Penny Ale or Beer of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
shall be only charged with the same Excise as the small Beer of
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>After some Debate, the Vote was stated, Approve of the, Seventh
Article, as to the Excise of Ale and Beer, with the Explanation, as
contained in the First or Second Clauses above insert, and thereup∣on
the said Clauses being Read,</P>
<P>It was agreed, That the Members shall be Marked as they Vote,
and that a List of their Names, as they Vote First or Second, shall
be Printed, whereupon the Vote was put, Approve of the Seventh
Article, as to the Excise of Ale and Beer, with the Explanation, as
contained in the said First or Second Clauses, and it carried <HI>First.</HI></P>
<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debate of this Article had made much more Noise
our of the House than it did within, some People had in∣dustriously
alarmed <HI>Scotland</HI> with an Apprehension, That,
<PB N="95" REF="395"/>
according to the Words of the Article, <HI>Scotland</HI> was to pay
equal Excise with <HI>England,</HI> That is, that as the strong Beer
or Ale in <HI>England</HI> paid Four Shillings Nine Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel,
so must the common Beer, then Brewed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> pay the
same price; And it was manifest, that this was the Opini∣ion
of several Members of, Parliament by their Speeches on
this Occasion in the House, as well as without.</P>
<P>“On the other Hand, others pretended to bring all the
Ale Brewed then in <HI>Scotland</HI> down to the Denomination of
<HI>English small Beer,</HI> as being not fold for more thin some of
the Table Beer in <HI>England</HI> was sold for, which paid but as
small Beer alter the Rate of One Shilling Three Pence <HI>per</HI>
Barrel.</P>
<P>I shall be very far from offering to make any part of this
History Officious, in giving an Account of any mean Share
the Author had in this Affair, yet I cannot omit relating
this part of the Concern which casually happened to him in
this particular; And it may be mentioned for the sake of
the Jest it made in the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> That while it was
thought well done to have a Share in stating the Proportions
of the Excise, several Persons pretended to the Title of being
the first Contrivers of it; but when afterwards, on some Cla∣mour
raised upon the Inequality of the Proportions, the Con∣trivers
began to be blamed, and a little threatned <HI>a-la-Mob,</HI>
then it was <HI>D. F.</HI> made it all, and he was to be Stoned for
it; And afterward, when those Differences appearing but
Trifles, were by the Prudence of the Commissioner reconciled,
then they would willingly have reassumed the Honour of be∣ing
the first formers of this Affair.</P>
<P>It was indeed no small Difficulty at first, how to state a
<HI>Medium</HI> between the two Nations- <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1 It had been laid down
as a Maxim, <HI>That</HI> Scotland <HI>could,</HI> by no means, bear the high
Excises paid for their strong Beer in <HI>England;</HI> It was also
absolutely necessary to regard doing Justice to England, who,
paying Four Shillings Nine Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel Excise, would
have had a great Hardship, if Scotland should have had all
their Beer as <HI>English</HI> small Beer.</P>
<P>“Again, the <HI>Scots,</HI> Ale which Was sold in the Pubiick Houses,
and commonly called <HI>TIPPONT,</HI> was in no Proportion like
the English strong Beer, either in Price or in Strength, being
sold for one Penny the <HI>Chappin,</HI> which was near the <HI>English</HI>
Quart, by Retail after paying a subsequent Excise to tho
Cities or Burghs, and not one Half, or above one Third
as strong as the <HI>English</HI> Ale or strong Beer. Upon this I shall
impartially set down the Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>“I he Author of this being sent for by the Committee of
Parliament then sitriiiR, the same to whom the Sixth Article
was committed, as is above said, attended them at their Meet∣ing
in the Lord <HI>Cesnock's</HI> Chamber; And being called in,
<PB N="96" REF="396"/>
the Committee did him the Honour to tell him, they were
informed he had spent some Thoughts on the Affair of the
Excises, and that he had made some Calculations; They
told him, the Parliament were coming upon the Debate of
the Seventh Article, and the great Difficulty before them was,
to find out a <HI>Medium</HI> between the <HI>Scots</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Ex∣cise,
so as might make it tolerable to <HI>Scotland.</HI> and not give
England Reason to take Umbrage, or complain of Injustice.</P>
<P>“He frankly owned, he thought it Would be very hard,
and proposed what he had formerly insisted on. <HI>viz.</HI> That
the <HI>Scots</HI> Ale or Tippony being sold for no more Money
than the Houshold or Table Beer in the City of <HI>London</HI>
which is called Eight Shilling Beer, and is often sold for Ten
Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel; the Scots ought also to pay no more.</P>
<P>“But the Lord President of the Session objected, That the <HI>English</HI>
would never be satisfied with that Payment, as not being a just
Proportion; That the Act of Parliament was express; That all
Beer above the Price of Six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel should pay as
strong Beer; That those kinds of Beer; called Eight Shil∣ling
Beer, were generally Mixtures after the Excise was paid;
and that the Denomination in <HI>England</HI> being but of two
kinds, it would not be possible to place this on either Head,
and to leave it to the Method of the Eight Shilling Beer in
<HI>London,</HI> would be to lay all <HI>Scotland</HI> at the Mercy or the Ex∣cise
Officers, which would be unsufferable.</P>
<P>This Discourse put a Thought in the Authors Head just
in the Moment, upon which he told their Lordships, he
thought a Proportion to both Sides might be formed, taking
its Rise from the Price of the Beer, and Value of the Excise
in either Kingdom, and that he thought, he could form it
for them, so as that it should not grieve either Party.</P>
<P>Upon which their Lordships desired him to try, he took
the Pen and Ink, and immediately stated the-Case thus,</P>
<P>“There are in <HI>England</HI> but two Denominations of Excise∣able
Beer, small and strong.</P>
<P>The small was supoosed in the Act at Six Shillings <HI>per</HI>
Barrel, and payed One Shilling Three Pence per Barrel Excise,
which is excluded out of the Six Shillings per Barrel.</P>
<P>“The strong was supposed at Eighteen or Twenty Shillings
<HI>per</HI> Barrel, and payed Four Shillings Nine Pence Excise, which
is included in the Eighteen or Twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel.</P>
<P>“There is in <HI>Scotland</HI> but one Denomination of Excise
able Beer, <HI>which we call, at shove for Use sake,</HI> Tippony.</P>
<P>This was sold for about Nine shillings Six Pence stering
per Twelve <HI>Scots</HI> Gallons to the Retailer, and payed Twenty
Three Pence <HI>sterling</HI> Duty, which is not included in the Nine
Shillings Six Pence.</P>
<P>“<HI>Note,</HI> Twelve <HI>Scott</HI> Gallons was supposed to hold
much about the <HI>English</HI> Ale Gauge of Thirty Four Gal∣lons,
<PB N="97" REF="397"/>
there were some Fractions or small Differences,
which the Committee did not Examine into; of which
by it self.”</P>
<P>“Taking then this <HI>English Excise from Twenty shilling per</HI>
Barrel downward to Nine Shillings Six Pence; or from Six
Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel upward to Nine Shillings Six Pence; and
then Calculate the Excise from either of these Extremes,
and the middle seemed to be a just Excise; and this Project
had two happy Circumstances in it, which exactly supplyed
the Difficulty.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>For Example.</HEAD>
<P>“The Price of the <HI>Scots</HI> strong Beer being Nine Shillings Six∣pence
per Barrel exclusive of the Excise, and the Price of the
<HI>English</HI> Beer <HI>reckoning it at Twenty Shillings</HI> per <HI>Barrel</HI> inclusive <HI>of
the Excise,</HI> being Fourteen Shillings Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel,
<HI>exclusive</HI> of the Excise, Nine Shillings Sixpence is to Fourteen
Shillings Three pence, as Nineteen to Fourteen Shillings Nine∣pence.</P>
<P>Thus,
“<HI>9 sh. 6 d. sterling</HI> is Pence 114, the Price of the <HI>Scots</HI> strong
<HI>Beer exclusive</HI> of the Excise.</P>
<P>“<HI>14 sh. 3. d. sterling</HI> is Pence <HI>171—Ditto.</HI> of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>“Two Thirds of 171, which is 14 sh. 3 d. is 114, <HI>which
is 9 sh. 6 d.</HI></P>
<P>“Two Thirds of 57 Pence, which is 4 sh. 9 d. is 19 d.
which is the <HI>Medium</HI> of Excise this way.</P>
<P>“Again, if you begin at the lowest Rate of the Excise, and
the lowest Price of <HI>Beer,</HI> and from thence draw the Proporti∣on
upward, then Two Shillings the present stated Excise, is
the same to Twelve, as Fifteen <HI>Pence</HI> is to <HI>Six</HI> Shil. or so
near it, as they sell the <HI>Beer inclusive:</HI> So that the difference
is of no extraordinary Consequence; <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>Twelve Gallons <HI>Scots</HI> paying Two Shillings Excise, is
sold for Twelve Shilling <HI>sterling</HI> including the Duty.</P>
<P>“One Barrel <HI>English</HI> small <HI>Bear,</HI> paying One Shilling Three
Pence Excise, is sold at Seven Shillings Six Pence <HI>per</HI>
Barrel <HI>inclusive</HI> of the Duty.</P>
<P>“<HI>Note,</HI> Two Shilling is One sixth Part of Twelve Shilling,
and One Shilling Three Pence is One sixth Part of Seven
Shillings Six Pence.</P>
<P>“Thus the Excise of both Kingdoms Hands upon the same

<P>Moved, that the Observations made by the Council of Trade in
Relation to the Export and Import of this Nation, and a Ballance

<P>Then the Lord Chancellor acquainted the Parliament, <HI>That the

Accounts of Irregular and Tumultuary Meetings, by some People of the
common and meanest Degree in Arms, and of Abuses committed by them
at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> Stewartry of <HI>Kirkcudbright</HI> and <HI>Dumfreis,</HI> and several
places of <HI>Lanerk</HI> shire, and that there were Papers dropt inviting People
to take up Arms, and to provide Ammunition and Provisions in orderly
their Marching to disturb the Parliament, all which he was directed by the
Right Honourable the Lords of Her Majestics Secret Council to lay before
the Parliament, to the effect proper Methods might he resolved upon for
preventing the evil Consequences of such Pratices; <HI>and thereafter pre∣sented
a Letter from the Magistrates of</HI> Dumsreis <HI>to Her Majesties Ad∣vocat,</HI>
Bearing an account of the Abuses and Tumultuary Meetings in that
Place with a Declaration emitted by those who met, which was affixt on

<P><HI>Whereupon a Draught of a Proclamation to be emitted by the

Her Majesties high Commissioner was thereupon pleased to notifie

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>“The Affair of the Rabbles in the Country came now before
the Parliament, for things were come to that Height in the Coun∣try,
that it was no longer to be Tampered with; The Party
who opposed the Union had so far prevailed upon the People
that they began to break all Bounds; at <HI>Dumsries</HI> the Artic es
of the Union were burnt at the Market Cross, by a Number
of People in Arms, tho' they were not near so many as was
Reported at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where they industriously enlarged
those Reports, to Intimidate the Party that was for the
Union, and, <HI>if possible,</HI> to set the Mob in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to
Work again; But the Guards there did their Duty so
Effectually, that there was no more Appearance in the Street,
tho' loud Threatnings were made of it.</P>
<P>As to the Burning the Articles, it was true, That a Num∣ber
of People being got together, did publickly burn the Ar∣ticles
of the Union, as concluded at <HI>London,</HI> with the List
of the Names of the Cummissioners of the Treaty, and did
affix a Paper upon the Cross of Dumsriss which they called,
<HI>Reasons for and Disigns in Burning the Articles, &amp;c.</HI> after
having read the said Paper from the Cross.</P>
<P>“This Paper was afterwards printed, and the Printer being
ordered to be apprehended, sled for it till the first Heat was
over, and then he appeared again, and was not questioned
for it.</P>
<P>“The Copy of the said Paper is added in the <HI>Appendix to
this Work. N. Ex.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="400"/>
“But it is to be noted, That whereas the Paper mentions
Squadrons of Foot and Horse, and the Report was of
5000 and 7000 People, 5000 in Arms that entered the Town,
and 7000 in the Hills to support them—; It was all Ru∣mour,
the most that appeared in this Action being about
200, and these in no sort of Military Order or Equippage, as
I have noted before.</P>
<P>“Yet was this Disorder improved to a great Height, and
particularly as it was improved to make the Government ap∣prehend,
the Western People were resolved to concern them∣selves
in this Affair, and to take Arms against the Govern∣ment;
The Parliament was very sensible of this, and being
very 10th to have any Force made use of, they tryed all the
Methods possible, by Proclamations, and publick Repealing
the Licence for Mustering, to take away all Opportunity of
Assembling together, by which the People might be drawn
into the Snare.</P>
<P>“It is observable, That even, in the House, there appeared
some, who were very 10th to have these Rabbles discourag∣ed
and discountenanced; And tho I could give more par∣ticuiar
Instances of it, yet this of Objecting against the Cer∣tainty
of the Accounts, viz. <HI>That it did not appear, that
there was a particular Information of any Tumultuary Meetings,
or Irregular Convocations;</HI> This, I say, is a clear Proof of it, for
these Objectors were openly against preventing the Mustering
or Assembling the Lieges according to the Act of Security, and
gave this Suggestion, viz. <HI>Want of Information</HI> for a Reason,
whereas the Matter of Fact was, That the Lord Commissio∣ner
had real and direct Information of this Affair of <HI>Dumfries,</HI>
and of private Emissaries gone abroad to excite the People
to take Arms, and the respective Meetings of these Agents or
Emissaries in the County of <HI>Lanerk,</HI> and elsewhere, more than
sufficient to justifie the Precautions mentioned in the Minute.</P>
<P>“Upon this Debate the Proclamation was Voted, and the
Act of Security, so far as it concerned this Case, was repealed,
which had various Effects in several parts of the Country, in
some places it really crush'd and prevented their assembling,
at <HI>Glasgow</HI> it irritated and provoked them, and made them
more Furious than before—; But generally it had a very
good Effect, for it took away the pretence which any of the
Lairds or Heads of Clans might have had before, to have ap∣peared
with the People in Arms, and under the pretence
whereof, they might have been exonered in Law, while an
Act of Parliament was in Force to protect them, for no Man
could say, if a Gentleman gathered 100 or 500 Men together,
that he had any ill Design, and tho' he Arm'd them and
Train'd them, and kept them together, he could not be
accused for any Crime, because the Law allowed him to do so,
<PB N="101" REF="401"/>
'under pretence of Arming and Disciplining the Fencible
Men, as Authorized by the Act of Security.</P>
<P>“This appeared theresore so necessary at this Time, That
a Proposal was immediately brought in to Repeal that part
of the Act of Security, at least to Suspend it for a Time;
There was great Opposition made to this Proposal, and abun∣dance
of Speeches made Applauding the Act of Security,
how diffcultly it was obtained, and how much of the Liber∣ty
of <HI>Scotland</HI> depended upon it—; But the Motion be∣ing
seconded with the Necessity of the Time, and the Causes
as above, and withal the Proposal being made to extend it
only to the Time of the present Session of Parliamen; as per
the Vote, it admitted the less Opposition.</P>

<P>A Print was then given in, Intituled, <HI>An Account of the Burning

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXX.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debates of this Day were principally taken up about Re∣pealing
the Clause of the Act of Security anent Arming &amp; Excr∣cising
as besore, and great Struggles were made to preserve the
Clause, but it look'd so like Abetting the Tumults which were
now in their Height, that no Man could speak heartily to it,
for all Men pretended, at least, to disowne the Design of
Rabbling the Parliament, and breaking up their Consultations
by Tumults and Violence, but yet, as far as they could drive it,
they opposed this Vote.</P>
<P>“At last it was carried, and the Act was touched, and is
printed in that part of this Work, Intituled, <HI>Of the carrying on
the Treaty in Scotland, Faliv</HI> 74.</P>
<P>“The Paper about Burning the Articles at <HI>Dumsreis</HI> was now
censur'd, and the Printer, kept out of the way some time,
but no Proccedings were made on it, only that the paper
was burnt by the Hangman according to the Order.</P>
<P>“The Difficulties of the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Articles,
being generally respecting Taxes, Excises, Salt, Exporrations
and Importations, Act. of Trade; were reserred to the Com∣mittee
<PB N="103" REF="403"/>
to settle, and shall be spoken to as they came again
before the House.</P>
<P>“It is to be observed, among the great Croud of Addresses
that had been brought into the House, one of this day from
the Burgh of <HI>Air,</HI> differed from the Generality, and was not
as others, <HI>against an Union with England in the Terms of the Ar∣ticles;
But was for Recjisication of the Articles, and Ease of Taxes;</HI>
This had some seeming Sofress in it, and appeared more
reasonable than the other, and the Parliament seem'd General∣ly
Inclined to enter upon Rectisications and Ease of Taxes,
and the References to the Committee were with that Prospect,
the Difficulty lay how to Regulate and so Govern the said Re∣gulations,
as to make them equal to both Kingdoms, Reason∣able
in <HI>Scotland</HI> to Ask, and Reasonable in <HI>England</HI> to Com∣play
with, that so the Poor might, as far as possible, be Eased,
the Circumstances of both kingdoms be Considered, and <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
not be Imposed upon, for they were not Ignorant that
there were Vigilant Endeavours at Work, to obtain such
Amendments as <HI>England</HI> should stick at, and as might, at least,
occasion the Treaty to be sent back to <HI>Scotland</HI> for further
Amendments; and then they would be able to raise such fur∣ther
Difficulties, that the Time might Expire upon their hands,
and then the whole Work had been to do over again.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>“The Ninth of the Articles of the Union, could admit of
no Debate, but whether the Eight Months Cess agreed to be
the Proportion of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Land Tax of Four Shillings
per Pound upon Rent in <HI>England,</HI> were founded upon a true
Scale of Equalities: I have already sted this Question in the
Observations on the Minutes of the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> and
need not Repeat them; but observe, that the Proposal now
made of Six Months Cess, to the <HI>English</HI> Two Million Land
Tax, had no Arguments at all to support it, that could be
made good by just Proportions, neither were there any
Schemes offered to the House, to Form any other Proportions
from, or to prove any thing of Equalities upon; So the
making this Offer produced no other Effect, than the bare
reciting the feveral Calculates and Proportions upon which
the other was Formed, and which had been approved in the
Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> and upon an Eahe Examination, they ap∣peared
so Just, that nothing could be offered of any real
<PB N="105" REF="405"/>
Weight, to move the Parliament to alter it; So this Clause
past with small Difficulty.</P>
<P>“The Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth Articles re∣quired
no Debate, consisting only of Exemptions to <HI>Scotland</HI>
from several Duties and Taxes paid in <HI>England,</HI> which could
not be Extended to <HI>Scotland,</HI> such as Stampt Paper, which
in <HI>Scotland</HI> could not consist with the Methods of the Law, nor
be born in Trade; or the Window Lights, which was De∣termined
not to be continued in <HI>England,</HI> and the Coal and
Culm, which according to the Method of that Tax in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
did not reach to the Coal in <HI>Scotland,</HI> other than such
as should be carried into <HI>England,</HI> or Exported into Foreign
parts, which were expresly provided for in the Clause, in
these words, <HI>That Scotland shall be charged with the same Dh∣ties
as in England, for all Coal, Culm, and Cynders not consumed
in Scotland:</HI> As to the Malt Tax in <HI>England,</HI> which was the
Thirteenth Article, it was Temporary, and could not Extend
to <HI>Scotland</HI> without a new Law, and that was provided
against in the next Article.</P>

<OPENER>prayers Said,
Rolls Called,</OPENER>
<P>The Parliament was then acquainted, That the Report of the
Committee anent the Calculation of the Equivalent remitted to them
was ready, and in the Clerks Hands, and that all Persons concerned
may see the same and grounds whereupon it proceeds, before the
Report be brought in to the Parliament.</P>
<P>Thereaster the Fourteenth Article of Union was again Read and
an Amendment and Addition thereto was offered in these Terms,
<HI>And that the part of the United Kingdom, non called Scotland, shall
not in all time coming be charged with any Malt Tax, or any other
(ustoms, Excises, Taxes or any other Burdens or Duties than these con∣sented
to in this Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>And aster some Reasoning upon the sirst part of the said Clause
in Relation to the Malt-Tax, It was proposed, That the Amend∣ment
should be in these Terms, with this further Provision, that
any Malt to be make and consumed within that part of the United
Kingdom, now called Scotland, shall not be charged with any Impositi∣on
on Malt during this present War.</P>
<P>And after some further Debate, The Vote was stared, <HI>Whether
the hxemption from any Imposition on Malt shall be Temporary or per∣pet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="406"/>
Then the Vote was put. <HI>Whether the Exemption shall be Temporary
or Perpetual,</HI> and it carried <HI>Temporary.</HI></P>
<P>Thereafter it was proposed, That the Exemption shall be during
this present War.</P>
<P>It was also proposed, That the Exemption shall be for a longer
Time.</P>
<P>And after Debate thereon, The Vote was stated, <HI>Whether
the Exemption from any Imposition on Malt shall be during this present
War, or for a longer time,</HI> and it carried <HI>during this present War.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Article as Amended was again Read, and the further
Consideration there of delayed till next Sederunt of Parliament, to
be then proceeded upon previous to all other Business.</P>
<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten a Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Affair of the Malt-Tax came upon the Stage, in the
Debate of the Fourteenth Article, because it was but a Tem∣porary
Tax in <HI>England;</HI> and therefore was to be Considered
amongst these Things, which the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
might hereafter lay Taxes upon.</P>
<P>“The Treaters had Acquiesced in a Supposition offered in <HI>En∣gland</HI>
in these Words, That the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> could
not be supposed to lay any sorts of Burdens upon the United King∣dom,
but what they shall find of Necessity at that time for the Preser∣vation
and Good of the whole and with due Regard to the Circumstan∣ces
and Abilities of every part of the United kingdom; Therefore it
is agreed, that there be no further Exemption insisted upon for any
part of the United Kingdom, but that the Consideration of any Exemp∣tions
beyond what are already agreed on in this Treaty shall be left to
the Determination of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> Upon this
Account they did not insist upon Exemptions of Duties any
further, than the said Duties were then Extended in <HI>England.</HI>
But People were now come a greater length, and they did not
care to Trust the <HI>British</HI> Parliament so far—; They had
encouraged all manner of Jealousies of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament,
the People had received no Notions, but of <HI>Scotlands</HI> being
always Opprest by them, both in Civil and Religious Con∣cerns:
And that therefore nothing was to be left to them.
That the <HI>British</HI> parliament was to be Fenced against as a
declared Enemy, and the Representatives of <HI>Scotland</HI> being
like to be but a Few, <HI>viz. Fourty Five</HI> to Five Hundred and
Thirteen, they were to be Crushed by Number, Outvoted and
Disregarded in every Thing relating to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“There is no more, Wonder to be made, that they were
for making every Thing secure, and settling it to Points and
Punctilios, who had entcrtain'd such Notions as these; The
Malt-Tax therefore being acknowledged Insupportable in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="407"/>
and the Treaters having Determined it so, and Exemp∣ted
<HI>Scotland</HI> from it, for as long Time as it was now in Force
in <HI>England,</HI> the Parliament building upon that Supposition,
resolve to Determine the time of the Exemption, that they
may be sure of it.</P>
<P>“It was moved very briskly, That <HI>Scotland</HI> should for ever
be Exempt from it; but that went not far, as appears in the
Vote some were for a certain Term of years, some for an
Exemption during the War, others for a certain Number of
years after the War.</P>
<P>“The Exemption during the War, seem'd the mosrt rational,
because it was known, that the Tax upon Malt was a Tem∣porary
Tax, given but upon the Emergence of the War, and
as the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> were with difficulty brought to sub∣mit
to it, so they were not Easie under it, and would never
suffer it to continue after the War, having for that End given
it but from year to year, that it might not be entangled with
Anticipations, or appropriated to Payments that should con∣tinue
it; And therefore to Exempt <HI>Scotland</HI> during the War,
was a total Exemption in its kind, and seemed sufficient—;
This was Opposed a <HI>little</HI> but as being a Point gain'd, those
who sought the Regulation of Conditions only, came freely
into it, and so it passed.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debate of this Day run only upon the Affair men∣tioned
before, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether they should depend upon the
<HI>British</HI> Parliament maintaining a just and equal Regard to the
Good of the whole United Island after the Union, and that
they would have Respect to the Circumstances of every part
in their laying on Taxes, or whether they should pin them
down in all time coming, that no other Burdens or Taxes
should be laid on, than those already mentioned.</P>
<P>“The Supposition of the Parliament of <HI>Britains</HI> being par∣tial
against <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Representatives of <HI>Scotland</HI> be∣ing
few, being oppress'd and out-voted, as I have noted al∣ready,
tho' it was a Popular Notion, and improved to an
extravagant Height without Doors, yet it had not obtained
so, as to be owned in the Parliament, nor indeed could any
Man, with just Reason, have supposed such a thing; And
there sore, to offer at a positlve Limitation on the Parliament
of <HI>Britain,</HI> seemed to have something in it very harsh.</P>
<P>“Again it was alledged, That, to Limit the Parliament of
<HI>Britain,</HI> not to lay on any other Customs, Excises, Taxes,
Duties or Burdens, than those consented to in this Act, was to
take away the Power from the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to consorm
their Affairs even to their own Circumstances, since the Time
might come, when some of these Duties might Wecome bur∣densome,
that now were not so and others, which now would
burdensome, might be more for the Publick Service; but
to ty the Parliament downabsolutely as in this Clause, would be
to Limit them from making Alterations in the Publick Taxes,
tho' apparently for the Publick Advantage, and would in
effect take from them that Power, for which they were really
constituted, <HI>viz.</HI> To Dispose, the Peoples Purses, and Redress
their Grievances.</P>
<P>“It was long Argued, That the Parliament ought to be Li∣mited
in this Case, because of the Danger there was of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
being burdened with Intolerable Taxes, and of the pre∣sent
Circumstances of <HI>Scotland</HI> which were allowed to be un∣able
to bear them; That under the pretence of Alteration
of Taxes, Oppressive Duties might be laid upon <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which, tho' they might be tolerable in <HI>England,</HI> were not so
here, and they ought to provide against them.</P>
<P>“But it was Resolved at last into this, That all future Con∣tingencies
must be lest to a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, and the Words
of the Articles contained a sufficient Reason for so doing,
<HI>viz. It could not be supposed, That the Parliament of Great∣Britain
will ever lay any sorts of Burdens upon the United King∣dom,
but about they shall sind of Necessity, at that time, for the
Proservation and Good of the whole, and with due Regard to the Cir∣cumstances
<PB N="109" REF="409"/>
and Abilities of every part of the United Kingdom;
Therefore it is Agreed, That there be no further Exemption insist∣ed
upon for any part of the United Kingdom, but that the
Consideration of any Exemptions, beyond what are already agreed
on in this Treaty, shall be left to the Determination of the Parlia∣ment
of</HI> Great-Britain.</P>
<P>“And thus, with some Difficulty, the Clause was pass'd,
without any further Amendment.</P>

<OPENER>Prayers Said,
Rolls Called,</OPENER>
<P>The Fisteenth Article of Union Read, and thereaster the sirst
Clause or Paragraph thero of again read; As also the Report brought
in from the Committee for Examining the Calculation of the Equi∣valent
being as follows; The Committee of Parliament, to whom
the considering of the Calculation of the Equivalent was
remitted, having considered the Report made to them by
Doctor <HI>James Gregory</HI> Professor of the Matehematicks in the Colledge
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Report made by Doctor <HI>Thomas Bowar</HI> Profes∣sor
of the Mathematicks in the Colledge of <HI>Aberdeem,</HI> of their seve∣ral
and respective Examinations of the Calcul, and Grounds thereof,
whereupon the Commissoners, in Treating the Article for establish∣ing
the Equivalent, did proceed, and also having considered the Re∣port
of the Sub-committee thereaent, they sind, That the Compu∣tation
of the Equivalent mentioned in the Article is just and that
the Calcul is exact, and well founded in the Terms, and in Manner
expressed in the said Article.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was proposed, to delay the Consederation of the
faid Fifteenth Article, until Reports be brought in, in Relation to
the sixth and Eighth Articles, from the Committee, to whom the
faids Articles are remitted.</P>
<P>And after Debate thereon, it was agreed, That the proceeding
on the Fifteenth Article shall not be understood to be any
Determination of the Sixth or Eighth Articles that stand committed;
But that the Reasoning and Voting on the Sixth and Eighth Ar∣ticles
shall be intire.</P>
<P>Then a State of a Vote was offered in these Terms, <HI>Approve of
the first Paragraph of the Fifteenth Article, or Not.</HI></P>
<P>But it being moved, That the Parliament sirst consider, whether
we shall be concerned in the payment of the <HI>English</HI> Debts: A s∣cond
State was thereupon offered, whether we shall ingage in the
Payment of the Debts of <HI>England, Tea,</HI> or Not.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="410"/>
And after some Reasoning thereon, it was put to the Vote,
which of the two should be the State of the Vote, <HI>First,</HI> or <HI>Second.</HI></P>
<P>And besore Voting, it was agreed, That the Members Votes shall
be marked, and that a List of their Names, as they shall Vote, shall
be Printed and Recorded.</P>
<P><HI>And the Lord</HI> Beilhaven <HI>gave in a Protesr,</HI> as follows: I do Pro∣st
in my own Name, and in the Name of all those who do adhere to
this my Protest, That the Voting and Agreeing to the first Clst of the
Fisteenth Article of the Treaty of Union, doth no ways infer any manner
of Consent or Agreement, That <HI>Scotland</HI> should be lyable to the <HI>English</HI>
Debt in general, but that it may be lawful to object against any Branch
of the said Debt not already determined: <HI>And he took Instruments
thereupon, and the Duke of</HI> Hamilton, <HI>the Earl</HI> of Selkirk, the Lord
Saltounn, Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, Sir Humphrcy Cvlquboun of Luss,
David Bethun of Balfour, Major Henry Balfour of Dunboig, Mr. Tho∣mas
Hope of Rankeilor, Alexander Watson, <HI>and</HI> Mr. Robert Frazer, <HI>ad∣hered
thereto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then the Vote was</HI> put, First, or Second, <HI>and it carried</HI> First.</P>
<P><HI>There after it was put to the Vote,</HI> Approve of the first Clause or Para∣graph
of the Fifteenth Article, or not, <HI>and it carried</HI> Approve.</P>
<P>Her Majesties High Commissioner, and the Estates of Parliament,
did recommend the Persons imployed in the Calculation of the Equi∣valent
by the Committee, to whom the Examining there of was re∣mitted,
to the Lords of Her Majesties The saury, for a Giatisication
for their Pains.</P>
<P><HI>Adjourned till Tuesday next at Ten of the Clock.</HI></P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>“They were now come to the great Article of the Equiva∣lent;
It had been offered at in the Article, and by
Consent reserred to a Committee, which Committee had spent
a great deal of Time upon it, had Examined all the Calcula∣tions
made by the Clerks imployed in <HI>London</HI> during the Trea∣ty,
had case up the Interests, and the Valuation of Years, to
reduce every Annual payment upon ready Money, upon equal
Rebates &amp; Allowances, and their Report was now brought in,
by which it appears, That the Calculations made in <HI>England</HI>
were very just, so that no Objection lay against that part of
the Work.</P>
<P>“The first Question then was Why <HI>Scotland</HI> should concern
it self in paying <HI>Englands</HI> Debts at all, and on this Head it is
neceslary to be something large, since the Learned Dcbates on
this Head silled the whole Nation, and the Opposers of the
Union advanced abundance of Objections against the very
Thing called an Equivalent, in the sirst place, as needless and
impertinent; That <HI>England</HI> should pay its own Debts, and
keep her own Money, and the like; That, to make <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="411"/>
pay Taxes, and then give her an Equivalent, was doing no∣thing
as to Equalities, for that tho' it might be an Equality,
Nationally speaking, it had no Persoual Justice or Equality at
all, since the private Persons that should pay ir, would never
receive any Equivalent for the Injury they received.</P>
<P>Some Answers to this I shall set down here, as they were
argued in the House, and after made publick by an Honou∣rable
Member of the Parliament, now Baron of the Exchequer
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clark of Pennycook.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>“1. That no Communication of the Trade of <HI>England</HI>
can be given to the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> unless we are sa∣tissied
to pay equal Customs and Duties upon Export and
Import, and equal Excises. The reason is plain, for other∣wise
the Merchants residing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would be put in a
Condition to Ruine the whole Trade of <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>“2. That an <HI>Equality of Excises</HI> in both Kingdoms, is as
necessary as an <HI>Equality of Customs for not only all imme∣diate</HI>
Burdens on <HI>Trade</HI> are to be regarded, but even these
things which Affect and Influence Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>`3. That tho' a <HI>Federal Union</HI> was Practicable between
the two kingdoms (as I believe it is not) yet even by
that Union, we behoved to undergo the Burden of equal
Customs and Excises, otherwise there could be no Com∣munication
of Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>“4. That a great part of <HI>the</HI> English <HI>Customs and Excises</HI>
is appropriated tow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ards Payment of their Debts' so that
the paying of the English Debts, and the paying of equal
Customs and Excises, are almost reciprocal Terms to signi∣fie
one and the same thing, or otherwise, that these Cu∣stoms
and Excises payed after the Union, will be appro∣priated
towards paying our own Debts, which is the same,
as shall more fully appear hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>“5. That these Debts (being after the Union, to be
called <HI>The Debts of</HI> Great-Britain) are so necessary and in
evitable Burdens on <HI>Scotland,</HI> that neither by an Incorpo∣ting
or Federal Union with <HI>England,</HI> can <HI>Scotland</HI> be free
of 'em, since as is said before, they are included and wrap∣ped
up in the very Notion of equal Customs and Excises.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>“From these Positions it follows, That since under all
forts of Union whatsomever, with a Communication of
Trade we must be Subjected to <HI>equal Customs and Excises,</HI>
and that a great part ot these is applyed towards Payment
of the <HI>Debts of</HI> England, therefore in common Justice, a
Provision behoved to be made to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for re-imbursing
what we shall be charged on the Score of these Debts,
which by <HI>this Article of the Treaty,</HI> is called <HI>An Equivalent.</HI></P>
<P>“This <HI>Equivalent</HI> is so Contrived and Adjusted, that
thereby we cannot properly look on our selves as engaged
<PB N="112" REF="412"/>
in the <HI>English</HI> Debts, for no Man can be properly said to
pay a Debt for another, when the Money is either advan∣ced
before hand to the Payer, or at furthest, the next Mo∣ment
after it is payed out, which will be <HI>Scotlands</HI>
Case.</P>
<P>It was evident that a Communication of Trade was the In∣terest
`of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was the clearest Advantage on the
<HI>Scots</HI> side, and most Unexceptionable in the whole Treaty;
It was impossible this Communication of Trade could be E∣stablished,
and could be entirely Free, unless an Equality of
Customs, Excises, and of all sorts of Payments were settled
at the same Time; So that these People who were so back∣ward
to come into the <HI>English</HI> Debts, were leading into a Re∣jecting
the only Advantage, which they themselves acknow∣ledged
was to be had by the Union.</P>
<P>“The Equality of Excises and Customs being thus absolute∣ly
necessary, the <HI>English</HI> Debts came to be concerned, be∣cause
the Customs and Excises of <HI>England</HI> being appropri∣ated
as Funds to pay the interests of Annuities, and such In∣cumbrances,
the same Duties in <HI>Scotland</HI> would of course run
in the same Channel, come into the same Charge, and
under the same Incumbrances, as it could not be otherwise,
without running Things into all manner of Confusion.</P>
<P>“The Treaters in <HI>London</HI> had been convinc'd of this, and
therefore readily came into it, demanding an Equivalent to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> suited to so much of the <HI>Scots</HI> Revenue, as should be
so appropriated to the payment of the <HI>English</HI> Debts.</P>
<P>“But it was the hardest Thing in the World, to make the
People in <HI>Scotland</HI> apprehend it—; Not but that those
who were more immediately concern'd in the Debating it,
understood it well enough; But it serv'd as a Handle to Rally
the Union, &amp; the Thing being rendred as Intricate to the com∣mon
People as possible, that they might be the more moved
to Oppose it; These Ignorantly running away with a Noti∣on,
that <HI>Scotland</HI> was to pay the <HI>English</HI> Debts, began to Rage
at the Treaters again, and cry out, They were Sold and Betray∣ed;
to tell them of an Equivalent, was to say nothing, and
as, many did not understand it, so they that did, would not
seem to understand it; the very Word became Proverbial,
and was the Jest of Conversartion, till the Aversion to it ren∣red
it in a manner Contemptible. To bring <HI>Scotland</HI> in to
pay the <HI>English</HI> Debts! What was not <HI>Scotland</HI> Poor enough
already? Was this the Advantage of the Union! It could
not be suffered, and the Treaters had Betrayed them: Such
Discourse as this was the Subject of the common Peoples Con∣versation,
and the Answering them with the story of an E∣quivalent
to be paid them, was to tell them something which
they neither understood, nor entered into the Examination
of.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="413"/>
“It would be very hard to describe, how this kind of Dis∣course
irritated the poor People, and how they were imposed
upon in the daily Accounts spread of this new Wonder, cal∣led
<HI>The Equivalent,</HI> of which Calculations were made publick,
representing, That in a year <HI>Scotland</HI> would Repay all the
Money advanced from <HI>England,</HI> by the increase of Customs
and Excises; &amp; so alter that Rate, notwithstanding of the Equi∣valent,
<HI>Scotland</HI> would be drawn into an Entail of Taxes for
an Hundred Years, to clear off the vast Debt of Twenty Mil∣lions,
which <HI>England</HI> was now liable to.</P>
<P>“I shall have occasion to Answer this in a subsequent Observa∣tion.
But I can not but <HI>Note,</HI> That by a due Calculation laid be∣fore
the Parliament, it was made very plain, That <HI>England</HI>
would be so far irom being Re-imburst in a Year, <HI>as above,</HI>
that reckoning the common, Interest of the Money advanced
in the Equivalent, wirh the <HI>medium</HI> of Years in which great
part of the Duties the other People bad Calculated from, was
to Expire, the Equivalent Advanced in Money to <HI>Scotland</HI>
would not be Re-payed in Ninety Years.</P>
<P>“Yet was not all this able to Allay the Prejudices of the
People, at the Affair of paying the <HI>English</HI> Debt, which they
run away with so eagerly, and so universally Raged against,
that had not the Rabbles been in good time Crush'd before,
and that so effectually, that they could not begin again, it
was thought this very thing would have Influenced them to
a more dangerous Degree than anything.</P>
<P>“But this was offer'd by degrees, the Work of this Day was
only to Debate the first Clause, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> should
be Intirely free from the <HI>English</HI> Debts, or whether they should
come in to the Appropriations of the <HI>English</HI> Duties, accep∣ting
of an Equivalent, and after a very Warm Debate, the
Case was carried, as by the Minute.</P>

viz. The Committee of Parliament appointed for considering the
Sixth Article of the Treaty of Union and Proposals made in Parliament
relative thereto, having considered the Clause under-written, anent the
Praemiums and Rewards for Exporting of Victual, <HI>are of Opinion, that
the Clause after-mentioned be added to the Article of Union, where∣of
the Tenor follows, Viz.</HI> And seing by the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> not∣withstanding
there are Rewards granted upon the Exportation of certain
kinds of Grain, wherein Oats Grinded or Ungrinded are not specified,
That from and after the Union when Oats shall be at Fifteen shilling

other Grains, and that the Bear of <HI>Scotland</HI> have the same Rewards as
Barley.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>“The Commmittee to whom the several Articles about Trade
were refer'd, began now to make their Reports, and begin∣ning
with the Sixth Article concerning Equalities of Allow∣ances
and Encouragements, they made their Report about the
Allowances on Exporting <HI>Victual,</HI> by which is understood Corn
only, which is commonly called <HI>Victual</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“The Allowance here offered by the Committee, was on
these Considerations,^ It had been used in <HI>England</HI> to give a
Bounty or Allowance on the Exportation of Grair, to En∣courage
the Merchant to Export it, being a sure Rule in Trade,
that all the meer Product of the Earth which can be spared
and Exported Abroad, over and above the necessary Con∣sumption
of the Nation, is clear Gain to the publick Stock.</P>
<P>“But Oats in <HI>England</HI> had no Allowance or Bounty on the
Exportation, because it was generally supposed. That <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
had never any Quantity of Oats to spare more than they
Consumed among themselves, but were rather alwise ready to
Buy Oats from Abroad, than to Export them.</P>
<P>“On the other hand. Oats being the principal kind of
Grain Sowed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was equally necessary to Encourage
the Exporting of Oats, as it was to Encourage the Exporting
Wheat in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“But this was Answered, by telling them, that there was
no need of proposing a Bounty upon the Exportation of Oats.
for thet <HI>England</HI> would always take off what ever Quantity of
Oats they would part with, and to offer a Bounty for Expor∣tation
of that Abroad, which was really wanted at Home,
<PB N="115" REF="415"/>
was Absurd, contrary to the Rules of Trade, and the
Nature of the Thing. <HI>Further</HI> it was offered, That should a
Bounty be offer'd on the Exportation of Oats, the Out-po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts
in <HI>England,</HI> who now supply <HI>London,</HI> lying ready for the Trade
to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> would send all their Oats Abroad, and
<HI>London</HI> would not be supplyed but upon dear Rates.</P>
<P>“These Arguments prevailed with the Committee as to
Oats, but there being a very Gainful Trade carried on from
<HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Norway</HI> for Oat-Meal which it was worth while
to encourage, as a Trade that Generally brought into <HI>Scotland</HI>
a great deal oi Bullion, and Money in <HI>specie,</HI> the Committee
thought fit to place a Bounty upon the Exportation of the
Oat-Meal, as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, and the state of the Time when
the said Bounty should be paid being fix'd, when Oats shall
be no higher than Fifteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter, there could be
no danger, that the greatness of the Export should Iufluence
the Market at <HI>London,</HI> so as to make Oats Scarce or Deal,
since after they came to Fifteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter, no Boun∣ty
Money could be demanded.</P>
<P>“This was founded upon so just a Calculation of Equalities
in Trade, that it met with no Opposition in the Parliament.</P>

<P><HI>Thereafter a Proposal given in for a further Addition to the Sixth
Article, in these Terms,</HI> viz. And that there be likewise a <HI>Proemium</HI>
allowed for the Exportations of Oats proportionally with the Meal, Compl∣ing

<HI>Allow a</HI> Proemium <HI>on the Exportation of Oats, or not?</HI> and it

Article is remitted, was brought in, and read in these Terms;</HI>
The Committee of Parliament appointed for considering the Sixth Article
of the Treaty of Union, and Proposals made in Parliament relative
thereto; Having Considered the Clause, under written, are of Opinion,
That it shonld be added to the Articles of Union as follows; And in
respect the Importation of Victual into <HI>Scotland</HI> from any place beyond
Sea would prove a Discouragement to Tillage; Therefore, That the Pro∣hibition,
as now in Force by the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> against Importation
of Victual from <HI>Ireland,</HI> or any other place beyond Sea into <HI>Scotland,</HI>
do after the Union, remain in the same Force, as now it is.</P>
<P>And after some Reasoning, it was proposed to add to the above
Report the subsequent Clause, <HI>viz. Until more proper and effectual
ways be provided by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for discouraging
the Importation of the said Victual from beyond Sea:</HI> And alter some
further Reasoning, the said second Report was agreed to, And it
was put to the Vote, <HI>Add the above Clause to the said Report,</HI> or <HI>not,</HI>
and it carried <HI>Add.</HI></P>
<P>Thereafter an Overture for an Act for Additional <HI>Proemiums</HI> on
Exportation of Victual, to commence the first of <HI>February,</HI> and to
end the last of <HI>April</HI> both next to come <HI>inclusive,</HI> given in and read;
And agreed, That the same be taken into Consideration immediate∣ly
after the Reports relating to the Sixth Article of Union.</P>
<P><HI>Then a Third Report brought in from the said Committee was
read in these Terms;</HI> The Committee of Parliament appointed for
considering the Sixth Article of the Treaty of Union, and Proposals
made in Parliament relative thereto'; Having considered the Clause
mentioned in the Twenty Seventh Days Minutes, anent the Making
and Exporting of Plaiding, Fingrams Galloway-Whites Sarges,
Stockings, and all sorts of Linen to <HI>England,</HI> Dominions and Planta∣tions
thereof, or any part beyond Sea, free of any Duty or Impostion;
and having considered the <HI>English,</HI> Acts of Parliament relative there∣unto,
particularly the 32 <HI>Act primo Gulielmi &amp; Mariae,</HI> and the
Twenty <HI>Act Gul. undecimo &amp; duodecimo,</HI> in regard there appears
to be no Restraint at present, regulating the way and manner of mak∣ing
<HI>English</HI> Woollen Cloaths and others to be Exported, and that all
the Woollen Manufactures are declared to be free of Party and Impo∣sition
whatsoever at Exporting, and that, by the said Sixth Article
of the Treaty of Union, all parts of the United Kingdom are to have
the same Allowances and Encouragements; Therefore the Committee
are of Opinion, That the adding the foresaid Clause to the Articles
of Treaty is unnecessary.</P>
<P>And after Debate the Vote was put, <HI>Approve of the said Third Re∣port
or not;</HI> and it carried <HI>Approve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thereafter a Fourth Report was brought in from the said Commit∣tee,

Consideration of the Sixth Article of Union, and Proposals made ip
Parliament relative thereto, are Remitted; Having considered that

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>“Notwithstanding what was argued in the Committee,
which I have noted above, and at which I was present, having
had the Occasion to make several of these Calculations for the
Service of the said Committee: Some Gentlemen in the Par∣liament
insisted upon the allowing a Drawback or Bounty
Money upon Exportation <HI>of Oats;</HI> but when the same Rea∣sons
mentioned above, which had been argued in the Com∣mitee,
came to be offered in full Parliament, it was so con∣vincing,
that they soon acquiesc'd, and so it was carryed
without, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>“The subsequent Reports of the Committee mentioned in
this Days Minutes, seemed only to add the Authority of the
Committees Examinations to what had before been offered in
Publick, <HI>viz.</HI> That, after the Union, the Exportation of
Linen and Woollen Manufactures would be free, and the se∣veral
Manufactures be under no Restraint or Regulations, but
that either in transporting them to <HI>England,</HI> or Exporting
them to Foreign Parts, all was open and free by the Union.</P>
<P>“And this Report of the Committee was a full Proof of
what I have all along alledged, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Common People
of <HI>Scotland</HI> were intolerably imposed upon, in the Accounts
spread abroad relating especially to Trade, and in this in par∣ticular,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Woollen and Linen Manufacture
would be subjected to several Restictions and Regulations in
<HI>England,</HI> which could not be complyed with.</P>
<P>“This was grounded upon an Office in <HI>England,</HI> granted by
Patent some Years since, which was called the Aulnage, which
amounted to no more, than putting a Seal and demanding a
Fee upon every parcel of Woollen Manufactures brought to
<HI>London,</HI> under pretence of Viewing if they were Marketable
—; But this Duty or Fee being a very small Trifle, and
the Power of Inspecting found deficient, it was of no Force
at al), and therefore, upon the Committees Examining this,
they saw no Ground of Objection.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="418"/>
“The next Objection was about Exportation, and here it
is observable, That the Opposers of the Union had not only
suggested, but openly printed, and exposed about the Streets
such Absurdities as these. That the <HI>Scots</HI> Linen would not
be admitted into <HI>England,</HI> but a great Duty would be laid
upon it to gratifie the <HI>Dutch;</HI> That great Duties were to be
paid upon both Linen and Woollen Manufactures on their
Exportation, and the like. Now it was very happy, that these
things came to be Considered and Examined by a Committee.</P>
<P>“For now it was evident,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>“1. That no Duty could be laid on the Transporting
any Linen or Woollen Goods from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI>
which were the Growth or Manufacture of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
Article of Communication of Trade having effectually
taken off all Impositions between the Counties or Shires
of all <HI>Great-Britain</HI> equally to all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As to the Duty on Woollen Goods, there never
was any Duty paid Outward, but what was called the
Old Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, which was Five
<HI>per Cent.</HI> which had been effectually taken off, &amp; that Act
Repealed in the Act of Parliament mentioned in the Re∣port,
and no Duty at all was paid on any Woollen Ma∣nufacture
whatever Exported out of <HI>England,</HI> and by
Consequence could not be out of <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>“3. All Linen Cloth was so free, That the Duty on
Cloth Imported to <HI>England</HI> from Foreign Parts, was
all drawn back, by Certificate on the Exporting it sgain,
in order to encourage the said Exportation, and for
Linen Exported made in <HI>Britain,</HI> it was so small a
Trifle paid, <HI>viz.</HI> Sixpence on Fourty Ells, that it was
not worth notice.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>“This Report of the Committee put a great Stop to the Cla∣mours,
that had been so loud upon the Article of Trade;
and when this Vote was made publick, the People began to
see they were imposed upon, and that these things in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
were misrepresented.</P>

<P>A Seventh Report was brought in from the said Committee, and

shall be free from and no ways subject to the Prohibitions against
Exporting of Wooll, Sheep and Lambs Skins with Wooll upon
them, and Woollen Yarn, for the space therein mentioned, after
full Reasoning thereanent, The Committee are of Opinion, that
die foresaid Clause ought not to added to the Articles of the

`That there shall be an Encouragement provided to the Heretors of

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>“There was a Clause in the Treaty for the reserving all pri∣vate
Rights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as <HI>per</HI> the 20th Article Now some of these private
Rights amounted to Exemption from certain Customs &amp; Excises,
as particular Privileges to this or that Place or Person, as at
<HI>Glasgow</HI> for Encouragement of their Sugar-works, they are Ex∣empted
from paying any Excise for the Spirits they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Distill
from the Melasses, Bottoms, Scummings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so in
several Towns they were Exempted from such and such Cu∣stoms—;
These were of necessity to be Exempted, because
by another Article as above, private Rights on both sides
were to be preserved.</P>
<P>“Now, as this was for <HI>Scotland</HI> on one hand, so it was for
<HI>England</HI> on another, for the City of <HI>Carlisle</HI> and the Family of
Sir <HI>Christopher Musgrave</HI> had an ancient Right of taking Toll
of all the Cattel which passed from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> over
such Passes or Bridges as they had the Lordship of, and these
by private Rights were actually reserved.</P>
<P>“But the Committee having demanded here the taking away
the Toll, <HI>payed at above,</HI> the private Right on the <HI>English</HI> side
ceased; So that what seem'd solid and confirm'd by the Uni∣on
in one part, was yet Invaded and taken away by ano∣ther—.
But to Reconcile this Matter, the Parliament of
<HI>England</HI> Interposed, and when some People thought they had
now brought their Affair to a Head, and that now the Trea∣ty
must break, behold, a <HI>Medium</HI> was found out in <HI>England,
viz.</HI> That the Parliament in <HI>England</HI> Bought these private
Rights of the City of <HI>Carlisle</HI> and of the Family of Sir <HI>Chri∣stopher
Musgrace,</HI> and giving them an Equivalent for them,
they Acquiesced, and all ways were laid open for all manner of
<HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Goods to Pass and Repass without any Toll,
Stoppage, or Interruption, whether Cattle or Corn, or any
other kind of Goods except such as (<HI>Scotland</HI> being Ex∣empted
from the Taxes of in this Treaty for a Time, or
not to be carried into <HI>England</HI> during that Limited Time, or
if they were carried in, were lyable to the <HI>English</HI> Duties as
soon as they came into <HI>England,</HI> such as Salt, Coals, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Mak, Fish
Cur'd with <HI>Scos</HI> Salt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As is more particularly Explained
Hereafter.</P>
<P>“Thus the private Rights in <HI>Scotland</HI> were preserred intire,
according to the Treaty, and in <HI>England</HI> also, for it they were
Invaded by the Treaty, the Subject had such satisfaction gi∣ven
him in Money, as that he appeared willing to Resign
those Rights.—, as the City of <HI>Carlisle</HI> for instance, who,
I think, had Two Thousand Five Hundred Pound <HI>Sterling</HI>
given them, for parting with the Right of Toll upon <HI>Scots</HI>
Cattle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="422"/>
“In this exact Equality, the Sixth Report of the Commit∣tee
about <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle, became as it were settled; but it was
Objected, That the Parliament might hereafter lay on a par∣ticular
Tax upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle passing into <HI>England,</HI> either in
Favours of the <HI>Irish</HI> Cattle, or upon any other subsequent Oc∣casion
which could not be foreseen; And therefore, the send∣ing
Lean Cattle from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> being such a
considerable Article to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and on which the Estates of
the Northern Gentry did almost wholly depend, all their
R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents being paid them in Cattle, for which they had no other
Vent or Market but their being sent into <HI>England,</HI> and that
any Tax or Toll being hereafter laid on them, might intire∣ly
put a stop to it, and consequently Impair, and almost
Ruine the Estates of the Gentry and Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
On this Consideration, it was thought sit by the Committee,
to secure <HI>Scotland</HI> effectually from so much as a Jealousie or
Uneasiness about it, by making it a Part of the Union, That
<HI>From and after the Union, no</HI> Scots <HI>Cattle carried into</HI> England
shall be liable to any other Duties either publick or private than
the Cattle of England. This was again an Article of Equality,
for the Case was, not to Exempt the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle intirely from
any Tax, which the United Parliament might think fit to
lay on Cattle in General, if ever the Article of General Ex∣cises
so much talk'd of in <HI>England,</HI> should be offered at; but
to bring the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle upon a Level with all the rest of the
Cattle in <HI>England;</HI> and to provide that <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle, <HI>Qua</HI>
Scots <HI>Cattle,</HI> should be under no particular National Disad∣vantage
—; And this was thought Reasionable on every side.</P>
<P>“The Seventh Report of the Committee requires some Ex∣plication
on several Accounts—, It was true, and no Que∣tion
was to be made of it, That <HI>Scotland</HI> having then an
open Trade with <HI>France</HI> without Restriction, and that their
Wooll was under no Prohibition at all, but freely Exported
to <HI>France,</HI> or any other Part of the World, and that this Li∣berty
being by the Union to be absolutely and intirely Re∣strained,
the Prices of Wooll in <HI>Scotland</HI> would of course
very much Fall, and the Gentlemen of the South and West
a Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> such as in <HI>Roxburgh</HI> Shire, <HI>Selkirk, Txweed∣dale,
and Galloway,</HI> whose Estates very much consisted in the
Product of their Sheep, would receive a very sensible Blow
by it; Tho' it was remarkable that some People was for gi∣ving
all <HI>Britain</HI> a worse Blow, to prevent the Injury done to
those Countries, <HI>viz.</HI> To allow Exporting the Wooll, and
some Warm Debates were upon this Head.</P>
<P>`To Explain this, it was to be Enquired into, under what
kind of Influence, and by whose Management the Trade of
<HI>Scotland</HI> was at first laid open, and the Exporting of Wooll
permitted in General; This as it produc'd no Effect, but the
ripping up old Sores, and reviving Personal and Party Re∣flections
<PB N="123" REF="423"/>
flections, I shall let Fall. But this was certain, That whoever
were the Occasion of it, the Shipping off the Wooll from
<HI>Scotland,</HI> was very Injurious to the publick Advantage of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> a Mortal Wound given to the Industry of the Peo∣ple,
discouraging all Attempts of Manufacturing among them,
which they were now coming into, and which their Neigh∣bours
of <HI>England</HI> had so much been Enriched by: It was ap∣parent,
That the small Exportation they formerly had of
coarse Woollen Manufactures to <HI>Swedeland</HI> and the <HI>Baltick,</HI> was
now almost brought to a full Stop, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> on the con∣trary
took their Wooll from <HI>Scotland,</HI> which they had not
been used to do, by which it was apparent, they having the
Wooll, made the Manufactures themselves, and this was a
dead Loss to <HI>Scotland,</HI> just so much as the Employment and
Labour of their Poor amounted to.</P>
<P>“From this part of National Ill Husbandry, no Body could
be supposed to receive any Benefit, except the Exporter and
the Wooll Master, so they call the Gentlemen of <HI>Galloway,
Roxburgh</HI> Shire, &amp;c. whose Estates are very much depend∣ing
upon Sheep.</P>
<P>“This being the Occasion of the Rising the Prices of their
Wooll, and their Advantage being thus begun in the Error
and Injury of their Country, it seemed to be no National
Affair to make good the Loss that was supposed now to hap∣pen
by the Union; which was indeed but reducing Things to
where they were before, and taking away that Advantage,
which, if the Eyes of their Representatives in former Par∣liaments
had been open, they had never had, and which it
was the great Loss of the whole Kingdom, that they ever
had at all.</P>
<P>“However the Parliament, who, going upon the great
Scheme of Equalities so often mentioned, appeared willing to
make all People easy; were ready and forward enough to
have an Allowance by way of Equivalent given to the
Gentlemen that were Sheep Masters, and who should be
pinched by the falling of the price of their Wooll; but
then it was debated, in what manner that Equivalent should
be given, for, to give to particular Persons such and such a
Sum of Money, would seem partial, and be short of the
Design; as it would be some Personal Satisfaction indeed, but
no National Satisfaction: The Money given therefore ought
to be for the Publick Good; and this could be by no Method
so exactly stated to the Circumstance, as by appropriating
the Money to such Gentlemen, who being Wooll Masters,
would apply that Money to the Manufacturing that Wooll
in their own Country; thereby both encreasing the Consump∣tion
of the Wooll, and setting the Poor of their respective
Countries to Work—; This Scheme had too much Equi∣ty
in it, and too much of the Publick Good in it to be dis∣liked,
<PB N="124" REF="424"/>
nor did those that opposed it pretend to object much
against the Reasonableness of it, but still it was opposed,
and the Reasons for which it was opposed were manifest.</P>
<P>The Party, who, as I have all along noted, sought some
Occasion or other to break off the Treaty, had now this Me∣thod
only left, <HI>viz.</HI> To clog the Affair with such Amendments
or Alterations, which they knew <HI>England</HI> either would not
or could not grant—; Nor did they stick in Conversati∣on
honestly to owner, That they did not dislike the Reasons
of several Things that they opposed, were they consenting
to the Union in general, but they were <HI>against the UNION,</HI>
and therefore they were obliged to oppose the Particulars,
in order to oppose the General.</P>
<P>These Gentlemen therefore very warmly argued for a Free∣dom
of Expertarion of Wooll, and for having it made a
Clause in the Articles; which, if they had gain'd, they easily fore∣saw
the Union must split upon that R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k, for that <HI>England,</HI>
who have made it Felony, and always prohibited the Export
of their Wooll under the greast Penalties, neither would or
indeed could come i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to it.</P>
<P>“It was urged, this Liberty of Exporting Wooll migght be
restrained to <HI>Scotland</HI> only; That it was absolutely necessary
to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for that they could not Mam ficture all their
Wooll in their own Country; That their Wool was oarse,
and did not injure the <HI>English</HI> Trade, since all their Manu∣factures
were of Fine Wooll; Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it <HI>Scotland</HI> could not
Manufacture their Wooll, nor should be suffered to Export it,
the Wooll would be of no Use, but must perish, and be good
for nothing; That the Manufactures now set up in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
being chiefly Fine Goods, were generally made of <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Wooll, and after the Union, the Wooll from <HI>England</HI> be∣ing
generally brought in th ther, the Wooll <HI>of Scotland</HI> would
be of no manner of Value.</P>
<P>“But these Arguments were Answered thus, That, to allow
the Exportation of Wooll from <HI>Scotland</HI> only, would oblige
the Government to keep still on the Borders, an Army of Offi∣cers,
to Search and Examine the Paslage of all Goods passing
between the Kingdoms, and keep up that Distinction of King∣doms,
which, as to Trade, as well as Government, was to
be wholly taken away by the Union—; That, after all,
it would be impossible to prevent the carrying of Wooll into
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and consequently the Exportation of <HI>English</HI>
Wooll with, or instead of <HI>Scots</HI> Wooll.</P>
<P>“In the next place, this would oblige the Government of
<HI>Britain</HI> to a strict Prohibition of the bringing any <HI>English</HI>
Wooll into <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, lest the same should be
Exported, which, after its being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> could not be so
distinguish'd as to be prevented; and that this Prohibition
would Rob <HI>Scotland</HI> of all that Advantage which it is propo∣sed
<PB N="125" REF="425"/>
she shall enjoy after the Union, by her People being im∣ployed
in the Manufacturing of <HI>English</HI> Wooll.</P>
<P>“Again, That this would destroy all Freedom of Commerce
and Communication of Trade between the Kingdoms, that
all Vessels to and from <HI>Scotland</HI> must be Visired and Searched
equally with Strangers, and the Face of an Union be russled
with continued Jealousies of, and Watchings against Clande∣sine
Trade.</P>
<P>“Lastly, That it was inconsistent with the Publick Good of
<HI>Scotland</HI> in its Proportion, as much as of <HI>England,</HI> and that
it would effectually destroy the Hopes of <HI>Scotlands</HI> Encreasing
in Manufactures, and Encouraging her Trade by the imploy∣ment
of her Poor.</P>
<P>“As to the Consumption, it was urged, That <HI>England</HI> was
always a Market for Wooll, where it might be sold without
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail, at some Price or other; and if the Price was low just
then, that was but a common Calamity the Effect of the long
War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> in which they had still a Share
with their Neighbours, but that the Wooll of <HI>Scotland</HI> would
always fell as well as the Wooll of <HI>England,</HI> in Proportion
to its Fineness; And this led of Course to the first Propo∣sal,
That what Encouragement was possible to be given to
the Wooll Msters by the Treaty, should be given them on
the Conditions of setting the Poor to Work in their res∣pective
Countries, which, in that Case, would have this
double Advantage, 1. The Employment and Subsistence of
the Poor; and, 2. The Consumption of the Wooll at
Home, which directly took off the pretended Necessity of
Exporting it to other Countries, for want of a Vent of it at
Home, or their sending it to <HI>England</HI> to be sold, as they cal∣led
it, for little or nothing: How well this Money was
paid after the Union, or when paid, how well applyed to
the Common Good or <HI>Scotland,</HI> is none of my Business here
to enquire.</P>
<P>“I have been the longer in stating this Case because
it has been often objected to the <HI>Scots</HI> Members of Parlia∣ment,
That they were too Forward to comply with the
Prohibition of Wooll, and that their Country lost a great
Advantage by it.</P>
<P>“There was a pretended Expedient then offered, about
the manner of Disposing the Equivalent to such Persons,
as had such or such certain Quantities of Tarr'd Wooll;
but the Reasonableness of the above Proposal prevailed
against any other, and therefore it needs not be enquir∣ed
into.</P>

<P><HI>An Eighth Report from the Committee, to whom the Sixth Ar∣ticle
of Union was Remitted, brought in and read in these Terms,</HI>
viz. The Committee of Parliament, to whom the Sixth Article of the
Treaty was Remitted, having Considered the Remit to them, with the
Books of Rates both for <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and the several Acts of
Parliament relating thereto, the Schemes or Abstracts from the Custom-House
Books given in to them from the Council of Trade, and the Report
thereanent of their Sub-Committee, who, on a Report from them, had compar∣ed
the Customs and Duties on Export and Import settled in <HI>England</HI> with
these settled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had calculated the Duties payable in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
upon Tarr, Tobacco, Iron, Dails, single and double Trees, Lint
and Lintseed, and compared the same with the Duties payable upon the
same Goods in <HI>England,</HI> at a <HI>Medium</HI> of the Three Years, whereof they
had the said Abstracts from the Custom-House Books: <HI>They find,</HI> That,
as to the Customs and Duties on Export and Import in general, the Cu∣stoms
in <HI>Scotland</HI> belong to the Crown, and are perpetual, whereas there
in <HI>England</HI> terminate at a certain Number of Years, <HI>viz.</HI> About Two
Fifteen Parts thereof at 8<HI>th</HI> March 1709 Years, Nine Fifteen Parts
thereof at <HI>1st. August</HI> 1710, about Three Fifteen Parts thereof continue
only during Her Majestics Life, and about One Fifteen Part thereof for
Ninety Five Years; And that the Duties upon Exportation, which were
granted <HI>12 Car. 2. Cap.</HI> 4. are easie, have never been augmented, save
upon a very few particulars, and terminate the first of <HI>August</HI> 1710;
That these Goods which contribute to Luxury, and those that are Manu∣factured,
or can be had within the Island, are those that pay high Duties
when Imported, but that the whole, or most of the Customs and Duties
paid at Importation, are drawn back upon Exportation, if Exported
within a certain time, except a Moi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of Old Subsidy which is very small,
and which is imposed by the foresaid Act <HI>12<SUP>e</SUP> Car. 2. Cap.</HI> 4. and terminates
the first of <HI>August 1710;</HI> That the Duties upon the before-men∣tioned
Goods, at the above <HI>Medium</HI> payable in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the nearest
<PB N="127" REF="427"/>
Calculation can be made, amounts to 253184 <HI>l. 15 sh. 7 d.</HI> and now
payable in <HI>England</HI> to 413559 <HI>l. 8 sh. 4 d.</HI> and payable in <HI>England</HI> af∣ter
<HI>1710</HI> to <HI>129640 l. 9 sh. 8 d. Scots,</HI> and the Duties upon our Linen
Cloath and Cattel Imported into <HI>England,</HI> by the above <HI>Medium,</HI> a∣mounts
to <HI>272629 l. 3 sh. 10 d.</HI> Money foresaid: <HI>So that it is the
Opinion of the Committee,</HI> The Duties after <HI>1710</HI> will be much easier
than now they are, and even, as they stand now payable in <HI>England,</HI>
considering the Duties that are upon <HI>Scots</HI> Goods Imported into <HI>England,</HI>
and taken off by the Treaty, the Customs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> taken together even
before the first of <HI>August</HI> 1710, will be easier than now they are.</P>
<P>And after some Reasoning thereon a state of a <HI>Vote was offered,</HI>
Approve of the Sixth Article of Union as Explained and Enlarged, or
Not.</P>
<P>But it being moved, That the Vote could not be stated in these

<P>Whereupon it was agreed, That what concerns the <HI>African</HI> Com∣pany
shall be i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tire, and be taken into Consideration under the
Fifteenth Article, and that the Approving of the Sixth Article shall
not be prejudicial thereto.</P>
<P>And the above state for a Vote being again proposed, after some
Debate, it was moved, That the said Article should be further
Amended; And thereupon a second state of a Vote was offered in
these Terms, <HI>Approve or Amend.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whereupon the said sixth Article, with the several Additions, En∣largements
and Explanations after-mentioned contained in several

Clauses of the said <HI>Article. Item,</HI> And semg by the Laws of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
notwithstanding there are Rewards granted upon Exportation of
certain kinds of Grain, wherein Oats Grinded or Ungrinded, are not
specified, that from and after the Union, when Oats shall be at Fif∣teen
Skillings <HI>Sterling per</HI> Quarter, or under, there shall be paid
Two Skillings and Six Pence <HI>Sterling</HI> for every Quarter of the Oat
Meal Exported in the Terms of the Law, whereby, and so long as
Rewards are granted for Exportation of other Grains, and that the
Bear of <HI>Scotland</HI> have the same Rewards as B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ley. <HI>Item,</HI> And in
respect the Importation of Vidual into <HI>Scotland</HI> from any part
beyond Sea, would prove a Discouragement to Tillage, Therefore,
That the Prohibitions as now in force by the Law of <HI>Scotland</HI> against
Importation of Vidual from <HI>Ireland,</HI> or any other place beyond Sea
into <HI>Scotland,</HI> do after the Union remain in the same force as now it
is, until more proper and effectual ways be provided by the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for discouraging the importation of the said
Vidual from beyond Sea. Item, Excepting and referring the Duties
upon Export and Import of such particular Commodities, from which
any Persons, the Subjects of either Kingdom, are specially liberated
and exempted by their private Rights, which, after the Union, are
to remain safe and intire to them in all respects as before the same.
<HI>Item,</HI> That, from and after the Union, no <HI>Scots</HI> Cattel carried into

are, or shall be lyable within the said Kingdom, <HI>being all read over,
it was put to the Vore, whether the first or second should be the
state of the Vote, and it carried,</HI> First.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>Approve of the said sixth Article En∣larged

to be marked thereon.</P>
<P>The Eighth Article of Union read, and the first Clause or Para∣graph
thereof was also again read.</P>
<P><HI>Whereupon a Report brought in from the Committee, to whom
the said Eighth Article is remitted, was read in these Terms,</HI> The
Committee, to whom the Eighth Article of Union anent Duties upon
Salt was remitted, are of Opinion, That, after the first Clause of the
said Article, an Explanation in the Terms following will be necessary.</P>
<P>But, in regard the Duties of great Quantities of Foreign Salt Im∣ported
may be very heavy upon the Merchants Importers; That there∣fore
all Foreign Salt Imported shall be Cellar'd and Lock'd up under the
Custody of the Merchant Importer, and Officers imployed for Levying the
Duties upon Salt; And that the Merchant may have what Quantities
thereof his Occasion may require, Not under a Wey, or Fourty Bushel at
a time, giving security for the Duty of what Quantity he receives pay∣able
in six Months.</P>
<P>And after some Reasoning thereon, the further Consideration of
the said Eighth Article and Report was delayed till the next <HI>Sede∣runt</HI>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The long Report of the Committee, on this Point of the
Customs is very distinct, but may require some Explanation, and
in order to that, it is necessary to enter into the short History
of the Reason of this Calculation.</P>
<P>“Two great Complaints ran through the whole Nation up∣on
the Subject of Taxes and Trade, 1. That the <HI>English</HI>
clog'd the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> with Intolerable Burdens. And
2. That they raised their Customs, and would Gain great
Sums of Money from <HI>Scotland</HI> by doing so; <HI>For the Scots had
no Notion of the Equivalent, nor would they for a along time after
this, entertain any Notion of it.</HI></P>
<P>“In order to clear up the Objections of the People against
the Customs, the particular Heads were referred to this Com∣mittee
to Examine.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="429"/>
“The first, were the Duties on Import, which the Com∣mittee
observed very well in <HI>England,</HI> is always laid highest
on such Goods as contribute to Luxury, or are Manufactured
within the Island, the first Esteem'd less necessary, such as
Wine, Brandy, Foreign Linen, Fruit, Druggs, East <HI>India</HI>
Goods, Coffee, Tea, Sugars, Tobacco, Deals, Timber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Things we might live without, or might supply in part at
Home; or being willing to have, and being Generally used
by the Richer sort of People, the payments are less felt. The
second, For the Encouragement of our own Poor, who
ought upon all occasions to be Employed; and if any thing
which comes from Abroad can be made at Home, that Home-part
ought to be Encouraged, by laying high Duties and
Imposts, or perhaps Prohibitions on the like from Abroad,
such are the Prohibitions of or high Duties, on wrought Silks,
Woollen Manufactures, Bone Lace, Brasil Sugar, wrought
Iron, Hats, Glass, Printed Callicoes, Pantiles, Earthen
Ware, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>“It was now Objected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the Customs
there would be very grievous, that the <HI>Engsish</HI> Duties on
Tar, Tobacco, Iron, Deals, and Timber, Lint and Lint-Seed,
would be Intolerable to the Poor, and raise the Customs of
<HI>Scotland</HI> to a very great Height.</P>
<P>“The Committee Examined the Proportions of Things, and
setting the whole upon an Equality, produc'd a very well
grounded Conclusion, That the Customs of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be
less to be paid after the Union than before; and it gave great
satisfaction at that time, to those People who were capable
of receiving Impressions from just Calculations, when the
Calculations of this Committee really stated the Ballance of
Trade, for that was casie to Draw out of these Calculations:
It had been offered in the Parliament, (with how little Founsdation,
or how much Assurance, I shall not determine);
(1.) That <HI>Scotland</HI> got nothing by the <HI>English</HI> Trade.
(2.) That <HI>Scotland</HI> were considerable Gainers by the <HI>French</HI>
Trade.</P>
<P>“I shall not Censure the People that offered this, as Aim∣ing
at a <HI>French</HI> Union, not an <HI>English;</HI> for they did not
stick to owne that, but it is not to the purpose here—;
I shall only consider the State of the Trade of either King∣dom,
as it stood at this Time, and as it was stated to the
Parliament.</P>

<HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> by above one half Part, the Consequence
of which, was, That the <HI>French</HI> Trade must draw away

the <HI>British</HI> Plantations, in Return for the Growth and Pro∣duce
of their own Countrey; So that the whole Trade to
<HI>England</HI> after the Union, would turn to the Interest and Ad∣vantage
of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“Nor can I omit to add the Experiment of this, to prove,
That these Calculations were not Suppositions and Remote,
since in the very first year after the Union, these Consequen∣ces
in Trade visibly appeared, and which of my own cer∣tain
Knowledge, I can take the Freedom to Advance.</P>
<P>“1. That on the falling of the <HI>English</HI> Duty on <HI>Scots</HI>
Linen, the Demand was so great for <HI>Scots</HI> Linen for the
<HI>English</HI> Markets, that it not only swept all the Linen
away, so that Two Months before the usual Time, the
whole Quantity was gone, and the <HI>English</HI> Merchants
could get no Linen for Money; but the whole Manu∣facture
<PB N="131" REF="431"/>
of Linen, advanced at least Two Pence an Ell
upon the finer <HI>Scots</HI> Linen, and One Penny <HI>per</HI> Ell on
the coarser sorts, which was a great Sum in the whole.</P>
<P>“. In the very first year after the Union, <HI>Scotland</HI>
Shipt away for <HI>England,</HI> besides several Ships Loaden
for <HI>Portugal</HI> and other Foreign parts, above 140000
Boll of Corn, above 40000 Boll of which was carried
out of the two small Counties of <HI>Merss</HI> or <HI>Berwick</HI> Shire
and <HI>Tiviotdale,</HI> 20000 Boll and more out of the single
County of <HI>Fife,</HI> and the rest from the Shires adjoyning
to the Firth, and some parts from the North.</P>
<P>“. In the first year after the Union, the <HI>Scots</HI> fitted out
several Ships, I think Seven or Eight, to the <HI>English</HI>
Plantations, Fraighted with their own Produce, the Re∣turn
of which being in Tobacco or Sugars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have
this Advantage to <HI>Scotland,</HI> That <HI>First,</HI> The said To∣bacco
and Sugars supply their own Consumption, and
keep that Mone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at Home, which used to go to <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and <HI>Holland</HI> to purchase their Supply. And <HI>2dly.</HI>
The Overplus which they can not Expend, they Export
to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which returns to the Advantage
of the publick Stock.</P>
<P>“4. In the very first year after the Union, <HI>Scotland</HI> had
Three or Four Ships Returned Home from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI>
bringing Home Wines from <HI>Leghorn</HI> and <HI>Galitia,</HI>
these being the Return of Fish from <HI>Scotland,</HI> could now
Return with their Fraights to their own Countrey, where
before, by reason of the <HI>French</HI> Wines, they could have
no Consumption, but were obliged to Load to other
Ports, and come Home Empty.</P>
<P>“If any Man pleases to calculate these things, and see the
Advantages of these Foreign Trades, and particular of the Eng∣lish,
and the Return of Money that must, by Consequence, be
made to <HI>Scotland</HI> Annually by such a Trade; and again, how
little of any kind of Goods <HI>Scotland</HI> takes from <HI>England</HI> in
the Room of it, except what they took from <HI>Holland</HI> before;
the Supposition of the Comparison between the <HI>English</HI> Trade
and the <HI>French</HI> Trade, as to an Advantage to <HI>Scotland,</HI> must
fall to the Ground, and the true State of the Ballance must
have been something like, if not exactly thus,</P>
<P>“That, in an open Trade with <HI>France, Scotland</HI> must
have paid <HI>France</HI> 100000 Pounds <HI>Sterling per Annum</HI> in
<HI>specie,</HI> or their Ballance of Trade would have been against
<HI>Scotland</HI> 100000 Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> at least.</P>
<P>“That, in the Trade with <HI>England, Scotland</HI> will re∣ceive
from <HI>England</HI> at least 200000 Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI>
in <HI>specie,</HI> or the Ballance of Trade will run on the side
of <HI>Scotland</HI> 200000 Pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>

White Fish, and Salmond, for Exportation, with Foreign Salt on∣ly,
and for preventing of Frauds in Curing and Packing of Fish,
was read; as also a Report brought in from the Committee for
adding a Clause thereto in these Terms, <HI>But in respect it appears from
the Books of the Royal Fisherie Company, confirmed by Practice, That the
Quantity of 102<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Pound Height Aver de Pois of Foreign Salt,
which pays Eight Shillings and Four Pence of Duty, is necessary for the
right Curing and Packing a Barrel of White Herrings, Therefore there

for every Barrel of White Herrings which shall be Exported, Ten Shil∣lings</HI>
Sterling.</P>
<P>Thereafter a Petition of the Salt Owners, Fishers of Herring

in, craving. That such Amendments might be made to the said
Eighth Article of Union, as would put them in an equal Footing
with their Neighbours in <HI>England,</HI> with regard to their Salt, and
also the Freedom of making Salt upon Salt.</P>
<P>Which being read, after some Debate thereon, and upon the
above last insert Report of the Committee, the further Considerati∣on
thereof was delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament.</P>
<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>“The Report of the Committee on the first Paragraph of
the Eighth Article is printed in the precedent Minute relating
to the Duties on Salt—; The payment of equal Duties on
Foreign Salt was not objected, but it was argued, That the
<HI>Scots</HI> Merchants being poor, and being nevertheless obliged
to Import large Quantities of Foreign Salt at the proper
Times, which must ly by till the Season for using the same,
and the Duties being now very large which were to be paid,
they might not be able either to advance the Money, or find
sufficient Security for the Duties, as the Law in that Case pro∣vided—;
And therefore this Amendment was made for
the Ease of the Merchant, which was both Reasonable to
the Government, and Easy to the Merchant, and took off all
pretence of Quarrel upon the Disburse of Money, or lying
out of Stock.</P>
<P>“The second Report upon the Eight Article was founded
upon equal Reasoning: It had been agreed in <HI>England</HI> in the
said Eighth Article, That all Flesh Salted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
carryed to <HI>England,</HI> or Flesh Salted in <HI>Scotland</HI> for Victualling
Ships or Exportation, should be Forfeited, it Cured with <HI>Scots</HI>
salt—; But this was counted a Hardship on several Ac∣counts,
and <HI>England</HI> being allowed to Cure all sorts of Flesh
with their own, whether for their own Consumption, Victual∣ling
of ships or Exportation, it ought to be also allowed to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> by virtue of the Subjects enjoying equal Allowances
and Restrictions, <HI>Article</HI> VI. Wherefore the Committee made
this Amendment, That the <HI>Scots</HI> might Cure Flesh with their
own Salt, provided all Flesh so Cured, that was either sent for
<HI>England,</HI> or used in Victualling Ships, or Exported for Sale,
should be charged with the Duty on Salt paid in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“<HI>The Third Report upon the Eighth Article concerned the
Laws in Force in</HI> Scotland <HI>for Curing and Packing of Herring,
White Fish and salmond, which, by this Article, were re∣served;
These Laws were the</HI> 5th. Act 3d. Session 1st. Parliament,
<PB N="134" REF="434"/>
King William &amp; Queen Mary, Appointing all Herrings &amp; Salmond
for Export be Made, Pined and Cured with French Bay, or Spa∣nish
Salt, or with Salt upon Salt made of Foreign Salt; The
24th. Act 7th. Session <HI>of the same Parliament,</HI> Confirming the
same, and Directing the Proof of it, <HI>with a Confirmation of
the</HI> 34th. Act of 2d. Session <HI>of the same Parliament, for Draw∣backs
on Herrings and Salmond Exported.</HI></P>
<P>“But, upon this new Treaty, respecting the <HI>English</HI> Duty
on Salt, it was calculated as you see in the Minute, That the
Salt commonly used in Curing a Barrel of Herring,
amounted to about Nine Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel; And in regard
of the Wasting of the Salt, Loss in carrying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they re∣solved
to put it at Ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, which fully An∣swered
the Petition of the Fish and Salt Merchants mentioned
in the same Minute.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XL.</HEAD>
<P>“The Report of the Committee last day was now only
Considered, with Relation to the main part of the Question,
Whether their Fish should be Cured with Foreign Salt only,
or not, and it was agreed, it should be so.</P>
<P>“It was counted a very great Hardship, That the Fish Cured
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> should not be Cured but with Foreign Salt; some
People alledging, That the Salt made in <HI>Scotland</HI> would
Cure the Herring as well as Foreign Salt—; But it had
been found by Experience, That the Fish Cured with <HI>Scots</HI>
Salt, did not keep, nor was it equal in Goodness when it
came to Market, which added to the Disputes which would
arise in the Article of the Drawbacks, now coming on to be
Debated, made the Parliament positive in that part, <HI>viz.</HI>
That all Fish Cured for Exportation, should be Cured with
Foreign Salt, without any Mixture of <HI>British</HI> Salt.</P>
<P>“In giving Drawbacks and Allowances for the Exportati∣on
of Fish, on Account of the Salt, it had here been impos∣sible
to come to an Equality, since no Officer could have been
sure which had been Cur'd with <HI>British</HI> Salt, and which with
Foreign Salt, and which with a Mixture of either.</P>
<P>“It was then alledged, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> Importing their
Salt from St. <HI>Ubies,</HI> Re-make the Salt, Boyling it again when
they come to <HI>Holland,</HI> which they call <HI>Salt upon Salt,</HI> and
that their Herring are Cur'd with the said Salt, which being
of a finer and subtiler Quality than the other Salt, is of Ad∣vantage
to their said Trades; and that the aforesaid Encourage∣ment
should be given to the <HI>Scots</HI> to do the same—; But
this came to nothing.</P>

also a Report brought in from the Committee to whom the said
Eighth Article was remitted insert in the Minutes of the 17th in∣stant,</HI>
Number 39. <HI>in these Terms;</HI> But in respect it appears from the

Quantity of <HI>102 108<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/1200</HI> of pound weight <HI>Aver de Pois</HI> of Foreign Salt,
which pays eight Shillings and four pence of Duty, is necessary for the

shall be paid during the present Allowances for other Fishes, for every
Barrel of White Herrings which shall be Exported, ten Shillings Ster∣ling.</P>
<P><HI>And another Report brought in from the said Committee was
also read, in these Terms,</HI> That sixteen Shillings and eight Pence upon

in the Finn to the third Joynt of the Tail; one Pound fifteen Shillings

and under twenty four Inches, and one Moiety of the foresaid
Allowance for every such Fish dryed, commonly called <HI>Haverdens,</HI> of the
like Dimensions (being the Drawbacks allowed by the <HI>English</HI> Laws
upon the Exportation of these Fishes) are sufficient Encouragements.</P>
<P>And after Reasoning on the above several Reports, it being

the present Allowances for other Fishes, for every Barrel of White
Herrings which shall be Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> ten Shillings and five

<P>Thereafter another Report brought in from the said Committee
was likewise read, in these Terms; <HI>That there ought to be no Draw∣back

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLI.</HEAD>
<P>“The Difficulty now lay about settling the Drawbacks upon
the Exportation of Fish—; and the Rule the Committee
had gone upon, seemed the readiest way to Determine it,
<HI>viz.</HI> They laid the <HI>English</HI> Drawbacks before them, and Exa∣mined
then the Quantity of Salt used in Curing every re∣spective
kind of Fish, and then comparing the whole, tryed
whether the Drawback allowed was adequate, and proporti∣oned
to the Duty paid upon the Quantity of Salt used in the
Curing.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="437"/>
“Now, tho' this was Exactly Calculated, and presented to
the House, yet several Motions and Speeches were made for
a larger Drawback, some alledged the necessity of Encou∣raging
the Fishery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that therefore the Govern∣ment
ought to make larger Allowances; but when they saw
that whatever the Allowance should be which they should
obtain, the <HI>English</HI> would obtain the same, they dropt that
part of the Argument.</P>
<P>“The Herrings indeed they had longer Debates about, and
after some Reasonings upon the Waste of the Salt, the Car∣riage
and other Pretences, They obtained the Allowance
of Ten Shillings and Five Pence to be paid to the Exporter,
for every Barrel of Herrings Cured with Foreign Salt and Ex∣ported,
which was Five Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel more than the Com∣mittee
had at first Determined.</P>

<P>Moved also, that the Consideration thereof be delayed till the

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Drawbacks proposed upon Beef and Pork to be Ex∣ported,
were now the Subject of Debate. it had been Examined
in the Committee, and they finding, That 1. The <HI>English</HI> had no
Allowance made them on Beef and Pork Cured for Exporta∣tion.
<PB N="138" REF="438"/>
And 2. That the Quantity of Beef and Pork so salted,
and Exported out of <HI>England,</HI> or out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was very
inconsiderable, had Reported, <HI>That there ought to be no
Drawbacks upon the Exportation of salted Beef and Pork,</HI> as in
the Minute of <HI>December</HI> 19th.</P>
<P>“But when this came to be Debated in the Parliament, it
was all Unravelled again; Some Gentlemen would have it
That <HI>Scotland</HI> was able to Export great Quantities of Beef,
Salted and Cured to Foreign Parts; Nay, some had before
carried it further, and in their Arguing for a Trade with
<HI>France,</HI> had advanced what had never before been heard of,
<HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Scotland</HI> should supply <HI>France</HI> with Beef, as they
have formerly been supplyed from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and proposed in∣finite
Advantages from such a Trade—.</P>
<P>“But these Gentlemen were soon silenced, when it was Ex∣amined
a little, upon what Conditions, and in what Quanti∣ties
<HI>Ireland</HI> was able to supply, and did supply, not <HI>France</HI>
and our Island Colonies only, but were able to supply all
the Parts of the World, where Beef was Generally Exported
—; That at that time Beef in any Quantity was to be bought,
ready Cured in <HI>Ireland,</HI> including the Salt and the Cask it
was Packed in, at a Halt-penny <HI>sterling per</HI> Pound, and that
<HI>England</HI> was so convinc'd of this, that they could Export
no Flesh, but sent their Ships Generally to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to Load
Beef for their Islands, and that <HI>France</HI> upon all Occasions,
got their Beef, if possible, from <HI>Ireland,</HI> for the Victualling
their Navys and Merchant Ships—. Again, that the Cattel
in <HI>Ireland</HI> were Larger and Fatter than in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their
Quantity so great, that <HI>England</HI> was obliged to Prohibit their
being brought over thither, otherwise they would Over run
the three Kingdoms with the Quantity; and that <HI>Scotland</HI>
having less Quantity of Feeding Grounds, and their Cattel
being Generally Lesser, it was not possible that they could
supply the Quantity of Beef, or any thing near the Price with
the <HI>Irish;</HI> and that therefore, it could not be supposed, the
Exportation of Beef from <HI>Scotland</HI> could be considerable, any
more than from <HI>England;</HI> and on this Foot it was that the
Committee made their Report, That it was not needful to
allow any Drawback upon the Exportation of Beef, <HI>England</HI>
at the same Time having no Allowances granted in the same
Case.</P>
<P>“But a new Objection turned the Scale—, It was offered
by some, That in the North East Parts of <HI>Scotland, viz.</HI> At
<HI>Aberdeen</HI> and the Country adjacent, there was a New and very
Advantageous Trade, lately Erected for Feeding Swine,
which being made Fat with Corn in great Quantities (<HI>&amp;</HI> that
being a Consumption of the Produce of the Land) the Flesh
was Cured and Salted, Barrelled and Exported to <HI>Holland</HI>
for Sale—; And that this was a Trade which ought to
be Encouraged. It was added. That this as it was an
<PB N="139" REF="439"/>
Advantageous Trade to <HI>Scotland,</HI> so it was a Growing Trade,
and might in Time increase to a very great Degree, the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Demanding every year more Quantities than the Country had
been yet able to supply, that there had been several years
Exported from 1500 to 2000 Barrels of salted Pork—from
<HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> using the same for Victualling
their East <HI>India</HI> Ships, and other Ships that went upon long
Voyages.</P>
<P>“This had some appearance of Argument in it, and being
push'd very heartily at, in behalf of the <HI>Aberdeen</HI> Merchants;
brought the Parliament to alter the Report, and agree to an
Allowance upon the Exportation of Pork, and afterward
of Beef and Pork, the Beef being brought in by the by.</P>
<P>“It had been said, as above, That the <HI>Irish</HI> Beef was Exported
Cheaper than <HI>Scotland</HI> could afford it—; It was therefore
Argued, That <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to have the Drawback allowed
on their Beef, to encourage the Exporration, and if possible,
to set them upon an equal Foot with <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Trade of
Exporting Beef, which, tho' it was proved, was not pro∣bable,
yet as the <HI>Affirmative</HI> carried some possibility, and the
<HI>Negative</HI> seemed to be of no great Consequence, the Members
came in to it, and they passed together.</P>

<OPENER>Prayers Said,

<P>Then the Parliament proceeded to the Consideration of what
Drawbacks shall be allowed upon the Exportation of Beef and Pork.</P>
<P><HI>And after some Debate thereon, a Clause was offred in relation
thereto, in these Terms,</HI> And that there shall be allowed Four Shil∣lings

<P>Agreed, That the Drawbacks shall be Five Shillings <HI>Sterling</HI> for

<P>Thereafter it was proposed, That the said Drawback shall not

<P><HI>And after some Debate, there were two States of a Vote offered,

there shall be allowed Five Shillings Sterling for every Barrel of Beef or

<P>And after some Reasoning, which of the Two should be the State

<P>And before Voting, it was Agreed, That the Members Votes
shall be Marked, and that the List of their Names, as they shall

<P>Thereafter it was put to the Vote, <HI>Approve the Clause or Not;</HI> and
it carried <HI>Approve.</HI></P>
<P>Thereafter the Clauses of the Eighth Article of Union, in relation
to <HI>Scots</HI> Salt, were Read, and the First Clause or Paragraph thereof
again Read; And after some Reasoning thereon, it was Moved,
That the Exemption from the Duty of <HI>Scots</HI> Salt, provided by the
said Clause to be for Seven Years, shall be perpetual; And after some
further Debate, The Consideration thereof was delayed till next <HI>Sede∣runt</HI>
of Parliament, to be then resumed previous to all other Business.</P>
<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debates about the Drawbacks on Beef and Pork ended
now in a short Question, Whether it should be Four Shillings
Seven Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel, or Five Shillings—; And the
Difference being of no great Consequence, the same Argu∣ments
that carryed it before to have any Drawback at all,
carryed it now to have that Drawback settled at the largest
Rate of the Two, so that Affair ended.</P>
<P>“Then the House proceeded to the Grand Affair, the Ex∣emptions
from the Salt Tax in <HI>England</HI>—; Great Quar∣rrels
were raised at the Concessions made by the Treaters in
this Case, who had exempted <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Duties on
Salt payable in <HI>England</HI> for Seven Years only; whereas it
was alledged, That the Salt Tax was a Burden Intolerable
for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that they would no more be able to bear
that Duty in seven years, than now, and that therefore
they ought not to have Subjected <HI>Scotland</HI> to it at all; That
it had been allowed, the Salt Tax was a Burden chiefly laid
upon the Poor, the Poor People in <HI>Scotland</HI> Feeding much
upon salt Meats, and using great Quantities of Salt—;
That to lay a Tax on their Salt, was to assist in Starving them,
and the like—. This was an Argument so pleasing, and so
much Improved without Doors, that it made the Opposers of
the Union grow popular, and seem as if they were but meer
Advocates for the Poor; That they were now really De∣fending
their Country, which the Commissioners had aban∣doned,
and shewed, that the Concern for the Burdening
<PB N="141" REF="441"/>
<HI>Scotland</HI> with unreasonable Exactions had not been part of their
Business—; Great Hopes therefore were conceived from
this Debate by some People, who had the Destruction of the
Treaty chiefly in their Eyes, for as the Struggle had not been
small in <HI>England,</HI> to obtain an Exemption from the Salt Tax
to <HI>Scotland</HI> for Seven Years, it was more than probable, That,
if a perpetual Exemption was insisted on, the <HI>English</HI> Parlia∣ment
would refuse it, and so the Union might split upon
that Rock; which being so specious, and seeming to be all
done in meer Concern for the Poor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would there∣fore
engage all the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Defence of it—;
But this Cloud vanish'd afterward, tho' at first it look'd black

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debate of the last Day being Renewed, occasioned
some Warmth in the House, and great Arguings there were
about the Poor in <HI>Scotland</HI> being Unable to pay the Tax upon
Salt at all, and that therefore they ought not to be left to
the Mercy of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament; the Matters also of the
Disproportion in the Duties to the Value in the respective
Kingdoms, was also made a strong Motive against the Duty
being laid upon the <HI>Scott,</HI> as a plain Inequality, since, as the
Duty on Salt lay then, being Taxed by Weight, the <HI>Scots</HI>
should pay Sixteen Shillings Four Pence upon what in their
Country yielded <HI>exclusive</HI> of the Duty but Three Shillings;
Whereas the <HI>English</HI> should pay no more on the value of
Ten Shillings Six Pence, which was a great Disparity in the
Taxation by Value—. But to this it was Answered, If
the Bulk or Quantity of Salt was equal, and <HI>Scotland</HI> having
their Salt made just where it was Expended, had or could
buy as much for Three Shillings, as the <HI>English</HI> had, or
could buy for Ten Shillings Six Pence, the Weight of the
Salt being the same, they were so much the better able to
pay Sixteen Shillings Four Pence on that Quantity of Salt
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by how much it was had Cheaper by Seven Shil∣lings
Six Pence in its first Cost than the <HI>English</HI> were, who
were obliged to pay Seven Shillings Six Pence for the same
Quantity in its first Cost, than the <HI>Scots</HI> payed.</P>
<P>To this again was Objected, the Poverty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
the Difference this made in the Price of Salt to the Poor,
how necessary the Salt was to the Subsistence of the Poor, and
how much it would raise the Price, to the General Discou∣ragement
and Impoverishing the Labouring part of the Peo∣ple,
the <HI>English</HI> Duties being very near one Penny <HI>per</HI> Pound
<HI>sterling</HI> upon the Salt, most of which Duty would ly on those
who were least able to bear it; And this, as I Noted before,
made the Argument become popular, and the Opposers of
the Union began to be counted Patriots, who strove meerly
for the securing their Country from Unreasonable and Insup∣portable
Taxes.</P>

a true state of this Question,</HI> what the <HI>English</HI> Duties on Salt
were, which were thus strenuously Argued against—, they
were in short thus.</P>
<P>Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel on Salt, each Bushel to Weigh
Fifty Six Pound <HI>Aver du Pois</HI> Weight, granted by the
<HI>English</HI> Parliament <HI>Anno 5<SUP>o</SUP> William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> appro∣priated
to the year 1710.</P>
<P>Twenty Eight Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel, Weighing as above,
<PB N="144" REF="444"/>
granted 9th King <HI>William,</HI> and appropriated for the
payment of Annuities Redeemable by Parliament.</P>
<P>“As may more at large be seen in the Appendix.</P>
<P>“The Treaters at <HI>London</HI> had agreed on both Hands, to
Exempt <HI>Scotland</HI> from the whole Tax upon Salt for seven
Years as appears in the Observations on the Minutes of the
Eighth Article in that Treaty—, but had then left it—,
with a Concession, that then <HI>Scotland</HI> should pay as <HI>England</HI>
should pay at that Time—, only it was supposed, the <HI>British</HI>
Parliament would Consider, Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> was any bet∣ter
able to pay then than before—, according to that
Clause added in the Fourteenth Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That it could not
be supposed, that the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> would ever lay
any firsts of Burdens upon the United Kingdom, but what they
should find of Necessity at that time, for the Preservation and
Good of the whole—, and with due Regard to <HI>the Circumstan∣ces
and Abilities</HI> of every part of the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>But it was again alledged, That the Words in this Eighth
Article, viz. But from the Expiration of the said seven years,
<HI>Scotland</HI> shall be lyable to the same Duties for Salt made in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
as shall be then payable for Salt made in <HI>England,</HI> side the
Treaty at <HI>London</HI> Article VIII. <HI>Page 5th.</HI> Obliged the <HI>Scot.</HI>
the payment and put it out of the Power of the Parliament
of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to Article VIII and that therefore the Parliament
of <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to take effectual Care to prevent it, and to
secure the People of Scotland against it.</P>
<P>“There were a great many Speeches made on this Subject,
and something Harsh enough past on both sides, which I care
not to Relate—. for the sakes of the Gentlemen that shewed
themselves a little out of Temper here—; But at length a
<HI>Medium</HI> was proposed in the Terms <HI>of the first Clause of the Mi∣nute,</HI>
which Exempted <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Two Shillings Four
Peace <HI>per</HI> Bushel, mentioned above, and appropriated to the
East <HI>India</HI> Company, and let the Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushed
stand, as a Thing not of so much Consequence, 1. Bushel
the Sum was not so considerable, as to make it Insupportable
to the Poor. 2. It was not appropriated to any payment fur∣ther
than to the year 1710. and so might Determine in a short
Time: Whereas the Two Shillings Four Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushed, was
actually settled as a Fund for payment of Annuities for Ninety
Nine Years, and must certainly fall upon <HI>Scotland</HI> at the end
of seven Years.</P>
<P>This seemed a very reasonable Proposal, tho' it did nor
answer the End of these Gentlemen, whose Aim, as I Hinted
before, was at the Treaty in General—. For it was a Mode∣rating
between both, bearing a part which they could bear,
<PB N="145" REF="445"/>
and yet taking off that part which the Poor were said to be
pinch'd by, and which they pretended would effectualy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
raised a National Discontent.</P>
<P>“The Gentlemen on the other side, were a little silenced with
this Proposal—, they at first indeed positively insisted, as in
the D. of <HI>A—ls</HI> Protest, That <HI>Scotland</HI> should be for ever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree
&amp; of all Duties on Salt—, but they were subdued by the
Reasonings of the other Gentlemen, upon the Equity of the
above Proposal, and unless, as in General, objecting against
the whole Treaty, there was no withstanding it—; yet
after some Debating, there was found an Exception to this
too, and that was, That tho' the Two Shillings four Pence
was thus provided against, it was but a single Term, and the
Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> might set that Duty aside, and
lay some other Tax on in the Room of it, which might be
the same thing, or worse, and so this Exemption might be
Eluded, and this they called without Doors, a Design to
Trepan <HI>Scotland,</HI> or draw her into the snare of the Duty, under
the pretence of an Exemption.</P>
<P>But this was soon Warded against, and the latter part of
the Clause effectually stopt that Gap, viz. that if the Parlia∣ment
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall at, or before the Expiring of the said
seven years, subsitute any other Fund in the place of the said
Two Shillings Four Pence of Excise on the Bushel of Home Salt
—, <HI>Scotland</HI> shall after the said seven years, hear a proportion
of the said Fund, <HI>but</HI> shall have an Equivalent in the Terms of
the Treaty, that is in the Terms of the Fourteenth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
which says, <HI>That</HI> Scotland shall have an Equivalent for what
the Subjects thereof shall be Charged towards payment of the Debts
of <HI>England,</HI> in all particulars whatsoever, Vide Treaty at <HI>Lo∣ndon</HI>
Art. 15. <HI>Pag.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>“This brought the Matter of Debate to an End, and there
was nothing left but to put the Vote—-, the other Party of∣fered
a Clause of General and Absolute Exemption, as <HI>per</HI> the
Minute—; but it was Voted not to be the state of the Que∣stion,
stion, so the Affair ended with the D. of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls</HI> Protest, as
<HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>“Yet it must be observed, That this step taken by the Par∣liament,
went a great way to stop the Mouths of the People,
who began to be strangely Allarm'd at the Apprehensions of
the Salt Duty, which was cryed out upon as Insupportable,
but their being wholly Exempted from it for seven years, and
for ever Exempt from all but Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel, the
Burden was both lessened in the Main, and Remote in pro∣spect,
and so the General Clamour wore off.</P>
<P>“It was indeed a great Abatement to that Article as stated
at <HI>London,</HI> and some People flattered themselves with the
Hopes, that it would occasion some Debates in the Parliament
in <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps suffer some Alterations there, which
<PB N="146" REF="446"/>
might occasion the Returning the whole to <HI>Scotland</HI> again
—; But that View proved Fictitious, and the Gentlemen
found themselves disappointed.</P>

“And now we are come to the great Article of the Equiva∣lent,
which has of it self made more Noise in the World,
than all the other Articles; and which, tho' in it self founded
upon the highest Justice to <HI>Scotland,</HI> being the only Mean
to bring the Discording Circumstances of the Nations to
Unite, and was stated with the greatest Exactness, and the nicest
and most unexceptionable Calculations, that the Wit of Man
could perform; yet it met with the greatest Opposition, and
was Treated with the most Contempt in <HI>Scotland</HI> of any other
part of the Union; Nay to that Degree, that, when the
very Money it self came to be brought into <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
Common People were excited to that Height, as to call it
the Price of their Country, and to Insult the very People
that brought it.</P>
<P>I must therefore be excused, if the Observations on this
Point exceed the Bounds of that Brevity I at first proposed
to my self, and that I endeavour to be as particular as pos∣sible
upon this Head.</P>
<P>The first Clause of this Article had been Voted and Agreed
to, not without a great Struggle in the Parliament, on the
Seventh of the same Month of <HI>December,</HI> as <HI>per</HI> the Observa∣tions
upon the Minutes of that Day appears, to which I re∣fer,
and the remaining part of the Article was adjourned till
the Reports of the Committee appointed to consider of the
Sixth and Eighth Articles were received and considered, which
being now ended, the House proceeded to the subsequent
Articles.</P>
<P>The First Clause of the Article was the main Prelimi∣nary
to the rest, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether <HI>Scotland,</HI> should be oblig∣ed
to come in to the appropriated Duties of <HI>England,</HI>
and consequently have her Revenues appropriated to
the payment of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, receiving from <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
an Equivalent—; What that Equivalent should
be, <HI>viz.</HI> Ready Money? How much it should be, <HI>viz.</HI>
Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Eighty Five
Pounds Ten Shillings—? And whether that Sum
was rightly calculated? All this was determined as
above.</P>
<P>“The second Clause which came now to be debated was
thus. And in regard, That, after the Union, <HI>Scotland</HI> becoming
liable to the same Customs and Duties payable on Import and Ex∣port,
and to the same Excises on all Exciseable Liquors as in
<HI>England,</HI> as well upon that Account, as upon the Account of the
Encrease of Trade and People, (which will be the Happy Conse∣quence
of the Union) The said Revenues will much improve be∣yond
the before mentioned Annual Values thereof, of which no
present Estimate can be made; Vet nevertheless, for the Reasons
aforesaid, there ought to be a proportionable Equivalent answered
to <HI>Scotland;</HI> It is agreed, That, after the Union, there shall
<PB N="148" REF="448"/>
be an Account kept of the said Duties arising in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the
end it may appear, what ought to be Answer' to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as an
Equivalent for such Proportion of the said Encrease, as shall be
applicable to the Payment of the Debts of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“This was only to oblige the Persons appointed by the Go∣vernment
to direct the Treasury of <HI>Britain.</HI> That an exact
Account might be kept, what part of the Revenue of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
was to be appropriate, and for which the Equivalent
was to be raised, in order also to come to a Certainty in the
Measures which were to be taken with the Remainder—;
And therefore this needed little Debate, yet it will occasion a
further Remark presently.</P>
<P>“The Third Clause runs thus, And for the further and more
effectual answering the several Ends hereafter mentioned, <HI>It is a∣greed,</HI>
That, from and after the Union, the whole Encrease of
the Revenues of Customs, and Duties on Import and Export, and
Excise upon Exciseable Liquors in <HI>Scotland,</HI> over and above the
Annual Produce of the said respective Duties, as above stated, shall
go and be apply'd, for the Term of Seven Years, to the Uses here∣after
mentioned.</P>
<P>“This was a general Referring also to the Particulars, to
which the Overplus of the Revenue of <HI>Scotland</HI> should be ap∣plyed,
and this will also come to be discoursed of in its
place, being here pass'd of Course.</P>
<P>The Fourth Clause was, And that, upon the said Account,
there shall be answered to <HI>Scotland</HI> Annually, from the end of
Seven Years after the Union, an Equivalent in Proportion to such
Part of the said Encrease, as shall be applicable to the Debts of
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“This Clause could admit no Debate on the <HI>Scots</HI> side,
since, as they had agreed, by the first Clause, to come into
an Equality of Duties, this was Capitulating in behalf of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> That an Equivalent should be paid by <HI>England</HI> for
so much of the Revenues of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as should be applyed to
the <HI>English</HI> Debts, over and above what had been already
stated in the Equivalent named in the former Clause.</P>
<P>“And here I shall take the Freedom to quote what the for
mer Gentleman I quoted before gave, <HI>as his Opinion</HI> on this
very Head, I mean Mr. Baron <HI>Clark,</HI> whose Judgment I think
I may be allowed to appeal to, and who was a Witness to,
and present in Parliament at all these Debates. See his Ellay
on the 15th Article of the Union, Pag. 13th <HI>in these Words—</HI></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="449"/>
Seven Years, to the Use and Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
Meaning whereof is hereby Illustrated.</P>
<P>Suppose, the Customs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Union,
(what upon the Account of a greater Trade, or upon
the Account of taking upon us the <HI>English</HI> Customs)
should increase to <HI>80000 Pounds</HI> Sterling, which I believe
no Trading Man will doubt of; then 'tis plain, that in
regard there's an Increase of these Customs of <HI>50000</HI> Pounds
above the present Extent, therefore that Increase is by this
Paragraph allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> yearly, for the foresaid Term
of Seven Years, which will be a great Encouragement to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and by Consequence an Advantage to the
whole <HI>Island;</HI> since 'tis not to be doubted, but such an
Annual Sum <HI>of</HI> 50000 Pounds will be imployed during
that time, towards such Ends and Uses as will be most
for the Honour and Advantage of this Poor Country.</P>
<P>Upon this Concession of the Increase <HI>of</HI> Customs and Ex∣cises
for Seven Years, 'tis likewise to be observed, That the
Sum of 22874 Pounds that falls at <HI>September</HI> 1710 above∣mentioned,
will likewise go for the Remainder of the Term
of Seven Years, after the Union, towards the behoof of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> if so be that the Customs and Excises that raise
that Sum are continued, and not appropriated for other Uses</P>
<P>“3 From the last part of the Paragraph, 'tis to be observ∣ed,
That there shall be answered to <HI>Scotland</HI> Annually, af∣ter
the Expiration of the foresaid Term of Seven Years, an
<HI>Equivalent</HI> in Proportion to such parts of the Increase as
shall be applyed towards Payment of the Debts of <HI>England.</HI>
For Explaining of which, it may be oserved.</P>
<P>Suppose, after the foresaid Term of Seven Years, the Cu∣stoms
of <HI>Scotland</HI> should rise to 120000 Pounds yearly,
which is an Increase of 90000 Pounds above what they are
now stated at; in that Case, the said Increase of 90000
Pounds wou'd be disposed of as follows,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Towards the Civil Government of <HI>Britain</HI> 17007</ITEM>
<ITEM>Towards the General Expense of the Nation 01710</ITEM>
<ITEM>Towards Payment of the Debts of <HI>Britain</HI> 71283</ITEM>
<ITEM>In full of the said 90000</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>“This last Article of the Accompt is very Remarkable, ex∣tending
to no less than a Sum of 71287 Pounds to be appli∣catle
towards the Debts contracted before the Union. But
this needs not amuse any Person: For in the first place, it
was supposed, if there be a Peace concluded, and so an end
put to the present War, then will the Debts of <HI>England</HI> be
in a few Years fully payed. The Consequence of which will
be, That the Customs and Excises, which after the Union,
<PB N="150" REF="450"/>
will be payable by the Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> shall then
be intirely taken off and let fall. In the <HI>next</HI> place, Tho'
the said Sum of <HI>71287</HI> Pounds be applicable yearly towards
the payment of <HI>English</HI> Debts; yet there shall be an An∣nual
<HI>Equivalent</HI> given by <HI>England</HI> to the Extent of that
Sum. Which leads us to consider a <HI>Question,</HI> Whether or
not that Sum of <HI>71287</HI> Pounds will be sent up yearly to
<HI>England</HI> for paying these Debts? I <HI>Answer,</HI> No, for if it
should, then, by the Nature of the Equivalents, that very
Sum behoved to be sent back to us again, which is a certain
needless Trouble; and Lawyers, when they intend to amuse
their Clients with speaking a sort of Latine, have this in
their Mouths, applicable enough to this purpose, Frustra pe∣titur
quod mox est restituendum.</P>
<P>“Wherefore any Man may see, that this Sum is not to be
sent to <HI>England,</HI> but must remain among us.</P>
<P><HI>Could</HI> it ever have entered into the Heads of Men, in
their right Wits, to burden a poor Nation with an Annual
payment of a great Sum, for Debts they never contracted,
without at the same time allowing a Re imbursement to
them? And if so, can we imagine, that Matters will be so
confounded, as that they must send yearly great Sums out of
<HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> for no other End, than immediately
to be returned back again? This is so ridiculous, that 'tis
scarcely to be spoken of.</P>
<P>“Thus far Mr. Baron <HI>Clerk,</HI> to which I shall add nothing,
but that his Reasonings were so plain, that they needed no
Explication—</P>
<P>“The Fifth Clause was thus, And whereas, from the Expira∣tion
of Seven Years after the Union, <HI>Scotland</HI> is to be lyable to
the same Duties for Salt made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as shall be then pay∣able
for Salt made in <HI>England;</HI> It is agreed, That, when such
Duties take place there, an Equivalent shall be Answered to <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
for such part thereof, as shall be applyed towards payment of
the Debts of <HI>England;</HI> Of which Duties an Account shall be kept,
to the end it may appear, what is to be Answered to <HI>Scotland</HI> as
the said Equivalent.</P>
<P>“This required only to be left out as being useless, since
the Affair of the Salt was settled other ways in the prece∣dent
Days Vote; So that hitherto these were all Negative
Clauses in the Main.</P>
<P>“The Sixth Clause was, And generally, That an Equivalent
shall be Answered to <HI>Scotland</HI> for such parts of the <HI>English</HI> Debts,
as <HI>Scotland</HI> may hereafter become lyable to pay by Reason of the
Union, other than such for which Appropriations have been made
by Parliament in <HI>England</HI> of the Customs, or other Duties on Ex∣port
and Import, Excises on all Exciseable Liquors or Salt, in
Respect of which Debts, Equivalents are herein before provided.</P>
<P>“The Opposition made to this Article was one the same Foot
as the Opposition made to the first Clause, <HI>viz.</HI> That they
<PB N="151" REF="451"/>
would not have <HI>Scotland</HI> come into the <HI>English</HI> Debts at all,
but having consented to come in as far as the Equivalent ex∣tended,
they were for making a Stop there—; But this
was found Impracticable, after the Duties which were to be
paid by <HI>Scotland</HI> were assented to, to have turned them from
the Channel of Appropriation which the like Duties in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
were appointed to run in by Act of Parliament, could
not well be done, so after a short Dispute about the Possibi∣lity
of this, it was pass'd over also.</P>
<P>“They now came to the Debate of the Application of the
Equivalent, but this was too long a Subject to enter upon
that Day, so it was adjourned to the next Time—.</P>

of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Mobs and Rabbles in the Streets had been
supprest, and the Guards did constant Duty in the City,
walked the Rounds in the Night, and kept the Streets quiet,
the Meeting of the Heretors and Fencible Men, had been Dis∣charged
by Proclamation and the Clause in the <HI>Act of Security,</HI>
Licensing them to do so, had been Repealed; So that
now no Room was left for violent Methods, except by open
and actual Rebellion, and that had all possible provision made
for it in the Laws, and the Queen had Ordered Troops to the
Borders of <HI>England,</HI> as is before Noted, in order to assist and
support the Government, in case of Necessity.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="453"/>
“The only Pretence therefore now, was this, The Ad∣dresses,
as you will Read in the Minutes, had been continually
brought in against the Union from all parts of the Kingdom,
Answers were not given, nor expected to be given by the
Parliament, but they lay before the Parliament for their
Consideration; and an Address lying before the Parliament,
is, by the Nature of the Thing, supposed to be under Con∣sideration—;
But the Addressers, pretending, That no Re∣gard
was had to their Addresses, pretend now to come all up
to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to wait for, or rather to Demand Answers to
their Addresses—; This was too bare faced a Pretence not
to discover its own Meaning; And therefore the Parliament
immediately agreed to the Proclamation, to Discharge or
Forbid all such Gatherings or Meetings of the Subjects, as
Unwarrantable and contrair to Law. See the Proclamation
in the <HI>Appendix</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. B x x.</P>
<P>“You will observe, That on several Occasions after the <HI>first</HI> Pro∣posal
of Printing the Names of such as Voted on either side, the
like List of Names was Ordered to be made publick—, it would
have been too long to have subjoyned these to every Vote
—, and also been Troublesome and Useless to the Reader
—, But this Case being something singular, I have put
the Names of the Members as they were Printed by Order of
Parliament, in the Appendix of this Work, marked with
this Mark D x x, by which some guess may be made, who
Encouraged or Discouraged the Violences of those Times,
and what Encouragement were suggested to those without,
from the Proceedings and Conduct of those within.</P>
<P>“It was expected by some People, That these Tumults
should have had great Encouragement on the part of the
Church; and great pains were taken to draw in the Ministers in
several parts, to Espouse the Quarrel, and to appear with the
People against the Union.</P>
<P>“But the Ministers, however they shewed themselves against
the Union in General, and against the several Particulars as
they concerned them, yet they shewed no inclination to
Encourage the Tumultary Methods, that the Violent Tempers
of other People, seemed to be precipitating the Nation into;
and therefore the Letter written by the Commission to the
several Presbyteries, was very seasonable, not only to prevent
the Mischiess Threatning the Peace of the Kingdom at that
Time, but also to Vindicate the Commission of the Assembly
from the Aspersions raised upon them from the above Sup∣position,
Copy of which I have inserted in the <HI>Appendix,</HI>
with the Answer of the Presbytery of <HI>Hamilton</HI> to it N. O x,
P x.</P>
<P>“It would have been endless to have added here, the par∣ticular
Addresses which were presented from the several parts
of the Kingdom, however, some of the most significant I
<PB N="154" REF="454"/>
have added in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> marked as follows, Address
from the Presbytery at <HI>Hamiltoun</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. L x. which was very
particular, the Presbytery of <HI>Dumblain</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. x. with the

the Bulk of the rest may be guessed at; Only it may
be Noted, there were but three Presbyteries in the whole

<HI>Dumblain,</HI> there being Sixty Eight Presbyteries in the whole.</P>

<OPENER>Prayers said,
Rolls Called,</OPENER>
<P>Thereafter the first part of the Seventh and last Clause of the
Fifteenth Article of Union, beginning thus, And as for the Uses, to
which the said Sum of 398085 <HI>Pounds,</HI> &amp;c. was again Read, and
after Reasoning, the Representation of the Council Gene∣ral
of the Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> Trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and
the <HI>Indies</HI> was also again Read; and after further Reasoning
thereupon, and upon the Application of the Equivalent, a Proposal
was given in for altering and amending the said first part of the
above Seventh, and last Clause of the said Fifteenth Article, in
these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“It is agreed, That, in the first place, out of the foresaid Sum,
what Consideration shall be found necessary to be had for any
Lostes which private Persons may sustain, by reducing the Coin
of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Standart and Value of the Coin of <HI>England</HI> may
be made good. In the next place, That the Capital Stock, or
Fund, of the <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Company of <HI>Scotland,</HI> advanced,
together with the Interest of the said Capital Stock, after the Rate
of Five <HI>per Cent. per Annum,</HI> from the respective Times of the pay∣ment
thereof shall be payed: Upon payment of which Capital
Stock and Interest, It is agreed, the said Company be Dissolved

Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> for raising, the said Sum of 398085 Pounds
to Shillings, the said Company shall neither Trade nor grant Li∣cence
to Trade; Providing, That, if the said Stock and Interest
shall not be payed in Twelve Months, after the Commencement
of the Union, That then the said Company may, from thence
forward, Trade or give Licence to Trade, until the said haill Ca∣pital
S ock and Interest shall be payed: And as to the Overplus of
the said Sum of 398085 Pounds Ten Shillings, after payment of
what Consideration shall be had for Losles in Repairing the Coin,
and paying the said Capital Stock and Interest; and also the haill
<PB N="155" REF="455"/>
Increase of the said Revenues of Customs, Duties and Excises,
above the present Value, which shall arise in <HI>Scotland</HI> during the
said Term of Seven Years, together with the Equivalent, which
shall become due upon the Improvement thereof in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after
the said Term, and also as to all other Sums, which according
to the Agreements aforesaid may become payable to <HI>Scotland</HI> by
way of Equivalent, for what that Kingdom shall hereafter become
lyable, towards payment of the Debts of <HI>England;</HI> It is a agreed,
That the same be applyed in manner following, <HI>viz.</HI> That all
the Publick Debts of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as shall be adjust∣ed
by this persent Parliament, shall be payed, and that 2000 Pounds
<HI>Sterling per Annum,</HI> for the space of Seven Years, shall be apply∣ed
towards Incouraging and Promoting the Manufacture of course
Wooll within these Shires which produce the Wooll, and that the
first 2000 Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> be payed at <HI>Martinmass</HI> nex, and it
yearly at <HI>Martinmass during the space foresaid;</HI> and afterwards
the same shall be wholly applyed towards the Incouraging and
Promoting the Fisheries and such other Manufactures and Improve∣ments
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as may most conduce to the general Good of
the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>Which being Read, and after Reasoning thereon, it was Moved,
That the Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> Trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies</HI> be
heard by their Lawyers upon the Rights and Priviledges of the said
Company before any further Procedure. And after Debate,</P>
<P>The said haill Seventh and last Clause of the said Fifteenth Article
of Union from these Words, And as for the Uses to which the said
Sum of 398085 Pounds Sterling, to the end, with the above Altera∣tion
and Amendment was Read over.</P>
<P>And thereupon there were Two States of a Vote offered, The First
in these Terms, Approve of the Fifteenth Article of the Union as al∣tered

or <HI>Second.</HI></P>
<P>It was agreed before Voting, That the Members Votes be Marked,
and that the List of their Names as they Vote, be Printed &amp; Recorded.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put First or Second, and it carried First.</P>
<P>Thereafter it was put to the Vote, Approve of the said Fifteenth Ar∣ticle
as Altered and Amended or not, and it carried Approve.</P>
<P>Then an Overture given in, in these Terms, “That it be Re∣mined
to the Committee to consider what Consideration shall be
had of the Losses of the Coin; As also what the Capital Stock and
Interest of the <HI>African</HI> Company, may amount to, and how and to
whom the same shall be payed, and likeways to Adjust the List of
the Publick Debts, and to prepare Overtures on these several
Heads, and to Report to the Parliament, with Power to them to
call for Papers and Persons, and accordingly it was Remitted to

<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.”</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLVII.</HEAD>
<P>“Upon this part of the Application of the Equivalent, great
Stir was made, on pretence of preserving the <HI>African</HI> Com∣pany,
and some Papers were offered to the Parliament.</P>
<P>“The Company made a long Representation to the Parli∣ament,
needless to be inserted here—.</P>
<P>“There were a Party who pretended to struggle, and some
Motions appeared in the House to that purpose, against the Dis∣solving
the <HI>African</HI> Company; It is confest, the Company
was a Thing the Nation had a great Concern in, almost
every considerable Family in the Kingdom having some share
in the Stock, and consequently in the Loss, for it was reck∣oned
no better: The Historical part of that Transaction, does
not relate to this place, but it may be proper to say a little
to it, to introduce the true understanding of the Vote.</P>
<P>“The Company had been Erected upon a General Subscrip∣tion
of 600000 <HI>lib. sterling,</HI> most of it subscribed in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
upon which every Subscriber had paid down a certain
of the Sum subscribed, and was lyable at the Call of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
pany, to be pursued for the Remainder, and to pay it all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
as by the several Acts of Parliament, settling and confirming
the said Company, will appear.</P>
<P>“Upon the Miscarriage of the Expedition to <HI>Darien,</HI> and
the Return of their Ships, &amp;c. the Company was so Discou∣raged
and Disheartned, that no new Attempt either there, or
any where else, had been so much as Talked of, nor were
any other Payments demanded, the Loss of what was already
Expended lying very heavy upon the Nation, and parti∣cularly
upon some Families who could very ill bear it.</P>
<P>“The Design had so effectually Miscarried, that the Stock
advanc'd was not only Expended, but the Company was
brought very low, and was very far in Debt upon the ac∣count
of their said Expedition to <HI>Darien</HI>—, and the Sub∣scribers
were always apprehensive of a Call upon them of
some further payment, to discharge the Remainder due on
the old Voyage, or perhaps so Form some new Expedition,
and this made some People so Uneasie, that they sold their
Stock in the said Company for Trisles, only to be secured
against further Demands; In General, the Interest in the said
Stock was come to so low an Ebb, that People valued them∣selves
little or nothing upon their Shares in it, and when the
first View of the Union came on, and some thought one way
<PB N="157" REF="457"/>
of it, some another, they either Bought or Sold as their Opi∣nion
of the Union, and its prospect of Success either increased
or decreased; and indeed the publick Expectation of the
Success of the Union ran very low at this Time, as may be
supposed, from the Value now put on the Stock of the <HI>African</HI>
Company, which was fallen so low, that several People offered
to Sell their whole Interest for 10 <HI>per Cent,</HI> on the Ori∣ginal
Stock, tho' at the same time they saw that if the Uni∣on
took place, the whole principal Money with Interest was
to be repaid them.</P>
<P>Thereseemed to be abundance of Difficulties in the way of the
Treaty; he Fury of the Rabbles, the Tumults in the Streets, the
Strength of the Opposition, and the abundance of Debates
they were yet to go thro', gave so mean a prospect of the
Union, that tho' it was an Article in the Treaty, that when
it was Finished, all the Stock of the <HI>African</HI> Company should
be repaid with Interest, as above, out of the Equivalent Money,
yet no Body Valued themselves upon it then, nor were any
very fond of Buying, tho' the Demand was extravagantly
low; and indeed so low as told every one, the Sellers look∣ed
upon it as a desparate Case, that they had no Dependance
upon, and very little Expectation from</P>
<P>“It was expected there should have been a Debate upon
the previous Question, Whether the <HI>African</HI> Company should
be Dissolved or no, and as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, it was proposed to
hear Lawyers or Counsel in behalf of the Company, but it
was apparent, this also was a Proposal not so much in behalf
of the Company, as in order to put a full stop to the Uni∣on,
since it was evident, two Companies could not be con∣sistent
in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was it alledged, That the Proprietors of the Company
had it been put to the Question, would have desired the Com∣pany
to continue and so have Disbursed further Sums to
carry on their Trade, in hope of making up and recovering
their Moneys; and this rather than have received their prin∣cipal
Sums with Interest back again, which was a Thing
they had no reason to expect.</P>
<P>“The Proposal therefore was rejected, not that every Mans
Consent in his own private Right was not acknowledged to
be needful—; But this being a publick Act granted by
Parliament, the Parliament first securing every Man his whole
Principal and Interest, from the very time of payment, had
undoubtedly a Power to Rescind their own Act, and cause
cease all the Powers and Privileges which derived from
them.</P>
<P>“Upon this Foot, it was thought just to Repeal the Acts
Establishing the Company, even without hearing their
Lawyers, or demanding their Assent—. Again, had the
Assent been demanded, it ought to have been not an Assent
<PB N="158" REF="458"/>
of the Directors or Council, but of every Proprietor, which,
as it might have been Difficult, and perhaps Impossible,
would have effectually answered the End of those Gentlemen,
who sought to bring these Matters to a Head of Debate, and
so have wrought out of them the wished for Delay to the
<HI>Union</HI> then in hand.</P>
<P>“Some also alledged this Case as parallel to the great Case
now depending, and would have argued the last from the
consequence of the first, <HI>viz.</HI> That as the Company could not
be Dissolved by the Consent of the Directors, or Council,
or Managers of their Affairs, but by the universal Consent of
the whole Body of Subscribers; so neither could the Consti∣tution
of <HI>Scotland</HI> be Altered by the Act and Deed of the
Representative, without the Concurrence and Assent of the
Constituents from whom the Representatives derived—.
But this seeming parallel appeared to be Imperfect, and con∣sequently
to be no parallel at all, since the Company could
at any time be legally Dissolved, and their Charters, Privi∣leges,
and Powers be made to cease, by the same Power that
made them, without asking the Assent either of the Directors
or Subscribers; <HI>That is,</HI> without Consulting the Representa∣tive
or Constituent, Parts of that Body, and the Power so
Dissolving, or taking away the said Company, had no other
Obligation upon them, than in Justice to make good all
Damage or Detriment to private Persons; and this was
effectually done.</P>
<P>“The Fate of the <HI>African</HI> Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> being thus
Determined, the further Application of the Equivalent was
the next Work—; and there seemed only two Things to
call immediately for help.</P>
<P>“1. The Coin, which of Necessity required a new Re∣gulation.</P>
<P>“2. The publick Debts of the Nation, which called
loudly to be Discharged.</P>
<P>“The Coin was agreed to be the first Consideration, and as
<HI>per</HI> the Minute appears, was unanimously agreed to—, the
state of which was in short thus;</P>
<P>“By the lowness of the Coin in <HI>Scotland,</HI> both as to Quali∣ty
and Quantity, I mean the Old Money, <HI>Scotland</HI> came un∣der
this General Disadvantage, <HI>viz.</HI> That almost every Foreign
Coin past current in <HI>Scotland</HI> to advantage: For Example—,
the <HI>English</HI> Shilling past at Thirteen Pence, the <HI>French</HI> Crown
which in <HI>London</HI> goes at Four Shillings Six Pence, past at
Five Shillings, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Dollar at Fifty Eight Pence,
the Bank Dollar, and Three other sorts commonly called the
Wild-Horse, the Wild-Man, and Castle, being generally Im∣perial
or Rex Dollars, were by Act of Council raised to Sixty
Pence.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="459"/>
“This indeed had been occasioned by the Government in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> formerly crying up their own Money above the
usual Rate, a Thing always Fatal to the Nations that have
thought fit to Venture upon it, and which Precipice <HI>England</HI>
narrowly miss'd splitting upon <HI>in the late Restoration of her
Coin,</HI> at which time, some People push'd hard at raising the
Value of the Standart, not being aware of the National In∣jury
of Raising the Value of Foreign <HI>Species,</HI> and subjecting
the General Credit to a Loss on Exchange with all Nations
of the World.</P>
<P>“By the Union, the Coin of <HI>Scotland</HI> was to be reduced,
and brought to the <HI>English</HI> Standart, the Consequence of this
was of necessity, that there would be a Loss upon all the
kinds of Money, both Foreign and Proper—; To cry
down the Foreign Money, and bring it to a Value, could
not be, because the <HI>English</HI> Money being the Standart, was
to be the only current Money, and all other Money would,
as in <HI>England,</HI> go by Weight only; To sink the Difference
in the Hands of particular Persons, who had such Money in
Possession, would have been a great Loss upon the poor People,
and what they could not easily bear—</P>
<P>“The Advance upon the <HI>English</HI> Money, which was one
Penny on every Shilling of the Silver, and Two Shillings Two
Pence upon every Guinea, fell by the Course of Things, that
Money being to go current at the Rates as in <HI>England,</HI> and
this was no small Loss to the People that had <HI>English</HI> Money
by them, but the Foreign and <HI>Scots</HI> Money being no more
to be current, it was but reasonable, that the Publick should
desray the Charge, and make good the Loss, and therefore
this was allotted out of the Equivalent.</P>
<P>“Nor was that all, but as this was a Case which admitted
no Delay, so it obtained the Preference of every Thing else,
for till this was settled, the Circulation of Money would
have been stopp'd, and a general Stagnation of Trade would
have followed, and therefore it was appointed to be made
good out of the Equivalent, before the <HI>African</HI> Company was
resunded, and this set the Mint quickly to Work, as will
appear in its place.</P>
<P>“The next thing to be paid out of the Equivalent was the
Publick Debts, there were some who struggled heartily to
have the Debts of the Government come in before the Affair
of the <HI>African</HI> Company, but it could not be carryed, those
Debts were not all ascertain'd, and the Claims were to be
remitted to the Decision of the Law, at least many of them,
and this would have left the <HI>African</HI> Affair to a long Uncer∣tainty,
which neither the Nature of the Thing, nor the Oc∣casion
that Subscribers had for their Money could admit of
—; For it is to be observed by the Clause, That it the
whole was not paid them within Twelve Months, they had
<PB N="160" REF="460"/>
Privilege to Trade, or give Licence to Trade, as if they were
not to Dissolve at all.</P>
<P>“Next after the <HI>African</HI> Company therefore the Publick
Debts came to be considered, and the Equivalent was appro∣priated
to the Discharge of the said Debts; And if the pre∣sent
Sum fell short, it was to be made good out of the grow∣ing
Customs and Revenue of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which for Seven Years
was to be appropriate for such Uses, as will hereafter appear.</P>
<P>“The next in order was to bestow this Money for the En∣couragement
of Trade, and first the Wooll Masters as they
are called, that is the Gentlemen whose Estates were in the Sheep
Countries, and whose Rents were generally paid in Wooll,
these made loud Complaints, that the Unions bringing upon
them a Prohibition or Restraint of the Exportation of Wooll,
and there being no Consumption by Manufacturing at Home,
and their Wooll too course for Sale in <HI>England,</HI> their Estates
would be visibly sunk, and therefore that they ought to have
some <HI>Equivalent</HI> also.</P>
<P>To this it was alledged, That the Exportation of Wooll,
however obtained lately in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet was grievous to the
whole Nation, and ought to be restrained by Law, as it was
injurious to Trade, and that it used in former Times to be re∣strained;
that therefore if this was a present Loss to them,
it was nothing but a reducing them to what they were be∣fore,
and taking away the Advantages they had made for a
few Years out of the Publick Losses: But however,
That all Parties might, as far as possible, be made sensible
of the Equity and Justice of the Union, a Consideration of
2000 Pounds <HI>Sterling per Annum</HI> was allowed to encourage
setting up such Manufactures in these places, as might imploy
the Poor, and help forward the Consumption of the Wooll
in the Countries where it is grown—; How this 2000
founds <HI>per Annum</HI> was disposed, and what Effect it had on the
Wooll, or on the Trade, I may Examine hereafter.</P>
<P>“A Remainder after this is allotted to the Fishing, &amp;c.
But the Issue of this also being not come to Knowledge at
Writing of this History, I can give no further Account of
it.</P>
<P>“As to the Affair of the Coin and of the <HI>African</HI> Compa∣ny,
the particulars were referr'd to the Committee, and we
shall meet with them again in their Course, the Report of the
said Committee being formed into an Act of Parliament, as
will appear in its place—</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLVIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Matter committed to the Committee here, was not
whether the Coin should be reduc'd to the <HI>English</HI> Standart,
and be alike all over the Island, for that every one seemed to
agree to, especially after it had been agreed before, that the
Deficiency should be made good out of the Equivalent—;
But how, and in what manner the Deficiency of the Money
should be made good, was the thing the Com∣mittee
was to consider—; And here, con∣trary
almost to the Hopes of the People, the Committee
concluded, that the Deficiency even of the <HI>English</HI> Money,
<HI>viz.</HI> One Penny in each Shilling should be made good.</P>
<P>“But here was a great Difficulty, and that was this, if it
should be Voted, that no Consideration should be given for
the <HI>English</HI> Money, the People would be great Losers, and the
Article of making good the Losses of the Coin would not
be made good to them—; If the Deficiency was Voted,
then the <HI>English</HI> would bring in vast Sums of Money upon
them to receive the Deficiency; and have it out in current
Money, and so carry it home again, and by this Trick, as
some suggested, all the Equivalent might be exhausted.</P>
<P>“But the Committee found a Cure for both these Evils to∣gether,
1. They resolved to make good the Deficiency of
the <HI>English</HI> Money, <HI>that is,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Silver Money, not the
Guineas, and so all the Objections of that sort fell to the
Ground; And to prevent the Possibility of bringing in any
Quantity of Silver Money from <HI>England,</HI> they appointed all
the <HI>English</HI> Money in the Nation to be brought in to certain
places all in one Day, where the Sums being told, Sealed
up, and laid by till no more was left to bring in, the Money
was delivered back again the same day, with a Certification
of the same, which entitled the Proprietor to the Deficiency
to be paid out of the Equivalent.</P>
<P>“Thus in one day all the <HI>English</HI> Money in the Kingdom,
(<HI>viz.</HI> all the Silver Money) was reduc'd to the <HI>English</HI> Value,
and went after that as in <HI>England,</HI> and for no more—;
And as the Rate of Exchanges always attends the Intrinsick
Value of the <HI>Specie,</HI> so the Exchanges, which before ran
at Eleven or Twelve <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the Disadvantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
immediately came to A PAR, and Money ran between Lon∣don
and <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> at a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> or at most one <HI>per Cent.</HI>
sometimes this way, sometimes that way, as the Demand of
Remitters and Drawers happened to alter the Case.</P>
<P>“However the Proclamation mentioned in this Vote was con∣sealed,
till the Time that all Things were ready for this Cal∣ling
in the Money, that People might not have Notice of the
Thing, and consequently have Room to bring in Money from
<HI>England;</HI> It was alledged nevertheleses, That several conside∣rable
<PB N="163" REF="463"/>
Sums were brought over the Border, but I never could
understand, That it was proved; for the particulars, the Reader
is referred to the Proclamation which contains the Report of
the Committee, and shall come in its place.</P>
<P>“The Seventeenth Article required no Debate at all, being
what every Body acknowledged to be needful.</P>
<P>“The Eighteenth Article was so well worded, and every
Thing that related to <HI>Scotland</HI> so well provided for, that
there was very little Room for Objection, and what was
offered merits not to be remembred—; What was said re∣lating
to the Laws, being made Alterable by the Parliament,
amounted to nothing but just what had been Argued in <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
at the Treaty, as for those that would have it out of
the Power of subsequent Parliaments to alter any of the Laws,
when they came to consider, that this was to Bar <HI>Scotland</HI> from
having the advantage of a Legislature, and from what is
Essential to all Government, <HI>viz.</HI> so have a Power in Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
to make such Laws as they shall want, they presently Quitted
a Notion so wild, remembring that Laws which are for the
publick Good in one Age, may be directly otherwise in
another; And to leave the Parliament no Power to Amend
or Alter the Laws, would be to put <HI>Scotland</HI> in a worse Con∣dition
than any Nation in the World, that when any part of
Her Law became Grievous to Her, it could not, tho' at Her
own Request, receive any Amendment; the Reasonableness
therefore of its being always in the Power of subsequent Par∣liaments
to Make or Amend Laws being granted, the
Distinction of the Article admitted the less Debate, all things
being to be done only to the <HI>evident Utility of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>“There was a second Attempt made here, with relation to
Exempting the <HI>Scots</HI> from the Sacramental Test in <HI>England,</HI>
but as it was just the same thing as is mentioned already in
the Observation of <HI>November 12th.</HI> I need make no further
Remark upon it, than this, That it was thrown by as a Thing
in its self Impracticable, Unreasonable for the <HI>Scots</HI> Parlia∣ment
to meddle with, and as offered only to Embarrass the
present great Affair upon the Stage.</P>
<P>“The Session or Term for Law-proceedings was now further
to be Adjourned, and this was thought Necessary, not only
because of the present Hurry the Nation was in being Uni∣versally
taken up about the great Affair of the Union; but it
was thought some Advantages were designed against the
Treaty, from the Confluence of People that from all Parts of
the Kingdom, generally come together on this Occasion; and
the Gentlemen who were for the Union, did not think it
Safe to give such an Opportunity or Pretence, for the Coun∣trey
to gather to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as that must of Necessity offer to
them.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLIX.</HEAD>
<P>“I have given the Reasons for Adjourning the Session in
the last Observation; The Debates of this Day were only upon
the Day to which it should be Adjourned, which are not
Material, only to Note, That the Gentlemen against the U∣nion
were always for the shortest Adjournment, which some
said, was in hopes to get the Session to begin before the
Parliament should end.</P>
<P>“By the Nineteenth Article, the Court of Session, or as it
is called, The Colledge of Justice, with the Court of Justiciary,
are here effectually Established and Confirmed, their Being
and Constitution can not be Touched, no not by the Parlia∣ment;
They are indeed to submit to Regulations, and it can
not but be Reasonable it should be so, but none of these Re∣gulations
can affect them as a Court.</P>
<P>“It may not be unnecessary, for the sake of the <HI>English</HI> Reader,
to Explain the Terms in this Article, and to Describe the
People mentioned here, by the like kind of Offices known in
<HI>England,</HI> and to Note,</P>
<P>“1. That the College of Justice, consists of
the Lords of Session, Advocats, and Writers to
the Signet; The Lords of the Session are a Bench
of Judges, consisting of Fifteen, of whom one is Lord
President of the Session, now possest by Sir <HI>Hugh Dal∣rymple</HI>
Brother to the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI>—; These are
Judges of all Causes of private Right, like as the Court
of <HI>Queens Bench</HI> and <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> from whom Ap∣peals
lay before the Parliament, called <HI>Petitions for
Remeid of Law;</HI> Their Sallary was Two Hundred
Pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> but is now since the Union Five
Hundred Pound.</P>
<P>“2. The Court of Justiciary is a Criminal Court, con∣sisting
of Five Judges, who are called, <HI>The Lords of
justiciary,</HI> of whom the Earl of <HI>Cronterty</HI> is President or
Chief, and is called, <HI>Justice General.</HI></P>
<P>“Advocats here, are Lawyers, such as the Counsellors at Law
in <HI>England,</HI> who Plead before the Lords of the Session,
(the Judges) and give Advice, take Fees &amp;c. as the
Connsellors of the Inns of Court in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“Writers are something like Attorneys, who prosecute
Law Suits, and prepare Things in due Form for Trials
at the Bar.</P>
<P>“Writers to the Signet, are a Select Number of those by
whom all Processes must be Signed, before they can
go on in Form.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="466"/>
“It was the Subject of no small Debate here, Whether any
Writer should be capable of being Lord of the Session, or
Advocats or Counsellors only; It had been alledged, that it
was Dishonourable to the Bench of Judges, to raise any of the
Writers, which are a lower Rank of Practitioners, to the
Dignity of a Lord of the Session; That it was Advancing
them over the Heads of the Advocats, that in <HI>England</HI> no
Man arrives to the Dignity of a Judge, till he is first received
within the Bar, <HI>That is,</HI> made a Serjeant; and that till now,
Writers were not Admitted.</P>
<P>“The first Motion was even against Advocates or Clerks
of the Session too, till they had served a certain Number of
Years as Advocats; but the Writers finding themselves ex∣cluded
by that Vote, got it added after a long Debate.</P>
<P>“It remained then to Determine, what Writers should be
Qualified, and which Excluded; but as this Debate seem∣ed
something of a Surprize to the Parliament, and the whole
Faculty seemed concerned in it, it was put off to the next
day—; The Debate seemed of no great Concern to the
Publick, but as it affected private Persons, whose Interest
was at that time strong in the Parliament, it occasioned
warm Debates.</P>

<OPENER>Prayers said,
Kolls Called,</OPENER>
<P>Then the Parliament resumed the Consideration of the Debate
anent the Qualification of Writers to the Signet, before they can be
named ordinary Lords of Session: And after some further Debate
as to the time they are to serve as Writers, before they can be ca∣pable
to be named Lords, there were two States of a Vote offered;
the first in these Terms, Whether they shall serve Twenty Years, or
<HI>none,</HI> and the second in these Terms, Whether they are to serve Eight
or Ten Years; And after some Reasoning, which of the two should
be the State of the Vote, <HI>First</HI> or <HI>Second,</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Abercorn</HI> gave in a Protest against the first State of
the Vote in these Terms: “I Protest against the Stating of the first
Vote, because, which was soever it may be carried, it, in my
humble Opinion, elides one of the two Votes past Yesterday, re∣lating
to the Additional Clause; for, if it should be carried, That
a Writer to the Signet may be admitted to be an ordinary Lord
of the Session, without limiting a reasonable Time for Qualifying
himself by Experience, as to the Practical Part of the Law, then
that seems to be inconsistent with the Vote, requiring Advocats
<PB N="167" REF="467"/>
undergoing a Five Years Probation at the Bar: On the other
Hand, if the Vote should be carried for a Writers being Twenty
Years in that Station, before being capable to be named by the
Sovereign to be an ordinary Lord of the Session, that seems to be
Tantamount to an absolute Exclusion of Writers from the sad Office,
and thereupon he took Instruments.”</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>First,</HI> or <HI>Second;</HI> and it carried, <HI>Second.</HI>
Thereafter the Vote was put, <HI>Eight,</HI> or <HI>Ten Years,</HI> and it carried,
<HI>Ten Years.</HI></P>
<P>Then a Motion was made for an Additional Clause, in relation
to the Qualification of Writers in these Terms, “With this Provi∣sion,
That no Writer to the Signet be capable to be admitted a
Lord of the Session, unless he undergo a private and publick Try∣al
on the Civil Law, before the Faculty of Advocats, and be
found by them Qualified for the above-said Office, Two Years be∣fore
they shall be named to be a Lord of the Session: And after
Reasoning thereon, the Vote was stated, Add the Clause, <HI>or</HI> not.”</P>
<P>But before Voting, it was Moved, “That the Qualifications
made or to be made, for Capacitating Persons to be named ordi∣nary
Lords of Session, shall be Alterable by the Parliament of
Great-Britain; And after Debate, it was put to the Vote, <HI>Alte∣rable</HI>
or not, and it carried, <HI>Alterable.</HI>”</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, Add the Clause in relation to the Qualifi∣cation
of Writer, and it carried, <HI>Add.</HI></P>
<P>Thereafter the second Clause of the Nineteenth Article of Union
in relation to the Courts of Justiciary, was read, and agreed to.</P>
<P>And the third Clause in relation to the Admiralty, was also read,
and agreed to.</P>
<P>Thereafter the other Clauses of the said Nineteenth Article, in
relation to the Court of Exchequer and other Courts, and also the
Remainder of the Article was read, and agreed to.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, Approve of the Nineteenth Article as amend∣ed,
or <HI>not,</HI> and it carried, <HI>Approve.</HI></P>
<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION L.</HEAD>
<P>“There needs little to be said of this Days Work, our last
Observation having stated the Case, and the Vote it self be∣ing
more particular than ordinary in that Matter.</P>
<P>“The Writers to the Signet were admitted to be made or∣dinary
Lords of the Session, upon Conditions and Qualifica∣tions
as by the Minute, <HI>viz.</HI> Ten Years Continuance as Writer,
and Two Years afterward passing a Tryal before the Advocats.</P>
<P>“But it may not be Unnecessary to Note, That all this De∣bate
had some Ground for it that did not yet appear, and
some personal Views were in it on either Hand; The latter,
it can be of no use to meddle with here, but the Reasons in
general of this Debate were, to foreclose the admitting Per∣sons
<PB N="168" REF="468"/>
sons to be Judges, who had not been bred to the Law, a
Thing really Significant in it self, and which some alledged
had been but too much practised in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the great
prejudice of the College of Justice in general, the Injury of the
Gentlemen who were bred up to the Study of, and had
run thro' long Practice in the Law, and not over much to the
Reputation of the whole Session in general—; It was said
also, That there were Views of this sort at this time, and that
much of the Debate was founded upon that Head, but this I
will not affirm, it is certain, the Lawyers made no small
Struggle in the Case of Qualifications on both Sides—;
The People generally seemed very well pleased with the
Limitations, as what seemed very much to regard the Repu∣tation
of the Law, and be some Security for the time to
come, that such as shall be advanced to be Judges of the Law
shall be chosen from among those who best understand the
Law—; At last the Debate seemed to meet with some
Interruption on the Account of submitting these Qualificati∣ons
to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>—; This was op∣posed
by several sorts of People; and it may be noted, some
were for submitting this to such Alteration, which were very
warm against submitting other things—; Their Reasons
were plain to the Persons concerned, but being of no publick
Consequence to Record those things, I leave them to the Ob∣servation
of the respective Parties.</P>
<P>“It was at last settled, as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, alterable by the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Parliament; And I cannot but note, That those Gentle∣men,
who expect the Limitations, shall be enlarged by a <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Parliament, and were, on that Account, forward to sub∣ject
it to such Alteration, may very probably be disappoint∣ed,
Parliaments in <HI>England</HI> having on all Occasions, showen
themselves forward to secure a Succession of able and well
Qualified Persons to be Judges in <HI>England,</HI> and will no
doubt be careful of the same in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when ever that
case shall come before them.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION LI.</HEAD>
<P>“This was a Day for private Business, and I should have
wholly Omitted the Minute of it, but on the following Occa∣sion
—.</P>
<P>“First, to Note how the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> on all Oc∣casions,
Encouraged Learning and Industry, and particularly
the Labours and Study of Mr. <HI>James Anderson,</HI> a Gentleman
bred to the Study of the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but by his own In∣clination
led into that Painful, but most Excellent and use∣full
<PB N="171" REF="471"/>
full Study of Antiquity—; In the prosecution of which,
he had begun a mos Tedious and Chargeable Work in Search
after the Autiquities of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had formerly laid before
them the Specimens he had made of that Work, which met
with a General Approbation, and the Reward allotted him
for it, shews the sense the House had of the Greatness of the
Undertaking, which if that Gentleman live to Finish, it may
let the world know, their Money was not ill bestowed.</P>
<P>“The Naturalizing Monsieur <HI>Huguetan</HI> was a Thing lay open
to some Reflections and at first look'd meanly enough 3
The Man was fled from France, and as was said, had De∣srauded
the King of France, and private Persons also, of
great Sums of Money, and finding himself unsafe in England,
where a Commission of Bankrupt had been attempted to be
Sued out—, he sought Protestion here.</P>
<P>“However the Parliament consented to the Naturalization
—, but Limited and Restristed the Protection he sought
with such just and reasonable Clauses, at that Monsieur <HI>Hague∣tan</HI>
never thought sit to take the Benefit of it, but went
away to <HI>Holland,</HI> where, what became of him, how he was
near being Trapann'd away into <HI>France,</HI> where his Fate had
been most certain; How the States General resented the
Attempt, and punished the Persons, tho' at the same time,
they did it in Respect to their own Jurisdictions and Con∣sitution,
rather than in respect to the Person—; How
afterward he was Marryed to Madamoisell <HI>D'Odyke,</HI> in spite
of all the Opposition made by Monsieur <HI>D'Auverkirke</HI> her
near Relation, and Velt Mareschal of the Forces of the States;
These things, as not material to this History, I shall take no
notice of, and only mention the other, to let the World see,
That, tho' the Enemies of <HI>Scotland</HI> loudly clamoured, that,
for the sake of bringing Money thither, they would make
themselves the Sanctuary of the most Infamous Persons; yet,
that upon the Application of this Man, they clogg'd the Fa∣vour
they bestowed with such just Clauses in Relief of the
Claims of private Persons, that, if the Person sought
any Sanctuary against his just Debts, he found it was not to
be had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore he was so far intirely dis∣appointed.
As to his publick Affair with the Government in
France, it did not appear other than by Report, and no
publick Body could be obliged to provide against any thing
that they had no Documents to prove, and which no Body
appeared to accuse him of.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Affair of the Courts of Admiralty and Exchequer,
need very little Remark, they were by the Nineteenth Ar∣ticle
reserved, and their distinct Powers are very expresly
stated in the Article it self, nor did it occasion any great De∣bate
in the Parliament; for those Debates which were raised
upon a sopposition of the Union taking place, it was obser∣ved,
gave the House the least Trouble—, which I take to
be a further proof, that the main Design in Opposing and
Debating the Particulars, was, as they pointed at the Gene∣ral,
and it was therefore a just Observation, that any Head
of Argument became more or less vigoursly opposed, as it,
more or less pushed at the Union in General.</P>
<P>“The Office of the Lord high Admiral for all Britain, it was
absolutely necessary to reduce to one—; But the Courts of
Admiralty having their several jurisdictions &amp; Authorities were
as necessary as several private Rights, which by the next
Article were to be reserved, depending intirely upon it.</P>
<P>“The heretable Rights of Admiralty, &amp; the Vice Admiralries,
were also necessary to be supported; and all these Things
made it absolutely necessary to preserve a Court of Admiralty,
the Tryals being to be had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which by the
Constitution and Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> reserved as before, could
not be legally Transferred to, or taken Cognizance of by the
Court of Admiralty of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>“The like in the Affair of the Exchequer, where, if the Seizures
of the Customs, if private Rights and Debates between the
Queen and Subject, could not have been Tryed in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
the General Reserve af the Laws to <HI>Scotland,</HI> could not have
been maintained, and the Subject would have been put to in∣tolerable
Inconveniencies and Expences hi Pursuing and De∣fending
in all Pleas of the Crown, or Cases between the Queen
and Her Subjects.</P>
<P>“These Things therefore admitted of very little Debate,
but were regulated by the Methods required by the Customs
'and Forms of Law, and then past as it were in course.</P>
<P>“The Affair of the Privy Council was also left to its own
Fate, the Story of which I omit here, because it will come
necellarly to be spoken of in the subsequent part of this
<PB N="174" REF="474"/>
History, when it was Deposed with some Struggle, and as
some thought, a little sooner than was needful.</P>
<P>“The present Article, which I take to be a very Extensive
one, had passed, and been in all its parts Unexceptionable,
had not one unhappy Word been brought it, and this was
the word <HI>SUPERIORITIES;</HI> But this being added without
any Condition or Power left in Parliament to Dissolve them
Superiorities, upon an Equivalent to the Owners, whenever
the United Parliament should find Occasion for the publick
Good to do so; has bound down <HI>Scotland</HI> to the private
Tyrrany and Oppression of the Heretors and Lairds, Which it
is easie to make appear, is at this Time one of the greatest
Obstructions to Her Peace and Prosperity.</P>
<P>“The Superiorities meant here, are the Rights of Vassalage
which the Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> have over the People, which, as
it is Extended, gives the Chiefs and Heads of Clans, Lairds
and Heretors, such an absolute Dominion over both the Per∣sons
and Goods of the poor subjected People, as seems per∣fectly
inconsistent both with the Peace and the Improvement
of <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular, or of any Free Nation in General,
and this two ways.</P>
<P>“1. As it gives too great a Power to particular persons,
who are thereby rendred Independent of the Law, and put
in too easie a Condition to Insult the Government, and break
the publick Peace; Instances of which have been given since
the Union, as shall particularly appear in the Process of this
History, where Persons by the Assistance of their Tenantry,
and the Dominion of their own Superiorities, protected them∣selves
from the Publick Justice, and bid Defiance to the just
Resentments and Suspicions of the Government, even in a
Time of <HI>French</HI> Invasion—. That a Power to put any
one in such a posture, is inconsistent with the publick peace;
I need not spend Time hero to Dispute, and <HI>Scotland</HI> may
have, and I doubt will have occasion to acknowledge.</P>
<P>“2. As it keeps the Common People and I'enantry of <HI>Soct∣land</HI>
in a Condition incontinent with the Liberty of a Free
Nation, and under an intolerable slavery to their Landlords,
by which they are effectually prevented either Improving
their Stocks for themselves, or their Lands for their Landlords,
—, which the Landlord himself effectually prevents, by his
absolutely Ruining and Devouring their Industry at his
own will.</P>
<P>This Subject is too long for the Extent of a single Obser∣vation,
and will be more particularly spoken to in its place;
but I note it here as the proper Subject of the place, this be∣ing
the Day when it was introduced into the Treaty, and had
only this Unhappiness, that it came in, as it were, by Head
and Shoulders, without any previous Conditionary Clause
—; I do not alledge. That the Superiorities of the Gen∣try
<PB N="175" REF="475"/>
should have been taken away by Law, without Satisfacti∣on
on made to the private Estates of those, from whom they
should have been taken, farther is it yet from me to say,
or think, they should be surrendered to the Crown—;
But certainly had if been left to a Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
to have Dissolved them upon any just Occasion, and, by
Land or Money, have made a full Recompence to the Pro∣prietors,
and so have broken that Bond of Slavery by which
Scotland has been so long suppress'd, and the Poor kept Poor,
their Industry discouraged, and their Labour devoured;
From that Day the Nation had dated its Liberty and Pros∣perity;
Plenty, and Encouragement to Trade and Manu∣factures
must have followed, since no People can be supposed
to Work cheerfully, when they cannot enjoy what they gain,
or call it their own.</P>
<P>“But this was a Time of Hurry, and People could not look.
about them as at other Times; Nor was the Liberty of the
poor People so near in View, as to move that Concern in
Mens minds, which perhaps were it now to be done, might
be otherwise Whether this or the Fate of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I shall not
Determine as the Cause of the Omission—. But 'tis evi∣dent.
The Thing is <HI>Unhappily for Scotland,</HI> Omitted; And
the great Opportunity of extending the Love of Liberty, as
well as the Taste of if, to all the People Irrecoverably Lost.</P>
<P>“The Rights of the Burghs came next to be Debated, the
whole Rights of the Burrows were reserved to them by the
Union; Nor was any Thing offered now to Abridge those
Rights, yet it was thought, it both might be the Advantage
of the Burrows, and of the Nation in General, to have those
Rights subjected to Parliamentary Regulations, but some
People took an Alarm at this, as if the Parliament, in time
coming, would take away the Privileges of the Royal Bur∣rows;
and thus in this particular Time of Jealousie, the great
Advantages which both the Burghs of <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular,
and the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in General, might have had from
Parliamentary Regulations, were lost and Foreclosed, and
the Door Barr'd against any future Alterations to be made
by Parliament, were they never to much so the Advan∣tage
and Benefit of the respective Parts.</P>
<P>“The next Thing brought upon the Stage, was the Num∣ber
and Manner of Electing the Representative, it had been
moved in the Debates of the Third Article, but was pur∣posely
Adjourned to this, as the proper Time of entring upon
it—. It was too long an Affair to begin at the end of
the Day; so it was Adjourned to the next <HI>Sederunt,</HI> when
it took up Time enough.</P>

<P>The Twenty Second Article of Union again read, and thereafter

<P>Likeas, a Fifth Protest was given in by the Earl of Errol, in
these Terms, I Charles Earl of Errol, Lord High Constable of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
do hereby Protest, That the Office of High Constable of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
with all the Rights and Privileges of the same, belonging to me Here∣tably,
and depending upon the Monarchy, Sovereignty, and Antient
Constitution of this Kingdoms, may not be weakened nor prejudged by the
Conclusion of the Treaty of Union betwixt Scotland and England, nor

with all the Rights and Privileges thereof, may continue and remain
to me, and my Successors, intire and unhurt by any Votes or Acts of Par∣liament,
or other Proceedings whatsoever relative to the said Union:
And I crave this my Protestation may be Admitted and Recorded in the
Registers and Rolls of Parliament.</P>
<P>And a Sixth Protest was given in by the Earl Marischal in these
Terms, I William Earl Marischal, do hereby Protest, That whatever is
contained in any Article of the Treaty of Union betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and
England, shall no Manner of way derogate from, or be prejudicial to me,
or my Successors, in our Heretable Office of Great Marischal of <HI>Scotland</HI>

and that, at calling the Rolls, the Adherers to the above

<P>Then the Vote was put, approve the first Paragraph of the Twenty

<P>Then the second Paragraph of the said Twenty Second Article, anent

of Great Britain, beginning thus, And that when Her Majesty, &amp;c
and ending. That the Names of the Persons so Summoned and Elected,

According to the Agreement in this Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> In such manner as

the Consequence thereof, and thereupon he took Instruments.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put <HI>Approve,</HI> or Not; and it carried <HI>Approve.</HI>”</P>
<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION LIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Affair of the Number of the Representative, whether
of the Nobility or Commons, was the Contents of the first Pa∣ragraph
now debated; How, and with what Difficulty, this
part of the Equality was fettled in England, has been noted al∣ready,
and the Reasonableness of the Proportion duly stated
there.</P>
<P>“It was indeed urged again here, and several ways disput∣ed,
but the Disputes here seemed to look another way; And
first it was vigorously opposed. That <HI>Scotland</HI> should come
to any Representative at all; That her whole Parliament
should sit in Conjunction with the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, and
long Speeches were made on that Head; Some alledging,
That it was Dishonourable to <HI>Scotland</HI> to lessen the Number of
her Representative, while <HI>England</HI> retained her intire Parlia∣ment,
Others again attempted to argue against the very Uniting
of the Parliament at all, tho' that was foreclosed by the first
Vote pass'd on the Third Article—. 3. Others yet went
into the Merit of the Cause, and to Examine the just Propor∣tion
of the Representative, and these objected very vigorously,
that the Numbers were not equal—; The Opinions were
variously divided, as to the Foundation, of a true Equality, upon
what Principle an Equality of Proportions could be raised—;
Some stating the Numbers of People to be the Test of the Repre∣sentative,
others the Proportion of Taxes, some an Estimate from
both; others alledged, there could be no just Rule laid down,
how an equal Proportion of Representatives could be made, to
ballance a Kingdom that is not <HI>IT SELF</HI> equally represented,
and that before <HI>England</HI> had required <HI>Scotland</HI> to reduce their Re∣presentative
to a just Proportion to her, she ought to have reduced
her own Representative to a just Proportion to her self, either
in Number of People, or Payment of Taxes, neither of which,
as they alledged, were at all regarded in the English Representa∣tive;
That it was the Complaint in <HI>England,</HI> and several
had wrote very warmly upon that Subject, that their Taxes
were not equally Levyed, or their People equally Represented;
and it was unreasonable to talk of proportioning <HI>Scotland</HI> to
a Country, whose Represenentative was not in its self equal.</P>
<P>“There were several Answers given to this, the present Cir∣cumstances
of both Nations in general seemed to be the tru∣est
Foundation of a Proportion, wherein, tho' the particular
Towns in <HI>England</HI> might not be justly proportioned, yet the
general might be equal, and thus, without enquiring, whe∣ther
<PB N="179" REF="479"/>
the parts of the Representative were equally chosen in
England, it might be a juste Proportion, in having the whole
brought to a State; And if the Number for <HI>Scotland</HI> bare
the same Proportion to the Number far England, as the Num∣bers
or People, and Wealth or Payment of Taxes, joyntly
considered, of the one part bare to the same Articles in the
other, the Equality was then preserved—.</P>
<P>“It was remembred, That this had been fully debated in
England, and that the Number was brought up to the high∣est
Proportion that England could possibly grant—; Mr.
<HI>Seton,</HI> in his Speech printed in the Minutes herewith, Folio
79th, declared, it was above what <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to ex∣pect,
and that it was a full Proportion. Upon the whole,
this first Cause was put to the Vote, and passed by it self.</P>
<P>“The Scruples on the second Paragraph, as principally re∣lating
to the Manner of Issuing out the Writs for Elefting the
Members, when they should be Chosen for the Parliament of
Britain, I take no notice of here, referring that to the Time,
when a separate Act came to be debated in the House for the
said Election. Of which in its place.</P>

<P>“The Debate about the Pretestations of the Four Gentle∣men
above-mentioned, ended now, after some Heat, in Or∣dering
the Protestations to be Recorded and Enrolled in the
Registers of Parliament, which satisfied all Parties.</P>
<P>“It was very much enquired after, Why these Protestations
should not be made publick, since the Gentlemen that made
them, did not concern themselves to Conceal them; Same
alledged, The Parliament behoved to enter into a Confutati∣on
of the Matter of the Protests, if they made them publick,
and either to Approve or Censure them: Others thought,
The publishing them might do Harm among the people; and
that since the Parliament were now just at the End of the
Work, it was better to keep them all Easie, than start any
new Dispute. So the Protests were not published, but En∣tered
in the Rolls or Registers Office of the Kingdom of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
—, from whence the true Copies of them are taken,
and added in the appendix to this Work N. L. M. N. O.</P>
<P>“Then they went upon the Debate of Triennial Parlia∣ments,
included in the Third Paragraph of the Twenty Sc∣cond
Article—, and some were very Urgent for a new
Clause. as in the Minute—; But when the Gentlemen
Were put in mind. That by the very Words of the Paragraph,
it was expresly provided, That the First Parliament of Great-Britain
could sit no longer than the next ensuing Session,
being the Termination of the English Parliament then in
Beeing, and that by the Act then in force in <HI>England,</HI> called
The Triennial Act, every Parliament was to Terminate in
Three Years; The Thing appeared already settled, and so
admitted no further Debate, that Law being among others,
continued by the Twenty Fifth Article; of which in its or∣der.</P>

<P>The Proposal for Explaining the several Oaths to be taken

not that there could be any concealed Oath, that was not
known to the Members—; And the particular Oaths of
Allegiance, the Declaration, and Abjuration were laid before
the House—, but the Gentlemen who thought fit to Op∣pose
it, did it on this Foot, That they thought the Articles
so expresly directed to the particular Acts in which the said
Oaths were contain'd, and in which no other Oaths were ex∣pressed,
that the Acts being named at large, and referred to,
And the Custom and Usage of Parliament known, and pub∣lick,
there could be no possible Fraud, Mistake, or Miscon∣struction,

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION LVI.</HEAD>
<P>“This whole Day was taken up in debating the Subjects of
the Word Limitation, mentioned in that Famous Act of 13th
It. 3. in England—; Some had alledged, That, by that
Act, if any Parson took upon him the Crown of England, un
qualified by any of the Articles therein-named, the Allegrance
<PB N="185" REF="485"/>
Sworn was not due, and that the Subject would be thereby
obliged, by his Oath, to oppase such Successor; Others had
declared the Limitations to mean nothing but an Entail of
the Succession by Parliament, without any Conditions of Go∣vernment;
and upon these seeming Uncertainties, the Per∣sons
that moved this Clause demanded in Explanation;
but it was, upon the whole, not thought proper to undertake
any Explanation of an Act, which, as it stood, seemed suffi∣cient
to settle the Protestant Succession, and could not hurt
the present Scheme, since, so far us it might oppose any
Branch of the Union, it was provided against in the Twenty
Fifth Article; And to put any Construction upon it, which
might be inconsistent with the <HI>English</HI> Affairs, would be but
to lay a Stumbling Block in the way of the Union, and there
fore this Project was also rejected.</P>
<P>“The Affair of the Sacramental Test had been mentioned
before, but never so plainly moved in Parliament as now; it
had been moved in the Commission of the Assembly, and great
Endeavours had been used, to bring the Ministers in, as Ob∣jectors,
and a <HI>Formula</HI> like this had been proposed there, as
is noted already, but it failed on their side; The Ministers
were, in the first place, not willing to meddle with Things
of that Nature; And, secondly, As to the <HI>Formula,</HI> many
of the Ministers gave their Opinion, That they did not ap∣prove
of imposing any Oath, or Acknowledgment of the
Church, as a Test of Civil Imployment; And, to have an
Oath of Acknowledgment to the Church of Scotland be a
Counter Test, was a Tacit Approbation of the Method practi∣sed
in England, which they detested.</P>
<P>“Others again were of the Opinion, That the Subjects of
<HI>Scotland</HI> were already, by the Union, Exempted from the
Sacramental Test in England by two several Clauses—; I.
in that the Subjects of both Kingdoms were, by the Fourth
Article of the Union, to enjoy equal Privileges and Encou∣ragements
—; And, 2. That, by the Act for
the Security of the Church Government, no Oath was to be
Imposed upon the Members of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> con∣trary
to their Principles—; In arguing the first of these,
it was alledged, That, if a Subject of Scotland taking the Sa∣crament
in the National Establish'd Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall not
be capable of any Place of Preferment under the Government of Bri∣tain,
as well as a Subjects of <HI>England</HI> taking the Sacrament in the
National Establish'd Church of England; Then, do not the Sub∣jects
of either Kingdom enjoy Equal Privileges,—; And last∣ly
it was argued, That, by the last Article of the Treaty, the
Sacramental Test might be understood to be actually Repeal∣ed,
as Contraveening the Equalities of the Treaty.</P>
<P>“Upon these Debates it was thought, That, to meddle with
this Matter, might do much more Harm than Good; And
<PB N="186" REF="486"/>
therefore, it was first let fall without Doors, and now reject∣ed
within, and the Article pass'd without it.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION LVII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debates of this Day related wholly to the Privileges
of the Peers, and particularly to the differing Privilege,
<PB N="187" REF="487"/>
of those who were to sit in the Parliament of Great Britain,
from those who were not, i. e. for the time they were to sit;
Some would have had it. That those that did not sit, should
have no manner of Privilege, any more than as a Common∣er,
till such time as they should come to sit by Election in the
House of Lords, and then those that were formerly sitting
Peers, or Parliament Lords, became divested of all their Pri∣vileges,
unless they were of the New Election—; Some
thought, the Gentlemen, who were of this Opinion, moved
it chiefly, to bring the Peers into a Distaste of the Union,
(all other Hopes being now almost over, as to the Union on
the Side of <HI>Scotland</HI>)—; And that the Nobility being
thereby, as it were, degraded of their Characters, would
think it too great a Hardship, and so fly off from the Treaty
in general, or fly to some Extreme on the other Hand, make∣ing
some Demand which the Peers of England would not
submit to.</P>
<P>Others, it was thought, had this further View in the Pro∣posal,
for Levelling the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility chat were not sitting
Peers with the Commons, That they designed to propose the
unfitting Lords to be capable of being Elected into the House
of Commons, and fitting in the Lower House.</P>
<P>“This was received with some Resentment, as a great
Dishonour to the Peerage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by some people, and
especially without Doors; The English were Upbraided with
endeavouting to have it so—, in order to lessen the Cha∣racter
of the Nobility of Scotland. But in this they wrong'd
their own Judgment, as well as the English Nation, since had
such a Thing been offered, it had been rejected in England,
as Unequal and Injurious to the Equality we have been so
often speaking of, as the Ground of the whole Treaty—.
Nor could it have been Consented to in England, since it had
been a bringing the Scots Nobility into too great an Influ∣ence
of Parliamentary Affairs, when Sixteen being already
judged sufficient; there might be now Sixty One Scots Lords
in every Parliament, viz. Sixteen in the House of Lords, and
Fourty Five in the Commons; Which, when any Thing re∣lating,
especially to the Nobility, or to the Privileges of one
House against the other, might turn the Ballance to this or
that side, to the manifest Injury of the Constitution, which
now consists in the Equality of Powers and Privileges, and
the due Limits set between each kind, to prevent their In∣croachment
upon one another.</P>
<P>“But the Wisdom and Modesty of the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
prevented this—; and the Article had been so well con∣sidered
at London, and was so warily Worded, that there
was Room for little or no Exception on behalf of the Peers;
For 1. As to Privileges, the Sixteen Peers, or the Peers of
Parliament for the Time being, had effectually all the Privi∣leges
<PB N="188" REF="488"/>
of the Peers of England in the utmost Extent, and all the
Privileges they ever after could receive, could not be received
but in Common with the said Sixteen; Nor could any Ex∣ception
be made to it. Whether in the Cases of Parliamen∣tary
Privileges, or the personal Privileges in cafe of Trying of
Peers, or being Tryed as Criminals.</P>
<P>“2. The remainder of the Nobility enjoyed Privileges, every
'way equal to the English Nobility, excepting only, as it is in
the Article, the Rights of sitting in the House of Lords, and
the Privileges depending thereupon.</P>
<P>But the great Debates of this Day began upon this Clause,
The Rights and Privileges of the Scots Nobility who were not
Lords of Parliament <HI>for the Time being.</HI></P>
<P>“And First it was moved to be excepted, That the said Lords
should not enjoy the Privilege of personal Protection in Cases
of Debt, as is the Privilege of the Peers of England—, Some
alledged they pleaded for the Honour of the Scots Nobility in
this Head, that it was below their Dignity to be protected by
their Titles against their just Obligations, and a Mean nets
they had all along Contemned, to plead the Privilege of their
House against the proceedings of the Law; That it was not
agreeable to the true Intent and Meaning of Parliamentary
Privileges, that this Privilege should extend to those that did
not sit in Parliament, since the Privileges of Parliament of
this kind, were at first appointed to provide against any Im∣pediment
to sitting in Parliament, that the Members of either
Houses should on no pretence what ever, be hindred from
the Service of their Countrey in Parliament—; And
this could not be of any Signification in those Peers that were
not sitting Members of the House of Lords; That for the Seals
Peers to claim Protection for their Persons against their just
Debts, was more than levelling their Persons with the Com∣mons,
for it was setting them below the Commons, since no
Man would then Trust the Nobility in Matters of Debt, with∣out
some Commoner being Security for them, against whom
they might have remedy at Law.</P>
<P>“These Objections had no little Weight, and this Privi∣lege
of the Persons of the Peers in Cases of Debt, seemed at
first View, very grievous to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and some of the Peers
themselves looked upon it as Dishonourable.</P>
<P>“But when it was calmly Considered and Answered, That
the persons of the Peers in <HI>England,</HI> are accounted Sacred on
several Account, besides those of Debt—, that even the
Government can not proceed against a Peer, but in an Ex∣traordinary
way, that no Warrant can be Executed in the
House of a Peer, but by Three Justices of the Peace—, And
that there are several neccssary Exemptions to the Peerage
which this Privilege preserves, besides that of Debt—;
And which, as they are the Hereditary Counsellors of the
<PB N="189" REF="489"/>
Nation, and have frequently Great Trusts committed to them
—; And both are, and ought to be a great and ready
Assistance to the publick Good, upon sudden Emergencies.
which, upon pretence of Arrests and Attachments for Debt,
may be prevented. That as to the Justice of Personal Pro∣tection
in case of Debt, it was Answered, Their Estates were
not protected in several Cases, only their Persons—; And
it was as Reasonable to pursue the Estate, as the Person of the
Debitor—, and especially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the Law
reaches the Effects of the Debitor, tho' on personal Bonds
—. That as to the Credit and Honour of being protected
againest just Debts, it would be much more for the, Honour of
the Scots Nobility, that they gave all Men Notice, That they
despised the Advantage of their personal Credit, and since
they could not Sue a Nobleman, they might Decline Trusting
them, and welcome: And for those that were Trusted, tho'
they could not be Sued, it was yet greater Reputation to
them, that the principle of Honour in them was so well
known, that Men would depend upon their Honour, where
they could not otherwise oblige them to make payment.</P>
<P>“Upon these, and the like Considerations, this Motion was
Rejected, and the Scots Nobility by virtue of that Clause in
the Twenty Third Article, And pall enjoy all other Privileges
of Peers, as fully as the Peers of <HI>England</HI> now do, or as they, or
any other Peers of Great-Britain may hereafter enjoy the same;
are protected in their Persons and Estates as the Peers of
England are—, whether they (the Scots Peers) are
peers of Parliament at that Time, or no.</P>
<P>The next Dispute was, a Privilege demanded for the Peers of
Scotland, that they, not being of the Parliament at that Time,
might sit in the House of Lords Cover'd, &amp;c. but not have any
Right to Vote—; This was Urged many ways, either that
they might have a Gallery to sit in as Spectators, or that they
might stand behind the Throne, as the eldest Sons of the
English Peers may—; And either of these, was thought,
might have been obtained—. But the main Design of
bringing them in to be present at Debates, to Argue, Speak
and Debate upon the several Matters that should be brought
before the House this was Opposed upon several Accounts; First,
As it was thought Impracticable, and an Invasion of the House
of Peers as a House, and what could not be obtained, if
pusht at. Secondly, As it was thought an Insignificant Thing,
to have persons to sit and argue who had no power to De∣termine.
And Thirdly, As it would be far from any Honour
to the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be admitted into Debates,
where they must always have the Mortification of being
distinguished, and like meer Solicitors, whose place is with∣out
the Bar, be allowed to Talk, and yet have no signification
in a Question—; But if the House divided, be obliged to
<PB N="190" REF="490"/>
stand all together like Mutes in an Alphabet, who have no
found in the Expression of a Syllable.</P>
<P>“And thus ended the Debates of this great point, the Pri∣vilege
of the Peerage, and the Article received no manner
of Alteration.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LVIII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Debate of the Rank and Precedency of the Heraulds,
and of the Quartering of Arms, the Standards and Colours
was a Thing of no great Consequence, nor could it be re∣ferred
to any Body better than to Her Majesty; and therefore
the Dispute of this was not long.</P>
<P>The keeping the Honours, as they called them, in <HI>Scot∣land,
viz.</HI> The Crown, Scepter and Sword, was indeed
a Material Point, at least, as it had been made so by some
Gentlemen, who had pretended to excite the Common People
with Apprehensions, That they were to be all carried away
to England, as Tokens of Surrendering the Sovereignty of
Scotland to the English—; But, as no such Thing was
ever thought of in England, the Proposal met with no Op∣position,
And some people though, That not only the Ensigns
of Royalty, but the Royalty it self, Sovereignty and Govern∣ment
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> remain as intire as the same Things respect∣ing
England remain intire either Kingdom voluntarly con∣senting
to an Union of Power, an Union of Government,
and of all Things needful to preserve both.</P>
<P>The last Article, respecting the Abrogation of all Laws,
which might be supposed to Contraveen the Treaty, met
with no Opposition at all.</P>
<P>“And thus this Weighty Affair was Finished on the Side of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> contrary, I believe I may say, to the Expectation of all
the World, who were amazed to see a Thing of that Consequence,
and with Difficulties which seemed in themselves insuperable, so
successfully brought to a Close; A Thing which had been so many Times
attempted in vain; A Thing which had so often been set about, rather
in a Show than Design of Uniting; And I think I may say, a
Thing that never was heartily set about on both Sides before.</P>
<P>“It had held the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> a Long, a Troublesome,
a Dangerous, and I must owne a very Uncomfortable Debate,
Step by Step, and Article by Article, from the Third of October
to the fourteenth of January, with very little Intermission, for
never was Business closer applyed, more strenuously push a, or more
vigorously opposed.</P>
<P>“The Work that remained (I mean to the Parliament) was
but short, and I shall do little more than relate the Fact, which
will be found in the Minutes of Parliament—; And I shall set
them down in their Order, omitting what relates to private Busi∣ness,
as not material here—; Since I can very ill spare Room
for any thing, but what relates immediately to the Business, and
agrees with the Title—</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LIX.</HEAD>
<P>“The Articles were now gone through, and finished as before
—, yet there remained two Things to be done in or∣der
to Compleating the Affair, so far as referred to <HI>Scotland;</HI>
One was to pass the Act of Security for the Presbyterian
Church Government in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was to be Ingrossed and
Inferred in the Body of the Act of Union, &amp; made a part of it
—; And then, to pass in Parliament some subsequent Acts,
which being previous to the Treaty, or depending upon it,
ought to be Finished in Parliament before the Union, and
would be of Course Confirmed by it, by virtue of the Eigh∣teenth
Article, Continuing and Confirming all Laws and Acts,
then in Force, except such only as came within the Reach of
<PB N="193" REF="493"/>
the Twenty Fifth Article, <HI>viz.</HI> Such as were contrary to,
and inconsistent with the Union.</P>
<P>These were, 1. An Act to Settle and Determine the Con∣stutution
of the Manner of Electing the Representatives for
<HI>Scotland</HI> in the ensuing Parliament of Great Britain. 2. An
Act for Plantation of Kirks, a Thing long wanted in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
together with the Valuation of Teinds or Tithes, and about
the Reversions of Kirk Lands. 3. For the Settling the pub∣lick
Debts, Disposing and Appointing the Equivalent, i. e.
The Payment of it according to the true Intent of the Treaty,
Adjusting the Affair of the African Company, &amp;c. which
was now under Reference to a Committee.</P>
<P>“These Things were necessary Adjuncts to the Treaty—;
But as the Act of Union it self was the Foundation, on which
all these Things were depending, and that there was a great
deal yet to be done to it, <HI>viz.</HI> To be Ingrossed and pass'd
into an Act, and sent to <HI>London;</HI> The Interval of Time,
after the main Affair should be disparched, was thought the
proper Season to Settle, Pass and Enact all these Things;
wherefore they resolved to go first to Work with the Act,
and that no Time might be lost, the Act had been drawing
up, with all the Amendments to every Article, as they had
pass'd in the House, and was ready to present to the House
this Day—, And, as per the Minute, obtained a first
Reading, all other Business being delayed—.</P>

in these Terms, “We Undersubscribers, Tutors, Testamentars to
his Grace the Duke of Douglass, whereof Three is a Quorum, in
Name and Behalf of the said Puke; Forasmuch as, his Grace the
Duke of Douglass, and his Heirs, has, by their Investitures and
Honours of the Estate of Douglass, (in Consideration of the Great

<P>As also, Another Protest was given in by the Duke of Hamilton
In these Terms, “Forasmuck as, there is a Protestation made in Be∣halt
of the Duke of Douglass, in relation to his Pretensions of
having the first Seat and Vote in Parliament: Which Protestati∣on
being altogether Groundless, Therefore, I James Duke of Ha∣milton
do Protest in the contrary, in regard, that none of the said

since there were Dukes or Marquisses Created in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
my Predecessors were Dignified with Patents of Marquiss and Duke

William Earl of <HI>Angus,</HI> the said Duke his Predecessor, did,
upon the Fourth Day of June One Thousand Six Hundred and
Thirty Three Years, Resign all Right and Claim, that he, or his
Predecessors, or Successors, had, or should have to that Privilege
of first Sitting and Voting in Parliament in His Majesties Hands;

<P>And the several Protesters, or Ingivers, cook Instruments upon
their respective Protests.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LX.</HEAD>
<P>“The Act for the Union admitted now no Debate, the
Articles having been Voted and Approved One by One, as is
seen at large; So there was nothing to do, but to put
the Question upon, and to mark it a second Reading, ac∣cording
to the custom of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Church Act was to be inserted in the Body of the Act
of Union, as a part of the Treaty, and yet it was to be passed
into an Act by it self, and Touched by the Scepter in Form as
an Act of Parliament, before the Act of Union was passed,
<HI>AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE. SO,</HI> As per the Minute,
So that the Act for the Establishment of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
received a double Sanction in this Parliament; It was
not Enacted singly by the Union, as an Effect of the Treaty,
but was Established by a Law before the Union, and again
Repeated in the Body of die Treaty of Union, as a Ratifica∣tion
only or Recognition of what before was an Established
Law of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>“Of the first Representation and Petition of the Commissi∣on
of the General Assembly, I have spoken already at large;
There was some little Debate about it now, but it made no
Alteration in the Act of the Church, but it past as it had
been before settled.</P>
<P>“However, that it may be seen what Addition was made
to the first Overture, I have added both the Overture as first
given in, and the Act as it was passed in Parliament, and
what more was required, will be seen in the Representation
of the Commission; All which are added in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P>“It is to be observed here. That there was a second Re∣presentation
and Petition presented to the Parliament this
Day from the Commission at the General Assembly, upon the
following Occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="496"/>
“The Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> having been effectually secured by
an Act of Parliament, called, The Act of Security, &amp;c. and
which was made a part of the Act of Union, as appears in its
place; There was a Clause added in the End of the Act of
Union, in these Words; Declaring nevertheless, that the Par∣liament
of <HI>England</HI> may provide for the Security of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> as they shall think Expedient, to take place within
the Hounds of the said Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and not Derogating
from the Security Above provided for Establishing the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> within the Sounds of this Kingdom, which shall not
Suspend or Derogate from the Force and Effect of this present Ra∣tification,
but shall be understood as here included, without any
necessity of arty new Ratification in the Parliament of Scotland.</P>
<P>This was called, an Establishing the Church of <HI>England</HI>
with the Hierarchy of Episcopacy and Ceremonies of the
Church of England, by the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
I have for the more dire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Understanding this Part, given the
said Representation and Petition in the Appendix N K x.
with the Reasons at that Time given for it, to which I re∣ser.</P>
<P>“I could not suffer the two Protestations of the Families of
Douglass and Hamilton, to be Omitted in the Minutes, tho'
with respect to the length of this Work, I have Industriously
shun, d private Affairs, but the Honour of Leading the Van of
the Scots Armies, which these Families Contended for, might
give both the Kingdoms a Remembrance of what the Union
has delivered them from, since these Armies were only such
as within the Bowels of this poor Island Fought with, and
shewed their Courage, in Butchering and Destroying one ano∣ther,
a Thing, its hoped, is now effectually put to an End.</P>
<P>“The Affair of War is now carried Abroad, against the an∣cient
professed Enemy of all Protestant Powers, where the
English and Scots Valour need no more Contend, but Unite to∣gether
to Overthrow their Foreign Adversaries—, a Contest,
which it they had been United in, as they are now, in for∣mer
Ages, perhaps Europe had paid Honours enough to Us
before now, as to the greatest Nation in the World.</P>
<P>This is the Famous Day to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which She set Her Signal
to the Union of Great Britain; We shall now make a short Digres∣sion,
to Enquire how it went on in the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and
what Reception it met with there, which, because it is but very
short, I shall bring inhere, and adjourning the Minutes a little, shall

<HEAD>Of the Act of Ratification after it was past
in the Parliament; Scotland, till the
Exemplification of it was returned from
the Parliament of England.</HEAD>
<P>The Parliament of England, being to be the Finishers of this great
Work, and the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> not Meeting till it was late
enough in the year, <HI>viz.</HI> the second of October; The English Par∣liament
were by small Adjournment, put off, as long as it was
possible the publick Affairs of England could permit, and longer
than any Parliament since the Revolution had been delayed, not ha∣ving
Met till the Third of December—, when the publick Business
admitting no more delay, they came together.</P>
<P>It is worth Observation, that this was a Orange concurring
Juncture, a Critical Moment, as it may be called, in which Provi∣dance
seemed to bring every Thing together, that could Propagate
the Great Affair of the Uniting the Kingdoms; And which it may
not be Improper to Notice in this place, because at the Opening of
this Session of the English Parliament, the Queen Her self took No∣tice
of it.</P>
<P>The Campaign Abroad had Ended in the most Glorious manner
for the Confederates, that could be desired, and above all manner
of Expectation, the French had received three Blows that very Sum∣mer,
enough to Overthrow the greatest: Empire in the World;
One under the Conduct of the Earl of Peterburgh, with the English
Forces and Fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> Relieving the City of Barce∣lona,
and causing the <HI>French</HI> with the Loss of all their Cannon and
Ammunition, to raise the Siege; One under the Command of the
Duke of Marlborough, being the great Victory at <HI>Ramellies</HI> in Flan∣ders;
And the last under the Command of Prince Eugene of Sa∣voy,
at <HI>Turin.</HI> ill all which Actions, it was Calculated, that the
trench lost. Slain in Action, Taken Prisoners, Deserted, and Dead
of their Wounds, above 100000 Men, with 300 pieces of Cannon
and Mortars, and other Spoil without, and indeed past all manner
of Account.</P>
<P>There are two Reasons, why I take this Occasion to mention
this here—, and both are Introductory to the present Affair.</P>
<P>1. The People of <HI>England</HI> by these great Successes, made
Glad and Easie in Hopes of a speedy Peace, were prepared to
Grant almost any thing which the Queen in Reason could; Ask
and the Queen discovering a passionate Desire, to see Her two
Jarring, long Contending Kingdoms United, the Parliament
came together with a Temper disposed to yield (as far as
Reason could suggest) more, than perhaps at any other
juncture could have been expected.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="498"/>
2. The Enemies of the Union, whether Abroad or at Home,
received most sensible Discouragement in their Designs against
it—, and first Abroad.</P>
<P>There could be but two kinds of Enemies Abroad, to the
Union, and these were the <HI>French,</HI> or the Dutch.</P>
<P>As to the Dutch, they were now in so closs a Confederacy with
<HI>England,</HI> and their whole Concern as to the War, was so involved
together, that there was no Room for any publick Differences about
it. Nor indeed could the Dutch have put in any rational Objection
against it, to either Side, if the Interest of Holland. Clasht with
the Union upon any sort, it was only with respect to Trade; and
tho' they might perhaps on that Score, have some Reason to be
Jealous of it, as what might <HI>some Time or other</HI> Clash with them
in the Fishing and Eastern Trades, yet they could have no pretence
to concern themselves publickly and Nationally against it. And
as for private Negotiations to Embarrass or prevent it, tho'as
<HI>I have been Informed,</HI> they were once or twice considering of it,
yet they never thought sit to meddle, whether it was that they saw
no prospect of succeeding in it, or that they were not willing to do
any thing a that Time, that should give an Uneasiness to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
or not, I shall not pretend to Determine.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>French,</HI> these had no doubt Stomach enough to it, and
had Tools enough to work with; And I must own, had they but
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made the least, Attempt, they had effectually broke up the Treaty
for that Time; But GOD had tyed their Hands, and Cut them
out other Work, they were beset and Embarrast: on every Hand, and
had no Leasure to look this ways; Nor, it they had had Leasure,
had they Men or Money then to spare, being Imployed with all
their Power and Diligence, to Recruit their Troops, and Restore
their own Affairs.</P>
<P>And I cannot but Record this, as a singular Hand of Heaven, in
the Affairs of Union; For tho', when the next year the <HI>French</HI>
did make an attempt upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> when their Affairs being bet∣ered
after their Suceess in <HI>Spain,</HI> they thought themselves in a
Condition for—, they sound it too late;, And that the Op∣poser
On the Union were settled, and Would not appear for them—yet
I msst say, had they made that Attempt at the Time
pf this Trety, whasever they might have done in the End, to∣wards
Opening the eyes of the people, and Restoring them to, their
Senses, they had certainly put all the Nation into the utmost con∣fusion
For the time, and effectually have broken up the Treaty.</P>
<P>The parliament, of <HI>England</HI> was now met <HI>December</HI> 3.1707, &amp; the

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope We are all Met together at this Time, with Hearts truly
Thankful to Almighty GOD for the Glorious Successes, with
which He has Blested Our Arms and those of Our Allies through
the whole Course of this Year, and with serious and Steady Re∣solutions
to Prosecute the Advantages We have Gain'd, till We
Reap the Desired Fruit of them, in an Honourable and Durable
Peace</P>
<P>The Goodness of GOD has brought this Happy Prospect so much
nearer to Us, That if We be not wanting to Our selves, We may,
upon good Grounds, Hope to See such a Ballance of Power Esta∣blisht
in <HI>Europe,</HI> that it shall no longer be at the Pleasure of one
Prince to Dseurb the Repose, and Endanger the Liberties of this
Part of the World.</P>
<P>A Just Consideration of the present Posture of Affairs, of the
Circumstances of Our Enemies, and the good Disposition at Our
Ailies, must needs Excite an Uncommon Zeal, and Animate Us
to Exert Oar Utmost Endeavours at this Critical Conjuncture.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P>As I fully Perswared You are all of this Mind, so I must Ear∣nestly
Desire You to Grant Me Supplies sufficient for Carrying on
the War next Year in so Effectual a Manner, that We may be
able to Improve every where the Advantages of this Succesful
Campaign: And I Assure You I shall make it my Business to See
All You Give Apply'd to those Ends with the greatest Care and
Management.</P>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>In Purtunce of the Power Vested in Me by Act of Paril∣ment
both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> I have appointed Commissio∣ner
to Treat of an Union between the Two Kingdom, and
tho' this be a Work of such a Nature, as could not but be at∣tendent
with great Difficulties, yet such has been the Application
of the Commissioner, that they have Concluded a treaty, which
is at this Time before the Parliament of Scotland; And I Hope
the Mutual Advantage of an Entire Union of the Two Kingdoms
will be found so apparent, that it will not be long before I shall have an Opportunity of Acquainting You with the Success which
it has Met with there.
Your Meeting at this Time being Later than Usual, I cannot
Conclude, without Earnestly Recommending to You to Give as
<PB N="200" REF="500"/>
much Dispatch to the Publick Affairs, as the Nature of them will
Admit, it being of the Greatest Consequence, that both Our Friends
and Our Enemies shou'd be Fully Convinced of Your Firmuess,
and the Vigour of Your Proceedings.</P>
<P>I shall not meddle here with any of the Proceedings of the par∣liament
of <HI>England</HI> in their own Affairs, they having no relation
to the Case in Hand; Only make this short Remark, That, not∣withstanding
the Lateness of their coming together, <HI>the Occasion of
which was known to be to attend the Debates of</HI> the Parliament of Scot∣land,
they fell so heartily about their Business, and went on so
smoothly in every Thing, that they got the Land Tax Bill past ra∣ther
sooner in it than it used to be in. any former Parliaments—;
And before Christmass, had not only the Land Tax, but several
other of their Publick Funds settled, and in an unusual Forward∣ness
—-, which is a Confirmation of the Extraordinary Dispositi∣on,
which, as I have noted, appeared in England at this time, and
of which we shall see further Instances presently.</P>
<P>It was the Sixteenth Day of January, that the Ratification of
the Union pass'd in <HI>Scotland;</HI> On the Eighteenth the Duke of
Queensberry dispatch'd it away by an Express; There were several
Gentlemen who contended for the Honour of Carrying it up to the
Queen, but, to avoid giving any Offence, it was sense by an
ordinary Courrier or Express.</P>
<P>As soon as it came to the Queen, Her Majesty caused it to be
laid before both Houses, that, tho' it was first to pass one House,
and then the other, yet the particular Houses might be upon the
several Articles together.</P>
<P>Great was the Expectation ill both Kingdoms from these De∣bates
of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Fears on one
Hand, and the Hopes on the other, are not to be express'd—,
but the House of Commons deceived both Sides.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Second of <HI>January</HI> it was read in the House of
Commons—-. and as the best way to to thro' the whole, they
ordered every Article to be Read and Voted upon singly in the
Committee of the whole House.</P>
<P>It may perhaps surprize Posterity, when the Debates, Disputes,
Heats and long <HI>Speeches,</HI> which these Articles occasioned in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
conic to he read—, and they shall come to understand, that, in
the House of Commons in <HI>England,</HI> every Article pass'd one by one
after the Sedatest Reading, Calmest Considering, and Leasurely Pro∣ceeding,
without any Opposition, Amendment or Alteration, no
not in the least.</P>
<P>There was some small Opposition against it in general in the
House of Lords—, but no Amendment offered to any particular
Article, nor any thing cansiderable objected; what was objected
seems generally contained in some Protests, and Reasons
given in by the Persons Protesting against it, which were but few,
and not much noticed.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="501"/>
At the same time that the Articles were Reading in the House
of Commons, an Act was also prepared by the Bishops, to whom
that Affair was referred for Security of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to
be passed in the Parliament, and then Ratified, by being Inserted
in the Body of the Act of Union, as the Act for the Security of
of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had been done before.</P>
<P>This had been so far provided for by a Blank left in the Treaty
of Ratification to which, so far as it concerned the Security of
the Church of <HI>England</HI> only, the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> declared
themselves to assent, as if it was expressed; And this was thought
but just, the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> having had the Drawing up,
and Wording of their own Act of Security themselves, tho' some
People made loud Objections against this, as a plain Establishing
Episcopacy in <HI>England</HI> by the very Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It was indeed leaving the Thing as Self-existent, as it was pos∣sible,
it was absolutely necessary, That the Treaty of Union should
be Ratified by either Kingdom—; But, as to the Acts severally
Establishing the respective Churches, they were the distinct Act and
Deed of either Kingdom: And, if the <HI>Scots</HI> may be said to have
Consented to Establish Episcopacy, it is every whit as plain, That
the <HI>English</HI> have Establish'd Presbytery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with this fur∣ther
Distinction, That what has been done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is an Act
of the State only, in <HI>England</HI> both Church and State have given
their Sanction to the Establishment of the Presbyterian Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> the Bishops being the Representatives of the Church of
<HI>England</HI> in this Case—; At the same Time, I think the Matter
clear, That, with respect to Union, their Establishment is Recipro∣cally
secure, and either Kingdoms cannot now put their Hand to the
Weakening or Injuring the Establishment of the other, without
setting, at the same time, its Hand to the Destruction of its own
Constitution.</P>
<P>This Act for the Security of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> seems to be
the exact Copy of the Act for Security of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
with the necessary Alterations only of Names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A Testimony
indeed unexpected to the Sufficiency of the Act of Security for <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
in that the Church of <HI>England</HI> Divines being left to their full
Liberty to make their Constitution as safe as it was possible to be,
contented themselves with the very same Model which the <HI>Scots</HI> had
pass'd for themselves, as the best and compleatest Security they
could devise—, which they that cavilled so much at the Securi∣ty
of the Act in <HI>Scotland</HI> as insufficient, might have received great
Satisfaction from, if they had thought fit—.</P>
<P>The Copy of this Act in <HI>England</HI> is added in the <HI>Appendix, N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>I need not Count Days, nor Enter into the Minutes of this Affair
in the <HI>English</HI> Parliament; It may suffice to tell the Reader, That
the whole Act pass'd both Houses by the Fourth of <HI>Marc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> and the

whole Island waited so much for, and had their Eyes upon, went
to the House of Lords on the Sixth of <HI>March,</HI> and having pass'd
the Bill, made the following Speech, with which I think I may
close this short Period of the Union, I mean its passing in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>“There was some Opposition made to the Articles in the

the several Articles, and some against all of them—; But
the House of Lords in <HI>England</HI> having, expresly forbid the

at the Passing the UNION</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is with the greatest Satisfaction, that I have given my Assent
to a Bill, for the Uniting <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> into one Kingdom.</P>
<P>I consider this UNION as a Matter of the greatest Importance to
the Wealth, Strength and Safety of the whole Island; And at the
same time, as a Work of so much Difficulty and Nicety, in its
own Nature, That, till now, all Attempts which have been made
toward it, in the Course of above an Hundred Years, have proved
ineffectual. And therefore I make no doubt, but it will be remem∣bred
and spoke of hereafter, to the Honour of those who have been
Instrumental in bringing it to such an Happy Conclusion.</P>
<P>I desire and expect from all my Subjects of both Nations, That,
from henceforth, they Act with all possible Respect and Kindness
to one another, That so it may appear to all the World, they have
Hearts disposed to become one People.</P>
<P>This will be a great Pleasure to Me, and will make Us all quickl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sensible of the good Effects of this UNION.</P>
<P>And I cannot but look upon it as a particular Happiness, That, in
My Reign, so full a Provision is made for the Peace and Quiet of My
People, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Security of Our Religion, by so firm an Esta∣blishment
of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>otestant Succession throughout <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>

Readiness in this Particular, as You have done in all the other
Parts of this great Work.</P>

<DIV4>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The Season of the Year being now pretty far advanced, I hope
You will continue the same Zeal which has appeared throughout this
Session, in dispatching what yet remains unfinished of the Publick
Business before You.</P>
<P>It took up some time in <HI>England,</HI> to Ingross and Inroll, and make
Copies of this great Transaction, the Original of which was to be
Lodged in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and an Exemplification under the
Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> to be sent down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be again
Read in Parliament there, and then laid up in ihe Registers and
Rolls of Parliament <HI>in perpetuam rei memoriam.</HI></P>
<P>I must now return to the Minutes of the Parliament, where se∣veral
Things subsequent to the Treaty, but really absolutely ne∣cessary
to its Existence, was to be Finished, and which took them
up the Time between the sending up the Ratification, and receiving
down the Exemplification, as above.</P>

<OPENER>Prayers Said,
Rolls Called,</OPENER>
<P>Upon Reading of the Minutes, it was Moved to insert therein
the Petitory part of the Representation and Petition of the Com∣mission
of the General Assembly of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> menti∣oned
in the said Minutes. And after Debate thereon, the Vote was
stated, <HI>Insert the Petitory part of the said Representation and Petition,</HI>
Yea, <HI>or</HI> Not.</P>
<P>And after further Debate, the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> made a Motion
for a State of a Vote, wherein the Petitory part of the said Petition
was repeated; But that State of the Vote being reclaimed against,
as yielding the Question, the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> protested, <HI>That he
having made Motion, and being seconded, it was against the Rule of
Parliament to refuse a Vote; and to imsert his Motion in the Minutes</HI></P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>Insert the Petitory part of the above Repre∣sentation
and Petition in the Minutes,</HI> Yea <HI>or</HI> Not. And it carried
<HI>Not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="504"/>
<HI>Thereafter it was moved, That conform to the Minutes of the
fifteenth of</HI> January <HI>instant, the Parliament proceed to consider the
manner of electing the Representatives for</HI> Scotland <HI>to the Parlia∣ment
of Great-Britain: Whereupon a Resolve was given in and
Read in these Terms,</HI> Resolved that the sixteen Peers, and fourty five
Commissioners for Shires and Burrows, who are to be the Members to
the first Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for and on the part of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
be chosen out of this present Parliament: And that the Members so
chosen, be the Members of the first Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> if Her
Majesty shall declare on or before the first day of <HI>May</HI> next, that the
Lords and Commons of the present Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> be the
Members of the first Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for and on the part of
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And after Reasoning thereon, the further Debate was adjourned

<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION LXI.</HEAD>
<P>“It was not very easie to know the Reason, why they de∣sired
the Petitory part, as they called it, of this Paper to be
inserted in the Minutes—; Some were of the Opinion, it
was to show the Nation, That the Opposers of the Union
were Friends to the Church, and that they would have it ap∣pear,
they stood up for the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>—; Others
thought it was with design to Expose the Presbyterians to
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as utter Enemies to their Constitution—;
Nor could I ever hear any other Reasons given for
it—. However, the Duke after having with some Di∣ficulty
obtained a Vote upon it, <HI>LOST IT;</HI> And so the Re∣presentation
and Petition was left just where they found it,
<HI>viz.</HI> As a Testimony of the Church against some Things which
were thought to Clash, both with their Constitution and a
little with their Principles, and in this it was thought it had
its Uses, tho' it was not effectually Answered in Parlia∣ment.”</P>
<P>“The Affair of the Electing their Members for the first Par∣liament
of <HI>Britain,</HI> came next upon the Stage, and the
Ground of the Motion mentioned in the Minutes, was foun∣ded
upon a Supposition mentioned in the Twelfth Article of
the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Her Majesty on or before the first day of
May, on which day the Ʋnion was to take place, should declare
under the Great Seal of England,</HI> <HI>that it is Expedient that the
Lords of Parliament of</HI> England, <HI>and Commons of the present
Parliament of</HI> England, <HI>should be the Members of the respective
Houses of the first Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for and on the
part of</HI> Great-Britain. Now it was thought very equal, that it
the <HI>then present <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting</HI> Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> should be Nam∣med
<PB N="205" REF="505"/>
for the first Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in Conjunction
with the several Members that should be Named from <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
that the Members of both Houses which were to Re∣present
<HI>Scotland,</HI> should be likewise Named out of the current
or then present sitting Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>“It was pretty easie to conjecture, that Her Majesty would
appoint these Members of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, to Consti∣tute
the first <HI>British</HI> Parliament, as it after happened, and
therefore this was Moved now—, in order to settle it in
the Act of Parliament now to be made, in which it was ab∣solutely
necessary to be Determined, this Matter being to be
Signed, and past into a Law, before the Union was to take
place—. What vigorous Opposition it met with, will be
seen in the next Observation.</P>

<P>The Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> Swore the Oath of Alledgeance, subscribed the

<P>Then the Resolve insert in the former Days Minutes, anent choo∣sing
the Representatives for <HI>Scotland</HI> to the first Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
was again read.</P>
<P>And after Reasoning thereon, an Overture was given in for esta∣blishing
a certain Way for Electing the Representatives of <HI>Scotland</HI>
to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in all time coming, in the Terms
of the Treaty of Urion, which was Read; And thereafter another
Overture was offered for an Act for choosing the Sixty One Members
to Represent <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> As also,
a Resolve was given in and Read, That previous to all other Business,
the Parliament proceed to determine the manner of Electing the Repre∣sentatives
for Scotland <HI>to the Parliament 0f</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>and to de∣termine
the Number and</HI> Quota <HI>of Barons and Burrows.</HI></P>
<P>And after Debate the Vote was stated, <HI>Approve the Resolve insert

<P>But before Voting the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> gave in a Protestation in
these Terms, “I <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> do hereby protest for my
self, and in Name of all those who shall adhere to this my Pro∣testation,
against the Electing by this present Parliament the Six∣teen
Peers and Fourty Five Barons and Burrows, who are to Re∣present
<HI>Scotland</HI> in the first Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as incon∣sistent
with the whole Tenor of the Twenty Second Article of the
Treaty of Union, and contrair to the express Words thereof,
<PB N="206" REF="506"/>
whereby it is provided, that after the Time and Place of the
Meeting of the said Parliament, is appointed by Her Majesties
Proclamation, which Time shall not be less than Fifty Days after
the Proclamation, a Write shall be immediately issued under the
Great-Seal of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> directed to the Privy Council of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
for Summoning the Sixteen Peers, and for Electing Fourty
Five Members, by whom <HI>Scotland</HI> is to be Represented in the Par∣liament
of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> And further, as utterly Subversive of the
Right of Election competent to the Barons and Burrows of this
Kingdom, and desires this my Protestation may be insert in the
Minutes and Records of Parliament, and thereupon takes Instru∣ments.”</P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>William Cochran</HI> of <HI>Kilmaronock</HI> gave in a Protestation
in these Terms, “I Mr. <HI>William Cochran</HI> of <HI>Kilmaronock</HI> do protest
in my own Name, and in Name of all those that shall Adhere to
this my Protestation, that the Electing of Members to Represent
this part of the United Kingdom in the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
out of this present Parliament, by the Members of this
House, is contrary to, and inconsistent with the Birth-rights and
Privileges of the Barons and Burrows of <HI>Scotland;</HI> That it is con∣trary
to the Principles of common Law, and divers Acts of Parli∣ament,
and directly opposite and contradictory to the express
Words and Meaning of two several Paragraphs of the Twenty Two
Article of the Treaty of Union betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> so
lately Ratified in this House; And I desire this my Protestation
may be insert in the Minutes, and Recorded in the Books of Parlia∣ment,
upon which I take Instruments.”</P>
<P>And after Heading of the above Protestations, each of the said
Protesters took Instruments upon their respective Protestations, and
adhered to the Protestation given in by the other; and it was agreed
that the Members Votes be marked, and that the List of their Names
as they Vote be Printed and Recorded, and that at calling the Rolls
the Adherers to the above Protests be also marked.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>Approve the Resolve insert in the former

<P>Thereafter an Overture given in and Read, for appointing the
manner of Electing the Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
to be by dividing the Peerage into Four several Classes,
out of which they are to be chosen, with same regard to the seve∣ral
Ranks of Peers, in manner mentioned in the said Overture.</P>

<P>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION LXII.</HEAD>
<P>“The Reason of the Earl of <HI>Stair's</HI> taking the Oaths now,
and his place in Parliament, was very Unhappy at this
Time; his Father the Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI> justly reputed the greatest
Man of Counsel in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> died sudden∣ly
the Eighth of this Moneth—; he had been an Eminent
Instrument in carrying on the Union, and had, the very day
of his Death, spoken very Earnestly in the House, upon some
particular Cases relating to the Union, he went out of the
House not very Well, yet went Home, and Wrote several
Letters that very Night to <HI>England,</HI> and in the Morning Died
in his Bed, without being able to speak so much as to his
Lady, who was with him, to the general Grief of the whole
Island, being Universally Lamented.</P>
<P>“The Debate was now renewed about Choosing the Repre∣sentatives
for the first Parliament, the principal Objection was
against Choosing them out of the current Parliament—;
As to the Allegations of its being against Law and Constituti∣on,
and against the Twenty Second Article of the Treaty just
then ratified, they all Center'd in this, that it was to be
passed and approved by Parliament; And that Parliament
having yet the whole Legislature in their Hands, had power
to Repeal any Law, or Statute then in Beeing, and conse∣quently
did so far repeal any Clause in any Act of Parliament
formerly made—; As to its being against the Treaty
now ratified, that was Ractified thus, That whereas the Act
of Ratification of the Treaty of Union in the Parliament of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> in which several Acts since made and to be made
in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were yet to be inserted, lay
now before the Parliament of <HI>England</HI>—; What ever Me∣thod
the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> thought fit to take, for the
Nomination of the Members of Parliament, for the first Par∣liament
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> should, and of Course also
be inserted, and so be and become in Essential Part or
Branch of the Union; And this having passed as <HI>per</HI>
the Minute, is inserted in he laid Act or settling the Election
<PB N="208" REF="508"/>
of the Members, and again Recited in the Act of Union,
as <HI>per</HI> the Exemplification, appears, in these Words,
<HI>in that Case only, Doth hereby</HI> Statute <HI>and</HI> Ordain, <HI>That the
Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Commissioners for Shires and
Burghs, who shall be Chosen by the Peers, Barons and Burghs res∣pectively
in this present Session of Parliament, and out of the
Members thereof, in the same manner as Committees of Parlia∣ment
are usually now Chosen, shall be the Members of the res∣pective
Houses of the said First Parliament of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>for
and on the part of</HI> Scotland; <HI>Which Nomination and Election
being Certifyed by a Write under the Lord Clerk Register's Hand
of the said First Parliament of</HI> Great Britain; <HI>As by the said
Act passed in</HI> Scotland, for settling the Manner of Electing
the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Members to Represent <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
in the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> may appear; <HI>Be it
therefore further</HI> Enacted <HI>and</HI> Declared <HI>by the Authority afore∣said,
That the said last mentioned Act passed in</HI> Scotland, for
settling the Manner of Electing the Sixteen Peers and Fourty
Five Members to Represent <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Parliament of
<HI>GREAT BRITAIN,</HI> as aforesaid, <HI>shall be, and the same is
hereby Declared to be as valid, as if the same had been part of,
and Ingrossed in the said Articles of Union, Ratified and Ap∣proved
by the said Act of Parliament of</HI> Scotland, <HI>and by this Act
as aforesaid,</HI> and carried it for the New Model; The Two
Protestations against it made a great Noise, and were print∣ed
and carryed all over the Kingdom, besides their being
printed in the Minutes of Parliament. Some said, the chief
Reason why they insisted on this so much was, That the
Party who opposed the Union foresaw, that, as they had
been outvoted and overpowered, as they called it, in every
Question relating to the Union, so they would be in this,
and that, by Consequence, few or none of them would be
Named to the First British Parliament, which was really true
in the Consequence.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS LXIII, LXIV, LXV.</HEAD>
<P>“I put thse three Minutes together, because they are all on
the same Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> The Electing the Representatives to the
<PB N="211" REF="511"/>
Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which was now to be formed
into an Act by it self.</P>
<P>“There had been several Schemes of Elections laid down
for the Peers, and three Overtures had been presented to
the House—; Some were for Naming the several Fami∣lies,
and Fixing the Representative to be Chosen out of
them Exclusively—, and these were those who pretended
to make Distinctions between the Ancient and Modern No∣bility
—; They thought it was reasonable, since the Num∣bers
of Noblemen lately made, and especially in the last
Thirty or Fourty Years, were but burdensome as they al∣ledged,
to the Nation, that those Families newly made Noble
should relinquish this Affair to the Ancient Nobility, as what
was Inherent in them, but a new Accession to these; and that,
since <HI>Scotland</HI> was to Retrench her Nobility, as to fitting in
Parliament, it was but just they should be preferred, who
had the most Ancient Title.</P>
<P>“Others were for dividing the Nobility into Four Classes,
and taking every Year a proportioned Number out of each
Clafs.</P>
<P>Others were for taking by Rotation, and so, beginning
at the Extremes, take the Families as they Rise, either be∣ginning
at the eldest or youngest Peers.</P>
<P>“But all these Methods were rejected, and that of Election
carryed it, whether it were, that each Party thought them∣selves
able to carry it from the other, or that they thought
it their Advantage, that they should carry it, who could
make the best Interest I know not—; But I cannot say
they took the best way for the preserving the publick Tran∣quillity,
since the Factions and Party-makings for the Interest
of Elections, which musl necessarily be the Consequence of
this Method, cannot but keep up a constant Feud of Parties
and Families in the Nation, which nust necessarily be renew∣ed
every Three Year, the Parliament being to be new
Chosen so osten—; During which time, the Parties will
be at Work, to Cultivate, Encrease, and Fortify their se∣veral
Interests, which, <HI>it is to be doubled,</HI> will go a great
way to Entailing a Spirit of Division and Party-serife upon
the whole Nation——; I wish I may be found to have
made a wrong Conjecture,—-, but I shall have Occasion to
speak to this again in the Process of this Story, and to ob∣serve,
how too much of this was made good in the very first
Election, <HI>I mean,</HI> for the second <HI>British</HI> Parliament. Of
which hereafter—.</P>
<P>“After the settling of the Affair of the Peers, it was to be
Determined how the Fourty Five Members for the House of
Commons should be proportioned, and this was prepared
for them before hand and given in in a Scheme or Overture
which occasion Dispute—; The number of the
<PB N="212" REF="512"/>
Shires and Counties and Stewartries that formerly Elected,
were these were now to be reduced by joyn∣ing
Two or Three together, where they were small and re∣mote,
to Thirty Members, each County choosing none but
One—, and each Head of Counties, where any were joyn∣ed
together, choosing but One—, the Burghs or Royal
Burrows were in Number, these were Formed
into Classes or Districts—, and were for each District to
choose one Member; And because the meeting together of
the Votes in the said Burghs, might be both Chargeable and
Inconvenient, a <HI>Medium</HI> was found our, each Burgh was to
choose a Commissioner, in the same manner as usual, which
Commissioner was to meet with the Commissioners of the other
Burghs of that District, and these were to choose the Mem∣ber.</P>
<P>“The respective Persons concerned, made some Opposition
about the Joyning of Shires—, but this had been a Thing
well Concerted, and therefore admitted the less Dispute in
the House; the Persons also who had made the Calculations,
being prepared to Defend the Equalities of it—; It re∣mained
therefore to agree on the Partition of the Counties
and Towns, or as called in the Minutes, Barons and Burghs,
which was done with little Dispute, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>“The Motion against the Eldest Sons of Peers, had not a little
to be said for it, particularly that when the Influence of the
Nobility in <HI>Scotland</HI> comes to be considered, with the small
Number of Members to be chosen, it might in time to come
rise to what was Hinted before, in the Project of reducing the
Lords that did not sit in the House of Peers, to a Level with
the Commons, and make them capable of sitting in the House
of Commons, that then it might come to pass, that <HI>Scotland</HI>
should be Represented only by her Nobility, and that there
should be <HI>Scots</HI> Lords in the Parliament of <HI>Britain;</HI> So here
in time it might happen, that the Nobility in the House of
Peers, and their Eldest Sons in the House of Commons,
might make up the whole Representative of <HI>Scotland</HI>—.</P>
<P>“There were a great many Arguments brought against this
Proposal, but these seemed the most prevailing, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“1. That it had been always allowed in <HI>Scotland</HI> before,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Eldest Sons of Peers might be Elected.</P>
<P>“2. That in <HI>England</HI> the Eldest Sons of Peers do sit in the
House of Commons, and it would break in upon the Rule
of Equalities, to alter it, and put the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen in a
worse Condition than the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>“After some time a Vote was offered that put it to an End,
<HI>viz.</HI> To let the Right of being Elected remain just as it was,
without any Alteration at all, that he that had a Right or
<PB N="213" REF="513"/>
Capacity to Vote, or to be chosen before, should have so
still; And this ended the Debate.</P>

<P>And after Reasoning thereon, a draught of an Act was offered set∣tling
the manner of Electing and Summoning the sixteen Peers and
fourty five Commoners, to Represent <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Parliament of

<P>Which being read, it was moved, to proceed to consider that

of the said Shire, that the Vote now to be put for approving the
Conjunction of the said Shire of <HI>Caithness</HI> with <HI>Bute,</HI> or any other of
the lesser Shires, is against our Right of being always separately repre-sented
in Parliament, and that because the Rule of reducing Shires is by
their Valuation and fix only to be reduced, the Shire of <HI>Caithness</HI>
ought to enjoy its Representation as other greater Shires, and the Shire
of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> being less in Valuation than <HI>Caithness,</HI> ought to be
enjoyed with the other lesser five Shires: <HI>Which being read, he took
Instruments thereupon, and Mr.</HI> James Dumbar <HI>younger of</HI> Hemp∣rigs
<HI>the other Commissioner for the said Shire of</HI> Caithness <HI>adhered thereto</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>“This Proposal was ill received indeed, and a horrid Cla∣mour
raised at it without Doors; The People who had
been hot against the Union took hold of it with an Unbridled
Railery, Reproaching the Treaters in a most Indccent Man∣ner,
Exclaiming at the very Thing it self; Now the Nation
might see they said what they had been doing at <HI>London,</HI>
and what they had been pursuing ever since that they had sold
their Country fora Sum of Money, &amp; they were beginning to share
it among them, this referred to the Equivalent out of which
this Money was to be paid—; That they Voted for one
another, the new Commissioners and the old; and that this
was taking that Money away to their private uses, which
they had pretended was to lmployed in Incouragingg the
<PB N="117" REF="517"/>
Manufactures and Imploying the Poor, Raising Stocks for the
Woollen Trade and Funds for the Fishing; That these
were the specious Pretences, when the Nation was brought
in to accept of the Equivalent, but that now it was done and
over, now they were dividing the Spoil—; It would be
endless to set down the ill Nature of the Day, as soon as
this Proposal was talked of without Doors, and yet there
was really no Reason, the Gentlemen who went to <HI>England</HI>
upon that Oceasion, who set all their private Affairs aside to
serve their Country, and attended in <HI>England</HI> several Months
at Expence enough, should do all this at their own Charges,
when, at the same time, every other Article had its Supply
out of the General Fund; And therefore, not withstanding
the Clamours of the People, and several Attempts within
Doors, first: to reject it wholly, then to refuse the payment
of it out of the Equivalent, which was indeed refusing it
wholly, since there was no other Fund to pay it—; And
lastly, to Restrict the Quantity, yet at last it past, as it had
been at first proposed.</P>
<P>“The Allowance to the Old Treaters, they alledged, was
a Trick to draw in the Allowance for the New, because, be∣ing
to be Voted together, it was certain, <HI>the Old</HI> would
Vote for the <HI>New,</HI> that they might be sure, <HI>the New</HI> would,
in Return, Vote <HI>for the Old</HI>—; But there was certainly
the same Reason, that one should be allowed their Expence
as the other, since, tho` they could not then bring it to a
Conclusion, yet their Pains and Expences might not be the lest,
but rather the more for that, and thus they were both Vot∣ed
to be allowed their Charges, <HI>as per</HI> the Minute.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LXIX.</HEAD>
<P>“The Charges being allowed to the Treaters, it was thought
the House would go on and allow this also, but it was pre∣sently
rejected—; Some said it was offered by way of
Jest, as a Reproach to the Gentlemen that took Money for
the Service of. their Country.</P>
<P>“But the Prosal was made another way, <HI>viz.</HI> That no
Representative, from either Shire or Burgh, from this Kingdom
to the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> shall have any Allowance for
their Charges or Expences, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> It was alledged. That the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
took no such Allowance; and that it would be a Reproach
<PB N="219" REF="519"/>
to <HI>Scotland,</HI> if the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentry should take their Charges from
the Country, and the <HI>English</HI> did not.</P>
<P>“To this it was Answered, That, tho, the <HI>English</HI> Gentle∣men
generally refused the Allowance of the Countries for
their Attendance, yet that, by Law, there was such an Al∣lowance
due to them from the Countries, and they might
not only justtfy accepting it, but might legally demand it;
And therefore it ought, in like manner, be lest at Liberty in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> when doubtless the <HI>Scots</HI> Represenatives, in Pro∣portion
to their Capacities, would be found as Frank and Ge∣nerous
in sparing the Country as the <HI>English,</HI></P>
<P>“And it was remarkable, That in subsequent Elections in
<HI>Scotland</HI> for the Counties, it was very often agreed joyntly
by rhe several Candidates for Election, That whosoever
carried it, should relinquish any pretence to an Allowance
from the County, for their Service in Parliament.</P>
<P>“The Affair of Proxies in Election of Peers, is exprest at
large in the Minute, and needs no Remark; nor was there
any long Debate upon it in the House.</P>
<P>“The other Heads also being Matter of Form, only were
readily agreed to.</P>
<P>“There was indeed some Struggle about Excluding these
Noblemen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were Noblemen in <HI>England,</HI> or
should be Peers of <HI>Britain,</HI> from Voting, but they could not
carry it—; And yet 'tis to be observed, that at the first
Election of the Sixteen Peers by virtue of this Act, some of
the Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> protested against the Votes of those that
had <HI>English</HI> or <HI>British</HI> Titles, a Debate that is not yet (<HI>viz.</HI>

<P>“The Act for settling the manner of Electing the Represen∣tative

great Variety of Heads, useful for Posterity to know, when
the respective Elections may come on, I have inserted it in
the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, N I x x.</P>
<P>“The Overtures for Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of
Teinds, were put both together, and proceeded upon as
one Act, Thecase was in short thus—;It had been the
Custom in former Parlianiment, to Grant a Commissioner to
<PB N="221" REF="521"/>
certain of their own Members to sit as a Court, and to Judge
and Determine of several Things relating to the two Heads
above, <HI>viz. Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds;</HI> The
Things they Determined of. were Generally,</P>
<P>“Sale and Valuation at Teinds or Tithes in the several
Paroches.</P>
<P>Augmentation of the Stipends of Ministers.</P>
<P>Prorogation of Tacks. <HI>or Leases</HI> of Teinds.</P>
<P>Dividing or Disjoyning Paroches, or <HI>Parishes,</HI> where
they where too, large.</P>
<P>“Erecting and Endowing New Churches.</P>
<P>“Annexing and Dismembering Churches, and the like.</P>
<P>“It was some Time since these Commissions had been Dis∣continued,
and that was not all the Misfortune, but all the
Registers and Rolls of that Court were lost in the great Fire
which happened in the Parliament Closs at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in the
year 1700. S. thac there was no having Recourse to any
thing past.</P>
<P>“This was a great Loss to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon
several Accounts, and had it remained Unsettled at this
Juncture, the Injury had been past Remedy; Wherefore it was
eamestly Desir'd, and readily Granted, That all the Powers
formerly Exercised by the said Coramission of Parliament,
should now be Conveyed to some particular Court Judica∣tory
or Body of Men, that snould Judge and Determine in
such Cases, some were for having it Vested in the Church it
self, and committed to the General Assembly—; But it
was alledged, That were to make the Church Judge in Her
own Cause, and put too much Power into the Hinds of the
Assembly; Others were for Desiring it to be in the Hands of
the Crown, to Grant Commission to proper Persons, as the

<P>“The Church Act about Kirks and Teinds was now settled,
the Motion of having these things still referred to a Parlia∣mentary
Commission was thought to proceed from these,
who were willing it should remain in the same Condition it
had lyen in for a long time, <HI>viz. Unsettled</HI> and Unprovided for,
since to must yearly put the Persons concerned to make Appli∣cation
to the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> which Remote, and
very Troublesome to get such Comission fettled, or Tricnnial∣ly
at least—; And whereas, while it lay before their own
Parliament, it had, for some Years, been Unsettled a and the
Church lest, as it were. Unregarded in thosec Affairs, it
might much more be supposed to be neglected, if referred to
the <HI>British</HI> Parliament—; That, at the end of every Par∣liament,
which, at furthest, would be but Three Years, this
<PB N="227" REF="527"/>
Matter behoved to be laid before them again, and diligent∣ly
solicited, in order to have it effectually settled—; This
therefore was vigorously opposed, and it was carryed to be
referred to the Lords of the Session, as <HI>per</HI> the Act. <HI>Vide</HI> the

<P>“The <HI>Proemiums</HI> and Drawbacks on the Exportation of
Corn had been settled, as before is observed, and are insert∣ed
in the Union, as <HI>per</HI> the Act appears; But, in regard the
Union was not to take place till <HI>May,</HI> and the want of those
Allowances might put a Stop to the Exportation in the mean
time, and particularly, That there was a great <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet and
several <HI>Norway</HI> Ships in the Port of <HI>Leith</HI> at that time which
would, in case of the Encouragements now to be given, car∣ry
away a great Quantity of Corn, before the First of <HI>May,</HI>
which Exportation of Corn would be a great Advantage to
the Country, therefore this short lived Act was proposed far
the Encouragement of Trade: But it was alledged, That
the Term of the Commencement of the Union was so near,
that no Convoy would stir, or ships sail, before that
time would be come, and the Advantages would be the same
to the Merchant; Upon which, the Bill was dropp'd in the
House, and came to nothing.</P>
<P>“The Debate about the Chirurgeons and Apothecaries,
never came to any Head, the Design was to Authorize the
Apothecaries and Chirurgeones, to Administer Physick with∣out
the Assistance or Prescription of the Physicians, in Ex∣traordinary
cases—; It would have been perhaps a
a contested Thing, if the House had been of longer Con∣tinuance,
but the End of the Parliament being so near, there
was no Time for it.</P>
<P>“The Act about Kirk-lands, and Discharging the Feu-duties
was, a necessary Law at that Time, in some special Causes, and
met with no Opposition.</P>
<P>`The House fat on <HI>Thursday</HI> the Twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> but

Opinion, That the foresaid Dead Stock, extending in hail, with
and under the said Burden, to the said Sum of One Thousand Six
Hundred and Fifty Four Pounds Eleven Shillings and Two Thirds
of a Penny <HI>Sterling,</HI> ought to be allowed to the said Company, and

to enable the Council General and Directors of the said Company to
pay such necessary Allowances &amp; Satisfaction to the several Gentlemen
who suffered in their Persons and Goods for the Companies Services,
as their Services, Losses and Sufferings do justly merit.</P>
<P>And the Committee having considered the Act of Parliament esta∣blishing
the Company, Privileges therein-contained, and that
pin of the Representation relating thereto, They are of Opinion,
That, when the Company is Dissolved, and the capital Stock and
Interest paid in by the Commissioners, and others intrusted with the
Equivalent, to the Hands of the Commissioners appointed by the
Council General and Directors to receive the same, every Proprietors
Share may be recovered out of the Hands or the said Commissioners,

<P>“The Committee had now settled the Sum, which in the
Gross was to be paid to the Proprietors of the <HI>African</HI> Com∣pany;
the Question that remained, was, by what Method it
should be Distributed, and to whom it should be paid—;
Two Motions were made about it.</P>
<P>“1. That it should be paid out by the Commissioners
who were to be appointed for the general Distribution
of the Equivalent, and by them immediately paid to the
Persons, who had a Right to the payment by Act of Par∣liament.”</P>
<P>startq;2. Some thought this was Dishonourable to the Di∣rectors
of the Company, and they moved, that they
should appoint Persons to Receive and Distribute the
Money, but this last met with very little Approbation.”</P>
<P>“I care not to take notice of some Disputes that happened
upon this Occasion, because they seemed to make Personal
Reflections—; and only signified, that some People were more
Jealous of one another, than I hope there was occasion for on
either Side—; But it was evident, the People who were
to receive the Money, were Generally most Concerned to
have it paid them by the Commissioners of the Equivalent
immediately, as being the surest Method, and so it was at
last agreed.”</P>
<P>“The Money being thus Directed, and who should have the
payment, it is not Material to take notice of the several Claims
put in, Debts demanded of the Company, and Services to be
rewarded, they were all matter of private Interest, and I
omit them of course.”</P>
<P>“The Affair of the Coyn, and the Report of the Committee,
I have Noted already, and as it issued in a Proclamation, and
that Proclamation recited the Report of the Committee, I

<P>2. Amendments or Alterations, which might occasi∣on
the respective Articles so Amended, to be Remitted
or Returned to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> to be Recon∣sidered,
by which means not the particular Articles only,
but perhaps the whole Treaty might necessarily go

can be made; yet nevertheless, for the Reasons aforesaid, there ought
to be a proportionable Equivalent answered to <HI>Scotland,</HI> It is agreed,

arising in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the end it may appear, what ought to be answered

<PB N="1" REF="575"/>
<HEAD>APPENDIX,
Part I</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing an Account of Transactions in
both Parts of the United Kingdoms, sub∣sequent
to the UNION; being an Abridg∣ment
of the several Alterations made in
the Laws, Trade, Customs, and Consti∣tution
of both Kingdoms by the UNION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe Union was no sonner Concluded,</HI> and the Ratifications
Exchanged, as has been said, but an unlucky Business hap∣pened,
that opened afresh the Mouths of those that had all
along watched Occasions for that purpose, and furnished
them with matter of new Clamour. The particulars are as follows;
The Time when the Union was to take place, was the first of
May, after which, by the Fourth Article of the Treaty, the Sub∣jects
of either Kingdom were to have a free Intercourse of Trade,
to enjoy equal Privileges, and were to be upon an equal Foot as to
Taxes, Customs, Duties, Prohibitions, &amp;c. as by Words of the
Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> Article <HI>4th.</HI></P>
<P>That alt the Subjects of the United Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall
from and after the Union, have full Freedom and Intercourse of Trade
and Navigation, to and from any Port or Place within the said
United Kingdom, and the Dominions and plantations thereunto be∣longing;
And that there be a Communication of all other Rightly Pri∣vileges
and Advantages, which do, or may belong to the Subjects of ei∣ther
Kingdom, except where it is other ways expresly agreed in these Ar∣ticles.</P>
<P>But in the Interval of Time, between the finishing of the Treaty
and the first of May, all Things by Consequence remained as they
were, and all Merchandizes being Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the
Foot of the former Customs, which were much Lower than in <HI>England</HI>
the Merchants in both Kingdoms laying hold of that Advantage,
for their private Gain, Fraughted abundance of Ships in <HI>France</HI> and
<PB N="2" REF="576"/>
<HI>Holland</HI> with all sorts of Goods, which payed high Duties in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
Landing them in <HI>Scotland</HI> and paying only the Scots Dues,
presuming that alter the first of <HI>May,</HI> they mould be sent Free to
<HI>England</HI> according to the general Article of Freedom of Com∣merce.</P>
<P>To let the Reader more Exactly into this Case, I shall state the
difference of the Duties of lame of the several Commodities, which
being thus Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> were after to be carried into
<HI>England</HI> such as, Wines, Brandies, Salt, Lintseed, Iron, Timber,
Deals, &amp;c being the chief kinds of Goods Imported in <HI>Scotland</HI>
and which the Duties were most Complained of.</P>
<P>Besides this, it is to be observed, That the Customs of <HI>Scotland</HI> being
Let in Tack, as they call it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or in Farm, as in <HI>England</HI> the
Tacksmen or Farmers, to Encourage the Merchants to make large
Importations, made several Compositions and Abatements to them
less or more, according as the Quantity of the Goods Imported,
Encouraged, by this means the Customs were still reduced, and yet
the Farmers of the Customs made great Gain of that Interval of
Trade.</P>
<P>Another Article of the Contrivance of the Merchants on this
Head, was in <HI>England</HI> upon the Drawbacks on Foreign Goods
Imported there, and Exported again by Certificate.</P>
<P>And this indeed was lets Honest by far than the other, tho'
both of them Politick enough; and, which was thought, had slipt
the Notice of the Treaters on both sides, during the Negotiating
the Treaty.</P>
<P>The Exporters in this Case, sent Goods from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
by certificate, drawing back the Duties paid on their Import
in <HI>England</HI> as being sent to a Foreign Country: After the Union
the Kingdoms becoming One it was by the Treaty left open for
them, to carry the same Goods back into <HI>England</HI> and Sell them
there, as if they hid paid the Duty.</P>
<P>The principal Article this Circumstance relates to, was Tobacco,
which paying a large Duty of near Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound in <HI>England</HI>
above Six Thousand Hogsheads as I have been told, (<HI>Some have said
much more, even to double the Quantity, but I choose to relate the
lowest Number,</HI>) was sent into <HI>Scotland</HI> and; <HI>per</HI> Pound of the
said Custom drawn back by the Merchant.</P>
<P>I need not acquaint the Reader, That the Exporter was both
bound in a Bond with Securities, and also Sworn against the Re∣landing
or returning it into <HI>England</HI> again; But as the Union gave
a free Intercourse of Trade, <HI>i. e.</HI> Exporting and Importing to and
from the respective Kingdom, without paying any Duties, or any
Molestation whatsoever, so their Bond;, seem'd to be of no Value in
that Case; But whether the Oath was of no Value to them, is ano∣ther
Affair, and not for me to Determine here.</P>
<P>It is evident, the Tobacco was sent to <HI>Scotland</HI> in Quantities,
so much above the usual Consumption of that Country, that it
<PB N="3" REF="577"/>
could rationally be esteemed to be with no other Prospect, than of
Returning it into <HI>England</HI> again after the Union, and so to obtain
the Advantage of the Drawback.</P>
<P>In like manner it is evident, the great Import into <HI>Scotland</HI> of
Wines and Brandy from <HI>France,</HI> either directly, or by way of <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
was so much beyond the ordinary Consumption of the Place,
that it could be with no other End, than the carrying it into <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
after the Union should take place, nor did the Merchants stick
to owne that to be in the Design.</P>
<P>The Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> especially such as were concerned in
the Trade to <HI>Spain, Italy</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and consequently had the
greatest Injury, made loud Complaints of this, as an Intolerable In∣equality,
and a Thing so Unjust that they made no doubt to con∣cern
the Government in it, and the Parliament being then sitting,
they Addressed the House of Commons for Relief.</P>
<P>Their Address was followed with Numerous Solicitations, they
even wearied the Members, the Secretaries of State, and every
Body, that they thought would Espouse their Cause; that as some
have Expressed it, They almost drove the House by the Force of
their Clamours, upon a Debate of a Thing, which most People
thought they had really no Power, <HI>at least no Reason,</HI> to meddle
with.</P>
<P>The Parliament then sitting was the same, which had in Concert
with the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> made this Union; And it could
not seem Reasonable, That the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> in its separate
Capacity, could be Qualified to Explain any part of the Articles,
which were then Ratified and Recorded in both Kingdoms, and
neither Parliament could Determine in Things belonging to the
other, any more than they could have done before the Treaty.</P>
<P><HI>However this war,</HI> the House of Commons went upon it, great
Application being made by the English Merchants, and after some
Debate, came to this Resolution.</P>
<Q>Resolved,</Q>
<P>That the Importation of Goods and Merchandises of the Growth
and Produce of <HI>France,</HI> and other Forreign Parts into <HI>Scotland,</HI>
in order to be brought front thence into <HI>England</HI> after the first of
<HI>May,</HI> and with Intention to avoid the payment of the <HI>English</HI>
Duties, will be to the Damnage &amp; Ruine of the Fair traders, to the
Prejudice of the Manufactures of <HI>England</HI> a great Loss to Her
Majesties Revenue of the Customs and a very great Detriment to
the Publick.</P>
<P>And in pursuancc of this Resolution, a Bill was ordered to be
brought in, the Enacting part of which I have Annexed to this
Work, in the <HI>Appendix N C (3).</HI> The Title of it was as follows</P>
<P>A Bill to prevent the Mischiess of a Fraudulent Practice, in
obtaining Drawbacks for Goods carried from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Scotland.</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="578"/>
in order to be brought back again; and in carrying Goods from For∣eign
Parts into <HI>Scotland</HI> in order to be brought into <HI>England</HI>
without paying the <HI>English</HI> Duties, and for better securing the Du∣ties
of Goods brought from the <HI>East Indies,</HI> was (according to order)
read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the whole
House.</P>
<P>This Bill past all the usual Forms in the House of Comamons, and
went up to the Lords, but after long Debate in the Upper-House,
the Lords rejected it.</P>
<P>It's true, that upon the Petitions and Representations of the <HI>Scots</HI>
Merchants, there were long Debates, and great Difficulties in the pas∣sing
this Bill in the House of Commons, and the <HI>Scots</HI> demanding
<HI>by the Letter of the Treaty</HI> a free Intercourse of Trade, alledged they
could not be refused the importing of any Goods out of <HI>Scotland</HI> into
<HI>England,</HI> which were not by Law Counterband in <HI>Scotland</HI> before the
said Treaty, since having been fairly admitted to an Entry in the Cu∣stom-house
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and all the Duties which were demanded be∣ing
paid, the free Intercourse of Trade between the Nations immedi∣ately
opened all the Potts of <HI>England</HI> to their Goods.</P>
<P>This Argument was too Powerful and too Plain not to have its
Weight in the House: <HI>But to solve this,</HI> there was an Exception put
in to the Bill for the Property of <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants, as a thing which
would effectually remove their Scruples, and answer the End both of
the Union one way, and of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchants another; For
the Complaint seemed to ly nor so much against the Freedom of <HI>Scots</HI>
Merchants importing; their own Goods, but of Forreigners, <HI>Dutch, French,
Jews</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> who under the cover of <HI>Scots</HI> Men had crouded in
vast Quantities of Wine and Brandy, meerly to evade paying the
<HI>Englsh</HI> Dutie, taking the Advantage of the Interval of Time, and
thereby bringing their Goods to Market upon Terms vastly diffe∣ring
from the Course of Trade.</P>
<P>To prevent this, the Act was to provide, that all the <HI>Properties</HI> of
the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants should be exempted, and be allowed to come to
<HI>England</HI> but this was restricted in point of Proof. (1.) The <HI>onus
Probandi</HI> lay upon the Merchant, in which many Niceties occurred
needless to be mentioned here. (2.) None were to be reputed
<HI>Scots</HI> Merchants but such as resided in <HI>Scotland</HI> this excluded the
<HI>Scots</HI> Merchants at <HI>London</HI> and in <HI>Holland,</HI> who were deeply Embarkt
in these Importations, ind on whose Management the chief part of
the Design was charged. (3.) The Proof of the Importations and
Properties lay before the Commissioners of the Customs, and it was
doubtful how it should be determin'd.</P>
<P>Under all these Difficulties, with other Restrictions needless here,
this first Act struggl'd and past the Commons, and yet it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hought
also, that had the <HI>Scots</HI> been fairly excepted they would have been
well enough pleased with such a Difference, and they would have
had some reason to have been so; Nor was the Exception of For∣reigners
altogether unreasonable, the thing being really a Fraud in
<PB N="5" REF="579"/>
Trade, and a Hardship upon the fair Traders: But the main Ob∣jection
turn'd upon another Point, <HI>viz.</HI> The Power the Parliament
of <HI>England</HI> alone could have to Determine, Construe, or stain any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of the Articles of the Union, which being made by the Concurrence of
the two respective Kingdoms, could not be subject to the Cognisance of
either Parliament in its separate Capacitie, and upon this Head the
Lords rejected the Bill. And this being the main thing in my Obser∣vation,
on which the whole Case depended, I have purposly omitted
the Reasonings on that Article on either side, which were very many,
referring my Reader to the Substance of the Address of tnt <HI>Scots</HI>
Merchants to the House of Lords, and to an Observation made by an
eminent Vember of the Parliament, which I have added in the Ap∣pendix,
in otder to leave this Case as clear to <HI>Psosterity as is possible,</HI>
marked N<SUP>o</SUP> (D3.) and N<SUP>o</SUP> (E 3.)</P>
<P>However it was absolutely necessary if possible to bring this Affair to
some Conclusion and in order to this the Parliament at that time draw∣ing
near an ends for they could sit no longer than the sast of
<HI>April,</HI> the Union commencing the 1st. or <HI>May,</HI> wherefore it was
thought expedient to give the House a short Recess, that this matter
might come again upon the Stage, whereupon the Queen prorcgued
the Parliament for three days only, and in a short Speech made
them acquainted with the Reason of it, <HI>viz.</HI> In order to find our an
Expedient ro prevent any Mischiess arising to either Kingdom in the
short Interval of time between that and the Commencement of the
Union.</P>
<P>When the House met again, the Commons began again and voted
to the same purpose as before, and ordered a Bill to be brought in
in the same terms as before.</P>
<P>The Vote of the House of Commons ran thus;</P>
<P>That the Importation of sundry Goods of the Growth of France thro'
<HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England</HI> with design to avoid paying the Duties payable
for the those in <HI>England</HI> is a notorious <HI>Fraud,</HI> ruinous to the fair ira∣ders
and injurious to Her Majesties Revenue.</P>
<P>Upon this Vote the Merchants <HI>London</HI> renewed their Clamours,
and all Methods possible were male use of to bring the Parliament in∣to
it, The Government would willingly have found out some Expe∣dient
to have softned the general Complaint, and to have prevented
the injury ro the Revenue but all <HI>Mediums</HI> were found imperfect,
and the House of Lords persisting in the first Scruple, it fell to the Ground.</P>
<P>While this was transfacting, the Merchants went on with their
Importation, and tho' the Quantity did not amount to what had been
alledged <HI>would be brought in,</HI> yet it was a very great Quantity indeed,
and the Damage to the Revenue in <HI>England,</HI> appears by the follow∣ing
Calculation.</P>
<P>There were not some wanting in cither Kingdom, who expected
to make early Objections against this proceeding, as a Breach of the
<PB N="6" REF="580"/>
Union on the <HI>English</HI> side, and had the Act part, tho' with the ut∣most
Precautions, discovered that they would have improved that
Suggestion to the utmost, and yet it was observable that none were so
forward to approve of the Act of Restriction as some Gentlemen who
declared their Aversion to the Union, and their willingness to have
it dissolved again.</P>
<P>Whatever Loss therefore the Government received by this Affair,
they avoided the Stroke it would have given to the Union and the
Enemies of the Treaty lost the Opportunity of saying it was broken.</P>
<P>The first of May being arriv'd, the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants began to apply
themselves to the Government for the Settlement of this Matter and
the Importation of their Goods to <HI>England;</HI> This held a long De
bate, and took up a great deal of time, however the <HI>Scots</HI> shipped
their Goods, took Certificats in <HI>Scotland</HI> of their being fairly im∣ported
there before the first of <HI>May,</HI> and tho' after many Hesirations
and Delays, about the middle of June the Fleet sailed for <HI>London,</HI>
consisting of about 40 Sail mostly loaded with Wine and Brandy.</P>
<P>As soon as they arrived in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> the Custom-house
Officers made a general Seizure both of Ship and Goods; and all
was put to a full stop.</P>
<P>This perplex'd the Merchants very much, and loud Clamours were
made of it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as a Breach of ihe Union; The Royal Bar∣roughs
in <HI>Scotland</HI> held their Convention upon this Affair, and the
Merchants concerned in the said Ships presented a Petition to them,
which because it relates the Complaint in express terms, and for the
Information of those People in <HI>England;</HI> who do not particularly un∣derstand
the Methods there, I insert at large in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P>It may be observed that the Royal Burghs in <HI>Scotland</HI> have their
Meetings on emergent Occasions, for the Regulation of Trade, and
settling their own Altaic, besides their Annual Meeting.</P>
<P>The Merchants of <HI>Scotland</HI> generally speaking are all Free-men of
some one or other of these Burghs, and there hapning to be a Con∣vention
or Meeting as above at that time, the Merchants presented to
them their Petition, intreating them to represent their Case to the
Queen, settinp furth their Grievances, this Petition you will find in
the Appendix No <HI>A.</HI> (3.)</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Petition the Convention of Burroughs represented
their case very earnestly to the Government, by the means of the
<HI>Scots</HI> Secretarys of Stare then at <HI>London</HI>—their Address I have
also placed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work No B (3)</P>
<P>And thus the Case was wholly referred to the Queen and Council.</P>
<P>It was thought hard indeed that the Ships should not be suffered to
unlade, the Season being Hot, and the Wines exposed to spoil;
But there was no immediate Remedy, the Custom-House Officers could
not possibly do otherwise, <HI>for this Reason:</HI> Had the Debate been,
what Duty they should pay, they might have suffered them to un∣lade
into the Queens Ware-house, and have detained them there till
such <HI>Duty</HI> had been paid; But the Trade of <HI>France</HI> being universal∣ly
<PB N="7" REF="581"/>
Prohibit by Act of Parliament, they could not be admitted to
an Entry, but were all Forfeited, both Ships and Goods.</P>
<P>The Government willing, if possible, to give the necessary
Relief in this Exigence, the Attorney General, and all other Judges,
whose Advice was necessary, were required to give their Opinion,
but they differ'd in their Judgments so much, that no Resolution
could be made in it.</P>
<P>However, that the Merchants might be made Easie, it was pro∣posed
to them, That they mould Land their Goods, upon Condi∣tion,
that they gave Security to stand to the Judgment of the <HI>Bri∣tish
Parliament;</HI> This was thought but reasonable, and some com∣plyed
with it, and had their Ships Unloaden: Others refused such
Securities, and their Goods lay longer, and suffered more.</P>
<P>At length a Medium was found cut, which was, to let all the
Merchants have the possession of their Goods, serving the Possessors
of the Goods with a Writ of <HI>Devenirunt</HI> out of the Exche∣quer
—-; This is a kind of Write which puts the Matter in a
Form of Prosecution only, that in case of further occasion, the
Queen might recover her Dues, and so the Merchants had their
Goods, and the Decision of it was left to Time, and to the British
Parliament.</P>
<P>Thus it continued in a Course of Law, tho' not under prosecu∣cution,
till the Meeting of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, when by a Vote
of the House of Commons, the whole Affair was Discharged, and
all prosecutions ordered to be stopt, of which hereafter. Mean
time the Clause in Parliament so much struggled about, you will
find in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, <HI>No</HI> C (3)</P>
<P>Thus ended this difficult Matter, in which is to be Noted the
Exactness of the House of Lords, and Tenderness in respect to the
Union, which delivered us from the Apprehensions of an Invasion
upon the Articles; and notwithstanding the Damage done to the
Revenue, which was finally sacrificed to the Ease of the Peoples
Minds, the whole Claim was let fall.</P>
<P>It may be thought it had this Use, however, that the Difficulty
which appeared in it, Checkt the Quantity of the Goods that would
otherways have been brought in, which would have been Intole∣rable,
and some thought this was part of the Design in it.</P>
<P>while this was Transacting, the Government began to take the
State of the Nation into their Consideration, in order to settle
Things conform to the respective Constitutions, and yet to put the
Union as far in Practice as the General Circumstances would admit;
And this took up the most part of the Time between the first of
<HI>May, when the Union look place,</HI> and the Sitting down of the first
<HI>British</HI> Parliament, nor was the Thing without its Difficulties, as
will appear in the several Articles following.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="8" REF="582"/>
<ITEM>1. The Customs.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Excise.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Equivalent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Petty Justice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The forces and the Coyn.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Previous to these Particulars, it is requisite to observe, That
the Administration of publick Affairs was lest to remain as before,
in the Ministry of a Privy Council, a Treasury, a Chancellor, and
Two Secretaries of State, with all other Dependents and Substitutes
as before.</P>
<P>This the Queen thought sit to Order, not only, because the
Weight of business was too great, and the particulars too Nice,
and of too much Consquence to suffer a sudden Change, which
would have made large Intervals in the Course of Administration,
put a stop to the publick Business, and Influence private Persons
Affairs also. But as the Queen has always thought it best, in such
Cases, to take Advice of Her Great Council the parliament, a Hap∣piness
we have often Complained for want of in former Reigns; So
it was referred to the Sitting of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, that it might
be settled, to the Satisfaction of the Nation, by the Advice of their
full Representative.</P>
<P>Thus the Civil List remained as it was, the Army was sub∣sisted
upon the old Establishment, and paid from the Cess granted
by the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as far as it Extended, the Defici∣ency
was left to the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> to supply, as appears by
the Act of Parliament granting the Cess.</P>
<P>On the first of <HI>May One Ihousand Seven Hundred and Eight,</HI> the
Army received their pay from <HI>London,</HI> the Regiment of Foot
Guards was received as <HI>English</HI> Guards, and the Command of them
given to the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rquiss of <HI>Lothian</HI> as Cclonel; The Guards were
Clothed after the <HI>English</HI> manner, I mean, as the <HI>English</HI> Guards,
and the whole Establishment of the Forces received their Regulati∣ons
and Pay from the <HI>British</HI> Government.</P>
<P>But two Things required an immediate Application, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Costcom and Excise, for these being ro be Established upon a new
Foot <HI>viz.</HI> According to the Articles, and to Commence precisely
on the first of <HI>May,</HI> it was absolutely necessary that they should be
first settled.</P>
<P>The same Reasons made it absolutely necessary to bring down
some <HI>Englishmen,</HI> to supp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Interiour Offices, both in the Customs
and Excise, at Least, till proper Perssons might be found, or In∣structed
to Act without them.</P>
<P>It was thought at first, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atas <HI>Scotland</HI> being United to <HI>England,</HI>
the whole United Kingdom coming under one Denomination, and
under one Method of Government, so the Revenues should become
<PB N="9" REF="583"/>
united in one general Collection, that the Custom should be manag∣ed
by the Commissioners at <HI>London,</HI> and under them only by Collec∣tors
and other Officers in the respective Ports in <HI>Scotland</HI> as it is in E<HI>ngland,</HI>
all subservient to and under the Government of the Commis∣sioners
at <HI>London,</HI> and the like in the Excise.</P>
<P>But the Busness appeared too weighty and embarrast with too
many Difficulties to admit of such a Conjunction, and indeed were I
to enter into an Historical Account of the Labyrinths which the first
Settlement of thse Duties led the Managers of them into, what Dif∣faculties
they met with, what Clamours were raised at their Conduct,
however impartially they endeavoured to act, it would look as if I
were going to Write of persons instead of relating things, and
that is none of my busness here.</P>
<P>It will be enough here to touch the matters of Fact, by which it
will appear, both that the Government proceeded in the best Me∣thod,
in puting the Customs and Excise into a distinct Management in
<HI>Scotland;</HI> And also, that the Commissioners of both shewed they
wanted neither Judgment or Application in a Settlement so speedy
under inch perplext Circumstances as they found these Revenues in at
first.</P>
<P>The Commissioners named for the Management of the Customs
were as is noted, Three <HI>Englishmen,</HI> Two <HI>Scots-men.</HI></P>

</LIST>
<P>The whole Extent of the Kingdom lay before them and they
had not only view Officers to place in the respective Ports but
the had all their old Officers to instruct in the new Methods Customs
and Manner of securing and accounting the respective Duties.</P>
<P>This obliged the Government even before Commissioners
were named, and before the time for the new Collection began, to di∣rect
five persons from <HI>England,</HI> experienced in the Methods and <HI>U∣sge
of the Customs,</HI> to go down into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to put them into some
manner of Order as to Exports and Imports, especially of Goods to be
passed between the two Kingdoms when the Union was to take place,
and of Imports which might happen before the Commission came
down; As also to Regulate the Collection of the subsequent Duties,
secure the Payment and instruct the Officers; And this was about
the latter end of <HI>April.</HI>—If the Disorders these Gentle∣men
found the Custom-house in, the Confusion of Method and Remis∣nes
of practice was material to note in a History, it would take up
a large Discourse here, and make the necessity of a new modelling
the custom house more distinctly appear.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>These Gentlemen, tho'it was impossible to build any thing upon
the Method they found things in, yet by their Diligence and Appli∣cation
<PB N="10" REF="584"/>
brought them to a little of a Form, and prepared them the bet∣ter
for the Regulations which were to follow.</P>

<HEAD>These were the following Persons,</HEAD>

</LIST>
<P>The first Clamour I meet with against these proceedings, was, the
filling all the Commissions up with <HI>English</HI> Men and Strangers, and I
mention it, not that it was a real Ground of Complaint, their Num∣ber
being not one fifth Part of the whole, as appears by their Esta∣blishment;
But to remark how readily every thing was laid hold upon
to reproach the Union, as being either originally designed for, or
consequentially improved to the particular Advantage of the <HI>English</HI>
separately considered.</P>
<P>Now altho' the small Number of <HI>English</HI> imployed in the Customs,
were a sufficient Answer to the Objections, and a full Justification of
the <HI>English</HI> Government in that Case; yet it is a more clear Defence
when it is considered that it was impossible to introduce the new
Method of collection, the Rules of their keeping their several Offices,
and their Accompts, which were all now to be done after the <HI>English</HI>
Manner, without the Assistance of Officers from <HI>England,</HI> who had
been bred up to the same Business, and were absolutely Masters of
the Methods practised in <HI>England:</HI> of which by it self.</P>
<P>But to return to the Qpestion, I mean the necessity of a separate
Collection of the Customs and Excise in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it will further appear
in reflecting on the Proceedings of the Officers in the prosecution of
their new Methods.</P>
<P>For First, the People finding the Duties on <HI>French</HI> Goods so ex∣travagantly
high, that the stealing the Customs was more worth their
while than usual, fell upon that Practice with so much eagerness, that
it was not in the power of the Custom-house Officers at first to sup∣press
it; At several places they practised it so openly, and with such
assurance, that when the Officers had made their Seizures they were dri∣ven
from them by the Rabbles, and the Goods attempted to be taken
from them by force &amp; a Fleet arriving from <HI>Holland</HI> about the Months
of <HI>August</HI> or <HI>September</HI> after the Union, it was thought that several
thousand small Casks of Brandy were conveyed secretly on Shore,
which it was impossible to prevent: But of this I sball be more
particular by and by.</P>
<P>It was time therefore to take new Methods, and the Commissio∣ners
<PB N="11" REF="585"/>
Applying themselves to the Government in this Matter, Soul∣diers
were appointed to Defend the Callectors as occasion should offer,
and the Persons who had Resisted, as above, were Seized, and ordered
to be prosecuted; I might give a long History here, of the Frauds
and Violences put upon the Government, in the matters of the
Customs, by which whole Ships Loadings of Goods were at∣tempted
to be put on Shore, without paying the Custom; But
this is enough to make it plain, what Occasion there was of a strict
and exact Management in this Affair, and consequently of a se∣parate
Commission.</P>
<P>The Business of the Customs also in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had been under a
Management quite different from that in <HI>England:</HI> the Commissio∣ners
found the Trade small, the Officers few, and Discouraged,
their Salaries small, and the Extent of the Ports vastly large; So
that of that small Business there was in the Nation, much of it was
carried on by the Clandestine Management of the Merchant, and
tho' the Farmers or Tacksmen did their utmost, with the Officers
they had, yet it was impossible to prevent the Running great
Quantities of Goods.</P>
<P>If this was a General Practice before much more was it so now, when
the Sweetness of it was Tasted by the Merchants after the Union,
when the Duty of Wine and Brandy, was about Five times to Eight
times as much as it was before. This added to the Inconveni∣encies
the Custom-House at first laboured under, made it impossible
to put a stop to the Irregular Practice of the Merchants, the Firths
of <HI>Forth</HI> and <HI>Clyde,</HI> are known to be very large, and the whole
Kingdom full of Creiks, Coves, Harbours and Bays, that unless a
little Army of Officers had been maintained, it was not possible
they could easily check the running Goods on Shore, where there
was so great a Temptation and Opportunity.</P>
<P>But in order to Rectifie this as much as possible, Riding Officers
were appointed to Survey the Coast, these were Useful to observe
the Officers, that they did their Duty, and withal, to Inform the
Commissioners of what happened, to Regulate the Ports, and Di∣rect
the fixing Officers in proper places.</P>
<P>These consisted of Four general Riding Surveyors, who dividing
the whole Kingdom in proper Distructs, had Twelve Riding Officers
under them Three to each Surveyor, these were subject to the Or∣ders
and Inspection of the first Four, and all subject to the General
Orders of the Commissioners themselves, as they found occasion;
Nor did the Commissioners themselves stick, as they found the Ser∣vice
required it, to take a personal Inspection into the Business of
the Customes at their first Planting, frequently making long Jour∣neys
themselves, to Visit the Coast, and Rectifie such Abuses as they
found requisite, which tho' not usual, they made no Difficulty to
do, at the first Settlement of this nice Branch of the Revenue.</P>
<P>Several Cruising Vessels also &amp; small Boats were built, <HI>For the Custom-House
Officers were intirely without them before,</HI> by which they were
<PB N="12" REF="586"/>
able to Visit and Search Ships as they appeared, at any Time, in
the Sea, off of the Ports, or in all the Creiks and Rivets as
there was occasion—; for want of which, it was frequent∣ly
practised, for Ships to appear at a distance, make Signals for
their Consederates, who came off in Boats, and so delivered the
Goods they designed to Run, before they came into Port; These
Boats particularly in the Firth of <HI>Forth,</HI> having the whole Firth
to Range in, had their appointed Signals also on the Shores, where∣by
they never failed to have Notice, if the Officers appeared, and
could shifr from Port to Port, or from one side of the Firth to the
other, till they had a clear Port to Land in; and the Custom-House
Officers might have the Satisfaction to stand on the Shore, and
look on, but having no Vessel or Boat to go off in, could not pre∣vent
the Fraud.</P>
<P>But this was intirely prevented by the Vigilance of the Com∣missioners,
who placed their Cruising Vessels in proper Stations on
the Sea, and their several smaller Boats in the Rivers, Creiks and
Ports; and these concurred together with the Riding Officers and
Surveyors on Shore, who, in their constant Circuits, answered ex∣actly
by Land, what the said Vessels did on the Sea—; By the
Exactness of this Method, the Affair of the Customs presently came
into Form, and Things looked with a new Face in Trade, to the
Satisfaction of Fair Traders, and the better Collecting and securing
the Duties.</P>
<P>And for the better Explaining the particular Management of the
Customs in <HI>Scotland</HI> as to this Point, and giving a Proof of what
I have Noted as above, I have added a brief Scheme of the several
Stations of the said Cruisers by Sea, their appointed Business, and
Original Coasts, together with the Stations of the Riding Officers
on Shore, which will be found <HI>Appendix</HI> Part 11. N<SUP>o</SUP> (R x x,
S x x.) and to which the Reader is referred; a Scheme also of the
Difference of several Duties before and alter the Union, from which
the Encouragement for these Disorders were drawn; These you will
find <HI>Appendix</HI> Part 11. N<SUP>o</SUP> (T x x, V x x, X x x.)</P>
<P>I have been the longer on this, as well to give the true ReasonS,
why it was absolutely necessary to place <HI>English</HI> Officers in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
in order to Regulate the Collection, as why it was absolute∣ly
necessary to have a distinct Commission in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this
will always hold to be a Reason for such a Method; It being Im∣practicable,
that all the variety of Cafes which shall happen there,
should be Determined by the Board at <HI>London,</HI> or left to the Arbi∣trary
Decision of single Collectors; And this was one Reason among
others, why the Parliament found it necessary, to have a Court
of Exchequer Established in <HI>Scotland</HI> in which all the Seizures,
Consiscations, and Pleas between the Merchant and the Custom-House
Officers, should be Determined, since it would have been
an insupportable Grievance, both to the Queen as well as to the
Subject; to the first, to have had such Pleas be Determined in the
Ordinary Methods of the Law. And to the second, to have been
<PB N="13" REF="587"/>
obliged to Defend themselves in <HI>England</HI> whither Witnesses must
have been sent, and the Defendants have been bound to have ap∣peared
upon every trisling Occasion; Of which by it self.</P>
<P>As the Customs were thus necessarily put under a separate Col∣lection,
so was the Excise—-; that Branch of the Revenue was
not without its Difficulties, and as there would be every day Nice∣ties
and Difficulties arising, which no Government could Foresee;
So it would have been too great a Neglect of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to have put
the Determination of that whole Branch of the Revenue, into the
Hands of single Collectors.</P>
<P>Again, the Disputcs in the Excise in <HI>England,</HI> being referred
wholly ro the Justices of the Peace, and at the first settling this
Duty, there being no Justices of the Peace settled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it
would too much have Exposed the Subject, to have left them to
the Arbitrary Decision of Inferiour Collectors, and too much have
Exposed the Government to have left the Queen, without a due
Power to have secured the Revenue.</P>
<P>But there was yet other Reasons, which made the Establishing
separate Commissions in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Revenue, as above, to be
absolutely necessary, and this was the Eighteenth and Nineteenth
Articles of the Union, which appointed the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> to
remain in Force as they were—; One Consequence of this Ar∣ticle,
was, That all the Pleas of the Crown, as well as all Matters of
private Right, became Cognoscable only in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to be
Judged by what was before, or was now to be Deem'd, the Law of
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it appeared absolutely necessary, to have Two new Courts
Erected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That is to say, New in Method, tho' not in
Name, <HI>viz.</HI> a Court of Admiralty, and a Court of Exchequer; The
first to Determine Maritime Disputes, the other, such as related to
the Receipt of the Revenue, as Seizures, Forfeitures Penal∣ties,
Crown Lands, Leases, Grants, Patents, &amp;c. and whatever De∣mands
the Sovereign had upon the Subjects.</P>
<P>It was expresly stiputated in the Twenty Fourth Article of the U∣nion;
That a Seal in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union be always kept and
made use of in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which
have usually passed the Great Seal of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which only concern
Officers, Grants, Commissions, and private Rights within that King∣dom;
And that, until such Seal shall he appointed by her Majesty, the
present Great Seal of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be used for such Purposes; And that
the Privy Seal, Signet, Casset, Signet of the Justiciary Court, Quarter-Seal,
and Seals of Courts now used in <HI>Scotland</HI> be continued.</P>
<P>By this Clause, all Grants, Parents, Commissions, &amp;c. were ne∣cessarily
to be past in <HI>Scotland</HI>—; By this Clause also it became ne∣cessary,
that there should be a distinct Keeper of the Seal, and a
distinct Keeper of the Signet in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' there was but one
Lord Chancellor.</P>
<P>Again, by the Eighteenth Article, it was expresly stipulated;
That the Laws concerning Regulation of Trade, Customs, and such
<PB N="14" REF="588"/>
Excises, to which <HI>Scotland</HI> is, by virtue of this Treaty, to be liable,
be the same in <HI>Scotland</HI> from and after the Union as in; <HI>England;</HI>
And that all other Laws, in use within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> do
after the Union, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in the same Force
as before, (except such as are contrary to or inconsistent with the
Terms of this Treaty) but alterable by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
with this Difference betwixt the Laws concerning Publick
Right, Policy, and Civil Government, and those which concern private
Right; That the Laws which concern publick Right, Policy, and Civil
Government, may be made the fame throughout the whole united Kingdom;
But that no Alteration be made in Laws which concern private Rights,
except for evident Utility of the Subjects within <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This drove the Treaters to the absolute necessity of Forming all
those Particulars of the Nineteenth Article, which are but the Ex∣planation
of the Eighteenth; That the Court of Session, or Colledge of
Justice, do after the Union, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in
all time coming, within <HI>Scotland</HI> as it is now Constituted by the Laws of
that Kingdom, and with the same Authority and Privileges as before the
Union.</P>
<P>This settled the Laws of private Right; Then the Court of Ad∣miralty
comes, as a Consequence of the second Clause, as follows;

<P>The Exchequer as a further Consequence follows next, in these

the Court of Exchequer has in <HI>England;</HI> And that the said Court of
Exchequer hi <HI>Scotland</HI> have Power of passing Signatures, Gifts, Tu∣tories,
and in other Things, as the Court of Exchequer at present in
<HI>Scotland</HI> bath; And that the Court of Exchequer that now is in
<HI>Scotland</HI> do remain, until a new Court of Exchequer be settled by the
Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union.</P>
<P>B. these particular Establishments may be seen not only the manner
of the publick Vianag ment in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the Reason of it, and
from whence it became necessary to have the Court of Exchequer,
the Cammissions, and the separate Collection of the Publick Revenue
settled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> a I flowing from this main Original stated in the
Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> That all Caules between the Queen and the subject are
only cognifable in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>According to this Foundation, the Collections for the Customs
and Excises were settled in <HI>Scotland</HI> in distinct Commi∣ssions,
as has been said, and tho' at first the Difficulties in the said Collections ap∣peared
great, and some uneasiness on every side began to rise, yet as
they principally lay on the backwardness of the Subject to come under
a strict Survey as to the Duties, Time wore off these Things, and the
People became more sensible of the Necessity of the exact Collection,
in order to bring Trade to an Equality.</P>
<P>At the beginning, the People thought every Seizure of prohibited
Goods a Violence upon their Properties, and clamoured it the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
and the Union; as if the Union had been made not to bring
them under good Government, but to leave them without Govern∣ment.
Upon this Notion they fell to running of Brandy in particu∣lar
at that prodigious Rue, that some thousands of small Casks of
Brandy was in spight of all the Vigilance of Officers secretly supposed
to be pot on Shore our of the first Dutch Fleet that came to <HI>Scotland</HI>
after the Union; and when the Officers made Seizure of several
Parc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tls, th Rabbles by Violence rescued them again, as is already
noted above.</P>
<P>But this Practice was easily supprest, for not the Government only,
but all the fair Merchants were concerned in it, since the running of
Goods on Short, without paving Custom, is a known prejudice to the
Merchant, who entering his Goods fairly, and paying large Customs,
is by these People under sold, and the Market screstal'd; These
things therefore began to meet with less Encouragement, and having
no Countenance but from the meer Rabble, the frequent Losses they
met with, by the activity of the Officers of the Customs by little and
little, discoura<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the Adventurers, and Trade began to run in it's
proper Channel.</P>
<P>The Difficulties of the Excise were of another kind; Of which by
themselves; And tho' the Rules of the Colleting the Excise, &amp; the
Methods of charging the Subject wire very exact and regular, yet
they were not without great Obstructions in their Work, as has been
noted. The first by reason of a Misunderstanding of the Sense of the
Article in the Union, settling the Duty of Excise, which having ex∣prest
the several Measures, not very exactly, admitted a double Con∣struction
as to the Quantity what was to be esteemed the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="590"/>
Barrel: The Commissioners had charged it one way, and the Brewers
demanded it another, as follows.</P>
<P>The Act expresses it thus.</P>
<P>VII. That all the parts of the united Kingdom be for ever and
after the Union, Liable to the same Excises upon all exciseable liquors,
excepting only that the thirty four Gallons <HI>English</HI> to she Barrel of Beer
or Ale, amounting to Twelve Gallons <HI>Scots</HI> present measure, sold in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
by the Brewer at nine shilling six pence <HI>Sterling</HI> excluding all <HI>Du∣ties,</HI>
and retailed including Duties on the Retailers profit, at two
pence the <HI>Scots</HI> Pint, or eight part of the Scots Gallon, be not after the
Union lyable on account of the present Excise upon Exciseable Liquors
in <HI>England,</HI> to any higher Imposition than two shillings Sterling upon
the foresaid thirty four Gallons <HI>English</HI> Measure being twelve Gallons
the present Scots Measure, and that the Excise settled in <HI>England</HI> on
all other Liquors when the Union Commences, take place throughout
the whole united Kingdom.</P>
<P>When the Excise Office came to Charge the Brewer upon this
Cause, they could reason it no otherwise than as in <HI>England,</HI> by the
Gauge of Thirty Four Gallons <HI>English</HI> to the Barrel; And thus
the Brewer stood Charged for some Time.</P>
<P>But the Brewers objected, and sticking to the Letter of to Article
demanded, to pay but 2 <HI>sh.</HI> for 12 <HI>Scots</HI> Gallons, whether it over-run
the <HI>English</HI> 34 Gallons or no.</P>
<P>This occasioned some small Debate, but the Prudence of the Com∣missioners
prevented the Clamour some People would willingly have
raised upon it, and the justices of Peace directing 1/17. in each
Thirty Four Gallons to be allowed, the Brewer for the
presenr, left it Undetermined till the Parliament should settle
it; And thus the Brewers were made Easie; It is to be ob∣served,
to the Honour of the persons employed in the first Settle∣ment
of the Excise in <HI>Scotland;</HI> That considering the Ignorance of
the most part of their Officers in the Art of Gauging, and in the
new Methods of taking the Worts, and making a Charge, confsde∣ring
the Difficulty of satisfying and convincing the People who were
to pay the Duty, that they had no wrong done them, they them∣selves
being unable to examine the Gaugers Accounts, no Duty
was ever settled with so little Noise, or with so few Complaints, not
one person that ever I could hear of having any Appeal from the
Commissioners Sentences, or making any Complaint of Injustice done
them; But the Collection went on easie, was collected quietly,
paid cheerfully, and visibly improved the Revenue, tho' nothing
was paid by the Brewer more than they paid before.</P>
<P>Nor had it been possible to collect this Duty legally, if it hid not
been so, for the Commissioners of the Excise laboured under another
Difficulty which none of the other Branches of the Revenue were
troubled with, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Laws of Collection being by the Union
to be the same as in <HI>England,</HI> and the Justices of the Peace being by
the Act of Parliament <HI>12. Carol.</HI> II. in <HI>England</HI> made Judges
between the Queen and the Subject, in cases of Dispute; from
<PB N="17" REF="591"/>
the beginning of the Union till about <HI>August</HI> 1708, which was 15
Months, they were without the Assistance of Justices to determine
those <HI>Disputes.</HI></P>
<P>There was indeed a Nomination of Justices by the Privy Council
of <HI>Scotland 15 August</HI> 1707. as will appear in its place, and for
some few Months they did meet and Act; But this was a new Set∣tlement,
and the Gentlemen named were yet young in their Business,
little help could be had from them, and which was still worse be∣fore
they had time to inform themselves, their Power died by the Act
of Paliament in <HI>England,</HI> dissolving the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland.</HI>
This Act past in the beginning of the first <HI>British</HI> Parliament,
and by the Ceasing of that Power, from whence those
Justices derived, the Power of the Justices also Ceased;
and they were now to receive new Commissions from the
Lord Chancellor of <HI>Britain,</HI> as the Justices in <HI>England</HI> also did—;
This was not Finished till <HI>August</HI> 1708; so that in all that Time,
the Gommissioners of the Excise had no legal Authority before
whom they could Convict any Offender, or punish any Breach of
the Law, or by whom any Case could be Determined.</P>
<P>Yet their Business went on, and no Complaint was heard against
their Management, no Appeal made against them, no Difficulties
but what they work'd thro', to the general satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Excise as well as Customs in <HI>Scotland</HI> had been Farmed our,
or Let in Tack, <HI>as they call it,</HI> the Tacksmen or Farmers did their
best—-, for their own Interest; But several Circumstances rendred
their Method of Collecting the Excise, unfit to be Imitated, such
as their Officers, <HI>who were intirely ignorant of the Art of Gauging,</HI> a
king the lengths of the Words by Guess,&amp; proving Quantities chiefly
by the Oaths of the Brewers and the like, which joyned with some
other Practices, I care not to mention, exposed both the Collectors
and the Brewers to several Inconveniencies, and in General, made
the Charge on the Brewer many ways Unequal——; a Thing
prejudicial not to the Duty only, but to the Fair Dealer particular∣ly,
who always suffers by the Frauds and Connivances of others.</P>
<P>On this account when the first of <HI>May</HI> came, &amp; the Union taking place,
the new Duty was to begin, the Government found themselves ne∣cessitated
to send down a great many Officers into <HI>Scotland,</HI> if
possible, to put Things into some Order, and prepare the People
for the new Method of Collection—-; What Treatment these
Officers received in <HI>Scotland,</HI> how ill the People there used them,
and how little they were able to do, will best appear by this, That the
Government found themselves obliged by Proclamation, to let the
Duty go on for some Time in the same Methods, and Collected by
the same Officers, till the new Methods could be prepared.</P>
<P>Nor was this also for tho' the new Commission was formed as
soon as possible, for the Commissioners began to Act on the 9th of
<PB N="18" REF="592"/>
<HI>June,</HI> yet they had the whole Kingdom to Regulate as to the Col∣lection,
all their Officers to Instruct, both as to Method and to
Act; The first relating to the Accounts, and the last as to Gauging,
not an Officer in the whole Kingdom, understanding the use of the
Gauging Rod, as is Noted already, nor the People knowing the
Meaning of it.</P>
<P>This makes the Difficulty of Settling the Excise in <HI>Scotland</HI> ap∣pear,
and indeed who ever confiders the manner of Collection be∣fore
the Union, as before; will Wonder, how its was possible ever
to bring the Business into any Order, for the People being most
intolerably Averse at first, to the new Regulations, raised innume∣rable
Clamours at the Officers that came from <HI>England,</HI> as Imposing
Novelties on them, and confounding their Business—-; And
here, as well as in the Customs, the Clamour against <HI>Englishmen</HI>
being imployed, was laid hold of, but the Conduct of the Com∣missioners
here likewise effectually Answered that Pretence, for
no sooner had the Officers, sent by the Commissioners in <HI>England,</HI>
as above, done the Work they came about, <HI>viz.</HI> in Directing and
Instructing the Officers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the greatest part of them were
sent back again, and so few <HI>Englishmen</HI> remained in the Excise, that
it is not worth Naming.</P>
<P>The Names of the Commissioners as settled after some few Alte∣rations
were as follows
<Q><L>Alexander Wetherburn <HI>Esquire.</HI></L>
<L>John Montgomery <HI>Esquire.</HI></L>
<L>John Whittham <HI>Esquire.</HI></L>
<L>David Ross <HI>Esquire.</HI></L>
<L>Alexander Forbes <HI>Esquire.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Nor was the Duty of Excise as a Revenue without its Discourage∣ments,
<HI>as well at the Customs,</HI> the Article of Private Rights, referred
by the Union, had of course brought several Exemptions upon
them, some of which have proved very considerable Hindrances to
the Duty.</P>
<P>The Commissioners however, Disputed with some of those People
who claim'd Exemptions of Duty, and the debate on those Heads,
lay Undetermined before the Barons of Exchequer, at the Writing
these Sheets.</P>
<P>Under all these Discouragements, yet the Collection went on, and
the Brewers soon became Satisfied with the manner of Charging the
Excise, <HI>viz.</HI> by Gauging, as the moll Equal, Indifferent, and Un∣deniably
Certain; and, as a method no Man could be Wronged
by—; Which giving them all an Equality with one another;
was very much the Advantage of the Fair Traders—-, who always
Suffer by the Frauds of Clandestine Dealing.</P>
<P>Nay, this was evident by the Brewers theemselves, Who differing
with the City of <HI>Edinburghs</HI> Assessors, about the Taxes paid to the
<PB N="19" REF="593"/>
City, endeavoured so have the City Officers, Charge them by the
Gauging Rod, as in the Excise, but could not obtain it.</P>
<P>I have insisted upon the Difficulties of settling these Things, to
show the World the absolute Necessity, of placing the Collection of
the Revenue in <HI>Scotland,</HI> distinct from that in <HI>England;</HI> And also,
as a Thing needful, to show by what Steps the several Offices ar∣rived
to that Order and Exactness, which they now appeared to be
Managed in.</P>
<Q>I come now to the Affair of the Equivalent.</Q>
<P>The Calculations and Proportions between the Nations, being
the <HI>Ground from whence it became payable to Scotland;</HI> I have gone
thro' already, as distinctly as I can, in the several Observations
on the Minutes of the Treaty, first at London, and after, in the
Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> We are now come to the payment of it.</P>
<P>The Parliament had Determined, both how it should be Dis∣posed
of, and who should Dispose it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Queen should
Name Commissioners to Receive and Issue out the said Money,
according m the Terms of the Union; This you have expresly in
the Fifteenth Article of the Union, as concluded at London, as
follows; And it is agreed, That Her Majesty be Impowered to appoint
Commissioners, who shall be accountable to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
for disposing the said Summe of three hundred, ninety eight
thousand, eighty five Pounds, ten Shillings, and all other Moneys which
shall arise to <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the Agreements aforesaid, to the purposes
before mentioned; Which Commmissioners shall be Impowered to call for,
Receive, and Dispose of the said Moneys in manner aforesaid, and to
inspect the Books of the several Collectors of the said Revenues, and of
all other Duties, from whence an Equivalent may arise; And that the
Collectors and Managers of the said Revenues and Duties be obliged to
give to the said Commissioners subscribed Authentick Abbreviates of the
Produce of such Revenues and Duties arising in their respective Districts;
And that the said Commissioners shall have their Office within the Limits
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and shall, in such Office, keep Books containing Accounts
of the Amount of the Equivalents, and how the same shall have been
disposed of from time to time, which may be inspected by any of the Sub∣jects
who shall desire the samen.</P>
<P>The Queen, pursuant to this Power, appointed Commissioners
for the Management of the Equivalent, and the Money being raised
by Parliament, lay ready in the Bank of <HI>England.</HI></P>

</LIST></P>
<P>The Four Merchants of <HI>London</HI> were Named, because as
Members of the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> they were required to be pre∣sent
upon the Spot, in order to support the Credit of the Bank, in
case any Body had scrupled their Bills; And indeed there was Oc∣casion
sufficient for their being there, as will appear presently.</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> and the Money was not yet
Come away from <HI>London;</HI> It would be Endless to Record here, the
Scandalous Reflections spread about, of the Delay of Payment, and
how the <HI>English having secured the main Point,</HI> would pay the
Money when they pleased, or perhaps never; and some ran it up to
that Height, as to say, That the <HI>English</HI> Designed to Cheat them of
the Money.</P>
<P>Again, another sort of People pretended the Union was broke,
because the Money was not paid by the first of <HI>May,</HI> and there was
a Discourse of some Gentlemen, who came up to the Cross of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI>
and Protested in the Name of the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, That
the Conditions of the Treaty being not complyed with, and the
<PB N="21" REF="595"/>
Terms performed, the whole was Void, and <HI>Scotland</HI> was again
Free, whenever an Occasion offered, to lay hold of that Freedom
——; That some People were so weak to Talk thus, and that a
certain Gentleman was Foolish enough, to make such a Formal
Protestation, I have some Reason to believe; But that D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—H—was
the Man, I profess not to know, and believe, that Noble Person
to understand the Nature of the Treaty, and the Nature of Protest∣ing
also, better than so.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, such Protestation was of no use, neither could it
have any Signification, being made purely without Ground, the
Treaty having no where Tyed up the Government of <HI>England,</HI> to
have the Money actually in <HI>Scotland</HI> by such a Day—; Nor was
<HI>England</HI> by the Treaty, under any Obligation to a Day of Payment;
But Two Things prescribed the payment, and a Third clears it
all most effectually.</P>
<P>1. That by the Custom of <HI>England</HI> any payment Contracted for,
<HI>sine Die,</HI> becomes a <HI>Debt Demander,</HI> or payable at Demand; and
so the Day being not prefixt in the Articles, the Money became pre∣sently
due, <HI>viz.</HI> the first of <HI>May,</HI> but under no Forfeiture on delay
of Days, much less a Dissolution of Articles.</P>
<P>2. But if this Nicety had been insisted on, then it is Answered,
That the Money was actually payed by <HI>England,</HI> being delivered
by the Treasury to a certain Number of the Commissioners, appointed
for receiving the Equivalent, and this, either upon or before the
first of <HI>May;</HI> And tho' it was not actually come down into <HI>Scotland,</HI>
yet if it was delivered in <HI>London,</HI> to the proper Persons appointed to
receive it, the Government of <HI>England</HI> was fairly acquitted of the
payment—-; And this is to be seen by the said Commissioners
Receipt in the Exchequer in <HI>England,</HI> when the Money was paid.</P>
<P>3. But a third Clause shewed all this to be an Insignificant and a
most Ignorant Pretence, for the Equivalent was actually paid, and
made good to <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the Treaty was concluded, and it
was expresly stipulated so to be Ordered, in the Fifteenth Article,
in these words; It is agreed, that <HI>Scotland</HI> shall have an Equivalent
for what the Subjects thereof shall be so charged towards payment of the
said Debts of <HI>England,</HI> in all particulars whatsoever, in manner fol∣lowing
<HI>viz.</HI> That before the Union of the said Kingdoms, the Summe
of three hundred, ninety eight thousand and eighty five pound ten shil∣lings
be granted to Her Majesty by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> for the
Uses after-mentioned being the Equivalent, to be answered to <HI>Scotland</HI>
for such parts of the said Customs and Excises upon all Exciseable Li∣quors,
with which that Kingdom is to be charged upon the Union, as
will be applicable to the payment of the said Debts of <HI>England,</HI> accord∣ing
to the Proportions which the present Customs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> being
Thirty thousand Pounds per Annum, do bear to the Customs in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
computed at one Million, three hundred, forty one thousand, five
hundred and fifty nine Pounds <HI>per Annum:</HI> And which the present Ex∣cises
on Exciseable Liquors in <HI>Scotland,</HI> being thirty three thousand and
<PB N="22" REF="596"/>
five hundred Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> do bear to the Excises on Exciseable
Liquors in <HI>England,</HI> computed at nine hundred, forty seven thousand,
six hundred and two Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI> Which Summe of three
hundred, ninety eight thousand, eighty five Pounds, ten Shillings, shall
be due and payable from the time of the Union;</P>
<P>It is evident from this Article, That the Security Demanded by
<HI>Scotland,</HI> for the payment of this Money, was, That the Parliament
of <HI>England</HI> should raise the Sum agreed, and should grant it to Her Ma∣jesty,
for the Uses in that Fifteenth Article Expressed, That is in short,
That the Parliament should grant to tier Majesty such a Sum of Money,
and appropriate it to the payment of the Equivalent—; This
really was payment, and was so Accepted, and the Money being
Granted to the Queen, was nothing but as a Deposite in a Third
Hand, till the Ratification of the Treaty should pass in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and be Confirmed in <HI>England,</HI> or till the Union should rake place,
WHEN, AND AS SOON AS that was done, the Money was
actually the Right, the proper Goods of the Scots, and the Go∣vernment
of <HI>England</HI> could not have kept it back, no tho' the
Treaty had been afterward Dissolved, or broken; So that the Ob∣jection
against the payment of the Equivalent, <HI>in Time,</HI> Dyes, and
falls to the Ground, in this, That it was actually payed by <HI>England</HI>
before the Union began, and plac'd in such Hands as a Trust, to
be at the Demand of the <HI>Scots,</HI> as soon as the Union took place,
<HI>Due and payable from the Time of the Union,</HI> are the Words of the
Article—-; As soon therefore as the Union took place, the
Treasury of <HI>England</HI> became Debitor to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for such a Sum
of Money—; But the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> with whom the
Treaty was made, were Discharged of the Payment, as soon as ever
the Act of Appropriation was past in the House.</P>
<P>This, I think, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lear, and admits of no Dispute, but it shows
the Weakness of those People, that promised themselves any thing
from the delay of the Money coming into <HI>Scotland</HI>—; Nor did
their Error cease here, for when the Money came, they were not at
all better pleased, but raised new Clamours at the Union—-,
and really went to that Height in their Reproaches, that it seemed
as if they had yet latent Expectations of raising a new Tumult.</P>
<P>It was indeed something remarkable here, and not a few People
cook notice of it, That the very same People, who just before Ex∣claimed
at the <HI>English,</HI> for not paying the Money, and cried out
they were Cheated, and the Union broken, were the same——, who,
when the Money came, made as much Noise on the other hand of being
Bought and Sold, &amp; that Money being the Price of their Countrey.</P>
<P>The Violence of this Temper appearing so openly, I can not be
counted partial in giving a true Account of it, since I could not
be Faithful to the Matters of Fair, if I Omitted it.</P>
<P>On the Day of <HI>August</HI> the Money came to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
in Twelve Waggons, Guarded by a Party of <HI>Scots</HI> Dragoons, and
was carried directly to the Castle, If I omit to enter into the De∣tail
<PB N="23" REF="597"/>
of the Reproaches and Railings at the poor Innocent People
that brought it, nay, at the very Horses that drew the Carriages,
it is, because it was a Folly below Reproof, and rather deserves
Pity.</P>
<P>If I omit Naming a known Person, in no Concealed Station, who
was for having the Dragoons that Guarded it, Hanged for bring∣ing
it in—; And being asked, What he would have the poor Men
do with it? Answered, They, should have cut all them that
brought it to pieces, and kept the Money from coming into the
Countrey: It I omit Naming this Gentleman, it is in respect to his
Character, and in hopes he may live to be Wiser, and to acknow∣ledge
his inconsiderate Rashness.</P>
<P>The Waggons, as is Noted, were driven directly to the Castle, and
the Money Lodged there, to be issued in its Course—-; The
People set on by proper Engines, shewed their Dissatisfaction at
first, by rudely Stoning the poor Garters and Drivers, and Two or
Three were very much hurt by Stones, as they came back with
their Horses from the Castle.</P>
<P>But this was but the Remains of the Tumultuous Temper, we
have been taking Notice of before, and the poor Ignorant People
Acting only from outward appearances, without Consideration—,
grew Calm again of course—; Nor among the most Malecontent
persons could I ever find any, that when the Money upon the <HI>Afri∣can</HI>
Stock came to be paid, would think the species Unhallowed,
enough to refuse their share of it.</P>
<P>As soon as the Money was Arrived, the Commissioners for the
Equivalent began to Sit, and immediately applyed themselves to the
Distribution of it according to the Terms of the Treaty——; And
having set a parta due Proportion for the Expence of the Coinage,
they went immediately to Work with the <HI>African</HI> Stock, and began
to pay off.</P>
<P>Yet I must not Omit a Difficulty here, that had almost put the
Affair to a full ftop for a while—-, and this was from the Species
of the Money they had brought; The Case was as follows.</P>
<P>The Bank of <HI>England</HI> had that year, upon an Advance of a Sum of
Money to the Government, received 1300000 <HI>libs.</HI> or there abouts,
Exchequer Bills—, which being made Current by the Credit both
of the Government in publick, and after by the Bank in particular,
they presumed would pass in payment, as common paper Credit
usually did in London, without Interest, being always payable at
demand by the Bank in <HI>London,</HI> this they expected mould go
down without any Difficulty in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But the Bank seemed under some Mistake as to the Extent of
their Reputation, or at least as to the Circumstance of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when
they proposed the putting off these Exchequer Bills there.</P>
<P>However, they ventur'd, and sending only 100000 <HI>lib.</HI> in
ready Money, in the Waggons mentioned before, the other
298085 <HI>lib. shillings</HI>—, was sent down in this Paper Credit or
Exchequer Bills.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="598"/>
This raised a new Clamour in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and abundance of People
run away with it, that the <HI>English</HI> Trick'd them; that they
had sent them Paper in stead of Money, that the great Argument
formerly used to perswade <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Union, to take
upon them a share of the Burden of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, and to
accept of an Equivalent, was the great Advantage that should
accrue to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Circulating of so much ready Money in
the Nation—-; And that now they were to be put off with Bills
payable 300 Miles off, and which if Lost or Mi, or by Accident
Burnt, were Irrecoverable.</P>
<P>The Truth is, The Bank, of <HI>England</HI> took a wrong step here—;
For <HI>First,</HI> They ventured upon <HI>Scotland</HI> with their Bills in stead of
Money, without Consulting either the Temper or the Circumstances
of <HI>Scotland</HI> at that Time.</P>
<P>Had they Corresponded with the Bank of <HI>Scotland</HI> and obtained
of the said Bank to Circulate their Bills, either by their own Credit
or Cash, had they Established any running Cash in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the
Circulation, where they should have been Received and Issued on
Occasion, they had come off better—-;Or had the Bills had
running Interest upon them, that those People who laid them up,
might have had an Increase upon them as they lay by, there had
been some Reason to expect they might have pair.</P>
<P>But the Bank had Ingrossed the Interest paid on the Bills by the
Government, and then sent them Naked into the World, to Run
purely on the Credit of their Fund, without any Interest running
upon them. This, and considering <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Place not yet of a
great In-land Commerce, in which alone such Bills are capable of
being made Current, made it very improbable, that their Bills
should pals in <HI>Scotland;</HI> This Mistake the Commissioners them∣selves
saw, as soon as they came to <HI>Scotland</HI>—; And therefore
immediately sent away to <HI>England</HI> for 50000 <HI>lib. sterling more in
Gold</HI>—; Nor had this been able to have carried them thorow
the Payment, had not the Commissioners, very prudently taken
all the Exchequer Bills that any One brought them, and given Bills
of Exchange for them payable in <HI>London</HI>—.</P>
<P>When the Commissioners found how it was—, they saw no
Remedy, but to Declare, That tho' they had brought Exchequer
Bills down, in order to supply the deficiency of Bullion, which was
then scarce enough in <HI>England,</HI> yet that no body should be obliged
to take them without their Content, nor should any body be re∣fused
payment as they came in their Order; And as a certain Great
Person began with them, as fame thought, by way of Experiment,
and having a Demand for 4 or 5000 <HI>lib.</HI> upon the <HI>African</HI> Stock, re∣fused
to take any of the said Bills, the Cummissioners immediately
Ordered it all to be paid in <HI>Specie.</HI></P>
<P>I his, and a constant Currency of Payment, began to raise them
some Reputation, and some who were Friends to the Government,
and saw the Exigence of the present case, accepted of Exchequer
Bills for large Sums: Others would take half Money, half Bills—;
<PB N="25" REF="599"/>
And others that came for their Money before their Turn came, yet had
it offered them if they would take, Bills, still presering this Point
Sacred, that no body was refused his payment in course, in Money,
if he insisted on it; Thus, with a great deal of Difficulty, at last
they work'd thorow the payment of the <HI>African Stock</HI>—-; The
Bills went all away to <HI>England</HI> so directly, that in six Months time
there was not one to be seen.</P>
<P>so the Main End of the Bank, <HI>viz.</HI> The Circulation of these
Bills in Trade, as a paper Credit, was quite Lost, which, had the In∣terest
been runing upon them, would have been easie, and readily
complyed with.</P>
<P>However, it was at last contrary to Expeaation, concluded,
and the whole African Stock being paid off, that Company Dissol∣ved
and Died.</P>
<P>The next Affair was the Settlement of Justice in <HI>Scotland</HI>—;
And this suffering some Alteration, it is needful to give a true
Account of it according to my Title.</P>
<P>It had been stipulated by the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Articles,
That all other Laws, in use within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> do after
the Union, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in the same Force as
before (except such at are contrary to, or inconsistent with the Terms of
this Treaty) but alterable by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with
this Difference betwixt the Laws concerning Publick Right, Policy, and
Civil Government, and those which concern private Right; That the
Laws which concern publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, map
be made the-same throughout the whole United Kingdoms; But that no
Alteration be made in Laws which concern private Right, except for
evident Utility of the Subjects within <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>That the Court of Session, or Celledge of Justice, do after the Union,
and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within <HI>Scotland</HI>
as it is now Constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the
same Authority and Privileges as Before the Union, subject tteverthelefs
to such Regulations for the better Administration of Justice, as shall be
made by the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> And that the Court of Ju∣sticiary
do also after the Union, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in
all time coming within <HI>Scotland</HI> as it is now Constituted by the Laws
of that Kingdom, and with the fame Authority and Privileges as be∣fore
the Union, subject nevertheless to such Regulations as shall be made
by the Parliament of Great-Britain, and without prejudice of other
Rights of Justiciary.</P>
<P>These Clauses preserved the ordinary Process of Law in Case of
private Right, in the same Course and Condition as before, but all
Pleas of the Crown, Matters of Dispute between the Queen and
the Subject, <HI>relating to the Revenue,</HI> and Trade, being to be the
same as in <HI>England;</HI> For that Reason, there were necessary Alterati∣ons
to be made in the Methods, and even new Models of Proceed∣ings
to be Formed, special to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<PB N="26" REF="600"/>
<Q>And First of the Civil Peace.</Q>
<P>The several Branches of the Revenue, depending much upon
the Execution of petty Justice, and particularly the Excise, in which
the. Justices of Peace are in most Cases, the judges between the
Brewer and the Collectors; In this case, it was Necessary to Renew
the Model formerly used, and taken from <HI>England,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Of Justices,
Constables, Headboroughs, &amp;c. Aad this not only for the Deciding Diffe∣rences
in the Duties, but in Forcible. Entries, Executing Warrants,
Apprehending Offenders,, and the like; In which Cases Constables
and other Officers are necessary, both to preserve the Peace,
to Assist in searching Houses, and in Executing the respective
Warrants of the said Justices of the Peace.</P>
<P>This, I say, made it absolutely Necessary, to Establish the same
Method of Civil Justice in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in <HI>England, viz.</HI> by Justices
of the Peace, Constables, &amp;c. Which at that Time was not in use
In the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>It had indeed been formerly attempted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there
were some. Acts at Parliament then in Force, for the making Justices
of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in <HI>England,</HI> particularly the 12th, <HI>Act</HI>
of the first Parl. <HI>Carol. 2. anno</HI> 1661, and again by the 38th <HI>Act</HI>
of the same Parliament—; And these Acts are Recited again in
the Proclamation for Erecting new Justices at this Time, which
Proclamation leaving; put the Names of the Persons as Useless and
Tedious, I have annexed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> F (3).</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Revolution,</HI> this Method of Governing by Justices,
however useful in its kind, yet as having been Negligently or Ar∣bitrarily
made use of in the former Times, was laid aside, and the
Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> lay as it had usually done, too much in the
absolute Dispostion of the Heretable Magistrates, such as Sheriffs of
Counties, Steuarts of Stewartries, and such Right as the Superiori∣ties
and Usages of Places gave to the Lairds; A Constitution not
at all Calculated for the Liberty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the increase of the
Happinefs of the People.</P>
<P>Upon the Settling the Customs and Excise, as above, it be∣came,
I say, necessary to restore the former Model of petty justice, as
<HI>per</HI> the Proclamation before Named, was done at this Time, and
accordingly Justices of the Peace, and Constables were Erected all
over <HI>Scotland</HI>——; But this received another Interruption as a
Consequence of the Union, which put a stop to all the Civil
Administration lot a Time, as follows.</P>
<P>By the Nineteenth Article of the Union, the Affair of the Privy
Council in <HI>Scotland</HI> was left thus.</P>
<P>“And that after the Union, the Queens Majesty and Her Royal
Successors, may continue a Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for preserving
of publick Peace and Order, until the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
shall think sit to alter it, or Establish any other effectnes
Method for that end.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="601"/>
As soon as the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> met, and began to
Enquire into the Matter, they found the very Nature of a Privy
Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but especially the Manner, <HI>of their Privy Coun∣cils,</HI>
so inconsistent with the Treaty of Union, and above all with
the Liberty of the Subject, that they effectually Dissolved it, and
Voted, that there should be but one Privy Council in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>I know this Act was opposed by several sorts of People—, and
Complaint was made after its Dissolution, That <HI>Scotland</HI> was left
without any Form of Government; some others Complained from
another principle, of which I need say nothing here.</P>
<P>The Ministers of State also opposed it a little, but no further
than as they thought Things were not Ripe in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for so sud∣den
a Dissolution of the Face of Power among, them, and therefore
would have had it continued for some certain limited Time only,
and that with such Limitations of Authority, as might be Regulated
by Parliament—; But it was thought both Burdensome and
Dangerous, and indeed the Council in <HI>Scotland</HI> Acting Arbitrarily,
had given the Lovers of Liberty such an Aversion to them, that
they could not hear of it; And so after some Struggle, the Coun∣cil
was Dissolved by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>This is mentioned here, because of the Interruption given by the
Accident of this Dissolution, to the Course of petty Justice, as
aforesaid; for now all the Commissions of the Peace Ceased, being
Granted by the said Privy Council, and by the new Establishments
of the Council which was now to be called <HI>The Council of Great-Britain,</HI>
and which was to have the same Powers, and no other,
which the Council of <HI>England</HI> had before; The Commissions of the
Peace could no more be Given by the Council, but by the Lord Chan∣cellor;
The Commissions therefore Terminated, and the new Method
of Administration met with an Interruption of several Months, but
was Restored again by a general Commission of the Peace, under
the Great Seal of <HI>Britain,</HI> Nominating Justices of the Peace
thro' all <HI>Scotland,</HI> conform to the Method of <HI>England;</HI> This Com∣mission
bears Date the 13 Day of <HI>May Anno</HI> 1708. And on this
Foot the whole Island now stands in one Form of Administration,
as to petty Justice, and therefore this Act is called, <HI>An Act for
rendring the Union more compleat;</HI> Which Act for the more parti∣cular
understanding this Affair, I have added in the <HI>Appendix,</HI>
No. (H. 3.) But here it is to be observed, That tho' this Act gives
Power to all the Justices of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to <HI>Do, Use, and
Exercise over all Persons within their several Bounds, whatever doth
appertain to the Office, and Trust of a Justice of Peace, by virtue of the
Laws in</HI> England <HI>before the Union, in Relation to or for the Preserva∣tion
of the Publick Peace;</HI> Yet it is provided, That <HI>in all the Sessions
of the Peace, they are prescribed to the Methods of Tryal and Judgment,
according to the Laws of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>This I Note here, because some would have suggested. That this
Erecting of Courts of petty Justice, <HI>For such the several Sessions of the
Justices properly are</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &amp; Giving them Authorities from the Laws
<PB N="28" REF="602"/>
and Usage of <HI>England,</HI> was an Invasion of the Nineteenth Article
of the Union—, but it was clear otherwise, for tho' in the Pub∣lick
Peace their Methods were the same as in <HI>England,</HI> yet it is ob∣servable;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That very Clause was Enacted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the several
Acts of Parliament of 1661, recited in the Commission, and
never Rescinded in <HI>Scotland;</HI> And by the Union those Acts
are of course Confirmed, not being any way inconsistent with
or contradicting the Treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Had it not been so, the Thing it self had been no way
Injurious to the Treaty of Union, the Methods of Tryal, Judge∣ment,
aud Execution, being as above, prescribed by the Laws
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to continue in the same Form as before.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And this will more particularly appear, in Reading the very Na∣ture
and Form of the Commissions of the Peace Granted by the
Queen, to the respective Counties or Shires in <HI>Scotland,</HI> One of
which, <HI>viz.</HI> for the Shire of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> For the more especial un∣derstanding
this Matter, I have annexed in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> part II.
<HI>Numb.</HI> (G. 3.)</P>
<P>I might have entred here upon the Differences of Proceedings
in the several new Established Courts of Justice, as of the Exche∣quer,
and Admiralty, and the General and petty Sessions of the
justices—; But these Things seem not the proper Subject of a
History, so I wave them here; The latter part also being very well
performed to my hand, I mean, relating to the Proceedings and
Office of a Justice of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Ingenious Hand
of Mr. <HI>William Forbes</HI> Advocate in <HI>Scotland;</HI> To which I refer the
Reader.</P>
<P>There was an Alteration in Matters of Justiciary, as it is called
in <HI>Scotland</HI>—; That is, of Criminal Process; For whereas
this was wholly left to a certain Court, consisting of Five Judges,
who were therefore called, <HI>The Lords of the Justiciary,</HI> and that
their Court was holden only at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it was considered, that
this was too great an Interruption of Justice, and often times oc∣casioned
the neglect of Prosecution, as well as made that Prosecu∣tion
both Difficult and Chargeable to the Subject, by which means
Thefts, Violences, and sometimes Murders escaped due Punishment,
the Parliament Determined by the same Act of Parliament, as be∣fore,
That the Lords of the Justiciary should divide the Kingdom
into Circuits, and that these Circuits should be Twice a Year—,
that thus Justice might, as in <HI>England,</HI> be carried Home to every
Mans Door, and all the Former Inconveniencies might be for the
future avoided.</P>
<P>The Manner, Methods, and other Circumstances, such as Time,
Place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Since they were nothing at all Altered, the Act of Par∣liament
referring wholly to a former Law, made in the <HI>3d.</HI> Session
of the <HI>2d.</HI> Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. came not under the Head
<PB N="29" REF="603"/>
of Alterations which I am now upon, and consequently need not
be inserted.</P>
<P>I might bring the Alterations of Elections of Members for Par∣liament
into this Head, as well of the Lords as Commons; But it
requires nothing, but to repeat the very Articles of the Union
again; And I think it is so expresly set down there, that it needs
no Comment at all, being nothing but meer Matter of Form; But
as there required some Addition to the Manner of the Returning of
Writs, and of the Managing Elections, you will find them in the
same Act of Parliament last quoted, and printed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> as
above—, all that Matter being fully determined in this Act—.</P>
<P>The Matter of the Exchequer Court now erected, needs no other
Description than this, That it is erected in the same Form, and
proceeds by the same Method as in <HI>England,</HI> having Barons, a Re∣membrancer,
Treasurer, and all the respective Clerks and Offices as
in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The First Barons were as follows,
<Q>The Earl of <HI>Seafield</HI> formerly Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Lord Chief Baron,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Baron <HI>Clark,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Baron <HI>Maitland,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Baron <HI>Smith,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Baron <HI>Scroop.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>The Admiralty Court in <HI>Scotland</HI> remained, and the Earl of
<HI>Weemyss,</HI> who was before Lord Admiral in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was now made
Vice-Admiral, by Commission under the Princes of <HI>Denmark</HI> Lord
High Admiral of <HI>Britain,</HI> and was, at the same time, nominated
a Member of the Princes Council in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Inferior Courts of Judicature in the Admiralty remained as
before, suffering no Alteration in Form, save that what related to
the Publick Revenue, or the Claims of the Sovereign, began to be
modelled as in <HI>England,</HI> agreeable to the 18th. and 19th. Articles
of the Union.</P>
<P>Thus the Law in <HI>Scotland</HI> remained intire, the Process in Com∣mon
Causes being the same, and the Alterations being confined, as
per the Treaty, to the Established Methods of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the Coyn; And tho' this has been a Thing of
great Consequence, yet it requires little more to be said to it, than
just that it suffered a general Revolution; And that all the former
Coyns of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as the Foreign <HI>Species</HI> of Money which
went current in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Money excepted, was Called
in and Recoyned, the <HI>English</HI> Money being only to pass current.</P>
<P>But there was a Difficulty which I have noted in the Minutes
gave them some Trouble, <HI>viz:</HI> That the <HI>English</HI> Money, which
went for one Penny in every Shilling Advance, should be reduced
to a <HI>Par,</HI> that the Loss should be made good by the Government,
and yet the <HI>English</HI> not bring in great Quantities to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be
offered to the Mint at one Penny <HI>per</HI> Shilling, and immediately re∣ceived
again with an Allowance of the Difference: To prevent
<PB N="30" REF="604"/>
this, that Contrivance was found out, to bring in all the <HI>English</HI>
Money at one certain Day, and receive it out again with an Allow∣ance
for the Difference—; This occasioned the Proclamation
for the Alteration, that all the Money should be paid in on a short
Day, and immediately returned with Notes for the Difference;
This Proclamation, as it expresses the whole Scheme, I have added
in the <HI>Appendix, No. I;</HI> Which, tho' it be a long Proclamation,
yet, as it may be a Precedent in like Cases, I have set down for
general Information.</P>
<P>The several Proclamations for the gradual Calling in the Old
Money, are too many to note here; It may suffice to hint, That,
as the Foreign Money being brought in, which amounted to above
150000 Pounds <HI>Sterling;</HI> And this going into the Mint, the New
Coyn began to Circulate very speedily; And, at the Writing these
Sheets, the whole Nation was full of New Money.</P>
<P>The several Denominations of Money before the Union in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> I mean not of Old Obsolete Coyns, but such as were
now current, were as follows,
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Bodle or Turner, six of which goes to a Penny</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Half-penny or Baubee, two to a Penny</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Irish</HI> Half-penny and <HI>French</HI> Doits had pass'd,

the Coyn was Called in, and the Price of this Re∣duced,
the Government made no Allowance on the

<ITEM>There was, at this time, no <HI>Scots</HI> Gold. Coyn current, or

</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>There were several <HI>Species of Scots</HI> Money that had been current,
and of which several Remainders were to be found—; But the
Quantities were so small, that I do not place them among the
current Coyn.</P>
<P>It is enough to say, that all sorts were called in by the Treaty,
and no Money made current by the Government, but the <HI>English</HI>
or <HI>British</HI> Coyn.</P>
<P>I need not Record the Days and Times, when and how long
every particular <HI>Species</HI> were permitted to pass; 'Tis enough to say,
the Prudence of the Government so ordered it, that the People felt
no Miss, or Want of the current Money; And the Thing was done
so gradually, that the New Money was Circulating, before the Old
was Called in.</P>
<P>This was done thus—; First the <HI>English</HI> Money was reduced,
as has been observed, by Proclamation—-; Then the Foreign
Money was brought in; And this being a much greater Quantity
than was expected, the Mint immediately fell to Work with it
—; And this, joyned to the Money brought down for the Equi∣valent,
furnish'd above 200000 <HI>l.</HI> in Silver Money, besides what
<HI>English</HI> Money was in the Countrey before; So that the New Mo∣ney
was dispers'd in every Corner of the Nation insensibly, and
the Old went off gradually, without any Interruption to Business
—-; And at the Writing these Sheets, the last, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI>
Milled Money was yet passing, but appointed to come into the
Mint by a certain Day; There were several Proclamations for this,
and several Days appointed; I have added only one in the <HI>Appen∣dix,</HI>
to let the Reader into the Method settled for this purpose,
which terminated the Currency of the <HI>Scots</HI> Money to the 25<HI>th.</HI> of
<HI>February</HI> 170 1/8; But even that Time was lengthened afterwards,
and the <HI>Scots</HI> Money suffered to pass again till the latter end of
<HI>September</HI> 1708—; And thus by Degrees the <HI>English</HI> Coyn pre∣vailed,
<PB N="32" REF="606"/>
and is now the only current Coyn of the Nation. This
Proclamation is marked in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> N. K 3.</P>
<P>I cannot say so much for the New Regulations of Weights and
Measures, in which, tho' appointed by the Union to be made the
same, little Progress could be made at the Writing of these Ac∣counts,
save that the Publick Business of the Custom-House was all
settled by the Weights and Measures of <HI>England;</HI> But Custom had
so inured the People to the former Weights and Measures, especial∣ly
the Weights for their Retailing Goods, and the Measures for Corn,
that it was impossible to bring the Change about so soon; Time
alone can bring it to the issue designed.</P>
<P>Nor is the reducing the Measures to an Uniform Standart so ab∣solutely
necessary, as that we should think the Union Defective for
want of it; Since the Measures, <HI>especially that which we call Dry Mea∣sure,
as of Corn and Fruit,</HI> is at this time various almost all over
<HI>England</HI>—; As particularly in the North, the <HI>Boll</HI> remains a
received Measure in <HI>Northumberland and Cumberland,</HI> in the West,
as in <HI>Cornwal</HI> and <HI>Devonshire,</HI> the Bushel is almost two Bushels of
the common Measure—; Even the <HI>Winchester</HI> Bushel, which is
the Standart of Measure in <HI>England,</HI> varies, and in some places it
contains eight Gallons, in others nine Gallons, in some places they
have one to the Score thrown into the Measure, in other places not
—; Again, in Liquid Measure we have the Quart of two kinds
for several Liquors, as the Wine Quart and the <HI>Winchester</HI> Quart, we
have the Pottle and Gallon for dry Measure, the Pint and thence
up to the Gallon of Liquid Measure; in Coals we have what is called
the Chalder at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the Chalder at <HI>London,</HI> and the differ∣ing
Chalder in several differing parts—; At <HI>London</HI> the Chalder
is 36 Bushels, at <HI>Sandwich</HI> 32, at <HI>Lym</HI> 40, at <HI>Newcastle 70 Bushels;</HI>
So, tho' the Measures of Corn and Liquors should have their Varia∣tions
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to the old Customs and Usage of Towns,
Counties, and Manners, yet this does not at all render the Union
incompleat; Since the reducing the Weights and Measures to an
equal Standart in the Publick Accounts, such as in the Customs,
Tolls, Excises, Publick Receipts and Payments, <HI>and the like,</HI> is as
effectual an Equality as is needful; And indeed is as much as was
intended by the Union, no Act of Parliament, Law, or Statute
that can be made, being able to oblige the Countrey People in eve∣ry
place to leave off their wonted Calculations and Denominations
of Things, which are frequently made upon the Foot of their An∣cient
Customs; <HI>For Example, as before,</HI> the Valuation of Lands,
Tenor of Leases, the Rents, the Entails, Rent-Charges, Liferents,
and Payments for, or out of Land Revenue, are all reckoned in
<HI>Scotland</HI> by the <HI>Chalder, Boll, Firlot,</HI> and <HI>Lippy,</HI> and cannot be
altered; Even Marriage Settlements and Entails are entered in
this manner; And it would run <HI>Scotland</HI> into all manner of Con∣fusion,
to oblige them at once to leave off all the Terms, by which
their Lands are known Valued, Mortgaged, Entailed, Charged or
Conveyed.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="607"/>
I think we have thus gently touch'd at all the Alterations of
Moment which were made in the Laws, Trade, Custom and Con∣stitution
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to my Title; But lest it may be
thought, That these Alterations ly too much dispersed up and
down this Book, in the Relation of particular Cases, I shall endea∣vour
to sum them up in the following Abridgement.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As to the Constitution, tho' last named—, I conceive
it suffered some Alteration, tho' not, as was alledged by some, an
intire Dissolution—; It was not dissolved, because the Govern∣ment
by King and Parliament continued the same, <HI>viz.</HI> A Limit∣ed
Monarchy; It received no Diminution, but an Addition of
Privileges and Liberties; And had the <HI>Scots</HI> thought fit to have
gone a little further, and made Provision for Transferring their Su∣periorities,
they might have at last come to an intire Enjoyment
of that same Liberty that <HI>England</HI> is now so happy in—; How∣ever,
tho' the Constitution received no Dissolution, yet it is ac∣knowledged,
that it suffered Alterations in several Articles, of
which these are the principal.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That tho the Monarchy is the same, yet that they be∣come
Incorporated into one Monarchy with their Neighbour
Kingdom, subjected for ever to the same Sovereign, and en∣gaged
in War, Peace, Alliances and Succession with them; So
that they can no more act in their separate Capacity, in any
Thing relating to Government or Constitution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They suffer Alterations in their Representative—, and
these consist in Two Branches; <HI>First,</HI> That the Number of
their Representative is reduced to 45. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Electi∣ons
pass under a new Regulation, and are managed by a dif∣ferent
Method. And, T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lly, That they Sit not any more in
Parliament by themselves, but in Conjunction with the <HI>English</HI>
Parliament, Representing the several Counties and Corporati∣ons,
as Members of the United Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Hereditary Branch of Parliament, I mean the Peers,
suffer also an Alteration, being changed from a full Appear∣ance
in Parliament to a Representative Appearance, and that
Representative Limited to the Number of Sixteen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Their Regal Administration suffers an Alteration; The
Sovereign, who before executed the Civil Power in a separate
Capacity, being now obliged to change the Face of that Ad∣ministration
into an United Management, Governing now by
One Parliament, One Privy Council, One High Admiral,
One Chancery, One Treasury—; And, in short, One ge∣neral
OEconomy of Government—; Thus the several di∣stinct
Offices of Admiral, Chancellor, Treasurer, Secretaries of
State, and President of Privy Council, sunk in either King∣dom,
and New Commissions were issued—; As One Pri∣vy
Council, and One President, under the Title of Lord Pre∣sident
of the Privy Council of <HI>Britain,</HI> Lord High Chancellor
of <HI>Britain,</HI> Lord High Treasurer of <HI>Britain,</HI> Lord High Admi∣ral
<PB N="34" REF="608"/>
of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the like, and which I close all with, the
Queen her self lays down her separate Titles, and is now no
more Queen of <HI>England, Scotland, &amp;c.</HI> But Queen of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> and is called in Missives, and in Foreign Accounts,
Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty—; Her Troops are no more <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
and <HI>Scots,</HI> but <HI>British</HI> Forces—; And the Arms of the
Island are a new Incorporated and Quartered together—,
as appears at large in the foregoing Sheets.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This, I think, is the Sum of the principal Alterations in the
Constitution of <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Union; In all which, except that
of the Parliament, the Commons being reduced in Number, and
the Lords by Representative; I say, in all the rest, <HI>England</HI> suffer∣ed
the same Alterations as <HI>Scotland,</HI> such as dissolving her Parlia∣ment,
her Name as a Kingdom, her Council, Great Offices, and
Title of her Sovereign—; And all things began <HI>de novo</HI> in
both Kingdoms, under the single Denomination of <HI>Britain</HI> and
<HI>British.</HI></P>
<P>The second Head of Alterations is that of the Laws; And this
is so particularly entered into in the beginning of this very part of
my Work, that I need be but very short.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Laws of Government continue as the Government
continues establish'd in the Claim of Right, I mean as to the
Limitations of Government and Obedience; Nor has <HI>Scotland</HI>
suffered any Loss, but rather been a manifest Gainer in this
Point by the Union; The Privy Council Tyranny being a∣bolish'd,
who had arrived to that Height in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to
give their Acts almost of an equal Authority to Acts of Parlia∣ment
—; A power wholly disclaimed by the Privy Coun∣cil
in <HI>England,</HI> to whose Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Authorities the present
Council of <HI>Britain</HI> is by parliament expresly Limited and
Confined.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Laws of Private Right have suffered no Alteration,
other than as Private Right may be intermix'd with that of
the Crown—; But all the Laws of Publick Right, such as
relate to Customs and Excises, have suffered the Alterations
mentioned in the Union, a Court of Exchequer being esta∣blish'd
in <HI>Scotland</HI> for that purpose; And this was necessary,
as has been noted, because of the Alterations necessary in the
Revenue, and in the respective Methods of Ascertaining and
Collecting the Customs, Excises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> due to the Crown;
And in this Clause may be included the several Laws for Pe∣nalties,
Fines, Forfeitures, and Confiscations, upon the par∣ticular
Trespasses of the Laws relating to Customs and Excise,
which were wholly new—.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Governing Laws relating to the Civil Peace have
suffered some Alteration as to what was just before the Uni∣on
by the Erecting Justices of the Peace; But this seems a Re∣storing
what was before, rather than an Alteration of what
was, since it was nothing but what was actually put in Practice
<PB N="35" REF="609"/>
twice before, and what there were Laws then in Being to ju∣stify
their Return. So all the Alterations that seem to be made
now, were, <HI>First,</HI> Only that the Justices of Peace formerly had
their Commission from the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but now
received it from the Lord Chancellor of <HI>Britain</HI>—; And, <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
That the Justices of Peace had some new Powers vested
in them since the Union, which they had not before, such as
determining Disputes in the Duty of Excise, giving Power of
Distress for Payment, Warrants of Forcible Entries, in case of
Concealments of Customs, and the like.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All the rest of the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> remained the same per the
Union; The Circuits of the Lords of the Justiciary I take also to
be no Innovation at all, as what had formerly been practised.</P>
<P>I come now to Alterations of Trade; And these can receive
but a very short Description here, because the greatest Alte∣rations
which happened in Trade, could not follow the Union so
closs at the Heels, as the Time of the Writing these Sheets require
to relate it; But such as were immediately the Consequence of the
Union, were such as these,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A general Prohibition and Stop of Commerce with <HI>France,</HI>
which, till now, <HI>Scotland</HI> publickly carryed on.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A Prohibition of all Exports and Imports as in <HI>England;</HI>
And by virtue of that Clause, a particular Prohibition of the
Exportation of Wool, which was, till then, publickly allow∣ed
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which, tho' People seemed at first very
uneasy at, yet was, without Doubt, very much for the Pub∣lick
Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Manufactures were thereby
quite sunk as to Exportation—; This Article was attended
with Penalties and Forfeitures particular, and such as were
not practised in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for which the Laws of Excise
and Customs in <HI>England</HI> were introduced, and the Trials on
which were brought on, either before the Justices of Peace, or
Court of Exchequer, as above.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Whereas <HI>Scotland</HI> had, before this, prohibited all the
<HI>English</HI> Woollen Manufactures, under severe Penalties, and
<HI>England,</HI> on the other Hand, had excluded the <HI>Scots</HI> from
Trading with <HI>Scots</HI> Ships to their Colonies in America, directly
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had Confiscated even their own <HI>English</HI>
Ships Trading to the said Colonies from England, if Navigat∣ed
or Manned with above one Third Scott Seamen, had said
Tolls and heavy Imports upon Cattel and Linen Imported into
England from Scotland, and had prohibited the Exportation of
Corn from England to <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' the Occasion of it might
be never so great, but on the same Conditions, and under
the same Restrictions as to other Countries, Now, by the Uni∣on,
all these Prohibitions, Restraints, Tolls, Imports, and
Exclusions on either Hand, were taken off; The <HI>English</HI> Growth
and Manufactures, formerly prohibited, came immediately,
free of all Interruptions into <HI>Scotland;</HI> All the Tolls and Im∣posts
<PB N="36" REF="610"/>
upon <HI>Scots</HI> Cattel, Linen, or other Goods in <HI>England;</HI>
were taken off; All the Ports of <HI>England,</HI> whether in <HI>Europe</HI> or
<HI>America,</HI> were open to Scott Ships, without any Imposts or
Restraint; <HI>Scots</HI> Sailers in <HI>English</HI> Bottoms were immediately
free, and Ships from the <HI>English</HI> Colonies might Sail to, and
Unlade free in <HI>Scotland,</HI> without any Obstruction.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These I call Alterations in the Laws of Trade; Besides which,
there were some particular Alterations which relate to the Draw∣hacks,
Bounties, and Allowances on the Exportation, and for
Encouragement of the Exportation of Fish, Corn, Pork, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of
which I need say nothing, having been very particular already in
the Relation of the Debates upon those Heads in Parliament.</P>
<P>The Consequences of these Things upon Trade are at present
sew, but will necessarily be far greater hereafter—; The first
visible Consequence was the Rise and Fall of several kinds of Mer∣chandizes,
as the new Alterations, Prohibitions, or Importations
of them happened, differing from what they were before.</P>
<P>As for Example, Wines, Brandy, and all kinds of Goods of the
Growth of France, must of Course rife in their Value, the further
Import being prohibited; And this would have enrich'd a great
many Families in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who had Quantities of these Goods on
their Hands, had not the Difficulty of Enforcing these Prohibitions
at first laid Trade open to Clandestine Importations, by which the
Fair Trader was, as in such Cases always happens, a very great
Sufferer.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All the Goods of the Growth of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies,
or which were to be had from <HI>England,</HI> being now Imported directly
to <HI>Scotland,</HI> began to come as the Return of the Scots Manufactures
—; Several Ships being laden from Scotland to Virginia and
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the very first Year after the Union.</P>
<P>Another Consequence of this Union in Trade, was the letting
fall almost all the Woollen Manufactures, which had been erected
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and where they began to come to some Perfection in
making Broad Cloth, Druggets, and Stuffs of all sorts; But, upon
the Opening the <HI>English</HI> Trade, they were immediately Co Throng'd
with <HI>English</HI> Goods of the same sorts so much cheaper, that it ap∣peared
those Things would die of Course.</P>
<P>Tho' indeed this seemed to be some Blow to their Trade, and
particularly to the Imployment of their Poor, yet, at the same
time, the Duties upon Linen from <HI>Scotland</HI> being taken off in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
made so great a Demand for Scots Linen more than usual,
that it seemed the Poor could want no Imployment; And several
kinds of Linen being set to Work, by <HI>English</HI> Men, which never be∣fore
were made, or at least for Exportation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> such as Sail-Cloths,
Canvas, Damask, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is thought, the Imployment of
the Poor was not lessened by this Alteration.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Lower and Courier Manufactures in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
which were made of their own Wool, seemed to increase,
and not only found a larger Vent in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but were bought up
<PB N="37" REF="611"/>
by the <HI>English</HI> Merchants, who brought other Stuffs thither, and
fold in <HI>England,</HI> And these Manufactures are not unlikely to rise
to a considerable Height, such as <HI>Stirling</HI> Serges, in <HI>England</HI> called
<HI>Shaloons, Musselburgh</HI> Stuffs, and the like; And we find in <HI>England</HI>
some Proposals from the <HI>African</HI> Company, for the making <HI>Guinea</HI>
Stuffs there, which perhaps may in time come to be very conside∣rable.</P>
<P>I might enter here into the Schemes and Projects, which have
made much Noise in the World for Improvement of Fishing in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and of Navigation and building Ships in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But as
these things have yet made no Alterations in the Trade, and are but
in <HI>Embrio</HI> at the Writing these Sheets, I cannot mingle them here as
Matter of History, but have touch'd them more at large in the
Preface.</P>
<P>It remains only to speak of the Alterations of the Customs—;
And this would have required a long Table of the several Duties
and Impost formerly paid in <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the Export and Import
of Merchandizes—; But having already given an Account, That
the whole Outturns are fettled upon the <HI>English</HI> Foot; And the
Duties of all Kinds being too large to insert here, and already Print∣ed
in the Book of Rates, Re-printed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it would be a
Vain Labour to recite the Particulars: And as to the Difference
between the Duties on the <HI>English</HI> Foot, and the Duties as paid be∣fore,
it required the very same Recital of Particulars, the Length of
which would be intolerable; And for this Reason, tho' I have re∣serred
to some Schemes said to be in the second part of this Appen∣dix,
and which I received from the Custom-House in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet
when I came to find upon Examination, that the Tacksmen of the
Customs in Scotland usually compounded with the Merchants, and
reduced the said Customs to what Sum they pleased, I chose to omit
a Scheme, which, when put down, would give the Render no
certain Guess at the Thing, and consequently signify no∣thing.</P>
<P>If any Man should enquire, Whether, upon the whole of these
Alterations in Trade, Scotland is Gainer or Loser, I must ac∣knowledge,
it is a difficult Point to resolve at so small a Di∣stance
from the Finishing the Union; But, as to the Profit of
the Trade between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> in particular, is ap∣pears
at the Writing these Sheets, I shall Leave the Impartial Ob∣server
to guess by these Two Particulars.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That about Seventeen Ships from the several Ports of
Scotland are already fitted out, and sent away to the <HI>English</HI>
Colonies, whose Loading is certainly the Product of the
Ground, or Labour of the Poor, and whose Return must be in
Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Indico, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Money—.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That above 170000 Bolls of Corn of sundry sorts has
already been Shipped off from <HI>Scotland</HI> for <HI>England,</HI> beside a
very great Quantity bought up by <HI>England,</HI> and Shipp'd di∣rectly
for <HI>Portugal;</HI> Both these Articles are Additions to the
<PB N="38" REF="612"/>
Trade of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and both within little more than a Year
immediately succeeding the Union of the Island: What fur∣ther
Encrease of Commerce may accrue to <HI>Scotland,</HI> when
these Bloody Wars shall end, and when Peace shall be restor∣ed
to <HI>Europe,</HI> I shall not pretend to Examine; But there
seems to be no Question, but the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> stands
fair for very great Improvements.</ITEM>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">At <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> The 22d of October, 1706.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commission of the General Assembly of this National
Church, having under their most sericus Consideration;
That the great and weighty Affair of a Treaty of Union, be∣tween
the two Nation, is now laid before the Parliament; And
how much the Result of their Determinations, with Respect to the
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne may prove of the bighest Gonsequence; both to this Church
and Nation in all their Interests Civil and Religious; And that both

we have enjoyed, and hitherto, through the Infinite Goodness,
and Lorg-suffering Patience of GOD do still enjoy, our Unthanks
Fulness for, and Unsruitfulness, under the Gospel; Our Formality,
Decay of Zeal and slackness in Promoving according to our Stations,
the much called for Work, of Sincere Personal and National Refor∣mation;
May justly provoke the Righteous and Holy GO<HI>D,</HI> to re∣move
our Blessings, to smite us in his hot Displeasure; and for our
Sins to leave our Rulersin this vastly important, and difficult Exigence
wherein there is so much need o'clear and unprejudicated Light, and
of Harmony, and Oneness in the LORD: They have therefore judg∣ed
it incumbent upon them to excite themselves and all the People
of GOD in the Land to much Sariousness, Diligence, and continued
Fervour in applying to the Throne of Grace, upon so great and mo∣mentuous
Affairs: And they do hereby most seriously and earnestly
Recommend to all the Presbytries within this National Church; To
appoint, set a part, and observe a Day, for solemn publick Prayer,
Fasting and Humiliation, in all the Curches within their Respective
Bounds, as soon as possible; For which End the Moderators of the
several Presbytries are to call them <HI>pro re nata,</HI> as soon as this comes
to their Hand; And farder, that Presbytries continue to keep among
themselves, and Ministers with their Sessions, Dyets, for persisting

and of all the Lords People, a due Concern about their proper duty
with Respect unto the Church of CHRIST, and the great
now in Agitation.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="615"/>
And the Commission doth most earnestly beseech and obtest in the
Bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ, all their Brethren of the Ministry,

that they call the Regents and Matters of the Colledge of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>

And We Ordain all the Inhabitants of the said Burgh, readi∣ly
to Assist and Concurr with the Magistrates, for repressing and pu∣nishig

for preventing the like wicked Infolence in Time coming; We
with Advice foresaid, hereby declare, That in Cafe and when∣ever
any such Disorderly Convocation or Tumult shal appear, or
begin to appear for hereafter; and that thereupon Intimation that
be made by the Magistrates, to all and sundry, to withdraw and

Conveened the 29th of October last, upon the
Great Concern of the Union, Proposed betwixt Scotland
and England, for Concerting such Measures, as should
be esteemed Proper for Them to take, with Relation to
Their TRADE, and other Concerns.</HEAD>
<OPENER>HUMBLY SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THAT as by the CLAIM OF RIGHT, it is the Privilege of all
Subjects to Petition: Soat this Time, being mostly Impow∣ered
by Our CONSTITUENTS; and knowing the SENTI∣MENTS
of the PEOPLE We Represent: It is Our Indispensible
DULY, to Signifie to Your Grace, and the Honourable Estates of
Parliament. That as We are not against an Honourable and Safe U∣nion
with <HI>England,</HI> Considing with the BEING OF THIS KING∣DOM,
and PARLIAMENTS thereof: Without which, We con∣ceive
neither Our RELIGION, nor Our CIVIL INTERESTS and
TRADE, as We now, by LAW, Enjoy them, can be Secured to Us,
and Our Posterity, Jar less can We expect to have the Con∣dition
of
the PEOPLE of SCOTLAND, with Relation to these great Con∣cerns,
made Better and Improven, without a SCOIS PARLIA∣MENT.</P>
<P>AND, Seing the Articles of Union, now under the Considerati∣on
of the Honourable Estates of Parliament, It is agreed, That SCOT∣LAND
and <HI>England</HI> shall be United into one Kingdom; And that
the united Kingdoms be united by one and the Same Parliament; By
which Our MONARCHY is Supprest, Our PARLIAMENTS Extin∣guished

Wherein, the Mean Representation allowed for SCOT∣LAND,
can never Signisie in Securing to us the INTEREST Reser∣ved
by us, or granted to us by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>And by these <HI>Articles,</HI> Our Poor PEOPLE are made liable to the
<HI>English</HI> Laxes, which is a certain unsupporrable Burden; Conside∣ring,
That the Trade Proposed is Uncertain, Involved, and wholly
<PB N="9" REF="621"/>
Precarious: Especially: when Regulate as to Export and Import by
the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and under the same Prohibitions and Restricti∣ons
ons, Customs, and Duties. And considering, That the most consi∣derable
Branches of Our TRADE, are differing from those of <HI>England,</HI>
and are, and may be yet more Discouraged by their Laws; And
that all the Concerts of TRADE, and OUR INTEREST, are, after
the Union, Subject to such Alterations, as the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
shall think fit.</P>
<Q>We therefore Supplicate your Grace and the Honourable Estates
of Parliament; and do assuredly Expect, that ye will not con∣clued
such an Incorporate Union, as is contained in the Articles
Proposed; But that ye will Support and Maintain the TRUE

Pray, that effectual Means may be used for Defeating the De∣signs

to the Variety of Addresses, given in to the present Parliament by
all Ranks, from almost all Corners of this Nation, against the said
Union: Only We must say and profess, That the Commissioners
for this Nation, have been either Simple, Ignorant, or Treacherous

<P>We acknowledge it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Power of the present Parliament, to

<P>But if the Subscribers of the foresaid Treaty and Union, with
their Associats in Parliament, shall presume to carry on the said Uni∣on,

the Generality of the same, can only Divest them of their Sacred and
Civil Libertys, Purchased and Maintained by our ANCESTORS with
their Blood: So we protest, whatever Ratification of the foresaid
Union may pass in Parliament, contrai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to our Fundamental Laws,
Liberties, and Privileges, concerning Church and State, may not be
binding upon the Nation, now or at any Time to come: And par∣ticulary
we protest against the Approbation of the first Article of
the said Union, before the Privileges of this Nation, contain'd in
the other Articles had been acjusted and secured: And so we ear∣nestly
Require, that the Representatives in Parliament, who are for
Our Nation's Privileges, would give timeous Warning to all the
Corners of the Kingdom; That we and our Posterity become not
Tributary and Bend-slave to our Neighbour, without acquiring
our selves, as becomes Men and Christians: And we are Consident,

<ITEM>IV. That in Case the proposed Union be Concluded, the Church
will suffer Prejudice, unless there be a Gommission for Plantation of
<PB N="14" REF="626"/>
Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, and making op the Registen of that
Court which were Burnt, and a Judicatory in <HI>Scotland</HI> for Redressing
Grievances, and Judging Causes which formerly were Judged by the

and with which Judicature, the Church may correspond anent
Fasts and Thank sgivings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. Likewise we do humbly Represent, That in the Second Part

which every one in this Nation who may be Obliged to take

Wishart Moderator of the Commis∣sion
of the late General Assembly
of the Church Of SCOTLAND
Against the Representation and Petition.</HEAD>
<P>AT <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the twelfth Day of <HI>November,</HI> One Thousand Se∣ven
Hundred and six Years; By the underSubscribing Noble∣men
and Gentlemen, Elders in the said Commission, Reasons for
Dissent Entered, and protestation taken by them upon the 7th Day of
the said Moneth, in the Meeting of the Commission against an Ad∣dress
proposed to be made by the Commission upon the Grounds
Contained in six Articles to the High Court of Parliament;
Which Articles were by several Members of the Commission urged to
be put to the Vote for Approbation in the Form and Terms follow∣ing.</P>
<Q>The Articles are as follows.</Q>
<P>1. That the Sacramental Test being the Condition of Accrss to
Places of Trust, and to Benefites from the Crown, All of our Com∣munion
must be Debarred from the same, if not in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet through
the Rest of the Dominion of <HI>Britain,</HI> which may prove of most
dangerous consequence to this Church.</P>
<P>2. That this church and Nation may be Exposed to the further dan∣ger
of new Oaths from the Parliament of Britain, unless it be provi∣ded
that no Oath, Bond or Test of any Kind, shall be required of
any Minister or Member of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whirch incon∣sistent
with the known Principles of this Church.</P>
<P>3. There being no Provision in the Treaty of Union for Securing
of this Church by the Coronation Oath, That therefore in the Coro∣nation
Oath to be taken by the Sovereigns of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> they be
Engaged to Maintain the Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Go∣vernment
of this Church, and the Rights and Privileges thereof, as
now by Law Established.</P>
<P>4. That in Case the Proposed Union be Concluded, the Church
will suffer Prejudice, unless there be a Commission for Plantation
ot Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, and making up the Registers of
that Court which were Burnt; And a Judicatory in Scotland for Re∣dressing
Grievances, and judging Causes, which formerly were jud∣ged
by the Privy Council, such as the Growth of Popery, and other
<PB N="16" REF="628"/>
Irregularities: And, with which judicatorie the Church may Corre∣spondanent
Fasts and Thanksgivings.</P>
<P>5. Likewise, We do humbly Represent: That in the second Part
of the Oath of Abjuration, in Favours of the Successor in the Prote∣stant
Line, there is Reference made to some Acts of the English Par∣liament,
which every One in this Nation who may be Obliged to
take the said Oath, may not so well Know, and therefore cannot
Swear with Judgment; As also, There seems to us some Qualifica∣tions
required in the Successor to the Crown, which are not suitable
to our Principles,</P>
<P>6. And in the last Place, in Case the proposed Treaty of Union
shall be concluded, this Nation will be subjected in its civil Inrerests
to a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, where in Twenty six Prelates are to be Consti∣tuent
Members and Legislatots, and lest our Silence should be constru∣cted
to Import Our Content to, or Approbation of the civil Places and
Power of Church Men; We crave Leave in all Humility and due
Respect to your Grace and Honourable Estates of Parliament to Repre∣sent.
That its contrary to Our Known Principles and Covenants, that
any Church-Man should bear civil Offices, or have Power in the Com∣mon
Wealth.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Against which Articles and Address
Proposed, the saids Elders did before
the Vote protest, and take Instru∣ments
in the Hands of the Clerk of
the Commission;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">For the Reajbnsfbllorpiffg</HEAD>
<P>1. The Commission of the General <HI>Assembly</HI> having already
Addrest to the Parliament for Securing the Doctrine, Worship, Dis∣cipline
and Government of this Church; And that Address being
read in the House upon the 17th of <HI>October</HI> last, The Parliament
did thereupon Declare, that before concluding the Union, they
would take the said Address to their Consideration, and would do
every Thing necessary for securing the true Protestant Religion and
Church Government presently by Law established in this Kingdom;
Which Assurance we conceive the Commission may very well rely u∣pon,
Seeing it is not to be doubted, that the Parliament will in due
Time, when the Address is taken to Consederation, make all necessa∣ry
Provisions for Securing our Religion and Church Government by
Law established; And it maybe constructed Jealousic or Dissidence
in this Commission to press and pursue the said Address further, be∣fore
<PB N="17" REF="629"/>
it appear what Steps and Progress the Parliament shall make u∣pon
it, Especially seeing there are so many Elders of this Commission
who are Members of the House: And being heartily Concerned for
the Churches Inrerest, will certainly take Care that Nothing be Om∣mitted
or forgot to be Represented in Parliament which is Necessary
for the Churches Security.</P>
<P>2. The Parliament having upon the 15th of <HI>October</HI> last, Voted to
proceed presently to the Consideration of the Articles of the Treaty
of Union, which might be Known to all by the published Minutes,
We conceive if not Decent or suitable to the Prudence of this Com∣mission
to present an new Address Relating to the Subject of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣mmer
whereby the House may be impeded in its Procedure, which
may cause a longer Delay of Considering the first Address by Occasio∣ning
new Questions and Debates in the House.</P>
<P>3. The 6th Article of the now intended Address, contains Matters
which we conceive are not within the Sphere and Compass of the
Commissions Business prescribed to them by the <HI>General Assembly.</HI> Yet
a wide Step is made in quarrelling and Objecting to the Constitution
of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> the Representative of that Nation, with
which this is now in a Treaty about an Union, likeways in that Ar∣ticle
she Form and Frame of the Civil Policy and Government of
<HI>England,</HI> in the Extent and Latitude of it, Agreeable to it's laws is
Reflected upon and Challenged; all which in our Opinion, In∣sinuates
a Blaming and Condemning our Parliament for Treating of in
Union with a Kingdom so Circumstantiated is <HI>England</HI> is.</P>
<P>4. Whatever the Constitution of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> now
is, and whatever may be the Constitution or the Parliament of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> after the Union, the present legal Establishment of our
Church is not alterable by it, that being without the bounds of the
Treaty, which can reach no farther than the Civil Policy and Go∣vernment
of the United Kingdom; Besides that our legal Establish∣ment
will no doubt be further Fenced and Fortified, when the Com∣missions
Address is taken into Consideration by the Parliament.</P>
<P>5. The Parliament having upon the fourth of this Month, Voted
that the two Kingdoms of Scotland and <HI>England,</HI> shall upon the first
Day of <HI>May</HI> next <HI>Ensuing,</HI> and for ever after be United into one
Kingdom by the Name of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with this Provision (That
if the Articles of Union be not adjusted by the Parliament, then the
Agreeing to and Approving of the first shall be of no Effect) We Ap∣prebend
it may be of Dangerous Consequence to present now any
Address which may Admitt of a Constiustion opposite to that Vote
in Parliament; And certainly it would not be Excuseable in any
who are Members in the House, to concurr in an Address of that
sort.</P>
<P>So being folly perswaded that the way of proceeding by the
New Address now intended, will tend to the great Disadvantage and
Prejudice of the Church as now Estiblimed, and to the Presbyterian
Interest, we round our selves obliged to Enter our Dissent and to
Protest <HI>Sic Smbscribitur, Rothes, Marchmont, Polwarth, George
Baillie, Alexander Ogilvie, J. C. Auchinbrick, J. Campbell.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Commission of the General Assembly,
Reply to the Reasons given by the
Elders for their Protest, Entituled,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some Modest Ainimadversions by way of Re∣ply
to a Paper Intituled, Reasons &amp;c.
ut Supra.</HEAD>
<P>IT was great Grief to the Commission, when it pleased some of
our Honourable Friends of the Ruling Elders to protest against
the Vote, Whether the 6th Article of the Commissions second
Address Should be added to the other Articles formerly Agreed to;
and it doth add no little to our Grief, that a Paper is given in with
Reasons as against the whole Address; Where as they may Remem∣ber
the first three of the Articles of the said Adress were unanimously
Agreed unto before.</P>
<P>We do sincerly profess, We h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve such a Sense of, and Confidence
in the Kindness of these Noble and Honourable Persons to this Church,
that it Afflicts us, when in any thing we cannot comply with their
Opinion; But we hope they will Excuse us when purely our Consci∣ence
towards God, maketh us Differ.</P>
<P>We Heartily Wish this debate Sopite, and that yet it would please
them to take up this Paper, perhaps on more Mature and second
Thoughts, they may see there is no Ground to be so severe against
our second Address, As to Censure it as jealonsie or Diffidence of
the Parliament or our Friends in it, as in the first Reasons; and of
Indecency and Unsuitable to Prudence, as Reason second, or Dan∣gerous
and such as may be construed, as contrary to a Vote of <HI>Parlia∣ment
November</HI> 4th as in Reason 5th. For the first Address being
General, the second was but a humble Representation or some par∣ticulars
we humbly desired might be minded, when it pleased the Par∣liament
to resume the Consideraiion of the first Address, leaving the
time to the Wisdom of the Parliament, we being far from any design
to occasion Del y or D bate; and it hath pleased the Parliament to in∣sert
diverse of the Things there desired in the Act for the <HI>Security of the
Church,</HI> and we would gladly hope they will consider the rest of them
in due time.</P>
<P>But we conceive it is the 6th Article agsinst which the chief Offence
is taken, and against which the 3d and 4th Reasons are levelled, but
our Honourable Friends know, there had been much Reasoning on
that Head for diverse days, and when there was no appearance of
Unantmity, how could the Commission shun a Vote for Decision
of the Difference, nor can we be perswaded that the Commission went
in their Vote without the Sphere and Compass of the Business pre∣scribed
to them by the Genera] Assembly, or made a wide Step in
quarrelling and objecting to the Constitution of the Parliament of
<HI>England,</HI> as is alledged in Reason 3d- For it was oft told in the Con∣ference
<PB N="19" REF="631"/>
ference and Debate, we did not meddle with the Constitution of the
Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> as the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> though we can∣not
command our Judgment to an Approbation of it; nor do we
speak any thing against treating with the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> as
the Representative of that Nation, nor doth it blame our Pa liament
for treating with them, for they treat with the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI>
as the Representative of the Nation; Which as theirs is in its Frame
established by the Laws of the Land, yet a Regulation thereof is treat∣ed
so for constituting the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, why then should there
be so much Offence taken, that in due Season before the Conclusion
of the Treaty, it is humbly represented to the Parliament, that in
case the proposed Treaty of Union be concluded, this Nation will be
Subjected in its civil Interests to a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, wherein 26 Pre∣lates
are to be constituent Members and Legislators.</P>
<P>We do not speak in that <HI>6th</HI> Article of the legal Establishment of
our Church, and so the 4<HI>th</HI> Reason toucheth not this Point.</P>
<P>And could any thing be more modestly exprest than this is by the
Commission in their Address, in these Words.</P>
<P>And lest our Silence should be constructed to import our Consent
to, or Approbation of the civil Places and Power of Church-men,
we crave leave in all humility and due Respect to your Grace and ho∣nourable
Estates of Parliament, to represent that it is contrary to our
known Principles and Covenants, that any Church Man should bear
civil Offices, or have power in the Common-Wealth.</P>
<P>Nor can we see how this Address doth of its own Nature tend to
the Disadvantage of the established Church and Presbyterian Interest.
<HI>But as we have Charity towards them,</HI> we expect the same Charity
towards us, acting purely from Conscience towards GOD, and we in∣treat
and expect the continuance of their Kindness to this Church.</P>

we are Alarm'd, with the present Scheme of Union in the Printed Ar∣ticles,
as apprehending the Fatal Consequences thereof, in the Event

which we can not go in, without Guilt before GOD, in a manifest
Breach of our Solemn Covenants, by which we are Ingaged, against
Ecclesiastical Persons being Legislators in the Common Wealth. (The
Setting up of publick Mass, and <HI>English</HI> Ceremonies, The Illegal and
Disorderly Practices of the Episcopal Clergy, from the Hopes of a
Popish Successor to the Crown, without any effectual Redress from
the Government, notwithstanding of repeated Aplication made by

of such an Union to their Liberties both Civil and Religious,

Pray, and upon whose Royal Assurances in Behalf of this Church,
we do most cheerfully rely) that the Protestant Succession to the So∣vereign

<OPENER>R. D. B.</OPENER>
<P>YOur Letter signed by the R. Mr. <HI>Carstairs</HI> Moderator <HI>pro tom Pore</HI>
we received this Day, being our first Meeting after its Date of
the 6th Instant; wherein there is mention of your being informed of
Disorders and Tumults in some parts of the Countrey, which you
recommend unto us to discountenance and discourage as we have
Access.</P>
<P>We know there have been many Reports spread Abroad of Tu∣mults
and Disorders, not only in <HI>Glasgow,</HI> which is too true, but in
other place within the Shire of <HI>Lanerk;</HI> which as to the bounds of our
Presbytery are grosly false: And we have reason to believe them to
be so likewise, as to the rest of the Shire. We have heard also of
some calumnious Stories industriously disseminated, concerning some
of our Number, with respect to these pretended Disorders, which
are not only contrary to Truth, but to common Sense. We wish the
Forgers and Spreaders may be forgiven. They act in this neither the
part of good Christains, nor of good Subjects.</P>
<P>As to the Disposition of the People, the plain Truth is, That they
are generally most averse from the Union; and many have expressed
themselves broadly enough against it, as what they fear may prove
an irremediable Evil, if it should be concluded, wishing that some
Stop might be put to it. And we have not been wanting, as there was
occasion, to advise and exhort the People to Calmness and Regularity.
and to resrain from any undue Keenness might be in their Words. But
we must say, That it is utterly false and malicious to suggest, that there
hath been the least Tumult or irregular Practice among them, since this
Union came in Question, far less any shadow or Appearance of any
Undutiful or Disloyal Thought of Her Majesty, Yea there has not
been so much as the least Motion towards their accustomed ordinary
Rendezv us warranted by Law, since the publishing of Proclamation
and Act, forbidding the same: It is true, That some of those Rash
Youths who broke out from <HI>Glasgow,</HI> passed thro' our Bounds, but
they were not allowed to make any stay, nor received the least En∣couragement
at any Hand, for ought we know: So that we can
well assure the R. Commission, there is as much Peace and Quiet with∣in
the whole Bounds of this Presbytery, as is any Place of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>We have heard with much Satisfaction, of the Zeal which the R.
<PB N="27" REF="639"/>
Commission hath shewed by their Addreses mentioned in your Letter)
For the Interests of the Church at this Time, when they are in so E∣minent
Hazard. And we have restified our Concurrence therewith by
Our Address to the Parliament: But we are still of Opinion, That
the pressing Necessity of the present Juncture, and the mani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Im∣possibility
(in the Event of such an Union, as is Moulded in the
Treaty) of securing this Church in any of Her precious Concerns,
now Established by the Laws and Constitution of our own Govern∣ment
and Kingdom, doth not only require the Continuance of Assi∣dous
Application to the Right Honourable Estates of Parliament:

<HEAD TYPE="sub">MEMORANDUM
For the Honourable Estates of Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>PRimo, It is humbly intreated, That in case the Union be con∣cluded,
that for preserving the Peace of the Nation and Re∣dressing
of Grievances of the Church, the Privy Council may be
continued, or some Court Established for judging in such Cases as
were formerly judged by the Council, and this Church may corres∣pond
with them or Fasts and Thank sgivings. <HI>Secundo,</HI> The Interests
of diverse Heretors, as well as the Exigents of the Church will require,
that there be tome fixed Court to do the Work of the Commision for
Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, which is the more ne∣cessary,
in respect of the great prejudice the Church has sustained for
want thereof, and that this Court be impowered to make up the Re∣gisters
of the Commissions of former Parliaments that were burnt in
the great Fire in <HI>Edinburgh. Tertio,</HI> Seeing the Terns of an Oath
should be clear, that it may be taken in Truth, in Righteousness and
Judgment; It is desired, That it the <HI>English</HI> Abjuration Oath be re∣quired
of <HI>Scots-Man,</HI> the Words may be made lain and clear with.
out reference to <HI>English</HI> Statutes, which are not known here, and that
what the Taker of the said Oath is to be obliged to, be expresly insert
in the said Oath, and that the same be agreeable to our known Prin∣ciples.
<HI>Quarto,</HI> Seeing upon the event of an Union there ought
to be a Commuicarion of all Privileges and Advantages which do or
may belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom: It is intreated That due
Provision be made that in case of any Union <HI>Scots.</HI> Men may be capa∣ble
of places of Power and Trust in all places of <HI>Britain,</HI> without any
Obligation to take the <HI>Eiglish Sacramental</HI> TEST; for that, besides what
may be said of the Danger that way to prophane that Holy Ordi∣nance,
it may prove a Temptation to divers to conform, who other∣wavs
would not do it, and this way by degrees bring in Corruption
to this Church. <HI>Quinto,</HI> Seeing the Eccesiastical Supremacy claimed
some time by the Sovereigns in this Land, was such an Encroachment
on the Prerogative of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, the alone Head
and King of His Church, and had such sad Consequences, and is
now so happily rescinded; It is humbly instreated, that all possible
Security be provided against the reassuming of it in after time.</P>

Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland.</HEAD>
<OPENER>May it please jour Grace.</OPENER>
<P>I Could not have Peace in my own Mind Night or Day, until I
made this Discovery of a Plot, so clossly laid against jour Grace,
that the World could not have discovered, unlest it had pleased God
thus to touch my Conscience, or some othars of the Conspirators;
Wherefore I shall give your Grace a short Account of the true Matter
of Fact without the least Dissembling. Upon <HI>Thursday</HI> last at 12
a Clock at Night, there came a Gentleman to my House, who whis∣per'd
in mine Ear while I was in Bed, to go along with him in all
haste, so I got up out of Bed and went with him, he led me into a
Chamber, where I met Seven other young Men, who welcom'd me
to the place, and after a little Talk, told me they were upon a Bu∣siness
which they could not effect without me, which was to dispatch
that Treacherous Devil the Commissioner (so they were pleased to
call your Grace) I, God forgive me, joyned with them heartily,
whereupon they produced a Paper, containing a most horrid Oath,
<PB N="60" REF="676"/>
whereby they bound themselves to Assassinate your Grace the first
day the Parliament sat after New years day, and that they should ra∣ther
be burned alive than discover their Fellows—Two and
Twenty has subscribed this Oath with their Bipod.</P>
<P>They said they wanted only Two to compleat their Number for the
Work, they desiring to have Twenty Four concerned in it, some of
these your Grace would little surpect, but these that art to be the
main Actors, are the most graceless debauch'd Wretches in the
World, that fear neither God nor Man, some of them are to be
cloathed in the Highland Dress, one in the Habit of a Beggar with
a false Beard, six of them are to be in the Habit of Baxters, that by
this means they may with the more case raise the Rabble, one of those
in Highland Dress is to stand on your left band as you come out of
the Parliament-House, with a naked Durk beneath his Plaid to stab
your Grace; But if he has no Opportunity for Action, then the Beg∣gar
it to attend your Coach with a Pistol beneath his Rags, which
Jie is to fire at your Grace, at which the Baxters are to raife the
Rabble with their Grys, which they think will soon be done; Then
left your Grace should escape with Life, they are to take Care to get
the Nether-Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Port closed inspight of the Guards: Their next de∣sign
is upon the Ghancellor, P<HI>hilipbuugh,</HI> and some others; After
repeated Oaths of Secrecie we parted about 3 a clock this Morning,
and I came home, but perplexing Thoughts so Tormented me, that
I could neither Sleep, Eat or Drink till I eased my Mind with this Dis∣covery.
If your Grace will assure me of Pardon, and that you will
obtain me a Remission from the Queen for this and an other Crime,
which the Conspirators will alledge for revenge I was guilty often
Tears ago abroad, I will come to your Graces Lodging and make a
full Discovery of this whole Design, and let your Grace see their
Names written with their own Hands, and with their own Blood, for
they put so much Trust in me, as that they gave it me in keeping;
Your Grace may take your own Method in making It known, if you
will pardon me and protest me; which if your Grace do, I shall not
fail to perform my Promise, and tell your Grace other Circumstances
than can recite here.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, may it please your Grace,
Dee. 20. 6 at Night 1706.
Tour Graces Humble Servant
There were several other Letters, some to Bully and Insult
the Commissioner, some pretending to Caution him, but his
Grace took no notice of any of them, nor did he ever omit
going to the Parliament-house, or pursue the Affair then in
Hand, notwithstanding these Insults.</CLOSER>

<P>I <HI>George Lockhart</HI> of <HI>Carnwath</HI> do protest for my self, and in Name of
such other Barons as shall adhere to this my Protestation; That nei∣ther
this Vote, nor any other Vote, Conclusion or Article in this
Treaty of Union, shall prejudge the Barons of this Kingdom from their
full Representation in Parliament, as now by Law established, nor any
of their Privileges, and particularly their Judicative and Legislative
Capacities, of which they are deprived by the Terms of this Treaty of
Union: And I crave this my Protestation to be Admitted and Record∣ed.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">And another Protest was given in by the Duke of Athole, in
these Terms.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas, by my Protest given in the 4th. of <HI>November</HI> last, before
voting the first Article of Union, I did reserve Liberty to renew
Protestations against any other Article of the Treaty: And as I prote∣sted
for the Reasons therein mentioned, so I do now, for my self and all
others who shall adhere, protest against any Vote for approving the <HI>22d.</HI>
Article of this Treaty of Union, and against all the Parts of it, for these
Reasons, Because the Peers of this Realm, who are hereditary Members
of Her Majesties Great Council and Parliament, do thereby become E∣lective,
and so Her Majesty is deprived of Her born Counsellors, and the
Peers of their Birth-right. And whereas they are at present 160 in Number,
they are by this Article, reduced to 16; which 16 are to be joyned with
the House of Lords in <HI>England,</HI> whose Number at present consists of a∣bove
180, whereby it is plain, that the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers share in the Legisla∣tive
and Judicative Powers in the <HI>British P</HI> arliament is very unequal with
that of the <HI>English,</HI> tho the one be Representatives of as Free and Inde∣pendent
a Nation as the other; and is therefore a plain Forfeiture of the
Peerage of this Kingdom. And as it is the hight of Injustice, and against
all the Laws and Practices of this and all other well govern'd Nations to
forfeit any Person without a hainous Crime; So its against all Law to
forfeit either the Peers that are now present, or those that are Minors or
Absent, without being so much as called or cited for that end.</P>
<P>It is likewise contrary to the Honour and true Interest of Her Majesty
and the Monarchy, to suppress the Estate of Peers, who have formerly
been the great Supporters of the Monarchy.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="683"/>
And it is Dishonourable and Disgraceful to this Kingdom, that the
Peers thereof shall only have Rank and Precedency next after the Peers of
the like Order and Degree in <HI>England,</HI> without regard to their Antiquity,
or the Dates of their Patents, as is stipulate by the following Articles of
this Treaty.</P>
<P>In the next place, each Shire and Royal Burgh within this Kingdom
have the Number of their Representatives determined by Acts of Parlia∣ment,
whose Number at present being 155, are by this Article of the
Treaty, reduced to 45, and to be joyned to 513 Members in the House of
Commons, where they can have no Influence, by reason of the vast Dis∣proportion
of their Numbers, besides, that the Barons and Burrows of
this Nation, by this way of Uniting, are deprived of their inherent
Right of being fully and individually represented in Parliament, both
with relation to their legislative and judicative Capacities.</P>
<P>And they are not only highly prejudged in lessening their Representa∣tion,
but also degraded from being Members of the Parliaments of this
Kingdom, where they sit as Judges in all Causes Civil and Criminal, to
be joyned to the Commons of another Nation, who are accustomed to sup∣plicate
for Justice at the Bar of the House of Lords.</P>
<P>The Barons and Burgesses are also further prejudged in this; That
whereas every shire and Royal Burgh have their own Representatives,
one Commissioner will hereafter represent several Shires or Burghs, who
it cannot be supposed will understand the several Interests and Concerns of
the said several Shires and Burghs whom he may represent.</P>
<P>And further, for the present Representatives of the Barons and Bur∣gesses
to offer, by any Vote or Deed of theirs, to incapacitate their
Constituents, or deprive them of any part of their inherent Right, is
what their Constituents may and do justly dissallow, they only having
their Commissions with the ordinary Powers of making and amending
Laws, and giving Suplys, but no ways to alter Fundamental Constitu∣tions,
or to take away or diminish their Representation, which is also a
plain Forfeiture of their Constituents of their inherent Rights and undoubt∣ed
Privileges, and is contrary to the fundamental Laws of this Nation,
which are the Birth-right of the People thereof.</P>
<P>From all which it is plain and evident, That this, from a Sovereign In∣dependent
Monarchy, shall dissolve its Constitution, and be at the dispo∣sal
of <HI>England,</HI> whose Constitution is not in the least to be altered by this
Treaty, and where it is not to be supposed the <HI>Scots</HI> shall have any weight
in the making of Laws, even tho' relative to their own Kingdom, by rea∣son
of the vast Disproportion and Disparity of the Representation afore∣said.</P>
<P>And therefore I do also Protest, that no Vote may hinder or prejudge
the Noblemen, Barons and Burgesses, as now represented in Parliament,
to Retain, Bruik, Enjoy and Exerce all their Rights, Liberties and Privi∣leges,
as fully and freely as hitherto they have enjoyed them.</P>
<P>And since it evidently appears, not only from the many Protests of the
Honourable and Worthy Members of this House, but also from the Multi∣tudes
of Addresses and Petitions, from the several Parts of this Kingdom,
of the Barons, Free-holders, Heretors, Burgesses and Commons, and
from the Commission of the General Assembly, that there is a general
Dislike and Aversion from the Incorporating Union, as contained in these
Articles; And that there is not one Address, from any part of the King∣dom,
in favours of this Union.</P>
<P>I do therefore further protest against concluding this and the following
<PB N="72" REF="684"/>
Articles of this Treaty, until Her Majesty shall be fully informed of the In∣clinations
of the People; That if Her Majesty think fit, She may call a new
Parliament to have immediate Sentiments of the Union since the Articles
have been made publick, where it's hoped they may fall on such Methods
as may allay the Ferment of the Nation, satisfie the Minds of the People,
and create a full Understanding betwixt the two Kingdoms, by an Union
upon honourable, just and equal Terms, which may unite them in Affecti∣on
and Interest, the surest Foundation of Peace and Tranquility for both
Kingdoms: And this my Protestation I desire may be received, and insert
in the Minutes, and recorded in the Books of Parliament, as a Testimony
of my Disassent, and the Disassent of such as adhere to me.</P>

<P>FOr as much as, the changing of the Right of the Peers of this Realm,
from a constant and hereditary Right, to one that is elective; and
the debarring all or any of them from taking place, and voting in Par∣liaments,
Conventions, or publick Councils, is subversive of the Birthsright,
and undoubted Privilege of the Peers, dishonourable to the whole
Kingdom, and contrary to the fundamental Laws and Constitutions of it;
as well as to all Justice and Equity: I do therefore Protest for my self,
and in Name of all who shall adhere to this my Protestation, that the
foresaid Right of the Peers of this Realm to Sit and Vote in all Parlia∣ments,
publick Councils and Conventions, do, after the intended Uni∣on
with <HI>England,</HI> and notwithstanding thereof, continue in full Force,
and remain to them as their undoubted Right and Property, and that no

<HEAD>Dissentient to the 22d. Resolution.</HEAD>
<P>Because we humbly conceive in the first place, that the
Number of 16 Peers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is too great a Proportion to be
added to the Peers of <HI>England,</HI> who very rarely consists of more

humbly of Opinion, that the Peers of <HI>England</HI> who sit here by
Creation from the Crown, and have a Right of so doing in

to the Officers of Her Majesties Customs) upon which we had good
ground to rest secure, yet to our great Surprize, we have Information,
that not only our Ships and Goods are seized, but the Goods themselves
made havock of and imbezzel'd (expresly contrair to the Articles of Uni∣on)
our Seamen Imprest, and our Ships thereby rendered useless, which
Treatment is so unsupportable, that all these promised Advantages by

besore the Union, for which they not only paid Your Majestics Du∣ty;
But being resolved upon the Faith of the faid Treaty to send them
to <HI>England,</HI> after due Deliberation, they by Warrant from <HI>England</HI> re∣ceived
Coast-Cocquets and other ordinary Documents from Your Majesys
Commissioners of the Customs lately established, and did also to cut off
all pretext, make faith before the Lords of Your Majesties Treasury and
Exchequer, and other Judges, That the Goods were imported upon their
own proper Account, and upon their own proper Risque.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding whereof, they have very furprising Accounts from
their Correspondents in <HI>England,</HI> that the Commissioners of Your Maje∣fties
Customs there, have given Orders to seize their Ships and Goods,
and that fome of them are actually fized, and others both seizd and
imbezzelled, and that the best Conditions they can obtain from Your Maje∣fties
faid Commissioners in <HI>England,</HI> are; That they should give Se∣curity
or Bail in some cases for Ship and Cargo, and in other Cases,
for paying new and high Duties, at the Determination of the <HI>British</HI> Par∣liament:
All which being in our humble Apprehension nothing agree∣able,
but contrary to the Faith of the faid Articles of Treaty, and a ma∣nisest
Disappointment of these Advantages and Encouragements that we
still did, and do firmly promise our selves from Your Majesties Royal
Justice and most gracious Government, and with all such visible Hard∣ships
as must be the Loss and even the Ruin of many honest Traders,
who cannot bear their Ships and Goods to be thus incumbred by Bail and
Law-suits, or double and high Duties, and withal subjected to the Delay
and Hazard of uncertain Determination.</P>

with a yet greater Confidence of Your Majesties Royal Justice and Good∣nets,

before Your Majesty as it is, <HI>viz.</HI> That by the first Article of the Treaty
of Union, the two Kingdoms are for ever united into one after the first
of May last, which plainly after that day exclude the very Notion of
Importation, or Importers betwixt them, and all former Restrictions and
penalties imposed thereupon: And by the Fourth Article, It is agreed
that all the Subjects of the faid united Kingdom shall from and after the
Union, have full Freedom and Intercourse of Trade to and from any Port
or Place within the faid united Kingdom, and that there be a Communi∣cation
of all other Rights and Privileges which do or may belong to the
Subjects of father Kingdom; By which it is plain, that we have the same
Privilege to transport our Effects not with standing of former Restramts
from one part of <HI>Britain</HI> to another, which Your Majesties Subjects of
<HI>Berwick, Newcastle, Bristol, Sec.</HI> do injoy in importing now to <HI>Scotland,</HI>
without any Comptrol all such Goods both of <HI>English</HI> and Foreign Manu∣facbure
and Growth, as were before the Union expresly prohibite by our
Laws: And farther, by the 25 and last Article of the faid Treaty, It is
by <HI>Statute Enacted,</HI> that all Laws and Statutes in either Kingdom, so
far as they are contrary to, and inconsistent with the Articles of the U∣nion,
shall from and after the Union cease and become void; Whereby
it evidently appears, that the Prohibitions and Restriaions that might
have been of Force on either side, while we were separate Kingdoms, are
now made void and for ever to cease.</P>
<P>Being then foundod upon such clear and evident Grounds, and yet
much more upon the assuring Experiences that we have always had of
<PB N="78" REF="690"/>
Your Majesties Justice, Equity, and unparallel'd Goodness: We do with

You would be pleased to give such Orders to Your High Treasurer and
Commissioners of Customs, and others in <HI>England,</HI> that the aforesaid hea∣vy

<HEAD>The Humble ADDRESS of the Scots Merchants at London,
to the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Tem∣poral
Assembled in Parliament, against Passing the Bill,
for laying Duties upon Goods which may be brought
by Her Majesties Subjects, from Scotland to England af∣ter
the Commencement of the UNION.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Articles of UNION most solemnly ratisied in <HI>Scotland and En∣gland,</HI>
It is expresly declar'd, That from and after the first of <HI>May</HI>
1707, the two Kingdoms shall be United into one, called <HI>Great∣Britain,</HI>
and that all the Subjects of either Kingdom, shall have full Free∣dom
and Intercourse of Trade and Navigation, to and from any Port or
Place within the said united Kingdom; and that there shall be a Communi∣cation
of all other Rights, Privileges and Advantages, which do or may
belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom:</P>
<P>It is humbly conceived, that the Bill now before your Lordships, is direct∣ly
contrary to these Articles of Union; for nothing can be a greater hin∣derance
to the Freedom and Intercourse of Trade, than the laying such high
Duties on Goods brought from <HI>Scotland to England,</HI> as are by this Bill in∣tended
to be impos'd on Her Majesty's <HI>English</HI> Subjects, and the <HI>Scots</HI> re∣slding
here, whereby they are deprived of their just Right of bringing Goods
From <HI>Scotland to England</HI> by <HI>Transire</HI> Duty free, which is plainly granted
to them by the fourth Article of Union, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Exception in this Bill pretended to be in favour of the Natives of
<HI>Scotland</HI> residing there, destroys their Privileges also, because it only al∣lows
them to bring such Goods Duty free into <HI>England</HI> after the Union com∣mences,
as have been before that time laden beyond Seas, and imported
into <HI>Scotland</HI> on their own Accounts, but not to bring any such as they
have bought, or may buy at their own Markets, where by this Retrospect
Bill will stop the Circalation of Trade, and entail Ruin on all the Tra∣ders
<PB N="80" REF="692"/>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by confining such Quantities os Goods to that part of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> as will exceed the Consumption thereos.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> being also hider'd by this Bill from bringing Duty free unto
<HI>England,</HI> any Goods Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> before the first of <HI>May,</HI> where∣of
they have not been the sble Proprietors, from the time they were first
Shipp'd off beyond Seas for <HI>Scotland,</HI> until brought into <HI>England;</HI> they
will be prevented from bringing their own Parts of any Goods, wherem
the <HI>English</HI> and any share at the time of Importation into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>And a particular Hardship to the <HI>Scots,</HI> the Bill imposes on them the
unsupportable <HI>onus probandi,</HI> whereby they will be oblig'd to prove their
sle Property from the time of buying the Goods beyond Seas, to their
Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> in order whereto their Factors, Mariners, Coopers,
Ware-house-keepers, Porters, and a great number of other Servants must
be all produced together at the Exchequer Bar, and all maintain'd during
their Voyages and Journeys, and Abode in <HI>London;</HI> so that the Evidence
necessary on this occasion will cost at least 300 <HI>I. Sterling;</HI> for each parcel
of Goods, besides all the Delay and Vexation of a tedicus Course <HI>Law,</HI>
and the severe Penalties in case they should, by one Neglect or Misior∣tune,
fail in the least Particular of an absolute Proof.</P>
<P>This Bill will not answer the propos'd End of advancing Her Majsties
Revenues, but seems to be founded on inistaken Notions of Trade, since
after the Union commences, the Disadvantages, or Conveniencies to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
will be equal, whether the Goods then in <HI>Scotland</HI> remain, and be
consum'd in that, or any other part of the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Allowances granted in some Articles of the Union, whereby the Re∣gulation
of minute Circumstances is left to the Parliament of <HI>Great∣Britain,</HI>
seems to be an unanswerable Argument, that where no such Li∣berty
is given, even the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> was not intended to
have the Power of making any Alterations or Regulations; and as the
last Article of the Union consirms the whole by repealing all Laws in
either Kingdom, which are contrary to the <HI>Articles,</HI> This Bill, if it
should past into an act, and all other Laws being inconsistent with the
<HI>Articles,</HI> or any of them, will as it's humbly conceived, be void after the
First of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>This Bill differs little from the former sent up to your Lord ships last.
Session, which your Lordships did not then think fit to <HI>pass.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Therefore it's hop'd that your Lordships will not pass this Bill, being,
as it bumbly conceiv'd more injurious than the former, and which
can only serve to advance Disinctions and Animosities between the
Subjects of</HI> Scotland and England, <HI>and prevent that Union of Hearts,
which Her Maiesty so graciously recommended from the Throne.</HI></P>
<P>⁂ “This Bill is unnecessary in reserence to Foreigners, who can have
no Benefit nor Share in the Communication of Trade and Privileges men∣tioned
in the 4th Article of Union, the same being there by prudently re∣stricted
to the Subjects of both Kingdoms.”</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">OBSERVATIONS UPON THE Fourth Article of UNION.</HEAD>
<P>1. EQuity and Reason places the Subjects of the same Kingdom on equal
Foot, when they are Cemented together in Affection, Laws,
Trade, and Interest, this will be the Case after the Union, when
Agreements on each fide are fulfilled; but when <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI>
were separate, they who submitted, proposed the Terms, and Equiva∣lents
of an Union; and when these are granted, and agreed, should be
honourably maintained, with the greatest Nicety, and favourable Inter∣pretation
to the Weakest. The Reputation of <HI>England</HI> abroad, is found∣ed
on the Stability of their Treaties, ss much as on the Strength of their
Arms, Treasure, or Constitution.</P>
<P>With the same Strength of Reason and Equity, may the <HI>Scots desire</HI>
that <HI>English</HI> Men, since <HI>February</HI> last, should be subject to the <HI>Onus Prolandi;</HI>
for Goods in their Possession, imported by Foreigners, or for Account of
Forcigners under Covert.</P>
<P>By the same Rule of Reasbn, that the <HI>English</HI> require an Augmentation
of Duties on Goods imported into <HI>England,</HI> may the <HI>Scots</HI> desire that
Goods in <HI>England</HI> should be Taxed with <HI>Scots</HI> Duties, and then both King∣doms
would be on equal Terms.</P>
<P>The Establishment of the Union, was a Communicatory Contract, a∣greed
and fixt, by Persons equal in Knowledge, and Freedom of Will;
the Matter in Debate was Proposed, Argued, and Covenanted, afterwards
Confirmed in the most Solemn and Authentick Manner, by the Parlia∣ments
of both Kingdoms, and cannot now legally, and in a decent or
friendly Manner, be touched or amended in any point, but by the Parli∣ament
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who are the competent Judges of the Rights, Pri∣vileges,
and Conveniencies of the United Kingdoms, when the general Good,
Satfety and Interest of the whole, will, with it's natural Weight, sway
the Ballance of Equity, when <HI>England</HI> will have no Reason to repine at
any accidental Advantage, which <HI>Scotland</HI> may get by the Union, at it's
Commencement, since it will not only enable, but encourage that Part of
the United Kingdom, to undergo with Chearsulnets their sure Restrictions,
and Taxes.</P>
<P>II, To the Second Reason the Answer is plainly obvious, that the Sixth,
Seventh, Fifteenth, and Eighteenth Articles of the Union, were consented
to by <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Consideration of an Equivalent, and the Sense of the
Commissioucrs, on the point of Cusoms, is more fully explained in the
Fourteenth Article of Union, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall not
'be charged with any Duties laid on by the Parliament of <HI>English before</HI>
'the Union, except these consented to in this Treaty.</P>
<P>Certainly the <HI>Scots</HI> never expected, that in the Interval between the
Rathfication of the Articles, and the Commencement of the Union,
the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would have laid the <HI>Omus Probandi</HI> upon the
<PB N="82" REF="694"/>
Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for a time so far backward, nor that a greater
Proof for the property of Goods, should be required from the Subjects of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> than what is stipulated for justisying their Interest in Shipping,
by the Fisth Article of Union, by which they are free from all perplex∣ing
Tryals at the Exchequer Barr, and are treated therein as Friends, and
Men of probity, by referring the Proof of their Interest, to their proper
Oath, to betaken in the Port next to the abode of the Owner; this shows
that the <HI>Scots</HI> never would have consented to undergo the <HI>Onus probandi</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI> for any Goods in their Possession, belonging to them, at or
before the Union.</P>
<P>It was absolutely impossible to attain this Union, without a free Com∣munication
of Trade; and in Consequence, as absolutely Impossible to
hinder the <HI>Scots</HI> from Trading, as <HI>Scots-men,</HI> in their own Kingdom, until
the Union commences; or from trading afterwards, as <HI>Britains,</HI> when
the Union takes place. To deny them the fist Privilege, is to take a∣way
their Birth-right; and to debar them from the latter Advantage,
would bea grievous Detriment, and a sensible Injury; because it touch∣es
their Property at present, and weakens their Hopes of Advantage in fu∣ture
by the Union: At least it will make them think their Title preca∣rious
and uncertain.</P>
<P>After the first of <HI>May</HI> 1707, when the Union is to commence, the Goods
then brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>vice versa</HI> can't in any Sense
be said to be either Exported or Imported; seeing, whether by Land or
Water, they will only be carried from one place to another, within the
same Kingdom: And there sore this Matter can no ways be comprehen∣ded
under the Sixth Article.</P>
<P>III. To the Third Reason; That the fair Traders of <HI>England</HI> will be
great Sufferers, &amp;c. It may be answer'd, That a certain sort fair Tra∣ders,
commonly distinguish'd by the Character of well-meaning F—s,
are greater Sufferers daily, by the cunning Contrivances of Stock-Jobbers,
and other over-reaching Practices in Commerce, they would not censure
a Man, who can take up Money at 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> from private Persons, and
at the same time can lend it to the Government at 8 <HI>per Cent.</HI> If by the
fair Traders; be meant the Wine Merchants or Vintners, those who know
their Method of Management, will admire how they have gain'd this
Character: Allowing it, however, to them for once, in Complaisance, their
Damage will be as soon forgot, as the Loss of a Ship is on the Exchange;
and their Lost will be recompensed by a publick Advantage, which hap
pens but once, and will be of very short Continuance. The Nobility and
Gentry of <HI>England</HI> may drink the Queens Health, and Prosperity to the
Union, in a Glass of Claret, at 25. 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Quart; on which the best of
the Nation saves 25. seeing the Vintner sells his mixt Liquor at 4 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI>
The <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant or Importer from <HI>Scotland</HI> cannot gain nor save by
his Sale, one fourth part of what the <HI>English</HI> Nation does; and the Pro∣portion
will hold the same, upon whatever Quantities of Goods are Im∣porton
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> if it were possible, to the value of a Million of Mo∣ney.
The Nation of <HI>England,</HI> in this Time of subilee, will be by sar the
greatest Gainer. If the sole profit redounds wholly to the <HI>Scots</HI> Mer∣chants,
or to the Importers from <HI>Scotland,</HI> then the Price of Goods will be
kept at their present Height, and the fair Traders of <HI>England</HI> cannot lose
by the Stocks of Goods now on their Hands.</P>
<P>IV. That the Revenue of the Customs will be very much diminished,
may be answered, That this is not a real loss, but accidental and ima∣ginary:
For without the Union and Freedom of Commerce, those Goods
<PB N="83" REF="695"/>
would not have been imported; and I am perswaded, the Queen would
rather lose the Value of the Goods imported, than suffer the Foundation
of the Union to be undermined, or Her Subjects in <HI>Scotland</HI> to undergo
Hardships, from which, in virtue of this Union, they may so reasonably
expect an Exemption. And I believe, all Her Majesties Friends, and
Well-wishers to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will cordially praise Her Sentiments, and
readily concur in susecting the Assertions of some Gentlemen, as to the
Quantities of Goods expected from <HI>Scotland.</HI> These very Persons would
not be afraid of finding Money, in a Days time, to purchase the whole
at prime Cost, and to put themselves in place of the <HI>Scots:</HI> Then they
would cry up the Union as sacred, as the firmest Foundation of our Con∣ftitution,
and would severely censure the least Encroachment.</P>
<P>V. To the Fifth and most important Reason, The Promoters
of the Bill are great Men in their way, but in Comparison with <HI>Great∣Britain,</HI>
like two Drops of Water to the Ocean; and in their greatest
Splendour are only valuable so far, as they are useshl to the Common
Good; it's humbly conceiv'd, every prudent Man will conclude, it's
better to let a few Men grumble, than to disgust a Kingdom, and the best
of Queens, by endangering the Constitution of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>

<P>“THat tho it would seem most proper for the <HI>Scots</HI> to sue to us, who are
Superiors in the Field, and Masters of a great part of their Realm;
yet that our charitable Mind and Brotherly Love might be known, We
do by all means possible provoke and call you to your own Commodity
and Profit, as the Father does the Son, or the Elder Brother the young∣er
—and invite you to AMITY and EQUALITY, because as We
inhabit in the same Island, there is no People so like one another in Man∣ners,
Customs and Language—But because some object that we
don't seek EQUALlTY, nor the Marriage, but a Conquest, and that we
would not be Friends but Lords, altho our Proclamation at the last
Wars did enough declare the contrary: yet here We declare to you and
all Christian People, to be the Kings Majesty's Mind our Master's, by
our Advice and Counsel, not to Conquer but to have in Amity, not to
win by Force, but to conciliate by Love, not to spoil and kill, but to
save and keep, not to dissever and divorce, but to joyn in Marriage
from high to low both the Realms, to make of one Isle, one Realm, in
Love, Amity, Concord, Peace and Charity—We offer Love, We
offer EQUALITY and Amity; We overcome in War and offer Peace;
<PB N="103" REF="715"/>
We win Holds and offer no Conquest We get in your Land, and affer
<HI>England</HI>—What can be more offered and more proffered, THAN IN∣TERCOURSE
OF MERCHANDIZES and interchange of Marriages, the
abolishing of all such our Laws as prohibit the same, or might be Impe∣diment
to the mutual Amity? We have offered not only to leave the
Authority, Name, Title, Right or Challenge of Conqueror, but to receive
that which is the Shame of Men overcome, to leave the Name of the
Nation, and the Glory of any Victory (if any we have had, or should
have of you) and to take the indifferent old Name <HI>Britains</HI> again; be∣cause
nothing should be left on our part to be offered, nothing on your part
unrefused, whereby ye might be inexcusable.—What Face hath this
of Conquest? We intend not to disherit your Queen, but to make Her
Heirs Inheritors also of <HI>England.</HI> WE SEEK NOT TO TAKE FROM
YOU YOUR LAWS NOR CUSTOMS, but we seek to redress your
Oppression, which of divers ye do sustain. In the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> de∣vers
Laws and Customs be according to the antient usage thereof, and
likewise <HI>France, Normandy</HI> and <HI>Gascoigne</HI> have sundry kind of Orders.
Have all the Realms and Dominions that the Emperor now hath, one
Custom and one Sort of Laws? These vain Fears and Fantasies of Ex∣pulsion
of your Nation, of changing of the Laws, of making a Con∣quest,
be driven into your Heads by those, who indeed had rather you
were all conquered, spoiled and of stain, than they would lose any Point
of their Will, of their Desire of Rule, and of their Estimation, which
they know in Quietness would be seen what it were, as it were in a
Calm Water—If we two being made one by Amity, be most able to
defend us agains all Nations; and having the Sea for the Wall, mutual
Love for Gariobn, and GOD for Defence, should make so Noble and
well agreeing Monarchy, that neither in Peace we may be ashamed, nor
in War afraid of any Worldly or Foreign Power: Why should not you
be as desireous of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e same, and have as much Cause to rejoyce at it as
we?—And for a more sure Proof and plainer Token of the good
Mind and Will which we bear unto you, that which never yet was
granted to <HI>Scotland</HI> in any League, Truce or Peace betwixt <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Scotland;</HI> because ye shall have Proof of the beginning of Love
and Amity of both the Realms, the King's Highness considering the mul∣titude
of them which are come to His Majesty's Devotion, and of them

Advice and Counsel granted, and by these presents doth grant, that

enter their Names with one of the Wardens of the Marches, and there
profess to take part with us, in this before named godly purpose, may

buy and sell, bring in the Commodities of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and take and carry

the same and none other Customs therefore, than <HI>Englismen,</HI> and the

<P>THE Commissioners being met at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the chief Things debat∣ed
on were, 1. Whether the two Kingdoms should be united un∣der
the Name of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> And 2. Whether both Nations
should be equally capable of Honours and Offices in either Kingdom.
Some advanc'd against the First, That it was without all Example, that
two Kingdoms equally supreme, should lay aside their former Names for
a third new One: Nor could the Name of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> be so Honour∣able
as the several Names and Pluralities of Kingdoms: Thus tho <HI>Castile,
Leon</HI> and <HI>Arragon,</HI> be united under the Subjection of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
and <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navarr</HI> under the <HI>French;</HI> yet these Kings alwise in their
Designations mention the several Kingdoms they command.</P>
<P>Others alledg'd this might prejudice the Precedency of the Kings of
<HI>England</HI> among other Princes; as being but a new one. But for all that,
we find in History, that this is no new thing; and in particular <HI>Livy</HI> reports,
That the <HI>Trojans</HI> and <HI>Aborigines</HI> did after the Union of their Nations ass∣umne
the common Name of <HI>Latines:</HI> Thus the <HI>Hungarians</HI> derived their
Name from the <HI>Huni &amp;</HI> Avari (<HI>Morden in his Geography mentions the Au∣thors
front whence we have it</HI>) The <HI>Catalonians</HI> from the <HI>Catti &amp;</HI> Albani:
The Counties in <HI>Germany</HI> use that common Name: And that only is called
<HI>Feudum novum</HI> which is acquired by Money, Donation or Conquest, and
that <HI>Feudum antiquum</HI> which descends by Blood and Succession.</P>
<P>When the 2d question came under debate some of the Commissioner agreed,
it was unreasonable the <HI>Scots</HI> should be admitted to, and made capable of
all the Employments in <HI>England.</HI> To this it was answered, That to refuse it
would continue the ancient Grudge and Enmity, for the <HI>Romans</HI> were ne∣ver
engaged in a sharper War, than in the <HI>Bellum sociale,</HI> which the <HI>La∣tines</HI>
raised against them, because they would not admit them to be Con∣suls
after they were united, (<HI>vide Livy, Plutarch, Florus, &amp;c.</HI>) After which
the <HI>Romans</HI> did by their own Law Declare, That <HI>inter Concives &amp; Muni∣cipes,
omnia munera debent esse communicata. Municipes enim sunt qui pari∣ter
munera piblica suscipiun.</HI> And <HI>Polybius</HI> in <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. speaking of the
Method whereby the <HI>Achaans</HI> establish'd their happy Union, (read also
<HI>Plutarch</HI>) observes it to have been by this means.</P>
<P>This Privilege has been allowed the Scots in <HI>France,</HI> for the Earl of <HI>Bu∣chan</HI>
was made Constable by <HI>Cb.</HI> the 7th, because he defeated the Duke of
<HI>Charence: Douglass</HI> was made Duke of <HI>Turaine; Aubigney Vice Roy</HI> of <HI>Naples.</HI>
Count <HI>Lesly</HI> was preferred lately to be an Earl of the <HI>Empire,</HI> and still in
the Emperial <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Dyets. In <HI>England William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbary</HI> confesses three
<HI>Scots-Men</HI> were successively created Arrh-Bishops of <HI>York,</HI> and the Earl of
<HI>Forth</HI> was in the late Wars the successful General of the <HI>English</HI> Army.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> thought this Debate encroach'd upon his Prerogative, and
therefore desired it might go no further; That tho by his Prerogative he
might imploy Natives of either Kingdom as he pleased, yet he would pre∣fer
the Subjects of the respective Kingdoms in their native Countries, till
mutual Education and a lasting Union had fitted them to be indifferently
employ'd, upon which Assurance all the Commissioners rested, and so
they proceeded to put these Conclusions in Form, and the Articles agreed
upon were these.</P>
<P>It is agreed by the Commissioners of <HI>E.</HI> and S. to be mutually
proposed to the Parliaments of both Realms at the next Session, that all
<PB N="105" REF="717"/>
Hostile Laws made and conceived expresly, either by <HI>E.</HI> against <HI>S.</HI> or <HI>S.</HI>
against <HI>E.</HI> shall in the next Sessions be abrogated, and utterly extinguish.|ed.</P>
<P>It is also agreed, That all Laws, Customs and Treaties of the Border
betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be declared by a general Act to be
abrogated and obliterated: And that the Subjects on either Part shall be
governed by the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdoms where they dwell,
and the Name of the <HI>Borders</HI> extinguished.</P>
<P>And because by abolishing the Border-Laws and Customs, it may be
doubted, that the Executions shall cease uoon these Sentences that have
heretofore been given by the opposite Officers of those Borders, upon
Wrongs committed before the Death of the late Queen of happy Memo∣ry;
It is therefore thought fit, That in case the Commissioners or Officers
to be appointed by His Majesty before the time of the next Sessions of Par∣liament,
shall not procure sufficient Redress of such fyled Bills &amp; Sentences,
that then the said Parliament may be moved to take such Order, as to
their Wisdoms shall seem convenient in satisfaction of that which has been
decerned by some Officers. As also, how Disorders and Insolencies may
be hereafter repressed, and the Country which was lately of the Borders
kept in Peace and Quietness in time to come; As likewise to prescribe
some Orders how the Pursuits of former Wrongs preceeding the Death of the
late Queen, and since the last Treaty of the Borders in the years 1596, and
1597, which have never as yet been moved, may be continued, and pro∣secuted
to a definitive Sentence.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as the next Degree to the Abolition of all Memory of
Hostility, is the Participation of mutual Commodities and Commerce;
It is agreed First, concerning Importation of Merchandize into either Re∣alm
from Foreign Parts; That whereas certain Commodities are wholly
prohibited by the several Laws of both Realms to be brought into either
of them by the Natives themselves, or by any other, the said Prohibitions
shall now be made mutual to both, and neither an <HI>English-man</HI> bring into
<HI>Scotland,</HI> or a <HI>Scots-man</HI> into <HI>England</HI> any of these prohibited Wares and
Commodities: Nevertheless if the said Commodities be made in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
it shall be lawful to bring them out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and so recipro∣cally
of the Commodities made in <HI>England</HI> and carried to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas a doubt hath been conceived against the equal Commnnication
of Trade betwixt the <HI>English</HI> &amp; <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects in the matter of Importation,
grounded upon some Inequality of Privileges, which the <HI>Scots</HI> are report∣ed
to have in Foreign Parts, and namely in <HI>France,</HI> above the <HI>English,</HI>
whereby the English might be prejudged: And that after a deliberate Con∣sideration
had of the supposed Inequalities, both privateand publick Exa∣mination
of divers Merchants of either side, touching all Liberties, Pri∣vileges,
Immunities, Imposts and Payments on the part of the <HI>English,</HI>
and on the part of the <HI>Scots,</HI> either at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> for their Trade of Wines,
or in <HI>Normandyor</HI> any other parts of <HI>Francefor</HI> other Commodities, it appear∣ed
that in the Trade of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> there was &amp; isso little difference in any
advantage of Privileges or Immunities, or in the Imposts and Payments,
all being reckoned ana well weighed on either side, as it could not justly
hinder the Communication of Trade. In the Trade of <HI>Normandy</HI> likewise,
or any other Parts of <HI>France,</HI> the advantage the <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects by their
Privileges are acknowledged to have, is such as without much Difficulty
may be reconciled and reduced to an Equality with the <HI>English,</HI> by such
means as are hereafter declared. It is agreed that the <HI>Scots-men</HI> shall be
<PB N="106" REF="718"/>
free for transporting of Wine from <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> paying the same
Customs &amp; Duties that the <HI>English-men</HI> do pay, &amp; the <HI>English-men</HI> likewife
shail be free for transporting Wine &amp; other Commodities from <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to
<HI>Scotland</HI> paying the same customs &amp; duties that the <HI>Scots-men</HI> do pay there.</P>
<P>And likewise ior clearing and resolving the Doubts touching the Ad∣vantage
that these <HI>Scots</HI> are supposed to have above the <HI>English</HI> in Buying
and transporting the Commodities of <HI>Normandy</HI> and other parts of rhe King∣dom
of <HI>rance,</HI> excepting the buying of Wine in <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> which is al∣ready
determined. It is agreed, that there sball be sent some meet and
discreet Persons into <HI>France,</HI> two for either side, to take notice os any such
Advantage, as either the <HI>Englisg</HI> have above the <HI>Scots,</HI> or the <HI>Scots</HI> above
the <HI>English,</HI> in Buying or Transporting of any Commodities of <HI>Normandy,</HI>
or any parts of <HI>France,</HI> excepting the Wine of <HI>Bourdeaux:</HI> And as the
said Persons shall find the advantage to be, so for making the Trade e∣qual,
the Customs shall be advanced to the King in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI>
And for the part of these that have the advantage, and according
to the Proportion of the said Advantage, the Advancement of
the Custom to continue no longer, than the Privilege having such advan∣tage
shall continue. And that generally for all other rade from any
Parts the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects, each in others Countrey, shall have
Liberty of Importation as freely as any of the Native Subjects themselves
having special Privilege.</P>
<P>Next, Concerning Exportation, It is agreed. That all such Goods as
are prohibited and forbidden to <HI>English-men</HI> themselves to be exported
out of <HI>England</HI> to any Foreign Part, the same shalt be unlawful for any
<HI>Scots-man,</HI> or any other to export to any Foreign Nation beyond Sea,
under the same Penalties and Forfeitures that the <HI>English</HI> are subject un∣to,
and reciprocally that furth of <HI>Scotland</HI> no <HI>English</HI> Man shall transport
to any Foreign Parts the Goods and Commodities that are pro∣hibited
in <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Scots</HI> Men themselves. Nevertheless such Goods
and Commodities and Merchandizes as are licensed to <HI>English</HI> Men to
transport out of <HI>England</HI> to any Foreign Part, the same may be likewise
transported by <HI>Scots</HI> Men thither, they certifying their going into For∣reign
Parts, and taking a Cocquet accordingly, aud paying the ordinary
Custom that <HI>English</HI> Men do pay themselves at the Exportation of such
Wares, the like Liberty to be for <HI>English</HI> Men in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Native Commodities which either of the Countries do <HI>yield,</HI>
and may serve for the use and benefit of the other; It is agreed, That
mutually there may be transported furh of E. to S. and furth of S. to <HI>E.</HI>
all such Wares as are either of the Growth or Handywork of either of the
said Realms, without payment of any Impost, Custom or Exaction; and
as freely in all respects as any Wares may be transported either in <HI>En∣gland</HI>
from part to part, or in <HI>Scotland</HI> from Part to Part, except such
particular Sorts of Goods and Merchandizes as are hereafter mentioned,
being restrain'd for the proper and inward nse of each Country. And
for that purpose it is declared. That both in this Communication of Bene∣fit,
and Participation of the native Commodities of the one Coutrey with
the other, there shall be specially reserv'd and excepted the sorts hereaf∣ter
specified; That is to say, Wool, Sheep, Sheepfell, Cattel, Leather,
Hides, and Linen-yarn, which are specially retrain'd within each Coun∣trey,
not to be transported from one to the other; excepting also and re∣serving
to the <HI>Scots</HI> Men their Trade of Fishing within the Lochs, Firths
and Bayes, within Land, and in the Seas within 14 Miles of the Coasts of
the Realm of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where neither <HI>English</HI> -men nor any Strangers have
<PB N="107" REF="719"/>
us'd to Fish; and so reciprocally on the behalf of <HI>England.</HI> All which
Restrictions aud Exceptions are not to be understood or mentioned in any
fort for a Mark or Note ot Separation and Division, but only as matters
of Policy and Conveniency tor the several Estates of each Countrey.</P>
<P>Furthermore it is agreed, That all foreign Wares to be transported
forth of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> or out of <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> by any of
the King's Subjects of either Kingdoms, having at their first Entry once
paid Custom in either of the Kingdoms, shall not pay outward Customs
therein afterwards, save only inward Custom at the Port whereunto they
shall be transported: But the Owner of the Goods, or Factor, or Master
of the Ship shall give Bond not to transport the same into any foreign Parts.</P>
<P>It is also agreed, That <HI>Scots</HI> -men shall not be debarred from being As∣sociates
unto any <HI>English</HI> Company of Merchants, as Merchant-Venturers or
others upon such Conditions as any <HI>English</HI> -man may be admitted; and so
reciprocally for <HI>English</HI> men in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It is nevertheless agreed by mutual Consent, and is so to be understood,
that the mutual Liberty aforesaid of Exportation and Trade in each part
from the one to the other, shall serve for the inward use only of either Re∣alm;
and Ordar taken for the retraining and prohibiting the Transpor∣tation
of the laid Commodities to foreign Parts, and for due Punishment
of those that shall transgress in that behalf. And for the Better Assu∣rance
and Caution herein. It is agreed that every Merchant so offending
shall forfeit his Goods, the Ships wherein the said Goods shall be trans∣ported
confiscated; the Customers, Searchers, and other Officers of the
Custom whatsoever, in case of Consent or knowledge on their part, to lose
their Offices and Goods, and their Bodies to be imprisoned at His Maje∣sty's
pleasure. Of which Escheats and Forfeitures two Parts shall apper∣tain
to His Majesty, it the Customs be framed, and the Third to the In∣former:
And if the Customs be farmed, one Third of the Forfeiture to
belong to His Majesty, a Third to the Farmer, and the other Third to the In∣former.
The Tryal of the Offence to be summar in either Countrey in
the Exchequer Chamber; by Writ, sufficient Witnesses, or Oath of Party,
or before the Justice by Jury or Assize, and his Majesty's Officers in either
Countrey to concur with the Complainers that insist in the Pursuit.</P>
<P>As also for the more Security that there shall be no Transportation of
such Goods, it is agreed that at the shipping of all such native Com∣modities
there be taken by the Customer of the Port where the Goods or
Wares are embark'd a Bond or Obligation subscribed by the Owner of the
Goods, and Master of the Ship; By the Owner if he be present, or by the
Master of the Ship, or Factor, or Party that loadeth the same in case of
his absence: Which Bond shall contain a Sum of Money answerable to
the Value of the Goods, with condition of relieving the Party obliged, and
discharging him of the said Bond in case Return be made of a due Cer∣tificate
to the Custom where the Goods were laden, from any Port within
<HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Certificate to be subscribed and sealed by
the Officers of the Customs of the Port where the said Goods shall arrive
to be unladen: Or if there be no such Officers there, by the chief Magi∣istrate
and Town Clerk of that Harbour and Town under their Hand and
Seal. And it is further agreed touching the different Fraighting of Com∣modities
either in <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Scots</HI> Bottoms, that <HI>English</HI> -men and <HI>Scots</HI>
men <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fraight and laden their Goods each in others Ships &amp; Bottoms indiffe∣rently,
paying only <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Custom, notwithstanding any contra∣ry
Laws or Prohibitions. And that a Proposition be made to the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>England</HI> for establishing some good Orders, for upholding and
maintaining the great Fishing of <HI>England;</HI> as also that a Proposition be
<PB N="108" REF="720"/>
made to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> for making of their shipping more
proportionable in Burthen to the shipping or <HI>England,</HI> the better to serve
for the Equality of Trade, and a common Defence for the whole Isle.</P>
<P>And because it's Requisite that the mutual Communication aforesaid, be
not only extended to the Matter of Commerce, but to all other Benefites
and Privileges of natural born Subjects; It is agreed that an Act be pro∣poned
to be passed in Manner following: That all the Subjects of both Re∣alms
born since the Decease of the late Queen, and that shal be born here∣after
under the Obedience of His Majesty or His Royal Progeny, are by
the common Laws of both Realms, and shall be for ever enabled to ob∣tain,
succeed, inherit and possess all Goods, Lands and Chattels, Honours,
Dignities, Offices, Liberties &amp; Privileges &amp; Benefices Ecclesiastick or Civil,
in Parliament and all other places of the Kingdoms, and every one of the
same, in all respects, and without any Exception whatsomever, as fully
and amply as the Subjects of either Realm respectively might have done,
or may do in any sort within the Kingdom where they are born.</P>
<P>Further, his Majesty out of his great Judgment and Providence, hath
not only prosessed in publick and private Speech to the Nobility and
Council of both Kingdoms, but hath also vouchsased to be contented that
for a more full Satisfaction and Comfort of all his loving Subjects, it may
fce compris'd in the said Act, that his Majesty meaneth not to conser any
Office of the Crown, any Office of Judicature, Place, Voice or Office in
Parliament of either Kingdom, upon the Subjects of the other, born be∣fore
the death of the late Queen, until Time and Conversation have en∣creas'd
and accomplish'd an Union of the said Kingdoms, as well in the
Hearts of all the People, and in the Conformity of Laws and Policies
in these Kingdoms, as in the Knowledge and Sufficiency of particular men,
who being untimely imployed in such Authorities, could no way be able,
much less acceptable, to discharge such Duties belonging to them. It is
therefore resolved by us the Commissioners aforesaid, not only in regard
of our Desires and Endeavours to further a speedy Conclusion of this hap∣py
Work intended, but also as a Testimony of our Love and Thankful∣ness
for his gracious Promise, on whose Sincerity and Benignity we build
our full Assurance, even according to the inward sense and feeling of our
own Loyal and Hearty Affections, to obey and please him in all things
worthy the Subjects of so worthy a Sovereign, that it shall be desired of
both the Parliaments, to be enacted by their Authority, That all the Sub∣jects
of both Realms born before the Decease of the late Queen, may be ena∣bled
and made capable to acquire, purchase, inherit, succeed, use &amp; dispose of
all Lands, Goods, Inheritances, Offices, Honours, Dignities Libertics, Privileges
Immunities, Benefices and Preferments whatsoever, Each Subject in either
Kingdom with the same freedom and as lawfully and peaceably as the ve∣ry
natural and born Subjects of either Realm, where the said Rights, Es∣tates
or Profits arc Established; Notwithstanding whatsoever Law Sta∣tute,
or former Constitution heretofore in Force to the contrary; Other
than to acquire, possess succced or inherit any Office of the Crown, office of
Indicatory, or any Voice, place or Office in Parliament. All which shall
remain free from being claim'd, held or enjoy'd by the Subjects of the one
Kingdom within the other, born before the decease of the late Queen,
notwithstanding any Words, Sense or Interpretation of the Act, or any Cir∣tumstance
thereupon depending, untill there be a perfect &amp; full Accomplish∣ment
of the Union, as is desired mutually by both the Realms. In all which
points of Reservation, either in Recital of the words, His Majesties sacred
Promise, or in any Clause or Sentence, before specified, from enabling
<PB N="109" REF="721"/>
them to any of theforesaidPlaces or Dignities. It hath been &amp; ever shall be
so far from the thoughts of any of us, to presume to alter or impair His Ma∣jestys
Prerogative Royal (who contrariwise do with all comfort&amp; confidence
depend herein, upon the gracious Assurance which his Majesty is pleased
to give in the Declaration of his so just and Princely Care and Favour
to all his People,) as for a further laying open of our clear &amp; dutiful Inten∣tions
towards His Majestie in this &amp; in all things else which may concern
his Prerogative; We do also herein profess &amp; declare, that We think it fit,
there be inserted in the Act to be proponed and passed in express terms,
a sufficient Reservation of his Majesties Perogative Royal, to denizate,
enable, and prefer to such Offices, Honours, Dignities, and Benefices
whatsoever in both the said Kingdoms, and either of them, as are here∣tofore
excepted in the preceeding Reservation of all <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Sub∣jects
born before the Decease of the late Queen, as freely, soveraignly
and absolutely as any of His Majesties Royal Progenitors Kings of <HI>En∣gland</HI>
or <HI>Scotland,</HI> might have done at any time heretofore, and to all o∣ther
Intents and Purposes, in as ample manner as if no such Act had
been thought of or mentioned.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as the several Jurisdictions and Administrations of either
Realm may be abused by Malefactors, by their own Impunity, if they
shall commit any Offence in the one Realm, and afterwards remove their
Persons and Abode into the other; It is agreed, that there may be some
fit Course advised of by the Wisdoms of the Parliaments, for Tryal and
proceeding against the Persons of Offenders remaining in the one Realm.
for and concerning the Crimes and Faults committed in the other Realm.
And yet nevertheless that it may be lawful for the Justice of the Realm,
where the Offence is committed, to remand the Offender remaining in
the other Realm, to be answerable to the Justice of the same. Realm
where the Fact was committed, &amp; that upon such Remand made, the Offen∣der
shall be accordingly delivered, and all further Proceedings (if any
be) in the other Realm shall cease, so as it may be done without pre∣judice
to His Majesty, or other Lords in their Escheats and Forfeitures,
with provision nevertheless that this be not thought necessary to be
made for all Criminal Offences, but in special Cases only, as namely in
the Cases of wilful Murther, falsifying of Moneys, and forging of Deeds,
Instruments and Writings, and such other like Cases, as upon further Ad∣vice
in the said Parliament may be thought sit to be added.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Paper given in by the Scots Commissioners
to the English Commissioners for adjusting
the differences of Trade between the two
Kingdoms, Jan. 21, 1667.</HEAD>
<P>WE the Commissioners of and for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Nomi∣ated,
and suffiently Authorized by His Majesty under His
<PB N="110" REF="722"/>
great Seal of that Kingdoms to Treat and Consult, as also to Conclude
and Determine with your Lordships the Commissioners nominated by His
Majesty for the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> of and concerning the Freedom and
Liberty of Trade, between the two Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI>
do represent, That wheteas his Majesty's Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> be under
the Alledgeance of the King since the happy Succession of K. James to the
Crown of <HI>England,</HI> are so far from being Aliens, that they are declared to
have by the Law of this Kingdom all the Privileges of natural born
Subjects of <HI>England.</HI> And whereas His Majesties Subjects in <HI>Scotland</HI> have
enjoyed the same in all the Dominions and Plantations belonging to the
Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> more than 56 years without any considerable Ob∣struction
all that time, yet since the 25 of March in the 12 year of His Ma∣jesties
Reign, by some Acts of Parliament here in <HI>England,</HI> the King's
Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> are clearly debarred from the Privilege granted to all
His Majesties other Subjects; being by these Acts several Immunities
and Privileges granted to such Ships, as do truely and without Fraud be∣long
only to the People of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> Dominion of Wales, or
Town or Berwick upon Tweed, and all Other Ships and Vessels (without
any Exception) with all their Goods and Merchandizes are declared to
be forefaulted. Also by other Acts of Parliament since that time, Goods
and Commodities of <HI>Scotland</HI> are at some times charged with a double Du∣ty
or Imposition above 16 times more than the Goods of the like Nature of
Foreign Growth, &amp; some unusual Customs are exacted in Northumberland &amp;
Camberland.</P>
<P>In Order to the removing of all Obstructions, to the, Freedom &amp; Liberty
of Trade between the two Kingdoms, to the end the People of Scotland
may be encouraged, to trade here as formerly, and to export from the
Kingdom such foreign and other Commodities as are necessary for them,
(which We conceive to be a great advantage to this Kingdom, the expor∣ted
Commodities far exceeding these imported hither) for encouraging
the Shipping and Seamen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> without which Trade cannot be
continued, and for preventing the Removal of the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> into
foreign Parts, which would be very prejudicial to His Majesties Customs
in this Kingdom (as we conceive) and to the happy Union and Cor∣respondence
of the two Kingdoms, which we do above all things endea∣vour
to preserve.</P>
<P>We do begin with that which was 1st in time, and indeed of the greatest
Importance to <HI>Scotland,</HI> an Act Intituled (An Act for the incouraging and
increasing Shipping and Navigation) passed in the 12 year of His Maje∣sty's
Reign, and Ratified, Confirmed and Enacted in the 13 year. Cap. 140
In relation to which Act, we desire 1st. That as to the Trade with the
Lands, Islands, Plantations and Territories to His Majesty belonging, or
in his Possession, or which may thereafter belong unto, or be in the
Possession of His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, in Asia, Africa or A∣merica,
the same Freedom may be allowed to such Ships and Vessels as do
truly and without Fraud belong to the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whereof the
master &amp; three 4th Parts are Scotsman, or other His Majesties Subjects, and
fraighted only by His Majesties Subjects; as are allowed to His Majesties
Subjects of Ireland, Dominion of Wales and Berwick upon Tweed.</P>
<P>2. That if be Declared, That His Majesties Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> are not
meaned to be debarred by the Clause debarring Men or Person, not born
within the Alledgeance of our Sovereign Lord the King, from exercising
the Trade or Occupation of Merchants or Factor in any of the saids
Places.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="723"/>
3. That the Ships or Vessels belonging truly to His Majesties Subjects
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> navigated as is before expressed, and fraighted only by His
Majesties Subjects, may be declared to have Liberty to bring into <HI>England</HI>
the Goods and Commodities that are of Foreign Growth, Production, or
Manufactory, under the same Restrictions and Limitations as are exprest e∣ver
since King James came to <HI>England,</HI> is or absolute necessity for entertain∣ing
the Shipping of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and keeping the samen there for His Maje∣sties
Service, and will be an encrease of His Majesties Customs.</P>
<P>4. That all other Privileges granted by this Act to the Ships and Ves∣sels
belonging truly to the Subjects of Ireland, Wales, and Town of Ber∣wick
upon Tweed, may be also declared to belong to the Ships or Vessels
truly belonging to the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Navigated &amp; Fraighted as
is aforesaid, under the same Restrictions and Limitations alwise as by this
Act said upon the Subjects of Ireland, &amp;c. That it may be declared than
the Penalties imposed upon Aliens for transporting of Goods from Ports
to Ports, and all other Penalties imposed upon Aliens by this Act, that the
Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> are no ways therein concerned.</P>
<P>5. That whereas almost all the Ships and Vessels belonging to His Ma∣jesties
Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were during the late U surpation taken, burnt or
Destroyed, and many of the Vessels taken or bought since His Majesties
happy Return, are foreign built; we desire that all Vessels taken from the
Kings Enemies, and condemned as lawful Prize, may be Declared Na∣turalized,
as is lately done here, and that they and all such Ships as are
truly in the Possession of His Majesties Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> may be de∣clared
capable of free Trade here, as if they had been built within His
Majesties Dominions; A List of such Ships being entred betwixt and a
day to be agreed upon into the Custom-house Books here, Provided that
it shall not be lawful for Scots-men to trade here with any foreign buils
Ships to be bought hereafter, but only with such Ships as are built in Scot∣land,
or some other of His Majesties Dominions, and that both the Prize∣Ships
and other Ships now in the possession of the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> be
navigated by 3 Parts of 4 of Scots-men, or others His Majesties Subjects,
and fraighted only by His Majesties Subjects.</P>
<P>6. And whereas it may be supposed, that by demanding such a Trade
with the Plantations, as is allowed to the Subjects of Ireland, we may pre∣judge
His Majesties Customs here, or destroy the Ends of the Act of Na∣vigation
as to these Commodities; We Declare that we are willing to
Treat and Conclude with your Lordships upon such Assurances as can be
reasonably demanded, that none of these Commodities shall be transport∣ed
by Scots Ships from the <HI>English</HI> Plantations to any place beyond the
Seas, but they shall be Wholly brought into such Parts of <HI>England</HI> as shall
be agreed upon, excepting only such a very small Number, for the Con∣sumption
or <HI>Scotland,</HI> as shall be agreed upon betwixt your Lordships
and us.</P>

Canterbury as first in their Commission upmost, And the Scots on the left

they were set, the Lord Keeper moved, That their respective Commissions
should be read, by which they would best know the Reasons of their Meet∣ing,
which was done, the <HI>English</HI> first in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, and the
Scots in the Latine: when that was over, the Lord Keeper made the
following Speech, which was answered by the Duke of Queensberry.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“WE the Commissioners, for <HI>England,</HI> do, with great Satisfaction
meet your Lordships on this Occasion, hoping that by this Con∣gress
the great Business for which Her Majesty has been pleased to grant
these Commissions, may be happily effected. That <HI>England</HI> and Scot∣land
already united in Alledgeance under one Head, the Queen, may

that may conduce to a happy Period of this great Work.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Duke of Queensberrie's Answer.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Union of the two Kingdoms has been much desired both before
and since their being under one Sovereign, and I hope, it is re∣served
to Her Majesty for the Glory of Her Reign, to finish the design
which hath been often attempted by Her Royal Predecessors.</P>
<P>“My Lord, I do consider this Union to be highly advantageous for the
Peace and Wealth of both Kingdoms, and a great Security for the Pro∣teshant
Religion every-where; And, I can assure your Lordships both
for my self, and the other Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> that we
meet your Lordships with great Regard and Honour to your Persons,
and with sincere Intentions to advance this great Design, &amp; to accom∣modate
any Difficulties that may arise in the Treaty upon fair and rea∣sonable
Terms.</P>
<P>Then the Lord Keeper moved, That some Words of the Scots Com∣mission
should be read over again, which was done, the Words they no∣ticed
were, Dando illis plenum potestatem congregandi &amp; conveniendi cum
Commissionariis autboritate nostra munitis pro Regno &amp; Parliamento Anglia,
<PB N="114" REF="726"/>
&amp;c. After reading, he said, he did not conceive how they were such
as the Scots were impowered to Treat with, not being Commissionarii pro Par∣liamento
Anglia; Before any Answer was made the Earl of Seafield mo∣ved,
That the Commissions should be interchanged against the next meet∣ing,
and that then they would be better able to judge of the Purport and
Intent of the Commissions, which was agreed to, and the next meeting
appointed ion Monday thereafter.</P>

<HEAD>Die Lunae the 16th of Novemb. 1702.</HEAD>

be Adjourned till Wednesday, in hopes it might be more full; To which
the Scots agreed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Die Mercurii 18. November 1702.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commissioners met, and the <HI>English;</HI> insisting no more on the Keep∣ers
Objections, they received a Message from the Queen, in two diffe∣rent
Papers, but of the same Tenor, which was read as followeth.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<OPENER>A. R.</OPENER>
<P>“HER Majesty having in Prosecution of the several Attempts made by
Her Royal Predecessors, moved both the Parliaments to consider
of the most effectual Methods for establishing an Union be∣tween
the two Kingdoms; And Her majesty being authorized by both
Parliaments to Appoint Commissioners to Treat of the Terms of this
Union, which She hath done accordingly, Her majesty hopeth that the
Commissioners now happily met for this purpose, will agree upon such
Measures as will be acceptable to both Parliaments; and may perfect
thinks the most likely means under Heaven to establish the monarchy,
secure the peace, and encrease the Trade, Wealth and Happiness of
both nations.</P>
<P>“The Heads of this Treaty are so obvious, that Her Majesty does not
think it necessary to Name them, but Her Majesty recommends it to
the Commissioners, to make such Proposals mutually on this Subject, as
shall occur to them, and may be most likely to bring this Treaty to a
happy and speedy Conclusion.</P>
<P>“And Her Majesty earnestly wishes for Her own Honour, and the
Welfare of Her Subjects, That this Union may be established on such
solid Foundations, as that the Breach of it may be as impossible as
humane Councils can make it. Given at the Court of St. James's the
16th November 1702.</P>
<P>To the Commissioners appointed for Treating of an Union be∣tween
the two Kingdoms.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="727"/>
After rending of this Letter, the Lord Keeper proposed the fol∣lowing
Overtures, at the Rule of the Method of their proceeding
which were agreed to, and are as follow.</P>
<P>1. That all Proposals, mutually to be made, shall be offered in Writing.</P>
<P>2. That no Proposals so made shall be debated the same day.</P>
<P>3. That all Debates shall be by word of Mouth, and not in Writing.</P>
<P>4. That every Point that shall be agreed on shall be reduced in Writ∣ing.</P>
<P>5. That no Point though agreed on and reduced into Writing, shall be
obligatory on either side, till alt Matters be adjusted in such manner
as shall be proper to be laid before the Queen &amp; the two Parliaments.</P>
<P>And then they Adjourned till Friday.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Die Veneris 20 November 1702.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commissioners met, and the Scots gave in two Additional Prelimi∣nary
Articles, One of them Explanatory of the 5th these given in
by the Lord Keeper; The other about the Minutes, which Were both a∣greed
on by the <HI>English,</HI> and are as follows.</P>
<P>6. That these Matters tho so adjusted as may be proper to be laid before
the Queen and the two Parliaments, shall not be binding till Ap∣prov'd
and Ratified in the said Parliaments.</P>
<P>7. That there be a Committee appointed, consisting of a certain Number
of each Side, to revise the Minutes of what passes, which are not to
be inserted by the Secretaries in their respective Books, but by the
Order of the said Committee.</P>
<P>Then the Lord Keeper gave in thir Proposals about the Subject of the
Treaty, viz.</P>
<P>That the two Kingdoms be united into one, by the Name of the King∣dom
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That the Succession to the Monarchy of this united Kingdom of Great-Britain,
shall be according to the Limitations mentioned in the Act of
Parliament made in <HI>England</HI> in the 12th and 13th Year of the Reign of
the late K. William, Intituled, An Act for the further limitation of

<P>2. The Representing both Kingdoms in one Parliament.</P>
<P>3. The mutual Communication of Trade, and all other Privileges and
Advantages.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="728"/>
These are the General Articles, In which it is proposed, That the two
Kingdoms may be United; There will be certain other Articles and pro∣per
Reservations which may be offered afterwards.</P>
<P>These Proposals were read twice, and Ordered to be Exchanged, and
to be considered against the next Meeting, which was appointed to be on
Wednesday thereafter.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Die Mercurii 25. Novemb. 1702.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commissioners met, the Lord Keeper moved, That the 6th Preli∣minary
Article which had been proposed and agreed on at the pre∣ceeding
Meeting might be considered, upon which the Lords Commissio∣ners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> withdrew, and within a little returning, the Duke of
Queensberry acquainted the. Lords Comimissioners for <HI>England,</HI> That they
were satisfied the 6th Article should be laid aside, providing something
might be found out to satisfie their Difficulty as to the 5th Article.</P>
<P><HI>Agreed,</HI> That the 6th Article be laid aside, and that there be added to the
5th these Words, for their Approbation.</P>
<P><HI>Agreed,</HI> That to the 7th Article about the Committees, these words be
added, Having first made Report thereof to their respective Commissioners, and
received their Approbation of the same.</P>
<P>Then were nominate the Commissioners for the Committee.</P>
<P>Of the Scots Commissioners, Viscount of Stair, Lord President of the
Session, and the Lord Treasurer-deput, or any two of them. And of the
English, Sir John Cook, Mr. Godolphin, and Mr. Clark, or any two of
them.</P>
<P>The Duke of Queensberry acquainted the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners, That
they had prepared an Answer to the proposal given in by their Lordships
at their proceeding Meeting; The Tenor whereof follows.</P>
<P>The Commissioners for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> do agree, That the
Kingdoms be united into One by the Name of the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
and that the Succession to the Monarchy of this United Kingdom
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in Default of the Issue of the Body of Her Majesty Q.
ANNE (which GOD forbid) shall descend on Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> Electoress
Dowager of Hannover, and remain to Her and the Heirs of Her Body be∣ing

The other Conditions and Provision contained in the above-men∣tioned
Act, to be considered in the further progress of the Treaty, in or∣der
to be adapted to the Constitutions and Laws of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Then the Lord Keeper acquainted the Scots Commissioners, That they
had prepared an Answer to two of the Articles proposed by their Lord∣ships,
<PB N="117" REF="729"/>
having the Third under Consideration, which was read as follows.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> have taken into their Conside∣ration

<P>2. The Representing both Kingdoms in one Parliament, and are come to
the following Resolution. That there can be no doubt of their Lordships a∣greeing
to the First Article, it being comprehended in what their Lordships
have offered. That as to the 2d. Article their Lordships agree to the Proposition
in general, referring to their future Consideration such Proposals as shall be
offered to make it practicable.</P>
<P>My Lord Duke of Queensberry Moved, That since they had given their

<P>THE Commissioners met, the Lord Keeper of <HI>England</HI> acquainted the

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> have taken into their Considera∣tion
the 3d Article proposed by your Lordships, <HI>viz.</HI> The mutual Com∣munication
of Trade and other Privileges and Advantages, and are come
to this Resolution.</P>
<P>Their Lordships agree, That a mutual Communication of Trade and
other Privileges and Advantages, is proper and reasonable in a compleat
Union of the two Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Their Lordships propose, That your Lordships Answer to the Proposal
from the Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> which relates to the uniting the two
Kingdoms in one, and fettling the Succession, may together with their
present Answer to the third Article be entred into the respective Books

<P>THE Commissioners being met, the Duke of Queensberry said,
That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> had some thing to offer to
their Lordships, in reference to their Lordships Answer to the 3d Article
about Communication of Trade, which was read as follows.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having taken into Consideration
your Lordships Answer to the 3d Article at their Proposals, wherein
your Lordships agree, That a mutual Communication of Trade and other
Privileges and Advantages is proper and reasonable in a compleat Union
of the two Kingdoms, their Lordships conceive that the uniting the two
Kingdoms into a Monarchy, in one Parliament, and one Line of Succes∣sion,
is such an Union as Entitle the Subjects of both Kingdoms to a mu∣tual
Communication of Trade, and other Privileges and Advantages, and
if your Lordships do acquiesce and consent to the Communication of
Trade in these Terms, the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do content
that the Answer and this Addition be entred in the respective Books and
Journals.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> withdrew to consider this, and
returning within a little, the Lord. Keeper offered what follows, which
was read.</P>
<P>Their Lordships conceive that the Union cannot be compleat till the
Terms are adjusted, upon which it is to be constituted, and therefore tho
they allow the Communication of Trade and other Privileges to be the
necessary Result or a compleat Union: yet in the Method of proceeding
they must first settle with your Lordships the Terms and Conditions of the
Communication of Trade and other Privileges, and they are ready to
enter upon the Consideration of them in such a Method as shall be agree∣ed
on, and most likely to bring this particular Matter to a speedy De∣termination.</P>
<P>They move, That their Answer to the Proposal from the Commissioners
of <HI>England,</HI> which relates to the uniting the two Kingdoms into one, and
settling the Succession, may be entred.</P>
<P>To this the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> after having withdrawn
for some time, and returned, made the following Answer, which was
read, and agreed to by the the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> arts satisfied to treat the Particu∣lars
of the Communication of Trade, in order to adjust the same, and do
agree that the Proposals and Answers mutually made on either side be
entered in the respective Books and Journals in the terms of the Prelimi∣naries.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="731"/>
Then the Duke of Queensberry offered on the part of the Lords Com∣missioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> the following Proposals, which was read, and agre∣ed
to by the <HI>English</HI> without withdrawing.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> propose to your Lordships, That
for preparing and facilitating Matters which may occur in this Treaty,
there may be a Committee confuting of 4 or 5 Persons of either King∣dom
Nominate from time to time, to meet and discourse the Points that

<P>6. That the former Proposals are made without prejudice to the Com∣panics

<P>THE Lord Keeper acquainted the Lords Commissioners for Scotland,
That having been taken up with publick Business since the last Meet∣ing,
they had not prepared Answers to the Proposals then offered by
them, but that they should endeavour to have them ready against the

<P>He also acquainted their Lordships, That Her Majesty designs to Ho∣nour
this Meeting with Her Presence; And moved, That the Proposals
made on either Side since the Commencement of the Treaty, and the
Resolutions taken thereupon, Should be read over to Her Majesty.</P>
<P>Within a little Her Majesty came in, and being let in Her Chamber,
spoke to the Lords Commissioners to this Purpose.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I Am fully perswaded, that the Union of the two Kingdoms will prove
the Happiness of Both; and render this Island more formidable than
it has been in past Ages; That I wish this Treaty may be brought to
a good and speedy Conclusion, I am come to know what Progress you
have made in it, and I do assure you nothing shall be wanting on my part
to bring it to Perfection.</P>
<P>The Lord Keeper told Her Majesty, That what was then under Consi∣deration,
was, some Proposals offered on the part of their Lordships for
Scotland about Trade, to which they had not yet prepared an Answer,
but desired to know if Her Majesty would hear read the Proposals for∣merly
given on other Side, and the Resolutions taken thereupon, which
Her Majesty allowed.</P>
<P>After reading whereof, Her Majesty went away, and the

<HEAD>Die Mercurii 16th Decemb. 1702.</HEAD>
<P>THE. Commissioners met, and the Lord Keeper in name of the <HI>English</HI>
Commissioners gave in the following Paper to the Lords Commissio∣ners
for <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was read is follows.
Some Consieration of the Lord Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> upon the
<PB N="121" REF="733"/>
Proposals delivered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> on the 9th
instant, to be proposed as the Subject Matter of Debate between the
Lords Commissioners of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>As to the First Article, Their Lordships are of Opinion that there be a
free Trade between the two Kingdoms, for the Native Commodities of
the Growth, Product or Manufactory of the respective Countries, with
an Exception of Wooll, Sheep and Sheep Fells, and without any Distincti∣on
or Imposition other than equal Duties upon the home Consumption re∣spectively:
Their Lordships being of Opinion, that the Trade between
the two Kingdoms cannot be upon an equal Foot, unless the said Duties
and Impositions be the same in <HI>Scotland</HI> as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And this Article respecting a Coast-Trade, it seems reasonable for their
Lordships to insist, That the Master, Mariner and Goods should be un∣der
the same Securities, Penalties and Regulations, as are in that cafe
provided by the Laws in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As to the id Article, it seems reasonable; But their Lordships offer,
that it will be necessary therein to add a Provision, That not only the Im∣positions
on Trade, but the Prohibitions be the same on both Sides, in re∣spect
as well or Importations as Exportations.</P>
<P>As to the 3d Article, Their Lordships say, That the Plantations are the
Property of <HI>English</HI> Men, and that this Trade is of so great a Consequence,
and so beneficial, as not to be communicated, as is proposed till all other
Particulars which shall be thought necessary to this Union be adjusted;
And as the Case now Hands by Law, no European Goods can be carried to
the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, but what have been first: landed in <HI>England,</HI> ex∣cept
Salt, Irish and Scots Provisions, Servants and Horses, Madera Wine, and
Wine of the Azores; nor can the Product of the Plantations be carryed to
other Parts of Europe till it be first landed in <HI>England.</HI> Their Lordships
further offer, That in this Article, it will be necessary to make Provision,
that the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be liable to be pressed for the Sea, in
the same manner as the <HI>English</HI> Subjects are in time of War for Her Maje∣sty's
Service.</P>
<P>As to the 4th Article, Their Lordships agree that an Act of Navigation
must be granted in both Kingdoms adapted to the Terms of the Union.</P>
<P>As Act the 5th Article, their Lordships say, That the Proposals therein∣contained
seems to contradict what was granted by the 2d Article, in as
much as there is no Duty subsisting on Trade (excepting only on some
Funds for the Civil Government) but what is appropriated to the pay∣ment
of the Debts of the Nation; That tho the said Debts have been
contracted by a long war entred into; More particularly for the Preser∣vation
of <HI>England,</HI> and the Dominions thereto belonging; Yet that Scot∣land
has tasted of the Benefites which have accrued to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in
general, From the Opposition that hath been made to the Growth and
Power of France; That such Burdens will be abundantly recompensed to
Scotland by a compleat Union: To which compleat Union as a free
Communication of Trade is essential, so such a tree Communication of
Trade cannot be established with Equality, unless the same Duties both
<PB N="122" REF="734"/>
upon foreign Trade and Home Consumption be levied on both King∣doms:
But how the Sums of Money thereby arising within the said Re∣alm
shall be applyed, or what Equivalent is to be allowed in the Room
thereo may be settled when your Lordships are ready to offer what Pro∣portion
of the publick Burdens <HI>Scotland</HI> proposes to bear towards the fu∣ture
Support of the Government both in times of Peace and War.</P>
<P>As to the 6th Article, their Lordships say, That it requires to be further
explained, before they can be ready to give any answer to it.</P>
<P>After giving in the above Proposals, in answer to the last Proposal
made by <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> desired a Day for a Conference on both
might be appointed, which was accordingly appointed on Saturday next.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Die saturnt 19th December 1702.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commissioners on both Sides had a full Conference upon the Subject
of the Communication of Trade in the foresaids Proposals and An∣swers,
which was very amicable, and their Lordships for <HI>England</HI> agre∣ed
to all the Proposals made by their Lordships for <HI>Scotland;</HI> and a Com∣mittee
was appointed to draw up the Resolutions taken thereupon, to be
offered at their next Meeting on wednesday the 23 instant.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Die Mercurii 23d December 1702,</HEAD>
<P>THE Committee having met to draw up the Result of the Conference of
the 19th Instant, to nave been this day presented to the general Meet∣ing

29th instant.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Die Martis 29th December 1702.</HEAD>
<P>A Quorum of the Scots Commissioners being met at the usual Place of
Meeting, and there not being a Quorum of the <HI>English,</HI> they adjour∣ned
to the 30 instant.</P>
<P>These Frequent Disappointments seeming to denote an Indifferency on
the part of the <HI>English,</HI> the Scots began to signifie their Impatience, so
as severals of them threatned to return to Scotland.</P>

<DIV4>
<PB N="123" REF="735"/>
<HEAD>Die Mercurii 30 December 1702.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commissioners met, and at their taking their Places, the Lord
Keeper said, their Lordships of <HI>England</HI> had taken <HI>Notice</HI> of the
publishing of some of their Proceedings in the Flying-Post, which they
thought not Convenient, and therefore had ordered their Secretary not to
give out any Copies of their Proceedings, and desired their Lordships for
<HI>Scotland</HI> would do the like, which was agreed to. And then</P>
<P>The Lord Keeper offered a Paper, containing the Result of the last Con∣ference
in the Proposals made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> a∣bout
Trade. And the Duke of Q<HI>ueensberry</HI> offered another, which were
both read: The <HI>English</HI> in the following Terms.</P>
<P>Agreed by the Lords Commissioners of both Kingdoms in the terms of
the Preliminaries, and to take effect when the Union shall be compleat∣ed.</P>
<P>1. That there be a free Trade between all the Subjects of the Island of
<HI>Great-Britain,</HI> without any Distinction, in the same manner as is now
practised from one part of <HI>England</HI> to another, and that the Masters, Ma∣riners,
and Goods be under the same Securities and Penalties in the
Coasting-Trade.</P>
<P>2. That both Kingdoms be under the same Regulations and Prohibi∣tions,
and lyable to equal Impositions for Importation and Exportation,
and upon the home Consumption, and that a Book of Rates be adjusted
for both.</P>
<P>3. That the Subjects of both Kingdoms, and their Seamen and Shipping,
have equal Freedom of Trade and Commerce to and from the Plantations,
under such and the same Regulations and Restrictions as are and will be
necessary for preserving the said Trade of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that the
Seamen of <HI>Scotland</HI> be equally lyable to the publick Service, as the Sea∣men
of <HI>England</HI> now are.</P>
<P>4. That such Laws, Part or Parts of the Act of Navigation, or of any
other Law now in force in either Kingdom, as shall be contrary to, or
inconsistent with the Union, shall be on both sides repealed.</P>
<P>The Paper offered by the <HI>Scots</HI> differed only materially from this
in that in the second Article, the Words (and upon the Home
Consumpt) were left out, and so need not to be inserted.</P>
<P>After reading of which, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners withdrew, and return∣ing
within a little, the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> told their Lordships for <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
that they had taken notice of some things in the Paper offered by
their Lordships, which did not seem properly to fall under the Head of
Trade, as the Duties; on Home Consumpt; The <HI>English</HI> insisted that
it did. So it was moved that there should be a Conference on this Mat∣ter
<HI>Saturday</HI> next.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="124" REF="736"/>
<HEAD>Die Saturni Januar. 2. 170 2/3.</HEAD>
<P>AT the Conference the following Articles were agreed on, and ordered
to be insert in the Journals, the <HI>English</HI> having been satisfied that the
Imposition on Home Consumpt should be reserved to a Conference at next
Meeting, which was appointed to be upon <HI>Monday</HI> thereafter.</P>
<P>Agreed by the Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms in the Terms of
the Preliminaries, and to take place when the Union shall be
compleated.</P>
<P>1. That there be a free Trade between all the Subjects of the Island of
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> without any Distinction in the same manner as is now prac∣tised
from one part of <HI>England</HI> to another, and that the Masters, Mari∣ners,
and Goods be under the same Securities and Penalties in the Coast∣ing
Trade.</P>
<P>2. That both Kingdoms be under the same Regulations and Prohibiti∣ons,
and lyable to equal Impositions for Importation and Exportation,
and that a Book of Rates be adjusted for both.</P>
<P>3. That the Subjects of both Kingdoms and their Seamen, and Ship∣ping
have equal Freedom of Trade and Commerce to and from the Plan∣tations,
under such and the same Regulations and Restrictions as are and
will be necessary for preserving the said Trade of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> And
that the Seamen of <HI>Scotland</HI> be equally lyable to the publick Service, as
the Seamen of <HI>England</HI> now are.</P>
<P>4. Such Laws, Part or Parts of the Act of Navigation, or of any other
Law now in force in either Kingdom, as shall be contrary to, or incon∣sistent
with the Terms of the Union, shall be on both sides repealed, and
that an Act of Navigation be framed and adapted to the Terms of the

in relation to the Home Consumpt, in which the <HI>English</HI> seemed
<PB N="125" REF="737"/>
positive, that an Equality of Impositions throughout the united Kingdom
is absolutely necessary, but seemed inclinable to condescend, That <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
should be exempted from all Excises and Duties laid on for payment
of Debts contracted by <HI>England</HI> before the Union, but that <HI>Scotland</HI> should
be subject to such Duties as should be laid on for Exigences after the Uni∣on,

<DIV4>
<HEAD>Die Luneo 18th. Januar. 170 2/3.</HEAD>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> for the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI>
acquainted their Lordships of <HI>England,</HI> That they had drawn up
some Articles, as the Result of their last Conference, in which they
had yielded as much in the several Points therein-mentioned as possibly
they could; Which Articles were read, and taken into Consideration
by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> against the next Meeting, which
was appointed to be upon the 20 instant.</P>
<Q>Follows the Articles offered by the Scots.</Q>
<P>1. That neither Kingdom be burdened with Debts contracted or to be
contracted by the other before the Union, And that no other or greater
Excise or other Duties on Home Consumption, or Inland Taxes be rais∣ed
or imposed within that part of the united Kingdom now called <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
than these now on Foot there, till the Debts of <HI>England</HI> contracted
or to be contracted before the Union be fully satisfied and paid.</P>
<P>2. That after Payment of the <HI>English</HI> Debts as aforesaid, that part of
<HI>Britain</HI> now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be subject to the Survey of the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Great-britain,</HI> and be lyable to such Excise, and other Hom
Duties as shall by the said Parliament be thought just and suitable to
the Circumstances of that part of the united Kingdom for the time; Pro∣vided,
that the Proportion of Inland Duties and Impositions of that part
of the United Kingdom, shall not then or ever after be more than that
of the Neighbouring Counties of the now Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>3. If any Goods or Merchandize of the Native <HI>Product</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>
not
lyable to any Excise or Imposition there, shall be transported from <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
to <HI>England</HI> by Sea or Land, the saids Goods and Merchandice when
brought into <HI>England</HI> shall be lyable to the same Duties, and no other,
which might have been raised or exacted if they had been of the Native
Product of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>4. As an Equivalent to <HI>Scotland</HI> for becoming subject to the same Re∣gulations
with <HI>England</HI> in Export and Import, and for the Encourage∣ment
of Fishing and Trade, and Manufactorie in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That out of
some effectual Branch of the Revenue arising from that part of <HI>Britain</HI>
now called <HI>Scotland</HI> There be 10000 <HI>lib.</HI> yearly after compleating th
Union appropriated towards carrying on the Fisherie, and improving
the Manufactures and Native Product there, as shall be directed and or∣dered
by Commissioners and Trustees to be named for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="738"/>
5. That 48000 <HI>lib.</HI> shall be reckoned as the just Proportion of <HI>Scotland</HI>
in the 4 lib. Rate of Land-Tax, and so proportionally in all Land-Tax∣es
in time coming.</P>

<HEAD>Die Veneris 22. Januar. 170 2/3.</HEAD>
<P>THere not being a <HI>Quorum</HI> of the <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI> being met in
their own Chamber in the <HI>Cock-pit;</HI> The Marquess of <HI>Normanbie</HI> and
Earls of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and <HI>Notinghame</HI> came unto them from such of the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Commissioners as were met in the Council Chamber, to signifie that
they were so much a shamed of the frequent Disappointments they had
given them, That for preventing the like for the future, they had resolved
amongst themselves to apply to Her Majesty for a new Commission under
the Broad Seal, in which Seven might be named a <HI>Quorum.</HI></P>
<P>After these Lords withdrew, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners considered the
Proposition, and having caused read their own Commission, by which
they are authorized to Treat with Commissioneers to be named by Her
Majesty under the Broad-Seal of <HI>England,</HI> their sufficient Number, which
is not specified; They thought themselves sufficiently warranted to Treat
with that Number of the <HI>English</HI> which should be determined by the com∣mission
under the Great-Seal of <HI>England,</HI> and of this they acquainted the
<HI>English</HI> by the Marquess of <HI>Annandal,</HI> Earl of <HI>Seafield</HI> and Viscount of

<P>THE Commissioners being met, the <HI>English</HI> in a new Commission
under the Broad-Seal of <HI>England,</HI> whereby Seven were appointed a
<HI>Quorum;</HI> And the same being read, the Lord Keeper offered in Writ∣ing
the following Considerations upon the Articles, in reference to Home
Consumpt offered by their Lordships of <HI>Scotland</HI> on the 18th: Which
Considerations being read, were by the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners taken into
Consideration till next meeting, which was appointed on the 27th instant,
and a Conference appointed on the 26th instant.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Follows the Considerations offered by the
English.</HEAD>
<P>1. AS to the former part of the first Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That neither Kingdom
be burdened with the Debts contracted, or to be contracted by
the other before the Union, it being the same <HI>in terminis</HI> with the 5th
Proposition delivered by your Lordships on the 9th <HI>December;</HI> the Ob∣servation
made then may suffice for a Reply to it now, <HI>viz.</HI> That tho
the Debts of <HI>England</HI> have been contracted by a long War, entred into
more particularly for the Preservation of <HI>England,</HI> and the Dominions
thereto belonging, yet <HI>Scotland</HI> has had its Share in the Benefits which
<PB N="127" REF="739"/>
have accrued to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in general from the Opposition that has
been made to the Growth and Power of <HI>France,</HI> and have encreased the
Number of their Seamen considerably, by the Imployment they had in the
Coast-Trade of <HI>England</HI> during the War. But as it is necessary they
should be under equal Impositions with regard to the Ballance of Trade,
and Manufactories when the Kingdoms shall be united, and a free Com∣munication
of Native Product settled, so it may be reasonable that the
Money so raised upon that part which is now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> should be
applyed to the Security and Protection of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Trade thereof;
nor does it follow, That because the Duties now raised on particular Funds
in <HI>England</HI> are appropriate for payment of Debts; That therefore when
the like Duties are laid on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they must be applyed in the same
manner, but for their Lordships to propose that there be no other Duty
in <HI>Scotland</HI> than these now on Foot there, till the Debts in <HI>England</HI> con∣tracted,
or to be contracted before the Union be fully satisfied and paid,
setts the present Trade on an equal Foot, (which is intended by an
equality of Impositions) at such a distance, as gives little hopes to any
now alive of coming at it, For one of the nine Pences on Beer and Ale
being the Fund of the first Million <HI>Act, Anno</HI> 4 and 5. of the late King
and Queen, was granted for 99 years; One Nine Pences more (which is
the Fund of the Lottery) for about eight years yet to come; One nine
Pence more (which is the Bank-Fund) Inheritance to the Crown, as are
also the several Duties upon Salt, and half that on Stamped Paper, tho'
in these latter Duties there are Clauses of Provision for Redemption, but
whilst it is insisted, That there shall be no other nor greater in <HI>Scotland</HI>
than are already paid there, it may be presumed that these already men∣tioned,
are enough to prevent the necessity of enquiring into the Number
or Proportion of what they have in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where if by Exemption from
such Duties, a Clothier can subsist himself at 4d per diem, whereas he
cannot subsit in <HI>England</HI> under 8<HI>d per diem;</HI> Then all such Manufactu∣res
who shall go thither, will be able to undersell, and consequently out∣trade
those that stay in <HI>England</HI> half in what relates to their La∣bour,
by subsisting so much cheaper; but the Workmanship of every pound
of Wooll made in Cloth, advances the value of it near Nine Parts in
Ten for its first Cost.</P>
<P>2. As to the second Article, their Lordships say, That Duties upon the
Home Consumption require to be equally laid on all the parts of the U∣nited
Kingdoms; Nor do the Northern countries of <HI>England</HI> pay less
Duties of Excise (as seems here suggested) than the Mid-land, but rather
more in Proportion to the value of their Countries and Commodities ex∣cised.</P>
<P>3. As to the Third Article, it is needless to debate upon it till the first
be settled, these two depending the one upon the other; If indeed the Lords
Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> should think it expedient to exempt Home∣consumption
of <HI>Scotland</HI> from any new Duties for some reasonable Period
of Time, till that Kingdom began to reap the benefite of the free Com∣munication
of Trade intended by the Union, Then their Lordships will
insist, that such Commodities as pay Duties in <HI>England</HI> may be cleared
with the same Duties when they are exported or brought out of <HI>Scotland</HI>
into <HI>England,</HI> &amp; upon some other Provisions which will be requisite to pre∣vent
Frauds in Her Majesties Revenues.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="740"/>
4. As to the 4th Article, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> say,
That the free Communication, especially of the Foreign Trade, to which in
the terms of the Parliaminaries their Lordships have assented, is so great a
Benefite to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they did not expect an Equivalent should have
been mentioned, for the equality of Imposition on Importation and Ex∣portation;
Besides, their Lordships say, your Lordships have already a∣greed
upon an equality of Impositions as to Foreign Trade, both as to Ex∣portation
and Importation.</P>
<P>5. As to th 5th Article, It will be impossible to determine this Point
till their Lordships shall be informed of the value of the Lands in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and this may be further debated when their Members or Representatives
in the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall be settled.</P>

<P>THE Commissioners for the Conserence having met on the 26 Instant,
The <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners thought it best to give Answers in Writ∣ing
to the Considerations offered by the <HI>English,</HI> which might be entred
in the Books with the Considerations, and gave them in accordingly
which prevented the Conference, for the <HI>English</HI> desired to consider the
Answers till next Meeting, which was appointed on the 28 instant.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>Die Jovis 28th Januar. 170 2/3.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commissioners having met, the Lord President on the part of the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> offered the following Paper, as
their Lordships Sense of the Conference at the preceeding Meeting, which
was read as follows.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> agree, that neither Kingdom shall
be burdened with the Debts of the other, contracted before the Union, and
that no Duties on Home Consumption, or Taxes to be Ievyed from <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
shall be applyed for payment of the <HI>English</HI> Debts; and whatever
time may be fit to be allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> to reap the benefite of the Com∣munication
of Trade, and enable them the better to pay Duties on Home
Consumption equal to <HI>England,</HI> is most proper to be determined in the
respective Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Then his Lordship offered on the part of the Lords Commissioners for
<HI>England</HI> an Answer to the Proposition made at the last Meeting by
their Lordships of <HI>Scotland:</HI> Which was read as follows.</P>
<P>As to the last Proposition delivered the 27th Instant, their Lordships
say, It has been found by Experience, That two Companies existing to∣gether
in the same Kingdom, and carrying on the same Traffick, are de∣structive
to Trade, and are therefore of Opinion, that to agree with this
Proposition, will be inconsistent with the Interest of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="741"/>
The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> withdrew to consider these Pa∣pers,
and returning to the Council Chamber, My Lord Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI>
acquainted their Lordships of <HI>England,</HI> That the Lords Commissioners
for <HI>Scotland</HI> would consider their Lordships Answer to their Proposi∣tion
about the Company against the next Meeting; That they had now
prepared for their Lordships what they took to be their Sense of the Pa∣per
they had received from their Lordships, which was read as follows.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> understand the Paper given in
by their Lordships in this Sense; That neither Kingdoms shall be bur∣dened
with the Debts of the other contracted before the Union, and that
no Duties on Home Consumption, or Taxes to be levyed from <HI>Scotland</HI>
shall be applyed to the payment of <HI>English</HI> Debts, and that a Time be al∣lowed
to <HI>Scotland</HI> to reap the Benefite of the Communication of Trade, be∣fore
that Kingdom become lyable to pay other or greater Duties on Home
Consumption, or Inland Taxes, than those now on Foot: And that it
is most proper to be determined by the respective Parliaments of both
Kingdoms how long that Time of Exemption shall subsit: This Paper
their Lordships of <HI>England</HI> took into Consideration against next Meeting.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> moved, That since they were so near agree∣ing
on this Matter, which was only the first of the Articles offered on
the 18th Instant, that they should proceed to the Consideration of the o∣ther
Articles.</P>
<P>And accordingly the 2d of the said Articles was read, and the Consi∣deration
and Answers relative thereto were spoke to by the Lords Com∣missioners
on both sides; But before coming to any Resolution, their
Lordships adjourned to the 30th Instant.</P>

<HEAD>Die Saturni 30th Januar. 170 2/3.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commissioners having met, the Lord President of the Council on
the part of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> acquainted their
Lordships of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they had drawn up an Article in reference to
the matter, which had been the Subject of Conference at the two last Meet∣ings,
which he hoped would give their Lordships full Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The said Article was read, and the saids Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> ha∣ving
withdrawn to consider the same, and returning to the Council-Chamber,
My Lord Duke of Queensberry acquainted their Lordships of
<HI>England,</HI> That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> had agreed to the
Article as given in by their Lordships, understanding their Lordships
Sense of the last Clause to be such, as that it relates to the Length of the
Time to be allowed to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That the said Article be insert in the Journals of this Day, as
agreed on between the Lords Commissioners of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Agreed by the said Commissioners of both Kingdoms, That neither
Kingdom shall be burdened with the Debts of the other contracted before
<PB N="130" REF="742"/>
the Union, and that no Duties on Home Consumption, or Taxes to be
levied from <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be applyed to the Payment of <HI>English</HI> Debts.
And that some time is to be allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> to reap the Benefite of
the Communication of Trade, and enable them the better to pay Duties
on Home Consumption equal to <HI>England,</HI> but that it is most proper to be
determined in the respective Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That the Journals of what has been transacted hitherto be
made ready by the Secretaries, to be read over at the general Meeting,
appointed to be on <HI>Monday</HI> the first of <HI>February.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Die Luneo 1st. Febr. 170 2/3.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners having met, The L. Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> moved
on the part of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland;</HI> That the first of the
Proposals offered on the 18th of <HI>January</HI> being adjusted, they should pro∣ceed
to the Consideration of the other Articles, whereupon the second
and subsequent Articles were read severally, and spoke to by the Lords
Commissioners on both Sides, but their Lordships came to no Resolution
on any of these Articles.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> acquainted the Lords Commissioners for <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
that their Lordships of <HI>Scotland</HI> having considered their Lordships
Answer to their Proposition of the 27th of <HI>January,</HI> about the Company
Trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies;</HI> They did offer to their Lordships the
following Paper, which was read, and taken into Consideration by the
Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> and is as follows.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>By the Lords Commissioners for Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>THeir Lordships do still insist for Preserving and Securing the Privi∣leges
of the <HI>Scots</HI> Company trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> Because
the Undertakers did on the publick Faith of the Kingdom, advance a
Stock of 200000 <HI>lib.</HI> or thereby; And it is not unknown to your Lordships,
what part the Generality of the Kingdom, and also the parliament of
<HI>Scotland</HI> did take in the Discouragements and Disappointments the said
Company did receive, as is fully expressed in the Address of the Parlia∣ment
to the late King.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>2. Their Lordships conceive, That the Privileges of the <HI>Scots</HI> Company
may consist with the <HI>English</HI> East <HI>Indies</HI> Company, or any other <HI>English</HI>
Company which are circumscribed to the present Limits of <HI>England;</HI> And
it is not proposed that the Privileges of the <HI>Scots</HI> Company should be ex∣tended
beyond the Bounds of <HI>Scotland,</HI> so the several Companies do not
Interfere.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If the existing of Companies for carrying on the same Traffick, do
appear to your Lordships destructive of Trade: It is not expected that
your Lordships will insist, that therefore the Privileges of the <HI>Scots</HI> Com∣pany
should be abandon'd, without offering at the same time to purchase
their Right at the publick Expence.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And then they adjourned to <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 3d Instant.</P>

<P>THE Commissioners having met, and there being a <HI>Letter</HI> from the
Queen to Adjourn their Meeting,</P>
<P>In the Name of the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> said; That since Her
Majesty is pleased to adjourn our Meeting, there are something so essen∣tially
necessary to compleat the Union of the two Kingdoms, that we
think our selves obliged to mention them before we part: That on both
sides we may come the better prepared to settle them at our next Meeting,
particularly the Constitution of the Parliament, the Affairs of the Church,
and the Municipal Laws and Judicatories of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Securitie of
the Properties of the Subjects of that Kingdom.</P>
