<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE History of this <HI>Beautiful
Lady,</HI> is to speak for itself:
If it is not as Beautiful as the
Lady herself is reported to be;
if it is not as diverting as the
Reader can desire, and much
more than he can reasonably expect; and if
all the most diverting Parts of it are not a∣dapted
to the Instruction and Improvement of
the Reader, the <HI>Relator says,</HI> it must be from
the Defect of his Performance; dressing up
the Story in worse Cloaths than the <HI>Lady,</HI>
whose Words be speaks, prepar'd it for the
World.</P>
<P>He takes the Liberty to say, That this
Story differs from most of the Modern Per∣formances
of this Kind, tho' some of them
have met with a very good Reception in the
World: I say, It differs from them in this
Great and Essential Article, <HI>Namely,</HI> That
the Foundation of This is laid in Truth of
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>Fact;</HI> and so the Work is not a Story, but a
History.</P>
<P>The Scene is laid so near the Place where
the Main Part of it was transacted, that it
was necessary to conceal Names and Persons;
lest what cannot be yet entirely forgot in that
Part of the Town, shou'd be remember'd, and
the Facts trac'd back too plainly, by the many
People yet living, who wou'd know the Per∣sons
by the Particulars.</P>
<P>It is not always necessary that the Names
of Persons shou'd be discover'd, tho' the Hi∣story
may be many Ways useful; and if we
shou'd be always oblig'd to name the Persons,
or not to relate the Story, the Consequence
might be only this, That many a pleasant
and delightful History wou'd be Buried in the
Dark, and the World be depriv'd both of the
Pleasure and the Profit of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Writer</HI> says, He was particularly ac∣quainted
with this Lady's First Husband, the
<HI>Brewer,</HI> and with his Father; and also,
with his Bad Circumstances; and knows that
first Part of the Story to be Truth.</P>
<P>This may, he hopes, be a Pledge for the
Credit of the rest, tho' the Latter Part of
her History lay Abroad, and cou'd not so well
be vouch'd as the First; yet, as she has told
it herself, we have the less Reason to que∣stion
the Truth of that Part also.</P>
<P>In the Manner she has told the Story, it
is evident she does not insist upon her Justifi∣cation
<PB REF="4"/>
in any one Part of it; much less does
she recommend her Conduct, or indeed, any
Part of it, except her Repentance to our
Imitation: On the contrary, she makes fre∣quent
Excursions, in a just censuring and
condemning her own Practice: How often
does she reproach herself in the most passi∣onate
Manner; and guide us to just Re∣flections
in the like Cases?</P>
<P>It is true, She met with unexpected Suc∣cess
in all her wicked Courses; but even in
the highest Elevations of her Prosperity, she
makes frequent Acknowledgments, That the,
Pleasure of her Wickedness was not worth
the Repentance; and that all the Satisfaction
she had, all the Joy in the View of her Pros∣perity,
no, nor all the Wealth she rowl'd in;
the Gayety of her Appearance; the Equi∣pages,
and the Honours, she was attended
with, cou'd quiet her Mind, abate the Re∣proaches
of her Conscience, or procure her
an Hour's Sleep, when just Reflections kept
her waking.</P>
<P>The Noble Inferences that are drawn
from this one Part, are worth all the rest of
the Story; and abundantly justifie (as they
are the profess'd Design of) the Publica∣tion.</P>
<P>If there are any Parts in her Story, which
being oblig'd to relate a wicked Action, seem
to describe it too plainly, the <HI>Writer</HI> says, all
imaginable Care has been taken to keep clear of
<PB REF="5"/>
Indecencies, and immodest Expressions; and
'tis hop'd you will find nothing to prompt a vi∣cious
Mind, but every-where much to discou∣rage
and expose it.</P>
<P>Scenes of Crime can scarce be represented
in such a Manner, but some way make a Cri∣minal
Use of them; but when Vice is painted
in its Low-priz'd Colours, 'tis not to make
People in love with it, but to expose it; and if
the Reader makes a wrong Use of the Figures,
the Wickedness is his own.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Advantages of the
present Work are so great, and the Virtuous
Reader has room for so much Improvement,
that we make no Question, the Story, how∣ever
meanly told, will find a Passage to his
best Hours; and be read both with Profit and
Delight.</P>

<HEAD>THE
Fortunate Mistress:
OR, A
HISTORY
OF
The Life, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Was BORN, <HI>as my Friends told me,</HI>
at the City of POICTIERS, in the
Province, or County of POICTOU,
in <HI>France,</HI> from whence I was brought
to <HI>England</HI> by my Parents, who fled
for their Religion about the Year 1683, when
the Protestants were Banish'd from <HI>France</HI> by the
Cruelty of their Persecutors.</P>
<P>I, who knew little or nothing of what I was
brought over hither for, was well-enough pleas'd
with being here; <HI>London,</HI> a large and gay City,
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
took with me mighty well, who, from my being
a Child; lov'd a Crowd, and to see a great-many
fine Folks.</P>
<P>I retain'd nothing of <HI>France,</HI> but the Language:
My Father and Mother being People of better
Fashion, than ordinarily the People call'd REFU∣GEES
at that Time were; and having fled early,
while it was easie to secure their Effects, had, be∣fore
their coming over, remitted considerable Sums
of Money, or, <HI>as I remember,</HI> a considerable Va∣lue
in <HI>French</HI> Brandy, Paper, and other Goods;
and these selling very much to Advantage here,
my Father was in very good Circumstances at his
coming over, so that he was far from applying
to the rest of our Nation that were here, for
Countenance and Relief: On the contrary, he had
his Door continually throng'd with miserable Ob∣jects
of the poor starving Creatures, who at that
Time fled hither for Shelter, on Account of Con∣science,
<HI>or something else.</HI></P>
<P>I have indeed, heard my Father say, That he
was pester'd with a great-many of those, who, <HI>for
any Religion they had,</HI> might e'en have stay'd where
they were, but who flock'd over hither in Droves,
for what they call in <HI>English,</HI> a Livelihood; here∣ing
with what Open Arms the REFUGEES were
receiv'd in <HI>England,</HI> and how they fell readily into
Business, being, by the charitable Assistance of the
People in <HI>London,</HI> encourag'd to Work in their Ma∣nufactures,
in <HI>Spittle-Fields, Canterbury,</HI> and other
Places; and that they had a much better Price for
their Work, than in <HI>France, and the like.</HI></P>
<P>My Father, <HI>I say, told me,</HI> That he was more
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the Clamours of these People, than
of those who were truly REFUGEES, and fled
in Distress, <HI>merely for C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nscience.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="8"/>
I was about ten Years old when I was brought
over hither, where, <HI>as I have said,</HI> my Father liv'd
in very good Circumstances, and died in about
eleven Years more; in which time, as I had ac∣complish'd
myself for the sociable Part of the
World, so I had acquainted myself with some of
our <HI>English</HI> Neighbours, as is the Custom in <HI>Lon∣don;</HI>
and as, while I was Young, I had pick'd-up
three or four Play-Fellows and Companions, suita∣ble
to my Years; so as we grew bigger, we learnt
to call one-another Intimates and Friends; and
this forwarded very much the finishing me for
Conversation, and the World.</P>
<P>I went to <HI>English</HI> Schools, and being young, I
learnt the <HI>English</HI> Tongue perfectly well, with all the
Customs of the <HI>English</HI> Young-Women; so that I
retain'd nothing of the <HI>French,</HI> but the Speech; nor
did I so much as keep any Remains of the <HI>French</HI>
Language tagg'd to my Way of Speaking, <HI>as most
Foreigners do,</HI> but spoke what we call Natural <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
as if I had been born here.</P>
<P>Being to give my own Character, I must be ex∣cus'd
to give it as impartially as possible, and as
if I was speaking of another-body; <HI>and the Se∣quel
will lead you to judge whether I flatter myself
or no.</HI></P>
<P>I was (<HI>speaking of myself as about Fourteen Years
of Age</HI>) tall, and very well made; sharp as a
Hawk in Matters of common Knowledge; quick
and smart in Discourse; apt to be Satyrical;
full of Repartee, and a little too forward in Con∣versation;
or, as we call it in <HI>English,</HI> BOLD,
tho' perfectly Modest in my Behaviour. Being
<HI>French</HI> Born, I danc'd, <HI>as some say,</HI> naturally, lov'd
it extremely, and sung well also, and so well, that,
<HI>as you will hear,</HI> it was afterwards some Advantage
to me: With all these Things, I wanted neither
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
Wit, Beauty, or Money. In this Manner I set out
into the World, having all the Advantages that
any Young Woman cou'd desire, to recommend
me to others, and form a Prospect of happy Li∣ving
to myself.</P>
<P>At about Fifteen Years of Age, my Father gave
me, <HI>as he call'd it in</HI> French, 25000 Livres, <HI>that
is to say,</HI> two Thousand Pounds portion, and mar∣ried
me to an Eminent Brewer in the City; <HI>par∣don
me if I conceal his Name, for tho' he was the
Foundation of my Ruin, I cannot take so severe a Re∣venge
upon him.</HI></P>
<P>With this Thing call'd a Husband, I liv'd
eight Years in good Fashion, and for some Part
of the Time, kept a Coach, <HI>that is to say,</HI> a kind
of Mock-Coach; for all the Week the Horses
were kept at Work in the Dray-Carts, but on
<HI>Sunday</HI> I had the Privilege to go Abroad in my
Chariot, either to Church, or otherways, as my
Husband and I cou'd agree about it; which, <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the way,</HI> was not very often: But of that here∣after.</P>
<P>Before I proceed in the History of the Marry'd
Part of my Life, you must allow me to give as
impartial an Account of my Husband, as I have
done of myself: He was a jolly, handsome Fel∣low,
as any Woman need wish for a Companion;
tall, and well made; rather a little too large, but
not so as to be ungentile; he danc'd well, which,
<HI>I think,</HI> was the first thing that brought us to∣gether:
He had an old Father, who manag'd the
Business carefully, so that he had little of that
Part lay on him, but now-and-then to appear, and
show himself; and he took the Advantage of it,
for he troubl'd himself very little about it, but
went Abroad, kept Company, hunted much, and
lov'd it exceedingly.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10"/>
After I have told you that he was a Handsome
Man, and a good Sportsman, I have, indeed, said
all; and unhappy was I, like other young Peo∣ple
of our Sex, I chose him for being a hand∣some,
jolly Fellow, as I have said; for he was o∣therwise
a weak, empty-headed, untaught Crea∣ture,
as any Woman could ever desire to be cou∣pled
with: And here I must take the Liberty,
whatever I have to reproach myself with in my
after-Conduct, to turn to my Fellow-Creatures,
the Young Ladies of this Country, and speak to
them, by way of Precaution, If you have any
Regard to your future Happiness any View of
living comfortably with a Husband; any Hope
of preserving your Fortunes, or restoring them af∣ter
any Disaster; Never, Ladies, marry a Fool;
any Husband rather than a Fool; with some o∣ther
Husbands you may be unhappy, but with a
Fool you will be miserable; with another Hus∣band
you <HI>may,</HI> I say, be unhappy, but with a
Fool you <HI>must;</HI> nay, if he wou'd, he cannot make
you easie; every thing he does is so awkward,
every thing he says is so empty, a Woman of
any Sence cannot but be surfeited, and sick of
him twenty times a-Day: What is more shock∣ing,
than for a Woman to bring a handsome,
comely Fellow of a Husband, into Company, and
then be oblig'd to Blush for him every time she
hears him speak? To hear other Gentlemen talk
Sence, and he able to say nothing? And so look
like a Fool, or, which is worse, hear him talk
Nonsence, and be laugh'd at for a Fool.</P>
<P>In the next Place, there are so many Sorts of
Fools, such an infinite Variety of Fools, and
so hard it is to know the Worst of the Kind,
that I am oblig'd to say, No Fool, Ladies, at
all, no kind of Fool; whether a mad Fool, or a
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
sober Fool, a wise Fool, or a silly Fool; take a∣ny
thing but a Fool; <HI>nay, be</HI> any thing, be even
an Old Maid, the worst of Nature's Curses, rather
than take up with a Fool.</P>
<P>But to leave this a-while, for I shall have Occa∣sion
to speak of it again my Case was particu∣larly
hard, for I had a Variety of foolish Things
complicated in this unhappy Match.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> and which, I must confess, is very unsuf∣ferable,
he was a conceited Fool, <HI>Tout Opiniatre,</HI>
every thing he said, was Right, was Best, and was
to the Purpose, whoever was in Company, and
whatever was advanc'd, by others, tho' with the
greatest Modesty imaginable; and yet when he
came to defend what he had said, by Argument
and Reason, he would do it so weakly, so emptily,
and so nothing to the Purpose, that it was enough
to make any-body that heard him, sick and a∣sham'd
of him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He was positive and obstinate, and
the most positive in the most simple and in∣consistent
Things, such as were intollerable to
bear.</P>
<P>These two Articles, if there had been no more,
qualified him to be a most unbearable Creature
for a Husband, and so it may be suppos'd at first
Sight, what a kind of Life I led with him:
However, I did as well as I could, and held my
Tongue, which was the only Victory I gain'd
over him; for when he would talk after his
own empty rattling Way with me, and I would
not answer, or enter into Discourse with him
on the Point he was upon, he would rise up in
the greatest Passion imaginable, and go away;
which was the cheapest Way I had to be deli∣ver'd.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12"/>
I could enlarge here much, upon the Method I
took to make my Life passable and easie with the
most incorrigible Temper in the World; but it is
too long, and the Articles too trifling: I shall
mention some of them as the Circumstances I am
to relate, shall necessarily bring, them in.</P>
<P>After I had been Married about four Years,
my own Father died, my Mother having been
dead before; he lik'd my Match so ill, and saw
so little Room to be satisfied with the Conduct
of my Husband, that tho' he left me 5000 Li∣vres,
and more at his Death, yet he left it in the
Hands of my Elder Brother, who running on too
rashly in his Adventures, as a Merchant, fail'd,
and lost not only what he had, but what he had
for me too; as you shall hear presently.</P>
<P>Thus I lost the last Gift of my Father's Bounty,
by having a Husband not fit to be trusted with
it; there's one of the Benefits of marrying a Fool.</P>
<P>Within two Years after my own Father's Death,
my Husbands Father also died, and, as I thought,
left him a considerable Addition to his Estate, the
whole Trade of the Brewhouse, which was a very
good one, being now his own.</P>
<P>But this Addition to his Stock was his Ruin,
for he had no Genius to Business; he had no
Knowledge of his Accounts; he bustled a little
about; it indeed, at first, and put on a Face of
Business, but he soon grew flack it was below him
to inspect his Books, he committed all that to his
Clerks and Book-Keepers; and while he sound
Money in Cash to pay the Malt-Man, and the
Excie, and put fome in his Pocket, he was perfect∣ly
easie and indolent, let the main Chance go how
it would.</P>
<P>I foresaw the Consequence of this, and at∣tempted
several times to perswade him to apply
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
himself to his Business I put him in Mind how
his Customers complain'd of the Neglect of his
Servants on one hand, and how abundance Broke
in his Debt, on the other hand, for want of the
Clerk's Care to secure him, <HI>and the like;</HI> but he
thrust me by, either with hard Words, or fraudu∣lently,
with representing the Cases otherwise than
they were.</P>
<P>However, to cut short a dull Story, which
ought not to be long, he began to find his Trade
sunk, his Stock declin'd, and that, in short, he
could not carry on his Business, and once or twice
his Brewing Utensils were extended for the Ex∣cise;
and the last Time he was put to great Extre∣mities
to clear them.</P>
<P>This allarm'd him, and he resolv'd to lay down
his Trade; which, indeed, I was not sorry for;
foreseeing that if he did not lay it down in Time;
he would be forc'd to do it another Way, namely,
as a Bankrupt. Also I was willing he should draw
out while he had something left, left should come
to be stript at Home, and be turn'd out of Doors
with my Children; for I had now five Children
by him; the only Work (perhaps) that Fools are
good for.</P>
<P>I thought myself happy when he got another
Man to take his Brewhouse clear off of his Hands;
for paying down a large Sum of Money, my
Husband found himself a clear Man, all his Debts
Paid, and with between Two and Three Thou∣sand
Pound in his Pocket; and being now o∣blig'd
to remove from the Brewhouse, we took a
House at—, a Village about two Miles out of
Town; and happy I thought myself, all things
consider'd, that I was got off clear, upon so good
Terms; and had my handsome Fellow had but one
Cap full or Wit, I had been still well enough.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14"/>
I propos'd to him either to buy some Place with
the Money, or with Part of it, and offer'd to
join my Part to it, which was then in Being, and
might have been secur'd; so we might have
liv'd tollerably, at least, during his Life. But as
it is the Part of a Fool to be void of Council, so
he neglected it, liv'd on as he did before, kept his
Horses and Men, rid every Day out to the Fo∣rest
a Hunting, and nothing was done all this
while; but the Money decreas'd apace, and I
thought I saw my Ruin hastening on, without any
possible Way to prevent it.</P>
<P>I was not wanting with all that Perswasions
and Entreaties could perform, but it was all fruit∣less;
representing to him how fast our Mo∣ney
wasted, and what would be our Condition
when it was gone, made no Impression on him:
but like one stupid, he went on, not valuing all
that Tears and Lamentations could be suppos'd.
to do; nor did he abate his Figure or Equi∣page,
his Horses or Servants, even to the last;
till he had not a Hundred Pound left in the whole
World.</P>
<P>It was not above three Years that all the Rea∣dy-Money
was thus spending off; yet he spent
it, as I may say, foolishly too, for he kept no
valuable Company neither but; generally with
Huntsmen and Horse-Coursers, and Men meaner
than himself which is another Consequence of
a Man's being a Fool; such can never take De∣light
in Men more wise and capable than them∣selves;
and that makes them converse with Scoun∣drels,
drink Belch with Porters, and keep Company
always below themselves.</P>
<P>This was my wretched Condition, when one
Morning my Husband told me, he was sen∣sible
he was come to a miserable Condition, and
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
he would go and seek his Fortune somewhere or
other; he had said something to that Purpose
several times before that, upon my pressing him to
consider his Circumstances, and the Circumstan∣ces
of his Family before it should be too late: But
as I found he had no Meaning in any thing of
that Kind, as indeed, he had not much in any
thing he ever said; so I thought they were but
Words of Course now: When he said he wou'd
be gone, I us'd to wish secretly, and even say in my
Thoughts, <HI>I wish you wou'd, for if you go on thus,
you will starve us all.</HI></P>
<P>He staid, however, at home all that Day, and
day at home that Night; early the next Morning
he gets out of Bed, goes to a Window which
look'd out towards the Stables, and founds his
<HI>French</HI> Hom, as he called it; which was his usual
Signal to call his Men to go out a hunting.</P>
<P>It was about the latter-end of <HI>August,</HI> and so
was light yet at five a-Clock, and it was about
that Time that I heard him and his two Men go
out and shut the Yard-Gates after them. He said
nothing to me more than as usual when he us'd
to go out upon his Sport neither did I rise, or
say any thing to him that was material, but went
to-sleep again after he was gone, for two Hours, or
thereabouts.</P>
<P>It must be a little surprizing to the Reader to
tell him at once, that after this, I never saw my
Husband more; but to go farther, I not only ne∣ver
saw him more, but I never heard from him, or
of him, neither of any or either of his two Ser∣vants,
or of the Horses, either what became of
them, where, or which Way they went, or what
they did, or intended to do, no more than if the
Ground had open'd and swall'd them all up,
and no-body had known it; except as hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16"/>
I was not, for the first Night or two, at-all
surpriz'd, no nor very much the first Week or
two, believing that if anything Evil had befallen
them, I should soon enough have heard of that;
and also knowing that as he had two Servants and
three Horses with him, it would be the strangest
Thing in the World that any thing could befal
them all, but that I must some time or other hear
of them.</P>
<P>But you will easily allow, that as Time run on a
Week, two Weeks, a Month, two Months, and so
on, I was dreadfully frighted at last, and the more
when I look'd into my own Circumstances, and
consider'd the Condition in which I was left;
with five Children, and not one Farthing Sub∣stance
for them, other than about seventy Pound
in Money, and what few Things of Value I had
about me, which, tho' considerable in themselves,
were yet nothing to feed a Family, and for a
length of Time too.</P>
<P>What to do I knew not, nor to whom to have
recourse; to keep in the House where I was, I
could not, the Rent being too great; and to leave
it without his Order, if my Husband should re∣turn,
I could not think of that neither; so that I
continued extremely perplex'd, melancholly, and
discourag'd, to the last Degreec.</P>
<P>I remain'd in this dejected Condition near a
Twelvemonth. My Husband had two Sisters,
who were married, and liv'd very well, and some
other near Relations that I knew of, and I hop'd
would do something for me; and I frequently
sent to these, to know if they could give me any
Account of my vagrant Creature; but they all
declared to me in Answer, That they knew no∣thing
about him; and after frequent sending,
began to think me troublesome, and to let me
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
know they thought so too, by their treating my
Maid with very slight and unhandsome Returns
To her Inquiries.</P>
<P>This grated hard, and added to my Affliction,
but I had no recourse but to my Tears, for I had
not a Friend of my own left me in the World:
I should have observ'd, that it was about
half a Year before this Elopement of my Hus∣band,
that the Disaster I mention'd above be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el
my Brother; who Broke, and that in such bad
Circumstances, that I had the Mortification to
hear not only that he was in Prison, but that
there would be little or nothing to be had by
Way of Composition.</P>
<P>Misfortunes seldom come alone: This was the
Forerunner of my Husband's Flight; and as my
Expectations were cut off on that Side, my Hus∣band
gone, and my Family of Children on my
Hands, and nothing to subsist them, my Condi∣tion
was the most deplorable that Words can ex∣press.</P>
<P>I had some Plate and some Jewels, as might
be supposed, my Fortune and former Circum∣stances
consider'd; and my Husband, who had
never staid to be distress'd, had not been put to
the Necessity of rifling me, as Husbands usually
do in such Cases: But as I had seen an End of
all the Ready-Money, during the long Time I
had liv'd in a State of Expectation for my Hus∣band,
so I began to make away one Thing after
another, till those few Things of Value which I
had, began to lessen apace, and I saw nothing but
Misery and the utmost Distress before me, even
to have my Children starve before my Face; I
leave any one that is a Mother of Children, and
has liv'd in Plenty and good Fashion, to consider
and reflect, what must be my Condition: As to
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
my Husband, I had now no Mope or Expectation
of seeing him any more; and, indeed, if I had,
he was the Man, of all the Men in the World, the
least able to help me, or to have turn'd his hand
to the gaining one Shilling towards lessening our
Distress; he neither had the Capacity or the In∣clination;
he could have been no Clerk, for he
scarce wrote a legible Hand; he was so far from
being able to write Sence, that he could not
make Sence of what others wrote; he was so far
from understanding good <HI>English,</HI> that he could
not spell good <HI>English:</HI> To be out of all Business
was his Delight; and he wou'd stand leaning a∣gainst
a Post for half an Hour together, with a Pipe
in his Mouth, with all the Tranquillity in the
World, smoaking, like Dryden's <HI>Countryman that
Whistled as he went, for want of Thought;</HI> and this
even when his Family was, as it were starving,
that little be had wasting, and that we were all
bleeding to Death; he not knowing, and as little
considering, where to get another Shilling when
the last was spent.</P>
<P>This being his Temper, and the Extent of his
Capacity, I confess I did not see so much Loss in
his parting with me, as at first I thought I did;
tho' it was hard and cruel, to the last Degree in
him, not giving me the least Notice of his De∣sign;
and, indeed, that which I was most asto∣nish'd
at, was, that seeing he must certainly have
intended this Excursion some few Moments at
least, before he put it in Practice, yet he did
not come and take what little Stock of Money
we had left; or at least, a Share of it, to bear
his Expence for a little while, but he did not;
and I am morally certain he had not five Guineas
with him in the World, when he went away I
All that I could come to the Knowledge of, about
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
him, was, that he left his Hunting-Horn, which he
call'd the <HI>French</HI> Horn, in the Stable, and his
Hunting Saddle, went away in a handsome Fur∣niture,
as they call it, which he used sometimes
to Travel with; having an embroidered Housing,
a Case of Pistols, and other things belonging to
them; and one of his Servants had another Sad∣dle
with Pistols, though plain; and the other a
long Gun; so that they did not go out as Sports∣men,
but rather as Travellers; What Part of
the World they went to, I never heard for ma∣ny
Years.</P>
<P>As I have said, I sent to his Relations, but
they sent me short and surly Answers; nor did
any one of them offer to come to see me, or to
see the Children, or so much as to enquire after
them, well perceiving that I was in a Condition,
that was likely to be soon troublesome to them:
But it was no Time now to dally with them, or
with the World; I left off sending to them, and
went myself among them; laid my Circumstances
open to them, told them my whole Case, and the
Condition I was reduc'd to, begg'd they would
advise me what Course to take, laid myself as
low as they could desire, and intreated them to.
consider that I was not in a Condition to help my∣self
and that without some Assistance, we must
all inevitably perish: I told them, that if I had
had but one Child, or two Children, I would
have done my Endeavour to have work'd for
them with my Needle, and should only have
come to them to beg them to help me to some
Work, that I might get our Bread by my La∣bour;
but to think of one single Woman not
bred to Work, and at a Loss where to get Em∣ployment,
to get the Bread of five Children, that
was not possible, some of my Children being
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
young too, and none of them big enough, to help
one another.</P>
<P>It was all one, I receiv'd not one Farthing of
Assistance from any-body, was hardly ask'd to sit
down at the two Sisters Houses, nor offered to
Eat or Drink at two more near Relations. The
Fifth, an Ancient Gentlewoman, Aunt-in-Law
to my Husband, a Widow, and the least able
also of any of the rest, did, indeed, ask me to
sit down, gave me a Dinner, and refresh'd me
with a kinder Treatment than any of the rest;
but added the melancholly Part, <HI>viz.</HI> That she
would have help'd me, but that, indeed, she was
not able which, however, I was satisfied was
very true.</P>
<P>Here I reliev'd myself with the constant As∣sistant
of the Afflicted, I mean Tears; for, rela∣ting
to her how I was received by the other of
my Husband's Relations, it made me burst into
Tears, and I cry'd vehemently for a great while
together, till I made the good old Gentlewoman
cry too several times.</P>
<P>However, I came home from them all without
any Relief, and went on at home till I was re∣duc'd
to such inexpressible Distress, that it is not
to be describ'd: I had been several times after
this at the old Aunt's for I prevail'd with her
to promise me to go and talk with the other
Relations at least, that, if possible, she could
bring some of them to take off the Children,
or to contribute something towards their Main∣tenance;
and, to do her Justice, she did use her
Endeavour with them, but all was to no Pur∣pose,
they would do nothing, at least that Way:
I think, with much Entreaty, she obtain'd by a
kind of Collection among them all, about eleven
or twelve Shillings in Money; which, tho' it was a
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
present Comfort, was yet not to be nam'd as capa∣ble
to deliver me from any Part of the Load that
lay upon me.</P>
<P>There was a poor Woman that had been a kind
of a Dependant upon our Family, and who I had
often, among the rest of the Relations, been very
kind to; my Maid put it into my Head one
Morning to send to this poor Woman, and to see
whether she might not be able to help, in this
dreadful Case.</P>
<P>I must remember it here, to the Praise of this poor
Girl, my Maid, that tho' I was not able to give her
any Wages, and had told her so, nay I was not able
to pay her the Wages that I was in Arrears to her, yet
she would not leave me; nay, and as long as she
had any Money, when I had none, the would help
me out of her own; for which, tho' I acknowleg'd
her Kindness and Fidelity, yet it was but a bad Coin
that she was paid in at last, as will appear in its Place.</P>
<P><HI>AMY,</HI> (for that was her Name) put it into
my Thoughts to send for this poor Woman to
come to me, for I was now in great Distress, and
I resolv'd to do so; but just the very Morning that
I intended it, the old Aunt, with the poor Wo∣man
in her Company, came to see me; the good
old Gentlewoman was, it seems, heartily concern'd
for me, and had been talking again among those
People, to see what she could do for me; but to
very little Purpose.</P>
<P>You shall judge a little of my present Distress
by the Posture she found me in: I had five lit∣tle
Children, the Eldest was under ten Years
old, and I had not one Shilling in the House to
buy them Victuals, but had sent <HI>Amy</HI> out with
a Silver Spoon, to sell it, and bring home some
thing from the Butcher's; and I was in a Par∣lour,
sitting on the Ground, with a great Heap
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
of old Rags, Linnen, and other things about me,
looking them over, to see if I had any thing among
them that would Sell or Pawn for a little Money,
and had been crying ready to burst myself, to think
what I should do next.</P>
<P>At this Juncture they knock'd at the Door, I
thought it had been <HI>Amy,</HI> so I did not rise up,
but one of the Children open'd the Door, and
they came directly into the Room where I was, and
where they found me in that Posture, and crying
vehemently, as above I was surpriz'd at their co∣ming,
you may be sure especially seeing the Person
I had but just before resolv'd to send for: But
when they saw me; how I look'd, for my Eyes
were swell'd with crying, and what a Condition
I was in as to the House, and the Heaps of Things
that were about me, and especially when I told
them what I was doing, and on what Occasion,
they sat down like <HI>Job</HI>'s three Comforters, and
said not one Word to the for a great while, but
both of them cry'd as fast, and as heartily as I did.</P>
<P>The Truth was, there was no Need of much
Discourse in the Case, the Thing spoke it self;
they saw me in Rags and Dirt, who was but a
little before riding in my Coach; thin, and look∣ing
almost like one Starv'd, who was before fat
and beautiful: The House, that Was before hand∣somely
furnish'd with pictures and Ornaments,
Cabinets, Peir-Glasses, and every thing suita∣ble,
was now stripp'd, and naked, most of the
Goods having been seiz'd by the Landlord for
Rent, or sold to buy Necessaries; in a word, all
was Misery and Distress, the Face of Ruin was
every where to be seen; we had eaten up almost e∣very
thing, and little remain'd, unless, like one of
the pitiful Women of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> I should cat up
my very Children themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="23"/>
After these two good Creatures had sat, as I
say, in Silence some time, and had then look'd
about them, my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> came in, and brought
with her a small Breast of Mutton, and two great
Bunches of Turnips, which she intended to stew
for our Dinner: As for me, my Heart was so
overwhelm'd at seeing these two Friends, for such
they were, tho' poor, and at their seeing me in
such a Condition, that I fell into another violent
Fit of Crying; so that, in short, I could not speak
to them again for a great while longer.</P>
<P>During my being in such an Agony, they went
to my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> at another Part of the same
Room, and talk'd with her: <HI>Amy</HI> told them all
my Circumstances, and set them forth in such
moving Terms, and so to the Life, that I could not
upon any Terms have done it like her myself, and
in a Word, affected them both with it in such a
manner, that the old Aunt came to me, and tho'
hardly able to speak for Tears: Look ye, Cousin,
said she, in a few Words, Things must not stand
thus; some Course must be taken, and that forth∣with;
pray where were these Children born? I
told her the Parish where we liv'd before, that four
of them were born there; and one in the House
where I now was, where the Landlord, after ha∣ving
sieiz'd my Goods for the Rent past not then
knowing my Circumstances, had now given me leave
to live for a whole Year more without any Rent,
being moved with Compassion; but that this
Year was now almost expir'd.</P>
<P>Upon hearing this Account, they came to this
Resolution: That the Children should be all car∣ried
by them to the Door of one of the Relati∣ons
mention'd above, and be set down there by
the Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and that I, the Mother, should
remove for some Days, shut up the Doors, and
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
be gone; that the People should be told, That if
they did not think fit to to take some Care ofthe
Children, they might send for the Church-Wardens
if they thought that, better; for that they were
born in that Parish, and there they must be provi∣ded
for; as for the other Child which was born
in the Parish of—, that was already taken Care
of by the Parish-Officers there; for, indeed, they
were so sensible of the Distress of the Family, that
they had, at first Word, done what was their Part
to do.</P>
<P>This was what these good Women propos'd,
and bade me leave the rest to them. I was at
first, sadly afflicted at the Thoughts of parting
with my Children, and especially at that ter∣rible
thing, their being taken, into the Parish-keep∣ing;
and then a hundred terrible things came
into my Thoughts; <HI>viz.</HI> of Parish-Children being
Starv'd at Nurse; of their being ruin'd, let grow
crooked, lam'd, and the like, for want of being
taken care of; and this sunk my very Heart with∣in
me.</P>
<P>But the Misery of my own Circumstance hard∣ned
my Heart against my own Flesh and Blood;
and when I consider'd they must inevitably be
Starv'd, and I too, if I continued to keep them
about me, I began to be reconcil'd to parting
with them all, any how, and any where, that I
might be freed from the dreadful Necessity of see∣ing
them all perish, and perishing with them my∣self:
So I agreed to go away out of the House,
and leave the Management of the whole Matter to
my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and to them, and accordingly I
did so; and the same Afternoon they carried them
all away to one of their <HI>Aunts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> a resolute Girl, knock'd at the Door,
with the Children all with her, and bade the
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
Eldest, as soon as the Door was open run in, and
the rest after her: She set them all down at the
Door before she knocked, and when she knock'd,
she staid till a Maid-Servant came to the Door;
Sweetheart, said she, pray go in and tell your
Mistrese, here are her little Coufins come to see
her from—, naming the Town where we
liv'd, at which the Maid offer'd to go back: Here
Child, says <HI>Amy,</HI> take one of 'em in your Hand,
And I'll bring the rest; so she gives her the least,
And the Wench goes in mighty innocently, with
the Little One in her Hand, upon which <HI>Amy</HI> turns
the rest in after her, shuts the Door softly, and
marches off as fast as she cou'd.</P>
<P>Just in the Interval of this, and even while the
Maid and her Mistrese were quarrelling, for the
Mistress rav'd and scolded at her like a Mad∣Woman,
and had ordered her to go and stop the
Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and turn all the Children out of the
Doors again; but she had been at the Door, and
<HI>Amy</HI> was gone, and the Wench, was out of her
Wits, and the Mistress too: I say, just at this
Juncture came die poor old Woman, not the Aunt,
But the other of the two that had been with me,
and knocks at the Door; the Aunt did not go,
because she had pretended to Advocate for me,
and they would have suspected her of some Con∣trivance;
but as for the other Woman, they did
not so much as know that she had kept up any
Correspondence with me.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> and she had concerted this between them,
and it was well enough contriv'd that they did so
When she came into the House, the Mistress was
suming and raging like one Distracted, and cal∣ling
the Maid all the foolish Jades and Sluts that
she could think of, and that she would take the
Children and turn them all out into the Streets.
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
The good poor Woman seeing her in such a Pas∣sion,
turn'd about as if she would be gone again,
and said, Madam, I'll come again another time,
I see you are engag'd. No, no, Mrs.—, says
the Mistress, I am not much engaged, sit down:
This senseless Creature here has brought in, my
Fool of a Brother's whole House of Children
upon me, and tells me, that a Wench brought
them to the Door, and thrust them in, and bade
her carry them to me; but it shall be no Di∣sturbance
to me, for I have order'd them to be
set in the Street, without the Door, and so let the
Church-Wardens take Care of them, or else make
this dull Jade carry 'em back to—again,
and let her that brought them, into the World,
look after them if she will; what does she send
her Bratts to me for?.</P>
<P>The last, indeed, had been the best of the two,
says the Poor Woman, if it had been to be done,
and that brings me to tell you my Errand, and
the Occasion of my coming, for I came on pur∣pose
about this very Business, and to have prevent∣ed
this being put upon you, if I cou'd; but I see
I am come too late.</P>
<P>How do you mean too late, says the Mistress?
What, have you been concern'd in this Affair
then? What, have you help'd bring this Family∣Slur
upon us? I hope you do not think such a
thing of me, Madam, says the poor Woman; but
I went this Morning to—, to see my old Mi∣stress
and Benefactor, for she had been very kind to
me, and when I came to the Door, I found all fast
lock'd mid bolted, and the House looking as if no∣body
was at Home.</P>
<P>I knock'd at the Door, but no-body came, till
at last some of the Neighbours Servants call'd to
me and said, There's no-body lives there, Mi∣stress,
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
what do you knock for? I seem'd surpriz'd
at that: What, no-body live there! <HI>said I,</HI> what
d' ye mean! Does not Mrs.—live there? The
Answer was, No, she is gone; at which I parly'd
with one of them, and ask'd her what was the
Matter; Matter, says she, why 'tis Matter enough,
the poor Gentlewoman has liv'd there all alone,
and without any thing to subsist her, a long time,
and this Morning the Landlord turn'd her out of
Doors.</P>
<P>Out of Doors! <HI>says I,</HI> what with all her Chil∣dren,
poor Lambs, what is become of them I Why
truly, nothing worse, <HI>said they,</HI> can come to them
than staying here, for they were almost starv'd
with Hunger; so the Neighbours seeing the poor
Lady in such Distress, for she stood crying, and
wringing her Hands over her Children like one
distracted, sent for the Church-Wardens to take
care of the Children; and they, when they came,
took the Youngeft, which was born in this Parish,
and have got it a very good Nurse, and taken
Care of it; but as for the other four, they had
sent them away to some of their Father's Relati∣ons,
and who were very substantial People, and
who besides that, liv'd in the Parish where they
were born.</P>
<P>I was not so surpriz'd at this, as not presently
to foresee that this Trouble would be brought
upon you, or upon Mr.—; so I came imme∣diately
to bring you word of it, tnat you might
be prepar'd for it, and might not be surpriz'd?
but I see they have been too nimble for me, so that
I know not what to advise; the poor Woman,
it seems, is turn'd out of Doors into the Street;
and another of the Neighbours there told me,
that when they took her Children from her, she
swoon'd away, and when they recovered her out
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
of that, she run distracted, and is put into a Mad∣House
by the Parish: for there is no-body else to
take any Care of her.</P>
<P>This was all acted to the Life by this good,
kind, poor Creature; for tho' her Deisgn was per∣fectly
good and charitable, yet there was not one
Word of it true in Fact; for I was not turn'd out
of Doors by the Landlord, nor gone distracted;
it was true, indeed, that at parting with my poor
Children, I fainted, and was like one Mad when I
came to myself and found they were gone; but I
remain'd in the House a good while after that; as
you shall hear.</P>
<P>While the poor Woman was telling this dismal
Story, in came the Gentlewoman's Husband, and
tho' her Heart was harden'd against all Pity, who
was really and nearly related to the Children,
for they were the Children of her own Brother;
yet the good Man was quite soften'd with the dis∣mal
Relation of the Circumstances of the Family;
and when the poor Woman had done, he said to
his Wife, This is a dismal Case, my Dear, in∣deed,
and something must be done: His Wife fell
a raving at him, What <HI>says she,</HI> do you want to
have four Children to keep? Have we not Children
of our own? Would you have these Bratts come
and eat up my Children's Bread? No, no, let 'em
go to the Parish, and let them take Care of them,
I'll take Care of my own.</P>
<P>Come, come, my Dear, <HI>says the Husband</HI> Cha∣rity
is a Duty to the Poor, and <HI>he that gives to the
Poor, lends to the Lord;</HI> let us lend our Heavenly
Father a little of our Children's Bread, as you
call it, it will be a Store well laid up for them,
and will be the best Security that our Children
shall never come to want Charity, or be turn'd
out of Doors, as, these poor innocent Creatures are.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="29"/>
Don't tell me of Security, <HI>says the Wife,;</HI> 'tis a
good Security for our Children, to keep what we
have together, and provide for them, and then 'tis
time enough to help keep other Folks Children;
Charity begins at home.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>says he again,</HI> I only talk of
putting out a little Money to Interest, our Maker
is a good Borrower, never fear making a bad Debt
there Child; I'll be Bound for it.</P>
<P>Don't banter me with your Charity, and your
Allegories, <HI>says the Wife angrily,</HI> I tell you they
are my Relations, not yours, and they shall not
roost here, they shall go to the Parish.</P>
<P>All your Relations are my Relations now, <HI>says
the good Gentleman very calmly,</HI> and I won't see your
Relations in Distress and not pity them, any more
than I would my own; indeed, my Dear, they
shan't go to the Parish, I assure you none of my
Wife's Relations shall come to the Parish, if I can
help it.</P>
<P>What, will you take four Children to keep?
<HI>says the Wife.</HI></P>
<P>No, no, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> there's your Sister—I'll
go and talk with her, and your Un∣cle—,
I'll send for him and the rest; I'll war∣rant
you when we are all together we will find
Ways and Means to keep four poor little Crea∣tures
from Beggary and Starving, or else it will be
very hard; we are none of us in so bad Circum∣stances
but we are able to spare a Mite for the Fa∣therless;
don't shut up your Bowels of Compassion
against your own Flesh and Blood: Could you hear
chese poor innocent Children cry at your poor for
Hunger, and give them no Bread?</P>
<P>Prethc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what need they cry at our Door? <HI>says
she,</HI> 'tis the business of the Parish to provide for
them, they than a cry at our Door; if they do, I'll
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
give them nothing: Won't you, <HI>says he,</HI> but I will,
remember that dreadful Scripture is directly against
us, <HI>Prov. 21. 13. Whose stoppeth his Ears at the Cry
of the Poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be
heard.</HI></P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>says she,</HI> you must do what you will,
because you pretend to be Master; but if I had
my Will, I would send them Where they ought
to be sent, I would send them from whence they
came.</P>
<P>Then the poor Woman put in, and said, But,
Madam, that is sending them to starve indeed;
for the Parish has no Obligation to take Care of
'em, and so they would lie and perish in the Street.</P>
<P>Or be sent back again, <HI>says the Husband,</HI> to our
Parish in a Cripple-Cart, by the Justice's Warrant,
and so expose us and all the Relations to the last
Degree, among our Neighbours, and among those
who knew the good Old Gentleman their Grandfa∣ther,
who liv'd and flourish'd in this Parish so ma∣ny
Years, and was so well belov'd among all People,
and deserv'd it so well.</P>
<P>I don't value that one Farthing, not I, <HI>says the
Wife,</HI> I'll keep none of them.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>says her Husband,</HI> but I value it,
for I won't have such a Blot lie upon the Family,
and upon your Children; he was a worthy, anci∣ent,
and good Man, and his Name is respected a∣mong
all his Neighbours; it will be a Reproach to
you, that are his Daughter, and to our Children,
that are his Grand-Children, that we should let
your Brother's Children perish, or come to be a
Charge to the Publick, in the very Place where
your Family once flourish'd: Come, say no more,
I'll see what can be done.</P>
<P>Upon this, he sends and gathers all the Relati∣ons
together at a Tavern hard-by, and sent for
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
the four little Children that they might see them;
and thfiy all, at first Word, agreed to have them ta∣ken
Care of; and because his Wife was so furious
that she would not suffer one of them to be kept
at Home, they agreed to keep them all together
for a-while; so they committed them to the poor
Woman that had manag'd the Affair for them, and
enter'd into Obligations to one another to supply
the needful Sums for their Maintenance; and not
to have one separated from the rest, they sent for
the Youngest from the Parish where it was taken
in, and had them all brought up together.</P>
<P>It would take up too long a Part of this Story
to give a particular Account with what a charita∣ble
Tenderness this good Person, who was but
Uncle-in-Law to them, manag'd that Affair; how
careful he was of them; went constantly to see
them, and to see that they were well provided for,
cloath'd, put to School, and at last put out in the
World tor their Advantage but 'tis enough to say
he acted more like a Father to them, than an Un∣cle-in-Law,
tho' all along much against his Wife's
Consent, who was of a Disposition not so tender
and compassionate as her Husband.</P>
<P>You may believe I heard this with the same Plea∣sure
which I now feel at the relating it again; for
I was terribly frighted at the Apprehensions of my
Children being brought to Misery and Distress, as
those must be who have no Friends, but are left
to Parish Benevolence.</P>
<P>I was now, however, entring on a new Scene
of Life; I had a great House upon my Hands,
and some Furniture left in it, but I was no more
able to maintain myself and My Maid <HI>Amy</HI> in it,
than I was my five Children nor had I any thing
to subsist with, but what I might get by work∣ing,
and that was not a Town where much Work
was to be had.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="32"/>
My Landlord had been very kind indeed, af∣ter
he came to know my Circumstances, tho' be∣fore
I was acquainted with that Part, he had gone
so far as to seize my Goods, and to carry some of
them off too.</P>
<P>But I had liv'd three Quarters of a Year in his
House after that, and had paid him no Rent, and
which was worse, I was in no Condition to pay
him any; however, I observ'd he came oftner to
see me, look'd kinder upon me, and spoke more
friendly to me, than he us'd to do; particularly the
last two or three times he had been there, he ob∣serv'd,
<HI>he said,</HI> how poorly I liv'd, how low I was re∣duc'd,
and the like, told me it griev'd him for my
sake; and the last time of all he was kinder still, told
me he came to Dine with me, and that I should give
him leave to Treat me; so he call'd my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI>
and sent her out to buy a Joint of Meat; he told
her what she should buy, but naming two or three
things, either of which she might take the Maid,
a cunning Wench, and faithful to me, as the Skin
to my Back, did not buy any thing out-right, but
brought the Butcher along with her, with both
the things that she had chosen, for him to please
himself; the one was a large very good Leg of
Veal; the other a Piece of the Fore-Ribs of
Roasting Beef; he look'd at them, but bade me
chaffer with the Butcher for him, and I did so, and
came back to him, and told him what the Butcher
demanded for either of them, and what each, of
them came to; so he pulls out 11. <HI>s.</HI> and 3 <HI>d.</HI> which
they came to together, and bade me take them
both, the rest, he said, would serve another time.</P>
<P>I was surpriz'd, you may be sure, at the Bounty
of a Man that had but a little while ago been my
Terror and had torn the Goods out of my House,
like a Fury, but I consider'd that my Distresses
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
had mollified his Temper, and that he had after∣wards
been so compassionate as to give me Leave
to live Rent-free in the House a whole Year.</P>
<P>But now he put on the Face, not of a Man of
Compassion only, but of a Man of Friendship and
Kindness, and this was so unexpected, that it was
surprizing: We chatted together, and were, as I
may call it, Chearful, which was more than I could
say I had been for three Years before; he sent for
Wine and Beer too, for I had none poor <HI>Amy</HI> and
I had drank nothing but Water for many Weeks,
and indeed, I have often wonder'd at the faithful
Temper of the poor Girl; for which I but ill re∣quited
her at last.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> was come with the Wine, he made
her fill a Glass to him, and with the Glass in his
Hand, he came to me, and kiss'd me, which I
was, I confess, a little surpriz'd at, but more at
what follow'd; for he told me, That as the sad
Condition which I was reduc'd to, had made
him pity me, so my Conduct in it, and the Cou∣rage
I bore it with, had given him a more than or∣dinary
Respect for me, and made him very
thoughtful for my Good; that he was resolv'd for
the present to do something to relieve me, and to
employ his Thoughts in the mean time, to see if
he could, for the future, put me into a Way to
support myself.</P>
<P>While he found me change Colour, and look sur∣priz'd
at his Discourse, for so did to be sure, he
turns to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and looking at her, he
says co me, I say all this Madam, before your Maid,
because both she and you shall know that I have no
ill Design, and that I have, in meer Kindness, re∣solv'd
to do something for you, if I can; and as I
have been a Witness of the uncommon Honesty
and Fidelity of Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> here, so you in all your
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
Distresses, I know she may be trusted with so ho∣nest
a Design as mine is; for, I assure you, I bear
a proportion'd Regard to your Maid too, for her
Affection to you.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> made him a Curtsie, and the poor Girl
look'd so confounded with Joy, that she could not
speak, but her Colour came and went, and every
now and then she blush'd as red as Scarlet, and
the next Minute look'd as pale as Death: Well,
having said this, he sat down, made me sit down,
and then drank to me, and made me drink two
Glasses of Wine together; for, <HI>says he,</HI> you have
Need of it, and so indeed I had: When he had
done so, Come <HI>Amy, says he,</HI> with your Mistress's
Leave, you shall have a Glass too, so he made her
drink two Glasses also, and then rising up; and
now <HI>Amy, says he,</HI> go and get Dinner; and you,
Madam, says he to me, go up and dress you, and
come down and smile and be merry; adding, I'll
make you easie, if I can; and in the mean time,
he said, he would walk in the Garden.</P>
<P>When he was gone, <HI>Amy</HI> chang'd her Counte∣nance
indeed, and look'd as merry as ever she did
in her Life; Dear Madam! <HI>says she,</HI> what does this
Gentleman mean? Nay, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> he means to
do us Good, you see, don't he? I know no other
Meaning he can have, for he can get nothing by me:
I warrant you, Madam, <HI>says,</HI> he'll ask you a Fa∣vour
by and by: No, no, you are mistaken, <HI>Amy,</HI>
I dare say, <HI>said I;</HI> you heard what he said, didn't
you? Ay, says <HI>Amy,</HI> it's no matter for that, you
shall see what he will do after Dinner: Well, well,
<HI>Amy, says I,</HI> you have hard Thoughts of him, I
cannot be of your Opinion I don't see any thing
in him yet that looks like it: As to that, Madam,
says <HI>Amy,</HI> I don't see any thing of it yet neither;
but what should move a Gentleman to take Pity of
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>
us, as he does? Nay, <HI>Says I,</HI> that's a hard thing too,
that we should judge a Man to be wicked because
he's charitable; and vicious because he's kind: O
Madam, says <HI>Amy,</HI> there's abundance of Charity
begins in that Vice, and he is not so unacquainted
with things, as not to know, that Poverty is the
strongest Incentive; a Temptation, against which
no Virtue is powerful enough to stand out; he
knows your Condition as well as you do: Well,
and what then? Why then he knows too that you
are young and handsome, and he has the surest
Bait in the World to take you with.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> but he may find himself mi∣staken
too in such a thing as that: Why, Ma∣dam,
says <HI>Amy,</HI> I hope you won't deny him, if he
should offer it.</P>
<P>What d'ye mean by that, <HI>Hussy, said I?</HI> No, I'd
starve first.</P>
<P>I hope not, Madam, I hope you would be wiser;
I'm sure if he will set you up, as he talks of, you
ought to deny him nothing; and you will starve
if you do not consent, that's certain.</P>
<P>What, consent to lye with him for Bread?
<HI>Amy, said I,</HI> How can you talk so?</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, <HI>says Amy,</HI> don't think you wou'd
for any thing else; it would not be Lawful for
any thing else, but for Bread, Madam; why no∣body
can starve, there's no bearing that, I'm sure.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>says I,</HI> but if he would give me an Estate
to live on, he should not lye with me, I assure you.</P>
<P>Why look you, Madam, if he would but give
you enough to live easie upon, he should lye with
me for it with all my Heart.</P>
<P>That's a Token, <HI>Amy</HI> of inimitable Kindness
to me, <HI>said I,</HI> and I know how to value it; but
there's more Friendship than Honesty in it, <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="36"/>
O Madam, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I'd do any thing to get
you out of this sad Condition; as to Honesty, I
think Honesty is out of the Question, when Starv∣ing
is the Case; are not we almost starv'd to
Death?</P>
<P>I am indeed, <HI>said I,</HI> and thou art for my sake;
but to be a Whore, <HI>Amy!</HI> and there I stopt.</P>
<P>Dear Madam, says <HI>Amy,</HI> if I will starve for
your sake, I will be a Whore, or any thing, for
your sake; why I would die for you, if I were
put to it.</P>
<P>Why that's an Excess of Affection, <HI>Amy,</HI> said I,
I never met with, before; I wish I may be ever in
Condition to make you some Returns suitable:
But however, <HI>Amy,</HI> you shall not be a Whore to
him, to oblige him to be kind to me; no, <HI>Amy,</HI>
nor I won't be a Whore to him, if he would give
me much more than he is able to give me, or do
for me.</P>
<P>Why Madam, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I don't say I will go
and ask him; but I say, if he should promise
to do so and so for you, and the Condition was
such, that he would not serve you unless I would
let him lye with me, he should lye with me as of∣ten
as he would, rather than you should not have
his Assistance; but this is but Talk, Madam, I
don't see any need of such Discourse, and you are
of Opinion that there will be no need of it.</P>
<P>Indeed so I am, <HI>Amy;</HI> but, <HI>said I,</HI> if there was,
I tell you again, I'd die before I would consent.
or before you should consent for my sake.</P>
<P>Hitherto I had not only preserv'd the Virtue it∣self,
but the virtuous Inclination and Resolution;
and had I kept myself there, I had been happy,
tho' I had perish'd of meer Hunger; for, without
question, a Woman ought rather to die, than to
prostitute her Virtue and Honour, let the Tempta∣tion
be what it will.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="37"/>
But to return to my Story; he walk'd about the
Garden; which was, indeed, all in Disorder, and
over-run with Weeds, because I had not been able
to hire a Gardener to do any thing to it, no not so
much as to dig up Ground enough to sow a few
Turnips and Carrots for Family-Use: After he
had view'd it, he came in, and sent <HI>Amy</HI> to fetch
a poor Man, a Gardener, that us'd to help our
Man-Servant, and carry'd him into the Garden,
and order'd him to do several things in it, to put
it into a little Order; and this took him up near
an Hour.</P>
<P>By this time I had dress'd me, as well as I could,
for tho' I had good Linnen left still, yet I had but
a poor Head-Dress, and no Knots, but old Frag∣ments;
no Necklace, no Ear-Rings; all those things
were gone long ago for meer Bread.</P>
<P>However, I was tight and clean, and in better
Plight than he had seen me in a great while, and
he look'd extreamly pleas'd to see me so; for he said
I look'd so disconsolate, and so afflicted before, that
it griev'd him to see me; and he bade me pluck up
a good Heart, for he hop'd to put me in a Condi∣tion
to live in the World, and be beholden to no∣body.</P>
<P>I told him that was impossible, for I must be
beholden to him for it, for all the Friends I had
in the World wou'd not, or cou'd not, do so much
for me as that he spoke of. Well, <HI>Widom, says he,</HI>
so he call'd me, and so indeed I was in the worst
Sence that desolate Word cou'd be us'd in, if you
are beholden to me, you shall be beholden to no∣body
else.</P>
<P>By this time Dinner was ready, and <HI>Amy</HI> came
in to lay the Cloth, and indeed, it was happy
there was none to Dine but he and I, for I had
but six Places left in the House, and but two
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
Dishes; however, he knew now things were, and
bade me make no Scruple about bringing out what
I had, he hop'd to see me in a better Plight, he
did nor come, <HI>he said,</HI> to be Entertain'd, but to En∣tertain
me, and Comfort and Encourage me: Thus
he went on, speaking so chearfully to me, and such
cheerful things, that it was a Cordial to my very
Soul, to hear him speak.</P>
<P>Well, we went to Dinner, I'm sure I had not eat a
good Meal hardly in a Twelvemonth, at least, not
of such a Joint of Meat as the Loin of Veal was;
I eat indeed very heartily, and so did he, and he
made me drink three or four Glasses of Wine, so
that, in short, my Spitits were lifted up to a De∣gree
I had not been us'd to, and I was not only
chearful, but merry, and so he press'd me to be.</P>
<P>I told him, I had a great deal of Reason to be
merry, seeing he had been so kind to me, and had
given me Hopes of recovering me from the worst
Circumstances that ever Woman of any sort of
Fortune, was sunk into; that he cou'd not but
believe that what he had said to me, was like Life
from the Dead; that it was like recovering one
Sick from the Brink of the Grave; how I should
ever make him a Return any way suitable, was
what I had not yet had time to think of; I cou'd
only say, that I should never forget it while I had
Life, and shou'd be always ready to acknowlege it.</P>
<P>He said, That was all he desir'd of me, that
his Reward would be, the Satisfaction of having
rescued me from Misery; that he found he was
obliging one that knew what Gratitude meant; that
he would make it his Business to make me com∣pleatly
Easie, first or last, if it lay in his Power;
and in the mean time, he bade me consider
of any thing that I thought he might do for me,
for my Advantage, and in order to make me perfect∣ly
easie.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="39"/>
After we had talk'd thus, he bade me be chearful;
come, says he, lay aside these melancholly things,
and let us be merry: <HI>Amy</HI> waited at the Table,
and she smil'd, and laugh'd, and was so merry she
could hardly contain it, for the Girl lov'd me to
an Excess, hardly to be describ'd; and it was such
an unexpected thing to hear any one talk to her
Mistress, that the Wench was besides, herself al∣most,
and as soon as Dinner was over, <HI>Amy</HI> went
up-Stairs, and put on her Best Clothes too, and
came down dres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d like a Gentlewoman.</P>
<P>We sat together talking of a thousand Things,
of what had been, and what was to be, all the
rest of the Day, and in the Evening he took his
Leave of me, with a thousand Expressions of
Kindness and Tenderness, and true Affection to
me, but offer'd not the least of what my Maid
<HI>Amy</HI> had suggested.</P>
<P>At his poing away, he took me in his Arms,
protested an honest Kindness to me; said a thou∣sand
kind things to me, which I cannot now recol∣lect,
and after kissing me twenty times, or there∣abouts,
put a Guinea into my Hand; which, he
said, was for my present Supply, and told me,
that he would see me again, before 'twas out; also
he gave <HI>Amy</HI> Half a Crown.</P>
<P>When he was gone, Well, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> are you
convinc'd now that he is an honest as well as a
true Friend, and that there has been nothing, not
the least Appearance of any thing of what you
imagin'd, in his Behaviour: Yes, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I am,
but I admire at it; he is such a Friend as the
World, sure, has not abundance of to show.</P>
<P>I am sure, <HI>says I,</HI> he is such a Friend as I have
long wanted and as I have as much Need of as any
Creature in the World has, or ever had; and, in
short, I was so overcome with the Comfort of it,
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
that I sat down and cry'd for Joy a good-while,
as I had formerly cry'd for Sorrow. <HI>Amy</HI> and I
went to Bed that Night (for <HI>Amy</HI> lay with me)
pretty early, but lay chatting almost all Night a∣bout
it, and the Girl was so transported, that she
got up two or three times in the Night, and danc'd
about the Room in her Shift; in short, the Girl
was half distracted with the Joy of it; a Testimo∣ny
still of her violent Affection for her Mistress, in
which no Servant ever went beyond her.</P>
<P>We heard no more of him for two Days, but
the third Day he came again; then he told me,
with the same Kindness, that he had order'd me a
Supply of Houshold-Goods for the furnishing the
House; that in particular, he had sent me back
all the Goods that he had seiz'd for Rent, which
consisted, indeed, of the best of my former Fur∣niture;
and now, says he, I'll tell you what I
have had in my Head for you, for your present
Supply, and that is, <HI>says he,</HI> that the House being
well furnish'd, you shall Let it out to Lodgings,
for the Summer Gentry, <HI>says he,</HI> by which you
will easily get a good comfortable Subsistance, es∣pecially
seeing you shall pay me no Rent for two
Years, nor after neither, unless you can afford it.</P>
<P>This was the first View I had of living comfort∣ably
indeed, and it was a very probable Way, I
must confess; seeing we had very good Conveni∣ences,
six Rooms on a Floor, and three Stories
high: While he was laying down the Scheme of
my Management, came a Cart to the Door with a
Load of Goods, and an Upholsterer's Man to put
them up; they were chiefly the Furniture of two
Rooms, which he had carried away for his two
Years Rent, with two fine Cabinets, and some Peir-Glasses,
out of the Parlour, and several other valu∣able
things.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="41"/>
These were all restor'd to their Places, and he
told me he gave them me freely, as a Satisfaction
for the Cruelty he had us'd me with before; and
the Furniture of one Room being finish'd, and set
up, he told me, he would furnish one Chamber
for himself, and would come and be one of my
Lodgers, if I would give him Leave.</P>
<P>I told him, he ought not to ask me Leave, who
had so much Right to make himself welcome; so
the House began to look in some tollerable Fi∣gure,
and clean; the Garden also, in about a Fort∣night's
Work, began to look something less like a
Wilderness than it us'd to do; and he order'd me
to put up a Bill for Letting Rooms, reserving one
for himself, to come to as he saw Occasion.</P>
<P>When all was done to his Mind, as to placing
the Goods, he seem'd very well pleas'd, and we
din'd together again of his own providing, and
the Upholsterer's Man gone; after Dinner he took
me by the Hand, Come, now Madam, says he,
you must show me your House, (for he had a-Mind
to see every thing over again) No, Sir, said
I, but I'll go show you your House, if you please; so
we went up thro' all the Rooms, and in the Room
which was appointed for himself, <HI>Amy</HI> was doing
something; Well, <HI>Amyf</HI> says he, I intend to Lye
with you to Morrow-Night; <HI>To Night, if you
please Sir,</HI> says <HI>Amy</HI> very innocently, <HI>your Room is
quite ready:</HI> Well <HI>Amy, says he,</HI> I am glad you are
so willing: No, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I mean your Chamber
is ready to-Night, and away she run out of the
Room asham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d enough; for the Girl meant no
Harm, whatever she had said to me in private.</P>
<P>However, he said no more then; but when <HI>Amy</HI>
was gone, he walk'd about the Room, and look'd
at evert thing, and taking me by the Hand, he
kiss'd me, and spoke a great many kind, affectionate
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>
things to me indeed; as of his Measures for my Ad∣vantage,
and what he wou'd do to raise me again
in the World; told me, that my Afflictions, and
the Conduct I had shown in bearing them to such
an Extremity, had so engag'd him to me, that
he valued me infinitely above all the Women in the
World; that tho' he was under such Engagements
that he cou'd not Marry me, [his Wife and he
had been parted, for some Reasons, which make
too long a Story to intermix with mine] yet that
he wou'd be every thing else that a Woman cou'd
ask in a Husband, and with that he kiss'd me a∣gain,
and took me in his Arms, but offer'd not the
least uncivil Action to me, and told me, he hop'd I
would not deny him all the Favours he should ask,
because he resolv'd to ask nothing of me but what it
was fit for a Woman of Virtue and Modesty, for
such he knew me to be, to yield.</P>
<P>I confess, the terrible Pressure of my former Mi∣sery,
the Memory of which lay heavy upon my
Mind, and the surprizing Kindness with which
he had deliver'd me, and withal, the Expecta∣tions
of what he might still do for me, were pow∣erful
things, and made me have scarce the Power
to deny him any thing he wou'd ask; however, I
told him thus, with an Air of Tenderness too,
that he had done so much for me, that I thought
I ought to deny him nothing, only I hop'd, and
depended upon him, that he wou'd not take the
Advantage of the infinite Obligations I was under
to him, to desire any thing of me, the yielding
to which would lay me lower in his Esteem than
I desir'd to be; that as I took him to be a Man of
Honour, so I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w he could not like me the better
for doing any thing that was below a Woman of
Honesty and Good Manners to do.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="43"/>
He told me, that he had done all this for me,
without so much as telling me what Kindness or
real Affection he had for me, that I might not be
under any Necessity of yielding to him in any
thing, for want of Bread; and he would no more
oppress my Gratitude now, than he would my
Necessity before, nor ask any thing, supposing he
would stop his Favours, or withdraw his Kind∣ness,
if he was deny'd; it was true, he said, he
might tell me more freely his Mind now, than
before, seeing I had let him see that I accepted his
Assistance, and saw that he was sincere in his
Design of serving me; that he had gone thus far
to shew me that he was kind to me, but that now
he would tell me, that he lov'd me, and yet
wou'd demonstrate that his Love was both ho∣nourable,
and that what he shou'd desire, was what
he might honestly ask, and I might honestly grant.</P>
<P>I answer'd, That within those two Limitations,
I was sure I ought to deny him nothing, and I
should think myself not ungrateful only, but very
unjust, if I shou'd; so he said no more, but I ob∣serv'd
he kiss'd me more, and took me in his
Arms in a kind of familiar Way, more than usual,
and which once or twice put me in Mind of my
Maid <HI>Amy</HI>'s Words; and yet, I must acknowlege,
I was so overcome with his Goodness to me in
those many kind things he had done, that I not only
was easie at what he did, and made no Resist∣ance,
but was inclin'd to do the like, whatever he
had offer'd to do: But he went no farther than
what I have said, nor did he offer so much as to
sit down on the Bed-side with me, but took his
Leave, said he lov'd me tenderly, and would con∣vince
me of it by such Demonstrations as should
be to my Satisfaction: I told him, I had a great
deal of Reason to believe him; that he was full
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
Master of the whole House, and of me, as far as
was within the Bounds we had spoken of, which I
believ'd he would not break; and as'd him if he
wou'd not Lodge there that Night.</P>
<P>He said, he cou'd not well stay thbt Night, Bu∣siness
requiring him in <HI>London,</HI> but added, smiling,
that he wou'd come the next Day, and take a
Night's Lodging with me. I press'd him to stay
that Night, and told him, I should be glad a
Friend so valuable should he under the same Roof
with me; and indeed, I began at that time not
only to be much oblig'd to him, but to love him
too, and that in a Manner that I had not been ac∣quainted
with myself.</P>
<P>O let no Woman slight the Temptation that
being generously deliver'd from Trouble, is to any
Spirit furnish'd with Gratitude and just Principles:
This Gentleman had freely and voluntarily deli∣ver'd
me from Misery, from Poverty, and Rags;
he had made me what I was, and put me into a
Way to be even more than I ever was, namely, to
live happy and pleas'd, and on his Bounty I de∣pended:
What could I say to this Gentleman
when he press'd me to yield to him, and argued
the Lawfullness of it? But of that in its Place.</P>
<P>I press'd him again to stay that Night, and told
him it was the first compleatly happy Night that
I had ever had in the House in my Life, and I
should be very sorry to have it be without his
Company, who was the Cause and Foundation of
it all; that we would be innocently merry, but
that it could never be without him; and, in short,
I courted him so, that he said, he cou'd not deny
me, but he wou'd take his Horse, and go to <HI>London,</HI>
do the Business he had to do, which, it seems, was
to pay a Foreign Bill that was due that Night, and
wou'd else be protested; and that he wou'd come
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
back in three Hours at farthest, and Sup with
me, but bade me get nothing there, for since I was
resolv'd to be merry, which was what he desir'd
above all things, he wou'd send me something
from <HI>London,</HI> and we will make it a Wedding Sup∣per,
my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> and with that Word, took
me in his Arms, and kiss'd me so vehemently,
that I made no question but he intended to do
every thing else that <HI>Amy</HI> had talk'd of.</P>
<P>I started a little at the Word <HI>Wedding:</HI> What
do ye mean? to call it by such a Name, <HI>says I;</HI>
adding, We will have a Supper, but t'other is im∣possible,
as well on your side as mine; he laugh'd,
Well, says he, you shall call it what you will, but
it may be the same thing, for I shall satisfie you, it
is not so impossible as you make it.</P>
<P>I don't understand you, said I, have not I a Hus∣band,
and you a Wife?</P>
<P>Well, well, says he, we will talk of that after
Supper; so he rose up, gave me another Kiss, and
took his Horse for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This kind of Discourse had fir'd my Blood, I
confess, and I knew not what to think of it; it
was plain now that he intended to lye with me,
but how he would reconcile it to a legal thing, like
a Marriage, that I cou'd not imagine: We had
both of us us'd <HI>Amy</HI> with so much Intimacy, and
trusted her with every thing, having such unexam∣pled
Instances of her Fidelity, that he made no
Scruple to kiss me, and say all these things to me
before her, nor had he car'd one Farthing if I
would have let him Lay with me, to have had <HI>Amy</HI>
there too all Night. When he was gone, Well,
<HI>Amy,</HI> says I, what will all this come to now? I
am all in a Sweat at him: Come to, Madam, says
<HI>Amy,</HI> I see what it will come to, I must put you
to-Bed to Night together: Why you wou'd not be
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
so impudent, you Jade you, <HI>says I,</HI> wou'd you?
Yes, I wou'd, says she, with all my Heart, and
think you both as honest as ever you were in your
Lives.</P>
<P>What ails the Slut to talk so? <HI>said I,</HI> Honest! how
can it be honest? Why, I'll tell you, Madam, says
<HI>Amy,</HI> I sounded it as soon as I heard him speak,
and it is very true too; he calls you Widow, and
snch, indeed, you are; for as my Master has left
you so many Years, he is dead to be sure: at least,
he is dead to you; he is no Husband, you are, and
ought to be free to marry who you will; and his
Wife being gone from him, and refuses to lye with
him, then he is a single Man again, as much as
ever; and tho' you cannot bring the Laws of the
Land to join you together, yet one refusing to do
the Office of a Wife, and the other of a Husband,
you may certainly take one another fairly.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> If I cou'd take him fairly,
you may be sure I'd take him above all the Men in
the World; it turn'd the very Heart within me,
when I heard him say he lov'd me; how cou'd it
do otherwise? when you know what a Condition I
was in before; despis'd, and trampled on by all
the World; I cou'd have took him in my Arms,
and kiss'd him as freely as he did me, if it had
not boon for Shame,</P>
<P>Ay, and all the rest too, says <HI>Amy,</HI> at the first
Word; I don't see how you can think of denying
him any thing; has he not brought you out of the
Devil's Clu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches; brought you out of the black∣est
Misery that ever poor Lady was reduc'd to?
Can a Woman deny such a Man any thing?</P>
<P>Nay, I don't know what to do, <HI>Amy,</HI> says I; I
hope he won't desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any thing of that Kind of
me, I hope he won't: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; if he does, I know
not what to say to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="47"/>
Not ask you, says <HI>Amy,</HI> depend upon it, he will
ask you, and you will grant it too; I'm sure may
Mistress is no Fool; come, pray Madam, let me
go air you a clean Shift; don't let him find you
in foul Linnen the Wedding-Night.</P>
<P>But that I know you to be a very honest Girl,
<HI>Amy, says I,</HI> you wou'd make me abhor you;
why, you argue for the Devil, as if you were one
of his Privy-Counsellors.</P>
<P>It's no matter for that, Madam, I say nothing
but what I think; you own yew love this Gentle∣man,
and he has given you sufficient Testimony of
his Affection to you; your Conditions are alike
unhappy, and he is of Opinion that he may take
another Woman, his first Wife having broke her
Honour, and living from him, and that, tho' the
Laws of the Land will not allow him to marry for∣mally,
yet, that he may take another Woman into
his Arms, provided he keeps true to the other
Woman as a Wife; nay he says it is usual to do so,
and allow'd by the Custom of the Place, in several
Countries abroad; and, I must own, I'm of the
same Mind; else 'tis in the Power of a Whore, af∣ter
she has jilted and abandon'd her Husband, to
confine him from the Pleasare as well as Conveni∣ence
of a Woman all Days of his Life, which
wou'd be very unreasonable; and as times go, not
tollerable to all People; and the like on your side,
Madam.</P>
<P>Had I now had my Sences about me, and had
my Reason not been overcome by the powerful
Attraction of so kind, so beneficent a Friend; had
I consulted Conscience and Virtue, I shou'd have
repell'd this <HI>Amy,</HI> however faithful and honest to
me in other things, as a Viper, and Engine of the
Devil; I ought to have remembred that neither
he or I, either by the Laws of God or Man,
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
cou'd come together, upon any other Terms than
that of notorious Adultery: The ignorant Jade's
Argument, That he had brought me out of the
Hands of the Devil, by which she meant the
Devil of Poverty and Distress, shou'd have been a
powerful Motive to me, not to plunge myself into
the Jaws of Hell, and into the Power of the real
Devil, in Recompence for that Deliverance; I
shou'd have look'd upon all the Good this Man
had done for me, to have been the particular
Work of the Goodness of Heaven; and that Good∣ness
shou'd have mov'd me to a Return of Duty
and humble Obedience; I shou'd have received
the Mercy thankfully, and apply'd it soberly, to
the Praise and Honour of my Maker; whereas by
this wicked Course, all the Bounty and Kindness
of this Gentleman, became a Snare to me, was a
meer Bait to the Devil's Hook; I receiv'd his
Kindness at the dear Expence of Body and
Soul, mortgaging Faith, Religion, Conscience, and
Modesty, for (as I may call it) a Morsel of Bread;
or, if you will, ruin'd my Soul from a Principle
of Gratitude, and gave myself up to the Devil,
to shew myself grateful to my Benefactor: I
must do the Gentleman that Justice, as to say,
I verily believe that he did nothing but what
he thought was Lawful; and I must do that
Justice upon myself, as to say, I did what my
own Conscience convinc'd me at the very Time I
did it, was horribly unlawful, scandalous, and
abominable.</P>
<P>But Poverty was my Snare; dreadful Poverty!
the Misery I had been in, was great, such as wou'd
make the Heart tremble at the Apprehensions of
its Return; and I might appeal to any that has had
any Experience of the World, whether one so
entirely destitute as I was, of all manner of all
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
Helps, or Friends, either to support me, or to as∣sist
me to support myself, could withstand the Pro∣posal;
not that I plead this as a Justification of
my Conduct, but that it may move the Pity, even
of those that abhor the Crime.</P>
<P>Besides this, I was young, handsome, and with
all the Mortifications I had met with, was vain,
and that not a little; and as it was a new thing,
so it was a pleasant thing, to be courted, caress'd,
embrac'd, and high Professions of Affection made
to me by a Man so agreeable, and so able to
do me good.</P>
<P>Add to this, that if I had ventur'd to disoblige
this Gentleman, I had no Friend in the World to
have Reconrse to; I had no Prospect, no, not of a
Bit of Bread; I had nothing before me, but to
fall back into the same Misery that I had been in
before.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> had but too much Rhetorick in this Cause;
she represented all those Things in their proper
Colours; she argued them all with her utmost
Skill, and at last, the Merry Jade, when she came
to Dress me, Look ye, Madam, <HI>said she,</HI> if you
won't consent, tell him you'll do as <HI>Rachael</HI> did to
<HI>Jacob,</HI> when she could have no Children, pnt her
Maid to Bed to him; tell him you cannot comply
with him, but there's <HI>Amy,</HI> he may ask her the
Question, she has promis'd me she won't deny
y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u.</P>
<P>And wou'd you have me say so, <HI>Amy? said I.</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam, but I wou'd really have you do so,
besides you are undone if you do not; and if my
doing it wou'd save you from being undone, as I
said before, he shall if he will; if he asks me, I
won't deny him, not I; Hang me if I do, <HI>says
Amy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="50"/>
Well, I know not what to do, <HI>says I,</HI> to
<HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P>Do! <HI>says Amy,</HI> Your Choice is fair and plain;
here you may have a handsome, charming Gentle∣man,
be rich, live pleasantly, and in Plenty; or
refuse him, and want a Dinner, go in Rags, live
in Tears; in short, beg and starve; you know
this is the Case, Madam, <HI>says Amy,</HI> I wonder how
you can say you know not what to do.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> the Case is as you say, and
I think verily I must yield to him; but then, <HI>said I,
mov'd by Conscience,</HI> don't talk any more of your
Cant, of its being Lawful that I ought to Marry
again, and that he ought to Marry again, and
such Stuff as that; 'tis all Nonsence, <HI>says I, Amy,</HI>
there's nothing in it, let me hear no more of that;
for if I yield, 'tis in vain to mince the Matter, I
am a Whore, <HI>Amy,</HI> neither better nor worse, I
assure you.</P>
<P>I don't think so, Madam, by no means, <HI>says
Amy,</HI> I wonder how you can talk so; and then
she run on with her Argument of the Unreasona∣bleness
that a Woman should be oblig'd to live
single, or a Man to live single in such Cases, as be∣fore:
Well, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> come let us dispute no
more; for the longer I enter into that Part, the
greater my Scruples will be; but if I let it alone,
the Necessity of my present Circumstances is such,
that I believe I shall yield to him, if he should im∣portune
me much about it, but I should be glad
he would not do it all, but leave me as I am.</P>
<P>As to that, Madam, you may depend, <HI>says Amy,</HI>
he expects to have you for his Bedfellow to
Night; I saw it plainly in his Management all Day,
and at last he told you so too, us plain, I think, as he
cou'd: Well, well, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> I don't know what to
say, if he will, he must, I think, I don't know
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
how to resist such a Man, that has done so much
for me: I don't know how you shou'd, <HI>says Amy.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Amy</HI> and I canvass'd the Business between
us; the Jade prompted the Crime, which I had
but too much Inclination to commit; that is to
say, not as a Crime, for I had nothing of the
Vice in my Constitution; my Spirits were far
from being high; my Blood had no Fire in it, to
kindle the Flame of Desire; but the Kindness and
good Humour of the Man, and the Dread of my
own Circumstances concurr'd to bring me to the
Point, and I even resolv'd, before he ask'd, to give
up my Virtue to him, whenever he should put it to
the Question.</P>
<P>In this I was a double Offender, whatever he
was; for I was resolv'd to commit the Crime,
knowing and owning it to be a Crime; he, if it
was true as he said, was fully perswaded it was
Lawful, and in that Perswasion he took the Mea∣sures,
and us'd all the Circumlocutions which I
am going to speak of.</P>
<P>ABOUT two Hours after he was gone, came a
<HI>Leaden-Hall</HI> Basket-Woman, with a whole Load
of good Things for the Mouth; the Particulars
are not to the Purpose, and brought Orders to get
Supper by Eight a-Clock; however, I did not intend
to begin to dress any thing, till I saw him; and he
gave me time enough, for he came before Seven;
so that <HI>Amy,</HI> who had gotten one to help her, got
every thing ready in Time.</P>
<P>We sat down to Supper about Eight, and were
indeed, very merry; <HI>Amy</HI> made us some Sport,
for she was a Girl of Spirit and Wit; and with
her Talk she made us laugh very often, and yet
the Jade manag'd her Wit with all the good Man∣ners
imaginable.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="52"/>
But to shorten the Story; after Supper, he took
me up into his Chamber, where <HI>Amy</HI> had made a
good Fire, and there he pull'd out a great many
Papers, and spread them upon a little Table, and
then took me by the Hand, and after kissing me
very much, he enter'd into a Discourse of his
Circumstances, and of mine, how they agreed in
several things exactly; for Example, That I was
abandon'd of a Husband in the Prime of my
Youth and Vigour, and he of a Wife in his Mid∣dle-Age;
how the End of Marriage was destroy'd
by the Treatment we had either of us receiv'd;
and it wou'd be very hard that we should be ty'd
by the Formality of the Contract, where the Es∣sence of
it was destroy'd: I interrupted him, and
told him, There was a vast Difference between our
Circumstances, and that in the most essential Part;
namely, That he was Rich, and I was Poor; that
he was above the World, and I infinitely below it;
that his Circumstances were very easie, mine mi∣serable,
and this was an Inequality the most es∣sential
that cou'd be imagin'd: As to that, my
Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> I have taken such Measures as shall
make an Equality still; and with that, he shew'd
me a Contract in Writing, wherein he engag'd
himself to me; to cohabit constantly with me; to
provide for me in all Respects as a Wife; and re∣peating
in the Preamble, a long Account of the
Nature and Reason of our living together, and an
Obligation in the Penalty of 7000 l. never to a∣bandon
me; and at last, shew'd me a Bond for
500 l. to be paid to me, or to my Assigns, with∣in
three Months after his Death.</P>
<P>He read over all these things to me, and then
in a most moving, affectionate Manner, and in
Words not to be answer'd, <HI>he said,</HI> Now, my
Dear, is this not sufficient? Can you object any
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
thing against it? If not, as I believe you will not,
then let us debate this Matter no longer; with
that, he pull'd out a silk Purse, which had three∣score
Guineas in it, and threw them into my Lap,
and concluded all the rest of his Discourse with
Kisses, and Protestations of his Love; of which
indeed, I had abundant Proof.</P>
<P>Pity humane Frailty, you that read of a Wo∣man
reduc'd in her Youth, and Prime, to the ut∣most
Misery and Distress; and rais'd again, as
above, by the unexpected and surprizing Bounty
of a Stranger; I say pity her if she was not
able, after all these things, to make any more Re∣sistance.</P>
<P>However, I stood out a little longer still, I ask'd
him, how he cou'd expect that I cou'd come into a
Proposal of such Consequence, the very first Time it
was mov'd to me? and that I ought (if I consented
to it) to capitulate with him, that he should never
upbraid me with Easiness, and consenting too soon:
<HI>He said,</HI> No; but on the contrary, he would take
it as a Mark of the greatest Kindness I could show
him; then he went on to give Reasons why there
was no Occasion to use the ordinary Ceremony of
Delay; or to wait a reasonable Time of Courtship,
which was only to avoid Scandal; but, as this was
private, it had nothing of that Nature in it; that he
had been courting me some time, by the best of
Courtship, <HI>viz.</HI> doing Acts of Kindness to me; and
that he had given Testimonies of his sincere Affecti∣on
to me, by Deeds, not by flattering Trifles,
and the usual Courtship of Words, which were of∣ten
found to have very little Meaning; that he
took me not as a Mistress, but as his Wife; and
protested, it was clear to him he might lawfully do
it, and that I was perfectly at Liberty; and assur'd
me by all that it was possible for an Honest Man
<PB N="49" REF="54"/>
to say, that he would treat me as his Wife, as
long as he liv'd; in a Word, he conquer'd all the
little Resistance I intended to make; he protested
he lov'd me above all the World, and begg'd I
would for once believe him; that he had never de∣ceiv'd
me, and never would, but would make it
his Study to make my Life comfortable and
happy, and to make me forget the Misery I had
gone through: I stood still a-whlie, and said no∣thing,
but seeing him eager for my Answer,
I smil'd, and looking up at him; and must I then,
<HI>says I,</HI> say Yes, at first asking? Must I depend up∣on
your Promise? Why then, <HI>said I,</HI> upon the
Faith of that Promise, and in the Sence of that
inexpressible Kindness you have shown me, you
shall be oblig'd, and I will be wholly yours to the
End of my Life; and with that, I took his
Hand which held me by the Hand, and gave it
a Kiss.</P>
<P>And thus in Gratitude for the Favours I receiv'd
from a Man, was all Sence of Religion, and Duty
to God, all Regard to Virtue and Honour, given
up at once, and we were to call one another Man
and Wife, who, in the Sence of the Laws, both of
God and our Country, were no more than two
Adulterers, in short, a Whore and a Rogue; nor,
as I have said above, was my Conscience silent
in it, tho', it seems, his was; for I sinn'd with
open Eyes, and thereby had a double Guilt upon
me; as I always said his Notions were of ano∣ther
Kind, and he either was before of the Opi∣nion,
or argued himself into it now, that we were
both Free, and might lawfully Marry.</P>
<P>But I was quite of another Side, my, and my
Judgment was right, but my Circumstances were
my Temptation; the Terrors behind me look'd
blacker than the Terrors before me; and the
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>
dreadful Argument of wanting Bread, add being
run into the horrible Distresses I was in before,
master'd all my Resolution, and I gave myself up,
as above.</P>
<P>The rest of the Evening we spent very agreea∣bly
to me; he was perfectly good-humour'd, and
was at that time very merry; then he made <HI>Amy</HI>
dance with, him, and I told him, I wou'd put <HI>Amy</HI>
to Bed to him; <HI>Amy</HI> said, with all her Heart, she
never had been a Bride in her Life; in short, he
made the Girl so merry, that had he not been
to lye with me the same Night, I believe he wou'd
have play'd the Fool with <HI>Amy</HI> for half an Hour,
and the Girl wou'd no more have refus'd him,
than I intended to do; yet before, I had always
found her a very modest Wench, as any I ever saw
in all my Life; but, in short, the Mirth of that
Night, and a few more such afterwards, ruin'd
the Girl's Modesty for ever, as shall appeal by and
by, in its Place.</P>
<P>So far does fooling and toying sometimes go, that
I know nothing a young Woman has to be more
cautious of; so far had this innocent Girl gone
in jesting between her and I, and in talking that
she would let him lye with her, if he would but
be kinder to me, that at last she let him lye with
her in earnest; and so empty was I now of all
Principle, that I encourag'd the doing it almost
before my Face.</P>
<P>I say but too justly, that I was empty of Prin∣ciple,
beacuse, as above, I had yielded to him,
not as deluded to believe it Lawful, but as over∣come
by his Kindness, and terrify'd at the Fear
of my own Misery, if he should leave me; so
with my Eyes open, and with my Conscience, as
I may say, awake, I sinn'd, knowing it to be a
Sin, but having no Power to resist; when this had
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>
thus made a Hole in my Heart, and I was come to
such a height, as to transgress against the Light of
my own Conscience, I was then fit for any Wick∣edness,
and Conscience left off speaking, where
it found it cou'd not be heard.</P>
<P>But to return to our Story; having consented, as
above, to his Proposal, we had not much more to
do; he gave me my Writings, and the Bond for
my Maintenance during his Life, and for 500 l. after
his Death; and so far was he from abating his
Affection to me afterwards, that two Year after
we were thus, as he call'd it, Marry'd, he made
his Will, and gave me a Thousand Pound more,
and all my Houshold-Stuff, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was
considerable too.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> put us to-Bed, and my new Friend, I
cannot call him Husband, was so well pleas'd with
<HI>Amy,</HI> for her Fidelity and Kindness to me, that
he paid her all the Arrear of her Wages that I
ow'd her, and gave her five Guineas over, and
had it gone no farther, <HI>Amy</HI> Had richly deserv'd
what she had, for never was a Maid so true to a
Mistress in such dreadful Circumstances as I was
in; nor was what follow'd more her own Fault
than mine, who led her almost into it at first, and
quite into it at last; and this may be a farther Te∣stimony
what a hardness of Crime I was now ar∣riv'd
to, which was owing to the Conviction that
was from the beginning, upon me, that I was a
Whore, not a Wife; nor cou'd I ever frame my
Mouth to call him Husband, or to say my Hus∣band,
when I was speaking of him.</P>
<P>We liv'd, surely, the most agreeable Life, the
grand Exception only excepted, that ever Two
liv'd together; he was the most obliging Gentle∣manly
Man, and the most tender of me, that ever
Woman gave herself up to; nor was there ever
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>
the least Interruption to our mutual Kindness, no,
not to the last Day of his Life: But I must bring
<HI>Amy</HI>'s Disaster in an once, that I may have done
with her.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was dressing me one Morning, for now I
had two Maids, and <HI>Amy</HI> was my Chamber-Maid;
Dear Madam, <HI>says Amy,</HI> what, a'n't you with-Child
yet? No, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> nor any Sign of it:
<HI>Law,</HI> Madam, <HI>says Amy,</HI> what have you been do∣ing?
why you have been Marry'd a Year and a
half, I warrant you, Master wou'd have got me
with-Child twice in that time: It may be so, <HI>Amy▪
says I,</HI> let him try, can't yon: No, <HI>says Amy,</HI> you'll
forbid it now; before I told you he shou'd with
all my Heart, but I won't now, now he's all your
own: O, <HI>says I, Amy,</HI> I'll freely give you my Con∣sent,
it will be nothing at-all to me; nay, I'll
put you to-Bed to him myself one Night or other,
if you are willing: No, Madam, no, <HI>says Amy,</HI>
not now he's yours.</P>
<P>Why you Fool you, <HI>says I,</HI> don't I tell you I'll
put you to Bed to him myself.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, <HI>says Amy</HI> if you put me to-Bed to
him, that's another Case; I believe I shall not rise
again very soon.</P>
<P>I'll venture that, <HI>Amy, says I.</HI></P>
<P>After Supper, that Night, and before we were
risen from Table, <HI>I said to him, Amy</HI> being by,
Hark ye, Mr.—, Do you know that you are
to lye with <HI>Amy</HI> to-Night? No, not I, <HI>says he;</HI>
but turns to <HI>Amy,</HI> Is it so <HI>Amy, says he?</HI> No, Sir,
<HI>says she;</HI> Nay, don't say no, you Fool; Did not I
promise to put you to-Bed to him? But the Girl
said No still, and it pass'd off.</P>
<P>At Night, when we came to go to-Bed, <HI>Amy</HI>
came into the Chamber to undress me, and her
Master slipt into Bed first; then I began, and
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>
told him all that <HI>Amy</HI> had said about my not be∣ing
with-Child, and of her being with-Child
twice in that time: Ay, Mrs. <HI>Amy, says he,</HI> I be∣lieve
so too, Come hither, and we'll try; but <HI>Amy</HI>
did not go: Go, you Fool, <HI>says I,</HI> can't you, I
freely give you both Leave; but <HI>Amy</HI> wou'd not
go: Nay, you Whore, <HI>says I,</HI> you said, if I wou'd
put you to-Bed, you wou'd with all your Heart:
and with that, I sat her down, pull'd off her Stock∣ings
and Shooes, and all her Cloaths, Piece by
Piece, and led her to the Bed to him: <HI>Here,</HI>
says I, <HI>try what you can do with your Maid</HI> Amy:
She pull'd back a little, would not let me pull off
her Cloaths at first, but it was hot Weather, and
she had not many Cloaths on, and particularly, no
Stays on; and at last, when she see I was in earnest,
she let me do what I wou'd; so I fairly stript her,
and then I threw open the Bed, and thrust her
in.</P>
<P>I need say no more; this is enough to con∣vince
any-body that I did not think him my Hus∣band,
and that I had cast off all Principle, and
all Modesty, and had effectually stifled Con∣science.</P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> I dare say, began now to repent, and
wou'd fain have got out of Bed again; but he said
to her, Nay, <HI>Amy,</HI> you see your Mistress has put
you to-Bed, 'tis all her doing, you must blame
her; so he held her fast, and the Wench being
naked in the Bed with him, 'twas too late to
look back, so she lay still, and let him do what
he wou'd with her.</P>
<P>Had I look'd upon myself as a Wife, you can∣not
suppose I would have been willing to have let
my Husband lye with my Maid, much less, be∣fore
my Face, for I stood-by all the while; but
as I thought myself a Whore, I cannot say but
<PB N="54" REF="59"/>
that it was something design'd in my Thoughts, that
my Maid should be a Whore too, and should not
reproach me with it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> however, less vicious than I, was grievously
out of Sorts the next Morning, and cry'd, and
took-on most vehemently; that she was ruin'd and
undone, and there was no pacifying her; she was
a Whore, a Slut, and she was undone! undone!
and cry'd almost all Day; I did all I could to
pacify her: A Whore! <HI>says I,</HI> well, and am not
I a Whore as well as you? No, no, <HI>says Amy,</HI>
no, you are not, for you are Marry'd not I, <HI>Amy,
says I,</HI> I do not pretend to it; he may Marry you
to-Morrow if he will, for any thing I cou'd do to
hinder it, I am not Marry'd, I do not look up∣on
it as any thing: Well, all did not pacify <HI>Amy,</HI>
but she cry'd two or three Days about it; but it
wore off by Degrees.</P>
<P>But the Case differ'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and her Ma∣ster,
exceedingly; for <HI>Amy</HI> retain'd she same kind
Temper she always had; but on the contrary,
he was quite alter'd, for he hated her heartily,
and could, I believe, have kill'd her after it, and he
told me so, for he thought this a vile Action;
whereas what he and I had done, he was per∣fectly
easie in, thought it just, and esteem'd me as
much his Wife as if we had been Marry'd from
our Youth, and had neither of us known any o∣ther;
nay, he lov'd me, I believe, as entirely, as if I
had been the Wife of his Youth; nay, he told
me, it was true, in one Sence, that he had two
Wives, but that I was the Wife of his Affection,
the other, the Wife of his Aversion.</P>
<P>I was extremely concern'd at the Aversion he
siad taken to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and us'd my utmost
Skill to get it alter'd; for tho' he had; indeed,
debauch'd the Wench, I knew that I was the
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>
principal Occasion of it; and as he was the best-humour'd
Man in the World, I never gave him
over till I prevail'd with him to be easie with her,
and as I was now become the Devil's Agent, to
make others as wicked as myself, I brought him
to lye with her again several times after that, till
at last, as the poor Girl said, so it happen'd, and
she was really with-Child.</P>
<P>She was terribly concern'd at it, and so was he
too: Come, my Dear <HI>says I,</HI> when <HI>Rachael</HI> put
her Handmaid to-Bed to <HI>Jacob,</HI> she took the
Children as her own; don't be uneasie, I'll take
the Child as my own; had not I a hand in the
Frolick of putting her to-Bed to you? It was my
Fault as much as yours; so I call'd <HI>Amy,</HI> and
encourag'd her too, and told her, that I wou'd
take Care of the Child and her too, and added
the same Argument to her; for, <HI>says I, Amy,</HI> it
was all my Fault; did not I drag your Cloaths off
of your Back, and put you to-Bed to him: Thus
I that had, indeed, been the Cause of all the Wick∣edness
between them, encourag'd them both,
when they had any Remorse about it, and ra∣ther
prompted them to go on with it, than to
repent of it.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> grew Big, she went to a Place I had
provided for her, and the Neighbours knew no∣thing
but that <HI>Amy</HI> and I was parted; she had a
fine Child indeed, a Daughter, and we had it
nurs'd, and <HI>Amy</HI> came again in about half a Year,
to live with her old Mistress; but neither my
Gentleman, or <HI>Amy</HI> either, car'd for playing that
Game over again; for as he haid, the Jade might
bring him a House-full of Children to keep.</P>
<P>We liv'd as merrily, and as happily, after this,
as cou'd be expected, considering our Circum∣stances;
I mean as to the pretended Marriage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>
and as to that, my Gentleman had not the least
Concern about him for it; but as much as I was
harden'd, and that was as much, as I believe, ever
any wicked Creature was, yet I could not help it;
there was, and would be, Hours of Intervals, and
of dark Reflections which came involuntarily in,
and thrust in Sighs into the middle of all my
Songs; and there would be, sometimes, a heavi∣ness
of Heart, which intermingl'd itself with all
my Joy, and which would often fetch a Tear
from my Eye; and let others pretend what they
will, I believe it impossible to be otherwise with
any-body; there can be no substantial Satisfaction
in a Life of known Wickedness; Conscience will,
and does, often break in upon them at particular
times, let them do what they can to prevent it.</P>
<P>But I am not to preach, but to relate, and what∣ever
loose Reflections were, and how often soever
those dark Intervals came on, I did my utmost to
conceal them from him; ay, and to suppress and
smother them too in myself, and to outward Ap∣pearance
we liv'd as chearfully, and as agreeably, as
it was possible for any Couple in the World to
live.</P>
<P>After I had thus liv'd with him something
above two Year, truly, I found my-self with-Child
too; my Gentleman was mightily pleas'd
at it, and nothing could be kinder than he
was in the Preparations he made for me, and
for my Lying-in, which was, however, very pri∣vate,
because I car'd for as little Company as possi∣ble;
nor had I kept up my neighbourly Acquain∣tance;
so that I had no-body to invite upon such
an Occasion.</P>
<P>I was brought to-Bed very well, (of a Daughter
too, as well as <HI>Amy</HI>) but the Child died at about
six Weeks old, so all that Work was to do over
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
again, that is to say, the Charge, the Expence,
the Travel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The next Year I made him amends, and brought
him a Son, to his great Satisfaction; it was a
charming Child, and did very well: After this,
my Husband, as he call'd himself, came to me one
Evening, and told me, he had a very difficult
Thing happen'd to him, which he knew not what
to do in, or how to resolve about, unless I would
make him easie; this was, that his Occasions re∣quir'd
him to go over to <HI>France</HI> for about two
Months.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>says I,</HI> and how shall I make
you easie?</P>
<P>Why, by consenting to let me go, <HI>says he,</HI> up∣on
which Condition, I'll tell you the Occasion of
my going, that you may judge of the Necessity
there is for it on my Side; then to make me easie in
his going, he told me, he would make his Will be∣fore
he went, which should be to my full Satis∣faction.</P>
<P>I told him, the last Part was so kind, that I
could not decline the first Part, unless he would
give me Leave to add, that if it was not for put∣ting
him to an extraordinary Expence, I would go
over along with him.</P>
<P>He was so pleas'd with this Offer, that he told
me, he would give me full Satisfaction for it, and
accept of it too; so he took me to <HI>London</HI> with
him the next Day, and there he made his WILL,
and shew'd at to me, and seal'd it before proper
Witnesses, and then gave it to me to keep: In this
WILL he gave a thousand Pounds to a Person that
we both knew very well, in Trust, to pay it, with
the Interest from the Time of his Decease, to me,
or my Assigns; then he Will'd the Payment of
my Jointure, as he call'd it, <HI>viz.</HI> his Bond of a
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>
Hundred Pounds, after his Death; also he gave
me all my Houshold-Stuff, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This was a most engaging thing for a Man to
do to one under my Circumstances; and it would
have been hard, as I told him, to deny him any
thing, or to refuse to go with him any where; so
we settled every thing as well as we cou'd; left
<HI>Amy</HI> in Charge with the House; and for his other
Business, which was in Jewels, he had two Men
he entrusted, who he had good Security for,
and who manag'd for him, and corresponded with
him.</P>
<P>Things being thus concerted, we went away to
<HI>France,</HI> arriv'd safe at <HI>Calais,</HI> and by easie Jour∣neys,
came in eight Days more to <HI>Paris,</HI> where
we lodg'd in the House of an <HI>English</HI> Merchant of
his Acquaintance, and was very courteously en∣tertain'd.</P>
<P>My Gentleman's Business was with some Per∣sons
of the First Rank, and to whom he had sold
some Jewels of very good Value, and receiv'd a
great Sum of Money in Specie, and, as he told
me privately, he gain'd 3000 Pistoles by his Bar∣gain,
but would not suffer the most intimate
Friend he had there, to know what he had re∣ceiv'd;
for it is not so safe a thing in <HI>Paris,</HI> to
have a great Sum of Money in keeping, as it might
be in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>We made this Journey much longer than we
intended; and my Gentleman lent for one of his
Managers in <HI>London,</HI> to come over to us to <HI>Paris</HI>
with some Diamonds, and sent him back to <HI>London</HI>
again, to fetch more; then other Business fell into
his Hands so unexpectedly, that I began to think we
should take up our constant Residence there, which
I was not very averse to it, being my Native
Country, and I spoke the Language perfectly well;
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
so we took a good House in <HI>Paris,</HI> and liv'd very
well there; and I sent for <HI>Amy</HI> to come over to
me, for I liv'd gallantly, and my Gentleman was,
two or three times, going to keep me a Coach, but
I declin'd it, elpecially at <HI>Paris;</HI> but as they have
those Conveniences by the Day there, at a certain
Rate, I had an Equipage provided for me when∣ever
I pleas'd, and I liv it here in a very good Fi∣gure,
and might have liv'd higher if I pleas'd.</P>
<P>But in the middle of all this Felicity, a dreadful
Disaster befel me, which entirely unhing'd all
my Affairs, and threw me back into the same state
of Life that I was in before; with this one happy
Exception however, that whereas before I was
Poor, even to Misery, now I was not only provi∣ded
for, but very Rich.</P>
<P>My Gentleman had the Name in <HI>Paris,</HI> for a
very rich Man, and indeed, he was so, tho' not
so immensely rich as People imagin'd; but that
which was fatal to him, was, that he generally
carried a shagreen Case in his Pocket, especially
when he went to Court, or to the Houses of any
of the Princes of the Blood, in which he had
Jewels of very great Value.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day, that being to go to <HI>Ver∣sailles,</HI>
to wait upon the Prince of—, he came
up into my Chamber in the Morning, and laid out
his Jewel-Case, because he was not going to show
any Jewels, but to get a Foreign Bill accepted,
which he had receiv'd from <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> so when
he gave me the Case, <HI>he said,</HI> My Dear, I think I
need not carry this with me, because, it may be,
I may not come back till Night, and it is too much
to venture; I return'ed, then My Dear, you sha'n't
go; Why? <HI>says he;</HI> because as they are too much
for you, so you are too much for me to venture; and
you shall not go, unless you will promise me not to
stay so as to come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="65"/>
I hope there's no Danger, <HI>said he,</HI> seeing I have
nothing about me of any Value; and therefore,
lest I should, take that too, <HI>says he,</HI> and gives me
his Gold Watch, and a rich Diamond, which he
had in a Ring, and always wore on his Finger.</P>
<P>Well, but <HI>my Dear, says I,</HI> you make me more
uneasie now, than before; for if you apprehend
no Danger, why do use this Caution? and if you
apprehend there is Danger, why do you go at
all?</P>
<P>There is no Danger, <HI>says he,</HI> if I do not stay late,
and I do not design to do so.</P>
<P>Well, but promise me then, that you won't, <HI>says
I,</HI> or else I cannot let you go.</P>
<P>I wont, indeed, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> unless I am
oblig'd to it; I assure you I do not intend it;
but if I shou'd, I am not worth robbing now; for
I have nothing about me, but about six Pistoles in
my little Purse, and that little Ring, showing me
a small Diamond Ring, worth about ten or twelve
Pistoles, which he put upon his Finger, in the
room of the rich one he usually wore.</P>
<P>I still press'd him not to stay late, and he said he
wou'd not; but if I am kept late, <HI>says he,</HI> beyond my
Expectation, I'll stay all Night, and come next
Morning: This seem'd a very good Caution; but
still my Mind was very uneasie about him, and I
told him so, and entreated him not to go; I told
him, I did not know what might be the reason, but
that I had a strange Terror upon my Mind, about
his going, and that, if he did go, I was perswaded
some Harm wou'd attend him; he smil'd, and
return'd, Well, my Dear, if it should be so, you
are now richly provided for; all that I have here,
I give to you; and with that, he takes up the
Casket, or Case, Here, <HI>says he,</HI> hold your Hand,
there is a good Estate for you, in this Case; if
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
any thing happens to me, 'tis all your own, I
give it you for yourself; and with that, he put
the Casket, the fine Ring, and his Gold Watch,
all into my Hands, and the Key of his Srutore be∣sides,
adding, and in my Scrutore there is some
Money, 'tis all your own.</P>
<P>I star'd at him, as if I was frighted, for I
thought all his Face look'd like a Death's-Head;
and then, immediately, I thought I perceiv'd his
Head all Bloody; and then his Cloaths look'd
Bloody too; and immediately it all went off, and
he look'd as he really did; immediately I fell a-crying,
and hung about him, My Dear <HI>said I,</HI> I
am frighted to Death; you shall not go, depend
upon it, some Mischief will befal you; I did
not tell him how my vapourish Fancy had repre∣sented
him to me, that I thought was not proper;
besides he wou'd only have laugh' d at me, and
wou'd have gone away with a Jest about it: But
I press'd him seriously not to go that Day, or if
he did, to promise me to come Home to <HI>Paris</HI> a∣gain
by Day-light: he look'd a little graver then,
than he did before; told me, he was not appre∣hensive
of the least Danger; but if there was, he
wou'd either take Care to come in the Day, or,
as he had said before, wou'd stay all Night.</P>
<P>But all these Promises came to nothing; for he
was set upon in the open Day, and robb'd, by three
Men on Horseback, mask'd, as he went; and one
of them, who, it seems, rifled him, while the
rest stood to stop the Coach, stabb'd him into the
Body with a Sword, so that he died immediate∣ly:
He had a Footman behind the Coach, who
they knock'd down with the Stock, or But-end
of a Carabine: They were suppos'd to kill him,
because of the Disappointment they met with, in
not getting his Case, or Casket of Diamonds, which
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
they knew he carry'd about him; and this was
suppos'd, because after they had kill'd him, they
made the Coachman drive out of the Road, a
long-Way over the Heath, till they came to a con∣venient
Place, where they pull'd him out of the
Coach, and search'd his Cloaths more narrowly,
than they cou'd do while he was alive.</P>
<P>But they found nothing but his little Ring, six
Pistoles, and the Value of about seven Livres in
small Moneys.</P>
<P>This was a dreadful Blow to me; tho' I cannot
say I was so surpriz'd as I should otherwise have
been; for all the while he was gone, my Mind
was oppress'd with the Weight of my own
Thoughts; and I was as sure that I should ne∣ver
see him any more, that I think nothing could
be like it the Impression was so strong, that, I
think, nothing could make so deep a Wound,
that was imaginary; and I was so dejected, and
disconsolate, that when I received the News of
his Disaster, there was no room for any extraor∣dinary
Alteration in me: I had cry'd all that Day,
eat nothing, and only waited, as I might say, to
receive the dismal News, which I had brought to
me about Five a-Clock in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>I was in a strange Country; and tho' I had a
pretty many Acquaintances, had but very few
Friends that I could consult on this Occasion;
all possible Enquiry was made after the Rogues,
that had been thus barbarous, but nothing could
be heard of them; nor was it possible, that
the Footman could make any Discovery of them,
by his Description; for they knock'd him down
immediately, so that he knew nothing of what
was done afterwards; the Coachman was the on∣ly
Man that cou'd say any thing, and all his Ac∣count
amounted to no more than this, that one
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
of them had Soldiers Cloaths, but he cou'd not
remember the Particulars of his Mounting, so as
to know what Regiment he belong'd to; and as
to their Faces, that he could know nothing of,
because they had all of them Masks on.</P>
<P>I had him Buried as decently as the Place would
permit a Protestant Stranger to be Buried, and
made some of the Scruples and Difficulties on that
Account, easie, by the help of Money to a cer∣tain
Person, who went impudently to the Curate
of the Parish St. <HI>Sulpitius,</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> and told him,
that the Gentleman that was kill'd, was a Catho∣lick;
that the Thieves had taken from him a
Cross of Gold, set with Diamonds, worth 6000
Livres; that his Widow was a Catholick, and
had sent by him 60 Crowns to the Church of—,
for Masses to be said for the Repose of
his Soul: Upon all which, <HI>tho' not one Word of it
was true,</HI> he was Buried with all the Ceremonies
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<P>I think I almost cry'd myself to Death for him;
for I abandon'd myself to all the Excesses of
Grief; and indeed, I lov'd him to a Degree inex∣pressible;
and considering what Kindness he had
shewn me at first, and how tenderly he had us'd
me to the last, what cou'd I do less?</P>
<P>Then the Manner of his Death was terrible and
frightful to me, and above all, the strange Notices
I had of it; I had never pretended to the Second-Sight,
or any thing of that Kind; but certainly,
if any one ever had such a thing, I had it at this
time; for I saw him as plainly in all those terrible
Shapes, as above, <HI>First,</HI> as a Skeleton, not Dead
only, but rotten and wasted; <HI>Secondly,</HI> as kill'd,
and his Face bloody; and <HI>Thirdly,</HI> his Cloaths
bloody; and all within the Space of one Minute,
or indeed, of a very few Moments.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="69"/>
These things amaz'd me, and I was a good-while
as one stupid; however, after some time, I
began to recover, and look into my Affairs; I had
the Satisfaction not to be left in Distress, or in
danger of Poverty; on the contrary, besides what
he had put into my Hands fairly, in his Life-time
which amounted to a very considerable Value I
found above seven Hundred Pistoles in Gold, in
his Scrutore, of which he had given me the Key;
and I found Foreign-Bills accepted, for about
12000 Livres; so that, in a Word, I found my∣self
possess'd of almost ten Thousand Pounds
Sterling, in a very few Days after the Disaster.</P>
<P>The first thing I did upon this Occasion, was,
to send a Letter to my Maid, as I still call'd her,
<HI>Amy;</HI> wherein I gave her an Account of my Dis∣aster,
how my Husband, as she call'd him (<HI>for I
never call'd him so</HI>) was murther'd; and as I did
not know how his Relations, or his Wife's Friends,
might act upon than Occasion, I order'd her to
convey away all the Plate, Linnen, and other
things of Value, and to secure them in a Person's
Hands that I directed her to, and then to sell,
or dispose the Furniture of the House, if she
could; and so, without acquainting any-body with
the Reason of her going, withdraw; sending No∣tice
to his Head Manager at <HI>London,</HI> that the
House was quitted by the Tennant, and they
might come and take Possession of it for the Exe∣cutors:
<HI>Amy</HI> was so dext'rous, and did her Work
so nimbly, that she gutted the House, and sent
the Key to the said Manager, almost as soon as
he had Notice of the Misfortune that befel their
Master.</P>
<P>Upon their receiving the surprizing News of
his Death, the Head Manager came over to <HI>Paris,</HI>
and came to the House; I made no Scruple of
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>
calling myself Madam—, the Widow of Mon∣sieur—,
the <HI>English</HI> Jeweller; and as I spoke
<HI>French</HI> naturally, I did not let him know but that
I was his Wife, married in <HI>France,</HI> and that I had
not heard that he had any Wife in <HI>England;</HI> but
pretended to be surpriz'd and exclaim against him
for so base an Action; and that I had good
Friend in <HI>Poictou,</HI> where I was Born, who would
take Care to have Justice done me in <HI>England,</HI> out
of his Estate.</P>
<P>I should have observ'd, that as soon as the News
was publick, of a Man being murther'd, and that
he was a jeweller, Fame did me the Favour as
to publish presently, that he was robb'd of his
Casket of Jewels, which he always carry'd about
him; I confirm'd this, among my daily Lamenta∣tions
for his Disaster, and added, that he had
with him a fine Diamond Ring, which he was
known to wear frequently about him, valued at
100 Pistoles, a Gold Watch, and a great Quantity
of Diamonds of inestimable Value, in his Casket;
which Jewels he was carrying to the Prince of—,
to show some of them to him; and the
Princc own'd, that he had spoken to him to bring
some such Jewels, to let him see them. But I sorely
repented this Part afterward as you shall hear.</P>
<P>This Rumour put an End to all Enquiry after
his Jewells, his Ring, or his Watch; and as
for the 700 Pistoles, that I secur'd: For the
Bills which, were in hand, I own'd I had them;
but that, as <HI>I said,</HI> I brought my Husband 30000
Livres Portion, I claim'd the said Bills, which
came to not above 12000 Livres, for my <HI>Amende;</HI>
and this, with the Plate, and the Houshold-Stuff,
was the principal of all his Estate which they
could come at; as to the Foreign-Bill, which he
was going to <HI>Versailles</HI> to get accepted, it was real∣ly
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>
lost with him; but his Manager, who had re∣mitted
the Bill to him, by Way of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI>
bringing over the second Bill, the Money was sav'd,
as, they call'd it, which would, otherwise, have
been also gone; the Thieves who robb'd and
murther'd him, were, to be sure, afraid to send
any-body to get the Bill accepted; for that would
undoubtedly have discover'd them.</P>
<P>By this time my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> was arriv'd, and
she gave me an Account of her Management, and
how she had secur'd every thing, and that she had
quitted the House, and sent the Key to the Head-Manager
of his Business; and let me know how
much she had made of every thing, very punctu∣ally
and honestly.</P>
<P>I should have observ'd in the Account of his
dwelling with me so long at—, that he never pass'd
for any thing there, but a Lodger in the House;
and tho' he was Landlord, that did not alter the
Case; so that at his Death <HI>Amy</HI> coming to quit
the House, and give them the Key, there was no
affinity between that, and the Case of their Ma∣ster,
who was newly kill'd.</P>
<P>I got good Advice at <HI>Paris,</HI> from an eminent
Lawyer, a Counsellor of the Parliament there,
and laying my Case before him, he directed me
to make a Process in Dower upon the Estate, for
making good my new Fortune upon Matrimony,
which accordingly I did and, upon the whole,
the Manager went back to <HI>England,</HI> well satisfied,
that he had gotten the unaccepted Bills of Ex∣change,
which was for 2500 l. with some other
things, which together, amounted to 17000 Li∣vres;
and thus I got rid of him.</P>
<P>I was visited with great Civility on this sad
Occasion, of the Loss of my Husband, as they
thought him, by a great many Ladies of Quality;
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
anid the Prince of—, to whom it was reported
he was carrying the Jewels, sent his Gentleman
with a very handsome Compliment of Condolance
to me and his Gentleman, whether with, or
without Order, hinted, as if his Highness did in∣tend
to have visited me himself, but that some Ac∣cident
which he made a long Story of, had pre∣vented
him.</P>
<P>By the Concourse of Ladies and others, that
thus came to visit me, I began to be much known;
and as I did not forget to let myself out with all
possible Advantage, considering the Dress of a
Widow, which in those Days was a most fright∣ful
thing; I say, as I did thus from my own
Vanity, for I was not ignorant that I was very
handsome I say, on this Account, I was soon
made very publick, and was known by the Name
of <HI>La Belle veufeu de Poictou;</HI> or, The pretty Wi∣dow
of <HI>Poictou:</HI> As I was very well pleas'd to see
myself thus handsomely us'd in my Affliction, it
soon dry'd up all my Tears; and tho' I appear'd
as a Widow, yet, as we lay in <HI>England,</HI> it was
of a Widow comforted: I took Care to let the
Ladies see, that I know how to receive them;
that I was not at a Loss how to Behave to any
of them; and in short, I began to be very popu∣lar
there but I had an Occasion afterwards, which
made me decline that kind of Management, as
you shall hear presently.</P>
<P>About four Days after I had received the Com∣pliments
of Condolance from the Prince—,
the same Gentleman he had sent before, came to
tell me, that his Highness was coming to give me a
Visit; I was indeed, suprized at that, and perfect∣ly
at a Loss how to Behave: However, as there
was no Remedy, I prepar'd to receive him as well
as I cou'd; it was not many Minutes after, but
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
he was at the Door, and came in, introduc'd by
his own Gentleman, as above, and after, by my
Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI></P>
<P>He treated me with abundance of Civility,
and condol'd handsomely the Loss of my Hus∣band,
and likewise the Manner of it; he told me,
he understood he was coming to <HI>Versailles,</HI> to
himself, to shew him some Jewels; that it was
true, that he had discours'd with him about
Jewels, but cou'd not imagine how any Villains
shou'd hear of his coming at that time with them;
that he had not order'd him to attend with
them at <HI>Versailles,</HI> but told him, that he would
come to <HI>Paris</HI> by such a Day, so that he was no
way accessary to the Disaster: I told him grave∣ly,
I knew very well that all his Highness
had said of that Part, was true; that these Vil∣lains
knew his Profession, and knew, no doubt,
that he always carry'd a Casket of Jewels about
him, and than he always, wore a Diamond Ring
on his Finger, worth a hundred Pistoles, which
Report had magnified to five Hundred and that
if he had been going to any other Place, it wou'd
have been the same thing; After this, his High∣ness
rise up to go, and told me, he had resolv'd
however, to make me somee Reparation; and
with these Words, put a silk Purse into my
Hand, with a hundred Pistoles, and told me, he
would make me a farther Compliment of a small
Pension, which, his Gentleman would inform me of.</P>
<P>You may be sure I behav'd with a due Sence of
so much Goodness, and offer'd to kneel to kiss his
Hand, but he took me up, and saluted me, and
sat down again, (<HI>tho' before he made as if he was
going away,</HI> making me sit down by him.</P>
<P>He then begun to talk with me more familiarly;
told me, he hop'd I was not left in bad Circum∣stances;
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
that Mr.—was reputed to be very
Rich, and that he had gain'd lately great Sums
by some Jewels; and he hop'd, <HI>he said,</HI> that I had
still a Fortune agreeable to the Condition I had
liv'd in before.</P>
<P>I reply'd, with some Tears, which, I confess,
were a little forc'd, That I believ'd if Mr.—had
liv'd, we shou'd have been out of Danger of Want;
but that it was impossible to Estimate the Loss
which I had sustain'd, besides that of the Life of
my Husband; that by the Opinion of those that
knew something of his Affairs, and of what Va∣lue
the Jewels were which he intended to have
shown to <HI>his Highness,</HI> he could not have less about
him, than the Value of a hundred Thousand Li∣vres
that it was a fatal Blow to me, and to his
whole Family, especially that they should be lost
in such a Manner.</P>
<P>His Highness return'd, with an Air of Concern,
that he was very sorry for it; but he hop'd, if I
settled in <HI>Paris,</HI> I might find Ways to restore my
Fortune; at the same time he complimented me
upon my being very handsome, <HI>as he was pleas'd to
call it,</HI> and that I could not fail of Admirers: I
stood up, and humbly thank'd <HI>his Highness,</HI> but
told him, I had no Expectations of that Kind;
that I thought I should be oblig'd to go over to
<HI>England,</HI> to look after my Husband's Effects there,
which I was told, were considerable; but that I
did not know what Justice a poor Stranger wou'd
get among them; and as for <HI>Paris,</HI> my Fortune be∣ing
so impair'd, I saw nothing before me, but to go
back to <HI>Poictou,</HI> to my Friends, where some of
my Relations, I hop'd, might do something for
me, and added, that one of my Brothers was an
<HI>Abbot</HI> at—, near <HI>Poictiers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="75"/>
He stood up, and taking me by the Hand, led
me to a large Looking-Glass, which made up the
Peir in the Front of the Parlour; Look there,
Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> Is it fit that Face, pointing to
my Figure in the Glass, should go back to <HI>Poictou?</HI>
No, Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> stay, and make some Gen∣tleman
of Quality happy, that may, in return,
make you forget all your Sorrows; and with that,
he took me in his Arms, and kissng me twice, told
me, he wou'd see me again, but with less Cere∣mony.</P>
<P>Some little time after this, but the same Day,
his Gentleman came to me again, and with great
Ceremony and Respect, deliver'd men Black Box
ty'd with a Scarlet Ribband, and seal'd with a
noble Coat of Arms, which, I suppose, was the
Prince's; there was in it a Grant from his High∣ness,
or an Assignment, I know not which to call
it, with a Warrant to his Banker to pay me two
Thousand Livres a Year, during my Stay in <HI>Paris,</HI>
as the Widow of Monsieur—the Jeweller, men∣tioning
the horrid Murther of my late Husband,
as the Occasion of it, as above.</P>
<P>I receiv'd it with great Submission, and Ex∣pressions
of being infinitely oblig'd to his Master,
and of my showing myself on all Occasions, <HI>his
his Highness's</HI> most obedient Servant; and after giving
my most humble Duty to <HI>his Highness,</HI> with the
utmost Acknowledgments of the Obligation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
I went to a little Cabinet, and taking out some
Money, which made a little Sound in taking it
out, offer'd to give him five Pistoles.</P>
<P>He drew back, but with the greatest Respect,
and told me, he humbly thank'd me, but that he
durst not take a Farthing; that <HI>his Highness</HI> wou'd
take it so ill of him, he was sure, he would never
see his face more; but that he wou'd not fail
<PB N="71" REF="76"/>
to acquaint his Highness what Respect I had of∣fer'd;
and added, I assure you, Madam, you are
more in the good Graces of my Master, the
Prince of—, than you are aware of; and I
believe you will hear more of him.</P>
<P>Now I began to understand him, and resolv'd
if his Highness did come again, he should see me
under no Disadvantages, if I could help it: I told
him, if <HI>his Highness</HI> did me the Honour to see me
again, I hop'd he would not let me be so surpriz'd
as I was before; that I would be glad to have
some little Notice of it, and would be oblig'd to
him, if he would procure it me; he told me, he
was very sure, that when <HI>his Highness</HI> intended to
visit me, he should be sent before, to give me
Notice of it; and that he would give me as much
Warning of it, as possible.</P>
<P>He came several times after this, on the same
Errand, that is, about the Settlement, the Grant,
requiring several things yet to be done, for making
it payable, without going every time to the Prince
again for a fresh Warrant; the Particulars of
this Part I did not understand; but as soon as it
was finish'd, which was above two Months, the
Gentleman came one Afternoon, and said, <HI>his
Highness</HI> design'd to visit me in the Evening;
but desir'd to be admitted without Ceremony.</P>
<P>I prepar'd not my Rooms only, but myself;
and when he came in, there was no-body ap∣pear'd
in the House but his Gentleman, and my
Maid <HI>Amy;</HI> and of her I bid the Gentleman ac∣quaint
<HI>his Highness,</HI> that she was an <HI>English</HI> Wo∣man;
that she did not understand a Word of
<HI>French;</HI> and that she was one also that might be
trusted.</P>
<P>When he came into my Room, I fell down at
his Feet, before he could come to salute me,
<PB N="72" REF="77"/>
and with Words that I had prepar'd, full of Duty
and Respect, thank'd him for his Bounty and
Goodness to a poor desolate Woman, oppress'd
under the Weight of so terrible a Disaster, and
refus'd to rise till he would allow me the Honour
to kiss his Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Levez vous donc,</HI> says the Prince, taking me in
his Arms, I design more Favours for you, than
this Trifle and going on, he added, You shall,
for the future, find a Friend where you did not
look for it; and I resolve to let you see how
kind I can be, to one, who is to me the most a∣greeable
Creature on Earth.</P>
<P>I was dress'd in a kind of half-Mourning, had
turn'd off my Weeds, and my Head, <HI>tho' I had
yet no Ribbands or Lace,</HI> was so dress'd, as fail'd
not to set me out with Advantage enough, for I
began to understand his Meaning; and the Prince
profess'd, I was the most beautiful Creature on
Earth; <HI>and where have, I liv'd?</HI> says he and how
ill have I been sev'd that I should never till now,
be shew'd the finest Woman in France?</P>
<P>This was the Way, in ail the World, the most
likely to break in upon my Virtue, if I had been
Mistress of any, for I was now become the vain∣est
Creature upon Earth, and particularly, of my
Beauty; which, as other People admir'd, so I be∣came
every Day more soolishly in Love with my∣self,
than before.</P>
<P>He said some very kind Things to me after this,
and sat down with me, for an Hour, or more;
when getting up, and calling his Gentleman,
by his Name, he threw open the Door, <HI>Au Boir,
says he;</HI> upon which, his Gentleman immediately
brought up a Jittle Table, cover'd with a fine Da∣mask
Cloth, the Table no bigger than, he cou'd
brng in his two Hands; but upon it, was set two
<PB N="73" REF="78"/>
Decanters, one of Champaign, and the other of
Water, six Silver Plates, and a Service of sine
Sweet-Meats in fine <HI>China</HI> Dishes, on a Sett of
Rings standing up about twenty Inches high, one
above another; below, was three roasted Partri∣ges
and a Quail; as soon as his Gentleman had
set it all down, he ordered him to withdraw;
now, <HI>says the Prince,</HI> I intend to Sup with you.</P>
<P>When he sent away his Gentleman, I stood up,
and offer'd to wait on <HI>his Highness</HI> while he Eat,
but he positively refus'd, and told me, No, To-Morrow
you shall be the Widow of Monsieur—the
Jeweller, but to-Night you shall be my Mis∣tress;
therefore sit here, <HI>says he,</HI> and Eat with me,
or I will get up and serve.</P>
<P>I would then have call'd tip my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI>
but I thought that would not be proper neither;
so I made my Excuse, that since <HI>his Highness</HI> wou'd
not let his own Servant wait, I wou'd not presume
to let my Woman come up; but if he wou'd
plcase to let me wait, it would be my Honour to
fill <HI>his Highness's Wine;</HI> but, as before, he Would
by no means allow me; so we sat and Eat toge∣ther.</P>
<P>Now, Madam, <HI>says the Prince,</HI> give me leave to
lay aside my Character; let us talk together with
the Freedom of Equals; my Quality sets me at a
Distance From you, and makes you ceremonious;
your Beauty exalts you to more than an Equality,
I must then treat you, as Lovers do their
Mistresses, but I cannot speak the Language
'tis enough to tell you, how agreeable you are to
me how I am surpriz'd at your Beauty, and re∣solve
to make you happy, and to be happy with
you.</P>
<P>I knew not what to say to him a good-while,
but blush'd, und looking up towards him, said,
<PB N="74" REF="79"/>
I was already made happy, in the Favour of a
person of such Rank; and had nothing to ask of
<HI>his Highness,</HI> but that he would believe me insi∣nitely
oblig'd.</P>
<P>After he had Eaten, he pour'd the Sweet-Meats
into my Lap; and the Wine being out, he call'd
his Gentleman again, to take away the Table,
who, at first, only took the Cloth, and the Remains
of what was to Eat, away and laying another
Cloth, set the Table on one side of the Room,
with a noble Service of Plate upon it, worth, at
least, 200 Pistoles; then having set the two De∣canters
again upon the Table, fill'd, as before,
he withdrew, for I found the Fellow understood
his Business very well, and his Lord's Business
too.</P>
<P>About half an Hour after, the Prince told me,
that I offer'd to wait a little before; that if I
would now take the Trouble, he would give me
leave to give him some Wine; so I went to the
Table, fill'd a Glass of Wine, and brought it to
him, on a fine Salver, which the Glasses stood on,
and brought the Bottle, or Decanter for Water, in
my other Hand, to mix it as he thought fit.</P>
<P>He smil'd, and bid me look on that Salver,
which I did, and admir'd it much, for it was a
very fine one, indeed: You may see, <HI>says be,</HI> I re∣solve
to have more of your Company, for ray Ser∣vant
shall leave you that Plate, for my Use: I
told him, I believ'd <HI>his Higness</HI> wou'd not take
it ill, that I was not Furnish'd fit to Entertain a
Person of his Rank; and that I would take great
Care of it, and value myself infinitely upon the
Honour of <HI>his Highnes's Visit.</HI></P>
<P>It now began to grow late, and he began to take
Notice of it but, <HI>says he,</HI> I cannot leave you;
have you not a spare Lodging, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one Night? I
<PB N="75" REF="80"/>
told him, I had but a homely Lodging to Enter∣tain
such a Guest; he laid something exceed∣ing
kind on that Head, but not fit to repeat;
adding, that my Company would make him a∣mends.</P>
<P>About Midnight he sent his Gentleman of an
Errand, after telling him, aloud, that he in∣tended
to stay here all Night in a little time
his Gentleman brought him a Night-Gown, Slip∣pers,
two Caps, a Neckcloth, and Shirt, which
he gave me to carry into his Chamber, and sent
his Man home; and then turning to me, said,
I shou'd do him the Honour to Be his Chamber∣lain
of the Houshold, and his Dresser also:
I smil'd, and told him, I wou'd do myseif the
Honour to wait on him upon all Occasions.</P>
<P>About One in the Morning, while his Gentle∣man
was yet with him, I begg'd Leave to withdraw,
supposing he wou'd go to-Bed but he took the
Hint, and said, I'm not going to-Bed yet; pray
let me see you again.</P>
<P>I took this time to undress me, and to come in
a new Dress, which was, in a manner, <HI>une Desha∣bile,</HI>
but so fine, and all about me so clean, and so
agreeable, that he seem'd surpriz'd: I thought,
<HI>says he,</HI> you could not have dress'd to more Advan∣tage,
than you had done before; but now, <HI>says he,</HI>
you Charm me a thousand times more, if that be
possible.</P>
<P>It is only a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oose Habit, My Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> that
I may the better wait on <HI>your Highness;</HI> he pulls
me to him You are perfectly obliging, <HI>says he,</HI>
and sitting on the Bed-side, <HI>says he,</HI> Now you
shall be a Princess, and know what it is to oblige
the gratefullest Man alive; and with that, he took
me in his Arms,—I can go no farther in the
Particulars of what pass'd at that time; but it
<PB N="76" REF="81"/>
ended in this, that, in short, I lay with him all
Night.</P>
<P>I have given you the whole Detail of this Story,
to lay it down as a black Scheme of the Way how
Unhappy Women are ruin'd by Great Men; for
tho' Poverty and Want is an irresistible Tempta∣tion
to the Poor, Vanity and Great Things are as
irresistible to others to be courted by a Prince,
and by a Prince who was first a Benefactor, then an
Admirer; to be call'd handsome, the finest Wo∣man
in <HI>France,</HI> and to be treated as a Woman fit
for the Bed of a Prince; these are Things, a
Woman must have no Vanity in her, nay, no
Corruption in her, that is not overcome by it
and my Cafe was such, that, as before, I had e∣nough
of both,</P>
<P>I had now no Poverty attending me on the
contrary, I was Mistress of ten Thou sand Pounds
before the Prince did any thing for me; had I
been Mistress of my Resolution; had I been less
obliging, and rejected the first Attack, all had
been safe; but my Virtue was lost before, and the
Devil, who had found the Way to break-in upon
me by one Temptation, casily master'd me now,
by another and I gave myself up to a Person,
who, tho' a of high Dignity, was yet the
most tempting and obliging, that ever I met with
in my Life.</P>
<P>I had the same Particular to insist upon here
with the Prince, that I had with my Gentleman
before; I hesitated much at consenting, at first
asking; but the Prince told me, Princes did not
court like other Men; that they brought more
powerful Arguments; and he very prettily added,
that they were sooner repuls'd than other Men, and
ought to be sooner comply'd with intimating,
tho' very genteely, that after a Woman had posi∣tively
<PB N="77" REF="82"/>
refus'd him once, he cou'd not, like other
Men, wait with Importunities and Stratagems
and laying-long Sieges; but as such Men as he
Storm'd warmly, so, if repuls'd, they made no se∣cond
Attacks; and indeed it was but reasonable;
for as it was below their Rank, to be long battering
a Woman 's Constancy, so they ran greater Ha∣zards
in being expos'd in their Amours, than
other Men did.</P>
<P>I took this for a satisfactory Answer, and told
<HI>his Highness,</HI> that I had the same Thoughts, in re∣spect
to the Manner of his Attacks, for that his
Person, and his Arguments were irresistible; that
a Person of his Rank; and a Munificence so un∣bounded,
cou'd not be withstood; that no Virtue
was Proof against him, except such, as was able
too, to suffer Martyrdom; that I thought it im∣possible
I cou'd be overcome, but that now I
found it was impossible I shou'd not be overcome;
that so much Goodness, join'd with so much
Greatness, wou'd have conquer'd a Saint; and
that I confess'd he had the Victory over me, by
a Merit infinitely superior to the Conquest he had
made.</P>
<P>He made me a most obliging Answer; told
me, abundance of fine things, which still flatter'd
my Vanity, till at last I began to have Pride e∣nough
to believe him, and fancy'd myself a fit
Mistress for a Prince.</P>
<P>As I had thus given the Prince the Last Favour,
and he had all the Freedom with me, that it was
possible for me to grant, so he gave me Leave to
use as much Freedom with him, another Way,
and that was, to have every thing of him, I
thought fit to command; and yet I did not ask
of him with an Air of Avarice, as it I was
greedily making a Penny of him; but I manag'd
<PB N="78" REF="83"/>
him with such. Art, that he generally anticipated
my Demands he only requested of me, that I
wou'd not think of taking another House, as I
had intimated to <HI>his Highness</HI> that I had intend∣ed,
not thinking it good enough to receive his
Visits in; but, <HI>he saia,</HI> my House was the most
convenient that could possibly be found in all <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI>
for an Amour, especially for him having a
Way out into Three Streets, and not over∣look'd
by any Neighbours, so that he could pass
and repass, without Observation; for one of the
Back-ways open'd into a narrow dark Alley,
which Alley was a Thorow-fare, or Passage, out
of one Street into another; and any Person that
went in or out by the Door, had no more to
do, but to see, that there was no-body fol∣lowing
him in the Alley, before he went in at
the Door: This Request I knew was reasonable,
and therefore I assur'd him, I wou'd not change
my Dwelling, seeing <HI>his Highness</HI> did not think it
too mean for me to receive him in.</P>
<P>He also desir'd me, that I wou'd not take any
more Servants, or let up any Equipage, at least,
for the present; for that it would then be imme∣diately
concluded, I had been left very Rich, and
then I shou'd be throng'd with the Impertinence
of Admirers, who wou'd be attracted by the Mo∣ney,
as well as by the Beauty of a young Widow,
and he shou'd be frequently in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errupted in his
Visits or, that the World wou'd conclude I was
maintain'd by somebody, and wou'd be inde∣fatigable
to find out the Person; so that he shou'd
have Spies peeping at him, every rime he went out
or in, which it wou'd be impossible to disappoint;
and that he shou'd presently have it talk'd over
all the Toilets in <HI>Paris,</HI> that the Prince de—had
got the Jeweller's Widow sot a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="84"/>
This was too just to oppose; and I made no
Scruple to tell <HI>his Highness,</HI> that since he had
stoop'd so low as to make me his own, he ought
to have all the Satisfaction in the World, that
I was all his own; that I would take all Mea∣sures
he should please to direct me, to avoid the
impertinent Attacks of others; and that, if he
thought fit, I would be wholly within-Doors, and
have it given out, that I was obliged to go to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
to sollicit ray Affairs there, after my Hus∣band's
Misfortune and that I was not expected
there again for at least a Year or two: This he
lik'd very well, only, <HI>he said,</HI> that he would by
no means have me confin'd that it would injure
my Health; and that I should then take a Coun∣try-House
in some Village, a good-way off of the
City, where it should not be known who I was;
and that I should be there sometimes, to divert
me.</P>
<P>I made no Scruple of the Confinement, and told
<HI>his Highness,</HI> no Place could be a Confinement,
where I had such a Visiter; and so I put off the
Country-House, which would have been to re∣move
myself farther from him, and have less of
his Company; so I made the House be, as it were
shut up; <HI>Amy,</HI> indeed, appear'd; and when any
of the Neighbours and Servants enquir'd, she an∣swer'd
in broken <HI>French</HI> that I was gone to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
to look alter my Affairs; which presently
went current thro' the Streets about us: For, you
are to note, that the People of <HI>Paris,</HI> espe∣cially
the Women, are the most busie and im∣pertinent
Enquirers into the Conduct of their
Neighbours, espccially that of a Single Woman,
that are in the World; tho' there are no
greater Intriguers in the Universe than them∣selves;
<PB N="80" REF="85"/>
and perhaps that may be the Reason of
it; for it is an old, but a sure Rule; that
<Q><L>When deep Intrigues are close and shy,</L>
<L>The GUILTY are the first that spy.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus <HI>his Highness</HI> had the most easie, and yet
the most undiscoverable Access to me, imaginable,
and he seldom fail'd to come two or three Nights
in a Week, and sometimes stay'd two or three
Nights together: Once he told me, he was re∣solv'd
I should be weary of his Company and
that he would learn to know what it was to be a
Prisoner; so he gave out among his Servants, that
he was gone to—, where he often went a
Hunting, and that he should not return under a
Fortnight; and that Fortnight he stay'd wholly
with me, and never went out of my Doors.</P>
<P>Never Woman, in such a Station, liv'd a Fort∣night
in so compleat a fullness of Humane De∣light;
for to have the entire Possession of one of
the most accomplish'd Princes in the World, and
of the politest, best bred Man; to converse with
him all Day, and, <HI>as he profess'd,</HI> charm him all
Night; what could be more inexpressibly pleasing,
and especially, to a Woman of a vast deal' of
Pride, as I was?</P>
<P>To finish the Felicity of this Part, I must not
forget, that the Devil had play'd a new Game with
me, and prevail'd with me to satisfie myself with
this Amour, as a lawful thing; that a Prince of
such Grandeur, and Majesty; so infinitely supe∣rior
to me, and one who had made such an Intro∣duction
by an unparalell'd Bounty, I could not re∣sist;
and therefore, that it was very Lawful for
me to do it, being at that time perfectly single,
<PB N="81" REF="86"/>
and uningag'd to any other Man; as I was, most
certainly, by the unaccountable Absence of my
first Husband, and the Murther of my Gentle∣man,
who went for my second.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted but that I was the easier
to perswade myself of the Truth of such a, Do∣ctrine
as this, when it was so much for my Ease,
and for the Repose of my Mind, to have it be so.</P>
<Q><L>In Things we wish, 'tis easie to deceive;</L>
<L>What we would have, we willingly believe.</L></Q>
<P>Besides, I had no Casuists to resolve this
Doubt; the same Devil that put this into my
Head, bade me go to any of the <HI>Romish</HI> Clergy,
and under the Pretence of Consession, state the
Case exactly, and I should see they would either
resolve it to be no Sin at all, or absolve me upon
the easiest Pennance: This I had a strong Incli∣nation
to try, but I know not what Scruple put
me off of it, for I could never bring myself to
like having to do with those Priests; and tho' it
was strange that I, who had thus prostituted my
Chastity, and given up all Sence of Virtue, in two
such particular Cases, living a Life of open A∣dultery,
should scruple any thing yet so it was, I
argued with myself that I could not be a Cheat
in any thing that was esteem'd Sacred; that I
could not be of one Opinion, and then, pretend
myself to be of another nor could I go to Con∣fession,
who knew nothing of the Manner of it,
and should betray myself to the Priest, to be a
Hugonot, and then might come into Trouble; but,
In short, tho' I was a Whore, yet I was a Prote∣stant
Whore, and could not act as if I was Popish,
upon any Account whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="87"/>
But, I say, satisfy'd myself with the surpriz∣ing
Occasion, that, as it was all irresistable, so it
was all lawful; for that Heaven would not suffer
us to punish'd for that which it was not possi∣ble
for us to avoid; and with these Absurdities I
kept Conscience from giving me any considerable
Disturbance in all this Matter; and I was as per∣fectly
easie as to the Lawfulness of it as if I had
been Marry'd to he Prince, and had no other
Husband: So possible is it for us to roll ourselves
Up in Wickedness, till we grow invulnerable by
Conscience and that Centinel once doz'd, sleeps
fast, not be awaken'd while the Tide of Plesure
continues to flow, or till something dark and dread∣ful
brings us to ourselve again.</P>
<P>I have, I confess, wonder'd at the Stupidity that
my intellectual Part was under all that while;
what Lethargick Fumes doz'd the Soul; and how
it was possible tlaat I, who in the Case before,
where the Temptation was many ways more forci∣ble,
and the Arguments Argument, stronger and more irri∣sistable,
was yet under a continued Inquietude on
account of the wicked Life I led, could now live
in the most profound Tranquility, and with an
uninterrupted Peace, nay, even rising up to Satis∣faction,
and Joy, and yet in a more palpable
State of Adultery <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an before; for before, my
Gentleman who call'd me Wise, had the Pretence
of His Wise being parted from him, refusing to
do the. Duty of her Office as a Wife to him as
for me, my Circumstances were the same; but as
for the Prince, as he had a, fine and extraordinary
Lady, or Princess, of his own; so he had had
two or three Mistresses more besides me, and made
no Scruple of it at all.</P>
<P>However, I say, as to my own Fart, I enjoy'd
myself in perfect Tranquility: and as the Prince
<PB N="83" REF="88"/>
was the only Deity I worshipp'd, so I was really
his Idol; and however it was with his Princess
I assure you, his other Mistresses found a senfible
Difference; and tho' they could never find me out,
yet I had good Intelligence, that they guess'd ve∣ry
well, that their Lord had got some new Fa∣vourite,
that robb'd them of his Company, and
perhaps, of some of his usual Bounty too: And
now I must mention the Sacrifices he made to his
Idol, and they were not a few, I assure you.</P>
<P>As he lov'd like a Prince so he rewarded, like a
Prince; for tho' he declin'd my making a Fi∣gure,
as above, he let me see, that he was above
doing it for the saving the, Expence of it, and,so
he told me, and that he would make it up in o∣ther
things: First of all, he sent me a Toilet,
with all the Appurtenances of Silver, even so
much as the Frame of the Table; and then, for
the House, he gave me the Table, or Side-board of
Plate I mention'd above, with all things belonging
to it, of massy Silver; so that, in short, I could
not, for my Life, study to ask him for any thing of
Plate which I had not.</P>
<P>He could then accomodate me in nothing more
but Jewels and Cloaths, or Money for Cloaths;
he sent his Gentleman to the Mercer's, and bought
me a Suit, or whole Piece, of the finest Bro∣caded
Silk, figur'd with Gold, and another with
Silver, and another of Crimson; so that I had
three Suits of Cloaths, such as the Queen of <HI>France</HI>
would not have disdain'd to have worn at that
time; yet I went out no-where but as those
were for me to put on, when I went out of Mourn∣ing,
I dress'd myself in them, one after another,
always when <HI>his Highness</HI> came to see me.</P>
<P>I had no less than five several Morning Dresses
besides these, so that I need never be seen twice
<PB N="84" REF="89"/>
in the same Dress; to these he added several Par∣cels
of fine Linnen, and of Lace, so much, that I
had no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oom to ask for more, or indeed, for so
much.</P>
<P>I took the Liberty once, in our Freedoms, to
tell him, he was too Bountiful, and that I was too
chargeable to him for a Mistress, and that I would
be his faithful Servant, at less Expence to, him;
and that he not only left me no room to ask him
for any thing, but that he supply'd me With such
a Profusion of good, things, that I scarce, could
wear them, or use them; unless I kept a great
Equipage, which he knew was no way conveni∣ent
for him, or for me; he smil'd and took me
in his Arms, and told me, he was resolv'd, while
I was his, I should never be able to ask him for
any-thing; but that he-would be daily asking new
Favours of me.</P>
<P>After we were, up, for this Conference was in
Bed, he desir'd would dress me in the best Suit
of Cloaths had It was a Day or two after the
three Suits were made, and brought home; I told
him, if he pleas'd, I would rather dress me in
that Suit which I knew he lik'd belt, he ask'd
me, how I could know which he would like best,
before he had seen them? I told him, I would
Presume, for once, to guess at his Fancy-by my
own; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I went away, and dress'd me in the se∣cond
Suit, brocaded With Silver, and return'd in
full Dress, with a Suit of Lace upon my Head,
which; would have been worth, in <HI>England,</HI> 200 l.
Sterling; and I was every Way set cut as well as
<HI>Amy</HI> could, dress me, who was a very gentile Dres∣ser
too: In this Figure I came to him, out of my
Dressing-Room, which open'd with Folding-Doors
into his Bed-Chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90"/>
He sat as one astonish'd, a good-while, looking
at me, without speaking a Word, till came quit
up to him, kneel'd on one Knee to him, and al∣most
whether he would or no, kiss'd his Hand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he took me up, and stood up himself, but; was
surpriz'd, when taking me in his Arms, he perceiv'd
Tears to run down my Cheeks; My Dear, <HI>says they</HI>
aloud, what mean these Tears? My Lord, <HI>said I,</HI>
after some little Cheek, for I cou'd not speak pre∣sently,
I beseech you to believe me, they are not
Tears of Sorrow, but Tears of Joy; it is impos∣sible
for me to see myself snatch'd from the Misery
It was fallen into, and at once to be in the Arms of
a Prince of such Goodness, such immense Boun∣ty,
and be treated in such a Manner; 'tis not pos∣sible,
my Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> to contain the Satisfaction
of it; and it will break out in an Excess in some
measure proportion'd to your immense Bounty,
and to the Affection which your Highness treats
me with, who am so infinitely below you.</P>
<P>It wou'd look a little too much like a Romance
here, to repeat all the kind things he said to me,
on that Occasion; but I can't omit one Passage; as
he saw the Tears drop down my Cheek, he pulls
out a fine Cambrick Hankerchief, and was going
to wipe the Tears off, but check'd his Hand, as it
he was afraid to deface something; I say, he
check'd his Hand and toss'd the Handkerchief
to me, to do it myself; I took the Hint immedi∣ately,
and with a kind of pleasant Disdam, <HI>How,
my Lord! said I, Have you kiss'd me so often and
don't you know whether I am Painted, or not? Pray
let your Highness satisfie yourself? that you have no
Cheats put upon you, for once let me be vain enough
to say, I have not deceiv'd you with false Colours:</HI>
With this, I put a Handkerchief into his Hand,
and taking his Hand into mine, I made him wipe
<PB N="86" REF="91"/>
my Face so hard, that he was unwilling to do it,
for fear of hurting me.</P>
<P>He appear'd surpriz'd more than ever, and
swore, which was the first time that I had heard
him swear, from my first knowing him, that he
cou'd not have believ'd there was any such Skin,
without Paint, in the World; <HI>Well, my Lord,</HI> said I,
<HI>your Highness shall have a farther Demonstration than
this; as to that which you are pleas'd to accept for
Beauty, that it is the meer Work of Nature;</HI> and
with that, I stept to the Door, and rung a little
Bell, for my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> and bade her bring
me a Cup-full of hot Water, which she did; and
when it was come, I desir'd <HI>his Highness</HI> to feel
if it was warm; which he did, and I immedi∣ately
wash'd my Face all over with it, before
him; this was, indeed, more than Satisfaction,
that is to say, than Believing for it was an unde∣niable
Demonstration, and he kiss'd my Cheeks
and Breasts a thousand times, with Expressions of
the greatest Surprize imaginable.</P>
<P>Nor was I a very indifferent Figure as to Shape;
tho' I had had two Children by my Gentleman, and
fix by my true Husband, I say, I was no despisa∣ble
Shape and my Prince I must be allow'd the
Vanity to call him so) was taking his View of me as
I walk'd from one End of the Room to the other,
at last he leads me to the darkest Part of the
Room, and standing behind me, bade me hold
up my Head, when putting both his Hands
round my Neck, as if he was spanning my Neck,
to see how small it was, for it was long and small;
he had my Neck so long, and so hard, in his
Hand, that I complain'd he hurt me a little; what
he did it for, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> new not, nor had I the least Sus∣picion
but that he was spanning my Neck; but
when I said he hurt me, he scemd to let go, and
<PB N="87" REF="92"/>
in half a Minute more, led me to a Peir-Glass,
and behold, I saw my Neck clasp'd with a fine
Necklace of Diamonds; whereas I felt no more
what he was doing, than if he had really
done nothing at-all, nor did I suspect it, in
the least; it I had an Ounce of Blood in me,
that did not fly up into my Face; Neck, and
Breasts, it must be from some Interruption in
the Vessels; I was all on fire with the Sight,
and began to wonder what it was that was coming
to me.</P>
<P>However, to let him see that I was not unqual∣lified
to receive Benefits; I turn'd about, My
Lord, <HI>says I,</HI> Your Highness is resolv'd to conquer
by your Bounty, the very Gratitude of your Ser∣vants;
you will leave no room for any thing but
Thanks; and make those Thanks useless too, by
their bearing no Proportion to the Occasion.</P>
<P>I love, Child, <HI>says he,</HI> to see every thing suita∣ble
a fine Gown and Petticoat, a fine lac'd Head;
a fine Face and Neck, and no Necklace, would
not have made the Object perfect: But why that
Blush, in Dear, <HI>says the Prince?</HI> My lord, <HI>said I,</HI>
all your Gifts call for Blushes; but above all, I
blush to receive what I all so ill able to merit, and
may become so ill also.</P>
<P>Thus far I am a standing Mark of the Weakness
of Great Men, in their Vice that value not squan∣dring
away immense Wealth, upon the most
worthless Creatures; or to sum it up in a Word,
they raise the Value of the Object which they
pretend to pitch upon, by their Fancy; I say,
raise the Value of it, at their own Expence; give
vast Presents for a ruinous Favour, which is so
far from being equal to the Price, that nothing
will, at last, prove more absurd, than the Cost
Men are at to purchase their own Destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="93"/>
I cou'd not, in the height of all this fine doings,
I say, I cou'd not be without some just Reflection,
tho' Conscience was, as I said, dumb as to any
Disturbance it gave me in my Wickedness, my
Vanity was fed up to such a height, that I had
no room to give Way to such Reflections.</P>
<P>But I could not but sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook back, with
Astonishment, at the Folly of Men of Quality, who
immense in their Bounty, as in their Wealth,
give to a Profusion, and without Bounds, to
the most scandalous of our Sex, for granting them
the Liberty of abusing themselves and ruining
both.</P>
<P>I, that knew what this Carcass is of mine had been
but a few Years before; how overwhelm'd with
Grief, drown'd in Tears, frighted with the Pros∣pect
of Buggery' and surrounded with Rags, and
Fatherless Children; that was pawning and sel∣ling
the Rags that cover'd me, for a Dinner, and
sat on the Ground, despairing of Help, and ex∣pecting
to be starv'd, till ray Children were
snatch'd from me, to be kept by the Parish; I,
that was afrer this, a Whore for Bread, and aban∣doning
Conscience and Virtue, liv'd with another
Woman's Husband, I, that was despis'd by all
my Relations, and my Husband's too; I, that
that was left so entirely desolate, friendless, and
helpless, that I knew not how to get the least
Help to keep me, from starving; that I should
be caress'd by a Prince, for the Honour of having
the scandalous Use of my Prostituted Body, com∣mon
before to his Inferiours; and perhaps wou'd
not have denied one of his Footmen but a little
while before, if I cou'd ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> got my Bread by it.</P>
<P>I say, I cou'd not but reflect upon the Brutallity
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Mankind; that because Nature
had given me a good Skin, and some agreeable
<PB N="89" REF="94"/>
Features' should suffer that Beauty to be such a
Bait to Appetite as to do such sordid, unaccoun∣table
things, to obtain the Possession of it.</P>
<P>It is for this Reason, that I have so largely set∣down
the Particulars of the Caresses; I was treated
with by the Jeweller, and also by this Prince; not
to make the Story an Incentive to the Vice, which
I am now such a sorrowful Penitent for being guil∣ty
of, <HI>God forbid any shou'd make so vile a Vse of so
good a Design,</HI> but to draw the just Picture of a Man
enslay'd to the Rage of his vicious Appetite; how
he defaces the Image of God in his Soul; de∣thrones
his Reason; causes Conscience to abdi∣cate
the Possession, and exalts Sence into the va∣cant
Throne; how he deposes the Man, and ex∣alts
the Brute.</P>
<P>O! could we hear now, the Reproaches this
Great Man afterwards loaded himself with, when
he grew weary of this admir'd Creature, and be∣came
sick of his Vice! how profitable would the
Report of them be to the Reader of this Story;
but had he himself also known the dirty History
of my Actings upon the Stage of Life, that little
time I had been in the World, how much more
severe would those Reproaches have been upon
himself but: I shall come to this again.</P>
<P>I liv'd in this gay sort of Retirement almost
three Years, in which time, no Amour of such a
Kind, sure, was ever carry'd up so high; the
Prince knew no Bounds to his Munificence; he
cou'd give me nothing, either for my wearing or
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing, or eating, or drinking, more than he had
done from the Beginning.</P>
<P>His Presents were, alter that, in Gold, and very
frequent, and large; often a hundred Pistoles, ne∣ver
less than fifty; at a time and I must do my∣self
the Justice that I seem'd rather backward to
<PB N="90" REF="95"/>
receive, than craving, and encroaching; not that
I had not an avaricious Temper; nor was it, that
I did not foresee that this was my Harvest, in
which I was to gather up, and that it would not
last long; but it was, that really his Bounty al∣ways
anticipated my Expectations, and even my
Wishes; and he gave me Money so fast, that he
rather pour'd it in upon me, than left me room to
ask it; so that, before I could spend fifty Pistoles,
I had always a hundred to make it up.</P>
<P>After I had been near a Year and a half in his
Arms, as above, or thereabouts, I prov'd with-Child;
I did not take any Notice of it to him, till
I was satisfied, that I was not deceiv'd when
one Morning early, when we were in Bed toge∣ther,
I said to him, My Lord, I doubt your
Highness never gives yourself Leave to think,
what the Case should be, if I should have the
Honour to be wich-Child by you: Why, my
Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> we are able to keep it, it such a
thing should happen I hope you are not concern'd
about that: No my Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> I should think
myself very happy, if I could bring your High∣ness
a Son, I should hope to see him a Lieutenant-General
of the King's Armies, by the Interest of
his Father, and by his own Merit.</P>
<P>Assure yourself, Child, <HI>says he,</HI> if it shou'd be so,
I will not refuse owning him for my Son, tho' it
be, as they call it, a Natural Son; and shall never
slight or neglect him, for the sake of his Mother:
Then he began to importune me, to know if it
was so but I positively denied it so long, till at
last, I was able to give him the Satisfaction of
knowing it himself, by the Motion of the Child
within me.</P>
<P>He profess'd himself overjoy'd at the Discover,
bur rold me, that now it was absolutely necessary
<PB N="91" REF="96"/>
for me to quit the Confinement, which, he faid, I
had suffer'd for his sake, and to take a House
somewhere in the Country, in order for Health,
as well as for Privacy, against my Lying-in: This
was quite out of my Way; but the Prince, who
was a Man of Pleasure, had, it seems, several Re∣treats
of this Kind, which he had made use of,
I suppose, upon like Occasions; and so leaving it,
as it were, to his Gentleman, he provided a very
convenient House, about four Miles <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI>
at the Village of—, where I had very a∣greeable
Lodgings, good Gardens, and all things
very easie, to my Content; but one thing did
not please me at all, <HI>viz.</HI> that an Old Woman
was provided, and put into the House, to furnish
every thing necessary to my Lying-in, and to assist
at my Travel.</P>
<P>I did not like this Old Woman at all; she look'd
so like a Spy upon me, or, (as sometimes I was
frighted to imagine) like one set privately to dis∣patch
me out of the World, as might best suit
with, the Circumstance of my Lying-in; and
when his Highness came the next time to see me,
which was not many Days, I expostulated a little
on the Subject of the Old Woman; and by the
Management of my Tongue, as well as by the
Strength of reasoning, I convinc'd him, that it
would not beat all convenient; that it would be
the greater Risque on his Side; and that first, or
last, it would certainly expose him, and me also
I assur'd him, that my Servant being an <HI>English</HI>
Woman, never knew, to that Hour, who his High∣ness
was; that I always call'd him the <HI>Count de
Clerac;</HI> and that she knew nothing else of him,
nor ever should, that if he would give me leave
to choose proper Persons for my Use, it shou'd
be so order'd, that not one of them should know
<PB N="92" REF="97"/>
who he was, or perhaps, ever see his Face and
that for the reallity of the Child that should be
born, his Highness, who had alone been at the
first of it, should, if he pleas'd, be present in the
Room all the Time; so that he would need no
Witnesses on that Account.</P>
<P>This Discourse fully satified him, so that he or
pipe der'd his Gentleman to dismiss the Old Woman
the same Day; and, without any Difficulty, I sent
my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>Callais,</HI> and thence to <HI>Dover,</HI>
where she got<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an <HI>English</HI> Midwife, and an <HI>English</HI>
Nurse, come over, on purpose to attend an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Lady of Quality, as they stil'd me, for four
Months certain: The Midwife, <HI>Amy</HI> had agreed:
to pay a hundred Guineas to, and bear her Char∣ges
to <HI>Paris,</HI> and back again to <HI>Dover;</HI> the poor
Woman that was to be my Nurse, had twenty
Pounds, and the same Term for Charges, as the
other.</P>
<P>I was very easie when <HI>Amy</HI> return'd, and the
more because the brought with the Midwife, a
good Motherly sort of Woman, who was to be
her Assistant, and would be very helpful on Occa∣sion,
and bespoke a Man-Midwife at <HI>Paris</HI> too, if
there should be any Necessity for his Help: Ha∣ving
thus made Provision for every thing, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for so we all call'd him in publick, came as
often to see me, as I could expect, and conti∣nued
exceeding kind, as he had always been one
Day, conversing together, upon the Subject of my
being with-Child, It told him how all things were
in order; but that I had a strange Apprehension
that I should die with that Child: He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mil'd, <HI>So all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> say,</HI> my Dear, says he, <HI>when they are with-Celld,</HI>
Well, however, my Lord, faid I, it is but
just, that care should be taken, that what you
just that care should be taken, that what you
Have bestow'd in your Excess of Bounty upon
<PB N="93" REF="98"/>
me, should not be lost and upon this, I pull'd a
Paper out of my Bosom, folded up, but not seal'd,
and I read it to him: Wherein I had left Order,
that all the Plate and Jewels, and fine Furniture,
which his Highness had given me, should be re∣stor'd
to him by my Woman, and the Keys be
immediately deliver'd to his Gentleman, in case of
Disaster.</P>
<P>Then I recommended my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> to his
Favour for a hundred Pistoles, on Condition she
gave the Keys up, as above, to his Gentleman,
and his Gentleman's Receipt for them when he
saw this, <HI>My Dear Child,</HI> said he, and took me in
his Arms, <HI>What have, you been making your Will,
and disposing your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffects? Pray who do you make
your universal Heir?</HI> So far as to do Justice to your
Highness, in case of Mortality, I have, my Lord,
<HI>said I,</HI> and who should I dispose the valuable
things to, which I have had from your Hand, as
Pledges of your Favour, and Testimonies of your
Bounty, but to the Giver of them? If the Child
should live, your Highness will, I don't question,
act like yourself in that Part, and I shall have the
utmost Satisfaction, that it will be well us'd by
your Direction.</P>
<P><HI>I con'd see he took this very well:</HI> I have forsa∣ken
all the Ladies in <HI>Paris, says he,</HI> for you and I
have liv'd every Day since I knew you, to see that you
know how to merit all that a Man of Honour can do
for you; be easie, Child, I hope you shall not-die; and
all you have is your own, to do what with it you please.</P>
<P>I was then within about two Months of my
Time, and that soon wore off when I found my
Time was come, it fell out very happily, that he
was in the House, and I entreated he would con∣tinue
a few Hours in the House, which he a∣greed
to; they call'd his Highness to come into
<PB N="94" REF="99"/>
the Room, if he pleas'd, as I had offer'd, and as
I desir'd him, and I sent Word, I would make as
few Cries as possible, to prevent disturbing him;
he came into the Room once, and call'd to me, to
be of good Courage, it wou'd soon be over, and
then he withdrew again; and in about half an
Hour more, <HI>Amy</HI> carried him the News, that I
was Deliver'd, and had brought him a charming
Boy; he gave her ten Pistoles for her News,
stay'd till they had adjusted things about me, and
then came into the Room again, chear'd me, and
spoke kindly to me, and look'd on the Child, then
withdrew; and came again the next Day, to vi∣sit
me.</P>
<P>Since this, and when I have look'd back
upon these things with Eyes unpossess'd with
Crime, when the wicked Part has appear'd in its
clearer Light, and I have seen it in its own natural
Colours; when no more blinded with the glitter∣ing
Appearances, which at that time deluded me,
and, <HI>as in like Cases, if I may guess at others by my∣self,</HI>
too much possess'd the Mind; I say, since
this, I have often wonder'd, with what Pleasure,
or Satisfaction, the Prince cou'd look upon the
poor innocent Infant; which, tho' his own, and
that he might: that Way have some Attachment in
his Affections to it, yet must always afterwards
be a Remembrancer to him of his most early
Crime and which was worse, must bear upon it∣self
unmerited, an eternal Mark of Infamy, which
should be spoken of upon all Occasions, to its Re∣proach,
from the Folly of its Father, and Wicked∣ness
of its Mother.</P>
<P>Great Men are, indeed, deliver'd from the Bur∣then
of their Natural Children, or Bastards, as to
their Maintenance: This is the main Affliction
in other Cases, where there is not Substance
<PB N="95" REF="100"/>
suffcient, without, breaking into the Fortunes of
the Family, in those Cases, either a Man's legi∣timate
Children suffer, which is very unnatural;
or the unfortunate Mother of that illegitimate Birth,
has a dreadful Affliction, either of being turn'd
off with her Child, and be left to starve, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
or of seeing the poor Infant pack'd off with a
Piece, of Money, to some of those She-Butchers,
who take Children off of their Hands, as 'tis
call'd; that is to say, starve 'em, and, in a Word,
murther 'em.</P>
<P>Great Men, I say, are deliver'd from this Bur∣then,
because they are always furnish'd to supply
the Expence of their Out-of-the-Way Off-spring,
by making little Assignments upon the Bank of
<HI>Lyo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> or the Town-House of <HI>Paris,</HI> and settling
those Sums, to be receiv'd for the Maintainance of
such Expence as they see Cause.</P>
<P>Thus, in the Case of this Child of mine, while
he and I convers'd, there was no need to make any
Appointment, as an Appennage, or Maintenance
for the Child, or its Nurse; for he supplied me
more than sufficiently for all those things; but
afterward, when Time, and a particular Circum∣stance,
put an End to our conversing together; as
such things always meet with a Period, and gene∣rally
break off abruptly I say, after that, I found
he appointed the Children a settled Allowance,
by an Assignment of annual Rent, upon the Bank
of <HI>Lyons,</HI> which was sussicient for bringing them
handsomely, tho' privately, up in the World; and
that not in a Manner unworthy of their Father's
Blood, tho' I came to be sunk and forgotten in
the Case; nor did the Children ever know any∣thing
of their Mother, to this Day, other, than as
you may have an Account hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="101"/>
But to look back to the particular Observation I
was making, which, I hope may be of Use to
those who read my Story; I say, it was something
wonderful to me, to see this Person so exceedingly
delighted at the Birth of this Child, and so pleas'd
with it; for he would sit and look at it, and with
an Air of Seriousness sometimes, a great while to∣gether;
and particularly, I observ'd, he lov'd to
look at it when it was asleep.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, a lovely, charming Child, and
had a certain Vivacity in its Countenance, that
is, far from being common to all Children so
young; and he would often say to me, that he be∣liev'd
there was something extraordinary in the
Child, and he did not doubt but he would come
to be a Great Man.</P>
<P>I could never hear him say so, but tho' secretly
it pleas'd me, yet it so closely touch'd me another
Way, that I could not refrain Sighing, and some∣times
Tears; and one time, in particular, it so
affected me, that I could not conceal it from him;
but when he saw Tears run down my Face, there
was no concealing the Occasion from him; he
was too importunate to be deny'd, in a thing of
that Moment; so I frankly answer'd, It sensibly
affects me, My LORD, <HI>said I,</HI> that whatever
the Merit of this little Creature may be, he must
always have a Bend on his Arms; the Disaster
of his Birth will be always, not a Blot only to
his Honour, but a Bar to his Fortunes in the
World; our Affection will be ever his Affli∣ction,
and his Mother's Crime be the Son's Re∣proach;
the Blot can never be wip'd out by the
most glorious Actions; nay, if it lives to raise a
Family, <HI>said I,</HI> the Infamy must descend even to
its innocent Posterity.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="102"/>
He took the Thought, and sometimes told me
afterwards, that it made a deeper Impression on
him, than he discover'd to me at that time; but
for the present, he put it off, with telling me,
these things cou'd not be help'd; that they serv'd
for a Spur to the Spirits of brave Men; inspir'd
them with the Principles of Gallantry, and
prompted them to brave Actions; that tho' it
might be true, that the mention of Illegitimacy
might attend the Name, yet that Personal Virtue
plac'd a Man of Honour above the Reproach of
his Birth; that as he had no Share in the Offence, he
would have no Concern at the Blot; when having
by his own Merit plac'd himself out of the reach
of Scandal, his Fame shou'd drown the Memory
of his Beginning.</P>
<P>That as it was usual for Men of Quality to make
such little Escapes, so the Number of their Natu∣ral
Children were so great, and they generally
took such good Care of their Education, that
some of the greatest Men in the World had a
Bend in their Coats of Arms, and that it was of
no Consequence to them, especially when their
Fame began to rise upon the Basis of their acquir'd
Merit; and upon this, he began to reckon up to
me some of the greatest Families in <HI>France,</HI> and
in <HI>England</HI> also.</P>
<P>This carry'd off our Discourse for a time; but
I went farther with him once, removing the
Discourse from the Part attending our Children,
to the Reproach which those Children would be
apt to throw upon us, their Orginals; and when
speaking a little too feelingly on the Subject, he
began to receive the Impression a little deeper than
I wish'd he had done; at last he told me, I;
had almost acted the Confessor to him; that I
might, perhaps, preach a more dangerous Doctrine
<PB N="98" REF="103"/>
to him, than we shou'd either of us like, or than
I was aware of; for, <HI>my Dear, says he,</HI> if once we
come to talk of Repentance, we must talk of
parting.</P>
<P>If Tears were in my Eyes before, they flow'd
too fast now to be restrain'd, and I gave him but
too much Satisfaction by my Looks, that I had
yet no Reflections upon my Mind, strong enough
to go that Length, and that I could no more think
of Parting, than he could.</P>
<P>He said a great many kind things, which were
Great, like himself, and extenuating our Crime,
intimated to me, that he cou'd no more part with
me, than I cou'd with him; so we both, as I
may say, even against our Light, and against our
Conviction, concluded to SIN ON, indeed, his
Affection to the Child, was one great Tye to
him, for he was extremely fond of it.</P>
<P>This Child liv'd to be a considerable Man:
He was first, an Officer of the Guard <HI>du Corps</HI> of
<HI>France;</HI> and afterwards Colonel of a Regiment of
Dragoons, in <HI>Italy;</HI> and on many extraordinary
Occasions, shew'd, that he was not unworthy such
a Father, but many ways deserving a legitimate
Birth, and a better Mother: Of which hereafter.</P>
<P>I think I may say now, that I liv'd indeed like
a Queen; or if you will have me confess, that my
Condition had still the Reproach of <HI>a Whore,</HI> I
may say, I was sure, the Queen of Whores; for
no Woman was ever more valued, or more caress'd
by a Person of such Quality, only in the Station
of a Mistress; I had, indeed, one Deficiency,
which Women in such Circumstances seldom are
chargeable with; namely, I crav'd nothing of
him; I never ask'd him for any thing in my
Life; nor suffer'd myself to be made use of, as is
too much the Custom of Mistresses, to ask Fa∣vours
<PB N="99" REF="104"/>
for others; his Bounty always prevented
me in the first, and my strict concealing myself,
in the last; which was no less to my Convenience,
than his.</P>
<P>The only Favour I ever ask'd of him, was, for
his Gentleman, who he had all along intrusted
with the Secret of our Affair, and who had once
so much offended him, by some Omissions in his
Duty, that he found it very hard to make his
Peace; he came and said his Case before my Wo∣man,
<HI>Amy,</HI> and begg'd her to speak to me, to
interceed for him; which I did, and on my Ac∣count,
he was receiv'd again, and pardon'd; for
which, the grateful Dog requited me, by getting
to-Bed to his Benefactress, <HI>Amy;</HI> at which I was
very angry; but <HI>Amy</HI> generously acknowledg'd,
that it was her Fault as much as his; that she
lov'd the Fellow so much, that she believ'd, if
he had not ask'd her, she should have ask'd
him; I say, this pacify'd me, and I only obtain'd
of her, that she should not let him know, that I
knew it.</P>
<P>I might have interspers'd this Part of my Story
with a great many pleasant Parts, and Discourse,
which happen'd between my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and I;
but I omit them, on account of my own Story,
which has been so extraordinary: However, I
must mention something, as to <HI>Amy,</HI> and her
Gentleman; I enquir'd of <HI>Amy,</HI> upon what
Terms they came to be so intimate; but <HI>Amy</HI>
seem'd backward to explain herself; I did not
care to press her upon a Question of that Na∣ture,
knowing that she might have answer'd my
Question with a Question, and have said, Why,
how did I and the Prince come to be so intimate?
so I left off farther inquiring into it, till after
some time, she told it me all freely, of her own
<PB N="100" REF="105"/>
Accord, which, to cut it short, amounted to no
more than this, that <HI>like</HI> Mistress, <HI>like</HI> Maid;
as they had many leisure Hours together below,
while they waited respectively, when his Lord
and I were together above; I say, they could
hardly avoid the usual Question one to another,
namely, Why might not they do the same thing
below, that we did above?</P>
<P>On that Account, indeed, as I said above, I
could not find in my Heart to be angry with
<HI>Amy;</HI> I was indeed, afraid the Girl would have
been with-Child too, but that did not happen,
and so there was no Hurt done; for <HI>Amy</HI> had
been hansell'd before, as well as her Mistress,
and by the same Party too, <HI>as you have heard.</HI></P>
<P>After I was up again, and my Child provided
with a good Nurse, and withal, Winter coming
on, it was proper to think of coming to <HI>Paris</HI>
again, which I did; but as I had now a Coach
and Horses, and some Servants to attend me, by
my Lord's Allowance, I took the Liberty to have
them come to <HI>Paris</HI> sometimes, and so to take a
Tour into the Garden of the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> and the
other pleasant Places of the City: It happened one
Day, that my Prince (if I may call him so) had
a-Mind to give me some Diversion, and to take
the Air with me; but that he might do it, and
not be publickly known, he comes to me in a
Coach of the Count <HI>de</HI>—, a great Officer
of the Court, attended by his Liveries also; so
that, in a word, it was impossible to guess by the
Equipage, who I was, or who I belong'd to; al∣so,
that I might be the more effectually conceal'd,
he order'd me to be taken up at a Mantua-Ma∣ker's
House, where he sometimes came, whe∣ther
upon other Amours, or not, was no Busi∣ness
of mine to enquire: I knew nothing whither
<PB N="101" REF="106"/>
he intended to carry me; but when be was in the
Coach, with, me, he told me, he had order'd his
Servants to go to Court with me, and he would
shew me some of the <HI>Beau Monde;</HI> I told him, I
car'd not where I went, while I had the Honour to
have him with me; so he carried me to the fine
Palace of <HI>Meudon,</HI> where the <HI>Dauphine</HI> then was,
and where he had some particular Intimacy with
one of the <HI>Dauphine</HI>'s Domesticks, who procur'd a
Retreat for me in his Lodgings, while we stay'd
There; which was three or four Days.</P>
<P>While I was there, the KING happen'd to
come thither, from <HI>Versailles,</HI> and making but a
short Stay, visited Madam the <HI>Dauphiness,</HI> who
was then living: The Prince was here <HI>Incognito,</HI>
only because of his being with me; and there∣fore,
when he heard, 'that the KING was in the
Gardens, he kept close within the Lodgings; but
the Gentleman, in whose Lodgings we were, with
his Lady, and several others, were out to see the
KING, and I had the Honour to be ask'd to go
with them.</P>
<P>After we had seen the KING, who did not
stay long in the Gardens, we walk'd up the Broad
Terrass, and crossing the Hall, towards the Great
Stair-Case, I had a Sight, which confounded me
at once, as, I doubt not, it wou'd have done to
any Woman in the World: The Horse-Guards,
or what they call there the <HI>Gensd' arms,</HI> had up∣on
some Occasion, been either upon Duty, or been
Review'd, or something (I did not understand that
Part) was the Matter, that occasion'd their being
there, I know not what; but walking in the
Guard-Chamber, and with his Jack-Boots on, and
the whole Habit of the Troop, as it is worn,
when our Horse-Guards are upon Duty, as they
call it, at St. <HI>James</HI>'s-Park; I say, there, to my
<PB N="102" REF="107"/>
inexpressible Confusion, I saw Mr.—, my
first Husband, the Brewer.</P>
<P>I cou'd not be deceiv'd; I pass'd so near him,
that I almost brush'd him with my Cloaths, and
look'd him full in the Face, but having my Fan be∣fore
my Face, so that he cou'd not know me;
however, I knew him perfectly well, and I heard
him speak, which was a second Way of knowing
him; besides, <HI>being, you may be sure, astonish'd and
surpriz'd at such a Sight,</HI> I turn'd about after I had
pass'd him some Steps, and pretending to ask the
Lady that was with me, some Questions, I stood
as if I had view'd the Great Hall, the outer Guard-Chamber,
and some other things; but I did it, to
take a full View of his Dress, that I might far∣ther
inform myself.</P>
<P>While I stood thus amusing the Lady that was
with me, with Questions, he walk'd, talking with
another Man of the same Cloth, back again, just
by me; and to my particular Satisfaction, or Dis∣satisfaction,
take it which way you will, I heard
him speak <HI>English,</HI> the other being, it seems, an
<HI>Englishman.</HI></P>
<P>I then ask'd the Lady some other Questions;
Pray, Madam, <HI>says I,</HI> what are these Troopers,
here? are they the KING's Guards? <HI>No, says she,</HI>
they are the <HI>Gensd' arms;</HI> a small Detachment of
them, I suppose, attended the KING to-Day,
but they are not his Majesty's ordinary Guard;
another Lady that was with her, said, No, Ma∣dam,
it seems that is not the Case; for I heard
them saying, the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> were here to-Day by
special Order, some of them being to march towards
the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and these attend for Orders; but they
go back to-Morrow to <HI>Orleans,</HI> where they are ex∣pected.</P>
<P>This satisfied me in Pait, but I found Means
<PB N="103" REF="108"/>
after this, to enquire, whose particular Troop it
was that the Gentlemen that were here, belong'd
to; and with that, I heard, they would all be at
<HI>Paris</HI> the Week alter.</P>
<P>Two Days after this, we return'd for <HI>Paris,</HI>
when I topk Occasion to speak to my Lord, that
I heard the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> were to be in the City
the next Week, and that I should be charm'd
with seeing them March, if they came in a Body:
He was so obliging in such things, that I need
but just name a thing of that Kind, and it was
done; so he order'd his Gentleman (I shou'd now
call him <HI>Amy's Gentleman,</HI>) to get me a Place in a
certain House, where I might see them March.</P>
<P>As he did not appear with me on this Occa∣sion,
so I had the Liberty of taking my Woman,
<HI>Amy,</HI> with me; and stood where we were very
well accommodated for the Observation which I
was to make: I told <HI>Amy</HI> what I had seen, and
she was as forward to make the Discovery, as I
was to have her, and almost as much surpriz'd
at the thing itself;sh a Word, the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> en∣ter'd
the City, as was expected, and made a most
glorious Show indeed, being new-cloath'd and
arm'd, and being to have their Standards bless'd
by the Archbishop of <HI>Paris;</HI> on this Occasion,
they indeed, look'd very gay; and as they
march'd very leisurely, I had time to take as cri∣tical
a View, and make as nice a Search among
them, as I pleas'd: Here, in a particular Rank,
eminent for one monstrous siz'd Man on the Right;
here, I say, I saw my Gentleman again, and a very
handsome jolly Fellow he was, as any in the
Troop, tho' not so monstrous large as that great
one I speak of, who it seems was however, a
Gentleman of a good Family in <HI>Gascogne,</HI> and was
call'd the <HI>Giant of Gascogne.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="109"/>
It was a kind of a good Fortune to us, among
the other Circumstances of it, that something
caus'd the Troops to Halt in their March, a lit∣tle
before that particular Rank came right-against
that Window which I stood in, so that then we
had Occasion to take our full View of him, at
a small Distance, and so, as not to doubt of his
being the same Person.</P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> who thought she might, on many Ac∣counts,
venture with more Safety to be particular,
than I cou'd, ask'd her Gentleman, how a parti∣cular
Man, who she saw there, among the <HI>Gens∣d'arms,</HI>
might be enquir'd after, and found out;
she having seen an <HI>Englishman</HI> riding there, which
was suppos'd to be dead in <HI>England</HI> for several
Years before she came out of <HI>London,</HI> and that his
Wife had marry'd again: It was a Question the
Gentleman did not well understand how to an∣swer;
but another Person, that stood by, told
her, if she wou'd tell him the Gentleman's Name,
he wou'd endeavour to find him out for her, and
ask'd jestingly, if he was her Lover? <HI>Amy</HI> put that
off with a Laugh, but still continued her Enquiry,
and in such a Manner, as the Gentleman easi∣ly
perceiv'd she was in earnest; so he left ban∣tering,
and ask'd her in what Part of the Troop
he rode; she foolishly told him his Name, which
she shou'd not have done; and pointing to the
Comet that Troop carried, which was not then
quite out of Sight, she let him easily know where-abouts
he rode, only she cou'd not name the Cap∣tain;
however, he gave her such Directions af∣terwards,
that, in short, <HI>Amy,</HI> who was an inde∣fatigable
Girl, found him out, it seems he had
not chang'd his Name, not supposing any Enquiry
would be made after him here; but, I say, <HI>Amy</HI>
found him out, and went boldly to his Quarters,
<PB N="105" REF="110"/>
ask'd for him, and he came out to her immedi∣ately.</P>
<P>I believe I was not more confounded at my first
seeing him at <HI>Meudon,</HI> than he was at seeing <HI>Amy;</HI>
he started, and turn'd pale as Death; <HI>Amy</HI> be∣liev'd,
if he had seen her at first, in any conveni∣ent
Place for so villainous a Purpose, he would
have murther'd her.</P>
<P>But he started, as I say above, and ask'd in
<HI>English,</HI> with an Admiration, What are you! <HI>Sir,</HI>
says she, <HI>don't you know me? Yes,</HI> says he, <HI>I knew
you when you were alive, but what you are now,</HI> whe∣ther
Ghost or Substance, <HI>I know not: Be not afraid,
Sir, of that, says Amy,</HI> I am the same <HI>Amy</HI> that
I was in your Service, and do not speak to you now
for any Hurt, but that I saw you accidentally, Yester∣day
ride among the Soldiers, I thought you might be
glad to hear from your Friends at <HI>London: Well,</HI>

I did not love them all very well, but because I

upon them, and which it was not in my Power to

<SPEAKER>Amy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't give you any farther Account, Sir;
my Mistress would not let me stay with her any
<PB N="107" REF="112"/>
longer; she said, she could neither pay me, or sub∣sist
me; I told her, I wou'd serve her without
any Wages, but I cou'd not live without Victuals,
you know; so I was forc'd to leave her, <HI>poor Lady,</HI>
sore against my Will, and I heard afterwards,
that the Landlord seiz'd her Goods, so she was,
I supppose, turn'd out of Doors; for as I went by
the Door, about a Month after, I saw the House
shut up; and about a Fortnight after that, I found
there were Workmen at work, fitting it up, as I
suppose, for a new▪ Tennant; but none of the
Neighbours could tell me what was become of my
poor Mistress, only that they said, she was so poor,
that it was next to begging; that some of the
neighbouring Gentlefolks said reliev'd her, or that
else she must have starv'd; then she went on, and
told him, that after that, they never heard any
more of <HI>[me]</HI> her Mistress; but that she had
been seen once or twice in the City, very shabby,
and poor in Cloaths, and it was thought she work'd
with her Needle, for her Bread: All this, the
<HI>Jade</HI> said with so much Cunning, and manag'd
and humour'd it so well, and wip'd her Eyes,
and cry'd so artificially, that he took it all as
it was intended he should, and once or twice she
saw Tears in his Eyes too: He told her, it was a
moving, melancholly Story, and it had almost
broke his Heart at first; but that he was driven
to the last Extremity, and cou'd do nothing, but
stay and see 'em all starve, which he cou'd not
bear the Thoughts of, but shou'd have Pistol'd
himself, if any such thing had happen'd while he
was there; that he left <HI>[me,]</HI> his Wife, all the
Money he had in the World, but 25 l. which
was as little as he could take with him, to seek
his Fortune in the World; he cou'd not doubt
but that his Relations, seeing they were all Rich,
<PB N="108" REF="113"/>
wou'd have taken the poor Children off, and not
let them come to the Parish; and that his Wife
was young and handsome, and, he thought, might
Marry again, perhaps; to her Advantage; and for
that very Reason, he never wrote to her, or let
her know he was alive, that she might, in a rea∣sonable
Term of Years, marry, and perhaps, mend
her Fortunes: That he resolv'd never to claim
her, because he should rejoice to hear, that she had
settled to her Mind; and that he wish'd there
had been a Law made, to empower a Woman to
marry, if her Husband was not heard of in so
long time; which time, he thought, shou'd not
be above four Year, which was long enough to send
Word in, to a Wife or Family, from any Part of
the World.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> said, she cou'd say nothing to that; but
this, that she was satisfied, her Mistress would
marry no-body, unless she had certain Intelli∣gence
that he had been dead, from somebody that
saw him buried; but alas! <HI>says Amy,</HI> my Mistress
was reduc'd to such dismal Circumstances, that
no-body wou'd be so foolish to think of her, un∣less
it had been somebody to go a-begging with
her.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> then seeing him so perfectly deluded, made
a long and lamentable Outcry, how she had been
deluded away, to marry a poor Footman; for
he is no worse, or better, <HI>says she,</HI> tho' he calls
himself a Lord's Gentleman; and here, <HI>says Amy,</HI>
he has dragg'd me over into a strange Country,
to make a Begger of me; and then she falls a
howling again, and sniveling; which, by the
way, was all Hypocrisie, but acted so to the Life,
as perfectly deceiv'd him, and he gave entire Cre∣dit
to every Word of it.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="114"/>
Why, <HI>Amy, says be,</HI> you are very well dress'd,
you don't look as if you were in danger of being
a Begger; <HI>Ay,</HI> hang him, <HI>says Amy,</HI> they love to
have fine Cloaths here, if they have never a Sm—k
under them; but I love to have Money in Cash,
rather than a Chest full of fine Cloaths; besides,
Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> most of the Cloaths I have, were gi∣ven
me in the last Pluce I had, when I went away
from my Mistress.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of the Discourse, <HI>Amy</HI> got out
of him, what Condition he was in, and how he
liv'd, upon her Promise to him, that if ever she
came to <HI>England,</HI> and should see her old Mi∣stress,
she should not let her know that he was
alive: <HI>Alas!</HI> Sir, <HI>says Amy,</HI> I may never come to
see <HI>England</HI> again, as long as I live; and if I
shou'd, it wou'd be ten Thousand to One, whe∣ther
I shall seemy old Mistress; for how shou'd
I know which▪ Way to look for her? or what
Part of <HI>England</HI> she may be in; not I, <HI>says she,</HI> I don't
so much as know how to enquire for her, and if I
shou'd, <HI>says Amy,</HI> ever be so happy as to see her, I
would not do her so much Mischief as to tell her
where you were, Sir, unless she was in a Con∣dition
to help herself and you too; This farther
deluded him, and made him entirely open in his
conversing with her: As to his own Circum∣stances,
he told her, she saw him in the highest
Preferment he had arrived to, or was ever like
to arrive to; for, having no Friends or Acquain∣tance
in <HI>France,</HI> and which was worse, <HI>no Money,</HI>
he never expected to rise; that he could have
been made a Lieutenant to a Troop of Ligh-Horse
but the Week before, by the Favour of an
Officer in the <HI>Gensd'arms,</HI> who was his Friend; but
that he must have found 8000 Livres to have
paid for it, to the Gentleman who possess'd it,
<PB N="110" REF="115"/>
and had Leave given him to sell: <HI>But where cou'd
I get</HI> 8000 <HI>Livers,</HI> says he, <HI>that have never been Ma∣ster
of 500 Livres Ready-Money,</HI> at a-time, <HI>since I
came into</HI> France?</P>
<P>O Dear! <HI>Sir, says Amy,</HI> I am very sorry to
hear you say so, I fancy if you once got up to
some Preferment, you wou'd think of my old
Mistress again, and do something for her; poor
Lady, <HI>says Amy,</HI> she wants it, to besure, and then
she falls a-crying again; 'tis a sad thing, indeed,
<HI>says she,</HI> that you should be so hard put to it for
Money, when you had got a Friend to recom∣mend
you, and shou'd lose it for want of Money;
ay, so it was, <HI>Amy,</HI> indeed, <HI>says he;</HI> but what can
a Stranger do, that has neither Money or Friends?
Here <HI>Amy</HI> puts in again on my Account; well,
<HI>says she,</HI> my poor Mistress has had the Loss, tho'
she knows nothing of it; O dear! how happy it
would have been, to besure, Sir, you wou'd have
help'd her all you cou'd; <HI>Ay,</HI> says he, <HI>Amy, so I
wou'd,</HI> with all my Heart; <HI>and even as I am, I</HI> wou'd
send her some Reliefs if I thought she wanted it; only,
that then letting her know I was alive, might do her
some Prejudice, in case of her settling, or marrying
any-body.</P>
<P>Alas! <HI>says Amy,</HI> Marry! who will marry her,
in the poor Condition she is in? And so their
Discourse ended for that Time.</P>
<P>All this was meer Talk on both Sides, and
Words of Course; for on farther Enquiry, <HI>Amy</HI>
sound, that he had no such Offer of a Lieutenant's
Commission, or any thing like it; and that he
rambled in his Discourse, from one thing to ano∣ther:
But of that in its Place.</P>
<P>You may be sure, that this Discourse, as <HI>Amy</HI> at
first related it, was moving, to the last Decree,
upon me; and I was once going to have sent him,
<PB N="111" REF="116"/>
the 8000 Livres, to purchase the Commission he
had spoken of; but as I knew his Character better
than any-body, I was willing to search a little
farther into it; and so I set <HI>Amy</HI> to enquire of
some other of the Troop, to see what Character
he had, and whether there was any-thing in the
Story of a Lieutenant's Commission, or no.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> soon came to a better Understanding
of him; for she presently learnt, that he had a
most scoundrel Character; that there was nothing
of Weight in any thing he said; but that he was,
in short, a meer Sharper; one that would stick
at nothing to get Money, and that there was no
depending on any thing he said; and that, more
especially, about the Lieutenant's Commission, she
understood, that there was nothing at-all in it;
but they told her, how he had often made use of
<HI>that Sham,</HI> to borrow Money, and move Gentle∣men
to pity him, and lend him Money, in hopes
to get him Preferment; that he had reported,
that he had a Wife, and five Children, in <HI>England,</HI>
who he maintain'd out of his Pay; and by these
Shifts had run into Debt in several Places; and
upon several Complaints for such things, he had
been threatned to be turn'd out of the <HI>Gensd'arms;</HI>
and that, in short, he was not to be believ'd in
any thing he said, or trusted on any Account.</P>
<P>Upon this Information, <HI>Amy</HI> began to cool in
her farther meddling with him; and told me, it
was not safe for me to attempt doing him any
Good, unless I resolv'd to put him upon Suspici∣ons
and Enquiries, which might be to my Ruin,
in the Condition I was now in.</P>
<P>I was soon confirm'd in this Part of his Cha∣racter;
for the next time that <HI>Amy</HI> came to talk
with him, he discover'd himself more effectually;
for while she had put <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Hopes or procuring
<PB N="112" REF="117"/>
One to advance the Money for the Lieutenant's
Commission for him, upon easie Conditions, he by
Degrees, dropt the Discourse, then pretended it
was too late, and that he could not get it; and
and then descended to ask poor <HI>Amy</HI> to lend him
500 Pistoles.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> pretended Poverty; that her Circum∣stances
were but mean; and that she cou'd not
raise such a Sum; and this she did, to try him
to the utmost; he descended to 300, then to
100, then to 50, and then to a Pistole, which she
lent him, and he never intending to pay it, play'd
out of her Sight, as much as he cou'd; and thus
being satisfied that he was the same worthless
Thing he had ever been, I threw off all Thoughts
of him; whereas, had he been a Man of any
Sence, and of any Principle of Honour, I had it
in my Thoughts to retire to <HI>England</HI> again, send
for him over, and have liv'd honestly with him:
But as <HI>a Fool</HI> is the worst of Husbands to do a
Woman Good, so <HI>a Fool</HI> is the worst Husband a
Woman can do Good to: I wou'd willingly have
done him Good, but he was not qualified to re∣ceive
it, or make the best Use of it; had I sent
him ten Thousand Crowns, instead of eight Thou∣sand
Livres, and sent it with express Condition,
that he should immediately have bought himself
the Commission he talk'd of, with Part of the
Money, and have sent some of it to relieve the
Necessities of his poor miserable Wife at <HI>London,</HI>
and to prevent his Children to be kept by the
Parish, it was evident, he wou'd have been still
but a private Trooper, and his Wife and Children
ihould still have starv'd at <HI>London,</HI> or been kept of
meer Charity, as, for ought he knew, they then
were.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="118"/>
Seeing therefore, no Remedy, I was oblig'd to
withdraw my Hand from, him, that had been my
first Destroyer, and reserve the Assistance that I
intended to have given him, for another more de∣sirable
Opportunity; all that I had now to do,
was to keep myself out of his Sight, which was
not very difficult for me to do, considering in what
Station he liv'd.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> and I had several Consultations then, up∣on
the main Question, namely, how to be sure
never to chop upon him again, by Chance, and
so be surpriz'd into a Discovery; which would
have been a fatal Discovery indeed: <HI>Amy</HI> pro∣pos'd,
that we shou'd always take Car to know
where the <HI>Gensd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arms</HI> were quarter'd, and thereby
effectually avoid them; and this was one Way.</P>
<P>But this was not so as to be fully to my Sa∣tisfaction;
no ordinary Way of enquiring where
the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> were quarter'd, were sufficient to
me; but I found out a Fellow, who was compleatly
qualified for the Work of a Spy, (for <HI>France</HI> has
Plenty of such People,) this Man I employ'd
to be a constant and particular Attendant upon
his Person and Motions; and he was espe∣cially
employ'd, and order'd to haunt him <HI>as a
Ghost,</HI> that he should scarce let him be ever out
of his Sight; he perform'd this to a Nicety, and
sail'd not to give me a perfect Journal of all his
Motions, from Day to Day; and whether for his
Pleasures, or his Business, was always at his
Heels.</P>
<P>This was somewhat expensive, and such a Fel∣low
merited to be well paid; but he did his Bu∣siness
so exquisitely punctual, that thin poor Man
scarce went out of the House, without my know∣ing
the Way he went, the Company he kept, when
he went Abroad, and when he stay'd at Home.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="119"/>
By this extraordinary Conduct I made myself
safe, and so went out in publick, or stay'd at-home,
as I found he was, or was not, in a Possi∣bility
or being at <HI>Paris,</HI> at <HI>Versailles,</HI> or any Place
I had Occasion to be at: This, tho' it was very
chargeable, yet as I found it absolutely necessary,
so I took no Thought about the Expence of it;
for I knew I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not purchase my Safety too
dear.</P>
<P>By this Management I found an Opportunity
to see what a most insignificant, unthinking Life,
the poor indolent Wretch, who by his unactive
Temper had at first been my Ruin, now liv'd;
how he only rose in the Morning, to go to-Bed at
Night; that saving the necessary Motion of the
Troops, which he was oblig'd to attend, he was a
meer motionless Animal, of no Consequence in
the World; that he seem'd to be one, who, tho'
he was indeed, alive, had no manner of Business
in Life, but to stay to be call'd out of it; he
neither kept any Company, minded any Sport,
play'd at any Game, or indeed, did any thing of
moment; but, <HI>in shert,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about, like one,
that it was net two Livres Value whether he was
dead or alive; that when he was gone, would
leave no Remembrance behind him that ever he
was here; that if ever he did any thing in the
World to be talk'd of, it was, only to get five
Beggers, and starve his Wife: The Journal of his
Life, which I had constantly sent me every Week,
was the least significant of any-thing of its Kind,
that was ever seen; us it had really nothing of
Earnest in it, so it wou'd make no Jest, to relate
it; it was not important enough, so much as to
make the Reader merry withal; and for that Rea∣son
I omit it.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="120"/>
Yet this <HI>Nothing-doing Wretch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was I oblig'd to
watch and guard against, as against the only thing
that was capable of doing me Hurt in the World,
I was to shun him, as we wou'd shun a Spectre, or
even the Devil, if he was actually in our Way;
and it cost me after the Rate of a 150 Livres a
Month, and very cheap too, to have this Crea∣ture
constantly kept in View; <HI>that is to say,</HI> my
Spy undertook, never to let him be out of his
Sight an Hour, but so as that he cou'd give an Ac∣count
of him; which was much the easier for be
done, considering his Way or Living; for he was
sure, that for whole Weeks together, he wou'd be
ten Hours of the Day, half asleep on a Bench at
the Tavern-Door where he quarter'd, or drunk
within the House.</P>
<P>Tho' this wicked Life he led, sometimes mov'd
me to pity him, and to wonder show so well-bred,
Gentlemanly a Man as he once was, could degene∣rate
into such a useless thing, as he now appear'd;
yet, at the same time, it gave me most con∣temptible
Thoughts o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, an made me often
say, I was a Warning for all the Ladies of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
against maryiag of FOOLS; a Man of Sence
falls in the World, and gets-up again, and a Wo∣man
has some Chance for herself; but with a
FOOL! once fall, and ever undone; once in the
Ditch, and die in the Ditch; once poor, and sure
to starve.</P>
<P>But 'tis time to have done with him, once I
had nothing to hope for, but to see him again;
now my only Felicity was, it possible, never to
see him, and, above all, to keep him from see∣ing
me; which, as above, I took effectual Care
of.</P>
<P>I was now return'd to <HI>Paris;</HI> my little <HI>Son of
Honour;</HI> as I call'd him, was left at—, where
<PB N="116" REF="121"/>
my last Country Seat then was, and I came to
<HI>Paris,</HI> at the Prince's Request; thither he came to
me as soon as I arriv'd, and told me, he came to
give me Joy of my Return, and to make his Ac∣knowledgments,
for that I had given him a SON: I
Thought indeed, he had been going to give me
a Present, and so he did the next Day, but in
what he said then, he only jested with me: He
gave me his Company all the Evening; Supp'd
with me about Midnight, and did me the Honour,
as I then call'd it, to lodge me in his Arms all the
Night, telling me, in jest, that the best Thanks for
a son born, was giving the Pledge for another.</P>
<P>But as I hinted, so it was, the next Morning he
laid me down, on my Toilet, a Purse with 300
Pistoles: I saw him say it down, and understood
what he meant, but I took no Notice of it, till I
came to it (as it were) casually; then I gave a
great Cry-out, and fell a-scolding in my Way, for
he gave me all possible Freedom of Speech, on
such Occasions: I told him, he was unkind;
that he would never give me an Opportunity to
ask him for any thing; and that he forc'd me
to Blush, by being too much oblig'd, <HI>and the like;</HI>
all which I knew was very agreeable to him; for
as he was Bountiful, beyond Measure, so he was
infinitely oblig'd by my being so backward to ask
any Favours; and I was even with him, for I
never ask'd him for a Fathing in my Life.</P>
<P>Upon this rallying him, he told me, I had ei∣ther
perfectly studied the Art of Humour, or else,
what was the greatest Difficulty to others, was
Natural to me; adding, That nothing cou'd be
more obliging to a Man of Honour, than not to
be solliciting and craving.</P>
<P>I told him, nothing cou'd be craving upon him;
that he left no room for it, that I hop'd he did
<PB N="117" REF="122"/>
not give, meerly to avoid the Trouble of being
importun'd; I told him, he might depend upon
it, that I should be reduc'd very low indeed, be∣fore
I offer'd to disturb him that Way.</P>
<P>He said, a Man of Honour ought always to
know what he ought to do; and as he did no∣thing
but what he knew was reasonable, he gave
me Leave to be free with him, if I wanted any
thing; that he had too much Value for me, to
deny me any thing, if I ask'd; but that it was
infinitely agreeable to him to hear me say, that
what he did, was to my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>We strain'd Compliments thus a groat while, and
as he had me in his Arms most Part of the Time, so
upon all my Expressions of his Bounty to me, he
put a Stop to me with his Kisses, and wou'd ad∣mit
me to go on no farther.</P>
<P>I should in this Place mention, that this Prince
was not a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> tho' at that Time he
resided at <HI>Paris,</HI> and was much at Court, where, I
suppose, he had or expected some considerable Em∣ployment:
But I mention at on this Account; that
a few Days after this, he came to me, and told me,
he was come to bring, me not the most welcome
News that ever I heard from him in his Life;
I look'd at him, a little surpriz'd; but he return'd,
Do not be uneasie, it is as unpleasant to me, as to
you, but I come to consult with you about it, and
see, if it cannot be made a little easie to us both.</P>
<P>I seem'd still more concern'd, and surpriz'd;
at last he said, it was, that he believ'd he should
be oblig'd to go into <HI>Italy;</HI> which tho' otherwise
it was very agreeable to him, yet his parting with
me, made it a very dull thing but to think of.</P>
<P>I sat mute, as one Thunder-struck, for a good-while;
and it presantly occur'd to me, that I was
going to lose him, which, indeed, I cou'd but ill
<PB N="118" REF="123"/>
bear the Thoughts of; and as he told me, I turn'd
pale: What's the Matter? <HI>said he, hastily;</HI> I have
surpriz'd you, indeed; and stepping no the Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-Board,
fills a Dram o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cordial-Water, (which was
of his own bringing) and comes to me, Be not
surprizd, <HI>said be,</HI> I'll go no-where without you;
adding several other things so kind, as nothing
could exceed it.</P>
<P>I might, indeed, turn pale, for I was very much
surpriz'd at first, believing that this was, as it of∣ten
happens in such Cases, only a Project to drop
me, and break off an Amour, which he had now
carried on so long; and a thousand Thoughts
whirl'd about my Head in the few Moments while
I was kept in suspence; (for they were but a few)
I say, I was indeed, surpriz'd, and might, per∣haps,
look pale; but I was not in any Danger of
Fainting, that I knew of.</P>
<P>However, it not n little pleas'd me, to see
him so concern'd and anxious about me; but I
stopp'd a little, when he put the Cordial to my
Mouth, and taking the Glats in Hand, <HI>I said,</HI>
My Lord, your Words are insinitely more of a
Cordial to me, than this Citron; for as nothing
can be a greater Affliction, than to lose you, soo
nothing can be a greater Satisfaction than the As∣surance,
that I shall not ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that Misfortune.</P>
<P>He made me sit down, and sat down by me, and
after saying a thousand kind things to me; he turns
upon me, with a Smile, Why, will you venture
your'd to <HI>Italy</HI> with me? <HI>says <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e;</HI> I stopp'd a-while,
and then answer'd, that I wonder'd the would ask
me that Question; for I would go any-where in the
World, or all over the World, wherever he shou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
desire me, and give me the Felicity of this Com∣pany.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="124"/>
Then he enter'd into a long Account of the
Occasion of his Journey, and how the King
had Engag'd him to go, and some other Cir∣cumstances,
which are not proper to enter into
here; it being by no means proper to say any∣thing,
that might lead the Reader into the least
Guess at the Person.</P>
<P>But to cut short this Part of the Story, and the
History of our Journey, and Stay abroad, which
would almost fill up a Volume of itself, I say, we
spent all that Evening in chear ul Consultations a∣bout
the Manner of our Travelling; the Equi∣page
and Figure lie shou'd go in; and in what
Manner I shou'd go: Several Ways were propos'd,
but none seem d s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asible till, at last, I told him,
I thought it wou'd be so troublesome, so expen∣sive,
and so publick, that it wou'd be many
Ways inconvenient to him; and tho' it was a
kind of Death to me, to lose him, yet that ra∣ther
than so very much perplex his Affairs, I
wou'd submit to any-thing.</P>
<P>At the next Visit I fill'd his Head with the
same Difficulties, and then, at last, came over
him with a Proposal, that I wou'd stay in <HI>Paris,</HI>
or where else he shou'd direct; and when I heard
of his sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Arrival, wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d come away by myself,
and place myself as near him as I cou'd.</P>
<P>This gave him no Satisfaction at all; nor wou'd
he hear any more of it; but if I durst venture
myself, as be call'd it, such a Journey, he wou'd
not lose the Satisfaction of my Company; and as
for the Expence, that was not to be nam'd, nei∣ther,
indeed, was there room to name it; for I
found, that he travell<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d at the KING's Expence,
as well for himself, as for all his Equipage; being
upon a Piece of secret Service of the last Impor∣tance.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="125"/>
But after several Debates between ourselves, he
came to this Resulution, <HI>viz.</HI> that he wou'd tra∣vel
<HI>Incognito,</HI> and so he shon'd avoid all publick
Notice, either of himself, or of who went with
him; and that then he shou'd not only carry me
with him, but have a perfect Leisure of enjoying
my agreeable Company, (<HI>as he was pleas'd to call it</HI>)
all the Way.</P>
<P>This was so obliging, that nothing cou'd be
more;so upon this Foot, he immediately set to
Work to prepare things for his Journey; and by
his Directions, so did I too: But now I had a
terrible Difficulty upon me, and which way to get
over it, I knew not; and that was, in what Man∣ner
to take Care of what I had to leave behind
me; I was Rich, as I have said, very Rich, and
what to do with it, I knew not, nor who to leave
in Trust, I knew nor; I had no-body but <HI>Amy,</HI>
in the World, and to travel without <HI>Amy,</HI> was
very uncomfortable; or to leave all I had in the
World with her, and if she miscarried, be ruin'd
at once, was still a frightful Thought; for <HI>Amy</HI>
might die, and whose Hands things might fall
into, I knew not: This gave me great Uneasi∣ness,
and I knew not what to do; for I could not
mention it to the Prince, lest he should see that I
was richer than he thought I was.</P>
<P>But the Prince made all this easie to me; for in
concerning Measures for our Journey, he started the
thing himself, and ask'd me merrily one Evening,
who I wou'd trust with all my Wealth, in my
Absence?</P>
<P>My Wealth, my Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> except what I
owe to your Goodness, is but small; but yet,
that little I have, I confess, causes some Thought∣fulness;
because I have no Acquaintance in <HI>Paris,</HI>
that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re trust with it, nor any-body but my
<PB N="121" REF="126"/>
Woman, to leave in the House, and how to do
without her upon the Road, I do not well know.</P>
<P>As to the Road, be not concern'd, <HI>says the Prinoc,</HI>
I'll provide you Servants to your Mind; and as
for your Woman, if you can trust her, leave her
here, and I'll put you in a Way how to secure
things, as well as if you were at Home: I bow'd,
and told him, I cou'd not be put into better hands
than his own, and that therefore, I wou'd govern
all my Measures by his Directions; so we talk'd
no more of it that Night.</P>
<P>The next Day he sent me in a great Iron Chest,
so large, that it was as much as six lusty Fel∣lows
could get up the Steps, into the House; and
in this I put, indeed, all my Wealth; and for my
Safety, he order'd a good honest ancient Man
and his Wife, to be in the House with her, to
keep her Company, and a Maid-Servant, and
Boy; so that there was a good Family, and <HI>Amy</HI>
was Madam, the Mistress of the House.</P>
<P>Things being thus secur'd, we set out <HI>Incog▪</HI> as
he call'd it; but we had two Coaches and Six
Horses; two Chaises; and about eight Men-Ser∣vants
on Horseback, all very well Arm'd.</P>
<P>Never was Woman better us'd in this World,
that went upon no other Account than I did; I
had three Women-Servants to wait on me, one
whereof was an old Madam—, who thorow∣ly
understood her Business, and manag'd every
thing, as if she had been <HI>Major Domo;</HI> so I had
no Trouble; they had one Coach to themselves,
and the Prince and I in the other; only that
sometimes, where he knew it necessary, I went
into their Coach; and one particular Gentleman
of the Retinue rode with him.</P>
<P>I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay no more of the Journey, than that
when we came to those frightful Mountains, the
<PB N="122" REF="127"/>
<HI>Alps;</HI> there was no travelling in our Coaches, so
he order'd a Horse-Litter, but carried by Mules,
to be provided for me, and himself went on
Horseback; the Coaches went some other Way
back to <HI>Lyons;</HI> then we had Coaches hir'd at <HI>Turin,</HI>
which met us at <HI>Susa;</HI> so that we were accommo∣dated
again, and went by easie Journeys afterwards,
to <HI>Rome,</HI> where his Business, <HI>whatever it was,</HI> call'd
him to stay some time; and from thence to <HI>Ve∣nice.</HI></P>
<P>He was as good as his Word, indeed; for I
had the Pleasure of his Company, and in a word,
engross'd his Conversation almost all the Way:
He took Delight in showing me every thing that
was to be seen, and particularly, in telling me
something of the History of every thing he show d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
me.</P>
<P>What valuable Pains were here thrown away up∣One,
who he was sure, at last, to abandon w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th
Regret! How below himself, did a Man of Qua∣lity,
and of a thousand Accomplishments, behave
in all this! Tis one of my Reasons for entring in∣to
this Part, which otherwise wou'd not be worth
relating: Had I been a Daughter, or a Wife, of
whom it might be said, that he had a just Con∣cern
in their Instruction, or Improvement, it had
been an admirable Step; but all this to a Whore!
to one who he carried with him upon no Account,
that could be rationally agreeable; and none but
to gratifie the meanest of humane Frailties: This
was the Wonder of it.</P>
<P>But such is the Power of a vicious Inclination;
Whoring was, in a Word, his Darling Crime; the
worst Excursion he made; for he was otherwise,
one of the most excellent Persons in the World;
no Passions; no furious Excursions; no oftentati∣ous
Pride; the most humble, courteous, affable
<PB N="123" REF="128"/>
Person in the World; not an Oath; not an inde∣cent
Word, or the least Blemish in Behaviour,
was to be seen in all his Conversation, except as
before excepted; and it has given me Occasion
for many dark Renections since; to look back
and think, that I should be the Snare of such a
Person's I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; that I should influence him to so
much Wickedness; and that I should be the in∣strument
in the Hand of the Devil, to do him so
much Prejudice.</P>
<P>We were near two Year upon this <HI>Grand Tour,</HI>
as it may be call'd, during most or which, I resi∣ded
at <HI>Rome,</HI> or at <HI>Venice,</HI> having only been twice
at <HI>Florence,</HI> and once at <HI>Naples:</HI> I made some very
diverting and useful Observations in all these Places;
and particularly, o the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uct of the Ladies;
for I had Opportunity to converse very much a∣mong
them, by the Help of the old Witch that
travell'd with us; she had been at <HI>Naples,</HI> and at
<HI>Venice,</HI> and had liv'd in the former,
several Years,
where, as I found, she had liv'd but a loose Life,
as indeed, the Women of <HI>Naples</HI> generally do;
and, in short, I found she was fully acquainted
with all the intrieguing Arts of that Part or the
World.</P>
<P>Here my Lord bought me a little Female <HI>Turkish</HI>
Slave, who being Taken at Sea by a <HI>Malthese</HI> Man
of War, was in brought there; and of her I learnt
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language; their Way of Dressing,
and Dancing, and some <HI>Turkish,</HI> or rather <HI>Moorish</HI>
Songs, of which I made U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to my Advantage,
on an extraordinary Occasion, some Years after, as
you shall hear in its Place. I need not say I learnt
<HI>Italian</HI> too, for I got pretty well Mistress of that,
before I had been there a Year; and as I had Lei∣sure
enough, and lov'd the Language, I read all the
<HI>Italian</HI> Books I cou'd come at.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="129"/>
I began to be so in Love with <HI>Italy,</HI> especially with
<HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> that I cou'd have been very
well satisfied to have sent for <HI>Amy,</HI> and have taken
up my Residence there for Life.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Rome,</HI> I did not like it at-all: The Swarms
of Ecclesiasticks of all Kinds, on one side, and
the scoundre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Babbles of the Common People, on
the other, make <HI>Rome</HI> the unpleasantest Place in
the World, to live in; the innumerable Number
of Valets, Lacqueys, and other Servants, is such,
that they us'd to say, that there are very few of
the Common People in <HI>Rome,</HI> but what have been
Footmen, or Porters, or Grooms to Cardinals, or
Foreign Ambassadors: In a Word, they have an
Air of sharping and couzening, quarrelling and
scolding, upon their general Behaviour; and when
I was there, the Footmen made such a Broil be∣tween
two Great Families in <HI>Rome,</HI> about which
of their Coaches (the Ladies being in the Coaches
on either side,) shou'd give Way to t'other; that
there was above thirty People wounded on both
Sides; five or six kill'd outright; and both the
Ladies frighted almost to Death.</P>
<P>But I have no-Mind to write the History of my
Travels on this side of the World, at least, not
Now; it would be too full of Variety.</P>
<P>I must not, however, omit, that the Prince
continued in all this Journey, the most kind, obli∣ging
Person to me, in the World, and so constant,
that tho' we were in a Country, where 'tis well
known all manner of Liberties are taken, I am yet
well assur'd, he neither took the Liberty he knew
he might have, or so much as desir'd it.</P>
<P>I have often thought of this Noble Person, on
that Account; had he been but half so true, to
faithful, and constant to the Best Lady in the
World, I mean his Princess; how glorious a Vir∣tue
<PB N="125" REF="130"/>
had it been in him? and how free had he been
from those just Reflections which touch'd him, in
her behalf, when it was too late.</P>
<P>We had some very agreeable Conversations up∣on
this Subject; and once he told me, with a
kind of more than ordinary Concern upon his
Thoughts, that he was greatly beholden to me for
taking this hazardous and difficult Journey; for
that I had kept him Honest; I look'd up in his
Face, and colour'd as red as Fire: Well, well, <HI>says
he,</HI> do not let that surprize you; I do say, you
have kept me Honest: My Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> 'tis not
for me to explain your Words, but I with I cou'd
turn 'em my own Way; I hope, <HI>says I,</HI> and be∣lieve,
we are both as Honest as we can be, in our
Circumstances; ay, ay, <HI>says he,</HI> and honester than
I doubt I shou'd have been, if you had not been
with me; I cannot say but it you had not been
here, I shou'd have wander'd among the gay
World here, in <HI>Naples,</HI> and in <HI>Venice</HI> too;
for 'tis not such a Crime here, as 'tis in other
Places; but I protest, <HI>says he,</HI> I have not touch'd a
Woman in <HI>Italy,</HI> but yourself; and more than
that, I have not so touch as had any Desire to it;
so that, I say, you have kept me Honest.</P>
<P>I was silent, and was glad that he interrupted
me, or kept me from speaking, with kissing me,
for really I knew not what to say: I was once go∣ing
to say that if his Lady, the Princess, had
been with him, she wou'd, doubtless, have had
the same Influence upon his Virtue, with infinitely
more Advantage to him; but I consider'd this
might give him Offence; and besides, such things
might have been dangerous to the Circumstance
I stood in, so it pass'd off: But I must confess,
I saw that he was quite another Man, as to Wo∣men,
than I understood he had always been be∣fore;
<PB N="126" REF="131"/>
and it was a particular Satisfaction to me,
that I was thereby convinc'd that what he said,
was true, and that he was, as I may say, <HI>all my Own.</HI></P>
<P>I was with-Child again in this Journey, and
Lay-in at <HI>Venice,</HI> but was not so happy as before;
I brought him another Son, and a very fine Boy
it was, but it liv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d not above two Months; nor,
after the first Touches of Affection (which are u∣sual,
I believe, to all Mothers) were over, was I
sorry the Child did not live, the necessary Diffi∣culties
attending it in our travelling, being consi∣der<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</P>
<P>After these several Perambulations, my Lord
told me, his Business began to close, and we wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
think of returning to <HI>France;</HI> which I was very glad
of, but principally on Account of my Treasure
I had there, which, as you have heard, was very
considerable: It is true, I had I e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers very fre∣quently
from my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> with Accounts, that
every thing was very safe, and that was very much
to my Satisfaction: flowever, as the Prince's Ne∣gociations
were at an End, and he was oblig'd to
return, I was very glad to go; so we return'd from
<HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Turin;</HI> and in the Way, I saw the fa∣mous
City of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lan;</HI> from <HI>Turin,</HI> we went over the
Mountains again, as before, and our Coaches met
us at <HI>Pont a v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sia,</HI> between <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amberry</HI> and <HI>Lyons;</HI>
and so, by ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Journeys, we arriv'd safely at
<HI>Paris,</HI> having been absent about two Years, want∣ing
about eleven Days, as above.</P>
<P>I found the little family we left, just as we left
them; and <HI>Amy</HI> cry'd for Joy, when the saw me,
and I almost did the same.</P>
<P>The Prince took his Leave of me the Night be∣fore;
for as he told me, he knew he shou'd
be met upon the Road by several Persons of Qua∣lity,
and perhaps, by the Princess herself;so we
<PB N="127" REF="132"/>
lay at two different Inns that Night, lest some
shou'd come quite to the Place, as indeed, it hap∣pen'd.</P>
<P>After this, I saw him not, for above twenty
Days, being taken-up in his Family, and also with
Business; but he sent me his Gentleman, to tell
me the Reason of it; and bid me not be uneasie;
and that satisfied me effectually.</P>
<P>In all this Affluence of my good Fortune, I did
not forget that I had been Rich and Poor once al∣ready,
alternately; and that I ought to know,
that the Circumstances I was now in, were not to
be expected to last always; that I had one Child,
and expected another; and if I bred often, it
wou'd something impair me in the Great Article
that supported my Interest, I mean, what he call'd
Beauty; that as that declin'd, I might expect the
Fire won'd abate, and the Warmth with which
I was now so carress'd, wou'd cool, and in time,
like the other Mistresses of Great Men, I might
be dropt again; and that, therefore, it was my
Business to take Care that I shou'd fall as softly as
I cou'd.</P>
<P>I say, I did not forget, therefore, to make as
good Provision for myself, as if I had had nothing
to have subsisted on, but what I now gain'd:
whereas I had not less than ten Thousand Pounds,
as I said above, which I had amass'd, or secur'd,
rather out of the Ruins of my faithful Friend,
the Jeweller; and which, he little thinking of what
was so near him when he went out, told me, tho'
in a kind of a Jest, was all my own, if he was
knock'd o'th' Head; and which, upon that Title,
I took Care to preserve.</P>
<P>My greatest Difficulty now, was, how to secure
my Wealth, and to keep what I had got; for I
had greatly added to this Wealth, by the gene∣rous
<PB N="128" REF="133"/>
Bounty of the Prince—, and the more,
by the private retired Manner of Living, which he
rather desir'd for Privacy, than Parsimony; for
he supply'd me for a more magnificent Way of
Life than I desir'd, if it had been proper.</P>
<P>I shall cut short the History of this prosperous
Wickedness, with telling you I brought him a
third Son, within little more than eleven Months
after our Return from <HI>Italy;</HI> that now I liv'd a
little more openly, and went by a particular Name
which he gave me Abroad; but which I must o∣mit
<HI>viz.</HI> the Countess <HI>de</HI>—, and had Coaches,
and Servants, suitable to the Quality he had gi∣ven
me the Appearance of; and which is more
than usually happens in such Cases, this held
eight Years from the Beginning; during which
Time, as I had been very faithful to him, so, I
must say, as above, that I believe he was so sepa∣rated
to me, that whereas he usually had two or
three Women, which he kept privately, he had
not in all that Time meddled with any of them,
but that I had so perfectly engross'd him, that he
dropt them all; not, perhaps, that he sav'd much
by it, for I was a very chargable Mistress to him,
that I must acknowlege; but it was all owing to
his particular Affection to me, not to my Extra∣vagance;
for, as I said, he never gave me leave
to ask him for any thing, but pour'd in his
Favours and Presents faster than I expected, and
so fast, as I could not have the Assurance to make
the least Mention of desiring more.</P>
<P>Nor do I speak this of my own Guess, I mean,
about his Constancy to me, and his quirting all
other Women; but the old <HI>Harradan,</HI> as I may
call her, who he made the Guide of our Travel∣ling,
and who was a strange old Creature, told me
a Thousand Stories of his Gallantry, as she call'd
<PB N="129" REF="134"/>
it, and how, as he had no less than three Mistresses
at one time, and, as I found, all of her procuring,
he had of a sudden, dropt them all, and that he
was entirely lost to both her and them;that they
did believe he had fallen into some new Hands,
but she could never hear who, or where, till he
sent for her to go this Journey; and then the old
Hag complimented me upon his Choice, That she
did not wonder I had so engross'd him;so much
Beauty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there she stopt.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I found by her, what was, you
may be sure, to my particular Satisfaction, <HI>viz.</HI>
that, as above, I had him all my own.</P>
<P>but the highest Tide has its Ebb; and in all
things of this Kind, there is a Reflux which
sometimes also is more impetuously violent than
the first Aggression: My Prince was a Man of a
vast Fortune, tho' no Sovereign, and therefore
there was no Probability that the Expence of
keeping a Mistress could be injurious to him, as
to his Estate; he had also several Employments,
both out of <HI>France,</HI> as well as in it;For, as above,
I say, he was not a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> tho' he liv'd
in that Court: He had a Princess, a Wife, with
whom ho had liv'd several Years, and a Woman
(<HI>so the Voice of Fame reported</HI>) the most valuable
of her Sex; of Birth equal to him, if not supe∣riour,
and of Fortune proportionable; but in
Beauty, Wit, and a thousand good Qualities, su∣periour
not to most Women, but even to all her
Sex;and as to her Virtue, the Character, which
was most justly her due, was that of, not only the
best of Princesses, but even the best of Women.</P>
<P>They liv'd in the utmost Harmony, as with
such a Princess it was impossible to be otherwise;
but yet the Princess was not insensible that her
Lord had his <HI>Foibless;</HI> that he did make some Ex∣cursions;
<PB N="130" REF="135"/>
and particularly, that he had one Fa∣ourite
Mistress which sometimes engross'd him
more than she (the Princess) cou'd wish, or be
easily satisfied with: However, she was so good,
so generous, so truly kind a Wife, that she never
gave him any Uneasiness on this Account; except
so much as must arise from his Sence of her
bearing the Affront of it with such Patience, and
such a profound Respect for him, as was in itself
enough to have reform'd him, and did sometimes
shock his generous Mind, so as to keep him at
Home, as I may call it, a great-while together;
and it was not long before I not only perceiv'd it
by his Absence, but really got a Knowledge of
the Reason of it, and once or twice he even ac∣knowledged
it to me.</P>
<P>It was a Point that lay not in me to manage;
I made a kind of Motion, once or twice, to him,
to leave me, and keep himself to her, as he ought
by the Laws and Rites of Matrimony to do, and
argued the Generosity of the Princess to him, to
perswade him;but I was a Hypocrite;for had I
preva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d with him really to be honest, I had lost
him, which I could not bear the Thoughts of;
and he might easily see I was not in earnest;
one time in particular, when I took upon me to
talk at this rate, I found when I argued so much
for the Virtue and Honour, the Birth, and above
all, the generous Usage he found in the Person of
the Princess, with respect to his private Amours,
and how it should prevail upon him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I found
it began to affect him, and he return'd, <HI>And do
you indeed,</HI> says he, <HI>perswade me to leave you? Would
you have me think you sincere?</HI> I look'd up in his
Face, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng, <HI>Not for any other Favourite,</HI> my
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, said I; <HI>that wou'd break my Heart;</HI> but <HI>for
Mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n the Princess!</HI> said I, and then I could say no
<PB N="131" REF="136"/>
more, Tears follow'd, and I sat silent a-while: Well,
<HI>said he,</HI> if ever I do leave you, it shall be on the
Virtuous Account; it shall be for the Princess, I
assure you it shall be for no other Woman; <HI>That's
enough, my Lord,</HI> said I, <HI>There I ought to submit; and
while I am assur'd it shall be for no other Mistress, I
promise Your Highness, I will not repine;</HI> or that, if
I do, <HI>it shall be a silent Gries, it shall not interrupt
your Felicity.</HI></P>
<P>All this white I said I knew not what, and said
what I was no more able to do, than he was a∣ble
to leave me; which, at that time, He own'd
he cou'd not do, no, not for the Princess herself.</P>
<P>But another Turn of Affairs determin'd this
Matter;for the Princess was taken very ill, and
in the Opinion of all her Physicians, very dange∣rously
so;in her Sickness she desir'd to speak with
her Lord, and to take her Leave of him: At this
grievous Parting, she said so many passionate kind
Things to him;lamented that she had left him
no Children;she had had three, but they were
dead; hinted to him, that it was one of the
chief things which gave her Satisfaction in Death,
us to this World; that she should leave him room
to have Heirs to his Family, by some Princess
that should supply her Place; with all Humility,
but with n Christian Earnestness recommended
to him to do Justice to such Princess, whoever
it should be, from whom, <HI>to be sure,</HI> he would ex∣pect
Justice; that is to say, to keep to her singly,
according to the solemnest Part of the Marriage
Covenant; humbly ask'd his Highness Pardon, if
she had any way offended him; and appealing to
Heaven, before whose Tribunal she was to ap∣ppear,
that she had never violated her Honour,
or her Duty to him; and praying to Jesus, and
the Blessed Virgin, for his Highness;and thus with
<PB N="132" REF="137"/>
the most moving, and most passionate Expressi∣ons
of her Affection to him, took her last Leave
of him, and died the next Day.</P>
<P>This Discourse from a Princess so valuable in her∣self,
and so dear to him, and the Loss of her fol∣lowing
so immediately after, made such deep Im∣pressions
on him, that he look'd back with De∣testation
upon the former Part of his Life; grew
melancholly and reserv'd; chang'd his Society,
and much of the general Conduct of his Life;
resolv'd on a Life regulated most strictly by the
Rules of Virtue, and Piety;and in a word, was
quite another Man.</P>
<P>The first Part of his Reformation, was a Storm
upon me;for, about ten Days after the Princess's
Funeral, he sent a Message to me by his Gentle∣man,
intimating, tho' in very civil Terms, and
with a short Preamble, or Introduction, that he
desir'd I wou'd not take it ill that he was oblig'd
to let me know, that <HI>he could see me no more:</HI> His
Gentleman told me a long Story of the new Re∣gulation
of Life his Lord had taken up, and that
he had been so afflicted for the Loss or his Prin∣cess,
that he thought it would either shorten his
Life, or he wou'd retire into some Religious
House, to end his Days in Solitude.</P>
<P>I need not direct any-body to suppose how I
receiv'd this News; I was indeed, exceedingly
surpriz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d at it, and had much a-do to support my∣self,
when the first Part of it was deliver'd;tho'
the Gentleman deliver'd his Errand with great
Respect, and with all the Regard to me, that
he was able, and with a great deal of Ceremony;
also telling me how much he was concerned to
bring me such a Messsge.</P>
<P>But when I heard the Particulars of the Story
at large, and especially, that of the Lady's Dis∣course
<PB N="133" REF="138"/>
to the Prince, a little before her Death, I
was fully satisfied;I knew very well He had
done nothing but what any Man must do, that
had a true Sence upon him of the Justice of
the Princess's Discourse to him, and of the Ne∣cessity
there was of his altering his Course of
Life, if he intended to be either a Christian, or
an honest Man: I say, when I heard this, I was
perfectly easie;I confess it was a Circumstance
that it might be reasonably expected shou'd have
wrought something also upon me: I that had so
much to reflect upon more, than the Prince;that
had now no more Temptation of Poverty, or of
the powerful Motive, which <HI>Amy</HI> us'd with me,
namely, <HI>Comply and live; deny and starve;</HI> I say, I
that had no Poverty to introduce Vice, but was
grown not only well supply'd, but Rich, and not
only Rich, but was very Rich; in a word, richer
than I knew how to think of; for the Truth of
it was, that thinking of it sometimes, almost di∣stracted me, for want of knowing how to dis∣pose
of it, and for fear of losing it all again by
some Cheat or Trick, not knowing any-body that
I could commit the Trust of it to.</P>
<P>Besides I should add at the Close of this Affair,
that the Prince did not, as I may say, turn me off
rudely, and with Disgust;but with all the Decen∣cy
and Goodness peculiar to himself, and that
could consist with a Man reform'd, and struck
with the Sence of his having abus'd so good a
Lady as his late Princess had been; nor did he
send me away empty, but did every thing like
himself;and in particular, order'd his Gentleman
to pay the Rent of the House, and all the Ex∣pence
of his two Sons; and to tell me how they
were taken Care of, and where; and also, that
I might, at all times, inspect the Usage they
<PB N="134" REF="139"/>
had, and if I dislik'd anything, it should be recti∣fied;
and Having thus finish'd every thing, he re∣tir'd
into <HI>Lorrain,</HI> or somewhere that Way, where
he had an Estate, and I never heard of him more,
I mean, not as a Mistress.</P>
<P>Now I was at Liberty to go to any Part of
the World, and take Care of my Money myself:
The first thing that I resolv'd to do, was to go
directly to <HI>England,</HI> for there, I thought, being a∣mong
my Countryfolks, (for I esteem'd myself an
<HI>English-Woman,</HI> tho' I was born in <HI>France,</HI>) but
there, I say, I thought I cou'd better manage things,
than in <HI>France,</HI> at least, that I would be in less
Danger of being circumvented and deceiv'd; but
how to get away with such a Treasure as I had
with me, was a difficult Point, and what I was
greatly at a Loss about.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant in <HI>Paris,</HI> that
was a Person of great Reputation for a Man of
Substance, and of Honesty, but I had no man∣ner
of Acquaintance with him, nor did I know
how to get acquainted with him, so as to disco∣ver
my Circumstances to him; but at last I em∣ploy'd
my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> such I must be allow'd to
call her, (notwithstanding what has been said of
her) because she was in the Place of a Maid-Ser∣vant;
I say, I employ'd my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> to go to
him, and she got a Recommendation to him from
somebody else, I knew not who;so that she got
Access to him well enough.</P>
<P>But now was my Case as bad as before; for
when I came to him, what cou'd I do? I had
Money and Jewels, to a vast Value, and I might
leave all those with him; that I might indeed, do;
and so I might with several other Merchants in
<HI>Paris,</HI> who wou'd give me Bills for it, payable at
<HI>London,</HI> but then I ran a Hazard of my Money;
<PB N="135" REF="140"/>
and I had no-body at <HI>London</HI> to send the Bills to,
and so to stay till I had an Account that they
were accepted; for I had not one Friend in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
that I cou'd have recourse to, so that, indeed,
I knew not what to do.</P>
<P>In this Case I had no Remedy, but that I must
trust somebody; so sent <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>this Dutch</HI> Mer∣chant,
as I said above; he was a little surpriz'd
when <HI>Amy</HI> came to him, and talk'd to him of re∣mitting
a Sum of about 12000 Pistoles to <HI>England,</HI>
and began to think she came to put some Cheat:
upon him; but when he found that <HI>Amy</HI> was but
a Servant, and that I came to him myself, the
Case was alter'd presently.</P>
<P>When I came to him myself, I presently saw
such a plainness in his Dealing, and such Honesty
in his Countenance, that I made no Scruple to tell
him my whole Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That I was a Widow;
that I had some Jewels to dispose of, and also
some Money, which I had a-mind to send to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and to follow there myself; but being but a
Woman, and having no Correspondence in <HI>London,</HI>
or any-where else, I knew not what to do, or how
to secure my Effects.</P>
<P>He dealt very candidly with me, but advis'd
me, when he knew my Case so particularly, to
take Bills upon <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and to go that Way
to <HI>England;</HI> for that I might lodge my Treasure
in the Bank there, in the most secure Manner in
the World; and that there he cou'd recommend
me to a Man who perfectly understood Jewels, and
would deal faithfully with me in the disposing
than.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, but scrupled very much the
travelling so far in a strange Country, and especi∣ally
with such a Treasure about me; that whether
known, or conceal'd, I did not know how to ven∣ture
<PB N="136" REF="141"/>
with it: Then he told me, me wou'd try to
dispose of them there, that is, at <HI>Paris,</HI> and con∣vert
them into Money, and so get me Bills for the
whole; and in a few Days he brought a <HI>Jew</HI> to
me, who pretended to buy the Jewels.</P>
<P>As soon as the <HI>Jew</HI> saw the Jewels, I saw my
Folly; and it was ten Thousand to one but I had
been ruin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and perhaps, put to Death in as cruel
a Manner as possible; and I was put in such a
Fright by it, that I was once upon the Point of
flying for my Life, and leaving the Jewels and
Money too, in the Hands of the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> with∣out
any Bills, or any thing else;the Case was
thus:</P>
<P>As soon as the <HI>Jew</HI> saw the Jewels, he falls
a jabbering in <HI>Dutch,</HI> or <HI>Partuguese,</HI> to the Mer∣chant,
and I cou'd presently perceive that they
were in some great Surprize, both of them; the
<HI>Jew</HI> held up his Hands, look'd at me with some
Horrour, then talk'd <HI>Dutch</HI> again, and put him∣self
into a thousand Shapes, twisting his Body,
and wringing up his Face this Way, and that
Way, in his Discourse; stamping with his Feet,
and throwing abroad his Hands, as if he was not
an a Rage only, but in a meer Fury; then he
wou'd turn, and give a Look at me, like the Devil;
I thought I never saw any thing so frightful in
my Life.</P>
<P>At length I put in a Word; Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> to the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, What is all this Discourse to my
Business? What is this Gentleman in all these
Passions about? I wish, if he is to treat with me, he
Wou'd speak, that I may understand him; or if
you have Business of your own between you, that
is to be done first, let me withdraw, and I'll come
again when you are at leisure.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="142"/>
No, no, Madam, <HI>says the Dutchman,</HI> very kindly,
you must not go, all our Discourse is about you,
and your Jewels, and you shall hear it presently,
it concerns you very much, I assure you: Con∣cern
me, <HI>says I,</HI> what can it concern me so much, as
to put this Gentleman into such Agonies? and
what makes him give me such Devil's Looks as he
does? why he looks as if he wou'd devour me.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jew</HI> understood me presently, continuing in
a kind of Rage, and spoke in <HI>French,</HI> Yes, Madam,
it doesr, concern you much, very much, very much,
repeating the Words, shaking his Head, and
then turning to the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> pray
tell her what is the Case; no, <HI>says the Merchant,</HI>
not yet, let us talk a little farther of it by our∣selves;
upon which, they withdrew into another
Room, where still they talk'd very high, but in
a Language I did not understand: I began to be
a little supriz'd at what the <HI>Jew</HI> had said, you
may be sure, and eager to know what he meant,
and was very impatient till the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant
came back, and that so impatient, that I call'd one
of his Servants to let him know, I desir'd to speak
with him; when he came in, I ask'd his Pardon
for being so impatient, but told him, I cou'd not
be easie, till he had told me what the Meaning
of all this was: Why Madam, <HI>says the Dutch Mer∣chant,</HI>
in short, the Meaning is, what I am sur∣priz'd
at too: This Man is a <HI>Jew,</HI> and under∣stands
Jewels perfectly well, and that was the Rea∣son
I sent for him, to dispose of them to him, for
you; but as soon as he saw them, he knew the
Jewels very distinctly, and flying out in a Passion,
as you see he did; told me, in short, that they
were the very Parcel of Jewels which the <HI>English</HI>
Jeweller had about him, who was robb'd going to
<HI>Versailies,</HI> (about eight Years ago) to show them
<PB N="138" REF="143"/>
the Prince <HI>d'</HI>—, and that it was for these ve∣ry
Jewels that the poor Gentleman was murther'd;
and he is in all this Agony to make me ask you,
how you came by them; and he says, you ought
to be charg'd with the Robbery and Murther,
and put to the Question, to discover who were the
Persons that did it, that they might be brought to
Justice: While he said this, the <HI>Jew</HI> came impu∣dently
back, into the Room, without calling,
which a little surpriz'd me again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant spoke pretty good <HI>English,</HI>
and he knew that the <HI>Jew</HI> did not understand <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
at-all; so he told me the latter Part, when the
<HI>Jew</HI> came into the Room, in <HI>English;</HI> at which I
smil'd, which put the <HI>Jew</HI> into his mad Fit again,
and shaking his Head, and making his Devil's Fa∣ces
again, he seem'd to threaten me for Laugh∣ing;
saying in <HI>French,</HI> This was an Affair I shou'd
have little Reason to laugh at, and the like; at
this, I laugh'd again, and flouted him, letting him
see, that I scorn'd him; and turning to the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Merchant, <HI>Sir</HI> says I, <HI>That those Jewels were be∣longing
to Mr.—, the</HI> English <HI>Jeweller,</HI> name∣ing
his Name readily, <HI>in that,</HI> says I, <HI>this Person is
right, but that I shou'd be question'd</HI> how I came to
have them, <HI>is a Token of his Ignorance; which,</HI> how∣ever,
<HI>he might have manag'd with a little mare good
Manners, till I had told him who I am; and both
he, and you too? will be more easie in that Part, when
I should tell you, that I am the unhappy Widow of
that Mr.—, who was so barbarously murther'd
going to</HI> Versailles; <HI>and that he was not robb'd of
those Jewels, but of others; Mr.—having
left those behind him, with me, lest he should be robb'd;
had I,</HI> Sir, <HI>come otherwise by them, I should not have
been weak enough to have expos'd them to Sale here,
where the Thing was done, but have carried them far∣ther
off.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="144"/>
This was an agreeable Surprize to the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Merchant, who being an honest Man himself,
believ'd every thing I said, which indeed, be∣ing
all really and literally true, except the De∣ficiency
of my Marriage, I spoke with such an
unconcern'd Easiness, that it might plainly be
seen, that I had no Guilt upon me, as the <HI>Jew</HI>
suggested.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jew</HI> was confounded when he heard that I
was the <HI>Jeweller's Wife;</HI> but as I had rais'd his Pas∣sion,
with saying, he look'd at me with a De∣vil's
Face, he studied Mischief in his Heart, and
answer'd, <HI>That should not serve my Turn;</HI> so call'd
the <HI>Dutchman</HI> out again, when he told him, that
he resolv'd to prosecute this Matter farther.</P>
<P>There was one kind Chance in this Affair,
which indeed, was my Deliverance, and that was,
that the Fool cou'd not restrain his Passion, but
must let it fly to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant; to whom,
when they withdrew a second time, as above, he
told, that he would bring a Process against me for
the Murther; and that it should cost me dear,
for using him at that rate; and <HI>away he went,</HI> de∣siring
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant to tell him when I wou'd
be there again: Had he suspected, that the <HI>Dutch∣man</HI>
wou'd have communicated the Particulars to
me, he wou'd never have been so foolish as to
have mention'd that Part to him.</P>
<P>But the Malice of his Thoughts anticipated
him, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant was so good, as to
give me an Account of his Design, which indeed,
was wicked enough in its Nature; but to me it
would have been worse, than otherwise it wou'd
to another; for upon Examination, I cou'd not
have prov'd myself to be the Wife of the Jeweller,
so the Suspicion might have been carried on with
the better Face; and then I shou'd also, have
<PB N="140" REF="145"/>
brought all his Relations in <HI>England</HI> upon me;
who finding by the Proceedings, that I was not
his Wife, but a Mistress, or in <HI>English, a Whore,</HI>
wou'd immediately have laid Claim to the Jew∣els,
as I had own'd them to be his.</P>
<P>This Thought immediately rush'd into my
Head, as soon as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant had told
me, what wicked things were in the Head of that
cursed <HI>Jew;</HI> and the Villain (<HI>for so I must call him</HI>)
convinc'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant that he was in ear∣nest,
by an Expression which shew'd the rest of
his Design, and that was a Plot to get the rest of
the Jewels into his Hand.</P>
<P>When first he hinted to the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> that the
Jewels, were such a Man's, meaning my Husband's,
he made wonderful Explanations on account of
their having been conceal'd so long; where must
they have lain? and what was the Woman that
brought them? and that she, meaning me, ought
to he immediately apprehended, and put into the
Hands of Justice; and this was the time that, as
I said, he made such horrid Gestures, and look'd
at me so like a Devil.</P>
<P>The Merchant hearing him talk at that rate,
and seeing him in earnest, said to him, Hold your
Tongue a little, this is a thing of Consequence;
if it be so, let you and I go into the next Room
and consider of it there; and so they withdrew,
and lest me.</P>
<P>Here, as before, I was uneasie, and call'd him
our, and having heard how it was, gave him than
Answer, <HI>that I was his Wife,</HI> or Widow, which
the malicious <HI>Jew</HI> said <HI>shou'd not serve my turn;</HI> and
then it was, that the <HI>Dutchman</HI> call'd him out a∣gain;
and in this time of his withdrawing, the
Merchant finding, as above, that he was really in
earnest, counter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cited a little to be of his Mind,
<PB N="141" REF="146"/>
and enter'd into Proposals with him for the thing
itself.</P>
<P>In this they agreed to go to an Advocate, or
Council, for Directions how to proceed, and to
meet again the next Day, against which time
the Merchant was to appoint me to come again
with the Jewels, in order to sell them: <HI>No,</HI> says
the Merchant, <HI>I will go farther with her than so; I
will desire her to leave the Jewels with me, to show to a∣nother
Person, in order to get the better Price for them:
That's right, says the Jew, and I'll engage she shall
Never be Mistress of them again; they shall either be
seiz'd by us, says he, in the King's Name, or she shall
be glad to give them up to us, to prevent her being put
to the Torture.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant said Yes to every thing he
offer'd, and they agreed to meet the next mor∣ning
about it, and I was to be perswaded to
leave the Jewels with him, and come to them
the next Day, at four a-Clock, in order to make
a good Bargain for them; and on these Con∣ditions
they parted; but the honest <HI>Dutchman,</HI>
fill'd with Indignation at the barbarous Design,
came directly to me, and told me the whole
Story; <HI>and now,</HI> Madam, says he, <HI>you are to consi∣der
immediately what you have to do.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, if I was sure to have Justice, I
would not fear all that such a Rogue cou'd do
to me; but how such things were carried on
in <HI>France</HI> I knew not, I told him, the greatest
Difficulty would be to prove our Marriage, for
that it was done in <HI>England,</HI> and in a remote
Part of <HI>England</HI> too, and which was worse, it
would be hard to produce authentick Vouchers
of it, because we were Married in Private: <HI>But
as to the Death of your Husband,</HI> Madam, <HI>what
can be said to that?</HI> said he; <HI>nay,</HI> said I, <HI>what can
<PB N="142" REF="147"/>
they say to it?</HI> In <HI>England,</HI> added I, if they wou'd
offer such an Injury to any one, they must prove
the Fact, or give just Reason for their Suspici∣ons;
that my Husband was Murther'd, that
every one knows; but that he was robb'd, or of
what, or how much, that none knows, no, not
myself; and why was I not question'd for it
then? I have liv'd in <HI>Paris</HI> ever since, liv'd pub∣lickly
and no Man had yet the Impudence to sug∣gest,
such a thing of me.</P>
<P>I am fully satisfied of that, <HI>says the Merchant;</HI>
but as this is a Rogue, who will stick at nothing,
what can we say? and who knows what he may
swear? suppose he should swear, that he knows
your Husband had those particular Jewels with
him the Morning when the went out, and that he
shew'd them to him, to consider their Value, and
what Price he should ask the Prince <HI>de</HI>—for
them.</P>
<P>Nay, by the same Rule, <HI>said I,</HI> he may swear,
that I murther'd my Husband, if he finds it
for his Turn: That's true, <HI>said he;</HI> and if he
shou'd, I do not see what cou'd save you; but I
added, I have found out his more immediate De∣sign;
his Design is to have you carried to the
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that the Suspicion may appear just;
and then to get the Jewels out of your Hands,
if possible; then, at last, to drop the Prose∣cution,
on your contening to quit the Jewels to
him; and how you will do to avoid this, is the
Question, which I would have you consider of.</P>
<P>My Misfortune, or, <HI>said I,</HI> is, that I have no
Time to consider, and I have no Person to con∣sider
with, or advise about it; I find, that In∣nocence
may be oppress'd by such an impudent
Fellow as this; he that does not value a Perjury,
has any Man's Life at his Mercy; but Sir, <HI>said I,</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="148"/>
is the Justice such here, that while I may be in
the Hands of the Publick, and under Prosecution,
he may get hold of my Effects, and get my Jew∣els
into his Hands?</P>
<P>I don't know, <HI>say he,</HI> what may be done in that
Case; but if not he, if the Court of Justice shou'd
get hold of them, I do not know but you may find
it as difficult to get them out of their Hands a∣gain,
and, at least, it may cost you half as much as
they are worth; so I think it would be a much
better Way, to prevent their coming at them
at-all.</P>
<P>But what Course can I take to do that, <HI>says I,</HI>
now they have got Notice, that I have them? If
they get me into their Hands, they will oblige me
to produce them, or perhaps, sentence me to Pri∣son
till I do.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says he,</HI> as this Brute says too, put you
to the Question? that is, to the Torture, on Pre∣tence
of making you confess who were the Mur∣therers
of your Husband.</P>
<P>Confess! <HI>said I;</HI> how can I confess what I know
nothing of?</P>
<P>If they come to have you to the Rack, <HI>said he,</HI>
they will make you confess you did it yourself,
whether you did it or no, and then you are cast.</P>
<P>The very word Rack frighted me to Death al∣most,
and I had no Spirit left in me: Did it my∣self!
<HI>said I;</HI> that's impossible!</P>
<P>No, Madam, says he, 'tis far from impossible;
the most innocent People in the World have
been forc'd to cenfess themselves Guilty of what
they never heard of, much less, had any Hand in.</P>
<P>What then must I do? <HI>said I;</HI> what wou'd you
advise me to?</P>
<P>Why, <HI>says he,</HI> I wou'd advise you to be gone;
you intended to go away in four or five Days,
<PB N="144" REF="149"/>
and you may as well go in two Days; and if
you can do so, I shall manage it so, that he shall
not suspect your being gone, for several Days af∣ter:
Then he told me, how the Rogue wou'd have
me order'd to bring the Jewels the next Day, for
Sale; and that then he wou'd have me appre∣hended;
how he had made the <HI>Jew</HI> believe he
wou'd join with him in his Design; and that he
[the Merchant] wou'd get the Jewels into his
Hands: Now, <HI>says the Merchant,</HI> I shall give you
Bills for the Money you desir'd, immediately, and
such as shall not fail of being paid; take your
Jewels with you, and go this very Evening to
<HI>St. Germains en Lay;</HI> I'll send a Man thither with
you, and from thence, he shall guide you to-Mor∣row,
to <HI>Roan,</HI> where there lies a Ship of mine,
just ready to sail for <HI>Rotterdam;</HI> you shall have
your Passage in that Ship, on my Account, and I
will send Orders for him to sail as soon as you
are on Board, and a Letter to my Friend at <HI>Rotter∣dam,</HI>
to Entertain and take Care of you.</P>
<P>This was too kind an Offer for me, as things
stood, not to be accepted, and be thankful for;
and as to going away, I had prepar'd every thing
for parting; so that I had little to do, but to go
back, take two or three Boxes and Bundles, and
such things, and my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and be gone.</P>
<P>Then the Merchant told me the Measures he
had resolv'd to take to delude the <HI>Jew,</HI> while I
made my Escape, which were very well contriv'd
indeed: FIRST, <HI>said he,</HI> when he comes to-Mor∣row,
I shall tell him, that I propos'd to you, to
leave the Jewels with me, as we agreed; but that
you said, you wou'd come and bring them in the
Afrernoon, so that we must stay for you till four
a-Clock; but then, at that time, I will show a
Letter from you, as if just come in, wherein you
<PB N="145" REF="150"/>
shall excuse your not coming; for that some Com∣pany
came to visit you, and prevented you; but
that you desire me to take Care that the Gentle∣man
be ready to buy your Jewels; and that you
will come to Morrow, at the same Hour, without
fail.</P>
<P>When to-Morrow is come, we shall wait at
the Time, but you not appearing, I shall seem
most dissatisfied, and wonder what can be the
Reason; and so we shall agree to go the next
Day to get out a Process against you; but the
next Day, in the Morning, I'll send to give him
Notice, that you have been at my House, but he
not being there, have made another Appointment,
and that I desire to speak with him; when he
comes, I'll tell him, you appear perfectly blind,
as to your Danger; and that you appear'd much
disappointed that he did not come, tho' you cou'd
not meet the Night before; and oblig'd me to
have him here to-Morrow at three a-Clock; <HI>when
to-Morrow comes, says he, you shall send word, that
you are taken so ill, that you cannot come out for that
Day; but that you will not fail the next Day; and
the next Day you shall neither come or send, nor let us
ever hear any more of you; for by that time you shall be
in Holland, if you please.</HI></P>
<P>I cou'd not but approve all his Measures, seeing
they were so well contriv'd, and in so friendly a
Manner, for my Benefit; and as he seem'd to be
so very sincere, I resolv'd to put my Life in his
Hands: Immediately I went to my Lodgings, and
sent away <HI>Amy</HI> with such Bundles as I had pre∣par'd
for my Travelling; I also sent several Par∣cels
of my fine Furniture to the Merchant's house,
to be said up for me, and bringing the Key of the
Lodgings with me, I came back to his House:
Here we finish'd our Matters of Money; and I de∣liver'd
<PB N="146" REF="151"/>
into his Hands seven Thousand eight Hun∣dred
Pistoles in Bills and Money; a Copy of an
Assignment on the Town-House of <HI>Paris,</HI> for 4000
Pistoles, at 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Interest, attested; and a
Procuration for receiving the Interest halt-yearly;
but the Original I kept myself.</P>
<P>I cou'd have trusted all I had with him, for he
was perfectly honest, and had not the least View of
doing me any Wrong; indeed, after it was so ap∣parent
that he had, as it were, sav'd my Life, or
at least, sav'd me from being expos'd and ruin'd;
I say, after this, how cou'd I doubt him in any
thing?</P>
<P>When I came to him, he had every-thing rea∣dy
as I wanted, and as he had propos'd as to my
Money, he gave me first of all an accepted Bill,
payable at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> for 4000 Pistoles, and
drawn from <HI>Genoa</HI> upon a Merchant at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI>
payable to a Merchant at <HI>Paris,</HI> and endors'd by
him to my Merchant; this-he assur'd me wou'd be
punctually paid, and so it was, to a Day; the rest
I had in other Bills of Exchange, drawn by him∣self
upon other Merchants in <HI>Holland:</HI> Having se∣cur'd
my Jewels too, as well as I cou'd, he sent
me away the same Evening in a Friend's Coach,
which he had procur'd for me, to <HI>St. Germains,</HI>
and the next Morning to <HI>Roan;</HI> he also sent a Ser∣vant
of his own, on Horseback, with me, who
provided every thing for me, and who carried
his Orders to the Captain o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Ship, which
lay about three Miles below <HI>Roan,</HI> in the River, and
by his Directions I went immediately on Board:
The third Day after I was on Board, the Ship
went away, and we were out at Sea the next day
after that; and thus I took my Leave of <HI>France,</HI>
and got clear of an ugly Business, which, had it
gone on, might have ruin'd me, and sent me back
<PB N="147" REF="152"/>
as Naked to <HI>England,</HI> as I was a little before I
left it.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Amy</HI> and I were at Leisure to look up∣on
the Mischiefs that we had escap'd; and had I
had any Religion, or any Sence of a Supreme
Power managing, directing, and governing in both
Causes and Events in this World, such a Case as
this wou'd have given any-body room to have been
very thankful to the Power who had not only put
such a Treasure into my Hand, but given me
such an Escape from the Ruin that threaten'd
me; but I had none of those things about me;
I had indeed, a grateful Sence upon my Mind of
the generous Friendship of my Deliverer, the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant; by whom I was so faithfully
serv'd, and by whom, as far as relates to second
Causes, I was preserv'd from Destruction.</P>
<P>I say, I had a grateful Sence upon my Mind, of
his Kindness and Faithfullness to me, and I resolv'd
to show him some Testimony of it, as soon as I
came to the End of my Rambles, for I was yet
but in a State of Uncertainty, and sometimes
that gave me a little Uneasiness too; I had Paper
indeed, for my Money, and he had shew'd him∣self
very good to me, in conveying me away, as
above: But I had not seen the End of things yet;
for unless the Bills were paid, I might still he a
great Loser by my <HI>Dutchman,</HI> and he might, per∣haps,
have contriv'd all that Affair of the <HI>Jew,</HI> to
put me into a Fright, and get me to run away,
and that, as if it were to save my Life; that if
the Bills should he refus'd, I was cheated, with a
Witness, and the like; but these were but Sur∣mises,
and indeed, were perfectly without Cause;
for the honest Man acted as honest Men always
do; with an upright and disinterested Principle;
and with a Sincerity not often to be found in the
<PB N="148" REF="153"/>
World; what Gain he made by the Exchange,
was just, and was nothing but what was his Due,
and was in the Way of his Business; but other∣wise
he made no Advantage of me at-all.</P>
<P>When I pass'd in the Ship between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Cal∣lais,</HI>
and saw Beloved <HI>England</HI> once more under my
View; <HI>England,</HI> which I counted my Native Coun∣try,
being the Place I was bred up in, tho' not born
there; a strange kind of Joy possess'd my Mind,
and I had such a longing Desire to be there, that
I would have given the Master of the Ship twenty
Pistoles to have stood-over, and set me on shore in
the <HI>Downs;</HI> and when he told me he cou'd not
do it, that is, that he durst not do it, if I wou'd
have given him an hundred Pistoles, I secretly
wish'd, that a Storm wou'd rise, that might drive
the Ship over to the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> whether
they wou'd or not, that I might be set on Shore
any-where upon <HI>English</HI> Ground.</P>
<P>This wicked Wish had not been out of my
Thoughts above two or three Hours, but the Ma∣ster
steering away to the <HI>North,</HI> as was his Course
to do, we lost Sight of Land on that Side, and
only had the <HI>Flemish</HI> Shore in View on our Right-hand,
or, as the Seamen call it, the Starboard-Side;
and then with the Loss of the Sight, the
Wish for Landing in <HI>England,</HI> abated; and I con∣sider'd
how foolish it was to wish myself out of
the Way of my Business; that if I had been on
Shore in <HI>England,</HI> I must go back to <HI>Holland,</HI> on
account of my Bills, which were so considerable,
and I having no Correspondence there, that I cou'd
not have manag'd it, without going myself: But
we had not been out of Sight of <HI>England</HI> many
Hours, before the Weather began to change,
the Wirds whistl'd, and made a Noise, and the
Seamen laid to one-another, that it wou'd Blow∣hard
<PB N="149" REF="154"/>
hard at Night: It was then about two Hours be∣fore
Sun-set, and we were pass'd by <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and
I think they said we were in Sight of <HI>Ostend;</HI> but
then the Wind grew high, and the Sea swell'd,
and all things look'd terrible, especially to us, that
understood nothing but just what we saw before us;
in short, Night came on, and very dark it was,
the Wind freshen'd, and blew harder and harder,
and about two Hours within Night, it blew a ter∣rible
Storm.</P>
<P>I was not quite a Stranger to the Sea, having
come from <HI>Rochelle</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> when I was a Child,
and gone from <HI>London,</HI> by the River <HI>Thames,</HI> to
<HI>France</HI> afterward, as I have said: But I began to
be alarm'd a little with the terrible Clamour of
the Men over my Head, for I had never been in
a Storm, and so had never seen the like, or heard
it; and once, offering to look out at the Door of
the Steerage, as they call'd it, it struck me with
such Horrour, the darkness, the fierceness of the
Wind, the dreadful height of the Waves, and the
Hurry the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sailors were in, whose Language
I did not understand one Word of; neither when
they curs'd, or when they pray'd; I say, all these
things together, fill'd me with Terror; and, in
short, I began to be very much frighted.</P>
<P>When I was come back into the Great-Cabbin,
there sat <HI>Amy,</HI> who was very Sea-sick, and I had
a little before given her a Sup of Cordial-waters, to
help her Stomach: When <HI>Amy</HI> saw me come back,
and sit down without speaking, for so I did, she
look'd two or three times up at me, at last she came
running to me, Dear Madam! <HI>says she,</HI> what is the
Matter? what makes you look so pale? why,
you a'nt well; what is the Matter? I said nothing still
but held up my Hands two or three times;
<HI>Amy</HI> doubl'd her Importunities; upon that, I said
<PB N="150" REF="155"/>
no more, but, <HI>step to the Steerage-Door, and look out
as, I did;</HI> so she went away immediately, and
looked too, as I had bidden her; but the poor Girl
came back again in the greatest Amazement and
Horrour, that ever I saw any poor Creature in,
wringing her Hands, and crying out she was un∣done!
she was undone! she shou'd be drown'd!
they were all lost! Thus she ran about the Cab∣bin
like a mad thing, and as perfectly out of her
Senses, as any one in such a Case cou'd be sup∣pos'd
to be.</P>
<P>I was frighted, myself; but when I saw the Girl
in such a terrible Agony, it brought me a little to
myself, and I began to talk to her, and put her in
a little Hope; I told her, there was many a Ship
in a Storm, that was not cast-away; and I hop'd
we shou'd not be drown'd; that it was true, the
Storm was very dreadful, but I did not see that
the Seamen were so much concern'd as we were;
and so I talk'd to her as well as I cou'd, tho' my
Heart was full enough of it, as well as <HI>Amy</HI>'s, and
Death began to stare in my Face, ay, and some∣thing
else too, that is to say, Conscience, and my
Mind was very much disturb'd, but I had no∣body
to comfort me.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> being in so much worse a Condition,
that is to say, so much more terrify'd at the
Storm, than I was, I had something to do to
comfort her; she was, as I have said, like one
distracted, and went raving about the Cabbin,
crying our, she was undone! undone! she shou'd
be drown'd, <HI>and the like;</HI> and at last, the Ship gi∣ving
a Jerk, by the Force, I suppose, of some vio∣lent
Wave, it threw poor <HI>Amy</HI> quite down, for
she was weak enough before, with being Sea-sick,
and as it threw her forward, the poor Girl st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uck
her Head against the Bulk-head, as the Seamen
<PB N="151" REF="156"/>
call it, of the Cabbin, and said her as dead as a
Stone, upon the Floor, or Deck, that is to say,
she was so to all Appearance.</P>
<P>I cry'd out for Help; but at had been all one,
to have cry'd out on the top of a Mountain,
where no-body had been within five Miles of me;
for the Seamen were so engag'd, and made so much
Noise, that no-body heard me, or came near me;
I open'd the Great-Cabbin Door, and look'd into
the Steerage, to cry for Help, but there, to en∣crease
my Fright, was two Seamen on their Knees,
at Prayers, and only one Man who steer'd, and
he made a groaning Noise too, which I took to be
saying his Prayers, but it seems it was answering to
those above, when they call'd to him, to tell him
which Way to steer.</P>
<P>Here was no Help for me, or for poor <HI>Amy,</HI>
and there she lay still so, and in such a Condition,
that I did not know whether she was dead or a∣live;
in this Fright I went to her, and lifted her
a little way up, setting her on the Deck, with her
Back to the Boards of the Bulk-head, and I got
a little Bottle out of my Pocket, and I held it
to her Nose, and rubb'd her Temples, and what
else I coulld do, but still <HI>Amy</HI> shew'd no Signs of
Life, till I felt for her Pulse, but could hardly distin∣guish
her to be alive; however, after a great while,
she began to revive, and in about half an Hour
she came to herself, but remember'd nothing at
first of what had happen'd to her, for a good-while
more.</P>
<P>When she recover'd more fully, she ask'd me
where she was? I told her, she was in the Ship
yet, but God knows how long it might be; Why,
Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> is not the Storm over? <HI>No, no,</HI>
says I, <HI>Amy; why, Madam,</HI> says she, <HI>it was calm just now,</HI> (meaning when she was in the swooning
<PB N="152" REF="157"/>
Fit, occasion'd by her Fall,) <HI>Calm</HI> Amy, <HI>says I,
'tis far from calm; it may be it will be calm by-and-by,
when we all drown'd, and gone to</HI> HEAVEN.</P>
<P>HEAVEN! madam, <HI>says she,</HI> what makes you
talk so? HEAVEN! I go to HEAVEN! <HI>No,
no,</HI> If I am drown'd, I am damn'd! <HI>Don't you know
what a wicked Creature I have been?</HI> I have been a
Whore to two Men, and have liv'd a wretched a∣bominable
Life of Vice and Wickedness for four∣teen
Years; O Madam, <HI>you know it,</HI> and GOD
knows it; and now <HI>I am to die; to be drown'd; O!</HI>
what will become of me? <HI>I am undone for Ever!</HI> ay,
Madam, <HI>for Ever! to all Eternity! O I am lost! I
am lOst! If I am drown'd, I am lost for Ever!</HI></P>
<P>All these, you will easily suppose, must be so
many Stabs into the very Soul of one in my own
Case; it immediately occur'd to me, <HI>Poor</HI> Amy!
<HI>what art thou, that I am not?</HI> what hast thou been,
that I have not been? Nay, I am guilty of my
own Sin, and thine too: Then it came to my Re∣membrance,
that I had not only been the same with
<HI>Amy,</HI> but that I had been the Devil's Instrument,
to make her wicked; that I had stripp'd her,
and prostituted her to the very Man that I had
been Naught with myself; that she had but fol∣low'd
me; I had been her wicked Example; and
I had led her into all; and that as we had sinn'd
together, now we were likely to sink together.</P>
<P>All this repeated itself to my Thoughts at that
very Moment; and every one of <HI>Amy</HI>'s Cries
sounded thus in my Ears: I am the wicked Cause
of it all; I have been thy Ruin, <HI>Amy;</HI> I have
brought thee to this, and now thou art to suffer
for the Sin I have entic'd thee to; and if thou art
lost for ever, <HI>what must I be?</HI> what must be my
Portion?</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="158"/>
It is true, this Difference was between us, that
I said all these things within myself, and sigh'd,
and mourn'd inwardly; but <HI>Amy,</HI> as her Temper
was more violent, spoke aloud, and cry'd, and
call'd out aloud, like one in an Agony.</P>
<P>I had but small Encouragement to give her, and
indeed, con'd say but very little; but I got her
to compose herself a little, and not let any of the
People of the Ship understand what she meant,
or what she said; but even in her greatest Com∣posure, she continued to express herself with the
utmost Dread and Terror, on account of the wick∣ed
Life she had liv'd; and crying out, she shou'd
be damn'd, and the like; which was very terri∣ble
to me, who knew what Condition I was in my∣self.</P>
<P>Upon these serious Considerations, I was very
Penitent too, for my former Sins, and cry'd out,
<HI>tho' softly,</HI> two or three times, <HI>Lord have Mercy up∣on
me;</HI> to this, I added abundance or Resolutions,
of what a Life I wou'd live, if it should please
God but to spare my Life but this one time;
how I would live a single and a virtuous Life,
and spend a great deal of what I had thus wick∣edly
got, in Acts of Charity, and doing Good.</P>
<P>Under these dreadful Apprehensions, I look'd
back on the Life I had led, with the utmost Con∣tempt
and Abhorrence; I blush'd, and wonder'd
at myself, how I cou'd act thus; how I cou'd di∣vest
myself of Modesty and Honour, and prosti∣tute
myself for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in; and I thought, if ever it
shou'd please G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to spare me this one time from
Death, it wou'd not be possible that I should be
the same Creature again.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> went farther; she pray'd, she resolv'd, she
vow'd to lead a new Life, if God wou'd spare
her but this time: It now began to be Day-light,
<PB N="154" REF="159"/>
for the Storm held all Night-long, and it was
some Comfort to see the Light of another Day,
which indeed, none of us expected; but the Sea
went Mountains high, and the Noise of the Wa∣ter
was as frightful to us, as the Sight of the
Waves; nor was any Land to be seen; nor did
the Seamen know whereabout they were; at last,
to our great Joy, they made Land, which was in
<HI>England,</HI> and on the Coast of <HI>Suffolk;</HI> and the
Ship being in the utmost Distress, they ran for
the Shore, at all Hazards, and with great Diffi∣culty,
got into <HI>Harwich,</HI> where they were safe,
as to the Danger of Death; but the Ship was so
full of Water, and so much damag'd, that if they
had not laid her on Shore the same Day, she
wou'd have sunk before Night, according to the
Opinion of the Seamen, and of the Workmen
on Shore too, who were hir'd to assist them in
stopping their Leaks.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was reviv'd as soon as she heard they
had espy'd Land, and went out upon the
Deck, but she soon came in again to me, <HI>O Ma∣dam,
says she, there's the Land indeed, to be seen,
it looks like a Ridge of Clouds, and may be all a
Cloud, for ought I know, but if it be Land, tis a
great Way off; and the Sea is in such a Combustion,
we shall all perish before we can reach it; '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the
dreadfullest Sight, to look at the Waves, that ever
was seen; why, they are as high as Mountains; we
shall certainly be all swallow'd up, for-all the Land is
so near.</HI></P>
<P>I had conceiv'd some Hope, that if they saw
Land, we should be deliver'd; and I told her,
she did not understand things of that Nature;
that she might be sure, if they saw Land, they
would go directly towards it, and wou'd make
into some Harbour; but it was, as <HI>Amy</HI> said, a
<PB N="155" REF="160"/>
frightful Distance to it: The Land looked like
Clouds, and the Sea went as high as Mountains,
so that no Hope appear'd in the seeing the Land;
but we were in fear of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounding, before we cou'd
reach it; this made <HI>Amy</HI> so desponding still; but
as the Wind, which blew from the <HI>East,</HI> or that
Way, drove us furiously towards the Land; so
when, about half an Hour after, I stept to the
Ste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rage-Door, and look'd-out, I saw the Land
much nearer than <HI>Amy</HI> representd it; so I went
in, and encourag'd <HI>Amy</HI> again, and indeed, was
encourag'd myself.</P>
<P>In about an Hour, or something more, we see,
to our infinite Satisfaction, the open Harbour of
<HI>Harwich,</HI> and the Vessel standing directly towards
it, and in a few Minutes more, the Ship was in
smooth Water, to our inexpressible Comfort;
and thus I had, tho' against my Will, and contra∣ry
to my true Interest, what I wish'd for, to be
driven away to <HI>England,</HI> tho' it was by a Storm.</P>
<P>Nor did this Incident do either <HI>Amy</HI> or me
much Service; for the Danger being over, the
Fears of Death vanish'd with it; ay, and our
Fear of what was beyond Death also; our
Sence of the Life we had liv'd, went off, and
with our return to Life, our wicked Taste of Life
return'd, and we were both the same as before,
if not worse: So certain is it, that the Repent∣ance
which is brought about by the meer Appre∣hensions
of Death, wears off as those Apprehen∣sions
wear off; and Death-bed Repentance, or
Storm-Repentance, which is much the same, is
seldom true.</P>
<P>However, I do not tell you, that this was
all at once, neither; the Fright we had at Sea
lasted a little while afterwards, at least, the Im∣pression
was not quite blown off, as soon as the
<PB N="156" REF="161"/>
Storm; especialiy poor <HI>Amy,</HI> as soon as she set
her Foot on Shore, she fell flat upon the Ground,
and kiss'd it, and gave God thanks for her Deli∣verance
from the Sea; and turning to me when she
got up, I hope, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> you will never go
upon the Sea again.</P>
<P>I know not what ail'd me, not I; but <HI>Amy</HI>
was much more penitent at Sea, and much more
sensible of her Deliverance when she Landed, and
was safe, than I was; I was in a kind of Stupi∣dity,
I know not well what to call it; I had a
Mind full of Horrour in the time of the Storm,
and saw Death before me, as plainly as <HI>Amy,</HI> but
my Thoughts got no Vent, as <HI>Amy</HI>'s did; I had
a silent sullen kind of Grief, which cou'd not
break out either in Words or Tears, and which
was, therefore, much the worse to bear.</P>
<P>I had a Terror upon me for my wicked Life
past, and firmly believ'd I was going to the Bot∣tom,
launching into Death, where I was to give
an Account of all my past Actions; and in this
State, and on that Account, I look'd back upon
my Wickedness with Abhorrence, as I have said
above; but I had no Sence of Repentance, from
the true Motive of Repentance; I saw nothing of
the Corruption of Nature, the Sin of my Life, as
an Offence against God; as a thing odious to the
Holiness of his Being; as abusing his Mercy, and
despising his Goodness; in short, I had no thorow
effectual Repentance; no Sight of my Sins in their
proper Shape; no View of a Redeemer, or Hope
in him: I had only such a Repentance as a Crimi∣nal
has at the Place of Execution, who is sorry,
not that he has committed the Crime, as it is a
Crime, but sorry <HI>that he is to be Hang'd for it.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Amy</HI>'s Repentance wore off too, as
well as mine, but not so soon; however, we were
both, very grave for a time.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="162"/>
As soon as we could get a Boat from the Town,
we went on Shore, and immediately went to a
Publick-House in the Town of <HI>Harwich;</HI> where
we were to consider seriously, what was to be
done, and whether we should go up to <HI>London,</HI> or
stay till the Ship was refitted, which, they said,
would be Fortnight, and then go for <HI>Holland,</HI> as
we intended, and as Business requir'd.</P>
<P>Reason directed that I shou'd go to <HI>Holland,</HI>
for there I had all my Money to receive, and there
I had Persons of good Reputation and Character,
to apply to, having Letters to them from the ho∣nest
<HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant at <HI>Paris,</HI> and they might,
perhaps, give me a Recommendation again, to
Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> and so I should get Acquain∣tance
with some People of Figure, which was
what I lov'd; whereas now I knew not one Crea∣ture
in the whole City of <HI>London,</HI> or any-where
else, that I cou'd go and make myself known to:
Upon these Considerations, I resolv'd to go to <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
a whatever came on it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> cry'd and trembled, and was ready to
fall into Fits, when I did but mention going upon
the Sea again, and begg'd of me, not to go, or if
I wou'd go, that I wou'd leave her behind, tho' I
was to send her a-begging; the People in the Inn
laugh'd at her, and jested with her; ask'd her, if
she had any Sins to confess, that she was asham'd
shou'd be heard of? and that she was troubled
with an evil Conscience; told her, if she came to
Sea, and to be in a Storm, if she had lain with
her Master, she wou'd certainly tell her Mistress
of it; and that it was a common thing, for poor
Maids to confess all the Young-Men they had lain
with; that there was one poor Girl that went over
with her Mistress, whose Husband was a—r,
in—, in the City of <HI>London,</HI> who con∣fess'd,
<PB N="158" REF="163"/>
in the Terror of a Storm, that the had lain
with her Master, and all the Apprentices so often,
and in such and such Places, and made the poor
Mistress, when she return'd to <HI>London,</HI> fly at her
Husband, and make such a Stir, as was indeed,
the Ruin of the whole Family: <HI>Amy</HI> cou'd bear
all that well enough; for tho' she had indeed,
lain with her Master, it was with her Mistress's
Knowledge and Consent, and which was worse,
was her Mistress's own doing; <HI>I record it to the
Reproach of my own Vice,</HI> and to expose the Ex∣cesses
of such Wickedness, as they deserve to be
expos'd.</P>
<P>I thought <HI>Amy</HI>'s Fear would have been over by
that time the Ship would be gotten ready, but I
found the Girl was rather worse and worse; and
when I came to the Point, that we must go on
Board, or lose the Passage, <HI>Amy</HI> was so terrified,
that she fell into Fits, so the Ship went away
without us.</P>
<P>But my going being absolutely necessary, as
above, I was oblig'd to go in the Packet-Boat
some time after, and leave <HI>Amy</HI> behind, at <HI>Har∣wich,</HI>
but with Directions to go to <HI>London,</HI> and stay
there, to receive Letters and Orders from me what
to do: Now I was become, from a Lady of Plea∣sure,
a Woman of Business, and of great Business
too, I assure you.</P>
<P>I got me a Servant at <HI>Harwich,</HI> to go over with
me, who had been at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> knew the Place,
and spoke the Language, which was a great Help
to me, and away I went; I had a very quick Pas∣sage,
and pleasant Weather, and coming to <HI>Rot∣erdam,</HI>
soon found out the Merchant to whom I
was recommended, who receiv'd me with extraor∣dinary
Respect; and first he acknowledg'd the ac∣cepted
Bill for 4000 Pistoles, which he afterwards
<PB N="159" REF="164"/>
paid punctually; other Bills that I had also pay∣able
at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> he procur'd to be receiv'd for
me; and whereas one of the Bills for a Thousand
two Hundred Crowns, was protested at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI>
he paid it me himself, for the Honour of the
Endorser, as he call'd it, which was my Friend,
the Merchant at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>There I enter'd into a Negociation, by his
Means, for my Jewels, and he brought me seve∣ral
Jewellers, to look on them, and particularly,
one to Value them, and to tell me what every
Particular was worth: This was a Man who had
great Skill in Jewels, but did not Trade at that
time; and he, was desir'd by the Gentleman that I
was with, to see that I might not be impos'd
upon.</P>
<P>All this Work took me up near half a Year, and
by managing my Business thus myself, and having
large Sums to do with, I became as expert in it,
as any She-Merchant of them all; I had Credit
in the Bank for a large Sum of Money, and Bills
and Notes for much more.</P>
<P>After I had been here about three Months, my
Maid <HI>Amy</HI> writes me word, that she siad receiv'd
a Letter from her Friend, as she call'd him, that,
<HI>by the way,</HI> was the Prince's Gentleman, that had
been, <HI>Amy</HI>'s extraordinary Friend indeed; for <HI>Amy</HI>
own'd to me, he had lain with her a hundred
times; that is to say, as often as he pleas'd; and
perhaps, in the eight Year which that Affair last∣ed,
it might be a great deal oftner: This was
what she call'd her Friend, who she corresponded
with upon this particular Subject; and among o∣ther
things, sent her this particular News, that
my extraordinary Friend, my real Husband, who
rode in the <HI>Gensd'arms,</HI> was dead; that he was
kill'd in a Rencounter, as they call it, or acciden∣tal
<PB N="160" REF="165"/>
Scuffle among the Troopers; and so the Jade
congratulated me upon my being now a real Free∣Woman;
and now Madam, <HI>says she, at the End of
her Letter,</HI> you have nothing to do but to come hi∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,
and set up a Coach, and a good Equipage;
and if Beauty and a good Fortune won't make you
a Dutchess, nothing will; <HI>but I had not fix'd my
Measures yet;</HI> I had no Inclination to be a Wife
again, I had had such bad Luck with my first
Husband, I hated the Thoughts of it; I found,
that a Wife is treated with Indifference, a Mi∣stress
with a strong Passion; a Wife is look'd up∣on,
as but an Upper-Servant, a Mistress is a So∣vereign;
a Wife must give up all she has; have
every Reserve she makes for herself, be thought
hard of, and be upbraided with her very <HI>Pin-Mo∣ney;</HI>
whereas a Mistress makes the Saying true,
<HI>that what the Man has,</HI> is hers, and <HI>what she has,</HI> is
her own; the Wife bears a thousand Insults, and
is forc'd to sit still and bear it, or part and be un∣done;
a Mistress insulted, helps herself immedi∣ately,
and takes another.</P>
<P>These were my wicked Arguments for Whoring,
for I never set against them the Difference ano∣ther
way, I may say, every other way; <HI>how that,</HI>
FIRST, A Wife appears boldly and honourably
with her Husband; lives at Home, and possesses
his House, his Servants, his Equipages, and has
a Right to them all, and to call them her own;
entertains his Friends, owns his Children, and
has the return of Duty and Affection from them,
as they are here her own, and claims upon his
Estate, by the Custom of <HI>England,</HI> if he dies,
and leaves her a Widow.</P>
<P>The Whore sculks about in Lodgings; is vi∣sited
in the dark; disown'd upon all Occasions, be∣fore
God and Man; is maintain'd indeed, for a
<PB N="161" REF="166"/>
time; but is certainly condemn'd to be abandon'd
at last, and left, to the Miseries of Fate, and her
own just Disaster: If she has any Children, her
Endeavour is to get rid of them, and not main∣tain
them; and if she lives, she is certain to see
them all hate her, and be asham'd of her; while
the Vice rages, and the Man is in the Devil's
Hand, <HI>she has him,</HI> and while she has him, she
makes <HI>a Prey of him;</HI> but if he happens to fall
Sick; if any Disaster befals him, the Cause of all
lies upon her; he is sure to lay all his Misfor∣tunes
at her Door; and if once he comes to Re∣pentance,
or makes but one Step towards a Refor∣mation,
he begins with her; leaves her; uses her
as she deserves, hates her; abhors her; and <HI>sees
her no more;</HI> and that with this never-failing Ad∣dition,
namely, That the more sincere and un∣feign'd
his Repentance is, the more earnestly he
looks up; and the more effectually he looks in,
the more his Aversion to her, encreases; and he
curses her from the Bottom of his Soul; nay,
it must be from a kind of Excess of Charity,
if he so much as wishes God may forgive her.</P>
<P>The opposite Circumstances of a <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Whore,</HI>
are such, and so many, and I have since seen the
Difference with such Eyes, as I cou'd dwelL upon
the Subject a great-while; but my Business is Hi∣story;
I had a long Scene of Folly yet to run
over; perhaps the Moral of all my Story may
bring me back-again to this Part, and if it does,
I shall speak of it fally.</P>
<P>While I continued in <HI>Holland,</HI> I receiv'd several
Letters from my Friend, (so I had good Reason
to call him) the Merchant in <HI>Paris;</HI> in which he
gave me a farther Account o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Conduct of that
Rogue, the <HI>Jew,</HI> and how he acted after I was gone;
how Impatient he was while the said Merchant
<PB N="162" REF="167"/>
kept him in suspence, expecting me to come again;
and how he rag'd when he found I came no more.</P>
<P>It seems, after he found I did not come, he
found out, by his unweary'd Enquiry, where I had
liv'd; and that I had been kept as a Mistress, by
some Great Person, but he cou'd never learn by
who, except that, he learnt the Colour of his
Livery; in Pursuit of this Enquiry, he guess'd
aa the right Person, but cou'd not make it out,
or offer any positive Proof of it; but he found
out the Prince's Gentleman, and talk'd so saucily
to him of it, that the Gentleman treated him, as
the <HI>French</HI> call it, <HI>au Coup de Barton;</HI> that is to say,
Can'd him very severely, as he deserv'd; and
that not satisfying him, or curing his Insolence,
he was met one Night late, upon the <HI>Pont Neuf</HI>
in <HI>Paris,</HI> by two Men, who muffling him up in
a great Cloak, carried him into a more private
Place, and cut off both his Ears, telling him, It
was for talking impudently of his Superiours; ad∣ding,
that he shou'd take Care to govern his
Tongue better, and behave with more Manners,
or the next time they would cut his Tongue out
of his Head.</P>
<P>This put a Check to his Sauciness that Way;
but he comes back to the Merchant, and threat∣ned
to begin a Process against him, for corres∣ponding
with me, and being accessary to the
Murther of the Jeweller, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant found by his Discourse, that
he suppos'd I was protected by the said Prince
<HI>de</HI>—, nay, the Rogue said, he was sure I
was in his Lodgings at <HI>Versailies; for he never had
so much as the least Intimation of the Way I was really
gone;</HI> but that I was there, he was certain, and
certain that the Merchant was privy to it: The
Merchant bade him Defiance; however, he gave
<PB N="163" REF="168"/>
him a great deal of Trouble, and put him to a
great Charge, and had like to have brought him
in for a Party to my Escape, in which Case, he
wou'd have been oblig'd, to have produc'd me,
and that in the Penalty of some capital Sum of
Money.</P>
<P>But the Merchant was too-many for him ano∣ther
Way; for he brought an Information against
him for a Cheat; wherein, laying down the whole
Fact, How he intended-falsly to accuse the Wi∣dow
of the Jeweller, for the suppos'd Murther of
her Husband; that he did it purely to get the
Jewels from her; and that he offer'd to bring him
[<HI>the Merchant</HI>] in, to be Confederate with him,
and to share the Jewels between them; proving
also, his Design to get the Jewels into his Hands,
and then to have dropp'd the Prosecution, up∣on
Condition of my quitting the Jewels to him;
upon this Charge, he got him laid by the Heels;
so he was sent to the <HI>Concergerie,</HI> that is to say, to
<HI>Bridewell,</HI> and the Merchant clear'd: He got out
of Jayl in a little-while, tho' not without the
help of Money, and continued teizing the Mer∣chant
a long while and at last threatning to as∣sassinate
and murther him; so the Merchant, who
having b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ried his Wife about two Months before,
was now a single Man, and not knowing what
such a Villain might do, thought fit to quit <HI>Paris,</HI>
and came away to <HI>Holland</HI> also.</P>
<P>It is most certain, that speaking of Originals, I
was the Source and Spring of all that Trouble and
Vexation to this honest Gentleman; and as it
was afterwards in my Power to have made him
full Satisfaction, and did not, I cannot say but I
added Ingratitude to all the rest of my Follies;
but of that I shall give a fuller Account presently.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="169"/>
I was surpriz'd one Morning, when being at
the Merchant's House, who he had recommended
me to, in <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and being busie in his Coun∣ting-House,
managing my Bills, and preparing to
write a Letter to him, to <HI>Paris,</HI> I heard a Noise
of Horses at the Door; which is not very com∣mon
in a City, where every-body passes by Wa∣ter;
but he had, it seems, ferry'd over the <HI>Maez</HI>
from <HI>Williamstadt,</HI> and so came to the very Door;
and I looking towards the Door, upon hearing the
Horses, saw a Gentleman alight, and come in
at the Gate, I knew nothing, and expected no∣thing,
to be sure, of the Person; but, as I say,
was surpriz'd, and indeed, more than ordinarily
surpriz'd, when coming nearer to me, I saw it was
my Merchant of <HI>Paris;</HI> my Benefactor; and in∣deed,
my Deliverer.</P>
<P>I confess, it was an agreeable Surprize to me,
and I was exceeding glad to see him, who was
so honourable, and so kind to me, and who in∣deed,
had sav'd my Life: As soon as he saw me,
he run to me, took me in his Arms, and kiss'd
me, with a Freedom that he never offer'd to take
with me before; <HI>Dear Madam</HI>—, says he, <HI>I
am glad to see you safe in this Country; if you had
stay'd two Days longer iu</HI> Paris, <HI>you had been uudone:</HI>
I was so glad to see him, that, I cou'd not speak
a good-while, and I burst out into Tears, with∣out
speaking a Word for a Minute; but I reco∣ver'd
that Disorder, and said, <HI>The more,</HI> Sir, <HI>is my
Obligation to you, that sav'd my Life;</HI> and added,
<HI>I am glad to see you here, that I may consider how to
ballance an Account, in which I am so much your
Debtor.</HI></P>
<P>You and I will adjust that Matter easily, <HI>says
he,</HI> now we are so near together; pray where do
you Lodge? <HI>says he.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="170"/>
In a very honest good House, <HI>said I,</HI> where
that Gentleman, your Friend, recommended me;
pointing to the Merchant in whole House we then
were.</P>
<P>And where you may Lodge too, Sir, <HI>says the
Gentleman,</HI> if it suits with your Business, and
your other Conveniency.</P>
<P>With-all my Heart, <HI>says he;</HI> then Madam, <HI>adds
he,</HI> turning to me, I shall be near you, and have
Time to tell you a Story, which will be very
long, and yet many ways very pleasant to you,
how troublesome that devilish Fellow, the <HI>Jew,</HI>
has been to me, on your Account; and what a
hellish Snare he had laid for you, if he cou'd
have found you,</P>
<P>I shall have Leisure too, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> to tell you
all my Adventures since that; which have not
been a few, I assure you.</P>
<P>In short, he took up his Lodgings in the same
House where I lodg'd, and the Room he lay in,
open'd as he was wishing it wou'd, just oppo∣site
to my Lodging-Room; so we cou'd almost
call out of Bed to one another, and I was not at∣all
shy of him on that Score, for I believ'd him
perfectly honest, and so indeed, he was; and if
he had not, that Article was at presnt, no Part
of my Concern.</P>
<P>It was not till two or three Days, and after his
first Hurries of Business were over, that we began
to enter into the History of our Affairs on every
side, but when we began, it took up all our Con∣versation,
for almost a Fortnight: First, I gave
him a particular Account of every thing that
happen'd material upon my Voyage; and how
we were driven into <HI>Harwich</HI> by a very terri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
Storm; how I had left my Woman behind me,
so frighted with the Danger she had been in, that
<PB N="166" REF="171"/>
she dorst not venture to set her Foot into a Ship
again, any more; and that I had not come my self,
if the Bills I had of him, had not been payable
in <HI>Holland;</HI> but that Money, he might see, wou'd
make a Woman go any-where.</P>
<P>He seem'd to laugh at all our womanish Fears
upon the Occasion of the Storm; telling me, it
was nothing but what was very ordinary in those
Seas; but that they had Harbours on every Coast,
so near, that they were seldom in Danger of be∣ing
lost indeed; for, <HI>says he,</HI> if they cannot fetch
one Coast, they can always stand away for ano∣ther,
and run afore it, <HI>as he call'd it,</HI> for one side
or or other: But when I came to tell him what
a crazy Ship it was, and how, even when they
got into <HI>Harwich,</HI> and into smooth Water, they
were fain to run the Ship on Shore, or she wou'd
have sunk in the very Harbour; and when I told
him, that when I look'd out at the Cabin-Door,
I saw the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> one upon his Knees here,
and another there, at their Prayers, then indeed,
he acknowledg'd I had reason to be alarm'd; but
smiling, <HI>he added,</HI> But you, Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> are
so good a Lady, and so pious, you wou'd but
have gone to Heaven a little the sooner, the Dif∣ference
had not been much to you.</P>
<P>I confess, when he said this, it made all the
Blood turn in my Veins, and I thought I shou'd
have fainted; poor Gentleman! thought I, you
know little of me; what wou'd I give to be really
what you really think me to be! He perceiv'd the
Disorder, but said nothing till I spoke; when
shaking my Head, <HI>O Sir!</HI> said I, <HI>Death in any
Shape has some Terror in it;</HI> but in the frightful Fi∣gure
of a Storm at Sea, and a sinking, Ship, it
comes with a double, a trebble, and indeed, an
inexpressible Horrour; and if I were that Saint
<PB N="167" REF="172"/>
you think me to be, which, God knows, I am
not, 'tis still very dismal; I desire to die in a
Calm, if I can: He said a great many good things,
and very prettily order'd, his Discourse, between
serious Reflection and Compliment; but I had
too much Guilt to relish it as it was meant, so
I turn'd it off to something else, and talk'd of the
Necessity I had on me to come to <HI>Holland;</HI> but
I wish'd myself safe on Shore in <HI>England</HI> again.</P>
<P>He told me, he was glad I had such an Obli∣gation
upon me to come over into <HI>Holland,</HI> how∣ever;
but hinted, that he was so interested in
my Wellfare, and besides, had such, farther
Designs upon me, that if I had not so happily
been found in <HI>Holland,</HI> he was resolv'd to have
gone to <HI>England</HI> to see me; and that it was one
of the principal Reasons of his leaving <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, I was extremely oblig'd to him for
so far interesting himself in my Affairs; but that
I had been so far his Debtor before, that I knew
not how any thing could encrease the Debt; for
I ow'd my Life to him already, and I could not
be in Debt for any-thing more valuable than
that.</P>
<P>He answer'd in the most obliging Manner pos∣sible,
that he wou'd put it in my Power to pay that
Debt, and all the Obligations besides, that ever he
had, or should be able to lay upon me.</P>
<P>I began to understand him now, and to see
plainly, that he resolv'd to <HI>make Love to me;</HI> but
I would by no means seem to take the Hint, and
besides I knew that he had a Wife with him in
<HI>Paris;</HI> and I had, <HI>just then, at least,</HI> no Gust to any
more intriguing; however, he surpriz'd me into
a sudden Notice of the thing a little-while after,
by saying something in his Discourse, that he did
<HI>as he said,</HI> in his Wife's Days; I started at that
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
Word; <HI>What mean you by that?</HI> Sir, said I; <HI>Have
you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Wife at</HI> Paris? No, Madam, indeed,
<HI>said he,</HI> my Wife died the beginning of <HI>September</HI>
last; which, it seems, was but a little after I came
away.</P>
<P>We liv'd in the same House all this while;
and as we lodg'd not far off of one-another, Op∣portunities
were not wanting of as near an Ac∣quaintance
as we might desire; nor have such
Opportunities the least Agency in vicious Minds,
to bring to pass even what they might not intend
it first.</P>
<P>However, tho' he courted so much at a di∣stance,
yet his Pretensions were very honourable;
and as I had before found him a most disinterest∣ed
Friend, and perfectly honest in his Dealings,
even when I trusted him with all I had; so now
I found him strictly virtuous, till I made him o∣therwise
myself even almost, whether he wou'd
or no; as you shall hear.</P>
<P>It was not long after our former Discourse,
when he repeated what he had insinuated before,
namely, that he had yet a Design to lay before
me, which, it I wou'd agree to his Proposals,
wou'd more than ballance all Accounts between
us: I told him, I cou'd not reasonably deny him
any-thing; and <HI>except one things, which I hop'd and
believ'd he wou'd not think of,</HI> I should think my∣self
very ungrateful if I did not do every thing for
him that lay in my Power.</P>
<P>He told me, what he should desire of me, wou'd
be fully in my Power to grant, or else he shou'd
be very unfriendly to offer it, and still, all this
while, he declin'd making the Proposal, <HI>as he call'd
it,</HI> and so, for that time, we ended our Discourse,
turning it off to other things; so that, <HI>in short,</HI> I
began to think he might have met with some Di∣saster
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
in his Business, and might have come a∣way
from <HI>Paris</HI> in some Discredit; or had had
some Blow on his Affairs in general; and as really
I had Kindness enough to have parted with a
good Sum to have help'd him, and was in Grati∣tude,
bound to have done so, <HI>he having so effectually
sav'd to me all I had;</HI> so I resolv'd to make him
the Offer, the first time I had an Opportunity,
which, two or three Days after, offer'd itself, ve∣ry
much to my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>He had told me at large, <HI>tho' on several Occa∣sions,</HI>
the Treatment he had met with from the
<HI>Jew,</HI> and what Expence he had put him to; how
at length he had cast him, <HI>as above,</HI> and had re∣cover'd
good Damage of him, but that the Rogue
was unable to make him any considerable Repa∣ration;
he had told me also, how the Prince <HI>d'—'s</HI>
Gentleman had resented his Treatment
of his Master; and how he had caus'd him to be
us'd upon the <HI>Pont Neuf,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>as I have mention'd
above;</HI> which I laugh'd at most heartily.</P>
<P>It is pity, <HI>said I,</HI> that I should sit here, and
make that Gentleman no Amends; if you wou'd
direct me, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> how to do it, I wou'd
make him a handsome Present, and acknowledge
the Justice he had done to me, as well as to the
Prince, his Master: He said he wou'd do what
I directed in it; so I told him, I would send him
500 Crowns; <HI>chat's too much,</HI> said he, <HI>for you are
but half interested in the Ʋsage of the</HI> Jew; <HI>it was
on his Master's Account he corrected him, not on yours:</HI>
Well, however, we were oblig'd, to do nothing in
it, for neither of us knew how to dirct a Letter
to him, or to direct any-body to him; so I told
him, I wou'd leave it till I came to <HI>England,</HI> for
that my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> corresponded with him,
and that he had made Love to her.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="175"/>
Well, but Sir. <HI>said I,</HI> as in requital for his ge∣nerous
Concern for me, I am careful to think of
him; it is but just, that what Expence you have
been oblig'd to be at, which was all on my Ac∣count,
shou'd be repaid you; and therefore, <HI>said I,</HI>
let me see—<HI>and there I paus'd,</HI> and began to rec∣kon
up what I had observ'd from his own Dis∣course,
it had cost him in the several Disputes,
and Hearings, which he had with that <HI>Dog</HI> of a
<HI>Jew,</HI> and I cast them up at something above 2130
Crowns; so I pull'd out some Bills which I had
upon a Merchant in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and a particular
Account in Bank, and was looking on them, in
order to give them to him.</P>
<P>When he seeing evidently what I was going a∣bout,
interrupted me with some Warmth, and told
me, he wou'd have nothing of me on that Ac∣count,
and desir'd I wou'd not pull out my Bills
and Papers on that Score; that he had not told
me the Story on that Account, or with any such
View; that it had been his Misfortune first to
bring <HI>that ugly Rogue</HI> to me, which, tho' it was
with a good Design, yet he wou'd punish himself
with the Expence he had been at, for his being
so unlucky to me; that I cou'd not think so hard
of him, as to suppose he wou'd take Money of
me, <HI>a Widow,</HI> for serving me, and doing Acts of
Kindness to me in a strange Country, and in Di∣stress
too; but, <HI>he said,</HI> he wou'd repeat what he
had said before, that he kept me for a deeper Rec∣koning,
and that, as he had told me, he would
put me into a Posture to Even all that Favour,
as I call'd it, <HI>at once,</HI> so we shou'd talk it over ano∣ther
time, and ballance all together.</P>
<P>Now I expected it wou'd come out, but still he
put it off, as before, from whence I concluded, it
cou'd not be Matter of <HI>Love,</HI> for that those things
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
are not usually delay'd in such a manner, and
therefore it must be Matter of Money; upon
which Thought, I broke the Silence, and told him,
that as he knew I had, by Obligation, more Kind∣ness
for him, than to deny any Favour to him that
I could grant, and that he seem'd backward to
mention his Case; I begg'd Leave of him to give
me Leave to ask him, whether any-thing lay up∣on
his Mind, with respect to his Business and Ef∣fects
in the World? that if it did, he knew what
I had in the World, as well as I did; and that if
he wanted Money, I wou'd let him have any Sum
for his Occasion as far as five or six Thousand
Pistoles, and he shou'd pay me as his own Affairs
wou'd permit; and that, if he never paid me, I
wou'd a ssure him, that I wou'd never give him
any Trouble for it.</P>
<P>He rise up with Ceremony, and gave me Thanks,
in Terms that sufficiently told me, he had been
bred among People more polite, and more courte∣ons,
than is esteem'd the ordinary Usage of the
Dutch; and after his Compliment was over, he
came nearer to me, and told me, that he was o∣blig'd
to assure me, tho' with repeated Acknow∣lodgments
of my kind Offer, that he was not in
any want of Money; that he had met with no
Uneasiness in any of his Affairs, no not of any
Kind whatever, except that of the Loss of his
Wife, and one of his Children, which indeed,
had troubled him much; but that this was no Part
of what he had to offer to me, and by granting
which, I shou'd ballance all Obligations; but that,
in short, it was that seeing Providence had (as
it were for that Purpose) taken his Wife from
him, I wou'd make up the Loss to him; and
with, that, he held me fast in his Arms, and kis∣sing
me, wou'd not give me Leave to say No,
and hardly to Breathe.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="177"/>
At length, having got room to speak, I told
him, that, as I had said before, I could deny
him but one thing in the World; I was very sor∣ry
he shou'd propose <HI>that thing only</HI> that I cou'd
not grant.</P>
<P>I could not but smile however, to myself, that
he shou'd make so many Circles, and round-about
Motions, to come at a Discourse which had no
such rarity at the Bottom of it, if he had known
all: Put there was another Reason why I resolv'd
not to have him, when, at the same time, if he
Bad courted me in a Manner less honest or virtu∣ous,
I believe I shou'd not have denied him; but
I shall come to that Part presently.</P>
<P>He was, as I have said, long a-bringing it out,
but when he had brought it out, he pursued it
with such Importunities, as would admit of no De∣nial,
<HI>at least he intended they shou'd not;</HI> but I re∣sisted
them obstinately, and yet with Expressions
of the utmost Kindness and Respect for him that
cou'd be imagin'd, often telling him, there was
nothing else in the World that I cou'd deny him,
and shewing him all the Respect, and upon all Oc∣casions
treating him with Intimacy and Freedom,
as if he had been my Brother.</P>
<P>He tried all the Ways imaginable to bring his
Design to pass, but I was inflexible; at last, he
thought of a Way, which, he flatter'd himself
wou'd not fail; nor would he have been mistaken
perhaps, in any other Woman in the World, <HI>but
me;</HI> this was, to try if he cou'd take me at an Ad∣vantage,
and get to-Bed to me, and then, <HI>as was
most rational to think,</HI> I should willingly enough
marry him afterwards.</P>
<P>We were so intimate together, that nothing but
Man and Wife could, or at least ought to be, more;
but still our Freedoms kept within the Bounds of
<PB N="173" REF="178"/>
Modesty and Decency; But one Evening, above
all the rest, we were very merry, and I fancy'd he
push'd the Mirth to watch for his Advantage;
and I resolv'd that I wou'd, at least, feign to be
as merry as he; and that, in short, if he offer'd
any-thing, he shou'd have his Will easily enough.</P>
<P>About One a-Clock in the Morning, for so long
we sat-up together, I said, <HI>Come,</HI> 'tis One a-Clock,
<HI>I must go to-Bed; Well,</HI> says he, <HI>I'll go with you;</HI>
No, No, says I, <HI>go to your own Chamber;</HI> he said
he wou'd go to-Bed with me: <HI>Nay,</HI> says I, <HI>if you
will,</HI> I don't know what to say; <HI>if I can't help it,
you must:</HI> However, I got from him, left him, and
went into my Chamber, but did not shut the
Door; and as he cou'd easily see that I was un∣dressing
myself, he steps to his own Room, which
was but on the same Floor, and in a few Minutes
undresses himself also and returns to my Door in
his Gown and Slippers.</P>
<P>I thought he had been gone indeed, and so that
he had been in jest; and by the way, thought either
he had no-mind to the thing, or that he never
intended it; so I shut my Door, that is, latch'd
it, for I seldom lock'd or bolted it, and went to-Bed;
I had not been in-Bed a Minute, but he
comes in his Gown, to the Door, and opens it a
little-way, but not enough to come in, or look in,
and says softly, What are you really gone to-Bed?
<HI>Yes, yes,</HI> says I, <HI>get you gone:</HI> No indeed, says he,
<HI>I shall not begone, you gave me Leave before, to come
to-Bed and you shan't say get you gone now:</HI> So he
comes into my Room, and then turns about, and
fastens the Door, and immediately comes to the
Bed-side to me: I pretended, to scold and struggle,
and bid him begone, with more Warmth than be∣fore;
but it was all one; he had not a Rag of
Cloaths on, but his Gown and Slippers, and Shirt;
<PB N="174" REF="179"/>
so he throws off his Gown, and throws open the
Bed, and came in at once.</P>
<P>I made a seeming Resistance, but it was no more
indeed; for, <HI>as above,</HI> I resolv'd from the Begin∣ning,
he shou'd Lye with me if he wou'd, and
for the rest, I left it to come after.</P>
<P>Well he lay with me that Night, and the two
next, and very merry we were all the three Days
between; but the third Night he began to be a
little more grave: Now, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> tho'
I have push'd this Matter farther than ever I in∣tended;
or than, I believe, you expected from me,
who never made any Pretences to you but what
were very honest; yet to heal it all up, and let
you see how sincerely I meant at first, and how
honest I will ever be to you, I am ready to mar∣ry
you still, and desire you no let it be done to∣Morrow
Morning; and I will give you the same
fair Conditions of Marriage as I wou't have done
before.</P>
<P>This, it must be own'd, was a Testimony that
he was very honest, and that he lov'd me sincere∣ly;
but I construed it quite another Way, name∣ly;
that he aim'd at the Money: But how sur∣priz'd
did he look! and how was he confounded,
when he so found me receive his proposal with, Cold∣ness
and Indifference! and still tell him, that it
was the <HI>only thing</HI> I cou'd not grant!</P>
<P>He was astonish'd! What, not take me now!
<HI>says he,</HI> when I have been a-Bed with you! I an∣swer'd
coldly, tho' respectfully still, <HI>It is true,</HI> to
my Shame be it spoken, says I, <HI>that you have ta∣ken
me by Surprize, and have had your Will of me;
but I hope you will not take it ill that I cannot consent
to Marry, for-all that; if I am with-Child,</HI> said I,
<HI>Care must be taken to manage that as you shall direct;
I hope you won't expose me for my having expos'd my∣self
<PB N="175" REF="180"/>
to you, but I cannot go any farther;</HI> and at that
Point I stood, and wou'd hear of no Matrimony,
by any means.</P>
<P>Now because this may seem a little odd, I shall
state the Matter clearly, as I understood it my∣self;
I knew that while I was Mistress, it is
customary for the Person kept; to receive from
them that keep; but if I shou'd be a Wife, all
I had then, was given up to the Husband, and
I was thenceforth to be under his Authority on∣ly;
and as I had Money enough, and needed not
fear being what they call <HI>a cast-off Mistrese,</HI> so I
had no need to give him twenty Thousand Pound
to marry me, which had been buying my Lodging
too dear a great deal.</P>
<P>Thus his Project of coming to-Bed to me, was
a Bite upon himself, while he intended, it for a
Bite upon me; and he was no nearer his Aim of
marrying me, than he was before; all his Argu∣ments
he could urge upon the Subject of Matri∣mony,
were at an Fnd, for I positively declin'd
marrying him; and as he had refus'd the thou∣sand
Pistoles which I had offer'd him in Compen∣sation
for his Expences and Loss, at <HI>Paris,</HI> with
the <HI>Jew,</HI> and had done it upon the Hopes he had
of marrying me; so when he found his Way
difficult still, he was amaz'd, and, I had some
Reason to believe, repented that he had refus'd
the Money.</P>
<P>But thus it is when Men run into wicked Mea∣sures,
to bring their Designs about; I that was in∣finitely
oblig'd, to him before, began to talk to
him, as if I had ballanc'd Accounts with him
now; and that the Favour of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying with a Whore,
was equal, not to the thousand Pistoles only, but
to all the Debt I ow'd him, for saving my Life,
and all my Effects.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="181"/>
But he drew himself into it, and tho' it was
a dear Bargain, yet it was a Bargain of his own
making he cou'd not say I had trick'd him into
it; but as he projected and drew me in to lye
with him, depending that it was a sure Game in
order to a Marriage, so I granted him the Fa∣vour,
as he call'd it, to ballance the Account of
Favours receiv'd from him, and keep the thousand
Pistoles with a good Grace.</P>
<P>He was extremely disappointed in this Article,
and knew not how to manage for a great-while;
and as I dare say, if he had not expected to have
made it an Earnest for marrying me, he would
never have attempted me the other way; so, I
believ'd, if it had not been for the Money, which
he knew I had, he wou'd never have desir'd
to marry me after he had lain with me: For,
where is the Man that cares to marry a Whore, tho'
of his own making? And as I knew him to be
no Fool, so I did him no Wrong, when I sup∣pos'd
that, but for the Money, he wou'd not
have had any Thoughts of me that Way; espe∣cially
after my yielding as I had done; in which
it is to be remember'd, that I made no Capitula∣tion
for marrying him, when I yielded to him,
but let him do just what he pleas'd, without any
previous Bargain.</P>
<P>Well, hitherto we went upon Guesses at one-another's
Designs but as he continued to impor∣tune
me to marry, tho' he had lain with me,
and still did lye with me as often as he pleas'd,
and I continued to refuse to marry him, tho'
I let him lye with me whenever de desir'd it; I
say, as these two Circumstances made up our
Conversation, it cou'd not continue long thus, but
we must come to an Explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="182"/>
One Morning, in the middle of our unlawful,
Freedoms, that is to say, when we were in Bed
together; he sigh'd, and told me, he desir'd my
Leave to ask me one Question, and that I wou'd
give him an Answer to it with the same ingenu∣ous
Freedom and Honesty, that I had us'd to treat
him with; I told him I wou'd: Why then his
Question was, why I wou'd not marry him, seeing
I allow'd him all the Freedom of a Husband? <HI>Or,
says he,</HI> my Dear, <HI>since you have been so kind as to
take me to your Bed, why will you not make me
your Own, and take me for good-and-all,</HI> that we
may enjoy ourselves, <HI>without any Reproach to one-another?</HI></P>
<P>I told him, that as I confess'd it was the
only thing I cou'd not comply with him in, so it
was the only thing in all my Actions, that I could
not give him a Reason for; that it was true, I had
let him come to-Bed to me, which was suppos'd
to be the greatest Favour a Woman could grant;
but it was evident, and he might see it, that as I
was sensible of the Obligation I was under to him,
for saving me from the worst Circumstance it was
possible for me to be brought to, I could deny
him nothing; and if I had had any greater Fa∣vour
to yield him, I should have done it, <HI>that of
Matrimony only excepted,</HI> and he cou'd not but see
that I lov'd him to an extraordinary Degree, in
every Part of my Behaviour to him; but that
as to marrying, which was giving up my Liberty,
it was what once he knew I had done, and he had
seen how it had hurried me up and down in the
World, and what it had expos'd me to; that I
had an Aversion to it, and desir'd he wou'd not
insist upon it he might easily see I had no A∣version
to him; and that if I was with-Child by
him, he shou'd see a Testimony of my Kindness
<PB N="178" REF="183"/>
to the Father, for that I wou'd settle all I had in
the World upon the Child.</P>
<P>He was mute a good-while; at last, <HI>says he,</HI>
Come, my Dear, you are the first Woman in the
World that ever lay with a Man, and then refus'd
to marry him, and therefore there must be some o∣ther
Reason for your Refusal; and I have therefore,
One other Request, and that is, If I guess at the true
Reason, and remove the Objection, will you then
yield to me? I told him, if he remov'd the Ob∣jection,
I must needs comply, for I shou'd cer∣tainly
do every-thing that I had no Objection
against.</P>
<P>Why then, my Dear, it must be, that either
you are already engag'd, and marry'd to some o∣ther
Man, or you are not willing to dispose of
your Money to me, and expect to advance your∣self
higher with your Fortune; now, if it be the
first of these, my Mouth will be stopp'd, and I
have no more to say; but if it be the last, I am
prepar'd effectually to remove the Objection, and
answer all you can say on that Subject.</P>
<P>I took him up short at the first of these; tel∣ling
him, He must have base Thoughts of me
indeed, to think that I could yield to him in such
a Manner as I had done, and continue it with so
much Freedom, as he found I did, if I had a
Husband, or were engag'd to any other Man; and
that he might depend upon it, that was not my
Case, nor any Part of my Case.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>said he,</HI> as to the other, I have an
Offer to make to you, that shall take off all the
Objection, <HI>viz.</HI> That I will not touch one Pistole
of your Estate, more, than shall be with your
own voluntary Consent; neither now, or at any
other time, but you shall settle it as you please,
for your Life, and upon who you please after your
<PB N="179" REF="184"/>
Death; that I shou'd see he was able to maintain
me without it; and that it was not for that,
that he follow'd me from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I was indeed, surpriz'd at that Part of his Of∣fer,
and he might easily perceive it; it was not
only what I did not expect, but it was what I
knew not what Answer to make to: He had in∣deed,
remodv'd my principal Objection, nay, all
my Objections, and it was not possible for me to
give any Answer; for if upon so generous an
Offer I shou'd agree with him, I then did
as good as confess, that it was upon the Ac∣count
of my Money that I refus'd him; and that
tho' I cou'd give up my Virtue, and expose my∣self,
yet I wou'd not give up my Money, which,
tho' it was true, yet was really too gross for me
to acknowledge, and I cou'd not pretend to mar∣ry
him upon that Principle neither; then as to
having him, and make over all my Estate out of
his Hands, to us not to give him the Manage∣ment
of what I had, I thought it would be not
only a little Gothick and Inhumane, but would be
always a Foundation of Unkindness between us,
and render us suspected one to another; so that,
upon the whole, I was oblig'd to give a new
Turn to it, and talk upon a kind of an elevated
Strain, which really was not in my Thoughts at
first, at-all; for I own, <HI>as above,</HI> the divesting
myself of my Estate, and putting my Money out
of my Hand, was the Sum of the Matter, that
made me refuse to marry; but, I say, I gave it a
new Turn, upon this Occasion, as follows:</P>
<P>I told him, I had, perhaps, differing Notions
of Matrimony, from what the receiv'd Custom
had given us of it; that I thought a Woman was
a free Agent, as well as a Man and was born free,
and cou'd she manage herself suitably, might en∣joy
<PB N="180" REF="185"/>
that Liberty to as much Purpose as the Men
do; that the Laws of Matrimony were indeed,
otherwise, and Mankind at this time, acted quite
upon other Principles; and those such, that a
Woman gave herself entirely away from herself
in Marriage, and capitulated only to be, at best,
but <HI>an Ʋpper-Servant,</HI> and from the time she took
the Man, she was no better or wors than the
Servant among the <HI>Israelites,</HI> who had his Ears
bor'd, <HI>that is,</HI> nail'd to the Door-Post; who by
that Act, gave himself up to be a Servant du∣ring
Life.</P>
<P>That the very Nature of the Marriage-Contract
was, in short, nothing but giving up Liberty,
Estate, Authority, and every-thing, to the Man,
and the Woman was indeed, a meer Woman ever
after, that is to say, a Slave.</P>
<P>He reply'd, that tho' in some Respects it was
as I had said, yet I ought to consider, that as
an Equivalent to this, the Man had all the Care
of things devolv'd upon him; that the Weight of
Business lay upon his Shoulders, and as he had
the Trust, so he had the Toil of Life upon him,
his was the Labour, his the Anxiety of Living;
that the Woman had nothing to do, but to eat
the Fat, and drink the Sweet; to sit still, and
look round her; be waited on, and made much
of; be serv'd, and lov'd, and made easie; <HI>especi∣ally
if the Husband acted as became him;</HI> and that,
in general, the Labour of the Man was appointed
to make the Woman live quiet and unconcern'd
in the World; that they had the Name of Sub∣jection,
without the Thing; and if in inferiour Fa∣milies,
they had the Drudgery of the House, and
Care of the Provisions upon them; yet they had
indeed, much the easier Part; for in general, the
Women had only the Care of managing, that is,
<PB N="181" REF="186"/>
spending what their Husbands get; and that a
Woman had the Name of Subjection indeed, but
that they generally commanded not the Men on∣ly,
but all they had; manag'd all for themselves,
and where the Man did his Duty, the Woman's
Life was all Ease and Tranquility; and that she
had nothing to do but to be easie, and to make
all that were about her both easie and merry.</P>
<P>I return'd, that while a Woman was single, she
was a Masculine in her politick Capacity; that
she had then the full Command of what she had,
and the full Direction of what she did; that she
was a Man in her separated Capacity, to all In∣tents
and Purposes that a Man cou'd be so to
himself that she was controul'd by none, because
accountable to none, and was in Subjection to
none; so I sung these two Lines of Mr.—'<HI>s.</HI></P>
<Q><L>O! 'tis pleasant to be free,</L>
<L>The sweetest MISS is Liberty.</L></Q>
<P>I added, that whoever the Woman was, that
had an Estate, and would give it up to be the
Slave of <HI>a Great Man,</HI> that Woman was a Fool,
and must be fit for nothing but a Beggar; that
it was my Opinion, a Woman was as fit to go∣vern
and enjoy her own Estate, without a Man, as
a Man was, without a Woman; and that, if she
had a-mind to gratifie herself as to Sexes, she
might entertain a Man, as a Man does a Mi∣stress;
that while she was thus single, she
was her own, and if she gave away that Power,
she merited to be as miserable as it was possible
that any Creature cou'd be.</P>
<P>All he cou'd say, cou'd not answer the Force
of this, as to Argument; only this, that the other
Way was the ordinary Method that the World
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>
was guided by; that he had Reason to ecpect I
shou'd be content with that which all the World
was contented with; that he was of the Opinion,
that a sincere Affection between a Man and his
Wife, answer'd all the Objections that I had made
about the being a Slave, a Servant, <HI>and the like;</HI>
and where there was a mutual Love, there cou'd
be no Bondage; but that there was but one In∣terest;
one Aim; one Design; and all conspir'd
to make both very happy.</P>
<P><HI>Ay,</HI> said I, <HI>that is the Thing I complain of;</HI> the
Pretence of Affection, takes from a Woman every
thing that can be call'd <HI>herself,</HI> she is to have no
Interest; no Aim; no View; but all is the In∣terest,
Aim, and View, of the Husband; she is
to be the passive Creature you spoke of, <HI>said I;</HI>
she is to lead a Life of perfect Indolence, and
living by Faith (not in God, but) in her Hus∣band,
she sinks or swims, as he is either Fool or
wise Man; unhappy or prosperois, and in the
middle of what she thinks is her Happiness and
Prosperity, she is ingulph'd in Misery and Beg∣gary,
which she had not the least Notice, Know∣ledge,
or Suspicion of: How often have I seen a
Woman living in all the Splendor that a plentiful
Fortune ought to allow her? with her Coaches
and Equipages; her Family, and rich Furniture;
her Attendants and Friends; her Visiters, and
good Company, all about her to-Day; to-Mor∣row
surpriz'd with a Disaster; turn'd out of all
by a Commission of Bankrupt; stripp'd to the
Cloaths on her Back; her Jointure, <HI>suppose she
had it,</HI> is sacrific'd to the Creditors, so long as her
Husband liv'd, and she turn'd into the Street, and
left to live on the Charity of her Friends, <HI>if she
has any,</HI> or follow the Monarch, her Husband, in∣to
the <HI>Mint,</HI> and live there on the Wreck of his
<PB N="183" REF="188"/>
Fortunes, till he is forc'd to run away from her,
even there; and then she fees her Children starve;
herself miserable; breaks her Heart; and cries
herself to Death? This, <HI>sas I,</HI> is the State, of
many a Lady that has had ten Thousand Pound
to her Portion.</P>
<P>He did not know how feelingly I spoke this,
and what Extremities I had gone thro' of this
Kind; how near I was to the very last Article
above, <HI>viz. crying myself to Death;</HI> and how I re∣ally
starv'd for almost two Years together.</P>
<P>But he shook his Head, and said, Where had
I liv'd? and what dreadful Families had I liv'd
among, that had frighted me into such terrible
Apprehensions of things? that these things indeed,
might happen where Men run into hazardous
things in Trade, and without Prudence, or due
Consideration, launch'd their Fortunes in a De∣gree
beyond their Strength, grasping at Adven∣tures
beyond their Stocks, <HI>and the like;</HI> but that,
as he was stated in the World, if I wou'd embark
with him, he had a Fortune equal with mine;
that together; we should have no Occasion of
engaging in Business any more; but that in any
Part of the World where I had a-mind to live,
whether <HI>England, France, Holland,</HI> or where I
would, we might settle, and live, as happily as
the World could make any one live, that if I
desir'd the Management of our Estate, when put
together, if I wou'd not trust him with mine, he
would trust me with his; that we wou'd be up∣on
one Bottom, and I shou'd steer: Ay, <HI>says I,</HI>
you'll allow me to steer, <HI>that is,</HI> hold the Helm, but
you'll conn the Ship, <HI>as they call it;</HI> that is, as at
Sea, a Boy serves to stand at the Helm, but he that
gives him the Orders, is Piiot.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="189"/>
He laugh'd, at my Simile; No, <HI>says he,</HI> you
shall be Pilot then, you shall conn the Ship; ay,
<HI>says I,</HI> as long as you please, but you can take
the Helm out of my Hand when you please, and
bid me go spin: It is not you, <HI>says I,</HI> that I sus∣pect,
but the Laws of Matrimony puts the Power
into your Hands; bids you do it; commands you
to command; and binds me, forsooth, to obey;
you, that are now upon even Terms with me, and
I with you, <HI>says I,</HI> are the next Hour set up upon
the Throne, and the humble Wife plac'd at your
Footstool; all the rest, all that you call Oneness
Of Interest, Mutual Affection, <HI>and the like,</HI> is Cur∣tefie
and Kindness then, and a Woman is indeed,
infinitely oblig'd where she meets with it; but
cau't help herself where it fails.</P>
<P>Well, he did not give it over yet, but came to
the serious Part, and there he thought he should
be too many for me; he first hinted, that Mar∣riage
was decreed by Heaven; that it was the
fix'd State of Life, which God had appointed for
Man's Felicity, and for establishing a legal Poste∣rity;
that there cou'd be no legal Claim of Estates
by Inheritance, but by Children born in Wed∣lock;
that all the rest was sunk under Scandal
and Illegitimacy; and very well he talk'd upon
that Subject, indeed.</P>
<P>But it wou'd not do; I took him short there;
Look you, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> you have an Advantage of
me there indeed, in my particular Case; but it
wou'd not be generous to make use of it; I rea∣dily
grant, that at were better for me to have
marry'd you, than to admit you to the Liberty
I have given you; but as I cou'd not reconcile
my Judgment to Marriage, for the Reasons above,
and had Kindness enough for you, and Obliga∣tion
too much on me, to resist you, I suffer'd your
<PB N="185" REF="190"/>
Rudeness, and gave up my Virtue; but I have two
things before me to heal up that Breach of Honour,
without that desperate one of Marriage; and those
are, Repentance for what is past, and putting an
End to it for Time to come.</P>
<P>He seem'd to be concern'd, to think that I
shou'd take him in that Manner; he assur'd me
that I mis-understood him; that he had more
Manners, as well as more Kindness for me; and
more Justice, than to reproach me with what he had
been the Aggressor in, and had surpriz'd me into;
That what he spoke, refer'd to my Words above;
that the Woman, if she thought fit, might en∣tertain
a Man, as the Man did a Mistress; and
that I seem'd to mention that way of Living as
justifiable, and setting it as a lawful thing, and in
the Place of Matrimony.</P>
<P>Well, we strain'd some Compliments upon
those Points, not worth repeating; and I added,
I suppos'd when he got to-Bed to me, he thought
himself sure of me; and indeed, in the ordinary
Course of things, after he had lain with me, he
ought to think so; but that, upon the same foot
of Argument which I had discours'd with him
upon, it was just the contrary; and when a Wo∣man
had been weak enough to yield up the last
Point before Wedlock, it wou'd be adding one
Weakness to another, to take the Man afterwards;
to pin down the Shame of it upon herself all
Days of her Life, and bind herself to live all her
Time with the only Man that cou'd upbraid her
with it; that in yielding at first, she must be a
Fool, but to take the Man, is to be sure to be
call'd Fool; that to resist a Man, is to act with
Courage and Vigour, and to cast off the Reproach,
which, in the Course of things, drops out of
Knowledge, and dies; the Man goes one-way, and
<PB N="186" REF="191"/>
the Woman another, as Fate, and the
Circum∣stances of Living direct; and if they keep one∣another's
Council, the Folly is heard no more of;
but to take the Man, <HI>says I,</HI> is the most preposte∣rous
thing in Nature, and (saving your Presence)
is to befoul one's-self, and live always in the Smell
of it; <HI>No, no,</HI> added I, after a Man has lain with
me <HI>as a Mistress,</HI> he ought never to lye with me
<HI>as a Wife;</HI> that's not only preserving the Crime
in Memory, but it is recording it in the Family;
if the Woman marries the Man afterwards, she
bears the Reproach of it to the last Hour; if
her Husband is not a Man of a hundred Thou∣sand,
he sometime or other upbraids her with it;
if he has Children, they fail not one way or o∣ther,
to hear of it; if the Children are virtu∣ous,
they do their Mother the Justice to hate her
for it; if they are wicked, they give her the
Mortification of doing the like, and giving her
for the Example: On the other-hand, if the
Man and the Woman part, there is an End of the
Crime, and an End of the Clamour; Time wears
out the Memory of it; or a Woman may remove
but a few Streets, and she soon out-lives it, and
hears no more of it.</P>
<P>He was confounded at this Discourse, and told
me, he cou'd not say but I was right in the Main;
that as to that Part relating to managing Estates,
it was arguing <HI>a la Cavalier;</HI> it was in some Sence,
right, if the Women were able to carry in on so,
but that in general, the Sex were not capable of
it; their Heads were not turn'd for it, and they
had better choose a Person capable, and honest,
that knew how to do them Justice, as Women,
as well as to love them; and that then the Trou∣ble
was all taken off of their Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="192"/>
I told him, it was a dear Way of purchasing
their Ease; for very often when the Tremble was
taken off of their Hands, so was their Money too;
and that I thought it was far safer for the Sex
not to be afraid of the Trouble, but to be really
afraid of their Money; that if no-body was
trusted, no-body wou'd be deceiv'd; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he
Staff in their own Hands, was the best Security
in the World.</P>
<P>He reply'd, that I had started a new thing in the
World; that however I might support it by subtle
reasoning, yet it was a way of arguing that was
contrary to the general Practice, and that he con∣fess'd
he was much disappointed in it; that had
he known I wou'd have made such a Use of it,
he wou'd never have attempted what he did,
which he had no wicked Design in, resolving to
make me Reparation, and that he was very sorry
he had been so unhappy; that he was very sure
he shou'd never upbraid me with it hereafter,
and had so good an Opinion of me, as to believe
I did not suspect him; but seeing I was positive
in refusing him, notwithstanding what had pass'd,
he had nothing to do but to secure me from Re∣proach,
by going back again to <HI>Paris,</HI> that so, ac∣cording
to my own way of arguing, it might die
out of Memory, and I might never meet with it
again to my Disadvantage.</P>
<P>I was not pleas'd with this Part at-all, for I had
no-mind to let him go neither; and yet I had no∣mind
to give him such hold of me as he wou'd
have had; and thus I was in a kind of suspence,
irresolute, and doubtful what Course to take.</P>
<P>I was in the House with, him, as I have observ'd,
and I saw evidently that he was preparing to go
back to <HI>Paris;</HI> and particularly, I found he was
remitting Money to <HI>Paris,</HI> which was, as I un∣derstood
<PB N="188" REF="193"/>
afterwards, to pay for some Wines which he
had given Order to have bought for him, at
<HI>Troyes</HI> in <HI>Champagne;</HI> and I knew not what Course
to take; and besides that, I was very loth to part
with him; I found also, that I was with-Child
by him, which was what I had not yet told him
of; and sometimes I thought not to tell him of
it at-all; but I was in a strange Place, and had
no Acquaintance, tho' I had a great deal of Sub∣stance,
which indeed, having no Friends there,
was the more dangerous to me.</P>
<P>This oblig'd me to take him one Morning,
when I saw him, as I thought, a little anxious a∣bout
his going, and irresolute; <HI>says I</HI> to him,
<HI>I fancy you can hardly find in your Heart to
leave me now:</HI> The more <HI>unkind is it in you,</HI> said
he, severely <HI>unkind, to refuse a Man that knows not
how to part with you.</HI></P>
<P>I am so far from being unkind to you, <HI>said I,</HI> that
I will go all over the World with you, if you
desir'd me, except to <HI>Paris,</HI> where you know I
can't go.</P>
<P>It is pity so much Love, <HI>said he,</HI> on both Sides,
shou'd ever separate.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>said I,</HI> do you go away from me?</P>
<P>Because, <HI>said he,</HI> you won't take me.</P>
<P>But if I won't take you, <HI>said I,</HI> you may take
me, any-where, but to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>He was very loth to go any-where, <HI>he said,</HI> with∣out
me; but he must go to <HI>Paris,</HI> or to the <HI>East∣Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I told him I did not usee to court, but I durst
venture myself to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> with him, if
there was a Necessity of his going.</P>
<P>He told me, God be thank'd, he was in no
Necessity of going any-where, but that he had a
tempting Invitation to go to the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="194"/>
I answer'd, I wou'd say nothing to that; but
that I desir'd he wou'd go any-where but to <HI>Paris;</HI>
because there he knew I must not go.</P>
<P>He said he had no Remedy, but to go where
I cou'd not go; for he cou'd not bear to see me,
if he must not have me.</P>
<P>I told him, that was the unkindest thing he
cou'd say of me, and that I ought to take it very
ill, seeing I knew how very well to oblige him to
stay, without yielding to what he knew I cou'd
not yield to.</P>
<P>This amaz'd him, and he told me, I was pleas'd
to be mysterious; but, that he was sure it was in
no-body's Power to hinder him going, if he re∣solv'd
upon it, except me; who had Influence e∣nough
upon him to make him do any-thing.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>I told him,</HI> I cou'd hinder him, because I
knew he cou'd no more do an unkind thing by
me, than he cou'd do an unjust one; and to put
him out of his Pain, I told him I was with-Child.</P>
<P>He came to me, and taking me in his Arms,
and kissing me a Thousand times almost, said,
Why wou'd I be so unkind, not to tell him that
before?</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>'twas hard,</HI> that, to have him stay,
I shou'd be forc'd do as Criminals do to avoid the
Gallows, <HI>plead my Belly;</HI> and that I thought I
had given him Testimonies enough of an Affe∣ction
equal to that of a Wife; if I had not
only lain with him; been with-Child by him;
shewn myself unwilling to part with him; but
offer'd to go to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> with him; and ex∣cept
One Thing that I could not grant, what cou'd
he ask more?</P>
<P>He stood mute a good-while but afterwards
told me, he had a great-deal more to say, if I
cou'd assure him, that I wou'd not take ill what∣ever
<PB N="190" REF="195"/>
Freedom he might use with me in his Dis∣course.</P>
<P>I told him, he might use any Freedom in Words
with, me; for a Woman who had given Leave to
such other Freedoms, as I had done, had left her∣self
no room to take any-thing ill, let it be what
it wou'd.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>he said,</HI> I hope you believe, Madam,
I was born a Christian, and that I have some
Sence of Sacred Things upon my Mind; when I
first broke-in upon my own Virtue, and assaulted
yours; when I surpriz'd, and, as it were, forc'd
you to that which, neither you intended, or I
design'd, but a few Hours before, it was upon a
Presumption that you wou'd certainly marry me,
if once I cou'd go that Length with you; and it
was with an honest Resolution to make you my
Wife.</P>
<P>But I have been surpriz'd with such a Denial,
that no Woman in such Circumstances ever gave
to a Man; for certainly it was never known, that
any Woman refus'd to marry a Man that had first
lain with her, much less a Man that had gotten
her with-Child; but you go upon different Noti∣ons
from all the World; and tho' you reason up∣on
it so strongly, that a Man knows hardly what
to answer, yet I must own, there is something in
it shocking to Nature, and something very un∣kind
to yourself; but above all, it is unkind to
the Child that is yet unborn; who, if we mar∣ry,
will come into the World with Advantage
enough, but if not, is ruin'd before it is born;
must bear the eternal Reproach of what it is not
guilty of; must be branded from its Cradle with
a Mark of Infamy, be loaded with the Crimes
and Follies of its Parents, and suffer for Sins that
it never committed; This I take to be very hard,
<PB N="191" REF="196"/>
and indeed cruel to the poor Infant not yet
born, who you cannot think of, with any Patience,
if you have the common Affection of a Mother,
and not do that for it, which shou'd at once
place it on a Level with the rest or the World;
and not leave it to curse its Parents for what also
we ought to be asham'd of: I cannot, therefore,
<HI>says he,</HI> but beg and intreat you, as you are a Chri∣stian,
and a Mother, not to let the innocent Lamb
you go with, be ruin'd before it is born, and
leave it to curse and reproach us hereafter, for
what may be so easily avoided.</P>
<P>Then, dear Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> with a World of
Tenderness, (and I thought I saw Tears in his
Eyes) allow me to repeat it, that I am a Christian,
and consequently I do not allow what I have
rashly, and without due Consideration, done; I
say, I do not approve of it as lawful; and there∣fore
tho' I did, with a View I have mention'd, one
unjustifiable Action, I cannot say, that I cou'd
satisfie myself to live in a continual Practice of
what, in Judgement, we must both condemn;
and tho' I love you above all the Women in the
World, and have done enough, to convince you
of it, by resolving to marry you after what has
pass'd between us, and by offering to quit all Pre∣tensions
to any Part of your Estate, so that I
shou'd, as it were, take a Wife after I had lain
with her, and without a Farthing Portion; which,
as my Circumstances are, I need not do; I say,
notwithstanding my Affection to you, which is in∣expressible,
yet I cannot give up Soul as well as
Body, the Interest of this World, and the Hopes
of another; and you cannot call this my Disre∣spect
to you.</P>
<P>If ever any Man in the World was truly valu∣able
for the strictest honesty of Intention, <HI>this was
<PB N="192" REF="197"/>
the Man;</HI> and if ever Woman in her Senses re∣jected
a Man of Merit, on so trivial and frivolous
a Pretence, <HI>I was the Woman;</HI> but surely it was the
most preposterous thing that ever Woman did.</P>
<P>He would have taken me as a Wife, but would
not entertain me as a Whore; was ever Woman
angry with any Gentleman on that head? and was
ever Woman to stupid to choose to be a Whore,
where she might have been an honest Wife? But
Infatuations are next to being possess'd of the De∣vil;
I was inffexible, and pretended to argue up∣on
the Point of a Woman's Liberty, as before;
but he took me short, and with more Warmth
than he had yet us'd with me, tho' with the ut∣most
Respect; reply'd, Dear Madam, you argue
for Liberty at the same time that you restrain
yourself from that Liberty, which God and Na∣ture
has directed you to take and to; supply the
Deficiency, propose a vicious Liberty, which is
neither honourable or religious; will you propose
Liberty at the Expence of Modesty?</P>
<P>I return'd, that he mistook me; I did not pro∣pose
it; I only said, that those that cou'd not be
content without concerning the Sexes in that Af∣fair,
might do so indeed; might entertain a Man
as Men do a Mistress, if they thought fit, but he
did not hear me say I wou'd do so; and tho', by
what had pass'd, he might well censure me in
that Part, yet he should find, for the future, that
I should freely converse with him without any In∣clination
that way.</P>
<P>He told me, he cou'd not promise that for him∣self,
and thought he ought not to trust himself
with the Opportunity; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or that, as he had fail'd
already, he was loth to <HI>lead himself into the Tempta∣tion</HI>
of offending again; and that this was the true
Reason of his resolving to go back to <HI>Paris;</HI> not
<PB N="193" REF="198"/>
that he cou'd willingly leave me, and would be
very far from wanting my Invitation; but if he
could not stay upon Terms that became him, ei∣ther
as an honest Man, or a Christian, what cou'd
he do? and he hop'd, <HI>he said,</HI> I cou'd not blame
him, that he was unwilling any thing that was
to call him Father, shou'd upbraid him with
leaving him in the World, to be call'd Bastard;
adding, that he was astonish'd to think how I
could satisfie myself to be so cruel to an innocent
Infant, not yet born; profess'd he cou'd neither bear
the Thoughts of it, much lese bear to see it, and
hop'd I wou'd not take it ill that he cou'd not
stay to see me Deliver'd, for that very Reason.</P>
<P>I saw he spoke this with a disturb'd Mind, and
that it was with some Difficulty that he restrain'd
his Passion; so I declin'd any farther Discourse
upon it; only said, I hop'd he. wou'd consider
of it: <HI>O Madam!</HI> says he, <HI>Do not bid me consider,</HI>
'tis <HI>for you to consider;</HI> and with that he went out
of the Room, in a strange kind of Confusion, as
was easie to be seen in his Countenance.</P>
<P>If I had, not been one of the foolishest, as well
as wickedest Creatures upon Earth, I cou'd never
have acted thus; I had one of the honestest
compleatest Gentlemen upon Earth, at my hand;
he had in one Sence sav'd my Life, but he had
sav'd that Life from Ruin in a most remarka∣ble
Manner; he lov'd me even to Distraction,
and had come from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> on pur∣pose
to seek me; he had offer'd me Marriage,
even after I was with-Child by him, and had of∣fer'd
to quit all his Pretensions to my Estate,
and give it up to my own Management, having
a plentiful Estate of his own: Here I might have
settled myself out of the reach even of Disaster
itself; his Estate and mine, wou'd have purchas'd
<PB N="194" REF="199"/>
even then above two Thousand Pounds a Year,
and I might have liv'd like a Queen, nay,
far more happy than a Queen; and, which was
above all, I had now an Opportunity to have
quitted a Life of Crime and Debauchery, which
I had been given up to for several Years, and
to have sat; down quiet in Plenty, and Honour,
and to have let myself apart to the Great Work,
which I have since seen so much, Necessity of, and
Occasion for; I mean that of Repentance.</P>
<P>But my Measure of Wickedness was not yet
full; I continued obstinate against Matrimony,
and yet I cou'd not bear the Though<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of his
going away neither as to the Child, I was not
very anxious about it; told him, I wou'd pro∣mise
him that it shou'd never come to him to up∣braid
him with its being illegitimate; that if it was
a Boy, I wou'd breed it up like the Son of a Gen∣tleman,
and use it well for his sake; and after a
little more such Talk as this, and seeing him re∣solv'd
to go, I retir'd, but cou'd not help letting
him see the Tears run down my Cheeks; he came
to me, and kiss'd me, entreated me, conjur'd me
by the Kindness he had shewn me in my Distress;
by the Justice he had done me in my Bills and
Money-Affairs; by the Respect which made him
refuse a Thousand Pistoles from me for his Ex∣pences
with that Traytor, the <HI>Jew;</HI> by the
Pledge of our Misfortunes, <HI>so he call'd it,</HI> which I
carry'd with me; and by all that the sincerest
Affection cou'd propose to do, that I wou'd not
drive him away.</P>
<P>But it wou'd not do; I was stupid and sence∣less,
deaf to all his Importunities, and continued
so to the last; so we parted, only desiring me to
promise that I would write him word when I was
Deliver'd, and how he might give me an Answer;
<PB N="195" REF="200"/>
and this I engag'd my Word I would do; and
upon his desiring to be inform'd which Way I
intended to dispose of myself, I told him, I re∣solv'd
to go directly to <HI>England,</HI> and to <HI>London,</HI>
where I propos'd to Lye-in; but since he resolv'd
to leave me, I told him, I suppos'd it wou'd be of
no Consequence to him, what became of me.</P>
<P>He lay in his Lodgings that Night, but went
away early in the Morning, leaving me a Letter,
in which he repeated all he had said; recom∣mended
the Care of the Child, and desir'd of
me, that as he had remitted to me the Offer of
a Thousand Pistoles, which I wou'd have given
him for the Recompence of his Charges and
Trouble with the <HI>Jew,</HI> and had given it me back;
so he desir'd I wou'd allow him to oblige me to
set apart that Thousand Pistoles, with its Improve∣ment,
for the Child, and for its Education;
earnestly pressing me to secure that little Portion
for the abandon'd Orphan, when I shou'd think
fit, <HI>as he was sure I wou'd,</HI> to throw away the rest
upon something as worthless as my sincere Friend
at <HI>Paris,</HI> he concluded with moving me to re∣flect
with the same Regret as he did, on our Follies
we had committed together; ask'd me Forgive∣ness
for being the Aggressor in the Fact; and for∣gave
me every-thing, <HI>he said,</HI> but the Cruelty of
refusing him, which he own'd he cou'd not for∣give
me so heartily as he shou'd do, because he
was satisfied it was an Injury to myself; would
be an Introduction to my Ruin; and that I wou'd
seriously repent of it; he foretold some fatal
things, which, <HI>he said,</HI> he was well assu'd I shou'd
fall into; and that, at last I wou'd be ruin'd by
a bad Husband; bid me be the more wary, that
I might render him a False Prophet; but to re∣member,
that if ever I came into Distress, I had
<PB N="196" REF="201"/>
a fast-Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> who wou'd not upbraid me
with the unkind things past, but wou'd be al∣ways
ready to return me Good for Evil.</P>
<P>This Letter stunn'd me; I cou'd not think it
possible for any-one, that had not dealt with the
Devil, to write such a Letter; for he spoke of
some particular things which afterwards were to
befal me, with such an Assurance, that it frighted
me before-hand; and when those things did come
to pass, I was perswaded he had some more than
humane Knowledge; in a word, his Advices to
me to repent, were very affectionate; his Warn∣ings
of Evil to happen to me, were very kind;
and his Promise of Assistance, if I wanted him,
were so generous, that I have seldom seen the
like; and tho' I did not at first set much by that
Part, because I look'd upon them as what might
not happen, and as what was improbable to hap∣pen
at that time; yet all the rest of his Letter
was so moving, that it left me very melancholly,
and I cry'd four and twenty Hours after, almost,
without ceasing, about it; and yet, even all this
while, whatever it was that bewitch'd me, I had
not one serious Wish that I had taken him; I
wish'd heartily indeed, that I cou'd have kept
him with me; but I had a mortal Aversion to mar∣rying
him, or indeed, any-body else; but form'd
a thousand wild Notions in my Head, that I was
yet gay enough, and young, and handsome enough
to please a Man of Quality; and that I wou'd
try my Fortune at <HI>London,</HI> come of it what
wou'd.</P>
<P>Thus blinded by my own Vanity, I threw away
the only Opportunity I then had, to have effectu∣ally
settl'd my Fortunes, and secur'd them for
this World; and I am a Memorial to all that
shall read my Story; a standing Monument of
<PB N="197" REF="202"/>
the Madness and Distraction which Pride and In∣fatuations
from Hell runs us into; how ill our Pas∣sions
guide us; and how dangerously we act, when
we follow the Dictates of an ambitious Mind.</P>
<P>I was rich, beautiful, and agreeable, and not
yet old; I had known something of the Influence
I had had upon the Fancies of Men, even of the
highest Rank; I never forgot that the Prince <HI>de</HI>—had
said with an Extasie, that I was the
finest Woman in <HI>France;</HI> I knew I cou'd make
a Figure at <HI>London,</HI> and how well I cou'd grace
that Figure; I was not at a Loss how to behave,
and having already been ador'd by Princes, I
thought of nothing less than of being Mistress to
the King himself: But I go back to my immediate
Circumstances at that time.</P>
<P>I got over the Absence of my honest Merchant
but slowly at first; it was with infinite Regret
that I let him go at-all; and when I read the Let∣ter
he left, I was quite confounded; as soon as
he was out of Call, and irrecoverable, I wou'd
have given half I had in the World, for him back
again; my Notions of things chang'd in an In∣stant,
and I call'd myself a thousand Fools, for
casting myself upon a Life of Scandal and Ha∣zard;
when after the Shipwreck of Virtue, Ho∣nour,
and Principle, and sailing at the utmost
Risque in the stormy Seas of Crime, and abo∣minable
Levity, I had a safe Harbour presented,
and no Heart to cast-Anchor in it.</P>
<P>His Predictions terrify'd me; his Promises of
Kindness if I came to Distress, melted me into
Tears, but frighted me with the Apprehensions of
ever coming into such Distress, and fill'd my Head
with a thousand Anxieties and Thoughts, how
it shou'd be possible for me, who had now such
a Fortune, to sink again into Misery.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="203"/>
Then the dreadful Scene of my Life, when I
was left with my five Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as I have
related, represented itself again to me, and I sat
considering what Measures I might take to bring
myself to such a State of Desolation again, and
how I shou'd act to avoid it.</P>
<P>But these things wore off gradually; as to my
Friend, the Merchant, he was gone, and gone ir∣recoverably,
for I durst not follow him to <HI>Paris,</HI>
for the Reasons mention'd above; again, I was
afraid to write to him to return, left he shou'd
have refus'd, as I verily believ'd he wou'd; so I
sat and cry'd intollerably, for some Days, nay, I
may say, for some Weeks; but I say, it wore off
gradually; and as I had a pretty deal of Business
for managing my Effects, the Hurry of that par∣ticular
Part, serv'd to divert my Thoughts, and in
part to wear out the Impressions which had been
made upon my Mind.</P>
<P>I had sold my Jewels, all but the fine Diamond
Ring, which my Gentleman, the Jeweller, us'd
to wear; and this, at proper times, I wore my∣self;
as also the Diamond Necklace, which the
Prince had given me, and a Pair of extraordinary
Ear-Rings, worth about 600 Pistoles; the other,
which was a fine Casket, he left with me at his
going to <HI>Versailles,</HI> and a small Case with some
Rubies and Emeralds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I say, I sold them at
the <HI>Hague</HI> for 7600 Pistoles; I had receiv'd all
the Bills which the Merchant had help'd me to
at <HI>Paris,</HI> and with the Money I brought with me,
they made up 13900 Pistoles more; so that I had
in Ready-Money, and in Account in the Bank at
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> above One and twenty Thousand Pi∣stoles,
besides Jewels; and how to get this Trea∣sure
to <HI>England,</HI> was my next Care.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="204"/>
The Business I had had now with a great ma∣ny
People, for receiving such large Sums, and sel∣ling
Jewels of such considerable Value, gave me
Opportunity to know and converse with several of
the best Merchants of the Place; so that I wanted
no Direction now, how to get my Money remit∣ted
to <HI>England;</HI> applying therefore, to several
Merchants, that I might neither risque it all on
the Credit of one Merchant, nor suffer any single
Man to know the Quantity of Money I had; I
say, applying myself to several Merchants, I got
Bills of Exchange, payable in <HI>London,</HI> for all my
Money; the first Bills I took with me; the se∣cond
Bills I left in Trust, (in case of any Disaster
at Sea) in the Hands of the first Merchant, him
to whom I was recommended by my Friend from
<HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus spent nine Months in <HI>Holland;</HI> re∣fus'd
the best Offer ever Woman in my Circum∣stances
had; parted unkindly, and indeed, bar∣barously
with the best Friend, and honestest Man
in the World; got all my Money in my Pocket,
and a Bastard in my Belly, I took Shipping at
the <HI>Briel,</HI> in the Packet-Boat, and arriv'd safe at
<HI>Harwich,</HI> where my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> was come, by
my Direction, to meet me.</P>
<P>I wou'd willingly have given ten Thousand
Pounds of my Money, to have been rid of the
Burthen I had in my Belly, as above; but it
cou'd not be; so I was oblig'd to bear with that
Part, and get rid of it by the ordinary Method
of Patience, and a hard Travel.</P>
<P>I was above the contemptible Usage that Wo∣men
in my Circumstances oftentimes meet with;
I had consider'd all that before-hand; and having
sent <HI>Amy</HI> before-hand, and remitted her Money
to do it, she had taken me a very handsome
<PB N="200" REF="205"/>
House, in—<HI>Street,</HI> near <HI>Charing-Cross;</HI> had hir'd
me two Maids, and a Footman, who she had put
in a good Livery, and having hir'd a Glass-Coach
and four Horses, she came with them and the Man-Servant,
to <HI>Harwich,</HI> to meet me, and had been
there near a Week before I came; so I had no∣thing
to do, but to go-away to <HI>London,</HI> to my own
House, where I arriv'd in very good Health, and
where I pass'd for a <HI>French</HI> Lady, by the Title
of—.</P>
<P>My first Business was, to get all my Bills ac∣cepted;
which, to cut the Story short, was all
both accepted, and currently paid; and I then
resolv'd to take me a Country-Lodging somewhere
near the Town, to be <HI>Incognito,</HI> till I was brought∣to-Bed;
which, appearing in such a Figure, and
having such an Equipage, I easily manag'd, with∣out
any-body's offering the usual Insults of Parish-Enquiries:
I did not appear in my new House for
some time; and afterwards I thought fit, for
particular Reasons, to quit that House, and not
come to it at-all▪ but take handsome large Apart∣ments
in the <HI>Pall-mall,</HI> in a House, out of which
was a private Door into the King's Garden, by
the Permission of the Chief Gardener, who had
liv'd in the House.</P>
<P>I had now all my Effects secur'd; but my
Money being my great Concern at that time, I
found it a Difficulty how to dispose of it, so
as to bring me in an annual Interest; however,
in some time I got a substantial safe Mortgage for
14000 Pound, by the Assistance of the famous
Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> for which, I had an Estate of
1800 Pounds a Year bound to me; and had 700
Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> Interest for it.</P>
<P>This, with some other Securities, made me a
very handsome Estate, of above a Thousand
<PB N="201" REF="206"/>
Pounds a Year; enough, one wou'd think, to keep
<HI>any</HI> Woman in <HI>England</HI> from being a Whore.</P>
<P>I Lay-in at—, about four Miles from
<HI>London,</HI> and brought a fine Boy into the World;
and according to my Promise, sent an Account of
it to my Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> the Father of it; and
in the Letter, told him how sorry I was for his
going away, and did as good as intimate, that if
he wou'd come once more to see me, I should
use him better than I had done: He gave me a
very kind and obliging Answer, but took not the
least Notice of what I had said <HI>of his coming Over,</HI>
so I found my Interest lost there for ever: He
gave me Joy of the Child, and hinted, that he
hop'd I wou'd make good what he had begg'd
for the poor Infant, as I had promis'd; and I
sent him word again, that I wou'd fullfil his Or∣der
to a Tittle; and such a Fool, and so weak
I was in this last Letter, notwithstanding what
I have said of his not taking Notice of my In∣vitation,
as to ask his Pardon almost, for the
Usage I gave him at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and stoop'd so
low, as to expostulate with him for not taking
Notice of my inviting him to come to me again,
as I had done; and which was still more, went
so far, as to make a second sort of an Offer to
him, telling him almost in plain Words, that if
he wou'd come Over now, I wou'd have him;
but he never gave me the least Reply to it at-all,
which was as absolute a Denial to me, as he was
ever able to give; so I sat down, I cannot say
contented, but vex'd heartily that I had made
the Offer at-all; for he had, as I may say, his
full Revenge of me, in scorning to answer, and to
let me twice ask that of him, which he with so
much Importunity begg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of me before.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="207"/>
I was now up again, and soon came to my City
Lodging, in the <HI>Pall-mall;</HI> and here I began to
make a Figure suitable to my Estate, which was
very great; and I shall give you an Account of
my Equipage in a few Words, and of myself
too.</P>
<P>I paid 60 <HI>l.</HI> a Year for my new Apartments,
for I took them by the Year; but then, they
were handsome Lodgings indeed, and very richly
furnish'd; I kept my own Servants to clean and
look after them; found my own Kitchen-Ware,
and Firing; my Equipage was handsome, but not
very great: I had a Coach, a Coachman, a Foot∣man,
my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> who I now dress'd like
a Gentlewoman, and made her my Companion,
and three Maids; and thus I liv'd for a time:
I dress'd to the height of every Mode; went ex∣tremely
rich in Cloaths; and as for Jewels, I
wanted none; I gave a very good Livery lac'd
with Silver, and as rich as any-body below the
Nobility, cou'd be seen with: And thus I ap∣pear'd,
leaving the World to guess who or what
I was, without offering to put myself forward.</P>
<P>I walk'd sometimes in the <HI>Mall</HI> with my Wo∣man,
<HI>Amy;</HI> but I kept no Company, and made
no Acquaintances, only made as gay a Show as I
was able to do, and that upon all Occasions: I
found however, the World was not altogether so
unconcern'd about me, as I seem'd to be about
them; and first, I understood that the Neigh∣bours
begun to be mighty inquisitive about me;
as who I was? and what my Circumstances were?</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was the only Person that cou'd answer
their Curiosity, or give any Account of me, and
she a tattling Woman, and a true Gossip, took
Care to do that with all the Art that she was
Mistress of; she let them know, that I was the
<PB N="203" REF="208"/>
Widow of a Person of Quality in <HI>France;</HI> that I
was very rich; that I came over hither to look
after an Estate that fell to me by some of my Re∣lations
who died here; that I was was worth
40000 <HI>l.</HI> all in my own Hands, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>This was all wrong in <HI>Amy,</HI> and in me too,
tho' we did not see it at first; for this recom∣mended
me indeed, to those sort of Gentlemen
they call <HI>Fortune-Hunters,</HI> and who always besieg'd
Ladies, <HI>as they call'd it,</HI> on purpose to take them
Prisoners, <HI>as I call'd it;</HI> that is to say, to mar∣ry
the Women, and have the spending of their
Money: But if I was wrong in refusing the ho∣nourable
Proposals of the <HI>Dutch Merchant,</HI> who
offer'd me the Disposal of my whole Estate, and
had as much of his own to maintain me with; I
was right now, in refusing those Offers which
came generally from Gentlemen of good Families,
and good Estates, but who living to the Extent
of them, were always needy and necessitous, and
wanted a Sum of Money to make themselves ea∣sie,
<HI>as they call it;</HI> that is to say, to pay off In∣cumbrances,
Sisters Portions, <HI>and the like;</HI> and
then the Woman is Prisoner for Life, and may
live as they please to give her Leave: This Life
I had seen into clearly enough, and therefore I
was not to be catch'd that way; however, as I
said, the Reputation of my Money brought seve∣ral
of those sort of Gentry about me, aud they
found means, by one Stratagem or other, to get
access to my Ladyship; but in short, I answer'd
them all well enough; <HI>that I liv'd single, and was
happy;</HI> that <HI>as I had no Occasion to change my Condi∣tion
for an Estate,</HI> so I did not see, <HI>that by the best
Offer that any of them cou'd make me, I cou'd mend
my Fortune; that I might be honour'd with</HI> Titles
indeed, and in time rank on publick Occasions
<PB N="204" REF="209"/>
with the Peeresses; I mention that, because one
that offer'd at me, was the eldest Son of a Peer:
<HI>But that I was as well without the Title,</HI> as long as <HI>I
had the Estate; and while I had</HI> 2000 l. <HI>a Year of
my own, I was happier than I cou'd be in being Prisoner
of State to a Nobleman;</HI> for I took the Ladies of
that Rank to be little better.</P>
<P>As I have mention'd Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> with
whom I had the good Fortune to become ac∣quainted,
on account of the Mortgage which he
help'd me to, it is necessary to take Notice, that I
had much Advantage in my ordinary Affairs, by
his Advice, and therefore I call it my good For∣tune;
for as he paid me so considerable an annual
Income as 700 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, so I am to acknowledge
myself much a Debtor, not only to the Justice
of his Dealings with me, but to the Prudence
and Conduct which he guided me to, by his Ad∣vice,
for the Management of my Estate; and as
he found I was not inclin'd to marry, he fre∣quently
took Occasion to hint, how soon I might
raise my Fortune to a prodigious Height, if I
wou'd but order my Family-Oeconomy so far
within my Revenue, as to lay-up every Year
something, to add to the Capital.</P>
<P>I was convinc'd of the Truth of what he said,
and agreed to the Advantages of it; you are to
take it as you go, that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> suppos'd by my
own Discourse, and especially, by my Woman,
<HI>Amy,</HI> that I had <HI>2000 l.</HI> a Year Income; he judg'd,
as he said, by my way Living, that I cou'd not
spend above one Thousand; and so, he added, I
might prudently lay-by <HI>1000 l.</HI> every Year, to
add to the Capital; and by adding every Year
the additional Interest, or Income of the Money
to the Capital, he prov'd to me, that in ten Year
I shou'd double the <HI>1000 l. per Annum,</HI> that I
<PB N="205" REF="210"/>
laid by; and he drew me out a Table, as he
call'd it, of the Encrease, for me to judge by;
and by which, he said, if the Gentlemen of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
wou'd but act so, every Family of them
wou'd encrease their Fortunes to a great Degree,
just as Merchants do by Trade; whereas now,
<HI>says</HI> Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> by the Humour of living up to
the Extent of their Fortunes, and rather beyond,
tbe Gentlemen, <HI>says he,</HI> ay, and the Nobility too,
are, almost all of them, Borrowers, and all in ne∣cessitous
Circumstances.</P>
<P>As Sir <HI>Robert</HI> frequently visited me, and was
(if I may say so from his own Mouth) very
well pleas'd with my way of conversing with him,
for he knew nothing, nor so much as guess'd
at what I had been; I say, as he came often
to see me, so he always entertain'd me with
this Scheme of Frugality; and one time he
brought another Paper, wherein he shew'd me,
much to the same Purpose as the former, to what
Degree I shou'd encrease my Estate, if I wou'd
come into his Method of contracting my Expen∣ces;
and by this Scheme of his, it appear'd,
that laying up a thousand Pounds a Year, and
every Year adding the Interest to it, I shou'd in
twelve Years time have in Bank, One and twenty
Thousand, and Fifty eight Pounds; after which,
I might lay-up two Thousand Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>I objected, that I was a young Woman; that I
had been us'd to live plentifully, and with a
good Appearance; and that I knew not how to be
a Miser.</P>
<P>He told me, that if I thought I had enough, it
was well; but if I desir'd to have more, this
was the Way; that in another twelve Year, I
shou'd be too rich, so that I shou'd not know
what to do with it.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="211"/>
Ay Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> you are contriving how to make
me a rich Old Woman, but that won't answer
my End; I had rather have 20000 <HI>l.</HI> now, than
60000 <HI>l.</HI> when I am fifty Year old.</P>
<P><HI>Then,</HI> Madam, says he, <HI>I suppose your Honour
has no Children?</HI></P>
<P>None, Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> said I, <HI>but what are provided for;</HI>
so I left him in the dark, as much as I found him:
However, I consider'd his Scheme very well, tho' I
said no more to him at that time, and I resolv'd,
tho' I would make a very good Figure, I say, I
resolv'd to abate a little of my Expence, and
draw in; live closer, and save something, if not
so much as he propos'd to me: It was near the
End of the Year that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> made this Propo∣sal
to me, and when the Year was up, I went to
his House in the City, and there I told him, I
came to thank him for his Scheme of Fruga∣lity;
that I had been studying much upon it;
and tho' I had not been able to mortifie myself
so much as to lay-up a thousand Pounds a Year;
yet, as I had not come to him for my Interest
half-yearly, as was usual, I was now come to let
him know, that I had resolv'd to lay-up that
seven Hundred Pound a Year, and never use a
Penny of it; desiring him to help me to put it
out to Advantage.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> a Man thorowly vers'd in Arts of
improving Money, but thorowly honest, <HI>said to
me,</HI> Madam, I am glad you approve of the Me∣thod
that I propos'd to you; but you have be∣gun
wrong; you shou'd have come for your Inte∣rest
at the Half-Year, and then you had had the
Money to put out; now you have lost half a
Year's Interest of 350 <HI>l.</HI> which is 9 <HI>l.</HI> for I had
but 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Mortgage.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="212"/>
Well, well, Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> can you put this out
for me now?</P>
<P>Let it lie, Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> till the next Year,
and then I'll put out your 1400 <HI>l.</HI> together, and in
the mean time I'll pay you Interest for the 700 <HI>l.</HI>
so he gave me his Bill for the Money, which
he told me shou'd be no less than 6 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI>
Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI>'s Bill was what no-body wou'd
refuse; so I thank'd him, and let it lie; and next
Year I did the same; and the third Year Sir <HI>Ro∣bert</HI>
got me a good Mortgage for 2200 <HI>l.</HI> at 6 <HI>per
Cent. Interest:</HI> So I had 132 <HI>l.</HI> a Year added to
my Income; which was a very satisfying Ar∣ticle.</P>
<P>But I return to my History: As I have said, I
found that my Measures were all wrong, the Po∣sture
I set up in, expos'd me to innumerable Vi∣siters
of the Kind I have mention'd above; I was
cry'd up for a vast Fortune, and one that Sir
<HI>Robert Clayton</HI> manag'd for; and Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI>
was courted for me, as much as I was for my∣self:
But I had given Sir <HI>Robert</HI> his Cue; I had
told him my Opinion of Matrimony, in just the
same Terms as I had done my Merchant, and he
came into it presently; he own'd that my Ob∣servation
was just, and that, if I valued my Li∣berty,
as I knew my Fortune, and that it was
in my own Hands, I was to blame, if I gave it
away to any-one.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Robert</HI> knew nothing of my Design;
that I aim'd at being a kept Mistress, and to have
a handsome Maintenance; and that I was still
for getting Money, <HI>and laying it up too,</HI> as much
as he cou'd desire me, only by a worse Way.</P>
<P>However, Sir <HI>Robert</HI> came seriously to me one
Day, and told me, he had an Offer of Matri∣mony
to make to me, that was beyond all that
<PB N="208" REF="213"/>
he had heard had offer'd themselves, and this
was a Merchant; Sir <HI>Robert</HI> and I agreed exactly
in our Notions of a Merchant; Sir <HI>Robert</HI> said,
and I found it to be true, that a true-bred Mer∣chant
is the best Gentleman in the Nation; that
in Knowledge, in Manners, in Judgment of things,
the Merchant out-did many of the Nobility;
that having once master'd the World, and being
above the Demand of Business, tho' no real
Estate, they were then superiour to most Gentle∣men,
even in Estate; that a Merchant in flush
Business, and a capital Stock, is able to spend
more Money than a Gentleman of 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year
Estate; that while a Merchant spent, he only
spent what he got, and not that; and that he
laid up great Sums every Year.</P>
<P>That an Estate is a Pond; but that a Trade
was a Spring; that if the first is once mort∣gag'd,
it seldom gets clear, but embarrass'd the
Person for ever; but the Merchant had his Estate
continually flowing; and upon this, he nam'd me
Merchants who liv'd in more real Splendor, and
spent more Money than most of the Noblemen
in <HI>England</HI> cou'd singly expend, and that they
still grew immensly rich.</P>
<P>He went on to tell me, that even the Trades∣men
in <HI>London,</HI> speaking of the better sort of
Trades, cou'd spend more Money in their Fami∣lies,
and yet give better Fortunes to their Chil∣dren,
than, generally speaking, the Gentry of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
from a 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year downward, cou'd do,
and yet grow rich too.</P>
<P>The Upshot of all this was, to recommend to
me, rather the bestowing my Fortune upon some
eminent Merchant, who liv'd already in the first
Figure of a Merchant, and who not being in Want
or Scarcity of Money, but having a flourishing
<PB N="209" REF="214"/>
Business, and a flowing Cash, wou'd at the first
word, settle all my Fortune on myself and Chil∣dren,
and maintain me like a Queen.</P>
<P>This was certainly right; and had I taken his
Advice, I had been really happy; but my Heart
was bent upon an Independency of Fortune; and
I told him, I knew no State of Matrimony, but
what was, at best, a State of Inferiority, if not
of Bondage; that I had no Notion of it; that I
liv'd a Life of absolute Liberty now; was free
as I was born, and having a plentiful Fortune, I
did not understand what Coherence the Words
<HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Obey</HI> had with the Liberty of a <HI>Free
Woman;</HI> that I knew no Reason the Men had
to engross the whole Liberty of the Race, and
make the Women, notwithstanding any desparity
of Fortune, be subject to the Laws of Marriage,
of their own making; that it was my Misfor∣tune
to be a Woman, but I was resolv'd it shou'd
not be made worse by the Sex; and seeing Li∣berty
seem'd to be the Men's Property, I wou'd
be a <HI>Man-Woman;</HI> for as I was born free, I wou'd
die so.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert</HI> smil'd, and told me, I talk'd a kind
of <HI>Amazonian</HI> Language; that he found few Wo∣men
of my Mind, or that if they were, they
wanted Resolution to go on with it; that not∣withstanding
all my Notions, which he could not
but say had once some Weight in them, yet he un∣derstood
I had broke-in upon them, and had been
marry'd; I answer'd, I had so, but he did not
hear me say, that I had any Encouragement from
what was past, to make a second Venture; that
I was got well out of the To<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ and if I came
in again, I shou'd have no-body to blame but
myself.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="215"/>
Sir <HI>Robert</HI> laugh'd heartily at me, but gave over
offering any more Arguments, only told me, he
had pointed me out for some of the best Merchants
in <HI>London,</HI> but since I forbad him, he wou'd
give me no Disturbunce of that Kind; he ap∣plauded
my Way of managing my Money,
and told me, I shou'd soon be monstrous rich;
but he neither knew, or mistrusted, that with all
this Wealth, I was yet a Whore, and was not
averse to adding to my Estate at the farther Ex∣pence
of my Virtue.</P>
<P>But to go on with my Story as to my way of
living; I found, as above, that my living as I
did, wou'd not answer; that it only brought the
<HI>Fortune-Hunters</HI> and Bites about me, as I have
said before, to make a Prey of me and my Mo∣ney;
and in short, I was harrass'd with Lovers,
<HI>Beaus,</HI> and <HI>Fops</HI> of Quality, in abundance; but it
wou'd not do, I aim'd at other things, and was
possess'd with so vain an Opinion of my own
Beauty, that nothing less than the KING him<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf
was in my Eye; and this Vanity was rais'd by
some Words <HI>let fall</HI> by a Person I convers'd with,
who was, perhaps, likely enough to have brought
such a thing to pass, had it been sooner; <HI>but that
Game began to be pretty well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver at Court:</HI> However,
the having mention'd such a thing, it seems, a lit∣tle
too publickly, it brought abundance of People
about me, upon a wicked Account too.</P>
<P>And now I began to act in a new Sphere; the
Court was exceeding gay and fine, tho' fuller of
Men than of Women, the Queen not affecting to
be very much in publick; on the other hand, it
is no Slander upon the Courtiers, <HI>to say,</HI> they were
as wicked as any-body in reason cou'd desire them:
The KING had several Mistresses, who were
prodigious fine, and there was a glorious Show on
<PB N="211" REF="216"/>
that Side indeed: If the Sovereign gave himself
a Loose, it cou'd not be expected the rest of the
Court shou'd be all Saints; so far was it from
that, tho' I wou'd not make it worse than it was,
that a Woman that had any-thing agreeable in her
Appearance, cou'd never want Followers.</P>
<P>I soon found myself throng'd with Admirers,
and I receiv'd Visits from some Persons of very
great Figure, who always introduc'd themselves
by the help of an old Lady or two, who were
now become my Intimates; and one of them, I
understood afterwards, was set to-work on purpose
to get into my Favour, in order to introduce
what follow'd.</P>
<P>The Conversation we had, was generally court∣ly,
but civil; at length, some Gentlemen propos'd
to Play, and made, what they call'd, a Party;
this it seems, was a Contrivance of one of my
Female hangers-on, <HI>for, as I said, I had two of them,</HI>
who thought this was the way to introduce Peo∣ple
as often as she pleas'd, and so indeed, it was:
They play'd high, and stay'd late, but begg'd
my Pardon, only ask'd Leave to make an Ap∣pointment
for the next Night; I was as gay, and
as well-pleas'd as any of them, and one Night told
one of the Gentlemen, my Lord—, that see∣ing
they were doing me the Honour of diverting
themselves at my Apartment, and desir'd to be
there sometimes, I did not keep a Gaming-Ta∣ble,
but I wou'd give them a little Ball the next
Day, if they pleas'd; which they accepted very
willingly.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the Evening the Gentlemen be∣gan
to come, where I let them see, that I under∣stood
very well what such things meant: I had
a large Dining-Room in my Apartments, with five
other Rooms on the same Floor, all which I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="212" REF="217"/>
Drawing-Rooms for the Occasion, having all the
Beds taken down for the Day; in three of these
I had Tables plac'd, cover'd with Wine and Sweet-Meats;
the fourth had a green Table for Play,
and the fifth was my own Room, where I sat,
and where I receiv'd all the Company that came
to pay their Compliments to me: I was dress'd,
you may be sure, to all the Advantage possible,
and had all the Jewels on, that I was Mistress of:
My Lord—, to whom I had made the In∣vitation,
sent me a Sett of fine Musick from the
Play-House, and the Ladies danc'd, and we be∣gan
to be very merry; when about eleven a-Clock
I had Notice given me, that there were
some Gentlemen coming in Masquerade.</P>
<P>I seem'd a little surpriz'd, and began to appre∣hend
some Disturbance; when my Lord—perceiving
it, spoke to me to be easie, for that
there was a Party of the Guards at the Door,
which shou'd be ready to prevent any Rudeness;
and another Gentleman gave me a Hint, as if the
KING was among the Masks; I colour'd, as red
as Blood itself cou'd make a Face look, and ex∣press'd
a great Surprize; however, there was
no going back; so I kept my Station in my
Drawing-Room, but with the Folding-Doors wide
open.</P>
<P>A-while after, the Masks came in, and began
with a Dance <HI>a la Comique,</HI> performing wonder∣fully
indeed; while they were dancing, I with∣drew,
and le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a Lady to answer for me, that I
wou'd return immediately; in less than half an
Hour I return'd, dress'd in the Habit of <HI>a Turkish
Princess;</HI> the Habit I got at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> when my
<HI>Foreign Prince</HI> bought me a <HI>Turkish</HI> Slave, as I have
said, the <HI>Malthese</HI> Man of War had, it seems,
taken a <HI>Turkish</HI> Vessel going from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to
<PB N="213" REF="218"/>
<HI>Alexandria,</HI> in which were some Ladies bound for
<HI>Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt;</HI> and as the Ladies were made
Slaves, so their fine Cloaths were thus expos'd;
and with this <HI>Turkish</HI> Slave, I bought the rich
Cloaths too: The Dress was extraordinary fine
indeed, I had bought it as a Curiosity, having
never seen the like; the Robe was a fine <HI>Persian,</HI> or
<HI>India</HI> Damask; the Ground white, and the Flow∣ers
blue and gold, and the Train held five Yards;
the Dress under it, was a Vest of the same, em∣broider'd
with Gold, and set with some Pearl in
the Work, and some <HI>Turquois</HI> Stones; to the
Vest, was a Girdle five or six Inches wide, after
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Mode; and on both Ends where it
join'd, or hook'd, was set with Diamonds for eight
Inches either way, only they were not true Dia∣monds;
but no-body knew that but myself.</P>
<P>The Turban, or Head-Dress, had a Pinacle on
the top, but not above five Inches, with a Piece
of loose Sarcenet hanging from it; and on the
Front, just over the Forehead, was a good Jewel,
which I had added to it.</P>
<P>This Habit, as above, cost me about sixty Pi∣stoles
in <HI>Italy,</HI> but cost much more in the Coun∣try
from whence it came; and little did I think,
when I bought it, that I shou'd put it to such a
Use as this; tho' I had dress'd myself in it many
times, by the help of my little <HI>Turk,</HI> and after∣wards
between <HI>Amy</HI> and I, only to see how I
look'd in it: I had sent her up before, to get
it ready, and when I came up, I had nothing to
do, but slip it on, and was down in my Draw∣ing-Room
in a little more than a quarter of an
Hour; when I came there, the room was full of
Company, but I order'd the Folding-Doors to be
shut for a Minute or two, till I had receiv'd
the Compliments of the Ladies that were in the
<PB N="214" REF="219"/>
Room, and had given them a full View of my
Dress.</P>
<P>But my Lord—, who happen'd to be in
the Room, slipp'd out at another Door, and
brought back with him one of the Masks, a tall
well-shap'd Person, but who had no Name, <HI>being
all Mask'd,</HI> nor would it have been allow'd to ask
any Person's Name on such an Occasion; the Per∣son
spoke in <HI>French</HI> to me, that it was the finest
Dress he had ever seen; and ask'd me, if he
shou'd have the Honour to dance with me? I
bow'd, as giving my Consent, but said, As I had
been a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> I cou'd not dance after the
Manner of this Country; I suppos'd their Musick
wou'd not play <HI>a la Moresque;</HI> he answer'd mer∣rily,
I had a Christian's Face, and he'd venture
it, that I cou'd dance like a Christian; adding,
that so much Beauty cou'd not be <HI>Mahometan:</HI>
Immediately the Folding-Doors were flung open,
and he led me into the Room: The Company
were under the greatest Surprize imaginable; the
very Musick stopp'd a-while to gaze; for the Dress
was indeed, exceedingly surprizing, perfectly new,
very agreeable, and wonderful rich.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, <HI>whoever he was,</HI> for I never
knew, led me only a Courant, and then ask'd me,
if I had a-mind to dance an Antick, that is to say,
whether I wou'd dance the Antick as they had
danc'd in Masquerade, or any-thing by myself;
I told him, any thing else rather, if he pleas'd;
so we danc'd only two <HI>French</HI> Dances, and he led
me to the Drawing-Room Door, when he retir'd
to the rest of the Masks: When he left me at the
Drawing-Room Door, I did not go in, as he
thought I wou'd have done, but turn'd about, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> myself to the whole Room, and calling
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Woman to m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, gave her some Directions to
<PB N="215" REF="220"/>
the Musick, by which the Company presently un∣derstood
that I would give them a Dance by my∣self:
Immediately all the House rose up, and paid
me a kind of a Compliment, by removing back
every way to make me room, for the Place was
exceeding full; the Musick did not at first hit the
Tune that I directed, which was a <HI>French</HI> Tune,
so I was forc'd to send my Woman to 'em again,
standing all this while at my Drawing-Room Door;
but as soon as my Woman spoke to them again,
they play'd it right; and I, to let them see it was
so, stepp'd forward to the middle of the Room;
then they began it again, and I danc'd by my∣self
a Figure which I learnt in <HI>France,</HI> when the
Prince <HI>de</HI>—desir'd I wou'd dance for his
Diversion; it was indeed, a very fine Figure, in∣vented
by a famous Master at <HI>Paris,</HI> for a Lady
or a Gentleman to dance single; but being per∣fectly
new, it pleas'd the Company exceedingly,
and they all thought it had been <HI>Turkish;</HI> nay,
one Gentleman had the Folly to expose himself
so much, as to say, <HI>and I think swore too,</HI> that
he had seen it danc'd at <HI>Constantinople;</HI> which was
ridiculous enough.</P>
<P>At the finishing the Dance, the Company clapp'd,
and almost shouted; and one of the Gentlemen
cry'd out, <HI>Roxana Roxana</HI> by—, with an
Oath; upon which foolish Accident I had the
Name of <HI>Roxana</HI> presently fix'd upon me all over
the Court End of Town, as effectually as if I had
been Christen'd <HI>Roxana:</HI> I had, it seems, the Fe∣licity
of pleasing every-body that Night, to an
Extreme; and my Ball, but especially my Dress,
was the Chat of the Town for that Week, and so
the Name <HI>Roxana</HI> was the Toast at, and about the
Court; no other Health was to be nam'd with it.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="221"/>
Now things began to work as I wou'd have
them, and I began to be very popular, as much
as I cou'd desire: The Ball held till (as well
as I was pleas'd with the Show) I was sick of
the Night; the Gentlemen mask'd, went off about
three a-Clock in the Morning; the other Gen∣tlemen
sat down to Play; the Musick held it
out; and some of the Ladies were dancing at Six
in the Morning.</P>
<P>But I was mighty eager to know who it was
danc'd with me; some of the Lords went so far
as to tell me, I was very much honour'd in my
Company; one of them spoke so broad, as almost
to say it was the KING, but I was convinc'd af∣terwards,
it was not; and another reply'd, If he
had been His Majesty, he shou'd have thought
it no Dishonour to Lead-up a <HI>Roxana;</HI> but to
this Hour I never knew positively who it was;
and by his Behaviour I thought he was too young,
His Majesty being at that time in an Age that
might be discover'd from a young Person, even in
his Dancing.</P>
<P><HI>Be that as it wou'd,</HI> I had 500 Guneas sent me
the next Morning, and the Messenger was order'd
to tell me, that the Persons who sent it, desir'd a
Ball again at my Lodgings on the next <HI>Tuesday,</HI>
but that they wou'd have my Leave to give the
Entertainment themselves: I was mighty well
pleas'd with this, (to be sure) but very inquisitive
to know who the Money came from; but the
Messenger was silent as Death, as to that Point;
and bowing always at my Enquiries, begg'd me
to ask no Questions which he cou'd not give an
obliging Answer to.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention that the Gentlemen that
play'd, gave a Hundred Guineas to the Box,
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they call'd it,</HI> and at the End of their Play,
<PB N="217" REF="222"/>
they ask'd my Gentlewoman of the Bed-Cham∣ber,
as they call'd her, (Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> forsooth) and
gave it her; and gave twenty Guineas more a∣mong
the Servants.</P>
<P>This magnificent Doings egually both pleas'd
and surpriz'd me, and I hardly knew where I was;
but especially, that Notion of the KING being
the Person that danc'd with me, puff'd me up to
that Degree, that I not only did not know any∣body
else, but indeed, was very far from know∣ing
myself.</P>
<P>I had now the next <HI>Tuesday</HI> to provide for the
the like Company; but alas! it was all taken out
of my Hand; three Gentlemen, who yet were,
it seems, but Servants, came on the <HI>Saturday,</HI> and
bringing sufficient Testimonies that they were
right, for one was the same who brought the
five hundred Guineas; I say, three of them came,
and brought Bottles of all sorts of Wines, and
Hampers of Sweet-Meats to such a Quantity, it
appear'd they design'd to hold the Trade on more
than once, and that they wou'd furnish every∣thing
to a Profusion.</P>
<P>However, as I found a Deficiency in two things,
I made Provision of about twelve Dozen of fine
Damask Napkins, with Table-cloaths of the same,
sufficient to cover all the Tables, with three Ta∣ble-cloaths
upon every Table, and Side-boards in
Proportion; also I bought a handsome Quantity of
Plate, necessary to have serv'd all the Side-boards,
but the Gentlemen would not suffer any of it to
be us'd; telling me, they had bought fine <HI>China</HI>
Dishes and Plates for the whole Service; and
that in such publick Places they cou'd not be
answerable for the Plate; so it was set all up in
a large Glass-Cupboard in the Room I sat in,
where it made a very good Show indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="223"/>
On <HI>Tuesday</HI> there came such an Appearance of
Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and Ladies, that my Apartments were
by no means able to receive them; and those who
in particular appear'd as Principals, gave Order be∣low,
to let no more Company come up; the Street
was full of Coaches with Coronets, and fine Glass-Chairs;
and in short, it was impossible to receive
the Company; I kept my little Room, as before,
and the Dancers fill'd the great Room; all the
Drawing-Rooms also were fill'd, and three
Rooms below-Stairs, which were not mine.</P>
<P>It was very well that there was a strong Party
of the Guards brought to keep the Door, for
without that, there had been such a promiscuous
Crowd, and some of them scandalous too, that
we shou'd have been all Disorder and Confusion;
but the three Head-Servants manag'd all that, and
had a Word to admit all the Company by.</P>
<P>It was uncertain to me, and is to this Day, who
it was that danc'd with me the <HI>Wednesday</HI> before,
when the Ball was my own; but that the K—was
at this Assembly, was out of Question with
me, by Circumstances that I suppose I cou'd
not be deceiv'd in; and particularly, that there
were five Persons who were not Mask'd, three
of them had blue Garters, and they appear'd not
to me till I came out to dance.</P>
<P>This Meeting was manag'd just as the first, tho'
with much more Magnificence, because of the
Company; I plac'd myself (exceedingly rich in
Cloaths and Jewels) in the middle of my little
Room, as before, and made my Compliment to
all the Company, as they pass'd me, as I did be∣fore;
but my Lord—, who had spoken open∣ly
to me the first Night, came to me, and unmask∣ing,
told me the Company had order'd him to tell
me, they hop'd they shou'd see me in the Dress
<PB N="219" REF="224"/>
I had appear'd in the first Day, which had been
so acceptable, that it had been the Occasion of
this new Meeting; and Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> there
are some in this Assembly, who it is worth your
while to oblige.</P>
<P>I bow'd to my Lord—, and immediately
withdrew: While I was above, a-dressing in my
new Habit, two Ladies, perfectly unknown to me,
were convey'd into my Apartment below, by the
Order of a Noble Person, who, with his Family,
had been in <HI>Persia;</HI> and here indeed, I thought I
shou'd have been out-done, or perhaps, baulk'd.</P>
<P>One of these Ladies was dress'd most exqui∣sitely
fine indeed, in the Habit of a Virgin Lady
of Quality of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the other in the same
Habit of <HI>Armenia,</HI> with each of them a Woman-Slave
to attend them.</P>
<P>The Ladies had their Petticoats short, to their
Ancles, but pleated all round, and before them
short Aprons, but of the finest Point that cou'd
be seen; their Gowns were made with long An∣tick
Sleeves hanging down behind, and a Train
let down; they had no Jewels; but their Heads
and Breasts were dress'd up with Flowers, and
they both came in veil'd.</P>
<P>Their Slaves were <HI>bare-headed;</HI> but their long
black Hair was breeded in Locks hanging down
behind, to their Wastes, and tied up with Rib∣bands;
they were dress'd exceeding rich, and
were as beautiful as their Mistresses; for none
of them had any Masks on: They wanted in my
Room till I came down, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Re∣spects
to me after the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at
down on a <HI>Safra,</HI> that is to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cross-legg'd
on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> laid on the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="225"/>
This was admirably fine, and I was indeed,
startled at it; they made their Compliment to
me in <HI>French,</HI> and I reply'd in the same Language;
when the Doors were open'd, they walk'd into
the Dancing-Room, and danc'd such a Dance, as
indeed, no-body there had ever seen, and to an
Instrument like a Guittar, with a small low-found∣ing
Trumpet, which indeed, was very fine, and
which my Lord—had provided.</P>
<P>They danc'd three times all-alone, for no-body
indeed, cou'd dance with them: The Novel∣ty
pleas'd, truly, but yet there was something
wild and <HI>Bizarre</HI> in it, because they really acted
to the Life the barbarous Country whence they
came; but as mine had the <HI>French</HI> Behaviour un∣der
the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Dress, it was every way as
new, and pleas'd much better, indeed.</P>
<P>As soon as they had shewn their <HI>Georgian</HI> and
<HI>Armenian</HI> Shapes, and danc'd, as I have said, three
times, they withdrew, paid their Compliment to
me, (for I was Queen of the Day) and went off
to undress.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen then danc'd with Ladies all
in Masks, and when they stopp'd, no-body rose
up to dance, but all call'd out <HI>Roxana, Roxana;</HI> in
the Interval, my Lord—had brought another
mask'd Person into my Room, who I knew not,
only that I cou'd discern it was not the same Person
that led me out before: This noble Person (for I
afterwards understood it was the Duke of—)
after a short Compliment, led me out into the
middle of the Room.</P>
<P>I was dress'd in the same Vest and Girdle as be∣fore;
but the Robe had a Mantle over it, which
is usual in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Habit, and it was of Crim∣son
and Green; the Green brocaded with Gold;
and my <HI>Tyhiaai,</HI> or <HI>Head-Dress,</HI> vary'd a little from
<PB N="221" REF="226"/>
that I had before, as it stood higher, and had
some Jewels about the rising Part; which made it
look like a Turban crown'd.</P>
<P>I had no Mask, neither did I Paint; and yet
I had the Day of all the Ladies that appear'd at
the Ball, I mean, of those that appear'd with Fa∣ces
on; as for those Mask'd, nothing cou'd be
said of them, no doubt there might be many finer
than I was; it must be confess'd, that the Habit
was infinitely advantageous to me, and every-body
look'd at me with a kind of Pleasure, which gave
me great Advantage too.</P>
<P>After I had danc'd with that noble Person, I
did not offer to dance by myself, as I had be∣fore;
but they all call'd out <HI>Roxana</HI> again; and
two of the Gentlemen came into the Drawing-Room,
to intreat me to give them the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Dance, which I yielded to, readily; so I came
out and danc'd, just as at first.</P>
<P>While I was dancing, I perceiv'd five Persons
standing all together, and among them, one only
with his Hat on; it was an immediate Hint to me
who it was, and had at first, almost put me into
some Disorder; but I went on, received the Ap∣plause
of the House, as before, and retir'd into
my own Room; when I was there, the five Gen∣tlemen
came cross the Room to my Side, and co∣ming
in, follow'd by a Throng of Great Persons,
the Person with his Hat on, said Madam <HI>Roxana</HI>
you <HI>perform to Admiration;</HI> I was prepar'd, and
offer'd to kneel to kiss his Hand, but he declin'd
it, and saluted me, and so passing back again thro'
the Great Room, went away.</P>
<P>I do not say here, who this was, but I say, I
came afterwards to know something more plainly;
I wou'd have withdrawn, and disrob'd, being
somewhat too thin in that Dress, unlac'd, and open∣breasted,
<PB N="222" REF="227"/>
as if I had been in my Shift; but it cou'd
not be, and I was oblig'd to dance afterwards with
six or eight Gentlemen, most, if not all of them,
of the First Rank; and I was told afterwards, that
one of them was the D—of <HI>M—th.</HI></P>
<P>About two or three a-Clock in the Morning, the
Company began to decrease, the Number of Wo∣men
especially, dropp'd away Home, some and
some at a time; and the Gentlemen retir'd down
Stairs, where they unmask'd, and went to Play.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> waited at the Room where they Play'd;
sat up all-Night to attend them; and in the
Morning, when they broke-up, they swept the
Box into her Lap, when she counted out to me,
sixty two Guineas and a half; and the other Ser∣vants
got very well two: <HI>Amy</HI> came to me when
they were all gone, <HI>Law—Madam,</HI> says <HI>Amy,</HI>
with a long gaping Cry, what shall I do with all
this Money? And indeed, the poor Creature was
half-mad with Joy.</P>
<P>I was now in my Element; I was as much talk'd
of as any-body cou'd desire, and I did not doubt
but something or other wou'd come of it; but
the Report of my being so rich, rather was a Baulk
to my View, than any-thing else; for the Gentle∣men
that wou'd, perhaps, have been troublesome
enough otherwise, seem'd to be kept off; for
<HI>Roxana</HI> was too high for them.</P>
<P>There is a Scene which came in here, which I
must cover from humane Eyes or Ears; for three
Years and about a Month, <HI>Roxana</HI> liv'd retir'd, ha∣ving
been oblig'd to make an Excursion, in a Man∣ner,
and with a Person, which Duty, and private
Vows, obliges her not to reveal, at least, not yet.</P>
<P>At the End of this Time I appear'd again; but
I must add, that as I had in this Time of Retreat,
<HI>made Hay,</HI> &amp;c.—so I did not come Abroad
<PB N="223" REF="228"/>
again with the same Lustre, or shine with so much
Advantage as before; for as some People had got
at least, a Suspicion of where I had been, and
who had had me all the while, it began to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
publick, that <HI>Roxana</HI> was, in short, a meer <HI>Roxana,</HI>
neither better nor worse; and not that Woman of
Honour and Virtue that was at first suppos'd.</P>
<P>You are now to suppose me about seven Years
come to Town, and that I had not only suffer'd
the old Revenue, which I hinted was manag'd by
Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> to grow, as was mention'd be∣fore;
but I had laid-up an incredible Wealth, the
time consider'd; and had I yet had the least
Thought of reforming, I had all the Opportu∣nity
to do it with Advantage, that ever Woman
had; for the common Vice of all Whores, I mean
Money, was out of the Question, nay, even Ava∣rice
itself seem'd to be glutted; for, including
what I had sav'd in reserving the Interest of
14000 <HI>l.</HI> which, as above, I had left to grow;
and including some very good Presents I had
made to me, in meer Compliment, upon these
shining masquerading Meetings, which I held up
for about two Years, and what I made of three
Years of the most glorious Retreat, <HI>as I call it,</HI> that
ever Woman had, I had fully doubled my first
Substance, and had near 5000 Pounds in Money,
which I kept at-home; besides abundance of Plate,
and Jewels, which I had either given me, or had
bought to set myself out for Publick Days.</P>
<P>In a word, I had now five and thirty Thou∣sand
Pounds Estate; and as I found Ways to live
without wasting either Principal or Interest, I
laid-up 2000 <HI>l.</HI> every Year, at least, out of the
meer Interest, adding it to the Principal; and
thus I went on.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="229"/>
After the End of what I call my Retreat, and
out of which I brought a great deal of Money, I ap∣pear'd
again, but I seem'd like an old Piece of
Plate that had been hoarded up some Years, and
comes out tarnish'd and discolour'd; so I came
out blown, and look'd like <HI>a cast-off Mistress,</HI> nor
indeed, was I any better; tho' I was not at-all
impair'd in Beauty, except that I was a little fat∣ter
than I was formerly, and always granting that
I was four Years older.</P>
<P>However, I preserv'd the Youth of my Tem∣per;
was always bright, pleasant in Company,
and agreeable to every-body, or else every-body
flatter'd me; and in this Condition I came A∣broad
to the World again; and tho' I was
not so popular as before, and indeed, did not
seek it, because I knew it cou'd not be; yet I
was far from being without Company, and that of
the greatest Quality, <HI>of Subjects I mean,</HI> who fre∣quently
visited me, and sometimes we had Meet∣ings
for Mirth, and Play, at my Apartments,
where I fail'd not to divert them in the most
agreeable Manner possible.</P>
<P>Nor cou'd any of them make the least parti∣cular
Application to me, from the Notion they
had of my excessive Wealth, which, as they
thought, plac'd me above the meanness of a Main∣tenance;
and so left no room to come easily about
me.</P>
<P>But at last I was very handsomly attack'd by
a Person of Honour, and (which recommended
him particularly to me) a Person of a very great
Estate; he made a long Introduction to me upon
the Subject of my Wealth: Ignorant Creature!
<HI>said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to myself,</HI> considering him as a LORD; was
there ever Woman in the World that cou'd stoop
to the Baseness of being a Whore, and was above
<PB N="225" REF="230"/>
taking the Reward of her Vice! <HI>No, no depend
upon it,</HI> if your Lordship obtains any-thing of me, you
must pay for it; and the Notion of my being so rich,
serves only to make it cost you the dearer, seeing you
cannot offer a small Matter to a Woman of 2000 <HI>l.
a Year Estate.</HI></P>
<P>After he had harangu'd upon that Subject a
good-while, and had assur'd me he had no De∣sign
upon me; that he did not come to make a
Prize of me, or to pick my Pocket, which (by the
way) I was in no fear of, for I took too much Care
of my Money, to part with any of it that way;
he then turn'd his Discourse to the Subject of
Love; a Point so ridiculous to me, without the
the main thing, I mean the Money, that I had no
Patience to hear him make so long a Story of it.</P>
<P>I receiv'd him civilly, and let him see I cou'd
bear to hear a wicked Proposal, without being af∣fronted,
and yet I was not to be brought into it
too easily: He visited me a long-while, and in
short, courted me as closely and assiduously, as if
he had been wooing me to Matrimony; he made me
several valuable Presents, which I suffer'd myself
to be prevail'd with to accept, but not without
great Difficulty.</P>
<P>Gradually I suffer'd also his other Importunities,
and when he made a Proposal of a Compliment,
or Appointment to me, for a Settlement, <HI>he said,</HI>
That tho' I was rich, yet there was not the less
due from him, to acknowledge the Favours he re∣ceiv'd;
and that if I was to be his, I shou'd not
live at my own Expence, <HI>cost what it wou'd:</HI> I told
him, I was far from being Extravagant, and yet
I did not live at the Expence of less than 500 <HI>l.</HI> a
Year out of my own Pocket; that however, I was not
covetous of settled Allowances, for I look'd upon
that as a kind of <HI>Golden Chain,</HI> something like Ma∣trimony;
<PB N="226" REF="231"/>
that tho' I knew how to be true to a
Man of Honour, as I knew his Lordship to be,
yet I had a kind of Aversion to the Bonds; and
tho' I was not so rich as the World talk'd me up
to be, yet I was not so poor as to bind myself
to Hardships, for a Pension.</P>
<P>He told me, he expected to make my Life per∣fectly
easie, and intended it so; that he knew of
no Bondage there cou'd be in a private Engage∣ment
between us; that the Bonds of Honour he
knew I wou'd be ty'd by, and think them no Bur∣then;
and for other Obligations, he scorn'd to
expect any-thing from me, but what he knew,
as a Woman of Honour, I cou'd grant; then, as
to Maintenance, he told me, he wou'd soon show
me that he valued me infinitely above 500 <HI>l.</HI> a
Year; and upon this foot we began.</P>
<P>I seem'd kinder to him after this Discourse;
and as Time and Private Conversation made us
very intimate, we began to come nearer to the main
Article, <HI>namely,</HI> the 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; he offer'd
that at first Word; and to acknowledge it as
an infinite Favour to have it be accepted of; and I,
that thought it was too much by all the Money,
suffer'd myself to be master'd, or prevail'd with,
to yield, even on but a bare Engagement upon Pa∣role.</P>
<P>When he had obtain'd his End that way, I told
him my Mind: Now you see, my Lord, <HI>said I,</HI>
how weakly I have acted, <HI>namely,</HI> to yield to you
without any Capitulation, or any-thing secur'd to
me, but that which you may cease to allow, when
you please; if I am the less valued for such a Con∣fidence,
I shall be injur'd in a Manner that I will
endeavour not to deserve.</P>
<P>He told me, that he wou'd make it evident to
me, that he did not seek me by way of Bargain,
<PB N="227" REF="232"/>
as such things were often done; that as I had
treated him with a generous Confidence, so I shou'd
find I was in the Hands of a Man of Honour, and
one that knew how to value the Obligation; and
upon this, he pull'd out a Goldsmith's Bill for
300 <HI>l.</HI> which, putting it into my Hand, he said
he gave me as a Pledge, that I shou'd not be a
Loser by my not having made a Bargain with
him.</P>
<P>This was engaging indeed, and gave me a good
Idea of our future Correspondence; and in short,
as I cou'd not refrain treating him with more
Kindness than I had done before, so one thing
begetting another, I gave him several Testimonies
that I was entirely his own, by Inclination, as well
as by the common Obligation of a Mistress; and
this pleas'd him exceedingly.</P>
<P>Soon after this private Engagement, I began to
consider, whether it were not more suitable to the
Manner of Life I now led, to be a little less pub∣lick;
and as I told my Lord, it wou'd rid me of
the Importunities of others, and of continual Vi∣sits
from a sort of People who he knew of, and
who, by the way, having now got the Notion of
me which I really deserv'd, began to talk of the
old Game, Love and Gallantry, and to offer at what
was rude enough; things as nauceous to me now,
as if I had been married, and as virtuous as other
People: The Visits of these People began indeed,
to be uneasie to me, and particularly, as they were
always very tedious and impertinent; nor cou'd
my Lord—be pleas'd with them at-all, if
they had gone on: It wou'd be diverting to set
down here, in what manner I repuls'd these sort
of People; how in some I resented it as an Affront,
and told them, that I was sorry they shou'd oblige
me to vindicate myself from the Scandal of such
<PB N="228" REF="233"/>
Suggestions, by telling them, that <HI>I cou'd see them
no more,</HI> and by desiring them not to give them∣selves
the trouble of visiting me, who, tho' I
was not willing to be uncivil, yet thought my∣self
oblig'd never to receive any Visit from any
Gentleman, after he had made such Proposals as
those to me: But these things wou'd be too te∣dious
to bring in here; it was on this Account
I propos'd to his Lordship my taking new Lodg∣ings
for Privacy; besides I consider'd that as I might
live very handsomely, and yet not so publickly,
so I needed not spend so much Money, by a great
deal; and if I made 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year of this generous
Person, it was more than I had any Occasion to
spend, by a great deal.</P>
<P>My Lord came readily into this Proposal, and
went farther than I expected; for he found out
a Lodging for me in a very handsome House,
where yet he was not known; I suppose he had
employ'd somebody to find it out for him; and
where he had a convenient Way to come into the
Garden, by a Door that open'd into the Park;
a thing very rarely allow'd in those Times.</P>
<P>By this Key he cou'd come in at what time of
Night or Day he pleas'd; and as we had also a
little Door in the lower Part of the House, which
was always left upon a Lock, and his was the
Master-Key, so if it was twelve, one, or two a-Clock
at Night, he cou'd come directly into my
Bed-Chamber. <HI>N. B.</HI> I was not afraid I shou'd be
found a-Bed with any-body else, for, in a word,
I convers'd with no-body at-all.</P>
<P>It happen'd pleasantly enough one Night; his
Lordship had staid late, and I not expecting him
that Night, had taken <HI>Amy</HI> to-Bed with me, and
when my Lord came into the Chamber, we were
both fast asleep, I think it was near three a-Clock
<PB N="229" REF="234"/>
when he came in, and a little merry, but not at∣all
suddl'd, or what they call in Drink; and he
came at once into the Room.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was frighted out of her Wits, and cry'd
out; <HI>I said calmly,</HI> indeed my Lord, I did not ex∣pect
yow to-Night, and we have been a little
frighted to-Night with Fire: O! <HI>says he,</HI> I see you
have got a Bedfellow with you; I began to make
an Apology, <HI>No? no, says my Lord,</HI> you need no Ex∣cuse,
'tis not a Man-Bedfellow I see; but then
talking merrily enough, he catch'd his Words
back; but hark-ye, <HI>says he,</HI> now I think on't, how
shall I be Satisfied it is not a Man-Bedfellow? O,
<HI>says I,</HI> I dare say your Lordship is satisfy'd 'tis
poor <HI>Amy;</HI> yes, <HI>says he,</HI> 'tis Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> but how
do I know what <HI>Amy</HI> is? It may be Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> for
ought I know; I hope you'll give me Leave to
be satify'd: I told him, Yes, by all means I
wou'd have his Lordship satisfy'd, but I suppos'd
he knew who she was.</P>
<P>Well, he fell foul of poor <HI>Amy,</HI> and indeed, I
thought once he wou'd have carry'd the Jest on
before my Face, as was once done in a like Case;
but his Lordship was not so hot neither; but he
wou'd know whether <HI>Amy</HI> was Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> or Mrs.
<HI>Amy</HI> and so I suppose he did; and then being sa∣tisfy'd
in that doubtful Case, he walk'd to the
farther-end of the Room, and went into a little
Closet, and sat down.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Amy</HI> and I got up, and I bid
her run and make the Bed in another Chamber for
my Lord, and I gave her Sheets to put into it;
which she did immediately, and I put my Lord
to-Bed there; and when I had done, at his De∣sire,
went to-Bed to him: I was backward at first,
to come to-Bed to him, and made my Excuse, be∣cause
I had been in-Bed with <HI>Amy,</HI> and had not
<PB N="230" REF="235"/>
shifted me, but he was past those Niceties at that
time; aud as long as he was sure it was Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI>
and not Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> he was very well satisfy'd, and
so the Jest pass'd over; but <HI>Amy</HI> appear'd no
more all that Night, or the next Day, and when
she did, my Lord was so merry with her upon
his <HI>Ecclairicissiment,</HI> as he call'd it, that <HI>Amy</HI> did
not know what to do with herself.</P>
<P>Not that <HI>Amy</HI> was such a nice Lady in the main,
if she had been fairly dealt with, as has appear'd
in the former Part of this Work; but now she
was surpriz'd, and a little hurried, that she scarce
knew where she was; and besides, she was, as
to his Lordship, as nice a Lady as any in the
World, and for any-thing he knew of her, she
appear'd as such; the rest was to us only that
knew of it.</P>
<P>I held this wicked Scene of Life out eight Years,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eckoning from my first coming to <HI>England;</HI> and
tho' my Lord found no Fault, yet I found, with∣out
much examining, that any-one who look'd
in may Face, might see I was above twenty Years
old, and yet, without flattering myself, I carried
my Age, which was above Fifty, very well too.</P>
<P>I may venture to say, that no Woman ever liv'd
a Life like me, of six and twenty Years of Wick∣edness,
without the least Signals of Remorse;
without any Signs of Repentance; or without so
much us a Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to put an End to it; I had so
long habituated myself to a Life of Vice, that
really it appear'd to be no Vice to me; I went on
smooth and pleasant; I wallow'd in Wealth, and
it flow'd in upon me at such a Rate, having taken
the frugal Measures that the good Knight di∣rected;
so that I had at the End of the eight
Years, two Thousand eight Hundred Pounds co∣ming
Yearly in, of which I did not spend one
<PB N="231" REF="236"/>
Penny, being maintain'd by my Allowance from
my Lord—, and more than maintain'd, by
above 200 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> for tho' he did not con∣tract
for 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, as I made dumb Signs to
have it be, yet he gave me Money so often, and
that in such large Parcels, that I had seldom so
little as seven to eight Hundred Pounds a Year
of him, one Year with another.</P>
<P>I must go back here, after telling openly the
wicked things I did, to mention something, which
however, had the Face of doing good; I remember'd,
that when I went from <HI>England,</HI> which
was fifteen Years before, I had left five little Chil∣dren,
turn'd out, as it were, to the wide World,
and to the Charity of their Father's Relati∣ons;
the Eldest was not fix Years old, for we had
not been marry'd full seven Years when their Fa∣ther
went away.</P>
<P>After my coming to <HI>England,</HI> I was greatly de∣sirous
to hear how things stood with them; and
whether they were all alive or not; and in what
Manner they had been maintain'd; and yet I re∣solv'd
not to discover myself to them, in the least;
or to let any of the People that had the breed∣ing
of them up, know that there was such a-body
left in the World, as their Mother.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was the only-body I cou'd trust with such
a Commission, and I sent her into <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI>
to the old Aunt, and to the poor Woman, that
were so instrumental in disposing the Relations to
take some Care of the Children, but they were
both gone, dead and buried some Years; the next
Enquiry she made, was at the House where she
carry'd the poor Children, and turn'd them in at
the Door; when she came there, she found the
House inhabited by other People, so that she cou'd
make little or nothing of her Enquiries, and
<PB N="232" REF="237"/>
came back with an Answer, that indeed, was no
Answer to me, for it gave me no Satisfaction
at-all: I sent her back to enquire in the Neigh∣bourhood,
what was become of the Family that
liv'd in that House? and if they were remov'd,
where they liv'd? and what Circumstances they
were in? and withal, if she cou'd, what became
of the poor Children, and how they liv'd, and
where? how they had been treated? <HI>and the
like.</HI></P>
<P>She brought me back word, upon this second
going, that she heard as to the Family, that the
Husband, who tho' but Uncle-in-Law to the Chil∣dren,
had yet been kindest to them, was dead;
and that the Widow was left but in mean Circum∣stances,
that is to say, she did not want, but
that she was not so well in the World as she was
thought to be when her Husband was alive.</P>
<P>That as to the poor Children, two of them it
seems, had been kept by her, that is to say, by
her Husband, while he liv'd, for that it was a∣gainst
her Will, that we all knew; but the honest
Neighbours pity'd the poor Children, <HI>they said,</HI>
heartily; for that their Aunt us'd them barba∣rously,
and made them little better than Servants
in the House, to wait upon her and her Children,
and scarce allow'd them Cloaths fit to wear.</P>
<P>These were, it seems my Eldest, and Third,
which were Daughters; the Second was a Son;
the Fourth a Daughter; and the Youngest a Son.</P>
<P>To finish the melancholly Part of this History
of my two unhappy Girls, she brought me word,
that as soon as they were able to go out, and get
any Work, they went from her; and some said,
she had turn'd them out of Doors; but it seems
she had not done so, but she us'd them so cruelly
that they left her; and one of them went to Ser∣vice
<PB N="233" REF="238"/>
to a Neighbour's a little-way off, who knew
her, an honest substantial Weaver's Wife, to whom
she was Chamber-Maid, and in a little time she
took her Sister out of the <HI>Bridewell</HI> of her Aunt's
House, and got her a Place too.</P>
<P>This was all melancholly and dull; I sent her
then to the Weaver's House, where the Eldest had
liv'd, but found that her Mistress being dead, she
was gone, and no-body knew there, whither she
went; only that they heard she had liv'd with a
great Lady at the other-end of the Town; but
they did not know who that Lady was.</P>
<P>These Enquiries took us up three or four Weeks,
and I was not one Jot the better for it, for I cou'd
hear nothing to my Satisfaction; I sent her next to
find out the honest Man, who, as in the Beginning
of my Story I observ'd made them be entertain'd,
and caus'd the Youngest to be fetch'd from the
Town where we liv'd, and where the Parish-Of∣ficers
had taken Care of him: This Gentleman
was still alive; and there she heard that my young∣est
Daugher and eldest Son was dead also; but
that my youngest Son was alive, and was at that
time, about 17 Years old; and that he was put
out Apprentice, by the Kindness and Charity of
his Uncle, but to a mean Trade, and at which lie
was oblig'd to work very hard.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was so curious in this Part, that she went
immediately to see him, and found him all-dirty,
and hard at-work; she had no remembrance at-all
of the Youth, for she had not seen him since he
was about two Years old; and it was evident <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
cou'd have no Knowledge of her.</P>
<P>However, she talk'd with him, and found him a
good sensible mannerly Youth; that he knew little
of the Story of his Father or Mother, and had no
View of any-thing, but to work hard for his Li∣ving;
<PB N="234" REF="239"/>
and she did not think fit to put any great
things into his Head, lest it shou'd take him off
of his Business, and perhaps, make him turn giddy∣headed,
and be good for nothing; but she went
and found out that Kind Man, his Benefactor, who
had put him out; and finding him a plain well∣meaning,
honest, and kind-hearted Man, she o∣pen'd
her Tale to him the easier: She made a
long Story, how she had a prodigious Kindness
for the Child, because she had the same for his
Father and Mother; told him, that she was the
Servant-Maid that brought all of them to their
Aunt's Door, and run away and left them; to that
their poor Mother wanted Bread; and what came
of her after, she wou'd have been glad to know;
she added, that her Circumstances had happen'd
to mend in the World; and that, as she was in
Condition, so she was dispos'd to shew some Kind∣ness
to the Children, if she cou'd find them out.</P>
<P>He receiv'd her with all the Civility that so
kind a Proposal demanded; gave her an Account
what he had done for the Child; how he had
maintain'd him, fed and cloath'd him; put him
to School, and at last, put him out to a Trade;
<HI>she said,</HI> he had indeed, been a Father to the
Child; but Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> 'tis a very laborious hard∣working
Trade, and he is but a thin weak Boy;
that's true, <HI>says he,</HI> but the Boy chose the Trade,
and I assure you, I gave 20 <HI>l.</HI> with him, and am
to find him Cloaths all his Apprenticeship; and as
to its being a hard Trade, <HI>says he,</HI> that's the Fate
of his Circumstances, poor Boy; I cou'd not well
do better for him.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, as you did all for him in Charity,
<HI>says she,</HI> it was exceeding well; but as my Reso∣lution
is to do something for him, I desire you
will, if possible, take him away again, from that
<PB N="235" REF="240"/>
Place, where he works so hard, for I cannot bear
to see the Child work so very hard for his Bread,
and I will do something for him, that shall make
him live without such hard Labour.</P>
<P>He smil'd at that; I can indeed, <HI>says he,</HI> take
him away, but then I must lose my 20 <HI>l.</HI> that
I gave with him.</P>
<P>Well Sir, said <HI>Amy,</HI> I'll enable you to lose
that 20 <HI>l.</HI> immediately, and so she put her Hand
in her Pocket, and pulls out her Purse.</P>
<P>He begun to be a little amaz'd at her, and
looked her hard in the Face, and that so very
much, that she took Notice of it, and said, Sir,
I Fancy by your looking at me, you think you
know me, but I am assur'd you do not, for I
never saw your Face before; I think you
have done enough for the Child, and that you
ought to be acknowleg'd as a Father to him,
but you ought not to lose by your Kindness to
him, more than the Kindness of bringing him
up obliges you to; and therefore there's the
twenty Pound, <HI>added she,</HI> and pray let him be
fetch'd away.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> I will thank you for
the Boy, as well as for my self; but will you
please to tell me, what I must do with him.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>says Amy,</HI> as you have been so Kind to
keep him so many Years, I beg you will take
him home again one Year more, and I'll bring
you an hundred Pound more, which I will desire
you to lay-out in Schooling and Cloaths for him,
and to pay you for his Board; perhaps I may
put him in a Condition to return your Kindness.</P>
<P>He look'd pleas'd, but surpriz'd very much,
and enquir'd of <HI>Amy,</HI> but with very great Re∣spect,
what he should go to School to learn? and
what Trade she would please to put him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣to?</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="241"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> said, he should put him to learn a little
<HI>Latin,</HI> and then Merchants-Accounts; and to
write a good Hand, for she would have him be
put to a <HI>Turkey</HI>-Merchant.</P>
<P>Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> I am glad for his sake, to
hear you talk so; but do you know that a
<HI>Turkey</HI>-Merchant will not take him under 4 or
500 Pounds?</P>
<P>Yes Sir, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I know it very well.</P>
<P>And, <HI>says he,</HI> that it will require as many
Thousnds to let him up?</P>
<P>Yes Sir, <HI>says Amy,</HI> I know that very well too;
and resolving to talk very big, <HI>she added,</HI> I have
no Children of my own, and I resolve to make
him my Heir; and if ten Thousand Pounds be re∣quir'd
to set him up, he shall not want it; I was
but his Mother's Servant when he was born, and
I mourn'd heartily for the Disaster of the Fa∣mily;
and I always said, if ever I was worth any∣thing
in the World, I wou'd take the Child for
my own, and I'll be as good as my Word now,
tho' I did not then foresee that it wou'd be with
me, as it has been since: And so <HI>Amy</HI> told him a
long Story how she was troubled for me; and
what she wou'd give to hear whether I was dead
or alive, and what Circumstances I was in; that
if she cou'd but find me, if I was ever so poor, she
wou'd take Care of me, and make a Gentlewo∣man
of me again.</P>
<P>He told her, That as to the Child's Mother, she
had been reduc'd to the last Extremity, and was ob∣lig'd
(as he suppos'd she knew) to send the Children
all among her Husband's Friends; and if it had not
been for him, they had all been sent to the Parish;
but that he oblig'd the other Relations to share
the Charge among them; that he had taken two,
whereof he had lost the eldest, who died of the
<PB N="237" REF="242"/>
Small-Pox; but that he had been as careful of this,
as of his own, and had made very little Difference
in their breeding up; only that when he came to
put him out, he thought it was best for the Boy,
to put him to a Trade which he might set-up in,
without a Stock; for otherwise his Time wou'd
be lost; and that as to his Mother, he had never
been able to hear one Word of her, no, not tho'
he had made the utmost Enquiry after her; that
there went a Report, that she had drown'd her∣self;
but that he cou'd never meet with any-body
that cou'd give him a certain Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> counterfeited a Cry for her poor Mistress;
told him, she wou'd give any thing in the World
to see her, if she was alive; and a great deal more
such-like Talk they had about that; then they
return'd to speak of the Boy.</P>
<P>He enquir'd of her, why she did not seek after
the Child before, that he might have been brought
up from a younger Age, suitable to what she de∣sign'd
to do for him.</P>
<P>She told him, she had been out of <HI>England,</HI>
and was but newly return'd from the <HI>East-Indies;</HI>
that she had been out of <HI>England,</HI> and was but
newly return'd, was true; but the latter was false,
and was put in to blind him, and provide against
farther Enquiries; for it was not a strange thing
for young Women to go away poor to the
<HI>East-Indies,</HI> and come home vastly Rich; so she
went on with Directions about him; and both
agreed in this, that the Boy should by no means
be told what was intended for him, but only that
he should be taken home again to his Uncle's;
that his Uncle thought the Trade too hard for
him, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>About three Days after this, <HI>Amy</HI> goes again,
and carry'd him the hundred Pound she promis'd
<PB N="238" REF="243"/>
him, but then <HI>Amy</HI> made quite another Figure
than she did before; for she went in my Coach,
with two Footmen after her, and dress'd very
fine also, with Jewells and a Gold Watch; and
there was indeed, no great Difficulty to make
<HI>Amy</HI> look like a Lady, for she was a very hand∣some
well-shap'd Woman, and genteel enough;
the Coachman and Servants were particularly
order'd to show her the same Respect as they
wou'd to me, and to call her Madam <HI>Collins,</HI> if
they were ask'd any Questions about her.</P>
<P>When the Gentleman saw what a Figure she
made, it added to the former Surprize, and he
entertain'd her in the most respectful Manner
possible; congratulated her Advancement in For∣tune,
and particularly rejoyc'd that It should fall
to the poor Child's Lot to be so provided for,
contrary to all Expectation.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy</HI> talk'd big, but very free and fami∣liar;
told them she had no Pride in her good-Fortune;
(and that was true enough for to give
<HI>Amy</HI> her due, she was far from it, and was as
good-humour'd a Creature as ever liv'd) that
she was the same as ever, and that she always
lov'd this Boy, and was resolv'd to do something
extraordinary for him.</P>
<P>Then she pull'd out her Money, and paid him
down an hundred and twenty Pounds, which,
she said, she paid him, that he might be sure
he should be no Loser by taking him Home
again, and that she would come and see him again,
and talk farther about things with him, that so
all might be settled for him, in such a Manner,
as the Accidents, such as Mortality, or any-thing
else, should make no Alteration to the Child's
Prejudice.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="244"/>
At this Meeting, the Uncle brought his Wife
out, a good motherly, comely, grave Woman
who spoke very tenderly of the Youth, and as
it appear'd, had been very good to him, tho'
she had several Children of her own: After a long
Discourse, she put in a Word of her own; Ma∣dam,
<HI>says she,</HI> I am heartily glad of the good In∣tentions
you have for this poor Orphan, and I re∣joice
sincerely in it, for his sake; but Madam,
you know, (I suppose) that there are two Sisters
alive too, may we not speak a Word for them?
<HI>Poor Girls, says she,</HI> they have not been so kindly
us'd, as he has; and are turn'd out to the wide
World.</P>
<P>Where are they, Madam? <HI>says Amy.</HI></P>
<P>Poor Creatures, <HI>says the Gentlewoman,</HI> they are
out at Service; no-body knows where but them∣selves;
their Case is very hard.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>says Amy,</HI> tho', if I cou'd find
them, I would assist them; yet my Concern is for
my boy, <HI>as I call him,</HI> and I will put him into a
Condition to take Care of his Sisters.</P>
<P>But, Madam, <HI>says the good compassionate Creature,</HI>
he may not be so charitable perhaps, by his own
Inclination, for Brothers are not Fathers; and they
have been cruelly us'd already, poor Girls; we
have often reliev'd them, both with Victuals and
Cloaths too, even while they were pretended to be
kept by their barbarous Aunt.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>says Amy,</HI> what can I do for
them; they are gone, it seems, and cannot be
heard of? When I see them, 'tis time enough.</P>
<P>She press'd <HI>Amy</HI> then, to oblige their Brother,
out of the plentiful Fortune he was like to have,
to do something for his Sisters, when, he should
be able.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="245"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> spoke coldly of that still, but said, she
would consider of It; and so they parted for that
time; they had several Meetings after this, for <HI>Amy</HI>
went to see her adopted Son, and order'd his School∣ing,
Cloaths, and other things, but enjoin'd them
not to tell the Young-Man any-thing, but that
they thought the Trade he was at, too hard for
him, and they wou'd keep him at-home a little
longer, and give him some Schooling, to fit him
for better Business; and <HI>Amy</HI> appear'd to him as
she did before, only as one that had known his
Mother, and had some Kindness for him.</P>
<P>Thus this Matter pass'd on for near a Twelve∣month,
when it happen'd, that one of my Maid-Servants
having ask'd <HI>Amy</HI> Leave, for <HI>Amy</HI> was
Mistress of the Servants, and took, and put-out
such as she pleas'd; I say, having ask'd Leave to
go into the City, to see her Friends, came Home
crying bitterly, and in a most grievous Agony
she was, and continued so several Days, till <HI>Amy</HI>
perceiving the Excess, and that the Maid wou'd
certainly cry herself Sick; she took an Opportunity
with her, and examin'd her about it.</P>
<P>The Maid told her a long Story, that she had
been to see her Brother, the only Brother she had
in the World; and that she knew he was put-out
Apprentice to a—; but there had come a
Lady in a Couch, to his Uncle—, who had
brought him up, and made him take him Home
again; and so the Wench run-on with the whole
Story, just as 'tis told above, till she came to
that Part that belong'd to herself; and there, <HI>says
she,</HI> I had not let them know where I liv'd; and
the Lady wou'd have taken me, and they say,
wou'd have provided for me too, as she has done
for my Brother, but no-body cou'd tell where to
find me, and so I have lost it all, and all the Hopes
<PB N="241" REF="246"/>
of being any-thing, but a poor Servant all my
Days; and then the Girl fell a-crying again.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> said, what's all this Story? who cou'd
this Lady be? it must be some Trick sure? No,
<HI>she said,</HI> it was not a Trick, for she had made
them, take her Brother home from Apprentice,
and bought him new Cloaths, and put him to
have more Learning; and the Gentlewoman said
she wou'd make him her Heir.</P>
<P>Her Heir! <HI>says Amy;</HI> what does that amount
to; it may be she had nothing to leave him; she
might make any-body her Heir.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>says the Girl,</HI> she came in a fine Coach
and Horses, and I don't know how-many Footmen
to attend her, and brought a great Bag of Gold,
and gave it to my Uncle—, he that brought
up my Brother, to buy him Cloaths, and to pay
for his Schooling and Board.</P>
<P>He that brought up your Brother? <HI>says Amy;</HI>
why, did not he bring you up too, as well as your
Brother? Pray who brought you up then?</P>
<P>Here the poor Girl told a melancholly Story,
how an Aunt had brought-up her and her Sister,
and how barbarously she had us'd them, as we
have heard.</P>
<P>By this time <HI>Amy</HI> had her Head full enough,
and her Heart too; and did not know how to hold
it, or what to do, for she was satisfied that this
was no other than my own Daughter; for she
told her all the History of her Father and Mo∣ther;
and how she was carried by their Maid, to
her Aunt's Door, just as is related in the begin∣ning
of my Story.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> did not tell me this Story for a great∣while;
nor did she well know what Course to take
in it; but as she had Authority to manage every∣thing
in the Family, she took Occasion some time
<PB N="242" REF="247"/>
after, without letting me know any thing of it, to
find some▪ Fault with the Maid, and turn her
away.</P>
<P>Her Reasons were good, tho' at first I was not
pleas'd when I heard of it, but I was convinc'd
afterwards, that she was in the right; for if she
had told me of it, I shou'd have been in great
Perplexity between the Difficulty of concealing
myself from my own Child, and the Inconveni∣ence
of having my Way of Living be known a∣mong
my First Husband's Relations, and even to
my Husband himself; for as to his being dead at
<HI>Paris, Amy</HI> seeing me resolv'd against marrying
any-more, had told me, that she had form'd that
Story only to make me easie, when I was in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
if any-thing should offer to my liking.</P>
<P>However, I was too tender a Mother still, not∣withstanding
what I had done, to let this poor
Girl go about the World drudging, as it were,
for Bread, and slaving at the Fire, and in the Kit∣chin,
as a Cook-Maid; besides it came into my
Head, that she might, perhaps, marry some poor
Devil of a Footman, or a Coachman, or some
such thing, and be undone that way; or, which
was worse, be drawn in to lie with some of that
course cursed Kind, and be with-Child, and be
utterly ruin'd that way; and in the midst of all
my Prosperity this gave me great Uneasiness.</P>
<P>As to sending <HI>Amy</HI> to her, there was no doing
that now; for as she had been Servant in the
House, she knew <HI>Amy,</HI> as well as <HI>Amy</HI> knew me;
and no doubt, tho' I was much out of her Sight,
yet she might have had the Curiosity to have
peep'd at me, and seen me enough to know me
again, if I had discover'd myself to her so that,
in short, there was nothing to be done that way.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="248"/>
However, <HI>Amy,</HI> a diligent indefatigable Creature,
found out another Woman, and gave her her Er∣rand,
and sent her to the honest Man's House in
<HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> whither she suppos'd the Girl wou'd
go, after she was out of her Place; and bade her
talk with her, and tell her at a distance, that as
something had been done for her Brother, so some∣thing
wou'd be done for her too; and that she
shou'd not be discourag'd, she carried her 20 <HI>l.</HI> to
buy her Cloaths, and bid her not go to Service any∣more,
but think of other things; that she shou'd
take a Lodging in some good Family, and that she
shou'd soon hear farther.</P>
<P>The Girl was overjoy'd with this News, you
may be sure, and at first a little too much elevated
with it, and dress'd herself very handsomely in∣deed,
and as soon as she had done so, came and
paid a Visit to Madam <HI>Amy,</HI> to let her see how
fine she was: <HI>Amy</HI> congratulated her, and wish'd
it might be all as she expected; but admonish'd
her not to be elevated with it too much; told
her, Humility was the best Ornament of a Gentle∣woman;
and a great deal of good Advice she gave
her, but discover'd nothing.</P>
<P>All this was acted in the first Years of my set∣ting-up
my new Figure here in Town, and while
the Masks and Balls were in Agitation; and <HI>Amy</HI>
carried on the Affair of setting-out my Son into
the World, which we were assisted in by the sage
Advice of my faithful Counsellor, Sir <HI>Robert Clay∣ton,</HI>
who procur'd us a Master for him, by whom
he was afterwards sent Abroad to <HI>Italy,</HI> as you
shall hear in its Place; and <HI>Amy</HI> manag'd my
Daughter too, very well, tho' by a third hand.</P>
<P>My Amour with my Lord—began now
to draw to an end, and indeed, notwithstanding
his Money, it had lasted so long, that I was much
<PB N="244" REF="249"/>
more sick of his Lordship, than he cou'd be of
me; he grew old, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retful, and captious, and
I must add, which made the Vice itself begin to
grow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eiting and nauceous to me, he grew worse
and wickeder the older he grew, and that to such
Degree, as is not fit to write of; and made me so
weary of him, that upon one of his capricious
Humours, which he often took Occasion to trou∣ble
me with, I took Occasion to be much less com∣plaisant
to him than I us'd to be; and as I knew
him to be hasty, I first took care to put him into
a little Passion, and then to resent it, and this
brought us to Words; in which I told him, I
thought he grew sick of me; and he answer'd, in
a heat, that <HI>truly so he was;</HI> I answer'd, that I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound his Lordship was endeavouring to <HI>make me
sick too;</HI> that I had met with several such Rubs
from him of late; and that he did not use me as
he us'd to do; and I begg'd his Lordship, he
wou'd make himself easie: This I spoke with an
Air of Coldness and Indifference, such as I knew
he cou'd not bear; but I did not downright quar∣rel
with him, and tell him <HI>I was sick of him too,</HI> and
desire him to quit me, for I knew that wou'd
come of itself; besides, I had receiv'd a great-deal
of handsome Usage from him, and I was loth to
have the Breach be on my Side, that he might
not be able to say I was ungrateful.</P>
<P>But he put the Occasion into my Hands, for he
came no more to me for two Months; indeed I
expected a Fit of Absence, for such I had had
several time before, but not for above a Fort∣night
or three-Weeks at most: But after I had
staid a Month, which was longer than ever he
kept away yet, I took a new Method with him,
for I was resolv'd now it shou'd be in my Power
to continue, or not, as I thought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it; at the end
<PB N="245" REF="250"/>
of a Month therefore, I remov'd, and took Lodg∣ings
at <HI>Kensington Gravel-Pitts,</HI> and that Part next
to the Road to <HI>Acton,</HI> and left no-body in my
Lodgings but <HI>Amy</HI> and a Footman; with proper
Instructions how to behave, when his Lordship
being come to himself, shou'd think fit to come
again, which I knew he wou'd.</P>
<P>About the end of two Months, he came in the
Dusk of the Evening, as usual; the Footman an∣swer'd
him, and told him, his Lady was not at∣home,
but there was Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> above; so he did
not order her to be call'd down, but went up-Stairs
into the Dining-Room, and Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> came
to him; he ask'd where I was? My Lord, <HI>said
she,</HI> my Mistress has been remov'd a good-while,
from hence, and lives at <HI>Kensington:</HI> Ay, Mrs. <HI>Amy!</HI>
how come you to be here then? My Lord, <HI>said
she,</HI> we are here till the Quarter-Day, because the
Goods are not remov'd, and to give Answers, if
any comes to ask for my Lady: Well, and what
Answer are you to give to me? Indeed, my Lord,
<HI>says Amy,</HI> I have no particular Answer to your
Lordship, but to tell you, and every-body else,
where my Lady lives, that they may not think
she's run away: No, Mrs. <HI>Amy, says he,</HI> I don't
think she's run away, but indeed, I can't go after
her so far as that; <HI>Amy</HI> said nothing to that, but
made a Curtsie, and said, she believ'd I wou'd be
there again for a Week or two, in a little time:
How little time, Mrs. <HI>Amy? says my Lord:</HI> She
comes next <HI>Tuesday,</HI> says <HI>Amy:</HI> Very well, says my
Lord, I'll call and see her then; and so he went
away.</P>
<P>Accordingly I came on the <HI>Tuesday,</HI> and staid a
Fortnight, but he came not; so I went back to
<HI>Kensington,</HI> and after that, I had very few of his
Lordship's Visits, which I was very glad of, and
<PB N="246" REF="251"/>
in a little time after was more glad of it, than I
was at first, and upon a far better Account too,</P>
<P>For now I began not to be sick of his Lordship
only, but really I began to be sick of the Vice;
and as I had good Leisure now to divert and en∣joy
myself in the World, as much as it was pos∣sible
for any Woman to do, that ever liv'd in it;
so I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound that my Judgment began to prevail up∣on
me to fix my Delight upon nobler Objects than
I had formerly done; and the very beginning of
this brought some just Reflections upon me, rela∣ting
to things past, and to the former Manner of
my living; and tho' there was not the least Hint
in all this, from what may be call'd Religion or
Conscience, and far from any-thing of Repentance,
or any-thing that was a-kin to it, especially at first;
yet the Sence of things, and the Knowledge I
had of the World, and the vast Variety of Scenes
that I had acted nay Part in, began to work up∣on
my Sences, and it came so very strong upon
my Mind one Morning, when I had been lying
awake some time in my Bed, as if somebody had
ask'd me the Question, <HI>What was I a Whore for now?</HI>
It occurr'd naturally upon this Enquiry, that at
first I yielded to the Importunity of my Circum∣stances,
the Misery of which, the Devil dismal∣ly
aggravated, to draw me to comply; for I
confess, I had strong Natural Aversions to the
Crime at first, partly owing to a virtuous Educa∣tion,
and partly to a Sence of Religion; but the
Devil, and that greater Devil of Poverty, pre∣vail'd;
and the Person who laid Siege to me, did
it in such an obliging, and I may almost say, irre∣sistible
Manner, all still manag'd by the Evil Spi∣rit;
for I must be allow'd to believe, that he has
a Share in all such thing, if not the whole Ma∣nagement
of them: But, I say, it was curried on
<PB N="247" REF="252"/>
by that Person, in such an irresistible Manner, that,
(as I said when I related the Fact) there was no
withstanding it: These Circumstances, I say, the
Devil manag'd, not only to bring me to comply,
but he continued them as Arguments to fortifie
my Mind against all Reflection, and to keep me
in that horrid Course I had engag'd in, as if it
were honest and lawful.</P>
<P>But not to dwell upon that now; this was a Pre∣tence,
and here was something to be said, tho'
I acknowledge, it ought not to have been suffici∣ent
to me at all; but, I say, to leave that, all
this was out of Doors; the Devil himself cou'd
not form one Argument, or put one Reason into
my Head <HI>now,</HI> that cou'd serve for an Answer, no,
nor so much as a pretended Answer to this Que∣stion,
<HI>Why I shou'd be a Whore now?</HI></P>
<P>It had for a-while been a little kind of Excuse
to me, that I was engag'd with this wicked old
Lord, and that I cou'd not, in Honour, forsake
him; but how foolish and absurd did it look, to
repeat the Word Honour on so vile an Occasion?
As if a Woman shou'd prostitute her Honour in
Point of Honour; horrid Inconsistency; Honour
call'd upon me to detest the Crime and the Man
too, and to have resisted all the Attacks which
from the beginning had been made upon my Vir∣tue;
and Honour, had it been consulted, wou'd
have preserv'd me honest from the Beginning.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>For HONESTY and HONOUR, are the same.</HEAD>
<P>This, however, shews us with what faint Excuses,
and with what Trifles we pretend to satisfie our∣selves,
and suppress the Attempts of Conscience
in the Pursuit of agreeable Crime, and in the pos∣sessing
those Pleasures which we are loth to part
with.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="253"/>
But this Objection wou'd now serve no longer;
for my Lord had, in some sort, broke his En∣gagements
(<HI>I won't call it Honour again</HI>) with me,
and had so far slighted me, as fairly to justifie
my entire quitting of him now; and so, as the
Objection was fully answer'd, the Question re∣main'd
still unanswer'd, <HI>Why am I a Whore now?</HI>
Nor indeed, had I any-thing to say for myself,
<HI>even to myself;</HI> I cou'd not without blushing, as
wicked as I was, answer, that I lov'd it for the
sake of the Vice, and that I delighted in being a
Whore, <HI>as such;</HI> I say, I cou'd not say this, even
to myself <HI>and all alone,</HI> nor indeed, wou'd it have
been true; I was never able in Justice, and with
Truth, to say I was so wicked as that; but as Ne∣cessity
first debauch'd me, and Poverty made me
a Whore at the Beginning; so excess of Avarice
for getting Money, and excess of Vanity, conti∣nued
me in the Crime, not being able to resist
the Flatteries of Great Persons; being call'd the
finest Woman in <HI>France;</HI> being caress'd by a
Prince; and afterwards I had Pride enough to
expect, and Folly enough to believe, tho' in∣deed
without ground, by a Great Monarch:
These were my Baits, these the Chains by which
the Devil hold me bound; and by which I was
indeed, too fast h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld for any Reasoning that I
was then Mistress of, to deliver me from.</P>
<P>But this was all over now; Avarice cou'd
have no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; I was out of the reach of all
that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate could be suppos'd to do to reduce me;
now I was so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from Poor, or the Danger of
it, that I had fifty Thousand Pounds in my Poc∣ket
at least; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, I had the Income of fifty Thou∣sand
Pounds; for I had 2500 <HI>l.</HI> a year coming
in, upon very good I and-Security, besides 3 o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Money, which I kept by me for or∣dinary
<PB N="249" REF="254"/>
Occasions, and besides Jewels and Plate,
and Goods, which were worth near 5600 <HI>l.</HI> more;
these put together, when I ruminated on it all in my
Thoughts, as you may be sure I did often, ad∣ded
Weight still to the Question, as above, and
it sounded continually in my Head, what's next?
<HI>What am I a Whore for now?</HI></P>
<P>It is true, this was, as I say, seldom out of
my Thoughts, but yet it made no Impressions
upon me of that Kind which might be expected
from a Reflection of so important a Nature, and
which had so much of Substance and Seriousness
in it.</P>
<P>But however, it was not without some little
Consequences, even at that time, and which gave
a little Turn to my Way of Living at first, as
you shall hear in its Place.</P>
<P>But one particular thing interven'd besides this,
which gave me some Uneasiness at this time, and
made way for other things that follow'd: I have
mention'd in several little Digressions, the Concern
I had upon me for my Children, and in wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Manner I had directed that Affair; I must go
on a little with that Part, in order to bring the
subsequent Parts of my Story together.</P>
<P>My Boy, the only Son I had left, that I had a
legal Right to call Son, was, <HI>as I have said,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
from the unhappy Circumstances of being Ap∣prentice
to a Mechanick, and was brought-up upon
a new foot; but tho' this was infinitely to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Advantage, yet it put him back near three Years
in his coming into the World, for he had been
near a Year at the Drudgery he was first put to,
and it took up two Year more to form him fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
what he had Hopes given him he shou'd hereafter
be, so that he was full 19 Years old, or rather
20 years, before he came to be put-out as I in∣tended;
<PB N="350" REF="255"/>
at the end of which time, I put him to
a very flourishing <HI>Italian</HI> Merchant, and he again
sent him to <HI>Messina,</HI> in the Island of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and
a little before the Juncture I am now speaking of,
I had Letters from him, that as to say, Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI>
had Letters from him, intimating, that he was
out of his Time, and that he had an Opportu∣nity
to be taken into an <HI>English</HI> House there, on
very good Terms, if his Support from hence
might answer what he was bid to hope for; and
so begg'd, that what wou'd be done for him,
might be so order'd, that he might have it for
his present Advancement, referring for the Par∣ticulars
to his Master, the Merchant in <HI>Landon,</HI>
who he had been put Apprentice to here; who,
to cut the Story short, gave such a satisfactory
Account of it, and of my Young-Man, to my
steddy and faithful Counsellor, Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI>
that I made no Scruple to pay 4000 <HI>l.</HI> which was
1000 <HI>l.</HI> more than he demanded, or rather pro∣pos'd,
that he might have Encouragement to en∣ter
into the World better than he expected.</P>
<P>His Master remitted the Money very faithfully
to him, and finding by Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> that the
young Gentleman, for so he call'd him, was well
supported, wrote such Letters on his Account, as
gave him a Credit at <HI>Messina,</HI> equal in Value to
to the Money itself.</P>
<P>I cou'd not digest it very well, that I shou'd
all this while conceal myself thus from my own
Child, and make all this Favour due, in his Opi∣nion,
to a Stranger; and yet I cou'd not find in
my Heart to let my Son know what a Mother
he had, and what a Life she liv'd; when at the
same time that he must think himself infinitely
oblig'd to me, he must be oblig'd, if he was a
Man of Virtue, to hate his Mother, and abhor
<PB N="251" REF="256"/>
the Way of Living, by which all the Bounty
he enjoy'd, was rais'd.</P>
<P>This is the Reason of mentioning this Part of
my Son's Story, which is otherwise no ways con∣cern'd
in my History, but as it put me upon think∣ing
how to put an End to that wicked Course <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was in, that my own Child, when he shou'd af∣terwards
come to <HI>England</HI> in a good Figure, and
with the Appearance of a Merchant, shou'd not
be asham'd to own me.</P>
<P>But there was another Difficulty, which lay
heavier upon me a great-deal, and that was, my
Daughter; who, as before, I had reliev'd by the
Hands of another Instrument, which <HI>Amy</HI> had
procur'd: The Girl, as I have mention'd, was di∣rected
to put herself into a good Garb, take
Lodging, and entertain a Maid to wait upon
her, and to give herself some Breeding, that is to
say, to learn to Dance, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it herself to appear
as a Gentlewoman; being made to hope, that she to
shou'd, sometime or other, find that she shou'd
be put into a Condition to support her Character▪
and to make herself amends for all her former
Troubles; she was only charg'd not to be drawn
into Matrimony, till she was secur'd of a For∣tune
that might assist to dispose of herself sui∣table
not to what she then was, but what she was
to be.</P>
<P>The Girl was too sensible of her Circumstan∣ces,
not to give all possible Satisfaction of that
Kind, and indeed, she was Mistress of too much
Understanding, not to see how much she shou'd
be oblig'd to that Part, for her own Interest.</P>
<P>It was not long after this, but being well e∣quipp'd,
and in every-thing well set-out, as she
was directed, she came, as I have related above,
and paid a Visit to Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and to tell her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="252" REF="257"/>
her good Fortune: <HI>Amy</HI> pretended to be much sur∣priz'd
at the Alteration, and overjoy'd for her sake,
and began to treat her very well, entertain'd her
handsomely, and when she wou'd have gone away,
pretended to ask my Leave, and sent my Coach
home with her; and in short, learning from her
where she lodg'd, which was in the City, <HI>Amy</HI>
promis'd to return her Visit, and did so; and in
a word, <HI>Amy</HI> and SUSAN, (for she was my own
Name) began an intimate Acquaintance together.</P>
<P>There was an inexpressible Difficulty in the
poor Girl's way, or else I shou'd not have been
able to have forborn discovering myself to her,
and this was, her having been a Servant in my
particular Family; and I cou'd by no means think
of ever letting the Children know what a kind of
Creature they ow'd their Being to, or giving them
an Occasion to upbraid their Mother with her
scandalous Life, much less to justifie the like Pra∣ctice
from my Example.</P>
<P>Thus it was with me; and thus, no doubt, con∣sidering
Parents always find it, that their own
Children are a Restraint to them in their worst
Courses, when the Sence of a Superiour Power
has not the same Influence: <HI>But of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>There happen'd however, one good Circum∣stance
in the Case of this poor Girl, which brought
about a Discovery sooner than otherwise it wou'd
have been; and it was thus: After she and <HI>Amy</HI>
had been intimate for some time, and had ex∣chang'd
several Visits, the Girl now grown a Wo∣man,
talking to <HI>Amy</HI> of the gay things that us'd
to fall-out when she was Servant in my Family,
spoke of it with a kind of Concern, that she cou'd
not see [me] her Lady; and at last she adds, <HI>'twas
very strange:</HI> Madam, <HI>says she to</HI> Amy, but tho' I
liv'd near two Years in the House, I never saw my
<PB N="253" REF="258"/>
Mistress in my Life, except it was that publick
Night when she danc'd in the fine <HI>Turkish</HI> Habit,
and then she was so disguis'd, that I knew no∣thing
of her afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was glad to hear this; but as she was a
cunning Girl from the beginning, she was not to
be Bit, and so she laid no Stress upon that, at first,
but gave me an Account of it; and, I must con∣fess,
it gave me a secret Joy, to think that I was
not known to her, and that, by virtue of that only
Accident, I might, when other Circumstances
made room for it, discover myself to her, and let
her know she had a Mother in a Condition fit to
be own'd.</P>
<P>It was a dreadful Restraint to me before, and
this gave me some very sad Reflections, and made
way for the great Question I have mention'd above;
and by how much the Circumstance was bitter to
me, by so much the more agreeable it was, to
understand that the Girl had never seen me, and
consequently, did not know me again, if she was
to be told who I was.</P>
<P>However, the next time she came to visit <HI>Amy,</HI>
I was resolv'd to put it to a Tryal, and to come
into the Room, and let her see me, and to see by
that, whether she knew me or no; but <HI>Amy</HI> put
me by, lest indeed, as there was reason enough
to question, I shou'd not be able to contain, or
forbear discovering myself to her; so it went off
for that time.</P>
<P>But both these Circumstances, and that is the
reason of mentioning them, brought me to consi∣der
of the Life I liv'd, and to resolve to put my∣self
into some Figure of Life, in which I might
not be scandalous to my own Family, and be a∣fraid
to make myself known to my own Children,
who were my own Flesh and Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="259"/>
There was another Daughter I had, which, with
all our Enquiries we cou'd not hear-of, high nor
low, for several Years after the first: But I return
to my own Story.</P>
<P>Being now in part remov'd from my old Station,
I seem'd to be in a fair Way of retiring from my
old Acquaintances, and consequently from the vile
abominable Trade I had driven so long; so that
the Door seem'd to be, as it were, particularly o∣pen'd
to my Reformation, if I had any-mind to
it in earnest; but for all that, some of my old
Friends, as I had us'd to call them, enquir'd me
out, and came to visit me at <HI>Kensington,</HI> and that
more frequently than I wish'd they would do;
but it being once known where I was, there was
no avoiding it, unless I wou'd have downright re∣fus'd
and affronted them; and I was not yet in
Earnest enough with my Resolutions, to go that
lengths.</P>
<P>The best of it was, my old lewd Favourite,
who I now heartily hated, entirely dropp'd me;
he came once to visit me, but I caus'd <HI>Amy</HI> to
deny me, and say I was gone out; she did it so
oddly too, that when his Lordship went away,
he said coldly to her, Well, well, Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> I
find your Mistress does not desire to be seen;
tell her I won't trouble her <HI>any-more,</HI> repeating the
Words <HI>any-more</HI> two or three times over, just at his
going away.</P>
<P>I reflected a little on it at first, as unkind to him,
having had so many considerable Presents from him;
but, <HI>as I have said,</HI> I was sick of him, and that on
some Accounts, which, if I cou'd suffer myself to
publish them, wou'd fully justifie my Conduct;
but that Part of the Story will not bear telling;
so I must leave it, and proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260"/>
I had begun a little, <HI>as I have said above,</HI> to re∣flect
upon my Manner of Living, and to think of
putting a new Face upon it; and nothing mov'd
me to it more, than the Consideration; of my
having three Children, who were now grown up;
and yet, that while I was in that Station of Life,
I cou'd not converse with them, or make myself
Known to them; and this gave me a great-deal of
Uneasiness; at last I enter'd into Talk on this
Part of it, with my Woman, <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P>We liv'd at <HI>Kensington, as I have, said,</HI> and
though I had done with my old wicked L—,
as above, yet I was frequently visited, <HI>as I said,</HI>
by some others, so that, in a word, I began to be
known in the Town, not by my Name only,
but by my Character too, which was worse.</P>
<P>It was one Morning when <HI>Amy</HI> was in-Bed
with me, and I had some of my dullest Thoughts
about me, that <HI>Amy</HI> hearing me sigh pretty often,
ask'd me if I was not well? Yes, <HI>Amy,</HI> I am
well enough, <HI>says</HI> I, but my Mind is oppress'd
with heavy Thoughts, and has been so a good∣while,
and then I told her how it griev'd me
that I cou'd not make myself known to my
own Children, or form any Accquaintances in the
World: Why so? <HI>says Amy;</HI> Why prethee, <HI>Amy,
says I,</HI> what will my Children say to themselves,
and to one another, when they find their Mo∣ther,
however rich she may be, is at best but a
Whore, a common Whore? And as for Accquaint∣ance,
prethee <HI>Amy,</HI> what sober Lady, or what
Family of any Character will visit or be ac∣quainted
with a Whore?</P>
<P>Why, all that's true, Madam, says <HI>Amy;</HI> but
how can it be remedy'd now? 'Tis true <HI>Amy, said
I,</HI> the thing cannot be remedy'd now, but the
Scandal of it, I fancy, may be thrown off.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="261"/>
Truly, says <HI>Amy</HI> I do not see how, unless you
will go Abroad again, and live in some other
Nation, where no-body has known us, or seen
us, so that they cannot say they ever saw us
before.</P>
<P>That very Thought of <HI>Amy</HI> put what follows
into my Head; and I return'd, Why <HI>Amy, says
I,</HI> is it not possible for me to shift my Being,
from this Part of the Town, and go and live
in another Part of the City, or another Part of
the Country, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as entirely conceal'd as if
I had never been known?</P>
<P>Yes, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I believe it might; but then
you must put off all your Equipages, and Ser∣vants,
Coaches, and Horses; change your Li∣veries,
nay, your own Cloaths, and if it was
possible, your very Face.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says I,</HI> and that's the way <HI>Amy,</HI> and that
I'll do, and that forthwith; for I am not able
to live in this Manner any longer: <HI>Amy</HI> came
into this with a kind of Pleasure particular to
herself, that is to say, with an Eagerness not to
be resisted; for <HI>Amy</HI> was apt to be precipitant
in her Motions, and was for doing it immedi∣ately:
Well, <HI>says I, Amy,</HI> as soon as you will,
but what Course must we take to do it? we
cannot put off Servants, and Coach and Horses,
and every-thing; leave off House-keeping, and
transform ourselves into a new Shape, all in a
Moment; Servants must have Warning, and the
Goods must be sold off, and a thousand things,
and this began to perplex us, and in particular,
took us up two or three Days Consideration.</P>
<P>At last, <HI>Amy,</HI> who was a clever Manager in
such Cases, came to me with a Scheme, as she
call'd it; I have found it out, Madam, <HI>says she;</HI>
I have found a Scheme how you shall, if you
<PB N="257" REF="262"/>
have a-mind to it, begin, and finish a perfect
entire Change of your Figure and Circumstances,
in one Day; and shall be as much unknown,
Madam, in twenty-four Hours, as you wou'd be
in so many Years.</P>
<P>Come <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> let us hear it, for you please
me mightily with the Thoughts of it: Why then,
<HI>says Amy,</HI> let me go into the City this Afternoon,
and I'll enquire out some honest, plain, sober Fa∣mily,
where I will take Lodgings for you, as for
a Country-Gentlewoman that desires to be in <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
for about half a Year, and to Board yourself
and a Kinswoman, that is half a Servant, half a
Companion, meaning myself; and so agree with
them by the Month.</P>
<P>To this Lodging (if I hit upon one to your
Mind) you may go to-Morrow Morning, in a
Hackney-Coach, with no-body but me, and leave
such Cloaths and Linnen as you think fit; but to
be sure, the plainest you have, and then you are
remov'd at once, you need never so much as set
your Foot in this House again, (meaning where
we then were) or see any-body belonging to it;
in the mean time I'll let the Servants know, that
you are going over to <HI>Holland</HI> upon extraordinary
Business, and will leave off your Equipages, and so
I'll give them Warning, or, if they will accept of it,
give them a Month's Wages; then I'll sell off your
Furniture as well as I can; as to your Coach, it
is but having it new-painted, and the Lining
chang'd, and getting new Harness and Hammer-Cloths,
and you may keep it still, or dispose of
it, as you think fit; and only take care to let
this Lodging be in some remote Part of the Town,
and you may be as perfectly unknown, as if you
had never been in <HI>England</HI> in your Life.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="263"/>
This was <HI>Amy</HI>'s Scheme; and it pleas'd me so
well, that I resolv'd not only to let her go, but
was resolv'd to go with her myself; but <HI>Amy</HI> put
me off of that, because, <HI>she said,</HI> she shou'd have
Occasion to hurry up-and-down so long, that if
I was with her, it wou'd rather hinder than far∣ther
her; so I wav'd it.</P>
<P>In a word, <HI>Amy</HI> went, and was gone five long
Hours; but when she came back, I cou'd see by
her Countenance, that her Success had been suita∣ble
to her Pains; for she came laughing and gaping,
O Madam! <HI>says she,</HI> I have pleas'd you to the
Life; and with that, she tells me how she had
fix'd upon a House in a Court in the <HI>Minories;</HI>
that she was directed to it meerly by Accident;
that it was a Female Family, the Master of the
House being gone to <HI>New-England;</HI> and that the
Woman had four Children; kept two Maids, and
liv'd very handsomely, but wanted Company to
divert her; and that on that very account, she had
agreed to take Boarders.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> agreed for a good handsome Price, because
she was resolv'd I shou'd be us'd well; so she
bargain'd to give her 35 <HI>l.</HI> for the Half-Year, and
50 <HI>l.</HI> if we took a Maid, leaving that to my choice;
and that we might be satisfied we shou'd meet
with nothing very gay; the People were QUAKERS,
and I lik'd them the better.</P>
<P>I was so pleas'd, that I resolv'd to go with <HI>Amy</HI> the
next Day to see the Lodgings, and to see the Wo∣man
of the House, and see how I lik'd them; but
if I was pleas'd with the general, I was much more
pleas'd with the particulars; for the Gentlewoman,
I must call her so, tho' she was a QUAKER, was
a most courteous, obliging, mannerly Person; per∣fectly
well-bred, and perfectly well-humour'd, and
in short, the most agreeable Conversation that ever
<PB N="259" REF="264"/>
I met with; and which was worth all, so grave,
and yet so pleasant and so merry, that 'tis scarce
possible for me to express how I was pleas'd and
delighted with her Company; and particularly, I
was so pleas'd, that I wou'd go away no more;
so I e'en took up my Lodging there the very first
Night.</P>
<P>In the mean time, tho' it took up <HI>Amy</HI> almost a
Month so entirely, to put off all the Appearan∣ces
of House-keeping, as above; it need take me
up no Time to relate it; 'tis enough to say, that
<HI>Amy</HI> quitted all that Part of the World, and came
Pack and Package to me, and here we took up
our Abode.</P>
<P>I was now in a perfect Retreat indeed; remote
from the Eyes of all that ever had seen me, and
as much out of the way of being ever seen or
heard-of by any of the Gang that us'd to follow
me, as if I had been among the Mountains in <HI>Lan∣cashire;</HI>
for when did a Blue Garter, or a Coach-and-Six
come into a little narrow Passage in the
<HI>Minories,</HI> or <HI>Goodman's-Fields?</HI> And as there was
no Fear of them, so really I had no Desire to see
them, or so much as to hear from them any-more,
as long as I liv'd.</P>
<P>I seem'd in a little Hurry while <HI>Amy</HI> came and
went, so every-Day, at first; but when that was
over, I liv'd here perfectly retir'd, and with a most
pleasant and agreeable Lady; I must call her so,
for tho' a QUAKER, she had a full Share of
good Breeding, sufficient to her, if she had been
a Dutchess; in a word, she was the most agreeable
Creature in her Conversation, <HI>as I said before,</HI>
that ever I met with.</P>
<P>I pretended, after I had been there some time,
to be extreamly in Love with the Dress of the
QUAKERS, and this pleas'd her so much, that
<PB N="260" REF="265"/>
she woul'd needs dress me up one Day in a Suit of
her own Cloaths; but my real Design was, to see
whether it wou'd pass upon me for a Disguise.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was struck with the Novelty, tho' I had
not mention'd my Design to her, and when the
QUAKER was gone out of the Room, says <HI>Amy,</HI>
I guess your Meaning; it is a perfect Disguise to
you; why you look quite another-body, I shou'd
not have known you myself; nay, says <HI>Amy,</HI> more
than that, it makes you look ten Years younger
than you did.</P>
<P>Nothing cou'd please me better than that; and
when <HI>Amy</HI> repeated it, I was so fond of it, that
I ask'd my QUAKER, (I won't call her Landlady,
'tis indeed, too course a Word for her, and she
deserv'd a much better) I say, I ask'd her if she
wou'd fell it; I told her, I was so fond of it, that
I wou'd give her enough to buy her a better Suit;
she declin'd it at first, but I soon perceiv'd that
it was chiefly in good Manners, because I shou'd
not dishonour myself, as she call'd it, to put on
her old Cloaths; but if I pleas'd to accept of
them, she wou'd give me them for my dressing-Cloaths,
and go with me, and buy a Suit for me,
that might be better-worth my wearing.</P>
<P>But as I convers'd in a very frank open Manner
with her, I bid her do the like with me; that I
made no Scruples of such things; but that if she
wou'd let me have them, I wou'd satisfie her; so
she let me know what they cost, and to make her
amends, I gave her three Guineas more than they
cost her.</P>
<P>This good (tho' unhappy) QUAKER had the Mis∣fortune
to have had a bad Husband, and he was
gone beyond-Sea; she had a good House, and
well-furnish'd, and had some Jointure of her own
Estate, which supported her and her Children, so
<PB N="261" REF="266"/>
that she did not want; but she was not at-all above
such a Help, as my being there was to her; so she
was as glad of me, as I was of her.</P>
<P>However, as I knew there was no way to fix
this new Acquaintance, like making myself a Friend
to her, I began with making her some handsome
Presents, and the like to her Children; and first,
opening my Bundles one Day in my Chamber, I
heard her in another Room, and call'd her in, with
a kind of familiar way; there I show'd her some of
my fine Cloaths, and having among the rest of my
things, a Piece of very fine new Holland, which I
had bought a little before, worth about 9 <HI>s.</HI> an
Ell, I pull'd it out, <HI>Here, my Friend,</HI> says I, <HI>I will
make you a Present, if you will accept of it;</HI> and with
that I laid the Piece of Holland in her Lap.</P>
<P>I cou'd see she was surpriz'd, and that she
cou'd hardly speak; <HI>What dost thou mean?</HI> says
she; <HI>indeed I cannot have the Face to accept so fine a
Present as this;</HI> adding, <HI>'Tis fit for thy own Ʋse
but 'tis above my Wear, indeed:</HI> I thought she had
meant she must not wear it so fine, because she
was a QUAKER; so I return'd, Why, do not
you QUAKERS wear fine Linnen neither? Yes,
<HI>says she,</HI> we wear fine Linnen when we can afford
it, but this is too good for me: However, I made
her take it, and she was very thankful too; but my
End was answer'd another Way; for by this I en∣gag'd
her so, that as I found her a Woman of Un∣derstanding,
and of Honesty too, I might, upon
any Occasion, have a Confidence in her, which
was indeed, what I very much wanted.</P>
<P>By accustoming myself to converse with her,
I had not only learn'd to dress like a QUAKER,
but so us'd myself to THEE and THOU, that
I talk'd like a QUAKER too, as readily and naturally
as if I had been born among them; and, in a word,
<PB N="262" REF="267"/>
I pass'd for a QUAKER among all People that did
not know me; I went but little Abroad, but I had
been so us'd to a Coach, that I knew not how well
to go without one; besides, I thought it wou'd
be a farther Disguise to me, so I told my Quaker-Friend
one Day, that I thought I liv'd too close
that I wanted Air; she propos'd taking a Hackney-Coach
sometimes, or a Boat; but I told her, I
had always had a Coach of my own, till now,
and I cou'd find in my Heart to have one again.</P>
<P>She seem'd to think it strange at first, consider∣ing
how close I liv'd, but had nothing to say when
she found I did not value the Expence; so in short,
I resolv'd I wou'd have a Coach: When we came
to talk of Equipages; she extoll'd the having all
things plain; I said so too; so I left it to her Di∣rection,
and a Coach-Maker was sent for, and he
provided me a plain Coach, no gilding or painting,
lin'd with a light-grey Cloath, and my Coachman
had a Coat of the same, and no Lace on his Hat.</P>
<P>When all was ready, I dress'd myself in the
Dress I bought of her, <HI>and said,</HI> Come, I'll be a
QUAKER to-Day, and you and I'll go Abroad;
which we did, and there was not a QUAKER in the
Town look'd less like a Counterfeit than I did:
But all this was my particular Plot to be the more
compleatly conceal'd, and that I might depend
upon being not known, and yet need not be con∣fin'd
like a Prisoner, and be always in Fear; so
that all the rest was Grimace.</P>
<P>We liv'd here very casie and quiet, and yet I
cannot say I was so in my Mind; I was like a
Fish out of Water; I was as gay, and as young
in my Disposition, as I was at five and twenty;
and as I had always been courted, flatter'd, and
us'd to love it, so I miss'd it in my Conversation;
and this put me many times, upon looking-back up∣on
on things past.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="268"/>
I had very few Moments in my Life, which
in their Reflection, afforded me any-thing but
Regret; but of all the foolish Actions I had to
look back upon in my Life, none look'd so pre∣posterous,
and so like Distraction, nor left so much
Mclancholly on my Mind, as my Parting with
my Friend, the <HI>Merchant of Paris,</HI> and the refu∣sing
him upon such honourable and just Conditi∣ons
as he had offer'd; and tho' on his just (which
I call'd unkind) rejecting my Invitation to come
to him again, I had look'd on him with some
Disgust, yet now my Mind run upon him continu∣ally,
and the ridiculous Conduct of my refusing
him, and I cou'd never be satified about him;
I flatter'd myself, that if I cou'd but see him, I
cou'd yet Master him, and that he wou'd presently
forget all that had pass'd, that might be thought
unkind; but as there was no room to imagine
any-thing like that to be possible, I threw those
Thoughts off again as much as I cou'd.</P>
<P>However, they continually return'd, and I had
no Rest Night or Day, for thinking of him, who
I had forgot above eleven Years. I told <HI>Amy</HI> of
<HI>it,</HI> and we talk'd it over sometimes in-Bed, al∣most
whole Nights together; at last, <HI>Amy</HI> started
a thing of her own Head, which put it in a Way of
Management, tho' a wild one too: <HI>You are so
uneasie, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> about this Mr.—,
the Merchant at</HI> Paris; <HI>Come,</HI> says she, <HI>if you'll
give me Leave, I'll go over, and see what's become
of him.</HI></P>
<P>Not for ten Thousand Pounds, <HI>said I;</HI> no, nor
if you met him in the Street, not to offer to speak
to him on my Account: No, <HI>says Amy,</HI> I wou'd
not speak to him at-all, or if I did, I warrant you
it shall not look to be upon your Account; I'll
only enquire after him, and if he is in Being,
<PB N="264" REF="269"/>
you shall hear of it him; if not, you shall hear
of him still, and that may be enough.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>says I,</HI> if you will promise me not to en∣ter
into any-thing relating to me, with him; nor
to begin any Discourse at-all, unless he begins it
with you, I cou'd almost, be perswaded to let you
go and try.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> promis'd me all that I desir'd; and, in a
word, to cut the Story short, I let her go; but ty'd
her up to so many Particulars, that it was almost
impossible, her going cou'd signifie any-thing; and
had she intended to observe them, she might as
well have staid at-home as have gone; for I charg'd
her, if she came to see him, she shou'd not so
much as take Notice that she knew him again; and
if he spoke to her, she shou'd tell him, she was
come away from me a great-many Years ago, and
knew nothing what was become of me; that she
had been come-over to <HI>France</HI> six Years ago, and
was marry'd there, and liv'd at <HI>Calais,</HI> or to that
Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> promis'd me nothing indeed; for, <HI>as she
said,</HI> it was impossible for her to resolve what wou'd
be fit to do, or not to do, till she was there, upon
the Spot, and had found out the Gentleman, or
heard of him; but that then, if I wou'd trust her,
as I had always done, she wou'd answer for it, that
she wou'd do nothing but what shou'd be for my
Interest, and what she wou'd hope I shou'd be very
well pleas'd with.</P>
<P>With this general Commission, <HI>Amy,</HI> notwith∣standing
she had been so frighted at the Sea, ven∣tur'd
her Carcass once more by Water, and away
she goes to <HI>France;</HI> she had four Articles of Con∣fidence
in Charge to enquire after, for me; and as
I found by her, she had one for herself; I say, four
for me, because tho' her <HI>first</HI> and principal Erran'd
<PB N="265" REF="270"/>
was, to inform herself of my <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant;
yet I gave her in Charge to enquire, 2. After my
Husband, who I left a Trooper in the <HI>Gensd' arms.</HI>
3. After that Rogue of a <HI>Jew,</HI> whose very Name
I hated, and of whose Face I had such a fright∣ful
<HI>Idea,</HI> that <HI>Sathan</HI> himself cou'd not counter∣feit
a worse: And <HI>Lastly,</HI> After my Foreign Prince:
And she discharg'd herself very well of them all,
tho' not so successful as I wish'd.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> had a very good Passage over the Sea, and
I had a Letter from her, from <HI>Calais,</HI> in three
Days after she went from <HI>London:</HI> When she came
to <HI>Paris,</HI> she wrote me an Account, that as to her
first and most important Enquiry, which was after
the <HI>Dutch <HI>Merchant;</HI></HI> her Account was, That he
had return'd to <HI>Paris;</HI> liv'd three Years there, and
quitting that City, went to live at <HI>Roan:</HI> So away
goes <HI>Amy</HI> for <HI>Roan.</HI></P>
<P>But as she was going to bespeak a Place in the
Coach to <HI>Roan,</HI> she meets very accidentally in the
Street, with her Gentleman, <HI>as I call'd him;</HI> that
is to say, the Prince <HI>de</HI>—'<HI>s</HI> Gentleman, who
had been her Favourite, <HI>as above.</HI></P>
<P>You may be sure there were several other kind
Things happen'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and him, as you
shall hear afterwards: But the two main things
were, 1. That <HI>Amy</HI> enquir'd about his Lord, and
had a full Account of him; of which presently;
and in the next Place, telling him whither she was
going, and for what; he bade her not go yet, for
that he wou'd have a particular Account of it the
next Day, from a Merchant that knew him; and
accordingly he brought her word the next Day,
that he had been for six Years before that, gone
for <HI>Holland,</HI> and that he liv'd there still.</P>
<P>This, <HI>I say,</HI> was the first News from <HI>Amy,</HI> for
some time, <HI>I mean,</HI> about my Merchant: In the
<PB N="266" REF="271"/>
mean time, <HI>Amy, as I have said,</HI> enquir'd about
the other Persons she had in her Instructions: As
for the Prince, the Gentleman told her, he was gone
into <HI>Germany,</HI> where his Estate lay, and that he
liv'd there; that he had made great Enquiry af∣ter
me; that he (his Gentleman) had made all
the Search he had been able, for me; but that he
cou'd not hear of me; but that, he believ'd if his
Lord had known I had been in <HI>England,</HI> he wou'd
have gone over to me; but that, after long En∣quiry,
he was oblig'd to give it over; but that
he verily believ'd, if he cou'd have found me, he
wou'd have married me; and that he was ex∣tremely
concern'd that he cou'd hear nothing of me.</P>
<P>I was not at-all satisfied with <HI>Amy's</HI> Account,
but order'd her to go to <HI>Roan</HI> herself; which she
did, and there with much Difficulty, (the Person
she was directed to being dead) I say, with much
Difficulty, she came to be inform'd, that my Mer∣chant
had liv'd there two Years, or something
more; but that having met with a very great
Misfortune, he had gone back to <HI>Holland, as the</HI>
French <HI>Merchant said,</HI> where he had staid two
Years; but with this Addition, <HI>viz.</HI> that he came
back-again to <HI>Roan,</HI> and liv'd in good Reputation
there another Year; and afterwards, he was gone
to <HI>England:</HI> and that he liv'd in <HI>London:</HI> But
<HI>Amy</HI> cou'd by no means learn how to write to
him there, till by great Accident, an old <HI>Dutch</HI>
Skipper, who had formerly serv'd him, coming
to <HI>Roan, Amy</HI> was told of it; and he told her,
that he lodg'd in St. <HI>Lawrence Pountncy's-Lane,</HI> in
<HI>London;</HI> but was to be seen every Day upon the
<HI>Exchange,</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Walk.</P>
<P>This <HI>Amy</HI> thought it was time enough to tell
me of, when she came over; and besides she did
not find this <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, till she had spent
<PB N="267" REF="272"/>
four or five Months, and been again at <HI>Paris,</HI>
and then come back to <HI>Roan</HI> for farther Infor∣mation:
But in the mean time she wrote me
from <HI>Paris,</HI> that he was not to be found by any
means; that he had been gone from <HI>Paris</HI> seven
or eight Years; that she was told he had liv'd
at <HI>Roan,</HI> and she was a-going thither to enquire,
but that she had heard afterward, that he was
gone also from thence to <HI>Holland,</HI> so she did
not go.</P>
<P>This, I say, was <HI>Amy's</HI> first Account; and I
not satisfied with it, had sent her an Order to
go to <HI>Roan,</HI> to enquire there also <HI>as above.</HI></P>
<P>While this was negociating, and I received
these Accounts from <HI>Amy</HI> at several times, a strange
Adventure happen'd to me, which I must men∣tion
just here; I had been Abroad to take the
Air, as usual, with my QUAKER, as far as <HI>Epping-Forrest,</HI>
and we were driving back towards <HI>London;</HI>
when on the Road between <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Mile-End,</HI>
two Gentlemen on Horseback came riding-by,
having over-taken the Coach, and pass'd it, and
went forwards towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>They did not ride apace, tho' they pass'd the
Coach, for we went very softly, nor did they
look into the Coach at-all, but rode side by side,
earnestly talking to one another, and linclining
their Faces side-ways a little towards one another,
he that went nearest the Coach, with his Face
from it, and he that was farthest from the Coach,
with his Face towards it, and passing in the
very next Tract to the Coach, I could hear
them talk <HI>Dutch</HI> very distinctly; but it is im∣possible
to describe the Confusion I was in, when
I plainly saw that the farthest of the two, him
whose Face look'd towards the Coach, was my
Friend, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="273"/>
If it had been possible to conceal my Disor∣der
from my Friend, the QUAKER, I would have
done it, but I found she was too well accquaint∣ed
with such things, not to take the Hint;
dost Thou understand <HI>Dutch? said she; Why? said
I; Why, says she,</HI> 'tis easie to suppose that Thou art
a little concern'd at somewhat those Men say;
I suppose they are talking of Thee: Indeed my
good Friend, <HI>said I,</HI> thou art mistaken this time, for
I know very well what they are talking of, but
'tis all about Ships, and Trading Affairs: Well,
<HI>says she,</HI> then one of them is a Man-Friend of
Thine, or somewhat is the Case; for tho' thy
Tongue will not confess it, thy Face does.</P>
<P>I was going to have told a bold Lye, and said,
I knew nothing of them, but I found it was
impossible to conceal it, so <HI>I said,</HI> indeed, I think
I know the farthest of them; but I have neither
spoken to him, or so much as seen him for above 11
Years: Well then, <HI>says she,</HI> Thou hast seen him with
more than common Eyes, when thou did'st see
him; or else seeing him now would not be such
a Surprize to Thee: Indeed, <HI>said I,</HI> 'tis true I am
a little surpriz'd at seeing him just now, for I
thought he had been in quite another Part of
the World; and I can assure you, I never saw
him in <HI>England</HI> in my Life: Well then, 'tis the
more likely he is come over now on purpose to
seek Thee: No, no, <HI>said I,</HI> Knight-Errantry is over,
Women are not so hard to come at, that Men
should not be able to please themselves without
running from one Kingdom to another: Well,
well, <HI>says she,</HI> I would have him see Thee for-all
that, as plainly as Thou hast seen him; No,
but he shan't, <HI>says I,</HI> for I am sure he don't
know me in this Dress, and I'll take Care he
shan't see my Face, if I can help it; so I held up
<PB N="269" REF="274"/>
my Fan before my Face, and she saw me resolute
in that, so she press'd me no farther.</P>
<P>We had several Discourses upon the Subject,
but still I let her know I was resolv'd he should
not know me; but, at last, I confess'd so
much, that tho' I would not let him know who
I was, or where I liv'd, I did not care if I knew
where he liv'd, and how I might enquire about
him: She took the Hint immediately, and her
Servant being behind the Coach, she call'd him
to the Coach-side, and bade him keep his Eye
upon that Gentleman, and as soon as the Coach
came to the End of <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> he should
get down, and follow him closely, so as to see
where he put up his Horse, and then to go
into the Inn, and enquire, if he could, who he
was, and where he liv'd.</P>
<P>The Fellow follow'd diligently to the Gate
of an Inn in <HI>Bishopsgate-Street,</HI> and seeing him go
in, made no doubt but he had him fast, but
was confounded, when upon Enquiry he found
the Inn was a Thorowfare into another Street,
and that the two Gentlemen had only rode tho∣row
the Inn, as the Way to the Street where they
were going, and so, in short, came back no wiser
than he went.</P>
<P>My kind QUAKER was more vex'd at the Dis∣appointment,
at least apparently so, than I was;
and asking the Fellow, if he was sure he knew
the Gentlemen again if he saw him; the Fellow
said, he had follow'd him so close, and took so
much Notice of him, in order to do his Errand
as it ought to be done, that he was very sure
he should know him again; and that besides, he
was sure he should know his Horse.</P>
<P>This Part was, indeed, likely enough; and the
kind QUAKER, without telling me any-thing of
<PB N="270" REF="275"/>
the Matter, caus'd her Man to place himself just
at the corner of <HI>Whitechappel-Church-Wall</HI> every
<HI>Saturday</HI> in the Afternoon, that being the Day
when the Citizens chiefly ride Abroad to take the
Air; and there to watch all the Afternoon, and
look for him.</P>
<P>It was not till the fifth <HI>Saturday,</HI> that her Man
came, with a great deal of Joy, and gave her an
Account, that he had found out the Gentleman;
that he was a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> but a <HI>French</HI> Merchant;
that he came from <HI>Roan,</HI> and his Name was—;
and that he lodg'd at Mr.—on <HI>Lawrence Pount∣nery's-Hill:</HI>
I was surpriz'd, you may be sure, when
she came and told me one Evening, all the Particu∣lars,
except that of having set her Man to watch
I have found out thy <HI>Dutch</HI> Friend, <HI>says she,</HI> and
can tell THEE how to find him too; I colour'd
again as red as Fire: Then THOU hast dealt with
the Evil One, Friend, <HI>said I very gravely:</HI> No, no,
<HI>says she,</HI> I have no Familiar; but I tell Thee, I
have found him for Thee, and his Name is <HI>so and
so</HI> and he lives as above recited.</P>
<P>I was surpriz'd again at this, not being able to
imagine how she shou'd come to know all this:
However, to put me out of Pain, she told me
what she had done; well, <HI>said I,</HI> Thou art very
kind, but this is not worth thy Pains; for now
I know it, 'tis only to satisfie my Curiosity, for I
shall not send to him upon any Account: Be that
as thou wilt, <HI>says she;</HI> besides, <HI>added she,</HI> Thou
art in the right to say; so to me; for, why shou'd
I be trusted with it? tho' if I were, <HI>I assure thee,</HI> I
shou'd not betray thee: That is very kind, <HI>said I,</HI>
and I believe thee; and assure They-self, if I do
send to him, Thou shalt know it, and be trusted
with it too.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="276"/>
During this Interval of five Weeks, I suffer'd a
hundred Thousand Perplexities of Mind; I was
thorowly convinc'd I was right as to the Person,
that it was the Man; I knew him so well, and
saw him so plain, I cou'd not be deceiv'd: I drove
out again in the Coach, (<HI>on Pretence of Air</HI>) al∣most
every-Day, in hopes of seeing him again,
but was never so lucky as to see him; and now
I had made the Discovery, I was as far to seek
what Measures to take, as I was before.</P>
<P>To send to him, or speak to him first, if I
shou'd see him, so as to be known to him, that I
resolv'd not to do, if I dy'd for it; to watch
him about his Lodging, that was as much be∣low
my Spirit as the other; so that, <HI>in a word,</HI>
I was at a perfect Loss how to act, or what to do.</P>
<P>At length came <HI>Amy</HI>'s Letter, with the last Ac∣count
which she had at <HI>Roan,</HI> from the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Skipper, which confirming the other, left me out
of Doubt that this <HI>was my Man;</HI> but still, no hu∣mane
Invention cou'd bring me to the Speech of
him, in such a manner as wou'd suit with my
Resolutions; for <HI>after all,</HI> how did I know what
his Circumstances were? whether marry'd or sin∣gle?
and if he had a Wife, I know he was so
honest a Man, he wou'd not so much as converse
with me, or so much as know me, if he met me
in the Street.</P>
<P>In the next Place, as he had entirely neglected
me, which, in short, is the worst Way of slight∣ing
a Woman, and had given no Answer to my
Letters, I did not know but he might be the same
Man still; so I resolv'd, that I cou'd do nothing
in it, unless some fairer Opportunity presented,
which might make my Way clearer to me; for I
was determin'd he shou'd have no room to put
any more Slights upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="277"/>
In these Thoughts I pass'd away near three
Months; till at last, (being impatient) I resolv'd
to send for <HI>Amy</HI> to come Over, and tell her how
things stood, and that I wou'd do nothing till she
came; <HI>Amy</HI> in Answer sent me word, she wou'd
come away with all speed, but begg'd of me, that
I wou'd enter into no Engagement with him, or
any-body, till she arriv'd; but still keeping me in
the dark, as to the thing itself, which she had to
say, at which I was heartily vex'd, for many
Reasons.</P>
<P>But while all these things were transacting, and
Letters and Answers pass'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and I
a little slower than usual, at which I was not so
well pleas'd as I us'd to be with <HI>Amy</HI>'s Dispatch;
<HI>I say,</HI> in this time the following Scene open'd.</P>
<P>It was one Afternoon, about four a-Clock, my
Friendly QUAKER and I sitting in her Cham∣ber
up-stairs, and very chearful, chatting together,
(<HI>for she was the best Company in the World</HI>) when
somebody ringing hastily at the Door, and no Ser∣vant
just then in the way, she ran down <HI>herself,</HI>
to the Door; when a Gentleman appears with a
Footman attending, and making some Apologies,
which she did not thorowly understand, he speak∣ing
but broken <HI>English;</HI> he ask'd to speak with
me, by the very same Name that I went by in her
House; which, <HI>by the way,</HI> was not the Name
that he had known me by.</P>
<P>She, with very civil Language, <HI>in her way,</HI> brought
him into a very handsome Parlour below-stairs,
<HI>and said,</HI> she wou'd go and see whether the Person
who lodg'd in her House own'd that Name, and
he shou'd hear farther.</P>
<P>I was a little surpriz'd, even before I knew any∣thing
of who it was, my Mind foreboding the
thing as it happen'd; (<HI>whence that arises, let the
<PB N="273" REF="278"/>
Naturalists explain to us</HI>) but I was frighted, and
ready to die, when my QUAKER came up all
gay, and crowing; <HI>There,</HI> says she, <HI>is the</HI> Dutch
French <HI>Merchant come to see Thee:</HI> I cou'd not speak
one Word to her, nor stir off of my Chaur, but
sat as motionless as a Statue: She talk'd a thousand
pleasant things to me, but they made no Impression
on me; at last she pull'd me, and teiz'd me, <HI>Come,
come,</HI> says she, <HI>be thy self, and rouze up,</HI> I must go
down again to him; what shall I say to him? say,
<HI>said I,</HI> that you have no such-body in the House:
That I cannot do, <HI>says she, because it is not the
Truth;</HI> besides, I have own'd Thou art above;
<HI>Come, come, go down with me;</HI> not for a thousand
Guineas, <HI>said I;</HI> well, <HI>says she,</HI> I'll go and tell him
Thou wilt come quickly; so, without giving me
Time to answer her, away she goes.</P>
<P>A Million of Thoughts circulated in my Head
while she was gone, and what to do I cou'd not
tell; I saw no Remedy but I must speak with
him, but wou'd have given 500 <HI>l.</HI> to have shun'd
it; yet, had I shun'd it, perhaps then, I wou'd
have given 500 <HI>l.</HI> again, that I had seen him:
Thus fluctuating, and unconcluding, were my
Thoughts; what I so earnestly desir'd, I declin'd
when it offer'd itself; and what now I pretended
to decline, was nothing but what I had been at
the Expence of 40 or 50 <HI>l.</HI> to send <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>France</HI>
for; and even without any View, or indeed, any
rational Expectation of bringing it to pass; and
what, for half a Year before, I was so uneasie a∣bout,
that I cou'd not be quiet Night or Day,
till <HI>Amy</HI> propos'd to go over to enquire after him:
In short, my Thoughts were all confus'd, and
in the utmost Disorder; I had once refus'd, and re∣jected
him, and I repented it heartily; then I had
taken ill his Silence, and in my Mind rejected him
<PB N="274" REF="279"/>
again, but had repented that too: Now I had
stoop'd so low as to send after him into <HI>France,</HI>
which if he had known, perhaps, he had never
come after me; and shuou'd I reject him a third
time! On the other-hand, he had repented too in
his Turn, perhaps, and not knowing how I had
acted, either in stooping to send in Search after
him, or in the wickeder Part of my Life, was
come over hither to seek me again; and I might
take him perhaps, with the same Advantages as
I might have done before, and wou'd I now be
backward to see him! Well, while I was in this
Hurry, my Friend the QUAKER, comes up again,
and perceiving the Confusion I was in, she runs to
her Closet, and fetch'd me a little pleasant Cor∣dial,
but <HI>I wou'd not taste it: O</HI> says he, <HI>I under∣stand
Thee, be not uneasie, I'll give thee something shall
take off all the Smell of it; if he kisses Thee a thou∣sand
times, he shall be no wiser;</HI> I thought with my∣self,
Thou art perfectly acquainted with Affairs of
this Nature, I think you must govern me now, so
I began to incline to go down with her; upon that,
I took the Cordial, and she gave me a kind of
spicey Preserve after it, whose Flavour was so
strong, and yet so deliciously pleasant, that it
wou'd cheat the nicest Smelling, and it left not
the least taint of the Cordial on the Breath.</P>
<P>Well, after this, (<HI>tho' with some Hesitation still</HI>)
I went down a Pair of Back-stairs with her, and
into a Dining-Room, next to the Parlour in which
he was; but there I halted, and desir'd she wou'd
let me consider of it a little: <HI>Well, do so,</HI> says he,
and left me with more readiness than she did be∣fore;
<HI>do, consider, and I'll come to Thee again.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' I hung back with an awkwardness that
was really unseign'd, yet when she so readily left
me, I thought it was not so kind, and I began to
<PB N="275" REF="280"/>
think she should have press'd me still on to it;
so foolishly backward are we, to the thing, which
of all the World we most desire; mocking our∣selves
with a feign'd Reluctance, when the Nega∣tive
wou'd be Death to us; but she was too cun∣ning
for me, for while I, as it were, blam'd her in
my Mind, for not carrying me to him, tho' at the
same time I appear'd backward to see him; on a
sudden she unlocks the Folding-Doors, which
look'd into the next Parlour, and throwing them
open, <HI>There,</HI> says she, (ushering him in) <HI>is the Per∣son
who, I suppose, thou enquirest for;</HI> and the same
Moment, with a kind Decency she retir'd, and that
so swift, that she wou'd not give us leave, hard∣ly,
to know which Way she went.</P>
<P>I stood up, but was confounded with a sudden
Enquiry in my Thoughts, how I shou'd receive
him? and with a Resolution as swift as Lightning,
in Answer to it, <HI>said to myself,</HI> It shall be COLDLY;
so, on a sudden, I put on an Air of Stiffness and
Ceremony, and held it for about two Minutes;
but it was with great Difficulty.</P>
<P>He restrain'd himself too, on the other-hand,
came towards me gravely, and saluted me in
Form; but it was, it seems, upon his supposing
the QUAKER was behind him, whereas she, <HI>as I
said,</HI> understood things too well, and had retir'd,
as if she had vanish'd, that we might have full
Freedom; for, <HI>as she said afterwards,</HI> she suppos'd
we had seen one-another before, tho' it might have
have been a great-while ago.</P>
<P>Whatever Stiffness I had put on my Behaviour
to him, I was surpriz'd in my Mind, and angry at
his, and began to wonder what kind of a ceremo∣nious
Meeting it was to be: However, after he
perceiv'd the Woman was gone, he made a kind
of a Hesitation, looking a little round him; <HI>In∣deed,
<PB N="276" REF="281"/>
deed,</HI> said he, <HI>I thought the Gentlewoman was not
withdrawn,</HI> and with that, he took me in his Arms,
and kiss'd me three or four times; but I that was
prejudic'd to the last Degree, with the coldness
of his first Salutes, when I did not know the
Cause of it, cou'd not be thorowly clear'd of the
Prejudice, tho' I did know the Cause; and thought
that even his return, and taking me in his Arms,
did not seem to have the same Ardour with which
he us'd to receive me, and this made me behave
to him awkwardly, <HI>and I know not how,</HI> for a good∣white;
<HI>but this by the way.</HI></P>
<P>He began with a kind of an Extasie upon the
Subject of his finding me out; how it was pos∣sible
that he shou'd have been four Years in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and had us'd all the Ways imaginable, and
cou'd never so much as have the least Intimation of
me, or of any-one like me; and that it was now
above two Years that he had despair'd of it, and
had given over all Enquiry; and that now he
shou'd chop upon me, as it were, unlook'd and
unsought-for.</P>
<P>I cou'd easily have accounted for his not finding
me, if I had but set down the Detail of my real
Retirement; but I gave it a new, and indeed, a
truly hypocritical Turn; I told him, that any-one
that knew the manner of Life I led, might ac∣count
for his not finding me; that the Retreat I
had taken up, wou'd have render'd it a hundred
Thousand to one odds that he ever found me at-all;
that as I had abandon'd all Conversation;
up another Name; liv'd remote from <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and had not preserv'd one Acquaintance in
it; it was no wonder he had not met with me;
that even my Dress wou'd let him see, that I did
not desire to be known by any-body.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="282"/>
Then he ask'd if I had not receiv'd some Let∣ters
from him? I told him, No, he had not
thought fit to give me the Civility of an Answer
to the last I wrote to him; and he cou'd not sup∣pose
I shou'd expect a Return, after a Silence in a
Case where I had laid myself so low, and expos'd
myself in a Manner I had never been us'd to; that
indeed, I had never sent for any Letters after that,
to the Place where I had order'd his to be di∣rected;
and that being so Justly, as I thought, pu∣nish'd
for my Weakness, I had nothing to do, but
to repent of being a Fool, after I had strictly ad∣her'd
to a just Principle before: That however,
as what I did was rather from Motions of Grati∣tude,
than from real Weakness, however it might
be construed by him, I had the Satisfaction in my∣self
of having fully discharg'd the Debt: <HI>I added,</HI>
that I had not wanted Occasions of all the seeming
Advancements which the pretended Felicity of a
Marriage-Life was usually set-off with, and might
have have been what I desir'd not to name; but
that, however low I had stoop'd to him, I had
maintain'd the Dignity of Female Liberty, against
all the Attacks, either of Pride or Avarice; and
that I had been infinitely oblig'd to him for gi∣ving
me an Opportunity to discharge the only Ob∣ligation
that endanger'd me, without subjecting
me to the Consequence; and that I hop'd he
was satisfied I had paid the Debt, by offering my∣self
to be chain'd; but was infinitely Debtor to
him another way, for letting me remain free.</P>
<P>He was so confounded at this Discourse, that
he knew not what to say, and for a good-while
he stood mute indeed; but recovering himself a
little, <HI>he said,</HI> I run-out into a Discourse he hop'd
was over, and forgotten, and he did not intend to
revive it; that he knew I had not had his Letters,
<PB N="278" REF="283"/>
for that, when he first came to <HI>England,</HI> he had
been at the Place to which they were directed,
and found them all lying there, but one; and that
the People had not known how to deliver them;
that he thought to have had a Direction there,
how to find me, but had the Mortification to be
told, that they did not so much as know who
I was; that he was under a great Disappointment,
and that I ought to know, <HI>in Answer to all my
Resentments,</HI> that he had done a long, and (he
hop'd) a sufficient Pennance for the Slight <HI>that
I had suppos'd</HI> he had put upon me; that it was
true, (<HI>and I cou'd not suppose any other</HI>) that upon
the Repulse I had given him in a Case so circum∣stanc'd
as his was, and after such earnest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and such Offers as he had made me, he went
away with a Mind heartily griev'd, and full of
Resentment; that he had look'd back on the
Crime he had committed, with some Regret, but
on the Cruelty of my Treatment of the poor In∣fant
I went with at that time, with the utmost
Detetation; and that this made him unable to
send an agreeable Answer to me; for which Reason
he had sent none at-all for some time; but that
in about six or seven Months those Resentments
wearing off by the return of his Affection to me,
and his Concern in the poor Child—<HI>there he
stopp'd, and indeed, Tears stood in his Eyes, while in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parenthesis</HI> he only added, <HI>and to this Minute he
did not know whether it was dead or alive;</HI> he then
went on, those Resentments wearing off, he sent
me several Letters, <HI>I think he said,</HI> seven or eight,
but receiv'd no Answer; that then his Business
obliging him to go to <HI>Holland,</HI> he came to <HI>England,</HI>
as in his Way, but found, <HI>as above,</HI> that his Letters
had not been call'd for, but that he left them at
the House after paying the Postage of them; and
<PB N="279" REF="284"/>
going then back to <HI>France,</HI> he was yet uneasie,
and cou'd not refrain the <HI>Knight-Errantry</HI> of co∣ming
to <HI>England</HI> again to seek me, tho' he knew
neither where, or of who, to enquire for me, be∣ing
disappointed in all his Enquiries before: That
he had yet taken up his Residence here, firmly
believing, that one-time or other he shou'd meet
me, or hear of me, and that some kind Chance
wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d at last throw him in my Way; that he
had liv'd thus above four Years, and tho' his
Hopes were vanish'd, yet he had not any Thoughts
of removing any more in the World, unless it
shou'd be at last, as it is with other old Men, he
might have some Inclination to go Home, to die
in his own Country; but that he had not thought
of it yet; that if I wou'd consider all these Steps,
I wou'd find some Reasons to forget his first Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entments,
and to think that Pennance, <HI>as he call'd
it,</HI> which he had undergone in search of me, an
<HI>Amende Honorable,</HI> in Reparation of the Affront
given to the Kindness of my Letter of Invitation;
and that we might at last make ourselves some
Satisfaction on both sides, for the Mortifications
past.</P>
<P>I confess I cou'd not hear all this withot be∣ing
mov'd very much, and yet I continued a little
stiff and formal too, a good-while: <HI>I told him,</HI>
that before I cou'd give him any Reply to the
rest of his Discourse, I ought to give him the
Satisfaction of telling him, <HI>that his Son was alive;</HI>
and that indeed, since I saw him so concern'd a∣bout
it, and mention it with such Affection, I was
sorry that I had not found out some Way or other
to let him know it sooner; but that I thought,
after his slighting the Mother, <HI>as above,</HI> he had
summ'd up his Affection to the Child, in the Let∣ter
he had wrote to me about providing for it;
<PB N="280" REF="285"/>
and that he had, as other Fathers often do, look'd
upon it as a Birth, <HI>which being out of the Way,</HI> was to
be forgotten, as its Beginning was to be repented
of; that in providing sufficiently for it, he had
done more than all such Fathers us'd to do, and
might be well satisfied with it.</P>
<P>He answer'd me, that he shou'd have been very
glad if I had been so good, but to have given him
the Satisfaction of knowing the poor unfortunate
Creature was yet alive, and he wou'd have taken
some Care of it upon himself, and particularly, by
owning it for a legitimate Child, which, where no∣body
had known to the contrary, wou'd have taken
off the Infamy which wou'd otherwise cleave to it;
and so the Child shou'd not, <HI>itself,</HI> have known
any-thing of its own Disaster; but that he fear'd it
was now too late.</P>
<P><HI>He added,</HI> that I might see by all his Conduct
since that, what unhappy Mistake drew him into
the thing at first; and that he wou'd have been
very far from doing the Injury to me, or being
instrumental to add <HI>vne Miserable,</HI> (that was his
Word) to the World, if he had not been drawn
into it, by the Hopes he had of making me his
own; but that, if it was possible to rescue the Child
from the Consequences of its unhappy Birth, he
hop'd I wou'd give him leave to do it, and he
wou'd let me see that he had both Means and
Affection still to do it; and that, notwithstanding
all the Misfortunes that had befallen him, nothing
that belong'd to him, especially by a Mother he
had such a Concern for, as he had for me, shou'd
ever want what he was in a Condition to do for it.</P>
<P>I cou'd not hear this without being sensibly
touch'd with it; I was asham'd that he shou'd
show that he had more real Affection for the Child,
tho' he had never seen it in his Life, than I that
<PB N="281" REF="286"/>
bore it; for indeed, I did not love the Child,
nor love to see it; and tho' I had provided for it,
yet I did it by <HI>Amy</HI>'s Hand, and had not seen it
above twice in four Years; being privately resolv'd
that when it grew up, it shou'd not be able to call
me Mother.</P>
<P>However, <HI>I told him,</HI> the Child was taken Care
of, and that he need not be anxious about it, un∣less
he suspected, that I had less Affection for
it than he, that had never seen it in his Life; that
he knew what I had promis'd him to do for it,
<HI>namely,</HI> to give it the Thousand Pistoles which I
had offer'd him, and which he had declined; <HI>that,
I assur'd him,</HI> I had made my Will, and that I had
left it 5000<HI>l.</HI> and the Interest of it till he shou'd
come of Age, if I died before that time; that I
wou'd still be as good as that to it; but if he
had a-mind to take it from me, into his Govern∣ment,
I wou'd not be against it; and to satisfie
him that I wou'd perform what I said, I wou'd
cause the Child to be deliver'd to him, and the
5000<HI>l.</HI> also for its Support; depending upon it,
that he wou'd show himself a Father to it by
what I saw of his Affection to it, now.</P>
<P>I had observ'd that he had hinted two or three
times in his Discourse, his having had <HI>Misfortunes
in the World</HI> and I was a little surpriz'd at the
Expression, especially at the repeating it so often,
but I took no Notice of that Part yet.</P>
<P>He thank'd me for my Kindness to the Child,
with a Tenderness which shew'd the Sincerity of
all he had said before; and which encrceas'd the
Regret with which, <HI>as I said,</HI> I look'd back on
the little Affection I had shew'd to the poor Child;
<HI>he told me,</HI> he did not desire to take him from me,
but so as to introduce him into the World as his
own; which he cou'd still do, having liv'd absent
<PB N="282" REF="287"/>
from his other Children (for he had two Sons
and a Daughter which were brought up at <HI>Nimeu∣gen</HI>
in <HI>Holland,</HI> with a Sister of his) so long, that
he might very well send another Son of ten Years
old to be bred up with them; and suppose his
Mother to be dead or alive, as he found Occa∣sion;
and that as I had resolv'd to do so hand∣somely
for the Child, he wou'd add to it some∣thing
considerable, tho' having had some great
Disappointments, (<HI>repeating the Words</HI>) he cou'd
not do for it as he wou'd otherwise have done.</P>
<P>I then thought myself oblig'd to take Notice of
his having so often mention'd his having <HI>met with
Disappointments;</HI> I told him, I was very sorry to
hear he had met with any-thing afflicting to him
in the World; that I wou'd not have any-thing
belonging to me, add to his Loss, or weaken him
in what he might do for his other Children;
and that I wou'd not agree to his having the
Child away, <HI>tho' the Proposal was infinitely to the
Child's Advantage,</HI> unless he wou'd promise me,
that the whole Expence shou'd be mine; and that
is he did not think 5000 <HI>l.</HI> enough for the Child,
I wou'd give it more.</P>
<P>We had so much Discourse upon this, <HI>and the old
Affairs,</HI> that it took up all our Time at his first
Visit; I was a little importunate with him, to tell
me how he came to find me out, but he put it
off for that time; and only obtaining my Leave
to visit me again, he went away; and indeed, my
Heart was so full with what he had said already,
that I was glad when he went away; sometimes
I was full of Tenderness and Affection for him,
and especially, when he express'd himself so ear∣nestly
and passionately about the Child; other∣times
I was crowded with Doubts about his Cir∣cumstances;
sometimes I was terrify'd with Ap∣prehensions,
<PB N="283" REF="288"/>
let if I shou'd come into a close Cor∣respondence
with him, he shou'd any-way come
to hear what kind of Life I had led at <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI>
and in other Places, and it might make me mise∣rable
asterwards; from which last Thought I con∣concluded,
that I had better repulse him again,
than receive him: All these Thoughts, and many
more, crowded in so fast, <HI>I say,</HI> upon me, that I
wanted to give Vent to them, and get rid of him,
and was very glad when he was gone away.</P>
<P>We had several Meetings after this, in which
still we had so many Preliminaries to go through,
that we scarce ever border'd upon the main Sub∣ject;
once indeed, he said something of it, and I
put it off with a kind of a Jest; alas! <HI>says I,</HI> those
things are out of the Question now; 'tis almost
two Ages since those things were talk'd between
us, <HI>says I;</HI> you see I am grown <HI>an Old-Woman</HI>
since that: Another time he gave a little Push at
it again, and I laugh'd again; <HI>Why what dost thou
talk of,</HI> said I, in a formal way, <HI>Dost thou not see I
am turn'd</HI> QUAKER? <HI>I cannot speak of those things
now: Why,</HI> says he, the QUAKERS marry as well
as other People, and love one-another as well; be∣sides,
<HI>says he,</HI> the QUAKERS Dress does-not ill-become
you, and so jested with me again, and so it
went off for a third time; <HI>however,</HI> I began to be kind-to
him in process of time, <HI>as they call it,</HI> and we
grew very intimate; and if the following Accident
had not unluckily interven'd, I had certainly mar∣ried
him, or consented to marry him, the very
next time he had ask'd me.</P>
<P>I had long waited for a Letter from <HI>Amy,</HI> who
it seems, was just at that time gone to <HI>Roan</HI> the
second time, to make her Enquiries about him;
and I receiv'd a Letter from her at this unhappy
Juncture, which gave me the following Account.
of my Business,</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="284" REF="289"/>
<ITEM>I. That for <HI>my Gentleman,</HI> who I had now, <HI>as
I may say,</HI> in my Arms; <HI>she said,</HI> he had been
gone from <HI>Paris, as I have hinted,</HI> having met
with some great Losses and Misfortunes;
that he had been in <HI>Holland</HI> on that very
Account, whither he had also carried his
Children; that he was after that, settl'd
for some time, at <HI>Roan;</HI> that she had been at
<HI>Roan,</HI> and found there, (by a meer accident)
from a <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, that he was at <HI>London,</HI>
had been there above three Years; that he
was to be found upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> on the
<HI>French</HI> Walk; and that he lodg'd at St. <HI>Law∣rence
Pountney's-Lane,</HI> and the like; so <HI>Amy</HI>
said she suppos'd I might soon find him out;
but that she doubted he was poor, and not
worth looking-after: This she did because
of the next Clause, which the Jade had most
mind-to, on many Accounts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That as to the Prince—, that, <HI>as above,</HI>
he was gone into <HI>Germany,</HI> where his Estate
lay; that he had quitted the <HI>French</HI> Service,
and liv'd retir'd; that she had seen his Gen∣tleman,
who remain'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> to sollicit his
Arrears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That he had given her an Ac∣count
how his Lord had employ'd him, to
enquire for me, and find me out, <HI>as above,</HI>
and told her what Pains he had taken to
find me; that he had understood that I was
gone to <HI>England;</HI> that he once had Orders to
go to <HI>England</HI> to find me; that his Lord had
resolv'd, if he cou'd have found me to have
call'd me <HI>a Countess,</HI> and so have marry'd
me, and have carry'd me into <HI>Germany</HI> with
him; and that his Commission was still to
assure me, that the Prince wou'd mar∣ry
<PB N="285" REF="290"/>
me, if I wou'd come to him; and that
he wou'd send him an Account that he had
found me, and did not doubt but he wou'd
have Orders to come over to <HI>England</HI> to at∣tend
me, in a Figure suitable to my Quality.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> an ambitious Jade, who knew my weakest
Part, <HI>namely,</HI> that I lov'd great things, and that
I lov'd to be flatter'd and courted; said abun∣dance
of kind things upon this Occasion, which
she knew were suitable to me, and wou'd prompt
my Vanity; and talk'd big of the Prince's Gentle∣man
having Orders to come over to me, with a
Procuration to marry me by Proxy, (<HI>as Princes usu∣ally
do in like Cases</HI>) and to furnish me with an E∣quipage,
and I know not how many fine things;
but told me withal, that she had not yet let him
know that she belong'd to me still, or that she
knew where to find me, or to write to me; be∣cause
she was willing to see the Bottom of it, and
whether it was a Reality, or a <HI>Gasconade;</HI> she had
indeed, told him, that if he had any such Com∣mission,
she wou'd endeavour to find me out; but
no more.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>III. For <HI>the Jew,</HI> she assur'd me, that she had not
been able to come at a Certainty what was
become of him, or in what Part of the
World he was; but that thus much she had
learn'd from good-hands, that he had com∣mitted
a Crime, in being concern'd in a De∣sign
to rob a rich Banker at <HI>Paris;</HI> and that
he was fled, and had not been heard-of there
for above six Years.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. For that of <HI>my Husband the Brewer,</HI> she
learn'd, that being commanded into the Field
upon an Occasion of some Action in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="291"/>
he was wounded at the Battle of <HI>Mons,</HI> and
died of his Wounds in the Hospital of the
Invalids; so there was an End of my four
Enquiries, which I sent her over to make.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This Account of the Prince, and the return of
his Affection to me, with all the flattering great
things which seem'd to come along with it; and
especially, as they came gilded, and set-out by my
Maid <HI>Amy; I say,</HI> this Account of the Prince
came to me in a very unlucky Hour, and in the
very Crisis of my Affair.</P>
<P>The Merchant and I had enter'd into close Con∣ferences
upon the grand Affair; I had left off
talking my Platonicks, and of my Independency,
and being a <HI>Free Woman, as before;</HI> and he having
clear'd up my Doubts too, as to his Circumstances,
and the Misfortunes he had spoken of, I had gone
so far, that we had begun to consider where we
shou'd live, and in what Figure; what Equipage;
what House, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>I had made some Harangues upon the delight∣full
Retirement of a Country-Life, and how we
might enjoy ourselves so effectually, without the
Incumbrances of Business, and the World; but
all this was <HI>Grimace,</HI> and purely because I was afraid
to make any publick Appearance in the World,
for fear some impertinent Person of Quality shou'd
chop upon again, and cry out, <HI>Roxana, Roxana,</HI>
by—, with an Oath, <HI>as had been done before.</HI></P>
<P>My Merchant, bred to Business, and us'd to
converse among Men of Business, cou'd hardly
tell how to live without it; at least, it appear'd
he shou'd be like a Fish out of Water, uneasie and
dying; but however, he join'd with me, only-ar∣gued,
that we might live as near <HI>London</HI> as we
cou'd; that he might sometimes come to <HI>Change,</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="292"/>
and hear how the World shou'd go Abroad, and
how it far'd with his Friends, and his Children.</P>
<P><HI>I answer'd,</HI> That if he chose still to embarrass
himself with Business, I suppos'd it wou'd be more
to his Satisfaction to be in his own Country, and
where his Family was so well known, and where
his Children also were.</P>
<P>He smil'd at the Thoughts of that, <HI>and let me
know,</HI> that he shou'd be very willing to embrace
such an Offer, but that he cou'd not expect it of
me, to whom <HI>England</HI> was, <HI>to be sure,</HI> so natu∣raliz'd
now, as that it wou'd be carrying me out
of my native Country, which he wou'd not de∣sire
by any means, however agreeable it might be
to him.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> he was mistake in me; that as I
had told him so much of a Married State being a
Captivity, and the Family being a House of Bon∣dage;
that when I married, I expected to be but
an Upper Servant; so if I did, notwithstanding,
submit to it, I hop'd he shou'd see I knew how
to act the Servant's Part, and do every-thing to
oblige my Master; that if I did not resolve to
go with him wherever he desir'd to go, he might
depend I wou'd never have him; <HI>and did I not,</HI>
said I, <HI>offer myself to go with you to the</HI> East-Indies?</P>
<P>All this while, this was indeed, but a Copy of
my Countenance; for as my Circumstances wou'd
not admit my Stay in <HI>London,</HI> at least, not so as
to appear publickly; I resolv'd if I took him, to
live remote in the Country, or go out of <HI>England</HI>
with him.</P>
<P>But in <HI>an evil Hour,</HI> just now came <HI>Amy</HI>'s Le∣tter;
in the very middle of all these Discourses;
and the fine things she had said about <HI>the Prince,</HI>
began to make strange Work with me; the Notion
of being <HI>a Princess,</HI> and going over to live where
<PB N="288" REF="293"/>
all that had happen'd here, wou'd have been quite
sunk out of Knowledge, as well as out of Memo∣ry,
(<HI>Conscience excepted</HI>) was mighty taking; the
Thoughts of being surrounded with Domesticks;
honour'd with Titles; be call'd HER HIGHNESS;
and live in all the Splendor of a Court; and, <HI>which
was still more,</HI> in the Arms of a Man of such Rank,
and who I knew lov'd and valued me; all this,
<HI>in a word,</HI> dazzl'd my Eyes; turn'd my Head;
and I was as truly craz'd and distracted for about
a Fortnight, as most of the People in <HI>Bedlam,</HI>
tho' perhaps, not quite so far gone.</P>
<P>When my Gentleman came to me the next time,
I had no Notion of him; I wish'd I had never re∣ceiv'd
him at-all; <HI>in short,</HI> I resolv'd to have no
more to say to him; so I seign'd myself indispos'd;
and tho' I did come down to him, and speak to
him a little, yet I let him see that I was so ill,
that I was <HI>(as we say)</HI> no Company, and that it
wou'd be kind in him to give me Leave to quit
him for that time.</P>
<P>The next Morning he sent a Footman to enquire
how I did; and I let him know, I had a violent
Cold, and was very ill with it; two Days after,
he came again, and I let him see me again, but
feign'd myself so hoarse, that I cou'd not speak
to be heard; and that it was painful to me but
to whisper; and, <HI>in a word,</HI> I held him in this sus∣pence
near three Weeks.</P>
<P>During this time, I had a strange Elevation up∣on
my Mind; and the Prince, <HI>or the Spirit of him,</HI>
had such a Possession of me, that I spent most of
this Time in the reallizing all the Great Things
of <HI>a Life with the Prince,</HI> to my Mind; pleasing
my Fancy with the Grandeur I was supposing my∣self
to enjoy; and withal, wickedly studying in
what Manner to put off this Gentleman, and be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id
of him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="294"/>
I cannot but say, that sometimes the Baseness of
the Action stuck hard with me; the Honour and
Sincerity with which he had always treated me;
and, <HI>above all,</HI> the Fidelity he had shew'd me at
<HI>Paris,</HI> and that I ow'd my Life to him; <HI>I say,</HI> all
these star'd in my Face; and I frequently argued
with myself upon the Obligation I was under,
to him; and how base wou'd it be, <HI>now too, after
so many Obligations and Engagements,</HI> to cast him off?</P>
<P>But the Title of <HI>Highness</HI> and of <HI>a Princess,</HI>
and all those fine things, as they came in, weigh'd
down all this; <HI>and the Scene of Gratitude vanish'd,
as if it had been a Shadow.</HI></P>
<P>At other times, I consider'd the Wealth I was
Mistress of; that I was able to live like a Princess,
tho' not a Princess; and that my Merchant (<HI>for he
had told me all the Affair of his Misfortunes</HI>) was far
from being poor, or even mean; that together,
we were able to make up an Estate of between
three and four Thousand Pounds a Year, which
was in itself, equal to some Princes abroad: But
tho' this was true, yet the Name of <HI>Princess,</HI> and
the flutter of it, <HI>in a word,</HI> the Pride weigh'd 'em
down; and all these Arguings generally ended to
the Disadvantage of my Merchant; so that, <HI>in
short,</HI> I resolv'd to drop him, and give him a final
Answer, at his next coming; <HI>namely,</HI> That some∣thing
had happen'd in my Affairs, which had
caus'd me to alter my Measures, unexpectedly;
and, <HI>in a word,</HI> to desire him to trouble himself
no farther.</P>
<P>I think verily, this rude Treatment of him, was
for some time, the Effect of a violent Fermentation
in my Blood; for the very Motion which the steddy
Contemplation of my fancy'd Greatness had put
my Spirits into, had thrown me into a kind of
Fever, and I scarce knew what I did.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="295"/>
I have wonder'd since, that it did not make me
Mad; nor do I now think it strange, to hear of
those, who have been quite <HI>Lunatick</HI> with their
Pride; that fancy'd themselves Queens, and Em∣presses,
and have made their Attendants serve them
upon the Knee; given Visitors their Hand to
kiss, <HI>and the like;</HI> for certainly, if Pride will not
turn the Brain, nothing can.</P>
<P>However, the next time my Gentleman came,
I had not Courage enough, <HI>or not Ill-Nature enough,</HI>
to treat him in the rude Manner I had resolv'd
to do; and it was very well I did not; for soon
after, I had another Letter from <HI>Amy,</HI> in which
was the mortifying News, and indeed, surprizing
to me, that my Prince (<HI>as I with a secret Pleasure
had call'd him</HI>) was very much hurt by a Bruise he
had receiv'd in hunting (and engaging with) a
wild Boar; a cruel and desperate Sport, which the
Noblemen of <HI>Germany,</HI> it seems, much delight in.</P>
<P>This alarm'd me indeed, and the more, because
<HI>Amy</HI> wrote me word, that his Gentleman was gone
away Express to him, not without Apprehensions,
that he shou'd find his Master was dead, before
his coming home; but that he [<HI>the Gentleman</HI>]
had promis'd her, that as soon as he arriv'd, he
wou'd send back the same Courier to her, with
an Account of his Master's Health, and of the
main Affair; and that he had oblig'd <HI>Amy</HI> to stay
at <HI>Paris</HI> fourteen Days for his Return; she having
promis'd him before, to make it her Business to go
to <HI>England,</HI> and to find me out for his Lord, if he
sent her such Orders; and he was to send her a
Bill for fifty Pistoles, for her Journey: So <HI>Amy</HI>
told me she waited for the Answer.</P>
<P>This was a Blow to me several Ways; for <HI>first,</HI>
I was in a State of Uncertainty as to his Person,
whether he was alive or dead; and I was not un∣concern'd
<PB N="291" REF="296"/>
in that Part, I assure you; for I had an
inexpressible Affection remainiing for his Person,
besides the Degree to which it was reviv'd by the
View of a firmer Interest in him; <HI>but this was not
all;</HI> for in losing him, I for-ever lost the Prospect
of all the Gayety and Glory, that had made such
an Impression upon my Imagination.</P>
<P>In this State of Uncertainty, <HI>I say,</HI> by <HI>Amy</HI>'s
Letter, I was like still, to remain another Fort∣night;
and had I now continued the Resolution of
using my Merchant in the rude Manner I once in∣tended,
I had made, perhaps, a sorry Piece of Work
of it indeed, and it was very well my Heart fail'd
me, <HI>as it did.</HI></P>
<P>However, I treated him with a great-many
Shuffles, and seign'd Stories, to keep him off from
any closer Conferences than we had already had,
that I might act afterwards as Occasion might
offer, one way or other: But that which morti∣fied
me most, was, that <HI>Amy</HI> did not write, tho'
the fourteen Days was expir'd; at last, to my
great Surprize, when I was, with the utmost Impa∣tience,
looking out at the Window, expecting the
Postman, that usually brought the Foreign Let∣ters;
<HI>I say,</HI> I was agreeably surpriz'd to see a
Coach come to the Yard-Gate where we liv'd,
and my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> alight out of it, and come
towards the Door, having the Coachman bring∣ing
several Bundles after her:</P>
<P>I flew like Lightning down-stairs, to speak to
her; but was soon damp'd with her News: Is
the Prince alive or dead, <HI>Amy? says I:</HI> She spoke
coldly, and slightly: <HI>He is alive, Madam,</HI> said she,
<HI>but it is not much Matter, I had as-lieu he had been
dead;</HI> so we went up-stairs again to my Chamber,
and there we began a serious Discourse of the
whole Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="297"/>
First, <HI>she told me a long Story</HI> of his being hurt
by a Wild-Boar; and of the Condition he was
reduc'd to, so that every-one expected he shou'd
die, the Anguish of the Wound having thrown
him into a Fever; with abundance of Circum∣stances,
too long to relate here; how he recover'd
of that extreme Danger, but continued very weak;
how the Gentleman had been <HI>Homme de Parole,</HI>
and had sent back the Courier, as punctually, as
if it had been to the KING; that he had given
a long Account of his Lord, and of his Illness,
and Recovery; but the sum of the Matter, <HI>as to
me,</HI> was, That as to the Lady, his Lord was turn'd
Penitent; was under some Vows for his Recovery,
and cou'd not think any-more on that Affair; and
especially, the Lady being gone, and that it had
not been offer'd to her, so there was no Breach of
Honour; but that his Lord was sensible of the
good Offices of Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and had sent her the
fifty Pistoles for her Trouble, as if she had really
gone the Journey.</P>
<P>I was, <HI>I confess,</HI> hardly able to bear the first Sur∣prize
of this Disappointment; <HI>Amy,</HI> saw it, and gapes
out, (<HI>as was her way) Law'd Madam!</HI> never be con∣cern'd
at it; you see he is gotten among the Priests;
and I suppose, they have saucily impos'd some
Pennance upon him; and, <HI>it may-be,</HI> sent him of
an Errand barefoot, to some <HI>Madonna</HI> or <HI>Noster∣dame</HI>
or other; and he is off of his Amours for the
present; I'll warrant you, he'll be as wicked a∣gain
as ever he was, when he is got throrow-well,
and gets but out of their Hands again: I hate
this out-o'-Season Repentance; what Occasion
had he in his Repentance, to be off of taking
a good Wife? I shou'd have been glad to see you
have been a Princess, <HI>and all that;</HI> but if it can't
be, never afflict yourself; you are rich enough to
<PB N="293" REF="298"/>
be a Princess to yourself; you don't want him,
that's the best of it:</P>
<P>Well, I cry'd for-all that, and was heartily
vex'd and that a great-while; but as <HI>Amy</HI> was
always at my Elbow, and always jogging it out of
my Head, with her Mirth, and her Wit, it wore
off again.</P>
<P>Then I told <HI>Amy</HI> all the Story of my Merchant,
and how he had found me out, when I was in
such a Concern to find him; how it was true,
that he lodg'd in St. <HI>Lawrence Pountney's-Lane;</HI>
and how I had had all the Story of his Misfor∣tune,
which she had heard of, in which he had
lost above 8000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; and that he had
told me frankly of it, before she had sent me any
Account of it, or, <HI>at least,</HI> before I had taken any
Notice that I had heard of it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was very joyful at that Part; Well, Ma∣dam
then, <HI>says Amy,</HI> what need you value the
Story of the Prince? and going I know not whe∣ther
into <HI>Germany,</HI> to lay your Bones in another
World, and learn the Dev'il's Language, call'd
HIGH-DUTCH? You are better here, by-half, <HI>says
Amy:</HI> Law'd Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> why are not you
as rich as <HI>Crassus?</HI></P>
<P>Well, it was a great-while still, before I cou'd
bring myself off of this fancy'd Sovereignty; and
I that was so willing once to be Mistress to a KING,
was now ten thousand times more fond of being
Wife to a Prince.</P>
<P>So fast a hold has Pride and Ambition upon our
Minds, that when once it gets Admission, no∣thing
is so chimerical, but under this Possession
we can form <HI>Ideas</HI> of, in our Fancy, and realize
to our Imagination: Nothing can be so ridicu∣lous
as the simple Steps we take in such Cases; a
Man or a Woman becomes a meer <HI>Malade Imagi∣naire,</HI>
<PB N="294" REF="299"/>
and I believe, may as easily die with Grief,
or run-mad with Joy, (as the Affair in his Fancy
appears right or wrong) as if all was real, and actu∣ally
under the Management of the Person.</P>
<P>I had indeed, two Assistants to deliver me from
this Snare, and these were, <HI>first, Amy,</HI> who knew my
Disease, but was able do nothing as to the Reme∣dy;
the <HI>second,</HI> the Merchant, who really brought
the Remedy, but knew nothing of the Distemper.</P>
<P>I remember, when all these Disorders were up∣on
my Thoughts, in one of the Visits my Friend
the Merchant made me, he took Notice, that he
perceiv'd I was under some unusual Disorder;
he believ'd, <HI>he said,</HI> that my Distemper, <HI>what∣ever
it was,</HI> lay much in my Head, and it being
Summer-Weather, and very hot, propos'd to me
to go a little-way into the Air.</P>
<P>I started at his Expression; what <HI>says I,</HI> do you
think then, that <HI>I am <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raz'd?</HI> you shou'd then
propose a Mad-House for my Cure: No, no, <HI>says he,</HI>
I do not mean any-thing like that, I hope the
Head may be distemper'd, and not the Brain:
Well, I was too sensible that he was right, for I
knew I had acted a strange wild kind of Part with
him; but he insisted upon it, and press'd me to
go into the Country: <HI>I took him short again,</HI> What
need you, <HI>says I,</HI> send me out of your Way? It is
in your Power to be less troubled with me, and
with less Inconvenience to us both.</P>
<P>He took that ill, and told me I us'd to have a
better Opinion of his Sincerity; and desir'd to
know what he had done to forfeit my Charity: I
mention this, only to let you see how far I had
gone in my Measures of quitting him, <HI>that is to say,</HI>
how near I was of shewing him how base, ungrate∣ful,
and how vilely I cou'd act: But I found I had
carried the Jest far enough, and that a little Mat∣ter;
<PB N="295" REF="300"/>
might have made him sick of me again, as he
was before; for I began, by little and little, to change
my way of talking to him, and to come to Discourse
to the Purpose again, as we had done before.</P>
<P>A while after this, when we were very merry,
and talking familiarly together, he call'd me with
an Air of particular Satisfaction, <HI>his Princess;</HI> I
colour'd at the Word, <HI>for it indeed touch'd me
to the quick;</HI> but he knew nothing of the Reason of
my being touch'd with it: What d'ye mean by
that, <HI>said I?</HI> Nay, <HI>says he,</HI> I mean nothing, but
that you are a Princess to me: Well, <HI>says I,</HI> as to
that, I am content; and yet I cou'd tell you, I
might have been a Princess if I wou'd have quit∣ted
you, and believe I cou'd be so still: It is not
in my Power to make you a Princess, <HI>says he,</HI> but
I can easily make you a Lady, here in <HI>England,</HI>
and a Countess too, if you will go out of it.</P>
<P>I heard both with a great-deal of Satisfaction,
for my Pride remain'd, tho' it had been baulk'd,
and I thought <HI>with myself,</HI> that this Proposal wou'd
make me some Amends for the Loss of the Title
that had so tickl'd my Imagination another-way;
and I was impatient to understand what he meant;
but I wou'd not ask him by any-means; so it
pass'd off for that time.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I told <HI>Amy</HI> what he had
said, and <HI>Amy</HI> was as impatient to know the Man∣ner,
how it cou'd be, as I was; but the next
time, (<HI>perfectly unexpected to me</HI>) he told me, that
he had accidentally mention'd a thing to me, last
time he was with me, having not the least Thought
of the thing itself; but not knowing but such a
thing might be of some Weight to me, and that
it might bring me Respect among People where I
might appear, he had thought since of it, and
was resolv'd to ask me about it.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="301"/>
I made light of it, and told him, that as he
knew I had chosen a retir'd Life, it was of no
Value to me to be call'd LADY, or COUNTESS
either; but that if he intended to drag me, <HI>as I
might call it,</HI> into the World again, perhaps it
might be agreeable to him; but, <HI>besides that,</HI> I
cou'd not judge of the thing, because I did not
understand how either of them was to be done.</P>
<P>He told me, that Money purchas'd Titles of
Honour in almost all Parts of the World; tho'
Money cou'd not give Principles of Honour,
they must come by Birth and Blood; that how∣ever,
Titles sometimes assist to elevate the Soul,
and to infuse generous Principles into the Mind,
and especially, where there was a good Foundation
laid in the Persons; that he hop'd we shou'd nei∣ther
of us misbehave, if we came to it; and that
as we knew how to wear a Title without undue
Elevations, so it might sit as well upon us, as on
Another; that as to <HI>England,</HI> he had nothing to
do, but to get an Act of <HI>Naturalization</HI> in his Fa∣vour,
and he knew where to purchase a Patent
for BARONET, <HI>that is to say,</HI> to have the Ho∣nour
and Title transferr'd to him; but if I in∣tended
to go Abroad with him, he had a Nephew,
the Son of his Elder Brother, who had the Title
of COUNT, with the Estate annex'd, which was
but small; and that he had frequently offer'd to
make it over to him for a thousand Pistoles,
which was not a great-deal of Money; and consi∣dering
it was in the Family already, he wou'd,
upon my being willing, purchase it immediately.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I lik'd the last best; but then, I
wou'd not let him buy it, unless he wou'd let me
pay the thousand Pistoles: No, No, <HI>say he,</HI> I
refus'd a thousand Pistoles that I had more Right
to have accepted, than that, and you shall not be
<PB N="297" REF="302"/>
at so much Expence now: Yes, <HI>says I,</HI> you did
refuse it, and perhaps, repented it afterwards: I
never complain'd, <HI>says he;</HI> but I did <HI>says I,</HI> and often
repented it for you: I do not understand you, <HI>.says
he:</HI> Why, <HI>says I,</HI> I repented that I suffer'd you to
refuse it; Well, well, <HI>said he,</HI> we may talk of that
hereafter, when you shall resolve which Part of the
World you will make your settl'd Residence in:
Here he talk'd very handsomely to me, and for
a good-while together; how it had been his Lot
to live all his Days out of his Native Country,
and to be often shifting and changing the Situa∣tion
of his Affairs; and that I myself had not al∣ways
had a fix'd Abode; but that now, as neither
of us was very Young, he fancy'd I wou'd be for
taking-up our Abode, where, <HI>if possible,</HI> we might
remove no more; that as to his Part, he was
of that Opinion entirely, only with this Ex∣ception,
that the Choice of the Place shou'd be
mine; for, that all Places in the World were alike
to him; only with this single Addition, <HI>namely,</HI>
that I was with him.</P>
<P>I heard him with a great-deal of Pleasure, <HI>as well</HI>
for his being willing to give me the Choice, as
for that resolv'd to live Abroad, for the Reason
I have mention'd already, <HI>namely,</HI> lest I shou'd at
any-time be known in <HI>England,</HI> and all that Story
of <HI>Roxana,</HI> and the Balls, shou'd come out; as also
I was not a little tickl'd with the Satisfaction of
being still <HI>a Countess,</HI> tho' I cou'd not be <HI>a Princess.</HI></P>
<P>I told <HI>Amy</HI> all this Story, for she was still my
Privy-Counsellor; but when I ask'd her Opinion,
she made me laugh heartily: <HI>Now, which of the
two shall I take,</HI> Amy? <HI>said I;</HI> shall I be a Lady,
<HI>that is,</HI> a Baronet's Lady in <HI>England,</HI> or a Countess
in <HI>Holland?</HI> the ready-witted Jade, that knew the
Pride of my Temper too, almost as well as did,
<PB N="298" REF="303"/>
myself, answer'd, (without the least Hesitation)
<HI>both, Madam;</HI> which of them! <HI>says she,</HI> (repeating
the Words) why not both of them? and then
you will be really <HI>a Princess;</HI> for sure, to be a
Lady in <HI>English,</HI> and a Countess in <HI>Dutch,</HI> may
make a Princess in <HI>High-Dutch:</HI> Upon the whole,
tho' <HI>Amy</HI> was in jest, he put the Thought into
my Head, and I resolv'd, that, <HI>in short,</HI> I wou'd
be both of them; which I manag'd as you shall
hear.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I seem'd to resolve that I wou'd live and
settle in <HI>England,</HI> only with this Condition, <HI>namely,</HI>
that I wou'd not live in <HI>London;</HI> I pretended that
it wou'd choak me up; that I wanted Breath when
I was in <HI>London;</HI> but that any-where else I wou'd
be satisfied; and then I ask'd him, whether any
Sea-Port Town in <HI>England</HI> wou'd not suit him?
because I knew, tho' he seem'd to leave off, he
wou'd always love to be among Business, and con∣versing
with Men of Business; and I nam'd seve∣ral
Places, either nearest for Business with <HI>France,</HI>
or with <HI>Holland;</HI> as <HI>Dover,</HI> or <HI>Southampton</HI> for the
<HI>first;</HI> and <HI>ipswich,</HI> or <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> or <HI>Hull,</HI> for the <HI>last;</HI>
but I took care that we wou'd resolve upon no∣thing
only by this it seem'd to be certain, that
we shou'd live in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It was time now, to bring things to a Con∣clusion,
and so in about six Weeks time more,
we settl'd all our Preliminaries; and among the
rest, he let me know, that he shou'd have the Bill
for his <HI>Naturalization</HI> pass'd time enough; so that
he wou'd be, (<HI>as he call'd it</HI>) an <HI>Englishman,</HI> before
we <HI>marry'd:</HI> That was soon perfected, the Parlia∣ment
being then sitting, and several other Foreign∣ers
joining in the said Bill, to save the Expence.</P>
<P>It was not above three or four Days after, but
that, without giving me the least Notice that he
<PB N="299" REF="304"/>
had so much as been about the Patent for <HI>Baronet,</HI>
he brought it me in a fine embroider'd Bag; and
saluting me by the Name of my Lady—(<HI>joining his own Sirname to it</HI>) presented it to me,
with his Picture set with Diamonds; and at the
same time, gave me a Breast-Jewel worth a thou∣sand
Pistoles, and the next Morning we were mar∣ry'd:
Thus I put an End to all the intrieguing
Part of my Life; a Life full of prosperous Wick∣edness;
the Reflections upon which, were so much
the more afflicting, as the time had been spent in
the grossest Crimes, which the more I look'd-back
upon, the more black and horrid they appear'd,
effectually drinking up all the Comfort and Satis∣faction
which I might otherwise have taken in that
Part of Life which was still before me.</P>
<P>The first Satisfaction, however, that I took in
the new Condition I was in, was in reflecting, that
at length the Life of Crime was over; and that
I was like a Passenger coming back from the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
who having, after many Years Fatigues and
Hurry in Business, gotten a good Estate, with in∣numerable
Difficulties and Hazards, is arriv'd safe
at <HI>London</HI> with all his Effects, and has the Plea∣sure
of saying, he shall never venture upon the Seas
any-more.</P>
<P>When we were marry'd, we came back imme∣diately
to my Lodgings, (<HI>for the Church was but
just-by</HI>) and we were so privately marry'd; that
none but <HI>Amy</HI> and my Friend the QUAKER,
was acquainted with it: As soon as we came into
the House, he took me in his Arms, and kissing
me, <HI>Now you are my Own,</HI> says he; <HI>O!</HI> that you
had been so good to have done this, eleven Years
ago: Then, <HI>said I, you perhaps, wou'd have been tir'd
of me long ago;</HI> 'tis much better now; <HI>for now</HI> all
our happy Days are to come; besides, <HI>said I,</HI> I
<PB N="300" REF="305"/>
should not have been half so rich; but that I said
to myself, for there was no letting him into
the Reason of it: O! <HI>says he,</HI> I shou'd not been
tir'd of you; but besides having the Satisfaction
of your Company, it had sav'd me that unlucky
Blow at <HI>Paris,</HI> which was a dead Loss to me, of
above 8000 Pistoles, and all the Fatigues of so
many Years Hurry and Business; and then <HI>he ad∣ded,</HI>
but I'll make you pay for it all, now I have
you: I started a little at the Words: <HI>Ay,</HI> said I,
<HI>do you threaten already?</HI> Pray what d'ye mean by
that? <HI>and began to look a little grave.</HI></P>
<P>I'll tell you, <HI>says he,</HI> very plainly what I mean, and
still he held me fast in his Arms; I intend from
this time, never to trouble myself with any-more
Business; so I shall never get one Shilling for you,
more than I have already; all that you will lose
one way; <HI>next,</HI> I intend not to trouble myself
with any of the Care or Trouble of managing
what either you have for me, or what I have to
add to it; but you shall e'en take it all upon your∣self,
as the Wives do in <HI>Holland,</HI> so you will pay
for it that way too; for all the Drudgery shall be
yours; <HI>thirdly,</HI> I intend to condemn you to the
the constant Bondage of my impertinent Company,
for I shall tie you like a Pedlar's Pack, at my Back,
I <HI>shall</HI> scarce ever be from you; for, I am sure, I
can take Delight in nothing else in this World:
Very well, <HI>says I,</HI> but I am pretty heavy, I hope
you'll set me down sometimes, when you are a∣weary;
as for that, <HI>says he,</HI> tire me if you can.</P>
<P>This was all Jest and Allegory; but it was all
true, in the Moral of the Fable, as you shall hear
in its Place: We were very merry the rest of
the Day, but without any Noise, or Clutter; for
he brought not one of his Acquaintance, or Friends,
either <HI>English,</HI> or Foreigner: The honest QUAKRE
<PB N="301" REF="306"/>
provided us a very noble Dinner indeed, consider∣ing
how few we were to eat it; and every Day
that Week she did the like, and wou'd, at last, have
it be all at her own Charge, which I was utterly
averse to; <HI>first,</HI> because I knew her Circumstances
not to be very great, tho' not very low; <HI>and next,</HI>
because she had been so true a Friend, and so chear∣ful
a Comforter to me, <HI>ay, and Counsellor too,</HI> in all
this Affair, that I had resolv'd to make her a Pre∣sent,
that shou'd be some Help to her when all was
over.</P>
<P>But to return to the Circumstances of our Wed∣ding;
after being very merry, <HI>as I have told you,
Amy</HI> and the QUAKER, put us to-Bed, the
honest QUAKER little-thinking we had been
<HI>a-Bed together</HI> eleven Years before; nay, that was
a Secret which, <HI>as it happen'd, Amy</HI> herself did not
know: <HI>Amy</HI> grinn'd, and made Faces, as if she
had been pleas'd; but it came out in so many
Words, when he was not by, the Sum of her
mumbling and muttering was, that this shou'd
have been done ten or a dozen Years before; that
it wou'd signifie little now; <HI>that was to say, in
short,</HI> that her Mistress was pretty near Fifty,
and too old to have any Children; I chid her;
the QUAKER laugh'd; complimented me upon
my not being so old as <HI>Amy</HI> pretended; that I
cou'd not be above Forty, and might have a House∣full
of Children yet; but <HI>Amy</HI> and I too, knew
better than she, how it was; for, <HI>in short,</HI> I was old
enough to have done breeding, however I look'd;
but I made her hold her Tongue.</P>
<P>In the Morning my QUAKER-Landlady came
and visited us, before we were up, and made us
eat Cakes, and drink Chocolate in-Bed; and then
left us again, and bid us take a Nap upon it,
which I believe we did; in <HI>short,</HI> she treated us so
<PB N="302" REF="307"/>
handsomly, and with such an agreeable Chearful∣ness,
as well as Plenty, as made it appear to me,
that QUAKER may, and that this QUAKER
did, understand Good-Manners, as well as any∣other
People.</P>
<P>I resisted her Offer, <HI>however,</HI> of treating us for
the whole Week; and I oppos'd it so long, that
I saw evidently that she took it ill, and wou'd
have thought herself slighted, if we had not ac∣cepted
it; so I said no more, but let her go on,
only told her, I wou'd be even with her, <HI>and so I
was:</HI> However, for that Week she treated us, <HI>as
she said she wou'd,</HI> and did it so very fine, and with
such a Profusion of all sorts of good things, that
the greatest Burthen to her was, how to dispose of
things that were left; for she never let any-thing,
how dainty, or however large, be so much as seen
twice among us.</P>
<P>I had some Servants indeed, which help'd her
off a little; <HI>that is to say,</HI> two Maids, for <HI>Amy</HI>
was now a Woman of Business, not a Servant, and
eat always with us; I had also, a Coachman, and
a Boy; my QUAKER had a Man-Servant too,
but had but one Maid; but she borrow'd two
more of some of her Friends, for the Occasion;
and had a Man-Cook for dressing the Victuals.</P>
<P>She was only at a loss for Plate, which she gave
me a Whisper of; and I made <HI>Amy</HI> fetch a large
strong Box, which I had lodg'd in a safe Hand, in
which was all the fine Plate, which I had provi∣ded
on a worse Occasion, <HI>as is mention'd before;</HI> and
I put it into the QUAKER'S Hand, obliging
her not to use it as mine, but as her own, for a
Reason I shall mention presently.</P>
<P>I was now my LADY—, and I must
own, I was exceedingly pleas'd with it; 'twas so
Big, and so Great, to hear myself call'd <HI>Her Lady∣ship,</HI>
<PB N="303" REF="308"/>
and <HI>Your Ladyship, and the like;</HI> that I was like
the <HI>Indian</HI> King at <HI>Virginia,</HI> who having a House
built for him by the <HI>English,</HI> and a Lock put upon
the Door, wou'd sit whole Days together, with
the Key in his Hand, locking and unlocking, and
double-locking the Door, with an unaccountable
Pleasure at the Novelty; so I cou'd have sat a
whole Day together, to hear <HI>Amy</HI> talk to me, and
call me <HI>Your Ladyship</HI> at every word; but after a∣while
the Novelty wore off, and the Pride of it
abated; till at last, truly, I wanted the other Ti∣tle
as much as I did that of <HI>Ladyship</HI> before.</P>
<P>We liv'd this Week in all the Innocent Mirth
imaginable; and our good-humourd QUAKER
was so pleasent in her Way, that it was particu∣larly
entertaining to us: We had no Musick at-all,
or Dancing; only I now and then sung a <HI>French</HI>
Song, to divert my Spouse, who desir'd it, and
the privacy of our Mirthgretly added to the
Pleasure of it: I did not make many Cloaths for
my Wedding, having always a great-many rich
Cloaths by me, which with a little altering for
the Fasion were cperfectly new: The next Day
he press'd me to dress, tho' we had no Company;
at last, jesting with him, I told him, I believ'd I
was able to dress me so, in one kind of Dress that
I had by me, that he wou'd not know his Wife
when he saw her, especially if any-body else was
by: <HI>No!</HI> he said, <HI>that was impossible;</HI> and he long'd
to see that Dress; <HI>I told him,</HI> I wou'd dress me
in it, if he wou'd promise me never to desire me
to appear in it before Company; he promis'd he
wou'd not, but wanted to know <HI>why</HI> too; as
Husbands, you know, are inquisitive Creatures,
and love to enquire after any-thing they think is
kept from them; but I had an Answer ready for
him; because, <HI>said I,</HI> it is not a decent Dress in
<PB N="304" REF="309"/>
this Country, and wou'd not look modest; nei∣ther
indeed, wou'd it, for it was but one Degree off,
from appearing in one's Shift; but was the usual
Wear in the Country where they were used: He
was satisfy'd with my Answer, and gave me his
Promise, never to ask me to be seen in it before
Company: I then withdrew, taking only <HI>Amy</HI>
and the <HI>QUAKER</HI> with me; and <HI>Amy</HI> dress'd
me in my old <HI>Turkish Habit</HI> which I danc'd in for∣merly,
<HI>&amp;c. as before:</HI> The QUAKER was charm'd
with the Dress, <HI>and merrily said,</HI> That if such
a Dress shou'd come to be worn here, she shou'd
not know what to do; she shou'd be tempted not
to dress in the QUAKERS Way any-more.</P>
<P>When all the Dress was put on, I loaded it with
Jewels, and in particular, I plac'd the large Breast-Jewel
which he had given me, of a thousand Pi∣stoles,
upon the Front of the <HI>Tyhaia,</HI> or Head-Dress;
where it made a most glorious Show in∣deed;
I had my own Diamond-Necklace on, and
my Hair was <HI>Tout Brilliant,</HI> all glittering with
Jewels.</P>
<P>His Picture set with Diamonds, I had plac'd
stitch'd to my Vest, just, <HI>as might be suppos'd,</HI> upon
my Heart, (which is the Compliment in such Cases
among the <HI>Eastern</HI> People) and all being open at
the Breast, there was no room for any-thing of a
Jewel there: In this Figure <HI>Amy</HI> holding the
Train of my Robe, I came down to him: He
was surpriz'd, and perfectly astonish'd; he knew
me, <HI>to besure,</HI> because I had prepar'd him, and be∣cause
there was no-body else there, but the QUAKER
and <HI>Amy;</HI> but he by no means knew <HI>Amy;</HI> for
she had dress'd herself in the Habit of a <HI>Turkish</HI>
Slave, being the Garb of my <HI>little Turk,</HI> which I
had at <HI>Naples, as I have said;</HI> she had her Neck
and Arms bare; was bare-headed, and her Hair
<PB N="305" REF="310"/>
breeded in a long Tossel hanging down her Back;
but the Jade cou'd neither hold her Countenance,
or her chattering Tongue, so as to be conceal'd
long.</P>
<P>Well, he was so charm'd with this Dress, that
he wou'd have me sit and dine in it; but it was
so thin, and so open before, and the Weather be∣ing
also sharp, that I was afraid of taking Cold;
however, the Fire being enlarged, and the Doors
kept shut, I sat to oblige him; and he profess'd,
he never saw so fine a Dress in his Life: I after∣wards
told him, that my Husband (<HI>so he call'd the</HI>
jeweller <HI>that was kill'd</HI>) bought it for me, at <HI>Leg∣horn,</HI>
with a young <HI>Turkish</HI> Slave, which I parted
with at <HI>Paris;</HI> and that it was by the help of that
Slave that I learn'd how to dress in it, and how
every-thing was to be worn, and many of the
<HI>Turkish</HI> Customs also, with some of their Lan∣guage;
this Story agreeing with the Fact, only
changing the Person, was very natural, and so it
went off with him; but there was good Reason
why I shou'd not receive any Company in this
Dress, <HI>that is to say,</HI> not in <HI>England; I need not re∣peat
it; you will hear more of it.</HI></P>
<P>But when I came Abroad, I frequently put it
on, and upon two or three Occasions danc'd in
it, but always at his Request.</P>
<P>We continued at the QUAKER'S Lodgings for
above a Year; for now making as tho' it was dif∣ficult
to determine where to settle in <HI>England</HI> to
his Satisfaction, unless in <HI>London,</HI> which was not
to mine; I pretended to make him an Offer, that
to oblige him, I began to incline to go and live A∣broad
with him; that I knew nothing could be
more agreeable to him, and that as to me, every
Place was alike; that as I had liv'd Abroad without
a Husband so many Years, it cou'd be no
<PB N="306" REF="311"/>
Burthen to me to live Abroad again, <HI>especially
with him;</HI> then we fell to straining our Courte∣sies
upon one-another; he told me, he was per∣fectly
easie at living in <HI>England,</HI> and had squar'd
all his Affairs accordingly; for that, as he had
told me he intended to give over all Business in
the World, as well the Care of managing it, as
the Concern about it; seeing we were both in
Condition, neither to want it, or to have it
be worth our while; or I might see it was his
Intention, by his setting, himself Naturaliz'd,
and getting the Patent of Baronet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Well,
for-all that, I told him, I accepted his Com∣pliment,
but I cou'd not but know that his Na∣tive
Country, where his Children were breeding
up, must be most agreeable to him, and that if I
was of such Value to him, I wou'd be there then,
to enhanse the rate of his Satisfaction; that where∣ever
he was, wou'd be a Home to me; and any
Place in the World wou'd be <HI>England</HI> to me, if
he was with me; and thus, <HI>in short,</HI> I brought
him to give me leave to oblige him with going to
live Abroad; when in truth, I cou'd not have
been perfectly easie at living in <HI>England,</HI> unless
I had kept constantly within-doors; lest some time or
other, the dissolute Life I had liv'd here, shou'd
have come to be known; and all those wicked
things have been known too, which I now began
to be very much asham'd of.</P>
<P>When we clos'd up our Wedding-Week, in
which our QUAKER had been so very hand∣some
to us, I told him how much thought we
were oblig'd to her for her generous Carriage to
us; how she had acted the kindest Part thro' the
whole, and how faithful a Friend she had been to
me, upon all Occasions; and then letting him
know a little of her Family Unhappinesses, I pro∣pos'd,
<PB N="307" REF="312"/>
that I thought I not only ought to be grate∣ful
to her, but really to do something extraor∣dinary
for her, towards making her easie in her
Affairs; <HI>and I added,</HI> that I had no hangers-on,
that shou'd trouble him; that there was no-body
belong'd to me, but what was thorowly provided
for; and that if I did something for this honest
Women, that was considerable, it shou'd be the
last Gift I wou'd give to any-body in the World,
<HI>but Amy;</HI> and as for her, we was not a-going to
turn her adrift, but whenever any-thing offer'd,
for her, we wou'd do as we saw Cause; that <HI>in
the mean time, Amy</HI> was not poor; that she hads-av'd
together between seven and eight Hundred
Pounds; <HI>by the way, I did not tell him how, and by
what wicked Ways she had got it;</HI> but <HI>that she had it;</HI>
and that was enough to let him know she wou'd
never be in want of us.</P>
<P>My Spouse was exceedingly pleas'd with my
Discourse about the QUAKER, made a kind of a
Speech to me upon the Subject of Gratitude;
<HI>told me,</HI> it was one of the brightest Parts of a Gen∣tlewoman;
that it was so twisted with Honesty,
<HI>nay,</HI> and even with Religion too, that he questi∣on'd
whether either of them cou'd be found, where
Gratitude was not to be found; that in this Act
there was not only Gratitude, but Charity; and
that to make the Charity still more Christian-like,
the Object too had real Merit to attract it; he
therefore agreed to the thing with all his Heart,
only wou'd have had me let him pay it out of his
Effects.</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>as for that,</HI> I did not design <HI>what∣ever
I had said formerly,</HI> that we shou'd have <HI>two
Pockets;</HI> and that tho' I had talk'd to him of being
a Free Woman, and an Independent, <HI>and the like,</HI>
and he had offer'd and promis'd that I shou'd keep
<PB N="308" REF="313"/>
all my own Estate in my own Hands; yet, that
since I had taken him, I wou'd e'en do as other
<HI>honest Wives</HI> did, where I thought fit to give my∣self,
I shou'd give what I had too; that if I re∣serv'd
any-thing, it shou'd be only in case of Mor∣tality,
and that I might give it to his Children af∣terwards,
<HI>as my own Gift;</HI> and that, <HI>in short,</HI> if he
thought fit to join Stocks, we wou'd see to Mor∣row
Morning, what Strength we cou'd both make
up in the World, and bringing it all together, con∣sider
before we resolv'd upon the Place of remo∣ving,
how we shou'd dispose of what we had, as
well as of ourselves: This Discourse was too obli∣ging,
and he too much a Man of Sence, not to
receive it, as it was meant; <HI>he only answer'd,</HI> We
wou'd do in that, as we shou'd both agree; but
the thing under our present Care, was to shew not
Gratitude only, but Charity and Affection too, to
our kind Friend the QUAKER; and the first
Word he spoke of, was to settle a thousand Pounds
upon her, <HI>for her Life, that is to say,</HI> sixty Pounds
a Year; but in such a manner, as not to be in the
Power of any Person to reach, but herself: This
was a great thing, and indeed, shew'd the generous
Principles of my Husband, and for that reason I
mention it; but I thought that a little too much
too, and particularly, because I had another thing
in View for her, about the Plate; so I told him,
I thought if he gave her a Purse with a Hundred
Guineas as a Present <HI>first,</HI> and then made her a
Compliment of. 40 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> for her Life, se∣cur'd
any such Way as she shou'd desire, it wou'd
be very handsome.</P>
<P>He agreed to that; and the same Day, in the
Evening, when we were just going to-Bed, he
took my QUAKER by the Hand, and with a
Kiss, told her, That we had been very kindly
<PB N="309" REF="314"/>
treated by her from the beginning of this Affair,
and his Wife before, as she, (<HI>meaning me</HI>) had in∣form'd
him; and that he thought himself bound
to let her see, that she had oblig'd Friends who
knew how to be grateful; that for his Part of the
Obligation, he desir'd she wou'd accept of <HI>that,</HI>
for an Acknowledgment in Part only, (<HI>putting the
Gold into her Hand</HI>) and that his Wife wou'd talk
with her about what farther he had to say to her;
and upon that, not giving her time hardly to say
<HI>thank ye,</HI> away he went up-Stairs, into our Bed-Chamber,
leaving her confus'd, and not knowing
what to say.</P>
<P>When he was gone, she began to make very
handsome and obliging Representations of her
Good-will to us both, but that it was without
Expectation of Reward; that I had given her
several valuable Presents before, <HI>and so indeed I
had;</HI> for, besides the Piece of Linnen which I had
given her <HI>at first,</HI> I had given her a Suit of Da∣mask
<HI>Table-Linnen,</HI> of the. Linneh I bought for my
Balls, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Table-cloths, and three Dozen
of Napkins; and at another time, I gave her a
little Necklace of Gold Beads, <HI>and the like;</HI> but
that is <HI>by the way;</HI> but she mention'd them, <HI>I say;</HI>
and how she was obl'g'd by me, on many other Oc∣casions;
that she was not in Condition to show
her Gratitude any other way, not being able to
make a suitable Return; and that now we took
from her all Opportunity to ballance my former
Friendship, and left her more in Debt than she
was before: She spoke this in a very good kind
of a Manner, <HI>in her own way,</HI> but which was very
agreeable, indeed, and had as much apparent Sin∣cerity,
and I verily believe as real, as was possible
to be express'd; but I put a Stop to it, and bid
her say no more, but accept of what my Spouse
<PB N="310" REF="315"/>
had given her, which was but in Part, as she had
heard him say; and <HI>put it up,</HI> says I, <HI>and come and
sit down here, and give me Leave to say something else
to you, on the same Head, which my Spouse and I have
settled between ourselves, in your Behalf;</HI> What dost
Thee mean, <HI>says she?</HI> and blush'd, and look'd
surpriz'd, but did not stir; she was going to speak
again, but I interrupted her, and told her, she
shou'd make no more Apologies of any kind what∣ever,
for I had better things than all this, to talk
to her of; so I went on, and told her, That as
she had been so friendly and kind to us on every
Occasion; and that her House was the lucky Place
where we came together; and that she knew I
was from her own Mouth, acquainted in Part, with
her Circumstances, we were resolv'd she shou'd be
the better for us, as long as she liv'd: Then I
told her what we had resolv'd to do for her;
and that she had nothing more to do, but to con∣sult
with me, how it shou'd be effectually secur'd
for her, distinct from any of the Effects which
were her Husband's; and that if her Husband did
so supply her, that she cou'd live comfortably, and
not want it for Bread, or other Necessaries, she
shou'd not make Use of it, but lay up the Income
of it, and add it every Year to the Principal, so
to encrease the Annual Payment, which in time,
and perhaps before she might come to want it,
might double itself; that we were very willing
whatever she shou'd so lay up, shou'd be to her∣self,
and whoever she thought fit after her; but
that the forty Pound a-Year, must return to our
Family, after her Life; which we both wish'd
might be long and happy.</P>
<P>Let no Reader wonder at my extraordinary
Concern for this poor Woman; or at my giving
my Bounty to her a Place in this Account; it is
<PB N="311" REF="316"/>
not, <HI>I assure you,</HI> to make a Pageantry of my Cha∣rity,
or to value myself upon the Greatness of my
Soul; that shou'd give in so profuse a Manner as
this, which was above my Figure, if my Wealth
had been twice as much as it was; but there was
another Spring from whence all flow'd, and 'tis on
that Account I speak of it: Was it possible I cou'd
think of a poor desolate Woman with four Chil∣dren,
and her Husband gone from her, <HI>and per∣haps
good for little if he had stay'd; I say,</HI> was I,
that had tasted so deep of the Sorrows of such a
kind of Widowhood, able to look on her, and
think of her Circumstances, and not be touch'd
in an uncommon Manner? No, No, I never look'd
on her, and her Family, tho' she was not left so
helpless and friendless as I had been, without re∣membring
my own Condition; when <HI>Amy</HI> was sent
out to pawn or sell my <HI>Pair of Stays,</HI> to buy a
Breast of Mutton, and a Bunch of Turnips; nor
cou'd I look on her poor Children, tho' not poor
and perishing, like mine, without Tears; reflect∣ing
on the dreadful Condition that mine were re∣duc'd
to, when poor <HI>Amy</HI> sent them all into their
Aunt's in <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> and run away from them:
These were the Original Springs, or Fountain-Head,
from whence my Affectionate Thoughts
were mov'd to assist this poor Woman.</P>
<P>When a poor Debtor, having lain long in the
<HI>Compter,</HI> or <HI>Ludgate,</HI> or the <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI> for Debt,
afterwards gets out, rises again in the World,
and grows rich such an one is a certain Bene∣factor
to the Prisoners there, and perhaps to every
Prison he passes by, as long as he lives; for he
remembers the dark Days of his own Sorrow;
and even those who never had the Experience
of such Sorrows to stir up their Minds to Acts
of Charity, would have the same charitable good
<PB N="312" REF="317"/>
Disposition, did they as sensibly remember what
it is, that distinguishes them from others, by a
more favourable and merciful Providence.</P>
<P>This, <HI>I say,</HI> was however, the Spring of my
Concern for this honest friendly and grateful
QUAKER, and as I had so plentiful a Fortune
in the World, I resolv'd she should taste the
Fruit of her kind Usage to me, in a manner that
she cou'd not expect.</P>
<P>All the while I talk'd to her, I saw the Dis∣order
of her Mind; the sudden Joy was too
much for her, and she colour'd, trembled, chang'd,
and at last grew pale, and was indeed near faint∣ing;
when she hastily rung a little Bell for her
Maid, who coming in immediately, she beckon'd
to her, <HI>for speak she cou'd not,</HI> to fill her a Glass
of Wine, but she had no Breath to take it in,
and was almost choak'd with that which she
took in her Mouth; I saw she was ill, and assisted
her what I cou'd, and with Spirits and things
to smell too, just kept her from Fainting, when
she beckon'd to her Maid to withdraw, and im∣mediately
burst our in crying, and that reliev'd
her; when she recover'd herself a little, she flew
to me and throwing her Arms about my Neck,
O! <HI>says she, thou hast almost kill'd me;</HI> and there
she hung, laying her Head in my Neck for half
a quarter of an Hour, not able to speak, but
sobbing like a Child that had been whipp'd.</P>
<P>I was very sorry, that I did not stop a little, in
the middle of my Disc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urse, and make her drink
a Glass of Wine, before it had put her Spirits into
such a violent Motion; but it was too late, and
it was ten to one odds, but that it had kill'd
her.</P>
<P>But she came to herself at last, and began to
say some very good things in return for my
<PB N="313" REF="318"/>
kindness; I would not let her go on, but
<HI>told her,</HI> I had more to say to her still, than all
this, but that I would let it alone till another
time; my meaning was, about the Box of Plate,
good part of which I gave her, and some I gave
to <HI>Amy,</HI> for I had so much Plate, and some so
large, that I thought if I let my Husband see it,
he might be apt to wonder what Occasion I
cou'd ever have for so much, and for Plate of
such a kind too; as particularly, a great Cistern
for Bottles, which cost a hundred and twenty
Pounds, and some large Candlesticks, too big, for
any ordinary Use: These I caus'd <HI>Amy</HI> to sell;
<HI>in short, Amy</HI> sold above three hundred Pound's-worth
of Plate; what I gave the QUAKER,
was worth above sixty Pounds, and I gave <HI>Amy</HI>
above thirty Pound's-worth, and yet I had a
great-deal left for my Husband.</P>
<P>Nor did our Kindness to the QUAKER end
with the forty Pound a Year, for we were always,
while we stay'd with her, which was above ten
Months, giving her one good thing or another;
and, <HI>in a word,</HI> instead of Lodging with her, she
Boarded with us, for I kept the House, and she
and all her Family eat and drank with us, and
yet we paid her the Rent of the House too;
<HI>in short,</HI> I remember'd <HI>my Widowhood,</HI> and I
made this Widow's Heart glad many a Day
the more, upon that Account.</P>
<P>And now my Spouse and I begun to think o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
going over to <HI>Holland,</HI> where I had propos'd to
him to live, and in order to settle all the Preli∣minaries
of our future Manner of Living, I began
to draw in my Effects, so as to have them all
at Command, upon whatever Occasion we thought
fit; after which, <HI>one Morning</HI> I call'd my Spouse
up to me; hark ye, Sir, <HI>said I to him,</HI> I have
<PB N="314" REF="319"/>
two very weighty Questions to ask of you; I
don't know what Answer you will give to the
<HI>first,</HI> but I doubt you will be able to give but
a sorry Answer to the <HI>other,</HI> and yet, <HI>I assure
you,</HI> it is of the last Importance to yourself, and
towards the future Part of your Life, wherever
it is to be.</P>
<P>He did not seem, to be much alarm'd, because
he could see I was speaking in a kind of merry
way, <HI>Let's hear your Questions,</HI> my Dear, <HI>says he,
and I'll give the best Answer I can to them:</HI> Why
first, <HI>says I,</HI>
1. You have marry'd a Wife here, made her
a <HI>Lady,</HI> and put her in Expectation of being
something else still, when she comes Abroad;
pray have you examin'd whether you are
able to supply all her extravagant Demands
when she comes Abroad; and maintain an
expensive <HI>Englishwoman</HI> in all her Pride, and
Vanity? <HI>In short,</HI> have you, enquir'd whether
you are able to keep her?</P>
<P>2. You have marry'd a Wife here, and given
her a great many fine things, and you main∣tain
her like a <HI>Princess,</HI> and sometimes call
her <HI>so;</HI> pray what Portion have you had
with her? what Fortune has she been to
you? and where does her Estate lie, that
you keep her so fine? I am afraid you keep
her in a Figure a great-deal above her Estate,
<HI>at least,</HI> above all that you have seen of it
yet? are you sure you ha'n't got a <HI>Bite?</HI> and
that you have not made a Beggar a <HI>Lady?</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>says he,</HI> have you any more Questions
to ask? let's have them all together, perhaps they
may be all answer'd in a few Words, as well
<PB N="315" REF="320"/>
as these two: No, says I, these are the two grand
Questions, at least, for the present: Why then,
<HI>says he,</HI> I'll answer you in a few Words, That
I am fully Master of my qwn Circumstances,
and without father Enquiry, can let my Wife
you speak of, know, that as I have made her a
<HI>Lady,</HI> I can maintain her <HI>as a Lady,</HI> wherever she
goes with me; and this, whether she has any Pi∣stole
of her Portion, or whether I have one Por∣tion
or no: And as I have not enquir'd whether
she has any Portion or not, so she shall not have
the less Respect shew'd her from me, or be oblig'd
to live meaner, or be any-ways straiten'd on that
Account; on the contrary, if she goes Abroad to
live with me in my own Country, I will make
her more than a <HI>Lady</HI> and support the Expence
of it too, without meddling with any-thing she
has; and this I suppose, <HI>says he,</HI> contains an An∣swer
to both your Question together.</P>
<P>He spoke this with a great deal more Earnest∣ness
in his Countenance, than I had when I
propos'd my Questions; and said a great-many
kind things upon it, as the Consequence of for∣mer
Discourses, so that I was oblig'd to be in
earnest too; My Dear, <HI>says I,</HI> I was but in jest
in my Questions; but they were propos'd to in∣troduce
what I am going to say to you in ear∣nest;
<HI>namely,</HI> that if I am to go Abroad, 'tis time
I shou'd let you know how things stand, and what
I have to bring you, with your Wife; how it is to
be dispos'd, and secur'd, <HI>and the like;</HI> and there∣fore
come, <HI>says I,</HI> sit down, and let me show you
your Bargain here; I hope you will find, that
you have not got a Wife without a Fortune.</P>
<P>He told me then, that since he found I was in
earnest, he desir'd that I wou'd adjourn it till to-Morrow,
and then we wou'd do as the poor Peo∣ple
<PB N="316" REF="321"/>
do after they Marry, feel in their Pockets, and
see how much Money they can bring together in
the World; well <HI>says I,</HI> with all my Heart; and
so we ended our Talk for that time.</P>
<P>As this was in the Morning, my Spouse went
out after Dinner to his Goldsmith's, <HI>as he said,</HI> and
about three Hours after, returns with a Porter and
two large Boxes, with him; and his Servant
brought another Box, which I observ'd was almost
as heavy as the two that the Porter brought, and
made the poor Fellow sweat heartily; he dis∣miss'd
the Porter, and in a little-while after went
out again with his Man, and returning at Night,
brought another Porter with more Boxes and Bun∣dles,
and all was carried up, and put into a Cham∣ber,
next to our Bed-Chamber, and in the Morn∣ing
he call'd for a pretty large round Table, and
began to unpack.</P>
<P>When the Boxes were open'd, I found they
were chiefly full of Books, and Papers, and Parch∣ments,
<HI>I mean,</HI> Books of Accompts, and Writings,
<HI>and such things,</HI> as were in themselves of no Mo∣ment
to me, because I understood them not; but
I perceiv'd he took them all out, and spread them
about him, upon the Table, and Chairs, and began
to be very busie with them; so I withdrew, and
left him; and he was indeed, so busie among them,
that he never miss'd me, till I had been gone a
good-while; but when he had gone thro' all his
Papers, and come to open a little Box, he call'd
for me again; Now, <HI>says he,</HI> and call'd me <HI>his
Countess,</HI> I am ready to answer your <HI>first Question;</HI>
it you will sit down till I have open'd <HI>this Box,</HI>
we will see how it stands.</P>
<P>So we open'd the Box; there was in it indeed,
what I did not expect, for I thought he had sunk
his Estate, rather than rais'd it; but he produc'd
<PB N="317" REF="322"/>
me in Goldsmiths Bills, and Stock in the <HI>English
East-India Company,</HI> about sixteen thousand Pounds
Sterling; then he gave into my Hands, nine As∣signment
upon the Bank of <HI>Lyons</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and
two upon the Rents of the Town-House in <HI>Paris,</HI>
amounting in the whole to 5800 Crowns <HI>per An∣num,</HI>
or annual Rent, <HI>as 'tis call'd there;</HI> and <HI>lastly,</HI>
the Sum of 30000 <HI>Rixdollars</HI> in the Bank of <HI>Am∣sterdam;</HI>
besides some Jewels and Gold in the Box,
to the Value of about 15 or 1600 <HI>l.</HI> among which
was a very good Necklace of Pearl, of about 200 <HI>l.</HI>
Value; and that he pull'd out, and ty'd about
my Neck; telling me, That shou'd not be reckon'd
into the Account.</P>
<P>I was equally pleas'd and surpriz'd; and it was
with an inexpressible Joy, that I saw him so rich:
You might well tell me, <HI>said I,</HI> that you were able
to make me <HI>Countess,</HI> and maintain me as such: <HI>In
short,</HI> he was immensly rich; for besides all this,
he shew'd me, which was the Reason of his be∣ing
so busie among the Books, <HI>I say,</HI> he shew'd
me several Adventures he had Abroad, in the Bu∣siness
of his Merchandize; as particularly, an
eighth Share in an <HI>East-India</HI> Ship then Abroad <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
an Account-Courant with a Merchant, at <HI>Cadiz</HI>
in <HI>Spain;</HI> about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> lent upon <HI>Bottomree,</HI>
upon Ships gone to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and a large Cargo
of Goods in a Merchant's Hands, for Sale, at <HI>Lis∣bon</HI>
in <HI>Portugal;</HI> so that in his Books there was a∣bout
12000 <HI>l.</HI> more; all which put together, made
about 27000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, and 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>I stood amaz'd at this Account, <HI>as well I might,</HI>
and said nothing to him for a good-while, and the
rather, because I saw him still busie, looking over
his Books: After a-while, as I was going to ex∣press
my Wonder; <HI>Hold,</HI> my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> this is
not all neither; then he pull'd me out some old
<PB N="318" REF="323"/>
Seals, and small Parchment-Rolls, which I did
not understand; <HI>but he told me,</HI> they were a Right
of Reversion which he had to a Paternal Estate
in his Family, and a Mortgage of 14000 <HI>Rixdol∣lars,</HI>
which he had upon it, in the Hands of the
present Possessor; so that was about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> more.</P>
<P>But now hold again, <HI>says he,</HI> for I must pay my
Debts out of all this, and they are very great, <HI>I
assure you;</HI> and the <HI>first, he said,</HI> was a black Article
of 8000 Pistoles, which he had a Law-Suit about,
at <HI>Paris,</HI> but had it awarded against him, which
was the Loss he had told me of, and which made
him leave <HI>Paris</HI> in Disgust; that in other Accounts
he ow'd about 5300 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; but after all this,
upon the whole, he had still 17000 <HI>l.</HI> clear Stock
in Money, and 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a-Year in Rent.</P>
<P>After some Pause, it came to my Turn to speak;
Well, <HI>says I,</HI> 'tis very hard a Gentleman with
such a Fortune as this, shou'd come over to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and marry a Wife with <HI>Nothing;</HI> it shall ne∣ver,
<HI>says I,</HI> be said, but what I have, I'll bring into
the Publick Stock; so I began to produce.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I pull'd out the Mortgage which good Sir
<HI>Robert</HI> had procur'd for me, the annual Rent 700 <HI>l.
per Annum;</HI> the principal Money 14000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I pull'd out another Mortgage upon
Land, procur'd by the same faithful Friend, which
at three times, had advanc'd 12000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I pull'd him out a Parcel of little Se∣curities,
procur'd by several Hands, by Fee-Farm
Rents, and such Petty Mortgages as those Times
afforded, amounting to 10800 <HI>l.</HI> principal Money,
and paying six hundred and thirty six Pounds a-Year;
so that in the whole, there was two thou∣sand
fifty six Pounds a-Year, Ready-Money con∣stantly
coming in.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="324"/>
When I had shewn him all these, I laid them
upon the Table, and bade him take them, that
he might be able to give me an Answer to the
<HI>second Question</HI> viz. <HI>What Fortune he had with his
Wife?</HI> and laugh'd a little at it.</P>
<P>He look'd at them a-while, and then handed
them all back again to me; I will not touch them,
says he, nor one of them, till they are all settl'd in
Trustees Hands, for your own Use, and the Ma∣nagement
wholly your own.</P>
<P>I cannot omit what happen'd to me while all
this was acting, tho' it was chearful Work in
the main, yet I trembled every Joint or me, worse
for ought I know, than ever <HI>Belshazzer</HI> did at the
Hand-writing on the Wall, and the Occasion was
every way as just: Ʋnhappy Wretch, said I to my∣self,
<HI>shall my ill-got Wealth, the Product of</HI> prospe∣rous
Lust, <HI>and of a vile and vicious Life</HI> of Whore∣dom
and Adultery, <HI>be intermingled with the honest
well-gotten Estate of this innocent Gentleman, to be
a Moth and a Catterpiller among it, and bring the
Judgments of Heaven upon him, and upon what he
has, for my sake! Shall my Wickedness blast his Com∣forts!
Shall I</HI> be Fire in his Flax! <HI>and be a Means
to provoke Heaven to curse his Blessings!</HI> God for∣bid!
<HI>I'll keep them asunder, if it be possible.</HI></P>
<P>This is the true Reason why I have been so par∣ticular
in the Account of my vast acquir'd Stock;
and how his Estate, which was perhaps, the Pro∣duct
of many Years fortunate Industry; and which
was equal, if not superior, to mine, at best, was <HI>at
my Request,</HI> kept apart from mine, <HI>as is mention'd
above.</HI></P>
<P>I have told you how he gave back all my
Writings into my own Hands again; <HI>Well, says I,</HI>
seeing you will have it be kept apart, <HI>it shall be
so,</HI> upon one Condition, which I have to propose,
<PB N="320" REF="325"/>
and no other; and what is the Condition, <HI>says he?</HI>
why, <HI>says I,</HI> all the Pretence I can have for the
making-over my own Estate to me, is, that in
Case of your Mortallity, I may have it reserv'd
for me, if I out-live you; well, <HI>says he,</HI> that is
true: But then, <HI>said I,</HI> the Annual Income is
always received by the Husband, during his Life,
as 'tis suppos'd for the mutual Subsistance of the
Family; now, <HI>says I,</HI> here is 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, which
I believe is as much as we shall spend, and I
desire none of it may be sav'd; and all the
Income of your own Estate, the Interest of the
17000 <HI>l.</HI> and the 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year may be constantly
laid by for the Encrease of your Estate, and so,
<HI>added I,</HI> by joining the Interest every Year to the
Capital, you will perhaps grow as rich as you
would do, if you were to Trade with it all, if
you were oblig'd to keep House out of it too.</P>
<P>He lik'd the Proposal very well, <HI>and said</HI> it
should be so; and this way I, in some Measure,
satisfied myself, that I should not bring my Hus∣band
under the Blast of a just Providence, for
mingling my cursed ill-gotten Wealth with his
honest Estate: This was occasion'd by the Reflecti∣ons
which at some certain Intervals of time, came
into my Thoughts, of the Justice oF Heaven, which
I had reason to expect would sometime or other still fall
upon me or my Effects, for the dreadful Life
I had liv'd.</P>
<P>And let no-body conclude from the strange Suc∣cess
I met with in all my wicked Doings, and the
vast Estate which I had rais'd by it, that there∣fore
I either was happy or easie: No, no, there was
a Dart struck into the Liver; there was a secret
Hell within, even all the while, when our Joy was
at the highest; but more especially <HI>now,</HI> after it
was all over, and when according to all appearance,
<PB N="321" REF="326"/>
I was one of the happiest Women upon Earth,
all this while, <HI>I say,</HI> I had such a constant Terror
upon my Mind, as gave me every now and then ve∣ry
terrible Shocks, and which made me expect some∣thing
very frightful upon every Accident of Life.</P>
<P><HI>In a word,</HI> it never Lightn'd or Thunder'd, but
I expected the next Flash wou'd penetrate my
Vitals, and melt the Sword [<HI>Soul</HI>] in this Scab∣bord
of Flesh; it never blew a Storm of Wind,
but I expected the Fall of some Stack of Chim∣neys,
or some Part of the House wou'd bury me
in its Ruins; and so of other things.</P>
<P>But I shall perhaps, have Occasion to speak of
all these things again by-and-by; the Case before
us was in a manner settl'd; we had full four thou∣sand
Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for our future Subsistence,
besides a vast Sum in Jewels and Plate; and be∣sides
this, I had about eight thousand Pounds re∣serv'd
in Money, which I kept back from him, to
provide for my two Daughters; of whom I have
yet much to say.</P>
<P>With this Estate, settl'd as you have heard,
and with the best Husband in the World, I left
<HI>England</HI> again; I had not only in humane Pru∣dence,
and by the Nature of the thing, <HI>being now
marry'd and settl'd in so glorious a Manner,</HI> I say, I
had not only abandon'd all the gay and wicked
Course which I had gone throrow before, but
I began to look back upon it with that Horror,
and that Detestation, which is the certain Com∣panion,
if not the Forerunner, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Repentance.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Wonders of my present Circum∣stances
wou'd work upon me, and I should have
some Raptures upon my Soul, upon the Subject of
my coming so smoothly out of the Arms of Hell,
that I was not ingulph'd in Ruin, as most who
lead such Lives are, first or last; but this was a
<PB N="322" REF="327"/>
Flight too high for me; I was not come to that
Repentance that is rais'd from a Sence of Heaven's
Goodness; I repented of the Crime, but it was of
another and lower kind of Repentance, and ra∣ther
mov'd by my Fears of Vengeance, than from
a Sense of being spar'd from being punish'd, and
landed safe after a Storm.</P>
<P>The first thing which, happen'd after our coming
to the <HI>Hague,</HI> (where we lodg'd For a-while) was,
that my Spouse saluted me one Morning with the
Title of <HI>Countess;</HI> as he said he intended to do, by
having the Inheritance to which the Honour was
annex'd, made over to him; it is true, it was a
Reversion, but it soon fell, and in the mean time,
as all the Brothers of a <HI>Count</HI> are call'd <HI>Counts,</HI> so I
had the Title by Courtesie, about three Years be∣fore
I had it in reality.</P>
<P>I was agreeably surpriz'd at this coming, so soon,
and wou'd have had my Spouse have taken the Mo∣ney
which it cost him, out of my Stock, but he
saugh'd at me, and went on.</P>
<P>I was now in the height of my Glory and Pros∣perity,
and I was call'd the <HI>Countess de</HI>—; for
I had obtain'd that unlook'd for, which I secretly
aim'd at, and was really the main Reason of my
coming Abroad: I took now more Servants; liv'd
in a kind of Magnificence that I had not been ac∣quainted
with; was call'd <HI>Your Honour</HI> at every
word, and had a <HI>Coronet</HI> behind my Coach; tho'
at the same time I knew little or nothing of my
new Pedigree.</P>
<P>The first thing that my Spouse took upon him
to manage, was to declare ourselves marry'd ele∣ven
Years before our arriving in <HI>Holland;</HI> and
consequently to acknowledge our little Son, who
was ye: in <HI>England,</HI> to be legitimate; order him
to be brought over, and added to his Family, and
acknowledge him to be our own.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="328"/>
This was done by giving Notice to his People at
<HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where his Children (which were two
Sons and a Daughter) were brought-up; that he
was come over from <HI>England;</HI> and that he was ar∣riv'd
at the <HI>Hague,</HI> with his Wife, and shou'd re∣side
there some time; and chat he wou'd have his
two Sons brought down to see him, which ac∣cordingly
was done, and where I entertain'd them
with all the Kindness and Tenderness that they
cou'd expect from their Mother-in-Law; and who
pretended to be so ever since they were two or
three Years old.</P>
<P>This supposing as to have been so long marry'd,
was not difficult at-all, in a Country where we had
been seen together about that time, <HI>viz.</HI> eleven
Years and a half before; and where we had never
been seen afterwards, till we now return'd together;
this being seen together, was also openly own'd,
and acknowledg'd of course, by our Friend, the
Merchant at <HI>Rotterdam;</HI> and also by the People in
the House where we both lodg'd, in the same City,
and where our first Intimacies began, and who, as
it happen'd, were all alive; and therefore to make
it the more publick, we made a Tour to <HI>Rotter∣dam</HI>
again, lodg'd in the same House, and was vi∣sited
there by our Friend, the Merchant; and af∣terwards
invited frequently to his House, where
he treated us very handsomely.</P>
<P>This Conduct of my Spouse, and which he
manag'd very cleverly, was indeed, a Testimony
of a wonderful Degree of Honesty and Affection
to our little Son; for it was done purely for the
sake of the Child.</P>
<P>I call it an honest Affection, because it was from
a Principle of Honesty that he so enrnestly con∣cern'd
himself, to prevent the Scandal which wou'd
otherwise have fallen upon the Child, <HI>who was it∣self
<PB N="324" REF="329"/>
innocent;</HI> and as it was from this Principle of
Justice that he so earnestly sollicited me, and con∣jur'd
me by the natural Affections of a Mother,
to marry him, when it was yet young within me,
and unborn, that the Child might not suffer for
the Sin of its Father and Mother; so tho' at the
same time, he really lov'd me very well, yet I had
reason to believe, that it was from this Principle
of Justice to the Child, that, he came to <HI>England</HI>
again to seek me, with design to marry me, and,
<HI>as he call'd it,</HI> save the innocent Lamb from an In∣famy
worse than Death.</P>
<P>It is with a just Reproach to myself, that I must
repeat it again, that I had not the same Concern for
it, tho' it was the Child of my own Body; nor
had I ever the hearty affectionate Love to the
Child, that he had; what the reason of it was, I
cannot tell; and indeed, I had shown a general
Neglect of the Child, thro' all the gay Years of my
<HI>London</HI> Revels; except that I sent <HI>Amy</HI> to look
upon it now and then, and to pay for its Nursing;
as for me, I scarce saw it four times in the first four
Years of its Life, and often wish'd it wou'd go
quietly out of the World; whereas a Son which
I had by the Jeweller, I took a different Care of,
and shew'd a differing Concern for, tho' I did not
let him know me; for I provided very well for
him; had him put out very well to School; and
when he came to Years fit for it, let him go over
with, a Person of Honesty and good Business, to
the <HI>Indies;</HI> and after he had liv'd there some time,
and began to act for himself, sent him over the
Value of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> at several times, with which he
traded, and grew rich; and, <HI>as 'tis to be hop'd,</HI> may
at last come over again with forty or fifty Thou∣sand
Pounds in his Pocket, as many do who have
not such Encouragement at their Beginning.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="330"/>
I also sent him over a Wife; a beautiful young
lady, well-bred, an exceeding good-natur'd plea∣sant
Creature; but the nice young Fellow did not
like her, and had the Impudence to write to me,
<HI>that is, to the Person I employ'd to correspond with him,</HI>
to send him another; and promis'd, that he wou'd
marry her I had sent him, to a Friend of his, who
lik'd her better than he did; but I took it so ill,
that I wou'd not send him another, and withal,
stopp'd another Article of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> which I had ap∣pointed
to send him: He consider'd of it af∣terwards,
and offer'd to take her; but then truly
she took so ill the first Affront he put upon her,
that she wou'd not have him, and I sent him word,
I thought she was very much in the right: How∣ever,
after courting her two Years, and some Friends
interposing, she took him, and made him an ex∣cellent
Wise, as I knew she wou'd; but I never
sent him the thousand Pound Cargo, so that he
lost that Money for misusing me, and took the
Lady at last without it.</P>
<P>My new Spouse and I, liv'd a very regular con∣templative
Life, and in itself certainly a Life fill'd
with all humane Felicity: But if I look'd upon my
present Situation with Satisfaction, as I certainly
did, so in Proportion I on all Occasions look'd
back on former things with Detestation, and with
the utmost Affection; and now indeed, and not
till now, those Reflections began to prey upon my
Comforts, and lessen the Sweets of my other En∣joyments:
They might be said to have gnaw'd a
Hole in my Heart before; but now they made a
Hole quite thro' it; now they eat into all my
pleasant things; made bitter every Sweet, and
mix'd my Sighs with every Smile.</P>
<P>Not all the Affluence or a plentiful Fortune;
not a hundred Thousand Pounds Estate; (for be∣tween
<PB N="326" REF="331"/>
is we had little less) not Honour and Ti∣tles,
Attendants and Equipages; <HI>in a word,</HI> not all
the things we call Pleasure, cou'd give me any
relish, or sweeten the Taste of things to me; <HI>at
least,</HI> not so much, but I grew sad heavy, pen∣sive,
and melancholly; stept little, and eat little;
dream'd continually of the most frightful and ter∣rible
things imaginable: Nothing but Apparitions
of Devils and Monsters; falling into Gulphs, and
off from steep and high Precipices, <HI>and the like;</HI>
so that in the Morning, when I shou'd rise, and
be refresh'd with the Blessing of Rest, I was <HI>Hag∣ridden</HI>
with Frights, and terrible things, form'd
meerly in the Imagination; and was either tir'd,
and wanted Sleep, or over-run with Vapours, and
not fit for conversing with my Family, or any-one
else.</P>
<P>My Husband, the tenderest Creature in the
World, and particularly so to me, was in great
Concern for me, and did every-thing that lay in
his Power, to comfort and restore me; strove to
reason me out of it; then tried all the Ways possi∣ble
to divert me; but it was all to no purpose, or
to but very little.</P>
<P>My only Relief was, sometimes to unbosom
myself to poor <HI>Amy,</HI> when she and I was alone;
and she did all she cou'd to comfort me, but all
was to little Effect there; for tho' <HI>Amy</HI> was the
better Penitent before, when we had been in the
Storm; <HI>Amy</HI> was just where she us'd to be, <HI>now,</HI> a
wild, gay, loose Wretch, and not much the graver
for her Age; for <HI>Amy</HI> was between forty and fifty
by this time too.</P>
<P>But to go on with my own Story; as I had no
Comforter, so I had no Counsellor; it was well,
<HI>as I often thought,</HI> that I was not a <HI>Roman-Catholick;</HI>
for what a piece of Work shou'd I have made, to
<PB N="327" REF="332"/>
have gone to a Priest with such a History as I
had to tell him? and what Pennance wou'd any
<HI>Father-Confessor</HI> have oblig'd me to perform? especi∣ally
if he had been honest and true to his Office.</P>
<P>However, as I had none of the recourse, so I
had none of the Absolution, by which the Crimi∣nal
confessing, goes away comforted; but I went
about with a Heart loaded with Crime, and alto∣gether
in the dark, as to what I was to do; and in
this Condition I languish'd near two Years; I may
well call it languishing, for if Providence had not
reliev'd me, I shou'd have died in little time: <HI>But
of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>I must now go back to another Scene, and join
it to this End of my Story, which will compleat
all my Concern with <HI>England, at least,</HI> all that I
shall bring into this Account. I have hinted at
large, what I had done for my two Sons, one at
<HI>Messina,</HI> and the other in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>But I have not gone thorow the Story of my two
Daughters: I was so in danger of being known by
one of them, that I durst not see her, so as to let
her know who I was; and for the other, I cou'd
not well know how to see her, and own her, and
let her see me, because she must then know that
I wou'd not let her Sister know me, which wou'd
look strange; so that upon the whole, I resolv'd
to see neither of them at-all, but <HI>Amy</HI> manag'd all
that for me; and when she had made Gentlewo∣men
of them both, by giving them a good tho'
late Education, she had like to have blown up the
whole Case, and herself and me too, by an unhap∣py
Discovery of herself to the last of them, <HI>that is,</HI>
to her who was our Cookmaid, and who, <HI>as I said
before, Amy</HI> had been oblig'd to turn away, for
fear of the very Discovery which now happen'd:
I have observ'd already in what Manner <HI>Amy</HI> ma∣nag'd
<PB N="328" REF="333"/>
her by a third Person; and how the Girl,
when she was set up for a Lady, <HI>as above,</HI> came and
visited <HI>Amy</HI> at my Lodgings; after which, <HI>Amy</HI>
going, as was her Custom, to see the Girl's Bro∣ther,
(my Son) at the honest Man's House in <HI>Spit∣tle-Fields;</HI>
both the Girls were there, meerly by ac∣cident,
at the same time, and the other Girl una∣wares
discover'd the Secret; <HI>namely,</HI> that this was
the Lady that had done all this for them.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was greatly surpriz'd at if, but as she saw
there was no Remedy, she made a Jest of it; and so
after that, convers'd openly, being still satisfied
that neither of them cou'd make much of it, as
long a they knew nothing of me: So she took
them together one time, and told them the Hi∣story,
<HI>as she call'd it, of their Mother;</HI> beginning
at the miserable carrying them to their Aunt's
she own'd she was not their Mother, herself, but
describ'd her to them: However, when she said she
was not their Mother, one of them express'd herself
very much surpriz'd, for the Girl had taken up a
strong Fancy that <HI>Amy</HI> was really her Mother;
and that she had for some particular Reasons, con∣ceal'd
it from her; and therefore when she told her
frankly that she was not her Mother, the Girl fell
a-crying, and <HI>Amy</HI> had much ado to keep Life in
her: This was the Girl who was at first my Cook∣maid
in the <HI>Pallmall;</HI> when <HI>Amy</HI> had brought her
to again a little, and she had recover'd her first Dis∣order,
<HI>Amy</HI> ask'd what ail'd her? the poor Girl
hung about her, and kiss'd her, and was in such
a Passion still, tho' she was a great Wench of
Nineteen or Twenty Years old, that she cou'd
not be brought to speak a great-while; at last, ha∣ving
recover'd her Speech, she said still, <HI>But O do
not say you a'n't my Mother! I'm sure you are my
Mother;</HI> and then the Girl cry'd again like to kill
<PB N="329" REF="334"/>
herself; <HI>Amy</HI> cou'd not tell what to do with her a
good-while; she was loth to say again, <HI>she was not
her Mother,</HI> because she wou'd not throw her into
a Fit of crying again; but she went round about
little with her: Why Child, <HI>says she,</HI> why wou'd
you have me be your Mother? If it be because I
am so kind to you, be easie, my Dear, says <HI>Amy,</HI>
I'll be as kind to you still, as if I was your Mother.</P>
<P>Ay but, <HI>says the Girl,</HI> I am sure you are my Mo∣ther
too; and what have I done that you won't
own me, and that you will not be call'd my Mo∣ther?
tho' I am poor, you have made me a Gen∣tlewoman,
<HI>says she,</HI> and I won't do any-thing to
disgrace you; besides, <HI>adds she,</HI> I can keep a Secret
too, especially for my own Mother, sure; then
she calls <HI>Amy</HI> her <HI>Dear Mother,</HI> and hung about
her Neck again, crying still vehemently.</P>
<P>This last Part of the Girl's Words alam'd <HI>Amy,</HI>
and, <HI>as she told me,</HI> frighted her terribly; nay, she
was so confounded with, it, that she was not able to
govern herself, or to conceal her Disorder from the
Girl herself, <HI>as you shall hear: Amy</HI> was at a full Stop,
and confus'd to the last Degree; and the Girl a
sharp Jade, turn'd it upon her: My dear Mother,
<HI>says she,</HI> do not be uneasie about it; I know it all;
but do not be unensie, I won't let my Sister know
a word of it, or my Brother either, without you
give me leave; but don't disown me now you
have found me; don't hide yourself from me any
longer; I can't bear that, <HI>says she,</HI> it will break my
Heart.</P>
<P>I think the Girl's mad, <HI>says Amy;</HI> why Child,
I tell thee, if I was thy Mother I wou'd not dis∣own
thee; don't you see I am as kind to you as if
I was your Mother? <HI>Amy</HI> might as well have sung
a Song to a Kettle-Drum, as talk to her: Yes, <HI>says
the Girl,</HI> you are very good to me indeed; and
<PB N="330" REF="335"/>
that was enough, to make any-body believe she
was her Mother too; but however, that was not
the Case, she had other Reasons to believe, and
to know that she was her Mother; and it was a sad
thing she wou'd not let her call her Mother, who
was her own Child.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was so Heart-full with the Disturbance of
it, that she did not enter farther with her into the
Enquiry, as she wou'd otherwise have done; I mean,
as to what made the Girl so positive, but
comes away, and tells me the whole Story.</P>
<P>I was Thunder-struck with the Story at first,
and much more afterwards, <HI>as you shall hear;</HI> but,
<HI>I say,</HI> I was Thunder-struck at first, and amaz'd,
and said to <HI>Amy,</HI> There must be something or o∣ther
in it more than we know of; but having exa∣min'd
farther into it, I found the Girl had no No∣tion
of any-body, but of <HI>Amy;</HI> and glad I was
that I was not concern'd in the Pretence, and that
the Girl had no Notion of me in it: But even this
Easiness did not continue long, for the next time
<HI>Amy</HI> went to see her, she was the same thing, and
rather more violent with <HI>Amy</HI> than she was before:
<HI>Amy</HI> endeavour'd to pacifie her by all the Ways
imaginable; <HI>first,</HI> she told her, she took it ill that
she wou'd not believe her; <HI>and told her,</HI> if she
wou'd not give over such a foolish Whimsie, she
wou'd leave her to the wide World, as she found
her.</P>
<P>This put the Girl into Fits, and she cry'd ready
to kill herself and hung about <HI>Amy</HI> again, like a
Child; Why, <HI>says Amy,</HI> why can yon not be easie
with me then, and compose yourself, and let me
go on to do you good, and show you Kindness,
as I wou'd do, and as I intend to do? Can you
think that if I was your Mother, I would not tell
you so? What Whimsie is this that possesses your
<PB N="331" REF="336"/>
Mind? <HI>says Amy:</HI> Well, the Girl told her in a few
Words, but those few such as frighted <HI>Amy</HI> out of
her Wits, land me too; That she knew well enough
how it was; I know, <HI>says she,</HI> when you left—,
<HI>naming the Village,</HI> where I liv'd when my Father
went away from us all, that you went over to
<HI>France,</HI> I know that too, and who you went with,
<HI>says the Girl;</HI> did not my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> come back
again with you? I know it all well enough, tho'
I was but a Child, I have heard it all.—And thus
she run on with such Discourse, as put <HI>Amy</HI> out
of all Temper again; and she rav'd at her like
a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and <HI>told her,</HI> she wou'd never come
near her any more; she might go a-begging again
if she wou'd; she'd have nothing to do with her:
The Girl, a passionate Wench, <HI>told her,</HI> she knew
the worst of it, she cou'd go to Service again, and
if she wou'd not own her own Child, she must do
as she pleas'd then she fell into a Passion or crying
again, as if she wou'd kill herself.</P>
<P><HI>In short,</HI> this Girl's Conduct terrify'd <HI>Amy</HI> to the
last Degree, and me too, and was it not that we
knew the Girl was quite wrong in some things,
she was yet so right in some other, that it gave me
a great-deal of Perplexity; but that which put
<HI>Amy</HI> the most to it, was, that the Girl <HI>(my Daugh∣ter)</HI>
told her, that she (<HI>meaning me her Mother</HI>) had
gone away with the <HI>Jeweller,</HI> and into <HI>France</HI> too;
she did not call him <HI>the Jeweller,</HI> but with the
Landlord of the House; who, after her Mother
fell into Distress, and that <HI>Amy</HI> had taken all the
Children from her, made much of her, and after∣wards
marry'd her.</P>
<P><HI>In short,</HI> it was plain the Girl had but a broken
Account of things, but yet, that she had receiv'd
some Accounts that had a reallity in the Bottom of
them, so that it seems our first Measures, and the
<PB N="332" REF="337"/>
Amour with the <HI>Jeweller,</HI> were not so conceal'd as I
thought they had been; and it seems, came in a bro∣ken
manner to to my Sister-in-Law, who <HI>Amy</HI> carry'd
the Children to, and she made some Bustle it seems,
about it; but as good-luck was, it was too late,
and I was remov'd, and gone, none knew whither;
or else me wou'd have sent all the Children home
to me again, <HI>to be sure.</HI></P>
<P>This we pick'd out of the Girl's Discourse, <HI>that
is to say, Amy</HI> did, at several times; but it all con∣sisted,
of broken Fragments of Stories, such as the
Girl herself had heard so long ago, that she herself
cou'd make very little of it; only that in the main,
that her Mother had play'd the Whore; had gone
away with the Gentleman that was Landlord of
the House; that he married her; that she went
into <HI>France;</HI> and as she had learn'd in my Family,
where she was a Servant, that Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> and her
Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> had been in <HI>France</HI> together; so she
put all these things together, and joining them
with the great Kindness that <HI>Amy</HI> now shew'd
her, possess'd the Creature that Amy was really
her Mother; nor was it possible for Amy to con∣quer
it for a long time.</P>
<P>But this, after I had search'd into it as far as
by <HI>Amy</HI>'s relation I cou'd get an Account of it,
did not disquiet me half so much, as that the
young Slut had got the Name of <HI>Roxana</HI> by the
end; and that she knew who her Lady <HI>Roxana</HI>
was, <HI>and the like;</HI> tho' this neither, did not hang
together, for then she wou'd not have fix'd upon
<HI>Amy</HI> for her Mother: But some time after, when
<HI>Amy</HI> had almost perswaded her our of it, and that
the Girl began to be so confounded in her Dis∣courses
of it, that they made neither Head nor
Tail; at last, the passionate Creature flew out
in a kind of Rage, <HI>and said to</HI> Amy, That
<PB N="333" REF="338"/>
if she was not her Mother, Madam <HI>Roxana</HI> was
her Mother; then, for one of them, <HI>she was sure,</HI>
was her Mother; and then all this that <HI>Amy</HI> had
done for her, was by Madam <HI>Roxana's,</HI> Order;
and I am sure, <HI>says she,</HI> it was my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI>'s
Coach that brought the Gentlewoman (whoever
it was) to my Uncle's in <HI>Spittle-Fields;</HI> for the
Coachman told me sob: <HI>Amy</HI> fell a- laughing at her
aloud, <HI>as was her usual way;</HI> but as <HI>Amy</HI> told me,
it was but on one side of her Mouth; for she was
so confounded at her Discourse, that she was ready
to sink into the Ground; and so was I too, when
she told it me.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Amy</HI> brazen'd her out of it all; <HI>told
her,</HI> Well, since you think you are so high-born,
as to be my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI>'s Daughter, you may
go to her and claim your Kindred, can't you? I
suppose, <HI>says Amy,</HI> you know where to find her?
<HI>She said,</HI> she did not question to find her, for she
knew Where she was gone to live privately; but
tho' she might be remov'd again, for I know how
it is, says she, with a kind of a Smile, or a Grin;
I know how it all is, well enough.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was so provok'd, that she told me, <HI>in short,</HI>
she began to think it wou'd be absolutely necessary
to murther her: That Expression fill'd me with
Horror; all my Blood ran chill in my Veins, and
a Fit of trembling seiz'd me, that I cou'd not
speak a good-while; at last, What is the Devil
in you, <HI>Amy, said I?</HI> Nay, nay, <HI>says she,</HI> let it be
the Devil, or not the Devil, it I thought he knew
one tittle of your History, I wou'd dispatch her
if she were my own Daughter a thousand times;
and I <HI>says I in a Rage,</HI> as well as I love you, wou'd
be the first that shou'd put the Halter about your
Neck, and see you hang<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, with more Satisfaction
than ever I saw you in my Life; nay, <HI>says I,</HI> you
<PB N="334" REF="339"/>
wou'd not live to be hang'd, <HI>I believe,</HI> I shou'd cut
your Throat with my own Hand; I am almost rea∣dy
to do it, <HI>said I,</HI> as 'tis, for your but naming
the thing; with that, I call'd her cursed Devil,
and bade her get one of the Room.</P>
<P>I think it was the first time that ever I was an∣gry
with <HI>Amy</HI> in all my Life; and when all was
done, tho' she was a devilish Jade in having such
a Thought, yet in was all of it the Effect of her
Excess of Affection and Fidelity to me.</P>
<P>But this thing gave me a terrible Shock, for it
happn'd just after I was marry'd, and serv'd to
hasten my going over to <HI>Holland;</HI> for I wou'd not
have been seen, to as to be known by the Name of
<HI>Roxana,</HI> no, not for ten Thousand Pounds; it
wou'd have been enough to have ruin'd me to all
Intents and Purposes with my Husband, and every∣body
else too; I might: as well have been the <HI>Ger∣man
Princess.</HI></P>
<P>Well, I set <HI>Amy</HI> to-work, and give <HI>Amy</HI> her
due, she set all her Wits to-work, to find out
which way this Girl had her Knowledge but
more particularly, how much Knowledge she had,
<HI>that is to say,</HI> what she really knew, and what she
did not know; for this was the main thing with
me how he cou'd say she knew who Madam
<HI>Roxana</HI> was, and what notions she had of that
Affair was very mysterious to me; sor 'twas cer∣tain
she cou'd not have a right Notion of me, be∣cause
she wou'd have it be, that <HI>Amy</HI> was her Mo∣ther.</P>
<P>I scolded hearity at <HI>Amy,</HI> for letting the Girl
ever know her, <HI>that is to say,</HI> know her in this Af∣fair
for that she knew her, cou'd not be hid, be∣cause
she, <HI>as I might say,</HI> serv'd <HI>Amy,</HI> or rather
under <HI>Amy,</HI> in my Family, <HI>as is said before;</HI> but
she <HI>(Amy)</HI> talk'd with her at first by another Per∣son,
<PB N="335" REF="340"/>
and not by herself; and than Secret came out
by an Accident, <HI>as I have said above.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was concern'd at it as well as I, but cou'd
not help it; and tho' it gave us great Uneasiness,
yet us there was no Remedy, we were bound to
make as little Noise of in as we cou'd, that it
might go no farther: I bade <HI>Amy</HI> punish the Girl
for it, <HI>and she did so,</HI> for she parted with her in a
Huff, <HI>and told her,</HI> she shou'd see, she was not her
Mother, for that she cou'd leave her just where she
found her; and seeing she cou'd not be content to
be servd by the Kindness of a Friend, but that she
wou'd needs make a Mother of her, she wou'd
for the future, be neither Mother or Friend; and
to bid her go to Service again, and be a Drudge,
as she was before.</P>
<P>The poor Girl cry'd most lamentably, but wou'd
not be beaten out of it still; but that which dum∣tounded
<HI>Amy</HI> more than all the rest, was, that
when she had rated the poor Girl a long time,
and cou'd not beat her out of it, and had, <HI>as I
have observ'd,</HI> threaten'd to leave her; the Girl
kept to what she said before, and put this Turn to
it again; that she was sure, it Amy wa'n't, my
Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was, her Mother; and that she
wou'd go find her out; <HI>adding,</HI> that she made no
doubt but she cou'd do it, for she knew where to
enquire the Name or her new Husband.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> came home with this Piece of News in her
Mouth, to me; I cou'd easily perceive when she
came in that she was mad in her Mind, and in a
Rage at something or other, and was in great Pain
to get it out; for when she came first in, my Hus∣band
was in the Room; however, <HI>Amy</HI> going up
to undress her, I soon made an Excuse to follow
her, and coming into the Room; What the D—I
is the Manner, <HI>Amy</HI> says, I▪ am sure you have
<PB N="336" REF="341"/>
some bad News: News, <HI>says Amy, aloud,</HI> ay, so I
have; I think the D—I is in that young Wench,
she'll ruin us all, and herself too, there's no quiet∣ing
her: So she went on, and told me all the Par∣ticulars;
but sure nothing was so astonish'd as I
was when she told me that the Girl knew I was
marry'd; that she knew my Husband's Name,
and wou'd endeavour to find me out; I thought
I should have sunk down at the very Words; in
the middle of all my Amazement, <HI>Amy</HI> starts up,
and runs about the Room like a distracted body;
I'll, put an End to it, that I will; I can't bear it;
I must murther her; I'll kill her B—, <HI>and
swears by her Maker, in the most serious Tone in the
World;</HI> and then repeated it over three or four
times, walking to-and-again in the Room; I will,
<HI>in short,</HI> I will kill her, if there was, not another
Wench, in the World.</P>
<P>Prethee hold thy Tongue, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> why
thou art mad; ay, so I am, <HI>says she,</HI> stark-mad,
but I'll be the Death of her for-all that, and then
I shall be sober again: But you shan't, <HI>says I,</HI>
you shan't hurt a Hair of her Head; why you
ought to be hang'd for what you have done al∣ready;
for having resolv'd on it, is doing it,
as to the Guilt of the Fact; you are Murthe∣rer
already, as much as it you had done it al∣ready.</P>
<P>I know that, <HI>says Amy,</HI> and it can be no worse;
I'll put you out of your Pain, and her too; she
shall never challenge you for her Mother in this
World, whatever she may in; the next: Well
well, says I, be quiet, ant do not talk thus, I
can't bear it; so she grew a little soberer after a∣while.</P>
<P>I must acknowledge, the Notion of being dis∣cover'd, carried
with it so many frightful <HI>Ideas,</HI>
<PB N="337" REF="342"/>
and hurry'd my Thoughts so much, that I was
scarce myself, any more than <HI>Amy,</HI> so dreadful a
thing is a Load of Guilt upon the Mind.</P>
<P>And yet when <HI>Amy</HI> began the second time, to
talk thus abominably of killing the poor Child,
of murthering her, and swore by her Maker that
she wou'd, so that I began to see that she was
in earnest, I was farther terrified a great deal, and
it help'd to bring me to myself again in other
Cases.</P>
<P>We laid our Heads together then, to see if it
was possible to discover by what means she had
learn'd to talk so, and how she (<HI>I mean my Girl</HI>)
came to know that her Mother had marry'd a
Husband; but it wou'd not do, the Girl wou'd
acknowlege nothing, and gave but a very imperfect
Account of things still, being disgusted to the last
Degree with <HI>Amy</HI>'s leaving her so abruptly as
she did.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy</HI> went to the House where the Boy was,
but it was all one; there they had only heard a
confus'd Story of the <HI>somebody,</HI> they knew not
who, which this same Wench had told them, but
they gave no heed to it at-all: <HI>Amy</HI> told them
how foolishly the Girl had acted; and how she
had carry'd on the Whimsie so far, in spight of
all they cou'd say to her; that she had taken it to
ill, she wou'd see her no more, and so she might
e'en go to Service again if she wou'd, for she <HI>(Amy)</HI>
wou'd have nothing to do with her, unless she
humbled herself, and chang'd her Note, and that
quickly too.</P>
<P>The good old Gentleman who had been the Be∣nefactor
to them all, was greatly concern'd at it,
and the good Woman his Wife was griev'd be∣yond
all expressing, and begg'd her Ladyship, <HI>mean∣ing
Amy,</HI> not to resent it, they promis'd too, they
<PB N="338" REF="343"/>
would talk with her about it; and the old Gentle-woman
added, <HI>with same Astonishment,</HI> Sure she can∣not
be such a Fool but she will be prevail'd with
to hold her Tongue, when she has it from your
own Mouth, that you are not her Mother, and sees
that it disobliges your Ladyship to have her insist
upon it and so <HI>Amy</HI> came away, with some Ex∣pectation
that it wou'd be stopp'd here.</P>
<P>But the Girl was such a Fool for-all that, and
persisted in it obstinately, notwithstanding all they
cou'd say to her; nay, her Sister begg'd and in∣treated
her not to play the Fool, for that it wou'd
ruin her too; and that the Lady (<HI>meaning Amy</HI>)
wou'd abandon them both.</P>
<P>Well, notwithstanding this, she insisted, <HI>I say,</HI>
upon it, and which was worse, the longer it lasted,
the more she began to drop <HI>Amy</HI>'s Ladyship, and
wou'd have it, that the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was her Mo∣ther
and that she had made some Enquiries about
it, and did not doubt but she shou'd find her out.</P>
<P>When it was come to this, and we found there
was nothing to be done with the Girl, but that she
was so obstinately bent upon the Search after me,
that she ventur'd to forfeit all she had in view;
<HI>I say</HI> when I found it was come to this, I began
to be more serious in my Preparations of my going
beyond-Sea; and particularly, it gave me some rea∣son
to fear that there was something in it; but the
following Accident put me beside all my Measures,
and struck me into the greatest Confusion that ever
I was in, in my Life.</P>
<P>I was so near going Abroad, that my Spouse and
I had taken Measures for our going-off; and be∣cause
I wou'd be sure not to go too publick, but
so as to take away all Possibility of being seen, I
had made some Exception to my Spouse against
going in the ordinary publick Passage-Boats; my
<PB N="339" REF="344"/>
Pretence to him, was the promisouous Crowds in
those Vessels; want of Convenience, <HI>and the like;</HI>
so he took the Hint, And found me out an <HI>English</HI>
Merchant-Ship, which was bound for <HI>Rotterdam,</HI>
and getting soon acquainted with the Master, he
hir'd his whole Ship, <HI>that is so say,</HI> his Great-Cab∣bin,
for I do not mean his Ship for Freight; that
so we had all the Conveniences possible, for our
Passage; and all things being near ready, he brought
home the Captain one Day to Dinner with him,
that I might see him, and be acquainted a little
with him; so we came, after Dinner, to talk of
the Ship, and the Conveniences on-board, and the
Captain press'd me earnestly to come on-board,
and see the Ship, intimating, That he wou'd
treat us as well as he cou'd; and in Discourse I
happen'd to say, I hop'd he had no other Passen∣gers;
<HI>he said,</HI> No, he had not; but, <HI>he said,</HI> his
Wife had courted him a good-while to let her go
over to <HI>Holland</HI> with him, for he always us'd that
Trade, but he never cou'd think of venturing all
he had in one Bottom; but if I went with him, he
thought to take her and her Kinswoman along with
him this Voyage, that they might both wait upon
me; <HI>and so added,</HI> that if we wou'd do him the
Honour to Dine on-board the next Day, he wou'd
bring his Wife on-board, the better to make us
welcome.</P>
<P>Who now cou'd have believ'd the Devil had
any Snare at the Bottom of all this? or that I
was in any Danger on such an Occasion, so remore
and out of the way as this was? But the Event
was the oddest that cou'd be thought of: As it
happen'd, <HI>Amy</HI> was not at-home when we accepted
this Invitation, and so she was left out of the
Company; but instead of <HI>Amy,</HI> we took our ho∣nest,
good-humour'd, never-to-be-omitted Friend
<PB N="340" REF="345"/>
the QU<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>KER, one of the best Creatures <HI>that
ever liv'd,</HI> sure; and who, besides a thousand good
Qualities unmix'd with one bad one, was parti∣cularly
Excellent for being the best Company in
The World; tho' I think I had carry'd <HI>Amy</HI> too,
If she had not been engag'd in this unhappy Girl's
Affair; for on a sudden the Girl was lost, and no
News was to be heard of her, and <HI>Amy</HI> had hunt∣ed
her to every Place she cou'd think of, that it was
likely to find her in, but all the News she cou'd hear
of her, was, That she eas gone to an old Come∣rade's
House of hers, which she call'd Sister, and
who was marry'd to a Master of a Ship who liv'd
At <HI>Redriff,</HI> and even this the Jade never told me:
It seems when this Girl was directed by Amy to
get her some Br'ceding, go to the Boarding-School,
<HI>and the like,</HI> she was recommended to a Boarding-School at <HI>Camberwell,</HI> and there she contracted an
Acquaintance with a young Lady <HI>(so they are all
Call'd)</HI> her Bedfellow, that they call'd Sisters, and
promis'd never to break off their Acquaintaince.</P>
<P>But judge you what an unaccountable Surprized
must be in, when I came on-board the Ship, and
was brought into the Captain's Cabbin, or, <HI>what
they call it,</HI> the Great-Cabbin of the Ship, to see
his Lady or Wife, and another young Person with
her, who, when I came to see her near-hand, was
my old Cook-Maid in the Pall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all, and as appear'd
by the Sequel of the Story, was neither more or
less, than my own Daughter; that I knew her, was
out of Doubt; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tho' she had not had Oppor∣tunity
to see me very often, yet I had often seen
her, <HI>as I must needs,</HI> being in my own Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly to
long.</P>
<P>If <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver I had need of Courage, and a said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
sence of Mind, it was now; it was the only val<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣le
Secret in the World to me; all depended upon
<PB N="341" REF="346"/>
this Occasion; it the Girl knew me, I was un∣done;
and to discover any Suprize or Disorder,
had been to make her know me, or guess it, and
discover herself.</P>
<P>I was once going to seign a swooning, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint∣away,
and so falling on the Ground, or Floor, put
them all into a Hurry and Fright, and by that
means get an Opportunity to be continually hold∣ing
something to my Nose to smell to, and so hold
my Hand, or my Handkerchief, or both, before
my Mouth; then pretend I cou'd not bear the
Smell of the Ship, or the closeness of the Cabbin;
but that wou'd have been only to remove into a
clearer Air upon the Quarter-Deck, where we shou'd
with it, have had a clearer Light too; and if I had
pretended the Smell of the Ship, it wou'd have
serv'd only to have carry'd us all on-Shoar, to the
Captain's House, which was hard-by; for the Ship
lay so close to the Shore, that we only walk'd
over a Plank to go on-board, and over another
Ship which lay within her; so this not appearing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easible, and the Thought not being two Minutes
old, there was no time, for the two Ladies rise up,
and we saluted, so that I was bound to come so
near <HI>my Girl,</HI> as to kiss her, which I wou'd not
have done, had it been possible to Have avoided
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t;but there was no room to escape.</P>
<P>I cannot but take Notice here, that notwith∣standing
there was a secret Horror upon my Mind,
and I was ready to sink when I came close to her,
to salute her; yet it was a secret inconceivable Plea∣sure
to me when I kiss'd her, to know that I kiss'd
my own Child; my own Flesh and Blood, born of
my Body; and who I had never kiss'd since I took
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atal Farewel of them all, with a Million or
Tears, and a Heart almost dead with Grief, when
<HI>Amy</HI> and the Good Woman took them all away,
<PB N="342" REF="347"/>
and went with them to <HI>Spittle-Fields:</HI> No Pen can
describe, no Words can express, <HI>I say,</HI> the strange
Impression which this thing made upon my Spi∣rits;
I felt something shoot thro' my Blood; my
Heart flutter'd; my Head flash'd, and was dizzy,
and ail within me, <HI>as I thought,</HI> turn'd about, and
much, ado I had, not to abandon myself to an Excess
of Passion at the first Sight of her, much more
when my Lips touch'd her Face; I thought I must
have taken her in my Arms, and kiss'd her again
a thousand times, whether I wou'd or no.</P>
<P>But I rous'd up my Judgment, and shook it off,
And with infinite Uneasiness in my Mind, I sat
down: You will not wonder, if upon this Sur∣prize
I was not conversible for some Minutes, and
that the Disorder had almost discover'd itself; I
had a Complication or severe things upon me;
I cou'd not conceal my Disorder without the ut∣most
Difficulty; and yet upon my concealing it,
depended the whole of my Prosperity; so I us'd
all manner of Violence with myself, to prevent
the Mischief which was at the Door.</P>
<P>Well, I saluted her; but as I went first forward
to the Captain's Lady, who was at the farther-end
of the Cabbin, towards the Light, I had the Oc∣casion
offer'd, to stand with my Back to the Light,
when I turn'd about to her, who stood more on
my Left-hand, so that she had not a fair Sight
of me, tho' I was so near her; I trembled, and
knew neither what I did, or said; I was in the
utmost Extremity, between so many particular
Circumstances as lay upon me; for I was to con∣ceal
my Disorder from every-body, at the ut∣most
Peril, and at the same time expected every∣body
wou'd discern it; I was to expect she wou'd
discover that she knew me, and yet was, by all means
possible, to prevent it; I was to conceal myself, if
<PB N="343" REF="348"/>
possible, and yet had not the least room to do
any-thing towards it; <HI>in short,</HI> there was no re∣treat;
no shifting any-thing off; no avoiding or
preventing her having a full Sight of me; nor was
there any counterfeiting my Voice, for then my Hus∣band
wou'd have perceiv'd it; <HI>in short,</HI> there was not
the least Circumstance that offer'd me any Assist∣ance,
or any favourable thing to help me in this
Exigence.</P>
<P>After I had been upon the Rack for near half
an Hour, during which, I appear'd stiff and reserv'd,
and a little too formal; my Spouse and the Cap∣tain
fell into Discourses about the Ship, and the
Sea, and Business remote from us Women, and
by-and-by the Captain carry'd him out upon the
Quarter-Deck, and left us all by ourselves, in
the Great-Cabbin: Then we began to be a lit∣tle
freer one with another, and I began to be a lit∣tle
reviv'd, by a sudden Fancy of my own, <HI>namely,</HI>
I thought I perceiv'd that the Girl did not know
me; and the chief Reason of my having such a
Notion, was, because I did not perceive the least
Disorder in her Countenance, or the least Change
in her Carriage; no Confusion, no Hesitation in
her Discourse; <HI>nor,</HI> which had my Eye particu∣larly
upon, did I observe that she fix'd her Eyes
much upon me, <HI>that is to say,</HI> not singling me out
to look steddily at me, as I thought wou'd have
been the Case; but that she rather singl'd out my
Friend the QUAKER, and chatted with her on
several things; but I observ'd too, that it was all
about indifferent Matters.</P>
<P>This greatly encourag'd me, and I began to be a
little chearful; but I was knock'd down again as
with a Thunder-Clap, when turning to the Cap∣tain's
Wife, and discoursing of me, <HI>she said to her,</HI>
Sister, I cannot but think <HI>(my Lady)</HI> to be very
<PB N="344" REF="349"/>
much like such a Person, <HI>then she nam'd the Per∣son</HI>
and the Captains Wife said, <HI>she thoght so
too;</HI> the Girl reply'd again, <HI>she was sure she had
seen me before, but she cou'd not recollect where;</HI> I an∣swer'd,
(tho' her Speech was not directed to me)
<HI>That I fancy'd she had not seen me before, in</HI> England,
but ask'd, if she had liv'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> She said, <HI>No,
no, she had never been out of</HI> England; and I added;
<HI>That she cou'd not then have known me in</HI> England
<HI>unless it was very lately, for had liv'd, at Rot∣terdam
a great while:</HI> This carry'd me out of
that, Part of the Broil, pretty well; and to
make it go off the better, when a little <HI>Dutch</HI> Boy
came into the Cabbin, who belong'd to the Cap∣tain,
and who I easily perceiv'd to be <HI>Dutch,</HI> I
jested, and talk'd <HI>Dutch</HI> to him, and was merry
about the Boy, <HI>that is to say,</HI> as merry as the
Consternation I was still in, wou'd let me be.</P>
<P>However, I began to be thorowly convinc'd
by this time, that the Girl did not know me,
which was an infinite Satisfaction to me; or,
<HI>at least,</HI> that tho' she had some Notion of me, yet
that she did not think any-thing about my being
who I was, and which perhaps, she wou'd have
been as glad to have known, as I wou'd have
been surpriz'd if she had; indeed it was evident,
that had she suspected any-thing of the Truth, she
would not have been able to have conceal'd it.</P>
<P>Thus this Meeting went off, and, <HI>you may be sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re,</HI>
I was resolv'd, if once I got off of it, she should ne∣ver
see me again, to revive her Fancy; but I was mi∣staken
there too, <HI>as you shall hear:</HI> After we had been
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-board, the Captain's Lady carry'd us <HI>home to</HI>
her House, which was but just on-shore, and treat∣ed
us there again, very handsmely, and made us
promise that we wou'd come again and see her besfore
we went, to concert our Affairs for the Voy∣age,
<PB N="345" REF="350"/>
<HI>and the like;</HI> for she assur'd us, that both
she and her Sister went the Voyage at that time,
for our Company; and I thought to myself, <HI>Then
you'll never go the Voyage at-all;</HI> for I saw from that
Moment, that it wou'd be no way convenient for <HI>my
Ladyship</HI> to go with them; for that frequent Con∣versation
might bring me to her Mind, and she
wou'd certainly claim her Kindred to me in a few
Days, us indeed, wou'd have been the Case.</P>
<P>It is hardly possible for me to conceive what
wou'd have been our Part in this Affair, had my
Woman <HI>Amy</HI> gone with me on-board this Ship;
it had certainly blown-up the whole Affair, and I
must for-ever after have been this Girl's Vassal,
<HI>that is to say,</HI> have let her into the Secret; and trust∣ed
to her keeping in too, or have been expos'd, and
undone; <HI>the very Thought fill'd me with Horror.</HI></P>
<P>But I was not so unhappy neither, as it fell out,
for <HI>Amy</HI> was not with us, and that was my De∣liverance
indeed; yet we had another Chance to
get over still: As I resolv'd to put off the Voyage,
so I resolv'd to put Off the Visit, <HI>you may be sure;</HI>
going upon this Principle, <HI>namely,</HI> that I was fix'd
in it, that the Girl had seen her last of me, and
shou'd never see me more.</P>
<P>However, to bring myself well off, and withal
to see (if I cou'd) a little farther into the Matter,
I sent my Friend, the QUAKER, to the Cap∣tain's
Lady, to make the Visit promis'd, and to
make my Excuse that I cou'd not possibly wait on
her, for that I was very much out of Order; and
in the end of the Discourse, I bade her insinuate
to them, that she was afraid I shou'd not be able
to get ready to go the Voyage, so soon as the
Captain wou'd be oblig'd to go; and that per∣haps
we might put it off to his next Voyage:
I did not let the QUAKER into any other Rea∣son
<PB N="346" REF="351"/>
for it, than that I was indispos'd; and not
knowing what other Face to put upon that Part,
I made her believe that I thought I was a-breed∣ing.</P>
<P>It was easie to put that into her Head, and she
of course hinted to the Captain's Lady, that she
found me so very ill, that she was afraid I wou'd
miscarry; and then, <HI>to be sure,</HI> I cou'd not think
of going.</P>
<P>She went, and she managd that Part very dexte∣rously,
<HI>as I knew she wou'd,</HI> tho' she knew not a
word of the grand Reason of my Indisposition;
but I was all sunk, and dead-hearted again, when
she told me, She cou'd not understand the Mean∣ing
of one thing in her Visit, <HI>namely,</HI> That the
young Woman, <HI>as she call'd her,</HI> that was with the
Captain's Lady, and who she call'd Sister, was most
impertinently inquisitive into things; as who I was?
How long I had been in <HI>England?</HI> Where I had
liv'd? <HI>and the like;</HI> and that, <HI>above all the rest,</HI>
she enquir'd if I did not live once at the other
end of the Town.</P>
<P>I thought her Enquiries so out of the way, <HI>says
the honest</HI> QUAKER, that I gave her not the least
Satisfaction but as I saw by <HI>the</HI> Answers on-board
the Ship, when she talk'd of <HI>thee,</HI> that <HI>thou</HI> did'st
not incline to let her be acquainted with <HI>thee,</HI> so
I was resolv'd that she shou'd not be much the
wiser for me; and when she ask'd me if <HI>thou</HI>
ever liv'd'st <HI>here or there,</HI> I always said <HI>No;</HI> but
that <HI>thou</HI> wast a <HI>Dutch</HI> Lady, and was going home
again to <HI>thy</HI> Family, and liv'd Abroad.</P>
<P>I thank'd her very heartily for that Part, and
indeed, she serv'd me in it, more than I let her
know she did; <HI>in a word,</HI> she thwarted the Girl
so cleverly, that if she had known the whole Af∣fair,
she cou'd not have done it better.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="352"/>
But I must acknowledge, all this put me upon
the Rack again, and I was quite discourag'd, not
at-all doubting but that the Jade had a right Scent
of things, and that she knew and remember'd my
Face, but had artfully conceal'd her Knowledge
of me, till she might perhaps, do it more to my
Disadvantage; I told all this to <HI>Amy, for she was
all the Relief I had:</HI> The poor Soul (<HI>Amy</HI>) was rea∣dy
to hang herself, that, <HI>as she said,</HI> she had been
the Occasion of it all; and that if I was ruin'd,
(<HI>which was the word I always us'd to her</HI>) she had
ruin'd me; and she tormented herself about it so
much, that I was sometimes fain to comfort her
and myself too.</P>
<P>What <HI>Amy</HI> vex'd herself at, was chiefly, that
she shou'd be surpriz'd so by the Girl, <HI>as she call'd
her,</HI> I mean surpriz'd into a Discovery of herself to
<HI>the Girl;</HI> which indeed, was a false Step of <HI>Amy</HI>'s,
and so I had often told her; but 'twas to no Pur∣pose
to talk of that now the Business was, how
to get clear of the Girl's Suspicions, and of the
Girl too, for it look'd more threatning every Day,
than other and if I was uneasie at what <HI>Amy</HI>
had told me of her rambling and rattling to her,
(<HI>Amy</HI>) I had a thousand times as much reason to
be uneasie <HI>now,</HI> when she had chopp'd upon me
so unhappily as this; and not only had seen my
Face, but knew too where I liv'd; what Name I
went by, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>And I am not come to the worst of it yet nei∣ther,
for a few Days after my Friend the <HI>QUA∣KER</HI>
had made her Visit, and excus'd me on the
account of Indisposition; as if they had done it
in over and above Kindness, because they had been
told I was not well, they comes both directly to
my Lodgings, to visit me; the Captain's Wife,
and my Daughter, (<HI>who she call'd Sister</HI>) and the
<PB N="348" REF="353"/>
Captain to show them the Place; the Captain only
brought them to the Door, put them in, and went
away upon some Business.</P>
<P>Had not the kind QUAKER, in a lucky Mo∣ment,
come running in before them, they had
not only clapp'd in upon me, in the Parlour, <HI>as it
had been a Surprize;</HI> but which wou'd have been
a thousand times worse, had seen <HI>Amy</HI> with me;
I think if that had happen'd I had had no Re∣medy,
but to take the Girl by herself, and have
made myself known to her, which wou'd have
been all Distraction.</P>
<P>But the QUAKER, a lucky Creature to me,
happen'd to see them come to the Door, before
they rung the Bell, and instead of going to let
them in, came running in, with some Confusion
in her Countenance, and told me who was a-co∣ming;
at which, <HI>Amy</HI> run first, and I after her,
and bid the QUAKER come up as soon as she
had let them in.</P>
<P>I was going to bid her deny me, but it came
into my Thoughts, that having been represented
so much out of Order, it wou'd have look'd very
odd; besides, I knew the honest QUAKER,
tho' she wou'd do any-thing else for me, wou'd
not LYE for me, and it wou'd have boon hard to
have desir'd it of her.</P>
<P>After she had let them in, and brought them
into the Parlour, she came up to <HI>Amy</HI> and <HI>I,</HI> who
were hardly out of the Flight, and yet were con∣gratulating
one another, that <HI>Amy</HI> was not surpriz'd
again.</P>
<P>They paid their Visit in Form, and I receiv'd
them as formally; but took Occcasion two
or three times to hint, that I was so ill that I
was afraid I shou'd not be able to go to <HI>Holland,
at least,</HI> not so soon as the Captain must go off; and
<PB N="349" REF="354"/>
made my Compliment, how sorry I was to be dis∣appointed
of the Advantage of their Company
and Assitance in the Voyage; and sometimes I
talk'd as if I thought I might stay till the Cap∣tain
return'd, and wou'd be ready to go again;
then the QUAKER put in, That then I might be
too far gone, <HI>meaning with-Child,</HI> that I shou'd not
venture at-all; and then (<HI>as if she shou'd be pleas'd
with it</HI>) <HI>added,</HI> She hop'd I wou'd stay and Lye-in
at her House; so as this carried its own Face with
it, <HI>'twas well enough.</HI></P>
<P>But it was now high-time to talk of this to my,
Husband, which however, was not the greatest Dif∣faculty
before me: For after this and other Chat
had taken up some time, the young Fool began
her Tattle again; and two or three times she
brought it in, That I was so like a Lady that she
had the Honour to know at the other end of the
Town, that she cou'd not put that Lady out of
her Mind, <HI>when I was by;</HI> and once or twice I fan∣cy'd
the Girl was ready to cry; by-and-by she
was at it again; and at last, I plainly saw Tears
in her Eyes:, upon which, <HI>I ask'd her if the Lady was
dead, because she seem'd to be in some Concern for her;</HI>
she made me much easier by her Answer, than
ever she did before: <HI>She said, She did not really
know, bur she believ'd she was dead.</HI></P>
<P>This, <HI>I say,</HI> a little reliev'd my Thoughts, but
I was soon down again; for after some time, the
Jade began to grow Talkative and as it was plain,
that she had told all that her Head cou'd retain of
<HI>Roxana,</HI> and the Days of Joy which I had spent
at that Part of the Town, another Accident had
like to have blown us all up again.</P>
<P>I was in a kind of <HI>Dishabille</HI> when they came,
having on a loose Robe, like a Morning-Gown,
but much after the <HI>Italian</HI> Way, and I had not
<PB N="350" REF="355"/>
alter'd it when I went up, only dress'd my Head
a little; and as I had been reresented as having
been lately very ill, so the Dress was becoming
enough for a Chamber.</P>
<P>This Morning-Vest, or Robe, <HI>call it as you please,</HI>
was more shap'd to the Body, than we wear them
since, showing the Body in its true Shape, and
perhaps, a little too plainly, if it had been to be
worn where any Men were to come; but among
ourselves it was well enough, especially for hot
Weather the Colour was green, figur'd; and the
Stuff a <HI>French</HI> Damask, very rich.</P>
<P>This Gown, or Vest, put the Girl's Tongue a-running
again, and her Sister, <HI>as she call'd her,</HI>
prompted it; for as they both admir'd my Vest,
and were taken up much about the Beauty of the
Dress; the charming Damask; the noble Trim∣ming,
<HI>and the like;</HI> my Girl puts in a Word to the
Sister, (<HI>Captain's Wife</HI>) This is just such a Thing
as I told you, <HI>say she,</HI> the Lady danc'd in: What,
<HI>says the Captain's Wife,</HI> the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> that you
told me of? O! that's a charming Story, <HI>says she;</HI>
tell it <HI>my Lady;</HI> I cou'd not avoid saying so too,
tho' from my Soul I wish'd her in Heaven for but
naming it; <HI>nay,</HI> I won't say but if she had been
carried t'other Way, it had been much at one to
me, if I cou'd but have been rid of her, and her
Story too; for when she came to describe the
<HI>Turkish</HI> Dress, it was impossible but the QUAKER,
who was a sharp penetrating Creature, shou'd re∣ceive
the Impression in a more dangerous Manner,
than the Girl; only that indeed, she was not so
dangerous a Person; for if she had known it all,
I cou'd more freely have trusted her, than I cou'd
the Girl, by a great-deal; <HI>nay,</HI> I shou'd have been
perfectly easie in her.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="356"/>
However, <HI>as I have said,</HI> her Talk made me
dreadfully uneasie, and the more when the Cap∣tain's
Wife mention'd but the Name of <HI>Roxana;</HI>
what my Face might do towards betraying me, I
know not, because I cou'd not see myself, but my
Heart beat as if it wou'd have jump'd out at my
Mouth; and my Passion was so great, that for
want of Vent, I thought I shou'd have burst: <HI>In
a word,</HI> I was it a kind of a silent Rage; for the
Force I was under of restraining my Passion, was
such, as I never felt the like of: I had no Vent;
no-body to open myself to, or to make a Com∣plaint
to for my Relief; I durst not leave the
Room by any means, for then she wou'd have told
all the Story in my Absence, and I shou'd have
been perpetually uneasie to know what she had
said, or had not said; so that, <HI>in a word,</HI> I was
oblig'd to sit and hear her tell all the Story of
<HI>Roxana, that is to say,</HI> of myself, and not know at
the same time, whether she was in earnest or in
jest; whether she knew me or no; or, <HI>in short,</HI>
whether I was to be expos'd, or not expos'd.</P>
<P>She began only in general, with telling where
she liv'd; what a Place she had of it; how gallant
a Company her Lady had always had in the House;
how they us'd to sit up all-Night in the House,
gaming and dancing; what a fine Lady her Mi∣stress
was; and what a vast deal of Money the
upper Servants got; as for her, <HI>she said,</HI> her whole
Business was in the next House, so that she got
but little; except one Night, that there was twenty
Guineas given to be divided among the Servants,
when, <HI>she said,</HI> she got two Guineas and a half for
her Share.</P>
<P>She went on, and told them how many Ser∣vants
there was, and how they were order'd; but,
<HI>she said,</HI> there was one Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> who was over
<PB N="352" REF="357"/>
them all; and that she being the Lady's Favourite,
got a great-deal; she did not know, <HI>she said,</HI> whe∣ther
<HI>Amy</HI> was her Christian Name, or her Sir-Name,
but she suppos'd it was her Sir-Name; that
they were told, she got threescore Pieces of Gold
at one time, being the same Night that the rest of
the Servants had the twenty Guineas divided a∣mong
them.</P>
<P>I put in at that Word, <HI>and said,</HI> 'twas a vast deal
to give away; why, <HI>says,</HI> 'twas a Portion for a
Servant: O Madam! <HI>say she</HI> was nothing to
what she got afterwards; we that were Servants,
hated her heartily for it, <HI>that is to say,</HI> we wish'd
it had been our Lott, in her stead: <HI>Then I said
again,</HI> Why, it was enough to get her a good
Husband, and settle her for the World, if she had
Sence to manage it: So it might, <HI>to be sure,</HI> Madam,
<HI>says she;</HI> for we were told, she laid up above 500 <HI>l.</HI>
But, <HI>I sppose,</HI> Mrs. Amy was too sensible that her
Character wou'd require a good Portion to put her
Off.</P>
<P>O, <HI>said I,</HI> if that was the Case, 'twas another
thing.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says she,</HI> I don't know, but they talk'd
very much of a young Lord that was very great
with her.</P>
<P>And pray what came of her at last? <HI>said I;</HI> for
I was willing to hear a little (<HI>seeing she wou'd talk of
it</HI>) what she had to say, as well of <HI>Amy,</HI> as of myself.</P>
<P>I don't know, Madam, <HI>said she,</HI> I never heard
of her for several Years, till t'other Day I hap∣pen'd
to see her.</P>
<P>Did you indeed! <HI>says</HI> I; (<HI>and made mighty
strange of it</HI>) what, and in Rags, it may be, <HI>said I,</HI>
that's often the End of such Creatures.</P>
<P>Just the contrary, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> She came
to visit an Acquaintance Of mine, little thinking,
<PB N="353" REF="358"/>
<HI>I suppose,</HI> to see me, and, <HI>I assure you,</HI> she came in
her Coach.</P>
<P>In her Coach! <HI>said I;</HI> upon my word she had
made her Market then; I suppose <HI>she made Hay
while the Sun shone;</HI> was she marry'd, pray?</P>
<P>I believe she had been marry'd, Madam, <HI>say she,</HI>
but it seems she had been at the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and if
she was marry'd, it was there, <HI>to be sure;</HI> I think
she said she had good luck in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>That is, I suppose, <HI>said I,</HI> had buried her Hus∣band
there.</P>
<P>I understand it so, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> and
she had got his Estate.</P>
<P>Was that her good Luck? <HI>said I;</HI> it might be
good to her, as to the Money indeed, but it was
but the Part of a Jade, to call it good Luck.</P>
<P>Thus far our Discourse of Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> went, and
no farther, for she knew no more of her; but then
the QUAKER unhappily, tho' undesignedly, put
in a Question, which the honest good-humour'd
Creature wou'd have been far from doing, if she
had known that I had carry'd on the Discourse of
<HI>Amy,</HI> on purpose to drop <HI>Roxana</HI> out of the Con∣versation.</P>
<P>But I was not to be made easie too soon: The
QUAKER put in, But I think <HI>thou</HI> said'st, some∣thing
was behind of <HI>thy</HI> Mistress; what did'st
<HI>thou</HI> call her, <HI>Roxana,</HI> was it not? Pray what be∣came
of her?</P>
<P>AY, ay, <HI>Roxana, says the Captain's Wife;</HI> pray
Sister let's hear the Story of <HI>Roxana;</HI> it will di∣vert
my Lady, I'm sure.</P>
<P>That's a damn'd Lye, <HI>said I to myself;</HI> if you
knew how little 'twou'd divert me, you wou'd
have too much Advantage over me: Well, I saw no
Remedy, but the Story must come on, so I pre∣par'd
to hear the worst of it.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="359"/>
<HI>Roxana! says she;</HI> I know not what to say of
her; she was so much above us, and so seldom
seen, that we cou'd know little of her, but by Re∣port,
but we did sometimes see her too; she was
a charming Woman indeed; and the Footmen us'd
to say, that she was to be sent for to Court.</P>
<P>To Court, <HI>said I,</HI> why she was at Court, wa'n't
she? the Pallmall is not far from <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, Madam, <HI>says I,</HI> but I mean another way.</P>
<P>I understand thee, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER; <HI>Thou</HI>
mean'st, <HI>I suppose,</HI> to be Mistress to the KING;
yes, Madam, <HI>says she.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot help confessing what a Reserve of Pride
still was left in me; and tho' I dreaded the Sequel
of the Story, yet when she talk'd how handsome
and how fine a Lady this <HI>Roxana</HI> was, I cou'd not
help being pleas'd and tickl'd with it; and put in
Questions two or three times, of how handsome
she was? and was she really o fine a Woman as
they talk'd of? <HI>and the like,</HI> on purpose to hear
her repeat what the People's Opinion of me was,
and how I had behav'd.</P>
<P>Indeed, <HI>says she at last,</HI> she was a most beautiful
Creature, us ever I saw in my Life: But then,
<HI>said,</HI> you never had the Opportunity to see her,
bur when she was <HI>let-out</HI> to the best Advantage.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> I have seen her se∣veral
times in her <HI>Dishabille,</HI> and I can assure you,
she was a very fine Woman; and that which was
more still, every-body said she did not paint.</P>
<P>This was still agreeable to me one way; but
there was a devilish Sting in the Tail of it all, and
this last Article was one wherein she <HI>said, she</HI> had
seen me several times in my <HI>Dishabille:</HI> This put
one in Mind, that then she must certainly know me,
and it wou'd come cut at last; which was Death
to me but to think of.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="360"/>
Well, but Sister, <HI>says the Captain's Wife,</HI> tell my
Lady about the Ball, that's the best of all the Sto∣ry;
and of <HI>Roxana's</HI> dancing in a fine Outlandish
Dress.</P>
<P>That's one of the brightest Parts of her Story
indeed, <HI>says the Girl;</HI> the Case was this: We had
Balls and Meetings in her Ladyship's Apartments,
every Week almost; bit one time <HI>my Lady</HI> invited
all the Nobles to come; such a time, and she wou'd
give them a Ball; and there was a vast Crowd in∣deed,
<HI>says she.</HI></P>
<P>I think you said, the KING was there, Sister,
didn't you?</P>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> that was the second time,
when <HI>they said</HI> the KING had heard how finely
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Lady danc'd, and that he was there to
see her; but the KING, if His Majesty was there,
came disguis'd.</P>
<P>That is what they call <HI>Incog. says my Friend the</HI>
QUARER; thou can'st not think the' KING
wou'd disguise himself; yes, <HI>says the Girl,</HI> it was
so, lie did not come in Publick, with his Guards,
but we all knew which was the KING, well e∣nough;
<HI>that is to say,</HI> which they said was the
KING.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says the Captain's Wife,</HI> about the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Dress; pray let us hear that: Why, <HI>says she,
my Lady</HI> at in ii fine little Drawing-Room, which
open'd into the Great Room, and where she re∣ceiv'd
die Compliments of the Company; and
when the Dancing began, a great Lord, <HI>says she, I
forget who they calld him,</HI> (but he was a very great
Lord or Duke, I don't know which) took her
out, and danc'd with her; but after a-while, my
Lady on a sudden shut the Drawing-Room, and
run up-stairs with her Woman, Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> and
tho' she did not stay long, (<HI>for I suppose she had
<PB N="356" REF="361"/>
contriv'd it all before-hand</HI>) she came down dress'd
in the strangest Figure that ever I saw in <HI>my Life;</HI>
but it was exceeding fine.</P>
<P>Here she went on to describe the Dress, as I
have done already; but did it so exactly, that I
was surpriz'd at the Manner of her telling it;
there was not a Circumstance of it left out.</P>
<P>I was now under a new Perplexity; for this
young Slut gave so compleat an Account of every∣thing
in the Dress, that my Friend the QUAKER
colour'd at it, and look'd two or three times, at me,
to see if I did not do so too; for (<HI>as she told me
afterwards</HI>) she immediately perceiv'd it was the
same Dress that she had seen me have on, as I have
said before: However, as she saw I took no Notice
of it, she kept her Thoughts private to herself;
and I did so too, as well us I cou'd.</P>
<P>I put in two or three times that she had a
good Memory, that cou'd be so particular in every
Part of such a thing.</P>
<P>O Madam! <HI>says she,</HI> we that were Servants, stood
by ourselves in a Corner, but so, as we cou'd see
more than some Strangers besides, say she, it was
all our Conversation for several Days in the Fa∣mily,
and what one did not observe, another did:
Why, says I to her, this was no Persian Dress;
only, I suppose, your Lady was some <HI>French</HI> Come∣dian,
that is to say, a Stage Amazon, that put on a
counterfeit Dress to please the Company, such as
they us'd in the Play of <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> at Paris, or
some such.</P>
<P>No indeed, Madam, <HI>says she, I assure you,</HI> my Lady
was no Actress; she was a fine modest Lady, fit to
be a Princess; every-body said, If she was a Mistress,
she was fit to be a Mistress to none but the KING;
and they talk'd her up for the KING, as if it
really been so: Besides, Madam, <HI>she says,</HI> my
<PB N="357" REF="362"/>
Lady danc'd a <HI>Turkish</HI> Dance, all the Lords and
Gentry said it was so; and one of them swore,
<HI>he had seen it danc'd in</HI> Turkey <HI>himself;</HI> so that
it cou'd not come from the Theatre at <HI>Paris;</HI>
and then the Name <HI>Roxana, says she,</HI> was a <HI>Turkish</HI>
Name.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>said I,</HI> but that was not your Lady's
Name, I suppose.</P>
<P>No, no, Madam, said she, I know that; I know
my Lady's Name and Family very well; <HI>Roxana</HI>
was not her Name, that's true indeed.</P>
<P>Here she run me a-ground again; for I durst not
ask her what was <HI>Roxan's</HI> a real Name, left she
had really dealt with the Devil, and had boldly
given my own Name in for Answer: So that I
was still more and more afraid that the Girl had
really gotten the Secret somewhere or other; tho'
I cou'd not imagine neither, how that cou'd be.</P>
<P><HI>In a word,</HI> I was sick of the Discourse, and en∣deavour'd
many ways to put an End to it, but it
was impossible; for the Captain's Wife, <HI>who call'd
her Sister,</HI> prompted her, and press'd her to tell it,
most ignorantly thinking, that it wou'd be a plea∣sant
Tale to all of us.</P>
<P>Two or three times the QUAKER put in, That
this Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> had a good Stock at Assurance;
and that 'twas likely, it she had been in <HI>Turkey,</HI>
she had liv'd with, or been kept by, some Great
<HI>Bassa</HI> there: But still she wou'd break-in upon all
such Discourse, and fly-out into the most extrava∣gant
Praises of her Mistress, the fam'd <HI>Roxana:</HI>
I run her down, as some scandalous Woman; that
it was not possible to be otherwise; but she wou'd
not hear of it; her Lady was a Person of such
and such Qualifications; that nothing but un An∣gel
was like her, <HI>to be sure;</HI> and yet, <HI>after all she</HI>
cou'd say, her own Account brought her down to
<PB N="358" REF="363"/>
this, That, <HI>in short,</HI> her Lady kept little less than
a Gaming-Ordinary; or, <HI>as it wou'd be called in
the Times sine that,</HI> an Assembly for Gallantry and
Play.</P>
<P>All this while I was very uneasie, <HI>as I said be∣fore,</HI>
and yet the whole Story went off again-with∣out
any Discovery, only that I seem'd a little con∣cern'd,
that she shou'd liken me to this gay Lady,
whose Character I pretended to run down very
much, even upon the foot of her own Relation.</P>
<P>But I was not at the End of my Mortifications
yet neither; for now my innocent QUAKER
threw out an unhappy Expression, which put me
upon the Tenters again; <HI>Says she to me,</HI> This Lady's
Habit, <HI>I fancy,</HI> is just such a-one as <HI>thine,</HI> by the De∣scription
of it; <HI>and then turning to the Captain's
Wife, says she, I fancy, my</HI> Friend has a finer
<HI>Turkish or Persian</HI> Dress, a great-deal: O! <HI>says the
Girl,</HI> 'tis impossible to be finer; my Lady's, <HI>says
she,</HI> was all cover'd with Gold, and Diamonds;
her Hair and Head-Dress, <HI>I forgot the Name they
gave it, said sghe,</HI> shone like the Stars, there was
so many Jewels in it.</P>
<P>I never wish'd my good Friend the QUAKER
out of my Company before <HI>now;</HI> but indeed,
I wou'd have given some Guineas to have been
rid of her <HI>just now;</HI> for beginning to be curi∣ous
in the comparing the two Dresses, she inno∣cently;
began a Description of <HI>mine;</HI> and nothing
terrify'd me so much, as the Apprehension lest
she shou'd importune me to show it, which I was
resolv'd I wou'd never agree to.</P>
<P>But before it came to this, she press'd <HI>my Girl</HI>
to describe the <HI>Tyhaia,</HI> or Head-dress; which she
did so cleverly, that the QUAKER cou'd not
help saying, <HI>Mine was just such a-one;</HI> and after
several other Similitudes, all very vexatious to
<PB N="359" REF="364"/>
me, out comes the kind Motion to me, <HI>to let
the Ladies see my Dress;</HI> and they join'd their ea∣ger
Desires of it? even to Importunity.</P>
<P>I desir'd to be excus'd; tho' I had little to say
at first, why I declin'd it; but at last, it came into
my Head to say, <HI>It was pack'd up with my other
Cloaths that I had least Occasion for, in order to be sent
on-board the Captain's Ship;</HI> but that if we liv'd to
come to Holland together, (which, <HI>by the way,</HI> I re∣solv'd
shou'd never happen) then, I told then, at
unpacking my Cloaths, they shou'd see me dress'd
in it; but they must not expect I shou'd dance in
it, like the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> in all her sine things.</P>
<P>This carry'd it off pretty well; and getting over
this, got over most of the rest, and I began to be
easie again; and, <HI>in a word,</HI> that I may dismiss the
Story too, as soon as may be, I got-rid at last, of
my Visitors, who I had wish'd gone two Hours
soner than they intended it.</P>
<P>As soon as they were gone, I run up to <HI>Amy,</HI>
and gave Vent to my Passions, by telling her the
whole Story, and letting her see what Mischiefs
one false Step of hers had like, unluckily, to have
involv'd us all in, more perhaps, than we cou'd
ever have liv'd to get through: <HI>Amy</HI> was sensible
of it enough, and was just giving her Wrath a
Vent another way, <HI>viz.</HI> by calling the poor Girl
all the damn'd Jades and Fools, <HI>said sometimes worse
Names</HI>) that she cou'd think of; in the middle of
which, up comes my honest good QUAKER, and
put an end to our Discourse: The QUAKE<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame
in siniling, (for she was always so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>)
<HI>Well, says she, Thou act deli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d at last; I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
To joy thee of it; I perceiv'd thou <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> says I, <HI>so I was;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fool<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> young

<PB N="360" REF="365"/>
she wou'd never have done with it: Why truly,
I thought she was very careful to let <HI>thee</HI> know
she was but a Cookmaid: Ay, <HI>says I,</HI> and at a
Gaming-House, or Gaming-Ordinary, and at t'o∣ther-end
of the Town too; all which (<HI>by the way</HI>)
she might know, wou'd add very little to her
Good-Name among us Citizens.</P>
<P>I can't think, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, but she had
some other Drift in that long Discourse; there's
something else in her Head, <HI>says she,</HI> I am satisfy'd
of that: <HI>Thought I,</HI> are you satisfy'd of it? I am
sure I am the less satisfy'd for that; <HI>at least,</HI> 'tis
but small Satisfaction to me, to hear you say so:
What can this be? <HI>says I;</HI> and when will my
Uneasinesses have an end? <HI>But this was silent, and to
myself, you may be sure:</HI> But in Answer to my Friend
the QUAKER, I return'd, by asking her a Que∣stion
or two about it: As what she thought was
in it? and why she thought there was any-thing in
it? For, <HI>says I,</HI> she can have nothing in it relating
to me.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says the kind</HI> QUAKER, if she had any
View towards <HI>thee,</HI> that's no Business of mine; and
I shou'd be far from desiring <HI>thee</HI> to inform me.</P>
<P>This allarm'd me again; not that I fear'd trust∣ing
the good-humour'd Creature with it, if there
bad been any-thing of just Suspicion in her;
hut this Affair was a Secret I car'd not to commu∣nicate
to any-body: However, <HI>I say,</HI> this allarm'd
me a little; for as I had conceal'd every-thing
from her, I was willing to do so still; but as she
cou'd not but gather up abundance of things from
the Girl's Discourse, which look'd towards me, so
she was too penetrating to be put-off with such
Answers, as might stop another's Mouth: Only
there was this double Felicity in it; <HI>first,</HI> That
she was not Inquisitive to know, or find any-thing
<PB N="361" REF="366"/>
out; and not dangerous, if she had known the
whole Story: But, <HI>as I say,</HI> she cou'd not but ga∣ther
up several Circumstances from the Girl's Dis∣course;
as particularly, the Name of <HI>Amy;</HI> and
the several Descriptions of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dress, which
my Friend the QUAKER, had seen, and taken so
much Notice of, <HI>as I have said above.</HI></P>
<P>As for that, I might have turn'd it off by jest∣ing
with <HI>Amy,</HI> and asking her, who she liv'd with
before she came to live with me? but that wou'd
not do; for we had unhappily anticipated that
way of talking, by having often talk'd how long
<HI>Amy</HI> had liv'd with me; and which was still worse,
by having own'd formerly, that I had had Lodg∣ings
in the <HI>Pallmall;</HI> so that all those things cor∣responded
too well: There was only one thing that
help'd me out with the QUAKER, and that was,
the Girl's having reported how rich Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> was
grown, and that she kept Her Coach; now as
there might be many more Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI>'s besides
<HI>mine,</HI> so it was not likely to be my <HI>Amy,</HI> because
she was far from such a Figure as keeping her
Coach; and this carry'd it off from the Suspic∣ons
which the good Friendly QUAKER might
have in her Head.</P>
<P>But as to what she imagined <HI>the Girl</HI> had in her
Head, there lay more real Difficulty in that Part,
a great-deal; and I was allarm'd at it very much;
for my Friend the QUAKER, <HI>told me,</HI> She ob∣serv'd
that the <HI>Girl</HI> was in a great Passion when
talk'd of the Habit, and more when I had
been importun'd to show her mine, but declin'd
it: <HI>She said,</HI> She several times perceiv'd her to be
in Disorder, and to restrain herself with great Dif∣faculty;
and once or twice she mutter'd to herself,
that <HI>she had found it out,</HI> that <HI>she wou'd find it
out,</HI> she cou'd not tell whether; and that shc often
<PB N="362" REF="367"/>
saw Tears in her Eyes; that when I said my
Suit of <HI>Turkish</HI> Cloaths was put up, but that she
shou'd see it when we arriv'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> she
heard her say softly, <HI>she wou'd go over on purpose
then.</HI></P>
<P>After she had ended her Observations, <HI>I added,</HI>
I observ'd too, that <HI>the Girl</HI> talk'd and looked odd∣ly,
and that she was mighty Inquisitive, but I
cou'd not imagine what it was she aim'd at: Aim'd
at, <HI>says</HI> the QUAKER, 'tis plain to me what she
aims at; she believes thou art the lame Lady <HI>Rox∣ana</HI>
that danc'd in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Vest, but she is not
certain: Does she believe so! says I; If I had
thought that, I wou'd have put her out of her
Pain: Believe so I <HI>says</HI> the QUAKER, Yes; and
I began to believe so too, and shou'd have be∣liev'd
so still, if <HI>thou</HI> had, st not satisfy'd me to
the contrary, by thy taking no Notice of It, and
by what <HI>thou</HI> hast said since: Shou'd you have
believ'd so? said I, <HI>warmly,</HI> I am very sorry for
that; Why, wou'd you nave taken me for an
<HI>Actress,</HI> or a French <HI>Stage-Player?</HI> No, <HI>says the good
kind Creature, thou</HI> carry st it too sar; as soon as
<HI>thou</HI> mad'st t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Reflections upon her, I knew it
cou'd not be; but who cou'd think any other,
when she describ'd the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dress which <HI>thou</HI>
hast here, with the Head-Tire and Jewels; and
when she nam'd <HI>thy</HI> Maid <HI>Amy</HI> too, and several
other Circumstamces concurring? I shou'd certainly
have believ'd it, <HI>said she,</HI> if <HI>thou</HI> had'st not con∣tracidted
it; but as soon as I heard <HI>thee</HI> speak, I
concluded it was otherwise: That was very kind,
said I, and I am oblig'd to you for doing me so
much Justice; 'tis more it seems, than young
talking Creature that does: Nay, says the QUAKER,
in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she does not do thee Justice; for she as
certainly believes it still, as ever she did: Does
<PB N="363" REF="368"/>
she, <HI>said I?</HI> Ay, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, and I war∣rant
thee she'll make thee another Visit about it:
Will she, says I? then I believe I shall downright
affront her: No, <HI>thou</HI> shalt not affront her, <HI>says she,</HI>
(full of her good-humour and Temper) I'll take
that Part off thy hands, for I'll affront her for
<HI>thee,</HI> and not let her see <HI>thee;</HI> I thought that was
a very kind Offer, but was at a Loss how she
wou'd be able to do it; and the Thought of
seeing her there again, half distracted me; not
knowing what Temper she wou'd come in, much
less what Manner to receive her in; but my fast
Friend, and constant Comforter, the QUAKER,
said she perceiv'd the Girl was impertinent, and
that I had no Inclination to converse with her;
and she was resolv'd I shou'd not be troubled with
her: But I shall have Occasion to say more of this
presently for this Girl went farther yet, than I
thought she had.</P>
<P>It was now time, <HI>as I said before,</HI> to take Mea∣suies
with my Husband, in order to put-off
my Voyage; so I fell into Talk with, him one
Morning as he was dressing, and while I was in-Bed;
I pretended I was very ill; and as I had but
too easie a Way to impose upon him, because he
so absolutely believ'd every-thing I said; so I ma∣nag'd
my Discourse so, as that he should under∣stand
by it, I was a-breeding, tho' I did not tell
him so.</P>
<P>However, I brought it about so handsomely,
that before he went out of the Room, he came and
sat down by my Bed-side, and began to calk very
seriously to me, upon the Subject of my being
so every-Day ill; and that, as he hop'd I was
with-Child, he wou'd have me consider well of it,
whether I had not best alter my Thoughts the
Voyage to <HI>Holland;</HI> for that being Sea-sick, and
<PB N="364" REF="369"/>
which was worse, if a Storm shou'd happen, might
be very dangerous to me; and after saying abun∣dance
of the kindest things that the kindest of
Husbands in the World cou'd say, he concluded,
That it was his Request to me, that I wou'd not
think any-more of going, till after all shou'd be
over; but that I wou'd, <HI>on the contrary,</HI> prepare to
Lye-in where I was, and where I knew as well as
he, I cou'd be very well provided, and very well
assisted.</P>
<P>This was just what I wanted; for I had, <HI>as you
have heard,</HI> a thousand good Reasons why I shou'd
put off the Voyage, <HI>especially,</HI> with that Creature in
Company, but I had a-mind the putting it off shou'd
be at his Motion, not my own; and he came into
it of himself, just as I wou'd have had it: This
gave me an Opportunity to hang-back a little, and
to seem as if I was unwilling: <HI>I told him,</HI> I cou'd
not abide to put him to Difficulties and Perplexi∣ties
in his Business; that now he had hir'd the
Great-Cabbin in the Ship, <HI>and perhaps,</HI> paid some
of the Money, and, <HI>it may be,</HI> taken Freight for
Goods; and to make him break it all off again,
wou'd be a needless Charge to him, <HI>or perhaps?</HI> a
Damage to the Captain.</P>
<P>As to that, <HI>he said,</HI> it was not to be nam'd, and
he wou'd not allow it to be any Consideration at-all;
that he cou'd easily pacific the Captain of
the Shim by telling him the Reason of it; and
that if he did make him some Satisfaction for the
Disppointment, it shou'd not be much.</P>
<P>But my Dear, <HI>says I,</HI> you ha'n't heard me say
I am with-Child, neither can I say so; and if it
shou'd not be so at last, then I shall have made a
fine Piece of Work of it indeed; besides, <HI>says I,</HI>
the two Ladies, the Captain's Wife, and Her Si∣ster,
they depend upon our going over, and have
<PB N="365" REF="370"/>
made great Preparations, and all in Compliment
to me; what must I say to them?</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, says he, if you shou'd not be
with-Child, tho' I hope you are, yet there is no
harm done; the staying three or four Months
longer in <HI>England</HI> will be no Damage to me,
and we can go when we please, when we are sure
yon are riot with-Child, or when it appearing
that you are with-Child, you shall be down and
up again; and as for the Captain's Wife and Si∣ster,
leave that Part to me, I'll answer for it, there
shall be no Quarrel rais'd upon that Subject; I'll
make your Excuse to them by the Captain him∣self;
so all will be well enough there, I'll war∣rant
you.</P>
<P>This was as much as I cou'd desire; and thus
it rested for a-while: I had indeed, some anxious
Thoughts about this impertinent Girl, but believ'd
that putting off the Voyage wou'd have put an End
to it all; so I began to be pretty easie; but I found
myself mistaken, for I was brought to the Point of
Destruction by her again, and that in the most un∣accountable
Manner imaginable.</P>
<P>My Husband, as he and I had agreed, meeting
the Captain of the Ship, took the Freedom to tell
him, That he was afraid he must disappoint him,
for that something had fallen out, which had o∣blig'd
him to alter his Measures, and that his Fa∣mily
cou'd not be ready to go, time enough for
him.</P>
<P>I know the Occasion, Sir, <HI>says the Captain;</HI> I
hear your Lady has got a Daughter more than she
expected; I give you Joy of it: What do you
mean by that? <HI>says my Spouse:</HI> Nay, nothing, <HI>says
the Captain,</HI> but what I hear the Women tattle over
the Tea-Table; I know nothing, but that you
don't go the Voyage upon it, which I am sorry
<PB N="366" REF="371"/>
for; but you know your own Affairs, <HI>added the
Captain,</HI> that's no Business of mine.</P>
<P>Well but, <HI>says my Husband,</HI> I must make you
some Satisfaction for the Disappointment, and so
pulls out his Money: No, no, <HI>says the Captain,</HI> and
so they fell to straining their Compliments one up∣on
another; but, <HI>in short,</HI> my Spouse gave him
three or four Guineas, and made him take it; and
so the first Discourse went off again, and they
had no more of it.</P>
<P>But it did not go off so easily with me; for
now, <HI>in a word,</HI> the Clouds begen to thicken about
me, and I had Allarms on every side: My Hus∣band
told me what the Captain had said; but
very happily took it, that the Captain had brought
a Tale by-halves, and having heard it one way,
had told it another; and that neither cou'd he
understand the Captain, ueither did the Captain
nnderstand himself; so he contented himself to
tell me, <HI>he said,</HI> word for word, as the Captain de∣liver'd
it.</P>
<P>How I kept my Husband from discovering my discovering, my
Disorder, <HI>you shall hear presently;</HI> but let it suffice
to say just now, that if my Husband did not under∣stand
the Captain, nor the Captain understand
himself, yet I understood them both very well;
and to tell the Truth, it was a worse Shock than
ever I had had yet: Invention supply'd me in∣deed,
with a sudden Motion to avoid showing
my Surprize; for as my Spoute and I was sitting
by a little Table, near the Fire, I reach d out mg
Hand, as if I had intended to take a Spoon which
lay on the other side, and threw one of the Can∣dles
off of the Table; and then snatching it up,
started up upon my Feet, and stoop'd to the Lap
of my Gown, and took it in my Hand; O! <HI>says I,</HI>
my Gown's spoil'd; the Candle has greas'd it
<PB N="367" REF="372"/>
prodigiously: This furnish'd me with an Excuse
to my Spouse, to break off the Discourse for the
present, an call <HI>Amy</HI> down; and Amy not coming
presently, I said to him, My Dear, I must run up∣stairs,
and put it off, and let <HI>Amy</HI> clean it a-little;
so my Husband rise up too, and went into a Clo∣set,
where he kept his Papers and Books, and
fetch'd a Book out, and sat down by himself, to
read.</P>
<P>Glad I was that I had got away; and up I run
to <HI>Amy,</HI> who, as it happen'd, was alone; <HI>O Amy!
says I,</HI> we are all utterly undone; and with that,
I burst out a-crying, and cou'd not speak a Word
for a great-while.</P>
<P>I cannot help saying, that some very good Re∣flections
offer'd themselves upon this Head; it
presently occurr'd, What a glorious Testimony it is
to the Justice of Providence, und to the Concern
Providence has in guiding all the Affairs of Men,
(<HI>even the least, as well as the greatest</HI>) that the most
secret Crimes are, by the most unforeseen Acci∣dents,
brought to light, and discover'd.</P>
<P>Another Reflection was, How just it is, that Sin
and Shame follow one-another so constantly at the
Heels, that they are not like Attendants only, but
like Cause and Consequence, necessaly connected
one with another; that the Crime going before,
the Scandal is certain to follow; and that 'tis not
in the Power of humane Nature to conceal the
first, or avoid the last.</P>
<P>What shall I do? <HI>Amy,</HI> said I, <HI>as soon as I cou'd
speak;</HI> and what will become of me? and then I
cry'd again so vehemently, that I cou'd say no
more a great-while; <HI>Amy</HI> was frighted almost out
of her Wits, but knew nothing what the Matter
was; but she begg'd to know, and perswaded me
to compose myself and not cry so: Why Madam,
<PB N="368" REF="373"/>
If my Master shou'd come up now, says she, he will
see what a Disorder you are in; he will know you
have been crying, and then he will want to know
the Cause of it; with that I broke-out again, O!
he knows it already, <HI>Amy,</HI> says I; he knows all;
'tis all discover'd! and we are undone! <HI>Amy</HI> was
Thunder-struck now indeed: Nay, <HI>says Amy,</HI> if
that be true, we are undone indeed; but that can
never be; that's impossible, I'm sure.</P>
<P>No, <HI>no, says I,</HI> 'tis far from impossible, for I tell
you 'tis so; and by this time being a little reco∣ver'd,
I told her what Discourse my Husband and
the Captain had had together, and what the Cap∣tain
had said: This put <HI>Amy</HI> into such a Hurry,
that she cry'd; she rav'd; she swore and curs'd
like a Mad-thing; then she upbraided me, that I
wou'd not let her kill the Girl when she wou'd
have done it; and that it was all my own doing,
<HI>and the like:</HI> Well however, I was not for killing
the Girl yet, I cou'd not bear the Thoughts of that
neither.</P>
<P>We spent half an Hour in these Extravagances,
and brought nothing out of them neither; for
indeed, we cou'd do nothing, or lay nothing, that
was to the Purpose; for if any-thing was to come
out-of-the-way, there was no hindring it, nor help
for it; so after thus giving a Vent to myself by
crying, I began to reflect how I had left my Spouse
below, and what I had pretended to come up for;
so I chang'd my Gown that I pretended the Can∣dle
fell upon, and put on another, and went down.</P>
<P>When I had been down a good-while, and found
my Spouse did not fall into the Story again, as I
expected, I took-heart, and call'd for it: My
Dear, <HI>said I,</HI> the Fall of the Candle put you out
of your History; won't you go on with it? What,
History? <HI>says he:</HI> Why, <HI>says I,</HI> about the Cap∣tain;
<PB N="369" REF="374"/>
O! <HI>says he,</HI> I had done with it; I know
no more, than that the Captain told a broken
Piece of News that he had heard by halves, and
told more by halves than he heard it; <HI>namely,</HI> of
your being with-Child, and that you cou'd not go
the Voyage.</P>
<P>I perceiv'd my Husband enter'd not into the
thing at-all, but took it for-a Story, which being
told two or three times over, was puzzl'd, and
come to nothing; and that all that was meant by
it was, what he knew, or thought he knew al∣ready,
<HI>viz.</HI> that I was with-Child, which he wish'd
might be true.</P>
<P>His Ignorance was a Cordial to my Soul; and I
curs'd them in my Thoughts, that shou'd ever un∣deceive
him; and as I saw him willing to have the
Story end there, as not worth being farther men∣tion'd,
I clos'd it too; and said, I suppos'd the Cap∣tain
had it from his Wife; she might have found
somebody else to make her Remarks upon, and
so it pass'd off with my Husband well enough,
and I was still safe there, where I thought myself
in most Danger; but I had two Uneasinesses still;
<HI>the first was,</HI> lest the Captain and my Spouse
shou'd meet again, and enter into farther Dis∣course
about it; and <HI>the second</HI> was, lest die busie
impertinent Girl shou'd come again, and when she
came, how to prevent her seeing <HI>Amy,</HI> which was
an Article as material as any of the rest; for seeing
<HI>Amy,</HI> wou'd have been as fatal to me, as her know∣ing
all the rest.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>first</HI> of these, I knew the Captain
cou'd not stay in Town above a Week; but that
his Ship being already full of Goods, and fallen
down the River, he must soon follow; so I
contriv'd to carry my Husband somewhere out of
Town for a few Days, that they might be sure not
to meet.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="375"/>
My greatest Concern was, where we shou'd go;
at last I fix'd upon <HI>North-Hall,</HI> not, <HI>I said,</HI> that
I wou'd drink the Waters, but that, I thought
the Air was good, and might be for my Advan∣tage
He who did evrery-thing upon the Foun∣dation
of obliging me, readily came into it and every-thing upon the Foun∣dation
the Coach was apointed to be ready the next
Morning; but as we were Matters, he put
in an ugly Word that thwarted all my Desing; and
That was That he had rather I wou'd stay till Afternon,
for that he.shou'd spead to the Captain
next Morning, it he cou'd, to give him some Let∣eers;
which he cou'd do, and be back-again about
Twelve a-Clock.</P>
<P><HI>I said; Ay, by all means;</HI> but it was but a Cheat
on him, and my Voice and my Heart Deffer'd; for
I resolv'd if Pessible, he shoud not came near the
Captain, nor lee him, whatever came of it
in the Evening therfore, a lettle before we
went to -Bed, I pretended to have alter'd my Mind,
and that I would not go to <HI>North-Hall,</HI> but I had
a-mind to another-way <HI>but I told him,</HI> I was
afraid his Business wou'd not permit him; he
wanted to now where it was? <HI>I told him, smiling,</HI>
I wou'd not tell him, lit it shou'd oblige him
to hinder his Businers: <HI>He answer'd,</HI> with the
same Temper, <HI>but with insinitcly more Sincerity,</HI> That
he had no Business of the much Confeqrence, as
to hinder him going with me any-where that I had
a-mind to go: <HI>Yes,</HI> says I, <HI>you mant to speak with)
the Captain before he goes away:</HI> Why that's true,
say be, so I do, and paus'd a will; and them added,
But Ill write a Note to Man that does Business
for me, to go him; 'tis only to get some Billsmind
of I oading signd and he can do it: When I sas
I had gain'd my Point, Iseem'd to hang back a
little; my Dear, says I don't hinder an Hour's Business</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="376"/>
Business for me I can put it off for a weed or
two, rather than you shall do yourself any Prejudice
No, no, says he, you shall not put it off
an Hour for me, for I can do my Business
Proxy with any-body, But my Wife; and then
he took me in his Arms and Kiss'd me: How did my
Blood flush up into my Face! when I reflected how
sincerely, how affectionately this good-homour'd
Gentlemen embrac'd the most cursed Piece of Hy∣pocritic
that ever came into the Arms of an honesray'
men? His was all Tenderness, all Kindness, and
the utmost Sincerity; Mine all Grimace and De∣ceit;
a piece of meer Manage, and fram'd con∣duct,
to conceal a pass'd Life of Wickedness, and
prevent his discovering, that he had in his Arms a
She-Devil, whise whole conves had been cation for twenty
five Years had been black a Hell, a complication
of crime; and for which, had he been let into
It, he must have abhor'd me, and the very mention
of my Name: But there was no help for me in it;
all I had to satissie my self was, that it was my
Businest to be what I was, and conceal what I had
been; that all the Satisfaction I could make him,
was to live virtuously for the Time to come, not
being able to retrieve what hadbeen in Time past
and this I resolv'd upon tho' had the great temp∣tation
tation offer'd, as it did afterwards, I had reason
to question my Slability <HI>But of that breafter.</HI></P>
<P>After my Husband had kindly thus given up his
Measures to mine, we resolv'd to set out in the
Morning early <HI>I told him,</HI> that my project, if he
lik'd it, was, to go to Tunbridcrge and he, being
entirely passive in the thing, agreed to it with the
greateft willingnets, but said, If I had not nam'd
Tunbridge; he wo'd have nam'd Newmerket (<HI>there
being a great Court there, and abundance of fine things
to he seen</HI>) I offer'd him another piece of Hypocrisi herc,s
<PB N="172" REF="377"/>
here, son I pretended to be willing to go thither,
<HI>as the place of his Choice,</HI> but indeed I wou'd not
have gone for a Thousand Pounds; for the Court
being there at that time, I durit not run the Ha∣zard
of being known at a place where there wereie
so many Eyes that had seen before So that,
<HI>after same time,</HI> I told my Husband that I thought
Newnarket was so of People at that time, that
we shou'd get no Accommodation; that feeing the
Court, and the Crowd, was no Entertainment
at all to me, unliess as it might be so to him that
if he thought fit, we won'd rather put it off to ano∣ther
time off to another time and that if when he went-to Holland,
we sou'd go by Harwich we might take a round
By Newmarket and Bury, and so come down to
<HI>Ipswich,</HI> and go from thence to the Sea-side: He
was easly put off from this, as he was from any∣thing
else, that I did not approve; and so with
all imaginable Facility he appointed to be ready
early in the Morning to go with me for Tun∣bridge.</P>
<P>I had a double Design in this, <HI>viz</HI> first, to
get away my Spoust from seeing the Captain any∣more;
and secoudly, To be out of the way my self,
in case this impertinent Girl, who was now my Plague,
shou'd offer to come again, as my friend the Quaker
<HI>beliv'd the wou'd</HI> and as indeed, happen'd
within two or three Days asterwards.</P>
<P>Having thus secur'd my going away the next
Day I had nothing to do, but to furnish my faith∣ful
Agent, the Q U A K E R, with some Instructions
What to say to this <HI>Tormentor</HI> (for such the Prov'd)
afterwards) and how to manage her if the made
any more Visits than ordinary.</P>
<P>I had great-mind to leave <HI>Amy</HI> behind too as
an Assisant, because me understood so Perfectly
weel what to advise upon any Emeergence and Amy
<PB N="373" REF="378"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> importu'd me to do so, but I Know now
what secret Impulse Prevail'd over my Thoughts,
against it, could not do it, for sear the wicked
Jade shou'd made her away, which my very Soul
abhorr'd the Thoughts of; which however, <HI>Amy
found Means to bring to pass afterwards; as I
may in time relate more particularly.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, I wanted as much to be deliver'd
from her, as ever a Sick-Man did from a thir∣Day
Ague, and had The dropp'd into the Grave
by any fair Way, as I may call it I mean had she
died by any ordinary Difiemper, I shou'd have
shed but very sew Tears for her but I was not
arrived to such a Pitch of obstinate Wickednss, as to
to commit Murther, especially such, as to murther
my own Child, or much as to harbour a Thought
barbarous, in my But, as I said, <HI>Amy</HI>
effected all aftrwards, without my Knowledge,
for which I gave her my hearty Curie, tho'I cou'd
do litte more for to have fass'n upon <HI>Amy</HI> had
been to have murther'd My salf But this Tragedy
requires a longer Story than I have room for here
I return to my Journey.</P>
<P>My dear Friend, the QUAKER, was kind, and
yet honest wou'd do any-thing that was Just
and upright, to serve me, but nothing wicked, or
dishonourable; that them might be able to say bold∣lutely
to the Creature, if she came, lie did not know
where I was gone, the defir'd I wou'd not let her know
and to make her Ignorance the more abio∣lutcly
sase to herself, and likewise to me, I allow'd
her to Suy that heard us talk of going to Neumarket,
She like'd that Part, and I left all the
rest to her, to act as the thought fit Only charg'd
her, that if the that Girl enter'd into the Story of the
<HI>Pallmall,</HI> the should not centertain much Talk about
It, but let her understand, that we all thougher the spoke</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="379"/>
spoke of it a little too particularly and that the
Hady <HI>meaning me</HI> took it a little ill, to be so
liken'd to a publick Mistress, of a Stage∣player
<HI>and the like</HI> and to bring her, if possible, to lay
no more it However, tho' I did not tell my Friend the Q U A K H R,
How to write to <HI>Amy,</HI> or where I was, yet I left a seal paper with her
Mind to give her, in which I gave her a Direction
how to write to <HI>Amy</HI> and so in effect, to my∣self</P>
<P>It was but a few Days after I was gone, but the
impatient Girl came to my Lodgings, on' Pretence
like how I did, and to hear if I intended to go
the Voyage, <HI>and the like</HI> My trusty Agent was
at-home, and received her coldly at the Door
<HI>but told her</HI> That the lady, <HI>which she supos'd the
meant, was gone from her House</HI></P>

her to come in; for feeing her alone, the ex∣pected

that I did not care how colkly the re∣cive'd
her</P>
<P>But the was not to be put off so <HI>She said,</HI> If
the Lady—was not to be spode with, the

in which was what she wanted note She did
but into her into her best Parlour, as formerly,
but in to a little outer-Room, where the Servants
hfually waited</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="380"/>
By the first of her Discourse she did not stick
to insinuate, as if she believ'd I was in the House,
but was unwilling to be seen; and press'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnestly
that she might speak but two Words with me; to
which she added earnest Entreaties, and at last,
Tears.</P>
<P>I am sorry, <HI>says my good Creature the</HI> QUAKER,
<HI>thou</HI> hast so ill an Opinion of me, as to think I
wou'd tell thee an Untruth, <HI>and say,</HI> that the lady

<P><HI>She said little to that,</HI> but said, It wad Business of

<P><HI>Thou</HI> seem'st to be sorely afflicted, <HI>says</HI> the QUA∣KER,

if nothing will comsort <HI>thee</HI> but seeing the Lady

<P>I hope it is, says she again; to be sure it is of
great Consequence to me, so much, that I am un∣done
without it.</P>
<P><HI>Thou</HI> troubl'st me very much, to hear <HI>thee</HI> say so,

speak to her apart, when <HI>thou</HI> wast here before?</P>
<P>I had no Opportunity, <HI>says she,</HI> to speak to her
alone, and I cou'd not do it in Company; if I con'd

<P>I mean nothing but what I say, <HI>says she, I say

<P>No, <HI>says the Girl,</HI> I believe she does not know

<P>Truly, <HI>says she,</HI> the Lady—has several
Women-Servants, but I do not know all their
Names.</P>
<P>But her Woman, her Favourite, <HI>adds the Girl;</HI>
is not her Name <HI>Amy?</HI></P>
<P>Why truly, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, <HI>mith a very
happy Turn of Wit,</HI> I do not like to be examin'd;
but lest <HI>thou</HI> should'st take up any Mistakes, by
reason of may backwardness to speak, I will answer
<HI>thee</HI> sor once, That what her Woman's Name is,
I know not; but they call her <HI>Cherry.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>N. B. My Husband gave her that Name in jest,
on our Wedding-Day, and we had call'd her
by it ever aFter; so that she spoke literally true
at that time.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Girl reply'd very modestly,</HI> That she was sorry
if she gave her any Offence in asking; that she did
not design to be rude to her, or pretend to exa∣mine
her; but that she was in such an Agony at
this Disaster, that she knew not what she did or
said; and that she shou'd be very sorry to disoblige
her; but begg'd of her again, as she was a Chri∣stian,
and a Woman, and had been a Mother of
Children, that she wou'd take Pity on her, and,
<HI>if possible,</HI> assist her, so that she might but come to
me, and speak a few Words to me.</P>
<P>The tender-hearted QUAKER told me, the
Girl spoke this with such moving Eloquence, that
it forc'd Tears from her; but she was oblig'd to
say, That she neither knew where I was gone, or
how to write to me; but that if she did ever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee
me again, she wou'd not Fail to give me an Ac∣count
of all she had said to her, or that she shou'd
<PB N="378" REF="383"/>
yet think fit to say; and to take my Answer to
it, if I thought fit to give any.</P>
<P>Then the QUAKER took the Freedom to ask
a few Particulars about this wonderful Story,
<HI>as she call'd it;</HI> at which, the Girl beginning at
the first Distresses of my Life, <HI>and indeed, of her
own,</HI> went thro' all the History of her miserable
Education; her Service under the Lady <HI>Roxana,
as she call'd me,</HI> and her Relief by Mrs. <HI>Amy;</HI> with
the Reasons she had to believe, that as <HI>Amy</HI>
own'd herself to be the same that liv'd with her
Mother, <HI>and especially,</HI> that <HI>Amy</HI> was the Lady
<HI>Roxana's</HI> Maid too, and came out of <HI>France</HI> with
her, She was by those Circumstances, and several
others in her Conversation, as fully convinc'd,
that the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was her Mother, as she
was that the Lady—at her House [<HI>the
Quaker's</HI>] was the very same <HI>Roxana</HI> that she had
been Servant to.</P>
<P>My good Friend the QUAKER, tho' terribly
shock'd at the Story, and not well-knowing what
to say, yet was too much my Friend to seem con∣vinc'd
in a Thing, which she did not know to
be true, and which, if it was true, she cou'd see
plainly I had a-mind shou'd not be known; so she
turn'd her Discourse to argue the Girl out of it:
She insisted upon the slender Evidence she had
of the Fact it self, and the Rudeness of claiming
so near a Relation of one so much above her, and
of whose Concern in it she had no Knowledge, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
least,</HI> no sufficient Proof; that as the Lady at her
House was a Person above any Disguiss, so she
cou'd not believe that she wou'd deny her being
her Daughter, if she was really her Mother; that
the was able sufficiently to have provided for her,
if she had not a-mind to have her known; and
therefore, seeing she had heard all she had said of
<PB N="379" REF="384"/>
the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> and was so far from owning
herself to be the Person, so she had censur'd that
Sham-Lady as a Cheat, and a Common Woman;
and that 'twas certain she cou'd never be brought
to own a Name and Character she had so justly
expos'd.</P>
<P>Beside, <HI>she told her,</HI> that her Lodger, <HI>meaning me,</HI>
was not a Sham-Lady, but the real Wife of a
Knight Baronet; and that she knew her to be
honestly such, and far above such a Person as she
had describ'd; <HI>She then added,</HI> that she had ano∣ther
Reason why it was not very possible to be
true, <HI>and that is, says she, Thy</HI> Age is in the way, for
<HI>thou</HI> acknowledgest, that <HI>thou</HI> art four and twenty
Years old; and that <HI>thou</HI> wast the Youngest of three
of <HI>thy</HI> Mother's Children; so that, by <HI>thy</HI> Account,
<HI>thy</HI> Mother must be extremely young, or this La∣dy
cannot be <HI>thy</HI> Mother; for <HI>thou</HI> seest, <HI>says she,</HI>
and any one may see, she is but a young Woman
now, and cannot be suppos'd to be above Forty
Years old, if she is so much, and is now big with-Child
at her going into the Country; so that I
cannot give any Credit to <HI>thy</HI> Notion of her being
<HI>thy</HI> Mother; and if I might counsel thee, it shou'd
be to give-over that Thought, as an improbable
Story that does but serve to disorder <HI>thee,</HI> and di∣sturb
<HI>thy</HI> Head for, <HI>added she,</HI> I perceive <HI>thou</HI> art
much disturb'd indeed.</P>
<P>But this was all nothing: She cou'd be satis∣fy'd
with nothing but seeing me; but the QU A∣KER
defended herself very well, and insisted on
it, that she cou'd not: give her any Account of
me and finding her still importunate, she affected
at last, being a little disgusted that she shou'd not
believe her, <HI>and added,</HI> That indeed, if she had
known where I was gone, she wou'l not have gi∣ven
any-one an Account of it, unless I had given
<PB N="380" REF="385"/>
her Orders to do so; but seeing she has not ac∣quainted
me, <HI>says she,</HI> where she is gone, 'tis an
Intimation to me, she was not desirous it shou'd
be publickly known and with this she rise up,
which was as plain a desiring her to rise up too,
and be gone, as cou'd be express'd, except the
downright showing her the Door.</P>
<P>Well, the Girl rejected all this, <HI>and told her,</HI>
She cou'd not indeed expect that she (<HI>the</HI> QUA∣KER)
shou'd be affected with the Story she had
told her, however moving; or that she shou'd take
any Pity on her: That it was her Misfortune,
that when she was at the House before, and in the
Room with me, she did not beg to speak a Word
with me in private, or throw herself upon the
Floor, at my Feet, and claim what the Affection
of a Mother wou'd have done for her but since
she had slipped her Opportunity, she wou'd wait
for another; that she found by her (<HI>the Quaker's</HI>)
Talk, that she had not quite left her Lodgings,
but was gone into the Country, <HI>she suppos'd,</HI> for
the Air; and she was resolv'd she wou'd take so
much <HI>Knight-Errantry</HI> upon her, that she wou'd visit
all the Airing-Places in the Nation, and even all
the Kingdom over, ay, and <HI>Holland</HI> too, but she
wou'd find me; for she was satisfy'd she cou'd so
convince me that she was my own Child, that I
wou'd not deny it; and she was sure I was so ten∣der
and compassionate, I wou'd not let her perish
after I was convinced that, she was my own Flesh
and Blood and in saying she wou'd visit all the
Airing-Places in <HI>England,</HI> she reekon'd them all up
by Name, and began with <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> the very
Place I was gone to; then reckoning up <HI>Fpsom,
North-Hall, Barnet, Newmarket, Bury,</HI> and at last,
The Bath: And with this she took her Leave.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="386"/>
My, faithful Agent the QUAKER, sail'd not
to write to me immediately; but as she was a
cunning, as well as an honest Woman, it present∣ly
occurred to her, that this was a Story, which,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> True or False, was not very fit to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to my Husband's Knowledge that as she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not know what I might have been, or might
have been call'd in former Times, and how far
there might have been <HI>something</HI> or <HI>nothing</HI> in it,
so she thought if it was a Secret, I ought to have
the telling it my self; and if it was not, it might
as well, be public afterwards, as now; and that,
<HI>at least,</HI> she ought to leave it where she found it,
and not hand it forwards to any-body without my
Consent: These prudent Measures were inexpres∣sibly
kind, as well as seasonable; for it had been
likely enough that her Letter might have come
publickly to me, and tho' my Husband wou'd
not have open'd it, yet it wou'd have look'd a
little odd that I shou'd conceal its Contents from
him, when I had pretended so much to commu∣nicate
all my Affairs.</P>
<P>In Consequence of this wise Caution, my good
Friend only wrote me in few Words, That the
impertinent Young-Woman had been with her,
as she expected she wou'd and that she thought
it wou'd be very convenient that, if I cou'd spare
<HI>Cherry,</HI> I wou'd send her up, (meaning <HI>Amy</HI>) be∣cause
she found there might be some Occasion for
her.</P>
<P>As it happen'd, this Letter was enclosed to <HI>Amy</HI>
herself, and not sent by the Way I had at first or∣der'd;
but it came safe to my Hands; and tho'
I was allarm'd a little at it, yet I was not ac∣quainted
with the Danger I was in of an imme∣diate
Visit from this teizing Creature, till after∣wards;
and I run a greater Risque indeed, than
<PB N="382" REF="387"/>
ordinary, in that I did not send <HI>Amy</HI> up under
thirteen or fourteen Days, believing myself as
much conceal'd at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> as if I had been at
<HI>Viema.</HI></P>
<P>But the Concern my faithful SPY, (<HI>for such my</HI>
QUAKER <HI>was now, upon the meer foot of her own
Sagacity</HI>) I say, her Concern for me, was my Safety
in this Exigence,, when I was, <HI>as it were,</HI> keeping
no Guard for myself; for finding <HI>Amy</HI> not come
up, and that she did not know how soon this wild
Thing might put her design'd Ramble in Practice,
she sent a Messenger to the Captain's Wife's House,
where she lodg'd, to tell her that she wanted to
speak with her: She was at the Heels of the Mes∣senger,
and came eager for some News; and
hon'd, <HI>she said,</HI> the Lady, (<HI>meaning me</HI>) had been
come to Town.</P>
<P>The QUAKER, with as much Caution as she
was Mistress of, <HI>not to tell a downright Lye,</HI> made
her believe she expected to hear of me very quick∣ly,
and frequently <HI>by the by,</HI> speaking of being A∣broad
to take the Air, talk'd of the Country about
<HI>Bury,</HI> how pleasant it was how wholesome; and
how fine an Air: How the <HI>Downs</HI> about Newmar∣ket
were exceeding fine; and what a vast deal of
Company there was, now the <HI>Court</HI> was there; till
at last, the Girl began to conclude, that <HI>my Lady∣ship</HI>
was gone thither; for, <HI>she said,</HI> She knew I
lov'd to see a great-deal of Company.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says my Friend, thou</HI> tak'st me wrong, I
did not suggest, <HI>says she,</HI> that the Person <HI>thou</HI> en∣quir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st
after, is gone thither, neither do I believe
she is, I assure thee; Well, the Girl smil'd, and
let her know, that she believ'd it for-all that; so,
to clench it fast, Verily <HI>says she, with great Serious∣ness,
Thou</HI> do'st not do well, for <HI>thou</HI> suspectest
every-thing, and believest nothing: I speak so∣lemnly
<PB N="383" REF="388"/>
to <HI>thee,</HI> that I do not believe they are gone
that Way; so if <HI>thou giv'st thyself</HI> the Trouble
to go that Way, and art disappointed, do not
say that I have deceiv'd <HI>thee:</HI> She knew well e∣nough,
that if this did abate her; Suspicion, it
would not remove it; and that it wou'd do little
more than amuse her; but by this she kept her in
suspence till <HI>Amy</HI> came up, and that was enough.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> came up, she was quite confounded,
to hear the Relation which, the QUAKER gave
her, and found means to acquaint me of it; only
letting me know, to my great Satisfaction, that
she wou'd not come to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> first; but that
she wou'd certainly go to <HI>Newmarket</HI> or <HI>Bury</HI> first.</P>
<P>However, it gave me very great Uneasiness;
for as she resolv'd to ramble in search after me,
over the whole Country, I was safe no-where, no,
not in <HI>Holland</HI> itself; so indeed, I did not know
what to do with her: And thus I had a <HI>Bitter</HI> in
all my <HI>Sweet,</HI> for I was continually perplex'd with
this Hussy, and thought she haunted me like an
Evil Spirit.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Amy</HI> was next-door to stark∣mad
about her; she durst not see her at my Lodg∣ings,
for Life; and she went Days without
Number, to <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> where she us'd to come,
and to her sormer Lodging, and cou'd never
meet with her; at <HI>length,</HI> she took up a mad Reso∣lution,
that she wou'd go directly to the Captain's
House in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and speak with her; it was a
mad Step, <HI>that's true,</HI> but, <HI>as</HI> Amy <HI>said,</HI> she was
mad, so nothing she cou'd do, cou'd be other∣wise
For if <HI>Amy</HI> had found her at <HI>Redriff,</HI> she
(<HI>the Girl</HI>) wou'd have concluded presently, that the
QUAKER had given her Notice, and so that we
were all of a Knot, and that, <HI>in short,</HI> all she had
said was right: But as it happen'd, things came to
<PB N="384" REF="389"/>
hit better than we expected; for that <HI>Amy</HI> going
out of a Coach, to take Water at <HI>Tower-Wharf,</HI>
meets <HI>the Girl</HI> just come on-Shoar, having cross'd
the Water from Redriff: <HI>Amy</HI> made as if she
wou'd have pass'd by her, tho' they met so full
that she did not pretend she did not see her, for
she looked fairly upon her first; but then turning
her Head away, with, a Slight, offer'd to go from
her; but the Girl stopp'd, and spoke first, and
made some Manners to her.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> spoke coldly to her, and a little angry;
and after some Words, standing in the Street, or
Passage, <HI>the Girl saying,</HI> she seem'd to be angry,
and wou'd not Have spoken to her: <HI>Why,</HI> says
<HI>Amy, How tan you expect I shou'd have any-more
to say to you, after I had done so much for you, and
you have b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hav'd so to me?</HI> The Girl scem'd to take
no Notice of that now, but answer'd, <HI>I was going
to wait on you now:</HI> Wait on me! <HI>says Amy;</HI> what
do you mean by that? Why, <HI>says she again, with a
kind of Familiarity,</HI> I was going to your Lodgings.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was provok'd to the last Degree at her,
and yet she thought it was not her time to resent,
because she had tit more fatal and wicked Design
in her Head, against her; which indeed, I never
knew till after it was executed, nor durst <HI>Amy</HI> ever
communicate it to me; for as I had always ex∣press'd
myself vehemently against hurting a Hair
of her Head, so she was resolv'd to take her own
Measures, without consulting me any-more.</P>
<P>In order to this, <HI>Amy</HI> gave her good Words,
and conceal'd her Resentment as much as she cou'd;
and when she talk'd of going to her Lodging, <HI>Amy</HI>
smi'd, and sald, nothing, but call'd for a Pair of
Oars to go to Greenwich; and ask'd her, seeing <HI>she
said</HI> she was going to her Lodging, to go along
with her, for she was going Home, and was all∣alone.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="390"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> did this with such a Stock of Assurance,
that the Girl was confounded, and knew not what
to say; but the more she hesitated, the more <HI>Amy</HI>
pres'd her to go; and talking very kindly to her,
<HI>told her,</HI> If she did not go to see her Lodgings, she
might go to keep her Company, and she wou'd pay
a Boat to bring her back-again; so, <HI>in a word, Amy</HI>
prevailed on her to go into the Boat with her,
and carry'd her down to Greenwich.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, that <HI>Amy</HI> had no more Business at
<HI>Greenwich</HI> than I had nor was she going thither;
but we were all hamper'd to the last Degree, with
the Impertinence of this Creature and in particu∣lar,
I was horribly perplex'd with it.</P>
<P>As they were in the Boat, <HI>Amy</HI> began to re∣proach
Her with Ingratitude, in treating her so
rudely, who had done so much for her, and been
so kind to her; and to ask her what she had got
by it? or what she expected to get? T'hen came
in my Share, the Lady <HI>Roxana; Amy</HI> jested with
that, and banter'd her a little <HI>and ask'd her,</HI> if she
had found her yet?</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> was both surpriz'd and curag'd, when
the Girl told her roundly, That she thank'd her
for what she had done for her; but that she wou'd
not have her think she was so ignorant, as not to
know that what she [<HI>Amy</HI>] had done, was by her
Mother's Order; and who she was beholden to for
it: That she cou'd never make Instruments pass
for Principals, and pay the Debt to the Agent,
when the Obligation was all to the Original: That
she knew well enough who she was, and who she
was employ'd by: That she knew the Lady—
very well, (<HI>naming the Name that I now went by</HI>)
which, was my Husband's true Name, and by
which she might know whether she had found out
her Mother or no.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="391"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> wish her at the Bottom of the <HI>Thames;</HI>
and had there been no Watermen in the Boat, and
no-body in sight, <HI>she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to me,</HI> she wou'd have
thrown her into the River: I was horribly di∣sturb'd
when she told me this Story, and began to
think this wou'd, at last, all end in my Run; but
when <HI>Amy</HI> spoke of throwing her into the River,
and drowning her, I was so provok'd at her, that
all my Rage turn'd against Amy, and I fell tho∣rowly
out with her: I had now kept <HI>Amy</HI> almost
thirty Year, and found her on all Occasions, the
faithfulest Creacure to me, that ever Woman had;
I say, faithful to me; for however wicked she
was, still she was true to me; and even this Rage
of her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was all upon my Account, and for scar
any Misclnes shou'd besal me.</P>
<P>But be that how it wou'd, I cou'd not bear the
Mention of her Murthering the poor Girl, and
it put me so beside myself, that I rise up in a
Rage, and bade her get out of my Sight, and out
of my House; <HI>told her,</HI> I had kept her too long,
and that I wou'd never see her Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e more; I had
before told her, That she was a Murtherer,, and a
bloody-minded Creature; that she cou'd not but
knew that I cou'd not bear the Thought of it,
much less the Mention of it; and that it was
the impudence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> st Thing that ever was known, to
make such a Proposal to me, when she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that
I was really the Mother of this Girl, and that she
was my own Child; that it wicked enough
in her; but that she must conclude I was ten times
wic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eder than herself, if I cou'd come into it:
That the Girl was in the right and I had nothing
to blame her for; but that it was owing to the
Wickedness of my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife, that made it necessary
for me to keep her from a Discovery; but that I
wou'd not murther my Child, tho' I was otherwise
<PB N="387" REF="392"/>
to be ruin'd by it: <HI>Amy</HI> reply'd somewhat rough
and short, Would I not, but she wou'd, <HI>she said;</HI>
if she had an Opportunity: And upon these Words
it was that I bade Her get out of my Sight, and
out of my House; and it went so far, that <HI>Amy</HI>
pack'd up her Alls, and march'd off, and was gone
for almost good-and-all: <HI>But of that in its Order;
I must go back to her Relation of the Voyage which they
made to</HI> Greenwich <HI>together.</HI></P>
<P>They held on the Wrangle all-the-way by Wa∣ter;
the Girl insisted upon her knowing that I
was her Mother, and told her all the History of
my Life in the <HI>Pallmall,</HI> as well after her being
turn'd away, as before; and of my Marriage since;
and which was worse, not only who my present
Husband was, but where he had liv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Roan</HI>
in <HI>France;</HI> she knew nothing of <HI>Paris,</HI> or of where
we was going to live, <HI>Namely,</HI> at <HI>Nimuegen; but
told her in so many Words,</HI> That if she cou'd not
find me here, she would go to <HI>Holland</HI> after
me.</P>
<P>They landed at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and <HI>Amy</HI> carried her
into the Park with her, and they walk'd above
two Hours there, in the farthest and remotest
Walks; which <HI>Amy</HI> did, because as they talk'd,
with great heat, it was apparent they were quar∣relling,
and the People took Notice of it.</P>
<P>They walk'd till they came almost to the Wil∣derness,
at the <HI>South</HI> side of the Park; but <HI>the Girl</HI>
perceiving <HI>Amy</HI> offer'd to go in there, among the
Woods, and Trees stopp'd short there, and
wou'd go no farther; <HI>but said,</HI> She wou'd not go
in there.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> smil'd, and ask'd her what was the Mat∣ter?
<HI>She replied short,</HI> She did not know where she
was, nor where she was going to carry her, and she
wou'd go no farther; and without any-move Ce∣remony,
<PB N="388" REF="393"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emony, turns back, and walks apace away from
her: <HI>Amy</HI> own'd she was surpriz'd, and came back
too, and call'd to her; upon which the Girl stopt,
and <HI>Amy</HI> coming up to her, ask'd her, what she
meant?</P>
<P><HI>The Girl boldly replied,</HI> She did not know but she
might murther her; and that, <HI>in short,</HI> She wou'd
not trust herself with her; and never wou'd come
into her Company again, alone.</P>
<P>It was very provoking; but however, <HI>Amy</HI> kept
her Temper, with much Difficulty, and bore it,
knowing that much, might depend upon it; so she
mock'd her foolish Jealousie, <HI>and told her,</HI> She need
not be uneasie for her, she wou'd do her no Harm,
and wou'd have done her Good, if she wou'd
have let her; but since she was of such a refractory
Humour, she shou'd not trouble herself, for she
shou'd never come into her Company again; and
that neither she, or her Brother, or Sister, shou'd
ever hear from her, or see her any-more; and so
she shou'd have the Satisfaction of being the Ruin
of her Brother and Sister, as well as of herself.</P>
<P>The Girl seem'd a little mollifi'd at that, <HI>and
said,</HI> That for herself, she knew the worst of it,
she cou'd seek her Fortune; but 'twas hard her
Brother and Sister shou'd suffer on her Score;
and said something that was tender, and well e∣nough,
on that Account: <HI>But Amy told her,</HI> It
was for her to take that into Consideration; for
she wou'd let her see, that it was all her own,
that she wou'd have done them all Good, but
that having been us'd thus, she wou'd do no more
for any of them; and that she shou'd not need to
be afraid to come into her Company again, for
she wou'd never give her Occasion for it any-more;
<HI>by the way,</HI> was false in <HI>the Girl</HI> too, for she did venture into <HI>Amy's</HI> Company again after that, once too
much; <HI>as I shall relate by it self.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="394"/>
They grew cooler however, afterwards, and
<HI>Amy</HI> carry'd her into a House at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where
she was acquainted, and took an Occasion to leave
the Girl in a Room a-while, to speak to the People
in the House, and so prepare them to own her as
a Lodger in the House; and then going in to her
again, <HI>told her,</HI> There she lodg'd, if she had a∣mind
to find her out; or if any-body else had
any-thing to say to her and so <HI>Amy</HI> dismiss'd
her, and got rid of her again; and finding an
empty Hackney-Coach in the Town, came away
by Land to <HI>London,</HI> and the Girl going down to
the Water-side, came by Boat.</P>
<P>This Conversation did not answer <HI>Amy's</HI> End
at-all, because it did not secure the Girl from
pursuing her Design of hunting me out; and tho'
my indefatigable Friend the QUAKER, amus'd
her three or four Days, yet I had such Notice of
it at last, that I thought fit to come away from
<HI>Tunbridge</HI> upon it, and where to go, I knew not;
but, <HI>in short,</HI> I went to a little Village upon <HI>Epping-Farest,</HI>
call'd <HI>Woodford,</HI> and took Lodgings in a
Private House, where I liv'd retir'd about six
Weeks, till I thought she might be tir'd of her
Search, and have given me over.</P>
<P>Here I received an Account from my trusty QUA∣KER,
that <HI>the Wench</HI> had really been at <HI>Tunbridge;</HI>
had found out my Lodgings; and had told her Tale
there in a most dismal Tone that she had sollow'd
us as she thought, to <HI>London;</HI> but the QUAKER
had answer'd her, That she knew nothing or it,
which was indeed true and had admonish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her
to be easie and not hunt after People of such
Fashion as we were, as if we were Thieve; that
she might ha assur'd, that since I was not willing
to see her, I wou'd not be forc'd to it; an treat∣ing
me thus wou'd effectually disoblige me: And
<PB N="390" REF="395"/>
And with such Discourses as these she quieted her;
and <HI>she</HI> (the QUAKER) <HI>added,</HI> that she hop'd
I shou'd not be troubl'd much more with her.</P>
<P>It was in this time that <HI>Amy</HI> gave me the Hi∣story
of her <HI>Greenwich Voyage,</HI> when she spoke of
drowning and killing the Girl, in so serious a man∣ner,
and with such an apparent Resolution of do∣ing
it, that, <HI>as I said,</HI> put me in a Rage with her,
so that I effectually turn'd her away from me, <HI>as I
have said above;</HI> and she was gone; nor did she so
much as tell me whither, or which Way she was
gone; on the other-hand, when I came to re∣flect
on it, that now I had neither Assistant or
Confident to speak to, or receive the least Infor∣mation
from, <HI>my Friend the</HI> QUAKER <HI>excepted,</HI> it,
made me very uneasie.</P>
<P>I waited, and expected, and wonder'd, from
Day to Day, still thinking <HI>Amy</HI> wou'd one time or
other, think a little, and come again, or <HI>at least,</HI>
let me hear of her; but for ten Days together I
heard nothing of her; I was so impatient, that
I got neither Rest by Day, or Sleep by Night,
and what to do I knew not; I durst not go to
Town to the QUAKER'S, for fear of meeting that
vexatious Creature, <HI>my Girl,</HI> and I cou'd get no In∣telligence,
where I was; so I got my Spouse, upon
Pretence of wanting her Company, to take the
Coach one Day, and fetch my good QUAKER to me.</P>
<P>When I had her, I durst ask her no Questions,
nor hardly knew which End of the Business to be∣gin
to talk of; but of her own accord <HI>she told me,</HI>
that the Girl had been three or four times haunt∣ing
her, for News from me; and that she had
been so troublesome, that she had been oblig'd
to show herself a little angry with her, and <HI>at last,</HI>
told her plainly, that she need give herself no Trou∣ble
in searching after me, by her means; for she
<PB N="391" REF="396"/>
(<HI>the</HI> QUAKER) wou'd not tell her, if she knew;
upon which she refrain'd a-while: But on the
other-hand, <HI>she told me,</HI> it was not sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for me to
send my own Coach for her to come in; for the
had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to believe, that <HI>she,</HI> (<HI>my Daugh∣ter</HI>)
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her Door Night and Day, <HI>nay,</HI> and
watch'd her too every time she went in and out;
for she was so bent upon a Discovery, that she
spar'd no Pains; and she believ'd she had taken a
Lodging very near their House, for that Purpose.</P>
<P>I could hardly give her a Hearing of all this,
for my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to ask for <HI>Amy;</HI> but I was con∣founded
when she told me she had heard nothing
of her; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> impossible to express the anxious
Thoughts that rowl'd about in my Mind, and
continually perplex'd me about her; particularly, I
reproach'd myself with my Rashness, in turning
away so faithful a Creature, that for so many Years
had not only been a Servant, but an Agent; and
not only an Agent, but a Friend, and a faithful
Friend too.</P>
<P>Then I consider'd too, that <HI>Amy</HI> knew all the
Secret History of my Life; had been in all the In∣triegues
of it, and been a Party in both Evil and
Good, and at best, there was no Policy in it;
that <HI>as</HI> it was very ungenerous and unkind, to
run Things to such an Extremity with her, and
for an Occasion too, in which all the Fault she
was guilty of, was owing to her Excess of Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
for my Safety; <HI>so</HI> it must be only her steddy
Kindness to me, and an excess of Generous Friend∣ship
for me, that shou'd keep her from ill-using
me in return or it; which ill-using me was enough
in her Power, and might be my utter Undoing.</P>
<P>These Thoughts perplex'd me exceedingly; and
what Course to take, I really did not know; I be∣gan
indeed, to give <HI>Amy</HI> quite over, for she had
<PB N="392" REF="397"/>
now been gone above a Fortnight; and as she had
taken away all her Cloaths, and her Money too,
<HI>which was not a little,</HI> and so had no Occasion of
that kind, to come any-more, so she had not left
any word where she was gone, or to which Part of
the World I might send to hear of her.</P>
<P>And I was troubl'd on another Account too, <HI>viz.</HI>
That my Spouse and I too had resolv'd to do very
handsomely for <HI>Amy,</HI> without considering what
she might have got another way at-all; but we had
said nothing of it to her; and so I thought, as
she had not known what was likely to fall in her
way, she had not the Influence of that Expectation
to make her come back.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Perplexity of this Girl,
who hunted me, as if, <HI>like a Hound,</HI> she had had
a hot Scent, but was now at a Fault; <HI>I say,</HI> that
Perplexity, and this other Part, of <HI>Amy</HI> being
gone, issued in this, I resolv'd to be gone, and go
over to <HI>Holland;</HI> there I believ'd, I shou'd be at
rest: So I took Occasion one-Day to tell my
Spouse, that I was afraid he might take it ill that
I had amus'd him thus long, and that, <HI>at last,</HI> I
doubted I was not with-Child; and that since it
was so, our Things being pack'd-up, and all in order
for going to <HI>Holland,</HI> I wou'd go away now, when
he pleas'd.</P>
<P>My Spouse, who was perfectly cas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, whether
in going or staying, left it all entirely to me; so I
consider'd of it, and began to prepare again for
my Voyage; but alas! I was irresolute to the last
Degree; I was, for want of <HI>Amy,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; I had
lost my Right-Hand; she was my Steward, ga∣ther'd
in my Rents, <HI>I mean my Interest-Money,</HI> and
kept my Accompts, and, <HI>in a word,</HI> did all my Bu∣siness;
and without her, <HI>indeed,</HI> I knew not how
to go away, nor how to stay: But an Accident
<PB N="393" REF="398"/>
thrust itself in here, and that even in <HI>Amy's</HI> Con∣duct
too, which frighted me away, and without her
too, in the utmost Horror and Confusion.</P>
<P>I have related how my faithful Friend the
QUAKER, was come to me, and what Account
she gave me of her being continually haunted by
my Daughter; and that, <HI>as she said,</HI> she watch'd
her very Door, Night and Day; <HI>the Truth was,</HI> she
had set a SPY to watch so effectually, that she
(<HI>the</HI> QUARER) neither went in or out, but she
had Notice of it.</P>
<P>This was too evident, when the next Morning
after she came to me, (<HI>for I kept her all-Night</HI>) to
my unspeakable Surprize, I saw a Hackney-Coach
stop at the Door where I lodg'd, and saw her (<HI>my
Daughter</HI>) in the Coach all-along: It was a very
good Chance in the middle of a bad one, that my
Husband had taken out the Coach that very Morn∣ing,
and was gone to <HI>London;</HI> as for me, I had
neither Life or Soul left in me; I was so confounded,
I knew not what to do, or to say.</P>
<P>My <HI>happy Visitor</HI> had more Presence of Mind
than I; <HI>and ask'd me,</HI> If I had made no Acquain∣tance
among the Neighbours? <HI>I told her,</HI> Yes, there
was a Lady lodg'd two Doors off, that I was very
intimate with; but hast <HI>thou</HI> no Way out backward
to go to her? <HI>says she:</HI> Now it happen'd there was
a Back-Door in the Garden, by which we usually
went and came to and from the House; so I told
her of it: Well, well, says she, <HI>Go out and make a
Visit then, and leave the rest to me:</HI> Away I run;
told the Lady, (for I was very free there) that I
was a Widow to-Day, my Spouse being gone to
<HI>London,</HI> so I came not to visit her, but to dwell
with her that Day; because also, our Landlady
had got Strangers come from <HI>London:</HI> So having
fram'd this orderly LYE, I pull'd some Work
<PB N="394" REF="399"/>
out of my Pocket, <HI>and added,</HI> I did not come to
be Idle.</P>
<P>As I went out one-way, my Friend the QUAKER
went the other, to receive this unwelcome Guest:
The Girl made but little Ceremony; but having
bid the Coachman <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the Gate, gets down, out
of the Coach, and comes to the Door; a Count∣ry-Girl
going to the Door, (belonging to the
House) for the QUAKER forbid any of my
Maids going: <HI>Madam</HI> ask'd for my QUAKER by
Name; and the Girl ask'd her to walk in.</P>
<P>Upon this, my QUAKER seeing there was no
hanging-back, goes to her immediately, but put
on all the Gravity upon her Countenance, that she
was Mistress of; and that was not a little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>When she (<HI>the</HI> QUAKER) came into the Room,
(<HI>for they had show'd my Daughter into a little Par∣lour</HI>)
she kept her grave Countenance, but said not
a Word; nor did <HI>my Daughter</HI> speak a good-while;
but after some time, <HI>my Girl</HI> began, <HI>and
said,</HI> I suppose you know me, Madam.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, I know <HI>thee;</HI> and so
the Dialogue went on.</P>

<HI>thee,</HI> and declares <HI>she</HI> is not <HI>thy</HI> Mother: Will'st

<SP>

<P>O! if I cou'd but speak to her, I wou'd

</SP>
<P>Well, but <HI>thou</HI> can'st not come to speak with
her, it seems.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Girl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will tell me if <HI>she</HI> is here; I
had a good Account that you were come out to
see her, and that <HI>she</HI> sent for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qu.</SPEAKER>
<P>I much wonder how <HI>thou</HI> could'st have
such an Account; if I had come out to see her,
<HI>thou</HI> hast happen'd to miss the House; for I assure
<HI>thee, she</HI> is not to be found in this House.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="396" REF="401"/>
Here the Girl importun'd her again, with the
utmost Earnestness, and cry'd bitterly; insomuch,
that my poor QUAKER was soften'd with it,
and began to perswade me to consider of it, and
if it might consist with my Affairs, to see her
and hear what she had to say; but this was
afterwards: <HI>I return to the Discourse.</HI></P>
<P>The QUAKER was perplex'd with her a long
time; she talk'd of sending back the Coach, and
lying in the Town all-Night: This my Friend
knew wou'd be very uneasie to me, but she durst
not speak a Word against it; but on a sudden
Thought, she offer'd a bold Stroke, which tho'
dangerous if it had happen'd wrong, had its de∣sir'd
Effect.</P>
<P><HI>She told her,</HI> That as for dismissing her Coach,
that was as she pleas'd; she believ'd, she wou'd
not easily get a Lodging in the Town; but that
as she was in a strange Place, she wou'd so much
befriend her, that she wou'd speak to the People
of the House, that if they had room, she might
have a Lodging there for one Night, rather than
be forc'd back to <HI>London,</HI> before she was free to
go.</P>
<P>This was a cunning, tho' a dangerous Step, and
it succeeded accordingly, for it amus'd the Creature
entirely, and she presently concluded, that really
I cou'd not be there then; otherwise she wou'd
never have ask'd her to lie in the House <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she
grew cold again presently, as to her lodging there;
<HI>and said, No,</HI> since it was so, She wou'd go back
that Afternoon, but she would come again in two
or three Days, and search that, and all the Towns
round, in an effedtual Manner, if she stay'd a
Week or two to do it; for, <HI>in short,</HI> if I was
in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> she wou'd find me.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="402"/>
In Truth, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, <HI>thou</HI> wilt make
me very hurtful to <HI>thee,</HI> then: Why so, <HI>says she?</HI>
Because wherever I go, <HI>thou</HI> wilt put <HI>thyself</HI> to
great Expence, and the Country to a great-deal of
unnecessary Trouble: Not unnecessary, <HI>says she:</HI>
Yes truly, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, it must be unneces∣sary,
because 'twill be to no Purpose; I think I
must abide in my own House, to save <HI>thee</HI> that
Charge and Trouble.</P>
<P>She said little to that, except that, <HI>she said,</HI> she
wou'd give her as little Trouble as possible; but
she was afraid she shou'd sometimes be uneasie to
her, which she hop'd she wou'd excuse: My
QUAKER <HI>told her,</HI> She wou'd much rather ex∣cuse
her, if she wou'd forbear; for that, if she
wou'd believe her, she wou'd assure her, she shou'd
never get any Intelligence of me, by her.</P>
<P>That set her into Tears again; but after a-while
recovering herself, <HI>she told her,</HI> Perhaps she might be
mistaken; and she (<HI>the</HI> QUAKER) shou'd watch
herself, very narrowly; or she might one time or
other get some Intelligence from her, whether she
wou'd or no; and she was satisfy'd she had gain'd
some of her by this Journey; for that if I was not in
the House, I was not far off; and if I did not remove
very quickly, she wou'd find me out: Very well,
<HI>says my</HI> QUAKER; then if the Lady is not willing
to see <HI>thee, thou</HI> giv'st me Notice to tell her, that
she may get out out of <HI>thy</HI> Way.</P>
<P>She flew out in a Rage at that, <HI>and told my Friend,</HI>
that if she did, a Curse wou'd follow her, and her
Children after her; and denounc'd such horrid
things upon her, as frighted the poor tender-heart∣ed
QUAKER strangely, and put her more out of
Temper, than ever I saw her before; so that she
resolv'd to go home the next Morning; and I,
that was ten times more uneasie than she, re∣solv'd
<PB N="398" REF="403"/>
to follow her, and go to <HI>London</HI> too; which
however, upon second Thoughts, I did not; but
took effectual Measures not to be seen or own'd, if
she came any-more; but I heard no more of her
for some time.</P>
<P>I stay'd there about a Fortnight, and in all that
time I heard no more of her, or of my QUAKER
about her; but after about two Days more, I had
a Letter from my QUAKER, intimating, that she
had something of moment to say, that she cou'd not
communicate by a Letter, but wish'd I wou'd give
myself the Trouble to come up; directing me to
come with the Coach into <HI>Goodman's-Fields,</HI> and
then walk to her Back-Door on-foot, which being
left open on purpose, the watchful Lady, if she
had any Spies, could not well see me.</P>
<P>My Thoughts had for so long time been kept
as it were, waking, that almost every-thing gave
me the Allarm, and this especially, so that I was
very uneasie; but I cou'd not bring Matters to
bear, to make my coming to <HI>London</HI> so clear to
my Husband as I wou'd have done; for he lik'd
the Place, and had a-mind, <HI>he said,</HI> to stay a lit∣tle
longer, if it was not against my Inclination;
so I wrote my Friend the QUAKER, Word,
<HI>That I cou'd not come to Town yet;</HI> and that be∣sides,
I cou'd not think of being there under Spies,
and afraid to look out-of-Doors; and so, <HI>in short,</HI>
I put off going for near a Fortnight more.</P>
<P>At the end of that Time she wrote again, <HI>in
which she told me,</HI> That she had not lately seen the
<HI>Impertinent Visitor,</HI> which had been so troublesome;
but that she had seen my <HI>Trusty Agent, Amy,</HI> who
told her, She had cry'd for six Weeks, without
Intermission; that <HI>Amy</HI> had given her an Account
how troublesome the Creature had been; and to
what Straits and Perplexities I was driven, by her
<PB N="399" REF="404"/>
hunting after, and following me from Place to
Place: Upon which, <HI>Amy</HI> had said, That notwith∣standing
I was angry with her, and had us'd her
so hardly, for saying something about her of the
same kind; yet there was an absolute Necessity
of securing her, and removing her out-of-the-way;
and that, <HI>in short,</HI> without asking my Leave, or
any-body's Leave, she wou'd take Care she shou'd
trouble her Mistress (<HI>meaning me</HI>) no more; and
that after <HI>Amy</HI> had said so, she had indeed, never
heard any-more of the Girl; so that she suppos'd
<HI>Amy</HI> had manag'd it so well, as to put an End
to it.</P>
<P>The innocent well-meaning Creature, my QUA∣KER,
who was all Kindness, and Goodness, in
herself, <HI>and particularly to me,</HI> saw nothing in this,
but she thought <HI>Amy</HI> had found some Way to
perswade her to be quiet and easie, and to give
over teizing and following me, and rejoic'd in it,
for my sake; as she thought nothing of any Evil
herself, so she suspected none in any-body else,
and was exceeding glad of having such good News
to write to me: But my Thoughts of it run other∣wise.</P>
<P>I was struck as with a Blast from Heaven, at
the reading her Letter; I fell into a Fit of
trembling, from Head to Foot; and I ran raving
about the Room like a Mad-Woman; I had no∣body
to speak a Word to, to give Vent to my Pas∣sion;
nor did I speak a Word for a good-while,
till after it had almost overcome me: I threw my∣self
on the Bed, and cry'd out, <HI>Lord be merciful to
me, she has murther'd my Child;</HI> and with that, a
Flood of Tears burst out, and I cry'd vehemently
for above an Hour.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="405"/>
My Husband was very happily gone out a-hunt∣ing,
so that I had the Opportunity of being alone,
and to give my Passions some Vent, by which I
a little recover'd myself: But after my Crying
was over, then I fell in a new Rage at <HI>Amy;</HI> I
call'd her a thousand Devils, and Monsters, and
hard-hearted Tygers; I reproach'd her with her
knowing that I abhorr'd it, and had let her know
it sufficiently, in that I had, <HI>as it were,</HI> kick'd
her out of Doors, after so many Years Friendship
and Service, only for naming it to me.</P>
<P>Well, after some time my Spouse came in from
his Sport, and I put on the best Looks I cou'd to
deceive him; but he did not take so little Notice
of me, as not see I had been crying, and that
something troubled me; and he press'd me to tell
him; I seem'd to bring it out with Reluctance,
<HI>but told him,</HI> My Backwardness was, more because
I was asham'd that such a Trifle shou'd have any
Effect upon me, than for any Weight that was
in it: So <HI>I told him,</HI> I had been vexing myself a∣bout
my Woman <HI>Amy</HI>'s not coming again; that
she might have known me better, than not to be∣lieve
I shou'd have been Friends with her again,
<HI>and the like;</HI> and that, <HI>in short,</HI> I had lost the best
Servant by my Rashness, that ever Woman had.</P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>says he,</HI> if that be all your Grief, I hope
you will soon shake it off; I'll warrant you, in a lit∣tle-while
we shall hear of Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> again; and so
it went off for that time: But it did not go off with
me; for I was uneasie, and terrified to the last De∣gree,
and wanted to get some farther Account of the
thing: So I went away to my sure and certain Com∣forter,
the QUAKER, and there I had the whole
Story of it; and the good innocent QUAKER gave
me Joy of my being rid of such an unsufferable
Tormentor.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="406"/>
Rid of her! Ay, <HI>says I,</HI> if I was rid of her
fairly and honourably; but I don't know what
<HI>Amy</HI> may have done; sure she ha'n't made her
away! O fie! <HI>says my</HI> QUAKER, how can'st
<HI>thou</HI> entertain such a Notion? <HI>No, no,</HI> made her
away! <HI>Amy</HI> didn't talk like that; I dare say, <HI>thou</HI>
may'st be easie in that, <HI>Amy</HI> has nothing of that
in her Head, I dare say, <HI>says she;</HI> and so threw
it, <HI>as it were,</HI> out of my Thoughts.</P>
<P>But it wou'd not do; it run in my Head con∣tinually,
Night and Day I cou'd think of nothing
else; and it fix'd such a Horrour of the Fact upon
my Spirits, and such a Detestation of <HI>Amy,</HI> who
I look'd upon as the Murtherer, that, <HI>as for her,</HI>
I believe, if I cou'd have seen her, I shou'd cer∣tainly
have sent her to <HI>Newgate,</HI> or to a worse
Place, upon Suspicion; <HI>indeed,</HI> I think I cou'd
have kill'd her with my own Hands.</P>
<P>As for the poor Girl herself, she was ever be∣fore
my Eyes; I saw her by-Night, and by-Day;
she haunted my Imagination, if she did not haunt
the House; my Fancy show'd her me in a hun∣dred
Shapes and Postures; sleeping or waking, she
was with me: Sometimes I thought I saw her
with her Throat cut; sometimes with her Head
cut, and her Brains knock'd-out; other-times
hang'd up upon a Beam; another time drown'd
in the Great Pond at <HI>Camberwell:</HI> And all these
Appearances were terrifying to the last Degree;
and that which was still worse, I cou'd really
hear nothing of her: I sent to the Captain's Wife
in <HI>Redriff, and she answer'd me,</HI> She was gone to
her Relations in <HI>Spittle-Fields;</HI> I sent thither, <HI>and
they said,</HI> she was there about three Weeks ago;
but that she went out in a Coach with the Gen∣tlewoman
that us'd to be so kind to her; but
whither she was gone, they knew not; for she
<PB N="402" REF="407"/>
had not been there since I sent back the Messen∣ger
for a Description of the Woman she went
out with; and they describ'd her so Perfectly,
that I knew it to be <HI>Amy,</HI> and none but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></P>
<P><HI>I sent word again,</HI> That Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she
went out with, left her in two or three Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;
and that they shou'd search for her, for I had rea∣son
to fear she was Murther'd: This frighted them
all intollerably; they believ'd: <HI>Amy</HI> had carry'd
her to pay her a Sum of Money, and that some∣body
had watch'd her after her having receiv'd it,
and had Robb'd and Murther'd her.</P>
<P>I believ'd nothing of that Part; but I believ'd as
it was, That whatever was done, <HI>Amy</HI> had done
it; and that, <HI>in short, Amy</HI> had made her away▪
and I believ'd it the more, because <HI>Amy</HI> came no
more near me, but confirm'd her Guilt by her
Absence.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I mourn'd thus for her, for
above a Month; but finding <HI>Amy</HI> still come not
near me, and that I must put my Affairs in a Po∣sture
that I might go to <HI>Holland,</HI> I open'd all my
Affairs to my dear trusty Friend, the QUAKER,
and plac'd her, in Matters of Trust, in the room of
<HI>Amy,</HI> and with a heavy, bleeding Heart for my
poor Girl, I embark'd with my Spouse, and all
our Equipage and Goods, on-board another <HI>Hol∣land's-Trader,</HI>
not a Packet-Boat, and went over
to <HI>Holland;</HI> where I arriv'd as I have said.</P>
<P>I must put in a Caution however, here, that
you must not understand me as if I let my Friend
the QUAKER into any Part of the Secret Hi∣story
of my former Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; nor did I commit the
Grand reserv'd Article of all, to her, <HI>viz.</HI> That
I was really the Girl's Mother, and the Lady
<HI>Roxana;</HI> there was no need of that Part being
expos'd; and it was always a Maxim with me,
<PB N="403" REF="408"/>
<HI>That Secrets shou'd never be open'd, without evident
Ʋtility:</HI> It cou'd be of no manner of Use to me,
or her, to communicate that Part to her, besides
she was too honest herself, to make it safe to me;
for tho' she lov'd me very sincerely, and it was
plain, by many Circumstances, that she did so;
yet she wou'd not <HI>Lye</HI> for me upon Occasion, as
<HI>Amy</HI> wou'd, and therefore it was not advisable on
any Terms to communicate that Part; for if the
Girl, or any one else, shou'd have come to her af∣terwards,
and put it home to her, Whether she
knew that I was the Girl's Mother or not; or was
the same as the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> or not, she either
wou'd not have denied it, or wou'd have done it
with so ill a Grace, such Blushing, such Hesitations,
and Faultrings in her Answers, as wou'd have put
the Matter out of doubt, and betray'd herself
and the Secret too.</P>
<P>For this Reason, <HI>I say,</HI> I did not discover any∣thing
of that kind to her; but I plac'd her, <HI>as I
have said,</HI> in <HI>Amy</HI>'s stead, in the other Affairs of
receiving Money, Interests, Rents, <HI>and the like,</HI>
and she was as faithful as <HI>Amy</HI> cou'd be, and as
diligent.</P>
<P>But there fell out a great Difficulty here, which
I knew not how to get over; and this was, how to
convey the usual Supply, or Provision and Money,
to the Uncle and the other Sister, who depended,
especially the Sister, upon the said Supply, for her
Support; and indeed, tho' <HI>Amy</HI> had said rashly,
that she wou'd not take any more Notice of the
Sister, and wou'd leave her to perish, <HI>as above,</HI>
yet it was neither in my Nature, or <HI>Amy</HI>'s either,
much less was it in my Design; and therefore I
resolv'd to leave the Management of what I had
reserv'd for that Work, with my faithful QUAKER,
but how to direct her to manage them, was the great
Difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="409"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> had told them in so many Words, That
she was not their Mother, but that she was the
Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> that carried them to their Aunt's;
that she and their Mother went over to the <HI>East-Indies</HI>
to seek their Fortune, and that there good
Things had befallen them; and that their Mother
was very rich and happy; that she (<HI>Amy</HI>) had
married in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but being now a Widow,
and resolving to come over to <HI>England,</HI> their Mo∣ther
had oblig'd her to enquire them out, and do
for them as she had done; and that now she was
resolv'd to go back to the <HI>Indies</HI> again; but that
she had Orders from their Mother to do very
handsomely by them; and, <HI>in a word,</HI> told them,
She had 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a-piece for them, upon Condi∣tion
that they prov'd sober, and married suitably
to themselves, and did not throw themselves away
upon Scoundrels.</P>
<P>The good Family in whose Care they had been,
I had resolv'd to take more than ordinary Notice
of; and <HI>Amy,</HI> by my Order, had acquainted them
with it, and oblig'd my Daughters to promise to
submit to their Government, as formerly, and to
be rul'd by the honest Man, as by a Father and
Counsellor; and engag'd him to treat them as his
Children; and to oblige him effectually to take
Care of them, and to make his Old-Age comfort∣able
both to him and his Wife, who had been so
good to the Orphans: had order'd her to settle
the other 2000 <HI>I. that is to say,</HI> the Interest of it,
which was 120 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, upon them: to be theirs
for both their Lives; but to come to my two
Daughters after them: This was so just, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
was so pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ntly manag'd by <HI>Amy,</HI> that nothing
she ever did for me, pleas'd me better: And in
this Posture, leaving my two Daughters with their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Friend, and so coming away to me, (<HI>as they
<PB N="405" REF="410"/>
thought to the</HI> East-Indies) she had prepar'd every∣thing
in order to her going over with me to <HI>Hol∣land;</HI>
and in this Posture that Matter stood when
that unhappy Girl, <HI>who I have said so much of,</HI> broke
in upon all our Measures, <HI>as you have heard;</HI> and
by an Obstinacy never to be conquer'd or pacify'd,
either with Threats or Perswasions, pursu'd her
Search after me (<HI>her Mother) as I have said,</HI> till she
brought me even to the Brink of Destruction, and
wou'd, in all Probability, have trac'd me out at
last, if <HI>Amy</HI> had not by the Violence of her
Passion, and by a Way which I had no Know∣ledge
of, and indeed abhorr'd, put a Stop to her;
of which I cannot enter into the Particulars here.</P>
<P>However, notwithstanding this, I cou'd not
think of going away, and leaving this Work so
unfinish'd as <HI>Amy</HI> had threatn'd to do, and for
the Folly of one Child, to leave the other to
starve; or to stop my determin'd Bounty to the
good Family I have mention'd: So, <HI>in a word,</HI> I
committed the finishing it all, to my faithful Friend
the QUAKER, to whom I communicated as much
of the old Story, as was needful to empower her to
perform what <HI>Amy</HI> had promis'd; and to make
her talk so much to the Purpose, as one employ'd
more remotely than <HI>Amy</HI> had been, needed to do.</P>
<P>To this Purpose, she had first of all a full Pos∣session
of the Money; and went first to the Ho∣nest
Man and his Wife, and settl'd all the Matter
with them; when she talk'd of Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> she
talk'd of her as one that had been empower'd by
the Mother of the Girls, in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but was
oblig'd to go back to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and had settl'd all
sooner, if she had not been hinder'd by the obsti∣nate
Humour of the other Daughter; that she had
left Instructions with her for the rest; but that the
other had affronted her so much, that she was
<PB N="406" REF="411"/>
gone away without doing any-thing for her; and
that now, if any-thing was done, it must be by
fresh Orders from the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I need not say how punctually my new Agent
acted; but which was more, <HI>she</HI> brought the Old-Man
and his Wife, and my other Daughter, several
times to her House, by which I had an Opportu∣nity,
<HI>being there only as a Lodger, and a Stranger,</HI> to
see my other Girl, which I had never done be∣fore,
since she was a little Child.</P>
<P>The Day I contriv'd to see them, I was dress'd-up
in a <HI>Quaker</HI>'s Habit, and look'd so like a <HI>Quaker,</HI>
that it was impossible for them, who had never
seen me before, to suppose I had ever been anything
else; also my Way of talking was suitable
enough to it, for I had learn'd that long before.</P>
<P>I have not Time here to take Notice what a
Surprize it was to me, to see my Child; how it
work'd upon my Affections; with what infinite
Struggle I master'd a strong Inclination that I had
to discover myself to her; how the Girl was the
very Counterpart of myself, only much hand∣somer;
and how sweetly and modestly she behav'd;
how on that Occasion I resolv'd to do more for her,
than I had appointed by <HI>Amy, and the like.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis enough to mention here, that as the set∣ling
this Affair made Way for my going on-board,
notwithstanding the Absence of my old Agent
<HI>Amy;</HI> so however, I left some Hints for <HI>Amy</HI> too,
for I did not yet despair of my hearing from her;
and that if my good QUAKER shou'd ever see
her again, she should let her see them; wherein
particularly ordering her to leave the Affair of
<HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> just as I had done, in the Hands of
my Friend, she shou'd come away to me, upon
this Condition nevertheless, that she gave full Sa∣tisfaction
to my Friend the QUAKER, that she
<PB N="407" REF="412"/>
had not murther'd my Child; for if she had, <HI>I told
her,</HI> I wou'd never see her Face more: How,
notwithstanding this, she came over afterwards,
without giving my Friend any of that Satisfaction,
or any Account that she intended to come over.</P>
<P>I can say no more now, but that, <HI>as above,</HI> being
arriv'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> with my Spouse and his Son,
<HI>formerly mention'd,</HI> I appear'd there with all the
Splendor and Equipage suitable to our new Pro∣spect,
<HI>as I have already observ'd.</HI></P>
<P>Here, after some few Years of flourishing, and
outwardly happy Circumstances, I fell into a dread∣ful
Course of Calamities, and <HI>Amy</HI> also; the very
Reverse of our former Good Days; the Blast of
Heaven seem'd to follow the Injury done the poor
Girl, by us both; and I was brought so low again,
that my Repentance seem'd to be only the Conse∣quence
of my Misery, as my Misery was of my
Crime.</P>
