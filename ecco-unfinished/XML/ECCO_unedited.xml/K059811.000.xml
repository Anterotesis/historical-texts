<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF THE
PLAGUE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was about the Beginning of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI>
1664, that I, among the
Rest of my Neighbours, heard in
ordinary Discourse, that the Plague
was return'd again in <HI>Holland;</HI> for
it had been very violent there, and
particularly at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and <HI>Ro∣terdam,</HI>
in the Year 1663. whether <HI>they say,</HI> it was
brought, some said from <HI>Italy,</HI> others from the <HI>Le∣vant</HI>
among some Goods, which were brought
home by their Turkey Fleet; others said it was
brought from <HI>Candia;</HI> others from <HI>Cyprus.</HI> It
matter'd not, from whence it come; but all a∣greed,
it was come into <HI>Holland</HI> again.</P>
<P>We had no such thing as printed News Pa∣pers
in those Days, to spread Rumours and Re∣ports
of Things; and to improve them by the
Invention of Men, as I have liv'd to see practis'd
since. But such things as these were gather'd
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
from the Letters of Merchants, and others, who
corresponded abroad, and from them was handed
about by Word of Mouth only; so that things
did not spread instantly over the whole Nation,
as they do now. But it seems that the Govern∣ment
had a true Account of it, and several Coun∣sels
were held about Ways to prevent its coming
over; but all was kept very private. Hence it
was, that this Rumour died off again, and Peo∣ple
began to forget it, as a thing we were very
little concern'd in, and that we hoped was not
true; till the latter End of <HI>November,</HI> or the Be∣gining
of <HI>December</HI> 1664, when two Men, said
to be French-men, died of the Plague in <HI>Long
Acre,</HI> or rather at the upper End of <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI>
The Family they were in, endeavour'd to con∣ceal
it as much as possible; but as it had got∣ten
some Vent in the Discourse of the Neigh∣bourhood,
the Secretaries of State gat Know∣ledge
of it. And concerning themselves to inquire
about it, in order to be certain of the Truth,
two Physicians and a Surgeon were order'd to
go to the House, and make Inspection. This
they did; and finding evident Tokens of the
Sickness upon both the Bodies that were dead,
they gave their Opinions publickly, that they
died of the Plague: Whereupon it was given in
to the Parish Clerk, and he also return'd them
to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly
Bill of Mortality in the usual manner, thus,
<Q>Plague 2. Parishes infected 1.</Q></P>
<P>The People shew'd a great Concern at this,
and began to be allarm'd all over the Town,
and the more, because in the last Week in <HI>De∣cember</HI>
1664, another Man died in the same
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
House, and of the same Distemper: And then
we were easy again for about six Weeks, when
none having died with any Marks of Infection,
it was said, the Distemper was gone; but after
that, I think it was about the 12th of <HI>February,</HI>
another died in another House, but in the same
Parish, and in the same manner.</P>
<P>This turn'd the Peoples Eyes pretty much to∣wards
that End of the Town; and the weekly
Bills shewing an Encrease of Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s
Parish more than usual, it began to be suspected,
that the Plague was among the People at that
End of the Town; and that many had died of it,
tho' they had taken Care to keep it as much
from the Knowlege of the Publick, as possible:
This possess'd the Heads of the People very much,
and few car'd to go thro' <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> or the
other Streets suspected, unless they had extraor∣dinary
Business, that obliged them to it.</P>
<P>This Encrease of the Bills stood thus; the u∣sual
Number of Burials in a Week, in the Parishes
of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s in the Fields, and St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Hol∣born
were from 12 to 17 or 19 each few more
or less; but from the Time that the Plague first
began in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Parish, it was observ'd, that
the ordinary Burials encreased in Number consi∣derably.

<P>Besides this, it was observ'd with great Un∣easiness
by the People, that the weekly Bill in
general encreas'd very much during these Weeks,
altho' it was at a Time of the Year, when usual∣ly
the Bills are very moderate.</P>
<P>The usual Number of Burials within the Bills
of Mortality for a Week, was from about 240
or thereabouts, to 300. The last was esteem'd a
pretty high Bill; but after this we found the Bills
successively encreasing, as follows.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Increased</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Dec.</HI> the 20. to the 27th, Buried 291.—</ITEM>
<ITEM>27. to the 3 <HI>Jan.</HI>—349.—58</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>January</HI> 3. to the 10.—394.—45</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. to the 17.—415.—21</ITEM>
<ITEM>17. to the 24.—474.—59</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This last Bill was really frightful, being a
higher Number than had been known to have
been buried in one Week, since the preceeding
Visitation of 1656.</P>
<P>However, all this went off again, and the
Weather proving cold, and the Frost which be∣gan
in <HI>December,</HI> still continuing very severe, even
till near the End of <HI>February,</HI> attended with sharp
tho' moderate Winds, the Bills decreas'd again,
and the City grew healthy, and every body began
to look upon the Danger as good as over; only
that still the Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s continu'd high:
From the Beginning of <HI>April</HI> especially they stood
at 25 each Week, till the Week from the 18th to
the 25th, when there was buried in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Parish 30, whereof two of the Plague, and 8 of
the Spotted-Feaver, which was look'd upon as the
same thing; likewise the Number that died of
the Spotted-Feaver in the whole increased, being
8 the Week before, and 12 the Week above∣named.</P>
<P>This alarm'd us all again, and terrible Appre∣hensions
were among the People, especially the
Weather being now chang'd and growing warm, and
the Summer being at Hand: However, the next
Week there seem'd to be some Hopes again, the
Bills were low, the Number of the Dead in all
was but 388, there was none of the Plague, and
but four of the Spotted-Feaver.</P>
<P>But the following Week it return'd again, and
the Distemper was spread into two or three
other Parishes (<HI>viz.</HI>) St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s-<HI>Holborn,</HI> St. <HI>Cle∣ment</HI>'s-<HI>Danes,</HI>
and to the great Affliction of the
City, one died within the Walls, in the Parish of
St. <HI>Mary-Wool-Church,</HI> that is to say, in <HI>Bearbinderlane</HI>
near the <HI>Stocks-market;</HI> in all there was nine of
the Plague, and six of the Spotted-Feaver. It
was however upon Inquiry found, that this <HI>French∣man</HI>
who died in <HI>Bearbinder-lane,</HI> was one who
having liv'd in <HI>Long-Acre,</HI> near the infected Houses,
had removed for fear of the Distemper, not know∣ing
that he was already infected.</P>
<P>This was the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> yet the Wea∣ther
was temperate, variable and cool enough-and
People had still some Hopes: That which en∣courag'd
them was, that the City was healthy,
the whole 97 Parishes buried but 54, and we be∣gan
to hope, that as it was chiefly among the
People at that End of the Town, it might go no
farther; and the rather, because the next Week
which was from the 9th of <HI>May</HI> to the 16th there
died but three, of which not one within the whole
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
City or Liberties, and St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s buried but 15,
which was very low: 'Tis true, St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s buried
two and thirty, but still as there was but one of
the Plague, People began to be easy, the whole
Bill also was very low, for the Week before, the Bill
was but 347, and the Week above-mentioned but
343: We continued in these Hopes for a few Days,
But it was but for a few; for the People were no
more to be deceived thus; they searcht the Houses,
and found that the Plague was really spread every
way, and that many died of it every Day: So that
now all our Extenuations abated, and it was no
more to be concealed, nay it quickly appeared that
the Infection had spread it self beyond all Hopes of
Abatement; that in the Parish of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, it
was gotten into several Streets, and several Fami∣lies
lay all sick together; And accordingly in the
Weekly Bill for the next Week, the thing began to
shew it self; there was indeed but 14 set down of
the Plague, but this was all Knavery and Collu∣sion,
for in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Parish they buried 40 in all,
whereof it was certain most of them died of the
Plague, though they were set down of other Di∣stempers;
and though the Number of all the Bu∣rials
were not increased above 32, and the whole
Bill being but 385, yet there was 14 of the Spot∣ted-Feaver,
as well as 14 of the Plague; and we
took it for granted upon the whole, that there
was 50 died that Week of the Plague.</P>
<P>The next Bill was from the 23d of <HI>May</HI> to the
30th, when the Number of the Plague was 17:
But the Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s were 53, a frightful
Number! of whom they set down but 9 of the
Plague: But on an Examination more strictly by
the Justices of the Peace, and at the Lord Mayor's
Request, it was found there were 20 more, who
were really dead of the Plague in that Parish, but
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
had been set down of the Spotted-Feaver or
other Distempers, besides others concealed.</P>
<P>But those were trifling Things to what followed
immediately after; for now the Weather set in hot,
and from the first Week in <HI>June,</HI> the Infection
spread in a dreadful Manner, and the Bills rise
high, the Articles of the Feaver, Spotted-Feaver,
and Teeth, began to swell: For all that could con∣ceal
their Distempers, did it to prevent their
Neighbours shunning and refusing to converse
with them; and also to prevent Authority shut∣ting
up their Houses, which though it was not
yet practised, yet was threatned, and People were
extremely terrify'd at the Thoughts of it.</P>
<P>The Second Week in <HI>June,</HI> the Parish of
St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, where still the Weight of the Infection
lay, buried 120, whereof though the Bills said but
68 of the Plague; every Body said there had been
100 at least, calculating it from the usual Number
of Funerals in that Parish as above.</P>
<P>Till this Week the City continued free, there
having never any died except that one <HI>Frenchman,</HI>
who I mention'd before, within the whole 97 Pa∣rishes.
Now there died four within the City, one
in <HI>Wood<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>street,</HI> one in <HI>Fenchurch street,</HI> and two in
<HI>Crooked-lane: Southwark</HI> was entirely free, ha∣ving
not one yet died on that Side of the Water.</P>
<P>I liv'd without <HI>Aldgate</HI> about mid-way between
<HI>Aldgate Church</HI> and <HI>White-Chappel-Bars,</HI> on the left
Hand or North-side of the Street; and as the
Distemper had not reach'd to that Side of the City,
our Neighbourhood continued very easy: But at
the other End of the Town, their Consternation
was very great; and the richer sort of People, es∣pecially
the Nobility and Gentry, from the West-part
of the City throng'd out of Town, with their
Families and Servants in an unusual Manner; and
this was more particularly seen in <HI>White-Chapel;</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
that is to say, the Broad-street where I liv'd: Indeed
nothing was to be seen but Waggons and Carts,
with Goods, Women, Servants, Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Coaches fill'd with People of the better Sort,
and Horsemen attending them, and all hurrying
away; then empty Waggons, and Carts appear'd and
Spare-horses with Servants, who it was apparent
were returning or sent from the Countries to fetch
more People: Besides innumerable Numbers of
Men on Horseback, some alone, others with Ser∣vants,
and generally speaking, all loaded with Bag∣gage
and fitted out for travelling, as any one might
perceive by their Appearance.</P>
<P>This was a very terrible and melancholy Thing
to see, and as it was a Sight which I cou'd not but
look on from Morning to Night; for indeed there
was nothing else of Moment to be seen, it filled me
with very serious Thoughts of the Misery that was
coming upon the City, and the unhappy Condition
of those that would be left in it.</P>
<P>This Hurry of the People was such for some
Weeks, that there was no getting at the Lord-Mayor's
Door without exceeding Difficulty; there
was such pressing and crouding there to get passes
and Certificates of Health, for such as travelled
abroad; for without these, there was no being
admitted to pass thro' the Towns upon the Road,
or to lodge in any Inn: Now as there had none
died in the City for all this time, My Lord Mayor
gave Certificates of Health without any Diffi∣culty
to all those who liv'd in the 97 Parishes, and
to those within the Liberties too for a while.</P>
<P>This Hurry, I say, continued some Weeks, that
is to say, all the Month of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> and the
more because it was rumour'd that an order of
the Government was to be issued out, to place
Turn-pikes and Barriers on the Road, to prevent
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Peoples travelling; and that the Towns on the
Road, would not suffer People from <HI>London</HI> to pass,
for fear of bringing the Infection along with them,
though neither of these Rumours had any Foun∣dation,
but in the Imagination; especially at first.</P>
<P>I now began to consider seriously with my Self,
concerning my own Case, and how I should dis∣pose
of my self; that is to say, whether I should
resolve to stay in <HI>London,</HI> or shut up my House and
flee, as many of my Neighbours did. I have
set this particular down so fully, because I know
not but it may be of Moment to those who come
after me, if they come to be brought to the same
Distress, and to the same Manner of making their
Choice and therefore I desire this Account may pass
with them, rather for a Direction to themselves to
act by, than a History of my actings, seeing it may
not be of one Farthing value to them to note what
became of me.</P>
<P>I had two important things before me; the one
was the carrying on my Business and Shop;
which was considerable, and in which was em∣bark'd
all my Effects in the World; and the other
was the Preservation of my Life in so dismal a
Calamity, as I saw apparently was coming upon
the whole City; and which however great it was,
my Fears perhaps as well as other Peoples, repre∣sented
to be much greater than it could be</P>
<P>The first Consideration was of great Moment
to me; my Trade was <HI>a Sadler,</HI> and as my Deal∣ings
were chiefly not by a Shop or Chance Trade,
but among the Merchants, trading to the <HI>English</HI>
Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> so my Effects lay very much
in the hands of such. I was a single Man 'tis true,
but I had a Family of Servants, who I kept at
my Business, had a House, Shop, and Ware-houses
fill'd with Goods; and in short, to leave them all
as things in such a Case must be left, that is to
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
say, without any Overseer or Person fit to be
trusted with them, had been to hazard the Loss
not only of my Trade, but of my Goods, and
indeed of all I had in the World.</P>
<P>I had an Elder Brother at the same Time in
<HI>London,</HI> and not many Years before come over
from <HI>Portugal;</HI> and advising with him, his Answer
was in three Words the same that was given
in another Case quite different, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Master save
thy self.</HI> In a Word, he was for my retiring into the
Country, as he resolv'd to do himself with his Fa∣mily;
telling me, what he had it seems, heard a∣broad,
that the best Preparation for the Plague
was to run away from it. As to my Argument
of losing my Trade, my Goods, or Debts, he
quite confuted me: He told me the same thing,
which I argued for my staying, (<HI>viz</HI>) <HI>That I would
trust God with my Safety and Health,</HI> was the
strongest Repulse to my Pretentions of losing my
Trade and my Goods; for, says he, is it not as
reasonable that you should trust God with the
Chance or Risque of losing your Trade, as that
you should stay in so imminent a Point of Danger,
and trust him with your Life?</P>
<P>I could not argue that I was in any Strait, as
to a Place where to go, having several Friends
and Relations in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> whence our Fa∣mily
first came from; and particularly, I had an
only Sister in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> very willing to receive
and entertain me.</P>
<P>My Brother, who had already sent his Wife and
two Children into <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> and resolv'd to
follow them, press'd my going very earnestly;
and I had once resolv'd to comply with his De∣sires,
but at that time could get no Horse: For
tho' it is true, all the People did not go out of
the City of <HI>London;</HI> yet I may venture to say, that
in a manner all the Horses did; for there was
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
hardly a Horse to be bought or hired in the
whole City for some Weeks. Once I resolv'd to
travel on Foot with one Servant; and as many
did, lie at no Inn, but carry a Soldiers Tent with
us, and so lie in the Fields, the Weather being
very warm, and no Danger from taking cold: I
say, as many did, because several did so at last,
especially those who had been in the Armies in
the War which had not been many Years past;
and I must needs say, that speaking of second Causes,
had most of the People that travelled, done so, the
Plague had not been carried into so many Coun∣try-Towns
and Houses, as it was, to the great Da∣mage,
and indeed to the Ruin of abundance of
People.</P>
<P>But then my Servant who I had intended to
take down with me, deceiv'd me; and being
frighted at the Encrease of the Distemper, and
not knowing when I should go, he took other Mea∣sures,
and left me, so I was put off for that Time;
and one way or other, I always found that to ap∣point
to go away was always cross'd by some
Accident or other, so as to disappoint and put it
off again; and this brings in a Story which other∣wise
might be thought a needless Digression,
(<HI>viz,</HI>) about these Disappointments being from
Heaven.</P>
<P>I mention this Story also as the best Method
I can advise any Person to take in such a Case, e∣specially,
if he be one that makes Conscience of
his Duty, and would be directed what to do in
it, namely, that he should keep his Eye upon the
particular Providences which occur at that Time,
and look upon them complexly, as they regard
one another, and as altogether regard the Que∣stion
before him, and then I think, he may safely
take them for Intimations from Heaven of what
is his unquestion'd Duty to do in such a Case;
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
I mean as to going away from, or staying in the
Place where we dwell, when visited with an in∣fectious
Distemper.</P>
<P>It came very warmly into my Mind, one
Morning, as I was musing on this particular thing,
that as nothing attended us without the Direction
or Permission of Divine Power, so these Disap∣pointments
must have something in them extraor∣dinary;
and I ought to consider whether it did
not evidently point out, or intimate to me, that it
was the Will of Heaven I should not go. It im∣mediately
follow'd in my Thoughts, that if it real∣ly
was from God, that I should stay, he was able
effectually to preserve me in the midst of all the
Death and Danger that would surround me; and
that if I attempted to secure my self by fleeing
from my Habitation, and acted contrary to these
Intimations, which I believed to be Divine, it was
a kind of flying from God, and that he could
cause his Justice to overtake me when and where
he thought fit.</P>
<P>These thoughts quite turn'd my Resolutions a∣gain,
and when I came to discourse with my Bro∣ther
again I told him, that I enclin'd to stay and
take my Lot in that Station in which God had
plac'd me; and that it seem'd to be made more
especially my Duty, on the Account of what I
have said.</P>
<P>My Brother, tho' a very Religious Man him∣self,
laught at all I had suggested about its being
an Intimation from Heaven, and told me several
Stories of such fool-hardy People, <HI>as he call'd them,</HI>
as I was; that I ought indeed to submit to it as
a Work of Heaven, if I had been any way disabled
by Distempers or Diseases, and that then not be∣ing
able to go, I ought to acquiesce in the Di∣rection
of him, who having been my Maker, had
an undisputed Right of Soveraignity in disposing
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
of me; and that then there had been no Diffi∣culty
to determine which was the Call of his Pro∣vidence,
and which was not: But that I should
take it as an Intimation from Heaven, that I
should not go out of Town, only because I could
not hire a Horse to go, or my Fellow was run away
that was to attend me, was ridiculous, since at the
same Time I had my Health and Limbs, and other
Servants, and might, with Ease, travel a Day or
two on foot, and having a good Certificate of
being in perfect Health, might either hire a Horse,
or take Post on the Road, as I thought fit.</P>
<P>Then he proceeded to tell me of the mischei∣vous
Consequences which attended the Presum∣ption
of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Mahometans</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> and
in other Places, where he had been (for my Bro∣ther
being a Merchant, was a few Years before,
as I have already observ'd, returned from abroad,
coming last from <HI>Lisbon</HI>) and how presuming up∣on
their profess'd predestinating Notions, and of
every Man's End being predetermin'd and unalte∣rably
before-hand decreed, they would go uncon∣cern'd
into infected Places, and converse with in∣fected
Persons, by which Means they died at the
Rate of Ten or Fifteen Thousand a-Week, whereas
the <HI>Europeans,</HI> or Christian Merchants, who kept
themselves retired and reserv'd, generally escap'd
the Contagion.</P>
<P>Upon these Arguments my Brother chang'd
my Resolutions again, and I began to resolve to
go, and accordingly made all things ready; for
in short, the Infection increased round me, and
the Bills were risen to almost 700 a-Week, and
my Brother told me, he would venture to stay no
longer. I desir'd him to let me consider of it but
till the next Day, and I would resolve; and
as I had already prepar'd every thing as well
as I could, as to my Business, and who to en∣trust
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
my Affairs with, I had little to do but to re∣solve.</P>
<P>I went Home that Evening greatly oppress'd in
my Mind, irresolute, and not knowing what to
do; I had set the Evening wholly apart to con∣sider
seriously about it, and was all alone; for al∣ready
People had, as it were by a general Con∣sent,
taken up the Custom of not going out of
Doors after Sun-set, the Reasons I shall have Oc∣casion
to say more of by-and-by.</P>
<P>In the Retirement of this Evening I endeavou∣red
to resolve first, what was my Duty to do,
and I stated the Arguments with which my Bro∣ther
had press'd me to go into the Country, and
I set against them the strong Impressions which
I had on my Mind for staying; the visible Call I
seem'd to have from the particular Circumstance
of my Calling, and the Care due from me for
the Preservation of my Effects, which were, as I
might say, my Estate; also the Intimations which
I thought I had from Heaven, that to me sig∣nify'd
a kind of Direction to venture, and it oc∣curr'd
to me, that if I had what I might call
a Direction to stay, I ought to suppose it con∣tain'd
a Promise of being preserved, if I obey'd.</P>
<P>This lay close to me, and my Mind seemed
more and more encouraged to stay than ever, and
supported with a secret Satisfaction, that I should
be kept: Add to this that turning over the Bible,
which lay before me, and while my Thoughts
were more than ordinarily serious upon the Que∣stion,
I cry'd out, WELL, <HI>I know not what to
do, Lord direct me!</HI> and the like; and that Jun∣cture
I happen'd to stop turning over the Book at
the 91<HI>st Psalm,</HI> and casting my Eye on the second
Verse, I read on to the 7th Verse exclusive; and
after that, included the 10th, as follows. <HI>I will
say of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my foretress,
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
my God, in him will I trust. Surely he shall de∣liver
thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the
noisom pestilence. He shall cover the with his fea∣thers,
and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth
shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be
afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow
that flieth by day: Nor for the pestilence that walk∣eth
in darkness: nor for the destruction that wasteth
at noon-day. A thousand shall fall at thy side and
ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall not come
nigh thee. Only with thine Eyes shalt thou behold and
see the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made
the Lord which is my refuge, even the most High, thy
habitation: There shall no evil befal thee, neither shall
any plague come nigh thy dwelling,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I scarce need tell the Reader, that from that
Moment I resolv'd that I would stay in the Town,
and easting my self entirely upon the Goodness
and Protection of the Almighty, would not
seek any other Shelter whatever; and that as my
Times were in his Hands, he was as able to keep
me in a Time of the Infection as in a Time of
Health; and if he did not think fit to deliver me,
still I was in his Hands, and it was meet he should
do with me as should seem good to him.</P>
<P>With this Resolution I went to Bed; and I was
farther confirm'd in it the next Day, by the Wo∣man
being taken ill with whom I had intended to
entrust my House and all my Affairs: But I had
a farther Obligation laid on me on the same Side;
for the next Day I found my self very much out
of Order also; so that if I would have gone away,
I could not, and I continued ill three or four Days,
and this intirely determin'd my Stay; so I took
my leave of my Brother, who went away to
<HI>Darking</HI> in <HI>Surry.</HI> and afterwards fetch'd a Round
farther into <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> or <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> to a
Retreat he had found out there for his Family.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
It was a very ill Time to be sick in, for if any
one complain'd, it was immediately said he had the
Plague; and tho' I had indeed no Symptoms of
that Distemper, yet being very ill, both in my
Head and in my Stomach, I was not without Ap∣prehension,
that I really was insected; but in a∣bout
three Days I grew better, the third Night
I rested well, sweated a little, and was much re∣fresh'd;
the Apprehensions of its being the Infe∣ction
went also quite away with my Illness, and I
went about my Business as usual.</P>
<P>These Things however put off all my Thoughts
of going into the Country; and my Brother also
being gone, I had no more Debate either with him,
or with my self, on that Subject.</P>
<P>It was now mid-<HI>July,</HI> and the Plague which
had chiefly rag'd at the other End of the Town,
and as I said before, in the Parishes of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s,
St. <HI>Andrews Holbourn,</HI> and towards <HI>Westminster,</HI>
began now to come <HI>Eastward</HI> towards the Part
where I liv'd. It was to be observ'd indeed, that
it did not come strait on towards us; for the
City, that is to say within the Walls, was indif∣ferent
healthy still; nor was it got then very much
over the Water into <HI>Southwark;</HI> for tho' there di∣ed
that Week 1268 of all Distempers, whereof it
might be suppos'd above 900 died of the Plague;
yet there was but 28 in the whole City, within
the Walls; and but 19 in <HI>Southwark, Lambeth</HI>
Parish included; whereas in the Parishes of St.
<HI>Giles,</HI> and St. <HI>Martins in the Fields</HI> alone, there
died 421.</P>
<P>But we perceiv'd the Infection keept chiefly in the
out-Parishes, which being very populous, and
fuller also of Poor, the Distemper found more to
prey upon than in the City, as I shall observe after∣ward;
we perceiv'd I say, the Distemper to draw
our Way; (<HI>viz.</HI>) by the Parishes of <HI>Clerken-Well,
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Cripplegate, Shoreditch,</HI> and <HI>Bishopsgate;</HI> which last
two Parishes joining to <HI>Aldgate, White-Chapel,</HI> and
<HI>Stepney,</HI> the Infection came at length to spread its
utmost Rage and violence in those Parts, even
when it abated, at the <HI>Western</HI> Parishes where
it began.</P>
<P>It was very strange to observe, that in this
particular Week, from the 4th to the 11th of <HI>July,</HI>
when, as I have observ'd, there died near 400
of the Plague in the two Parishes of St. <HI>Martin's,</HI>
and St. <HI>Giles in the Fields</HI> only, three died in the
Parish of <HI>Aldgate</HI> but four, in the Parish of <HI>White-Chapel</HI>
three, in the Parish of <HI>Stepney</HI> but one.</P>
<P>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kewise in the next Week, from the 11th of
<HI>July</HI> to the 18th, when the Week's Bill was
1761, yet there died no more of the Plague, on
the whole <HI>Southwark</HI> Side of the Water than six∣teen.</P>
<P>But this Face of things soon changed, and it
began to thicken in <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Parish especially,
and in <HI>Clerken-Well;</HI> so, that by the second Week
in <HI>August, Cripplegate</HI> Parish alone, buried eight
hundred eighty six, and <HI>Clerken-Well</HI> 155; of the
first eight hundred and fifty, might well be rec∣koned
to die of the Plague; and of the last, the
Bill it self said, 145 were of the Plague.</P>
<P>During the Month of <HI>July,</HI> and while, as I have
observ'd, our Part of the Town seem'd to be or∣spar'd,
in Comparison of the <HI>West</HI> part, I went or∣dinarily
about the Streets, as my Business requir'd,
and particularly went generally, once in a Day,
or in two Days, into the City, to my Brother's
House, which he had given me charge of, and to
see if it was safe: And having the Key in my
Pocket, I used to go into the House, and over
most of the Rooms, to see that all was well; for
tho' it be something wond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rful to tell, that any
should have Hearts so hardned, in the midst of
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
such a Calamity, as to rob and steal; yet certain
it is, that all Sorts of Villanies▪ and even Le∣vities
and Debaucheries were then practis'd in
the Town, as openlyas ever, I will not say quite
as frequently, because the Numbers of People
were many ways lessen'd.</P>
<P>But the City it self began now to be visited
too, I mean within the Walls; but the Number
of People there were indeed extreamly lessen'd by
so great a Multitude having been gone into the
Country; and even all this Month of <HI>July</HI> they
continu'd to flee, tho' not in such Multitudes as
formerly. In <HI>August</HI> indeed, they fled in such a
manner, that I began to think, there would be
really none but Magistrates and Servants left in
the City.</P>
<P>As they fled now out of the City, so I should
observe, that the Court removed early, (<HI>viz.</HI>) in
the Month of <HI>June,</HI> and went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where
it pleas'd God to preserve them; and the Distem∣per
did not, <HI>as I heacd of,</HI> so much as touch them;
for which I cannot say, that I ever saw they
shew'd any great Token of Thankfulness, and hard∣ly
any thing of Reformation, tho' they did not
want being told that their crying Vices might,
without Breach of Charity, be said to have gone
fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in bringing that terrible Judgment upon the
whole Nation.</P>
<P>The Face of <HI>London</HI> was now indeed strangely
alter'd, I mean the whole Mass of Buildings, Ci∣ty,
Liberties, Suburbs, <HI>Westminster, Southwark</HI> and
altogether; for as to the particular Part called
the City, or within the Walls, that was not yet
much infected; but in the whole, the Face of
Things, I say, was much alter'd; Sorrow and
Sadness sat upon every Face; and tho' some Part
were not yet overwhelm'd, yet all look'd deeply con∣cern'd;
and as we saw it apparently coming on,
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
so every one look'd on himself, and his Family,
as in the utmost Danger: were it possible to repre∣sent
those Times exactly to those that did not see
them, and give the Reader due Ideas of the Horror
that every where presented it self, it must make
just Impressions upon their Minds, and fill them
with Surprize. <HI>London</HI> might well be said to be
all in Tears; the Mourners did not go about the
Streets indeed, for no Body put on black, or made
a formal Dress of Mourning for their nearest
Friends; but the Voice of Mourning was truly
heard in the Streets; the shriecks of Women and
Children at the Windows, and Doors of their
Houses, where their dearest Relations were, per∣haps
dying, or just dead, were so frequent to be
heard, as we passed the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ets, that it was e∣nough
to pierce the stoutest Heart in the World,
to hear them. Tears and Lamentations were seen
almost in every House, especially in the first Part
of the Visitation; for towards the latter End,
Mens Hearts were hardned, and Death was so al∣ways
before their Eyes, that they did not so much
concern themselves for the Loss of their Friends,
expecting, that themselves should be summoned
the next Hour.</P>
<P>Business led me out sometimes to the other
End of the Town, even when the Sickness was
chiefly there; and as the thing was new to me,
as well as to every Body else, it was a most sur∣prising
thing, to see those Streets, which were u∣sually
so thronged, now grown desolate, and so
few People to be seen in them, that if I had been
a Stranger, and at a Loss for my Way, I might
sometimes have gone the Length of a whole Street,
I mean of the by-Streets, and see no Body to di∣rect
me, except Watchmen, set at the Doors of
such Houses as were shut up; of which I shall
speak presently.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
One Day, being at that Part of the Town, on
some special Business, Curiosity led me to observe
things more than usually; and indeed I walk'd a
great Way where I had no Business; I went up <HI>Hol∣bourn,</HI>
and there the Street was full of People; but
they walk'd in the middle of the great Street, nei∣ther
on one Side or other, because, as I suppose,
they would not mingle with any Body that came
out of Houses, or meet with Smells and Scents
from Houses that might be infected.</P>
<P>The Inns-of-Court were all shut up; nor were
very many of the Lawyers in the Temple, or
<HI>Lincolns-Inn,</HI> or <HI>Greyes-Inn,</HI> to be seen there. Every
Body was at peace, there was no Occasion for
Lawyers; besides, it being in the Time of the Va∣cation
too, they were generally gone into the Coun∣try.
Whole Rows of Houses in some Places,
were shut close up; the Inhabitants all fled, and
only a Watchman or two left.</P>
<P>When I speak of Rows of Houses being shut
up, I do non mean shut up by the Magistrates;
but that great Numbers of Persons followed the
Court, by the Necessity of their Employments, and
other Dependencies: and as others retir'd, really
frighted with the Distemper, it was a mere deso∣lating
of some of the Streets: But the Fright was
not yet near so great in the City, abstractly so
called; and particularly because, tho' they were
at first in a most inexpressible Consternation, yet as
I have observ'd, that the Distemper intermitted
often at first; so they were as it were, allarm'd,
and unallarm'd again, and this several times, till
it began to be familiar to them; and that even,
when it appear'd violent, yet seeing it did not pre∣sently
spread into the City, or the <HI>East</HI> and
<HI>South</HI> Parts, the People began to take Courage,
and to be, as I may say, a little hardned: It
is true, a vast many People fled, as I have ob∣serv'd,
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
yet they were chiefly from the <HI>West</HI> End
of the Town; and from that we call the Heart
of the City, that is to say, among the wealthiest
of the People; and such People as were unincum∣bred
with Trades and Business: But of the rest,
the Generality stay'd, and seem'd to abide the
worst: So that in the Place we call the Liberties,
and in the Suburbs, in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and in the <HI>East</HI>
Part, such as <HI>Wapping, Ratclif, Stepney, Rotherhith,</HI> and
the like, the People generally stay'd, except here
and there a few wealthy Families, who, as above,
did not depend upon their Business.</P>
<P>It must not be forgot here, that the City and Su∣burbs
were prodigiously full of People, at the time
of this Visitation, I mean, at the time that it be∣gan;
for tho' I have liv'd to see a farther Encrease,
and mighty Throngs of People settling in <HI>London,</HI>
more than ever, yet we had always a Notion, that
the Numbers of People, which the Wars being o∣ver,
the Armies disbanded, and the Royal Family
and the Monarchy being restor'd, had flock'd to
<HI>London,</HI> to settle into Business; or to depend upon,
and attend the Court for Rewards of Services, Pre∣ferments,
<HI>and the like,</HI> was such, that the Town
was computed to have in it above a hundred thou∣sand
people more than ever it held before; nay,
some took upon them to say, it had twice as ma∣ny,
because all the ruin'd Families of the royal
Party, flock'd hither: All the old Soldiers set up
Trades here, and abundance of Families settled
here; again, the Court brought with them a
great Flux of Pride, and new Fashions; All Peo∣ple
were grown gay and luxurious; and the Joy
of the Restoration had brought a vast many Fami∣lies
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I often thought, that as <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was befieg'd
by the <HI>Romans,</HI> when the <HI>Jews</HI> were assembled to∣gether,
to celebrate the Passover, by which means,
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
an incredible Number of People were surpriz'd
there, who would otherwise have been in other
Countries: So the Plague entred <HI>London,</HI> when an
incredible Increase of People had happened oc∣casionally,
by the particular Circumstances above∣nam'd:
As this Conflux of the People, to a youth∣ful
and gay Court, made a great Trade in the
City, especially in every thing that belong'd to
Fashion and Finery; So it drew by Consequence,
a great Number of Work-men, Manufacturers, and
the like, being mostly poor People, who depended
upon their Labour, And I remember in particular,
that in a Representation to my Lord Mayor, of
the Condition of the Poor, it was estimated, that,
there were no less than an Hundred Thousand
Ribband Weavers in and about the City; the chie∣fest
Number of whom, lived then in the Parishes
of <HI>Shoreditch, Stepney, White-chapel,</HI> and <HI>Bishopsgate;</HI>
that namely, about <HI>Spittle-fields;</HI> that is to say,
as <HI>Spittle-fields</HI> was then; for it was not so large
as now, by one fifth Part.</P>
<P>By this however, the Number of People in the
whole may be judg'd of; and indeed, I often won∣dred,
that after the prodigious Numbers of Peo∣ple
that went away at first, there was yet so
great a Multitude left, as it appear'd there was.</P>
<P>But I must go back again to the Beginning of
this Surprizing Time, while the Fears of the
People were young, they were encreas'd strangely
by several odd Accidents, which put altogether,
it was realy a wonder the whole Body of the
People did not rise as one Man, and abandon
their Dwellings, leaving the Place as a Space of
Ground designed by Heaven for an Akeldama,
doom'd to be destroy'd from the Face of the
Earth; and that all that would be found in it,
would perish with it. I shall Name but a few
of these Things; but sure they were so many, and
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
so many Wizards and cunning People propagating
them, that I have often wonder'd there was any,
(Women especially,) left behind.</P>
<P>In the first Place, a blazing Star or Comet ap∣pear'd
for several Months before the Plague, as
there did the Year after another, a little before the
Fire; the old Women, and the Phlegmatic Hy∣pocondriac
Part of the other Sex, who I could al∣most
call <HI>old Women</HI> too, remark'd (especially after∣ward
tho' not, till both those Judgments were over,)
that those two Comets pass'd directly over the
City, and that so very near the Houses, that it
was plain, they imported something peculiar to
the City alone; that the Comet before the Pesti∣lence,
was of a faint, dull, languid Colour, and
its Motion very heavy, solemn and slow: But
that the Comet before the Fire, was bright and
sparkling, or as others said, flaming, and its
Motion swift and furious; and that accord∣ingly,
One foretold a heavy Judgment, slow but
severe, terrible and frightful, as was the Plague;
But the other foretold a Stroak, sudden, swift, and
fiery as the Conflagration; nay, so particular some
People were, that as they look'd upon that Co∣met
preceding the Fire, they fancied that they not
only saw it pass swiftly and fiercely, and cou'd per∣ceive
the Motion with their Eye, but even they
heard it; that it made a rushing mighty Noise,
fierce and terrible, tho' at a distance, and but just
perceivable.</P>
<P>I saw both these Stars; and I must confess, had
so much of the common Notion of such Things in
my Head, that I was apt to look upon them, as
the Forerunners and Warnings of Gods Judgments;
and especially when after the Plague had followed
the first, I yet saw another of the like kind; I
could not but say, God had not yet sufficiently
scourg'd the City.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27"/>
But I cou'd not at the same Time carry these
Things to the heighth that others did, knowing
too, that natural Causes are assign'd by the Astro∣nomers
for such Things; and that their Motions,
and even their Revolutions are calculated, or pre∣ded
to be calculated; so that they cannot be so
perfectly call'd the Fore-runners, or Fore-tellers,
much less the procurers of such Events, as Pesti∣lence,
War, Fire, and the like.</P>
<P>But let my Thoughts, and the Thoughts of the
Philosophers be, or have been what they will,
these Things had a more then ordinary Influence
upon the Minds of the common People, and they
had almost universal melancholly Apprehensions
of some dreadful Calamity and Judgment com∣ing
upon the City; and this principally from
the Sight of this Comet, and the little Allarm
that was given in <HI>December,</HI> by two People dying
at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s as above.</P>
<P>The Apprehensions of the People, were like∣wise
strangely encreas'd by the Error of the
Times; in which, I think, the People, from what
Principle I cannot imagine, were more adicted
to Prophesies, and Astrological Conjurations,
Dreams, and old Wives Tales, than ever they
were before or since: Whether this unhappy
Temper was originally raised by the Follies of
some People who got Money by it; that is to say,
by printing Predictions, and Prognostications I
know not; but certain it is, Book's frighted them
terribly; such as <HI>Lilly</HI>'s Almanack, <HI>Gadbury</HI>'s A∣logical
Predictions; Poor <HI>Robin</HI>'s Almanack and
the like; also several pretended religious Books;
one entituled, <HI>Come out of her my People, least you
be partaker of her Plagues;</HI> another call'd, Fair Warn∣ing;
another, <HI>Britains</HI> Remembrancer, and many
such; all, or most Part of which, foretold direct∣ly
or covertly the Ruin of the City: Nay, some
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
were so Enthusiastically bold, as to run about the
Streets, with their Oral Predictions, pretending
they were sent to preach to the City; and One
in particular, who, like <HI>Jonah</HI> to <HI>Nenevah,</HI> cry'd
in the Streets, <HI>yet forty Days, and LONDON
shall be destroy'd.</HI> I will not be positive, whether
he said yet forty Days, or yet a few Days. Ano∣ther
run about Naked, except a pair of Drawers
about his Waste, crying Day and Night; like a
Man that <HI>Josephus</HI> mentions, who cry'd, woe to
<HI>Jerusalem!</HI> a little before the Destruction of that
City: So this poor naked Creature cry'd, <HI>O! the
Great, and the Dreadful God!</HI> and said no more,
but repeated those Words continually, with a
Voice and Countenance full of horror, a swift
Pace, and no Body cou'd ever find him to stop,
or rest, or take any Sustenance, at least, that ever
I cou'd hear of. I met this poor Creature seve∣ral
Times in the Streets, and would have spoke
to him, but he would not enter into Speech with
me, or any one else; but held on his dismal Cries
continually.</P>
<P>These Things terrified the People to the last
Degree; and especially when two or three Times,
as I have mentioned already, they found one or
two in the Bills, dead of the Plague at St. <HI>Giles.</HI></P>
<P>Next to these publick Things, were the Dreams
of old Women: Or, I should say, the Interpre∣tation
of old Women upon other Peoples Dreams;
and these put abundance of People even out of
their Wits: Some heard Voices warning them to
be gone, for that there would be such a Plague
in <HI>London,</HI> so that the Living would not be able
to bury the Dead: Others saw Apparitions in
the Air; and I must be allow'd to say of both, I
hope with out breach of Charity, that they heard
Voices that never spake, and saw Sights that ne∣ver
appear'd; but the Imagination of the People
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
was really turn'd wayward and possess'd: And no
Wonder, if they, who were poreing continually
at the Clouds, saw Shapes and Figures, Repre∣sentations
and Appearances, which had nothing
in them, but Air and Vapour. Here they told
us, they saw a Flaming-Sword held in a Hand,
coming out of a Cloud, with a Point hanging
directly over the City. There they saw Herses,
and Coffins in the Air, carrying to be buried.
And there again, Heaps of dead Bodies lying un∣buried,
and the like; just as the Imagination of
the poor terrify'd People furnish'd them with Mat∣ter
to work upon.</P>
<Q><L>So Hypocondriac Fancy's represent</L>
<L>Ships, Armies, Battles, in the Firmament;</L>
<L>Till steady Eyes, the Exhalations solve,</L>
<L>And all to its first Matter, Cloud, resolve.</L></Q>
<P>I could fill this Account with the strange Rela∣tions,
such People gave every Day, of what they
had seen; and every one was so positive of their
having seen, what they pretended to see, that
there was no contradicting them, without Breach
of Friendship, or being accounted rude and un∣mannerly
on the one Hand, and prophane and im∣penetrable
on the other. One time before the
Plague was begun, (otherwise than as I have said
in St. <HI>Giles,</HI>'s) I think it was in <HI>March,</HI> seeing a
Crowd of People in the Street, I join'd with them
to satisfy my Curiosity, and found them all staring
up into the Air, to see what a Woman told them
appeared plain to her, which was an Angel cloth'd
in white, with a fiery Sword in his Hand, waving
it, or brandishing it over his Head. She describ∣ed
every Part of the Figure to the Life; shew'd
them the Motion, and the Form; and the poor
People came into it so eagerly, and with so much
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
Readiness; YES, <HI>I see it all plainly,</HI> says one.
<HI>There's the Sword as plain as can be.</HI> Another saw
the Angel. One saw his very Face, and cry'd
out, What a glorious Creature he was! One saw
one thing, and one another. I look'd as earnestly
as the rest, but, perhaps, not with so much Wil∣lingness
to be impos'd upon; and I said indeed,
that <HI>I could see nothing,</HI> but a white Cloud, bright
on one Side, by the shining of the Sun upon the
other Part. The Woman endeavour'd to shew it
me, but could not make me confess, that I saw it,
which, indeed, if I had, I must have lied: But
the Woman turning upon me, look'd in my Face,
aud fancied I laugh'd in which her Imagination
deceiv'd her too; for I really did not laugh, but
was very seriously reflecting how the poor People
were terrify'd, by the Force of their own Imagina∣tion.
However, she turned from me, call'd me
prophane Fellow, and a Scoffer; told me, that it
was a time of God's Anger, and dreadful Judg∣ments
were approaching; and that Despisers, such
as I, should <HI>wonder and perish.</HI></P>
<P>The People about her seem'd disgusted as well
as she; and I found there was no perswading
them, that I did not laugh at them; and that I
should be rather mobb'd by them, than be able
to undeceive them. So I left them; and this Ap∣pearance
pass'd for as real, as rhe Blazing Star
it self.</P>
<P>Another Encounter I had in the open Day also:
And this was in going thro' a narrow Passage
from <HI>Petty-France</HI> into <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> Church Yard, by a
Row of Alms-Houses; there are two Church Yards
to <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> Church, or Parish; one we go over
to pass from the Place call'd <HI>Petty-France</HI> into <HI>Bi∣shopsgate</HI>
Street, coming out just by the Church Door,
the other is on the side of the narrow Passage,
where the Alms-Houses are on the left; and a
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
Dwarf-wall with a Palisadoe on it, on the right
Hand; and the City Wall on the other Side, more
to the right.</P>
<P>In this narrow Passage stands a Man looking
thro' between the Palisadoe's into the Burying
Place; and as many People as the Narrowness of
the Passage would admit to stop, without hindring
the Passage of others; and he was talking mighty
eagerly to them, and pointing now to one Place,
then to another, and affirming, that he saw a
Ghost walking upon such a Grave Stone there;
he describ'd the Shape, the Posture, and the Move∣ment
of it so exactly, that it was the greatest Mat∣ter
of Amazement to him in the World, that every
Body did not see it as well as he. On a sudden
he would cry, <HI>There it is: Now it comes this Way:</HI>
Then, '<HI>Tis turn'd back;</HI> till at length he persuaded
the People into so firm a Belief of it, that one fan∣cied
he saw it, and another fancied he saw it;
and thus he came every Day making a strange
Hubbub, considering it was in so narrow a Pas∣sage,
till <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> Clock struck eleven; and then
the Ghost would seem to start; and as if he were
call'd away, disappear'd on a sudden.</P>
<P>I look'd earnestly every way, and at the very
Moment, that this Man directed, but could not
see the least Appearance of any thing; but so po∣sitive
was this poor man, that he gave the People
the Vapours in abundance, and sent them a∣way
trembling, and frighted; till at length, few
People, that knew of it, car'd to go thro' that
Passage; and hardly any Body by Night, on any
Account whatever.</P>
<P>This Ghost, as the poor Man afiirm'd, made
Signs to the Houses, and to the Ground, and to
the People, plainly intimating, or else they so un∣derstanding
it, that Abundance of the People,
should come to be buried in that Church-Yard;
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
as indeed happen'd: But that he saw such As∣pects,
I must acknowledg, I never believ'd; nor
could I see any thing of it my self, tho' I look'd
most earnestly to see it, if possible.</P>
<P>These things serve to shew, how far the People
were really overcome with Delusions; and as
they had a Notion of the Approach of a Visita∣tion,
all their Predictions run upon a most dread∣ful
Plague, which should lay the whole City, and
even the Kingdom waste; and should destroy al∣most
all the Nation, both Man and Beast.</P>
<P>To this, as I said before, the Astrologers added
Stories of the Conjunctions of Planets in a malig∣nant
Manner, and with a mischievous Influence;
one of which Conjunctions was to happen, and
did happen, in <HI>October;</HI> and the other in <HI>Novem∣ber;</HI>
and they filled the Peoples Heads with Pre∣dictions
on these Signs of the Heavens, intimat∣ing,
that those Conjunctions fortold Drought, Fa∣mine,
and Pestilence; in the two first of them how∣ever,
they were entirely mistaken, For we had no
droughty Season, but in the beginning of the Year,
a hard Frost, which lasted from <HI>December</HI> almost
to <HI>March;</HI> and after that moderate Weather, rather
warm than hot, with refreshing Winds, and in
short, very seasonable Weather; and also several
very great Rains.</P>
<P>Some Endeavors were used to suppress the
Printing of such Books as terrify'd the People,
and to frighten the disperser<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them, some of
whom were taken up, but nothing was done in
it, as I am inform'd; The Government being un∣willing
to exasperate the People, who were, <HI>as I
may say,</HI> all out of their Wits already.</P>
<P>Neither can I acquit those Ministers, that
in their Sermons, rather sunk, than lifted up the
Hearts of their Hearers; many of them no doubt
did it for the strengthning the Resolution of the
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
People; and especially for quickning them to Re∣pentance;
but it certainly answer'd not their End,
at least not in Proportion to the injury it did ano∣ther
Way; and indeed, as God himself thro' the
whole Scriptures, rather draws to him by Invitati∣ons,
and calls to turn to him and live, than drives
us by Terror and Amazement; So I must confess,
I thought the Ministers should have done also,
imitating our blessed Lord and Master in this, that
his whole Gospel, is full of Declarations from
Heaven of Gods Mercy, and his readiness to re∣ceive
Penitents, and forgive them; complaining,
<HI>ye will not come unto me, that ye may have Life;</HI>
and that therefore, his Gospel is called the Gospel
of Peace, and the Gospel of Grace.</P>
<P>But we had some good Men, and that of all
Persuasions and Opinions, whose Discourses were
full of Torror; who spoke nothing but dismal
Things; and as they brought the People together
with a kind of Horror, sent them away in Tears,
prophesying nothing but evil Tidings; terrifying
the People with the Apprehensions of being utter∣ly
destroy'd, not guiding them, at least not enough,
to Cry to Heaven for Mercy.</P>
<P>It was indeed, a Time of very unhappy Breaches
among us in matters of Religion: Innumerable
Sects, and Divisions, and seperate Opinions pre∣vail'd
among the People; the Church of <HI>England</HI>
was restor'd indeed with the Restoration of the
Monarchy, about four Year before; but the Mi∣nisters
and Preachers of the Presbyterians, and
Independants, and of all the other Sorts of Pro∣fessions,
had begun to gather seperate Societies,
and erect Altar against Altar, and all those had
their Meetings for Worship apart, as they have
but not so many then, the Dissenters being not
thorowly form'd into a Body as they are since, and
those Congregations which were thus gather'd to∣gether,
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
were yet but few; and even those that
were, the Government did not allow, but endea∣vour'd
to suppress them, and shut up their Meet∣ings.</P>
<P>But the Visitation reconcil'd them again, at
least for a Time, and many of the best and most
valuable Ministers and Preachers of the Dissen∣ters,
were suffer'd to go into the Churches, where
the Incumbents were fled away, as many were, not
being able to stand it; and the People flockt with∣out
Distinction to hear them preach, not much in∣quiring
who or what Opinion they were of: But
after the Sickness was over, that Spirit of Charity
abated, and every Church being again supply'd
with their own Ministers, or others presented,
where the Minister was dead, Things return'd to
their old Channel again.</P>
<P>One Mischief always introduces another: These
Terrors and Apprehensions of the People, led
them into a Thousand weak, foolish, and wicked
Things, which, they wanted not a Sort of People
really wicked, to encourage them to; and this
was running about to Fortune tellers, Cunning-men,
and Astrologers, to know their Fortune, or, as
'tis vulgarly express'd, to have their Fortunes told
them, their Nativities calculated, and the like;
and this Folly, presently made the Town swarm
with a wicked Generation of Pretenders to Ma∣gick,
to the <HI>Black Art, as they call'd it,</HI> and I know
not what; Nay, to a Thousand worse Dealings
with the Devil, than they were really guilty of; and
this Trade grew so open, and so generally practi∣sed,
that it became common to have Signs and
Inscriptions set up at Doors; here lives a For∣tune-teller;
here lives an Astrologer; here you
may have your Nativity calculated, and the like;
and Fryar <HI>Bacons</HI>'s Brazen-Head, which was the
usual Sign of these Peoples Dwellings, was to be
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
seen almost in every Street, or else the Sign of Mo∣ther
<HI>Shipton,</HI> or of <HI>Merlin</HI>'s Head, and the like.</P>
<P>With what blind, absurd, and ridiculous Stuff,
these Oracles of the Devil pleas'd and satisfy'd
the People, I really know not; but certain it is,
that innumerable Attendants crouded about their
Doors every Day; and if but a grave Fellow in
a Velvet Jacket, a Band, and a black Cloak, which
was the Habit those Quack Conjurers generally
went in, was but seen in the Streets, the People
would follow them, in Crowds and ask them Que∣stions,
as they went along.</P>
<P>I need not mention, what a horrid Delusion
this was, or what it tended to; but there was
no Remedy for it, till the Plague it self put an
End to it all; and I suppose, clear'd the Town of
most of those Calculators themselves. One Mis∣chief
was, that if the poor People ask'd these mock
Astrologers, whether there would be a Plague, or
no? they all agreed in the general to answer, <HI>Yes,</HI>
for that kept up their Trade; and had the People
not been kept in a Fright about that, the Wizards
would presently have been rendred use<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, and their
Craft had been at an end: But they always talked
to them of such and such Influences of the Stars,
of the Conjunctions of such and such Plane<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
which must necessarily bring Sicknes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Distem∣pers,
and consequently the Plague: And s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me had
the Assurance to tell them, the Plague was begun
already, which was too true, tho' they that said so,
knew nothing of the Matter.</P>
<P>The Ministers, to do them J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stice, and Preachers
of most Sorts, that were serious and understanding
Persons, thundred against these, and other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icked
Practises, and exposed the Folly as well as the Wick∣edness
of them together; And the most sober and
judicious People despis'd and ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or'd them: But
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was impossible to make any Impression upon the
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
midling People, and the working labouring Poor;
their Fears were predominant over all their Pas∣sions;
and they threw away their Money in a most
distracted Manner upon those Whymsies. Maid-Ser∣vants
especially and Men-Servants, were the chief
of their Customers; and their Question generally
was, after the first demand of, <HI>Will there be a Plague?</HI>
I say, the next Question was, <HI>Oh, Sir! For the Lord's
Sake, what will become of me? Will my Mistress keep me,
or will she turn me off? Will she stay here, or will she go
into the Country? And if she goes into the Country, will
she take me with her, or leave me here to be starv'd and
undone.</HI> And the like of Men-Servants.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Case of poor Servants was
very dismal, as I shall have occasion to mention a∣gain
by and by; for it was apparent, a prodigious
Number of them would be turn'd away, and it was
so; and of them abundance perished; and particu∣ly
of those that these false Prophets had flattered
with Hopes, that they should be continued in their
Services, and carried with their Masters and Mi∣stresses
into the Country; and had not publick
Charity provided for these poor Creatures, whose
Number was exceeding great, and in all Cases of
this Nature must be so, they would have been in
the worst Condition of any People in the City.</P>
<P>These Things agitated the minds of the com∣mon
People for many Months, while the first Ap∣prehensions,
were upon them; and while the Plague,
was not, as I may say, yet broken out: But I must
also not forget, that the more serious Part of the
Inhabitants behav'd after another Manner: The
Government encouraged their Devotion, and ap∣pointed
publick Prayers, and Days of fasting and
Humiliation, to make publick Confession of Sin,
and implore the Mercy of God, to avert the dread∣ful
Judgment, which hung over their Heads; and
it is not to be express'd with what Alacrity the
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
People of all persuasions enbraced the Occasion;
how they flock'd to the Churches and Meetings,
and they were all so throng'd, that there was often
no coming near, no, not to the very Doors of the
largest Churches; Also there were daily Prayers ap∣pointed
Morning and Evening at several Churches,
and Days of private praying at other Places; at
all which the People attended, I say, with an un∣common
Devotion: Several private Families also,
as well of one Opinion as of another, kept Fa∣mily
Fasts, to which they admitted their near Re∣lations
only: So that in a Word, those People, who
were really serious and religious, apply'd them∣selves
in a truly Christian Manner, to the proper
Work of Repentance and Humiliation, as a Chri∣stian
People ought to do.</P>
<P>Again the publick shew'd, that they would
bear their Share in these Things; the very Court,
which was then Gay and Luxurious, put on a
Face of just Concern, for the publick Danger:
All the Plays and Interludes, which after the Man∣ner
of the <HI>French</HI> Court, had been set up, and be∣gan
to encrease among us, were forbid to Act;
the gaming Tables, publick dancing Rooms, and
Music Houses which multiply'd, and began to de∣bauch
the Manners of the People, were shut up
and suppress'd; and the Jack-puddings, Merry-andrews,
Puppet-shows, Rope-dancers, and such
like doings, which had bewitch'd the poor common
People, shut up their Shops, finding indeed no
Trade; for the Minds of the People, were agitated
with other Things; and a kind of Sadness and
Horror at these Things, sat upon the Countenances,
even of the common People; Death was before
their Eyes, and every Body began to think of their
Graves, not of Mirth and Diversions.</P>
<P>But even those wholesome Reflections, which
rightly manag'd, would have most happily led the
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
people to fall upon their Knees, make Confession of
their Sins, and look up to their merciful Saviour
for Pardon, imploreing his Compassion on them,
in such a Time of their Distress; by which, we
might have been as a second <HI>Nineveh,</HI> had a quite
contrary Extreme in the common People; who ig∣norant
and stupid in their Reflections, as they were
brutishly wicked and thoughtless before, were
now led by their Fright to extremes of Folly; and
as I have said before, that they ran to Conjurers
and Witches, and all Sorts of Decievers, to know
what should become of them; who fed their Fears,
and kept them always alarm'd, and awake, on
purpose to delude them, and pick their Pockets:
So, they were as mad, upon their running after
Quacks, and Mountebanks, and every practising
old Woman, for Medicines and Remedies▪ store∣ing
themselves with such Multitudes of Pills, Po∣tions,
and Preservatives, as they were call'd; that
they not only spent their Money, but even poison'd
themselves before-hand, for fear of the Poison of
the Infection, and prepar'd their Bodies for the
Plague, instead of preserving them against it. On
the other Hand, it is incredible, and scarce to be
imagin'd, how the Posts of Houses, and Corners
of Streets were plaster'd over with Doctors Bills,
and Papers of ignorant Fellows; quacking and
tampering in Physick, and inviting the People to
come to them for Remedies; which was generally
set off, with such flourishes as these, (<HI>viz.</HI>) IN∣FALLIBLE
preventive Pills against the Plague▪
NEVER-FAILING Preservatives against the
Infection. SOVERAIGN Cordials against
the Corruption of the Air. EXACT Regu∣lations
for the Conduct of the Body, in Case of
an Infection: Antipestilential Pills. INCOMPA∣RABLE
Drink against the Plague, never found
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
out before. An UNIVERSAL Remedy for
the Plague. The ONLY-TRUE Plague-Wa∣ter.
The ROYAL-ANTIDOTE against
all Kinds of Infection; and such a Number more
that I cannot reckon up; and it I could, would
fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll a Book of themselves to set them down.</P>
<P>Others set up Bills, to summons People to their
Lodgings for Directions and Advice in the Case of
Infection: These had spacious Titles also, such as
these.</P>
<Q><P>An eminent <HI>High-Dutch</HI> Physician, newly come over
from <HI>Holland,</HI> where he resided during all the Time
of the great Plague, last Year, in <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> and

Plague upon them.</P>
<P>An <HI>Italian</HI> Gentlewoman just arrived from <HI>Naples,</HI>
having a choice Secret to prevent Infection, which
she found out by her great Experience, and did won∣derful
Cures with it in the late Plague there;
wherein there died 20000 in one Day.</P>
<P>An antient Gentlewoman having practised, with great
Success, in the late Plague in this City, <HI>Anno</HI> 1636,

direct Persons how to prevent their being touch'd
by any Contagious Distemper whatsoever. He di∣rects
the Poor <HI>gratis.</HI></P></Q>
<P>I take notice of these by way of Specimen: I
could give you two or three Dozen of the like, and
yet have abundance left behind. 'Tis sufficient
from these to apprise any one, of the Humour of
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
those Times; and how a Set of Thieves and Pick-pockets,
not only robb'd and cheated the poor Peo∣ple
of their Money, but poisoned their Bodies
with odious and fatal preparations; some with
Mercury, and some with other things as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad, per∣fectly
remote from the Thing pretended to; and
rather hurtful than servicable to the Body in case
an Infection followed.</P>
<P>I cannot omit a Subtilty of one of those Quack-operators,
with which he gull'd the poor People
to croud about him, but did nothing for them with∣out
Money. He had it seems, added to his Bills,
which he gave about the Streets, this Advertise∣ment
in Capital Letters, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>He gives Advice to
the Poor for nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Abundance of poor People came to him according∣ly,
to whom he made a great many fine Speeches;
examin'd them of the State of their Health, and
of the Constitution of their Bodies, and told them
many good things for them to do, which were of no
great Moment: But the Issue and Conclusion of all
was, that he had a preparation, which if they
took such a Quantity of, every Morning, he would
pawn his Life, they should never have the Plague,
no, tho' they lived in the House with People that
were infected: This made the People all resolve
to have it; But then the Price of that was <HI>so much,</HI>
I think 'twas half-a-Crown: But, Sir, says one poor
Woman, I am a poor Alms-Woman, and am kept by
the Parish, and your Bills say, you give the Poor
your help for nothing. Ay, good Woman, says
the Docter, so I do, as I publish'd there. I give
my Advice to the Poor for nothing; but not my
Physick. Alas, Sir! says she, that is a Snare laid
for the Poor then; for you give them your Ad∣vice
for nothing, that is to say, you advise them
gratis, to buy your Physick for their Money; so
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
does every Shop-keeper with his Wares. Here the
Woman began to give him ill Words, and stood at
his Door all that Day, telling her Tale to all the
People that came, till the Doctor finding she turn'd
away his Customers; was oblig'd to call her up
Stairs again, and give her his Box of Physick for
nothing, which, perhaps too was <HI>good for nothing
when she had it.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the people, whose Confusions
fitted them to be impos'd upon by all Sorts of
Pretenders, and by every Mountebank. There is
no doubt, but these quacking Sort of Fehows rais'd
great gains out of the miserable People; for we
daily found, the Crouds that ran after them were in∣finitely
greater, and their Doors were more throng∣ed
than those of Dr. <HI>Brooks,</HI> Dr. <HI>Upton,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hodges,</HI>
Dr. <HI>Berwick,</HI> or any, tho' the most famous Men of
the Time: And I was told, that some of them got
five Pound a Day by their Physick.</P>
<P>But there was still another Madness beyond all
this, which may serve to give an Idea of the di∣stracted
humour of the poor People at that Time;
and this was their following a worse Sort of
Deceivers than any of these; for these petty Thieves
only deluded them to pick their Pockets, and get
their Money; in which their Wickedness, <HI>whate∣ver
it was,</HI> lay chiefly on the Side of the Decei∣ver's
deceiving, not upon the Deceived: But in
this Part I am going to mention, it lay chiefly in
the People deceiv'd, or equally in both; and this
was in wearing Charms, Philters, Exorcisms, A∣mulets,
and I know not what Preparations, to for∣tify
the Body with them against the Plague; as if
the Plague was not the Hand of God, but a kind
of a Possession of an evil Spirit; and that it was to
be kept off with Crossings, Signs of the Zodiac,
Papers tied up with so many Knots; and certain
Words, or Figures written on them, as particular∣ly
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
the Word <HI>Abracadabra,</HI> form'd in Triangle, or

<P>I might spend a great deal of Time in my Ex∣clamations
against the Follies, and indeed Wick∣edness
of those things, in a Time of such Danger,
in a matter of such Consequences as this, of a
National Infection, But my Memorandums of these
things relate rather to take notice only of the Fact,
and mention that it was so: How the poor People
found the Insufficiency of those things, and how
many of them were afterwards carried away in
the Dead Carts, and thrown into the common
Graves of every Parish, with these hellish Charms
and Trumpery hanging about their Necks, re∣mains
to be spoken of as we go along.</P>
<P>All this was the Effect of the Hurry the People
were in, after the first Notion of the Plague be∣ing
at hand was among them: And which may
be said to be from about <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1664, but
more particularly after the two Men died in St
<HI>Giles</HI>'s, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Beginning of <HI>December.</HI> And a∣gai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,

the Plague ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dently spread it self, they soon be∣gan
to see the Folly of trasting to those unper∣forming
Creatures, who had Gull'd them of their
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
Money, and then their Fears work'd another
way, namely, to Amazement and Stupidity, not
knowing what Course to take, or what to do,
either to help or relieve themselves; but they ran
about from one Neighbours House to another;
and even in the Streets, from one Door to another
with repeated Cries, of, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us,
what shall we do?</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, the poor People were to be pity'd in one
particular Thing, in which they had little or no
Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ief, and which I Desire to mention with a seri∣ous
Awe and Reflection; which perhaps, every
one that reads this, may not relish: Namely, that
whereas Death now began not, <HI>as we may say,</HI> to
hover over every ones Head only, but to look in∣to
their Houses, and Chambers, and stare in their
Faces: Tho' there might be some stupidity, and
du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ness of the Mind, and there was so, a great
deal; yet, there was a great deal of just Alarm,
sounded into the very inmost Soul, <HI>if I may so say</HI>
of others: Many Consciences were awakened;
many hard Hearts melted into Tears; many a peni∣tent
Confession was made of Crimes long concealed:
would wound the Souls of any Christian, to have
heard the dying Groans of many a despairing Crea∣ture,
and none durst come near to comfort them:
Many a Robbery, many a Murder, was then con∣fest
aloud, and no Body surviving to Record the
Accounts of it. People might be heard even into the
Streets as we pass'd along, calling upon God for Mer∣cy,
thro' Jesus Christ, <HI>and saying,</HI> I have been a Thief,
I have been an Adulterer, I have been a Murderer,
and the like; and none durst stop to make the least
Inquiry into such Things, or to administer Com∣fort
to the poor Creatures, that in the Anguish both
of Soul and Body thus cry'd out. Some of the
Ministers did Visit the Sick at first, and for a lit∣tle
while, but it was not to be done; it would
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
have been present Death, to have gone into some
Houses: The very buryers of the Dead, who were
the hardnedest Creatures in Town, were some∣times
beaten back, and so terrify'd, that they durst
not go into Houses, where the whole Families were
swept away together, and where the Circumstan∣ces
were more particularly horrible as some were;
but this was indeed, at the first Heat of the Di∣stemper.</P>
<P>Time enur'd them to it all; and they ventured
every where afterwards, without Hesitation, as I
Occasion to mention at large hereafter.</P>
<P>I am supposing now, the Plague to be begun, as
I have said, and that the Magistrates begun to
take the Condition of the People, into their serious
Consideration; what they did as to the Regula∣tion
of the Inhabitants, and of infected Families.
I shall speak to by it self; but as to the Affair
of Health, it is proper to mention it here, that
having seen the foollsh Humour of the People, in
running after Quacks, and Mountebanks, Wizards,
and Fortune tellers, which they did as above, even
to Madness. The Lord Mayor, a very sober and
religious Gentleman appointed Physicians and Sur∣geons
for Relief of the poor; I mean, the diseas∣ed
poor; and in particular, order'd the College of
Physicians to publish Directions for cheap Reme∣dies,
for the Poor, in all the Circumstances of the
Distemper. This indeed was one of the most
charitable and judicious Things that could be
done at that Time; for this drove the People from
haunting the Doors of every Disperser of Bills; and
from taking down blindly, and without Considera∣tion,
Poison for Physick, and Death instead of Life.</P>
<P>This Direction of the Physicians was done by
a Consultation of the whole College, and as it was
particularly calculated for the use of the Poor;
and for cheap Medicines it was made publick,
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
so that every Body might see it; and Copies
were given <HI>gratis</HI> to all that desired it: But as
it is publick, and to be seen on all Occasions, I
need not give the Reader of this, the Trouble
of it.</P>
<P>I shall not be supposed to lessen the Authority
or Capacity of the Physicians, when, I say, that
the Violence of the Distemper, when it came to
its Extremity, was like the Fire the next Year;
The Fire which consumed what the Plague could
not touch, defy'd all the Application of Remedies;
the Fire Engines were broken the Buckets thrown
away; and the Power of Man was baffled, and
brought to an End; so the Plague defied all Medi∣cince;
the very Physicians were seized with it,
with their Preservatives in their Mouths; and
Men went about prescribing to others and tel∣ling
rhem what to do, till the Tokens were up∣on
them, and they dropt down dead, destroyed
by that very Enemy, they direc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d others to op∣pose.
This was the Case of several Physicians,
even some of them the most eminent; and of
several of the most skilful Surgeons; Abundance
of Quacks too died, who had the Folly to trust to
their own Medicines, which they must needs
be conscious to themselves, were good for no∣thing;
and who rather ought, like other Sorts
of Thieves, to have run away, senfible of their
Guilt, from the Justice that they could not
but expect should punish them, as they knew
they had deserved.</P>
<P>Not that it is any Derogation from the La∣bour,
or Application of the Physicans, to say, they
fell in the common Calamity; nor is it so in∣tended
by me; it rather is to their Praise, that
they ventured their Lives so far as even to lose
them in the Service of Mankind; They endeavou∣red
to do good, and to save the Lives of others; But
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
we were not to expect, that the Physicians could
stop God's Judgments, or prevent a Distemper
eminently arined from Heaven, from executing
the Errand it was sent about,</P>
<P>Doubtless, the Physicians assisted many by their
Skill, and by their Prudence and Applications,
to the saving of their Lives, and restoring their
Health: But it is no lessening their Character, or
their Skill, to say, they could not cure those that
had the Tokens upon them, or those who were
mortally infected before the Physicians were sent
for, as was frequently the Case.</P>
<P>It remains to mention now what publick
Measures were taken by the Magistrates for the
general Safety, and to prevent the spreading
of the Distemper, when it first broke out: I
shall have frequent Occasion to speak of their
Prudence of the Magistrates, their Charity, the
Vigilance for the Poor, and for preserving good
Order; furnishing Provisions, and the like, when
the Plague was encreased, as it afterwards was.
But I am now upon the Order and Regulations
they published for the Government of infected
Families.</P>
<P>I mention'd above shutting of Houses up; and
it is needful to say something particularly to
that; for this Part of the History of the Plague
is very melancholy; <HI>but the most grievous Story
must be told.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>June</HI> the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and
the Court of Aldermen, as I have said, began
more particularly to concern themselves for the
Regulation of the City.</P>
<P>The Justices of Peace for <HI>Middlesex,</HI> by Directi∣on
of the Secretary of State, had begun to shut
up Houses in the Parishes of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s <HI>in the Fields,</HI>
St. <HI>Martins,</HI> St. <HI>Clement Danes, &amp;c.</HI> and it was with
good Success; for in several Streets, where the
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
Plague broke out, upon strict guarding the Houses
that were infected, and taking Care to bury those
that died, immediatly after they were known to
be dead, the Plague ceased in those Streets. It was
also observ'd, that the Plague decreas'd sooner in
those Parishes, after they had been visited to the
full, than it did in the Parishes of <HI>Bishopsgate,
Shoreditch, Aldgate. White-Chappel, Stepney,</HI> and o∣thers,
the early Care taken in that Manner, being
a great means to the putting a Cheque to it.</P>
<P>This shutting up of Houses was a method first
taken, as I understand, in the Plague, which
happened in 1603, at the Coming of King
<HI>James</HI> the First to the Crown, and the Power of
shutting People up in their own Houses, was
granted by Act of Parliament, entitled, <HI>An Act
for the charitable Relief and Ordering of Persons in∣fected
with the Plague.</HI> On which Act of Parlia∣ment,
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the
City of <HI>London,</HI> founded the Order they made at
this Time, and which took Place the 1st of <HI>July</HI>
1665, when the Num<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers infected within the Ci∣ty,
were but few, the last Bill for the 92 Parishes
being but four; and some Houses having been
shut up in the City, and some sick People being
removed to the Pest-House beyond <HI>Bunhill-Fields,</HI>
in the Way to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slington; I say, by these Means,
when there died near one thousand a Week in the
Whole, the Number in the City was but 28,
and the City was preserv'd more healthy in Pro∣portion,
than any other Places all the Time of
the Infection.</P>
<P>These Orders of my Lord Mayor's were pub∣lish'd,
as I have said, the latter End of <HI>June,</HI> and
took Place from the first of <HI>July,</HI> and were as
follows, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<DIV2>
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
<HEAD>ORDERS Conceived and Published by the
Lord MAY OR and Aldermen of the City of
London, concerning the Infection of the Plague.
1665.</HEAD>
<P>“WHEREAS in the Reign of our late
Sovereign King <HI>James,</HI> of happy Me∣mory,
an Act was made for the chari∣table
Relief and ordering of Persons infected with
the Plague; whereby Authority was given to Ju∣stices
of the Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs and other
head Officers, to apppint within their several
Limits, Examiners, Searchers, Watchmen, Keep∣ers,
and Buriers for the Persons and Places in∣fected,
and to minister unto them Oaths for the
Performance of their Offices. And the same Sta∣tute
did also authorize the giving of other Di∣rections,
as unto them for the present Necessity
should seem good in their Discretions. It is now
upon special Consideration, thought very ex∣pedient
for preventing and avoiding of Infection
of Sickness (if it shall so please Almighty God)
that these Officers following be appointed, and
these Orders hereafter duly observed.”</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Examiners to be appointed in every Parish.</HEAD>

that in every Parish there be one,
two, or more Persons of good Sort and Credit,
chosen and appointed by the Alderman, his
Deputy, and common-Council of every Ward,
by the Name of Examiners, to continue in that
Office the Space of two Monrhs at least: And
if any fit Personso appointed, shall refuse to un∣dertake
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>

be committed to Prison until they shall con∣form
themselves accordingly.”</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Examiuers Office.</HEAD>
<P>“THAT these Examiners be sworn by the Al∣dermen,

what Persons be Sick, and of what Diseases, as
near as they can inform themselves; and upon
doubt in that Case, to command Restraint of Ac∣cess,
until it appear what the Disease shall prove:
And if they find any Person sick of the Infection,
to give order to the Constable that the House be
shut up; and if the Constable shall be found Re∣miss
or Negligent, to give present Notice there∣of
to the Alderman of the Ward.”</P>

in or out of such infected Houses, whereof they
have the Charge, upon pain of severe Punish∣ment.
And the said Watchman to do such fur∣ther
Offices as the sick House shall need and re∣quire:
and if the Watchmen be sent upon any
Business, to lock up the House, and take the Key
with him: And the Watchman by Day to attend
until ten of the Clock at Night: And the Watch∣man
by Night untill six in the Morning.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Searchers.</HEAD>

make due Search, and true Report to the utmost of
their Knowledge, whether the Persons whose Bo∣dies
they are appointed to Search, do die of the In∣fection,
or of what other Diseases, as near as they
can. And that the Physicians who shall be appoint∣ed
for Cure and Prevention of the Infection, do call
before them the said Searchers, who are, or shall be
appointed for the several Parishes under their res∣pective
Cares; to the end they may consider, whether
they are fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly qualified for that Employment; and
charge them from time to time as they shall see
Cause, if they appear defective in their Duties.”</P>
<P>“That no Searcher during this time of Visitation,
be permitted to use any publick Work or Employ∣ment,
or keep any Shop or Stall, or be employed
as a Landress, or in any other common Employ∣ment
whatsoever.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Chirurgeons.</HEAD>
<P>“FOR better assistance of the Searchers, for as

Chirurgeons, besides those that do already belong
to the <HI>Pest-House:</HI> Amongst whom the City and Li∣berties
to be quartered as the places lie most apt

them, or be named and directed unto them, by the

of the Disease of the said Parties.”</P>

“And forasmuch as the said Chirurgeons are to be
sequestred from all other Cures, and kept only to
this Disease of the Infection; It is order'd, That

<P>This shutting up of houses was at first counted
a very cruel and Unchristian Method, and the
poor People so confin'd, made bitter Lamentations:
Complaints of the Severity of it, were also daily
brought to my Lord Mayor, of Houses causelessly,
(and some maliciously) shut up: I cannot say, but
upon Enquiry, many that complained so loudly,
were found in a Condition to be continued, and
others again Inspection being made upon the sick
Person, and the Sickness not appearing infections,
or if uncertain, yet, on his being content to
be carried to the Pest-House, were released.</P>
<P>It is true, that the locking up the Doors of
Peoples Houses, and setting a Watchman there
Night and Day, to prevent their stirring out, or
any coming to them; when, perhaps, the sound
People, in the Family, might have escaped, if
they had been remov'd from the Sick, looked ve∣ry
hard and cruel; and many People perished in
these miserable Confinements, which 'tis reason∣able
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
to believe, would not have been distemper'd
if they had had Liberty, tho' the Plague was in the
House; at which the People were very clamorous
and uneasie at first, and several Violences were
committed, and Injuries offered to the Men, who
were set to watch the Houses so shut up; al∣so
several People broke out by Force, in many
Places, as I shall observe by and by: But it was
a publick Good that justified the private Mis∣chief;
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d there was no obtaining the least Miti∣gation,
by a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Application to Magistrates, or Go∣vernment,
at that Time, at least, not that I heard
of. This put the People upon all Manner of Stra∣tagem,
in order, if possible, to get out, and it
would fill a little Volume, to set down the Arts
us'd by the People of such Houses, to shut the Eyes
of the Watchmen, who were employ'd, to deceive
them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to escape, or break out from them; in
which frequent Scuffles, and some Mischief hap∣pened;
of which by it self.</P>
<P>As I went along <HI>Houndsditch</HI> one Morning, a∣bout
eight a-Clock, there was a great Noise; it
is true indeed, there was not much Croud, be∣cause
People were not very free to gather together,
or to stay long together, when they were there,
nor did I stay long there: But the Outcry was loud
enough to prompt my Curiosity, and I call'd to
one that look'd out of a Window, and ask'd what
was the Matter.</P>
<P>A Watchman, it seems, had been employed to
keep his Post at the Door of a House, which was
infected, or said to be infected, and was shut up;
he had been there all Night for two Nights toge∣ther,
as he told his Story, and the Day Watch∣man
had been there one Day▪ and was now come
to relieve him: All this while no Noise had
been heard in the House, no Light had been
seen; they call'd for nothing, sent him of no Er∣rands,
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
which us'd to be the chief Business of the
Watchman; neither had they given him any Di∣sturbance,
as he said, from the <HI>Monday</HI> afternoon,
when he heard great crying and screaming in the
House, which, as he supposed, was occasioned by
some of the Family dying just at that Time: it
seems the Night before, the Dead-Cart, as it was
called, had been stopt there, and a Servant-Maid
had been brought down to the Door dead, and the
Buriers or Bearers, as they were call'd, put her in∣to
the Cart, wrapt only in a green Rug, and
carried her away.</P>
<P>The Watchman had knock'd at the Door, it
seems, when he heard that Noise and Crying, as
above, and no Body answered, a great while; but
at last one look'd out and said with an angry
quick Tone, and yet a Kind of crying Voice, or
a Voice of one that was crying, <HI>What d'ye want,
that ye make such a knocking?</HI> He answer'd, <HI>I am the
Watchman! <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow do you do? What is the Matter?</HI>
The Person answered, <HI>What is that to you? Stop the
Dead-Cart.</HI> This It seems, was about one a-Clock;
soon after, <HI>as the Fellow said,</HI> he stopped the Dead∣Cart,
and then knock'd again, but no Body an∣swer'd:
He continued knocking, and the Bellman
call'd out several Times, <HI>Bring out your Dead;</HI> but
no Body answered, till the Man that drove the
Cart being call'd to other Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, would stay no
longer, and drove away.</P>
<P>The Watchman knew not what to make of
all this, so he let them alone, till the Morning-Man,
or Day Watchman, as they call'd him, came
to relieve him, giving him an Account of the
Particulars, they, knock'd at the Door a great
while, but no body answered; and they ob∣serv'd,
that the Window, or Casement, at which
the Person had look'd out, who had answer'd be∣fore,
continued open, being up two Pair of Stairs.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="62"/>
Upon this, the two Men to satisfy their Curio∣sity,
got a long Ladder, and one of them went up
to the Window, and look'd into the Room, where
he saw a Woman lying dead upon the Floor, in a
dismal Manner, having no Cloaths on her but
her Shift: But tho' he call'd aloud, and putting
in his long Staff, knock'd hard on the Floor, yet
no Body stirr'd or answered; neither could he
hear any Noise in the House.</P>
<P>He came down again, upon this, and acquaint∣ed
his Fellow, who went up also, and finding
it just so, they resolv'd, to acquaint either the
Lord Mayor, or some other Magistrate of it, but
did not offer to go in at the Window: The Ma∣gistrate
it seems, upon the Information of the
two Men, ordered the House to be broken open,
a Constable, and other Persons being appointed
to be present, that nothing might be plundred;
and accordingly it was so done, when no Body
was found in the House, but that young Woman,
who having been infected, and past Recovery,
the rest had left her to die by her self, and were
every one gone, having found some Way to de∣lude
the Watchman, and get open the Door, or
get out at some Back Door, or over the Tops of the
Houses, so that he knew nothing of it; and as to
those Crys and Shrieks, which he heard, it was
suppos'd, they were the passionate Cries of the
Family, at the bitter parting, which, to be sure,
it was to them all; this being the Sister to the
Mistress of the Family. The Man of the House,
his Wife, several Children, and Servants, being
all gone and fled, whether sick or sound, that I
could never learn; nor, indeed, did I make much
Enquiry after it.</P>
<P>Many such escapes were made, out of infected
Houses, as particularly, when the Watchman was
sent of some Errand; for it was his Business to go
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
of any Errand, that the Family sent him of, that is
to say, for Necessaries, such as Food and Physick;
to fetch Physicians, if they would come, or Sur∣geons,
or Nurses, or to order the Dead-Cart, and
the like; But with this Condition too, that when
he went, he was to lock up the Outer-Door of
the House, and take the Key away with him; to
evade this, and cheat the Watchmen, People got
two or three Keys made to their Locks; or they
found Ways to unscrew the Locks, such as were
screw'd on, and so take off the Lock, being in the
Inside of the House, and while they sent away
the Watchman to the Market, to the Bakehouse,
or for one Trifle or another, open the Door, and
go out as often as they pleas'd: But this be∣ing
found out, the Officers afterwards had Orders
to Padlock up the Doors on the Outside, and
place Bolts on them as they thought fit.</P>
<P>At another House, as I was inform'd, in the
Street next within <HI>Algate,</HI> a whole Family was
shut up and lock'd in, because the Maid-Servant
was taken sick; the Master of the House had com∣plain'd
by his Friends to the next Alderman, and
to the Lord Mayor, and had consented to have
the Maid carried to the Pest-House, but was re∣sused,
so the Door was marked with a red Cross,
a Padlo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k on the Outside, as above, and a Watch∣man
set to keep the Door according to publick
Order.</P>
<P>After the Master of the House found there was
no Remedy, but that he, his Wife and his Chil∣dren
were to be lockt up with this poor distemper∣ed
Servant; he call'd to the Watchman, and told
him, he must go then and fetch a Nurse for them,
to attend this poor Girl, for that it would be certain
Death to them all to oblige them to nurse her,
and told him plainly, that if he would not do
this, the Maid must perish either of the Distem∣per,
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
or be starv'd for want of Food; for he was
resolv'd none of his Family, should go near her;
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he lay in the Garret four Story high, where
she could not Cry out, or call to any Body for
Help.</P>
<P>The Watchman consented to that, and went
and fetch'd a Nurse as he was appointed, and
brought her to them the same Evening; during
this interval, the Master of the House took his
Opportunity to break a large Hole thro' his Shop
into a Bulk or Stall, where formerly a Cobler had
sat, before or under his Shop-window; but the
Tenant as may be supposed, at such a dismal
Time as that, was dead or remov'd, and so he had
the Key in his own keeping; having made his
Way into this Stall, which he cou'd not have done,
if the Man had been at the Door, the Noise he
was obliged to make, being such as would have
alam'd the Watchman; I say, having made his
Way into this Stall, he sat still till the Watchman
return'd with the Nurse, and all the next Day al∣so;
but the Night following, having contriv'd to
send the Watchman of another trifling Errand,
which as I take it, was to an Apothecary's for a
Plaster for the Maid, which he was to stay for
the making up, or some other such Errand that
might secure his staying some Time; in that
Time he conveyed himself, and all his Family out
of the House, and left the Nurse and the Watch∣man
to bury the poor Wench; that is, throw her
into the Cart, and take care of the House.</P>
<P>I cou'd give a great many such Stories as these,
diverting enough, which in the long Course of that
dismal Year, I met with, <HI>that is</HI> heard of, and
which are very certain to be true, or very near the
Tuth; that is to say, true in the General, for
no Man could at such a Time, learn all the Par∣ticulars:
There was likewise Violence used with
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
the Watchmen, <HI>as was reported</HI> in abundance of
Places; and I believe, that from the Beginning
of the Visitation to the End, there was not less
than eighteen or twenty of them kill'd, or so
wounded as to be taken up for Dead, which was
suppos'd to be done by the People in the infected
Houses which were shut up, and where they at∣tempted
to come out, and were oppos'd.</P>
<P>Nor indeed cou'd less be expected, for here were
just so many Prisons in the Town, as there were
Houses shut up; and as the People shut up or im∣prison'd
so, were guilty of no Crime, only shut up
because miserable, it was really the more intollera∣ble
to them.</P>
<P>It had also this Difference; that every Prison,
as we may call it, had but one Jaylor; and as he
had the whole House to Guard, and that many
Houses were so situated, as that they had several
Ways out, some more, some less, and some into several
Streets; it was impossible for one Man so to Guard
all the Passages, as to prevent the escape of Peo∣ple,
made desperate by the fright of their Circum∣stances,
by the Resentment of their usage, or by
the raging of the Distemper it self; so that they
would talk to the Watchman on one Side of the
House, while the Family made their escape at ano∣ther.</P>
<P>For example, in <HI>Coleman-street,</HI> there are abun∣dance
of Alleys, as appears still; a House was shut
up in that they call <HI>Whites</HI>-Alley, and this House
had a back Window, not a Door into a Court,
which had a Passage into Bell-Alley; a Watch∣man
was set by the Constable, at the Door of this
House, and there he stood, or his Comrade Night
and Day, while the Family went all away in the
Evening, out at that Window into the Court,
and left the poor Fellows warding, and watching,
for near a Fortnight.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="66"/>
Not far from the same Place, they blow'd up
a Watchman with Gun-powder, and burnt the
poor Fellow dreadfully, and while he made hi∣dious
Crys, and no Body would venture to come
near to help him; the whole Family that were able
to stir, got out at the Windows one Story high; two
that were left Sick, calling out for Help; Care
was taken to give them Nurses to look after them,
but the Persons fled were never found, till after
the Plague was abated they return'd, but as no∣thing
cou'd be prov'd, so nothing could be done
to them.</P>
<P>It is to be consider'd too, that as these were Prisons
without Barrs and Bolts, which our common Pri∣sons
are furnish'd with, so the People let themselves
down out of their Windows, even in the Face of
the Watchman, bringing Swords or Pistols in their
Hands, and threatening the poor Wretch to shoot
him, if he stir'd, or call'd for Help.</P>
<P>In other Cases, some had Gardens, and Walls,
or Pales between them and their Neighbours; or
Yards, and back-Houses; and these by Friend∣ship
and Entreaties, would get leave to get over
those Walls, or Pales, and so go out at their
Neighbour's Doors; or by giving Money to their
Servants, get them, to let them thro' in the Night;
so that in short, the shutting up of Houses, was
in no wise to be depended upon; neither did it
answer the End at all; serving more to make the
People desperate, and drive them to such Extremi∣ties,
as that, they would break out at all Adven∣tures.</P>
<P>And that which was still worse, those that did
thus break out, spread the Infection farther by their
wandring about with the Distemper upon them,
in their desperate Circumstances, than they would
otherwise have done; for whoever considers all the
Particulars in such Cases must acknowlede; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d we
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
cannot doubt but the severity of those Confine∣ments,
made many People desperate; and made
them run out of their Houses at all Hazards, and
with the Plague visibly upon them, not knowing
either whither to go, or what to do, or indeed,
what they did; and many that did so, were dri∣ven
to dreadful Exigences and Extremeties, and
Perish'd in the Streets or Fields for meer Want, or
drop'd down, by the raging violence of the Fever
upon them: Others wandred into the Country,
and went forward any Way, as their Desperation
guided them, not knowing whether they went or
would go, till faint and tir'd, and not getting any
Relief; the Houses and Villages on the Road,
refusing to admit them to lodge, whether infected
or no; they have perish'd by the Road Side, or
gotten into Barns and dy'd there, none daring
to come tothem, or relieve them, tho' perhaps not
infected, for no Body would believe them.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, when the Plague at first
seiz'd a Family, that is to say, when any one Body
of the Family, had gone out, and unwarily or other∣wise
catch'd the Distemper and brought it Home,
it was certainly known by the Family, before it
was known to the Officers, who, as you will see
by the Order, were appointed to examine into
the Circumstances of all sick Persons, when they
heard of their being sick.</P>
<P>In this Interval, between their being taken Sick,
and the Examiners coming, the Master of the
House had Leisure and Liberty to remove himself,
or all his Family, if he knew whether to go, and
many did so: But the great dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster was, that ma∣ny
did thus, after they were really infected them∣selves,
and so carry'd the Disease into the Houses
of those who were so Hospitable as to receive
them, which it must be confess'd was very cruel
and ungrateful.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="68"/>
And this was in Part, the Reason of the general
Notion, or scandal rather, which went about of
the Temper of People infected; Namely, that they
did not take the least care, or make any Scruple of
infecting others; tho' I cannot say, but there
might be some Truth in it too, but not so general
as was reported. What natural Reason could be
given, for so wicked a Thing, at a Time, when
they might conclude themselves just going to ap∣pear
at the Barr of Divine Justice, I know not:
I am very well satisfy'd, that it cannot be recon∣cil'd
to Religion and Principle, any more than it
can be to Generosity and Humanity; but I may
speak of that again.</P>
<P>I am speaking now of People made desperate,
by the Apprehensions of their being shut up, and
their breaking out by Stratagem or Force, either
before or after they were shut up, whose Misery
was not lessen'd, when they were out, but sadly
encreased: On the other Hand, many that thus
got away, had Retreats to go to, and other Hou∣ses,
where they lock'd themselves up, and kept
hid till the Plague was over; and many Fami∣lies
foreseeing the Approach of the Distemper, laid
up Stores of Provisions, sufficient for their whole
Families, and shut themselves up, and that so entire∣ly,
that they were neither seen or heard of, till the
Infection was quite ceased, and then came abroad
Sound and Well: I might recollect several such
as these, and give you the Particular of their
Management; for doubtless, it was the most ef∣fectual
secure Step that cou'd be taken for such,
whose Circumstance would not admit them to re∣move,
or who had not Retreats abroad proper for
the Case; for in being thus shut up, they were as
if they had been a hundred Miles off: Nor do I
remember, that any one of those Families misca∣ry'd;
among these, several <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants were
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
particularly remarkable, who kept their Houses
like little Garrisons besieged, suffering none to go
in or out, or come near them; particularly one in
a Court in <HI>Tbrockmorton</HI> Street, whose House look∣ed
into <HI>Drapers Garden.</HI></P>
<P>But I come back to the Case of Families infect∣ed,
and shut up by the Magistrates; the Misery
of those Families is not to be express'd, and it was
generally in such Houses that we heard the most
dismal Shrieks and Out-cries of the poor People
terrified, and even frighted to Death, by the Sight
of the Condition of their dearest Relations, and by
the Terror of being imprisoned as they were.</P>
<P>I remember, and while I am writing this Sto∣ry,
I think I hear the very Sound of it, a certain
Lady had an only Daughter, a young Maiden a∣bout
19 Years old, and who was possessed of a ve∣ry
Considerable Fortune; they were only Lod∣gers
in the House where they were: The young
Woman, her Mother, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aid, had been a∣broad
on some Occasion, I do not remember what,
for the House was not shut up; but about two
Hours after they came home, the young Lady
complain'd she was not well; in a quarter of an
Hour more, she vomited, and had a violent Pain in
her Head. Pray God, says her Mother in a terrible
Fright, my Child has not the Distemper! The
Pain in her Head increasing, her Mother ordered
the Bed to be warm'd, and resolved to put her to
Bed; and prepared to give her things to sweat,
which was the ordinary Remedy to be taken,
when the first Apprehensions of the Diftemper
began.</P>
<P>While the Bed was airing, the Mother undres∣sed
the young Woman, and just as she was laid
down in the Bed, she looking upon her Body with
a Candle, immediately discovered the fatal To∣kens
on the Inside of her Thighs. Her Mother
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
not being able to contain herself, threw down
her Candle, and scriekt out in such a frightful
Manner, that it was enough to place Horror upon
the stoutest Heart in the World; nor was it one
Skream, or one Cry, but the Fright▪ having seiz'd
her Spirits, she fainted first, then recovered, then
ran all over the House, up the Stairs and down the
Stairs, like one distracted, and indeed really was
distracted, and continued screching and crying
out for several Hours, void of all Sense, or at least,
Government of her Senses, and as I was told, ne∣ver
came throughly to herself again: As to the
young Maiden, she was a dead Corpse from that
Moment; for the Gangren which occasions the
Spots had spread her whole Body, and she died
in less than two Hours: But still the Mother
continued crying out, not knowing any Thing
more of her Child, several Hours after she was
dead. It is so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ago, that I am not certain,
but I think the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>her never recover'd, but died
in two or three Weeks after.</P>
<P>This was a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extraordinary Case, and I am there∣fore
the more particular in it, because I came so
much to the Knowledge of it; but there were in∣numerable
such like Cases; and it was seldom,
that the Weekly Bill came in, but there were
two or three put in <HI>frighted,</HI> that is, <HI>that may well
be call'd,</HI> frighted to Death: But besides those,
who were so frighted to die upon the Spot, there
were great Numbers frighted to other Extreams,
some frighted out of their Senses, some out of their
Memory▪ and some out of their Understanding:
But I return to the shutting up of Houses.</P>
<P>As several People, <HI>I say,</HI> got out of their Houses
by Stratagem, after they were shut up, so others
got out by bribing the Watchmen, and giving
them Money to let them go privately out in the
Night. I must confess, I thought it at that time,
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
the most innocent Corruption, or Bribery▪ that a∣ny
Man could be guilty of; and therefore could
not but pity the poor Men, and think it was hard
when three of those Watchmen, were publickly
whipt thro' the Streets, for suffering People to go
out of Houses shut up.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding that Severity, Money pre∣vail'd
with the poor Men, and many Families
found Means to make Salleys out, and escape that
way after they had been shut up; but these were
generally such as had some Places to retreat to; and
tho' there was no easie passing the Roads any whi∣ther,
after the first of <HI>August,</HI> yet there were many
Ways of retreat, and particularly, as I hinted, some
got Tents and set them up in the Fields, carrying
Beds, or Straw to lie on, and Provisions to eat, and
so liv'd in them as Hermits in a Cell; for no Body
would venture to come near them; and several
Stories were told of such; some comical▪ some tra∣gical,
some who liv'd like wandring Pilgrims in
the Desarts, and escaped by making themselves
Exiles in such a Manner as is scarce to be credit∣ed,
and who yet enjoyed more Liberty than was
to be expected in such Cases.</P>
<P>I have by me a Story of two Brothers and their
Kinsman, who being single Men, but that had
stay'd in the City too long to get away, and
indeed, not knowing where to go to have any Re∣treat,
nor having wherewith to travel far, took
a Course for their own Preservation, which, tho'
in it self at first, desperate, yet was so natural,
that it may be wondied, that no more did so at
that Time. They were but of mean Condition,
and yet not so very poor, as that they could not
furnish themselves with some little Convenien∣cies,
such as might serve to keep Life and Soul
together; and finding the Distemper increasing
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
in a terrible Manner, they resolved to shift, as
well as they could, and to be gone.</P>
<P>One of them had been a Soldier in the late
Wars, and before that in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and
having been bred to no particular Employment
but his Arms; and besides being wounded, and
not able to work very hard, had for some Time
been employ'd at a Baker's of Sea Bisket <HI>in
Wapping.</HI></P>
<P>The Brother of this Man was a Seaman too, but
some how or other, had been hurt of one Leg,
that he could not go to Sea, but had work'd for
his Living at a Sail Makers in <HI>Wapping,</HI> or there
abouts; and being a good Husband, had laid up
some Money, and was the richest of the Three.</P>
<P>The third Man was a Joiner or Carpenter by
Trade, a handy Fellow; and he had no Wealth,
but his Box, or Basket of Tools, with the Help
of which he could at any Time get his Living,
such a Time as this excepted, wherever he went,
and he liv'd near <HI>Shadwel.</HI></P>
<P>They all liv'd in <HI>Stepney</HI> Parish, which, as I
have said, being the last that was infected, or at
least violently, they stay'd there till they evi∣dently
saw the Plague was abating at the West
Part of the Town, and coming towards the East
where they liv'd.</P>
<P>The Story of those three Men, if the Reader
will be content to have me give it in their own
Persons, without taking upon me to either vouch
the Particulars, or answer for any Mistakes. I s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all
give as distinctly as I can, believing the History
will be a very good Pattern for any poor Man to
follow, in case the like Publick Desolation should
happen here; and if there may be no such Occa∣sion,
which God of his infinite Mercy grant us, still
the Story may have its Uses so many Ways as that
it will, I hope, never be said, that the relating has
been unprofitable.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73"/>
I say all this previous to the History, having
yet, for the present, much more to say before I
quit my own Part.</P>
<P>I went all the first Part of the Time freely about
the Streets, tho' not so freely as to run my self
into apparent Danger, except when they dug the
great Pit in the Church-Yard of our Parish of <HI>Al∣gate;</HI>
a terrible Pit it was, and I could not resist
my Curiosity to go and see it; as near as I may
judge, it was about 40 Foot in Length, and abo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
15 or 16 Foot broad; and at the Time I first look∣ed
at it, about nine Foot deep; but it was said,
they dug it near 20 Foot deep afterwards, in one
Part of it, till they could go no deeper for the Wa∣ter:
for they had it seems, dug several large Pits
before this, for tho' the Plague was long a-com∣ing
to our Parish, yet when it did come, there was
no Parsh in or about <HI>London,</HI> where it raged with
such Violence as in the two Parishes of <HI>Algate</HI> and
<HI>White Chapel.</HI></P>
<P>I say they had dug several Pits in another Ground,
when the Distemper began to spread in our Parish,
and especially when the Dead-Carts began to go
about, which, was not in our Parish, till the be∣ginning
of <HI>August.</HI> Into these Pits they had put
perhaps 50 or 60 Bodies each, then they made
larger Holes, wherein they buried all that the
Cart brought in a Week, which by the middle, to
the End of <HI>August,</HI> came to, from 200 to 400 a
Week; and they could not well dig them larger,
because of the Order of the Magistrates, confining
them to leave no Bodies within six Foot of the
Surface; and the Water coming on, at about 17
or 18 Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they could not well, I say, put more
in one Pit; but now at the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI>
the Plague raging in a dreadful Manner, and the
Number of Burials in our Parish increasing to more
than was ever buried in any Parish about <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
of no larger Extent, they ordered this dreadful
Gulph to be dug; for such it was rather than a Pit.</P>
<P>They had supposed this Pit would have sup∣ply'd
them for a Mouth or more, when they dug
it, and some blam'd the Church Wardens for suf∣fering
such a frightful Thing, telling them they
were making Preparations to bury the whole Pa∣rish,
and the like; but Time made it appear, the
Church-Wardens knew the Condition of the Parish
better than they did; for the Pit being finished the
4th of <HI>September,</HI> I think, they began to bury in it
the 6th, and by the 20, which was just two Weeks
they had thrown into it 1114 Bodies, when they
were obl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged to fill it up, the Bodies being then
come to lie within six Foot of the Surface: I doubt
not but there may be some antient Persons alive in
the Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, who can justify the Fact of this, and are
able to shew even in what Part of the Church-Yard,
the Pit lay, better than I can; the Mark
of it also was many Years to be seen in the Church-Yard
on the Surface lying in Length, Parallel with
the Passage which goes by the West Wall of the
Church-Yard, out of <HI>Houndsditch,</HI> and turns East
again into <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> coming out near the three
Nuns Inn.</P>
<P>It was about the 10th of <HI>September,</HI> that my Cu∣riosity
led, or rather drove me to go and see this
Pit again, when there had been near 400 People
buried in it; and I was not content to see it in
the Day-time, as I had done before; for then there
would have been nothing to have been seen but
the loose Earth; for all the Bodies that were thrown
in, were immediately covered with Earth, by those
they call'd the Buryers, which at other Times were
call'd Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers; but I resolv'd to go in the Night
and see some of them thrown in.</P>
<P>There was a strict Order to prevent People com∣ing
to those Pits, and that was only to prevent
Infection: But after some Time, that Order was
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
more necessary, for People that were Infected, and
near their End, and dilirious also, would run to
those Pits wrapt in Blankers, or Rugs, and throw
themselves in, and as they said, bury themselves: I
cannot say, that the Officers suffered any willingly
to lie there; but I have heard, that in a great
Pit in <HI>Finsbury,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> it lying
open then to the Fields; for it was not then wall'd
about, came and threw themselves in, and ex∣pired
there, before they threw any Earth upon
them; and that when they came to bury others,
and found them there, they were quite dead, tho'
not cold.</P>
<P>This may serve a little to describe the dreadful
Condition of that Day, tho' it is impossible to say
any Thing that is able to give a true Idea of it to
those who did not see it, other than this; that it
was indeed <HI>very, very, very</HI> dreadful, and such as no
Tongue can express.</P>
<P>I got Admittance into the Church-Yard by being
acquainted with the Sexton, who attended, who
tho' he did not refuse me at all, yet earnestly per∣swaded
me not to go; telling me very seriously,
for he was a good religious and sensible Man, that
it was indeed, their Business and Duty to venture,
and to run all Hazards; and that in it they might
hope to be preserv'd; but that I had no apparent
Call to it, but my own Curiosity, which he said,
he believ'd I would not pretend, was sufficient to
justify my running that Hazard. I told him I had
been press'd in my Mind to go, and that perhaps
it might be an Instructing Sight, that might not
be without its Uses. Nay, says the good Man,
if you will venture upon that Score, '<HI>Name of God
go in;</HI> for depend upon it, 'twill be a Sermon to
you, it may be, the best that ever you heard in
your Life. 'Tis a speaking Sight, says he, and
has a Voice with it, and a loud one, to call us all
to Repentance; and with that he opened the Door
and said, Go, if you will.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76"/>
His Discourse had shock'd my Resolution a lit∣tle,
and I stood wavering for a good while; but
just at that Interval I saw two Links come over
from the End of the <HI>Minories,</HI> and heard the Bell∣man,
and then appear'd a Dead-Cart, <HI>as they call'd
it,</HI> coming over the Streets so I could no long∣er
resist my Desire of seeing it, and went in:
There was no Body, as I could perceive at first,
in the Church-Yard, or going into it, but the
Buryers, and the Fellow that drove the Cart,
or rather led the Horse and Cart, but when
they came up, to the Pit, they saw a Man go
to and again, mufled up in a brown Cloak, and
making Motions with his Hands, under his
Cloak, as if he was in a great Agony; and the Bu∣riers
immediately gathered about him, supposing
he was one of those poor dilirious, or desperate
Creatures, that used to pretend, as I have said, to
bury themselves; he said nothing as he walk'd a∣bout,
but two or three times groaned very deeply,
and loud, and sighed as he would break his Heart.</P>
<P>When the Buryers came up to him they soon found
he was neither a Person infected and desperate, as
I have observed above, or a Person distemper∣ed
in Mind, but one oppress'd with a dread∣ful
Weight of Grief indeed, having his Wife and
several of his Children, all in the Cart, that was
just come in with him, and he followed in an Ago∣ny
and excess of Sorrow. He mourned heartily, as
it was easy to see, but with a kind of Masculine
Grief, that could not give it self Vent by Tears,
and calmly desiring the Buriers to let him alone,
said he would only see the Bodies thrown in, and
go away, so they left importuning him; but no soon∣er
was the Cart turned round, and the Bodies shot
into the Pit promiscuously, which was a Surprize to
him, for he at least expected they would have been
decently laid in, tho' indeed he was afterwards
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
convinced that was impractible; I say, no sooner
did he see the Sight, but he cry'd out aloud un∣able
to contain himself; I could not hear what
he said, but he went backward two or three Steps,
and fell down in a Swoon: the Buryers ran to him
and took him up, and in a little While he came to
himself, and they led him away to the <HI>Pye Tavern</HI>
over-against the End of <HI>Houndsditch,</HI> where, it seems,
the Man was known, and where they took care of
him. He look'd into the Pit again, as he went a∣way,
but the Butiers had covered the Bodies so im∣mediately
with throwing in Earth, that tho' there
was Light enough, for there were Lantherns and
Candles in them, plac'd all Night round the Sides
of the Pit, upon the Heaps of Earth, seven or
eight, or perhaps more, yet nothing could be
seen.</P>
<P>This was a mournful Scene indeed, and affected
me almost as much as the rest; but the other was
awful, and full of Terror, the Cart had in it six∣teen
or seventeen Bodies, some were wrapt up in
Linen Sheets, some in Rugs, some little other than
naked, or so loose, that what Covering they had,
fell from them, in the shooting out of the Cart,
and they fell quite naked among the rest; but the
Matter was not much to them, or the Indecency
much to any one else, seeing they were all dead,
and were to be huddled together into the com∣mon
Grave of Mankind, as we may call it, for here
was no Difference made, but Poor and Rich went
together; there was no other way of Burials, nei∣ther
was it possible there should, for Coffins were
not to be had for the prodigious Numbers that fell
in such a Calamity as this.</P>
<P>It was reported by way of Scandal upon the Bu∣riers,
that if any Corpse was delivered to them,
decently wound up as we call'd it then, in a Wind∣ing
Sheet Ty'd over the Head and Feet, which
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
some did, and which was generally of good Linen▪
I say, it was reported, that the Buriers were so
wicked as to strip them in the Cart, and carry
them quite naked to the Ground: But as I can not
easily credit any thing so vile among Christians,
and at a Time so fill'd with Terrors, as that was,
I can only relate it and leave it undetermined.</P>
<P>Innumerable Stories also went about of the cruel
Behaviours and Practises of Nurses, who tended the
Sick, and of their hastening on the Fate of those
they tended in their Sickness: But I shall say more
of this in its Place.</P>
<P>I was indeed shock'd with this Sight, it almost
overwhelm'd me, and I went away with my Heart
most afflicted and full of the afflicting Thoughts,
such as I cannot describe; just at my going out of
the Church, and turning up the Street towards my
own House, I saw another Cart with Links, and
a Bellman going before, coming out of <HI>Harrow-Alley,</HI>
in the <HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> on the other Side of the
Way, and being, as I perceived, very full of dead
Bodies, it went directly over the Street also toward
the Church: I stood a while, but I had no Sto∣mach
to go back again to see the same dismal
Scene over again, so I went directly Home, where
I could not but consider with Thankfulness, the
Risque I had run, believing I had gotten no In∣jury;
as indeed I had not.</P>
<P>Here the poor unhappy Gentleman's Grief came
into my head again, and indeed I could not but
shed Tears in the Reflection upon it, perhaps mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
than he did himself; but his Case lay so heavy
upon my Mind, that I could not prevail with my
self, but that I must go out again into the Street,
and go to the <HI>Pye-Taver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> resolving to enquir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
what became of him.</P>
<P>It was by this Time one a-Clock in the Morn∣ing,
and yet the poor Gentleman was there; the
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
Truth was, the People of the House knowing him,
had entertain'd him, and kept him there all the
Night, notwithstanding the Danger of being infe∣cted,
by him, tho' it appear'd the Man was per∣fectly
sound h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mself.</P>
<P>It is with Regret, that I take Notice of this
Tavern; the People were civil, mannerly, and an
obliging Sort of Folks enough, and had till this
Time kept their House open, and their Trade go∣ing
on, tho' not so very publickly as formerly; but
there was a dreadful Set of Fellows that used their
House, and who in the middle of all this Horror
met there every Night, behaved with all the Re∣velling
and roaring extravagances, as is usual for
such People to do at other Times, and indeed to
such an offensive Degree, that the very Master and
Mistress of the House grew first asham'd and then
terrify'd at them.</P>
<P>They sat generally, in a Room next the Street,
and as they always kept late Hours, so when the
Dead-Cart came cross the Street End to go into
<HI>Hounds-ditch,</HI> which was in View of the Tavern
Windows; they would frequently open the Win∣dows
as soon as they heard the Bell, and look out
at them; and as they might often hear sad Lamen∣tations
of People in the Streets, or at their Win∣dows,
as the Carts went along, they would make
their inpudent Mocks and Jeers at them, especially
if they heard the poor People call upon God to
have Mercy upon them, as many would do at those
Times in their ordinary passing along the Streets.</P>
<P>These Gentlemen being something disturb'd with
the Clutter of bringing the poor Gentleman into
the House, as above, were first angry, and very
high with the Master of the House, for suffering
such a Fellow, as they call'd him, to be brought
out of the Grave into their House; but being an∣swered,
that the Man was a Neighbour, and that
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
he was sound, but overwhelmed with the Cala∣mity
of his Family, and the like, they turned their
Anger into ridiculing the Man, and his Sorrow for
his Wife and Children; taunted him with want
of Courage to leap into the great Pit, and go to
Heaven, as they jeetingly express'd it, along with
them, adding some very profane, and even blasphe∣mous
Expressions.</P>
<P>They were at this vile Work when I came back
to the House, and as far as I could see, tho' the
Man sat still, mute and disconsolate, and their
Affronts could not divert his Sorrow, yet he was
both griev'd and offended at their Discourse: Upon
this, I gently reprov'd them, being well enough ac∣quainted
with their Characters, and not unknown
in Person to two of them.</P>
<P>They immediately fell upon me with ill Language
and Oaths; ask'd me what I did out of my Grave,
at such a Time when so many <HI>honester Men</HI> were
carried into the Church-Yard? and why I was not
at Home saying my Prayers, against the Dead-Cart
came for me? and the like.</P>
<P>I was indeed astonished at the Impudence of the
Men, tho' not at all discomposed at their Treat∣ment
of me; however I kept my Temper; I told
them, that tho' I defy'd them, or any Man in the
World to tax me with any <HI>Dishonesty,</HI> yet I acknow∣ledg'd,
that in this terrible Judgment of God, ma∣ny
better than I was swept away, and carried to
their Grave: But to answer their Question directly,
the Case was, that I was mercifully preserved by
that great God, whose Name they had Blasphem∣ed
and taken in vain, by cursing and swearing in a
dreadful Manner; and that I believed I was pre∣serv'd
in particular, among other Ends, of his
Goodness, that I might reprove them for their au∣dacious
Boldness, in behaving in sucha Manner, and
in such an awful Time as this was, especially, for
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
their Jeering and Mocking, at an honest Gentleman,
and a Neighbour, for some of them knew him, who
they saw was overwhelm'd with Sorrow, for the
Breaches which it had pleas'd God to make upon
his Family.</P>
<P>I cannot call exactly to Mind the hellish abomi∣nable
Rallery, which was the Return they made to
that Talk of mine, being provoked, it seems, that
I was not at all afraid to be free with them; nor if
I could remember, would I fill my Account with
any of the Words, the horrid Oaths, Curses and
vile Expressions, such, as at that time of the Day,
even the worst and ordinariest People in the Street
would not use; (for except such hardened Crea∣tures
as these, the most wicked wretches that could
be found, had at that Time some Terror upon their
Minds of the Hand of that Power which could
thus, in a Moment destroy them.)</P>
<P>But that which was the worst in all their devil∣lish
Language was, that they were not afraid to
blaspheme God, and talk Atheistically; making a
Jest at my calling the Plague the Hand of God,
mocking, and even laughing at the Word Judgment,
as if the Providence of God had no Concern in the
inflicting such a desolating Stroke; and that the
People calling upon God, as they saw the Carts
carrying away the dead Bodies was all enthusia∣stick,
absurd, and impertinent.</P>
<P>I made them some Reply, such as I thought pro∣per,
but which I found was so far from putting
a Checq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to their horrid Way of speaking, that it
made them rail the more, so that I confess it fill'd
me with Horror, and a kind of Rage, and I came
away, as I told them, lest the Hand of that Judg∣ment
which had visited the whole City should glo∣rify
his Vengeance upon them, and all that were
near them.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82"/>
They received all Reproof with the utmost Con∣tempt,
and made the greatest Mockery that was po∣sible
for them to do at me, giving me all the op∣probrious
insolent Scoffs that they could think of for
preaching to them, <HI>as they call'd it,</HI> which indeed,
grieved me, rather than angred me; and I went a∣way
blessing God, however, in my Mind, that I had
not spar'd them, tho' they had insulted me so much.</P>
<P>They continued this wretched Course, three or
four Day after this, continua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y mocking and jeer∣ing
at all that shew'd themselves religious, or seri∣ous,
or that were any way touch'd with the Sence
of the terrible Judgment of God upon us, and I was
inform'd they flouted in the same Manner, at the
good People, who, notwithstanding the Contagion,
met at the Church, fasted, and prayed to God to
remove his Hand from them.</P>
<P>I say, they continued this dreadful Course three
or four Days, <HI>I think it was no more,</HI> when one of
them, particularly he who ask'd the poor Gentle∣man
<HI>what he did ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Grave?</HI> was struck from
Heaven with the Plague, and died in a most de∣plorable
Manner; and in a Word they were every
one of them carried into the great Pit, which I
have mentioned above, before it was quite fill'd
up, which was not above a Fortnight or thereabout.</P>
<P>These Men were guilty o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many extravagances,
such as one would think, Human Nature should
have trembled at the Though<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of, at such a Time
of general Terror, as was then upon us; and parti∣ticularly
scoffing and mocking at every thing which
they happened to see, that was religious among
the People, especially at their thronging zealously
to the Place of publick Worship, to implore Mercy
from Heaven in such a Time of Distress; and this
Tavern, where they held their Club, being within
View of the Church Door, they had the more par∣ticular
Occasion for their Atheistical profane Mirth.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>
But this began to abate a little with them before
the Accident, which I have related, happened; for
the Infection increased so violently▪ at this Part of the
Town now, that People began to be afraid to come
to the Church, at least such Numbers did not resort
thither as was usual; many of the Clergymen likewise
were Dead▪ and others gone into the Country; for it
really required a steady Courage, and a strong Faith,
for a Man not only to venture being in Town at such
a Time as this, but likewise to venture to come to
Church and perform the Office of a Minister to a
Congregation, of whom he had reason to believe ma∣ny
of them, were actually infected with the Plague▪
and to do this every Day, or twice a Day, as in some
Places was done.</P>
<P>It is true, the People shew'd an extraordinary Zeal
in these religious Exercises, and as the Church Doors
were always open, People would go in single at all
Times, whether the Minister was officiating or no,
and locking themselves into separate Pews, would be
praying to God with great Fervency and Devotion.</P>
<P>Others assembled at Meeting-Houses, every one as
their different Opinions in such Things guided, but all
were promiscuously the Subject of these Mens Drolle∣ry,
especially at the Beginning of the Visitation.</P>
<P>It seems they had been check'd for their open insult∣ing
Religion in this Manner, by several good People
of every perswasion, and that, and the violent raging
of the Infection, I suppose, was the Occasion that
they had abated much of their Rudeness, for some
time before, and were only rous'd by the Spirit of Ri∣baldry,
and Atheism, at the Clamour which was made,
when the Gentleman was first brought in there, and
perhaps, were agitated by the same Devil, when I
took upon me to reprove them; tho' I did it at first
with all the Calmness, Temper, and Good-Manners
that I could, which, for a while, they insulted me
the more for, thinking it had been in fear of their Re∣sentment,
tho' afterwards they found the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84"/>
I went Home indeed, griev'd and afflicted in my
Mind, at the Abominable Wickedness of those Men
not doubting, however, that they would be made
dreadful Examples of God's Justice; for I look'd up∣this
dismal Time to be a particular Season of Divine
Vengeance, and that God would, on this Occasion,
single out the proper Objects, of his Displeasure, in a
more especial and remarkable Manner, than at ano∣ther
Time; and that, tho' I did believe that many good
People would, and did, fall in the common Calami∣ty,
and that it was no certain Rule to judge of the
eternal State of any one, by their being distinguish'd in
such a Time of general Destruction, neither one Way
or other; yet I say, it could not but seem reasonable
to believe, that God would not think fit to spare by
his Mercy such open declared Enemies, that should
insult his Name and Being, defy his Vengeance, and
mock at his Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip and Worshipers, at such a Time,
no not tho' his Mercy had thought fit to bear with,
and spare them at other Times: That this was a Day
of Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itation; a Day of God's Anger; and those
Words came into my Thought. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. v. 9. Shall I not
visit for these things, saith the Lord, and shall not my
Soul be avenged of such a Nation as this?</HI></P>
<P>These Things, I say, lay upon my Mind; and I
went home very much griev'd and oppress'd with the
Horror of these Mens Wickedness, and to think that
any thing could be so vile, so hardened, and so noto∣riously
wicked, as to insult God and his Servants,
and his Worship, in such a Manner, and at such a
Time as this was; when he had, as it were, his Sword
drawn in his Hand, on purpose to take Vengeance,
not on them only, but on the whole Nation.</P>
<P>I had indeed, been in some Passion, at first, with
them, tho' it was really raised, not by any Affront
they had offered me personally, but by the Horror
the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r blaspheming Tongues fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d me with; however,
I was doubtful in my Thoughts, whether the Resent∣ment
I retain'd was not all upon my own private Ac∣count,
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
for they had given me a great deal of ill Lan∣guage
too▪ I mean Personally; but after some Pause,
and having a Weight of Grief upon my Mind, I re∣tir'd
my self, as soon as I came home, for I slept not
that Night, and giving God most humble Thanks for
my Preservation in the eminent Danger I had been in,
I set my Mind serioully, and with the utmost Earnest∣ness,
to pray for those desparate Wretches, that God
would pardon them, open their Eyes, and effectually
humble them.</P>
<P>By this I not only did my Duty, namely, to pray
for those who dispitefully used me, but I fully try'd
my own Heart, to my full Satisfaction; that it was not
fill'd with any Spirit of Resentment as they had of∣ended
me in particular; and I humbly recommend
the Method to all those that would know, or be cer∣tain,
how to distinguish between their real Zeal for
the Honour of God, and the Effects of their private
Passions and Resentment.</P>
<P>But I must go back here to the particular Incidents
which occur to my Thoughts of the Time of the Vi∣sitation,
and particularly, to the Time of their shut∣ting
up Houses, in the first Part of the Sickness; for
before the Sickness was come to its Height, People
had more Room to make their Observations, than
they had afterward: But when it was in the Extre∣mity,
there was no such Thing as Communication
with one another, as before.</P>
<P>During the shutting up of Houses, as I have said,
some Violence was offered to the Watchmen; as to
Soldiers, there were none to be found; the few Guards
which the King then had, which were nothing like
the Number, entertain'd since, were disperss'd, either
at <HI>Oxford</HI> with the Court, or in Quarters in the re∣moter
Parts of the Country; small detatchments ex∣cepted,
who did Duty at the Tower, and at <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
and these but very few; neither am I positive,
that there was any other Guard at the Tower, than
the <HI>Warders,</HI> as they call'd them, who stand at the
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
Gate with Gowns and Caps, the same as the Yeomen
of the Guard; except the ordinary Gunners, who
were 24, and the Officers appointed to look after the
Magazine, who were call'd Armourers: as to Traind-Bands,
there was no Possibility of raising any, neither
if the Lieutenancy, either of <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Middlesex</HI> had
ordered the Drums to beat for the Militia, would
any of the Companies, I believe, have drawn to∣gether,
whatever Risque they had run.</P>
<P>This made the Watchmen be the less regarded, and
perhaps, occasioned the greater Violence to be used
against them; I mention it on this Score, to observe
that the setting Watchmen thus to keep the People in,
was (1st) of all, not effectual, but that the People
broke out, whether by Force or by Stratagem, even
almost as often as they pleas'd: And (2d) that those
that did thus break out, were generally People infect∣ed,
who in their Desperation, running about from one
Place to another, valued not who they injur'd, and
which perhaps, as I have said, might give Birth to
Report, that it was natural to the infected People to
desire to infect others, which Report was really false.</P>
<P>And I know it so well, and in so many several Cases,
that I could give several Relations of good, pious,
and religious People, who, when they have had the Di∣stemper,
have been so far from being forward to infect
others, that they have forbid their own Family to
come near them, in Hopes of their being preserved;
and have even died without seeing their nearest Re∣lations,
lest they should be instrumental to give them
the Distemper, and infect or endanger them: If then
there were Cases wherein the infected People were
careless of the Injury they did to others, this was cer∣tainly
one of them, if not the chief, namely, when
People, who had the Distemper, had broken out from
Houses which were so shut up, and having been driven
to Extremities for Provision, or for Entertainment, had
endeavoured to conceal their Condition, and have been
thereby Instrumental involuntarily to infect others who
have been ignorant and unwary.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87"/>
This is one of the Reasons why I believed them, and
do believe still, that the shutting up Houses thus by
Force, and restraining, or rather imprisoning People in
their own Houses, as is said above, was of little or no
Service in the Whole; nay, I am of Opinion, it was
rather hurtful, having forc'd those desperate People
to wander abroad with the Plague upon them, who
would otherwise have died quietly in their Beds.</P>
<P>I remember one Citizen, who having thus broken
out of his House in <HI>Aldersgate-Street,</HI> or thereabout,
went along the Road to <HI>Islington,</HI> he attempted to have
gone in at the <HI>Angel-Inn,</HI> and after<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>that, at the <HI>White-Horse,</HI>
two Inns known still by the same Signs, but
was refused; after which he came to the <HI>Pyed Bull,</HI>
an Inn also still continuing the same Sign; he asked
them for Lodging for one Night only, pretending to
be going into <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and assuring them of his be∣ing
very sound, and free from the Infection, which al∣so,
at that Time, had not reached much that Way.</P>
<P>They told him they had no Lodging that they could
spare, but one Bed, up in the Garret, and that they
could spare that Bed but for one Night, some Drovers
being expected the next Day with Cattle; so, if he
would accept of that Lodging, he might have it,
which he did; so a Servant was sent up with a Candle
with him, to shew him the Room; he was very well
dress'd, and look'd like a Person not used to lie in a
Garret, and when he came to the Room he fech'd a
deep Sigh, and said to the Servant, I have seldom lain
in such a Lodging as this; however the Servant assur∣ing
him again, that they had no better. Well, says
he, I must make shift; this is a dreadful Time, but it
is but for one Night; so he sat down upon the Bed∣side,
and bad the maid, <HI>I think it was,</HI> fetch him up a
Pint of warm Ale; accordingly the Servant went for
the Ale; but some Hurry in the House, which per∣haps,
employed her otherways, put it out of her
Head; and she went up no more to him.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88"/>
The next Morning seeing no Appearance of the
Gentleman, some Body in the House asked the Ser∣vant
that had shewed him up Stairs, what was be∣come
of him? She started; Alas says she, I never
thought more of him: He bad me carry him some
warm Ale, but I forgot; upon which, not the Maid,
but some other Person, was sent up to see after him,
who coming into the Room found him stark dead,
and almost cold, stretch'd out cross the Bed; his
Cloths were pulled off, his Jaw fallen, his Eyes open
in a most frightful Posture, the Rug of the Bed being
grasped hard in one of his Hands; so that it was plain
he died soon after the Maid left him, and 'tis proba∣ble,
had she gone up with the Ale, she had found him
dead in a few Minutes after he sat down upon the
Bed. The Alarm was great in the House, as any
one may suppose, they having been free from the Di∣stemper,
till that Diaster, which bringing the Infe∣ction
to the House, spread it immediately to other
Houses round about it. I do not remember how ma∣ny
died in the House it self, but I think the Maid
Servant, who went up first with him, fell pre∣sently
ill by the Fright, and several others; for where∣as
there died but two in <HI>Islington</HI> of the Plague the
Week before, there died 17 the Week after, whereof
14 were of the Plague; this was in the Week from
the 11th of <HI>July</HI> to the 18th.</P>
<P>There was one Shift that some Families had, and
that not a few, when their Houses happened to be
infected, <HI>and that was this;</HI> The Families, who in the
first breaking out of the Distemper, fled away in∣to
the Country, and had Retreats among their
Friends, generally found some or other of their Neigh∣bours
or Relations to commit the Charge of those
Houses to, for the Safety of the Goods, and the like.
Some Houses were indeed, entirely lock'd up, the
Doors padlockt, the Windows and Doors having
Deal-Boards nail'd over them, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d only the Inspection
of them committed to the ordinary Watchmen and Pa∣rish
Officers; but these were but few.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89"/>
It was thought that there were not less than
10000 Houses forsaken of the Inhabitants in the
City and Suburbs, including what was in the Out
Parishes, and in Surrey, or the Side of the Water
they call'd <HI>Southwark.</HI> This was besides the Numbers
of Lodgers, and of particular Persons who were
fled out of other Families; so that in all it was com∣puted
that about 200000 People were fled and gone
in all: But of this I shall speak again: But I men∣tion
it here on this Account, namely, that it was a
Rule with those who had thus two Houses in their
Keeping, or Care, that if any Body was taken sick in
a Family, before the Master of the Family let the
Examiners, or any other Officer, know of it, he im∣mediately
would send all the rest of his Family whe∣ther
Children or Servants, as it fell out to be, to such
other House which he had so in Charge, and then
giving Notice of the sick Person to the Examiner,
have a Nurse, or Nurses appointed; and have ano∣ther
Person to be shut up in the House with them
(which many for Money would do) so to take
Charge of the House, in case the Person should die.</P>
<P>This was in many Cases the saving a whole Fa∣mily,
who, if they had been shut up with the sick
Person, would inevitably have perished: But on the
other Hand, this was another of the Inconveniencies
of shutting up Houses; for the Apprehensions and
Terror of being shut up, made many run away with
the rest of the Family, who, tho' it was not publick∣ly
known, and they were not quite sick, had yet
the Distemper upon them; and who by having an
uninterrupted Liberty to go about, but being oblig∣ed
still to conceal their Circumstances, or perhaps
not knowing it themselves, gave the Distemper
to others, and spread the Infection in a dreadful
Manner, as I shall explain farther hereafter.</P>
<P>And here I may be able to make an Observation
or two of my own, which may be of use hereafter to
those, into whose Hands this may come, if they
should ever see the like dreadful Visitation. (1.) The
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
Infection generally came into the Houses of the Ci∣tizens,
by the Means of their Servants, who, they
were obliged to send up and down the Streets for Ne∣cessaries,
that is to say, for Food, or Physick, to Bake-houses,
Brew-houses, Shops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and who going neces∣sarily
thro' the Streets into Shops, Markets, and the
like, it was impossible, but that they should one way
or other, meet with distempered people, who con∣veyed
the fatal Breath into them, and they brought
it Home to the Families, to which they belonged.
(2.) It was a great Mistake, that such a great City
as this had but one Pest-House; for had there been,
instead of one Pest-House <HI>viz.</HI> beyond <HI>Bunhil-Fields,</HI>
where, at most, they could receive, perhaps, 200 or
300 People; I say, had there instead of that one been
several Pest-houses, every one able to contain a thou∣sand
People without lying two in a Bed, or two Beds
in a Room; and had every Master of a Family, as soon
as any Servant especially, had been taken sick in his
House, been obliged to send them to the next Pest-House,
if they were willing, as many were, and had
the Examiners done the like among the poor People,
when any had been stricken with the Infection; I
say, had this been done where the People were wil∣ling,
(not otherwise) and the Houses not been shut,
I am perswaded, and was all the While of that Opi∣nion,
that not so many, by several Thousands, had
died; for it was observed, and I could give several
Instances within the Compass of my own Knowledge,
where a Servant had been taken sick, and the Family
had either Time to send them out, or retire from
the House, and leave the sick Person, <HI>as I have said
above,</HI> they had all been preserved; whereas, when
upon one, or more, sickning in a Family, the House
has been shut up, the whole Family have perished,
and the Bearers been oblig'd to go in to fetch out
the Dead Bodies, none being able to bring them to
the Door; and at last none left to do it.</P>
<P>(2.) This put it out of Question to me, that the Cala∣mity
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
was spread by Infection, that is to say, by some
certain Steams, or Fumes, which the Physicians call
<HI>Effluvia,</HI> by the Breath, or by the Sweat, or by the
Stench of the Sores of the sick Persons, or some other
way, perhaps, beyond even the Reach of the Physi∣cians
themselves, which <HI>Effluvia</HI> affected the Sound,
who come within certain Distances of the Sick, im∣mediately
penetrating the Vital Parts of the said
sound Persons, putting their Blood into an immediate
ferment, and agitating their Spirits to that Degree
which it was found they were agitated; and so those
newly infected Persons communicated it in the same
Manner to others; and this I shall give some Instan∣ces
of, that cannot but convince those who seriously
consider it; and I cannot but with some Wonder,
find some People, now the Contagion is over, talk of
its being an immediate Stroke from Heaven, without
the Agency of Means, having Commission to strike
this and that particular Person, and none other;
which I look upon with Contempt, as the Effect of
manifest Ignorance and Enthusiasim; likewise the
Opinion of others, who talk of infection being car∣ried
on by the Air only, by carrying with it vast
Numbers of Insects, and invisible Creatures, who en∣ter
into the Body with the Breath, or even at the
Pores with the Air, and there generate, or emit most
accute Poisons, or poisonous Ovae, or Eggs, which
mingle themselves with the Blood, and so infect the
Body; a Discourse full of learned Simplicity, and
manifested to be so by universal Experience; but
I shall say more to this Case in its Order.</P>
<P>I must here take farther Notice that Nothing was
more fatal to the Inhabitants of this City, than the
Supine Negligence of the People themselves, who
during the long Notice, or Warning they had of the
Visitation, yet made no Provision for it, by laying
in Store of Provisions, or of other Necessaries; by
which they might have liv'd retir'd, and within
their own Houses, as I have observed, others did,
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
and who were in a great Measure preserv'd by that
Caution; nor were they, after they were a little
hardened to it so shye of conversing with one ano∣ther,
when actually infected, as they were at first,
no tho' they knew it.</P>
<P>I acknowledge I was one of those thoughtless Ones,
that had made so little Provision, that my Servants
were obliged to go out of Doors to buy every Trifle
by Penny and Half-penny, just as before it begun,
even till my Experience shewing me the Folly, I
began to be wiser so late, that I had scarce Time to
store my self sufficient for our common Subsistence
for a Month.</P>
<P>I had in Family only an antient Woman, that
managed the House, a Maid-Servant, two Appren∣tices,
and my self; and the Plague beginning to
encrease about us, I had many sad Thoughts about
what Course I should take, and how I should act;
the many dismal Objects, which happened every∣where
as I went about the Streets, had fill'd my
Mind with a great deal of Horror, for fear of the Di∣stemper
it self, which was indeed, very horrible in
it self, and in some more than in others, the swellings
which were generally in the Neck, or Groin, when
they grew hard, and would not break, grew so pain∣ful,
that it was equal to the most exquisite Tor∣ture;
and some not able to bear the Torment threw
themselves out at Windows, or shot themselves, or
otherwise made themselves away, and I saw several
dismal Objects of that Kind: Others unable to con∣tain
themselves, vented their Pain by incessant
Roarings, and such loud and lamentable Cries were
to be heard as we walk'd along the Streets, that
would Pierce the very Heart to think of, especially
when it was to be considered, that the same dread∣ful
Scourge might be expected every Moment to
seize upon our selves.</P>
<P>I cannot say, but that now I began to faint in
in my Resolutions, my Heart fail'd me very much,
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
and sorely I repented of my Rashness: When I had
been out, and met with such terrible Things as these
I have talked of; I say, I repented my Rashness in
venturing to abide in Town: I wish'd often, that I
had not taken upon me to stay, but had gone away
with my Brother and his Family.</P>
<P>Terrified by those frightful Objects, I would retire
Home sometimes, and resolve to go out no more, and
perhaps, I would keep those Resolutions for three or
four Days, which Time I spent in the most serious
Thankfulness for my Preservation, and the Preser∣vation
of my Family, and the constant Confession of
my Sins, giving my self up to God every Day, and
applying to him with Fasting, Humiliation, and
Meditation: Such intervals as I had, I employed in
reading Books, and in writing down my Memoran∣dums
of what occurred to me every Day, and out of
which, afterwards, I for most of this Work as it
relates to my Observations without Doors: What I
wrote of my private Meditations I reserve for pri∣vate
Use, and desire it may not be made publick on
any Account whatever.</P>
<P>I also wrote other Meditations upon Divine Sub∣jects,
such as occurred to me at that Time, and were
profitable to my self, but not fit for any other View,
and therefore I say no more of that.</P>
<P>I had a very good Friend, a Physician, whose
Name was <HI>Heath,</HI> who I frequently visited during this
dismal Time, and to whose Advice I was very much
oblig'd for many Things which he directed me to
take, by way of preventing the Infection when I
went out, as he found I frequently did, and to hold
in my Mouth when I was in the Streets; he also
came very often to see me, and as he was a good
Christian, as well as a good Physician, his agreeable
Conversation was a very great Support to me in the
worst of this terribe Time.</P>
<P>It was now the Beginning of <HI>August,</HI> and the
Plague grew very violent and terrible in the Place
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
where I liv'd, and Dr. <HI>Heath</HI> coming to visit me, and
finding that I ventured so often out in the Streets,
earnestly perswaded me to lock my self up and my
Family, and not to suffer any of us to go out of
Doors; to keep all our Windows fast, Shutters and
Curtains close, and never to open them; but first.
to make a very strong Smoke in the Room, where the
Window, or Door was to be opened, with Rozen and
Pitch, Brimstone, or Gunpowder, and the like; and
we did this for some Time: But as I had not laid in
a Store of Provision for such a retreat, it was impos∣sible
that we could keep within Doors entirely;
however, I attempted, tho' it was so very late, to
do something towards it; and first, as I had Conve∣nience
both for Brewing and Baking, I went and
bought two Sacks of Meal, and for several Weeks,
having an Oven, we baked all our own Bread; also I
bought Malt, and brew'd as much Beer as all the
Casks I had would hold, and which seem'd enough
to serve my House for five or six Weeks; also I laid in
a Quantity of Salt-butter and <HI>Cheshire</HI> Cheese; but I
had no Flesh-meat, and the Plague raged so violent∣ly
among the Butchers, and Slaughter-Houses, on
the other Side of our Street, where they are known
to dwell in great Numbers, that it was not advis∣able,
so much as to go over the Street among them.</P>
<P>And here I must observe again, that this Necessi∣ty
of going out of our Houses to buy Provisions, was
in a great Measure the Ruin of the whole City, for
the People catch'd the Distemper, on those Occa∣sions,
one of another, and even the Provisions them∣selves
were often tainted, at least I have great Rea∣son
to believe so; and therefore I cannot say with
Satisfaction what I know is repeated with great As∣surance,
that the Market People, and such as brought
Provisions, to Town, were never infected: I am cer∣tain,
the Butchers of <HI>White-Chapel</HI> where the greatest
Part of the Flesh-meat was killed, were dreadfully
visited, and that at last to such a Degree, that few
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
of their Shops were kept open, and those that re∣main'd
of them, kill'd their Meat at <HI>Mile-End,</HI> and
that Way, and brought it to Market upon Horses.</P>
<P>However, the poor People cou'd not lay up Provi∣sions,
and there was a necessity, that they must go
to Market to buy, and others to send Servants or their
Children; and as this was a Necessity which re∣new'd
it self daily; it brought abundance of un∣sound
People to the Markets, and a great many
that went thither Sound, brought Death Home with
them.</P>
<P>It is true, People us'd all possible Precaution,
when any one bought a Joint of Meat in the Market,
they would not take it of the Butchers Hand, but
take it off of the Hooks themselves. On the other
Hand, the Butcher would not touch the Money,
but have it put into a Pot full of Vinegar which he
kept for that purpose. The Buyer carry'd always
small Money to make up any odd Sum, that they
might take no Change. They carry'd Bottles for
Scents, and Perfumes in their Hands, and all the
Means that could be us'd, were us'd: But then the
Poor cou'd not do even these things, and they went
at all Hazards.</P>
<P>Innumerable dismal Stories we heard every Day
on this very Account: Sometimes a Man or Wo∣man
dropt down Dead in the very Markets; for ma∣ny
People that had the Plague upon them, knew no∣thing
of it; till the inward Gangreen had affected
their Vitals and they dy'd in a few Moments;
this caus'd, that many died frequently in that Man∣ner
in the Streets suddainly, without any warning:
Others perhaps had Time to go to the next Bulk or
Stall; or to any Door, Porch, and just sit down and
die, as I have said before.</P>
<P>These Objects were so frequent in the Streets,
that when the Plague came to be very raging, On
one Side, there was scarce any passing by the Streets,
but that several dead Bodies would be lying here
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
and there upon the Ground; on the other hand it is ob∣servable,
that tho' at first, the People would stop as they
went along, and call to the Neighbours to come out on
such an Occasion; yet, afterward, no Notice was ta∣ken
of them; but that, if at any Time we found a Corps
lying, go cross the Way, and not come near it; or
if in a narrow Lane or Passage, go back again, and
seek some other Way to go on the Business we were
upon; and in those Cases, the Corps was always left,
till the Officers had notice, to come and take them
away; or till Night, when the Bearers attending the
Dead-Cart would take them up, and carry them a∣way:
Nor did those undaunted Creatures, who per∣formed
these Offices, fail to search their Pockets,
and sometimes strip off their Cloths, if they were
well drest, as sometimes they were, and carry off
what they could get.</P>
<P>But to return to the Markets; the Butchers took
that Care, that if any Person dy'd in the Market, they
had the Officers always at Hand, to take them up
upon Hand-barrows, and carry them to the next
Church-Yard; and this was so frequent that such
were not entred in the weekly Bill, found Dead in the
Streets or Fields, as is the Case now; but they went
into the general Articles of the great Distemper.</P>
<P>But now the Fury of the Distemper encreased to
such a Degree, that even the Markets were but very
thinly furnished with Provisions, or frequented with
Buyers, compair'd to what they were before; and
the Lord-Mayor caused the Country-People who
brought Provisions, to be stop'd in the Streets lead∣ing
into the Town, and to sit down there with their
Goods, where they sold what they brought, and
went immediately away; and this Encourag'd the
Country People greatly to do so, for they sold their
Provisions at the very Entrances into the Town,
and even in the Fields; as particularly in the Fields
beyond <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> in <HI>Spittle-fields.</HI> Note, <HI>Those
Streets now called</HI> Spittle-Fields, <HI>were then indeed open
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
Fields:</HI> Also in St. <HI>George's-fields</HI> in <HI>Southwork,</HI> in <HI>Bun-Hill</HI>
Fields, and in a great Field, call'd <HI>Wood's-Close</HI>
near <HI>Islington;</HI> thither the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen,
and Magistrates, sent their Officers and Servants to
buy for their Families, themselves keeping within
Doors as much as possible; and the like did many
other People; and after this Method was taken, the
Country People came with great chearfulness, and
brought Provisions of all Sorts, and very seldom got
any harm; which I suppose, added also to that Re∣port
of their being Miraculously preserv'd.</P>
<P>As for my little Family, having thus as I have
said, laid in a Store of Bread, Butter, Cheese, and
Beer, I took my Friend and Physician's Advice, and
lock'd my self up, and my Family, and resolv'd to
suffer the hardship of Living a few Mouths without
Flesh-Meat, rather than to purchase it at the ha∣zard
of our Lives.</P>
<P>But tho' I confin'd my Family, I could not prevail
upon my unsatisfy'd Curiosity to stay within entirely
my self; and tho' I generally came frighted and ter∣rified
Home, yet I cou'd not restrain; only that in∣deed,
I did not do it so frequently as at first.</P>
<P>I had some little Obligations indeed upon me, to
go to my Brothers House, which was in <HI>Coleman's-street</HI>
Parish, and which he had left to my Care, and
I went at first every Day, but afterwards only once,
or twice a Week.</P>
<P>In these Walks I had many dismal Scenes before
my Eyes, as particularly of Persons falling dead in the
Streets, terrible Shrieks and Skreekings of Women,
who in their Agonies would throw open their Cham∣ber
Windows, and cry out in a dismal Surprising
Manner; it is impossible to describe the Variety of
Postures, in which the Passions of the Poor People
would Express themselves.</P>
<P>Passing thro' <HI>Token-House-Yard</HI> in <HI>Lothbury,</HI> of a
sudden a Casement violently opened just over my
Head, and a Woman gave three frightful Skreetches,
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
and then cry'd, <HI>Oh! Death, Death, Death!</HI> in a most
inimitable Tone, and which struck me with Horror
and a Chilness, in my very Blood. There was no
Body to be seen in the whole Street, neither did
any other Window open; for People had no Curio∣sity
now in any Case; nor could any Body help one
another; so I went on to pass into <HI>Bell-Alley.</HI></P>
<P>Just in <HI>Bell-Alley,</HI> on the right Hand of the Pas∣sage,
there was a more terrible Cry than that, tho'
it was not so directed out at the Window, but the
whole Family was in a terrible Fright, and I could
hear Women and Children run skreaming about the
Rooms like distracted, when a Garret Window open∣ed,
and some body from a Window on the other Side
the Alley, call'd and ask'd, <HI>What is the Matter?</HI> up∣on
which, from the first Window it was answered,
<HI>O Lord, my Old Master has hang'd himself!</HI> The other
ask'd again, <HI>Is he quite dead?</HI> and the first answer'd,
<HI>Ay, ay, quite dead; quite dead and cold!</HI> This Person
was a Merchant, and a Deputy Alderman and very
rich. I care not to mention the Name, tho' I knew
his Name too, but that would be an Hardship to
the Family, which is now flourishing again.</P>
<P>But, this is but one; it is scarce credible what
dreadful Cases happened in particular Families eve∣ry
Day; People in the Rage of the Distemper, or
in the Torment of their Swellings, which was indeed
intollerable, running out of their own Government,
raving and distracted, and oftentimes laying vio∣lent
Hands upon themselves, throwing themselves
out at their Windows, shooting themselves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mo∣thers
murthering their own Children, in their Luna∣cy,
some dying of meer Grief as a Passion, some of
meer Fright and Surprize, without any Infection at
all; others frighted into Idiotism, and foolish Di∣stractions,
some into dispair and Lunacy; others in∣to
mellancholy Madness.</P>
<P>The Pain of the Swelling was in particular very
violent, and to some intollerable; the Physicians
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
and Surgeons may be said to have tortured ma∣ny
poor Creatures, even to Death. The Swell∣lings
in some grew hard, and they apply'd violent
drawing Plasters, or Pultices, to break them; and
if these did not do, they cut and scarified them in a
terrible Manner: In some, those Swellings were
made hard, partly by the Force of the Distemper,
and partly by their being too violently drawn, and
were so hard, that no Instrument could cut them,
and then they burnt them with Causticks, so that
many died raving mad with the Torment; and
some in the very Operation. In these Distresses,
some for want of Help to hold them down in their
Beds, or to look to them, laid Hands upon them∣selves,
as above. Some broke out into the Streets,
perhaps naked, and would run directly down to
the River, if they were not stopt by the Watchmen,
or other Officers, and plunge themselves into the
Water, wherever they found it.</P>
<P>It often pierc'd my very Soul to hear the Groans
and Crys of those who were thus tormented, but of
the Two, this was counted the most promising Parti∣cular
in the whole Infection; for, if these Swellings
could be brought to a Head, and to break and run,
or as the Surgeons call it, to digest, the Patient ge∣nerally
recover'd; whereas those, who like the Gen∣tlewoman's
Daughter, were struck with Death at
the Beginning, and had the Tokens come out upon
them, often went about indifferent easy, till a lit∣tle
before they died, and some till the Moment they
dropt down, as in Appoplexies and Epelepsies, is of∣ten
the Case; such would be taken suddenly ve∣ry
sick, and would run to a Bench or Bulk, or any
convenient Place that offer'd it self, or to their own
Houses, if possible, <HI>as I mentioned before▪</HI> and there
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it down, grow faint and die. This kind of dying was
much the same, as it was with those who die of com∣mon
Mortifications, who die swooning, and as it
were, go away in a Dream; such as died thus, had
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
very little Notice of their being infected at all, till
the Gangreen was spread thro' their whole Body;
nor could Physicians themselves, know certainly
how it was with them, till they opened their Breasts,
or other Parts of their Body, and saw the Tokens.</P>
<P>We had at this Time a great many frightful Sto∣ries
told us of Nurses and Watchmen, who looked
after the dying People, <HI>that is to say,</HI> hir'd Nurses,
who attended infected People, using them barbarous∣ly,
starving them smothering them, or by other
wicked Means, hastening their End, <HI>that is to say,</HI>
murthering of them: And Watchmen being set
to guard Houses that were shut up, when there has
been but one person left, and perhaps, that one ly∣ing
sick, that they have broke in and murthered
that Body, and immediately thrown them out into
the Dead-Cart! and so they have gone scarce cold
to the Grave.</P>
<P>I cannot say, but that some such Murthers were
committed, and I think two were sent to Prison for
it, but died before they could be try'd; and I have
heard that three others, at several Times, were ex∣cused
for Murthers of that kind; but I must say I
believe nothing of its being so common a Crime, as
some have since been pleas'd to say, nor did it seem
to be so rational, where the People were brought so
low as not to be able to help themselves, for such
seldom recovered, and there was no Temptation to
commit a Murder, at least, none equal to the Fact
where they were sure Persons would die in so short
a Time; and could not live.</P>
<P>That there were a great many Robberies and
wicked Practises committed even in this dreadful
Time I do not deny; the Power of Avarice was so
strong in some, that they would run any Hazard to
steal and to plunder, and particularly in Houses
where all the Families, or Inhabitants have been
dead, and carried out, they would break in at all
Hazards, and without Regard to the Danger of In∣fection,
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
take even the Cloths off, of the dead Bodies,
and the Bed-cloaths from others where they lay dead.</P>
<P>This, <HI>I suppose,</HI> must be the Case of a Family in
<HI>Houndsditch,</HI> where a Man and his Daughter, <HI>the
rest of the Family being, as I suppose, carried away be∣fore
by the Dead-Cart,</HI> were found stark naked, one
in one Chamber, and one in another, lying Dead on
the Floor; and the Cloths of the Beds, from whence,
tis supposed they were roll'd off by Thieves, stoln,
and carried quite away.</P>
<P>It is indeed to be observ'd, that the Women were
in all this Calamity, the most rash, fearless, and des∣perate
Creatures; and as there were vast Numbers
that went about as Nurses, to tend those that were
sick, they committed a great many petty Thieve∣ries
in the Houses where they were employed; and
some of them were publickly whipt for it, when
perhaps, they ought rather to have been hanged
for Examples; for Numbers of Houses were robbed
on these Occasions, till at length, the Parish Of∣ficers
were sent to recommend Nurses to the Sick,
and always took an Account who it was they sent,
so as that they might call them to account, if the
House had been abused where they were placed.</P>
<P>But these Robberies extended chiefly to Wearing-Cloths,
Linen, and what Rings, or Money they could
come at, when the Person dyed who was under their
Care, but not to a general Plunder of the Houses;
and I could give an Account of one of these Nurses,
who several Years after, being on her Death-bed,
confest with the utmost Horror, the Robberries she
had committed at the Time of her being a Nurse,
and by which she had enriched her self to a great
Degree: But as for murthers, I do not find that
there was ever any Proof of the Facts, in the man∣ner,
as it has been reported, <HI>except as above.</HI></P>
<P>They did tell me indeed of a Nurse in one
place, that laid a wet Cloth upon the Face of a dy∣ing
Patient, who she tended, and so put an End
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
to his Life, who was just expiring before: And another
that smother'd a young Woman she was looking to,
when she was in a fainting fit, and would have come
to her self: Some that kill'd them by giving them
one Thing, some another, and some starved them by
giving them nothing at all: But these Stories had two
Marks of Suspicion that always attended them, which
caused me always to slight them, and to look on them
as meer Stories, that People continually frighted one
another with. (1.) That wherever it was that we
heard it, they always placed the Scene at the far∣ther
End of the Town, opposite, or most remote
from where you were to hear it: If you heard it in
<HI>White-Chapel,</HI> it had happened at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, or at
<HI>Westminster,</HI> or <HI>Holborn,</HI> or that End of the Town;
if you heard of it at that End of the Town, then
it was done in <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> or the <HI>Minories,</HI> or about
<HI>Cripplegate</HI> Parish: If you heard of it in the City,
why, then it had happened in <HI>Southwark;</HI> and if you
heard of it in <HI>Southwark,</HI> then it was done in the City,
and the like.</P>
<P>In the next Place, of what Part soever you heard
the Story, the Particulars were always the same, espe∣cially
that of laying a wet double Clout<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on a dying
Man's Face, and that of smothering a young Gentle∣woman;
so that it was apparent, at least to my Judg∣ment,
that there was more of Tale than of Truth in
those Things.</P>
<P>However, I cannot say, but it had some Effect up∣on
the People, and particnlarly that, <HI>as I said be∣fore,</HI>
they grew more cautious who they took into
their Houses, and who they trusted their Lives with;
and had them always recommended, if they could;
and where they could not find such, for they were
not very plenty, they applied to the Parish Of∣ficers.</P>
<P>But here again, the Misery of that Time lay upo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Poor, who being infected, had neither Food o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Physick; neither Physician or Appothecary to assis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
them, or Nurse to attend them: Many of those died
calling for help, and even for Sustenance out at their
Windows, in a most miserable and deplorable man∣ner;
but it must be added, that when ever the Ca∣ses
of such Persons or Families, were represented to
my Lord-Mayor, they always were reliev'd.</P>
<P>It is true, in some Houses where the People were
not very poor; yet, where they had sent perhaps
their Wives and Children away; and if they had any
Servants, they had been dismist; <HI>I say it is true, that</HI>
to save the Expences, many such as these shut
themselves in, and not having Help, dy'd alone.</P>
<P>A Neighbour and Acquaintance of mine, having
some Money owing to him from a Shopkeeper in
<HI>White-Cross-street,</HI> or there abouts, sent his Appren∣tice,
a youth about 18 Years of Age, to endeavour
to get the Money: He came to the Door, and find∣ing
it shut, knockt pretty hard, and as he thought,
heard some Body answer within, but was not sure,
So he waited, and after some stay knockt again, and
then a third Time, when he heard some Body com∣ing
down Stairs.</P>
<P>At length the Man of the House came to the Door;
he had on his Breeches or Drawers, and a yellow
Flannel Wastcoat; no Stockings, a pair of Slipt-Shoes,
a white Cap on his head; and as the young Man
said, Death in his Face.</P>
<P>When he open'd the Door, says he, <HI>what do you
disturb me thus for?</HI> the Boy, tho' a little surpriz'd, re∣ply'd,
<HI>I come from such a one, and my Master sent me
for the Money, which he says you know of: Very well
Child,</HI> returns the living Ghost, <HI>call as you go by at</HI>
Cripplegate <HI>Church, and bid them ring the Bell,</HI> and with
those Words, shut the Door again, and went up a∣gain
and Dy'd, The same Day; nay, perhaps the
same Hour. This, the young Man told me himself,
and I have Reason to believe it. This was while
the Plague was not come to a Height: I think it
was in <HI>June;</HI> Towards the latter End of the Month,
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
it must be before the Dead Carts came about, and
while they used the Ceremony of Ringing the Bell
for the Dead, which was over for certain, in that Pa∣rish
at least, before the Month of <HI>July;</HI> for by the
25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> there died 550 and upward in a Week,
and then they cou'd no more bury in Form, Rich or
Poor.</P>
<P>I have mention'd above, that notwithstanding this
dreadful Calamity; yet the Numbers of Thieves
were abroad upon all Occasions, where they had
found any Prey; and that these were generally Wo∣men.
It was one Morning about 11 a Clock, I
had walk'd out to my Brothers House in <HI>Coleman's-street</HI>
Parish, as I often did, to see that all was Safe.</P>
<P>My Brother's House had a little Court be∣fore
it, and a Brick-Wall with a Gate in it; and
within that, several Ware-houses, where his Goods
of several Sorts lay: It happen'd, that in one of these
Ware-houses, were several Packs of Womens high-Crown'd
Hats, which came out of the Country; and
were, as I suppose, for Exportation; whither I know
not.</P>
<P>I was surpriz'd that when I came near my Brother's
Door, which was in a Place they call'd <HI>Swan-Alley,</HI>
I met three or four Women with High-crown'd Hats
on their Heads; and as I remembred afterwards,
one, if not more, had some Hats likewise in their
Hands: but as I did not see them come out at my
Brother's Door, and not knowing that my Brother
had any such Goods in his Ware-house, I did not
offer to say any Thing to them, but went cross the
Way to shun meeting them, as was usual to do at
that Time, for fear of the Plague. But when I came
nearer to the Gate, I met another Woman with
more Hats come out of the Gate. <HI>What Business
Mistress,</HI> said I, <HI>have you had there?</HI> There are more
People there, said she, I have had no more Busi∣ness
there than they. I was hasty to get to the Gate
then, and said no more to her; by which means she
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
got away. But just as I came to the Gate, I
saw two more coming cross the Yard to come out
with Hats also on their Heads, and under their
Arms; at which I threw the Gate too behind me,
which having a Spring Lock fastened it self; and
turning to the Women, forsooth said I, what are
ye <HI>doing here?</HI> and seiz'd upon the Hats, and took
them from them. One of them, who I confess,
did not look like a Thief. Indeed says she, we are
wrong; but we were told, they were Goods that
had no Owner; be pleas'd to take them again, and
look yonder, there are more such Customers as we:
She cry'd and look'd pitifully; so I took the Hats
from her, and opened the Gate, and bad them be
gone, for I pity'd the Women indeed; But when I
look'd towards the Ware-house, as she directed,
there were six or seven more all, Women, fitting them∣selves
with Hats, as unconcerned and quiet, as if
they had been at a Hatters Shop, buying for their
Money.</P>
<P>I was surpriz'd, not at the Sight of so many Thieves
only, but at the Circumstances I was in; being now
to thrust my self in among so many People, who for
some Weeks, had been so shye of my self, that if I met
any Body in the Street, I would cross the Way
from them.</P>
<P>They were equally surpriz'd, tho' on another Ac∣count:
They all told me, they were Neighbours,
that they had heard any one might take them, that
they were no Bodies Goods, and the like. I talk't
big to them at first; went back to the Gate, and
took out the Key; so that they were all my Priso∣ners;
threaten'd to Lock them all into the Ware-house,
and go and fetch my Lord Mayor's Officers
for them.</P>
<P>They beg'd heartily, protested they found the
Gate open, and the Ware-house Door open; and
that it had no doubt been broken open by some,
who expected to find Goods of greater Value;
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
which indeed, was reasonable to believe, because the
Lock was broke, and a Padlock that hung to the
Door on the out-side also loose; and not abundance
of the Hats carry'd away.</P>
<P>At length I consider'd, that this was not a Time
to be Cruel and Rigorous; and besides that, it
would necessarily oblige me to go much about, to
have several People come to me, and I go to several,
whose Circumstances of Health, I knew nothing of;
and that even, at this Time the Plague was so high,
as that there dy'd 4000 a Week; so that in showing
my Resentment, or even in seeking Justice for my
Brother's Goods, I might lose my own Life; so I
contented my self, with taking the Names and Places
where some of them lived, who were really Inhabi∣tants
in the Neighbourhood; and threatning that
my Brother should call them to an Account for it,
when he return'd to his Habitation.</P>
<P>Then I talk'd a little upon another Foot with
them; and ask'd them how they could do such Things
as these, in a Time of such general Calamity; and
as it were, in the Face of Gods most dreadful Judg∣ments,
when the Plague was at their very Doors;
and it may be in their very Houses; and they did not
know, but that the Dead-Cart might stop at their
Doors in a few Hours, to carry them to their Graves.</P>
<P>I cou'd not perceive that my Discourse made much
Impression upon them all that while; till it happened,
that there came two Men of the Neighbourhood,
hearing of the Disturbance, and knowing my Brother,
for they had been both dependants upon his Family,
and they came to my Assistance: These being as I
said Neighbours, presently knew three of the Wo∣men,
and told me who they were, and where they
liv'd; and it seems, they had given me a true Account
of themselves before.</P>
<P>This brings these two Men to a farther Remem∣brance:
The Name of one was <HI>John Hayward,</HI> who
was at that Time under-Sexton, of the Parish of St.
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
<HI>Stephen Coleman-street;</HI> by under Sexton, was under∣stood
at that Time Grave-digger and Bearer of the
Dead. This Man carry'd or assisted to carry
all the Dead to their Graves, which were bury'd
in that large parish, and who were carried in Form;
and after that Form of Burying was stopt, went with
the Dead Cart and the Bell, to fetch the dead Bodies
from the Houses where they lay, and fetch'd many
of them out of the Chambers and Houses; for the
Parish was, and is still remarkable, particularly above
all the Parishes in <HI>London,</HI> for a great Number of Al∣leys,
and Thorough fares very long, into which no Carts
cou'd come, and where they were oblig'd to go and
fetch the Bodies a very long Way; which Alleys now
remain to Witness it; such as <HI>Whites-Alley, Cross-Key-Court,
Swan-Alley, Bell-Alley, White-Horse-Alley,</HI> and
many more: Here they went with a kind of Hand-Barrow,
and lay'd the Dead Bodies on it, and car∣ry'd
them out to the Carts; which work he perform∣ed,
and never had the Distemper at all, but liv'd
above 20 Year after it, and was Sexton of the Parish
to the Time of his Death. His Wife at the same, time
was a Nurse to infected People, and tended many
that died in the Parish, being for her honesty recom∣mended
by the Parish Officers, yet she never was in∣fected
neither.</P>
<P>He never used any Preservative against the Infecti∣on,
other than holding <HI>Garlick</HI> and <HI>Rue</HI> in his Mouth,
and smoaking Tobacco; this I also had from his
own Mouth; and his Wife's Remedy was washing
her Head in Vinegar, and sprinkling her Head-Cloths
so with Vinegar, as to keep them always Moist; and
if the smell of any of those she waitd on was more
than ordinary Offensive, she snuft Vinegar up her
Nose, and sprinkled Vinegar upon her Head-Cloths,
and held a Handkerchief weted with Vinegar to her
Mouth.</P>
<P>It must be confest, that tho' the Plague was chief∣ly
among the Poor; yet, were the Poor the most
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
Venturous and Fearless of it, and went about their
Employment, with a Sort of brutal Courage; I must
call it so, for it was founded neither on Religion or
Prudence; scarse did they use any Caution, but run
into any Business, which they conld get Employment
in, tho' it was the most hazardous; such was that of
tending the Sick, watching Houses shut up, carrying
infected Persons to the Pest-House; and which was
still worse, carrying the Dead away to their Graves.</P>
<P>It was under this <HI>John Hayward's</HI> Care, and within
his Bounds, that the Story of the Piper, with which
People have made themselves so merry, happen'd, and
he assur'd me that it was true. It is said, that it was
a blind Piper; but as <HI>John</HI> told me, the Fellow was
not blind, but an ignorant weak poor Man, and usual∣ly
walked his Rounds about 10 a Clock at Night,
and went piping along from Door to Door, and the
People usually took him in at Public Houses where
they knew him, and would give him Drink and Vict∣uals,
and sometimes Farthings; and he in Return,
would Pipe and Sing, and talk simply, which divert∣ed
the People, and thus he liv'd: It was but a very
bad Time for this Diversion, while Things were as
I have told; yet the poor Fellow went about as usual,
but was almost starv'd; and when any Body ask'd
how he did, he would answer, the Dead Cart had
not taken him yet, but that they had promised to call
for him next Week.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Night, that this poor Fellow, whe∣whether
some body had given him too much Drink or
no, <HI>John Hayward</HI> said, he had not Drink in his
House; but that they had given him a little more Vict∣uals
than ordinary at a Public House in <HI>Coleman-street;</HI>
and the poor Fellow having not usually had a Belly∣full,
or perhaps not a good while, was laid all along
upon the Top of a Bulk or Stall, and fast a sleep at a
Door, in the Street near <HI>London-Wall,</HI> towards Cripple¦gate,
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
and that upon the same Bulk or Stall, the Peo∣ple
of some House, in the Alley of which the House
was a Corner, hearing a Bell, which they always
rung before the Cart came, had laid a Body really
dead of the Plague just by him, thinking too, that
this poor Fellow had been a dead Body as the other
was, and laid there by some of the Neighbours.</P>
<P>Accordingly when <HI>John Hayward</HI> with his Bell and
the Cart came along, finding two dead Bodies lie up∣on
the Stall they took them up with the Instrument
they used, and threw them into the Cart; and all
this while the Piper slept soundly.</P>
<P>From hence they passed along, and took in o∣ther
dead Bodies, till, as honest <HI>John Hayward</HI> told
me, they almost burried him alive, in the Cart,
yet all this While he slept soundly; at length the
Cart came to the Place where the Bodies were to be
thrown into the Ground, which, as I do remember,
was at <HI>Mount-mill;</HI> and as the Cart usually stopt some
Time before they were ready to shoot out the melan∣cholly
Load they had in it, as soon as the Cart stop'd,
the Fellow awaked, and struggled a little to get his
Head out from among the dead Bodies, when raising
himself up in the Cart, he called out, <HI>Hey! where am
I?</HI> This frighted the Fellow that attended about the
Work, but after some Pause <HI>John Hayward</HI> recovering
himself said, <HI>Lord bless us. There's some Body in the Cart
not quite dead!</HI> So another call'd to him and said, <HI>Who
are you?</HI> the Fellow answered, <HI>I am the poor Piper.
Where am I? Where are you!</HI> says <HI>Hayward; why, you
are in the Dead-Cart, and we are a-going to bury you. But
I an't dead tho', am I?</HI> says the Piper; which made
them laugh a little, tho' as <HI>John</HI> said, they were hear
tily frighted at first; so they help'd the poor Fellow
down, and he went about his Business.</P>
<P>I know the Story goes, he set up his Pipes in the
Cart, and frighted the Bearers, and others, so that
they ran away; but <HI>John Hayward</HI> did not tell the
Story so, nor say any Thing of his Piping at all; but
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
that he was a poor Piper, and that he was carried
away as above I am fully satisfied of the Truth of.</P>
<P>It is to be noted here, that the Dead Carts in the
City were not not confin'd to particular Parishes, but
one Cart went thro' several Parishes, according as the
Numbers of Dead presented; nor were they ty'd to
carry the Dead to their respective Parishes, but ma∣ny
of the Dead, taken up in the City, were carried
to the Burying Ground in the Out-parts, for want
of Room.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned the Surprize, that this
Judgment was at first among the People, I must
be allowed to give some of my Observations on the
more serious and religious Part. Surely never City,
at least, of this Bulk and Magnitude, was taken in
a Condition so perfectly unprepar'd for such a dread∣ful
Visitation, whether I am to speak of the Civil
Preparations, or Religious; they were indeed, as
if they had had no Warning, no Expectation, no Ap∣prehensions,
and consequently the least Provision ima∣ginable,
was made for it in a publick Way; for Ex∣ample.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs had made no Pro∣vision
as Magistrates, for the Regulations which
were to be observed; they had gone into no Mea∣sures
for Relief of the Poor.</P>
<P>The Citizens had no publick Magazines, or Store-Houses
for Corn, or Meal, for the Subsistence of the
Poor; which, if they had provided themselves, as in
such Cases is done abroad, many miserable Families,
who were now reduc'd to the utmost Distress, would
have been reliev'd, and that in a better Manner, than
now could be done.</P>
<P>The Stock of the City's Money, I can say but little
to, the Chamber of <HI>London</HI> was said to be exceeding
rich; and it may be concluded, that they were so,
by the vast Sums of Money issued from thence, in the
re-building the publick Edifices after the Fire of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and in Building new Works, such as, for the
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
first Part, the <HI>Guild-Hall, Blackwell-Hall,</HI> Part of <HI>Lea∣den
Hall,</HI> Half the <HI>Exchange,</HI> the <HI>Session-House,</HI> the <HI>Comp∣ter;</HI>
the Prisons of <HI>Ludgate, Newgate, &amp;c.</HI> several of the
Wharfs, and Stairs, and Landing-places on the Ri∣ver;
all which were either burnt down or damaged
by the great Fire of <HI>London,</HI> the next Year after the
Plague; and of the second Sort, the Monument, <HI>Fleet∣ditch</HI>
with its Bridges, aud the Hospital of <HI>Bethlem,</HI> or
<HI>Bedlam, &amp;c.</HI> But possibly the Managers of the City's
Credit, at that Time, made more Conscience of break∣ing
in upon the Orphan's Money; to shew Charity
to the distress'd Citizens, than the Managers in the
following Years did, to beautify the City, and re∣edify
the Buildings, tho' in the first Case, the Losers
would have thought their Fortunes better bestow'd,
and the Publick Faith of the City have been less sub∣jected
to Scandal and Reproach.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledg'd that the absent Citizens,
who, tho' they were fled for Safety into the Coun∣try,
were yet greatly interested in the Welfare of those
who they left behind, forgot not to contribute li∣berally
to the Relief of the Poor, and large Sums
were also collected among Trading-Towns in the re∣motest
Parts of of <HI>England;</HI> and as I have heard also,
the Nobility and the Gentry, in all Parts of <HI>England,</HI>
took the deplorable Condition of the City into their
Consideration, and sent up large Sums of Money in
Charity, to the Lord Mayor and Magistrates, for
the Relief of the Poor; the King also, as I was told,
ordered a thousand Pounds a Week to be distribut∣ed
in four Parts; one Quarter to the City and Li∣berties
of <HI>Westminster:</HI> one Quarter, or Part, among
the Inhabitants of the <HI>Southwark</HI> Side of the Water;
one Quarter to the Liberty and Parts within, of the
City, exclusive of the City, within the Walls; and,
one fourth Part to the Suburbs in the County of
<HI>Middlesex,</HI> and the East and North Parts of the Ci∣ty:
But this latter I only speak of as a Report.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112"/>
Certain it is, the greatest Part of the Poor, or Fa∣milies,
who formerly liv'd by their Labour, or by
Retail-Trade, liv'd now on Charity; and had there
not been prodigious Sums of Money given by chari∣table,
well-minded Christians, for the Support of
such, the City could never have subsisted. There
were, no Question, Accounts kept of their Chari∣ty,
and of the just Distribution of it by the Magi∣strates:
But as such Mulitudes of those very Officers
died, thro' whose Hands it was distributed; and al∣so
that, as I have been told, most of the Accounts
of those Things were lost in the great Fire which
happened in the very next Year, and which burnt e∣ven
the Chamberlain's Office, and many of their
Papers; so I could never come at the particular Ac∣count,
which I used great Endeavours to have seen.</P>
<P>It may, however, be a Direction in Case of the
Approach of a like Visitation, which God keep the
City from; I say, it may be of use to observe
that by the Care of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen,
at that Time, in distributing Weekly, great Sums
of Money, for Relief of the Poor, a Multitude of
People, who would otherwise have perished, were
relieved, and their Lives preservd. And here let
me enter into a brief State of the Case of the Poor
at that Time, and what Way apprehended from them,
from whence may be judg'd hereafter, what may be
expected, if the like Distress should come upon the
City.</P>
<P>At the Beginning of the Plague, when there was
now no more Hope, but that the whole City would
be visited, when, as I have said, all that had Friends
or Estates in the Country, retired with their Fami∣lies,
and when, indeed, one would have thought
the very City it self was running out of the Gates,
and that there would be no Body left behind. You
may be sure, from that Hour, all Trade, except such
as related to immediate Subsistence, was, <HI>as it were,</HI>
at a full Stop.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113"/>
This is so lively a Case, and contains in it so much
of the real Condition of the People; that I think,
I cannot be too particular in it; and therefore I descend
to the several Arrangements or Classes of People, who
fell into immediate Distress upon this Occasion: For
Example,</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. All Master Work-men in Manufactures; especially
such as belong'd to Ornament, and the less necessary
Parts of the People dress Cloths and Furniture for Hou∣ses;
such as Riband Weavers, and other Weavers;
Gold and Silverlace-makers, and Gold and Silverwyer∣drawers,
Seemstresses, Milleners, Shoe-makers, Hat-ma∣kers
and Glove-makers: Also Upholdsterers, Joyners, Ca∣binet-makers,
Looking-glass-makers; and innumerable
Trades which depend upon such as these; I say the Ma∣ster
Workmen in such, stopt their Work, dismist their
Journeymen, and Workmen, and all their Dependants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As Merchandizing was at a full stop, for very few Ships
ventur'd to come up the River, and none at all went out; so
all the extraordinary Officers of the Customes, likewise the
Watermen, Carmen, Parters, and all the Poor, whose Labour
depended upon the Merchants, were at once dismist, and
put out of Business.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. All the Tradesmen usually employ'd in building or repare∣ing
of Houses, were at a full Stop, for the People were far
from wanting to build Houses, when so many thousand
Houses were at once stript of their Inhabitants; so that this
one Article turn'd all the ordinary Work-men of that
Kind out of Business; such as Brick-layers, Masons, Car∣penters,
Joyners, Plasterers, Painters, Glaziers, Smiths,
Plumbers; and all the Labourers depending on such.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. As Navigation was at a Stop; our Ships neither coming
in, or going out as before; so the Seamen were all out of Em∣ployment,
and many of them in the last and lowest Degree
of Distress, and with the Seamen, were all the seve∣ral
Tradesmen, and Workmen belonging to and depend∣ing
upon the building, and fitting out of Ships; such as
Ship Carpenters, Caulkers, Rope-makers, Dry-Coopers,
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
Sail-makers, Anchor-Smiths, and other Smiths; Block-makers,
Carvers, Gun Smiths, Ship-Chandlers, Ship-Carvers
and the like; The Masters of those perhaps
might live upon their Substance; but the Traders were
Universally at a Stop, and consequently all their Work∣men
discharged: Add to these, that the River was in a
manner without Boats, and all or most part of the Wa∣termen,
Lightermen, Boat-builders, and Lighter-buil∣ders
in like manner idle, and laid by.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. All Families retrench'd their living as much as possible,
as well those that fled, as those that stay'd; so that an in∣numerable
Multitude of Footmen, serving Men, Shop-keepers,
Journey-men, Merchants-Book-keepers, and
such Sort of People, and especially poor Maid Servants
were turn'd off, and left Friendless and Helpless without
Employment, and without Habitation; and this was
really a dismal Article.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>I might be more particular as to this Part: But
it may suffice to mention in general; all Trades be∣ing
stopt, Employment ceased; the Labour, and by
that, the Bread of the Poor were cut off; and at first
indeed, the Cries of the poor were most lamentable to
hear; tho' by the Distribution of Charity, their
Misery that way was greatly abated: Many indeed
fled into the Countries; but thousands of them having
stay'd in <HI>London,</HI> till nothing but Desperation sent
them away; Death overtook them on the Road, and
they serv'd for no better than the Messengers of Death,
indeed, others carrying the Infection along with them;
spreading it very unhappily into the remotest Parts of
the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Many of these were the miserable Objects of Dis∣pair
which I have mention'd before, and were re∣mov'd
by the Destruction which followed; these
might be said to perish, not by the Infection it self,
but by the Consequence of it; indeed, namely, by
Hunger and Distress, and the Want of all Things;
being without Lodging, without Money, without
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
Friends, without Means to get their Bread, or with∣out
any one to give it them, for many of them were
without what we call legal Settlements, and so could
not claim of the Parishes, and all the Support they
had, was by Application to the Magistrates for Relief,
which Relief was, (to give the Magistrates their Due)
carefully and chearfully administred, as they found it
necessary; and those that stay'd behind never felt the
Want and Distress of that Kind, which they felt,
who went away in the manner above-noted.</P>
<P>Let any one who is acquainted with what Multi∣tudes
of People, get their daily Bread in this City by
their Labour, whether Artificers or meer Workmen;
I say, let any Man consider, what must be the mise∣rable
Condition of this Town, if on a sudden, they
should be all turned out of Employment, that La∣bour
should cease, and Wages for Work be no more.</P>
<P>This was the Case with us at that Time, and had
not the Sums of Money, contributed in Charity by
well disposed People, of every Kind, as well abroad
as at home, been prodigiously great, it had not been
in the Power of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, to
have kept the Publick Peace; nor were they without
Apprehensions as it was, that Desparation should push
the People upon Tumults, and cause them to rifle the
Houses of rich Men, and plunder the Markets of Provi∣sions;
in which Case the Country People, who brought
Provisions very freely and boldly to Town, would ha'
been terrified from coming any more, and the Town
would ha' sunk under an unavoidable Famine.</P>
<P>But the Prudence of my Lord Mayor, and the
Court of Aldermen within the City, and of the Ju∣stices
of Peace in the Out-parts was such, and they
were supported with Money from all Parts so well, that
the poor People were kept quiet, and their Wants eve∣ry
where reliev'd, as far as was possible to be done.</P>
<P>Two Things, besides this, contributed to prevent
the Mob doing any Mischief: One was, that really
the Rich themselves had not laid up Stores of Provi∣sions
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
in their Houses, as indeed, they ought to have
done, and which if they had been wise enough to have
done, and lock'd themselves entirely up, as some few
did, they had perhaps escaped the Disease better: But
as it appear'd they had not, so the Mob had no No∣tion
of finding Stores of Provisions there, if they had
broken in, as it is plain they were sometimes very
near doing, and which, if they had, they had finish'd
the Ruin of the whole City, for there were no regu∣lar
Troops to ha' withstood them, nor could the
Traind-Bands have been brought together to defend
the City, no Men being to be found to bear Arms.</P>
<P>But the Vigilance of the Lord Mayor, and such
Magistrates as could be had, for some, even of the Al∣dermen
were Dead, and some absent, prevented this;
and they did it by the most kind and gentle Me∣thods
they could think of, as particularly by re∣lieving
the most desperate with Money, and putting
others into Business and particularly that Employ∣ment
of watching Houses that were infected and shut
up; and as the Number of these were very great, for
it was said, there was at one Time, ten thousand
Houses shut up, and every House had two Watchmen
to guard it, <HI>viz</HI> one by Night, and the other by
Day; this gave Opportunity to employ a very great
Number of poor Men at a Time.</P>
<P>The Women, and Servants, that were turned off
from their Places, were likewise employed as Nurses
to tend the Sick in all Places; and this took off a ve∣ry
great Number of them.</P>
<P>And, which tho' a melancholy Article in it self,
yet was a Deliverance in its Kind, namely, the
Plague which raged in a dreadful Manner from the
Middle of <HI>August</HI> to the Middle of <HI>October,</HI> carried off
in that Time thirty or forty Thousand of these very
People, which had they been left, would certainly
have been an unsufferable Burden, by their Poverty,
<HI>that is to say,</HI> the whole City could not have support∣ed
the Expence of them, or have provided Food for
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
them; and they would in Time have been even dri∣ven
to the Necessity of plundering either the City it
self, or the Country adjacent, to have subsisted them∣selves,
which would first or last, have put the whole
Nation, a well as the City, into the utmost Terror
and Confusion.</P>
<P>It was observable then, that this Calamity of the
People made them very humble; for now, for about
nine Weeks together, there died near a thousand a-Day,
one Day with another, even by the Account
of the weekly Bills, which yet I have Reason to
be assur'd never gave a full Account, by many thou∣sands;
the Confusion being such, and the Carts work∣ing
in the Dark, when they carried the Dead, that in
some Places no Account at all was kept, but they
work'd on; the Clerks and Sextons not attending for
Weeks together, and not knowing what Number they
carried. This Account is verified by the following
Bills of Mortality.</P>

<P>So that the Gross of the People were carried off in
these two Months; for as the whole Number which
was brought in, to die of the Plague, was but 68590
here, is fifty thousand of them, within a Trifle, in
two Months; I say 50000, because, as there wants
295 in the Number above, so there wants two Days
of two Months, in the Account of Time.</P>
<P>Now when, I say, that the Parish Officers did not
give in a full Account, or were not to be depended
upon for their Account, let any one but consider how
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
Men could be exact in such a Time of dreadful Di∣stress,
and when many of them were taken sick them∣selves,
and perhaps died in the very Time when their
Accounts were to be given in, I mean the Parish-Clerks;
besides inferior Officers; for tho' these poor
Men ventured at all Hazards, yet they were far from
being exempt from the common Calamity, especially,
if it be true, that the Parish of <HI>Stepney</HI> had within the
Year, one hundred and sixteen Sextons, Grave-diggers,
and their Assistants, that is to say, Bearers, Bell-men,
and Drivers of Carts, for carrying off the dead Bodies.</P>
<P>Indeed the Work was not of a Nature to allow
them Leisure, to take an exact Tale of the dead Bo∣dies,
which were all huddled together in the Dark
into a Pit; which Pit, or Trench, no Man could
come nigh, but at the utmost Peril. I observ'd of∣ten,
that in the Parishes of <HI>Algate,</HI> and <HI>Cripplegate,
White-Chappel</HI> and <HI>Stepney,</HI> there was five, six, seven,
and eight hundred in a Week, in the Bills, whereas
if we may believe the Opinion of those that liv'd in
the City, all the Time, as well as I, there died some∣times
2000 a-Week in those Parishes; and I saw it
under the Hand of one, that made as strict an exa∣mination
into that Part as he could, that there really
died an hundred thousand People of the Plague, in
it that one Year, whereas the Bills, the Articles of
the Plague, was but 68590.</P>
<P>If I may be allowed to give my Opinion, by what
I saw with my Eyes, and heard from other People
that were Eye Witnesses, I do verily believe the same,
<HI>viz.</HI> that there died, at least, 100000 of the Plague
only, besides other Distempers, and besides those
which died in the Fields, and High-ways, and se∣cret
Places, out of the Compass of the Communica∣tion,
as it was called; and who were not put down in
the Bills, tho' they really belonged to the Body of
the Inhabitants. It was known to us all, that abun∣dance
of poor dispairing Creatures, who had the
Distemper upon them, and were grown stupid, or
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
melancholly by their Misery, as many were, wan∣dred
away into the Fields, and Woods, and into se∣cret
uncouth Places, almost any where to creep into
a Bush, or Hedge, and DIE.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Villages adjacent would in
Pity, carry them Food, and set it at a Distance, that
they might fetch it, if they were able, and sometimes
they were not able; and the next Time they went,
they should find the poor Wretches lie dead, and the
Food untouch'd. The Number of these miserable Ob∣jects
were many, and I know so many that perish'd
thus, and so exactly where, that I believe I could go
to the very Place and dig their Bones up still; for the
Country People would go and dig a Hole at a Di∣stance
from them, and then with long Poles, and
Hooks at the End of them, drag the Bodies into these
Pits, and then thro' the Earth in Form as far as they
could cast it to cover them; taking notice how the
Wind blew, and so coming on that Side which the Sea∣men
call <HI>to-Wind-ward,</HI> that the Scent of the Bodies
might blow from them; and thus great Numbers
went out of the World, who were never known or
any Account of them taken, as well within the Bills
of Mortality as without.</P>
<P>This indeed I had, in the main, only from the Re∣lation
of others; for I seldom walk'd into the Fields,
except towards <HI>Bednal-green</HI> and <HI>Hackney;</HI> or as here∣after:
But when I did walk I always saw a great ma∣ny
poor Wanderers at a Distance, but I could know
little of their Cases; for whether it were in the Street,
or in the Fields, if we had seen any Body coming, it
was a general Method to walk away; yet I believe
the Account is exactly true.</P>
<P>As this puts me upon mentioning my walking
the Streets and Fields, I cannot omit taking no∣tice
what a desolate Place the City was at that
Time: The great Street I liv'd in, which is known
to be one of the broadest of all the Streets of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI>
I mean of the Suburbs as well as the Liber∣ties;
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
all the Side where the Butchers lived, especial∣ly
without the Bars was more like a green Field
than a paved Street, and the People generally went
in the middle with the Horses and Carts: It is true,
that the farthest End towards <HI>White-Chappel</HI> Church,
was not all pav'd, but even the Part that was pav'd
was full of Grass also; but this need not seem strange
since the great Streets within the City, such as <HI>Lea∣den-hall-Street,
Bishopgate-Street, Cornhill,</HI> and even the
<HI>Exchange</HI> it self, had Grass growing in them, in se∣veral
Places; neither Cart or Coach were seen in the
Streets from Morning to Evening, except some Coun∣try
Carts to bring Roots and Beans, or Pease, Hay
and Straw, to the Market, and those but very few,
compared to what was usual: As for Coaches they
were scarce used, but to carry sick People to the Pest-House,
and to other Hospitals; and some few to carry
Physicians to such Places as they thought fit to ven∣ture
to visit; for really Coaches were dangerous things,
and People did not Care to venture into them, because
they did not know who might have been carried in
them last; and sick infected People were, <HI>as I have
said,</HI> ordinarily carried in them to the Pest-Houses,
and sometimes People expired in them as they went
along.</P>
<P>It is true, when the Infection came to such a Height
as I have now mentioned, there were very few Physi∣cians,
which car'd to stir abroad to sick Houses, and
very many of the most eminent of the Faculty were
dead as well as the Surgeons also, for now it was in∣deed
a dismal time, and for about a Month together,
not taking any Notice of the Bills of Mortality, I be∣lieve
there did not die less than 1500 or 1700 a-Day,
one Day with another.</P>
<P>One of the worst Days we had in the whole Time,
as I thought, was in the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> when
indeed good People began to think, that God was
resolved to make a full End of the People in this mi∣serable
City. This was at that Time when the
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
Plague was fully come into the Eastern Parishes: The
Parish of <HI>Algate,</HI> if I may give my Opinion buried above
a thousand a Week for two Weeks, tho' the Bills did
not say so many; but it surrounded me at so dismal a
rate, that there was not a House in twenty uninfected;
in the <HI>Minories,</HI> in <HI>Houndsditch,</HI> and in those Parts of <HI>Al∣gate</HI>
Parish about the <HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> and the Alleys over a∣ganist
me, I say in those places Death reigned in every
Corner. <HI>White Chapel</HI> Parish was in the same Condi∣tion,
and tho' muchless than the Parish I liv'd in; yet
bury'd near 600 a Week by the Bills; and in my Opi∣nion,
near twice as many; whole Families, and indeed,
whole Streets of Familes were swept away together;
insomuch, that it was frequent for Neighbours to call
to the Bellman, to go to such and such Houses, and
fetch out the People, for that they were all Dead.</P>
<P>And indeed, the Work of removing the dead Bo∣dies
by Carts, was now grown so very odious and
dangerous, that it was complain'd of, that the Bearers
did not take Care to clear such Houses, where all the
Inhabitants were dead; but that sometimes the Bodies
lay several Days unburied, till the neighbouring Fami∣lies
were offended with the Stench, and consequently
infect'd; and this neglect of the Officers was such, that
the Church Wardens and Constables were summon'd to
look after it; and even the Justices of the <HI>Hamlets,</HI> were
oblig'd to venture their Lives among them, to quicken
and encourage them; for innumerable of the Bearers
dy'd of the Distemper, infected by the Bodies they
were oblig'd to come so near; and had it not been, that
the Number of poor People who wanted Employment,
and wanted Bread, (as I have said before,) was so great,
that Necessity drove them to undertake any Thing,
and venture any thing, they would never have found
People to be employ'd; and then the Bodies of the dead
would have lain above Ground, and have perished and
rotted in a dreadful Manner.</P>
<P>But the Magistrates cannot be enough commended
in this, that they kept such good Order for the bury∣ing
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
of the Dead, that as fast as any of those they em∣ploy'd
to carry off, and bury the dead, fell sick or dy'd,
as was many Times the Case, they immediately sup∣ply'd
the places with others; which by reason of the
great Number of Poor that was left out of Business,
<HI>as above,</HI> was not hard to do: This occasion'd, that
notwithstanding the infinite Number of People which
dy'd, and were sick almost all together, yet, they were
always clear'd away, and carry'd off every Night;
so that it was never to be said of <HI>London,</HI> that the
living were not able to bury the Dead.</P>
<P>As the Desolation was greater, during those terrible
Times, so the Amazement of the People encreas'd;
and a thousand unaccountable Things they would do
in the violence of their Fright, as others did the same
in the Agonies of their Distemper, and this part was
very affecting; some went roaring, and crying, and
wringing their Hands along the Street; some would
go praying, and lifting up their Hands to Heaven, call∣ing
upon God for Mercy. I cannot say indeed, whether
this was not in their Distraction; <HI>but be it so,</HI> it was
still an indication of a more serious Mind, when they
had the use of their Senses, and was much better, <HI>even
as it was,</HI> than the frightful yellings and cryings that
every Day, and especially in the Evenings, were heard
in some Streets. I suppose the World has heard of the
famous <HI>Soloman Eagle</HI> an Enthusiast: He tho' not in∣fected
at all, but in his Head; went about denouncing
of Judgment upon the City in a frightful manner; some∣times
quite naked, and with a Pan of burning Charcoal
on his Head: What he said or pretended, indeed I
could not learn.</P>
<P>I will not say, whether that Clergyman was distra∣cted
or not: Or whether he did it in pure Zeal for the
poor People who went every Evening thro' the Streets
of <HI>White-Chapel;</HI> and with his Hands lifted up, repeat∣ed
that Part of the <HI>Liturgy</HI> of the Church continually;
<HI>Spare us good Lord, spare thy People whom thou hast redeem∣ed
withthy most precious Blood,</HI> I say, I cannot speak posi∣tively
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
of these Things; because these were only the
dismal Objects which represented themselves to me as I
look'd thro' my Chamber Windows (for I seldom open∣ed
the Casements) while I confin'd my self within
Doors, during that most violent rageing of the Pesti∣lence;
when indeed, as I have said, many began to
think, and even to say, that there would none escape;
and indeed, I began to think so too; and therefore kept
within Doors, for about a Fortnight, and never stirr'd
out: But I cou'd not hold it: Besides, there were
some People, who notwithstanding the Danger, did
not omit publickly to attend the Worship of God, even
in the most dangerous Times; and tho' it is true,
that a great many Clergymen did shut up their Chur∣ches,
and fled as other People did, for the safety of
their Lives; yet, all did not do so, some ventur'd to
officiate, and to keep up the Assemblies of the People
by constant Prayers; and sometimes Sermons, or
Brief Exhortations to Repentance and Reformation,
and this as long as any would come to hear them;
and Dissenters did the like also, and even in the very
Churches, where the Parish Ministers were either
Dead or fled, nor was there any Room for making
Difference, at such a Time as this was.</P>
<P>It was indeed a lamentable Thing to hear the misera∣ble
Lamentations of poor dying Creatures, calling out
for Ministers to Comfort them, and pray with them, to
Counsel them, and to direct them, calling out to God
for Pardon and Mercy, and confessing aloud their past
Sins. It would make the stoutest Heart bleed to hear
how many Warnings were then given by dying Peni∣tenrs,
to others not to put off and delay their Repen∣tance
to the Day of Distress, that such a Time of Cala∣mity
as this, was no Time for Repentance; was no
Time to call upon God. I wish I could repeat the very
Sound of those Groans, and of those Exclamations that
I heard from some poor dying Creatures, when in the
Hight of their Agonies and Distress; and that I could
make him that read this hear, as I imagine I now hear
them, for the Sound seems still to Ring in my Ears. If</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124"/>
If I could but tell this Part, in such moving Accents
as should alarm the very Soul of the Reader, I should
rejoice that I recorded those Things, however short and
imperfect.</P>
<P>It pleased God that I was still spar'd, and very
hearty and sound in Health, but very impatient of be∣ing
pent up within Doors without Air, as I had been
for 14 Days or thereabouts; and I could not restrain
my self, but I would go to carry a Letter for my Bro∣ther
to the Post-House; then it was indeed, that I
observ'd a profound Silence in the Streets; when I came
to the Post-House, as I went to put in my Let∣ter,
I saw a Man stand in one Corner of the Yard, and
talking to another at a Window; and a third had o∣pen'd
a Door belonging to the Office; In the middle
of the Yard lay a small Leather Purse, with two Keys
hanging at it, and Money in it, but no Body would
meddle with it: I ask'd how long it had lain there;
the Man at the Window said, it had lain almost an
Hour; but that they had not meddled with it, because
they did not know, but the Person who dropt it,
might come back to look for it. I had no such need
of Money, nor was the Sum so big, that I had any In∣clination
to meddle with it, or to get the Money at
the hazard it might be attended with; so I seem'd to
go away, when the Man who had open'd the Door, said,
he would take it up; but so, that if the right Own∣er
came for it, he should be sure to have it: So he went
in, and fetched a pail of Water, and set it down hard by
the Purse; then went again, and fetch'd some Gun-pow∣der,
and cast a good deal of Powder upon the Purse,
and then made a Train from that which he had
thrown loose upon the Purse; the train reached about
two Yards; after this he goes in a third Time, and
fetches out a pair of Tongues red hot, and which
he had prepar'd, I suppose on purpose; and first set∣ting
Fire to the Train of Powder, that sing'd the
Purse and also smoak'd the Air sufficiently: But he
was not content with that; but he then takes up
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
the Purse with the Tongs, holding it so long till the
Tongs burnt thro' the Purse, and then he shook the
Money out into the Pail of Water, so he carried it in.
The Money, as I remember, was about thirteen Shil∣lings,
and some smooth Groats, and Brass Farthings.</P>
<P>There might perhaps, have been several poor Peo∣ple,
<HI>as I have observ'd above,</HI> that would have been hardy
enough to have ventured for the sake of the Money;
but you may easily see by what I have observ'd, that
the few People, who were spar'd, were very careful of
themselves, at that Time when the Distress was so
exceeding great.</P>
<P>Much about the same Time I walk'd out into the
Fields towards <HI>Bow;</HI> for I had a great mind to see
how things were managed in the River, and among
the Ships; and as I had some Concern in Shipping, I
had a Notion that it had been one of the best Ways
of securing ones self from the Infection to have retir'd
into a Ship, and musing how to satisfy my Curiosity,
in that Point, I turned away over the Fields, from
<HI>Bow</HI> to <HI>Bromley,</HI> and down to <HI>Blackwall,</HI> to the Stairs,
which are there for landing, or taking Water.</P>
<P>Here I saw a poor Man walking on the Bank, or
Sea-wall, as they call it, by himself, I walked a while
also about, seeing the Houses all shut up; at last I fell
into some Talk, at a Distance, with this poor Man;
first I asked him, how People did thereabouts? <HI>Alas,
Sir!</HI> says he, <HI>almost all desolate; all dead or sick: Here are
very few Families in this Part, or in that Village,</HI> pointing
at <HI>Poplar, where half of them are not dead already, and the
rest sick.</HI> Then he pointed to one House, <HI>There they are
all dead,</HI> said he, <HI>and the House stands open; no Body dares
go into it. A poor Thief,</HI> says he, <HI>ventured in to steal some∣thing,
but he paid dear for his Theft; for he was carried to
the Church Yard too, last Night.</HI> Then he pointed to se∣veral
other Houses. <HI>There,</HI> says he, <HI>they are all dead; the
Man and his Wife, and five Children. There,</HI> says he, <HI>they
are shut up, you see a Watchman at the Door;</HI> and so of o∣ther
Houses. <HI>Why,</HI> says I, <HI>What do you here all alone?
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
Why,</HI> says he, <HI>I am a poor desolate</HI> Man; <HI>it has pleased God I
am not yet visited, tho' my Family is, and one of my Children
dead. How do you mean then,</HI> said I, <HI>that you are not
visited. Why,</HI> says he, <HI>that's my House,</HI> pointing to a
very little low boarded House, <HI>and there my poor Wife
and two Children live,</HI> said he, <HI>if they may be said to
live,; for my Wife and one of the Children are visited, but
I do not come at them.</HI> And with that Word I saw the
Tears run very plentifully down his Face; and so
they did down mine too, I assure you.</P>
<P>But said I, <HI>Why do you not come at them? How can you
abandon your own Flesh, and Blood? Oh, Sir!</HI> says he, <HI>the
Lord forbid; I do not abandon them; I work for them as
much as I am able; and blessed be the Lord, I keep them
from Want;</HI> and with that I observ'd, he lifted up
his Eyes to Heaven, with a Countenance that present∣ly
told me, I had happened on a Man that was no Hy∣pocrite,
but a serious, religious good Man, and his
Ejaculation was an Expression of Thankfulness, that
in such a Condition as he was in, he should be able
to say his Family did not want. <HI>Well,</HI> says I, <HI>ho∣nest
Man, that is a great Mercy as things go now with the
Poor: But how do you live then, and how are you kept from
the dreadful Calamity that is now upon us all? Why Sir,</HI>
says he, <HI>I am a Waterman, and there's my Boat,</HI> says he,
<HI>and the Boat seves me for a House; I work in it in the
Day, and I sleep in it in the Night; and what I get, I lay
down upon that Stone,</HI> says he, shewing me a broad Stone
on the other Side of the Street, a good way from his
House, <HI>and then,</HI> says he, <HI>I halloo, and call to them till
I make them hear; and they come and fetch it.</HI></P>
<P>Well Friend, <HI>says I,</HI> but how can you get any Money as a
Waterman? does any Body go by Water these Times? Yes
Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> in the Way I am employ'd there does. Do you
see there, <HI>says he,</HI> five Ships lie at Anchor, <HI>pointing down
the River, a good way below the Town,</HI> and do you
see, <HI>says he,</HI> eight or ten Ships lie at the Chain, there,
and at Anchor yonder, <HI>pointing above the Town.</HI> All
those Ships have Families on board, of their Merchants
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
and Owners, and such like, who have lock'd themselves
up, and live on board, close shut in, for fear of the Infecti∣on;
and I tend on them to fetch Things for them, carry
Letters, and do what is absolutely necessary, that they may
not be obliged to come on Shore; and every Night I fasten
my Boat on board one of the Ship's Boats, and there I sleep
by my self, and blessed be God, I am preserv'd hitherto.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>said I,</HI> Friend, but will they let you come on board,
after you have been on Shore here, when this is such a ter∣rible
Place, and so infected as it is?</P>
<P>Why, as to that, <HI>said he,</HI> I very seldom go up the Ship
Side, but deliver what I bring to their Boat, or lie by the
Side, and they hoist it on board; if I did, I think they are
in no Danger from me, for I never go into any House on
Shore, or touch any Body, no, not of my own Family; But
I fetch Provisions for them.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says I,</HI> but that may be worse, for you must have
those Provisions of some Body or other; and since all this
Part of the Town is so infected, it is dangerous so much as
to speak with any Body; for this Village, <HI>said I,</HI> is as it
were, the Beginning of <HI>London,</HI> tho' it be at some Distance
from it.</P>
<P>That is true, <HI>added</HI> he, but you do not understand me
Right, I do not buy Provisions for them here; I row up
to <HI>Greenwich</HI> and buy fresh Meat there, and sometimes I
row down the River to <HI>Woolwich</HI> and buy there; then I
go to single Farm Houses on the Kentish Side, where I am
known, and buy Fowls and Eggs, and Butter, and bring
to the Ships, as they direct me, sometimes one, sometimes the
other; I seldom come on Shore here; and I came now only
to call to my Wife, and hear how my little Family do, and
give them a little Money, which I receiv'd last Night.</P>
<P>Poor Man! <HI>said I,</HI> and how much hast thou gotten for
them?</P>
<P>I have gotten four Shillings, <HI>said he,</HI> which is a great
Sum, as things go now with poor Men; but they have given
me a Bag of Bread too, and a Salt Fish and some Flesh;
so all helps out.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128"/>
Well, <HI>said I,</HI> and have you given it them yet?</P>
<P>No, <HI>said he,</HI> but I have called, and my Wife has an∣swered,
that she cannot come out yet, but in Half an Hour
she hopes to come, and I am waiting for her: Poor Woman!
<HI>says he,</HI> she is brought sadly down; she has a Swelling, and
it is broke, and I hope she will recover; but I fear the Child
will die; but <HI>it is the Lord!—Here he stopt,
and wept very much.</HI></P>
<P>Well, honest Friend, <HI>said I,</HI> thou hast a sure Comforter,
if thou hast brought thy self to be resign'd to the will of God,
he is dealing with us all in Judgment.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> it is infinite Mercy, if any of us are
spar'd; and who am I to repine!</P>
<P><HI>Sayest thou so,</HI> said I, <HI>and how much less is my Faith
than thine?</HI> And here my Heart smote me, suggesting
how muth better this Poor Man's Foundation was,
on which he staid in the Danger, than mine; that
he had no where to fly; that he had a Family to bind
him to Attendance, which I had not; and mine was
meer Presumption, his a true Dependance, and a Cou∣rage
resting on God: and yet, that he used all pos∣sible
Caution for his Safety.</P>
<P>I turn'd a little way from the Man, while these
Thoughts engaged me, for indeed, I could no more
refrain from Tears than he.</P>
<P>At length, after some farther Talk, the poor Wo∣man
opened the Door, and call'd, <HI>Robert, Robert;</HI> he
answered and bid her stay a few Moments, and he
would come; so he ran down the common Stairs to
his Boat, and fetch'd up a Sack in which was the Pro∣visions
he had brought from the Ships; and when he
returned, he hallooed again; then he went to the great
Stone which he shewed me, and emptied the Sack,
and laid all out, every Thing by themselves, and then
retired; and his Wife came with a little Boy to
fetch them away; and he called, and said, such a
Captain had sent such a Thing, and such a Captain
such a Thing, and at the End adds, <HI>God has sent it all,
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
give Thanks to him.</HI> When the Poor Woman had taken
up all, she was so weak, she could not carry it at once
in, <HI>tho' the Weight was not much neither;</HI> so she left the
Biscuit which was in a little Bag, and left a little
Boy to watch it till she came again.</P>
<P>Well, but <HI>says I to him,</HI> did you leave her the four
Shillings too, which you said was your Week's Pay?</P>
<P>YES, YES, <HI>says he,</HI> you shall hear her own it. <HI>So he
calls again,</HI> Rachel, Rachel, <HI>which it seems was her
Name,</HI> did you take up the Money? YES, <HI>said she.</HI> How
much was it, <HI>said he?</HI> Four Shillings and a Groat, <HI>said
she.</HI> Well, well, <HI>says he,</HI> the Lord keep you all; <HI>and so
he turned to go away.</HI></P>
<P>As I could not refrain contributing Tears to this
Man's Story, so neither could I refrain my Charity
for his Assistance; so I call'd him, <HI>Hark thee Friend,</HI>
said I, <HI>come hither; for I believe thou art in Health, that
I may venture thee;</HI> so I pull'd out my Hand, which was
in my Pocket before, <HI>here,</HI> says I, <HI>go and call thy</HI> Ra∣chel
<HI>once more, and give her a little more Comfort from me.
God will never forsake a Family that trust in him as thou
dost;</HI> so I gave him four other Shillings, and bad
him go lay them on the Stone and call his Wife.</P>
<P>I have not Words to express the poor Man's thank∣fulness,
neither could he express it himself; but by
Tears running down his Face; he call'd his Wife, and
told her God had mov'd the Heart of a Stranger upon
hearing their Condition, to give them all that Money;
and a great deal more such as that, he said to her. The
Woman too, made Signs of the like Thankfulness, as
well to Heaven, as to me, and joyfully pick'd it up;
and I parted with no Money all that Year, that I
thought better bestow'd.</P>
<P>I then ask'd the poor Man if the Distemper had
not reach'd to <HI>Greenwich:</HI> He said it had not, till about
a Fortnight before; but that then he feared it had;
but that it was only at that End of the Town, which
lay South towards <HI>Deptford</HI>-Bridge; that he went on∣ly
to a Butchers-Shop, and a Grocers, where he gene∣rally
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
bought such Things as they sent him for; but
was very careful.</P>
<P>I ask'd him then, how it came to pass, that those
People who had so shut themselves up in the Ships,
had not laid in sufficint Stores of all things necessa∣ry?
He said some of them had, but on the other
Hand, some did not come on board till they were fright∣ed
into it, and till it was too dangerous for them to
go to the proper People, to lay in Quantities of Things,
and that he waited on two Ships which he shewed
me, that had lay'd in little or nothing but Biscuit
Bread, and Ship Beer; and that he had bought every
Thing else almost for them. I ask'd him, if there
was any more Ships that had separated themselves,
as those had done. He told me yes, all the way up
from the Point, right against <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to within the
Shore of <HI>Lime house</HI> and <HI>Redriff,</HI> all the Ships that could
have Room, rid two and two in the middle of the
Stream; and that some of them had several Families
on Board, I ask'd him, if the Distemper had not reach∣ed
them? He said he believ'd it had not, except two
or three Ships, whose People had not been so watch∣ful,
to keep the Seamen from going on Shore as others
had been; and he said it was a very fine Sight to see how
the Ships lay up the Pool.</P>
<P>When he said he was going over to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> as
soon as the Tide began to come in. I ask'd if he
would let me go with him, and bring me back, for
that, I had a great mind to see how the Ships were
ranged as he had told me? He told me if I would as∣sure
him on the Word of a Christian, and of an honest
Man, that I had not the Distemper, he would: I
assur'd him, that I had not, that it had pleased God
to preserve me, That I liv'd in <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> but was
too Impatient of being so long within Doors, and that
I had ventured out so far for the Refreshment of a little
Air; but that none in my House had so much as been
touch't with it.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131"/>
Well, Sir, says he, as your Charity has been mov'd
to pity me and my poor Family; sure you cannot
have so little pity left, as to put your self into my
Boat if you were not Sound in Health, which would
be nothing less than killing me, and ruining my whole
Family. The poor Man troubled me so much, when he
spoke of his Family with such a sensible Concern,
and in such an affectionate Manner, that I cou'd not
satisfy my self at first to go at all. I told him, I
would lay aside my Curiosity, rather than make him
uneasy; tho' I was sure, and very thankful for it,
that I had no more Distemper upon me, than the
freshest Man in the World: <HI>Well,</HI> he would not have
me put it off neither, but to let me see how confident
he was, that I was just to him, he now importun∣ed
me to go; so when the Tide came up to his
Boat, I went in, and he carry'd me to <HI>Greenwich:</HI>
While he bought the Things which he had in his
Charge to buy, I walk'd up to the Top of the Hill,
under which the Town stands, and on the East-Side
of the Town, to get a Prospect of the River: But
it was a surprising Sight to see the Number of Ships
which lay in Rows, two and two, and some Places,
two or three such Lines in the Breadth of the River,
and this not only up quite to the Town, between the
Houses which we call <HI>Ratclif</HI> and <HI>Redriff,</HI> which they
name the <HI>Pool,</HI> but even down the whole River, as
far as the Head of <HI>Long-Reach,</HI> which is as far as the
Hills give us Leave to see it.</P>
<P>I cannot guess at the Number of Ships, but I think
there must be several Hundreds of Sail; and I could
not but applaud the Contrivance, for ten thousand
People, and more, who attended Ship Affairs, were
certainly sheltered here from the Violence of the Con∣tagion,
and liv'd very safe and very easy.</P>
<P>I returned to my own Dwelling very well satisfied
with my Days Journey, and particularly with the
poor Man; also I rejoyced to see that such little San∣ctuaries
were provided for so many Families, in a Time
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
of such Desolation. I observ'd also, that as the Vio∣lence
of the Plague had encreased, so the Ships which
had Families on Board, remov'd and went farther
off, till, as I was told, some went quite away to Sea,
and put into such Harbours, and safe Roads on the
<HI>North</HI> Coast, as they could best come at.</P>
<P>But it was also true, that all the People, who thus
left the Land, and liv'd on Board the Ships, were not
entirely safe from the Infection, for many died, and
were thrown over-board into the River, some in Cof∣fins,
and some, as I heard, without Coffins, whose
Bodies were seen sometimes to drive up and down,
with the Tide in the River.</P>
<P>But I believe, I may venture to say, that in those
Ships which were thus infected, it either happened
where the People had recourse to them too late, and
did not fly to the Ship till they had stayed too long
on Shore, and had the Distemper upon them, tho'
perhaps, they might not perceive it, and so the
Distemper did not come to them, on Board the Ships,
but they really carried it with them; OR it was
in these Ships, where the poor Waterman said they
had not had Time to furnish themselves with Provi∣sions,
but were obliged to send often on Shore to
buy what they had Occasion for, or suffered Boats
to come to them from the Shore; and so the Distem∣per
was brought insensibly among them.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but take notice that the strange
Temper of the People of <HI>London</HI> at that Time contri∣tributed
extremely to their own Destruction. The
Plague began, as I have observed, at the other End
of the Town, namely, in <HI>Long-Acre, Drury-Lane, &amp;c.</HI>
and came on towards the City very gradually and
slowly. It was felt at first in <HI>December,</HI> then again in
<HI>February,</HI> then again in <HI>April,</HI> and always but a very
little at a Time; then it stop till <HI>May,</HI> and even the
last Week in <HI>May,</HI> there was but 17, and all at that
End of the Town; and all this while, even so long,
as till there died above 3000 a-Week; yet had the
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
People in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and in <HI>Wapping,</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff</HI> on
both Sides the River, and almost all <HI>Southwark-Side,</HI>
a mighty Fancy, that they should not be visited, or
at least, that it would not be so violent among them.
Some People fancied, the smell of the Pitch and Tar,
and such other things, as Oil and Rosin, and Brim∣stone,
which is so much used by all Trades relating
to Shipping, would preserve them. Others argued
it, because it was in its extreamest Violence in <HI>West∣minster,</HI>
and the Parishes of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s and St. <HI>An∣drew</HI>'s,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and began to abate again, before it came
among them, which was true indeed, in Part: <HI>For
Example.</HI></P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> That it was observ'd the Numbers mention'd
in <HI>Stepney</HI> Parish, at that time, were generally all on that
Side where <HI>Stepney</HI> Parish joined to <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> which
we now call <HI>Spittle-fields,</HI> where the Parish of <HI>Stepney;</HI>
comes up to the very Wall of <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Church-Yard,

<HI>in the Fields,</HI> and raged most violently in <HI>Cripplegate,
Bishopsgate</HI> and <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Parishes, but there was not

<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
so much with the Plague's going off, without
reaching them, that they took no Care, either to fly
into the Country, or shut themselves up; nay, so
far were they from stirring, that they rather receiv'd
their Friends and Relations from the City into their
Houses; and several from other Places really took
Sanctuary in that Part of the Town, as a Place of
Safety, and as a Place which they thought God
would pass over and not visit as the rest was visited.</P>
<P>And this was the Reason, that when it came up∣on
them they were more surprized, more unprovided
and more at a Loss what to do than they were in
other Places, for when it came among them really,
and with Violence, as it did indeed, in <HI>September</HI> and
<HI>October,</HI> there was then no stirring out into the Coun∣try,
no Body would suffer a Stranger to come near
them, no nor near the Towns where they dwelt; and
as I have been told, several that wandred into the
Country on <HI>Surry</HI> Side were found starv'd to Death in
the Woods and Commons, that Country being more
open and more woody, than any other Part so near
<HI>London;</HI> especially about <HI>Norwood,</HI> and the Parishes of
<HI>Camberwell, Dullege,</HI> and <HI>Lusum,</HI> where it seems no Bo∣dy
durst relieve the poor distress'd People for fear of
the Infection.</P>
<P>This Notion having, as I said, prevailed with the
People in that Part of the Town, was in Part the Oc∣casion,
<HI>as I said before,</HI> that they had Recourse to Ships
for their Retreat; and where they did this early, and
with Prudence, furnishing themselves so with Provi∣sions,
that they had no need to go on Shore for Sup∣plies,
or sufter Boats to come on Board to bring them;
I say where they did so they had certainly the saf∣est
Retreat of any People whatsoever: But the Di∣stress
was such, that People ran on Board in their
Fright without Bread to eat, and some into Ships,
that had no Men on Board to remove them farther
off, or to take the Boat and go down the River to
buy Provisions where it might be done safely; and
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
these often suffered, and were infected on board as
much as on Shore.</P>
<P>As the richer Sort got into Ships, so the lower Rank
got into Hoys, Smacks, Lighters, and Fishing-boats;
and many, especially Watermen, lay in their Boats;
but those made sad Work of it, especially the latter,
for going about for Provision, and perhaps to get their
Subsistence, the Infection got in among them and made
a fearful Havock; many of the Watermen died alone
in their Wherries, as they rid at their Roads, as well
above-Bridge as below, and were not found sometimes
till they were not in Condition for any Body to touch
or come near them.</P>
<P>Indeed the Distress of the People at this Sea-faring
End of the Town was very deplorable, and deserved
the greatest Commiseration: But alas! this was a
a Time when every one's private Safety lay so near
them, that they had no Room to pity the Distresses
of others; for every one had Death, as it were, at his
Door, and many even in their Families, and knew not
what to do, or whither to fly.</P>
<P>This, I say, took away all Compassion; self Pre∣servation
indeed appear'd here to be the first Law.
For the Children ran away from their Parents, as
they lauguished in the utmost Distress: And in some
Places, tho' not so frequent as the other, Parents did
the like to their Children; nay, some dreadful Ex∣amples
there were, and particularly two in one Week
of distressed Mothers, raveing and distracted, killing
their own Children; one whereof was not far off from
where I dwelt; the poor lunatick Creature not liv∣ing
herself long enough to be sensible of the Sin of
what she had done, much less to be punish'd for it.</P>
<P>It is not indeed to be wondred at, for the Danger of
immediate Death to ourselves, took away all Bowels
of Love, all Concern for one another: I speak in ge∣neral,
for there were many Instances of immovable
Affection, Pity, and Duty in many, and some that
came to my Knowledg; that is to say, by here-say:</P>
<P>For I shall not take upon me to vouch the Truth of
the Particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136"/>
To introduce one, let me first mention, that one
of the most deplorable Cases, in all the present Cala∣mity,
was, that of Women with Child; who when
they came to the Hour of their Sorrows, and their
Pains came upon them, cou'd neither have help of one
Kind or another; neither Midwife or Neigbouring
Women to come near them; most of the Midwives
were dead; especially, of such as serv'd the poor;
and many, if not all the Midwives of Note were fled
into the Country: So that it was next to impossible
for a poor Woman that cou'd not pay an immoderate
Price to get any Midwife to come to her, and if they
did, those they cou'd get were generally unskilful
and ignorant Creatures; and the Consequence of
this was, that a most unusual and incredible Number
of Women were reduc'd to the utmost distress. Some
were deliver'd and spoil'd by the rashness and igno∣rance
of those who pretended to lay them. Children
without Number, were, I might say murtherd by
the same, but a more justifiable ignorance, pretending
they would save the Mother, whatever became of
the Child; and many Times, both Mother and Child
were lost in the same Manner; and especially, where
the Mother had the Distemper, there no Body would
come near them, and both sometimes perish'd: Some∣times
the Mother has died of the Plague; and the
Infant, it may be half born, or born but not parted
from the Mother. Some died in the very Pains of
their Travel, and not deliver'd at all; and so many
were the Cases of this Kind, that it is hard to Judge
of them.</P>
<P>Something of it will appear in the unusual Num∣bers
which are put into the Weekly Bills (tho' I am
far from allowing them to be able to give any Thing
of a full Account) under the Articles of
<Q><L>Child-Bed.</L>

<P>To the Disparity of these Numbers, is to be con∣sidered
and allow'd for, that according to our usual
Opinion, who were then upon the Spot, there were
not one third of the People in the Town, during the
Months of <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> as were in the Months
of <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February:</HI> In a Word, the usual Num∣ber
that used to die of these three Articles; and as
I hear, did die of them the Year before, was thus:
<TABLE>

<P><PB N="136" REF="138"/>
This inequallity, I say, is exceedingly augmented,
when the Numbers of People are considered: I pre∣tend
not to make any exact Calculation of the Num∣bers
of People, which were at this Time in the City;
but I shall make a probable Conjecture at that part
by and by: What I have said now, is to explain the
misery of those poor Creatures above; so that it might
well be said as in the Scripture. <HI>Wo! be to those who
are with Child; and to those which give such in that Day.</HI>
For indeed, it was a Wo to them in particular.</P>
<P>I was not conversant in many particlar Families
where these things happen'd; but the Out-cries of
the miserable, were heard afar off. As to those who
were with Child, we have seen some Calculation
made 291 Women dead in Child bed in nine Weeks;
out of one third Part of the Number, of whom there
usually dy'd in that Time, but 48 of the same Dis∣aster.
Let the Reader calculate the Proportion.</P>
<P>There is no Room to doubt, but the Misery of those
that gave Suck, was in Proportion as great▪ Our
Bills of Mortality cou'd give but little Light in this;
yet, some it did, there were several more than usual
starv'd at Nurse, But this was nothing: The Misery
was, where they were (<HI>1st</HI>) starved for want of a
Nurse, the Mother dying, and all the Family and the
Infants found dead by them, meerly for want; and
if I may speak my Opinion, I do believe, that many
hundreds of Poor helpless Infants perish'd in this man∣ner.
<HI>(2dly)</HI> Not starved (but poison'd) by the Nurse,
Nay even where the Mother has been Nurse, and
having receiv'd the Infection, has poison'd, that is,
infected the Infant with her Milk, even before they
knew they were infected themselves; nay, and the In∣fant
has dy'd in such a Case before the Mother. I can∣not
but remember to leave this Admonition upon Re∣cord,
if ever such another dreadful Visitation should
happen in this City; that all Women that are with Child
or that give Suck should be gone, if they have any po∣sible
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
Means out of the Place; because their Misery
if infected, will so much exceed all other Peoples.</P>
<P>I could tell here dismal Stories of living Infants be∣ing
found sucking the Breasts of their Mothers, or
Nurses, after they have been dead of the Plague. Of
a Mother, in the Parish where I liv'd, who having a
Child that was not well, sent for an Apothecary to
View the Child, and when he came, as the Relation
goes, was giving the Child suck at her Breast, and
to all Appearance, was her self very well: But when
the Apothecary came close to her, he saw the To∣kens
upon that Breast, with which she was suckling
the Child. He was surpriz'd enough to be sure;
but not willing to fright the poor Woman too much,
he desired the would give the Child into his Hand;
so he takes the Child, and going to a Cradle in the
Room lays it in, and opening its Cloths, found the
Tokens upon the Child too, and both dy'd before he
cou'd get Home, to send a preventative Medicine to
the Father of the Child, to whom he had told their
Condition; whether the Child infected the Nurse-Mother,
or the Mother the Child was not certain,
but the last the most likely.</P>
<P>Likewise of a Child brought Home to the Parents
from a Nurse that had dy'd of the Plague; yet, the
tender Mother would not refuse to take in her Child,
and lay'd it in her Bosom, by which she was infected,
and dy'd with the Child in her Arms dead also.</P>
<P>It would make the hardest Heart move at the In∣stances
that were frequently found of tender Mothers,
tending and watching with their dear Children, and
even dying before them, and sometimes taking the
Distemper from them, and dying when the Child, for
whom the affectionate Heart had been sacrified, has
got over it and escap'd.</P>
<P>The like of a Tradesman in <HI>East-Smith-field,</HI> whose
Wife was big with Child of her first Child, and fell
in Labour, having the Plague upon her: He cou'd
neither get Midwife to assist her, or Nurse to tend
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
her; and two Servants which he kept fled both from
her. He ran from House to House like one distract∣ed,
but cou'd get no help; the utmost he could get
was, that a Watchman who attended at an infected
House shut up, promis'd to send a Nurse in the Morn∣ing:
The poor Man with his Heart broke, went
back, assisted his Wife what he cou'd, acted the part
of the Midwife; brought the Child dead into the
World; and his Wife in about an Hour dy'd in his
Arms, where he held her dead Body fast till the
Morning, when the Watchman came and brought the
Nurse as he had promised; and coming up the Stairs,
for he had left the Door open, or only latched:
They found the Man sitting with his dead Wife in
his Arms; and so overwhelmed with Grief, that he
dy'd in a few Hours after, without any Sign of the
Infection upon him, but meerly sunk under the Weight
of his Grief.</P>
<P>I have heard also of some, who on the Death of
their Relations, have grown stupid with the insup∣portable
Sorrow, and of one in particular, who was
so absolutely overcome with the Pressure upon his Spi∣rits,
that by Degrees, his Head sunk into his Body,
so between his Shoulders, that the Crown of his Head
was very little seen above the Bones of his Shoulders;
and by Degrees, loseing both Voice and Sense, his
Face looking forward, lay against his Collar-Bone,
and cou'd not be kept up any otherwise, unless held
up by the Hands of other People; and the poor Man
never came to himself again, but languished near a
Year in that Condition and died: Nor was he ever
once seen to lift up his Eyes, or to look upon any
particular Object.</P>
<P>I cannot undertake to give any other than a Sum∣mary
of such Passages as these, because it was not po∣sible
to come at the Particulars, where sometimes
the whole Families, where such Things happen'd,
were carry'd off by the Distemper: But there were
innumerable Cases of this Kind, which presented to
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
the Eye, and the Ear; even in passing along the Streets,
as I have hinted above, nor is it easy to give any
Story of this, or that Family, which there was not
divers parallel Stories to met with of the same Kind.</P>
<P>But as I am now talking of the Time, when the
Plague rag'd at the Easter-most Part of the Town;
how for a long Time the People of those Parts
had flattered themselves that they should escape; and
how they were surprized, when it came upon them
as it did; for indeed, it came upon them like an arm∣ed
Man, when it did come. I say, this brings me
back to the three poor Men, who wandered from
<HI>Wapping,</HI> not knowing whether to go, or what to do,
and who I mention'd before; one a Biscuit-Baker, one
a Sail-Maker, and the other a Joiner; all of <HI>Wapping,</HI>
or thereabouts▪</P>
<P>The Sleepiness and Security of that Part as I have
observ'd, was such; that they not only did not shift
for themselves as others did; but they boasted of be∣ing
safe. and of Safety being with them; and many
People fled out of the City, and out of the infected Su∣burbs,
to <HI>Wapping, Ratcliff, Lime-house, Poplar,</HI> and
such Places, as to Places of Security; and it is not at
all unlikely, that their doing this, help'd to bring
the Plague that way faster, than it might otherwise
have come. For tho' I am much for Peoples flying
away and emptying such a Town as this, upon
the first Appearance of a like Visitation, and that
all People that have any possible Retreat, should
make use of it in Time, and begone; yet, I must say,
when all that will fly are gone, those that are left and
must stand it, should stand stock still where they are,
and not shift from one End of the Town, or one Part
of the Town to the other; for that is the Bane and
Mischief of the whole, and they carry the Plague
from House to House in their very Clothes.</P>
<P>Wherefore, were we ordered to kill all the Dogs
and Cats: But because as they were domestick Ani∣mals,
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
and are apt to run from House to House, and
from Street to Street; so they are capable of carry∣ing
the Effluvia or Infectious Steams of Bodies in∣fected,
even in their Furrs and Hair; and therefore, it
was that in the beginning of the Infection, an Order
was published by the Lord Mayor, and by the Magi∣strates,
according to the Advice of the Physicians;
that all the Dogs and Cats should be imediately kil∣led,
and an Officer was appointed for the Execution.</P>
<P>It is incredible, if their Account is to be depended
upon, what a prodigious Number of those Creatures
were destroy'd: I think they talk'd of forty thousand
Dogs, and five times as many Cats, few Houses be∣ing
without a Cat, and some having several, and some∣times
five or fix in a House. All possible Endeavours
were us'd also to destroy the Mice and Rats, espe∣cially
the latter; by laying Rats Bane, and other
Poisons for them, and a prodigious multitude of them
were also destroy'd.</P>
<P>I often reflected upon the unprovided Condition,
that the whole Body of the People were in at the
first coming of this Calamity upon them, and how
it was for Want of timely entring into Measures, and
Managements, as well publick as private, that all
the Confusions that followed were brought upon us▪
and that such a prodigious Number of People sunk
in that Disaster, which if proper Steps had been
taken, might, Providence concurring, have been a∣voided,
and which, if Posterity think fit, they may
take a Caution, and Warning from: But I shall come
to this Part again.</P>
<P>I come back to my three Men: Their Story has a
Moral in every Part of it, and their whole Conduct,
and that of some who they join'd with, is a Patern
for all poor Men to follow, or Women either, if ever
such a Time comes again; and if there was no other
End in recording it, I thing this a very just one, whe∣ther
my Account be exactly according to Fact or no.</P>
<P>Two of them are said to be Brothers, the one an
old Soldier, but now a Biscuit Baker; the other a
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
lame Sailor, but now a Sail-Maker; the Third a
Joiner. Says <HI>John</HI> the Biscuit Baker, one Day to
<HI>Thomas</HI> his Brother, the Sail-maker, <HI>Brother</HI> Tom,
what will become of us? The Plague grows hot in the City,
and encreases this way: What shall we do?</P>
<P>Truly, says Thomas, I am at a great Loss what to do,
for I find, if it comes down into <HI>Wapping,</HI> I shall be turn'd
out of my Lodging: <HI>And thus they began to talk of it
beforehand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Turn'd out of your Lodging, <HI>Tom!</HI> if you are,
I don't know who will take you in; for People are so afraid
of one another now, there's no getting a Lodging any where.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> Why? The People where I lodge are good civil
People, and have Kindness enough for me too; but they
say I go abroad every Day to my Work, and it will be dan∣gerous;
and they talk of locking themselves up, and letting
no Body come near them.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Why, they are in the right to be sure, if they re∣solve
to venture staying in Town.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> Nay, I might e'en resolve to stay within Doors
too, for, except a Suit of Sails that my Master has in Hand,
and which I am just a finishing, I am like to get no more
Work a great while; there's no Trade stirs now; Work∣men
and Servants are turned off every where, so that I might
be glad to be lock'd up too: But I do not see they will be
willing to consent to that, any more than to the other.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Why, what will you do then Brother? and what
shall I do? for I am almost as bad as you; the People where
I lodge are all gone into the Country but a Maid, and she is
to go next Week, and to shut the House quite up, so that I
shall be turn'd a drift to the wide World before you, and I
am resolved to go away too, if I knew but where to go.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> We were both distracted we did not go away at
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st, then we might ha' travelled any where; there's no stir∣ring
now; we shall be starv'd if we pretend to go out of
Town; they won't let us have Victuals, no, not for our
Money, nor let us come into the Towns, much less into their
Houses.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144"/>
<HI>John,</HI> And that which is almost as bad, I have but little
Money to help my self with neither.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> As to that we might make shift; I have a little,
tho' not much; but I tell you there's no stirring on the Road▪
I know a Couple of poor honest Men in our Street have at∣tempted
to travel, and at <HI>Barnet,</HI> or <HI>Whetston,</HI> or there
about, the People offered to fire at them if they pretended to
go forward; so they are come back again quite discourag'd.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> I would have ventured their Fire, if I had been
there; If I had been denied Food for my Money they should
ha' seen me take it before their Faces; and if I had ten∣dred
Money for it, they could not have taken any Course with
me by Law.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> You talk your old Soldier's Language, as if you
were in the <HI>Low-Countris</HI> now, but this is a serious thing.
The People have good Reason to keep any Body off, that
they are not satisfied are sound, at such a Time as this;
and we must not plunder them.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> No Brother, you mistake the Case, and mistake
me too, I would plunder no Body; but for any Town upon
the Road to deny me Leave to pass thro' the Town in the
open High-Way, and deny me Provisions for my Money, is
to say the Town has a Right to starve me to Death, which
cannot be true.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> But they do not deny you Liberty to go back again
from whence you came, and therefore they do not starve you.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> But the next Town behind me will by the same
Rule deny me leave to go back, and so they do starve me
between them; besides there is no Law to prohibit my travel∣ling
wherever I will on the Road.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> But there will be so much Difficulty in disputing
with them at every Town on the Road, that it is not for
poor Men to do it, or to undertake it at such a Time as this
is especially.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Why Brother? Our Condition at this Rate is worse
than any Bodies else; for we can neither go away nor stay
here; I am of the same Mind with the Lepers of <HI>Samaria,
If we stay here we are sure to die;</HI> I mean especially,
as you and I are stated, without a Dwelling-House of our
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
own, and without Lodging in any Bodies else; there is no
lying in the Street at such a Time as this; we had as good
go into the Dead-Cart at once: Therefore I say, <HI>if we stay
here we are sure to die,</HI> and if we go away <HI>we can but
die:</HI> I am resolv'd to be gone.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> You will go away: Whither will you go? and
what can you do? I would as willingly go away as you, if
I knew whither: But we have no Acquaintance, no Friends.
Here we were born, and here we must die.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Look you <HI>Tom,</HI> the whole Kingdom is my Na∣tive
Country as well as this Town. You may as well say, I
must not go out of my House if it is on Fire, as that I must
not go out of the Town I was born in, when it is infected
with the Plague. I was born in <HI>England,</HI> and have a
Right to live in it if I can.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> But you know every vagrant Person may by the
Laws of <HI>England,</HI> be taken up, and pass'd back to their
last legal Settlement.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> But how shall they make me vagrant; I desire only
to travel on, upon my lawful Occasions.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> What lawful Occasions can we pretend to tra∣vel,
or rather wander upon, they will not be put off with
Words.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Is not flying to save our Lives, a Lawful Oc∣casion!
and do they not all know that the Fact is true: We
cannot be said to dissemble.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> But suppose they let us pass, Whither shall we go?</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Any where to save our Lives: It is Time enough
to consider that when we are got out of this Town. If I am
once out of this dreadful Place I care not where I go.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> We shall be driven to great Extremities. I know
not what to think of it.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Well <HI>Tom,</HI> consider of it a little.</P>
<P>This was about the Beginning of <HI>July,</HI> and tho'
the Plague was come forward in the West and North
Parts of the Town, yet all <HI>Wapping,</HI> as I have ob∣served
before, and <HI>Redriff,</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> and <HI>Lime-House,</HI>
and <HI>Poplar,</HI> in short, <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
all both Sides of the River from the the <HI>Hermitage,</HI>
and from over against it, quite down to <HI>Blackwall,</HI>
was intirely free, there had not one Person died of
the Plague in all <HI>Stepney</HI> Parish, and not one on the
South Side of <HI>White Chappel</HI> Road, no, not in any
Parish▪ and yet the Weekly Bill was that very Week
risen up to 1006.</P>
<P>It was a Fortnight after this, before the the two
Brothers met again, and then the Case was a little
altered, and the Plague was èxceedingly advanced,
and the Number greatly encreased, the Bill was up
at 2785, and prodigiously encreasing, tho' still both
Sides of the River, as below, kept pretty well: But
some began to die in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and about five or six
in <HI>Ratclif-High-Way,</HI> when the Sail Maker came
to his Brother <HI>John,</HI> express, and in some Fright,
for he was absolutely warn'd out of his Lodging,
and had only a Week to provide himself. His Bro∣ther
<HI>John</HI> was in as bad a Case, for he was quite out,
and had only beg'd Leave of his Master the Biscuit
Baker to lodge in an Out-House belonging to his
Work-house, where he only lay upon Straw, with
some Biscuit Sacks, or Bread-Sacks, as they call'd
them, laid upon it, and some of the same Sacks to
cover him.</P>
<P>Here they resolved, seeing all Employment being
at an End, and no Work, or Wages to he had, they
would make the best of their Way to get out of the
Reach of the dreadful Infection; and being as
good Husbands as they could, would endeavour to
live upon what they had as long as it would last,
and then work for more, if they could get Work any
where, of any Kind, let it be what it would.</P>
<P>While they were considering to put this Resolu∣tion
in Practice, in the best Manner they could,
the third Man, who was acquainted very well with
the Sail Maker, came to know of the Design, and
got Leave to be one of the Number, and thus they
prepared to set out.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147"/>
It happened that they had not an equal share of
Money, but as the Sail-maker, who had the best
Stock, was besides his being Lame, the most unfit
to expect to get any thing by Working in the Coun∣try,
so he was content that what Money they had
should all go into one publick Stock, on Condition,
that whatever any one of them could gain more than
another, it should, without any grudging, be all ad∣ded
to the same publick Stock.</P>
<P>They resolv'd to load themselves with as little
Baggage as possible, because they resolv'd at first to
travel on Foot; and to go a great way, that they
might, if possible, be effectually Safe; and a great
many Consultations they had with themselves, before
they could agree about what Way they should tra∣vel,
which they were so far from adjusting, that even
to the Morning they set out, they were not resolv'd
on it.</P>
<P>At last the Seaman put in a Hint that determin'd
it; First, says he, the Weather is very hot, and there∣fore
I am for travelling North, that we may not
have the Sun upon our Faces and beating on our
Breasts, which will heat and suffocate us; and I have
been told, says he, that it is not good to over-heat
our Blood at a Time when, for ought we know, the
Infection may be in the very Air. In the next Place,
says he, I am for going the Way that may be con∣trary
to the Wind as it may blow when we set out,
that we may not have the Wind blow the Air of the
City on our Backs as we go. These two Cautions were
approv'd of; if it could be brought so to hit, that the
Wind might not be in the South when they set out
to go North.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> the Baker, who had been a Soldier, then put
in his Opinion; First, says he, we none of us ex∣pect
to get any Lodging on the Road, and it will
be a little too hard to lie just in the open
Air; tho' it be warm Weather, yet it may be wet,
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
and damp, and we have a double Reason to
take care of our Healths at such a time as this;
and therefore, says he, you, Brother <HI>Tom.</HI> that are
a Sail-maker, might easily make us a little Tent,
and I will undertake to set it up every Night, and
take it down, and a Fig for all the Inns in <HI>England;</HI>
if we have a good Tent over our Heads, we shall do
well enough.</P>
<P>The Joyner oppos'd this, and told them, let them
leave that to him, he would undertake to build them
a House every Night with his Hatchet and Maller,
tho' he had no other Tools, which should be fully to
their satisfaction, and as good as a Tent.</P>
<P>The Soldier and the Joyner disputed that Point
some time, but at last the Soldier carry'd it for a
Tent; the only Objection against it was, that it
must be carry'd with them, and that would encrease
their Baggage too much, the Weather heing hot; but
the Sail-maker had a piece of good Hap fell in which
made that easie, for, his Master who he work'd for
having a Rope-Walk as well as his Sail-making
Trade, had a little poor Horse that he made no use
of then, and being willing to assist the three honest
Men, he gave them the Horse for the carrying their
Baggage; also for a small Matter of three Days Work
that his Man did for him before he went, he let him
have an old Top-gallant Sail that was worn out, but
was sufficient and more than enough to make a very
good Tent: The Soldier shew'd how to shape it, and
they soon by his Direction made their Tent. and fit∣ted
it with Poles or Staves for the purpose, and thus
they were furnish'd for their Journey; <HI>viz.</HI> three Men,
one Tent, one Horse, one Gun, for the Soldier would
not go without Arms, for now he said he was no
more a Biscuit-Baker, but a Trooper.</P>
<P>The Joyner had a small Bag of Tools, such as might
be useful if he should get any Work abroad, as well
for their Subsistence as his own: What Money they
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
had, they brought all into one publick Stock, and
thus they began their Journey. It seems that in the
Morning when they set out, the Wind blew as the
Saylor said by his Pocket Compass, at N. W. by W.
So they directed, or rather resolv'd to direct their
Course N. W.</P>
<P>But then a Difficulty came in their Way, that as
they set out from the hither end of <HI>Wapping</HI> near
the <HI>Hermitage,</HI> and that the Plague was now very
Violent, especially on the North side of the City▪
as in <HI>Shoreditch</HI> and <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Parish, they did not
think it safe for them to go near those Parts; so
they went away East through <HI>Radcliff</HI> High-way, as
far as <HI>Radcliff-Cross,</HI> and leaving <HI>Stepney</HI> Church still
on their Left-hand, being afraid to come up from
<HI>Radcliff-Cross</HI> to <HI>Mile-end,</HI> because they must come
just by the Church-yard, and because the Wind that
seemed to blow more from the West, blow'd directly
from the side of the City where the Plague was hot∣test.
So I say, leaving <HI>Stepney,</HI> they fetched a long
Compass, and going to <HI>Poplar</HI> and <HI>Bromley,</HI> came in∣to
the great Road just at <HI>Bow.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Watch plac'd upon <HI>Bow</HI> Bridge would
have question'd them; but they crossing the Road
into a narrow Way that turns out at the hither End
of the Town of <HI>Bow</HI> to <HI>Old-Ford,</HI> avoided any En∣quiry
there, and travelled to <HI>Old-Ford.</HI> The Con∣stables
every where were upon their Guard, not so
much it seems to stop People passing by, as to stop
them from taking up their Abode in their Tow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
and withal because of a Report that was newly
rais'd at that time, and that indeed was not very
improbable, <HI>viz.</HI> That the poor People in <HI>London</HI>
being distress'd and starv'd for want of Work, and by
that means for want of Bread, were up in Arms, and
had raised a Tumult, and that they would come out
to all the Towns round to plunder for Bread. This,
I say, was only a Rumour, and it was very well it
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
was no more; but it was not so far off from being a
Reality, as it has been thought, for in a few Weeks
more the poor People became so Desperate by the
Calamity they suffer'd, that they were with great
difficulty kept from running out into the Fields
and Towns, and tearing all in pieces where-ever
they came; and, as I have observed before, nothing
hinder'd them but that the Plague rag'd so violent∣ly,
and fell in upon them so furiously, that they ra∣ther
went to the Grave by Thousands than into
the Fields in Mobs by Thousands: For in the Parts
about the Parishes of St. <HI>Sepulchres, Clerkenwell, Crip∣plegate,
Bishepsgate</HI> and <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> which were the
Places where the Mob began to threaten, the Di∣stemper
came on so furiously, that there died in those
few Parishes, even then, before the Plague was come
to its height, no less than 5361 People in the first
three Weeks in <HI>August,</HI> when at the same time, the Parts
about <HI>Wapping, Radcliffe,</HI> and <HI>Rotherhith,</HI> were, as
before describ'd, hardly touch'd, or but very light∣ly;
so that in a Word, tho', as I said before, the
good Management of the Lord Mayor and Justices
did much to prevent the Rage and Desperation of
the People from breaking out in Rabbles and Tu∣mults,
and in short, from the Poor plundering the
Rich; I say, tho' they did much, the Dead Carts
did more, for as I have said, that in five Pa∣rishes
only there died above 5000 in 20 Days, so
there might be probably three times that Number
Sick all that time; for some recovered, and great
Numbers fell sick every Day and died afterwards.
Besides, I must still be allowed to say, that if the
Bills of Mortality said five Thousand, I always be∣liev'd
it was near twice as many in reality; there
being no room to believe that the Account they
gave was right, or that indeed, they were, among
such Confusions as I saw them in, in any Condition
to keep an exact Account.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="151"/>
But to return to my Travellers; Here they were
only examined, and as they seemed rather coming
from the Country than from the City, they found
the People the easier with them; that they talk'd to
them, let them come into a publick House where
the Constable and his Warders were, and gave them
Drink and some Victuals, which greatly refreshed and
encourag'd them; and here it came into their Heads
to say, when they should be enquir'd of afterwards,
not that they came from <HI>London,</HI> but that they came
out of <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P>To forward this little Fraud, they obtain'd so
much Favour of the Constable at <HI>Old-Ford,</HI> as to give
them a Certificate of their passing from <HI>Essex</HI> thro'
that Village, and that they had not been at <HI>London;</HI>
which tho' false in the common acceptation of <HI>London</HI>
in the County, yet was literally true; <HI>Wapping</HI> or
<HI>Radcliff</HI> being no part either of the City or Liberty.</P>
<P>This Certificate directed to the next Constable
that was at <HI>Hummerton,</HI> one of the Hamlets of the
Parish of <HI>Hackney,</HI> was so serviceable to them, that
it procurcd them not a free Passage there only, but
a full Certificate of Health from a Justice of the
Peace; who, upon the Constable's Application, grant∣ed
it without much Difficulty; and thus they pass'd
through the long divided Town of <HI>Hackney,</HI> (for it lay
then in several separated Hamlets) and travelled on
till they came into the great North Road on the
top of <HI>Stamford-Hill.</HI></P>
<P>By this time they began to be we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, and so in the
back Road from <HI>Hackney</HI> a little before it opened in∣to
the said great Road, they resolv'd to set up their
Tent and encamp for the first Night; which they did
accordingly, with this addition, that finding a Barn,
or a Building like a Barn, and first searching as well
as they could to be sure there was no Body in it,
they set up their Tent, with the Head of it against
the Barn; this they did also because the Wind blew
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
that Night very high, and they were but young
at such a way of Lodging, as well as at the managing
their Tent.</P>
<P>Here they went to Sleep, but the Joynet, a grave
and sober Man, and not pleased with their lying at
this loose rate the first Night, could not sleep, and
resolv'd, after trying to Sleep to no purpose, that he
would get out, and taking the Gun in his Hand
stand Centinel and Guard his Companions: So
with the Gun in his Hand he walk'd to and again
before the Barn, for that stood in the Field near the
Road, but within the Hedge. He had not been
long upon the Scout, but he heard a Noise of Peo∣ple
coming on as if it had been a great Number,
and they came on, as he thought, directly towards
the Barn. He did not presently awake his Compa∣nions,
but in a few Minutes more their Noise grow∣ing
louder and louder, the Biscuit-Baker call'd to
him and ask'd him what was the Matter, and quick∣ly
started out too: The other being the Lame Sail∣maker
and most weary, lay still in the Tent.</P>
<P>As they expected, so the People who they had
heard, came on directly to the Barn, when one of
our Travellers challenged, like Soldiers upon the
Guard, with <HI>Who comes there?</HI> The People did not
Answer immediately, but one of them speaking to
another that was behind him, <HI>Alas! Alas! we are
all disappointed,</HI> says <HI>he, here are some People before us,
the Barn is taken up.</HI></P>
<P>They all stopp'd upon that as under some Sur∣prize,
and it seems there was about Thirteen of
them in all, and some Women among them: They
consulted together what they should do, and by
their Discourse our Travellers soon found they were
poor distress'd People too like themselves, seeking
Shelter and Safety; and besides, our Travellers had
no need to be afraid of their coming up to disturb
them; for as soon as they heard the Words, <HI>Who
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
comes there,</HI> these could hear the Women say, <HI>as if
frighted, Do not go near them, how do you know but
they may have the Plague?</HI> And when one of the Men
said, <HI>Let us but speak to them;</HI> the Women said, <HI>No,
don't by any means, we have escap'd thus far</HI> by the
Goodness of God, <HI>do not let us run into Danger now,
we beseech you.</HI></P>
<P>Our Travellers found by this that they were a
good sober sort of People and flying for their Lives
as they were; and, as they were encourag'd by it, so
<HI>John</HI> said to the Joyner his Comtade, <HI>Let us Encourage
them too as much as we can:</HI> So he called to them, <HI>Hark
ye good People</HI> says the Joyner, we find by your Talk,
that you are fleeing from the same dreadful Enemy
as we are, do not be afraid of us, we are only three
poor Men of us, if you are free from the Diftemper
you shall not be hurt by us; we are not in the Barn,
but in a little Tent here in the outside, and we will
remove for you, we can set up our Tent again im∣mediately
any where else; and upon this a Parly
began between the Joyner, whose Name was <HI>Richard,</HI>
and one of their Men, who said his Name was <HI>Ford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> And do you assure us that you are all Sound
Men.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> Nay, we are concern'd to tell you of it,
that you may not be uneasy, or think your selves in
Danger; but you see we do not desire you should
put your selves into any Danger; and therefore I
tell you, that as we have not made use of the Barn,
so we will remove from it, that you may be Safe
and we also.</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> That is very kind and charitable; But, if we
have Reason to be satisfied that you are Sound and
free from the Visitation, why should we make you
remove now you are settled in your Lodging, and
it may be are laid down to Rest? we will go into
the Barn if you please, to rest our selves a while, and
we need not disturb you.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154"/>
<HI>Rich.</HI> Well, but you are more than we are, I hope
you will assure us that you are all of you Sound too,
for the Danger is as great from you to us, as from
us to you.</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> Blessed be God that some do escape tho'it
is but few; what may be our Portion still we know
not, but hitherto we are preserved.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> What part of the Town do you come from?
Was the Plague come to the Places where you
liv'd?</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> Ay ay, in a most frightful and terrible man∣ner,
or else we had not fled away as we do; but we
believe there will be very few left alive behind us.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> What Part do you come from?</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> We are most of us of <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Parish, on∣ly
two or three of <HI>Clerkenwell</HI> Parish, but on the hi∣ther
side.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> How then was it that you came away no
sooner?</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> We have been away some time, and kept
together as well as we could at the hither End of
<HI>Islington,</HI> where we got leave to lie in an old unin∣habited
House, and had some Bedding and Conve∣niencies
of our own that we brought with us, but
the Plague is come up into <HI>Islington</HI> too, and a House
next Door to our poor Dwelling was Infected and
shut up, and we are come away in a Fright.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> And what Way are you going?</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> As our Lott shall cast us, we know not
whither, but God will Guide those that look up
to him.</P>
<P>They parlied no further at that time, but came
all up to the Barn, and with some Difficulty got
into it: There was nothing but Hay in the Barn,
but it was almost full of that, and they accommo∣dated
themselves as well as they cou'd, and went to
Rest; but our Travellers observ'd, that before they
went to Sleep, an antient Man, who it seems was
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
Father of one of the Women, went to Prayer with
all the Company, recommending themselves to the
Blessing and Direction of Providence, before they
went to Sleep.</P>
<P>It was soon Day at that time of the Year; and as
<HI>Richard</HI> the Joyner had kept Guard the first part of
the Night, so <HI>John</HI> the Soldier Reliev'd him, and
he had the Post in the Morning, and they began
to be acquainted with one another. It seems, when
they left <HI>Islington,</HI> they intended to have gone North
away to <HI>Highgate,</HI> but were stop'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lloway,</HI> and
there they would not let them pass; so they cross'd
over the Fields and Hills to the Eastward, and
came out at the <HI>Boarded-River,</HI> and so avoiding the
Towns, they left <HI>Hornsey</HI> on the left Hand, and <HI>New∣ington</HI>
on the right Hand, and came into the great
Road about <HI>Stamford-Hill</HI> on that side, as the three
Travellers had done on the other side: And now they
had Thoughts of going over the River in the Mar∣shes,
and make forwards to <HI>Epping</HI> Forest, where they
hoped they should get leave to Rest. It seems they
were not Poor, at least not so Poor as to be in Want;
at least they had enough to subsist them moderately
for two or three Months, when, as they said, they
were in Hopes the cold Weather would check the
Infection, or at least the Violence of it would have
spent itself, and would abate, if it were only for want
of People left alive to be Infected.</P>
<P>This was much the Fate of our three Travellers;
only that they seemed to be the better furnish'd for
Travelling, and had it in their View to go further
off; for as to the first, they did not propose to go
farther than one Day's Journey, that so they might
have Intelligence every two or three Days how
Things were at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But here our Travellers found themselves un∣der
an unexpected Inconvenience namely, that
of their Horse, for by means of the Horse to
carry their Baggag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they were obliged to keep
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
keep in the Road, whereas the People of this other
Band went over the Fields or Roads, Path or no
Path, Way, or no Way, as they pleased; neither had
they any Occasion to pass thro' any Town, or come
near any Town, other than to buy such Things as
they wanted for their necessary Subsistence, and in
that indeed they were put to much Difficulty: Of
which in its Place.</P>
<P>But our three Travellers were oblig'd to keep the
Road, or else they must commit Spoil and do the
Country a great deal of Damage in breaking down
Fences and Gates, to go over enclosed Fields, which
they were loth to do if they could help it.</P>
<P>Our three Travellers however had a great Mind
to join themselves to this Company, and take
their Lot with them; and after some Discourse, they
laid aside their first Design which look'd Northward,
and resolv'd to follow the other into <HI>Essex;</HI> so in the
Morning they took up their Tent and loaded their
Horse, and away they travelled all together.</P>
<P>They had some Difficulty in passing the Ferry at
the River side, the Ferry-Man being afraid of them;
but after some Parly at a Distance, the Ferry-Man
was content to bring his Boat to a Place distant from
the usual Ferry, and leave it there for them to
take it; so putting themselves over, he directed them
to leave the Boat, and he having another Boat,
said he would fetch it again, which it seems however
he did not do for above Eight Days.</P>
<P>Here giving the Ferry-Man Money before-hand,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey had a supply of Victuals and Drink, which he
brought and left in the Boat for them, but not with∣out,
as I said, having receiv'd the Mony before-hand.
But now our Travellers were at a great Loss and
Difficulty how to get the Horse over, the Boat be∣ing
small and not fit for it, and at last cou'd not do
it without unloading the Baggage, and making him
swim over.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157"/>
From the River they travelled towards the Forest,
but when they came to <HI>Walthamstow</HI> the People of
that Town denied to admit them, as was the Case
every where: The Constables and their Watchmen
kept them off at a Distance, and Parly'd with them;
they gave the same Account of themselves as before,
but these gave no Credit to what they said, giving
it for a Reason that two or three Companies had al∣ready
come that Way and made the like Pretences,
but that they had given several People the Distem∣per
in the Towns where they had pass'd, and had
been afterwards so hardly us'd by the Country,
tho' with Justice too, as they had deserv'd; that a∣bout
<HI>Brent-Wood</HI> or that Way, several of them Pe∣rish'd
in the Fields, whether of the Plague, or of
mere Want and Distress, they could not tell.</P>
<P>This was a good Reason indeed why the People
of <HI>Walthamstow</HI> shou'd be very cautious, and why
they shou'd resolve not to entertain any Body that
they were not well satisfied of. But as <HI>Richard</HI> the
Joyner, and one of the other Men who parly'd with
them told them, it was no Reason why they should
block up the Roads, and refuse to let People pass
thro' the Town, and who ask'd nothing of them, but
to go through the Street: That if their People were
afraid of them, they might go into their Houses and
shut their Doors, they would neither show them
Civility nor Incivility, but go on about their Business.</P>
<P>The Constables and Attendants, not to be per∣swaded
by Reason, continued Obstinate, and wou'd
hearken to nothing; so the two Men that talk'd with
them went back to their Fellows, to consult what
was to be done: It was very discouraging in the
whole, and they knew not what to do for a good
while: But at last <HI>John</HI> the Soldier and Biscuit-Baker
considering a-while, Come, says he, leave the rest of
the Parly to me; he had not appear'd yet, so he
sets the Joyner <HI>Richard</HI> to Work to cut some Poles

out of the Trees, and shape them as like Guns as
he could, and in a little time he had five or six fair
Muskets, which at a Distance would not be known;
and about the Part where the Lock of a Gun is
he caused them to wrap Cloths and Rags, such as
they had, as Soldiers do in wet Weather, to pre∣serve
the Locks of their Pieces from Rust, the rest
was discolour'd with Clay or Mud, such as they
could get; and all this while the rest of them sat
under the Trees by his Direction, in two or three
Bodies, where they made Fires at a good Distance
from one another.</P>
<P>While this was doing, he advanc'd himself and two
or three with him, and set up their Tent in the Lane
within sight of the Barrier which the Town's Men
had made, and set a Centinel just by it with the re∣al
Gun, the only one they had, and who walked to
and fro with the Gun on his Shoulder, so as that
the People of the Town might see them; also he
ty'd the Horse to a Gate in the Hedge just by, and
got some dry Sticks together and kindled a Fire on
the other side of the Tent, so that the People of the
Town cou'd see the Fire and the Smoak, but cou'd
not see what they were doing at it.</P>
<P>After the Country People had look'd upon them
very earnestly a great while, and by all that they
could see, cou'd not but suppose that they were a
great many in Company, they began to be uneasie,
not for their going away, but for staying where
they were; and above all perceiving they had Hor∣ses
and Arms, for they had seen one Horse and one
Gun at the Tent, and they had seen others of them
walk about the Field on the inside of the Hedge,
by the side of the Lane with their Muskets, as they
took them to be, Shoulder'd: I say, upon such a
Sight as this, you may be assured they were Alarm'd
and terribly Frighted; and it seems they went to a
Justice of the Peace to know what they should do;
what the Justice advis'd them to I know not,

<P>Accordingly they sent to the Place twenty Loaves
of Bread, and three or four large pieces of good
Beef, and opened some Gates thro' which they
pass'd, but none of them had Courage so much as to
look out to see them go, and, as it was Evening,
if they had looked they cou'd not have seen them
so as to know how few they were.</P>
<P>This was <HI>John</HI> the Soldier's Management. But
this gave such an Alarm to the County▪ that had
they really been two or three Hundred, the whole
County would have been rais'd upon them, and they
wou'd ha' been sent to Prison, or perhaps knock'd
on the Head.</P>
<P>They were soon made sensible of this, for two
Days afterwards they found several Parties of Horse∣men
and Footmen also about, in pursuit of three
Companies of Men arm'd, <HI>as they said,</HI> with Mus∣kets,
who were broke out from <HI>London,</HI> and had
the Plague upon the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and that were not only
spreading the Distemper among the People, but
plundering the Country.</P>
<P>As they saw now the Consequence of their Case,
they soon see the Danger they were in, so they re∣solv'd
by the Advice also of the old Soldier, to di∣vide
themselves again.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here he call'd to one of his Men, and bade him order Capt. <HI>Richard</HI> and his People to March the Lower Way on the side of the Marshes, and meet them in the Forest; which was all a Sham▪ for they had no Captain <HI>Richard.</HI> or any such Company.</NOTE> <HI>John</HI> and his two Com∣rades
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
with the Horse, went away as if towards <HI>Wal∣tham;</HI>
the other in two Companies, but all a little
asunder, and went towards <HI>Epping.</HI></P>
<P>The first Night they Encamp'd all in the Forest,
and not far off of one another, but not setting up the
Tent, lest that should discover them: On the other
hand <HI>Richard</HI> went to work with his Axe and his Hat∣chet,
and cutting down Branches of Trees, he built
three Tents or Hovels, in which they all Encamp'd
with as much Convenience as they could expect.</P>
<P>The Provisions thy had had at <HI>Walthamstow</HI> serv'd
them very plentisully th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Night, and as for the
next they left it to Providence; they had far'd
so well with the old Soldier's Conduct, that
they now willingly made him their Leader; and
the first of his Conduct appear'd to be very good:
He told them that they were now at a pro∣per
Distance enough from <HI>London;</HI> that as they
need not be immediately beholden to the Coun∣ty
for Relief, so they ought to be as careful the
Country did not infect them, as that they did not
infect the Country; that what little Money they
had they must be as frugal of as they could; that
as he would not have them think of offering the
Country any Violence, so they must endeavour to
make the Sense of their Condition go as far with
the Country as it could: They all referr'd them∣selves
to his Direction; so they left their 3 Houses
standing and the next Day went away towards <HI>Ep∣ping;</HI>
the Captain also, for so they now called him,
and his two Fellow Travellers laid a side their De∣sign
of going to <HI>Waltham,</HI> and all went together.</P>
<P>When they came near <HI>Epping</HI> they halted, choo∣sing
out a proper Place in the open Forest, not ve∣ry
near the High-way, but not far out of it on the
North-side, under a little cluster of low Pollard∣Trees:
Here they pitched their little Camp, which
consisted of three large Tents or Hutts made of
Poles, which their Carpenter, and such as were his
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
Assistants, cut down and fix'd in the Ground in a
Circle▪ binding all the small Ends together at the
Top, and thickning the sides with Boughs of
Trees and Bushes, so that they were compleatly
close and warm. They had besides this, a little
Tent where the Women lay by themselves, and a
Hutt to put the Horse in.</P>
<P>It happened that the next day, or next but one was
Market-day at <HI>Epping;</HI> when Capt. <HI>John,</HI> and one of
the other Men, went to Market, and bought some
Provisions, that is to say Bread, and some Mutton
and Beef; and two of the Women went separately,
as if they had not belong'd to the rest, and bought
more. <HI>John</HI> took the Horse to bring it Home, and
the Sack (which the Carpenter carry'd his Tools
in) to put it in: The Carpenter went to Work
and made them Benches and Stools to sit on, such
as the Wood he cou'd get wou'd afford, and a kind
of a Table to dine on.</P>
<P>They were taken no Notice of for two or three
Days, but after that, abundance of People ran out
of the Town to look at them, and all the Country
was alarmed about them. The People at first seem'd
afraid to come near them, and on the other Hand
they desir'd the People to keep off, for there was a
Rumour that the Plague was at <HI>Waltham,</HI> and that it
had been in <HI>Epping</HI> two or three Days So <HI>John</HI> called
out to them not to come to them, <HI>For,</HI> says he, <HI>we
are all whole and sound People here, and we would not
have you bring the Plague among us, nor pretend we
brought it among you.</HI></P>
<P>After this the Parish Officers came up to them
and parly'd with them at a Distance, and desir'd to
know who they were and by what Authority they
pretended to fix their Stand at that Place? <HI>John</HI>
answered very frankly, they were poor distressed
People from <HI>London,</HI> who foreseeing the Misery they
should be reduc'd to, if the Plague spread into the
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
City, had fled out in time for their Lives, and ha∣ving
no Acquaintance or Relations to fly to, had
first taken up at <HI>Islington</HI> but the Plague being come
into that Town, were fled further, and as they sup∣pos'd
that the People of <HI>Epping</HI> might have refus'd
them coming into their Town, they had pitch'd their
Tents thus in the open Field, and in the Forest,
being willing to bear all the Hardships of such
a disconsolate Lodging, rather than have any one
think or be afraid that they should receive Injury
by them.</P>
<P>At first the <HI>Epping</HI> People talk'd roughly to them,
and told them they must remove; that this was no
Place for them; and that they pretended to be
Sound and Well, but that they might be infected
with the Plague for ought they knew, and might
infect the whole Country, and they cou'd not suffer
them there.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> argu'd very calmly with them a great while,
and told them, “That <HI>London</HI> was the Place by
which they, that is, the Townsmen of <HI>Epping</HI> and
all the Country round them, subsisted▪ to whom
they sold the produce of their Lands, and out of
whom they made the Rent of their Farms; and
to be so cruel to the Inhabitants of <HI>London▪</HI> or
to any of those by whom they gain'd so much
was very hard, and they would be loth to have
it remembered hereafter, and have it told how
barbarous, how unhospitable and how unkind
they were to the People of <HI>London,</HI> when they
fled from the Face of the most terrible Enemy
in the World; that it would be enough to make
the Name of an <HI>Epping-</HI>Man hateful thro' all the
City, and to have the Rabble Stone them in the
very Streets, whenever they came so much as to
Market; that they were not yet secure from being
Visited themselves, and that as he heard, <HI>Waltham</HI>
was already; that they would think it very hard
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
that when any of them fled for Fear before
they were touch'd, they should be deny'd the
Liberty of lying so much as in the open Fields.”</P>
<P>The <HI>Epping</HI> Men told them again, That they, in∣deed,
said they were sound and free from the In∣fection,
but that they had no assurance of it; and
that it was reported, that there had been a great
Rabble of People at <HI>Walthamstow,</HI> who made such
Pretences of being sound, as they did, but that they
threaten'd to plunder the Town, and force their
Way whether the Parish Officers would or no:
That they were near 200 of them, and had Arms
and Tents like Low-Country Soldiers; that they
extorted Provisions from the Town by threat∣ning
them with living upon them at free Quarter,
shewing their Arms, and talking in the Language
of Soldiers; and that several of them being gone
away towards <HI>Rumford</HI> and <HI>Brent-Wood,</HI> the Coun∣try
had been infected by them, and the Plague
spread into both those large Towns, so that the
People durst not go to Market there as usual; that
it was very likely they were some of that Party,
and if so, they deserv'd to be sent to the County
Jail, and be secur'd till they had made Satisfaction
for the Damage they had done, and for the Terror
and Fright they had put the Country into.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> answered, That what other People had done
was nothing to them▪ that he assured them they
were all of one Company; that they had never
been more in Number than they saw them at that
time; (which by the way was very true) that they
came out in two seperate Companies, but joyn'd
by the Way, their Cases being the same; that
they were ready to give what Account of them∣selves
any Body cou'd desire of them, and to give
in their Names and Places of Abode, that so they
might be call'd to an Account for any Disorder
that they might be guilty of; that the Townsmen
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
might see they were content to live hardly, and
only desir'd a little Room to breath in on the Fo∣rest
where it was wholsome, for where it was not
they cou'd not stay, and wou'd decamp if they
found it otherwise there.</P>
<P>But, said the Townsmen, we have a great charge
of Poor upon our Hands already, and we must take
care not to encrease it; we suppose you can give us
no Security against your being chargeable to our
Parish and to the Inhabitants, any more than you
can of being dangerous to us as to the Infection.</P>
<P>“Why look you, <HI>says John,</HI> as to being charge∣able
to you, we hope we shall not; if you will re∣lieve
us with Provisions for our present Necessity,
we will be very thankful; as we all liv'd without
Charity when we were at Home, so we will o∣blige
ourselves fully to repay you, if God please
to bring us back to our own Families and Houses
in Safety, and to restore Health to the People of
<HI>London.</HI>”</P>
<P>“As to our dying here, we assure you, if any of
us die, we that survive, will bury them, and put
you to no Expence, except it should be that we
should all die, and then indeed the last Man not
being able to bury himself, would put you to that
single Expence which I am perswaded, says <HI>John,</HI>
he would leave enough behind him to pay you for
the Expence of.”</P>
<P>“On the other Hand, says <HI>John,</HI> if you will shut
up all Bowels of Compassion and not relieve us
at all, we shall not extort any thing by Violence,
or steal from any one; but when what little we
have is spent, if we perish for want, God's Will
be done.”</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> wrought so upon the Townsmen by talking
thus rationally and smoothly to them, that they
went away; and tho' they did not give any consent
to their staying there, yet they did not molest them;
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
and the poor People continued there three or four
Days longer without any Disturbance. In this
time they had got some remote Acquaintance with
a Victualling-House at the out-skirts of the Town,
to whom they called at a Distance to bring some
little Things that they wanted, and which they
caus'd to to be set down at a Distance, and always
paid for very honestly.</P>
<P>During this Time, the younger People of the
Town came frequently pretty near them, and wou'd
stand and look at them, and sometimes talk with
them at some Space between; and particularly it was
observed, that the first Sabbath Day the poor People
kept retir'd, worship'd God together, and were heard
to sing Psalms.</P>
<P>These Things and a quiet inoffensive Behaviour,
began to get them the good Opinion of the Coun∣try,
and People began to pity them and speak very
well of them; the Consequence of which was,
that upon the occasion of a very wet rainy
Night, a certain Gentleman who liv'd in the
Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghbourhood, sent them a little Cart with twelve
Trusses of Bundles of Straw, as well for them to
lodge upon, as to cover and thatch their Huts, and
to keep them dry: The Minister of a Parish not
far off, not knowing of the other, sent them also
about two Bushels of Wheat, and half a Bushel of
white Peas.</P>
<P>They were very thankful to-be-sure for this Relief,
and particularly the Straw was a very great Comfort
to them; for tho' the ingenious Carpenter had made
Frames for them to lie in like Troughs, and fill'd them
with Leaves of Trees, and such Things as they could
get, and had cut all their Tent-cloth out to make
them Coverlids, yet they lay damp, and hard, and
unwhol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>some till this Straw came, which was to
them like Feather-beds, and, as <HI>John</HI> said, more wel∣come
than Feather-beds wou'd ha' been at another
time.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169"/>
This Gentleman and the Minister having thus
begun and given an Example of Charity to these
Wanderers, others quickly followed, and they re∣ceiv'd
every Day some Benevolence or other from the
People, but chiefly from the Gentlemen who dwelt
in the Country round about; some sent them Chairs,
Stools, Tables, and such Houshold Things as they
gave Notice they wanted; some sent them Blan∣kets,
Rugs and Coverlids; some Earthen-ware; and
some Kitchin-ware for ordering their Food.</P>
<P>Encourag'd by this good Usage, their Carpenter
in a few Days, built them a large Shed or House
with Rafters, and a Roof in Form, and an upper
Floor in which they lodged warm, for the Weather
began to be damp and cold in the beginning of <HI>Sep∣tember;</HI>
But this House being very well Thatch'd,
and the Sides and Roof made very thick, kept out
the Cold well enough: He made also an earthen
Wall at one End, with a Chimney in it; and ano∣ther
of the Company, with a vast deal of Trouble
and Pains, made a Funnel to the Chimney to car∣ry
out the Smoak.</P>
<P>Here they liv'd very comfortably, tho' coarsely,
till the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> when they had the
bad News to hear, whether true or not, that the
Plague, which was very hot at <HI>Waltham-Abby</HI> on
one side, and at <HI>Rumford</HI> and <HI>Brent-Wood</HI> on the
other side; was also come to <HI>Epping,</HI> to <HI>Woodford,</HI>
and to most of the Towns upon the Forest, and
which, as they said, was brought down among them
chiefly by the Higlers and such People as went to
and from <HI>London</HI> with Provisions.</P>
<P>If this was true, it was an evident Contradiction
to that Report which was afterwards spread all over
<HI>England,</HI> but which, <HI>as I have said,</HI> I cannot confirm of
my own Knowledge, namely, That the Market People
carrying Provisions to the City, never got the Infec∣tion
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
or carry'd it back into the Country; both which
I have been assured, has been false.</P>
<P>It might be that they were preserv'd even beyond
Expectation, though not to a Miracle, that abun∣dance
went and co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and were not touch'd,
and that was much for the Encouragement of the
poor People of <HI>London,</HI> who had been compleatly
miserable, if the People that brought Provisions
to the Markets had not been many times wonder∣fully
preserv'd, or at lea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t more preserv'd than cou'd
be reasonably expected.</P>
<P>But now these new Inmates began to be disturb'd
more effectually, for the Towns about them were re∣ally
infected, and they began to be afraid to trust
one another so much as to go abroad for such things
as they wanted, and this pinch'd them very hard;
for now they had little or nothing but what the cha∣ritable
Gentlemen of the Country supply'd them
with: But for their Encouragement it happen'd, that
other Gentlemen in the Country who had not sent 'em
any thing before, began to hear of them and supply
them, and one sent them a large Pig, that is to say
a Porker; another two Sheep; and another sent
them a Calf: In short, they had Meat enough, and,
sometimes had Cheese and Milk, and all such things;
They were chiesly put to it for Bread, for when the
Gentlemen sent them Corn they had no where to

two Bushel of Wheat that was sent them in parched
Corn, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old did without grinding or
making Bread of it.</P>
<P>At last they found means to carry their Corn to a
Windmill near <HI>Woodford,</HI> where they had it ground;
and af<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erwards the Biscuit Baker made a Hearth so
hollow and dry that he cou'd bake Biscuit Cakes
tolerably well; and thus they came into a Condition
to live without any assistance or supplies from the
Towns; and it was well they did, for the Country
was soon after fully Infected, and about 120 were
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
said to have died of the Distemper in the Villages
near them, which was a terrible thing to them.</P>
<P>On this they call'd a new Council, and now the
Towns had no need to be afraid they should settle
near them, but on the contrary several Families of
the poorer sort of the Inhabitants quitted their Hou∣ses,
and built Hutts in the Forest after the same
manner as they had done: But it was observ'd, that
several of these poor People that had so remov'd,
had the Sickness even in their Hutts or Booths; the
Reason of which was plain, namely, not because they
removed into the Air, but because they did not re∣move
time enough, that is to say, not till by openly
conversing with the other People their Neighbours,
they had the Distemper upon them, or, (as may be
said) among them, and so carry'd it about them whi∣ther
they went: Or, (2.) Because they were not
careful enough after they were safely removed out
of the Towns, not to come in again and mingle with
the diseased People.</P>
<P>But be it which of these it will, when our Tra∣vellers
began to perceive that the Plague was not
only in the Towns, but even in the Tents and Huts
on the Forest near them, they began then not only
to be afraid, but to think of decamping and remo∣ving;
for had they stay'd, they wou'd ha' been in
manifest Danger of their Lives.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered that they were greatly
afflicted, as being obliged to quit the Place where
they had been so kindly receiv'd, and where they
had been treated with so much Humanity and Cha∣rity;
but Necessity, and the hazard of Life, which
they came out so far to preserve, prevail'd with
them, and they saw no Remedy. <HI>John</HI> however
thought of a Remedy for their present Misfortune,
namely, that he would first acquaint that Gentleman
who was their principal Benefactor, with the Distress
they were in, and to crave his Assistance and Ad∣vice.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172"/>
The good charitable Gentleman encourag'd them
to quit the Place, for fear they should be cut off
from any Retreat at all, by the Violence of the Di∣stemper;
but whither they should go, that he found
very hard to direct them to. At last <HI>John</HI> ask'd of
him, whether he (being a Justice of the Peace) would
give them Certificates of Health to other Justices
who they might come before, that so whatever might
be their Lot they might not be repulsed now they
had been also so long from <HI>London.</HI> This his Wor∣ship
immediately granted, and gave them proper
Letters of Health, and from thence they were at Li∣berty
to travel whither they pleased.</P>
<P>Accordingly they had a full Certificate of Health,
intimating, That they had resided in a Village in the
County of <HI>Essex</HI> so long, that being examined and scru∣tiniz'd
sufficiently, and having been retir'd from all
Conversation for above 40 Days, without any appear∣ance
of Sickness, they were therefore certainly conclu∣ded
to be Sound Men, and might be safely entertain'd
any where, having at last remov'd rather for fear of
the Plague, which was come into <HI>such a Town,</HI> ra∣ther
than for having any signal of Infection upon
them, or upon any belonging to them.</P>
<P>With this Certificate they remov'd, tho' with
great Reluctance; and <HI>John</HI> inclining not to go far
from Home, they mov'd towards the Marshes on
the side of <HI>Waltham:</HI> But here they found a Man,
who it seems kept a Weer or Stop upon the River,
made to raise the Water for the Barges which go
up and down the River, and he terrified them with
dismal Stories of the Sickness having been spread in∣to
all the Towns on the River, and near the River,
on the side of <HI>Middlesex</HI> and <HI>Hertfordshire;</HI> that is to
say, into <HI>Waltham, Waltham-Cross, Enfield</HI> and <HI>Ware,</HI>
and all the Towns on the Road, that they were a∣fraid
to go that way; tho' it seems the Man impos'd
upon them, for that the thing was not really true.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173"/>
However it terrified them, and they resolved to
move cross the Forest towards <HI>Rumford</HI> and <HI>Brent-Wood;</HI>
but they heard that there were numbers of
People fled out of <HI>London</HI> that way, who lay up and
down in the Forest call'd <HI>Henalt</HI> Forest, reaching
near <HI>Rumford,</HI> and who having no Subsistence or Ha∣bitation,
not only liv'd oddly, and suffered great Ex∣tremities
in the Woods and Fields for want of Re∣lief,
but were said to be made so desperate by those
Extremities, as that they offer'd many Violences to
the County, robb'd and plunder'd, and kill'd Cattle,
and the like; that others building Hutts and Hovels
by the Road-side Begg'd, and that with an Impor∣tunity
next Door to demanding Relief; so that the
County was very uneasy, and had been oblig'd to
take some of them up.</P>
<P>This, in the first Place intimated to them, that they
would be sure to find the Charity and Kindness of
the County, which they had found here where they
were before, hardned and shut up against them; and
that on the other Hand, they would be question'd
where-ever they came, and would be in Danger of
Violence from others in like Cases as themselves.</P>
<P>Upon all these Considerations, <HI>John,</HI> their Cap∣tain,
in all their Names, went back to their good
Friend and Benefactor, who had reliev'd them be∣fore,
and laying their Case truly before him, hum∣bly
ask'd his Advice; and he as kindly advised
them to take up their old Quarters again, or if not,
to remove but a little further out of the Road,
and directed them to a proper Place for them;
and as they really wanted some House rather than
Huts to shelter them at that time of the Year, it
growing on towards <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> they found an old
decay'd House, which had been formerly some Cot∣tage
or little Habitation, but was so out of repair
as scarce habitable, and by the consent of a Farmer
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
to whose Farm it belong'd, they got leave to make
what use of it they could.</P>
<P>The ingenious Joyner and all the rest by his Di∣rections,
went to work with it, and in a very few
Days made it capable to shelter them all in case of
bad Weather, and in which there was an old Chim∣ney,
and an old Oven, tho' both lying in Ruins,
yet they made them both fit for Use, and raising
Additions, Sheds, and Leantoo's on every side, they
soon made the House capable to hold them all.</P>
<P>They chiefly wanted Boards to make Window-shutters,
Floors, Doors, and several other Things;
but as the Gentlemen above favour'd them, and the
Country was by that Means made easy with them,
and above all, that they were known to be all sound
and in good health, every Body help'd them with
what they could spare.</P>
<P>Here they encamp'd for good and all, and resolv'd
to remove no more; they saw plainly how terribly
alarm'd that County was every where, at any Body
that came from <HI>London;</HI> and that they should have
no admittance any where but with the utmost Dif∣ficulty,
at least no friendly Reception and Assi∣stance
as they had receiv'd here.</P>
<P>Now altho' they receiv'd great Assistance and En∣couragement
from the Country Gentlemen and from
the People round about them, yet they were put to
great Straits, for the Weather grew cold and wet in
<HI>October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> and they had not been us'd to so
much hardship; so that they got Colds in their Limbs,
and Distempers, but never had the Infection: And
thus about <HI>December</HI> they came home to the City
again.</P>
<P>I give this Story thus at large, principally to give
an Account what became of the great Numbers of
People which immediately appear'd in the City
as soon as the Sickness abated: For, as I have said,
great Numbers of those that were able and had
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
Retreats in the Country, fled to those Retreats;
So when it was encreased to such a frightful Extre∣mity
as I have related, the midling People who had
not Friends, fled to all Parts of the Country where
they cou'd get shelter, as well those that had Mony
to relieve themselves; as those that had not. Those
that had Mony always fled farthest, because they
were able to subsist themselves; but those who were
empty, suffer'd, as I have said, great Hardships, and
were often driven by Necessity to relieve their Wants
at the Expence of the Country: By that Means the
Country was made very uneasie at them, and some∣times
took them up, tho' even then they scarce knew
what to do with them, and were always very back∣ward
to punish them, but often too they forced
them from Place to Place, till they were oblig'd to
come back again to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I have, since my knowing this Story of <HI>John</HI> and
his Brother, enquir'd and found, that there were a
great many of the poor disconsolate People, as above,
fled into the Country every way, and some of them
got little Sheds, and Barns, and Out-houses to
live in, where they cou'd obtain so much Kind∣ness
of the Country, and especially where they had
any the least satisfactory Account to give of them∣selves,
and particularly that they did not come out of
<HI>London</HI> too late. But others, and that in great Num∣bers,
built themselves little Hutts and Retreats in the
Fields and Woods, and liv'd like Hermits in Holes
and Caves, or any Place they cou'd find; and where,
we may be sure, they suffer'd great Extremities,
such that many of them were oblig'd to come back
again whatever the Danger was; and so those little
Huts were often found empty, and the Country
People suppos'd the Inhabitants lay Dead in them of
the Plague, and would not go near them for fear, no
not in a great while; nor is it unlikely but that some of
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
the unhappy Wanderers might die so all alone, even
sometimes for want of Help, as particularly in one
Tent or Hutt, was found a Man dead, and on the
Gate of a Field just by, was cut with his Knife in
uneven Letters, the following Words, by which it
may be suppos'd the other Man escap'd, or that one
dying first, the other bury'd him as well as he could;
<Q><L>Om Is ErY!</L>
<L>We BoTH ShaLL DyE,</L>
<L>WoE, WoE.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have given an Account already of what I found to
ha' been the Case down the River among the Sea-faring
Men, how the Ships lay in the <HI>Offing,</HI> as 'tis call'd,
in Rows or Lines a-stern of one another, quite
down from the <HI>Pool</HI> as far as I could see, I have been
told, that they lay in the same manner quite down
the River as low as <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and some far beyond,
even every where, or in every Place where they
cou'd ride with Safety as to Wind and Weather;
Nor did I ever hear that the Plague reach'd to any
of the People on board those Ships, except such
as lay up in the <HI>Pool,</HI> or as high as <HI>Deptford</HI> Reach,
altho' the People went frequently on Shoar to the
Country Towns and Villages, and Farmers Houses,
to buy fresh Provisions, Fowls, Pigs, Calves, and the
like for their Supply.</P>
<P>Likewise I found that the Watermen on the Ri∣ver
above the Bridge, found means to convey them∣selves
away up the River as far as they cou'd go;
and that they had, many of them, their whole Fa∣milies
in their Boats, cover'd with Tilts and Bales,
as they call them, and furnish'd with Straw within
for their Lodging; and that they lay thus all along
by the Shoar in the Marshes, some of them setting
up little Tents with their Sails, and so lying under
them on Shoar in the Day, and going into their
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
Boats at Night; and in this manner, as I have
heard, the River-sides were lin'd with Boats and
People as long as they had any thing to subsist on,
or cou'd get any thing of the Country; and indeed
the Country People, as well Gentlemen as others,
on these and all other Occasions, were very forward
to relieve them, but they were by no means willing
to receive them into their Towns and Houses, and
for that we cannot blame them.</P>
<P>There was one unhappy Citizen, within my
Knowledge, who had been Visited in a dreadful
manner, so that his Wife and all his Children were
Dead, and himself and two Servants only left, with
an elderly Woman a near Relation, who had nurs'd
those that were dead as well as she could: This dis∣consolate
Man goes to a Village near the Town,
tho' not within the Bills of Mortality, and finding
an empty House there, enquires out the Owner,
and took the House: After a few Days he got a Cart
and loaded it with Goods, and carries them down
to the House; the People of the Village oppos'd his
driving the Cart along, but with some Arguings,
and some Force, the Men that drove the Cart along,
got through the Street up to the Door of the House,
there the Constable resisted him again, and would
not let them be brought in. The Man caus'd the
Goods to be unloaden and lay'd at the Door, and
sent the Cart away; upon which they carry'd the
Man before a Justice of Peace; that is to say, they
commanded him to go, which he did. The Justice
order'd him to cause the Cart to fetch away the
Goods again, which he refused to do; upon which
the Justice order'd the Constable to pursue the Car∣ters
and fetch them back, and make them re-load
the Goods and carry them away, or to set them in
the Stocks till they came for farther Orders; and if
they could not find them, nor the Man would not
consent to take them away, they should cause them
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
to be drawn with Hooks from the House-Door and
burnt in the Street. The poor distress'd Man up∣on
this fetch'd the Goods again, but with grievous
Cries and Lamentations at the hardship of his Case.
But there was no Remedy; Self-preservation oblig'd
the People to those Severities, which they wou'd not
otherwise have been concern'd in: Whether this
poor Man liv'd or dy'd I cannot tell, but it was re∣ported
that he had the Plague upon him at that
time; and perhaps the People might report that to
justify their Usage of him; but it was not unlikely,
that either he or his Goods, or both, were dangerous,
when his whole Family had been dead of the Di∣stemper
so little a while before.</P>
<P>I kno' that the Inhabitants of the Towns adja∣cent
to <HI>London,</HI> were much blamed for Cruelty to the
poor People that ran from the Contagion in their
Distress; and many very severe things were done, as
may be seen from what has been said; but I cannot but
say also that where there was room for Charity and
Assistance to the People, without apparent Danger
to themselves, they were willing enough to help and
relieve them. But as every Town were indeed Judg∣es
in their own Case, so the poor People who ran
a-broad in their Extremities, were often ill-used and
driven back again into the Town; and this caused
infinite Exclamations and Out-cries against the
Country Towns, and made the Clamour very popu∣lar.</P>
<P>And yet more or less, maugre all their Caution,
there was not a Town of any Note within ten (or I
believe twenty) Miles of the City, but what was
more or less Infected, and had some died among
them. I have heard the Accounts of several; such as
they were reckon'd up as follows.</P>

<P>Another thing might render the Country more
strict with respect to the Citizens, and especially
with respect to the Poor; and this was what I hint∣ed
at before, namely, that there was a seeming pro∣pensity,
or a wicked Inclination in those that were
Infected to infect others.</P>
<P>There have been great Debates among our Phy∣sicians,
as to the Reason of this; some will have it
to be in the Nature of the Disease, and that it impres∣ses
every one that is seized upon by it, with a kind of
a Rage, and a hatred against their own Kind, as if
there was a malignity, not only in the Distemper to
communicate it self, but in the very Nature of Man,
prompting him with evil Will, or an evil Eye, that <HI>as
they say</HI> in the Case of a mad Dog, who tho' the gent∣lest
Creature before of any of his Kind, yet then will
fly upon and bite any one that comes next him
and those as soon as any, who had been most observ'd
by him before.</P>
<P>Others plac'd it to the Account of the Corup∣tion
of humane Nature, which cannot bear to see
itself more miserable than others of its own Specie,
and has a kind of involuntary Wish, that all Men
were as unhappy, or in as bad a Condition as itself.</P>
<P>Others say, it was only a kind of Desperation,
not knowing or regarding what they did, and con∣sequently
unconcern'd at the Danger or Safe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, not
only of any Body near them, but even of themselves
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
also: And indeed when Men are once come to a
Condition to abandon themselves, and be uncon∣cern'd
for the Safety, or at the Danger of themselves,
it cannot be so much wondered that they should be
careless of the Safety of other People.</P>
<P>But I choose to give this grave Debate a quite
different turn, and answer it or resoive it all by
saying, <HI>That I do not grant the Fact.</HI> On the con∣trary,
I say, that the Thing is not really so, but
that it was a general Complaint rais'd by the Peo∣ple
inhabiting the out-lying Villages against the Ci∣tizens,
to justify, or at least excuse those Hardships
and Severities so much talk'd of, and in which Com∣plaints,
both Sides may be said to have injur'd one
another; that is to say, the Citizens pressing to be
received and harbour'd in time of Distress, and with
the Plague upon them, complain of the Cruelty and
Injustice of the Country Peeople, in being refused En∣trance,
and forc'd back again with their Goods and Fa∣milies;
and the Inhabitants finding themselves so im∣posed
upon, and the Citizens breaking in as it were
upon them whether they would or no, complain,
that when they were infected, they were not only
regardless of others, but even willing to infect them;
neither of which were really true, that is to say, in
the Colours they were describ'd in.</P>
<P>It is true, there is something to be said for the fre∣quent
Alarms which were given to the Country, of
the resolution of the People in <HI>London</HI> to come out by
Force, not only for Relief, but to Plunder and Rob,
that they ran about the Streets with the Di∣stemper
upon them without any control; and that
no Care was taken to shut up Houses, and confine
the sick People from infecting others; whereas, to
do the <HI>Londoners</HI> Justice, they never practised such
things, except in such particular Cases as I have men∣tion'd
above, and such-like. On the other Handeve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was managed with so much Care, and such
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was observ'd in the whole City and
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
Suburbs, by the Care of the Lord Mayor and Alder∣men;
and by the Justices of the Peace, Churchwar∣dens,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the out-Parts; that <HI>London</HI> may be a Pat∣tern
to all the Cities in the World for the good Govern∣ment
and the excellent Order that was every where
kept, even in the time of the most violent Infection;
and when the People were in the utmost Consterna∣tion
and Distress. But of this I shall speak by itself.</P>
<P>One thing, it is to be observ'd, was owing prin∣cipatly
to the Prudence of the Magistrates, and ought
to be mention'd to their Honour, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Mo∣deration
which they used in the great and difficult
Work of shutting up of Houses: It is true, as I have
mentioned, that the shutting up of Houses was a
great Subject of Discontent, and I may say indeed
the only Subject of Discontent among the People at
that time; for the confining the Sound in the same
House with the Sick, was counted very terrible, and
the Complaints of People so confin'd were very grie∣vous;
they were heard into the very Streets, and
they were sometimes such that called for Resent∣ment,
tho' oftner for Compassion; they had no way
to converse with any of their Friends but out at their
Windows, where they wou'd make such piteous La∣mentations,
as often mov'd the Hearts of those they
talk'd with, and of others who passing by heard their
Story; and as those Complaints oftentimes reproach'd
the Severity, and sometimes the Insolence of the
Watchmen plac'd at their Doors, those Watchmen
wou'd answer saucily enough; and perhaps be apt to
affront the People who were in the Street talking to the
said Families; for which, or for their ill Treatment of
the Families, I think seven or eight of them in se∣veral
Places were kill'd; I know not whether I shou'd
say murthered or not, because I cannot enter into
the particular Cases. It is true, the Watchmen were
on their Duty, and acting in the Post where they
were plac'd by a lawful Authority; and killing any
publick legal Officer in the Execution of his Office,
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
is always in the Language of the Law call'd Murther.
But as they were not authoriz'd by the Magistrate's
Instructions, or by the Power they acted under, to
be injurious or abusive, either to the People who
were under their Observation, or to any that con∣cern'd
themselves for them; so when they did so, they
might be said to act themselves▪ not their Office;
to act as private Persons, not as Persons employ'd;
and consequently if they brought Mischief upon
themselves by such an undue Behaviour, that Mis∣chief
was upon their own Heads; and indeed they
had so much the hearty Curses of the People, whether
they deserv'd it or not, that whatever befel them no
body pitied them, and every Body was apt to say,
they deserv'd it, whatever it was; not do I remem∣ber
that any Body was ever punish'd, at least to any
considerable Degree, for whatever was done to the
Watchmen that guarded their Houses.</P>
<P>What variety of Stratagems were used to escape
and get out of Houses thus shut up, by which the
Watchmen were deceived or overpower'd, and that
the People got away, I have taken notice of alrea∣dy,
and shall say no more to that: But I say the Ma∣gistrates
did moderate and ease Families upon many
Occasions in this Case, and particularly in that of ta∣king
away, or suffering to be remov'd the sick Persons
out of such Houses, when they were willing to be re∣mov'd
either to a Pest-House, or other Places, and
sometimes giving the well Persons in the Family so
shut up, leave to remove upon Information given
that they were well, and that they would confine them∣selves
in such Houses where they went, so long as
should be requir'd of them. The Concern also of the
Magistrates for the supplying such poor Families as
were infected; I say, supplying them with Necessa∣ries,
as well Physick as Food, was very great, and in
which they did not content themselves with giving
the necessary Orders to the Officers appointed, but
the Aldermen in Person, and on Horseback frequently
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
rid to such Houses, and caus'd the People to be ask'd
at their Windows, whether they were duly attend∣ed,
or not? Also, whether they wanted any thing
that was necessary, and if the Officers had constant∣ly
carry'd their Messages, and fetch'd them such things
as they wanted, or not? And if they answered in the
Affirmative, all was well; but if they complain'd,
that they were ill supply'd, and that the Officer did
not do his Duty, or did not treat them civilly, they
(the Officers) were generally remov'd, and others
plac'd in their stead.</P>
<P>It is true, such Complaint might be unjust, and
if the Officer had such Arguments to use as would
convince the Magistrate, that he was right, and that the
People had injur'd him, he was continued, and they
reproved. But this part could not well bear a par∣ticular
Inquiry, for the Parties could very ill be
brought face to face, and a Complaint could not be
well heard and answer'd in the Street, from the Win∣dows,
as was the Case then; the Magistrates there∣fore
generally chose to favour the People, and remove
the Man, as what seem'd to be the least Wrong, and of
the least ill Consequence; seeing, if the Watchman was
injur'd yet they could readily make him amends by
giving him another Post of the like Nature; but if
the Family was injur'd, there was no Satisfaction
could be made to them, the Damage perhaps being
irreparable, as it concern'd their Lives.</P>
<P>A great variety of these Cases frequently happen'd
between the Watchmen and the poor People shut up,
besides those I formerly mention'd about escaping;
sometimes the Watchmen were absent, sometimes
durnk, sometimes asleep when the People wanted
them, and such never fail'd to be punish'd severely, as
indeed they deserv'd.</P>
<P>But after all that was or could be done in these Ca∣ses,
the shutting up of Houses, so as to confine those
that were well, with those that were sick, had very
great Inconveniences in it, and some that were very
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
tragical, and which merited to have been consider'd
if there had been room for it; but it was authoriz'd
by a Law, it had the publick Good in view, as the
End chiefly aim'd at, and all the private Injuries that
were done by the putting it in Execution, must be
put to the account of the publick Benefit.</P>
<P>It is doubtful to this day, whether in the
whole it contributed any thing to the stop of the
Infection, and indeed, I cannot say it did; for no∣thing
could run with greater Fury and Rage than
the Infection did when it was in its chief Violence;
tho' the Houses infected were shut up as exactly, and
as effectually as it was possible. Certain it is, that if
all the infected Persons were effectually shut in, no
sound Person could have been infected by them, be∣cause
they could not have come near them. But the
Case was this, and I shall only touch it here, name∣ly,
that the Infection was propagated insensibly, and
by such Persons as were not visibly infected, who nei∣ther
knew who they infected, or who they were in∣fected
by.</P>
<P>A House in <HI>White-Chapel</HI> was shut up for the sake
of one infected Maid, who had only Spots, not the
Tokens come out upon her, and recover'd; yet these
People obtain'd no Liberty to stir, neither for Air or
Exercise forty Days; want of Breath, Fear, Anger,
Vexation, and all the other Griefs attending such an
injurious Treatment, cast the Mistress of the Fami∣ly
into a Fever, and Visitors came into the House,
and said it was the Plague, tho' the Physicians declar'd
it was not; however the Family were oblig'd to be∣gin
their Quarantine anew, on the Report of the Vi∣sitor
or Examiner, tho' their former Quarantine
wanted but a few Days of being finish'd. This op∣press'd
them so with Anger and Grief, and, <HI>as before,</HI>
straiten'd them also so much as to Room, and for
want of Breathing and free Air, that most of the Fa∣mily
fell sick, one of one Distemper, one of another,
chiefly Scorbutick Ailments; <HI>only one a violent Cholick,</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
'till after several prolongings of their Confinement'
some or other of those that came in with the Visitors
to inspect the Persons that were ill, in hopes of re∣leasing
them, brought the Diftemper with them, and
infected the whole House, and all or most of them
died, not of the Plague, as really upon them before,
but of the Plague that those People brought them, who
should ha' been careful to have protected them from it;
and this was a thing which frequently happen'd, and
was indeed one of the worst Consequences of shutting
Houses up.</P>
<P>I had about this time a little Hardship put upon
me, which I was at first greatly afflicted at, and very
much disturb'd about; tho' as it prov'd, it did not ex∣pose
me to any Disaster; and this was being appointed
by the Alderm in of <HI>Portsoken</HI> Ward, one of the Exa∣miners
of the Houses in the Precinct where I liv'd;
we had a large Parish, and had no less than eighteen
Examiners, as the Order call'd us, the People call'd
us Visitors. I endeavour'd with all my might to be
excus'd from such an Employment▪ and used many Ar∣guments
with the Alderman's Deputy to be excus'd;
particularly I alledged, that I was against shutting
up Houses at all, and that it would be very hard to
oblige me, to be an Instrument in that which was a∣gainst
my Judgment, and which I did verily believe
would not answer the End it was intended for, but all
the Abatement I could get was only, that whereas
the Officer was appointed by my Lord Mayor to con∣tinue
two Months, I should be obliged to hold it but
three Weeks, on Condition, nevertheless that I could
then get some other sufficient House-keeper to serve
the rest of the Time for me, which was, in short, but
a very small Favour, it being very difficult to get any
Man to accept of such an Employment, that was fit
to be intrusted with it.</P>
<P>It is true that shutting up of Houses had one Ef∣fect,
which I am sensible was of Moment, namely,
it confin'd the distemper'd People, who would other∣wise
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
have been both very troublesome and very dan∣gerous
in their running about Streets with the Di∣stemper
upon them, which when they were dilirious,
they would have done in a most frightful manner; and
as indeed they began to do at first very much, 'till
they were thus restrain'd; nay, so very open they were,
that the Poor would go about and beg at peoples
Doors, and say they had the Plague upon them, and
beg Rags for their Sores, or both, or any thing
that dilirious Nature happen'd to think of.</P>
<P>A poor uuhappy Gentlcwoman, a substantial Ci∣tizen's
Wife was (if the Story be true) murther'd
by one of these Creatures in <HI>Aldersgate-street,</HI> or that
Way: He was going along the Street, raving mad to
be sure, and singing, the People only said, he was
drunk; but he himself said, he had the Plague upon
him, which, it seems, was true; and meeting this
Gentlewoman, he would kiss her; she was terribly
frighted as he was only a rude Fellow, and she run
from him, but the Street being very thin of People,
there was no body near enough to help her: When she
see he would overtake her, she turn'd, and gave him
a Thrust so forcibly, he being but weak, and push'd
him down backward: But very unhappily, she being
so near, he caught hold of her, and pull'd her down
also; and getting up first, master'd her, and kiss'd
her; and which was worst of all, when he had done,
told her he had the Plague, and why should not she
have it as well as he. She was frighted enough be∣fore,
being also young with Child; but when she
heard him say, he had the Plague, she scream'd out
and fell down in a Swoon, or in a Fit, which tho'
she recover'd a little, yet kill'd her in a very few
Days, and I never heard whether she had the Plague
or no.</P>
<P>Another infected Person came, and knock'd at the
Door of a Citizen's House, where they knew him very
well; the Servant let him in, and being told the Ma∣ster
of the House was above, he ran up, and came
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
into the Room to them as the whole Family was at
upper: They began to rise up a little surpriz'd,
not kw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing what the Matter was, but he bid
them sit still, he only came to take his leave of them.
They ask'd him, Why Mr.—where are you go∣ing?
Going, says he, I have got the Sickness, and
shall die to morrow Night. 'Tis easie to believe,
though not to describe the Consternation they were
all in, the Women and the Man's Daughters which
were but little Girls, were frighted almost to Death,
and got up, one running out at one Door, and one
at another, some down-Stairs and some up-Stairs,
and getting together as well as they could, lock'd
themselves into their Chambers, and screamed out
at the Window for Help, as if they had been frighted
out of their Wits: The Master more compos'd than
they, tho' both frighted and provok'd, was going
to lay Hands on him, and thro' him down Stairs,
being in a Passion, but then considering a little the
Condition of the Man and the Danger of touching
him, Horror seiz'd his Mind, and he stood still like
one astonished. The poor distemper'd Man all this
while, being as well diseas'd in his Brain as in his
Body, stood still like one amaz'd; at length he turns
round, <HI>Ay! says he,</HI> with all the seeming calmness
imaginable, <HI>Is it so with you all! Are you all disturb'd
at me? why then I'll e'en go home and die there.</HI> And
so he goes immediately down Stairs: The Servant
that had let him in goes down after him with a Can∣dle,
but was afraid to go past him and open the
Door, so he stood on the Stairs to see what he wou'd
do; the Man went and open'd the Door, and went
out and flung the Door after him: It was some
while before the Family recover'd the Fright, but
as no ill Consequence attended, they have had occa∣sion
since to speak of it (you may be sure) with
great Satisfaction. Tho' the Man was gone it was
some time, nay as I heard, some Days before they re∣cover'd
themselves of the Hurry they were in, nor
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
did they go up and down the House with any assu∣rance,
till they had burnt a great variety of Fumes
and Perfumes in all the Rooms, and made a great
many Smoaks of Pitch, of Gunpowder, and of Sul∣phur,
all separately shifted; and washed their Clothes,
and the like: As to the poor Man whether he liv'd or
dy'd I don't remember.</P>
<P>It is most certain, that if by the Shutting up of
Houses the sick had not been confin'd, multitudes
who in the height of their Fever were Dilirious and
Distracted, wou'd ha' been continually running up
and down the Streets, and even as it was a very
great number did so, and offer'd all sorts of Violence
to those they met, even just as a mad Dog runs on
and bites at every one he meets; nor can I doubt but
that shou'd one of those infected diseased Creatures
have bitten any Man or Woman, while the Frenzy
of the Distemper was upon them, they, I mean the
Person so wounded, wou'd as certainly ha' been in∣curably
infected, as one that was sick before and had
the Tokens upon him.</P>
<P>I heard of one infected Creature, who running out
of his Bed in his Shirt, in the anguish and agony of
his Swellings, of which he had three upon him, got
his Shoes on and went to put on his Coat, but the
Nurse resisting and snatching the Coat from him, he
threw her down, run over her, run down Stairs
and into the Street directly to the <HI>Thames</HI> in his
Shirt, the Nurse running after him, and calling to
the Watch to stop him; but the Watchmen fright∣ed
at the Man, and afraid to touch him, let him go
on; upon which he ran down to the Still-yard Stairs,
threw away his Shirt, and plung'd into the <HI>Thames,</HI>
and, being a good swimmer, swam quite over the
River; and the Tide being coming in, as they call
it, that is running West-ward, he reached the Land
not till he came about the Falcon Stairs, where land∣ing,
and finding no People there, it being in the Night,
he ran about the Streets there, Naked as he was, for
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
a good while, when it being by that time High-water,
he takes the River again, and swam back to the Still-yard,
landed, ran up the Streets again to his own
House, knocking at the Door, went up the Stairs,
and into his Bed again; and that this terrible Expe∣riment
cur'd him of the Plague, that is to say, that
the violent Motion of his Arms and Legs stretch'd
the Parts where the Swellings he had upon him were,
that is to say under his Arms and his Groin, and
caused them to ripen and break; and that the cold
of the Water abated the Fever in his Blood.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that I do not relate this any
more than some of the other, as a Fact within my
own Knowledge, so as that I can vouch the Truth of
them, and especially that of the Man being cur'd by
the extravagant Adventure, which I confess I do not
think very possible, but it may serve to confirm the
many desperate Things which the distress'd People
falling into, Diliriums, and what we call Lighthead∣edness,
were frequently run upon at that time, and
how infinitely more such there wou'd ha' been, if
such People had not been confin'd by the shutting up
of Houses; and this I take to be the best, <HI>if n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the
only good thing</HI> which was perform'd by that severe
Method.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Complaints and the Mur∣murings
were very bitter against the thing itself.</P>
<P>It would pierce the Hearts of all that came by
to hear the piteous Cries of those infected People, who
being thus out of their Understandings by the Vio∣lence
of their Pain, or the heat of their Blood, were
either shut in, or perhaps ty'd in their Beds and Chairs,
to prevent their doing themselves Hurt, and who
wou'd make a dreadful outcry at their being confin'd,
and at their being not permitted to die at large, as
they call'd it, and as they wou'd ha' done before.</P>
<P>This running of distemper'd People about the
Streets was very dismal, and the Magistrates did
their utmost to prevent it, but as it was generally in
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
the Night and always sudden, when such attempts were
made, the Officers cou'd not be at hand to prevent it,
and even when any got out in the Day, the Officers
appointed did not care to meddle with them, because,
as they were all grievously infected to <HI>besure</HI> when they
were come to that Height, so they were more than
ordinarily infectious, and it was one of the most dan∣gerous
Things that cou'd be to touch them; on the
other Hand, they generally ran, on not knowing what
they did, till they dropp'd down stark Dead, or till
they had exhausted their Sptrits so, as that they wou'd
fall and then die in perhaps half an Hour or an Hour,
and which was most piteous to hear, they were sure
to come to themselves intirely in that half Hour or
Hour, and then to make most grievous and piercing
Cries and Lamentations in the deep afflicting Sense
of the Condition they were in. This was much of it
before the Order for shutting up of Houses was strict∣ly
put in Execution, for at first the Watchmen were
not so vigorous and severe, as they were after∣ward
in the keeping the People in; that is to say, be∣fore
they were, I mean some of them, severely pu∣nish'd
for their Neglect, failing in their Duty, and
letting People who were under their Care slip away,
or connniving at their going abroad whether sick or
well. But after they saw the Officers appointed to
examine into their Conduct, were resolv'd to have
them do their Duty, or be punish'd for the omission,
they were more exact, and the People were strictly
restrain'd; which was a thing they took so ill, and
bore so impatiently, that their Discontents can hard∣ly
be describ'd: Bet there was an absolute Necessity
for it, that must be confess'd, unless some other Mea∣sures
had been timely enter'd upon, and it was too
late for that.</P>
<P>Had not this particular of the Sick's been restrain'd
as above, been our Case at that time, <HI>London</HI> wou'd
ha' been the most dreadful Place that ever was in
the World, there wou'd for ought I kno' have as
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
many People dy'd in the Streets as dy'd in their
Houses; for when the Distmper was at its height,
it generally made them Raving and Dilirious, and
when they were so, they wou'd never be perswaded
to keep in their Beds but by Force; and many
who were not ty'd, threw themselves out of Windows,
when they found they cou'd not get leave to go out
of their Doors.</P>
<P>It was for want of People conversing one with a∣nother,
in this time of Calamity, that it was
impossible any particular Person cou'd come at the
Knowledge of all the extraordinary Cases that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c∣curr'd
in different Families; and particularly I be∣lieve
it was never known to this Day how many
People in their Diliriums drowned themselves in the
<HI>Thames,</HI> and in the River which runs from the Mar∣shes
by <HI>Hackney,</HI> which we generally call'd <HI>Ware</HI> River,
or <HI>Hackney</HI> River; as to those which were set down
in the Weekly Bill, they were indeed few; nor cou'd
it be known of any of those, whether they drowned
themselves by Accident or not: But I believe, I
might reckon up more, who, within the compass of
my Knowledge or Observation, really drowned them∣selves
in that Year, than are put down in the Bill of
all put together, for many of the Bodies were never
found, who, yet were known to be so lost; and the like
in other Methods of Self-Destruction. There was also
One Man in or about <HI>Whitecross-street,</HI> burnt himself
to Death in his Bed; some said it was done by him∣self,
others that it was by the Treachery of the
Nurse that attended him; but that he had the Plague
upon him was agreed by all.</P>
<P>It was a merciful Disposition of Providence also,
and which I have many times thought of at that
time, that no Fires, or no considerable ones at least,
happen'd in the City, during that Year, which, if it
had been otherwise, would have been very dreadful;
and either the People must have let them alone un∣quenched,
or have come together in great Crowds
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
and Throngs, unconcern'd at the Danger of the In∣fection,
not concerned at the Houses they went into,
at the Goods they handled, or at the Persons or the
People they came among: But so it was that ex∣cepting
that in <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Parish, and two or three
little Eruptions of Fires, which were presently ex∣tinguish'd,
there was no Disaster of that kind hap∣pen'd
in the whole Year. They told us a Story of
a House in a Place call'd <HI>Swan-A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey,</HI> passing from
<HI>Goswell-street</HI> near the End of <HI>Oldstreet</HI> into <HI>St. John-street,</HI>
that a Family was infected there, in so terri∣ble
a Manner that every one of the House died; the
last Person lay dead on the Floor, and as it is supposed,
had laid her self all along to die just before the Fire;
the Fire, it seems had fallen from its Place, being of
Wood, and had taken hold of the Boards and the Joists
they lay on, and burnt as far as just to the Body, but
had not taken hold of the dead Body, tho' she had lit∣tle
more than her Shift on, and had gone out of itself,
not hurting the Rest of the House, tho' it was a
slight Timber House. How true this might be, I
do not determine, but the City being to suffer se∣verely
the next Year by Fire, this Year it felt very
little of that Calamity.</P>
<P>Indeed considering the Deliriums, which the Ago∣ny
threw People into, and how I have mention'd in
their Madness, when they were alone, they did ma∣ny
desperate Things; it was very strange there were
no more Disasters of that kind.</P>
<P>It has been frequently ask'd me, and I cannot say,
that I ever knew how to give a direct Answer to it,
How it came to pass that so many infected People
appear'd abroad in the Streets, at the same time that
the Houses which were infected were so vigilantly
searched, and all of them shut up and guarded as they
were.</P>
<P>I confess, I know not what Answer to give to this,
unless it be this, that in so great and populous a City
as this is, it was impossible to discover every House
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
that was infected as soon as it was so, or to shut up
all the Houses that were infected: so that People
had the Liberty of going about the Streets, even
where they pleased, unless they were known to be∣long
to such and such infected Houses.</P>
<P>It is true, that as several Physicians told my Lord
Mayor, the Fury of the Contagion was such at some
particular Times, and People sicken'd so fast, and
died, so soon, that it was impossible and indeed to no
purpose to go about to enquire who was sick and who
was well, or to shut them up with such Exactness,
as the thing required; almost every House in a whole
Street being infected, and in many Places every Per∣son
in some of the Houses; and that which was still
worse, by the time that the Houses were known to
be infected, most of the Persons infected would be
stone dead, and the rest run away for Fear of be∣ing
shut up; so that it was to very small Purpose, to
call them infected Houses and shut them up; the
Infection having ravaged, and taken its Leave of the
House, before it was really known, that the Family
was any way touch'd.</P>
<P>This might be sufficient to convince any reason∣able
Person, that as it was not in the Power of the
Magistrates, or of any humane Methods or Policy,
to prevent the spreading the Infection; so that this
way of shutting up of Houses was perfectly insuffi∣cient
for that End. Indeed it seemed to have no man∣ner
of publick Good in it, equal or proportionable
to the grievous Burthen that it was to the particular
Families, that were so shut up; and as far as I was
employed by the publick in directing that Severity,
I frequently found occasion to see, that it was inca∣pable
of answering the End. For Example as I
was desired as a Visitor or Examiner to enquire
into the Particulars of several Families which were
infected, we scarce came to any House where
the Plague had visibly appear'd in the Family, but
that some of the Family were Fled and gone; the
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
Magistrates would resent this, and charge the Exa∣miners
with being remiss in their Examination or
Inspection: But by that means Houses were long in∣fected
before it was known. Now, as I was in this
dangerous Office but half the appointed time, which
was two Months, it was long enough to inform
myself, that we were no way capable of coming at
the Knowledge of the true state of any Family, but
by enquiring at the Door, or of the Neighbours; as
for going into every House to search, that was a part,
no Authority wou'd offer to impose on the Inhabi∣tants,
or any Citizen wou'd undertake, for it wou'd
ha' been exposing us to certain Infection and Death,
and to the Ruine of our own Families as well as of
ourselves, nor wou'd any Citizen of Probity, and
that cou'd be depended upon, have staid in the Town,
if they had been made liable to such a Severity.</P>
<P>Seeing then that we cou'd come at the certainty
of Things by no Method but that of Enquiry of the
Neighbours, or of the Family, and on that we cou'd
not justly depend, it was not possible, but that the
incertainty of this Matter wou'd remain as above.</P>
<P>It is true, Masters of Families were bound by the
Order, to give Notice to the Examiner of the Place
wherein he liv'd, within two Hours after he shou'd
discover it, of any Person being sick in his House,
that is to say, having Signs of the Infection, but they
found so many ways to evade this, and excuse their
Negligence, that they seldom gave that Notice, till
they had taken Measures to have every one Escape out
of the House, who had a mind to Escape, whether
they were Sick or Sound; and while this was so, it
is easie to see, that the shutting up of Houses was
no way to be depended upon, as a sufficient Method
for putting a stop to the Infection, because, as I have
said elsewhere, many of those that so went out of
those infected Houses, had the Plague really upon
them, tho' they might really think themselves Sound:
And some of these were the People that walk'd the
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
Streets till they fell down Dead, not that they were
suddenly struck with the Distemper, as with a
Bullet that kill'd with the Stroke, but that they
really had the Infection in their Blood long before,
only, that, as it prey'd secretly on the Vitals, it ap∣pear'd
not till it seiz'd the Heart with a mortal Pow∣er,
and the Patient died in a Moment, as with a sud∣den
Fainting, or an Apoplectick Fit.</P>
<P>I know that some, even of our Physicians, thought,
for a time, that those People that so died in the
Streets, were seiz'd but that Moment they fell, as if
they had been touch'd by a Stroke from Heaven, as
Men are kill'd by a flash of Lightning; but they found
Reason to alter their Opinion afterward; for upon
examining the Bodies of such after they were Dead,
they always either had Tokens upon them, or other
evident Proofs of the Distemper having been longer
upon them, than they had otherwise expected.</P>
<P>This often was the Reason that, as I have said,
we, that were Examiners, were not able to come at
the Knowledge of the Infection being enter'd into
a House, till it was too late to shut it up; and some∣times
not till the People that were left, were all Dead.
In <HI>Petticoat-Lane</HI> two Houses together were infected,
and several People sick; but the Distemper was so
well conceal'd, the Examiner, who was my Neigh∣bour,
got no Knowledge of it, till Notice was sent
him that the People were all Dead, and that the
Carts should call there to fetch them away. The
two Heads of the Families concerted their Measures,
and so order'd their Matters, as that when the Ex∣aminer
was in the Neighbourhood, they appeared
generally one at a time, and answered, that is, lied
for one another, or got some of the Neighbourhood
to say they were all in Health, and perhaps knew no
better, till Death making it impossible to keep it any
longer as a Secret, the dead-Carts were call'd in
the Night, the Houses to both, and so it became
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
publick: But when the Examiner order'd the Con∣stable
to shut up the Houses, there was no Body left
in them but three People, two in one House, and one
in the other just dying, and a Nurse in each House,
who acknowledg'd that they had buried five before,
that the Houses had been infected nine or ten
Days, and that for all the rest of the two Families,
which were many, they were gone, some sick, some
well, or whether sick or well could not be known.</P>
<P>In like manner, at another House in the same
Lane, a Man having his Family infected, but very
unwilling to be shut up, when he could conceal it
no longer, shut up himself; that is to say, he set the
great red Cross upon his Door with the words LORD
HAVE MERCY UPON US; and so deluded the Exami∣ner,
who suppos'd it had been done by the Constable,
by Order of the other Examiner, for there were two
Examiners to every District or Precinct; by this
means he had free egress and regress into his House
again, and out of it, as he pleas'd notwithstanding it
was infected; till at length his Stratagem was found
out, and then he, with the sound part of his Servants
and Family, made off and escaped; so they were not
shut up at all.</P>
<P>These things made it very hard, if not impossible,
<HI>as I have said,</HI> to prevent the spreading of an Infec∣tion
by the shutting up of Houses, unless the Peo∣ple
would think the shutting up of their Houses no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Grievance, and be so willing to have it done, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
the Terror and Consternation which the Thing
put them into.</P>
<P>I got myself discharg'd of the dangerous Office I
was in, as soon as I cou'd get another admitted, who
I had obtain'd for a little Mony to accept of it; and
so, instead of serving the two Months, which was di∣rected,
I was not above three Weeks in it; and a
great while too, considering it was in the Month of
<HI>August,</HI> at which time the Distemper began to rage
with great Violence at our end of the Town.</P>
<P>In the execution of this Office, I cou'd not refrain
speaking my Opinion among my Neighbours, as to
this shutting up the People in their Houses; in which
we saw most evidently the Severities that were used
<HI>tho' grievous in themselves,</HI> had also this particular Ob∣jection
against them, namely, that they did not an∣swer
the End, <HI>as I have said,</HI> but that the distemper'd
People went Day by Day about the Streets; and it
was our united Opinion, that a Method to have re∣moved
the Sound from the Sick in Case of a parti∣cular
House being visited, wou'd ha' been much
more reasonable on many Accounts, leaving no Body
with the sick Persons, but such as shou'd on such
Occasion request to stay and declare themselves con∣tent
to be shut up with them.</P>
<P>Our Scheme for removing those that were Sound
from those that were Sick, was only in such Houses
as were infected, and confining the sick was no Con∣finement;
those that cou'd not stir, wou'd not com∣plain,
while they were in their Senses, and while they
had the Power of judging: Indeed, when they came
to be Dilirious and Light-headed, then they wou'd
cry out of the Cruelty of being confin'd; but for the
removal of those that were well, we thought it high∣ly
reasonable and just, for their own sakes, they
shou'd be remov'd from the Sick, and that, for other
People's Safety, they shou'd keep retir'd for a while,
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
to see that they were sound, and might not infect
others; and we thought twenty or thirty Days enough
for this.</P>
<P>Now certainly, if Houses had been provided on
purpose for those that were sound to perform this de∣my
Quarantine in, they wou'd have much less Rea∣son
to think themselves injur'd in such a restraint,
than in being confin'd with infected People, in the
Houses where they liv'd.</P>
<P>It is here, however, to be observ'd, that after the
Funerals became so many, that People could not
Toll the Bell, Mourn, or Weep, or wear Black for
one another, as they did before; no, nor so much as
make Coffins for those that died; so after a while the
fury of the Infection appeared to be so encreased,
that in short, they shut up no Houses at all; it seem'd
enough that all the Remedies of that Kind had been
used till they were found fruitless, and that the
Plague spread itself with an irresistible Fury, so that,
as the Fire the succeeding Year, spread itself and
burnt with such Violence, that the Citizens in
Despair, gave over their Endeavours to extinguish
it, so in the Plague, it came at last to such Violence
that the People sat still looking at one another, and
seem'd quite abandon'd to Despair; whole Streets
seem'd to be desolated, and not to be shut up only,
but to be emptied of their Inhabitants; Doors were
left open, Windows stood shattering with the Wind in
empty Houses, for want of People to shut them: In
a Word, People began to give up themselves to their
Fears, and to think that all regulations and Methods
were in vain, and that there was nothing to be ho∣ped
for, but an universal Desolation; and it was e∣ven
in the height of this general Despair, that it
pleased God to stay his Hand, and to slacken the
Fury of the Contagion, in such a manner as was e∣ven
surprizing like its beginning, and demonstrated
it to be his own particular Hand, and that above, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
not without the Agency of Means, as I shall take
Notice of in its proper Place.</P>
<P>But I must still speak of the Plague as in its height,
raging even to Desolation, and the People under
the most dreadful Consternation, even, as I have said,
to Despair. It is hardly credible to what Excesses
the Passions of Men carry'd them in this Extremity
of the Distemper; and this Part, I think, was as
moving as the rest; What cou'd affect a Man in his
full Power of Reflection; and what could make
deeper Impressions on the Soul, than to see a Man
almost Naked and got out of his House, or perhaps
out of his Bed into the Street, come out of <HI>Harrow-Alley,</HI>
a populous Conjunction or Collection of Al∣leys,
Courts, and Passages, in the Butcher-row
in <HI>Whitechappel?</HI> I say, What could be more Af∣fecting,
than to see this poor Man come out into the
open Street, run Dancing and Singing, and making
a thousand antick Gestures, with five or six Women
and Children running after him, crying, and calling
upon him, for the Lord's sake to come back, and en∣treating
the help of others to bring him back, but
all in vain, no Body daring to lay a Hand upon him,
or to come near him.</P>
<P>This was a most grievous and afflicting thing to
me, who see it all from my own Windows; for all
this while, the poor afflicted Man, was, as I observ'd
it, even then in the utmost Agony of Pain, having,
as they said, two Swellings upon him, which cou'd
not be brought to break, or to suppurate; but by
laying strong Causticks on them, the Surgeons had, it
seems, hopes to break them, which Causticks were then
upon him, burning his Flesh as with a hot Iron: I
cannot say what became of this poor Man, but I
think he continu'd roving about in that manner till
he fell down and Died.</P>
<P>No wonder the Aspect of the City itself was fright∣ful,
the usual concourse of People in the Streets,
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
and which used to be supplied from our end of the
Town, was abated; the Exchange was not kept shut
indeed, but it was no more frequented; the Fires
were lost; they had been almost extinguished for
some Days by a very smart and hasty Rain: But
that was not all, some of the Physicians insisted that
they were not only no Benefit, but injurious to the
Health of People: This they made a loud Clamour
about, and complain'd to the Lord Mayor about it:
On the other Hand, others of the same Faculty,
and Eminent too, oppos'd them, and gave their
Reasons why the Fires were and must be useful to
asswage the Violence of the Distemper. I cannot
give a full Account of their Arguments on both
Sides, only this I remember, that they cavil'd very
much with one another; some were for Fires, but
that they must be made of Wood and not Coal,
and of particular sorts of Wood too, such as Fir in
particular, or Cedar, because of the strong effluvia
of Turpentine; Others were for Coal and not Wood,
because of the Sulphur and Bitumen; and others
were for neither one or other. Upon the whole,
the Lord Mayor ordered no more Fires, and espe∣cially
on this Account, namely, that the Plague was so
fierce that they saw evidently it defied all Means and
rather seemed to encrease than decrease upon any
application to check and abate it; and yet this
Amazement of the Magistrates, proceeded rather
from want of being able to apply any Means suc∣cessfully,
than from any unwillingness either to ex∣pose
themselves, or undertake the Care and Weight
of Business; for, to do them Justice, they neither
spared their Pains or their Persons; but nothing
answer'd, the Infection rag'd, and the People were
now frighted and terrified to the last Degree, so
that, as I may say, they gave themselves up, and, as
I mention'd above, abandon'd themselves to their
Despair.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201"/>
But let me observe here, that when I say the Peo∣ple
abandon'd themselves to Despair, I do not mean
to what Men call a religious Despair, or a Despair
of their eternal State, but I mean a Despair of their
being able to escape the Infection, or to out-live the
Plague, which they saw was so raging and so irre∣sistible
in its Force, that indeed few People that
were touch'd with it in its height about <HI>August,</HI> and
<HI>September,</HI> escap'd: And, which is very particular, con∣trary
to its ordinary Operation in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI>
and the beginning of <HI>August,</HI> when, as I have ob∣serv'd
many were infected, and continued so many
Days, and then went off, after having had the Poi∣son
in their Blood a long time; but now on the con∣trary,
most of the People who were taken during
the two last Weeks in <HI>August,</HI> and in the three
first Weeks in <HI>September,</HI> generally died in two
or three Days at farthest, and many the very
same Day they were taken; Whether the Dog-days,
or as our Astrologers pretended to express them∣selves,
the Influence of the Dog-Star had that ma∣lignant
Effect; or all those who had the seeds of
Infection before in them, brought it up to a ma∣turity
at that time altogether I know not; but this
was the time when it was reported, that above
3000 People died in one Night; and they that
wou'd have us believe they more critically observ'd
it, pretend to say, that they all died within the space
of two Hours, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Between the Hours of One
and three in the Morning.</P>
<P>As to the Suddenness of People's dying at this time
more than before, there were innumerable Instances
of it, and I could name several in my Neighbour∣hood;
one Family without the Barrs, and not far
from me, were all seemingly well on the Monday,
being Ten in Family, that Evening one Maid and
one Apprentice were taken ill, and dy'd the next Mor∣ning,
when the other Apprentice and two Children
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
were touch'd, whereof one dy'd the same Evening,
and the other two on Wednesday: In a Word, by
Saturday at Noon, the Master, Mistress, four Chil∣dren
and four Servants were all gone, and the House
left entirely empty, except an ancient Woman, who
came in to take Charge of the Goods for the Master
of the Family's Brother, who liv'd not far off, and
who had not been sick.</P>
<P>Many Houses were then left desolate, all the Peo∣ple
being carry'd away dead, and especially in an
Alley farther, on the same Side beyond the Barrs,
going in at the Sign of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron;</HI> there were
several Houses together, which (they said) had not one
Person left alive in them, and some that dy'd last in
several of those Houses, were left a little too long be∣fore
they were fetch'd out to be bury'd; the Reason
of which was not as some have written very untruly,
that the living were not sufficient to bury the dead;
but that the Mortality was so great in the Yard or
Alley, that there was no Body left to give Notice to
the Buriers or Sextons, that there were any dead Bo∣dies
there to be bury'd. It was said, how true I know
not, that some of those Bodies were so much corrup∣ted,
and so rotten, that it was with Difficulty they
were carry'd; and as the Carts could not come any
nearer than to the Alley-Gate in the high Street, it
was so much the more difficult to bring them along;
but I am not certain how many Bodies were then
left, I am sure that ordinarily it was not so.</P>
<P>As I have mention'd how the People were brought
into a Condition to despair of Life and abandon
themselves, so this very Thing had a strange Effect
among us for three or four Weeks, that is, it made
them bold and venturous, they were no more shy of
one another, or restrained within Doors, but went
any where and every where, and began to converse;
one would say to another, I do not ask you how you
are, or say how I am, it is certain we shall all go,
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
so 'tis no Matter who is sick or who is sound, and so
they run desperately into any Place or any Company.</P>
<P>As it brought the People into publick Company,
so it was surprizing how it brought them to crowd
into the Churches, they inquir'd no more into who
they sat near to, or far from, what offensive Smells they
met with, or what condition the People seemed to be
in, but looking upon themselves all as so many dead
Corpses, they came to the Churches without the least
Caution, and crowded together, as if their Lives
were of no Consequence, compar'd to the Work
which they came about there: Indeed, the Zeal
which they shew'd in Coming, and the Earnestness
and Affection they shew'd in their Attention to what
they heard, made it manifest what a Value People
would all put upon the Worship of God, if they
thought every Day they attended at the Church
that it would be their Last.</P>
<P>Nor was it without other strange Effects, for it
took away all Manner of Prejudice at, or Scruple a∣bout
the Person who they found in the Pulpit when
they came to the Churches. It cannot be doubted,
but that many of the Ministers of the Parish-Chur∣ches
were cut off among others in so common and
so dreadful a Calamity; and others had not Courage
enough to stand it, but removed into the Country
as they found Means for Escape, as then some Pa∣rish-Churches
were quite vacant and forsaken, the
People made no Scruple of desiring such Dissenters
as had been a few Years before depriv'd of their Li∣vings,
by Virtue of the Act of Parliament call'd,
<HI>The Act of Ʋniformity</HI> to preach in the Churches, nor
did the Church Ministers in that Case make any
Difficulty of accepting their Assistance, so that ma∣ny
of those who they called silenced Ministers, had
their Mouths open'd on this Occasion, and preach'd
publickly to the People.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204"/>
Here we may observe, and I hope it will not be
amiss to take notice of it, that a near View of Death
would soon reconcile Men of good Principles
one to another, and that it is chiefly owing to our
easy Scituation in Life, and our putting these Things
far from us, that our Breaches are fomented, ill
Blood continued, Prejudices, Breach of Charity and
of Christian Union so much kept and so far car∣ry'd
on among us, as it is: Another Plague Year
would reconcile all these Differences, a close con∣versing
with Death, or with Diseases that threaten
Death, would scum off the Gall from our Tem∣pers,
remove the Animosities among us, and
bring us to see with differing Eyes, than those
which we look'd on Things with before; as
the People who had been used to join with the
Church, were reconcil'd at this Time, with the
admitting the Dissenters to preach to them:
So the Dissenters, who with an uncommon Preju∣dice,
had broken off from the Communion of the
Church of England, were now content to come to
their Parish-Churches, and to conform to the Wor∣ship
which they did not approve of before; but as
the Terror of the Infection abated, those Things
all returned again to their less desirable Channel,
and to the Course they were in before.</P>
<P>I mention this but historically, I have no mind
to enter into Arguments to move either, or both
Sides to a more charitable Compliance one with a∣nother;
I do not see that it is probable such a Dis∣course
would be either suitable or successful; the
Breaches seem rather to widen, and tend to a wi∣dening
farther, than to closing, and who am I that
I should think myself able to influence either one
Side or other? But this I may repeat again, that
'tis evident Death will reconcile us all; on the o∣ther
Side the Grave we shall be all Brethren again:
In Heaven, whether, I hope we may come from all
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
Parties and Perswasions, we shall find neither Pre∣judice
or Scruple; there we shall be of one Principle
and of one Opinion, why we cannot be content to
go Hand in Hand to the Place where we shall join
Heart and Hand without the leaft Hesitation, and
with the most compleat Harmony and Affection; I
say, why we cannot do so here I can say nothing to,
neither shall I say any thing more of it, but that it
remains to be lamented.</P>
<P>I could dwell a great while upon the Calamities
of this dreadful time, and go on to describe the
Objects that appear'd among us every Day, the
dreadful Extravagancies which the Distraction of
sick People drove them into; how the Streets be∣gan
now to be fuller of frightful Objects, and Fa∣milies
to be made even a Terror to themselves:
But after I have told you, as I have above, that
One Man being tyed in his Bed, and finding no
other Way to deliver himself, set the Bed on fire
with his Candle, which unhappily stood within his
reach, and Burnt himself in his Bed. And how
another, by the insufferable Torment he bore,
daunced and sung naked in the Streets, not know∣ing
one Extasie from another, I say, after I have
mention'd these Things, What can be added more?
What can be said to represent the Misery of these
Times, more lively to the Reader, or to give him
a more perfect Idea of a complicated Distress?</P>
<P>I must acknowledge that this time was Terri∣ble,
that I was sometimes at the End of all my Re∣solutions,
and that I had not the Courage that I had
at the Beginning. As the Extremity brought other
People abroad, it drove me Home, and except,
having made my Voyage down to <HI>Blackwall</HI> and
<HI>Greenwich,</HI> as I have related, which was an Excur∣sion,
I kept afterwards very much within Doors,
as I had for about a Fortnight before; I have said
already, that I repented several times that I had
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
ventur'd to stay in Town, and had not gone away
with my Brother, and his Family, but it was too
late for that now; and after I had retreated and stay'd
within Doors a good while, before my Impatience
led me Abroad, than they call'd me, as I have said,
to an ugly and dangerous Office, which brought
me out again; but as that was expir'd, while the
hight of the Distemper lasted, I retir'd again, and con∣tinued
close ten or twelve Days more. During
which many dismal Spectacles represented them∣selves
in my View, out of my own Windows, and
in our own Street, as that perticularly from <HI>Har∣row-Alley,</HI>
of the poor outrageous Creature which
danced and sung in his Agony, and many others
there were: Scarse a Day or Night pass'd over, but
some dismal Thing or other happened at the End
of that <HI>Harrow-Alley,</HI> which was a Place full of poor
People, most of them belonging to the Butchers, or
to Employments depending upon the Butchery.</P>
<P>Sometimes Heaps and Throngs of People would
burst out of that Alley, most of them Women,
making a dreadful Clamour, mixt or Compound∣ed
of Skreetches, Ctyings and Calling one another,
that we could not conceive what to make of it;
almost all the dead Part of the Night the dead
Cart stood at the End of that Alley, for if it went
in it could not well turn again, and could go in
but a little Way. There, I say, it stood to receive
dead Bodys, and as the Church-Yard was but a
little Way off, if it went away full it would soon
be back again: It is impossible to describe the most
horrible Cries and Noise the poor People would
make at their bringing the dead Bodies of their
Children and Friends out to the Cart, and by the
Number one would have thought, there had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
none left behind, or that there were People enoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for a small City liveing in those Places: Severa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
times they cryed Murther, sometimes Fire; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
it was esie to perceive it was all Distraction, and
the Complaints of Distress'd and distemper'd Peo∣ple.</P>
<P>I believe it was every where thus at that time, for
the Plague rag'd for six or seven Weeks beyond all
that I have express'd; and came even to such a
height, that in the Extremity, they began to break
into that excellent Order, of which I have spoken
so much, in behalf of the Magistrates, namely,
that no dead Bodies were seen in the Streets or
Burials in the Day-time, for there was a Necessity,
in this Extremety, to bear with its being otherwise,
for a little while.</P>
<P>One thing I cannot omit here, and indeed I
thought it was extraordinary, at least, it seemed a
remarkable Hand of Divine Justice, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That
all the Predictors, Astrologers, Fortune-tellers,
and what they call'd cunning-Men, Conjurers, and
the like; calculators of Nativities, and dreamers
of Dreams, and such People, were gone and va∣nish'd,
not one of them was to be found: I am,
verily, perswaded that a great Number of them fell
in the heat of the Calamity, having ventured to
stay upon the Prospect of getting great Estates;
and indeed their Gain was but too great for a time
through the Madness and Folly of the People; but
now they were silent, many of them went to their
long Home, not able to soretel their own Fate, or
to calculate their own Nativities; some have been
critical enough to say, that every one of them dy'd;
I dare not affirm that, but this I must own, that
I never heard of one of them that ever appear'd
after the Calamity was over.</P>
<P>But to return to my particular Observations,
during this dreadful part of the Visitation; I am
now come, as I have said, to the Month of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI>
which was the most dreadful of its kind, I
believe, that ever <HI>London</HI> saw; for by all the Ac∣counts
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
which I have seen of the preceding Visita∣tions
which have been in <HI>London,</HI> nothing has been
like it; the Number in the Weekly Bill amount∣ing
to almost 40,000 from the 22d of <HI>August,</HI> to
the 26th of <HI>September,</HI> being but five Weeks, the
particulars of the Bills are as follows, (<HI>viz.</HI>)

<P>This was a prodigious Number of itself, but if
I should add the Reasons which I have to believe
that this Account was deficient, and how deficient
it was, you would with me, make no Scruple to be∣lieve
that there died above ten Thousand a Week for
all those Weeks, one Week with another, and a
proportion for several Weeks both before and af∣ter:
The Confusion among the People, especially
within the City at that time, was inexpressible; the
Terror was so great at last, that the Courage of the
People appointed to carry away the Dead, began
to fail them; nay, several of them died altho' they
had the Distemper before, and were recover'd;
and some of them drop'd down when they have
been carrying the Bodies even at the Pitside, and
just ready to throw them in; and this Confusion
was greater in the City, because they had flat∣ter'd
themselves with Hopes of escaping: And
thought the bitterness of Death was past: One
Cart they told us, going up <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> was for∣saken
of the Drivers, or being left to one Man to
drive, he died in the Street, and the Horses going
on, overthrew the Cart, and left the Bodies, some
thrown out here, some there, in a dismal manner;
Another Cart was it seems found in the great
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
Pit in <HI>Finsbury</HI> Fields, the Driver being Dead, or
having been gone and abandon'd it, and the Horses
running too near it, the Cart fell in and drew the
Horses in also: It was suggested that the Driver
was thrown in with it, and that the Cart fell up∣on
him, by Reason his Whip was seen to be in
the Pit among the Bodies; but that, I suppose,
cou'd not be certain.</P>
<P>In our Parish of <HI>Aldgate,</HI> the dead-Carts
were several times, as I have heard, found stand∣ing
at the Church-yard Gate, full of dead Bodies,
but neither Bell man or Driver, or any one else
with it; neither in these, or many other Cases, did
they know what Bodies they had in their Cart, for
sometimes they were let down with Ropes out of
Balconies and out of Windows; and sometimes
the Bearers brought them to the Cart, sometimes
other People; nor, <HI>as the Men themselves said,</HI> did
they trouble them selves to keep any Account of
the Numbers.</P>
<P>The Vigilance of the Magistrate was now put
to the utmost Trial, and it must be confess'd, can
never be enough acknowledg'd on this Occasion
also, whatever Expence or Trouble they were at,
two Things were never neglected in the City or
Suburbs either.</P>
<P>1. Provisions were always to be had in full Plenty,
and the Price not much rais'd neither, hardly
worth speaking.</P>
<P>2. No dead Bodies lay unburied or uncovered;
and if one walk'd from one end of the City to ano∣ther,
no Funeral or sign of it was to be seen in the
Day-time, except a little, as I have said above, in
the three first Weeks in <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>This last Article perhaps will hardly be believ'd,
when some Accounts which others have published
since that shall be seen, wherein they say, that the
Dead lay unburied, which I am assured was utterly
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
false; at least, if it had been any where so, it must
ha' been in Houses where the Living were gone
from the Dead, having found means, as I have ob∣served,
to Escape, and where no Notice was gi∣ven
to the Officers: All which amounts to nothing
at all in the Case in Hand; for this I am positive
in, having myself been employ'd a little in the Di∣rection
of that part in the Parish in which I liv'd,
and where as great a Desolation was made
in proportion to the Number of Inhabitants as
was any where. I say, I am sure that there were
no dead Bodies remain'd unburied; that is to say,
none that the proper Officers knew of; none for
want of People to carry them off, and Buriers to
put them into the Ground and cover them; and
this is sufficient to the Argument; for what might
lie in Houses and Holes as in <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y is
nothing; for it is most certain, they were buried as
soon as they were found. As to the first Article,
namely, of Provisions, the scarcity or dearness, tho' I
have mention'd it before, and shall speak of it a∣gain;
yet I must observe here,</P>
<P>(1.) The Price of Bread in particular was not
much raised; for in the beginning of the Year (<HI>viz.</HI>)
In the first Week in <HI>March,</HI> the Penny Wheaten
Loaf was ten Ounces and a half; and in the height
of the Contagion, it was to be had at nine Oun∣ces
and an half, and never dearer, no not all that
Season: And about the beginning of <HI>November</HI> it
was sold ten Ounces and a half again; the like of
which, I believe, was never heard of in any City,
under so dreadful a Visitation before.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="211"/>
(2.) Neither was there (which I wondred much at)
any want of Bakers or Ovens kept open to supply
the People with Bread; but this was indeed alledg'd
by some Families, <HI>viz.</HI> That their Maid-Servants go∣ing
to the Bake-houses with their Dough to be
baked, which was then the Custom, sometimes came
Home with the Sickness, that is to say, the Plague
upon them.</P>
<P>In all this dreadful Visitation, there were, as I
have said before, but two Pest-houses made use of,
<HI>viz.</HI> One in the Fields beyond <HI>Old-Street,</HI> and one in
<HI>Westminster;</HI> neither was there any Compulsion us'd
in carrying People thither: Indeed there was no
need of Compulsion in the Case, for there were
Thousands of poor distressed People, who having no
Help, or Conveniences, or Supplies but of Cha∣rity,
would have been very glad to have been carryed
thither, and been taken Care of, which indeed was
the only thing that, I think, was wanting in the whole
publick Management of the City; seeing no Body
was here allow'd to be brought to the Pest-house,
but where Money was given, or Security for Money,
either at their introducing, or upon their being
cur'd and sent out; for very many were sent out again
whole, and very good Physicians were appointed to
those Places, so that many People did very well there,
of which I shall make Mention again. The prin∣cipal
Sort of People sent thither were, as I have said,
Servants, who got the Distemper by going of Er∣rands
to fetch Necessaries to the Families where they
liv'd; and who in that Case, if they came Home
sick, were remov'd to preserve the rest of the House;
and they were so well look'd after there in all the
time of the Visitation, that there was but 156 bur∣ried
in all at the <HI>London</HI> Pest-house, and 159 at
that of <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>By having more Pest-houses, I am far from mean∣ing
a forcing all People into such Places. Had the
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
shutting up of Houses been omitted, and the Sick
hurried out of their Dwellings to Pest-houses, as
some proposed it seems, at that time as well as since,
it would certainly have been much worse than it was;
the very removing the Sick, would have been a spread∣ing
of the Infection, and the rather because that re∣moving
could not effectually clear the House, where
the sick Person was, of the Distemper, and the rest
of the Family being then left at Liberty would cer∣tainly
spread it among others.</P>
<P>The Methods also in private Families, which would
have been universally used to have concealed the
Distemper, and to have conceal'd the Persons being
sick, would have been such, that the Distemper
would sometimes have seiz'd a whole Family before
any Visitors or Examiners could have known of it:
On the other hand, the prodigious Numbers which
would have been sick at a time, would have exceeded all
the Capacity of publick Pest-houses to receive them,
or of publick Officers to discover and remove them.</P>
<P>This was well considered in those Days, and I
have heard them talk of it often: The Magistrates
had enough to do to bring People to submit to hav∣ing
their Houses shut up, and many Ways they de∣ceived
the Watchmen, and got out, as I have ob∣served:
But that Difficulty made it apparent, that
they would have found it impracticable to have gone
the other way to Work; for they could never have
forced the sick People out of their Beds and out of
their Dwellings; it must not have been my Lord
Mayor's Officers, but an Army of Officers that must
have attempted it; and the People, on the other hand,
would have been enrag'd and desperate, and would
have kill'd those that should have offered to have
meddled with them or with their Children and Re∣lations,
whatever had befallen them for it; so that
they would have made the People, who, <HI>as it was,</HI>
were in the most terrible Distraction imaginable; I
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
say, they would have made them stark mad; where∣as
the Magistrates found it proper on several Ac∣counts
to treat them with Lenity and Compassion,
and not with Violence and Terror, such as dragging
the Sick out of their Houses, or obliging them to
remove themselves would have been.</P>
<P>This leads me again to mention the Time, when
the Plague first began, that is to say, when it be∣came
certain that it would spread over the whole
Town, when, as I have said, the better sort of
People first took the Alarm, and began to hurry
themselves out of Town: It was true, as I observ'd
in its Place, that the Throng was so great, and the
Coaches, Horses, Waggons and Carts were so many,
driving and dragging the People away, that it look'd
as if all the City was running away; and had any
Regulations been publish'd that had been terrifying
at that time, especially such as would pretend to
dispose of the People, otherwise than they would
dispose of themselves, it would have put both the
City and Suburbs into the utmost Confusion.</P>
<P>But the Magistrates wisely caus'd the People to be
encourag'd, made very good By-Laws for the regu∣lating
the Citizens, keeping good Order in the Streets,
and making every thing as eligible as possible to
all Sorts of People.</P>
<P>In the first Place, the Lord Mayor and the She∣riffs,
the Court of Aldermen, and a certain Number
of the Common Council-Men, or their Deputies
came to a Resolution and published it, <HI>viz.</HI> “That <HI>they</HI>
would not quit the City themselves, but that they
would be always at hand for the preserving good
Order in every Place, and for the doing Justice on
all Occasions; as also for the distributing the
publick Charity to the Poor; and in a Word, for
the doing the Duty, and discharging the Trust
repos'd in them by the Citizens to the utmost of
their Power.”</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214"/>
In Pursuance of these Orders, the Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> held Councils every Day more or
less, for making such Dispositions as they found
needful for preserving the Civil Peace; and tho' they
used the People with all possible Gentleness and Cle∣mency,
yet all manner of presumptuous Rogues, such
as Thieves, House-breakers, Plunderers of the Dead,
or of the Sick, were duly punish'd, and several De∣clarations
were continually publish'd by the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen against such.</P>
<P>Also all Constables and Church-wardens were en∣join'd
to stay in the City upon severe Penalties, or
to depute such able and sufficient House-keepers, as
the Deputy Aldermen, or Common Council-men of
the Precinct should approve, and for whom they
should give Security; and also Security in case of
Mortality, that they would forthwith constitute
other Constables in their stead.</P>
<P>These things re-establish'd the Minds of the People
very much, especially in the first of their Fright,
when they talk'd of making so universal a Flight,
that the City would have been in Danger of being
entirely deserted of its Inhabitants, except the Poor;
and the Country of being plunder'd and laid waste
by the Multitude. Nor were the Magistrates de∣ficient
in performing their Part as boldly as they pro∣mised
it; for my Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs were
continually in the Streets, and at places of the greatest
Danger; and tho' they did not care for having too
great a Resort of People crouding about them, yet,
in emergent Cases, they never denyed the People Ac∣cess
to them, and heard with Patience all their
Grievances and Complaints; my Lord Mayor had
a low Gallery built on purpose in his Hall, where
he stood a little remov'd from the Croud when any
Complaint came to be heard, that he might appear
with as much Safety as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215"/>
Likewise the proper Officers, call'd <HI>my Lord
Mayor's Officers,</HI> constantly attended in their Turns,
as they were <HI>in waiting;</HI> and if any of them were
sick or infected, as some of them were, others were
instantly employed to fill up and officiate in their
Places, till it was known whether the other should
live or die.</P>
<P>In like manner the Sheriffs and Aldermen did in
their several Stations and Wards, where they were
placed by Office; and the Sheriff's Officers or Ser∣geants
were appointed to receive Orders from the
respective Aldermen in their Turn; so that Justice
was executed in all Cases without Interruption. In
the next Place, it was one of their particular Cares,
to see the Orders for the Freedom of the Markets
observ'd; and in this part either the Lord Mayor, or
one or both of the Sheriffs, were every Market-day
on Horseback to see their Orders exeouted, and to
see that the Country People had all possible En∣couragement
and Freedom in their coming to the
Markets, and going back again; and that no Nu∣sances
or frightful Objects should be seen in the
Streets to terrify them, or make them unwilling to
come. Also the Bakers were taken under particular
Order, and the Master of the Bakers Company
was, with his Court of Assistance, directed to see
the Order of my Lord Mayor for their Regulation put
in Execution, and the due Assize of Bread, which
was weekly appointed by my Lord Mayor, observ'd,
and all the Bakers were oblig'd to keep their Ovens
going constantly, on pain of losing the Privileges of
a Freeman of the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>By this means, Bread was always to be had in
Plenty, and as cheap as usual, as I said above; and
Provisions were never wanting in the Markets, even
to such a Degree, that I often wonder'd at it, and
reproach'd my self with being so timorous and cau∣tious
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
in stirring abroad, when the Country People
came freely and boldly to Market, as if there had
been no manner of Infection in the City, or Dan∣ger
of catching it.</P>
<P>It was indeed one admirable piece of Conduct in the
said Magistrates, that the Streets were kept constant∣ly
clear, and free from all manner of frightful Ob∣jects,
dead Bodies, or any such things as were inde∣cent
or unpleasant, unless where any Body fell down
suddenly or died in the Streets, <HI>as I have said above,</HI>
and these were generally covered with some Cloth
or Blanket, or remov'd into the next Church-yard,
till Night: All the needful Works, that carried
Terror with them, that were both dismal and dan∣gerous,
were done in the Night; if any diseas'd
Bodies were remov'd, or dead Bodies buried, or in∣fected
Cloths burnt, it was done in the Night; and
all the Bodies, which were thrown into the great
Pits in the several Church-yards, or burying Grounds,
<HI>as has been observ'd,</HI> were so remov'd in the Night;
and every thing was covered and closed before Day:
So that in the Day-time there was not the least Sig∣nal
of the Calamity to be seen or heard of, except
what was to be observ'd from the Emptiness of the
Streets, and sometimes from the passionate Out∣cries
and Lamentations of the People, out at their
Windows, and from the Numbers of Houses and
Shops shut up.</P>
<P>Nor was the Silence and Emptiness of the Streets
so much in the City as in the Out-parts, except just
at one particular time, when, as I have mention'd, the
Plague came East, and spread over all the City: It
was indeed a merciful Disposition of God, that as the
Plague began at one End of the Town first, <HI>as has been
observ'd at large,</HI> so it proceeded progressively to other
Parts, and did not come on this way or East∣ward,
till it had spent its Fury in the West part of
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
the Town; and so as it came on one way, it abat∣ed
another. <HI>For Example.</HI></P>
<P>It began at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s and the <HI>Westminster</HI> End
of the Town, and it was in its Height in all that
part by about the Middle of <HI>July, viz.</HI> in St. <HI>Giles</HI>
in the <HI>Fields,</HI> St. <HI>Andrew's Holborn,</HI> St. <HI>Clement-Danes,</HI>
St. <HI>Martins</HI> in the <HI>Fields,</HI> and in <HI>Westminster:</HI> The
latter End of <HI>July</HI> it decreased in those Parishes, and
coming East, it encreased prodigiously in <HI>Cripple∣gate,</HI>
St. <HI>Sepukhers,</HI> St. <HI>Ja. Clarkenwell,</HI> and St. <HI>Brides,</HI>
and <HI>Aldersgate;</HI> while it was in all these Parishes, the
City and all the Parishes of the <HI>Southwark</HI> Side of
the Water, and all <HI>Stepney, White-Chapel, Aldgate,
Wapping,</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff</HI> were very little touch'd; so
that People went about their Business unconcern'd,
carryed on their Trades, kept open their Shops,
and conversed freely with one another in all the
City, the East and North-East Suburbs, and in <HI>South∣wark,</HI>
almost as if the Plague had not been among us.</P>
<P>Even when the North and North-west Suburbs
were fully infected, <HI>viz. Cripplegate, Clarkenwell,
Bishopsgate,</HI> and <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> yet still all the rest were
tolerably well. For Example,

So that in short there died more that Week in
the two Parishes of <HI>Cripplegate</HI> and St. <HI>Sepulchers</HI>
by 48 than in all the City, and all the East Suburbs,
and all the <HI>Southwark</HI> Parishes put together: This
caused the Reputation of the City's Health to con∣tinue
all over <HI>England,</HI> and especially in the Coun∣ties
and Markets adjacent, from-whence our Supply
of Provisions chiefly came, even much longer than
that Health it self continued; for when the People
came into the Streets from the Country, by <HI>Shore∣ditch</HI>
and <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> or by <HI>Oldstreet</HI> and <HI>Smithfield,</HI> they
would see the out Streets empty, and the Houses and
Shops shut, and the few People that were stirring there
walk in the Middle of the Streets; but when they
came within the City, <HI>there things look'd better,</HI> and
the Markets and Shops were open, and the People
walking about the Streets as usual, tho' not quite
so many; and this continued till the latter End of
<HI>August,</HI> and the Beginning of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>But then the Case alter'd quite, the Distemper
abated in the West and North-West Parishes, and
the Weight of the Infection lay on the City and
the Eastern Suburbs and the <HI>Southwark</HI> Side, and
this in a frightful manner.</P>
<P>Then indeed the City began to look dismal, Shops
to be shut, and the Streets desolate; in the High-Street
indeed Necessity made People stir abroad on ma∣ny
Occasions; and there would be in the middle of the
Day a pretty many People, but in the Mornings and
Evenings scarce any to be seen, even there, no not in
<HI>Cornhill</HI> and <HI>Cheapside.</HI></P>
<P>These Observations of mine were abundantly con∣firm'd
by the Weekly Bills of Mortality for those
Weeks, an Abstract of which, as they respect the
Parishes which I have mention'd, and as they make the

<P>And now the Misery of the City, and of the said
East and South Parts was complete indeed; for as
you see the Weight of the Distemper lay upon
those Parts, that is to say, the City, the eight Pa∣rishes
over the River, with the Parishes of <HI>Aldgate,
White-Chapel,</HI> and <HI>Stepney,</HI> and this was the Time
that the Bills came up to such a monstrous Height,
as that I mention'd before; and that Eight or Nine,
and, as I believe, Ten or Twelve Thousand a Week
died; for 'tis my settled Opinion, that they never
could come at any just Account of the Numbers,
for the Reasons which I have given already.</P>
<P>Nay one of the most eminent Physicians, who
has since publish'd in Latin an Account of those
Times, and of his Observations, says, that in one
Week there died twelve Thousand People, and that
particularly there died four Thousand in one Night;
tho' I do not remember that there ever was any
such particular Night, so remarkably fatal, as that
such a Number died in it: However all this con∣firms
what I have said above of the Uncertainty of
the Bills of Mortality, &amp;c. of which I shall say
more hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221"/>
And here let me take leave to enter again, tho'
it may seem a Repetition of Circumstances, into a De∣scription
of the miserable Condition of the City it
self, and of those Parts where I liv'd at this parti∣cular
Time: The City, and those other Parts, notwith∣standing
the great Numbers of People that were gone
into the Country, was vastly full of People, and per∣haps
the fuller, because People had for a long time
a strong Belief, that the Plague would not come in∣to
the City, nor into <HI>Southwark,</HI> no nor into <HI>Wap∣ping,</HI>
or <HI>Ratcliff</HI> at all; nay such was the Assurance
of the People on that Head, that many remov'd
from the Suburbs on the West and North Sides, in∣to
those Eastern and South Sides as for Safety, and
as I verily believe, carry'd, the Plague amongst
them there, perhaps sooner than they would other∣wise
have had it.</P>
<P>Here also I ought to leave a farther Remark for
the use of Posterity, concerning the Manner of
Peoples infecting one another; namely, that it was
not the sick People only, from whom the Plague was
immediately receiv'd by others that were sound, but
THE WELL. <HI>To explain my self;</HI> by <HI>the sick</HI> Peo∣ple
I mean those who were known to be sick, had
taken their Beds, had been under Cure, or had
Swellings and Tumours upon them, and the like;
these every Body could beware of, they were either
in their Beds, or in such Condition as cou'd not be
conceal'd.</P>
<P>By <HI>the Well,</HI> I mean such as had received the Con∣tagion,
and had it really upon them, and in their
Blood, yet did not shew the Consequences of it in
their Countenances, nay even were not sensible of
it themselves, <HI>as many were not</HI> for several Days:
These breathed Death in every Place, and upon every
Body who came near them; nay their very Cloaths
retained the Infection, their Hands would infect the
Things they touch'd, especially if they were warm
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
and sweaty, and they were generally apt to sweat
too.</P>
<P>Now it was impossible to know these People,
nor did they sometimes, as I have said, know them∣selves
to be infected: These were the People that
so often dropt down and fainted in the Streets; for
oftentimes they would go about the Streets to the
last, till on a sudden they would sweat, grow faint,
sit down at a Door and die: It is true, finding
themselves thus, they would struggle hard to get
Home to their own Doors, or at other Times would
be just able to go in to their Houses and die instant∣ly;
other Times they would go about till they had the
very Tokens come out upon them, and yet not know
it, and would die in an Hour or two after they came
Home, but be well as long as they were Abroad:
These were the dangerous People, these were the
People of whom the well People ought to have
been afraid; but then <HI>on the other side</HI> it was impossible
to know them.</P>
<P>And this is the Reason why it is impossible in a
Visitation to prevent the spreading of the Plague
by the utmost human Vigilance, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it is im∣possible
to know the infected People from the sound;
or that the infected People should perfectly know
themselves: I knew a Man who conversed freely in
<HI>London</HI> all the Season of the Plague in 1665, and
kept about him an Antidote or Cordial, on pur∣pose
to take when he thought himself in any Dan∣ger,
and he had such a Rule to know, or have
warning of the Danger by, as indeed I never met
with before or since, how far it may be depended
on I know not: He had a Wound in his Leg, and
whenever he came among any People that were not
sound, and the Infection began to affect him, he
said he could know it by that Signal, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That his
Wound in his Leg would smart, and look pale
and white; so as soon as ever he felt it smart, it
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
was time for him to withdraw, or to take care of
himself, taking his Drink, which he always carried
about him for that Purpose. Now it seems he found
his Wound would smart many Times when he was in
Company with such, who thought themselves to be
sound, and who appear'd so to one another; but he
would presently rise up, and say publickly, Friends, here
is some Body in the room that has the Plague, and
so would immediately break up the Company. This
was indeed a faithful Monitor to all People, that the
Plague is not to be avoided by those that converse pro∣miscuously
in a Town infected, and People have
it when they know it not, and that they likewise give
it to others when they know not that they have it
themselves; and in this Case, shutting up the WELL
or removing the SICK will not do it, unless they
can go back and shut up all those that the Sick had
Convers'd with, even before they knew themselves
to be sick, and none knows how far to carry that
back, or where to stop; for none knows when, or
where, or how they may have received the Infec∣tion,
or from whom.</P>
<P>This I take to be the Reason, which makes so many
People talk of the Air being corrupted and infected,
and that they need not be cautious of whom they
converse with, for that the Contagion was in the
Air. I have seen them in strange Agitations and Sur∣prises
on this Account, I have never come near any
infected Body! <HI>says the disturbed Person,</HI> I have Con∣vers'd
with none, but sound healthy People, and yet
I have gotten the Distemper! I am sure I am
struck from Heaven, <HI>says another,</HI> and he falls to the
serious Part; again the first goes on exclaiming, I
have come near no Infection, or any infected Per∣son,
<HI>I am sure it is in the Air;</HI> We draw in Death
when we breath, and therefore 'tis the Hand of
God, there is no withstanding it; and this at last
made many People, being hardened to the Danger,
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
grow less concern'd at it, and less cautious towards
the latter End of the Time, and when it was
come to its height, than they were at first;
then with a kind of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Predestinarianism, they
would say, if it pleas'd God to strike them, it was
all one whether they went Abroad or staid at Home,
they cou'd not escape it, and therefore they went
boldly about even into infected Houses, and infected
Company; visited sick People, and in short, lay in
the Beds with their Wives or Relations when they
were infected; and what was the Consequence? But
the same that is the Consequence in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and in
those Countries where they do those Things; name∣ly,
that they were infected too, and died by Hun∣dreds
and Thousands.</P>
<P>I would be far from lessening the Awe of the Judg∣ments
of God, and the Reverence to his Providence,
which ought always to be on our Minds on such Oc∣casions
as these; doubtless the Visitation it self is
a Stroke from Heaven upon a City, or Country, or
Nation where it falls; a Messenger of his Venge∣ance,
and a loud Call to that Nation, or Country,
or City, to Humiliation and Repentance, according
to that of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> xviii. 7, 8. <HI>At what
instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concern∣ing
a Kingdom to pluck up, and to pull down, and de∣stroy
it: If that Nation against whom I have pro∣nounced,
turn from their evil, I will repent of the
evil that I thought to do unto them.</HI> Now to prompt due
Impressions of the Awe of God on the Minds of Men
on such Occasions, and not to lessen them it is that I
have left those Minutes upon Record.</P>
<P>I say, therefore I reflect upon no Man for put∣ing
the Reason of those Things upon the immedi∣ate
Hand of God, and the Appointment and Direc∣tion
of his Providence; nay, on the contrary, there
were many wonderful Deliverances of Persons from
Infection, and Deliverances of Persons when In∣fected,
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
which intimate singular and remarkable Pro∣vidence,
in the particular Instances to which they
refer, and I esteem my own Deliverance to be one
next to miraculous, and do record it with Thank∣fulness.</P>
<P>But when I am speaking of the Plague, as a Di∣stemper
arising from natural Causes, we must con∣sider
it as it was really propagated by natural Means,
nor is it all the less a Judgment for its being un∣der
the Conduct of humane Causes and Effects; for
as the divine Power has form'd the whole Scheme of
Nature, and maintains Nature in its Course; so the
same Power thinks fit to let his own Actings with
Men, whether of Mercy or Judgement, go on in
the ordinary Course of natural Causes, and he is
pleased to act by those natural Causes as the ordina∣ry
Means; excepting and reserving to himself never∣theless
a Power to act in a supernatural Way when
he sees occasion: Now 'tis evident, that in the Case
of an Infection, there is no apparent extraordinary
occasion for supernatural Operation, but the ordi∣nary
Course of Things appears sufficiently arm'd,
and made capable of all the Effects that Heaven
usually directs by a Contagion. Among these Cau∣ses
and Effects this of the secret Conveyance of In∣fection
imperceptible, and unavoidable, is more
than sufficient to execute the Fierceness of divine
Vengeance, without putting it upon Supernaturals
and Miracle.</P>
<P>The acute penetrating Nature of the Disease it
self was such, and the Infection was receiv'd so im∣perceptibly,
that the most exact Caution could not
secure us while in the Place: But I must be allowed
to believe, and I have so many Examples fresh in
my Memory, to convince me of it, that I think
none can resist their Evidence; <HI>I say,</HI> I must be al∣lowed
to believe, that no one in this whole Nation
ever receiv'd the Sickness or Infection, but who re∣ceiv'd
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
it in the ordinary Way of Infection from
some Body, or the Cloaths, or touch, or stench of
some Body that was infected before.</P>
<P>The Manner of its coming first to <HI>London,</HI>
proves this also, (<HI>viz.</HI>) by Goods brought over from
<HI>Holland,</HI> and brought thither from the <HI>Levant;</HI>
the first breaking of it out in a House in <HI>Long-Acre,</HI>
where those Goods were carried, and first opened;
its spreading from that House to other Houses, by
the visible unwary conversing with those who were
sick, and the infecting the Parish Officers who were
employed about the Persons dead, <HI>and the like;</HI> these
are known Authorities for this great Foundation
Point, that it went on, and proceeded from Person
to Person, and from House to House, and no other∣wise:
In the first House that was infected there
died four Persons, a Neighbour hearing the Mistress
of the first House was sick, went to visit her, and went
Home and gave the Distemper to her Family, and
died, and all her Houshold. A Minister call'd to
pray with the first sick Person in the second House,
was said to sicken immediately, and die with seve∣ral
more in his House: Then the Physicians began
to consider, for they did not at first dream of a ge∣neral
Contagion. But the Physicians being sent
to inspect the Bodies, they assur'd the People
that it was neither more or less than <HI>the Plague</HI> with
all its terrifying Particulars, and that it threatned an
universal Infection, so many People having already
convers'd with the Sick or Distemper'd, and hav∣ing,
as might be suppos'd, received Infection from
them, that it would be impossible to put a stop to
it.</P>
<P>Here the Opinion of the Physicians agreed with
my Observation afterwards, namely, that the Dan∣ger
was spreading insensibly; for the Sick cou'd
infect none but those that came within reach of
the sick Person; but that one Man, who may have
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
really receiv'd the Infection, and knows it not, but
goes Abroad, and about as a sound Person, may
give the Plague to a thousand People, and they to
greater Numbers in Proportion, and neither the Per∣son
giving the Infection, or the Persons receiving it,
know any thing of it, and perhaps not feel the Ef∣fects
of it for several Days after.</P>
<P><HI>For Example,</HI> Many Persons in the Time of this
Visitation never perceiv'd that they were infected, till
they found to their unspeakable Surprize, the Tokens
come out upon them, after which they seldom liv'd
six Hours; for those Spots they call'd the Tokens
were really gangreen Spots, or mortified Flesh in
small Knobs as broad as a little silver Peny, and hard
as a piece of Callous or Horn; so that when the
Disease was come up to that length, there was no∣thing
could follow but certain Death, and yet <HI>as I
said</HI> they knew nothing of their being Infec∣ted,
nor found themselves so much as out of Order,
till those mortal Marks were upon them: But every
Body must allow, that they were infected in a high
Degree before, and must have been so some time;
and consequently their Breath, their Sweat, their
very Cloaths were contagious for many Days be∣fore.</P>
<P>This occasion'd a vast Variety of Cases, which
Physicians would have much more opportunity to
remember than I; but some came within the Com∣pass
of my Observation, or hearing, of which I
shall name a few.</P>
<P>A certain Citizen who had liv'd safe, and un∣touch'd,
till the Month of <HI>September,</HI> when the
Weight of the Distemper lay more in the City
than it had done before, was mightly chearful, and
something too bold, as I think it was, in his Talk
of how secure he was, how cautious he had been,
and how he had never come near any sick Body:
Says another Citizen, a Neighbour of his to him,
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
one Day, <HI>Do not be too confident</HI> Mr.—<HI>it is hard to
say who is sick and who is well; for we see Men alive,
and well to outward Appearance one Hour, and dead
the next. That is true,</HI> says the first Man, for he
was not a Man presumptuously secure, but had es∣cap'd
a long while, and Men, as I said above, espe∣cially
in the City, began to be over-easie upon that
Score. <HI>That is true,</HI> says he, I do not think my
self secure, <HI>but I hope I have not been in Company
with any Person that there has been any Danger in.</HI>
No! Says his Neighbour, <HI>was not you at the</HI> Bull∣head
<HI>Tavern in</HI> Gracechurch Street <HI>with</HI> Mr.—
<HI>the Night before last:</HI> YES, says the first, <HI>I was,</HI>
but <HI>there was no Body there, that we had any Reason
to think dangerous:</HI> Upon which his Neigbour said
no more, being unwilling to surprize him; but this
made him more inquisitive, and as his Neighbour
appear'd backward, he was the more impatient,
and in a kind of Warmth, says he aloud, <HI>why he is
not dead, is he!</HI> upon which his Neighbour still
was silent, but cast up his Eyes, and said something
to himself; at which the first Citizen turned pale,
and said no more but this, <HI>then I am a dead Man
too,</HI> and went Home immediately, and sent for a
neighbouring Apothecary to give him something
preventive, for he had not yet found himself ill;
but the Apothecary opening his Breast, fetch'd a
Sigh, and said no more, but this, <HI>look up to God;</HI> and
the Man died in a few Hours.</P>
<P>Now let any Man judge from a Case like this,
if it is possible for the Regulations of Magistrates,
either by shuting up the Sick, or removing them, to
stop an Infection, which spreads it self from Man to
Man, even while they are perfectly well, and in∣sensible
of its Approach, and may be so for many
Days.</P>
<P>It may be proper to ask here, how long it may
be supposed, Men might have the Seeds of the Con∣tagion
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
in them, before it discover'd it self in this fa∣tal
Manner; and how long they might go about
seemingly whole, and yet be contagious to all those
that came near them? I believe the most experienc'd
Physicians cannot answer this Question directly, any
more than I can; and something an ordinary Ob∣server
may take notice of, which may pass their Ob∣servation.
The opinion of Physician Abroad seems
to be, that it may lye Dormant in the Spirits, or
in the Blood Vessels, a very considerable Time;
why else do they exact a Quarentine of those who
come into their Harbours, and Ports, from suspec∣ted
Place? Forty Days is, one would think, too
long for Nature to struggle with such an Enemy as
this, and not conquer it, or yield to it: But I could
not think by my own Observation that they can be
infected so, as to be contagious to other, above
fifteen or sixteen Days at farthest; and on that
score it was, that when a House was shut up in the
City, and any one had died of the Plague, but no
Body appear'd to be ill in the Family for sixteen or
eighteen Days after, they were not so strict, but
that they would connive at their going privately
Abroad; nor would People be much afraid of them
afterward, but rather think they were fortified the
better, having not been vulnerable when the Ene∣my
was in their own House; but we sometimes
found it had lyen much longer conceal'd.</P>
<P>Upon the foot of all these Observations, I must say,
that tho' Providence seem'd to direct my Conduct
to be otherwise; yet it is my opinion, and I must
leave it as a Prescription, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>that the best Physick
against the Plague is to run away from it.</HI> I know
People encourage themselves, by saying, God is
able to keep us in the midst of Danger, and able
to overtake us when we think our selves out of
Danger; and this kept Thousand in the Town,
whose Carcasses went into the great Pits by Cart
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
Loads; and who, if they had fled from the Danger,
had, I believe, been safe from the Disaster; at least 'tis
probable they had been safe.</P>
<P>And were this very Fundamental only duly con∣sider'd
by the People, on any future occasion of
this, or the like Nature, I am persuaded it would
put them upon quite different Measures for manag∣ing
the People, from those that they took in 1665,
or than any that have been taken Abroad that I have
heard of; in a Word, they would consider of
seperating the People into smaller Bodies, and re∣moving
them in Time farther from one another,
and not let such a Contagion as this, which is indeed
chiefly dangerous, to collected Bodies of People, find
a Million of People in a Body together, as was
very near the Case before, and would certainly be
the Case, if it should ever appear again.</P>
<P>The Plague like a great Fire, if a few Houses
only are contiguous where it happens, can only burn
a few Houses; or if it begins in a single, or as we
call it a loan House, can only burn that loan House
where it begins: But if it begins in a close built
Town, or City, and gets a Head, there its Fury
encreases, it rages over the whole Place, and con∣sumes
all it can reach.</P>
<P>I could propose many Schemes, on the foot of
which, the Government of this City, if ever they
should be under the Apprehensions of such another
Enemy, (God forbid they should) might ease them∣selves
of the greatest Part of the dangerous People
that belong to them; I mean such as the begging,
starving, labouring Poor, and among them chiefly
those who in Case of a Siege, are call'd the useless
Mouths; who being then prudently, and to their
own Advantage dispos'd of, and the wealthy Inha∣bitants
disposing of themselves, and of their Ser∣vants,
and Children, the City, and its adjacen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Parts would be so effectually evacuated, that ther<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
would not be above a tenth Part of its People left
together, for the Disease to take hold upon: But
suppose them to be a fifth Part, and that two Hun∣dred
and fifty Thousand People were left, and if it
did seize upon them, they would by their living so
much at large, be much better prepar'd to defend
themselves against the Infection, and be less liable
to the Effects of it, than if the same Number of
People lived close together in one smaller City,
such as <HI>Dublin,</HI> or <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> or the like.</P>
<P>It is true, Hundreds, yea Thousands of Fami∣lies
fled away at this last Plague, but then of them,
many fled too late, and not only died in their
Flight, but carried the Distemper with them into
the Countries where they went, and infected those
whom they went among for Safety; which confound∣ed
the Thing, and made that be a Propagation of
the Distemper, which was the best means to pre∣vent
it; and this too is an Evidence of it, and brings
me back to what I only hinted at before, but must
speak more fully to here; namely, that Men went
about apparently well, many Days after they had
the taint of the Disease in their Vitals, and after
their Spirits were so seiz'd, as that they could never
escape it; and that all the while they did so, they
were dangerous to others. <HI>I say,</HI> this proves, <HI>that
so it was;</HI> for such People infected the very Towns
they went thro', as well as the Families they went
among, and it was by that means, that almost all
the great Towns in <HI>England</HI> had the Distemper
among them, more or less; and always they would
tell you such a <HI>Londoner</HI> or such a <HI>Londoner</HI> brought
it down.</P>
<P>It must not be omitted, that when I speak of
those People who were really thus dangerous, I sup∣pose
them to be utterly ignorant of their own Con∣dition;
for if they really knew their Circumstances to be
such as indeed they were, they must have been a kind of
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
<HI>willful Murtherers,</HI> if they would have gone Abroad
among healthy People, and it would have verified
indeed the Suggestion <HI>which I mention'd above, and
which I thought seem'd untrue,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the infected
People were utterly careless as to giving the Infec∣tion
to others, and rather forward to do it than not;
and I believe it was partly from this very Thing
that they raised that Suggestion, which I hope
was not really true in Fact.</P>
<P>I confess no particular Case is sufficient to prove
a general, but I cou'd name several People within
the Knowledge of some of their Neighbours and
Families yet living, who shew'd the contrary to an
extream. One Man, a Master of a Family in my
Neighbourhood, having had the Distemper, he
thought he had it given him by a poor Workman
whom he employ'd, and whom he went to his House
to see, or went for some Work that he wanted to
have finished, and he had some Apprehensions even
while he was at the poor Workman's Door, but
did not discover it fully, but the next Day it dis∣covered
it self, and he was taken very ill; upon
which he immediately caused himself to be
carried into an out Building which he had in
his Yard, and where there was a Chamber over
a Work-house, the Man being a Brazier; here
he lay, and here he died, and would be tended
by none of his Neighbours, but by a Nurse from
Abroad, and would not suffer his Wife, or Chil∣dren,
or Servants, to come up into the Room lest
they should be infected, but sent them his Blessing
and Prayers for them by the Nurse, who spoke it
to them at a Distance, and all this for fear of giv∣ing
them the Distemper, and without which, he
knew as they were kept up, they could not have
it.</P>
<P>And here I must observe also, that the Plague, as
I suppose all Distempers do, operated in a different
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
Manner, on differing Constitutions; some were im∣mediately
overwhelm'd with it, and it came to vio∣lent
Fevers, Vomitings, unsufferable Head-achs,
Pains in the Back, and so up to Ravings and Rag∣ings
with those Pains: Others with Swellings and
Tumours in the Neck or Groyn, or Arm-pits,
which till they could be broke, put them into in∣sufferable
Agonies and Torment; while others, as I
have observ'd, were silently infected, the Fever
preying upon their Spirits insensibly, and they see∣ing
little of it, till they fell into swooning, and
faintings, and Death without pain.</P>
<P>I am not Physician enough to enter into the par∣ticular
Reasons and Manner of these differing Effects
of one and the same Distemper, and of its differ∣ing
Operation in several Bodies; nor is it my Busi∣ness
here to record the Observations, which I really
made, because the Doctors themselves, have done
that part much more effectually than I can do, and
because my opinion may in some things differ from
theirs: I am only relating what I know, or have
heard, or believe of the particular Cases, and what fell
within the Compass of my View, and the different
Nature of the Infection, as it appeared in the parti∣cular
Cases which I have related; but this may be
added too, that tho' the former Sort of those Ca∣ses,
namely those openly visited, were the worst
for themselves as to Pain, I mean those that had
such Fevers, Vomitings, Head-achs, Pains and
Swellings, because they died in such a dreadful Man∣ner,
yet the latter had the worst State of the Dis∣ease;
for in the former they frequently recover'd,
especially if the Swellings broke, but the latter
was inevitable Death; no cure, no help cou'd be
possible, nothing could follow but Death; and it
was worse also to others, because as, above, it secret∣ly,
and unperceiv'd by others, or by themselves,
communicated Death to those they convers'd witb,
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
the penetrating Poison insinuating it self into their
Blood in a Manner, which it is impossible to de∣scribe,
or indeed conceive.</P>
<P>This infecting and being infected, without so
much as its being known to either Person, is evi∣dent
from two Sorts of Cases, which frequently
happened at that Time; and there is hardly any
Body living who was in <HI>London</HI> during the Infec∣tion,
but must have known several of the Cases of
both Sorts.</P>
<P>1. Fathers and Mothers have gone about as
if they had been well, and have believ'd them∣selves
to be so, till they have insensibly infected,
and been the Destruction of their whole Families:
Which they would have been far from doing,
if they had the least Apprehensions of their be∣ing
unsound and dangerous themselves. A Family,
whose Story I have heard, was thus infected by the
Father, and the Distemper began to appear upon
some of them, even before he found it upon him∣self;
but searching more narrowly, it appear'd he
had been infected some Time, and as soon as he
found that his Family had been poison'd by himself,
he went distracted, and would have laid violent
Hands upon himself, but was kept from that by
those who look'd to him, and in a few Days
died.</P>
<P>2. The other Particular is, that many People hav∣ing
been well to the best of their own Judgment, or by
the best Observation which they could make of
themselves for several Days, and only finding a De∣cay
of Appetite, or a light Sickness upon their Sto∣mach;
nay, some whose Appetite has been strong,
and even craving, and only a light Pain in their
Heads; have sent for Physicians to know what
ail'd them, and have been found to their great Sur∣prize,
at the brink of Death, the Tokens upon
them, or the Plague grown up to an incurable Height.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="235"/>
It was very sad to reflect, how such a Person <HI>as
this last mentioned above,</HI> had been a walking Destroy∣er,
perhaps for a Week or Fortnight before that;
how he had ruin'd those, that he would have hazar∣ded
his Life to save, and had been breathing Death up∣on
them, even perhaps in his tender Kissing and
Embracings of his own Children: Yet thus certain∣ly
it was, and often has been, and I cou'd give
many particular Cases where it has been so; if then
the Blow is thus insensibly stricken; if the Arrow
flies thus unseen, and cannot be discovered; to what
purpose are all the Schemes for shutting up or re∣moving
the sick People? those Schemes cannot take
place, but upon those that appear to be sick, or to
be infected; whereas there are among them, at the
same time, Thousands of People, who seem to be
well, but are all that while carrying Death with
them into all Companies which they come into.</P>
<P>This frequently puzzled our Physicians, and espe∣cially
the Apothecaries and Surgeons, who knew
not how to discover the Sick from the Sound; they
all allow'd <HI>that it was really so,</HI> that many People
had the Plague in their very Blood, and preying up∣on
their Spirits, and were in themselves but walking
putrified Carcasses, whose Breath was infectious,
and their Sweat Poison; and yet were as well to
look on as other People, and even knew it not them∣selves:
I say, they all allowed that it was really true
in Fact, but they knew not how to propose a Dis∣covery.</P>
<P>My Friend Doctor <HI>Heath</HI> was of Opinion, that
it might be known by the smell of their Breath;
but then, <HI>as he said,</HI> who durst Smell to that Breath
for his Information? Since to know it, he must
draw the Stench of the Plague up into his own
Brain, in order to distinguish the Smell! I have
heard, it was the opinion of others, that it might be
distinguish'd by the Party's breathing upon a piece of
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
Glass, where the Breath condensing, there might
living Creatures be seen by a Microscope of strange
monstrous and frightful Shapes, such as Dragons,
Snakes, Serpents, and Devils, horrible to behold:
But this I very much question the Truth of, and
we had no Microscopes at that Time, as I remem∣ber,
to make the Experiment with.</P>
<P>It was the opinion also of another learned Man,
that the Breath of such a Person would poison, and
instantly kill a Bird; not only a small Bird, but even
a Cock or Hen, and that if it did not immediately
kill the latter, it would cause them to be roupy <HI>as
they call it;</HI> particularly that if they had laid any
Eggs at that Time, they would be all rotten: But
those are Opinions which I never found supported
by any Experiments, or heard of others that had
seen it; so I leave them as I find them, only with
this Remark; namely, that I think the Probabili∣ties
are very strong for them.</P>
<P>Some have proposed that such Persons should
breath hard upon warm Water, and that they would
leave an unusual Scum upon it, or upon several
other things, especially such as are of a glutinous
Substance and are apt to receive a Scum and support it.</P>
<P>But from the whole I found, that the Nature of this
Contagion was such, that it was impossible to discover
it at all, or to prevent its spreading from one to ano∣ther
by any human Skill.</P>
<P>Here was indeed one Difficulty, which I could ne∣ver
throughly get over to this time, and which there
is but one way of answering that I know of, and it is
this, <HI>viz.</HI> The first Person that died of the Plague
was in <HI>Decemb.</HI> 20<SUP>th</SUP>, or thereabouts 1664, and in,
or about <HI>Long-acre,</HI> whence the first Person had the
Infection, was generally said to be, from a Parcel of Silks
imported from <HI>Holland,</HI> and first opened in that House.</P>
<P>But after this we heard no more of any Person dying
of the Plague, or of the Distemper being in that
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
Place, till the 9<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>February;</HI> which was about 7
Weeks after, and then one more was buried out of
the same House: Then it was hush'd, and we were
perfectly easy as to the publick, for a great while;
for there were no more entred in the Weekly Bill
to be dead of the Plague, till the 22<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> when
there was 2 more buried not out of the same House,
but out of the same Street; and as near as I can re∣member,
it was out of the next House to the first:
this was nine Weeks asunder, and after this we had
No more till a Fortnight, and then it broke out in
several Streets and spread every way. Now the
Question seems to lye thus, <HI>where lay the Seeds of
the Infection all this while? How came it to stop so
long, and not stop any longer?</HI> Either the Di∣stemper
did not come immediately by Contagion
from Body to Body, or if it did, then a Body may
be capable to continue infected, without the Disease
discovering itself, many Days, nay Weeks together,
even not a Quarentine of Days only, but Soixan∣tine,
not only 40 Days but 60 Days or longer.</P>
<P>It's true, there was, as I observed at first, and is well
known to many yet living, a very cold Winter, and a
long Frost, which continued three Months, and this,
the Doctors say, might check the Infection; but then
the learned must allow me to say, that if according
to their Notion, the Disease was, as I may say, on∣ly
frozen up, it would like a frozen River, have
returned to its usual Force and Current when it
thaw'd, whereas the principal Recess of this Infection,
which was from <HI>February</HI> to <HI>April,</HI> was after the
Frost was broken, and the Weather mild and warm.</P>
<P>But there is another way of solving all this Diffi∣culty,
which I think my own Remembrance of the
thing will supply; and that is, the Fact is not granted,
namely, that there died none in those long Inter∣vals,
<HI>viz.</HI> from the 20<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>December</HI> to the 9<SUP>th</SUP> of
<HI>February,</HI> and from thence to the 22<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>April.</HI>

The Weekly Bills are the only Evidence on the other
side, and those Bills were not of Credit enough, at
least with me, to support an <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> or determine
a Question of such Importance as this: For it was
our receiv'd Opinion at that time, and I believe upon
very good Grounds, that the Fraud lay in the Parish
Officers, Searchers, and Persons appointed to give
Account of the Dead, and what Diseases they died
of: And as People were very loth at first to have
the Neighbours believe their Houses were infected,
so they gave Money to procure, or otherwise pro∣cur'd
the dead Persons to be return'd as dying of
other Distempers; and this I know was practis'd
afterwards in many Places, I believe I might say in
all Places, where the Distemper came, as will be
seen by the vast Encrease of the Numbers plac'd in
the Weekly Bills under other Articles of Diseases,
during the time of the Infection: <HI>For Example,</HI> in
the Month of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> when the Plague was
coming on to its highest Pitch; it was very ordinary
to have from a thousand to twelve hundred, nay to
almost fifteen Hundred a Week of other Distem∣pers;
not that the Numbers of those Distempers
were really encreased to such a Degree: But the
great Number of Families and Houses where really
the Infection was, obtain'd the Favour to have their
dead be return'd of other Distempers to prevent the
shutting up their Houses. <HI>For Example,</HI>

<P>There were several other Articles which bare a
Proportion to these, and which it is easy to perceive,
were increased on the same Account, as <HI>Aged, Con∣sumptions,
Vomitings, Imposthumes, Gripes,</HI> and the
like, many of which were not doubted to be infec∣ted
People; but as it was of the utmost Consequence
to Families not to be known to be infected, if it was
possible to avoid it, so they took all the measures
they could to have it not believ'd; and if any died
in their Houses to get them return'd to the Exami∣ners,
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
and by the Searchers, as having died of other
Distempers.</P>
<P>This, I say, will account for the long Interval,
which, <HI>as I have said,</HI> was between the dying of the
first Persons that were returend in the Bill to be
dead of the Plague, and the time when the Distem∣per
spread openly, and could not be conceal'd.</P>
<P>Besides, the Weekly Bills themselves at that time
evidently discover this Truth; for while there was
no Mention of the Plague, and no Increase, after it
had been mentioned, yet it was apparent, that there
was an Encrease of those Distempers which bor∣dered
nearest upon it, for Example there were Eight,
Twelve, Seventeen of the Spotted Fever in a Week,
when there were none, or but very few of the Plague;
whereas before <HI>One, Three,</HI> or <HI>Four,</HI> were the ordi∣nary
Weekly Numbers of that Distemper; likewise,
as I observed before, the Burials increased Weekly
in that particular Parish, and the Parishes adjacent,
more than in any other Parish, altho' there were none
set down of the Plague; all which tells us, that the
Infection was handed on, and the Succession of the
Distemper really preserv'd, tho' it seem'd to us at
that time to be ceased, and to come again in a man∣ner
surprising.</P>
<P>It might be also, that the Infection might remain
in other parts of the same Parcel of Goods which at
first it came in, and which might not be perhaps
opened, or at least not fully, or in the Cloths of the
first infected Person; for I cannot think, that any
Body could be seiz'd with the Contagion in a fatal
and mortal Degree for nine Weeks together, and
support his State of Health so well, as even not to
discover it to themselves; yet if it were so, the Ar∣gument
is the stronger in Favour of what I am say∣ing;
namely, that the Infection is retain'd in Bodies
apparently well, and convey'd from them to those they
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
converse with, while it is known to neither the one
nor the other.</P>
<P>Great were the Confusions at that time upon this
very Account; and when People began to be con∣vinc'd
that the Infection was receiv'd in this sur∣prising
manner from Persons apparently well, they
began to be exceeding shie and jealous of every one
that came near them. Once in a publick Day, whe∣ther
a Sabbath Day or not I do not remember, in
<HI>Aldgate</HI> Church in a Pew full of People, on a sud∣en,
one fancy'd she smelt an ill Smell, immediately
she fancies the Plague was in the Pew, whispers her
Notion or Suspicion to the next, then rises and
goes out of the Pew, it immediately took with the
next, and so to them all; and every one of them, and
of the two or three adjoining Pews, got up and
went out of the Church, no Body knowing what
it was offended them or from whom.</P>
<P>This immediately filled every Bodies Mouths with
one Preparation or other, such as the old Women
directed, and some perhaps as Physicians directed, in
order to prevent Infection by the Breath of others;
insomuch that if we came to go into a Church,
when it was any thing full of People, there would
be such a Mixture of Smells at the Entrance, that it
was much more strong, tho' perhaps not so whole∣some,
than if you were going into an Apothecary's
or Druggist's Shop; in a Word, the whole Church
was like a smelling Bottle, in one Corner it was all
Perfumes, in another Aromaticks, Balsamicks, and
Variety of Drugs, and Herbs; in another Salts and
Spirits, as every one was furnish'd for their own
Preservation; yet I observ'd, that after People were
possess'd, <HI>as I have said,</HI> with the Belief or rather
Assurance, of the Infection being thus carryed on by
Persons apparently in Health, the Churches and
Meeting-Houses were much thinner of People than
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
at other times before that they us'd to be; for this
is to be said of the People of <HI>London,</HI> that during
the whole time of the Pestilence, the Churches or
Meetings were never wholly shut up, nor did the
People decline coming out to the public Worship
of God, except only insome Parishes when the Vio∣lence
of the Distemper was more particularly in that
Parish at that time; and even then no longer, than
it continued to be so.</P>
<P>Indeed nothing was more strange, than to see
with what Courage the People went to the public
Service of God, even at that time when they were
afraid to stir out of their own Houses upon any other
Occasion; this I mcan before the time of Despera∣tion,
which I have mention'd already; this was a
Proof of the exceeding Populousness of the City at
the time of the Infection, notwithstanding the great
Numbers that were gone into the Country at the
first Alarm, and that fled out into the Forests and
Woods when they were farther terrifyed with the
extraordinary Increase of it. For when we came to
see the Crouds and Throngs of People, which ap∣pear'd
on the Sabbath Days at the Churches, and
especially in those parts of the Town where the
Plague was abated, or where it was not yet come
to its Height, it was amazing. But of this I shall
speak again presently; I return in the mean time
to the Article of infecting one another at first;
before People came to right Notions of the Infe∣ction,
and of infecting one another, People were
only shye of those that were really sick, a Man with
a Cap upon his Head, or with Cloths round his Neck,
<HI>which was the Case of those that had Swellings there;</HI>
such was indeed frightful: But when we saw a Gentle∣man
dress'd, with his Band on and his Gloves in his
Hand, his Hat upon his Head, and his Hair comb'd,
of such we had not the least Apprehensions; and
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
People converse a great while freely, <HI>especially with
their Neighbours and such as they knew.</HI> But when
the Physicians assured us, that the Danger was as
well from the Sound, that is <HI>the seemingly sound,</HI> as the
Sick; and that those People, who thought themselves
entirely free, were oftentimes the most fatal; and that
it came to be generally understood, that People were
sensible of it, and of the reason of it: Then I say
they began to be jealous of every Body, and a vast
Number of People lock'd themselves up, so as not
to come abroad into any Company at all, nor suf∣fer
any, that had been abroad in promiscuous Com∣pany,
to come into their Houses, or near them; at
least not so near them, as to be within the Reach of
their Breath, or of any Smell from them; and when
they were oblig'd to converse at a Distance with
Strangers, they would always have Preservatives in
their Mouths, and about their Cloths to repell and
keep off the Infection.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledg'd, that when People began
to use these Cautions, they were less exposed to
Danger, and the Infection did not break into such
Houses so furiously as it did into others before,
and thousands of Families were preserved, <HI>speaking
with due Reserve to the Direction of Divine Provi∣dence,</HI>
by that Means.</P>
<P>But it was impossible to beat any thing into the
Heads of the Poor, they went on with the usual Im∣petuosity
of their Tempers full of Outcries and
Lamentations when taken, but madly careless of
themselves, Fool-hardy and obstinate, while they
were well: Where they could get Employment they
push'd into any kind of Business, the most dangerous
and the most liable to Infection; and if they were
spoken to, their Answer would be, <HI>I must trust to
God for that; if I am taken, then I am provided for,
and there is an End of me,</HI> and the like: OR THUS,
<HI>Why, What must I do? I can't starve, I had as
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
good have the Plague as perish for want. I have no
Work, what could I do? I must do this or beg:</HI> Sup∣pose
it was burying the dead, or attending the Sick,
or watching infected Houses, which were all ter∣rible
Hazards, but their Tale was generally the same.
It is true Necessity was a very justifiable warran∣table
Plea, and nothing could be better; but their
way of Talk was much the same, where the Neces∣sities
were not the same: This adventurous Con∣duct
of the Poor was that which brought the Plague
among them in a most furious manner, and this
join'd to the Distress of their Circumstances, when
taken, was the reason why they died so by Heaps;
for I cannot say, I could observe one jot of better
Husbandry among them, I mean the labouring Poor,
while they were well and getting Money, than
there was before, but as lavish, as extravagant, and
as thoughtless for to Morrow as ever; so that when
they came to be taken sick, they were immediate∣ly
in the utmost Distress as well for want, as for
Sickness, as well for lack of Food, as lack of
Health.</P>
<P>This Misery of the Poor I had many Occasions
to be an Eye-witness of, and sometimes also of the
charitable Assistance that some pious People daily
gave to such, sending them Relief and Supplies
both of Food, Physick and other Help, as they found
they wanted; and indeed it is a Debt of Justice due
to the Temper of the People of that Day to take
Notice here, that not only great Sums, <HI>very great</HI>
Sums of Money were charitably sent to the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen for the Assistance and Sup∣port
of the poor distemper'd People; but abundance
of private People daily distributed large Sums of
Money for their Relief, and sent People about to
enquire into the Condition of particular distressed and
visited Families, and relieved them; nay some pious
Ladies were so transported with Zeal in so good a
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
Work, and so confident in the Protection of Pro∣vidence
in Discharge of the great Duty of Charity,
that they went about in person distributing Alms to
the Poor, and even visiting poor Families, tho' sick
and infected in their very Houses, appointing Nurses
to attend those that wanted attending, and ordering
Apothecaries and Surgeons, the first to supply them
with Drugs or Plai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters, and such things as they
wanted; and the last to lance and dress the Swel∣lings
and Tumours, where such were wanting; giv∣ing
their Blessing to the Poor in substantial Relief
to them, as well as hearty Prayers for them.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to say, as some do, that none
of these charitable People were suffered to fall under
the Calamity itself; but this I may say, that I ne∣ver
knew any one of them that miscarried, which
I mention for the Encouragement of others in case
of the like Distress; and doubtless, <HI>if they that give
to the Poor, lend to the Lord, and he will repay them;</HI>
those that hazard their Lives to give to the Poor,
and to comfort and assist the Poor in such a Misery
as this, may hope to be protected in the Work.</P>
<P>Nor was this Charity so extraordinary eminent on∣ly
in a few; but, (<HI>for I cannot lightly quit this Point</HI>)
the Charity of the rich as well in the City and Sub∣urbs
as from the Country, was so great, that in a
Word, a prodigious Number of People, who must
otherwise inevitably have perished for want as well
as Sickness, were supported and sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by it; and
tho' I could never, nor I believe any one else come
to a full Knowledge of what was so contributed,
yet I do believe, that as I heard one say, that was
a critical Observer of that Part, there was not on∣ly
many Thousand Pounds contributed, but many
hundred thousand Pounds, to the Relief of the Poor
of this distressed afflicted City; nay one Man affirm'd to
me that he could reckon up above one hundred thou∣sand
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
Pounds a Week, which was distributed by the
Church Wardens at the several Parish Vestries,
by the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen in the several
Wards and Precincts, and by the particular Direction
of the Court and of the Justices respectively in the parts
where they resided; over and above the private Cha∣rity
distributed by pious Hands in the manner I speak
of, and this continued for many Weeks together.</P>
<P>I confess this is a very great Sum; but if it be
true, that there was distributed in the Parish of
<HI>Cripplegate</HI> only 17800 Pounds in one Week to the
Relief of the Poor, as I heard reported, and which
I really believe was true, the other may not be im∣probable.</P>
<P>It was doubtless to be reckon'd among the many
signal good Providences which attended this great
City, <HI>and of which there were many other worth re∣cording;</HI>
I say, this was a very remarkable one,
that it pleased God thus to move the Hearts of the
People in all parts of the Kingdom, so chearfully to
contribute to the Relief and Support of the poor
at <HI>London;</HI> the good Consequences of which were
felt many ways, and particularly in preserving the
Lives and recovering the Health of so many thou∣sands,
and keeping so many Thousands of Families
from perishing and starving.</P>
<P>And now I am talking of the merciful Disposition
of Providence in this time of Calamity, I cannot
but mention again, tho' I have spoken several times
of it already on other Account, I mean that of the
Progression of the Distemper; how it began at one
end of the Town, and proceeded gradually and slow∣ly
from one Part to another, and like a dark Cloud
that passes over our Heads, which as it thickens and
overcasts the Air at one End, clears up at the
other end: So while the Plague went on raging from
West to East, as it went forwards East, it abated
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
in the West, by which means those parts of the
Town, which were not seiz'd, or who were left,
and where it had spent its Fury, were (as it were)
spar'd to help and assist the other; whereas had the
Distemper spread it self over the whole City and
Suburbs at once, raging in all Places alike, as it has
done since in some Places abroad, the whole Body
of the People must have been overwhelmed, and there
would have died twenty thousand a Day, as they
say there did at <HI>Naples,</HI> nor would the People have
been able to have help'd or assisted one another.</P>
<P>For it must be observ'd that where the Plague was
in its full Force, there indeed the People were very
miserable, and the Consternation was inexpressible.
But a little before it reach'd even to that place, or
presently after it was gone, they were quite another
Sort of People, and I cannot but acknowledge, that
there was too much of that common Temper of
Mankind to be found among us all at that time;
namely to forget the Deliverance, when the Danger
is past: But I shall come to speak of that part
again.</P>
<P>It must not be forgot here to take some Notice
of the State of Trade, during the time of this com∣mon
Calamity, and this with respect to Foreign
Trade, as also to our Home-trade.</P>
<P>As to Foreign Trade, there needs little to be
said; the trading Nations of Europe were all afraid
of us, no Port of <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> or
<HI>Italy</HI> would admit our Ships or correspond with us;
indeed we stood on ill Terms with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
were in a furious War with them, but tho' in
a bad Condition to fight abroad, who had such
dreadful Enemies to struggle with at Home.</P>
<P>Our Merchants accordingly were at a full Stop,
their Ships could go no where, that is to say to no
place abroad; their Manufactures and Merchandise,
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
that is to say, of our Growth, would not be touch'd
abroad; they were as much afraid of our Goods,
as they were of our People; and indeed they had
reason, for our woolen Manufactures are as reten∣tive
of Infection as human Bodies, and if pack'd up
by Persons infected would receive the Infection, and
be as dangerous to touch, as a Man would be that
was infected; and therefore when any <HI>English</HI> Vessel
arriv'd in Foreign Countries, if they did take the
Goods on Shore, they always caused the Bales to
be opened and air'd in Places appointed for that
Purpose: But from <HI>London</HI> they would not suffer
them to come into Port, much less to unlade their
Goods upon any Terms whatever; and this Strictness
was especially us'd with them in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> in
<HI>Turkey</HI> and the Islands of the <HI>Arches</HI> indeed as they are
call'd, as well those belonging to the <HI>Turks</HI> as to the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> they were not so very rigid; in the first
there was no Obstruction at all; and four Ships, which
were then in the River loading for <HI>Italy,</HI> that is
for <HI>Leghorn</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> being denyed Product, <HI>as they
call it,</HI> went on to <HI>Turkey,</HI> and were freely admitted
to unlade their Cargo without any Difficulty, only
that when they arriv'd there, some of their Cargo
was not fit for Sale in that Country, and other
Parts of it being consign'd to Merchants at <HI>Leghorn,</HI>
the Captains of the Ships had no Right nor any Or∣ders
to dispose of the Goods; so that great Incon∣veniences
followed to the Merchants. But this was no∣thing
but what the Necessity of Affairs requir'd, and
the Merchants at <HI>Leghorn</HI> and at <HI>Naples</HI> having No∣tice
given them, sent again from thence to take
Care of the Effects, which were particularly con∣sign'd
to those Ports, and to bring back in other
Ships such as were improper for the Markets at
<HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Scanderoon.</HI></P>
<P>The Inconveniences in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> were
still greater; for they would, by no means, suffer
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
our Ships, especially those from <HI>London,</HI> to come
into any of their Ports, much less to unlade; there
was a Report, that one of our Ships having by
Stealth delivered her Cargo, among which was some
Bales of <HI>English</HI> Cloth, Cotton, Kersyes, and such
like Goods, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> caused all the Goods to
be burnt, and punished the Men with Death who
were concern'd in carrying them on Shore. This I
believe was in Part true, tho' I do not affirm it: But it
is not at all unlikely, seeing the Danger was real∣ly
very great, the Infection being so violent in <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></P>
<P>I heard likewise that the Plague was carryed into
those Countries by some of our Ships, and parti∣cularly
to the Port of <HI>Faro</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Al∣garve,</HI>
belonging to the King of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and that
several Persons died of it there, but it was not con∣firm'd.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, tho' the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI>
were so shie of us, it is most certain, that the
Plague, <HI>as has been said,</HI> keeping at first much at
that end of the Town next <HI>Westminster,</HI> the mer∣chandising
part of the Town, such as the City and
the Water-side, was perfectly sound, till at least the
Beginning of <HI>July;</HI> and the Ships in the River till
the Beginning of <HI>August;</HI> for to the 1<SUP>st</SUP> of <HI>July,</HI>
there had died but seven within the whole City,
and but 60 within the Liberties; but one in all
the Parishes of <HI>Stepney, Aldgate,</HI> and <HI>White-Chap∣pel;</HI>
and but two in all the eight Parishes of <HI>South∣wark.</HI>
But it was the same thing abroad, for the
bad News was gone over the whole World, that
the City of <HI>London</HI> was infected with the Plague;
and there was no inquiring there, how the Infec∣tion
proceeded, or at which part of the Town it
was begun, or was reach'd to.</P>
<P>Besides, after it began to spread, it increased so
fast, and the Bills grew so high, all on a sudden,
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
that it was to no purpose to lessen the Report of it,
or endeavour to make the People abroad think it
better than it was, the Account which the Week∣ly
Bills gave in was sufficient; and that there died
two thousand to three or four thousand a Week, was
sufficient to alarm the whole trading part of the
World, and the following time being so dreadful
also in the very City it self, put the whole World,
<HI>I say,</HI> upon their Guard against it.</P>
<P>You may be sure also, that the Report of these
things lost nothing in the Carriage, the Plague was
it self very terrible, and the Distress of the People
very great, as you may observe by what I have said:
But the Rumor was infinitely greater, and it must
not be wonder'd, that our Friends abroad, as my
Brother's Correspondents in particular were told there,
namely in <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> where he chiefly traded,
that in <HI>London</HI> there died twenty thousand in a Week;
that the dead Bodies lay unburied by Heaps; that
the living were not sufficient to bury the dead,
or the Sound to look after the Sick; that all
the Kingdom was infected likewise, so that it was
an universal Malady, such as was never heard of in
those parts of the World; and they could hardly
believe us, when we gave them an Account how
things really were, and how there was not above
one Tenth part of the People dead; that there was
500000 left that lived all the time in the Town;
that now the People began to walk the Streets
again, and those, who were fled, to return, there
was no Miss of the usual Throng of people in the
Streets, except as every Family might miss their Re∣lations
and Neighbours, and the like; I say they could
not believe these things; and if Enquiry were now
to be made in <HI>Naples,</HI> or in other Cities on the
Coast of <HI>Italy,</HI> they would tell you that there was
a dreadful Infection in <HI>London</HI> so many Years ago;
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
in which, <HI>as above,</HI> there died Twenty Thousand
in a Week, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Just as we have had it reported in
<HI>London,</HI> that there was a Plague in the City of <HI>Naples,</HI>
in the Year 1656, in which there died 20000 People
in a Day, of which I have had very good Satisfac∣tion,
that it was utterly false.</P>
<P>But these extravagant Reports were very preju∣dicial
to our Trade as well as unjust and injurious
in themselves; for it was a long Time after the
Plague was quite over, before our Trade could re∣cover
it self in those parts of the World; and the
<HI>Flemings</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> but especially the last, made
very great Advantages of it, having all the Market
to themselves, and even buying our Manufactures
in the several Parts of <HI>England</HI> where the Plague
was not, and carrying them to <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
and from thence transporting them to <HI>Spain,</HI>
and to <HI>Italy,</HI> as if they had been of their own mak∣ing.</P>
<P>But they were detected sometimes and punish'd,
that is to say, their Goods confiscated, and Ships
also; for if it was true, that our Manufactures, as
well as our People, were infected, and that it was
dangerous to touch or to open, and receive the
Smell of them; then those People ran the hazard by
that clandestine Trade, not only of carrying the
Contagion into their own Country, but also of in∣fecting
the Nations to whom they traded with those
Goods; which, considering how many Lives might
be lost in Consequence of such an Action, must be
a Trade that no Men of Conscience could suffer
themselves to be concern'd in.</P>
<P>I do not take upon me to say, that any harm was
done, I mean of that Kind, by those People: But I
doubt, I need not make any such Proviso in the
Case of our own Country; for either by our Peo∣ple
of <HI>London,</HI> or by the Commerce, which made
their conversing with all Sorts of People in every
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
County, and of every considerable Town, necessary,
I say, by this means the Plague was first or last
spread all over the Kingdom, as well in <HI>London</HI> as
in all the Cities and great Towns, especially in the
trading Manufacturing Towns, and Sea-Ports; so
that first or last, all the considerable Places in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
were visited more or less, and the Kingdom of
<HI>Ireland</HI> in some Places, but not so universally; how
it far'd with the People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I had no op∣portunity
to enquire.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd, that while the Plague conti∣nued
so violent in <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>out Ports,</HI> as they are
call'd, enjoy'd a very great Trade, especially to the
adjacent Countries, and to our own Plantations;
for Example, the Towns of <HI>Colchester, Yarmouth,</HI>
and <HI>Hull,</HI> on that side of <HI>England,</HI> exported to <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> the Manufactures of the adja∣cent
Counties for several Months after the Trade
with <HI>London</HI> was as it were entirely shut up; like∣wise
the Cities of <HI>Bristol</HI> and <HI>Exeter</HI> with the Port
of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> had the like Advantage to <HI>Spain,</HI> to
the <HI>Canaries,</HI> to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and to the <HI>West Indies;</HI>
and particularly to <HI>Ireland;</HI> but as the Plague spread
it self every way after it had been in <HI>London,</HI> to such
a Degree as it was in <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September;</HI> so all,
or most of those Cities and Towns were infected
first or last, and then Trade was as it were under a
general Embargo, or at a full stop, as I shall ob∣serve
farther, when I speak of our home Trade.</P>
<P>One thing however must be observed, that as to
Ships coming in from Abroad, as many you may be
sure did, some, who were out in all Parts of the World
a considerable while before, and some who when they
went out knew nothing of an Infection, or at least of
one so terrible; these came up the River boldly,
and delivered their Cargoes as they were oblig'd to
do, except just in the two Months of <HI>August</HI> and <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI>
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
when the Weight of the Infection lying,
as I may say, all below Bridge, no Body durst ap∣pear
in Business for a while: But as this continued
but for a few Weeks, the Homeward bound Ships,
especially such whose Cargoes were not liable to
spoil, came to an Anchor for a Time, short of THE
POOL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That Part of the River where the Ships lye up when they come Home, is call'd the <HI>Pool,</HI> and takes in all the River on both Sides of the Water, from the <HI>Tower</HI> to <HI>Cuckold</HI>'s Point, and <HI>Lime∣house.</HI></NOTE>, or fresh Water part of the River, even
as low as the River <HI>Medway,</HI> where several of them
ran in, and others lay at the <HI>Nore,</HI> and in the <HI>Hope</HI>
below <HI>Gravesend:</HI> So that by the latter end of <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI>
there was a very great Fleet of Homeward
bound Ships to come up, such as the like had not
been known for many Years.</P>
<P>Two particular Trades were carried on by Water
Carriage all the while of the Infection, and that
with little or no Interruption, very much to the
Advantage and Comfort of the poor distressed Peo∣ple
of the City, and those were the coasting Trade
for Corn, and the <HI>Newcastle</HI> Trade for Coals.</P>
<P>The first of these was particularly carried on by
small Vessels, from the Port of <HI>Hull,</HI> and other
Places in the <HI>Humber,</HI> by which great Quantities
of Corn were brought in from <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>Lin∣colnshire:</HI>
The other part of this Corn-Trade was
from <HI>Lynn</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> from <HI>Wells,</HI> and <HI>Burnham,</HI>
and from <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> all in the same County; and
the third Branch was from the River <HI>Medway,</HI> and
from <HI>Milton, Feversham, Margate,</HI> and <HI>Sandwich,</HI>
and all the other little Places and Ports round the
Coast of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P>There was also a very good Trade from the Coast
of <HI>Suffolk</HI> with Corn, Butter and Cheese; these
Vessels kept a constant Course of Trade, and with∣out
Interruption came up to that Market known
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
still by the Name of <HI>Bear-Key,</HI> where they supply'd
the City plentifully with Corn, when Land Carri∣age
began to fail, and when the People began to
be sick of coming from many Places in the Country.</P>
<P>This also was much of it owing to the Pru∣dence
and Conduct of the Lord Mayor, who took
such care to keep the Masters and Seamen from
Danger, when they came up, causing their Corn to
be bought off at any time they wanted a Market,
(which however was very seldom) and causing the
Corn-Factors immediately to unlade and deliver the
Vessels loaden with Corn, that they had very little
occasion to come out of their Ships or Vessels, the
Money being always carried on Board to them, and
put into a Pail of Vinegar before it was car∣ried.</P>
<P>The second Trade was, that of Coals from <HI>New∣castle</HI>
upon <HI>Tyne;</HI> without which the City would
have been greatly distressed; for not in the Streets
only, but in private Houses and Families, great
Quantities of Coals were then burnt, even all the
Summer long, and when the Weather was hottest,
which was done by the Advice of the Physicians;
some indeed oppos'd it, and insisted that to keep
the Houses and Rooms hot, was a means to propa∣gate
the Distemper, which was a Fermentation and
Heat already in the Blood, that it was known to
spread, and increase in hot Weather, and abate in
cold, and therefore they alledg'd that all contagious
Distempers are the worse for Heat, because the Con∣tagion
was nourished, and gain'd Strength in hot
Weather, and was as it were propagated in Heat.</P>
<P>Others said, they granted, that Heat in the Cli∣mate
might propagate Infection, as sultry hot Wea∣ther
fills the Air with Vermine, and nourishes innu∣merable
Numbers, and Kinds of venomous Creatures,
which breed in our Food, in the Plants, and even in
our Bodies, by the very stench of which, Infection
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
may be propagated; also, that heat in the Air, or
heat of Weather, <HI>as we ordinarly call it,</HI> makes Bo∣dies
relax and faint, exhausts the Spirits, opens the
Pores, and makes us more apt to receive Infection,
or any evil Influence, be it from noxious pestilen∣tial
Vapors, or any other Thing in the Air: But
that the heat of Fire, and especially of Coal Fires
kept in our Houses, or near us, had a quite different
Operation, the Heat being not of the same Kind,
but quick and fierce, tending not to nourish but to
consume, and dissipate all those noxious Fumes,
which the other kind of Heat rather exhaled, and
stagnated, than separated, and burnt up; besides it
was alledg'd, that the sulphurous and nitrous Parti∣cles,
that are often found to be in the Coal, with
that bituminous Substance which burns, are all as∣sisting
to clear and purge the Air, and render it
wholsom and safe to breath in, after the noctious
Particles as above are dispers'd and burnt up.</P>
<P>The latter Opinion prevail'd at that Time, and
as I must confess I think with good Reason, and
the Experience of the Citizens confirm'd it, many
Houses which had constant Fires kept in the Rooms,
having never been infected at all; and I must join
my Experience to it, for I found the keeping good
Fires kept our Rooms sweet and wholsom, and I do
verily believe made our whole Family so, more than
would otherwise have been.</P>
<P>But I return to the Coals as a Trade, it was with
no little difficulty that this Trade was kept open,
and particularly because as we were in an open
War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at that Time, the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Capers at first took a great many of our Collier
Ships, which made the rest cautious, and made
them to stay to come in Fleets together: But after
some time, the Capers were either afraid to take
them, or their Masters, the States, were afraid they
should, and forbad them, lest the Plague should be
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
among them, which made them fare the bet∣ter.</P>
<P>For the Security of those <HI>Northern</HI> Traders, the
Coal Ships were order'd by my Lord Mayor, not
to come up into the <HI>Pool</HI> above a certain Number
at a Time, and order'd Lighters, and other Vessels,
such as the Wood-mongers, that is the <HI>Wharf</HI>
Keepers, or Coal-Sellers furnished, to go down, and
take out the Coals as low as <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Green∣wich,</HI>
and some farther down.</P>
<P>Others deliver'd great Quantities of Coals in par∣ticular
Places, where the Ships cou'd come to the
Shoar, as at <HI>Greenwich, Blackwal,</HI> and other Pla∣ces,
in vast Heaps, as if to be kept for Sale; but
were then fetch'd away, after the Ships which
brought them were gone; so that the Seamen had
no Communication with the River-Men, nor so
much as came near one another.</P>
<P>Yet all this Caution, could not effectually pre∣vent
the Distemper getting among the Colliery,
that is to say, among the Ships, by which a great
many Seamen died of it; and that which was still
worse, was, that they carried it down to <HI>Ipswich,</HI>
and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> to <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> and other
Places on the Coast; where, especially at <HI>Newcastle</HI>
and at <HI>Sunderland,</HI> it carried off a great Number of
People.</P>
<P>The making so many Fires as above, did indeed
consume an unusual Quantity of Coals; and that up∣on
one or two stops of the Ships coming up, whe∣ther
by contrary Weather, or by the Interruption
of Enemies, I do not remember, but the Price of
Coals was exceeding dear, even as high as 4 l. a
Chalder, but it soon abated when the Ships came
in, and as afterwards they had a freer Passage, the
Price was very reasonable all the rest of that Year.</P>
<P>The publick Fires which were made on these
Occasions, as I have calculated it, must necessarily
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
have cost the City about 200 Chalder of Coals a
Week, if they had continued, which was in∣deed
a very great Quantity; but as it was, thought
necessary, nothing was spar'd; however as some of
the Physicians cry'd them down, they were not kept
a-light above four or five Days; the Fires were or∣der'd
thus.</P>
<P>One at the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> one at <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> one
at <HI>Queen-hith,</HI> and one at the <HI>Three Cranes,</HI> one in
<HI>Black Friers,</HI> and one at the Gate of <HI>Bridewel,</HI> one
at the Corner of <HI>Leadenhal</HI> Street, and <HI>Grace-church,</HI>
one at the <HI>North,</HI> and one at the <HI>South</HI> Gate of the
<HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> one at <HI>Guild Hall,</HI> and one at
<HI>Blackwell-hall</HI> Gate, one at the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI>'s Door,
in St. <HI>Helens,</HI> one at the West Entrance <HI>in∣to</HI>
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, and one at the Entrance into <HI>Bow</HI>
Church: I do not remember whether there was any
at the City Gates, but one at the <HI>Bridge</HI> foot there
was, just by St. <HI>Magnus</HI> Church.</P>
<P>I know, some have quarrell'd since that at the
Experiment, and said, that there died the more
People, because of those Fires; but I am persuaded
those that say so, offer no Evidence to prove it,
neither can I believe it on any Account whatever.</P>
<P>It remains to give some Account of the State of
Trade at home in <HI>England</HI> during this dreadful
Time, and particularly as it relates to the Manufac∣tures,
and the Trade in the City: At the first break∣ing
out of the Infection, there was, as it is easie to
suppose, a very great fright among the People, and
consequently a general stop of Trade; except in
Provisions and Necessaries of Life, and even in
those Things, as there was a vast Number of People
fled, and a very great Number always sick, besides
the Number which died, so there could not be
above two Thirds, if above one Half of the Con∣sumption
of Provisions in the City as used to be.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="258"/>
It pleas'd God, to send a very plentiful Year of
Corn and Fruit, but not of Hay or Grass; by
which means, Bread was cheap, by Reason of the
Plenty of Corn: Flesh was cheap, by Reason of
the Scarcity of Grass; but Butter and Cheese were
dear for the same Reason, and Hay in the Market
just beyond <HI>White-Chapel</HI> Bars, was sold at 4l. <HI>per</HI>
Load. But that affected not the Poor; there was
a most excessive Plenty of all Sorts of Fruit, such
as Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Cherries, Grapes; and
they were the cheaper, because of the want of Peo∣ple;
but this made the Poor eat them to excess, and
this brought them into Fluxes, griping of the Guts,
Surfeits, and the like, which often precipitated them
into the Plague.</P>
<P>But to come to Matters of Trade; first, Foreign
Exportation being stopt, or at least very much in∣terrupted,
and rendred difficult; a general Stop
of all those Manufactories followed of Course, which
were usually bought for Exportation; and tho' some∣times
Merchants Abroad were importunate for
Goods, yet little was sent, the Passages being so
generally stop'd, that the <HI>English</HI> Ships would not
be admitted, as is said already, into their Port.</P>
<P>This put a stop to the Manufactures, that were
for Exportation in most Parts of <HI>England,</HI> except in
some out Ports; and even that was soon stop'd,
for they all had the Plague in their Turn: But tho'
this was felt all over <HI>England,</HI> yet what was still
worse, all Intercourse of Trade for Home Consump∣tion
of Manufactures, especially those which usu∣ally
circulated thro' the <HI>Londoners</HI> Hands, was stop'd
at once, the Trade of the City being stop'd.</P>
<P>All Kinds of Handicrafts in the City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Trades∣men
and Mechanicks, were, as I have said be∣fore,
out of Employ, and this occasion'd the putting
off, and dismissing an innumerable Number of Jour∣ney-men,
and Work-men of all Sorts, seeing no∣thing
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
was done relating to such Trades, but what
might be said to be absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>This caused the Multitude of single People in
<HI>London</HI> to be unprovided for; as also of Families,
whose living depended upon the Labour of the
Heads of those Families; I say, this reduced them
to extream Misery; and I must confess it is for the
Honour of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and will be for
many Ages, as long as this is to be spoken of, that
they were able to supply with charitable Provision,
the Wants of so many Thousands of those as after∣wards
fell sick, and were distressed; so that it may
be safely aver'd that no Body perished for Want,
at lest that the Magistrates had any notice given
them of.</P>
<P>This Stagnation of our Manufacturing Trade in
the Country, would have put the People there to
much greater Difficulties, but that the Master-Workmen,
Clothiers and others, to the uttermost of
their Stocks and Strength, kept on making their
Goods to keep the Poor at Work, believing that
as soon as the Sickness should abate, they would have
a quick Demand in Proportion to the Decay of
their Trade at that Time: But as none but those
Masters that were rich could do thus, and that
many were poor and not able, the Manufacturing
Trade in <HI>England</HI> suffer'd greatly, and the Poor
were pinch'd all over <HI>England</HI> by the Calamity of
the City of <HI>London</HI> only.</P>
<P>It is true, that the next Year made them full
amends by another terrible Calamity upon the City;
so that the City by one Calamity impoverished and
weaken'd the Country, and by another Calamity
even terrible too of its Kind, enrich'd the Country
and made them again amends: For an infinite Quan∣tity
of Houshold Stuff, wearing Apparel, and other
Things, besides whole Ware-houses fill'd with
Merchandize and Manufacturies, such as come from
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
all Parts of <HI>England,</HI> were consum'd in the Fire of
<HI>London,</HI> the next Year after this terrible Visitation:
It is incredible what a Trade this made all over the
whole Kingdom, to make good the Want, and to
supply that Loss: So that, in short, all the manufactur∣ing
Hands in the Nation were set on Work, and
were little enough, for several Years, to supply the
Market and answer the Demands; all Foreign Mar∣kets,
also were empty of our Goods, by the stop
which had been occasioned by the Plague, and be∣fore
an open Trade was allow'd again; and the
prodigious Demand at Home falling in join'd to
make a quick Vent for all Sorts of Goods; so that
there never was known such a Trade all over <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
for the Time, as was in the first seven Years
after the Plague, and after the Fire of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now, that I should say something of
the merciful Part of this terrible Judgment: The
last Week in <HI>September,</HI> the Plague being come to
its Crisis, its Fury began to asswage. I remember
my Friend Doctor <HI>Heath</HI> coming to see me the
Week before, told me, he was sure that the Vio∣lence
of it would asswage in a few Days; but when
I saw the weekly Bill of that Week, which was
the highest of the whole Year, being 8297 of all
Diseases, I upbraided him with it, and ask'd him,
what he had made his Judgment from? His Answer,
however, was not so much to seek, as I thought it
would have been; look you, <HI>says he,</HI> by the Number
which are at this Time sick and infected, there should
have been twenty Thousand dead the last Week, in∣stead
of eight Thousand, if the inveterate mortal Con∣tagion
had been, as it was two Weeks ago; for then
it ordinarily kill'd in two or three Days, now
not under Eight or Ten; and then not above One
in Five recovered; whereas I have observ'd, that
now not above Two in Five miscarry; and observe
it from me, the next Bill will decrease, and you
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
will see many more People recover than used to do;
for tho' a vast Multitude are now every where in∣fected,
and as many every Day fall sick; yet there
will not so many die as there did, for the Maligni∣ty
of the Distemper is abated; adding, that he be∣gan
now to hope, nay more than hope, that the
Infection had pass'd its Crisis, and was going off; and
accordingly so it was, for the next Week being, as
I said, the last in <HI>September,</HI> the Bill decreased al∣most
two Thousand.</P>
<P>It is true, the Plague was still at a frightful
Height, and the next Bill was no less than 6460, and
the next to that 5720; but still my Friend's Obser∣vation
was just, and it did appear the People did re∣cover
faster, and more in Number, than they used
to do; and indeed if it had not been so, what had been
the Condition of the City of <HI>London?</HI> for accord∣ing
to my Friend there were not fewer than sixty
Thousand People at that Time infected, whereof, as
above, 20477 died, and near 40000 recovered; where∣as
had it been as it was before, Fifty thousand of
that Number would very probably have died, if
not more, and 50000 more would have sickned; for
in a Word, the whole Mass of People began to
sicken, and it look'd as if none would escape.</P>
<P>But this Remark of my Friend's appear'd more
evident in a few Weeks more; for the Decrease
went on, and another Week in <HI>October</HI> it decreas'd
1849. So that the Number dead of the Plague
was but 2665, and the next Week it decreased
1413 more, and yet it was seen plainly, that there
was abundance of People sick, nay abundance more
than ordinary, and abundance fell sick every Day,
but (as above) the Malignity of the Disease abated.</P>
<P>Such is the precipitant Disposition of our Peo∣ple,
whether it is so or not all over the World,
that's none of my particular Business to enquire;
but I saw it apparently here, that as upon the first
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
Fright of the Infection, they shun'd one another,
and fled from one another's Houses, and from the
City with an unaccountable, and, as I thought, un∣necessary
Fright; so now upon this Notion spread∣ing,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Distemper was not so catch∣ing
as formerly, and that if it was catch'd, it was not
so mortal, and seeing abundance of People
who really fell sick, recover again daily; they
took to such a precipitant Courage, and grew so
entirely regardless of themselves, and of the Infec∣tion,
that they made no more of the Plague than
of an ordinary Fever, not indeed so much; they not
only went boldly into Company, with those who
had Tumours and Carbuncles upon them, that were
running, and consequently contagious, but eat and
drank with them, nay into their Houses to visit
them, and even, as I was told, into their very Cham∣bers
where they lay sick.</P>
<P>This I cou'd not see rational; my Friend Doc∣tor
<HI>Heath</HI> allow'd, and it was plain to Experi∣ence,
that the Distemper was as catching as ever,
and as many fell sick, but only he alledg'd, that so
many of those that fell sick did not die; but I think
that while many did die, and that, at best, the Di∣stemper
it self was very terrible, the Sores and
Swellings very tormenting, and the Danger of
Death not left out of the Circumstance of Sickness,
tho' not so frequent as before; all those things, toge∣ther
with the exceeding Tediousness of the Cure, the
Loathsomness of the Disease, and many other Articles,
were enough to deter any Man living from a dan∣gerous
Mixture with the sick People, and make them
as anxious almost to avoid the Infection as before.</P>
<P>Nay there was another Thing which made the
meer catching of the Distemper frightful, and that
was the terrible burning of the Causticks, which
the Surgeons laid on the Swellings to bring them
to break, and to run; without which the Danger
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
of Death was very great, even to the last; also the
unsufferable Torment of the Swellings, which tho'
it might not make People raving and distracted, as
they were before, and as I have given several In∣stances
of already, yet they put the Patient to in∣expressible
Torture; and those that fell into it, tho'
they did escape with Life, yet they made bitter Com∣plaints
of those, that had told them there was no Dan∣ger,
and sadly repented their Rashness and Folly in ven∣turing
to run into the reach of it.</P>
<P>Nor did this unwary Conduct of the People
end here, for a great many that thus cast of their
Cautions suffered more deeply still; and tho' many
escap'd, yet many died; and at least it had this pub∣lick
Mischief attending it, that it made the De∣crease
of Burials slower than it would otherwise
have been; for as this Notion run like Lightning
thro' the City, and People Heads were possess'd
with it, even as soon as the first great Decrease in
the Bills appear'd, we found, that the two next
Bills did not decrease in Proportion; the Reason I
take to be the Peoples running so rashly into Dan∣ger,
giving up all their former Cautions, and Care,
and all the Shyness which they used to practise; de∣pending
that the Sickness would not reach them,
or that if it did, they should not die.</P>
<P>The Physicians oppos'd this thoughtless Hu∣mour
of the People with all their Might, and gave
out printed Directions, spreading them all over the
City and Suburbs, advising the People to continue
reserv'd, and to use still the utmost Caution in their or∣dinary
Conduct, notwithstanding the Decrease of the
Distemper, terrifying them with the Danger of bring
ing a Relapse upon the whole City, and telling them
how such a Relapse might be more fatal and dan∣gerous
than the whole Visitation that had been
already; with many Arguments and Reasons to ex∣plain
and prove that part to them, and which are
too long to repeat here.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="264"/>
But it was all to no Purpose, the audacious Crea∣tures
were so possess'd with the first Joy, and so
surpriz'd with the Satisfaction of seeing a vast De∣crease
in the weekly Bills, that they were impene∣trable
by any new Terrors, and would not be per∣suaded,
but that the Bitterness of Death was pass'd;
and it was to no more purpose to talk to them,
than to an East-wind; but they open'd Shops, went
about Streets, did Business, and conversed with any
Body that came in their Way to converse with,
whether with Business, or without, neither inqui∣ring
of their Health, or so much as being Apprehen∣sive
of any Danger from them, tho' they knew
them not to be sound.</P>
<P>This imprudent rash Conduct cost a great many
their Lives, who had with great Care and Caution
shut themselves up, and kept retir'd as it were from
all Mankind, and had by that means, under God's
Providence, been preserv'd thro' all the heat of that
Infection.</P>
<P>This rash and foolish Conduct, <HI>I say,</HI> of the People
went so far, that the Ministers took notice to them
of it at last, and laid before them both the Folly
and Danger of it; and this check'd it a little, so
that they grew more cautious, but it had another
Effect, which they cou'd not check; for as the first
Rumour had spread not over the City only, but in∣to
the Country, it had the like Effect, and the Peo∣ple
were so tir'd with being so long from <HI>London,</HI>
and so eager to come back, that they flock'd to
Town without Fear or Forecast, and began to shew
themselves in the Streets, as if all the Danger was
over: It was indeed surprising to see it, for tho' there
died still from a Thousand to eighteen Hundred a
Week, yet the People flock'd to Town, as if all
had been well.</P>
<P>The Consequence of this was, that the Bills en∣creas'd
again Four Hundred the very first Week in
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
<HI>November;</HI> and if I might believe the Physicians,
there was above three Thousand fell sick that
Week, most of them new Comers too.</P>
<P><HI>One JOHN COCK,</HI> a Barber in St. <HI>Martins le
Grand,</HI> was an eminent Example of this; I mean
of the hasty Return of the People, when the
Plague was abated: This <HI>John Cock</HI> had left the
Town with his whole Family, and lock'd up his
House, and was gone in the Country, as many
others did, and finding the Plague so decreas'd in
<HI>November,</HI> that there died but 905 <HI>per</HI> Week of
all Diseases, he ventur'd home again; he had in his
Family Ten Persons, that is to say, himself and
Wife, five Children, two Apprentices, and a Maid
Servant; he had not been return'd to his House
above a Week, and began to open his Shop, and
carry on his Trade, but the Distemper broke out
in his Family, and within about five Days they all
died, except one, that is to say, himself, his Wife,
all his five Children, and his two Apprentices, and
only the Maid remain'd alive.</P>
<P>But the Mercy of God was greater to the rest than
had Reason to expect; for the Malignity, as I have
said, of the Distemper was spent, the Contagion
was exhausted, and also the Winter Weather came
on apace, and the Air was clear and cold, with
some sharp Frosts; and this encreasing still, most of
those that had fallen sick recover'd, and the Health
of the City began to return: There were indeed some
Returns of the Distemper, even in the Month of
<HI>December,</HI> and the Bills encreased near a Hundred,
but it went off again and so in a short while,
Things began to return to their own Channel. And
wonderful it was to see how populous the City was
again all on a sudden; so that a Stranger could not
miss the Numbers that were lost, neither was there any
miss of the Inhabitants as to their Dwellings: Few
or no empty Houses were to be seen, or if there
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
were some, there was no want of Tenants for
them.</P>
<P>I wish I cou'd say, that as the City had a new
Face, so the Manners of the People had a new Ap∣pearance:
I doubt not but there were many that
retain'd a sincere Sense of their Deliverance, and
that were heartily thankful to that sovereign Hand,
that had protected them in so dangerous a Time; it
would be very uncharitablee to judge otherwise in
a City so populous, and where the People were so
devout, as they were here in the Time of the Visi∣tation
it self; but except what of this was to be
found in particular Families, and Faces, it must be
acknowledg'd that the general Practice of the Peo∣ple
was just as it was before, and very little Difference
was to be seen.</P>
<P>Some indeed said Things were worse, that the
Morals of the People declin'd from this vere time;
that the People harden'd by the Danger they had
been in, like Sea-men after a Storm is over, were
more wicked and more stupid, more bold and
hardened in their Vices and Immoralities than they
were before; but I will not carry it so far neither:
It would take up a History of no small Length,
to give a Particular of all the Gradations, by which
the Course of Things in this City came to be re∣stor'd
again, and to run in their own Channel as
they did before.</P>
<P>Some Parts of <HI>England</HI> were now infected as violent∣ly
as <HI>London</HI> had been; the Cities of <HI>Norwich, Peter∣borough,
Lincoln, Colchester,</HI> and other Places were
now visited; and the Magistrates of <HI>London</HI> began to set
Rules for our Conduct, as to corresponding with
those Cities: It is true, we could not pretend to
forbid their People coming to <HI>Loudon,</HI> because it
was impossible to know them assunder, so after many
Consultations, the Lord Mayor, and Court of Al∣dermen
were oblig'd to drop it: All they cou'd do,
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
was to warn and caution the People, not to enter∣tain
in their Houses, or converse with any People
who they knew came from such infected Places.</P>
<P>But they might as well have talk'd to the Air,
for the People of <HI>London</HI> thought themselves so
Plague-free now, that they were past all Admoniti∣ons;
they seem'd to depend upon it, that the Air
was restor'd, and that the Air was like a Man that
had had the Small Pox, not capable of being infected
again; this reviv'd that Notion, that the Infection
was all in the Air, that there was no such thing as
Contagion from the sick People to the Sound; and
so strongly did this Whimsy prevail among Peo∣ple,
that they run all together promiscuously, sick
and well; not the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who, prepossess'd
with the Principle of Predestination value nothing
of Contagion, let it be in what it will, could be
more obstinate than the People of <HI>London;</HI> they
that were perfectly sound, and came out of the
wholesome Air, as we call it, into the City, made
nothing of going into the same Houses and Cham∣bers
nay even into the same Beds, with those that
had the Distemper upon them, and were not reco∣vered.</P>
<P>Some indeed paid for their audacious Boldness
with the Price of their Lives; an infinite Num∣ber
fell sick, and the Physicians had more Work
than ever, only with this Difference, that more of
their Patients recovered; that is to say, they gene∣rally
recovered, but certainly there were more Peo∣ple
infected, and fell sick now, when there did not
die above a Thousand, or Twelve Hundred in a
Week, than there was when there died Five or
Six Thousand a Week; so entirely negligent were
the People at that Time, in the great and dangerous
Case of Health and Infection; and so ill were
they able to take or accept of the Advice of
those who cautioned them for their Good.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="268"/>
The People being thus return'd, as it were in ge∣neral,
it was very strange to find, that in their in∣quiring
after their Friends, some whole Families
were so entirely swept away, that there was no Re∣membrance
of them left; neither was any Body to
be found to possess or shew any Title to that little
they had left; for in such Cases, what was to be
found was generally embezzled, and purloyn'd some
gone one way, some another.</P>
<P>It was said such abandon'd Effects, came to the King
as the universal Heir, upon which we were told, and I
suppose it was in part true, that the King granted all
such as Deodands to the Lord Mayor and Court of
Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> to be applied to the use of the
Poor, of whom there were very many: For it is to
be observ'd, that tho' the Occasions of Relief, and
the Objects of Distress were very many more in the
Time of the Violence of the Plague, than now
after all was over; yet the Distress of the Poor was
more now, a great deal than it was then, because
all the Sluces of general Charity were now shut;
People suppos'd the main Occasion to be over, and
so stop'd their Hands; whereas particular Objects
were still very moving, and the Distress of those
that were Poor, was very great indeed.</P>
<P>Tho' the Health of the City was now very much
restor'd, yet Foreign Trade did not begin to stir,
neither would Foreigners admit our Ships into their
Ports for a great while; as for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the Mis∣understandings
between our Court and them had bro∣ken
out into a War the Year before; so that our
Trade that way was wholly interrupted; but <HI>Spain</HI>
and <HI>Portugal, Italy</HI> and <HI>Barbary,</HI> as also <HI>Hamburgh,</HI>
and all the Ports in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> these were all shy
of us a great while, and would not restore Trade with
us for many Months.</P>
<P>The Distemper sweeping away such Multitudes,
as I have observ'd, many, if not all the out Parishes
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
were oblig'd to make new burying Grounds, be∣sides
that I have mention'd in <HI>Bunhil-Fields,</HI> some
of which were continued, and remain in Use to
this Day; but others were left off, and which, I
confess, I mention with some Reflection, being
converted into other Uses, or built upon afterwards,
the dead Bodies were disturb'd, abus'd, dug up
again, some even before the Flesh of them was pe∣rished
from the Bones, and remov'd like Dung or
Rubbish to other Places; some of those which came
within the Reach of my Observation, are as fol∣low.</P>
<P>1.
A piece of Ground beyond <HI>Goswel</HI> Street,
near <HI>Mount-Mill,</HI> being some of the Remains of
the old Lines or Fortifications of the City, where
Abundance were buried promiscuously from the Pa∣rishes
of <HI>Aldersgate, Clerkenwell,</HI> and even out of
the City. This Ground, as I take it, was since
made a Physick Garden, and after that has been
built upon.</P>
<P>2. A piece of Ground just over the <HI>Black Ditch,</HI>
as it was then call'd, at the end of <HI>Holloway Lane,</HI>
in <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Parish; it has been since made a Yard
for keeping Hogs, and for other ordinary Uses, but
is quite out of Use as a burying Ground.</P>
<P>3. The upper End of <HI>Hand-Alley</HI> in <HI>Bishopsgate</HI>
Street, which was then a green Field, and was ta∣ken
in particularly for <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> Parish, tho' many
of the Carts out of the City brought their dead
thither also, particularly out of the Parish of St. <HI>All∣hallows</HI>
on the <HI>Wall;</HI> this Place I cannot mention
without much Regret, it was, as I remember, about
two or three Year after the Plague was ceas'd that
Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> came to be possest of the Ground;
it was reported, how true I know not, that it fell
to the King for want of Heirs, all those who had
any Right to it being carried off by the Pestilence,
and that Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> obtain'd a Grant of it
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
from King <HI>Charles</HI> II. But however he came by
it, certain it is, the Ground was let out to build
on, or built upon by his Order: The first House
built upon it was a large fair House still standing,
which faces the Street, or Way, now call'd <HI>Hand-Alley,</HI>
which, tho' call'd an <HI>Alley,</HI> is as wide as a
Street: The Houses in the same Row with that
House Northward, are built on the very same
Ground where the poor People were buried, and
the Bodies on opening the Ground for the Foun∣dations,
were dug up, some of them remaining so
plain to be seen, that the Womens Sculls were di∣stinguish'd
by their long Hair, and of others, the
Flesh was not quite perished; so that the People be∣gan
to exclaim loudly against it, and some suggested
that it might endanger a Return of the Contagi∣on:
After which the Bones and Bodies, as fast as
they came at them, were carried to another part of
the same Ground, and thrown all together into a
deep Pit, dug on purpose, which now is to be
known, in that it is not built on, but is a Passage
to another House, at the upper end of <HI>Rose Alley,</HI>
just against the Door of a Meeting-house, which has
been built there many Years since; and the Ground
is palisadoed off from the rest of the Passage, in a
little square, there lye the Bones and Remains of
near Two thousand Bodies, carried by the Dead-Carts
to to their Grave in that one Year.</P>
<P>4. Besides this, there was a piece of Ground in
<HI>Moorfields,</HI> by the going into the Street which is
now call'd <HI>Old Bethlem,</HI> which was enlarg'd much,
tho' not wholly taken in on the same occasion.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Author of this Journal, lyes buried
in that very Ground, being at his own Desire, his
Sister having been buried there a few Years be∣fore.</P>
<P>5.
<HI>Stepney</HI> Parish, extending it self from the East
part of <HI>London</HI> to the <HI>North,</HI> even to the very
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
Edge of <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Church-yard, had a piece of
Ground taken in to bury their Dead, close to the
said Church-yard, and which for that very Reason was
left open, and is since, I suppose, taken into the same
Church-yard; and they had also two other burying
Places in <HI>Spittlefields,</HI> one where since a Chapel or
Tabernacle has been built for ease to this great
Parish, and another in <HI>Petticoat-lane.</HI></P>
<P>There were no less than Five other Grounds
made use of for the Parish of <HI>Stepney</HI> at that time;
one where now stands the Parish Church of St.
<HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Shadwel,</HI> and the other, where now stands
the Parish Church of St. <HI>John</HI> at <HI>Wapping,</HI> both
which had not the Names of Parishes at that time,
but were belonging to <HI>Stepney</HI> Parish.</P>
<P>I cou'd name many more, but these coming
within my particular Knowledge, the Circumstance
I thought made it of Use to record them; from
the whole, it may be observ'd, that they were ob∣lig'd
in this Time of Distress, to take in new bury∣ing
Grounds in most of the out Parishes, for lay∣ing
the prodigious Numbers of People which died
in so short a Space of Time; but why Care was not
taken to keep those Places separate from ordinary
Uses, that so the Bodies might rest undisturb'd,
that I cannot answer for, and must confess, I think it
was wrong; who were to blame, I know not.</P>
<P>I should have mention'd, that the Quakers had
at that time also a burying Ground, set a-part to
their Use, and which they still make use of, and
they had also a particular <HI>dead Cart</HI> to fetch their
Dead from their Houses; and the famous <HI>Solomon
Eagle,</HI> who, as I mentioned before, had predicted the
Plague as a Judgment, and run naked thro' the
Streets, telling the People, that it was come upon
them, to punish them for their Sins, had his own
Wife died the very next Day of the Plague,
<PB N="290" REF="272"/>
and was carried one of the first in the Quakers
<HI>dead Cart,</HI> to their new burying Ground.</P>
<P>I might have throng'd this Account with many
more remarkable Things, which occur'd in the Time
of the Infection, and particularly what pass'd be∣tween
the Lord Mayor and the Court, which was
then at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and what Directions were from
time to time receiv'd from the Government for
their Conduct on this critical Occasion. But really
the Court concern'd themselves so little, and that
little they did was of so small Import, that I do
not see it of much Moment to mention any Part
of it here, except that of appointing a Monthly
Fast in the City, and the sending the Royal Chari∣ty
to the Relief of the Poor, both which I have
mention'd before.</P>
<P>Great was the Reproach thrown on those Physi∣cians
who left their Patients during the Sickness,
and now they came to Town again, no Body car'd
to employ them; they were call'd Deserters, and
frequently Bills were set up upon their Doors, and
written, <HI>Here is a Doctor to be let!</HI> So that several
of those Physicians were fain for a while to sit still
and look about them, or at least remove their Dwel∣lings,
and set up in new Places, and among new
Acquaintance; the like was the Case with the Clergy,
who the People were indeed very abusive to, writ∣ing
Verses and scandalous Reflections upon them,
setting upon the Church Door, <HI>here is a Pulpit to
be let,</HI> or sometimes <HI>to be sold,</HI> which was worse.</P>
<P>It was not the least of our Misfortunes, that with
our Infection, when it ceased, there did not cease the
Spirit of Strife and Contention, Slander and Reproach,
which was really the great Troubler of the Nation's
Peace before: It was said to be the Remains of the
old Animosities, which had so lately involv'd us all
in Blood and Disorder. But as the late Act of In∣demnity
had laid asleep the Quarrel it self, so the
<PB N="291" REF="273"/>
Government had recommended Family and Perso∣nal
Peace upon all Occasions, to the whole Na∣tion.</P>
<P>But it cou'd not be obtain'd, and particularly after
the ceasing of the Plague in <HI>London,</HI> when any one
that had seen the Condition which the People had
been in, and how they caress'd one another at that
time, promis'd to have more Charity for the future,
and to raise no more Reproaches: I say, any one
that had seen them then, would have thought they
would have come together with another Spirit at
last. But, I say, it cou'd not be obtain'd; the Qua∣rel
remain'd, the Church and the Presbyterians
were incompatible; as soon as the Plague was re∣mov'd,
the dissenting outed Ministers who had
supplied the Pulpits, which were deserted by the
Incumbents, retir'd, they cou'd expect no other;
but that they should immediately fall upom them,
and harrass them, with their penal Laws, accept
their preaching while they were sick, and persecute
them as soon as they were recover'd again, this even
we that were of the Church thought was very
hard, and cou'd by no means approve of it.</P>
<P>But it was the Government, and we cou'd say
nothing to hinder it; we cou'd only say, it was not
our doing, and we could not answer for it.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Dissenters reproaching
those Ministers of the Church with going away,
and deserting their Charge, abandoning the People
in their Danger, and when they had most need of
Comfort and the like, this we cou'd by no means
approve; for all Men have not the same Faith, and
the same Courage, and the Scripture commands us
to judge the most favourably, and according to Cha∣rity.</P>
<P>A Plague is a formidable Enemy, and is arm'd
with Terrors, that every Man is not sufficiently
fortified to resist, or prepar'd to stand the Shock
<PB N="290" REF="274"/>

<PB N="291" REF="275"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="272" REF="276"/>
against: It is very certain, that a great many
of the Clergy, who were in Circumstances to do it,
withdrew, and fled for the Safety of their Lives;
but 'tis true also, that a great many of them staid,
and many of them fell in the Calamity, and in the
Discharge of their Duty.</P>
<P>It is true, some of the Dissenting turn'd out Mi∣nisters
staid, and their Courage is to be commend∣ed,
and highly valued, but these were not abun∣dance;
it cannot be said that they all staid, and
that none retir'd into the Country, any more than
it can be said of the Church Clergy, that they all
went away; neither did all those that went away,
go without substituting Curates, and others in their
Places, to do the Offices needful, and to visit the
Sick, as far as it was practicable; so that upon the
whole, an Allowance of Charity might have been
made on both Sides, and we should have consider'd,
that such a time as this of 1665, is not to be parallel'd
in History, and that it is not the stoutest Courage
that will always support Men in such Cases; I had
not said this, but had rather chosen to record
the Courage and religious Zeal of those of both
Sides, who did hazard themselves for the Service of
the poor People in their Distress, without remem∣bring
that any fail'd in their Duty on either side.
But the want of Temper among us, has made
the contrary to this necessary; some that staid, not
only boasting too much of themselves, but revil∣ing
those that fled, branding them with Cowardice,
deserting their Flocks, and acting the Part of the
Hirleing, and the like: I recommend it to the Cha∣rity
of all good People to look back, and reflect duly
upon the Terrors of the Time; and whoever does
so will see, that it is not an ordinary Strength that
cou'd support it, it was not like appearing in the
Head of an Army, or charging a Body or Horse
in the Field; but it was charging Death it self
<PB N="273" REF="277"/>
on his pale Horse; to stay was indeed to die, and it
could be esteemed nothing less, especially as things
appear'd at the latter End of <HI>August,</HI> and the Be∣ginning
of <HI>September,</HI> and as there was reason to
expect them at that time; for no Man expected,
and I dare say, believed, that the Distemper would
take so sudden a Turn as it did, and fall imme∣diately
2000 in a Week, when there was such a
prodigious Number of People sick at that Time,
as it was known there was; and then it was that
many shifted away, that had stay'd most of the time
before.</P>
<P>Besides, if God gave Strength to some more than
to others, was it to boast of their Ability to abide
the Stroak, and upbraid those that had not the same
Gift and Support, or ought not they rather to have
been humble and thankful, if they were render'd
more useful than their Brethren?</P>
<P>I think it ought to be recorded to the Honour of
such Men, as well Clergy as Physicians, Sur∣geons,
Apothecaries, Magiftrates and Officers of
every kind, as also all useful People, who ventur'd their
Lives in Discharge of their Duty, as most cer∣tainly
all such as stay'd did to the last Degree,
and several of all these Kinds did not only venture
but lose their Lives on that sad Occasion.</P>
<P>I was once making a List of all such, I mean of
all those Professions and Employments, who thus
died, as I call it, in the way of their Duty, but it
was impossible for a private Man to come at a
Certainty in the Particulats; I only remember, that
there died sixteen Clergy-men, two Aldermen, five
Physicians, thirteen Surgeons, within the City and
Liberties before the beginning of <HI>September:</HI> But
this being, as I said before, the great Crisis and Extre∣mity
of the Infection, it can be no compleat List: As
to inferior People, I think there died six and forty
<PB N="274" REF="278"/>
Constables and Headboroughs in the two Parishes of
<HI>Stepney</HI> and <HI>White-Chapel;</HI> but I could not carry
my List on, for when the violent Rage of the Di∣stemper
in <HI>September</HI> came upon us, it drove us out
of all Measures: Men did then no more die by Tale
and by Number, they might put out a Weekly
Bill, and call them seven or eight Thousand, or
what they pleas'd; 'tis certain they died by Heaps,
and were buried by Heaps, that is to say without Ac∣count;
and if I might believe some People, who
were more abroad and more conversant with those
things than I, tho' I was public enough for one
that had no more Business to do than I had, I say,
if I may believe them, there was not many less bu∣ried
those first three Weeks in <HI>September</HI> than 20000
<HI>per</HI> Week; however the others aver the Truth of
it, yet I rather chuse to keep to the public Account;
seven and eight thousand <HI>per</HI> Week is enough to
make good all that I have said of the Terror of those
Times; and it is much to the Satisfaction of me
that write, as well as those that read, to be able to
say, that every thing is set down with Moderation,
and rather within Compass than beyond it.</P>
<P>Upon all these Accounts I say I could wish, when
we were recover'd, our Conduct had been more
distinguish'd for Charity and Kindness in Remem∣brance
of the past Calamity, and not so much a
valuing our selves upon our Boldness in staying, as
if all Men were Cowards that fly from the Hand
of God, or that those, who stay, do not sometimes
owe their Courage to their Ignorance, and despising
the Hand of their Maker, which is a criminal kind
of Desperation, and not a true Courage.</P>
<P>I cannot but leave it upon Record, that the Civil
Officers, such as Constables, Headboroughs, Lord
Mayor's, and Sheriff' s-men, as also Parish-Officers,
whose Business it was to take Charge of the Poor,
<PB N="275" REF="279"/>
did their Duties in general with as much Courage
as any, and perhaps with more, because their Work
was attended with more Hazards, and lay more
among the Poor, who were more subject to be in∣fected
and in the most pitiful Plight when they were
taken with the Infection: But then it must be ad∣ded
too, that a great Number of them died, indeed it
was scarce possible it should be otherwise.</P>
<P>I have not said one Word here about the Physick
or Preparations that we ordinarily made use of on this
terrible Occasion, I mean we that went frequently
abroad up and down Street, as I did; much of this
was talk'd of in the Books and Bills of our Quack
Doctors, of whom I have said enough already.
It may however be added, that the College of Phy∣sicians
were daily publishing several Preparations,
which they had consider'd of in the Process of their
Practice, and which being to be had in Print, I
avoid repeating them for that reason.</P>
<P>One thing I could not help observing, what be∣fell
one of the Quacks, who publish'd that he had a
most excellent Preservative against the Plague, which
whoever kept about them, should never be in∣fected,
or liable to Infection; this Man, who we
may reasonably suppose, did not go abroad without
some of this <HI>excellent Preservative</HI> in his Pocket, yet
was taken by the Distemper, and carry'd off in two
or three Days</P>
<P>I am not of the Number of the Physic-Haters,
or Physic-Despisers; on the contrary, I have often
mentioned the regard I had to the Dictates of my
particular Friend Dr. <HI>Heath;</HI> but yet I must ac∣knowledge,
I made use of little or nothing, except
as I have observ'd, to keep a Preparation of strong
Scent to have ready, in case I met with any thing
of offensive Smells, or went too near any burying
place, or dead Body.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="280"/>
Neither did I do, what I know some did, keep
the Spirits always high and hot with Cordials, and
Wine, and such things, and which, as I observ'd, one
learned Physician used himself so much to, as that
he could not leave them off when the Infection was
quite gone, and so became a Sot for all his Life
after.</P>
<P>I remember, my Friend the Doctor us'd to say,
that there was a certain Set of Drugs and Preparations,
which were all certainly good and useful in the case
of an Infection; out of which, or with which, Phy∣sicians
might make an infinite Variety of Medicines,
as the Ringers of Bells make several Hundred diffe∣rent
Rounds of Musick by the changing and Or∣der
of Sound but in six Bells; and that all these Prepara∣tions
shall be really very good; therefore, said he, I do
not wonder that so vast a Throng of Medicines is of∣ffer'd
in the present Calamity; and almost every Physi∣cian
prescribes or prepares a different thing, as his
Judgment or Experience guides him: but, says
my Friend, let all the Prescriptions of all the Phy∣sicians
in <HI>London</HI> be examined; and it will be found,
that they are all compounded of the same things,
with such Variations only, as the particular Fancy
of the Doctor leads him to; so that, says he, every
Man judging a little of his own Constitution and
manner of his living, and Circumstances of
his being infected, may direct his own Medicines
out of the ordinary Drugs and Preparations:
Only that, says he, some recommend one thing as
most sovereign, and some another; some, says he,
think that <HI>Pill. Ruff.</HI> which is call'd itself the Anti∣pestilential
Pill, is the best Preparation that can be
made; others think, that <HI>Venice</HI> Treacle is sufficient
of it self to resist the Contagion, and I, says he,
think as both these think, <HI>viz.</HI> that the last is good
to take beforehand to prevent it, and the last, if
touch'd, to expel it. According to this Opinion. I
<PB N="277" REF="281"/>
several times took <HI>Venice Treacle</HI> and a sound Sweat
upon it, and thought my self as well fortified against
the Infection as any one could be fortifyed by the
Power of Physic.</P>
<P>As for Quackery and Mountebank, of which the
Town was so full, I listened to none of them, and
have observ'd often since with some Wonder, that
for two Years after the Plague, I scarcely saw or
heard of one of them about Town. Some fancied
they were all swept away in the Infection to a Man,
and were for calling it a particular Mark of God's
Vengeance upon them, for leading the poor People
into the Pit of Destruction, merely for the Lucre of
a little Money they got by them; but I cannot go
that Length neither; that Abundance of them died
is certain, many of them came within the Reach
of my own Knowledge; but that all of them were
swept off I much question; I believe rather, they
fled into the Country, and tryed their Practices
upon the People there, who were in Apprehension
of the Infection, before it came among them.</P>
<P>This however is certain, not a Man of them ap∣pear'd
for a great while in or about <HI>London;</HI> there
were indeed several Doctors, who published Bills, re∣commending
their several physical Preparations for
cleansing the Body, as they call it, after the Plague,
and needful, as they said, for such People to take,
who had been visited and had been cur'd; whereas
I must own, I believe that it was the Opinion of
the most eminent Physicians at that time, that the
Plague was itself a sufficient Purge; and that
those who escaped the Infection needed no Physic
to cleanse their Bodies of any other things; the
running Sores, the Tumors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were broke
and kept open by the Directions of the Physicians,
having sufficiently cleansed them; and that all
other Distempers and Causes of Distempers were
effectually carried off that Way; and as the Phy∣sicians
<PB N="278" REF="282"/>
gave this as their Opinions, wherever they
came, the Quacks got little Business.</P>
<P>There were indeed several little Hurries, which
happen'd after the Decrease of the Plague, and
which whether they were contriv'd to fright and
disorder the People, as some imagin'd, I cannot
say, but sometimes we were told the Plague would
return by such a Time; and the famous <HI>Solomon
Eagle</HI> the naked Quaker, I have mention'd, pro∣phesy'd
evil Tidings every Day; and several others
telling us that <HI>London</HI> had not been sufficiently
scourg'd, and the sorer and severer Strokes were yet
behind; had they stop'd there, or had they descen∣ded
to Particulars, and told us that the City should
the next Year be destroyed by Fire; then indeed,
when we had seen it come to pass, we should not
have been to blame to have paid more than a com∣mon
Respect to their Prophetick Spirits, at least
we should have wonder'd at them, and have been
more serious in our Enquiries after the meaning
of it, and whence they had the Fore-knowledge:
But as they generally told us of a Relapse into the
Plague, we have had no Concern since that about
them; yet by these frequent Clamours, we were
all kept with some kind of Apprehensions con∣stantly
upon us, and if any died suddenly, or if the
spotted Fevers at any time increased, we were pre∣sently
alarm'd; much more if the Number of the
Plague encreased, for to the End of the Year, there
were always between 2 and 300 of the Plague; on
any of these Occasions, I say, we were alarm'd
anew.</P>
<P>Those, who remember the City of <HI>London</HI> before
the Fire, must remember, that there was then no
such Place as that we now call <HI>Newgate</HI>-Market.
But that in the Middle of the Street, which is now
call'd <HI>Blow-bladder Street,</HI> and which had its Name
from the Butchers, who us'd to kill and dress their
<PB N="279" REF="283"/>
Sheep there; (and who it seems had a Custom to
blow up their Meat with Pipes to make it look
thicker and fatter than it was, and were punish'd
there for it by the Lord Mayor) I say, from the
End of the Street towards <HI>Newgate,</HI> there stood two
long Rows of Shambles for the selling Meat.</P>
<P>It was in those Shambles, that two Persons fal∣ling
down dead, as they were buying Meat, gave
Rise to a Rumor that the Meat was all infected,
which tho' it might affright the People, and spoil'd
the Market for two or three Days; yet it appear'd
plainly afterwards, that there was nothing of Truth
in the Suggestion: But no Body can account for
the Possession of Fear when it takes hold of the
Mind.</P>
<P>However it pleas'd God by the continuing of the
Winter Weather to restore the Health of the Ci∣ty,
that by <HI>February</HI> following, we reckon'd the
Distemper quite ceas'd, and then we were not so
easily frighted again.</P>
<P>There was still a Question among the Learned, and
at first it perplex'd the People a little, and that was,
in what manner to purge the Houses and Goods,
where the Plague had been; and how to render
them habitable again, which had been left empty
during the time of the Plague; Abundance of Per∣fumes
and Preparations were prescrib'd by Physi∣cians,
some of one kind and some of another, in
which the People, who listened to them, put them∣selves
to a great, and indeed in my Opinion, to an
unnecessary Expence; and the poorer People, who
only set open their Windows Night and Day, burnt
Brimstone, Pitch, and Gun-powder and such things
in their Rooms, did as well as the best; nay, the
eager People, who as I said above, came Home in
hast and at all Hazards, found little or no Incon∣venience
in their Houses nor in the Goods, and did
little or nothing to them.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="284"/>
However, in general, prudent cautious People
did enter into some Measures for airing and sweet∣ning
their Houses, and burnt Perfumes, Incense, Ben∣jamin,
Rozin, and Sulphur in the Rooms close shut
up, and then let the Air carry it all out with a
Blast of Gun-powder; others caused large Fires to
be made all Day and all Night, for several Days and
Nights; by the same Token, that two or three
were pleas'd to set their Houses on Fire, and so ef∣fectually
sweetned them by burning them down to
the Ground; as particularly one at <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> one in
<HI>Holbourn,</HI> and one at <HI>Westminster;</HI> besides two or
three that were set on Fire, but the Fire was happily
got out again, before it went far enough to burn
down the Houses; and one Citizen's Servant, I think
it was in <HI>Thames</HI> Street, carryed so much Gun∣powder
into his Master's House for clearing it of
the Infection, and managed it so foolishly, that he
blew up part of the Roof of the House. But the
Time was not fully come, that the City was to
be purg'd by Fire, nor was it far off; for within
Nine Months more I saw it all lying in Ashes;
when, as some of our Quacking Philosophers pre∣tend,
the Seeds of the Plague were entirely destroy'd
and not before; a Notion too ridiculous to speak of
here, since, had the Seeds of the Plague remain'd
in the Houses, not to be destroyed but by Fire,
how has it been, that they have not since broken
out? Seeing all those Buildings in the Suburbs and
Liberties, and in the great Parishes of <HI>Stepney, White-Chapel,
Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Cripple∣gate</HI>
and St. <HI>Giles's,</HI> where the Fire never came, and
where the Plague rag'd with the greatest Violence,
remain still in the same Condition they were in be∣fore.</P>
<P>But to leave these things just as I found them, it
was certain, that those People, who were more than
<PB N="281" REF="285"/>
ordinarily cautious of their Health, did take parti∣cular
Directions for what they called Seasoning of
their Houses, and Abundance of costly Things were
consum'd on that Account, which, I cannot but say,
not only seasoned those Houses, as they desir'd, but
fill'd the Air with very grateful and wholesome
Smells, which others had the Share of the Benefit
of, as well as those who were at the Expences of
them.</P>
<P>And yet after all, tho' the Poor came to Town
very precipitantly, as I have said, yet I must lay,
the rich made no such Haste; the Men of Business
indeed came up, but many of them did not bring
their Families to Town, till the Spring came on,
and that they saw Reason to depend upon it, that
the Plague would not return.</P>
<P>The Court indeed came up soon after Christmas,
but the Nobility and Gentry, except such as de∣pended
upon, and had Employment under the Ad∣ministration,
did not come so soon.</P>
<P>I should have taken Notice here, that notwith∣standing
the Violence of the Plague in <HI>London</HI> and
in other Places, yet it was very observable, that it
was never on Board the Fleet; and yet for some
time there was a strange Press in the River, and
even in the Streets for Sea-Men to man the Fleet.
But it was in the Beginning of the Year, when the
Plague was scarce begun, and not at all come down
to that part of the City, where they usually press
for Seamen; and tho' a War with the <HI>Dutch</HI> was
not at all grateful to the People at that time, and the
Seamen went with a kind of Reluctancy into the
Service, and many complain'd of being drag'd into
it by Force, yet it prov'd in the Event a happy
Violence to several of them, who had probably
perish'd in the general Calamity, and who after the
Summer Service was over, tho' they had Cause to
<PB N="282" REF="286"/>
lament the Desolation of their Families, who, when
they came back, were many of them in their
Graves; yet they had room to be thankful, that
they were carried out of the Reach of it, tho' so
much against their Wills; we indeed had a hot
War with the <HI>Dutch</HI> that Year, and one very great
Engagement at Sea, in which the <HI>Dutch</HI> were
worsted; but we lost a great many Men and some
Ships. But, as I observ'd, the Plague was not in
the Fleet, and when they came to lay up the Ships
in the River, the violent part of it began to abate.</P>
<P>I would be glad, if I could close the Account of
this melancholy Year with some particular Exam∣ples
historically; I mean of the Thankfulness to
God our Preserver for our being delivered from this
dreadful Calamity; certainly the Circumstances of
the Deliverance, as well as the terrible Enemy we
were delivered from, call'd upon the whole Nation
for it; the Circumstances of the Deliverance were
indeed very remarkable, as I have in part mention'd
already, and particularly the dreadful Condition, which
we were all in, when we were, to the Surprize of
the whole Town, made joyful with the Hope of a
Stop of the Infection.</P>
<P>Nothing, but the immediate Finger of God, no∣thing,
but omnipotent Power could have done it;
the Contagion despised all Medicine, Death rag'd
in every Corner; and had it gone on as it did
then, a few Weeks more would have clear'd the
Town of all, and every thing that had a Soul: Men
every where began to despair, every Heart fail'd
them for Fear, People were made desperate thro' the
Anguish of their Souls, and the Terrors of Death
sat in the very Faces and Countenances of the
People.</P>
<P>In that very Moment, when we might very well
say, Vain was the Help of Man; I say in that very
<PB N="283" REF="287"/>
Moment it pleased God, with a most agreeable Sur∣prize,
to cause the Fury of it to abate, even of it self,
and the Malignity declining, as I have said, tho' in∣finite
Numbers were sick, yet fewer died; and the
very first Week's Bill decreased 1843, a vast Num∣ber
indeed!</P>
<P>It is impossible to express the Change that ap∣pear'd
in the very Countenances of the People, that
<HI>Thursday</HI> Morning, when the Weekly Bill came out; it
might have been perceived in their Countenances, that
a secret Surprize and Smile of Joy sat on every Bodies
Face; they shook one another by the Hands in the
Streets, who would hardly go on the same Side of the
way with one another before; where the Streets were
not too broad, they would open their Windows and
call from one House to another, and ask'd how
they did, and if they had heard the good News,
that the Plague was abated; Some would return
when they said good News, and ask, <HI>what good News?</HI>
and when they answered, that the Plague was abat∣ed,
and the Bills decreased almost 2000, they would
cry out, <HI>God be praised;</HI> and would weep aloud for
Joy, telling them they had heard nothing of it; and
such was the Joy of the People that it was as it
were Life to them from the Grave. I could almost
set down as many extravagant things done in the Ex∣cess
of their Joy, as of their Grief; but that would
be to lessen the Value of it.</P>
<P>I must confess my self to have been very much dejec∣ted
just before this happen'd; for the prodigious Num∣ber
that were taken sick the Week or two before,
besides those that died, was such, and the Lamen∣tations
were so great every where, that a Man must
have seemed to have acted even against his Reason,
if he had so much as expected to escape; and as
there was hardly a House, but mine, in all my Neigh∣bourhood,
but what was infected; so had it gone on,
<PB N="284" REF="288"/>
it would not have been long, that there would
have been any more Neighbours to be infected;
indeed it is hardly credible, what dreadful Havock
the last three Weeks had made, for if I might be∣lieve
the Person, whose Calculations I always found
very well grounded, there were not less than 30000
People dead, and near 100 thousand fallen sick in
the three Weeks I speak of; for the Number that
fickened was surprising, indeed it was astonishing,
and those whose Courage upheld them all the time
before, sunk under it now.</P>
<P>In the Middle of their Distress, when the Con∣dition
of the City of <HI>London</HI> was so truly calami∣tous,
just then it pleased God, as it were, by his im∣mediate
Hand to disarm this Enemy; the Poyson
was taken out of the Sting, it was wonderful, even
the Physicians themselves were surprized at it;
wherever they visited, they found their Patients
better, either they had sweated kindly, or the Tu∣mours
were broke, or the Carbuncles went down,
and the Inflammations round them chang'd Co∣lour,
or the Fever was gone, or the violent Head∣ach
was asswag'd, or some good Symptom was in
the Case; so that in a few Days, every Body was
recovering, whole Families that were infected and
down, that had Ministers praying with them, and
expected Death every Hour, were revived and
healed, and none died at all out of them.</P>
<P>Nor was this by any new Medicine found out,
or new Method of Cure discovered, or by any Ex∣perience
in the Operation, which the Physicians
or Surgeons had attain'd to; but it was evidently
from the secret invisible Hand of him, that had at
first sent this Disease as a Judgment upon us; and
let the Atheistic part of Mankind call my Saying
this what they please, it is no Enthusiasm; it was
acknowledg'd at that time by all Mankind; the Dis∣ease
<PB N="285" REF="289"/>
was enervated, and its Malignity spent, and let it
proceed from whencesoever it will, let the Philo∣sophers
search for Reasons in Nature to account for
it by, and labour as much as they will to lessen the
Debt they owe to their Maker; those Physicians,
who had the least Share of Religion in them, were
oblig'd to acknowledge that it was all supernatural,
that it was extraordinary, and that no Account could
be given of it.</P>
<P>If I should say, that this is a visible Summons to
us all to Thankfulness, especially we that were un∣der
the Terror of its Increase, perhaps it may be
thought by some, after the Sense of the thing was
over, an officious canting of religious things, preach∣ing
a Sermon instead of writing a History, making
my self a Teacher instead of giving my Obser∣vations
of things; and this restrains me very much
from going on here, as I might otherwise do: But
if ten Leapers were healed, and but one return'd to
give Thanks, I desire to be as that one, and to be
thankful for my self.</P>
<P>Nor will I deny, but there were Abundance of
People who to all Appearance were very thankful at
that time; for their Mouths were stop'd, even the
Mouths of those, whose Hearts were not extraor∣dinary
long affected with it: But the Impression was
so strong at that time, that it could not be resisted,
no not by the worst of the People.</P>
<P>It was a common thing to meet People in the
Street, that were Strangers, and that we knew no∣thing
at all of, expressing their Surprize. Going
one Day thro' <HI>Aldgate,</HI> and a pretty many People
being passing and repassing, there comes a Man
out of the End of the <HI>Minories,</HI> and looking a little
up the Street and down, he throws his Hands
abroad, <HI>Lord, what an Alteration is here!</HI> Why,
last Week I came along here, and hardly any Body
<PB N="286" REF="290"/>
was to be seen; another Man, I heard him, adds
to his Words, 'tis all wonderful, 'tis all a Dream:
Blessed be God, says a third Man, aud let us give
Thanks to him, for 'tis all his own doing: Hu∣man
Help and human Skill was at an End. These
were all Strangers to one another: But such Salu∣tations
as these were frequent in the Street every
Day; and in Spight of a loose Behaviour, the very
common People went along the Streets, giving God
Thanks for their Deliverance.</P>
<P>It was now, as I said before, the People had cast off
all Apprehensions, and that too fast; indeed we were
no more afraid now to pass by a Man with a white
Cap upon his Head, or with a Cloth wrapt round
his Neck, or with his Leg limping, occasion'd by
the Sores in his Groyn, all which were frightful
to the last Degree, but the Week before; but now
the Street was full of them, and these poor reco∣vering
Creatures, give them their Due, appear'd very
sensible of their unexpected Deliverance; and I
should wrong them very much, if I should not ac∣knowledge,
that I believe many of them were really
thankful; but I must own, that for the Generality
of the People it might too justly be said of them,
as was said of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> after their be∣ing
delivered from the Host of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> when they
passed the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> and look'd back, and saw the
<HI>Egyptians</HI> overwhelmed in the Water, <HI>viz.</HI> That
<HI>they sang his Praise, but they soon forgot his
Works.</HI></P>
<P>I can go no farther here, I should be counted
censorious, and perhaps unjust, if I should enter
into the unpleasant Work of reflecting, whatever
Cause there was for it, upon the Unthankfulness
and Return of all manner of Wickedness among us,
which I was so much an Eye-Witness of my self;
<PB N="287" REF="291"/>
I shall conclude the Account of this calamitous Year
therefore with a coarse but sincere Stanza of my
own, which I plac'd at the End of my ordinary
Memorandums, the same Year they were written:</P>
<Q><L>A dreadful Plague in <HI>London</HI> was,</L>
<L>In the Year Sixty Five,</L>
<L>Which swept an Hundred Thousand Souls</L>
<L>Away; yet I alive!</L></Q>
