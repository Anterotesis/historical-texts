<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HEROISM, (sometimes called <HI>Quixotism)</HI> is at present so general all over <HI>Europe,</HI> and in some more distant Parts, that I believe no one will be sur∣priz'd if the Epidemic Disorder has reach'd the Stage; which, as it is allow'd to be often the Representation of High-Life, and more liable to traffick with the Clouds, than any other Branch of Literature, (<HI>Whitfieldism</HI> excepted) lies more open to the Contagion.</P>
<P>Under the Supposition therefore of due Allowances from the Publick, and as a Relief from the <HI>more intense Af∣fairs abroad,</HI> we have ventur'd to exhibit to the Town, the Plan of Operations between two <HI>Theatrical Gene∣rals,</HI> who, tho' of different Kingdoms, and the Scene of Action laid at some Distance from us, will not we hope be disregarded, nor their Affairs less interesting, or di∣verting, than if it were nearer.</P>
<P>The one indeed has in this Kingdom, long been known a <HI>Heroe</HI> of great <HI>Puissance</HI> and <HI>Magnanimity,</HI> not to be persuaded from his Pursuits of <HI>Glory</HI> by the Threats of private Whispers, or publick Manifestos, nor daunted at the odds of <HI>Numbers</HI> in the <HI>Field</HI> of <HI>Action</HI>.</P>
<P>The other a <HI>younger General</HI> indeed, and less ex∣perienc'd, not so fierce in the <HI>Attack,</HI> nor <HI>QUITE</HI> so formidable in the <HI>FRONT;</HI> yet notwithstanding these Disadvantages, he is said to be Master of Qualifica∣tions more commendable, <HI>viz.</HI> A Coolness at the Onset, a Warmth in the Retreat, and (what all prudent Gene∣rals should have) a Disposition rather to <HI>give Orders,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
for the Battle, than an Inclination to hazard his Per∣son in it—<HI>a great Example</HI>—</P>
<P>But they are both wrong'd in having their Charac∣ters attempted by so weak a Pen—Therefore, that we may not longer detain you, from what they say of, and to each Other, we think proper to close this Prefa∣tory Trifle, with informing you, that <HI>Dublin</HI> was the Seat of Action, the two Heroes Mr. <HI>THEOPHILUS CIBBER</HI> and Mr. <HI>THOMAS SHERIDAN;</HI> what Numbers fought under each Banner, how influenced, and how spirited, will be shewn in the following Pages.</P>
<P>The Cause of Quarrel indeed appears to have been about so small a <HI>Trifle</HI> as a <HI>Robe</HI>—a <HI>Robe</HI> for <HI>Cato</HI>—Which had the <HI>Stoick</HI> lived he very freely would have given to either of them—But why do I call it a <HI>Trifle?</HI>—Look around, and see what <HI>Wars,</HI> what <HI>Devastations</HI> have ensued from Matters of <HI>less Moment</HI>—Well; Mr. <HI>SHERIDAN</HI> being disappointed of the Robe, he first represented the <HI>great Cato</HI> in, refused to perform, whether from a Resent∣ment of his being <HI>personally</HI> ill treated, or that he, in the Character of the <HI>divine Cato,</HI> would not appear in worse Cloaths than he did the Week before, the <HI>Connis∣seurs</HI> are not yet agreed in. On his Refusal <HI>GENERAL CIBBER</HI> proposes to the Audience, to <HI>read, with their Leave,</HI> the Part of <HI>Cato,</HI> and at the same time, play his <HI>design'd</HI> Part of <HI>Syphax</HI>—which he did— <HI>SHERIDAN</HI> seems to resent his <HI>Insolence</HI> in <HI>attempting</HI> to play a Part of <HI>HIS,</HI> on which the Fire grows hot on both sides, from which I beg leave to retire, being inclined to find out a safer Situation, and give you, <HI>Reader,</HI> leave to enter the <HI>Trenches</HI> with all my Heart.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. SHERIDAN's First APOLOGY To the TOWN.</HEAD>
<P>I Am extremely concerned for the Occa∣casion of my addressing you in this pub∣lic Manner, but as the Disappointment which you met with, at my not being able to perform, has given rise to several Stories very little in my Favour, I think it my Duty to clear up the Matter and justify myself. The Fact is thus: When I went to the Play-house, I found every thing in great Confusion, the People not paid and clamouring for their Money, the Musick refusing to play unless their Arrears were discharged, and an Ac∣count
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
brought at the same Time that Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> the Director and Manager of the whole had absconded. As I was dressing for my Part, I found the Robe which I had be∣fore worn in CATO was wanting; upon Enquiry, I heard, that, Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> had come two Days before and taken it from the House, I had some Reason to believe that he had done it purely to prevent my playing that Night; the Resentment I conceived at such Treatment, the Concern I was under lest the Audience should be disappointed, some other ill Usage I received, and several other Inci∣dents concurring (a Detail of which would take up too much Time) disordered me so much, that it not only rendered me incapa∣ble of doing Justice to the Character I was to play, but likewise almost took away my Voice. You yourselves were Witnesses of this, when I endeavoured to make an Apo∣logy and could not be heard. And indeed I was in such Confusion, that had I been heard I should not have been understood. I appeal to any reasonable Person then present, whe∣ther it were better in these Circumstances to dismiss the House, (which was my Intention) or to keep them purely to convince them, that it was not in my Power to get through one Speech of the Part. It has been said, that the want of a Robe was a trifling Thing, and that the Audience would have been con∣tent to have received me in any Dress; they
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
must have but little Skill in Theatrical Af∣fairs, who think a proper Habit is not abso∣lutely necessary. This was more particularly my Case in this Character, as it is one for which I am naturally very unfit in my Person, and in which nothing could have made my Appearance supportable, but a large Robe to cover my Defects, and give a Gravity and Dignity to my Person, which I wanted, and which are so absolutely necessary to the Cha∣racter. I know when an Audience is disap∣pointed, they often make but little Allow∣ances for the Actor, they feel nothing of the Concern and Anxiety of Mind he labours un∣der, when he has acquired a Reputation by performing a Character one Night, and sees himself about to lose it in an other. But it was not that, nor the ill Treatment I had re∣ceived, which hindred my playing, it was the Effect which all this had on me. I had so much Deference for the Audience, and so much Gratitude, nay, it was so much my Duty, that I should have sacrificed all Regard to Character, and every other Consideration, to have done my utmost to have pleased them even in the meanest Dress, had I not found that my Voice was quite gone, and that it was not in my Power to go through with one Scene. I was then reduced to this Difficulty, either to detain them, when I found I was not only incapable of giving them the Satis∣faction they might expect, but must have
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
given them the highest Disgust in my Per∣formance, or else fairly to tell them, that it was not in my power to play. I chose the latter; if it was an Error, it is one I have paid dearly for, since to that Principle I sa∣crificed above sixty Pounds, which I abso∣lutely lost by not playing. Such Persons as have assigned any other Cause for my not performing, if they can suppose me either vain, or ungrateful, or even impudent enough to disappoint an Audience meerly out of Whim or Humour, I hope will not think me Fool enough to stand to such a Loss.</P>
<P>And now (tho' I have already trespassed too much on your Patience) I must beg your In∣dulgence a little farther, as I perhaps shall not have another Opportunity of doing it, in per∣mitting me to return you, and all the Ladies, and Gentlemen of this Kingdom, who have honoured the Plays, in which I performed, with their Presence, my sincere and hearty Thanks for all your Favours. The Success I have met with has been an additional Pleasure to me, as by this means you have convinced the World how false that Opinion is, which has prevailed amongst some, that the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> are kinder to Strangers than their own People. For your great Indulgence to me is a manifest Proof, how willing you are to encou∣rage the least Dawn of Merit in one of your Country. Yet, I am sorry to say it, your
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
great Favour, and the prodigious Success I have met with, have I find raised me many Enemies, There are some People who cannot behold the Prosperity of others, in any Way of Life, without Envy; and as I am con∣scious to myself, that I have by no Action of mine deserved the Hatred of any Person, I must believe I have no Enemies but such as my Success has made so. That I have some is manifest from the Industry with which some People spread Reports to my Disadvantage, and the Readiness with which others believe them. My Gratitude to the Publick, the Friendship I have experienced in private, and the Love I have for my Country, would have detained me here much longer, (if I could in the least have contributed to the publick En∣tertainment,) in spight of any Advantages I could have proposed to myself in another Kingdom. I should be sorry a few Snakes in the Grass should drive me from so fair a Field; but it is a Misfortune in our Way of Life, that a few malicious People can do a Person more Injury in one Night, than the Friendship of the Publick in general can re∣pair.</P>
<P>I sincerely wish that the Success I have met with, be the means of raising up some Genius more worthy to entertain you, but this I will venture to say, that you will never find any,
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
who studied to do it with more Zeal and In∣dustry, or who has a more grateful Sense of the many Obligations, you have conferr'd, on</P>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE FROM <HI>Mr.</HI> THEOPHILUS CIBBER, <HI>Comedian</HI>, TO <HI>Mr.</HI> THOMAS SHERIDAN, <HI>Tragedian.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>STEPHEN'S-GREEN, <HI>Tuesday</HI> Afternoon, <DATE><HI>July</HI> 19, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE><HI>Mr.</HI> SHERIDAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR injudicious Disappointment of the Company last <HI>Thursday</HI>, who ex∣pected to see you in the Character of CATO, and your indiscreet Attempt to dis∣miss the Audience, having, as you confess, become a Town-talk, and given rise to many idle Falshoods, meerly calculated to injure the innocent, you must excuse me if I relate the Fact, strictly adhering to Truth. There
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
were many Witnesses of what I am about to declare; and I know none, except yourself, whose Memory is weak enough to forget it, or will be hardy enough to deny it.</P>
<P>When it drew near the Time proper to begin the Play, Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> and myself were alarm'd, in the Dressing-room, with a Re∣port, that you declared you would not play, because you had not the same Robe you wore in that Character before; and that you said, <HI>The Audience must be dismiss'd</HI>. This Rea∣son for dismissing an Audience, (propos'd by you who had no Right to dismiss them) ap∣pear'd to me so weak, I could not believe it, till you came into the Room, and swore, <HI>Unless you had that Robe, you would not act</HI>. This Declaration I looked upon as a rash Expression, the meer Effect of your then ruffled Temper; but could not yet suppose, you would proceed so idly as you did: You were then compleatly dress'd from Head to Foot (as well as ever the Character was dress'd in any Theatre in <HI>Ireland</HI> or <HI>Eng∣land</HI>) all but the Robe.</P>
<P>Upon Enquiry, it appeared, the Robes wore by <HI>Cato, Juba</HI> and <HI>Sempronius</HI>, the first Night, were borrowed by <HI>Philips</HI>, of some Gentlewoman in this Town, who bought them in an Auction at <HI>London</HI>, some Time since, but were by no means the Pro∣perty of the Managers, or any one belonging to the Theatre, nor were to be got that Night; so that all the Heroes were equally dis∣appointed
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
of those Trappings. Your Impa∣tience increased, and, tho' another Robe was brought you, (the same Robe that was made new, this Year, for Mr. <HI>Husband</HI>, in the Character of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>) you persisted in having the other uncomeatable Robe, or you positively would undress, and was deter∣mined not to play. To every body's Surprize you did undress, and, in spight of the most friendly Remonstrances to the contrary, you made a broken kind of Speech to the Audi∣ence; with which they were so dissatisfied, they could not help shewing it.</P>
<P>Before you went on, I entreated you (on the meer Exchange of a Robe) not do so un∣politic a Thing, I might add, unpolite, as to think of disappointing the Town of their Diversion: You reply'd, The Vexation had deprived you of your Voice, and rendered you incapable of performing: I desired you to consider, the first Act was of such a con∣siderable Length, you might have Time enough to recover your Temper, and your Voice would probably return with it; or if the Defect lasted, your attempting to per∣form would appear so obliging, the Audience would readily make any Allowances, when they knew you had been ruffled, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to think of giving them no Play at all, was what I could not but conceive would offend them.</P>
<P>To repeat all was said to you on this Oc∣casion, would add to the Tediousness of this
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Recital: But, as near as I can remember, no∣thing was omitted, in the most friendly man∣ner, to dissuade you from your mistaken Purpose.</P>
<P>I am informed you staid afterwards, just long enough to hear the extraordinary indul∣gent Reception the Audience were pleased to bestow on my proposing, with their Leave, to give them the Play, <HI>in the best Manner we could, since it was not in our Power to give it them so well as we would</HI>. You then ran hastily out of the House, and sent a Message afterwards to the Theatre, That you would not, by any means, have your Name delivered out for another Play, for you would posi∣tively act no more.</P>
<P>I should not, Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, have given you or myself this Trouble, but for the many Reports that fly about, of which, 'tis said, you are the Author: And since I have ad∣vanced so far, I must go a little farther, and make a few honest <HI>Queries</HI>; then, giving you a little Advice, shall submit to the Determi∣nation of the Publick, whether I (as it has been insinuated) ever intended you the least Prejudice; or, on the contrary, have not al∣ways acted towards you with Good-manners and Good-nature?</P>
<P>First then,—have I not your Letter by me, sent to me when in <HI>England</HI>, wherein you express yourself very desirous of my act∣ing in the same Theatre with you, and are solicitous for my coming over?—And
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
do you not know, your particular Applica∣tion since my Arrival, was one of my strong∣est Motives for playing in <HI>Smock-Alley</HI>, where I am likely to have a Law-Suit, for my Right, with the Managers, tho' I was offer'd the same Terms from <HI>Aungier Street</HI> Play-house, where my Agreement would have been sign'd by a Gentleman of Honour, whose Pay is as good as the Bank?</P>
<P>Have I not, on your return to the Stage this Season, in Compliment to you, play'd some inferior Characters, which, 'tis well known, I had a long time resign'd to younger Actors in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>Did I omit any Care, or grudge any Pains, to keep the Audience in Temper, when your sudden Indisposition prevented your playing the first intended Night of King <HI>Lear?</HI> Or, could I, for a Brother, have been more active, to silence the Reports then made to your Pre∣judice?—<HI>sed Tu Brute!</HI></P>
<P>Have not I desir'd you, tho' our remaining Nights of Playing were few, and we had large Sums at Stake, to fix the Plays to your own Mind?</P>
<P>Have you not been paid a large Part of that fresh Agreement you made, but did not com∣pleat, while we are unpaid our Agreements, tho', we have, 'tis notorious, often solicited the Managers to release us, if they found the Emptiness of the Town would not answer their continuing our Performance?—But we could get neither our Liberty nor our Money.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>Have not you often been an Ear-witness of these Proposals, and as often declar'd, we be∣hav'd with the greatest Lenity, and strictest Honour?</P>
<P>Did not your sudden breaking off from Playing leave us in a displeasing Dilemma? And was it not reasonable for us, to propose acting such Pieces, as might excite the greatest Curiosity in the Town, whereby the Mana∣gers might be enabled to pay us, and the rest of the Company?</P>
<P>Did I not decline ('till your positive De∣claration, that you would play no more this Season) appearing in any Character you had perform'd? And did you not express yourself as oblig'd to me, on making you that Com∣pliment, as you were pleas'd to term it?</P>
<P>How comes it then, Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, reported, that Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI>, and my self, have intended you any Injury? Or from whence is it said, that we (ridiculous, as false!) lock'd up your Cloaths, and did all we could to prevent your Playing? This, Sir, has been so frequently asserted, as a Fact related by you, that you ought as a Friend to Truth, to have fully answered such monstrous Falshoods; or may we not reasonably suppose, you did spread such Reports? If you can be the Author of such naughty Tales, what Language is fit to paint you?</P>
<P>The Letters I read this Day in the <HI>Dublin Journal</HI>, if not <HI>ipso facto</HI> yours, are yet so worded, an impartial Reader cannot but see
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
they were, at least, the work of some mista∣ken Friend, whose Good-nature you had im∣posed on, by false Relations: From whom, but you, could come the <HI>satisfactory Reasons, (not one of which are mentioned</HI>) for your not performing? Or the poor low Invectives, and mean Inuendoes therein contained?—Whom do you mean, by <HI>Designing Wretches</HI>, and <HI>Theatrical Politicians?</HI> Or what can you in∣tend but to insinuate, you have been artfully drove from the Stage, when you know your Absence from thence is absolutely your own Act and Deed?</P>
<P>Fie! fie! stick to Truth, or be ashamed of such publick Addresses, or to show your Face after them.</P>
<P>May not one suppose, Master <HI>Sheridan</HI>, the kind and civil Intention of these two Letters, is to create a Disturbance in the future Audi∣ences?</P>
<P>But let me inform you, when a Rebuff to an Actor appears premeditated and bespoke from Prejudice, such Treatment may put a poor Player out of Humour; but sure it ought not to put him out of Countenance.</P>
<P>If you withdraw yourself from the Theatre for a Time, must all Diversion stop 'till your Return? If a Vintner has not <HI>Ortelans</HI>, or any other extraordinary Dainties, in the Larder, will his Guests think it impertinent, if they are intreated to take such homely Entertain∣ment as the House affords?—And if the Defects of others, serve as a Foil to the Bril∣liancy
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
of your Performance, why should you be angry, at what, if you'd keep your Tem∣per, might prove so consolable to you?</P>
<P>Dear <HI>Tommy</HI>, don't prove such a Dog in a Manger; if you don't chuse Oats, why should you starve the rest of the Theatrical Cattle? Have more Compassion on your Fellow-Crea∣tures, or Fellow-Comedians.</P>
<P>But Master <HI>Tommy</HI>, may we not shrewdly suspect, tho' your Performances have been hi∣therto mostly tragical, you have given your Mind a little Bent towards Comedy, and, in those Studies, have taken a Hint from <HI>Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Petulant?</HI> who, to keep up an extraordinary Reputation, was notorious, under a Disguise, for calling for himself at a Coffee-house; where he would sometimes, in a Mask, send in for himself, wait for himself, nay, and not finding himself, would frequently <HI>leave a Let∣ter for himself:</HI>— 'Faith you are highly in Luck in improving a Hint I find.</P>
<P>But let me ask you a Home Question— Has not a great deal of that fuss of Mind, you have lately shewn, been more owing to your Disappointment, that the Audience would not depart, when you declar'd your high and mighty Displeasure, because you had not the self same gew-gaw, tinsel Train, more than from any Fears you had of having displeas'd them? Or was it nangry, because any one was permitted (under great Disadvantages) meerly to attempt, what they had never in their Lives a Thought of performing? Why this is the
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
passionate Extravaganza of our Brother PIS∣TOL, who, scorning all Contradiction, or Competition, bounces about in his Boots, kicks his Heels with Fury against the Stage, and swell'd with swaggering Rage and Non∣sense cries,
<Q>“Shall Dunghill Curs confront with <HI>Helicon</HI>, &amp;c.— Shall Pack-Horses and hollow pamper'd Jades of <HI>Asia</HI>, that cannot travel thirty Miles a-day, compare with <HI>Caesar</HI>, and with <HI>Cannibals</HI>, and with ”<HI>Trojan Greeks</HI>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>
But, as our Friend concludes, "Shall we fall foul for Toys?—</P>
<P>Tho' I don't think there is any thing perso∣nally terrible about you, yet I own you a Gentleman of great Formidability, who have the Power, if you say true, (and you know you have talk'd at that paw-paw rate) of calling down the Barracks, on any one you conde∣scend to be displeas'd with: Pray, do you mean the Stone Buildings? for I can't sup∣pose you presume to have any Command over the Gentlemen there, as I never heard of any Commission the King had yet honoured you with; and I believe there is hardly any there will think it worth their while, to attend the Call of your Whistle, to a silly Riot: I am rather inclinable to think, the worthy Spirits there, are more impatient to attend the Call of a Trumpet, at this glorious Juncture, and be in Actions worthy of them—And for the Gentlemen of the College, Sir, no Insinu∣ation shall make me dread ill Usage from those, whose Birth and Education will never suffer
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
them to hurt the Innocent, nor can I affront them with so ungenteel a Thought, that they will be the Tools of your wrong-plac'd Re∣sentment—Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, your Behaviour has extorted this from me, and as your Con∣science must tell you, I never meant you the least Injury, should you by any little Art aim thro' Pique or Passion, unhospitably to hurt a Stranger, it would be an Act wants a Name, and require such Language to answer, as would but ill become the Mouth of a Gentleman, or be fitting for the Ears of the Publick.</P>
<P>As my Stay here will be but very short, I but desire (what I will not doubt meeting with) a candid Reception for the few Nights I have to play, from the good-natured Town, whose past Favours I am proud of; to confess them is but an Act of Gratitude: Nor will I therefore think myself liable to the Imputation of a boasting Vanity—Let me, Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, give you this friendly Caution—Do not run into an Error most young Men, in our Business, have been too guilty of, who think their Merits are but barely paid, when their Reception is most favourable; and take that as their Due, which is mostly the Effect of a generous Disposition, in the Town, to en∣courage and support a rising Genius when∣ever it appears—Tho' People may be as fond of such, for a while, as Gallants are of a new Mistress, yet if Vanity and Caprice prevail, in such Performer, grown wild and wanton with Success, they know when to
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
withdraw their Favours, nor is it easy to re∣gain them—If ever I see you in <HI>England</HI>, I'll be most unmercifully reveng'd of you, for your Mistakes towards me; and will ab∣solutely endeavour, to make your Reception there, as pleasing to you, as you may have wish'd mine should have been here displeasing to me. But let us now mind our Business, and no more trouble the Publick with our Theat∣rical-Important-Nothings.— They will but laugh at us for our Pains.</P>

<P>AS there were many Witnesses of the tu∣multuous Riot, which you occasioned last Night at the Theatre (for which the Town are highly obliged to you) I shall make no Reflections on it; but leave the Relation thereof to the Impartial, and Unprejudic'd: —I say you occasioned; for, the Pretence of the College being offended, is a meer Pre∣tence: They are Men of Reason, and will not resent without a Cause: Nor is it a Reflection on the Society, that a few may be misled, by their mistaken Partiality to you; that ought no more to bring an Odium on such a large and worthy Body, than that you were, once, an unworthy Member thereof, which the Majority, by this Time, probably wish you ne'er had been.</P>
<P>Your Behaviour, Friend <HI>Thomas</HI>, has been so bad, I doubt if the smallest or lowest Body of People would chuse you to mingle with them; I scarce believe, the most indifferent Troop of Stroling Players, would chuse to rank with you. Yet 'tis methinks a Pity! You should not be quite lost to the Stage; since, tho' you are not equal to all Parts, there are two. I'll venture to say, you'll always make an extraordinary Figure in; I mean the
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
Characters of MASKWELL and SCRUB. You seem to have studied and practised them tho∣roughly—I cannot suppose my Frankness to you can have offended any Set of Gentle∣men: Are you not free to answer for your∣self, in any Manner you think proper? And, as to the Gentlemen of the College, I here solemnly declare, I am not conscious of having design'd the least Offence to them, in Word, in Deed, or even in Thought.</P>
<P>Would any friendly Monitor convince me, how 'tis possible for me, to have said, or done ought to the Offence of any one in this King∣dom (you Master <HI>Tommy</HI> excepted) I should be asham'd not to acknowledge my Error, and would readily as I ought, ask their Pardon. — But why should I wonder at your un∣hospitable Attempts towards a Stranger, when you could so unmercifully threaten even a Brother, with being ill used, if he presumed to play any Part of yours; this is a Fact, naughty-paughty <HI>Tommy</HI>, too well known by many for you to deny.</P>
<P>But, pray Sir, by what Act of Parliament do you lay this monopolizing Claim, that, even during your Absence from the Stage, no one must presume to appear in any Part you please to call yours?—Thou dear Mock-Monarch, have Copper Crowns and <HI>Tinsell'd Robes</HI> so elated thee, as to think thy Commands are absolute?—I wonder you have not pub∣lished your Royal Mandate, to all the Theatres in his Majesty's Dominions, that none shall
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
dare attempt any Character you have but thought of.—Thou really seemest to be such a choice Sort of a Monarch, as your Bro∣ther <HI>Tommy Thumb</HI>'s King <HI>Arthur</HI>. Why, while the Stage looks gloomy from your Ab∣sence, do you not cry out with him,
<Q><L>"Let nothing but a Face of Grief appear,</L>
<L>"The Man that smiles this Day, shall lose his Head,</L>
<L>"That he may have no Head to smile withal.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>Mr. SHERIDAN's Second ADDRESS To the TOWN.</HEAD>
<P>I Was in Hopes I should not have had Oc∣casion to trouble the Publick any more, but farther Misfortunes falling on me, and farther Crimes laid to my Charge, have put me under the Necessity of vindicating myself.</P>
<P>It has been said, that I spirited up the Scholars to prevent Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s performing last <HI>Thursday</HI>.—In answer to this, I most solemnly declare, that upon reading the Ad∣vertisement which they had put in <HI>Faulkner</HI>'s Journal, without my Knowledge, out of Zeal to my Interest, I made it my Business to find out the Gentlemen who had drawn it up, and by all the Arguments I was Master of, drew a Promise from them that they would not go to the Play-House the above Night. For the Truth of this, I appeal to themselves. They have already publish'd an Advertisement in <HI>Reilly</HI>'s Paper of last <HI>Satur∣day</HI>, in which they have entirely clear'd me, and given Reasons why they alter'd their Re∣solution. Most of these Gentlemen I was
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
hardly known to; if I had had a Design to have form'd a Party in the College, I think it was most probable, that I should have ap∣plied to such as I had the pleasure of know∣ing: I appeal to them then, or any of them, whether I ever spoke to them on that Head, unless it was to use their Endeavours to pre∣vent any such Resolution being enter'd into.</P>
<P>Tho' the Publick may have but little Re∣gard to my bare Word on this Occasion, yet if they consider, that after so solemn a De∣claration, if what I say be false, I put it in the Power of any one of these Gentlemen, at any Time, to prove me a Scoundrel, if they consider how low I must fall, even in their Opinions, should I give what they know to be a Lye, under my Hand in a public Man∣ner, I hope no one will think, that I would, with my Eyes open, commit such a Piece of Folly.</P>
<P>I well knew the fatal Consequences of forming a Party, and too well foresaw the Use my Enemies would make of it, to my Disadvantage. For, indeed, what could I propose to myself by it, but to bring the Hatred of the Public upon me, and what End would it answer? I never look'd on Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> as an Antagonist of mine; I always had so mean an Opinion of him in his Cha∣racters in Tragedy, that I would not even wish that he should have the Reputation of being such, by any Opposition made on my Part; I hope the Publick will readily believe,
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
that I had no Cause to be afraid of his appearing in any Character of mine.</P>
<P>As to the impudent and scurrilous Epistle which Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> publish'd, I was determin'd to take no Notice of it, for I thought him in every Respect beneath my lowest Resentment; I did not care to wrestle with a Sweep-chim∣ney: But as I find there are a few who do not know the Man, led away by his false Representations, and as he has endeavoured to abuse that noble Principle, for which this Kingdom is so justly famed, and which I hope we shall never lose, I mean that generous Spirit of Hospitality derived to us from our Forefathers, to his own wicked Ends and Purposes, I think it necessary for my own Sake, and for the Sake of the Publick, to unmask this <HI>Iago</HI>, and lay him open to the World. In order to do this, I shall beg leave to state one Fact.</P>
<P>The Night that I was to have performed <HI>Cato</HI>, (an unfortunate Night for me, when a thousand unforeseen Accidents had thrown me into such a disorder'd State of Mind as I had never known before) I found of a sud∣den Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Behaviour, which before was very complaisant, or rather meanly sub∣missive, was totally changed; instead of try∣ing all Methods to appease a Person beside himself with Passion, he did all he could to aggravate Matters: When I asked him what I should do in this Exigence, for want of a Robe? he answered, somewhat shortly, play without
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
a Robe: When, upon that, I laid open to him what a despicable Figure I should make, he turn'd upon his Heel, and said, D—n me if I care what you do, the Play shall not stand still for you; and immediately went and ordered the Prompter to draw up the Curtain. When I heard this, I was stunn'd at the Insolence of the Fellow, who neither had any Right to command in that House; nor was in any Shape interested in the Event of that Night. It put me past all Patience, and the Terror I was under, lest the Curtain should be drawn up before I had Time to make an Apology, at a Time that I found myself incapable of playing, made me rush like a Madman precipitately on the Stage, before I had considered what I should say to the Audience. Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, to my great Surprize, came on immediately after me, and very officiously (to give it no harsher a Term) offered to read the Part of <HI>Cato</HI>, at the same Time that he was to play <HI>Syphax</HI>. I say officiously; for if I can make it appear that he was no way concerned, either in Point of Interest or Money, the World will judge so too.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> knows, that the Actors had determined to seize on the Receipts of that Night, and all the succeeding ones, except the next, (the entire Receipts of which were to be mine) to pay themselves their Salaries, of which they had been defrauded by the Roguery of some of the Managers. He
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
knows, that the Reason of his continuing to play on afterwards, was only to fulfil his Agreement, that he might have an Opportu∣nity of suing the Persons he contracted with for the Sum stipulated. He knows (notwith∣standing his plausible Pretence in his Epistle, for chusing the Characters which he gave out) that he intended to perform, in these Words,
<Q>“And was it not reasonable for us propose acting such Pieces, as might ex∣cite the greatest Curiosity in the Town, <HI>whereby the Managers might be enabled to ”pay us and the rest of the Company</HI>.</Q>
I say, he knows that not a Shilling of this was ei∣ther to go to the Managers, or to them. He knows, that he had a Lawyer's Opinion, That it was not necessary for him to perform the Number of Nights mentioned in their Agreement, it was sufficient if he was ready to perform them in the limited Time. He knows, that he reckoned into one of the Number the Play of the <HI>Rehearsal</HI>, which was dismissed the Night before. What then could prompt Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, to make such an extravagant and impudent Proposal to the Audience, as that of reading the Character of <HI>Cato</HI>, when at the same Time he was to play <HI>Syphax</HI>. I say, what could prompt him to give himself so much unnecessary Trouble, if he was no way obliged to it, either in Point of Duty, Interest, or Money. It was a malicious and wicked Scheme which he had long had in Agitation, and which my Misfortune that
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
Night first gave him an Opportunity of put∣ting in Practice. It was a Design of building his Fame upon my Ruin.</P>
<P>In order to prove this, I shall, first of all, give a short Account of my Behaviour to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, since his Arrival in this King∣dom. To proceed in his own Method, I shall beg leave to ask him a few Questions.</P>
<P>Is he not conscious, that had it not been for me, he could not have set his Foot on any Stage in this Kingdom?</P>
<P>Did I not quash a Cartel, which was sign∣ed by the Managers of both Companies, un∣der severe Penalties, to exclude him from acting on either Stage?</P>
<P>Did I not, as a Stranger, treat him with all Civility, tho' the unhappy Character he labour'd under prevented my having any Friendship with him?</P>
<P>Was I not a principal Means of preventing the Trial between Mr. <HI>Sloper</HI> and him, and the Letters which passed between him and his Wife, from being reprinted here soon after his Arrival: And did I not commission a Friend to offer the Expence of the Im∣pression, out of my own Pocket, rather than a Stranger should be hurt?</P>
<P>Did I not promise him, to study any new Character for his second Benefit? (A Favour which I had refused to others much more worthy of it.)</P>
<P>Did I not, when I found Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> tri∣fling with him, and refusing to perform the
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
Contract, before his Face declare, that I never would in any Shape be concern'd with Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> hereafter, if be did not pay him, nay, more, offer'd to play with Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> in the other House; to try by that Means to make up his Loss?</P>
<P>Did not Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> say on that Occasion, that I behav'd with such Honour, and laid him under such Obligations, that he only wish'd for an Opportunity to return them?</P>
<P>The first be had was the above-mention'd unhappy Night. Might not one reasonably expect after all this, that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> would not try to injure me, if I did nothing to in∣jure him? But he had worn the Mask too long, he found an Opportunity of throwing it off, and leap'd at it with the greatest Ea∣gerness, notwithstanding the many Obliga∣tions I had laid him under to me; he could not forgive me, that my Name brought full Houses, when he was obliged to dismiss, or to play to empty Benches. His Envy, Spleen, and Malice, which long lay smother'd in his Breast, now burst forth into a Blaze. He saw me under the Necessity of disappointing an Audience, and consequently disobliging them. He contributed as far as in him lay to the one, and was determin'd to improve the other.</P>
<P>I have already shewn, that he was not ob∣liged, by any Principle of Duty or Profit, to this Work of Supererogation; it must be then from some other Motive, <HI>Complaisance
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
to the Audience perhaps</HI>.—Impudent as he is, he cannot think that the doing so un∣precedented a Thing, as that of reading a capital Part, and playing another at the same Time, could give them any Pleasure; an Attempt which no one but himself could ever have thought of, and which even his own Hardiness must have been shocked at, had he not had the blackest Malice in his Heart to prompt him to it. He saw the Audience greatly offended at the Disappoint∣ment they met with in my not being able to perform, and very justly too, since it was not in my power to give them the Reasons which prevented it. He laid hold of this Opportunity, at once, to run me down in the Opinion of the World, and ingratiate himself by the Appearance of an officious Zeal <HI>to do every Thing that might give Plea∣sure to the Public</HI>. He hoped by this Means to drive me out of the Kingdom, and to esta∣blish himself here for the next Winter, as he knows it is impossible for him to return to <HI>London</HI>. This is the more probable, as I had often declar'd in Confidence to him, that I should never be able to stand the Shock of any Party form'd against me. His subse∣quent Behaviour is a manifest Proof of his Design: For after I had left the Playhouse, and sent Word in the Heat of Passion, that I should never play there again, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, for Fear I should cool upon it, or try to re∣concile the Favour of the Town to me
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
again, in a violent Hurry gave out three Plays together, (a most unusual Thing, unless in case of Benefits) in two of which he was to appear in Characters of mine. By this Means, let me have been ever so innocent, had not the other Company been in Town, I must have quitted the Field to him, and left him triumphant.</P>
<P>This was not all—</P>
<P>When I endeavour'd to vindicate myself to the Public, and make an Apology for not performing, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> undertook to answer me. What Right, or what Colour like to Right, had he to undertake it? I made no mention of him in the Paper which I pub∣lish'd, tho' I had a just Reason to do it; be∣cause I did not care to be embroil'd with a Man of his troublesome Temper, who has always kept every Theatre in which he was engag'd in hot Water. I had hitherto had no Quarrel to him, I had done him some Favours, should he not if he had the least Humanity (to leave Gratitude out of the Question) have endeavour'd rather to clear me in the Opinion of the Town than endea∣vour'd to hurt me. I cannot find that he himself has given any tolerable Colour for his entering so cavalierly a Volunteer in the Cause. His setting out, where certainly he ought to have given some Reason for his undertaking such a Part, is no more than this;
<Q>“Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, Your injudicious Dis∣appointment of the Company last <HI>Thursday</HI>,
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
who expected to see you in the Character of <HI>Cato</HI>, and your indiscreet Attempt to dismiss the Audience, having, as you con∣fess, become a Town-talk, and given Rise to many idle Falshoods, merely calculated to injure the Innocent, you must excuse me if I relate the Fact, strictly adhering to ”Truth.</Q>
So that here he does not pretend to give any Reason, only, <HI>You must excuse</HI>.</P>
<P>Here and thro' the whole Epistle, you may observe by his ill-natur'd and bitter Ex∣pressions, his personal Pique and Spleen to me, who never had injur'd him. Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> mentions in the Course of his Letter, that he heard I had spread about several Reports to his Disadvantage, but why did Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, whose Motto to this Epistle is, <HI>It is a kind of Slander to trust to Rumour</HI>, so readily believe those Reports of one with whom he had hitherto liv'd on a good Footing. Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> had heard the same Thing in regard to him∣self, but he, like a Gentleman, came and ask'd me the Truth of it, and I satisfy'd him. Why did not Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, if he had the least of a Gentleman about him, behave in the same Manner, before be ventur'd to pub∣lish them to the World, and draw Conclu∣sions from them, as Truths, to my Disadvan∣tage? No, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> neither wanted, nor wish'd that I should justify myself; his Affairs were grown so desperate, that he had no Hope left, but by a Train of villanous Ca∣lumnies, and a Profusion of scurrilous Lan∣guage,
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
to try to make me do something mon∣strous, to plunge me still deeper in the Dis∣pleasure of the Town; at least he had Hopes that this Conduct might rouse (perhaps) the indiscreet Zeal of some of my Friends or Well-wishers, to attempt something against him, which he would be sure to lay at my Door. Unhappily for me, the latter Part succeeded to his Wish.</P>
<P>To prove that this was his Principle, I shall only make use of one Argument. I shall not pretend to justify or condemn the Gentlemen of the College, it is not my Busi∣ness, and the World may easily see how tick∣lish a Point that would be for me to handle. All I shall endeavour to do, is, to prove that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, knowingly and willingly, brought it upon himself. He treated the Advertise∣ments which they had put into the <HI>Journal</HI>, in a contemptuous and insolent Way, on a Supposition that they were mine. But no one shall make me believe that any Man of common Sense, as I will allow Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> to be, could suppose me either foolish enough or base enough to do it. Had I wrote such an Advertisement in the Name of the Gentle∣men of the College, was it not natural for them to enquire who it was that dar'd to make use of their Name, and had I done it, what Punishment would have been too great for my Presumption?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> might easily have known of Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI>, whether they had left it there
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
or no. Upon this Probability then, that he must have known it was theirs, what could Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> expect from a Set of young Gen∣tlemen, who are, thro' their Youth, warm? What could he hope for, but that they would shew their Resentment for this contemptuous Manner of treating what they had wrote? Nay, must he not expect, that probably they would think themselves bound in Honour to take some publick Method of convincing him that they had wrote it, lest the Calumny which he had cast upon me, thro' their Si∣lence, should be fix'd upon me. People may wonder, that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> should run such a Risque from such a Motive; but he has been so accustom'd to Things of this Nature, that they appear to him but as common Matters. The Pleasure he proposed to himself in having an Opportunity of displaying his Eloquence the next Day, of throwing at the Feet of the Public <HI>an unfortunate Stranger unhospitably us'd</HI>, and above all, the joyful Hope of being able to fix this Disturbance upon me, as it's Author, would, he thought, more than com∣pensate for any Thing he could suffer.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> is the more inexcusable, as I took all Pains to prevent his doing any rash Thing, which might draw more Odium on him from the Gentlemen of the College; I told Mr. <HI>Wright</HI> and several others of the Players, that it might reach his Ears, that I had been with the Gentlemen of the College, to prevent any Mischief, not for Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
sake, (for I owed him no Favour) but my own: That I had laid open to them the ill Consequences that would attend me, should any Disturbance happen at the Theatre; that upon this, they had all promised in a solemn Manner, not to go; and I bid them assure Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, that he need not fear any Inter∣ruption. Notwithstanding this, he publish'd his Epistle afterwards, wherein the Gentle∣men of the College thought themselves per∣sonally ill-treated, and were rouz'd into such a Rage, as no Endeavours of mine or all Mankind could have appeas'd.</P>
<P>Does not this Conduct of his evidently prove, that he shut his Eyes to Conviction, that he was determin'd at all Events to pursue the Scheme he had laid down; it either must be owing to this, or to the strangest Infatuation that ever possessed Man. As to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Postscript, I read it without any Emotion, and heartily thank him for it. He has there painted himself in stronger Colours than either I could, or my Humanity would suffer me me to do. His ridiculous Challenge, in the true Stile of an <HI>Ancient Pistol</HI>, sent to me by all the News-Boys in Town, I despise. He has put himself, by his Behaviour, far be∣neath the Footing of a Gentleman. I shall go about my Business as usual, if I am attack'd, I shall endeavour to defend myself, nor shall I ever be afraid of any who dare do Wrong. And now I have done with him — I am sorry I have been compelled to shew
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
any Man in so bad a Light, but the World must do me the Justice to own, he has forc'd me to do it in my own Defence, I shall trouble my Head no farther with him, but leave him to Heav'n,
<Q><L>And to the Thorns which in his Bosom lodge,</L>
<L>To goad and sting him.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is now Time I should address myself to the Publick. There are two Things laid to my Charge; one is, that I spirited up the Gentlemen of the College to raise a Distur∣bance in the Theatre.—A heavy Charge indeed, if true: I have done all that is in the Power of Man to clear myself of it, and I hope there is none of the least Humanity but will acquit me. The other is, That I wil∣lingly disobliged the Publick in not playing the Part of <HI>Cato</HI>.</P>
<P>I published an Apology, not without con∣sulting a Gentleman, of great Knowledge and Experience in the World, in it, which, perhaps, the Over-Easiness of my Friends thought a sufficient Defence. Perhaps, in∣deed, I imposed on myself as well as them.</P>
<P>If there be any who think I meant them an Offence, that I did it thro' Wantonness, or thro' Contempt of the Audience, I heartily ask their Pardon; and the only Way I have left to make them Amends, is to exert my∣self in that Character on <HI>Thursday</HI> next, if they will honour me with their Company that Night. The Matter is come to this Issue, that I must either rise or fall in the
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
Opinion of the World by the Event of that Night. If I am the Person Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> re∣presents; if I was an unworthy Member of the College; (which my old Cotemporaries there, and those Ornaments of Learning, the Fellows, who knew my Behaviour, will hardly take his Word for) if I am not fit to be received in a Company of Strollers, (for which Compliment the many People of Fa∣shion, who have honour'd me with their Acquaintance in private, and their Approba∣tion in publick, are much obliged to him) I am not indeed worthy of your Countenance: You all know me; I have lived amongst you; if have the least Title to your Favour, I hope the Good-nature of my Friends, and the Benevolence of the Publick, which I have so often, and in so extraordinary a Man∣ner experienced, will not desert me in this Exigence, nor suffer me to fall a Sacrifice to the mean Artifice, and be banished my Coun∣try by the wicked Schemes of a—no, I will not put myself so much on a Footing with him, as to call him by the Name he deserves—who, I am well assur'd, dare not shew his Face in his own.</P>
<P>If any Expressions too warm or indiscreet, have drop'd from me, in the Course of this Address, I hope for the Indulgence of the Publick, when I inform them that I have been obliged to draw it up almost in the Space of one Day, and that too in no very easy State of Mind: For I question whether
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
the innocent Man, tho' he has great Ad∣vantages over the other, feels less than the Man of Guilt, while he is labouring under a Load of Calumny. My whole Intention was to endeavour to clear myself, with all Duty, Deference and Submission to the Publick, whose</P>

<OPENER><DATE><HI>Wednesday</HI> Afternoon, <HI>July</HI> 11, 1743.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I call this a <HI>Proper Reply</HI>, I mean such a one as may be <HI>fitting for the Publick to read</HI>, and <HI>not</HI> such a one <HI>as</HI> Sheridan <HI>ought to receive</HI>; without playing the Critick on his nonsensical, tautolo∣gical Stile, and rambling Inconnections, I shall only take this Notice of his Scurrility: Foul Language, in an Address to the Publick, is an Affront to their Ears; 'tis a Breach of good Manners, and almost as unpardonable as throwing Glasses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Company, there is neither Wit, Sense, Pleasantry or Bravery in either—That it is said by many that <HI>Mr.</HI> Sheridan <HI>spirited up some Persons to create a Disturbance in the Theatre</HI>, is a known Truth, and it is also a Truth, that many firmly believe it, from well grounded Reasons. SHERIDAN<HI>'s pretending</HI> to know nothing of the Advertis∣ment and Letter, first publish'd in Mr. <HI>Faulk∣ner</HI>'s Journal, is not at all surprising, after
<PB N="$$" REF="42" MS="y"/>
many other Things he has modestly ventur'd to assert, even when Numbers know the con∣trary. Mr. ARNE told me at the <HI>Rainbow-Coffee-House</HI>, on <HI>Wednesday</HI> last, in Company with several others, that he had been just talking with Mr. <HI>Falkner</HI> at the <HI>Globe Coffee-House</HI>, who, among other Things, declar'd his Opinion, that it was indiscreet in Mr. <HI>Sheri∣dan</HI> to cause, or suffer, such Things to be publish'd; it would be more likely to preju∣dice than serve him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that he had ad∣vis'd Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> to the contrary;—whose Reply was—<HI>He was determin'd</HI>.—Besides this, 'tis notorious he had several Persons to dine or sup with him, on different Days, and had lost no Time, nor spared any Money in Chair-Hire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to alarm all Parts of the Town, as well as his particular Intimates, he was an injur'd Person forsooth! tho' in what has not yet appear'd. Add to this his previous Decla∣rations to any one's appearing in any Part he had thought of playing; his threatning them with an ill Reception from his Friends, over whom he boasted a particular Sway (no great Compliment to them by the way) and what must we think of this Man; or what Regard ought the Publick to have either to his Word or Oath?</P>
<P>The Riot that ensued on the <HI>Thursday</HI> fol∣lowing, is known to the whole Town; their Sentiments of it will better come from their Mouths than my Pen.—The Town's ge∣nerous and uncommon Reception and Pro∣tection
<PB N="$$" REF="43" MS="y"/>
of me since, was an Instance what an Abhorrence they had of the former rash Be∣haviour of a few, misled by a very bad Man: —I must have Recourse to his Vocabulary, e'er I can find Words low enough to paint him. The kind Treatment the Publick af∣forded me on <HI>Monday</HI> Night, I am conscious, was more owing to their spirited hospitable Usage of a Stranger, than any Merits my Attempts to please them could lay claim to: —I have a sincere and grateful Sense of their Favours; it warms my Heart, and I shall al∣ways think it a Duty incumbent on me, loud∣ly to acknowledge an Act so much to their Honour: I confess it here, and shall not forget it when in <HI>England</HI>, to which Place I am re∣turning speedily;—tho' the modest, the brave Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, whose Veracity is to be ranked with bis other Virtues, is pleased to assert the Impossibility of my returning. I shall contradict him by Facts, not by dirty Language.</P>
<P>Let me inform him, all bad Expressions re∣tort upon the Slanderer; let then his own scur∣rilous Libel stick on himself, till he wipes it off like a Gentleman. His Affectation of treating me with Contempt, as an Actor, is such a pretty Piece of presumptive Vanity, that his choice Opinion alone should lead the Town, and such a paltry Puff of his own Praise, as is only fit to be laugh'd at. But how, if the great <HI>Sheridan</HI> should have given some∣thing, under his own Hand, quite contradic∣tory
<PB N="$$" REF="44" MS="y"/>
to this mean Opinion of a Man <HI>whom</HI>, he says, <HI>he had no Cause to be afraid of?</HI> What will Gentlemen think of <HI>Tommy</HI> then? Why —as they think of him already —As I chuse Facts, rather then meer Assertions, to contradict his Calumny and Falshoods, I de∣sire the Patience of the Publick to read the following Letter, sent from Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> to me, in a Letter inclos'd to Mr, <HI>Giffard</HI>, then in <HI>London</HI>, the Date says when.</P>

<P>THO' I have not the Favour of being known to you, yet I make bold to write to you about an Affair, in which you are concerned as well as I. <HI>I hear the Gentlemen of</HI> Aungier-street <HI>Theatre, intend to make Proposals to you, a∣bout a Summer-Expedition to this Kingdom;</HI> as I had some Thoughts of doing the same in fa∣vour of the People in <HI>Smock-Alley,</HI> this Intel∣ligence has hasten'd my Application to you per∣sonally, which otherwise might appear too ab∣rupt. There are many Reasons why <HI>I should think it our mutual Interest to play in one House</HI>. In the first Place, if we act in diffe∣rent Houses, the Town will possibly be divided, and the Receipts of both will necessarily be much lessened. Not that I should expect this upon the footing of Merit, but I know not how it is,
<PB N="$$" REF="45" MS="y"/>
whether it be their Partiality to their Country-man, or whether it be owing to the powerful In∣terest of a Number of Friends that I have in this City, but there never was known such En∣couragement, such Applause given to any Actor, or such full Houses as since I appear'd on the Stage. Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> will inform you that <HI>Dub∣lin</HI> is not like <HI>London,</HI> we have not two Audi∣ences in the whole City, especially <HI>as the Town is now more empty than it has ever been known</HI>. Besides, as if is not improbable, but that we may be together next Winter, it will be a great Advantage to practise such Plays to∣gether, as we can both appear in. <HI>I am com∣missioned to assure you from the Managers of</HI> Smock-Alley, <HI>and I will also do it from myself, that you shall have all the Encouragement that you can expect, they are as willing, and they are as well able to do it as those in</HI> Aun∣gier-street. I should be obliged to you, if you would let me know as soon as possible, whether you have any design of coming hither, what are your Therms, and how soon it would be conveni∣ent for you to come. You may think <HI>it is my own Interest that has prompted me to write to you,</HI> 'tis very true, <HI>I have no small Cause to be afraid of so potent an Antagonist,</HI> but I believe upon mature Deliberation, you will al∣so find it your Interest to be with us. If you will favour me with a speedy Answer, you'll extremly oblige,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="$$" REF="46" MS="y"/>To this I wrote an Answer, I believe, not unbecoming a Gentleman to send, or a Gen∣tleman to receive: <HI>Sheridan</HI> may print it if he pleases; I hope he wont alter it tho'.— As I have been honour'd with a Message from the Heads of the College, to signify their De∣testation of the outragious Proceedings at the Theatre, on the Night <HI>Othello</HI> was first inten∣tended; and those Gentlemen having abso∣lutely disclaimed any of the Advertisements being any Act of the College; but, on the contrary, look on them as a Reflection and Affront on that worthy Body, <HI>let</HI> Sheridan <HI>make them Libellers, not I</HI>; I say <HI>Sheridan— Sheridan</HI>, who carried that Piece of Rhetorick last <HI>Friday</HI> to Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI>, who prudentially <HI>chose not to affront his worthy Fellow Citizens</HI>, as he declared to <HI>Sheridan:</HI>—indeed, Mas∣ter <HI>Tommy</HI>, to soften it, it seems, alter'd the Word <HI>Butchers</HI> to <HI>Ruffians</HI>; a tender Appel∣lation! and then was angry with Mr. <HI>Faulk∣ner</HI>, who positively refused to insert it: Some other Printers did insert it, who have confessed <HI>Sheridan brought it to them</HI>. Here it may not be improper to transcribe <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s third Paragraph of his modest Address, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“Tho' the Publick may have but little Regard to my bare Word on this Occasion, yet if they consider that after so solemn a Declaration, if what I say be false, I put it in the Power of any one of these Gentlemen, at any Time, to prove me a Scoundrel, if they consider how low I must fall, even in
<PB N="$$" REF="47" MS="y"/>
their Opinions, should I give what they know to be a Lye, under my Hand in a publick Manner, I hope no one will think that I would, with my Eyes open, commit such ”a Piece of Folly.</Q></P>
<Q>O! <HI>Sheridan, Sheridan!</HI> Quae te dementia coepit?</Q>
<P>You little thought when you wrote this, that Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI> had declar'd his refusing the Advertisement, or that Mrs. <HI>Reily</HI> had sent Word to the College, that <HI>You</HI> brought the Advertisement to her, in which <HI>you</HI> changed the Word <HI>Butchers</HI> to <HI>Ruffians</HI>; and by which in the Name of the <HI>abused College</HI>, you clear <HI>yourself</HI> of knowing any Thing of the Matter: Any one may be satisfied of the Truth of this, who will give themselves the Trouble to call at the Printer's.</P>
<P>As to the Insinuation of my procuring Ruf∣fians (as the well bred <HI>Sheridan</HI> may stile them) to be at the Theatre, I appeal to the Publick, if I have not always, in any Discourse I ever held on the Subject, made it my earnest Request, every Step should be avoided that might disturb the publick Peace; and I hoped none would be omitted to preserve it. If any honest Man will step forth, and say, I have not acted thus, or ever desired any one to be present, to give me a forced Applause, let this, I say, be proved and I'll bow me to the Shame <HI>Tom Sheridan</HI> deserves for all his Falshoods.</P>
<P>In answer to the Message I was favoured with from the College, as aforementioned, I
<PB N="$$" REF="48" MS="y"/>
begg'd my humble Respects might be accep∣table; and tho' I was pressed to mention the Names of those, who were concerned in the Disturbance, I desir'd to be excus'd; since, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was a Stranger to their Persons, I might possibly be misinform'd; and tho' I had been advised to address the Provost on this Occa∣sion, nay, farther, to apply for a Lord Chief Justice's Warrant, to be served on the Ag∣gressors—I declin'd all Proceedings of this Sort; tho' I have an undoubted Right to the Protection of the Laws, equal with any of my Fellow-Subjects. I had Charity enough to consider this, as an inconsiderate Act of warm Blood, and more the Effect of Partia∣lity to this artful Man, than any ill Will to me; I imagined their cooler Reason would disprove it, I believed their Judgments would not repeat it, and I declared, without fresh Occasion, never to disturb any one about it: I have kept my Word.</P>
<P>But, to go on with you, Sir, pray what were those thousand unforeseen Accidents that so disorder'd your dear Mind, on the fatal Night you mention? Why have you not recited them? I call'd on you to do it in my Epistle to you. Did you not appear to every one very tranquil, till there was no great Hopes of a crouded Audience; still your Philosophy prevailed, till it appear'd the Robe did not appear; that indeed
<Q>“in∣”flam'd your noble Liver, and made you rage;</Q>
well, but
<Q>“on a sudden Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Be∣haviour,
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
which before was very complai∣”sant, or rather meanly submissive (a gene∣rous and grateful Expression, for my treating you all along with more Breeding than you deserv'd, or probably ever understood or practis'd) "was totally changed."</Q>
This As∣sertion every one, behind the Scenes that Night, can deny; I appeal to Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wright</HI>, and many others there, if I did not advise you, like a Friend and a Gentle∣man, not to do an indiscreet uncivil Thing toward the Audience, let <HI>Philips</HI> or any one be to blame;—and so,
<Q>“on my ordering the Curtain to be drawn up, you rush'd ”precipitately on the Stage:</Q>
These Lyes are as monstrous as the Father of 'em. I never order'd the Curtain to rise till the Au∣dience accepted my Offer of having <HI>Cato</HI> read. Did you not undress yourself from Head to Foot, and positively swear to me and several, you would inform the Audience you would not play, on account of your Dis∣appointment? Were not you in your own Cloaths when you appeared? And did you not farther, even then, abuse the Ears of the Audience, with saying, <HI>Philips</HI> had lock'd up your Cloaths, tho' many saw you dressed for the Part as aforementioned?</P>
<P>If I chose to play on to fulfil my A∣greement, which the Managers would not release me from, was I not right?—The Actors, you say, determin'd to seize on the Receipt of that Night, to pay their Salaries;
<PB N="$$" REF="50" MS="y"/>
'Tis true, <HI>You</HI>, Mr, <HI>Morris</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Wright</HI> agreed, they should have that House, not hav∣ing received any Salary for three Weeks — But, you propos'd to receive the next for yourself alone: And had taken care to seize the best Receipt taken at your playing, (viz. the first Night of <HI>Cato</HI>) which did not amount to Forty Pounds.—Who then acted ho∣nestly, I, who chose not to dismiss the Au∣dience, or you, who to the Disappointment of the poor unpaid People, would have de∣priv'd 'em of the Receipt of that House, by a Dismission? What could I propose by playing on, but justly to fulfil the Agree∣ments on my part, which the unfair Mana∣gers would neither Release us from, nor Pay us for? Certainly I ought to take all legal means to recover, what I have been so un∣justly depriv'd of. The Dismission of the <HI>Rehearsal</HI>, (a Play given out by <HI>Philips</HI> on a By-Day, when you were yourself afraid of playing) was the imprudent Act of <HI>Philips</HI>; tho' at the Time the Audience were sent away, every one allows, there was a better Prospect of an Audience, than there was at the same Hour, to the Play of <HI>Cato</HI>.—If my offering to the Audience to read <HI>Cato</HI> and play <HI>Syphax</HI>, was, as your Wit and Modesty term it, an impudent and extravagant Propo∣sal; what sort of Language, would you be∣stow on them who allow'd of it if you durst? The Trouble was not unnecessary, tho' fa∣tiguing enough; it was both my Duty and In∣terest
<PB N="$$" REF="51" MS="y"/>
to act, as the Audience directed: And, <HI>by their Appointment</HI> I play'd <HI>Syphax</HI>, and read <HI>Cato</HI>. I wonder you have not publish'd your Displeasure towards them, for the ter∣rible Mortification your little Pride, mean Vanity, poor Envy, and rancorous Heart felt from the unbounded Good-nature they shew'd me on that Occasion—But this, it seems, <HI>Tommy</HI> says, was a malicious wicked Scheme, I had long in Agitation. Sure, I must have dealt with the Devil, <HI>Tommy</HI>, to have fore∣known you could have acted, so suddenly as you did, the part of such an extravagant Fool: Who could have suspected it? And why should I, Chicken, wish to build my Fame upon thy poor Ruin? I question if I did not pass for an Actor of Reputation, when you probably eat Spoon-Meat; to build my Fame upon such Ruins, were as low, as a General's hoping to gain Reputation, from his laying Siege to, and demolishing a set of, Cotts or Cabins. I ask Pardon for the sudden Extravaganza of the Comparison, as far as it relates to the Officer; but shall not apolo∣gize for what part relates to you: You will be honour'd by any Comparison.—</P>
<P>Well, but <HI>Tommy</HI> says, my Fame was de∣sign'd on his Ruin; to prove it, he'll give an Account of his Behaviour to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, since his Arrival in this Kingdom—very pretty Reasoning this, truly! <HI>How was your Behaviour to prove my Design</HI>?—Prithee, Boy, go to School again; learn to make
<PB N="$$" REF="52" MS="y"/>
Themes, and to mend your Manners.— Well, to proceed, <HI>Tommy</HI> will ask Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> a few Questions, which have no Ana∣logy, nor are at all apposite to any Question Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> has made <HI>Tommy</HI>; no, Sophister <HI>Tommy</HI> can't answer 'em—Very well, Child, go on, I'll answer your Questions. They are as follow.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. Is he (Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>) not conscious, that had it not been for me, he could not have set his Foot an any Stage in this King∣dom?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. How could I be conscious, I could not, without your Assistance, set my Foot on any Stage here, after you had by Letter of Compliment, invited me to one The∣atre? and Mr. DESBRISAY, and other Gen∣tlemen (Men of Worth and Honour) had, by Message, and Letter of Attorney granted to Mr. SWAN (who came to <HI>England</HI> on purpose) invited me to the other? Needs there more be said to this.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. Did I not quash a Cartel, which was signed by the Managers of both Compa∣nies, under severe Penalties, to exclude him from acting on either Stage?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 2. How came <HI>your Power</HI> to quash a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This <HI>Cartel</HI> was idly design'd to exclude all <HI>English</HI> Actors from the Theatres here.</NOTE> Cartel? Or, <HI>who had a Right to make such a Cartel?</HI> That Mr. <HI>Swan</HI> (he is absent, therefore to be treated tenderly) drew one is certain; that some injudicious People sign'd
<PB N="$$" REF="53" MS="y"/>
it, I believe: But still, <HI>Aungier-street</HI> was open to receive me—the same Terms proffer'd me,—nay, would I have engag'd alone, double the Terms, which I am now to get when I can. But, Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s parti∣cular Application, and Perswasions, have drawn me into an Agreement I have but too much Reason to repent.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 3. Did I not, as a Stranger, treat him with all Civility, tho' the unhappy Cha∣racter he labour'd under, prevented my ha∣ving any Friendship with him?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 3. And so, thou, condescending Creature, didst treat me with all Civility. And, pray, why should not you?—or could you suppose, you would not hear of it, whenever you behav'd otherwise? I think you have, and I believe you will still:— Oh! but my unhappy Character prevented your having any particular Friendship with me; I shall always think it a happy Part of Character, not to have been too far inveigled by you; and a Happiness in my Circumstan∣ces, that you have given me timely Warning, not to enter into any Intimacy, into which my Good-natur'd Credulity, and your wheed∣ling Cunning, might have betray'd me: I have suffered too much already, 'tis well known, by such Caitiffs.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 4. Was I not a principal Means of preventing the Trial between Mr. <HI>Sloper</HI> and him, and the Letters which passed between him and his Wife, from being reprinted here
<PB N="$$" REF="54" MS="y"/>
soon after his Arrival: And did not I com∣mission a Friend to offer the Expence of the Impression, out of my own Pocket, rather than a Stranger should be hurt?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 4. You say, but we have only your bare Word for it, (which is now in no great Estimation) you prevented the Trial between <HI>Sloper</HI> and me, being printed; I don't know you did, nor do I believe you did; and I am sure, I don't care whether it's printed or no: Time, Truth, and undeniable Facts, have open'd the Eyes of Mankind, so much, in my Behalf, on account of that unhappy Af∣fair, that I have no farther Anxiety about it, nor dread any Imputation on my Honour, or Honesty thereby.—As to the Letters, between me, and my Wife, whenever they are read, all sensible impartial Readers will readily al∣low me to be, tho' a weak, and unfortunate Man, a hurt Lover, an injur'd Husband, and a Friend betray'd.—But, how dare you, thou unspeakable Wretch, mention my Wife,—or what would thou intimate? I defy my direst Enemy, who dares speak Truth, to say, that aught ever happened be∣tween us, but what, too fatally, has prov'd me to be
<Q>"One, who lov'd not wisely, but too well!</Q></P>
<P>As to Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI>, I shall only at present say of her, the Amendment of her Conduct, joined to her Merits as an Actress, having gained her the Good-will of many, and re∣stor'd her to the charitable Thoughts of a
<PB N="$$" REF="55" MS="y"/>
kind World, I will scorn (tho' wounded in the deepest Manner Human Nature can feel) ever to use any low Invectives against a Woman, or to obstruct her future Quiet, or her Hap∣piness, unless (and, I hope, there will be no Occasion) some future Cause should call upon my Honour, as a Husband, to put that Power in Force, which my Humanity would be shock'd to be driven to the Necessity of exe∣cuting.—But say, thou unnatural Thing of Nothing, unknowing (as your nearest Friends aver) either of the Joys, or Pains of Love, thou hateful Stranger to the Ties of Kindred, or real Joy of Social Friendship, what, but the most rancorous Heart of the <HI>most base, infa∣mous Villain, and notorious Poltroon</HI>, could have drawn this disgraceful Paragraph, from the Gall of thy invidious Pen? Those Epithets I many Times have us'd in most publick Places, in publick Print, or <HI>viva voce</HI>, and ever shall, join'd to the Name of <HI>Sloper:</HI> Nor will the Name of <HI>Thomas Sheridan</HI>, henceforward, be ever mention'd by me, but the same Epithets will be heard or understood. That a Gen∣tleman of Honour, in this City, did prevent the Re-publishing of the abovemention'd Letters, I have reason to believe, and must think it design'd as an Act of Good-nature in him, as not willing either should be hurt:— But your stopping 'em I know nothing of, any more than I do of the Obligations, you would intimate, I have to you, unless you mean it an Obligation,—that I have acci∣dently
<PB N="$$" REF="56" MS="y"/>
done you the Favour to dine with you, when I might have passed my time more agreeably in better Company.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 5. Did I not promise him, to study any new Character, for his second Benefit? A Favour which I had refused to others, much more worthy of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> You did promise to study a Part for my Benefit, tho' I did not want you to do it; but you since said you'd play no more; and if you have refused that mountainous Favour, as your own vain Imagination paints it, to wor∣thier Persons, I think, as every one will, you were very much to blame.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 6. Did I not, when I found Mr. <HI>Phi∣lips</HI> trifling with, and refusing to perform the Contract, before his Face declare, that I ne∣ver would in any Shape be concern'd with Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> hereafter, if he did not pay him, nay more, offered to play with Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> in the other House; to try by that means to make up his Loss?</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 7. Did not Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> say on that Occasion, that I behav'd with such Honour, and laid him under such Obligations, that he only wish'd for an Opportunity to return them?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 6. <HI>and</HI> 7. When <HI>Philips</HI> trifled, and behaved ill enough (as he knows not how to behave well) you did talk of being concern'd no more with <HI>Philips</HI>, and of playing with me in another House (which you thought it would be your Interest to do) I made you several
<PB N="$$" REF="57" MS="y"/>
Compliments on that Account, which, on Reflection, were more than you deserv'd, for a Proposition you had no Right to make; since you were then actually engaged with <HI>Philips</HI>, in Articles for some time, so could not keep your Word. And whenever you play, the Players too well know how much your own Interest will be considered, before the Welfare of any one Person, or the Interest of the whole Body.</P>
<P>May one not reasonably suggest, you rather chose to play with me, that my Good-na∣ture, or Good-manners (call it Indolence if you will) might decline any Part you wish'd? And if the all-sufficient <HI>Tommy</HI> held my playing in Tragedy so cheap, whence all these uneasy Cautions of his, against my playing in that Light? Or his Endeavours, before I appeared in the Kingdom, to imprint in the Minds of some People (these Things can be prov'd, <HI>Tom∣my</HI>) my Incapacity for such Performance? Or whence his present Anger avow'd against any Attempts of mine of that sort? Indeed, Child, your Heart betrays you here; it outruns your Cunning. And so, your Name brought full Houses, when we play'd to empty Benches; indeed, Youth, you should remember the old Saying, <HI>Fibbers should have good Memories:</HI> Not one full House have I seen you play to, since I came—The first Time I ever saw you on the Stage, was in the Play of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>, when the Curiosity of seeing your Bro∣ther in <HI>Cassius</HI>, was what the Managers de∣pended
<PB N="$$" REF="58" MS="y"/>
on for bringing the Audience: I was told there was then about 50<HI>l.</HI>—You play'd <HI>Lord Townly</HI>, for a Widow's Benefit, to about 20<HI>l. Hamlet</HI> I believe to less, tho' for a Benefit too: <HI>Richard</HI> to less than 30<HI>l.</HI> and caus'd a∣bout 15<HI>l</HI>'s worth of Tickets to be given away to puff for you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The best Receipt you had was to <HI>Cato</HI>, which I have mentioned; and the first Night of your appearing in the Character of <HI>Horatio</HI> in the <HI>Fair Penitent</HI>, was worse than any of these; and, I believe, the very worst Audience they have known a long while —Why, you're bewitch'd sure;
<Q>"Sed, quos Jupiter vult perdere, prius de∣mentat."</Q></P>
<P>That you have disoblig'd an Audience, by not performing, more than once, that you have created Disturbances more than once, the whole Town knows: But, that you were always under the Necessity of so doing, no∣thing but the Nonsense of thy own peerless Pericranium, could ever persuade you to assert: —Can any one in their Senses, suppose I could undertake so wild a Project, as to at∣tempt driving you out of a Kingdom, you were born in, and in which you had, as you often boasted, such a strong natural Interest? Or why, were I to stay, or ever to return, must my Establishment be grounded on your Removal? Upon my Word, incomparable Sir, I cannot pay you so great a Compliment as to think that necessary: Nor do I think, thou egregious <HI>Mock Monarch</HI>, like thee, of
<PB N="$$" REF="59" MS="y"/>
<HI>monopolizing Kingdoms</HI>; or, as you in your Letter to Mr. <HI>G—k</HI>, ridiculously enough phras'd it, of <HI>dividing 'em</HI>; or that, <HI>we are to be</HI> (as you farther said to him) <HI>The Twin Stars of Heaven</HI>, &amp;c. and such like Trash; which his better Sense, as I am credibly in∣form'd, smiled at. But I suppose the Town here are to dread your threatning to depart, and join in a Petition for your Stay; should you, cruel Man, leave this weeping Nation, to deplore your Absence for a while; I'll ven∣ture to affirm, your return will be pretty quick. Unless you can persuade every body in <HI>England</HI> to hold every Performer, as low in their Opinion, as you do, when comparing them to your inimitable self—All Men have some degree of Vanity, without it there would be but little Emulation: But your's is so bare-faced, so stupidly apparent, a School-boy would act with more Discretion:—How∣ever cordially partial you may be, to your dainty, delicate self, I shall not forfeit my Understanding so much, ever to Hint, you have the least Right to stand in any Degree of Comparison, with Mr. <HI>Quin</HI>, or Mr. <HI>Gar∣rick</HI>, (whatever your critical Noddle may be pleased to alledge) or with many more there, or some here, who, in their different Walks, will always be your Superiors.</P>
<P>As an Actor, (tho' I have more to say to you as a Man) I shall yet, leave you for a while, this Answer already swelling to a large Size: But shall take a speedy Opportu∣nity,
<PB N="$$" REF="60" MS="y"/>
of shewing you, impartially, what you are, and what you are not: When, probably, the judging World will take their farewell of thee, with this Parody.</P>
<Q><L>"Thou art but a stalking Shadow, a poor, poor Player!</L>
<L>"Who hast strutted, and fretted, thy Hour upon the Stage,</L>
<L>"And now —Thou'rt heard no more!</L>
<L>'Twas a Tale,</L>
<L>"Told by an Ideot, full of Sound and Fury,</L>
<L>"Signifying—Nothing.</L></Q>
<P>'Twere endless to trace you through your repeated Falshoods, or to take Notice of all your <HI>Sheridanian</HI> Rhetorick, Numbers can confront you, as to the first; and as to the latter, 'tis fit only to be laughed at.—But, out of thy own Mouth will I condemn thee, wicked Scribler! You say yourself, <HI>Page</HI> 9<HI>th</HI>,
<Q>“The Audience was greatly offended at the Disappointment they met with, <HI>in your not being able to perform,</HI> and very justly too; since it was not in your power to give them ”the Reasons which prevented it.</Q>
—No, nor ever was, nor ever will be—Now, if <HI>Tommy</HI> will but correct it boldly, and instead of, <HI>not being able to perform</HI>, read thus, <HI>not willing to perform</HI>; why then the Fact will be truly stated, I believe.</P>
<P>You say being equally skill'd in theatrical Affairs, as you are in Laws of Hospitality and Good-Breeding.—
<Q>“The giving out three ”Plays together is a most unusual thing.</Q>—
<PB N="$$" REF="61" MS="y"/>
No, <HI>Tommy</HI>, it has been frequently done in <HI>England</HI>, where the Theatres are somewhat better conducted than here, (or they would be in a woeful Plight) and the Company, on such Occasions, have been greatly serv'd thereby. Oh! but some of the <HI>Characters</HI> were <HI>yours</HI>. Pray, <HI>who</HI> are <HI>you?</HI> What do you mean, that they fitted you in private Life? I'll readily al∣low you all the Virtues you can find cram'd into <HI>Richard</HI> or <HI>Macbeth</HI>, their Valour and their Policy excepted; (little Cunning that betrays itself is no Policy) but, the Pangs and Pleasures of <HI>Othello</HI>, sure, you don't pretend to have known—Oh! But you mean, they were your Parts, and pray, why the Property of you particularly, any more than of many others, who have acted them before you, and 'tis possible do not play them worse.— But, you would not play, and nobody else must—Pert enough that!</P>
<P>You say, what Right had I to answer your first Address to the Town?—Why Child, I never did answer it. My Epistle was ready for the Press, before I ever saw your Paper, as a Gentleman can testify, who brought it to me, just as I was going to send away my Letter: 'Twas your idle Reports, which Numbers have known you guilty of, and the two ill-natur'd Advertisements (which no one believes you innocent of) calculated to create a Disturbance, and the silly threatning Papers posted up about the Town: All these made me think it necessary to break Silence.</P>
<P><PB N="$$" REF="62" MS="y"/>Your Nonsense, in saying I keep every Theatre in hot Water, is very pretty, to be sure, if you did but know what you meant; but, as to my troublesome Temper, there is not, I believe, a Player that will not contra∣dict you.—I am confident, there's none of the Profession, here, that will find Fault with my Want of Manners, Good-nature, or Good-Humour: But is there any of 'em, that have not laugh'd at your ridiculous Ty∣ranny, or been astonish'd at your ill Usage, even of the Women?—But, they should excuse you there, <HI>Tommy:</HI> How can you tell properly to treat a Sex, every Body believes you're scarce acquainted with.—And so,
<Q>“you cannot find out any tolerable Colour I had, to be so cavalier a Volunteer, in the ”Cause.</Q>
—Really, too many publick and private Libels, (all which I'll collect and present the Town with soon) press'd me to the Service.—But, 'tis no Matter whether you can find the Cause or no, if the Publick finds it, and if they are pleas'd—Must I be frighten'd 'cause a <HI>Spalpeen</HI> stares? As to your pretty Compliment to your Friends, by calling their Zeal indiscreet, that Blunder needs no Remark—and to say, I know∣ingly, and willingly, brought the Anger of any Set of People upon me, is an Assertion so absurd, nothing can equal the Folly of it, but the Falshood. —'Tis a pretty plum Contradiction to the forc'd Compliment you make, when you are pleas'd to allow me a
<PB N="$$" REF="63" MS="y"/>
Man of common Sense: But your Effronterie in denying all Knowledge of the Advertisements, or having even the least Knowledge of the Gen∣tlemen, whom you pretend were angry on your Account—tho' living Witnesses have prov'd, and will farther, your being deeply concern'd in publishing the first, and were daily and hourly in Company with the latter, as you confess in your own Libel, is matchless <HI>in∣deed</HI>.—Such glaring Contradictions prove, you thought your Readers must be as silly as yourself, and would over-look 'em.</P>
<P>'Tis notorious, the College resenting the Freedom of the Printers, in publishing Pa∣pers as coming from them, which they dis∣claim, have on Enquiry found, SHERIDAN <HI>brought 'em</HI>, SHERIDAN <HI>set 'em on</HI>. For this Truth, let any one appeal to Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI>, Mr. <HI>Exshaw</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Reilly</HI>, and their Servants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> You talk of a Message you sent me by Mr. <HI>Wright</HI>, of your having endeavour'd to appease the Anger of your Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> You took care to send the Message late enough; for I received none, till within half an Hour, or thereabouts, of my Letters being cry'd about the Streets.—But I no more believe your Sincerity in this, than I do in every thing else.—The Impatience of those itinerant Gentry, the Flyings Stationers, being great, I must hasten to a Conclusion.
