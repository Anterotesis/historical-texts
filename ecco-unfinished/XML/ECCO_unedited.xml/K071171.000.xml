<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Volume contains a complete Collection of the
poems of the late Dr. Akenside, either reprinted
from the original Editions, or faithfully published from
Copies which had been prepared by himself for publication.</P>
<P>That the principal Poem should appear in so disadvanta∣geous
a state, may require some explanation. The first pub∣lication
of it was at a very early part of the Author's
life. That it wanted Revision and Correction, he was
sufficiently sensible; but so quick was the demand for se∣veral
successive republications, that in any of the intervals
to have completed the whole of his Corrections was utterly
impossible; and yet to have gone on from time to time
making farther Improvements in every new Edition would
(he thought) have had the appearance at least of abusing
the favor of the Public. He chose therefore to continue for
some time reprinting it without alteration, and to forbear
publishing any Corrections or Improvements until he should
be able at once to give them to the Public complete. And
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
with this view, he went on for several years to review and
correct the Poem at his leisure; till at length he found the
task grow so much upon his hands, that, despairing of ever
being able to execute it sufficiently to his own satisfaction,
he abandoned the purpose of correcting, and resolved to
write the Poem over anew upon a somewhat different
and an enlarged Plan. And in the execution of this Design
he had made a considerable Progress. What Reason there may
be to regret that he did not live to execute the whole of it,
will best appear from the perusal of the Plan itself, as stated
in the General Argument, and of the Parts which he had
executed, and which are here published. For the Person, to
whom he intrusted the Disposal of his Papers, would have
thought himself wanting, as well to the Service of the Public, as
to the Fame of his Friend, if he had not produced as much
of the Work as appeared to have been prepared for publication.
In this light he considered the intire first and second Books,
of which a few Copies had been printed for the use only of the
Author and certain Friends: also a very considerable part
of the third Book, which had been transcribed in order to
its being printed in the same manner: and to these is added
the Introduction to a subsequent Book, which in the Manu∣script
is called the Fourth, and which appears to have been
composed at the time when the Author intended to comprize
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
the whole in Four Books; but which, as he had afterwards
determined to distribute the Poem into more Books, might
perhaps more properly be called the Last Book. And this
is all that is executed of the new work, which although it
appeared to the Editor too valuable, even in its imperfect
State, to be withholden from the Public, yet (he conceives)
takes in by much too small a part of the original Poem to
supply its place, and to supersede the re-publication of it.
For which reason both the Poems are inserted in this col∣lection.</P>
<P>Of Odes the Author had designed to make up Two Books,
consisting of twenty Odes each, including the several Odes.
which he had before published at different times.</P>
<P>The Hymn to the Naiads is reprinted from the sixth Volume
of Dodsley's Miscellanies, with a few Corrections and the
addition of some Notes. To the Inscriptions taken from
the same Volume three new Inscriptions are added; the last
of which is the only instance wherein a liberty has been
taken of inserting any thing in this Collection, which did not
appear to have been intended by the Author for publication;
among whose papers no Copy of this was found, but it is
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
printed from a Copy which he had many years since given to.
the Editor.</P>
<P>The Author of these Poems was born at Newcastle upon
Tyne, on the 9th Day of November 1721. He was edu∣cated
at the Grammar School at Newcastle, and at the
Universities of Edinburgh and Leyden, at the latter of which
he took his Degree of Doctor in Physic. He was afterwards
admitted by Mandamus to the Degree of Doctor in Physic
in the University of Cambridge: elected a Fellow of the
Royal College of Physicians, and one of the Physicians
of St. Thomas's Hospital: and upon the Establishment of
the Queen's Household, appointed one of the Physicians
to Her Majesty. He died of a putrid Fever, on the 23d
Day of June 1770, and is buried in the Parish Church of St.
James, Westminster.</P>

<HEAD>THE
DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold
a middle place between the organs of bodily sense and the facul∣ties
of moral perception: They have been called by a very general
name, <HI>The Powers of Imagination.</HI> Like the external senses, they re∣late
to matter and motion; and, at the same time, give the mind ideas
analogous to those of moral approbation and dislike. As they are the
inlets of some of the most exquisite pleasures with which we are ac∣quainted,
it has naturally happened that men of warm and sensible tem∣pers
have sought means to recall the delightful perceptions which they
afford, independent of the objects which originally produced them.
This gave rise to the imitative or designing arts; some of which, as
painting and sculpture, directly copy the external appearances which
were admired in nature; others, as music and poetry, bring them back
to remembrance by signs universally established and understood.</P>
<P>But these arts, as they grew more correct and deliberate, were of
course led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the
imaginative powers; especially poetry, which, making use of language
as the instrument by which it imitates, is consequently become an un∣limited
representative of every species and mode of being. Yet as
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
their intention was only to express the objects of imagination, and as
they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class, they of course retain
their original character; and all the different pleasures which they ex∣cite,
are termed, in general, <HI>Pleasures of Imagination.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The design of the following poem is to give a view of</HI> these <HI>in the
largest acceptation of the term;</HI> so that whatever our imagination feels
from the agreeable appearances of nature, and all the various entertainment
we meet with either in poetry, painting, music, or any of the elegant arts,
might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the constitution of
the human mind, which are here established and explained.</P>
<P>In executing this general plan, it was necessary first of all to distin∣guish
the Imagination from our other faculties; and in the next place
to characterize those original forms or properties of being, about which
it is conversant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light is to
the eyes, or truth to the understanding. These properties Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>
had reduced to the three general classes of greatness, novelty, and beau∣ty;
and into these we may analyse every object, however complex, which,
properly speaking, is delightful to the imagination. But such an object
may also include many other sources of pleasure; and its beauty, or no∣velty,
or grandeur, will make a stronger impression by reason of this
concurrence. Besides which, the imitative arts, especially poetry, owe
much of their effect to a <HI>similar</HI> exhibition of properties quite <HI>foreign</HI>
to the imagination, insomuch that in every line of the most applauded
poems, we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses, or
truths discovered to the understanding, or illustrations of contrivance
and final causes, or, above all the rest, with circumstances proper to
awaken and ingage the passions. It was therefore necessary to enume∣rate
and exemplify these different species of pleasure; especially that
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
from the passions, which, as it is supreme in the noblest work of human
genius, so being in some particulars not a little surprizing, gave an op∣portunity
to enliven the didactic turn of the poem, by introducing an
allegory to account, for the appearance.</P>
<P>After these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration, or
naturally warm and interest the mind▪ a pleasure of a very different
nature, that which arises from ridicule, came next to be considered. As
this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts, and has been
but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was thought proper to
give it a particular illustration, and to distinguish the general sources
from which the ridicule of characters is derived. Here too a change of
stile became necessary; such a one as might yet be consistent, if possible,
with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject:
nor is it an easy talk to give any tolerable force to images of this kind,
without running either into the gigantic expressions of the mock heroic,
or the familiar and poetical raillery of professed satire; neither of which
would have been proper here.</P>
<P>The materials of all imitation being thus laid open, nothing now re∣mained
but to illustrate some particular pleasures which arise either from
the relations of different objects one to another, or from the nature of
imitation itself. Of the first kind is that various and complicated re∣semblance
existing between several parts of the material and immaterial
worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it seems in
a great measure to depend on the early association of our ideas, and as
this habit of associating is the source of many pleasures and pains in life,
and on that account boars a great share in the influence of poetry and
the other arts, it is therefore mentioned here and its effects described.
Then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts,
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
and of the secondary pleasure, as it is called, arising from the resem∣blance
of their imitations to the original appearances of nature. After
which, the work concludes with some reflexions on the general conduct
of the powers of imagination, and on their natural and moral usefulness
in life.</P>
<P>Concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this
piece, little can be said with propriety by the author. He had two mo∣dels;
that antient and simple one of the first <HI>Graecian</HI> poets, as it is re∣fined
by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the <HI>Georgics,</HI> and the familiar epistolary way of <HI>Ho∣race.</HI>
This latter has several advantages. It admits of a greater variety
of stile; it more readily ingages the generality of readers, as partaking
more of the air of conversation; and, especially with the assistance of
rhyme, leads to a closer and more concise expression. Add to this the
example of the most perfect of modern poets, who has so happily ap∣plied
this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy, that the public
taste is in a great measure formed to it alone. Yet, after all, the subject
before us, tending almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm,
seemed rather to demand a more open, pathetic and figured stile. This
too appeared more natural, as the author's aim was not so much to give
formal precepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as, by
exhibiting the most ingaging prospects of nature, to enlarge and har∣monize
the imagination, and by that means insensibly dispose the minds
of men to a similar taste and habit of thinking in religion, morals, and
civil life. 'Tis on this account that he is so careful to point out the
benevolent intention of the Author of nature in every principle of the
human constitution here insisted on; and also to unite the moral excel∣lencies
of life in the same point of view with the meer external objects
of good taste; thus recommending them in common to our natural pro∣pensity
for admiring what is beautiful and lovely. The same views
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
have also led him to introduce some sentiments which may perhaps be
looked upon as not quite direct to the subject; but, since they bear
an obvious relation to it, the authority of <HI>Virgil,</HI> the faultless model
of didactic poetry, will best support him in this particular. For the
sentiments themselves, he makes no apology.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT
OF
THE FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<Q>THE subject proposed. Difficulty of treating it poetically.
The ideas of the divine mind, the origin of every quality
pleasing to the imagination. The natural variety of consti∣tution
in the minds of men; with its final cause. The idea
of a fine imagination, and the state of the mind in the en∣joyment
of those pleasures which it affords. All the primary
pleasures of the imagination result from the perception of
greatness, or wonderfulness, or beauty in objects. The plea∣sure
from greatness, with its final cause. Pleasure from
novelty or wonderfulness, with its final cause. Pleasure from
beauty, with its final cause. The connexion of beauty with
truth and good, applied to the conduct of life. Invitation to
the study of moral philosophy. The different degrees of
beauty in different species of objects: colour; shape; na∣tural
concretes; vegetables; animals; the mind. The sub∣lime,
the fair, the wonderful of the mind. The connexion
of the imagination and the moral faculty. Conclusion.</Q>

<L>Oft have the laws of each poetic strain</L>

High as the summit; there to breathe at large</L>
<L>Aethereal air: with bards and sages old,</L>
<L>Immortal sons of praise. These flattering scenes</L>
<L>To this neglected labour court my song;</L>
<L>Yet not unconscious what a doubtful task</L>
<L>To paint the finest features of the mind,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>And to most subtile and mysterious things</L>
<L>Give colour, strength, and motion. But the love</L>

<LG>
<L>From heaven my strains begin; from heaven descends</L>
<L>The flame of genius to the human breast,</L>
<L>And love and beauty, and poetic joy</L>
<L>And inspiration. Ere the radiant sun</L>
<L>Sprang from the east, or 'mid the vault of night<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>The moon suspended her serener lamp;</L>
<L>Ere mountains, woods, or streams adorn'd the globe,</L>

The forms eternal of created things;</L>
<L>The radiant sun, the moon's nocturnal lamp,</L>

<L>But not alike to every mortal eye</L>
<L>Is this great scene unveil'd. For since the claims.<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>Of social life, to different labours urge</L>

<L>The hand of nature on peculiar minds</L>

And will's quick impulse: others by the hand</L>

<L>What healing virtue swells the tender veins</L>
<L>Of herbs and flowers; or what the beams of morn</L>
<L>Draw forth, distilling from the clifted rind<MILESTONE N="95"/></L>

<L>Blooming with rosy smiles, they see portray'd<MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>That uncreated beauty, which delights</L>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT
OF
THE SECOND BOOK.</HEAD>
<Q>THE separation of the works of imagination from philo∣sophy,
the cause of their abuse among the moderns. Prospect
of their re-union under the influence of public liberty. Enu∣meration
of accidental pleasures, which increase the effect of
objects delightful to the imagination. The pleasures of sense.
Particular circumstances of the mind. Discovery of truth.
Perception of contrivance and design. Emotion of the pas∣sions.
All the natural passions partake of a pleasing sensa∣tion;
with the final cause of this constitution illustrated by an
allegorical vision, and exemplified in sorrow, pity, terror, and
indignation.</Q>

<L>Breaks the reluctant shades of Gothic night</L>
<L>Which yet involve the nations! Long they groan'd</L>

The fordid hours: while foul, barbarian hands</L>
<L>Their mysteries profan'd, unstrung the lyre,</L>

<L>Of penetrating science to the cells,</L>
<L>Where studious ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e consumes the silent hour</L>
<L>In shadowy searches and unfruitful care.</L>
<L>Thus from their guardians torn, the tender arts<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Of mimic fancy and harmonious joy,</L>
<L>To priestly domination and the lust</L>
<L>Of lawless courts, their amiable toil</L>
<L>For three inglorious ages have resign'd,</L>

<L>The muses and the graces. Then no more</L>
<L>Shall vice, distracting their delicious gifts</L>
<L>To aims abhorr'd, with high distaste and scorn</L>
<L>Turn from their charms the philosophic eye,</L>
<L>The patriot-bosom; then no more the paths<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>

<L>Arm'd with the lyre, already have we dar'd</L>

Impends; now urging our ambitious toil,</L>
<L>We hasten to recount the various springs</L>
<L>Of adventitious pleasure, which adjoin<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>Their grateful influence to the prime effect</L>
<L>Of objects grand or beauteous, and inlarge</L>
<L>The complicated joy. The sweets of sense,</L>

<L>To raise harmonious fancy's native charm?<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>So while we taste the fragrance of the rose,</L>

<L>A moment's disposition to rejoice</L>
<L>In those delights which at a different hour</L>

<L>Round whom the bed of sickness long diffus'd</L>

<L>Or shall i mention, where coelestial truth</L>

<L>More welcome touch his understanding's eye,</L>

<L>To me have shone so pleasing, as when first<MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>The hand of science pointed out the path</L>
<L>In which the sun-beams gleaming from the west</L>
<L>Fall on the watry cloud, whose darksome veil</L>
<L>Involves the orient; and that trickling shower</L>

<L>Recoil at length where concave all behind</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or shall we touch that kind access of joy,</L>
<L>That springs to each fair object, while we trace</L>
<L>Through all its fabric, wisdom's artful aim</L>
<L>Disposing every part, and gaining still</L>
<L>By means proportion'd her benignant end?<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>Speak, ye, the pure delight, whose favour'd steps</L>
<L>The lamp of science through the jealous maze</L>

<L>What, when to raise the meditated scene,</L>

<L>What? like a storm from their capacious bed</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="50"/>
The sounding seas o'erwhelming, when the might</L>

<L>Of man's strong apprehension, shakes his frame</L>
<L>Even to the base; from every naked sense<MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
<L>Of pain or pleasure dissipating all</L>
<L>Opinion's feeble coverings, and the veil</L>
<L>Spun from the cobweb fashion of the times</L>
<L>To hide the feeling heart? Then nature speaks</L>
<L>Her genuine language, and the words of men,<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>Big with the very motion of their souls,</L>
<L>Declare with what accumulated force,</L>
<L>The impetuous nerve of passion urges on</L>
<L>The native weight and energy of things.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet more: her honours where nor beauty claims,<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>Nor shews of good the thirsty sense allure,</L>
<L>From passion's power alone our nature holds</L>
<L>Essential pleasure. Passion's fierce illapse</L>
<L>Rouzes the mind's whole fabric; with supplies</L>
<L>Of daily impulse keeps the elastic powers</L>
<L>Intensely poiz'd, and polishes anew<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>By that collision all the fine machine:</L>
<L>Else rust would rise, and foulness, by degrees</L>
<L>Incumbering, choak at last what heaven design'd</L>
<L>For ceaseless motion and a round of toil.<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>—But say, does every passion thus to man</L>

Administer delight? That name indeed</L>

<L>WHAT wonder, therefore, since the indearing ties</L>
<L>Of passion link the universal kind</L>
<L>Of man so close, what wonder if to search</L>
<L>This common nature through the various change</L>
<L>Of sex, and age, and fortune, and the frame<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>

<L>As man to man. Nor only where the smiles</L>
<L>Of love invite; nor only where the applause</L>
<L>Of cordial honour turns the attentive eye</L>
<L>On virtue's graceful deeds. For since the course</L>
<L>Of things external acts in different ways<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="79"/>
On human apprehensions, as the hand</L>
<L>Of nature temper'd to a different frame</L>
<L>Peculiar minds; so haply where the powers</L>
<L>Of fancy neither lessen nor enlarge</L>
<L>The images of things, but paint in all<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Their genuine hues, the features which they wore</L>
<L>In nature; there opinion will be true,</L>
<L>And action right. For action treads the path</L>
<L>In which opinion says he follows good,</L>
<L>Or flies from evil; and opinion gives<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Report of good or evil, as the scene</L>
<L>Was drawn by fancy, lovely or deform'd:</L>
<L>Thus her report can never there be true</L>
<L>Where fancy cheats the intellectual eye,</L>
<L>With glaring colours and distorted lines.<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Is there a man, who at the sound of death</L>
<L>Sees ghastly shapes of terror conjur'd up,</L>
<L>And black before him; nought but death-bed groans</L>
<L>And fearful prayers, and plunging from the brink</L>
<L>Of light and being, down the gloomy air,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>An unknown depth? Alas! in such a mind,</L>
<L>If no bright forms of excellence attend</L>
<L>The image of his country; nor the pomp</L>
<L>Of sacred senates, nor the guardian voice</L>
<L>Of justice on her throne, nor aught that wakes<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>The conscious bosom with a patriot's flame;</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="80"/>
Will not opinion tell him, that to die,</L>
<L>Or stand the hazard, is a greater ill</L>
<L>Than to betray his country? And in act</L>
<L>Will he not chuse to be a wretch and live?<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>Here vice begins then. From the inchanting cup</L>
<L>Which fancy holds to all, the unwary thirst</L>
<L>Of youth oft swallows a Circaean draught,</L>
<L>That sheds a baleful tincture o'er the eye</L>
<L>Of reason, till no longer he discerns,<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>And only guides to err. Then revel forth</L>
<L>A furious band that spurn him from the throne;</L>
<L>And all is uproar. Thus ambition grasps</L>
<L>The empire of the soul: thus pale revenge</L>
<L>Unsheaths her murderous dagger; and the hands<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>Of lust and rapine, with unholy arts,</L>
<L>Watch to o'erturn the barrier of the laws</L>
<L>That keeps them from their prey: thus all the plagues</L>
<L>The wicked bear, or o'er the trembling scene</L>
<L>The tragic muse discloses, under shapes<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>Of honour, safety, pleasure, ease or pomp,</L>
<L>Stole first into the mind. Yet not by all</L>
<L>Those lying forms which fancy in the brain</L>
<L>Engenders, are the kindling passions driven,</L>
<L>To guilty deeds; nor reason bound in chains,<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>That vice alone may lord it: oft adorn'd</L>
<L>With solemn pageants, folly mounts the throne,</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="81"/>
And plays her idiot-anticks, like a queen.</L>
<L>A thousand garbs she wears; a thousand ways</L>
<L>She wheels her giddy empire.—Lo! thus far<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>With bold adventure, to the Mantuan lyre</L>
<L>I sing of nature's charms, and touch well-pleas'd</L>
<L>A stricter note: now haply must my song</L>
<L>Unbend her serious measure, and reveal</L>
<L>In lighter strains, how folly's aukward arts<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>Excite impetuous laughter's gay rebuke;</L>
<L>The sportive province of the comic muse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See! in what crouds the uncouth forms advance:</L>
<L>Each would outstrip the other, each prevent</L>
<L>Our careful search, and offer to your gaze,<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>Unask'd, his motley features. Wait awhile,</L>
<L>My curious friends! and let us first arrange</L>
<L>In proper order your promiscuous throng.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold the foremost band; of slender thought,</L>
<L>And easy faith; whom flattering fancy sooths<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>With lying spectres, in themselves to view</L>
<L>Illustrious forms of excellence and good,</L>
<L>That scorn the mansion. With exulting hearts</L>
<L>They spread their spurious treasures to the sun,</L>
<L>And bid the world admire! but chief the glance<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>Of wishful envy draws their joy-bright eyes,</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="82"/>
And lists with self-applause each lordly brow.</L>
<L>In number boundless as the blooms of spring,</L>
<L>Behold their glaring idols, empty shades</L>
<L>By fancy gilded o'er, and the set up<MILESTONE N="95"/></L>
<L>For adoration. Some in learning's grab,</L>
<L>With formal band, and sable-cinctur'd gown,</L>
<L>And rags of mouldy volumes. Some elate</L>
<L>With martial splendor, steely pikes and swords</L>
<L>Of costly frame, and gay Phoenician robes<MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>Inwrought with flowery gold, assume the port</L>
<L>Of stately valour: listening by his side</L>
<L>There stands a female form; to her, with looks</L>
<L>Of earnest import, pregnant with amaze,</L>
<L>He talks of deadly deeds, of breaches, stroms,<MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>And sulphurous mines, and ambush: then at once</L>
<L>Breaks off, and smiles to see her look so pale,</L>
<L>And asks some wondering question of her fears.</L>
<L>Others of graver mien; behold, adorn'd</L>
<L>With holy ensigns, how sublime they move,<MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>And bending oft their sancti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onious eyes</L>
<L>Take homage of the simple-minded throng;</L>
<L>Ambassadors of heaven! Nor much unlike</L>
<L>Is he whose visage, in the lazy mist</L>
<L>That mantles every feature, hides a brood<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>Of politic conceits; of whispers, nods,</L>
<L>And hints deep omen'd with unwieldy schemes,</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="83"/>
And dark portents of state. Ten thousand more,</L>
<L>Prodigious habits and tumultuous tongues,</L>
<L>Pour dauntless in and swell the boastful band.</L>
<MILESTONE N="120"/>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then comes the second order; all who seek</L>
<L>The debt of praise, where watchful unbelief</L>
<L>Darts through the thin pretence her squinting eye</L>
<L>On some retir'd appearance which belies</L>
<L>The boasted virtue, or annuls the applause<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>That justice else would pay. Here side by side</L>
<L>I see two leaders of the solemn train</L>
<L>Approaching: one a female old and grey,</L>
<L>With eyes demure, and wrinkle-furrow'd brow,</L>
<L>Pale as the cheeks of death; yet still she stuns.<MILESTONE N="130"/></L>
<L>The sickening audience with, a nauseous tale;</L>
<L>How many youths her myrtle-chains have worn,</L>
<L>How many virgins at her triumphs pin'd!</L>
<L>Yet how resolv'd she guards her cautious heart;</L>
<L>Such is her terror at the risques of love,<MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>And man's seducing tongue! The other seems</L>
<L>A bearded sage, ungentle in his mien,</L>
<L>And sordid all his habit; peevish want</L>
<L>Grins at his heels, while down the gazing throng</L>
<L>He stalks, resounding in magnific phrase<MILESTONE N="140"/></L>
<L>The vanity of riches, the contempt</L>
<L>Of pomp and power. Be prudent in your zeal,</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="84"/>
Ye grave associates! let the silent grace</L>
<L>Of her who blushes at the fond regard</L>
<L>Her charms inspire, more eloquent unfold<MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
<L>The praise of spotless honour: let the man</L>
<L>Whose eye regards not his illustrious pomp</L>
<L>And ample store, but as indulgent streams</L>
<L>To cheer the barren soil and spread the fruits</L>
<L>Of joy, let him by juster measures fix<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>The price of riches and the end of power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another tribe succeeds; deluded long</L>
<L>By fancy's dazling optics, these behold</L>
<L>The images of some peculiar things</L>
<L>With brighter hues resplendent, and portray'd<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>With features nobler far than e'er adorn'd</L>
<L>Their genuine objects. Hence the fever'd heart</L>
<L>Pants with delirious hope for tinsel charms;</L>
<L>Hence oft obtrusive on the eye of scorn,</L>
<L>Untimely zeal her witless pride betrays!<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>And serious manhood from the towering aim</L>
<L>Of wisdom, stoops to emulate the boast</L>
<L>Of childish toil. Behold yon mystic form,</L>
<L>Bedeck'd with feathers, insects, weeds and shells!</L>
<L>Not with intenser view the Samian sage<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>Bent his fixt eye on heaven's intenser fires,</L>
<L>When first the order of that radiant scene</L>

<L>A muckworm's entrails or a spider's fang.</L>
<L>Next him a youth, with flowers and myrtles crown'd,<MILESTONE N="170"/></L>
<L>Attends that virgin form, and blushing kneels,</L>
<L>With fondest gesture and a suppliant's tongue,</L>
<L>To win her coy regard: adieu, for him,</L>
<L>The dull ingagements of the bustling world!</L>
<L>Adieu the sick impertinence of praise!<MILESTONE N="175"/></L>

<HEAD>NOTES
ON THE
FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P><HI>VER.</HI> 151. Say, why was man, <HI>&amp;c.] In apologizing for the frequent negligences
of the sublimest authors of</HI> Greece, Those god-like geniuses, <HI>says</HI> Longinus, were well
assured, that Nature had not intended man for a low-spirited or ignoble being: but
bringing us into life and the midst of this wide universe, as before a multitude assem∣bled
at some heroic solemnity, that we might be spectators of all her magnificence, and
candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory; she has therefore implanted in our
souls an inextinguishable love of every thing great and exalted, of every thing which
appears divine beyond our comprehension. Whence it comes to pass, that even the whole
world is not an object sufficient for the depth and rapidity of human imagination, which
often sallies forth beyond the limits of all that surrounds us. Let any man cast his eye
through the whole circle of our existence, and consider how especially it abounds in ex∣cellent
and grand objects, he will soon acknowledge for what injoyments and pursuits
we were destined. Thus by the very propensity of nature we are led to admire, not
little springs or shallow rivulets, however clear and delicious, but the Nile, the Rhine,
the Danube, and, much more than all, the Ocean, <HI>&amp;c. Dionys. Longin. de Sublim.

qui environne toute cette region, pourra etre rempli de bonheur &amp; de gloire. Il pourra
etre conçu comme l'ocean, où se rendent les fleuves de toutes les creatures bienheureuses,
quand elles seront venues à leur perfection dans le systeme des etoiles. <HI>Leibnitz dans la
Theodicee, part. i.</HI> § 19.</P>
<P>Ver. 204. <HI>Whose unfading light,</HI> &amp;c.] It was a notion of the great Mr. <HI>Huygens,</HI>
that there may be fixed stars at such a distance from our solar system, as that their
light should not have had time to reach us, even from the creation of the world to
this day.</P>
<P>Ver. 234.—<HI>the neglect
Of all familiar prospects,</HI> &amp;c.] It is here said, that in consequence of
the love of novelty, objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind, lose
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
that effect by repeated attention to them. But the instance of <HI>habit</HI> is opposed to
this observation; for <HI>there,</HI> objects at first distasteful are in time rendered intirely
agreeable by repeated attention.</P>
<P>The difficulty in this case will be removed, if we consider, that, when objects at
first agreeable, lose that influence by frequently recurring, the mind is wholly
<HI>passive,</HI> and the perception <HI>involuntary;</HI> but habit, on the other hand, generally
supposes <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>activity</HI> accompanying it: so that the pleasure arises here not
from the object, but from the mind's <HI>conscious</HI> determination of its own activity;
and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination.</P>
<P>It will still be urged perhaps, that a familiarity with disagreeable objects renders
them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to <HI>resolve</HI>
or <HI>act</HI> at all. In this case, the appearance must be accounted for, one of these
ways.</P>
<P>The pleasure from habit may be merely negative. The object at first gave un∣easiness:
this uneasiness gradually wears off as the object grows familiar: and the
mind, finding it at last intirely removed, reckons its situation really pleasurable, com∣pared
with what it had experienced before.</P>
<P>The dislike conceived of the object at first, might be owing to prejudice or want
of attention. Consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often, may at
length perceive its own mistake, and be reconciled to what it had looked on with
aversion. In which case, a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make
amends for the injury, by running toward the other extreme of fondness and at∣tachment.</P>
<P>Or lastly, though the object itself should always continue disagreeable, yet cir∣cumstances
of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it. Thus an associ∣ation
may arise in the mind, and the object never be remembered without those
pleasing circumstances attending it; by which means the disagreeable impression
which it at first occasioned will in time be quite obliterated.</P>
<P>Ver. 240.—<HI>this desire
Of objects</HI> new <HI>and</HI> strange—] These two ideas are oft con∣founded;
though it is evident the mere <HI>novelty</HI> of an object makes it agreeable,
even where the mind is not affected with the least degree of <HI>wonder:</HI> whereas <HI>won∣der</HI>
indeed always implies <HI>novelty,</HI> being never excited by common or well-known
appearances. But the pleasure in both cases is explicable from the same final cause,
the acquisition of knowledge and inlargement of our views of nature: on this ac∣count,
it is natural to treat of them together.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 374.—Truth and good are one,
And beauty dwells in them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>] Do you imagine, <HI>says</HI> Socrates <HI>to</HI>
Aristippus, that what is good is not beautiful? Have you not observed that these ap∣pearances
always coincide? Virtue, for instance, in the same respect as to which we
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
call it good, is ever acknowledged to be beautiful also. In the characters of men we
always<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This the <HI>Athenians</HI> did in a peculiar manner, by the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> join the two denominations together. The beauty of human bodies corresponds,
in like manner, with that oeconomy of parts which constitutes them good; and in every
circumstance of life, the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good,
inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was designed. <HI>Xenophont. Memo∣rab.
Socrat. l. iii. c.</HI> 8.</P>
<P>This excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer
of ancient philosophy; <HI>see the Characteristicks,</HI> vol. ii. p. 339 and 422. and vol. iii. p. 181.
And another ingenious author has particularly shewn, that it holds in the general
laws of nature, in the works of art, and the conduct of the sciences. <HI>Inquiry into
the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue,</HI> Treat. i. § 8. As to the connection be∣tween
<HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> there are two opinions concerning it. Some philosophers
assert an independent and invariable law in nature, in consequencce of which <HI>all ra∣tional
beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions, and deformity in the
contrary.</HI> And this necessity being supposed the same with that which commands
the assent or dissent of the understanding, it follows of course that <HI>beauty</HI> is founded
on the universal and unchangeable law of <HI>truth.</HI></P>
<P>But others there are, who believe <HI>beauty</HI> to be merely a relative and arbitrary
thing; that indeed it was a benevolent provision in nature to annex so delightful a
sensation to those objects which are <HI>best and most perfect in themselves,</HI> that so we
might be ingaged to the choice of them at once and without staying to infer their
<HI>usefulness</HI> from their structure and effects; but that it is not impossible, in a physical
sense, that two beings, of equal capacities for <HI>truth,</HI> should perceive, one of them
<HI>beauty,</HI> and the other <HI>deformity,</HI> in the same proportions. And upon this supposi∣tion,
by that <HI>truth</HI> which is always connected with <HI>beauty,</HI> nothing more can be
meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which, after
careful examination, the beauty of that species is found to depend. <HI>Polycletus,</HI> for
instance, a famous ancient sculptor, from an accurate mensuration of the several
parts of the most perfect human bodies, deduced a canon or system of proportions,
which was the rule of all succeeding artists. Suppose a statue modelled according
to this: a man of mere natural taste, upon looking at it, without entering into its
proportions, confesses and admires its <HI>beauty;</HI> whereas a professor of the art applies
his measures to the head, the neck, or the hand, and, without attending to its beau∣ty,
pronounces the workmanship to be <HI>just</HI> and <HI>true.</HI></P>

<P>VER. 19. <HI>At last the muses rose,</HI> &amp;c.] About the age of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> founder of
the third race of <HI>French</HI> kings, the poets of <HI>Provence</HI> were in high reputation; a
sort of strolling bards or rhapsodists, who went about the courts of princes and no∣blemen,
entertaining them at festivals with music and poetry. They attempted both
the epic, ode, and satire; and abounded in a wild and fantastic vein of fable, partly
allegorical, and partly founded on traditionary legends of the <HI>Saracen</HI> wars. These
were the rudiments of <HI>Italian</HI> poetry. But their taste and composition must have
been extremely barbarous, as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their
fable in much politer times; such as <HI>Boiardo, Bernardo Tasso, Ariosto,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

philosopher, <HI>being thus severed by the sprightly arts and sciences, must consequently
grow dronish, insipid, pedantic, useless, and directly opposite to the real knowledge and
practice of the world.</HI> Insomuch that <HI>a gentleman,</HI> says another excellent writer,

recovered but by uniting it once more with the works of imagination; and we have
had the pleasure of observing a very great progress made towards their union in

distance from each other than at the Revolution, when <HI>Locke</HI> stood at the head of
one party, and <HI>Dryden</HI> of the other. But the general spirit of liberty, which has
ever since been growing, naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve
that influence which the arts of persuasion gave them with the people, by applying
them to subjects of importance to society. Thus poetry and eloquence became con∣siderable;
and philosophy is now of course obliged to borrow of their embellish∣ments,
in order even to gain audience with the public.</P>

As if a man was never pleased in being moved at the distress of a tragedy, without
a cool reflection that though these fictitious personages were so unhappy, yet he
himself was perfectly at ease and in safety. The ingenious author of the <HI>Reflections
critiques sur la poesie &amp; sur la peinture,</HI> accounts for it by the general delight which
the mind, takes in its own activity, and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and in∣attentive
state: and this, joined with the moral approbation of its own temper,
which attends these emotions when natural and just, is certainly the true foundation
of the pleasure, which, as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epic, deserved a
very particular consideration in this poem.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 304. Inhabitant of earth, <HI>&amp;c.] The account of the oeconomy of provi∣dence
here introduced, as the most proper to calm and satisfy the mind when under
the compunction of private evils, seems to have come originally from the</HI> Pythago∣rean
<HI>school: but of the ancient philosophers,</HI> Plato <HI>has most largely insisted upon
it, has established it with all the strength of his capacious understanding, and en∣nobled
it with all the magnificence of his divine imagination. He has one passage
so full and clear on this head, that I am persuaded the reader will be pleased to see
it here, though somewhat long. Addressing himself to such as are not satisfied con∣cerning
divine providence:</HI> The Being who presides over the whole, <HI>says he,</HI> has dis∣posed
and complicated all things for the happiness and virtue of the whole, every part of
which, according to the extent of its influence, does and suffers what is fit and proper.
One of these parts is yours, O unhappy man, which though in itself most inconsiderable
and minute, yet being connected with the universe, ever seeks to co-operate with that
supreme order. You in the mean time are ignorant of the very end for which all par∣ticular
natures are brought into existence, that the all-comprehending nature of the
whole may be perfect and happy; existing, as it does, not for your sake, but the cause
and reason of your existence, which, as in the symmetry of every artificial work, must
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
of necessity concur with the general design of the artist, and be subservient to the whole
of which it is a part. Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless; since,
according to the various energy of creation, and the common laws of nature, there is a
constant provision of that which is best at the same time for you and for the whole.—
For the governing intelligence clearly beholding all the actions of animated and self-moving
creatures, and that mixture of good and evil which diversifies them, considered
first of all by what disposition of things, and by what situation of each individual in the
general system, vice might be depressed and subdued, and virtue made secure of victory
and happiness with the greatest facility and in the highest degree possible: In this manner
he ordered through the entire circle of being, the internal constitution of every mind,
where should be its station in the universal fabric, and through what variety of cir∣cumstances
it should proceed in the whole tenour of its existence. <HI>He goes on in his
sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution,</HI> as well for those who, by the
exercise of good dispositions being harmonized and assimilated into the divine virtue,
are consequently removed to a place of unblemished sanctity and happiness; as of those
who by the most flagitious arts have risen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest
affluence and power, and whom you therefore look upon as unanswerable instances of neg∣ligence
in the gods, because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subser∣vient,
and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the
whole. <HI>Plato de Leg. x.</HI> 16.</P>
<P>This theory has been delivered of late, especially abroad, in a manner which

<HEAD>NOTES
ON THE
THIRD BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>VER. 18.—<HI>where the powers</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of fancy,</HI> &amp;c.] The influence of the imagination on the conduct of
life, is one of the most important points in moral philosophy. It were easy by an
induction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almost all the passions, and
mixes with almost every circumstance of action or pleasure. Let any man, even:
of the coldest head and soberest industry, analyse the idea of what he calls his
interest; he will find that it consists chiefly of certain degrees of decency,
beauty, and order, variously combined into one system, the idol which he seeks to
enjoy by labour, hazard, and self-denial. It is on this account of the last conse∣quence
to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good;
otherwise the imagination, by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence
and beauty, or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they
deserve, may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the moral
order of things.</P>
<P>If it be objected that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely
accidental, whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to
certain passions prior to all circumstances of education or fortune; it may be an∣swered,
that though no man is born <HI>ambitious</HI> or a <HI>miser,</HI> yet he may inherit from
his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind, which shall render his imagi∣nation
more liable to be struck with some particular objects, consequently dispose
him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain passions of a particular turn.
Some men, for instance, by the original frame of their minds, are more delighted
with the vast and magnificent, others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle
aspects of nature. And it is very remarkable, that the disposition of the moral
powers is always similar to this of the imagination; that those who are most in∣clined
to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world, are also most
inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral. While
those who are charmed rather with the <HI>delicacy</HI> and <HI>sweetness</HI> of colours, and forms,
and sounds, never sail in like manner to yield the preference to the softer scenes of
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
virtue and the sympathies of a domestic life. And this is sufficient to account for the objection.</P>
<P>Among the ancient philosophers, though we have several hints concerning this
influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the <HI>Socratic</HI> school,
yet the <HI>Stoics</HI> were the first who paid it a due attention. <HI>Zeno,</HI> their founder, thought
it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life, without frequently inspecting
those pictures or appearances of things, which the imagination offers to the mind
(<HI>Diog. Laërt.</HI> l. vii.) The Meditations of <HI>M. Aurelius,</HI> and the discourses of <HI>Epictetus,</HI>
are full of the same sentiment; insomuch that the latter makes the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
or <HI>right management of the fancies,</HI> the only thing for which we are accoun∣table
to providence, and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantic.

<HI>Plato.</HI></P>
<P>Ver. 75.—<HI>how folly's aukward arts,</HI> &amp;c.] Notwithstanding the general
influence of <HI>ridicule</HI> on private and civil life, as well as on learning and the sciences,
it has been almost constantly neglected or misrepresented, by divines especially. The
manner of treating these subjects in the science of human nature, should be precisely
the same as in natural philosophy; from particular facts to investigate the stated order
in which they appear, and then apply the general law, thus discovered, to the explica∣tion
of other appearances and the improvement of useful arts.</P>
<P>Ver. 84. <HI>Behold the foremost band,</HI> &amp;c.] The first and most general source of
ridicule in the characters of men, is vanity, or self-applause for some desirable qua∣lity
or possession which evidently does not belong to those who assume it.</P>
<P>Ver. 121. <HI>Then comes the second order,</HI> &amp;c.] Ridicule from the same vanity,
where, though the possession be real, yet no merit can arise from it, because of some
particular circumstances, which, though obvious to the spectator, are yet overlooked
by the ridiculous character.</P>
<P>Ver. 152. <HI>Another tribe succeeds,</HI> &amp;c.] Ridicule from a notion of excellence in
particular objects disproportioned to their intrinsic value, and inconsistent with the
order of nature.</P>
<P>Ver. 191. <HI>But now ye gay,</HI> &amp;c.] Ridicule from a notion of excellence, when
the object is absolutely odious or contemptible. This is the highest degree of the
ridiculous; as in the affectation of diseases or vices.</P>
<P>Ver. 207. <HI>Thus far triumphant,</HI> &amp;c.] Ridicule from false shame or groundless
fear.</P>
<P>Ver. 228. <HI>Last of the,</HI> &amp;c.] Ridicule from the ignorance of such things as our circumstances require us to know.</P>
<P>Ver. 248.—<HI>Suffice it to have said,</HI> &amp;c.] By comparing these general sources
of ridicule with each other, and examining the ridiculous in other objects, we may
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
obtain a general definition of it, equally applicable to every species. The most im∣portant
circumstance of this definition is laid down in the lines referred to; but
others more minute we shall subjoin here. <HI>Aristotle's</HI> account of the matter seems
both imperfect and false; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says he, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>:
<HI>the ridiculous is some certain fault or turpitude without pain, and not destruc∣tive
to its subject.</HI> (<HI>Poët.</HI> c. 5.) For allowing it to be true, as it is not, that the
ridiculous is never accompanied with pain, yet we might produce many instances
of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ri∣diculous.
So that the definition does not distinguish the thing designed. Nay far∣ther;
even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject,
we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance, till the ruin become imminent,
and the keener sensations of pity or terror banish the ludicrous apprehension from
our minds. For the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement
or disagreement of ideas; but a passion or emotiom of the mind consequential to
that perception. So that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement,
and yet not feel the ridiculous, because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion.
Thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous, to which others can∣not
endure to apply the name; because in them they excite a much intenser and
more important feeling. And this difference, among other causes, has brought a
good deal of confusion into this question.</P>
<P>That which makes objects ridiculous, is some ground of admiration or esteen con∣nected
with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed; or
it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general ex∣cellent
or beautiful: the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves,
or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate; belonging always to the
same order or class of being; implying sentiment or design; and exciting no acute or ve∣hement
emotion of the heart.</P>
<P>To prove the several parts of this definition: <HI>The appearance of excellence or beauty
connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed,</HI> is ridiculous: for
instance, pompous pretensions of wisdom joined with ignorance or folly in the <HI>So∣crates</HI>
of <HI>Aristophanes;</HI> and the ostentations of military glory with cowardice and
stupidity in the <HI>Thraso</HI> of <HI>Terence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general
excellent or venerable,</HI> is also ridiculous: for instance, the personal weaknesses of a
magistrate appearing in the solemn and public functions of his station.</P>
<P><HI>The incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves, or in apprehen∣sion
of the person to whom they relate:</HI> in the last-mentioned instance, they both exist
in the objects; in the instances from <HI>Aristophanes</HI> and <HI>Terence,</HI> one of them is
objective and real, the other only founded in the apprehension of the ridiculous
character.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115"/>
<HI>The inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being.</HI> A cox∣comb
in fine cloaths, bedaubed by accident in foul weather, is a ridiculous object;
because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referred to the splen∣dour
and expence of his dress. A man of sense and merit, in the same circum∣stances,
is not counted ridiculous; because the general ground of excellence and
esteem in him is, both in fact and in his own apprehension, of a very different
species.</P>
<P><HI>Every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design.</HI> A column placed by an architect
without a capital or base, is laughed at: the same column in a ruin causes a very
different sensation.</P>
<P>And lastly, <HI>the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart,</HI>
such as terror, pity, or indignation; for in that case, as was observed above, the
mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous.</P>
<P>Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description, and whe∣ther
it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous, must be determined by
repeated applications of it to particular instances.</P>
<P>Ver. 259. <HI>Ask we for what fair end,</HI> &amp;c.] Since it is beyond all contradiction evident
that we have a <HI>natural</HI> sense or feeling of the ridiculous, and since so good a reason
may be assigned to justify the supreme being for bestowing it; one cannot without asto∣nishment
reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of
true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction, and endeavour to persuade
us that it is never applied but in a bad cause. Ridicule is not concerned with mere
speculative truth or falsehood. It is not in abstract propositions or theorems, but in
actions and passions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find materials
for it; and all these terms are <HI>relative,</HI> implying approbation or blame. To ask
them whether <HI>ridicule be a test of truth,</HI> is, in other words, to ask whether that
which is ridiculous can be <HI>morally true,</HI> can be just and becoming; or whether
that which is just and becoming, can be ridiculous. A question that does not de∣serve
a serious answer. For it is most evident, that, as in a metaphysical proposition
offered to the understanding for its assent, the faculty of reason examines the terms
of the proposition, and finding one idea, which was supposed equal to another, to
be in fact unequal, of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood; so, in
objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause, the faculty of ridicule, finding
an incongruity in the claim, urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt.
When therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind, and the incon∣sistent
circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of the public, it is our bu∣siness,
if the matter be of importance to society, to drag out those latent circum∣stances,
and, by setting them in full view, to convince the world how ridiculous the
claim is: and thus a double advantage is gained; for we both detect the <HI>moral
falsehood</HI> sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry, and impress the minds of
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors. And this and no
more is meant by the application of ridicule.</P>
<P>But it is said, the practice is dangerous, and may be inconsistent with the regard
we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I answer, the practice fairly ma∣naged
can never be dangerous; men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances
foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to
impose upon us: but the sense of ridicule always judges right. The <HI>Socrates</HI> of
<HI>Aristophanes</HI> is as <HI>truly</HI> ridiculous a character as ever was drawn:—True; but it is
not the character of <HI>Socrates,</HI> the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom.
What then? did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and
disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his
character, and thus rendered the satirist doubly ridiculous in his turn? No; but it
nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And so has the rea∣soning
of <HI>Spinoza</HI> made many atheists: he has founded it indeed on suppositions
utterly false; but allow him these, and his conclusions are unavoidably true. And if
we must reject the use of ridicule, because, by the imposition of false circumstances,
things may be made to seem ridiculous, which are not so in themselves; why we
ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason, because, by proceeding on
false principles, conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature, let the
vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine.</P>

<HEAD>THE GENERAL ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q><P>The pleasures of the imagination proceed either from natural
objects, as from a flourishing grove, a clear and murmuring
fountain, a calm sea by moon-light; or from works of art,
such as a noble edifice, a musical tune, a statue, a picture, a
poem. In treating of these pleasures, we must begin with
the former class; they being original to the other; and no∣thing
more being necessary, in order to explain them, than a
view of our natural inclination toward greatness and beauty,
and of those appearances, in the world around us, to which
that inclination is adapted. This is the subject of the first
book of the following poem.</P>
<P>But the pleasures which we receive from the elegant arts, from
music, sculpture, painting, and poetry, are much more va∣rious
and complicated. In them (besides greatness and beau∣ty,
or forms proper to the imagination) we find interwoven
frequent representations of truth, of virtue and vice, of
circumstances proper to move us with laughter, or to excite in
us pity, fear, and the other passions. These moral and in∣tellectual
objects are described in the second book; to which
the third properly belongs as an episode, though too large to
have been included in it.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="120"/>
With the above-mentioned causes of pleasure, which are univer∣sal
in the course of human life and appertain to our higher
faculties, many others do generally concur, more limited in
their operation, or of an inferior origin: such are the novelty
of objects, the association of ideas, affections of the bodily
senses, influences of education, national habits, and the like.
To illustrate these, and from the whole to determine the cha∣racter
of a perfect taste, is the argument of the fourth book.</P>
<P>Hitherto the pleasures of the imagination belong to the human spe∣cies
in general. But there are certain particular men whose
imagination is indowed with powers, and susceptible of plea∣sures,
which the generality of mankind never participate.
these are the men of genius, destined by nature to excell in
one or other of the arts already mentioned. It is proposed
therefore, in the last place, to delineate that genius which in
some degree appears common to them all; yet with a more
peculiar consideration of poetry: inasmuch as poetry is the
most extensive of those arts, the most philosophical, and the
most useful.</P></Q>

OF THE
IMAGINATION:
BOOK THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WITH what inchantment nature's goodly scene</L>
<L>Attracts the sense of mortals; how the mind</L>
<L>For its own eye doth objects nobler still</L>
<L>Prepare; how men by various lessons learn</L>
<L>To judge of beauty's praise; what raptures fill<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>The breast with fancy's native arts indow'd</L>
<L>And what true culture guides it to renown;</L>
<L>My verse unfolds. Ye gods, or godlike powers,</L>

Of all your wonderous empire; with a voice</L>
<L>So temper'd to his theme, that those, who hear,</L>

<L>Known, while with deep amazement thou dost there:</L>
<L>The perfect counsels read, the ideas old,</L>
<L>Of thine omniscient father; known on earth</L>
<L>By the still horror and the blissful tear<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>With which thou seizest on the soul of man;</L>

<L>With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame;</L>

<L>And through the mists of passion and of sense,</L>
<L>And through the pelting storms of chance and pain,</L>
<L>To hold strait on with constant heart and eye</L>
<L>Still fix'd upon his everlasting palm,</L>
<L>The approving smile of heaven? Else wherefore burns<MILESTONE N="210"/></L>
<L>In mortal bosoms this unquenched hope,</L>
<L>That seeks from day to day sublimer ends;</L>
<L>Happy, though restless? Why departs the soul</L>
<L>Wide from the track and journey of her times,</L>
<L>To grasp the good she knows not? in the field<MILESTONE N="215"/></L>
<L>Of things which may be, in the spacious field</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="132"/>
Of science, potent arts, or dreadful arms,</L>
<L>To raise up scenes in which her own desires</L>

<L>Pall on her temper, like a twice-told tale:<MILESTONE N="220"/></L>

<L>Which reason and affection prompt in man,<MILESTONE N="225"/></L>
<L>Not adverse nor unapt hath nature fram'd</L>
<L>His bold imagination. For, amid</L>
<L>The various forms which this full world presents</L>

<L>E'er doubts, before the transient and minute,<MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L>To prize the vast, the stable, the sublime?</L>
<L>Who, that from heights aërial sends his eye</L>
<L>Around a wild horizon, and surveys</L>
<L>Indus or Ganges rolling his broad wave</L>
<L>Through mountains, plains, through spacious cities old,<MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
<L>And regions dark with woods; will turn away</L>
<L>To mark the path of some penurious rill</L>
<L>Which murmureth at his feet? Where does the soul</L>
<L>Consent her soaring fancy to restrain,</L>
<L>Which bears her up, as on an eagle's wings,<MILESTONE N="240"/></L>
<L>Destin'd for highest heaven; or which of fate's</L>

<L><PB N="129" REF="133"/>
To any humbler quarry? The rich earth</L>
<L>Cannot detain her; nor the ambient air</L>
<L>With all its changes. For a while with joy<MILESTONE N="245"/></L>
<L>She hovers o'er the sun, and views the small</L>
<L>Attendant orbs, beneath his sacred beam,</L>
<L>Emerging from the deep, like cluster'd isles</L>
<L>Whose rocky shores to the glad sailor's eye</L>
<L>Reflect the gleams of morning: for a while<MILESTONE N="250"/></L>

<L>Bend the reluctant planets to move each</L>
<L>Round its perpetual year. But soon she quits</L>
<L>That prospect: meditating loftier views,</L>
<L>She darts adventurous up the long career<MILESTONE N="255"/></L>
<L>Of comets; through the constellations holds</L>
<L>Her course, and now looks back on all the stars</L>
<L>Whose blended flames as with a milky stream</L>
<L>Part the blue region. Empyréan tracts,</L>
<L>Where happy souls beyond this concave heaven<MILESTONE N="260"/></L>
<L>Abide, she then explores, whence purer light</L>
<L>For countless ages travels through the abyss</L>
<L>Nor hath in sight of mortals yet arriv'd.</L>
<L>Upon the wide creation's utmost shore</L>
<L>At length she stands, and the dread space beyond<MILESTONE N="265"/></L>
<L>Contemplates, half-recoiling: nathless down</L>
<L>The gloomy void, astonish'd, yet unquell'd,</L>
<L>She plungeth; down the unfathomable gulph</L>
<L><PB N="130" REF="134"/>
Where God alone hath being. There her hopes</L>
<L>Rest at the fated goal. For, from the birth<MILESTONE N="270"/></L>
<L>Of human kind, the sovran maker said</L>
<L>That not in humble, nor in brief delight,</L>
<L>Not in the fleeting echos of renown,</L>
<L>Power's purple robes, nor pleasure's flowery lap,</L>
<L>The soul should find contentment; but, from these<MILESTONE N="275"/></L>
<L>Turning disdainful to an equal good,</L>
<L>Through nature's opening walks inlarge her aim,</L>
<L>Till every bound at length should disappear,</L>
<L>And infinite perfection fill the scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But lo, where beauty, dress'd in gentler pomp,<MILESTONE N="280"/></L>
<L>With comely steps advancing, claims the verse</L>
<L>Her charms inspire. O beauty, source of praise,</L>
<L>Of honour, even to mute and lifeless things;</L>
<L>O thou that kindlest in each human heart</L>
<L>Love, and the wish of poets, when their tongue<MILESTONE N="285"/></L>
<L>Would teach to other bosoms what so charms</L>
<L>Their own; o child of nature and the soul,</L>
<L>In happiest hour brought forth; the doubtful garb</L>
<L>Of words, of earthly language, all too mean,</L>
<L>Too lowly i account, in which to clothe<MILESTONE N="290"/></L>
<L>Thy form divine. for thee the mind alone</L>
<L>Beholds; nor half thy brightness can reveal</L>
<L>Through those dim organs, whose corporeal touch</L>

O'ershadoweth thy pure essence. Yet, my Muse,</L>
<L>If fortune call thee to the task, wait thou<MILESTONE N="295"/></L>
<L>Thy favorable seasons: then, while fear</L>
<L>And doubt are absent, through wide nature's bounds</L>
<L>Expatiate with glad step, and choose at will</L>
<L>Whate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains,</L>
<L>Whate'er the waters, or the liquid air,<MILESTONE N="300"/></L>
<L>To manifest unblemish'd beauty's praise,</L>
<L>And o'er the breasts of mortals to extend</L>
<L>Her gracious empire. Wilt thou to the isles</L>
<L>Atlantic, to the rich Hesperian clime,</L>
<L>Fly in the train of Autumn; and look on,<MILESTONE N="305"/></L>

<L>Where'er his fingers touch the fruitful grove,</L>

<L>Turning aside their foliage, and come forth<MILESTONE N="310"/></L>
<L>In purple lights, till every hilloc glows</L>
<L>As with the blushes of an evening sky?</L>
<L>Or wilt thou that Thessalian landscape trace,</L>
<L>Where slow Penéus his clear glassy tide</L>
<L>Draws smooth along, between the winding cliffs<MILESTONE N="315"/></L>
<L>Of Ossa and the pathless woods unshorn</L>
<L>That wave o'er huge Olympus? Down the stream,</L>
<L>Look how the mountains with their double range</L>
<L>Imbrace the vale of Tempe; from each side</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="136"/>
Ascending steep to heaven, a rocky mound<MILESTONE N="320"/></L>
<L>Cover'd with ivy and the laurel boughs</L>
<L>That crown'd young Phoebus for the Python slain.</L>
<L>Fair Tempe! on whose primrose banks the morn</L>
<L>Awoke most fragrant, and the noon repos'd</L>
<L>In pomp of lights and shadows most sublime:<MILESTONE N="325"/></L>
<L>Whose lawns, whose glades, ere human footsteps yet</L>
<L>Had trac'd an entrance, were the hallow'd haunt</L>
<L>Of sylvan powers immortal: where they sate</L>
<L>Oft in the golden age, the Nymphs and Fauns,</L>
<L>Beneath some arbor branching o'er the flood,<MILESTONE N="330"/></L>
<L>And leaning round hung on the instructive lips</L>
<L>Of hoary Pan, or o'er some open dale</L>
<L>Danc'd in light measures to his sevenfold pipe,</L>
<L>While Zephyr's wanton hand along their path</L>
<L>Flung showers of painted blossoms, fertile dews,<MILESTONE N="335"/></L>
<L>And one perpetual spring. But if our task</L>
<L>More lofty rites demand, with all good vows</L>
<L>Then let us hasten to the rural haunt</L>
<L>Where young Melissa dwells. Nor thou refuse</L>
<L>The voice which calls thee from thy lov'd retreat,<MILESTONE N="340"/></L>
<L>But hither, gentle maid, thy footsteps turn:</L>

Seen through the vernal air. By yonder stream,</L>
<L>Where beech and elm along the bordering mead</L>

<L>Reply; where tidings of content and peace</L>
<L>Each echo brings. Lo, how the western sun</L>
<L>O'er fields and floods, o'er every living soul,</L>
<L>Diffuseth glad repose! There while i speak</L>
<L>Of beauty's honors, thou, Melissa, thou<MILESTONE N="355"/></L>
<L>Shalt hearken, not unconscious. while i tell</L>
<L>How first from heaven she came: how after all</L>
<L>The works of life, the elemental scenes,</L>
<L>The hours, the seasons, she had oft explor'd,</L>
<L>At length her favorite mansion and her throne<MILESTONE N="360"/></L>
<L>She fix'd in woman's form: what pleasing ties</L>

<L>They lend each other's power; and how divine</L>
<L>Their union, should some unambitious maid,</L>
<L>To all the inchantment of the Idalian queen,<MILESTONE N="365"/></L>
<L>Add sanctity and wisdom: while my tongue</L>
<L>Prolongs the tale, Melissa, thou may'st feign</L>
<L>To wonder whence my rapture is inspir'd;</L>
<L>But soon the smile which dawns upon thy lip</L>
<L>Shall tell it, and the tenderer bloom o'er all<MILESTONE N="370"/></L>
<L>That soft cheek springing to the marble neck,</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="138"/>
Which bends aside in vain, revealing more</L>

<L>Great nature's winning arts, which thus inform<MILESTONE N="375"/></L>
<L>With joy and love the rugged breast of man,</L>
<L>Should sound in numbers worthy of such a theme:</L>
<L>While all whose souls have ever felt the force</L>
<L>Of those inchanting passions, to my lyre</L>
<L>Should throng attentive, and receive once more<MILESTONE N="380"/></L>
<L>Their influence, unobscur'd by any cloud</L>
<L>Of vulgar care, and purer than the hand</L>
<L>Of fortune can bestow: nor, to confirm</L>
<L>Their sway, should awful contemplation scorn</L>
<L>To join his dictates to the genuine strain<MILESTONE N="385"/></L>
<L>Of pleasure's tongue; nor yet should pleasure's ear</L>
<L>Be much averse. Ye chiefly, gentle band</L>
<L>Of youths and virgins, who through many a wish</L>
<L>And many a fond pursuit, as in some scene</L>
<L>Of magic bright and fleeting, are allur'd<MILESTONE N="390"/></L>
<L>By various beauty; if the pleasing toil</L>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>Introduction to this more difficult part of the subject. Of truth
and its three classes, matter of fact, experimental or scientifical
truth, (contradistinguished from opinion) and universal truth:
which last is either metaphysical or geometrical, either purely in∣tellectual
or perfectly abstracted. On the power of discerning
truth depends that of acting with the view of an end; a cir∣cumstance
essential to virtue. Of virtue, considered in the
divine mind as a perpetual and universal beneficence. Of
human virtue, considered as a system of particular sentiments
and actions, suitable to the design of providence and the con∣dition
of man; to whom it constitutes the chief good and the
first beauty. Of vice and its origin. Of ridicule: its ge∣neral
nature and final cause. Of the passions; particularly
of those which relate to evil natural or moral, and which are
generally accounted painful, though not always unattended
with pleasure.</Q>

<L>THE radiant ruler of the year</L>
<L>At length his wintry goal attains;</L>
<L>Soon to reverse the long career,</L>
<L>And northward bend his steady reins.</L>
<L>Now, piercing half Potosi's height,</L>
<L>Prone rush the fiery floods, of light</L>
<L>Ripening the mountain' silver stores:</L>
<L>While, in some cavern's horrid shade,</L>

<LG N="2">

<L>But lo, on this deserted coast</L>

<L><PB N="217" REF="218"/>
The fields resign their latest bloom;</L>
<L>No more the breezes waft perfume,</L>
<L>No more the streams in music roll:</L>
<L>But snows fall dark, or rains resound;</L>
<L>And, while great nature mourns around,</L>
<L>Her griefs infect the human soul.</L>

<LG N="3">

<L>Hence the loud city's busy throngs</L>
<L>Urge the warm bowl and splendid fire:</L>

<L>Against the spiteful heaven conspire.</L>
<L>Meantime perhaps with tender fears</L>
<L>Some village-dame the curfew hears,</L>
<L>While round the hearth her children play:</L>
<L>At morn their father went abroad;</L>
<L>The moon is sunk and deep the road;</L>

Yet gentle hours advance their wing;</L>
<L>And fancy, mocking winter's might,</L>

<L>Already decks the newborn spring.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">

ON THE
TWO BOOKS OF ODES.</HEAD>
<P>B. I. Ode XVIII. Stanza II. 2.] <HI>Lycurgus</HI> the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> lawgiver brought
into <HI>Greece</HI> from <HI>Asia Minor</HI> the first complete copy of <HI>Homer's</HI> works.—At <HI>Plataea</HI>
was fought the decisive battle between the <HI>Persian</HI> army and the united militia of
<HI>Greece</HI> under <HI>Pausanias</HI> and <HI>Aristides.—Cimon</HI> the <HI>Athenian</HI> erected a trophy in <HI>Cyprus</HI>
for two great victories gained on the same day over the <HI>Persians</HI> by sea and land.
<HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> has preserved the inscription which the <HI>Athenians</HI> affixed to the con∣secrated
spoils, after this great success; in which it is very remarkable, that the
greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual sim∣plicity
and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions. It is this:

<P><PB N="344" REF="345"/>
Stanza II. 3.] <HI>Pindar</HI> was cotemporary with <HI>Aristides</HI> and <HI>Cimon,</HI> in whom the
glory of ancient <HI>Greece</HI> was at its height. When <HI>Xerxes</HI> invaded <HI>Greece, Pindar</HI>
was true to the common interest of his country; though his fellow citizens, the
<HI>Thebans,</HI> had sold themselves to the <HI>Persian</HI> king. In one of his odes he expresses
the great distress and anxiety of his mind, occasioned by the vast preparations of
<HI>Xerxes</HI> against <HI>Greece. (Isthm.</HI> 8.) In another he celebrates the victories of <HI>Salamis,
Platoea,</HI> and <HI>Himera. (Pyth.</HI> I.) It will be necessary to add two or three other par∣ticulars
of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the text
concerning him. First then, he was thought to be so great a favourite of <HI>Apollo,</HI>
that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings. It was
said of him, as of some other illustrious men, that at his birth a swarm of bees
lighted on his lips, and fed him with their honey. It was also a tradition concerning
him, that <HI>Pan</HI> was heard to recite his poetry, and seen dancing to one of his hymns
on the mountains near <HI>Thebes.</HI> But a real historical fact in his life is, that the
<HI>Thebans</HI> imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he ex∣pressed
in his poems for that heroic spirit, shewn by the people of <HI>Athens</HI> in defence
of the common liberty, which his own fellow citizens had shamefully betrayed.
And, as the argument of this ode implies, that <HI>great poetical talents, and high sen∣timents
of liberty, do reciprocally produce and assist each other,</HI> so <HI>Pindar</HI> is perhaps
the most exemplary proof of this connection, which occurs in history. The <HI>Thebans</HI>
were remarkable, in general, for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of
their common-wealth; at the time of its ruin by <HI>Philip;</HI> and even in its best state,
under the administration of <HI>Pelopidas</HI> and <HI>Epaminondas:</HI> and every one knows, they
were no less remarkable for great dullness, and want of all genius. That <HI>Pindar</HI>
should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellow citizens in both
these respects, seems somewhat extraordinary, and is scarce to be accounted for but
by the preceding observation.</P>
<P>Stanza III. 3.] Alluding to his <HI>Defence of the people of</HI> England against <HI>Salmasius.</HI>

The Fourth.</P>
<P>Stanza V. 3.] At <HI>Whittington,</HI> a village on the edge of <HI>Scarsdale</HI> in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI>
the Earls of <HI>Devonshire</HI> and <HI>Danby,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Delamere,</HI> privately concerted
the plan of the Revolution. The house in which they met is at present a farm∣house,

<HI>the plotting parlour.</HI></P>
<P>B. II. Ode VII. Stanza II. 1.] Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> died in 1704, when Mr. <HI>Hoadly</HI> was
beginning to distinguish himself in the cause of civil and religious liberty: Lord
<PB N="345" REF="346"/>
<HI>Godolphin</HI> in 1712, when the doctrines of the Jacobite faction were chiefly favoured
by those in power: Lord <HI>Somers</HI> in 1716, amid the practices of the nonjuring cler∣gy
against the protestant establishment; and Lord <HI>Stanhope</HI> in 1721, during the con∣troversy
with the lower house of convocation.</P>
<P>B. II. Ode X. Stanza V.] During Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> war with <HI>Theobald, Concanen,</HI> and
the rest of their tribe, Mr. <HI>Warburton,</HI> the present Lord Bishop of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> did
with great zeal cultivate their friendship; having been introduced, forsooth, at the
meetings of that respectable confederacy: a favour which he afterwards spoke of
in very high terms of complacency and thankfulness. At the same time in his inter∣course
with them he treated Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in a most contemptuous manner, and as a
writer without genius. Of the truth of these assertions his Lordship can have no
doubt, if he recollects his own correspondence with <HI>Concanen;</HI> a part of which is
still in being, and will probably be remembered as long as any of this prelate's
writings.</P>
<P>B. II. Ode XIII.] In the year 1751 appeared a very splendid edition, in quarto,

hand-writing. In this edition, among other extraordinary passages, are the two
following, to which the third stanza of this ode more particularly refers:</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>The Nymphs, who preside over springs and rivulets, are ad∣dressed
at day-break, in honor of their several functions,
and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to
the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the first al∣legorical
deities, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine
of the old mythological poets, concerning the generation of
the gods and the rise of things. They are then successively
considered, as giving motion to the air and exciting summer-breezes;
as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable creation;
as contributing to the fullness of navigable rivers; and con∣sequently
to the maintenance of commerce; and by that means,
to the maritime part of military power. Next is represented
their favourable influence upon health, when assisted by rural
exercise: which introduces their connection with the art of
physic, and the happy effects of mineral medicinal springs.
Lastly, they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses
bear them, and for the true inspiration which temperance
only can receive: in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more
licentious poets.</Q>

<HEAD>NOTES
ON THE
HYMN TO THE NAIADS.</HEAD>
<P>Page 350. l. 11.—<HI>Love</HI>—</P>
<P><HI>Elder than Chaos.] Hesiod,</HI> in his <HI>Theogony,</HI> gives a different account,
and makes Chaos the eldest of beings; though he assigns to Love neither fa∣ther
nor superior; which circumstance is particularly mentioned by <HI>Phoedrus,</HI> in
<HI>Plato's Banquet,</HI> as being observable not only in <HI>Hesiod,</HI> but in all other writers
both of verse and prose: and on the same occasion he cites a line from <HI>Parmenides,</HI>
in which Love is expressly stiled the eldest of all the gods. Yet <HI>Aristophanes,</HI> in
<HI>The Birds,</HI> affirms, that “Chaos, and Night, and Erebus, and Tartarus, were
first; and that Love was produced from an egg, which the sable-winged night de∣posited
in the immense bosom of Erebus.” But it must be observed, that the
Love designed by this comic poet was always distinguished from the other, from that
original and self-existent being the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of <HI>Plato,</HI> and meant only
the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or second person of the old <HI>Groecian</HI> trinity; to whom is inscribed
an hymn among those which pass under the name of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> where he is called
<HI>Protogonos;</HI> or the first-begotten, is said to have been born of an egg, and is repre∣sented
as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of nature. In the
fragments of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> collected by <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> he is named <HI>Phanes,</HI> the disco∣verer
or discloser; who unfolded the ideas of the-supreme intelligence, and ex∣posed
them to the perception of inferior beings in this visible frame of the world;
as <HI>Macrobius,</HI> and <HI>Proclus,</HI> and <HI>Athenagoras</HI> all agree to interpret the several passages
of <HI>Orpheus</HI> which they have preserved.</P>
<P>But the Love designed in our text, is the one self-existent and insinite mind, whom
if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in
accounting for the production of the world and its appearances; yet, to a modern
poet, it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this par∣ticular;
though, in other respects, he professeth to imitate their manner and con∣form
to their opinions. For, in these great points of natural theology, they differ
no less remarkably among themselves; and are perpetually confounding the philo∣sophical
relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythic history:
<PB N="364" REF="364"/>
upon which very account, <HI>Callimachus,</HI> in his hymn to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> declareth his dissent
from them concerning even an article of the national creed; adding, that the an∣cient
bards were by no means to be depended on. And yet in the exordium of
the old <HI>Argonautic</HI> poem, ascribed to <HI>Orpheus,</HI> it is said, that “Love, whom mortals
in later times call <HI>Phanes,</HI> was the father of the eternally-begotten Night;” who
is generally represented by these mythological poets, as being herself the parent of
all things; and who, in the <HI>Indigitamenta,</HI> or <HI>Orphic Hymns,</HI> is said to be the same
with <HI>Cypris,</HI> or Love itself. Moreover, in the body of this <HI>Argonautic</HI> poem, where
the personated <HI>Orpheus</HI> introduceth himself singing to his lyre in reply to <HI>Chiron,</HI> he
celebrateth “the obscure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained
within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude; how the heaven had its boundary
determined; the generation of the earth; the depth of the ocean; and also the
sapient Love, the most ancient, the self-sufficient; with all the beings which he
produced when he separated one thing from another.” Which noble pas∣sage
is more directly to <HI>Aristotle's</HI> purpose in the first book of his metaphysics
than any of those which he has there quoted, to shew that the ancient poets
and mythologists agreed with <HI>Empedocles, Anaxagoras,</HI> and the other more sober
philosophers, in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind con∣cerning
the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connexion, motion, and
good order of the world. For, though neither this poem, nor the hymns which
pass under the same name, are it should seem, the work of the real <HI>Orpheus;</HI> yet
beyond all question, they are very ancient. The hymns, more particularly, are: al∣lowed
to be older than the invasion of <HI>Greece</HI> by <HI>Xerxes;</HI> and were probably a sett
of public and solemn forms of devotion: as appears by a passage in one of them,
which <HI>Demosthenes</HI> hath almost literally cited in his first oration against <HI>Aristogiton,</HI>
as the saying of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> the founder of their most holy mysteries. On this ac∣count,
they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant,
the <HI>Theogony</HI> of <HI>Hesiod</HI> himself not excepted. The poetry of them is often ex∣tremely
noble; and the mysterious air which prevails in them, together with its
delightful impression upon the mind, cannot be better expressed than in that re∣markable
description with which they inspired the <HI>German</HI> editor <HI>Eschenbach,</HI> when
he accidentally met with them at <HI>Leipsic:</HI> “Thesaurum me reperisse credidi, says he,
&amp; profecto thesaurum reperi. Incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore asslaverint in∣digitamenta
ista deorum: nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar, quod
vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest, nocturnum; cum enim totam diem con∣susmerim
in contemplando urbis splendore, &amp; in adeundis, quibus scatet urbs illa,
viris doctis; sola nox restabat, quam <HI>Orphco</HI> consecrare potui. In abyssum quendam
mysteriorum venerandae antiquitatis descendere videbar, quotiescunque silente mun∣do,
solis vigilantibus astris et luna, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> istos hymnos ad manus sumsi.”

l. 11. <HI>Chaos.</HI>] The unformed, undigested mass of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Plato:</HI> which
<HI>Milton</HI> calls</P>
<P>“The womb of nature.”</P>
<P>l. 11. <HI>Love, the sire of Fate.</HI>] Fate is the universal system of natural causes; the
work of the Omnipotent Mind, or of Love: so <HI>Minucius Felix:</HI> “Quid enim aliud est
fatum, quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est.” So also <HI>Cicero,</HI> in <HI>The
First Book on Divination:</HI> “Fatum autem id appello, quod <HI>Graeci</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
id est, ordinem seriemque causarum, cum causa causae nexa rem ex se gignat—ex
quo intelligitur, ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiase, sed id quod physice dicitur
causa aeterna rerum.” To the same purpose is the doctrine of <HI>Hierocles,</HI> in that ex∣cellent
fragment concerning Providence and Destiny. As to the three Fates, or De∣stinies
of the poets, they represented that part of the general system of natural
causes which relates to man, and to other mortal beings: for so we are told in the
hymn addressed to them among the <HI>Orphic Indigitamenta,</HI> where they are called the
daughters of Night (or Love), and, contrary to the vulgar notion, are distinguished
by the epithets of gentle, and tender-hearted. According to <HI>Hesiod Theog.</HI> ver. 904,
they were the daughters of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Themis:</HI> but in the <HI>Orphic Hymn to Venus,</HI>
or Love, that Goddess is directly stiled the mother of Necessity, and. is represented,
immediately after, as governing the three Destinies, and conducting the whole system
of natural causes.</P>
<P>l. 12. <HI>Born of Fate was Time.</HI>] Cronos, Saturn, or Time, was, according to <HI>Apol∣lodorus,</HI>
the son of <HI>Caelum</HI> and <HI>Tellus.</HI> But the author of the hymns gives it quite
undisguised by mythological language, and calls him plainly the offspring of the
earth and the starry heaven; that is, of Fate, as explained in the preceding note.</P>
<P>l. 13. <HI>Who many sons-devour' d.</HI>] The known fable of Saturn devouring his chil∣dren
was certainly meant to imply the dissolution of natural bodies; which are pro∣duced
and destroyed by Time.</P>
<P>l. 14, 15. <HI>The child of Rhea.] Jupiter,</HI> so called by <HI>Pindar.</HI></P>
<P>l. 15. <HI>Drove him from the upper sky.</HI>] That <HI>Jupiter</HI> dethroned his father <HI>Saturn,</HI>
is recorded by all the mythologists. <HI>Phurmutus,</HI> or <HI>Cornutus,</HI> the author of a little
<HI>Greek</HI> treatise on the nature of the gods, informs us, that by <HI>Jupiter</HI> was meant the
vegetable soul of the world, which restrained and prevented those uncertain alte∣rations
which <HI>Saturn,</HI> or Time, used formerly to cause in the mundane system.</P>
<P>l. 16. <HI>Then social reign'd.</HI>] Our mythology here supposeth, that before the
establishment of the vital, vegetative, plastic nature (represented by <HI>Jupiter),</HI> tho
four elements were in a variable and unsettled condition; but afterwards, well-disposed
and at peace among themselves. <HI>Tethys</HI> was the wife of the Ocean; <HI>Ops,</HI>
or <HI>Rhea,</HI> the Earth; <HI>Vesta,</HI> the eldest daughter of <HI>Saturn,</HI> Fire; and the cloud-compeller,
or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Air: though he also represented the plastic
principle of nature, as may be seen in the <HI>Orphic</HI> hymn inscribed to him.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="366"/>
l. 20. <HI>The sedgy-crowned race.</HI>] The river-gods; who, according to <HI>Hestod's</HI>
Theogony, were the sons of <HI>Oceanus</HI> and <HI>Tethys.</HI></P>
<P>l. 22, 23. <HI>From them, are ye, o Naiads.</HI>] The descent of the Naiads is less certain
than most points of the <HI>Greek</HI> mythology. <HI>Homer, Odyss.</HI> xiii. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Virgil,</HI>
in <HI>The Eighth Book of the Aeneid,</HI> speaks as if the Nymphs, or Naiads, were the
parents of the rivers: but in this he contradicts the testimony of <HI>Hesiod,</HI> and evi∣dently
departs from the orthodox system, which representeth several nymphs as
retaining to every single river. On the other hand, <HI>Callimachus,</HI> who was very
learned in all the school-divinity of those times, in his hymn to <HI>Delos,</HI> maketh <HI>Pe∣neus,</HI>
the great <HI>Thessalian</HI> river-god, the father of his nymphs: and <HI>Ovid,</HI> in <HI>The
Fourteenth Book of his Metamorphoses,</HI> mentions the Naiads of <HI>Latium</HI> as the imme∣diate
daughters of the neighbouring river-gods. Accordingly, the Naiads of par∣ticular
rivers are occasionally, both by <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Statius,</HI> called by a patronymic,
from the name of the river to which they belong.</P>
<P>P. 351. l. 1. <HI>Syrian Daphne.</HI>] The grove of <HI>Daphne</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> near <HI>Antioch,</HI>
was famous for its delightful fountains.</P>
<P>l. 1, 2. <HI>The tribes belov'd by Paeon.</HI>] Mineral and medicinal springs. <HI>Paeon</HI> was the
physician of the gods.</P>
<P>l. 4. <HI>The winged offspring.</HI>] The Winds; who, according to <HI>Hesiod</HI> and <HI>Apollo∣dorus,</HI>
were the sons of <HI>Astraeus</HI> and <HI>Aurora.</HI></P>
<P>l. 7. <HI>Hyperíon.</HI>] A son of <HI>Caelum</HI> and <HI>Tellus,</HI> and father of the Sun, who is
thence called, by <HI>Pindar, Hyperionides.</HI> But <HI>Hyperíon</HI> is put by <HI>Homer</HI> in the same
manner as here, for the Sun himself.</P>
<P>l. 10. <HI>Your sallying streams.</HI>] The state of the atmosphere with respect to rest
and motion is, in several ways, affected by rivers and running streams; and that more
especially in hot seasons: first, they destroy its equilibrium, by cooling those parts
of it with which they are in contact; and secondly, they communicate their own
motion: and the air which is thus moved by them, being left heated, is of conse∣quence
more elastic than other parts of the atmosphere, and therefore fitter to pre∣serve
and to propagate that motion.</P>
<P>P. 352. l. 6. <HI>Delian king.</HI>] One of the epithets of <HI>Apollo,</HI> or the Sun, in the
<HI>Orphic</HI> hymn inscribed to him.</P>
<P>l. 15. <HI>Chloris.</HI>] The ancient <HI>Greek</HI> name for <HI>Flora.</HI></P>
<P>l. 19. <HI>Amalthca.</HI>] The mother of the first <HI>Bacchus,</HI> whose birth and education
was written, as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> informs us, in the old <HI>Pelasgic</HI> character, by <HI>Thy∣moetes,</HI>
grandson to <HI>Laomedon,</HI> and contemporary with <HI>Orpheus. Thymoetes</HI> had
travelled over <HI>Libya</HI> to the country which borders on the western ocean; there
he saw the island of <HI>Nysa,</HI> and learned from the inhabitants, that “<HI>Ammon,</HI> king
of <HI>Libya,</HI> was married in former ages to <HI>Rhea,</HI> sister of <HI>Saturn</HI> and the <HI>Titans:</HI>
that he afterwards fell in love with, a beautiful virgin whose name was <HI>Amalthca;</HI>
<PB N="367" REF="367"/>
had by her a son, and gave her possession of a neighbouring tract of land, won∣derfully
fertile; which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox, was thence
called the <HI>Hesperian</HI> horn, and afterwards the horn of <HI>Amalthea:</HI> that fearing
the jealousy of <HI>Rhea,</HI> he concealed the young <HI>Bacchus,</HI> with this mother, in the
island of <HI>Nysa;</HI>” the beauty of which, <HI>Diodorus</HI> describes with great dignity and
pomp of style. This fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology, and
seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of <HI>Milton;</HI> the only
modern poet (unless perhaps it be necessary to except <HI>Spenser</HI>) who, in these my∣sterious
traditions of the poetic story, had a heart to feel, and words to express,
the simple and solitary genius of antiquity. To raise the idea of his <HI>Paradise,</HI> he
prefers it even to
<Q><L>—“that <HI>Nysean</HI> isle</L>
<L>Girt by the river <HI>Triton,</HI> where old <HI>Cham,</HI></L>
<L>(Whom <HI>Gentiles Ammon</HI> call, and <HI>Libyan Jove</HI>)</L>

<P>l. 16. <HI>When Hermes.</HI>] <HI>Hermes,</HI> or <HI>Mercury,</HI> was the patron of commerce; in
which benevolent character he is addressed by the author of the <HI>Indigitamenta,</HI> in

<P>P. 354. l. 7. <HI>Dispense the mineral treasure.</HI>] The merchants of <HI>Sidon</HI> and <HI>Tyre</HI>
made frequent voyages to the coast of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> from whence they carried home
great quantities of tin.</P>
<P>l. 22. <HI>Hath he not won.</HI>] <HI>Mercury,</HI> the patron of commerce, being so greatly de∣pendent
on the good offices of the Naiads, in return obtains for them the friendship
of <HI>Minerva,</HI> the goddess of war: for military power, at least the naval part of it,
hath constantly followed the establishment of trade; which exemplifies the preceding
observation, that “from bounty issueth power.”</P>

<P><PB N="368" REF="368"/>
P. 358. l. 13. <HI>Io, Poean.</HI>] An exclamation of victory and triumph, derived from
<HI>Apollo's</HI> encounter with <HI>Python.</HI></P>
<P>P. 359. l. 13. <HI>Cirrha.</HI>] One of the summits of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> and sacred to <HI>Apollo.</HI>
Near it were several fountains, said to be frequented by the Muses. <HI>Nysa,</HI> the
other eminence of the same mountain, was dedicated to <HI>Bacchus.</HI></P>
<P>l. 24. <HI>Charm the mind of gods.</HI>] This whole passage, concerning the effects of
sacred music among the gods, is taken from <HI>Pindar's</HI> first <HI>Pythian</HI> ode.</P>
<P>P. 361. l. 8. <HI>Phrygian pipe's.</HI>] The <HI>Phrygian</HI> music was fantastic and turbulent,
and fit to excite disorderly passions.</P>
<P>l. 13, 14. <HI>The gates where Pallas holds
The guardian key.</HI>] It was the office of <HI>Minerva</HI> to be the guardian
of wallend cities; whence she was named <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and had her
statues placed in their gates, being supposed to keep the keys; and on that account
stiled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>l. 21. 22. <HI>Fate of sober Pentheus.] Pentheus</HI> was torn in pieces by the bacchanalian
priests and women, for despising their mysteries.</P>
<P>P. 362. l. 4, 5. <HI>The cave Corycian.</HI>] Of this cave <HI>Pausanias,</HI> in his <HI>Tenth Book,</HI>
gives the following description: “Between <HI>Delphi</HI> and the eminences of <HI>Parnassus,</HI>
is a road to the grotto of <HI>Corycium,</HI> which has its name form the nymph <HI>Corycia,</HI>
and is by far the most remarkable which I have seen. One may walk a great way
into it without a torch. 'Tis of considerable height, and hath several springs
within it; and yet a much greater quantity of distills from the shell and
roof, so as to be continually dropping on the ground. The people round <HI>Par∣nassus</HI>
hold it sacred to the <HI>Corycian</HI> nymphs and to <HI>Pan.”</HI></P>
<P>l. 5. <HI>Delphic mount.] Delphi,</HI> the seat and oracle of <HI>Apollo,</HI> had a mountainous
and rocky situation, on the skirts of <HI>Parnassus.</HI></P>
<P>l. 13. <HI>Cyrenaïc shell.] Cyrene</HI> was the native country of <HI>Callimachus,</HI> whose
hymns are the most remarkable example of that mythological passion which is
assumed in the preceding poem, and have always afforded particular pleasure to the
author of it, by reason of the mysterious solemnity with which they affect the mind.
On this account he was induced to attempt somewhat in the same manner; solely by
way of exercise: the manner itself being now almost intirely abandoned in poetry.
And as the meer genealogy, or the personal adventures of heathen gods, could
have been but little interesting to a modern reader; it was therefore thought proper
to select some convenient part of the history of nature, and to employ these ancient
divinities as it probable they were first employed; to wit, in personifying natural
causes, and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and
moral powers of the world: which hath been accounted the very highest office of
poetry.</P>
