<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN first I began the fol∣lowing <HI>Poem,</HI> I was so far from thinking of the Press; that I aimed no farther than to de∣scribe, and that for my own Diver∣sion only, The <HI>Monomachie,</HI> or <HI>Sin∣gle Combat,</HI> between the <HI>Giant</HI> and the <HI>Stripling,</HI> great <HI>Goliah</HI> and lit∣tle <HI>David</HI>.</P>
<P>After I had, in such Sort as it is, performed that, I was drawn on, in∣sensibly as it were, to set forth the <HI>Noble Friendship,</HI> which, upon the great <HI>Atchievement</HI> of <HI>David</HI>'s, was
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
contracted between <HI>Prince Jonathan</HI> and <HI>Him:</HI> with the <HI>Effects</HI> of both, the <HI>Advancement</HI> of <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Places</HI> of <HI>Honour, Trust</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> and his <HI>brave discharge</HI> thereof, in the <HI>Service</HI> of his <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country</HI>. Which, as it gained him the great <HI>Love</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> so it procur'd him the high <HI>Displeasure</HI> of the <HI>King:</HI> and, as Consequent thereof, the <HI>Trou∣bles</HI> he afterwards went through.</P>
<P>Having attended him so far in his <HI>Prosperity</HI> and <HI>Greatness,</HI> I could not find in my Heart, methought, to leave him in his <HI>Adversity</HI> and <HI>de∣pressed State:</HI> but accompanying him through his <HI>Sufferings</HI> under <HI>Saul,</HI> I waited on him, till I had seen him fairly settled on the Throne of <HI>Israel</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>There again I made a Stand, as willing to have made that the <HI>Bound</HI> of my <HI>Undertaking</HI>. But after I had paus'd awhile, look'd back, and view'd the Steps I had taken; ob∣serv'd from what a <HI>low Beginning,</HI> through what extream <HI>Difficulties</HI> and <HI>Hardships,</HI> to what a <HI>towring Pitch</HI> of <HI>Height</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> our <HI>Hero</HI> was advanced: and considered also, how soon this Great and Mighty <HI>Mo∣narch,</HI> this Excellent <HI>Man, through a suddain</HI> Temptation <HI>of</HI> Lust, ex∣cited by the alluring Bait <HI>of</HI> Beauty, fell into those gross and hainous Sins of <HI>Adultery</HI> and <HI>Murther;</HI> I could not forbear to <HI>display</HI> that Part of his <HI>Life</HI> also, as foreseeing there might some useful <HI>Remarks</HI> be made thereon, which might be of Service
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
to <HI>caution</HI> others. Wherefore, run∣ning hastily over the former Part of his Reign, and but lightly touching, in a general way, his <HI>Wars</HI> and <HI>Mar∣tial Enterprizes;</HI> I entred, as dire∣ctly as I well could, upon the <HI>foul Story</HI> of <HI>fair BATH-SHEBA:</HI> and, as consequent thereof, the contrived Death <HI>of her</HI> abused Husband, the <HI>brave</HI> and <HI>valiant URIAH</HI>. Which, with the <HI>better Account</HI> of <HI>David</HI>'s eminent <HI>Sorrow</HI> for it, <HI>Repentance</HI> of it, <HI>Recovery</HI> from it, and <HI>Resto∣ration</HI> to the <HI>Favour</HI> of <HI>God</HI> again, closes the <HI>Third Book</HI>.</P>
<P>There, indeed, I was forc'd to make another <HI>Stop;</HI> which I thought would have proved a <HI>full Stop:</HI> for it last∣ed more than <HI>Twenty Years</HI>. The
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
<HI>Poem</HI> was begun, and so far carried on (Excepting only the <HI>First Chap∣ter</HI> of the <HI>First Book)</HI> in the Year <HI>1688.</HI> When <HI>The Prince of Orange</HI> landing, and the <HI>Nation</HI> being in <HI>Arms;</HI> the <HI>Noise</HI> of <HI>Guns,</HI> and <HI>Sounds</HI> of <HI>Drums</HI> and <HI>Trumpets</HI> so affrighted, and disturbed my <HI>peace∣ful Muse,</HI> that both <HI>She,</HI> for a while, for sook me, and <HI>I</HI> thereupon the Work. Save that, upon a <HI>Review,</HI> some time after, observing how abruptly <HI>David</HI> was brought in: that he might not look like one of the <HI>Knights Errand</HI> of Old, rushing into a <HI>Fray</HI> with his <HI>Beavor</HI> down, that none could know either who he was, or whence he came, I added the <HI>First Chapter;</HI> thereby beginning the <HI>Story</HI> a little
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
higher, that I might introduce my <HI>Hero</HI> with somewhat the more Ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>There it rested, without any Pro∣spect of its ever going further, until the last Winter. When, having less <HI>Health,</HI> and more <HI>Leisure,</HI> than at some times before; I took it up, for an <HI>Entertainment,</HI> to make some <HI>un∣easie Hours</HI> pass somewhat less unea∣sily over. And after I had read it through, considering with my self, that if, after my Death, being found amongst my loose Papers, it should be committed to the <HI>Press;</HI> it could pass for, at best but an <HI>imperfect,</HI> or <HI>unfinish'd Piece:</HI> I found an In∣clination of Mind, to carry on the <HI>Story,</HI> if I could, to the <HI>End</HI> of
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
<HI>David</HI>'s <HI>Life</HI>. Wherefore giving a kind <HI>Invitation</HI> to my <HI>gentle Muse</HI> to return (who, by some short <HI>Visits,</HI> on <HI>particular</HI> Occasions, in the <HI>Interval,</HI> had given me some Ground to hope, she had not quite abandoned me) I entred again upon the <HI>Subject,</HI> where I had left off; and by Degrees went through it, till I had brought my <HI>warlike Hero</HI> to his <HI>peaceful Grave</HI>.</P>
<P>After it was finished, deliberating about the <HI>Publishing</HI> of it; as whe∣ther to <HI>Publish</HI> it <HI>my self,</HI> or leave it, as a <HI>Posthume,</HI> to be <HI>published</HI> (if thought fit) by some <HI>kind</HI> Hand, after my Death: the <HI>Reasons,</HI> which turn'd the <HI>Ballance</HI> for <HI>present Print∣ing</HI> were; <HI>First,</HI> that, at present the <HI>Press</HI> is open: which possibly may
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
hereafter be shut. And <HI>Secondly,</HI> That if, upon the <HI>Publication</HI> of it, <HI>MOMUS</HI> should <HI>Carp</HI> (which he is but too apt to do, even where there is less Occasion for it) I might be at hand, ready my self to <HI>Answer</HI> his <HI>Cavils;</HI> who, if any Cause be given for them, gave it: though assuredly without any Intention so to do.</P>
<P>Till I had wholly finished, and transcribed also, this <HI>Poem;</HI> I had not had the Opportunity of perusing the Learned <HI>COWLEY</HI>'s <HI>DAVIDEIS;</HI> though I had heard of it, and, I think, had once a transient Sight of it, before I began this. Since I have read it through, with my best Attention: and am very well pleas'd, that I had not read it before: lest his great
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
<HI>Name,</HI> high <HI>Stile,</HI> and lofty <HI>Fancy</HI> should have led me, though unawares, into an <HI>apish Imitation</HI> of them; which doubtless would have look'd very <HI>odly,</HI> and <HI>ill</HI> in me, how <HI>admi∣rable</HI> soever in him.</P>
<P>His Aim and mine differ widely: the <HI>Method</HI> of each no less. <HI>He</HI> wrote for the <HI>Learned;</HI> and those too of the <HI>Upper Form:</HI> and his <HI>Flights</HI> are answerable. <HI>I</HI> write for common <HI>Readers;</HI> in a Stile familiar, and easie to be understood by such. <HI>His</HI> would have needed (if he had not ad∣ded it) a large <HI>Paraphrase</HI> upon it; to <HI>Explain</HI> the many <HI>difficult Passages</HI> in it. <HI>Mine,</HI> as it has none, will not, I hope, need any.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11"/>I have the same <HI>Aim</HI> in this, the same <HI>Inducement</HI> to it, as I had in writing the <HI>Sacred History</HI> of both the <HI>Old</HI> and the <HI>New Testament,</HI> viz. To invite, and endeavour to draw all, the <HI>Youth</HI> especially, of either <HI>Sex,</HI> to improve their <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Studies;</HI> by imploying both in reading <HI>better Books,</HI> written on <HI>better Subjects,</HI> than <HI>too many</HI> of them <HI>too often</HI> do.</P>
<P>I am not so wholly a <HI>Stranger</HI> to the <HI>Writings</HI> of the most <HI>Celebrated Poets,</HI> as well <HI>Antient</HI> as <HI>Modern,</HI> as not to know, that the great <HI>Em∣bellishments</HI> of their <HI>Poems</HI> consist mostly in their <HI>extravagant,</HI> and al∣most <HI>boundless Fancies; Amazing,</HI> and even <HI>Dazeling Flights; Luxu∣rious Inventions; Wild Hyper∣ble's;
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
Lofty Language:</HI> with an <HI>Introduction</HI> of <HI>Angels, Spirits, Daemons,</HI> and their respective <HI>Dei∣ties,</HI> &amp;c. Which, as not suitable to my Purpose, I industriously abstain from.</P>
<P>In a Word, I am not so <HI>vain to seek</HI> Applause: I don't expect to be commended. If <HI>Critics,</HI> on the one hand; and <HI>Carpers,</HI> on the other, will give me leave to pass the Streets <HI>quietly,</HI> without <HI>Quarrelling,</HI> or <HI>Jost'ling:</HI> 'tis all <HI>I</HI> ask at their Hands. I don't affect the <HI>Title</HI> of <HI>Poet</HI>. Let 'em call me, in that re∣spect, what they please. The <HI>Learn∣ed,</HI> and <HI>good Natur'd,</HI> will, I hope, be <HI>Favourable</HI> in their <HI>Censures:</HI> The <HI>Ignorant</HI> and <HI>Crabbed</HI> I regard
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
not. <HI>I</HI> am more <HI>modest,</HI> than to ex∣pect Admission amongst the <HI>best</HI> Po∣ets: and yet think it a little below me to be Ranked with the <HI>very worst Nec Suffaenus sum, nec inscribe Praxitelem</HI>. I am content to walk if I may be allowed in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="inter">In Medio Virtus: Medio Tutissimus ibis.</NOTE> <HI>middle Way</HI> where the <HI>safest</HI> Walking is, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where I shall be sure to find <HI>VER¦TUE:</HI> than whom I desire no <HI>better Company</HI>.</P>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemselves, that to the Feast they might draw nigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="17"/>
<L>Then unto <HI>Jesse</HI>'s House the Prophet went,</L>
<L>Upon his special Errand most intent.</L>
<L>And when, amongst his Sons, he <HI>Eliab</HI> spy'd;</L>
<L>Strait, This is He, within himself he cry'd.</L>
<L>For <HI>Eliab</HI> was the eldest Son, a tall</L>
<L>Young Man, and fit, he thought, to follow <HI>Saul</HI>.</L>
<L>Therefore he said, Surely, <HI>The Lord's Anointed</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is now before him:</HI> This hath he appointed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But God thus check'd him. Look not at the Face</L>

<L>Think not that I, as Man, see: Th' outward Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>He looks upon; but <HI>I regard the Heart</HI>.</L>
<L>This Check made <HI>Samuel</HI> wary. He no more</L>
<L>Consults his Reason, as he did before.</L>
<L>But when old <HI>Jesse</HI> had before him set</L>
<L><HI>Sev'n</HI> of his Sons, all proper Persons; yet</L>
<L>The Prophet, to his Guide now keeping close,</L>
<L>Told him, The Lord had chosen none of those.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And are here all? said <HI>Samu'el</HI>. No, said he;</L>
<L>There is one more, the youngest: Cannot we</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="18"/>Go on without him? He my Flocks doth keep:</L>
<L>And is from Home, at present, with my Sheep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No, no, said <HI>Samu'el</HI>; send, and fetch him Home:</L>
<L>For we will not sit down until he come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Strait to the Field a Messenger doth run,</L>
<L>To fetch home <HI>David, Jesse</HI>'s youngest Son.</L>
<L>Whom, come, he makes before the Prophet stand.</L>
<L>Until he had receiv'd the Lord's Command.</L>
<L>That quickly came. The Lord said, This is he:</L>
<L>Anoint him. <HI>Samuel</HI>, with bended Knee,</L>
<L>Takes up his Horn; and on young <HI>David</HI>'s Head,</L>
<L>The Consecrating Oyl doth freely shed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From that Day forward, upon <HI>David</HI> came</L>
<L>The Spirit of the Lord; which might proclame.</L>
<L>To well-discerning Eyes, his Unction: as</L>
<L>Of <HI>Saul</HI>'s Rejection a sure Token 'twas,</L>
<L>That the <HI>good Spirit</HI> did from him depart;</L>
<L>And to an <HI>evil Spirit</HI> left his Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
<L>This evil Spirit <HI>from the Lord</HI> is said</L>
<L>On <HI>Saul</HI> to come: And it such <HI>Trouble</HI> made</L>
<L>To <HI>Saul</HI>, and all his Servants; that they though</L>
<L>The best Expedient was, there should be sought</L>
<L>Some <HI>skilful</HI> Man, who on his <HI>Harp</HI> might play;</L>
<L>And drive that Spirit, for the time, away.</L>
<L>This they propose. He shews a ready Mind</L>
<L>To try it: bids them such an <HI>Harper</HI> find.</L>
<L>One mention'd <HI>David</HI>; whom he thus set forth:</L>
<L>A cunning Player, and a Man of Worth;</L>
<L>Valiant and Wise; a comely Person; One</L>
<L>To whom the Lord had special Favour shown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This tickled <HI>Saul</HI>. To <HI>Jesse</HI> strait he sent</L>
<L>Some Messengers to fetch him. <HI>David</HI> went:</L>
<L>And with him <HI>Bread, Wine</HI> and a <HI>Kid</HI> did bring</L>
<L>A <HI>Present</HI>, from his Father, to the King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Office is assigned him, to stand</L>
<L>Before the King; and with a skilful Hand,</L>
<L>When <HI>Saul</HI> was troubled, on his Harp to play.</L>
<L>He did so: th' evil Spirit went away.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="20"/>This made him dear to <HI>Saul. Saul</HI> quickly found</L>
<L>The <HI>Benefit</HI>, which did to him redound</L>
<L>From the sweet <HI>Harper</HI>'s Musick. For the sake</L>
<L>Whereof, he did him <HI>Armor-Bearer</HI> make.</L>
<L>A Martial Office 'twas, to bear the <HI>Sheild</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>Saul</HI>, when he should march into the Field.</L>
<L>Which shews, he found <HI>David</HI> as well could weild</L>
<L>His Arms (a <HI>Lance</HI>, or <HI>Spear</HI>, and massy <HI>Sheild</HI>)</L>
<L>And thereby, if Occasion were, defend</L>
<L>His Person, and, in need, due Succour lend:</L>
<L>As softly strike upon the tuneful String;</L>
<L>And thereby give <HI>Refreshment</HI> to the King.</L>
<L>Wherefore, unwilling <HI>David</HI> should go back,</L>
<L>(Lest he too soon his Ministry might lack;)</L>
<L>He sent again to <HI>Jesse</HI>, to request</L>
<L>That, with his leave, he might be longer blest</L>
<L>With <HI>David</HI>'s Service: that he might be freed</L>
